# FISH EXPLAINS PLAN OF MEIKLEJOHN FOR NEW KIND OF COURSE
## 
### 
Wisconsin is watching with great
interest tlie preparations of Professor
Alexander Meiklejohn for starting,
next fall, an "Experimental College"
in the University, according to Pro
fessor Carl R. Fish of the university
at Madison, who is a member of the
faculty of the summer quarter.
Professor Meiklejohn plans to con
duct what is to he known as the "Ex
perimental College," in which only
120 are to be enrolled this year. The
plan is to take one broad field and
study all its phases, instead of offer
ing a number of courses, as is now
done in modern universities.
This fall. Greek civilization at its
highest point, will be studied, which
will include the consideration of philo
sophy, art, history, drama, and allied
subjects. A big question before the
sponsors now is how to bring in the
study of the sciences, which they do
not intend to do next fall. The follow
ing year it is planned to study English
civilization.
Cross-Section of University
"Enrollment in this school," says
Professor Fish, "is not to be on the
basis of grades, but 011 the priority of
application. What the school wants is
a cross-section of the students." En
rollment is not to be hand-picked, but
is to be 011 the basis of first come, first
served.
The faculty of the college is com
posed of twelve men who will serve in
the Experimental College two-thirds
of their time, and in the university
the other third. Each man will have
under him ten students, affording fine
opportunities for good discussion
groups. The students will attend this
college for two years, at the end of
which they will attain regular enroll
ment with advanced standing in the
university.
Seventeen Registered So Far
Further plans are to allow but 125
to enter in the second year, which
will make a total registration of 250
during the second year. Enrollment
will probably increase, depending on
the reception of the plan, which this
year, so far, has not been good, as Pro
fessor Fish says that, the latest figure
for registration that he has heard was
seventeen.
It is planned to have this college
correspond in a certain measure to the
junior colleges.
Professor Fish holds the chair of
American History at Wisconsin.

during the second year. Enrollment
will probably increase, depending on
the reception of the plan, which this
year, so far, has not been good, as Pro
fessor Fish says that, the latest figure
for registration that he has heard was
seventeen.
It is planned to have this college
correspond in a certain measure to the
junior colleges.

Wisconsin is watching with great
interest tlie preparations of Professor
Alexander Meiklejohn for starting,
next fall, an "Experimental College"
in the University, according to Pro
fessor Carl R. Fish of the university
at Madison, who is a member of the
faculty of the summer quarter.
Professor Meiklejohn plans to con
duct what is to he known as the "Ex
perimental College," in which only
120 are to be enrolled this year. The
plan is to take one broad field and
study all its phases, instead of offer
ing a number of courses, as is now
done in modern universities.
This fall. Greek civilization at its
highest point, will be studied, which
will include the consideration of philo
sophy, art, history, drama, and allied
subjects. A big question before the
sponsors now is how to bring in the
study of the sciences, which they do
not intend to do next fall. The follow
ing year it is planned to study English
civilization.
Cross-Section of University
"Enrollment in this school," says
Professor Fish, "is not to be on the
basis of grades, but 011 the priority of
application. What the school wants is
a cross-section of the students." En
rollment is not to be hand-picked, but
is to be 011 the basis of first come, first
served.
The faculty of the college is com
posed of twelve men who will serve in
the Experimental College two-thirds
of their time, and in the university
the other third. Each man will have
under him ten students, affording fine
opportunities for good discussion
groups. The students will attend this
college for two years, at the end of
which they will attain regular enroll
ment with advanced standing in the
university.
Seventeen Registered So Far
Further plans are to allow but 125
to enter in the second year, which
will make a total registration of 250
during the second year. Enrollment
will probably increase, depending on
the reception of the plan, which this
year, so far, has not been good, as Pro
fessor Fish says that, the latest figure
for registration that he has heard was
seventeen.
