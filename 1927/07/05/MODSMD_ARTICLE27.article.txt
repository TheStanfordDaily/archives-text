The experiment to be carried on this year by Dr. Alexander Meikle
john, genial ex-president of Amherst, at the University of Wisconsin
will be watched with interest by educators all over the country. Dr.
Meiklejohn's plan is to take students in their first two years at the
university and give them one or two broad fields to study in all their
phases, rather than following the present haphazard method of selection
of courses.
lie believes- that if a student is able completely to master the tech
nique of one field of study, that he can then turn to whatever field he
chooses and master that as well. Thus, the students are to spend two
years in Meiklejohnd college, and then return to the university proper
where they can take up any branch of study that appeals to them. Ihe
work is to be largely individual, with ten or twelve students to each
instructor.
Contrasted to this plan is the Independent Study Plan as worked out
here at Stanford. In place of spending the first two years in study of a
broad field or two, the student is carried through the regular lower
division course, to give him a firm grasp of materials and a wide tange
of choice. Thus the student is brought into contact with many fields of
knowledge and endeavor. Then, if he so desires, and is capable, he is
allowed to go on the Independent Study Plan, and specialize in whatever
field he sees fit, under the individual guidance of a professor in that
subject.
Although the two plans differ so radically in their conception, yet they
are very much alike in their attempt really to train and improve the minds
of students. There is no reason why both should not be successful. One
of the grave faults of the present educational system, "it seems, is the fact
that so many students can attend an American university for four years,
or even longer, and still acquire very little of real culture. The error
seems assignable to the wide choice that is afforded the students in the
way of courses. Instead of delving deeply into one subject, he is apt
merely to get a superficial smattering of a great number.
