Overheard on the campus: "If you do as much work as that right
along, you will make it harder for the rest of us. Do you suppose he
will expect us all to put in as much time as that?"
Which seems to indicate that summer quarter students have some of
the same attitude toward "work" in college that is found sometimes in
others, for the group in which this remark was made was composed ot
the "earnest" kind who use their vacation period to extend their equip
ment for the work they are doing.
They are, in fact, quite earnest —also human. They are intent on
learning and not on side-stepping effort in learning. But they realize
that under the competitive system that surrounds our class work extraor
dinary industry on the part of a few raises the standard to a level that is
difficult for those who may he equally inent on some othes courses.
Grades and honor points are nuisances, though maybe necessary
nuisances. They do keep some constitutional laggards up to the mark.
And after all, if a student is not really eager to avoid as much work as
possible, and is in earnest about the main thing—which is his own de
velopment and broadening—he will probably get along all right and need
not worry too greatly about how much time some other student is
putting in 011 any course.
