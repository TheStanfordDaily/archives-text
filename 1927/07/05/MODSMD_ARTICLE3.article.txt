# Geology Class Begins Summer Field Trips
## 
### 
Summer field trips for geology stu
dents began Thursday afternoon at 4
o'clock when one section of the class
in General Geology went out, under
the direction of Acting Professor U. S.
Grant on a two-hour trip. The students
were required to sign up for this trip
early in the week, and were advised to
come equipped with hammer, hand
lens, and a map of the Palo Alto quad
rangle, the section of the country lying
immediately adjacent to Stanford Uni
versity.
The large enrollment in Geology I
has necessitated three sections for
field trips. The second made its trip
Friday afternoon and the third Satur
day morning.
