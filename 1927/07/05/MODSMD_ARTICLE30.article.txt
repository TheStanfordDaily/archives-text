# Addition to Press Building In Progress of Erection
## 
### 
To relieve the over-crowded condi
tion of the building which houses the
Stanford Press and offices of campus
journalistic publications, a new build
ing is under process of erection as an
addition to the Press Building. On its
completion the building will be used
mainly as a composing room for the
Stanford Daily as well as for some of
the equipment of the Stanford Press.
The Daily will continue its headquar
ters in the small building nearby.
