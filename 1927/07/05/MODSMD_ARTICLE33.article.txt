# DR. JORDAN TO TALK ON FUR SEAL AT HIS THURSDAY MEETING
## Is Acquainted With Subject Both as Naturalist And Diplomat 
### 
Dr. Jordan will talk on the fur seal
at his Thursday evening conference
this week. This is a topic on which he
is peculiarly qualified to speak, not
only because lie is a naturalist, but
also because he was engaged in diplo
macy regarding the fur seals of Bering
Sea at the time when they were the
subject of international discussion and
treaties.
In the summer of IS9G Dr. Jordan
was appointed by President Cleveland
to be head of the American division
of a joint high commission of investi
gation of the fur seal problem in the
Bering Sea, to co-operate with a simi
lar British commission in an endeavor
to preserve the herds, which were
dwindling. The difficulty arose over
the killing of female seals in the open
sea, with 110 adequate protection ar
ranged by previous international deci
sions. The work in this connection
ran through two summers, and in
volved extensive acquaintance with
the habits of the seals ahd attempts
to make censuses of them. Later Dr.
Jordan was 011 a diplomatic commis
sion which finally made progress in
settling legal difficulties between vari
ous nations over the seal fisheries.
These investigations resulted not
only in large official volumes of find
ings, but a charming book of "true
fiction" by Dr. Jordan, the life of the
seal under the title, "The Story of
Matka." Matka, the Russian for
"mother," is the term for t-he female
seals in that language.
The fur seal is, as a matter of fact,
an aquatic bear, and is quite different
from other seals.
Dr. Jordan's conferences are infor
mal talks at his home at 7:30 o'clock
Thursday afternoons, to which all are
welcome, without special invitation.
