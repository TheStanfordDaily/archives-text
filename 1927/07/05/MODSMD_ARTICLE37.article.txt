# Only Sixteen Books Are Lost From Open Shelves
## 
### 
Stanford's honor spirit again scores
a victory. The reserve hook room of
the library lost only sixteen books last
quarter.
Books that are required reading for
courses are kept in the reserve hook
room. These total between two and
three thousand volumes a quarter that
sire on open shelves accessible to the
students. The loss of only sixteen
books is considered a good showing.
Another main reason for the small
loss of books is that those in greatest
demand during the quarter and at
examination times are taken to the
desk where closer check can be kept
on them.
