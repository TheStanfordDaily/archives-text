# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
How does lie do it? Fourteen years I
of a bone-bruising, sinew-crushing 1
sport and still able to carry on! Be- j
hold Reggie McNamara, the "king of
six-day bike riders," winner of eleven
long grinds, second in seven others,
hero of innumerable jams, and a real
"Iron Man" if these ever was one!
Wotta man! Wotta man! He'll prob
ably be riding in sixday bicycle races
years from now!
To my mind, the greatest examples
of courage and heroism in sports in j
the last year or so were Jess Sweet- '
ser's victory in the British amateur
golf tournament while suffering from
influenza and four or five other ail- j
ments; Jack Delaney's heroic stand .
against Paul Berlenbach in December
1925, after an accident to his knee
had nearly ended his ring career; and
McNamara's and Linari's victory in
the 41st annual six-day bike-race last
December, after a series of accidents,
any one of which would have put the
ordinary mortal in the hospital. In
spite of bruises, scrapes, dislocations, j
cuts, scratches, splinters, and not to |
speak of being dead tired from six j

days and nights of pedaling around
dangerous turns in a smoke-laden at
mostphere, these two courageous ath
letes didn't know what the word "quit"
meant and carried on in spite of their
agony to a glorious victory.
To answer the question at the be
ginning of this piece, the lion-hearted
Anzac does it in the following way, to
quote excerpts from an interview with
the Iron Man by "Sparrow" Robertson,
published in the Paris Herald last
winter:
"Four or five weeks before a race I
start riding fifty or more miles each
alternate day at a fast pace over the
roads or on a track. The other days
are given over to cross-country run
ning which generally takes in about
fifteen miles. That sort of work is
done in the forenoons, after having
had a good night's sleep. And don't
forget that an hour or two of sleep
before 12 o'clock will do much more
good than twice the number of hours
after midnight. I make it a rule while
training to be in bed by 9 or 10<
o'clock. In the morning I am up about
7 o'clock."


King McNamara
