# Student Clings to Suitcase As Boat Capsizes in Bay
## 
### 
James Henley, '27, found a new use
for an old suitcase Saturday night,
when the yacht in which he and a
companion were riding capsized in
San Francisco Bay off Crissy Field.
Thrown into the water, Hanley clung
to his suitcase which held him up. His
companion managed to get hold of a
life belt. Both were rescued before
long. Henley was prominent in swim
ming events at Stanford.
