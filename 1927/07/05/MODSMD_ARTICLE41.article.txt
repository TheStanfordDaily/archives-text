# Memorial Church Scene Of 15 June Weddings
## 
### 
Stanford Memorial Church is very
popular as a tit setting for June wed
dings, both with those who are, or i
have been students here, and with
many outsiders. Fifteen marriages !
were performed here last month
and an almost full calendar continues
well on into July.
Lynn Albert Vietor and Miss Vera
Perro were married in the chapel early !
last month. Vietor was enrolled here ;
in 1916. Later he served in the World
War in the Stanford Unit of the S.A.C. J
When the war was ended he returned
to continue his profession as mechan
ical engineer, and was stationed at
Cia Real Del Montey Pachuca Pa-!
cliuca. Hidalgo, Mexico. His perma
nent residence is in Eureka, Caifornia. j
The other Stanford people to be j

married in the Chapel last month
were Marjorie Allen to William Pabst,
and Rita Allegrini to William Mackey.
! Reverend John Stephen, of Palo Alto,
1 officiated at the month's only double
wedding. Miss Christine Binldey, and
j her sister, Elizabeth, were married, i

the former to Elmer Hoffock, and the
latter to Enrique Wahuhe, in a very
charming ceremony. The Chapel, with
its calm, magnificent dignity, is rap
idly continuing on its way to be a
very popular "Church-around-the-eor
ner."
