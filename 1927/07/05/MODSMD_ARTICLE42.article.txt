# STANFORD HAS 40 MEN AT MONTEREY ARTILLERY CAMP
## Students Follow Intensive Programs of Drills And Lectures STUDY FIRING PROBLEMS Target Practice at Range Will Conclude Period Of Training 
### 
Forty Stanford men, forming the'
Reserve Officers Summer Camp in j
field artillery at Presidio Monterey ;
are now getting a good taste of the j
practical side of military work. Cap- !
tain Moses W. Pettigrew and Lieuten- j
ant Charles S. Whitmore of the Stan- j
ford R.0.T.C., assisted by two of the j
officers stationed at Monterey, are in j
charge of the work.
Mounted Drill
During the mornings, the first two
hours are spent in mounted battery
drill. In this work the student learns
to put the battery through the various
formations used both on the march
and in parade. The last two hours i
alternate between reviewing lectures \
in artillery firing and practical work j
with the plane table in locating the i
battery and target positions on the j
firing chart.
During the afternoon, the first half !
hour is spent in foot drill, which, while j
not as important with the field artil
lery as with the infantry, cannot be
entirely overlooked. Following the |
fool, drill, the men go out on mounted
reconnaisance, which to the unin
formed, is work in the selection and j
occupation of battery positions and
observation posts.
Fight Imaginary Enemy
At the offset, the officer in charge !
states a problem to be worked out,
such as giving the position of an
imaginary enemy and the locality in
which the battery is to be placed to !
support its own infantry, and from |
there on, the student officer in charge I
is required to work the problem out
for himself.
All of the work at present is di-'
rected to get the men in readiness for j
a one week's camp on the artillery
range which is situated about seven !
miles from Monterey.
At this time all the prospective of
ficers will have an opportunity to con
trol the fire of a battery of four French ;
seventy-five millimeter guns firing at j
targets from one to four miles. A large !
number of targets are adjusted on
exactly as in regular war conditions, j
In Connection With Unit
This summer camp is given in con
nection with four years' work in mili
tary science at various universities,
at the completion of which the stu
dent receives from the President of
the United States, a commission as j
second lieutenant in the Organized |
Reserve Corps. This furnishes the |
government a reserve personnel of I
trained officers to be called upon only
in case of national emergency such as i
the World War.
The Stanford men started drill \
June 20. The training period is of a !
duration of six weeks. There is a bat- >
talion of Field Artillery and a regi
ment of Cavalry at the "Presidio Mon- !
terey. All of the'artillery students are j
from Stanford.

All of the work at present is di-'
rected to get the men in readiness for j
a one week's camp on the artillery
range which is situated about seven !
miles from Monterey.
At this time all the prospective of
ficers will have an opportunity to con
trol the fire of a battery of four French ;
seventy-five millimeter guns firing at j
targets from one to four miles. A large !
number of targets are adjusted on
exactly as in regular war conditions, j
In Connection With Unit
This summer camp is given in con
nection with four years' work in mili
tary science at various universities,
at the completion of which the stu
dent receives from the President of
the United States, a commission as j
second lieutenant in the Organized |
Reserve Corps. This furnishes the |
government a reserve personnel of I
trained officers to be called upon only
in case of national emergency such as i
the World War.
The Stanford men started drill \
June 20. The training period is of a !
duration of six weeks. There is a bat- >
talion of Field Artillery and a regi
ment of Cavalry at the "Presidio Mon- !
terey. All of the'artillery students are j
from Stanford.
Forty Stanford men, forming the'
Reserve Officers Summer Camp in j
field artillery at Presidio Monterey ;
are now getting a good taste of the j
practical side of military work. Cap- !
tain Moses W. Pettigrew and Lieuten- j
ant Charles S. Whitmore of the Stan- j
ford R.0.T.C., assisted by two of the j
officers stationed at Monterey, are in j
charge of the work.
Mounted Drill
During the mornings, the first two
hours are spent in mounted battery
drill. In this work the student learns
to put the battery through the various
formations used both on the march
and in parade. The last two hours i
alternate between reviewing lectures \
in artillery firing and practical work j
with the plane table in locating the i
battery and target positions on the j
firing chart.
During the afternoon, the first half !
hour is spent in foot drill, which, while j
not as important with the field artil
lery as with the infantry, cannot be
entirely overlooked. Following the |
fool, drill, the men go out on mounted
reconnaisance, which to the unin
formed, is work in the selection and j
occupation of battery positions and
observation posts.
Fight Imaginary Enemy
At the offset, the officer in charge !
states a problem to be worked out,
such as giving the position of an
imaginary enemy and the locality in
which the battery is to be placed to !
support its own infantry, and from |
there on, the student officer in charge I
is required to work the problem out
for himself.
