# POUGHKEEPSIE EVENT RECALLS FINAL RACE OF STANFORD CREW
## Cardinals Nearly Defeat the Favorites in Great Boat Struggle 
### 
The recent race at Poughkeepsie, in
which Columbia carried oft' the win
ning laurels, with Washington second
and California third, recalls the last
appearance of Stanford in the annual
classic.
After having been hopelessly out
classed in 1912, the Stanford crew
journeyed East in 1915, determined to
reverse the tables on her Eastern
rivals over the four-mile course. Ex
perts classed the Redshirts as hope
less outsiders, finding especial fault
with their style of rowing.
The varsity crewmen, however, were
determined to vindicate themselves,
and they proceeded to do so with a
vengeance. After a slow start, they
forged steadily into the lead; finally,
at the three-mile mark, leading even
the favorites, Cornell. From this point
until nearly the finish, the two crews
strove, stroke for stroke.
Only a final spurt enabled the Ithaca
shell to cross the finish mark, a scant
eight-foot winner in four miles. And
Stanford had won the athletic respect
of the East. Shortly after this, due to
the lack of facilities on the campus,
crew was abandoned here as a varsity
sport.
