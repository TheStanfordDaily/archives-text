# MORE STUDENTS SEEK EDUCATION A.M. THAN IN FORMER SUMMERS
## 
### 
More students are working toward
a master's degree in Education than
in any previous summer, although the
total number enrolled is approximately
the same as last year.
Complete figures are not yet avail
able. The proportion of students tak
ing work for only the first half of the
quarter, with the idea of meeting state
requirements for future teaching posi
tions, is smaller than it has been in
former years, and more are staying
the full quarter, carrying on studies as
a part of a definite program extending
over a considerable period.
As in former years, both faculty and
students in the school are representa
tive of many states outside California.
Besides the regular Stanford faculty,
all but one of whom are on duty for
the summer, there are a number of
outside authorities called in for spe
cial courses. These come from other
California institutions and from Ohio,
Oregon, and Arizona. Among the stu
dents are teachers, principals, and
superintendents from various states.
