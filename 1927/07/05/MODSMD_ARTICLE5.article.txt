# Last of Bargain Days In Study List Changes; Two Dollar Fine Now
## 
### 
Today is the last of the bargain
clays in making changes in study
lists.
Beginning tomorrow every new
subject taken up will involve a
fine of $2. Likewise, every subject
dropped will entail a similar fine
of $2. if a student substitutes one
course for another, the total cost
is $4.
A student is held accountable
by the Registrar for every course
that appears on the study list on
file in his office, and no credit
can be obtained for courses that
are not so filed.
