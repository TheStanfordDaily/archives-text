# Many Students Go Away for Brief Holiday
## 
### 
A "deserted village" atmosphere
spread over the Stanford campus the
past week-end when most of the stu
dents went out of town to spend Inde
pendence Day. Few men were at the
fraternity houses, while at least half
of the girls in Roble Hall deserted it
by Sunday afternoon. Old Union pre
sented a deserted appearance.
Encina and Toyon had only a few
men, as was evidenced from the fact
that only about a dozen appeared at
the Toyon Club dining room Sunday
and Monday.
Those who live near the University
went home to spend the week-end and
Monday with the home folks. Those
who came from far away took advan
tage of the nearby, and even the dis
tant, places of interest and amusement
that California has to offer.
Among the places that attracted the
students Yosemite, Santa Cruz, and
the Big Basin proved the most popu
lar. Not a few of them spent the day
in San Francisco, while a number
spent their short vacation outing in
the nearby hills or at the beaches.
