# FORTY AT THE FIRST SUMMER GATHERING OF STANFORD DAMES
## Nursery Provided to Care For Children of Members 
### 
About forty members of the Stan
ford Dames met yesterday afternoon
at the Women's Clubhouse in the first
meeting of the summer quarter. After
the members had gathered, each was
asked to tell something about herself
as an introduction to the others, and
the rest of the afternoon was passed
in informal enjoyment.
During the afternoon Miss Dorothea
Lois Dyck gave three numbers on the
piano: Rubenstein's "Kamennoi Os
trow," Rachmaninoff's "Polichinelle,"
and Brain's "Cradle Song," after which
refreshments of punch and cakes were
served.
The small children of the members
were cared for in the nursery that was
established in a room near those in
which the meeting was held.
