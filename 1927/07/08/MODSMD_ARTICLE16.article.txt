# CARRIER SERVICE BEGINS ON CAMPUS FIRST OF AUGUST
## Two Mail Deliveries Daily To Residences But Not To Dormitories 
### 
Carrier delivery service for the Uni
versity will be started August 1, it
was announced by postal authorities
today. There will be two deliveries
daily for all classes of mail to the
residence district including the fra
ternity houses but not the dormitories.
People are asked to provide num
bers and letter boxes. Eight letter re
ceiving boxes will be operated on the
campus for which there will be an
early morning collection.
Students continue to have mail ad
dressed incorrectly to Stanford Uni
versity Branch, Palo Alto, instead of
to Stanford University, California, as
the authorities prefer, it was said.
