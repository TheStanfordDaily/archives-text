## 
### 
Traditional "roughs' seats" will be
sold tonight for "Craig's Wife," and
for all other summer quarter plays.
Tickets will go 011 sale for fifty cents
shortly before the performance starts,
and will insure each "rough" a seat
somewhere in the house.
Then, as has previously been the
custom, when the lights go out all
"roughs" are permitted to seize any
unoccupied seat that will be to his
advantage.
Norman Larsen, Dramatic Manager,
has announced that tickets will go 011
sale at the box office at 7 o'clock.
"This early time," he states, "has be
come necessary because of the num
ber of late requests for reservations."
