# TRYOUTS TO BE HELD ON MONDAY FOR REST OF SEASONS PLAYS
## All Students Urged to Try For "Angel in the House" And "Loyalties" 
### 
Tryouts for parts in the two re
maining plays to be given this quarter
are to be held 011 next Monday eve
ning in the Assembly Hall from 7
until 9.
Any person who is interested in dra
matics is invited to try out at this
time, whether or not he has tried out
before, has been in a play, or is en
rolled in a dramatics class. The try
outs are open to all enrolled students.
Gordon Davis will direct the produc
tion of the two plays, "Loyalties," by
Galsworthy, and "Angel in the House,"
by Eden R. Philpotts. All of the char
acters for both of these productions
will be cast 011 Monday night, July 11.
There will be no further tryouts or
â€¢eliminations.
Those who tried for parts in the
first play several weeks ago are espe
cially urged to appear again, as Mr.
Davis states that he was particularly
well-pleased with some of the tryouts,
and that he feels that many of them
will be available for these next plays.
Work on both of the plays will begin
on Tuesday. It is quite possible that
rehearsals for these two plays will be
alternated, thus making the work less
severe 011 the cast members, and also
giving more time for the preparation
of the final play.
