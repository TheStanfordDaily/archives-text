# DAVIS PLEASED WITH CAST AS WORK ENDS FOR STAGING OF "CRAIG'S WIFE" TONIGHT
## All Are Well Suited to Play Difficult Roles in George Kelly's Prize Play FORMER TRAINING TELLS Director Calls It "One of Most Significant Productions" 
### 
! "One of the most significant plays
! that we have done at Stanford," said
| Gordon Davis at the conclusion of the
j final dress rehearsal of "Craig's Wife,"
j which is to be staged tonight at 8:15
| in the Assembly Hall. This is the first
j production of George Kelly's 192(5
Pulitzer Prize play in this locality.
At the final review of the play last
night, the director expressed himself
:as thoroughly well-pleased with the
play, the stage set, and the showing
i of the cast.
"I am particularly happy to have
i had such a cast," he remarked. ,fl This
[ type of play demands experience and
I grasp of .character and a maturity of
! outlook which these people, since
! many of them are directors or teach
| ers, possess to a high degree."
The cast for the play was selected
j only after three competitive tryouts,
j during which some of the most promis
ing dramatic material that lias ap
peared recently on the campus was
sifted for individuals who could best
interpret the carefully characterized
roles in this play.
Dorothea Wilson Is Lead
The leading role is portrayed by
i Miss Dorothea Wilson, who sustains
,an extremely difficult character
| throughout the play. Harold Brownson.
1 as Craig, her husband, gives her part
! fine support. Miss Jeannette Elliott as
1 the husband's aunt, and Miss Marcella
Kartheiser, who plays the character
part, are outstanding. The young, ro
mantic lovers, who serve as relief to
; show more clearly the coldly calculat
i ing character of Mrs. Craig, are played
iby Barbara Lansburgh and Russell
j Andrews.
Maizie, the much-scolded maid, and
| Mrs. Frazier, the talkative widow from
I across the avenue, are well interpreted
:by Robert Douthart and Martha Mont
j gomery. Lowell Roehr as Billy Birk
| mire, Frank Baker as Catelle, and
Byron Snow as Harry, help to bring
] the dramatic action to a climax.
A young recruit to campus dramatics
makes his debut in this production as
' the grocer's boy off-stage. He was dis
j covered by Gordon Davis in a Horatio
Alger fashion. Mr. Davis had noticed
a group of small boys near his home
who were engaged in putting on
"shows."
Finds Boy Actor
One of these boys, who was intense
ly interested in the little perform
ances, impressed Davis by the quality
| of his voice. He was interviewed and
I invited to accept a part in a real show,
| with the result that in tonight's pro
j duction he will speak at least two of
j the lities. He is the son of Professor
! Eliot Jones.
i The play depicts the story of Mrs.


"So I want you to get your things together, Maizie, and leave this
house in the morning." One of the situations in "Craig's Wife," but
it is not, as you might think from the picture, the outcome of the
ordinary and well-known "triangle." The persons appearing in this
picture are, from left to right: Craig, Harold Brownson; Maizie,
Roberta Douthart; Mrs. Craig, Dorothea Wilson.
Craig's devotion to her house, to the
exclusion of her husband and everyone
else. The analysis of this woman's
character is one of the features of the
play. George Kelly has clearly linked
up the highly developed science of this
woman's code with its more familiar
manifestations in the more usual
housewife.
The play gathers momentum from
the start, and through the dramatic
battle of mental forces in the first act,
sweeps to a climax in the quarrel
scene between husband and wife, dur
ing which the audience is made to feel
almost as if the curtain had been lifted
on some actual domestic tragedy. The
onlooker feels almost ashamed to lis
ten to the heated flinging back and
forth of accusation and denial, in
which the wife reveals her true char
acter and the husband recognizes that
his wife has married a house, not a
man.
The play is one of absorbing inter
est, good theatre, and provocative of
thought, at the same time. This is the
first performance of this play in north
ern California.
Immediately following the play there
will be a cast dance at the Women's
Clubhouse from 11 until 1 o'clock.
