# Licenses for Historians
## 
### 
Despite the fact that many pseudo-historians are displaying too much
license, Professor Carl R. Fish makes the statement in today's paper that
he believes licenses to be necessary for historical writers. Thus, with a
license he would combat license.
Whether or not Professor Fish was being wholly facetious or serious,
does not matter. It is doubtful if he has worked out such a plan as
registering all historians. But even impractical as such a proceduie
would be, it has elements worth considering.
Recently there has been a wide-spread wave of dissatisfaction with
the over-patriotic type of book on American history. People are tired
of hearing the founders of this country pictured as "demi-gods." They
want to read about men and women like themselves, with weaknesses,
who were yet able to go ahead and do big things.
Writers of "best sellers" in fiction have taken advantage of this.
Employing the same methods of sensationalism which have brought them
to the top of the fiction list, they are turning their talents to history. Ihe
result is a series of half-truths and misinterpreted facts. And often they
omit even the background which made their "revelations not only pos
sible, but even natural, in many cases.
The terrible fact about the whole matter is that so many readers are
entirely credulous of what they read. And the writers of sensational
books of history do not seek merely to draw the great statesmen down
to the common plane, but seem intent on dropping them far below it.
jOf course any plan attempting to muzzle these writers is fundamen
tally opposed to the freedom of speech and of the press, and cannot be
considered. But some means of discrediting them in the public mind
would be wholly desirable. After all, this is probably what Professor
Fish really is getting at.
