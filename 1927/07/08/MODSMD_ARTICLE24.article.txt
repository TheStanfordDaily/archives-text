# Library Builder Retires
## 
### 
When Nathan Van Patten, newly appointed director of the Stanford
libraries, arrives on the campus next January, lie will find awaiting him
a library which is nearly perfect in arrangement and in systematized
handling of books. And he will find a selection of hooks which represent
the best in every field.
The Stanford Library, as it is today, is the work of one man more
than any otherâ€”George Thomas Clark, whose retirement as director of
the University libraries has been announced. Mr. Clark assumed his
duties here in 1907. and since that time has helped in the gradual growth
of the library, and its transference from what is now the Administration
building into its present home. The construction and arrangement of the
library is directly due to the work of Director Clark, who spent months
traveling and studying other libraries, in order that their best features
might be used here.
And so. Director Clark, who is retiring from active service after
twenty years of labor for the University, is leaving behind him n. monu
ment of his endeavor. And it is not one which can be easily forgotten.
