Anvone who has attended a lecture and been unable to pay attention
to the speaker on account of the departure one by one of those who
either have suddenly remembered a previous engagement or who have
found the lecture not to be exactly what they wanted, will appreciate an
appeal on this subject. Surely it is a matter of only common courtesy
to remain to the end of the lecture, in order not to disturb the enjoyment
of others. It does not require an overabundance of stoicism to remain
seated for an hour in behalf of those who are profiting from the lecture.
