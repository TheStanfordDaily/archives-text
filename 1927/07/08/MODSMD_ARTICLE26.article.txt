# CIVIL LIBERTIES MAN GIVES TALK HERE ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH
## 
### 
"Until (here is love of free speech
among university faculties and people
in authority we shall have repression,"
declared Professor Harry F. Ward,
chairman of the American Civil Liber
ties Union, in an address before a
sympathetic audience in the Palo Alto
Community House Friday night.
Professor Ward opened his address
by denying charges appearing in the
press that the Civil Liberties Union
■was bolshevistic, and explained that it
was composed of people of widely di
vergent views but united in the de- j
fense of the civil rights of Americans. ,
Frequently they had supported a radi
cal in his fight for free speech, but did j
not necessarily support the opinions j
of radicals.
Emphasizing the importance of the '
fight for free speech, the speaker in- ■
stanced the repression which occurred ;
in some of the industrial towns of the
East where all public buildings and
vacant lots were owned by members
pf corporations who denied the use of
premises to workers for public dis
cussion. Little local officials, too, he
declared, are asserting their power to
prevent expression of opinions not in
accord with their own.
Professor Ward referred to repres
sion in the academic field, and alluded
to the fight which had been waged
against science by the fundamentalists,
whom he termed bootleggers of reli
gion.
Much of the repression of free

speech the speaker attributed to the
after-war laws which many states had
passed and which are open to interpre
tation by judges and can be used to
repress workers.
Such repression of free speech, Pro
fessor Ward said, was setting up in
hibitions to thinking, and making peo
ple fear to speak; thus the discovery
of truth and the achievement of re
forms are being checked.
