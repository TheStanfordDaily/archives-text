# DIEHL EXPLAINS BEAUTIES OF ART AT OLD RAVENNA
## Describes Byzantine Church Of Fifth and Sixth Centuries TELLS OF MOSAIC DESIGNS Shows Slides in Connection With Comments in French 
### 
Byzantine art exemplified by the
rare decorations of mosaic and marble
in the fifth and sixth century churches
of Ravenna, Italy, was the subject of
a lecture Riven in French by Profes
sor Charles Diehl of the University of
Paris Tuesday evening at the Little
Theatre. The lecture was illustrated
with a number of slides.
Accompanying each of the slides
with detailed explanations, Professor
Diehl devoted himself to descriptions
of the two characteristically Byzan
tine Churches, St. Vitale, and St. Apol
linare in Classe, and with the details
of mosaic ornamentation for which
the interiors of the churches are fa
mous, the relation of which lie showed
to the art of Constantinople.
Goes Back to Theodoric
"When anyone thinks of Ravenna,
he thinks of it as the place where
Dante died and was buried, but this
lecture will go back to a period before
Dante—that of the Ostogroths' occupa
tion under Theodoric," he said in be
ginning his lecture.
Portraying the former splendour of
the half-abandoned and ruined city on
the shore of the Adriatic Sea in vivid
and enthusiastic terms Professor Diehl
went from more general statements
to pointing out the development and
background of architecture and art,
especially during the sixth century,
St. Vitale Mosaics
The mosaics in the first church
shown, St. Vitale, were particularly
interesting, he pointed out, because of
the picturization of the development
of the personality of Christ. First
Christ is shown as a comparatively
young man, beardless, and with a
pleasant expression. In the murals de
picting happenings of the latter part
of His life, He is shown as a much
more imposing figure, taller than those
about Him, and possessed of a black
beard.
Professor Diehl called attention to
the fact that Christ was always pic
tured with a regal air, and never as
the suffering and humble figure. He
stands erect and with dignity, and in
the scene showing Him on His way to
Calvary He is attended by a servant.
The most beautiful slides were those
of the great church of St. Apollinare,
which dates from the time of Arch
bishop Maxianus. This church stands
apart from the city in Classe, which
is on the Emilian plains, the lecturer
said, and is especially distinguished
by its great and now tottering Cam
panile, which is of a later date than
the church itself.

and enthusiastic terms Professor Diehl
went from more general statements
to pointing out the development and
background of architecture and art,
especially during the sixth century,
St. Vitale Mosaics
The mosaics in the first church
shown, St. Vitale, were particularly
interesting, he pointed out, because of
the picturization of the development
of the personality of Christ. First
Christ is shown as a comparatively
young man, beardless, and with a
pleasant expression. In the murals de
picting happenings of the latter part
of His life, He is shown as a much
more imposing figure, taller than those
about Him, and possessed of a black
beard.
Professor Diehl called attention to
the fact that Christ was always pic
tured with a regal air, and never as
the suffering and humble figure. He
stands erect and with dignity, and in
the scene showing Him on His way to
Calvary He is attended by a servant.
The most beautiful slides were those
of the great church of St. Apollinare,
which dates from the time of Arch
bishop Maxianus. This church stands
apart from the city in Classe, which
is on the Emilian plains, the lecturer
said, and is especially distinguished
by its great and now tottering Cam
panile, which is of a later date than
the church itself.
Byzantine art exemplified by the
rare decorations of mosaic and marble
in the fifth and sixth century churches
of Ravenna, Italy, was the subject of
a lecture Riven in French by Profes
sor Charles Diehl of the University of
Paris Tuesday evening at the Little
Theatre. The lecture was illustrated
with a number of slides.
Accompanying each of the slides
with detailed explanations, Professor
Diehl devoted himself to descriptions
of the two characteristically Byzan
tine Churches, St. Vitale, and St. Apol
linare in Classe, and with the details
of mosaic ornamentation for which
the interiors of the churches are fa
mous, the relation of which lie showed
to the art of Constantinople.
Goes Back to Theodoric
"When anyone thinks of Ravenna,
he thinks of it as the place where
Dante died and was buried, but this
lecture will go back to a period before
Dante—that of the Ostogroths' occupa
tion under Theodoric," he said in be
ginning his lecture.
