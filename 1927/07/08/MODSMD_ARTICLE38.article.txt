# Will Rebuild at Once On Site of Burned Home
## 
### 
Mr. and Mrs. Charles J. Thomas,
whose home at Menlo Park Heights
was entirely destroyed by fire start
ing in the dried grass near their barn
on July 4, are planning to rebuild on
the same site as soon as possible. The
property was insured for a part of its
value. In the ashes the Thomases are
searching for keys to bank safety de
posit boxes, as well as for any rem
nants of important papers which they
had taken home from these boxes to
arrange over the week-end.
Practically nothing of their property
was saved. The destruction of fine
trees around their house and the loss
of valuable manuscripts and books out
weigh all other damage, in the
Thomases' minds. Mrs. Thomas was
graduated from Stanford in 1910.
