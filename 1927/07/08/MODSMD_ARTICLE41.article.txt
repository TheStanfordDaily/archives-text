# MADAME STEIN GIVES TALK ON MARCEL PROUST
## Finds Author Similar to Balzac as Creator Of Character WAS WRITER OF SOCIETY Books Seem to Rise With Steam From Cups of Fragrant Tea

<
Marcel Proust, leading French novel
ist of the modern school, was classed
with Balzac and Henry James in a lec
ture in French given by Mme. Marie
de Mare Stein in the Little Theatre, j
In the course of her lecture, Mme. j
Stein reviewed the life and career of ;
the writer, and discussed his work and j
its dominating influence on the French
novelists of the present time. She in
terpreted Proust as the novelist of j
"Society," the frequenter of salons, I
the over-civilized, the amateur of psy- j
chology, the portrayer of intricate j
Jives and highly organized personali- j
ties. At intervals she pointed out ways j
which the social, although not hu
manitarian, interest of Proust ex j
presses itself —in his personal charm, i
in the character of his life, and in his j
,work. "Pleasant, expressive, courte
ous," were the adjectives she chose to
describe his.manner.
A Creator of Character
Mme. Stein compared Proust with (
Balzac as a creator of character.
The literary style of Proust is a j
vehi< le heavy enough in itself to carry :
the weight of his reflection. His sen- i
tences are "different, difficult, long; !
he has been compared with Henry
James." But his setting is the artificial i
intercourse of "monde," of what car- j
lies the newspaper heading of "So
ciety." The world liness of Proust has j
caused his novels to be underrated by j
the reading public—and—ironically for 1
anyone acquainted with his involved '
sentences and his exhaustive psychol- j
ogy—to be regarded as light. "All his j
books," said Mme. Stein, "seem to j
rise with the steam out of a teacup, ;
sweetened with the 'Madeleine' !
(French sweet buiscuit) that he has
been (lipping into his cup since his
childhood."
Influenced Others
The first volume of "A la Rocherche
du Temps Perdu" appeared in 1913
under the title of "Du Cot 6 de Chez
Swan", and it was more praised than
read. The second, "A l'Ombre des
Jeunes Filles en Fleur," took the GOll
- prize in 1920. This success was
the beginning of the recent Proust
vogue, and from the general reading
of the prize novel dates the influence j
of Proust on most of the popular j
French novelists of the last ten years: J
Paul Laurent, Jean Giradou, Jean j
Oocteau, and Raymond Radiguet. 1
Proust died in 1922, after less than
ten years of writing, during which !
time he completed no fewer than fif- j
teen volumes, all bearing in some way
on the central theme of the "Re-;
cherche."
