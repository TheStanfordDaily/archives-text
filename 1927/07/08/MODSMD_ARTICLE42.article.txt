# ESPINOSA EXPLAINS NEW SPANISH TESTS IN LECTURE SERIES
## 
### 
| New methods of conducting tests in
I Spanish were explained by Professor
Espinosa Tuesday afternoon in an in
formal talk to Spanish teachers and
S others interested. He cited the fact
that although methods of teaching had
, undergone a complete transformation
j within the last few years, the same
could not be said for the method of
giving examinations. Professor Espi
nosa is attempting to make a new
series of tests in Spanish which shall
be objective. He hopes to be able to
i test by this method whether one year
i of college Spanish is eqlivalent to two
of high school Spanish. Some of the
tests have at times inclined him to
think that the average student knows
nothing about the subject, but he is
casting out these questions on which
they continually fail, as he {eels they
do not really test the average pupil.
Professor Espinosa maintains that a
| test to be good must have validity, re-
I liability, objectivity, be properly
j graded and, above all, be practical.
. By practical it is meant that they will
1 be of such sort that they can be given
| without explanations and corrected
| without too much effort.
The lectures will be continued on
, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3 o'clock
i in Room 242 throughout the quarter.
