newspaper work, and, after establish
ing, at the height of his career, a
school of journalism at Columbia Uni
versity, he provided in his will for a
series of prizes in the interest of let
ters, the drama, music, and good news

standard of good morals, good taste,
and good manners, $1,000/'
The first award was given in 1918
when Jesse Lynch Williams' play,
"Why Marry," won. In 1919, perhaps
owing to the stress of war, no award
was given. In 1920, "Beyond the Hori
zon," by Eugene O'Neil, was the win
ner. Zona Gale's "Miss Lulu Bett" won
in 1921, while Eugene O'Neil was again
fortunate in 1922 with his play, "Anna
Christie." "Icebound," which was pro
duced at Stanford University in the
summer of 1924, won the 1923 award.
"Hell Bent fer Heaven,".by Hatcher
Hughes, which has also been pre
sented at Stanford, won in 1924. Sid
ney Howard's "They Knew What They
Wanted" was the choice in 1925, and
"Craig's Wife," by George Kelly,
which will be produced here tonight,
was the fortunate play in 192 G. "The
Show Off" by George Kelly came very
near being the choice the year before,
as it was tentatively chosen and then
rejected.
The award for this year is Paul
Green's "In Abraham's Bosom."

duced this evening in the auditorium,
