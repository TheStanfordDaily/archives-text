### 
More than a hundred attended the
weekly school men's luncheon yester
day at which it was decided to com
pile a special directory of the men
teachers who are attending the sum
mer quarter. The gathering, the pur
pose of which is to promote fellow
ship among this group, was presided
over by Earle E. Crawford, superin
tendent of Napa city schools.
"We must do something to develop
a philosophy of success in spiritrather
than in material," said Walter Hep
ner, superintendent of Fresno city
schools, in an address at the luncheon.
Because America produces more
wealth per man than any other coun
try she is accused of becoming too
materialistic, the speaker said, and
the question now is: how can we con
serve our spiritual resources? In an
swering this he said:
"We must do more by way of selling
our schools to the people, for the pub
lic school depends upon the willing
ness of the public to support it." In
the past the teacher had been too
much of a faddist, he said, and we
have now approached the age when
Ave must become more scientific within
the classroom.
