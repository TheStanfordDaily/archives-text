# RYAN LABORATORY RECEIVES GIFT OF FINE INSTRUMENTS
## Measuring Devices Worth $13,500 Donated by Westinghouse AID ELECTRICITY WORK Recent Inventions Detect And Record Minute Variations 
### 
Precise measuring instruments
which are the products of the most
recent scientific knowledge and skill
in design and are valued at $13,500
are being received by Stanford Uni
versity for use in the Harris J. Ryan
high voltage laboratory as the result
of a gift by the Westinghouse Elec
tric and Manufacturing Company.
These instruments were much needed
for investigations that Professor Ryan
is conducting, but were beyond the
reach of his budget at this time. They
are being put into use as fast as they
reach the laboratory.
They comprise instruments the
names of which mean nothing to lay
men but which mean much to elec
trical scientists: a 9-element oscillo
graph, two osisos with film holders,
two klydonograplis, and a KVA meter.
The products of extremely recent per
fection, they permit exact and compli
cated measurements that have hither
to been extremely difficult or impos
sible. Stanford is among the very first
to possess some of them.
A Personal Tribute
In the gift, there is involved a good
deal of personal affection for Professor
Ryan as well as additional evidence of
the spirit of the electrical industry to
co-operate with him in the work of ex
perimentation, research, and teaching
that he is carrying on in his immense
laboratory at Stanford.
It came about largely through a re
cent visit of Nathaniel G. Symonds to
i the laboratory while he was on the
campus as a member of the Stanford
| National Board. Symonds is an alum
nus of Stanford and now district super
intendent of the Westinghouse Elec
tric and Manufacturing Company at
Chicago. He got into touch with W. S.
; Rugg, vice-president of the company
at its East Pittsburgh plant, a former
i student of Professor Ryan at Cornell,
i The result was that Professor Ryan
! was invited to go to East Pittsburgh
! and select instruments that he most
j needed for work he has in hand.
May Send Students
As a result of this trip it is possible,
i also, that Professor Ryan may receive
1 some especially qualified students in
his laboratory. While he was in East
Pittsburgh the company officers took
up with him the possibility of having
j particularly promising young men of
i the company's staff who would profit
' by a year or more of work in a uni-
I versity atmosphere come to Stanford
to carry on such work with him in his
laboratory. Professor Ryan assured the
officers that Stanford would welcome
I such men.
The significant feature of a 9-ele
-1 ment oscillograph is that it can accu
| rately record simultaneously minute
1 variations in nine varying currents,
! nine voltage;?', or nine values in power,
! or any combinations of these up to a
1 total of nine.
Makes Minute Measurements
The recording is accomplished
' through photography by a beam of
â€¢ light from a tiny swinging mirror, and
j the instrument can detect and photo

! graph electric vibrations up to 10,000
| a second. The Ryan laboratory is one
of the first to be able to employ this i
i highly refined recent invention.
An osiso is a portable and simple
| oscillograph, bearing the same rela
tion to the mor,e complicated instru
ment that a little hand camera does
I to an elaborate studio camera.
The klydnographs record the amount j

of harmful electrical discharges on
power lines, leaving permanent rec
| ords that can be interpreted and thus
form a basis of work in eliminating
these predatory attacks.
The KVA meter is used to measure
; and record the aggregate of what sci
entists know as "real power" and "re
active power," combining the two si
multaneously for record.
