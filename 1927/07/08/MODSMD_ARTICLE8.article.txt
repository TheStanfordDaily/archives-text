# RYAN LABORATORY RECEIVES GIFT OF FINE INSTRUMENTS
## Measuring Devices Worth $13,500 Donated by Westinghouse AID ELECTRICITY WORK Recent Inventions Detect And Record Minute Variations 
### 
Precise measuring instruments
which are the products of the most
recent scientific knowledge and skill
in design and are valued at $13,500
are being received by Stanford Uni
versity for use in the Harris J. Ryan
high voltage laboratory as the result
of a gift by the Westinghouse Elec
tric and Manufacturing Company.
These instruments were much needed
for investigations that Professor Ryan
is conducting, but were beyond the
reach of his budget at this time. They
are being put into use as fast as they
reach the laboratory.
They comprise instruments the
names of which mean nothing to lay
men but which mean much to elec
trical scientists: a 9-element oscillo
graph, two osisos with film holders,
two klydonograplis, and a KVA meter.
The products of extremely recent per
fection, they permit exact and compli
cated measurements that have hither
to been extremely difficult or impos
sible. Stanford is among the very first
to possess some of them.
A Personal Tribute
In the gift, there is involved a good
deal of personal affection for Professor
Ryan as well as additional evidence of
the spirit of the electrical industry to
co-operate with him in the work of ex
perimentation, research, and teaching
that he is carrying on in his immense
laboratory at Stanford.
It came about largely through a re
cent visit of Nathaniel G. Symonds to
