Members of the English Review
Club, an organization for graduate
English students and members of the
English faculty, will hold their first
summer meeting at the home of Dr.
Margery Bailey, 723 Hamilton Ave.,
Palo Alto, Monday evening at 7:30.
The club is a semi-social organiza
tion which aims to familiarize graduate
students in English with the scholarly
journals in their lield. The programs
are designed to help the student and
teacher of English. Reviews of current
articles in magazines are given by the
students and then discussed by the
club. This has proved-most valuable
in pointing out to busy students arti
cles of special significance in material
or in treatment.
All graduate English students and
members of the English faculty or any
others that are interested are invited
to attend Monday's meeting.
