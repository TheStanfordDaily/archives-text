# FINE PRODUCTION OF “CRAIG’S WIFE” GOES OVER WELL
## Dorothea Wilson Dominates Action With Smooth, Capable Acting AUDIENCE IS ATTENTIVE Set Is Nearly Perfect in Atmosphere of Play; Lights Well Done 
### Back Row 
"Craig's Wife," presented Friday
night in the Assembly Hall, proved to
be another tribute to the directing of
Gordon Davis. Aided by an excellent
play, an experienced cast, and a recep
tive audience, Davis succeeded in
scoring a distinct hit.
The play itself, written by George
Kelly, and winner of the Pulitzer prize
as the best American play of the 1926
season, was cleverly put together. Al
though built around a domestic tra
gedy, it fortunately avoided the stereo
typed "eternal-triangle" situation.
Mrs. Craig Dominates
The plot was ,built around Mrs.
Craig, a selfish and dominant woman,
who seeks to utterly rule her world.
Secretly realizing her own shortcom
ings, she seeks to bound that world
by her own house, and exclude every
one else, even to her husband. Through
a series of circumstances, the young
husband becomes aware of her inten
tions, and leaves, as do the other rela
tives. The crowning blow comes to her
by a telegram, announcing the death
of a sister, whom she has deserted to
return to her house.
As Mrs. Craig, the dominant figure
in the show, Dorothea Wilson, gave a
remarkable performance. Her smooth
ness and poise made the character a i
convincingly natural one.
Brownson Stars
Harold Brownson was more than
adequate in the role of Craig, the
finally bitterly disillusioned husband.
Despite a tendency at times toward
being mechanical in his movements,
he rose to splendid heights in the sec
ond act.
The comedy relief role, that of Mrs.;
Harold, the housekeeper, was played
by Marcella Kartheiser, With a natur- !
alness which spoke of considerable
experience, she was able to extract j
the maximum amount from her part, j
Roberta Douthart, playing opposite I
her as the maid, was not so convinc- ■
ing.

neighbor, Jeannette Elliott and Martha j
Montgomery were exceedingly well !
cast. Miss Elliott's role was extremely 1
difficult, as she had to deliver some
of the most dramatic lines of the show
without the use of gesture or motion, j
Others in Cast
Barbara Lansburgh as Ethel Land- [
reth, Mrs. Craig's niece, Russell An- ,
drews as her fiance, Lowell Roehr as
Billy Birkmire, Craig's friend, Frank
Baker as Catelle, the detective, and
Byron Snow, as his assistant, all han- j
died their parts capably and well. And
Eliot Jones, Jr., delivered his two lines j
from off-stage with all the gusto of an
old trouper.
The play was unique in that only 1
one set was used for the three acts. It
was cleverly designed and executed by
Leslie Kiler and the Theatre Work- j
shop class. The lighting was good in
that it was entirely inobtrusive.

one set was used for the three acts. It
was cleverly designed and executed by
Leslie Kiler and the Theatre Work- j
shop class. The lighting was good in
that it was entirely inobtrusive.
"Craig's Wife," presented Friday
night in the Assembly Hall, proved to
be another tribute to the directing of
Gordon Davis. Aided by an excellent
play, an experienced cast, and a recep
tive audience, Davis succeeded in
scoring a distinct hit.
The play itself, written by George
Kelly, and winner of the Pulitzer prize
as the best American play of the 1926
season, was cleverly put together. Al
though built around a domestic tra
gedy, it fortunately avoided the stereo
typed "eternal-triangle" situation.
Mrs. Craig Dominates
The plot was ,built around Mrs.
Craig, a selfish and dominant woman,
who seeks to utterly rule her world.
Secretly realizing her own shortcom
ings, she seeks to bound that world
by her own house, and exclude every
one else, even to her husband. Through
a series of circumstances, the young
husband becomes aware of her inten
tions, and leaves, as do the other rela
tives. The crowning blow comes to her
by a telegram, announcing the death
of a sister, whom she has deserted to
return to her house.
As Mrs. Craig, the dominant figure
in the show, Dorothea Wilson, gave a
remarkable performance. Her smooth
ness and poise made the character a i
convincingly natural one.
Brownson Stars
Harold Brownson was more than
adequate in the role of Craig, the
finally bitterly disillusioned husband.
Despite a tendency at times toward
being mechanical in his movements,
he rose to splendid heights in the sec
ond act.
The comedy relief role, that of Mrs.;
Harold, the housekeeper, was played
by Marcella Kartheiser, With a natur- !
alness which spoke of considerable
experience, she was able to extract j
the maximum amount from her part, j
Roberta Douthart, playing opposite I
her as the maid, was not so convinc- ■
ing.

Mrs. Frazier, the talkative but nice
neighbor, Jeannette Elliott and Martha j
Montgomery were exceedingly well !
cast. Miss Elliott's role was extremely 1
difficult, as she had to deliver some
of the most dramatic lines of the show
without the use of gesture or motion, j
Others in Cast
Barbara Lansburgh as Ethel Land- [

Billy Birkmire, Craig's friend, Frank
Baker as Catelle, the detective, and
Byron Snow, as his assistant, all han- j

from off-stage with all the gusto of an
old trouper.
