## 
### 
Idealism, honesty, and purity were
given as the characteristic traits of
the music of Johannes Brahma, at the
Memorial Church, Thursday, when
Warren D. Allen gave his third lecture
recital.
"The music of Brahms is the purest
music from small bits of musical
thought. — music at
that," Mr. Allen said. "Brahms is as
long-breathed as Grieg is short
breathed, and this conscistent length
(if phrase gives an impression of re
poseful continuity and serenity," he
continued. Mr. Allen illustrated from
the Sonata in F Minor, which he called
"'The real 'Moonlight Sonata'."
Mrs. Allen sang three songs: "Sap
phic Ode," "Wiee bist du meine Koni
gin," and "Meine Liebe ist Griin." They
express Brahms at his simplest and
sweetest, it was said.
Mr. Allen introduced his audience to
the later work of Brahms through the
Intermezzo in C Major and the Rhap
sody in G Minor, the second of which
is an interpretation of the composer's
belief in impassive fate.
Mrs. Allen closed the program with
three more songs.
