# Dr. Dixon Explains Way Plants React to Stimuli
## 
### 
Do plants have nerves? Dr. H. H.
Dixon answered that question yester
day in his lecture at the Little Theatre.
Plants do not have nerves, but they
have a flow within that makes them
respond to external stimuli.
Dr. Dixon used pictures and dia
grams to illustrate his lecture. Some
beautiful pictures of the Mimosa plant
that curls up at a slight change in the
environment illustrated his main argu
ment.
The audience was large for a tech
nical lecture. Dr. Dixon left immedi
ately for Berkeley to resume his duties
there.
