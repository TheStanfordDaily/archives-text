# WORK STARTED TO ADD 14 ROWS TO TOP OF STADIUM
## Improvement to Increase Capacity by 16,500 Seats STEAM SHOVEL ACTIVE Excavates for New Arcade; Will Leave End Open 
### 
Construction work has begun on the
addition of fourteen rows of seats to
the top of the stadium. This will in
crease the capacity of the stadium
some 1(3,500 seats, making a sum-total
of about SS.OOO.
The open end of the bowl which is
used for the straight stretch of the
two hundred and twenty yard dash is
not to be closed. The new addition is
to be in the form of an arcade pro
jecting over the pathway at the top
of the bowl and is to be finished on
the outside in cement gunnite. It will
somewhat resemble the Memorial Sta
dium of the University of California.
The shrubbery on the top edge has
already been cut out and a steam
shovel is at work excavating a level
for the foundation of the arcade pro
jection. Immense poles, which can
now be seen lying about the stadium,
are to be driven into the slanting sur
face on the outside of the bowl for
supports.
The contracted price for the exten
sive construction has been placed at
$160,000 which will include six new
lavatory buildings around the stadium.
These will also be of a cement gunnite
finish.
