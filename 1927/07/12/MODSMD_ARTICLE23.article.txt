# DR. BROWN OF YALE PREACHES SERMON AT MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
Paternalism in industry, education,
and religion is a poor policy, according
to the Rev. Charles R. Brown of the
Yale Divinity School in a sermon at
the Memorial Church Sunday.
"If any person asks me whether I
am my brother's keeper, I shall tell
him I am not." he said. "I don't want
to be any person's keeper. I am not
my brother's keeper but my brother's
brother, and my task is to treat him as
if he were my brother and not as
somebody who is in my keep."
The speaker attacked the policy
of holding out wages to spend the
money on improving the "condition"
of working men. "Recreation work and
clubrooms in industry may be all right
but the workers would rather have the
money invested added to his own pay
check in order that he may spend it
as he pleases," he declared.
He approved of the modern tendency
of giving the college student a larger
share in the ordering of college life.
While he said that the faculty member
was an older and more experienced
colleague rather than a keeper, he
mentioned that there occasionally are
times when college students had to be
taken to task by administration au
thorities.
The fact that all men are brothers
does not mean that they should all
receive the same compensation be
cause they vary as to ability and as to
previous preparation. The man who
does highly difficult work requiring
big responsibility should receive a re
ward commensurate with the nature of
the duties, he declared.
Nations can get along better if they
try to be brothers and not keepers, he
said.
