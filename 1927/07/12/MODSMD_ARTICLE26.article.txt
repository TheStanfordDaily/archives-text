After final adoption of plans, construction began yesterday to provide
for the 16,500 seats which are to he added to the stadium. I his move
has been considered for some time, since temporary bleachers had to be
erected to aid in seating the crowd at the last Big Game held here.
Since work started we have heard a number of complaints to the
effect that the addition was a mistake. In the first place, said the dis
satisfied, it would spoil the beauty of the stadium. Moreover, it wouldn t
be a drop in the bucket toward filling the demand for tickets to the Dig
Game.
To answer the last argument first, it seems as though a certain obliga
tion is owed our alumni. They have every conceivable right in the world
to attend the football games. If, by the addition of several thousand
seats, more of them can be accommodated, by all means let it be done.
And as to the beauty of the stadium, it appears that the addition will
really aid it in appearance. The new arcade which is to be put along the
top, in white concrete work, will only add to the imposing dignity of
the structure, especially as viewed from without.
Anyway, work has already been started, and from every indication
will be rushed to completion.
