Professor Daniel C. Knowlton's advocacy of supplementary classroom
lectures with films is well founded. A graphic visualization of any subject
is always more easily grasped than the same subject presented through a
lecture, sometimes with little life, or through the printed paper alone.

will give too much opportunity for making up lost sleep.
