Construction work on the new Aero
nautics Laboratory is now very near
completion, according to Dr. W. F.
Durand, who has been acting in an
advisory capacity in equipping the
labbratory and selecting the faculty
for this new division of the school of
engineering. Some details of the in
stallation of the wind tunnel and the
machines connected with it remain to
be finished.
The main parts of the apparatus
used in the old laboratory have been
transferred to the new building, but
the wind tunnel is entirely new, em
bodying several improvements, and
much new equipment has been added.
Classes in aeronautics will begin
work on the machine in the autumn
quarter, and, in addition, experimental
work will be carried on in various
problems connected with airplane de
sign and performance.
