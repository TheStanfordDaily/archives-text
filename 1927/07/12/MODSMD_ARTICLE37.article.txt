## 
### 
Among the half-dozen most recently
published of the 350 books placed on
display in Room 300 by the MacMillan
Co., the first publishing company to
install its exhibit in Room 300 last
Saturday, was "The School Board
Member" by Professor John C. Almack
of the School of Education.
"Most of the literature of school ad
ministration stresses the executive
side . . . ," writes Professor Almack.
It is his purpose in this book to em
phasize the duties and responsibilities
not of the school principals and super
intendents, hut of the school board
members, of whom he says: ". . . They
(the schools) have been managed
since their inception by boards of edu
cation. The office of director is an ex
tremely important one. School boards
control an immense business and so
cial enterprise."
