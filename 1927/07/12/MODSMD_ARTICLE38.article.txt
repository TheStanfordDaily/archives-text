# Writes Book Attacking Fundamentalistâ€™s Theory
## 
### 
H. Maynard Shipley, who attended
Stanford 1900-04, has published a book
recently entitled "War on Modern Sci
ence." Mr. Shipley, who is president of
the Science League of America, has
been a conspicuous and bitter foe of
fundamentalists for many years.
"His book is in the spirit of polemics
and journalism, but it has the virtue
of preserving between the covers of
a printed book, facts which would
otherwise be lost to posterity," said
Rabbi Louis Newman of San Fran
cisco, in reviewing Shipley's work.
Mr. Shipley has been a writer and
lecturer on natural science for several
years and at one time was editor of
"The World," Oakland newspaper.
