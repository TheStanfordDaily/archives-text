# Boysâ€™ Swimming Class Divided Into Two Sections
## 
### 
On account of the large number of
entries, the swimming class for hoys
from six to fourteen has been divided
into two sections. One class is now
meeting from 9 to 10 o'clock on Tues
days, Thursdays, and Saturdays for
hoys from six to fourteen who are
unable to swim. The second class
meets from 10 to 11 o'clock on the
same days and includes boys who
know the fundamentals of swimming
and who are meeting in the class for
further instruction.
About fifteen boys, all of whom are
sons of members of faculty, alumni, or
others connected with the University,
are enrolled in each class. Charles M.
Sprague is directing.
