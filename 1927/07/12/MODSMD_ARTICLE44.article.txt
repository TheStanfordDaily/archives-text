# STANFORD MEN MAKE GOOD SIM AT R.O.TC C.CAMP
## Win Barracks Inspection Nearly Every Day So Far STUDENTS HONOR VIRAG Elected to Head Temporary Chapter of Scabbard And Blade 
### 
"You must use no profanity while
at this camp. Just the healthiest pos
sible 'damn' is as far as you can go,"
said Major G. A. Sanford, Executive
Officer, at the Monterey R.O.T.C. camp
in his first address to the students
assembled there from Stanford, Ore
gon Agricultural College, Culver Mili
tary Institute, the University of Cali
fornia (Berkeley and Los Angeles),
Nevada, Oregon, Missouri, Oklahoma,
and Ohio, and the California Institute
of Technology and Pomona College.
• "You only as you would at
home," added Major Sanford to empha
size his previous statement.
Because they wished to make ap
parent that soldiering was having no
degenerating effect on their morals,
the twenty-nine Stanford students in
Battery "C" at the Monterey Presidio
R.O.T.C. wished to make known the
attitude of their commandant as stated
above.
Other Stanford Men Attend
In addition to the Stanford men in
the R.O.T.C. at Monterey, there are
also three others in the Citizens' Mili
tary Training Camp located there.
Chauncey O. Thompson, who has re
recently received his commission, is
serving as a second-lieutenant at the
C.M.T.C., Lawrence Lash, as sergeant,
and Harold Hjelm, who graduated at
Stanford in 1925, as first-lieutenant.
During the two-week drill of the
Officers' Reserve Corps last month,
Norman Cleaveland, '23, and Dudley S.
DeGroot, '24, former Stanford football
stars, were also in attendance at the
Monterey Presidio.
Captain M. W. Pettigrew and Lieu
tenant C. S. Whitmore, who are ordi
narily detailed for duty in the campus
military department, are at present
the officers who are in charge of the
R.O.T.C. artillery students at Mon
terey. In addition to the twenty-nine
artillery students from Stanford, there
is one each from Culver Military In
stitute and the University of Missouri.
Battery "C," which includes twelve
California Institute of Technology
prospective engineering officers, in ad
dition to those from Stanford, Culver,
and Missouri, has won the barracks
inspection every day so far except
twice.
Virag Honored
When a temporary chapter of Scab
bard and Blade, military honorary so
ciety, was formed at Monterey last
week, Alfred Virag of Stanford was
chosen as its captain. There are
R.O.T.C. students from most of the
colleges and universities of the Pacific
Coast and from a few Eastern insti
tutions, from among whom Virag was
selected.
Although several Stanford men re
marked feelingly, "They sure work us
here," they wished to say that con
trary to popular opinion, they received
good food to sustain them through
iheir hard labor. Also, they have the
opportunity to enjoy various recrea
tional activities after their day's work
is done. Band concerts are given twice
a week by the regular post Cavalry
band, while music for dances may be
furnished by members of the R.O.T.C.
who are musically inclined. Swim
ming may be done at the Del Monte
plunge or in the ocean at Pacific
Grove, the latter only when supervised

parties are organized, while golf may
be played at the Del Monte or Pebble
Beach courses, and tennis, at the Mon
terey Post court, or those of the Del
Monte Hotel. Boxing, volley ball, and
indoor baseball are other sports in
which R.O.T.C. men may indulge dur
ing leisure hours.
Have Early Hours
Although they are compelled to rise
at 5:30 every morning except Sunday,
the embryo officers have actual drill
only approximately seven hours per
day. Following assembly for Retreat
at 5:10 each evening, they are at lib
erty to spend their time as they wish
until 11 o'clock when Taps ends their
day.
Calculation of firing data, driving
draught, and participation in mounted
reconnaisance trips has constituted
the larger part of the R.O.T.C. artil
lery work thus far. During July 19-23
each of the men will be given oppor
tunity to direct firing on the range at
Gigling. The regular enlisted men at
the Monterey garrison will be placed
in their charge. Since the duration of
the camp is six weeks, the R.O.T.C.

' will remain at Monterey until the end
| of this month.

tary Training Camp located there.
Chauncey O. Thompson, who has re
recently received his commission, is
serving as a second-lieutenant at the
C.M.T.C., Lawrence Lash, as sergeant,
and Harold Hjelm, who graduated at
Stanford in 1925, as first-lieutenant.
During the two-week drill of the
Officers' Reserve Corps last month,
Norman Cleaveland, '23, and Dudley S.
DeGroot, '24, former Stanford football
stars, were also in attendance at the
Monterey Presidio.
Captain M. W. Pettigrew and Lieu
tenant C. S. Whitmore, who are ordi
narily detailed for duty in the campus
military department, are at present
the officers who are in charge of the
R.O.T.C. artillery students at Mon
terey. In addition to the twenty-nine
artillery students from Stanford, there
is one each from Culver Military In
stitute and the University of Missouri.
Battery "C," which includes twelve
California Institute of Technology
prospective engineering officers, in ad
dition to those from Stanford, Culver,
and Missouri, has won the barracks
inspection every day so far except
twice.
Virag Honored
When a temporary chapter of Scab
bard and Blade, military honorary so
ciety, was formed at Monterey last
week, Alfred Virag of Stanford was
chosen as its captain. There are
R.O.T.C. students from most of the
colleges and universities of the Pacific
Coast and from a few Eastern insti
tutions, from among whom Virag was
selected.
Although several Stanford men re
marked feelingly, "They sure work us
here," they wished to say that con
trary to popular opinion, they received
good food to sustain them through
iheir hard labor. Also, they have the
opportunity to enjoy various recrea
tional activities after their day's work
is done. Band concerts are given twice
a week by the regular post Cavalry
band, while music for dances may be
furnished by members of the R.O.T.C.
who are musically inclined. Swim
ming may be done at the Del Monte
plunge or in the ocean at Pacific
Grove, the latter only when supervised

parties are organized, while golf may
be played at the Del Monte or Pebble
Beach courses, and tennis, at the Mon
terey Post court, or those of the Del
Monte Hotel. Boxing, volley ball, and
indoor baseball are other sports in
which R.O.T.C. men may indulge dur
ing leisure hours.
Have Early Hours
Although they are compelled to rise
at 5:30 every morning except Sunday,
the embryo officers have actual drill
only approximately seven hours per
day. Following assembly for Retreat
at 5:10 each evening, they are at lib
erty to spend their time as they wish
until 11 o'clock when Taps ends their
day.
Calculation of firing data, driving
draught, and participation in mounted
reconnaisance trips has constituted
the larger part of the R.O.T.C. artil
lery work thus far. During July 19-23
each of the men will be given oppor
tunity to direct firing on the range at
Gigling. The regular enlisted men at
the Monterey garrison will be placed
in their charge. Since the duration of
the camp is six weeks, the R.O.T.C.

' will remain at Monterey until the end
| of this month.

inspection every day so far except
twice.
Virag Honored
When a temporary chapter of Scab
bard and Blade, military honorary so
ciety, was formed at Monterey last
week, Alfred Virag of Stanford was
chosen as its captain. There are
R.O.T.C. students from most of the
colleges and universities of the Pacific
Coast and from a few Eastern insti
tutions, from among whom Virag was
selected.
Although several Stanford men re
marked feelingly, "They sure work us
here," they wished to say that con
trary to popular opinion, they received
good food to sustain them through
iheir hard labor. Also, they have the
opportunity to enjoy various recrea
tional activities after their day's work
is done. Band concerts are given twice
a week by the regular post Cavalry
band, while music for dances may be
furnished by members of the R.O.T.C.
who are musically inclined. Swim
ming may be done at the Del Monte
plunge or in the ocean at Pacific
Grove, the latter only when supervised

parties are organized, while golf may
be played at the Del Monte or Pebble
Beach courses, and tennis, at the Mon
terey Post court, or those of the Del
Monte Hotel. Boxing, volley ball, and
indoor baseball are other sports in
which R.O.T.C. men may indulge dur
ing leisure hours.
Have Early Hours
Although they are compelled to rise
at 5:30 every morning except Sunday,
the embryo officers have actual drill
only approximately seven hours per
day. Following assembly for Retreat
at 5:10 each evening, they are at lib
erty to spend their time as they wish
until 11 o'clock when Taps ends their
day.
Calculation of firing data, driving
draught, and participation in mounted
reconnaisance trips has constituted
the larger part of the R.O.T.C. artil
lery work thus far. During July 19-23
each of the men will be given oppor
tunity to direct firing on the range at
Gigling. The regular enlisted men at
the Monterey garrison will be placed
in their charge. Since the duration of
the camp is six weeks, the R.O.T.C.

' will remain at Monterey until the end
| of this month.
