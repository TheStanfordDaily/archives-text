# SPORTS OF 1927
## No Anti-Climaxes 
### BY “FEG MURRAY, ’16 
Rival pitchers used to heave a sigh
of relief when they had finished the
job of throwing them up to Babe
Ruth, but now things are different. No
matter what the Big Bam did —strike
out, pop out, get on base, or hit a
homer —it was a great weight off the
hurler's mind when the King of Swat
had been to bat and gone on his way.
But now all this has changed. The
King is merely the third name in the
batting order, the "hollow shell" who
sometimes explodes with a tremendous
bang and breaks up everything, in
cluding ball games. But after the King
comes —Lou Gehrig!
As this is written, Lou Gehrig is
walloping the pill at more than a .400
clip, and what is more important to
the Yankees, has batted in nearly half
of his team's runs. The former Colum
bia football star, who, by the way,
never wears a hat or a vest, has not
only been outbatting Ruth, but he has
been for some time one of the five
leading hitters in the American
League. Gehrig, of German descent
and built like a young Hercules, is not

yet twenty-four, and, barring acci
dents, should go on busting homers
and batting in runs for ten or fifteen
years. He is one example of a player
making good with the ball club of his
native city.
But to return to the aforementioned
enemy pitcher. After he has disposed
of both Babe Ruth and "Babe Ruth"
Gehrig (as he was called at Columbia
in his undergraduate days) what then?
Does he have a moment or so of rest,
taking things easy with the next bat
ter? He does not, and Bob Meusel is
right there to tell him why. For long,
lanky, handsome Bob, of the California
Meusels, is playing every game as
though each day he must make
amends for that costly muff in the
last game of the 1926 world series.
Robert is batting not far below Lou as
this is written, and having tired of
being referred to as "lethargic," he
actually up and stole home in a game
in Chicago recently.
First Combs, then Koenig, then
Ruth, then Gehrig, then Meusel. then
Lazzeri —pity the poor pitchers who
have to face those six-inch ribes!
