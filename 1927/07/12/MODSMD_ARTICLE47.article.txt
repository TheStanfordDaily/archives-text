# KNOWLTON DISCUSSES MOTION PICTURES AS AID IN CLASSROOM
## Yale Man Shows Use of Cinema for Teaching Of History 
### 
Motion pictures can be used in place
of textbooks or as supplementary ma
terial in the classroom, Professor
Daniel C. Knowlton, of Yale Univer
sity, said in a lecture at the Little
Theatre last Friday. His illustrative
material was "The Declaration of In
dependence." The keynote of the lec
ture and illustration was the neces
sity for unanimity between all mem
bers of Congress in the colonists'
separation from England.
Reel Showed Much
The reel showed the troublous times
previous to the colonists' break with
England, the heated arguments on
both sides, the dissension among the
rebellion leaders, and that entertain
ments became political arenas.
The whole story of the leaders and
the relation of the common man, the
masses, to the action taken by the
colonies was portrayed. The minuet
showed the French veneer of the
times, the intensity of feeling among
the colonists was vividly presented.
Details Authentic
Dr. Knowlton said that the pictures
were authentic to details, even to the
mannerisms in wearing clothing.
Washington's letter in regard to mo
bilizing the colonies was shown in
facsimile; Jefferson's draft of the
Declaration of Independence was re
prod need.
Dr. Knowlton emphasized through
out his lecture that motion pictures
save time and energy for the child in
getting his impressions of life. They
lit in with other educational agencies
in methods and objective of socializa
tion.
