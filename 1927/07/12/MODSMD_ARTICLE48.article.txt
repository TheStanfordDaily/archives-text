# Cardinal Tennis Stars Lose at Philadelphia
## 
### 
Stanford's hopes for a tennis cham
pionship were shuttered last week,
when both representatives were elimi
nated from the Middle States Tourna
ment at Philadelphia.
Cranston Holman was defeated by
Manuel Alonso, former Davis Cup
star, in the singles finals by scores of
7-5, 3-6, 6-3, and 6-2. In the doubles
finals, Holman and Lionel Ogden lost
to John Van Ryu and Kenneth Appel,
Princeton, 6-1, 9-7, 6-4. The Princeton
pair are the Intercollegiate doubles
champions.
