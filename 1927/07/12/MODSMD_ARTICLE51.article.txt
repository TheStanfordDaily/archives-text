# PROFESSOR FISH SUGGESTS LICENSES FOR HISTORIANS WHO WOULD WRITE BOOKS
## 
### 
"I think that it would be very well
to require all historians to be licensed,
for I consider the recording of history
to be as much a profession as that of
law, medicine, or engineering," said
Professor Carl R, Fish, of Wisconsin.
This remark was made in reference to

j the recent wave of attacks on the
i characters of great American states-
I men.
Professor Fish, who is an interna
tionally known figure, and now a visit
- ing professor at Stanford, holds the
; chair of American History at Wiscon-
J sin. He was educated at Brown and
: Harvard, taking his Ph.D. at Harvard
in 1900. Since that time he has been
with the University of Wisconsin. He
i has written a number of books, all of
which enjoy an international reputa
tion of wide range. The subjects he
! dealt with are: Civil Service and Pat
ronage, 1904; American Diplomacy,
i 1914; Development of American Na
| i ionality, 1912; High School Text —
; History of America, 1926.
Service in London
During the war, in 1918-19, Professor
Fish was director of the American
! University Union, of London. It was
' for university men in the army, but
i at the end of the war it was converted
\ into a permanent office. The Union is
I now used as a source for obtaining in-
I formation concerning the standing of
1 the colleges of applicants for entrance
| into British universities from Amer
i ica, and vice versa. The Union also
j obtains all records of, and data con
: cerning the students themselves. Pro
fessor Fish was in charge of the
i change to this phase of operation. He
has given public lectures on the sub
j jects of diplomacy and biography ex
-1 tensively throughout the United States
j and England.
Professor Fish's particular field is
j that of the Civil War and Reconstruc

tion. He is at present giving his time
to a work of that title. He is using the
Civil War as a study in the causes,
methods, and results of war. In an in- j
cidental way, lie is making a compari
son of the late World War with the
Civil War in these respects. In addi
tion to this work, he has one at the
publisher's, entitled "American Civili
zation in the Thirties and Forties."
Misinterpret Facts
When asked his opinion of the pres
ent wave of popular "best sellers" be
littling the reputations of some of our I
great statesmen, he replied that there j
are very few good biographies of i
American statesmen. "Many of them J
are presented as demi-gods," Professor
Fish said, "and much or all that is 1
common in their lives is omitted by
the biographers. It is true that many 1
of the statements made by the 'popu-1
lar' writers are facts, but they are '
misinterpreted."
A case in point is "The Life of I
Washington," by Rupert Hughes. |
Through this misinterpretation, the
whole book becomes a scandalous at- j
tack on Washington. For instance: j
Hughes says that Washington had a i
private still, and he did; therefore he !
is classed with the common law
breaker of the present day. The fact j
is, that this does not necessarily re- I
fleet against Washington because in j
that day it was perfectly proper to i
have liquor—it was socially correct, !
to be exact. But Professor Fish pointed
out that Washington was the kiftd of j
man who, if it had been against the j
law, would not have had the still.
"That is," he says, "where Mr. !
Hughes was in error." It is in similar !
ways that other writers err: they l
fail to take into consideration the vast ;
differences in social usage between |
this time and that with which they
are dealing.
"These men are not trained his- j
torians," said Professor Fish, "and j
would not know how to tell the exact!
truth if they were so inclined."
