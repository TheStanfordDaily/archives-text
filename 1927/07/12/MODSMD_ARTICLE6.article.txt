Madame Marie de Mare Stein will
give two lectures this week, one this
evening and one Wednesday after
noon.
Mme. Stein will lecture in English
011 Women of Modern France this eve
ning at 8 o'clock in the Little Theatre.
Madame Stein will discuss the ques
tion whether the French women exer
cise the same influence over thought
and civilization today as they did in
the seventeenth and eighteenth cen
turies.
"French Drama of Today" will be
the subject of the last of this quarter's
series of lectures by Mme. Stein. She
will speak in the Little Theatre at
4:30 on Wednesday afternoon, and in
French. This will be not only the last
lecture of the series, but also the last
opportunity for Stanford to hear Mme.
Stein, since her two years' residence
in Palo Alto will come to an end this
week. She plans to sail on the seven
teenth of August for France, where
she will spend two months renewing
literary acquaintances, to return in
October for a lecture tour of the East
ern States, after which she will make
her home in New York.
Her lecture will comprise the evo
lution of the French stage from the
opening of the Free Theatre of Andr6
Antoine—the theatre of Eugene Brieux,
Francois de Curel, and Henrie Barn
stein —to the consummation of the
"super-realistic" tragedy of H. It. Le
normand and the peculiarly French de
velopment of "Unanisme" by the
school of Jules Romains.
She will discuss six schools of dra
matists, the "Realistic" school of the
Free Theatre, the "Traditional" school
of Sacha Guitry, author of "Mozart,"
the "Mystic" school of Paul Claudel
and Henri GliSon, the "Romantic"
school of Paul Raynal, Marie LenSru,
and the younger playwrights, Jean
Bernard and Jean Sarment, the "Super
realistic" school of H. 11. Lenormand,
and "Unanisme," of which Jules Ro
mains, author of the popular comedy,
"Knock!," is the best exponent.
Mme. Stein will touch on "La
Prisonniere" (The Captive), Baudet's
"super-realistic" tragedy on which
New York dropped a final curtain of
censorship.
