# SEVENTY-TWO VISIT LICK OBSERVATORY ON MOUNT HAMILTON
## Gaze at Mountains of Moon, Gain Excellent View Of Saturn 
### 
Lick Observatory proved a strong
drawing card for patrons of the weekly
tours arranged for summer quarter
visitors. Seventy-two people made the
Mount Hamilton trip on Saturday,
leaving Stanford Union at 4:30', and
returning about 12:30.
The caravan of cars followed the
highway to San Jose, and then up the
mountain road to the summit.
Weather conditions were particu
larly favorable on Saturday for view
ing the scenery from the top of the
mountain, and also for observation
through the telescopes. The 30-incli
telescope was trained on the moon,
and the visitors had a splendid oppor
tunity to observe the craters and
mountains of the moon. The smaller
telescope afforded an excellent view
of Saturn, with its characteristic
rings.
Two other features of the trip were
the cloud-colored sunset visible from
the summit, and the lights of San Jose.
