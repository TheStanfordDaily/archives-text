"Have a cigarette?"
After the writer was comfortably
.seated, Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn
pointed to a package of cigarettes on
the table and invited him to smoke
before proceeding with the interview.
This little incident is significant be
cause it makes apparent that Dr.
Meiklejohn attempts to bridge with
familiarity the invisible gulf that fre
quently exists between professors and
students as a result of the lecture sys
tem which places often hundreds of
young men and women into the pres
ence of a professor who is to teach
them but who knows none of them in
dividually.
Will Live Together
Next autumn Dr. Meiklejohn will
inaugurate at the University of Wis
consin a new method of teaching fresh
men and later sophomore students.
The 120 men who will enroll in this
experimental college will live together
with the twelve professors w r ho will
instruct them, in a dormitory which
has been recently constructed at the
University of Wisconsin.
Instead of choosing the subjects
which they will take for the ensuing
year according to the elective system,
all of these men will study the same
seneral subject, which has been tenta
tively fixed as Greek Civilization in all
of its various aspects to be taught
j during the freshman year. No classes
j will be held in the ordinary sense of
I the word, but each group of ten men
1 will meet with a certain professor for
I frequent discussions of common prob
j lems. Also it is probable that the en
, tire class of 120 students will gather
j quite often for discussions.
j The faculty will devote approximate
| ly two-thirds of its time to the new
j college and will probably give one
j course each in the regular curriculum
! of the university. During the sopho
j more year of the class matriculating
lat Dr. Meiklejohn's college next fall,
I"a nineteenth century civilization prob
| ably the English or American during
; the industrial expansion period will
!be studied."
A Middle Age civilization may be
| taken up before one of the nineteenth
! century is studied, but Dr. Meiklejolin
states that "the courses of study as
j well as the details of instruction will
not be definitely determined until the
faculty assembles in the fall."
"What is 'civilization' as you would
j define it for the purposes in which
you will employ it in your proposed
j course of study?" seemed a logical
question to ask.
! "Civilizaton means the complex of
j arrangements built up by a group of
| ' • _____

people in their inner and outer rela
tions," answered Dr. Meiklejohn.
To prevent the possibility of having
preferred against him the charge of
self-contradiction at a future time, he
added, "I may not define it that way
again, but for the moment that seems
to be an adequate definition. It in
cludes their beliefs, cares, interests;
| it comprehends everything they
thought, and were; all they valued and
did.
"Greek literature in English transla
tions, Greek life and periods will be
I studied. We will use whatever lan
| guages the student has at his com
j mand," said Dr. Meiklejohn in speak
! ing of tlie content of the probable
| civilization that will be studied during
the first year in which the new scheme
; of education will operate.
"We will have a very young faculty
| and a common course of study for all
; the students enrolled; consequently
we hope to create a sense of com
munity," said Dr. Meiklejohn.
"The principal purpose which it is
intended that the new system of edu
cation shall accomplish is to cause
students to learn to think for them
selves," he stated.
Dr. Meiklejohn is certain that there
is something decidedly wrong with the
present method of college education.
, He hopes that his plan will succeed
: in really educating young people by
abandoning the lecture system and
specific reading assignments, and sub
! stituting for them individual instruc
tion by means of personal conferences
based on each student's voluntary
reading. Reports will be due at defi
nite times and an examination will be
given at the end of the year, but re
sponsibility for the acquisition of
knowledge will be placed entirely on
i the man himself.
j Although there is no plan such as
I that of Dr. Meiklejohn which has been
! tried before, there is one which was
i in some respects like his. Reed Col
| lege in Oregon intitiated a somewhat
I similar program about 15 years ago
' under President Scholz, who was the
! first Rhodes Scholar from Wisconsin,
I the state in which Dr. Meiklejohn's

educational innovation will be inaugu
rated next fall.
"I am coming to Stanford sometime
soon. What do you think 1 ought to
talk about?"
The writer felt incompetent to de

tide that question, but Stanford will
have the opportunity to hear Dr.
Meiklejohn speak on August 16, when
he will arrive on the campus from the
University of California where he is a
member of the summer faculty.

To prevent the possibility of having
preferred against him the charge of

added, "I may not define it that way

Dr. Meiklejohn is certain that there
is something decidedly wrong with the

, He hopes that his plan will succeed
: in really educating young people by
abandoning the lecture system and
specific reading assignments, and sub

based on each student's voluntary
reading. Reports will be due at defi

pointed to a package of cigarettes on
the table and invited him to smoke
before proceeding with the interview.

them but who knows none of them in

with the twelve professors w r ho will
instruct them, in a dormitory which
has been recently constructed at the
University of Wisconsin.
Instead of choosing the subjects
which they will take for the ensuing
year according to the elective system,
all of these men will study the same
seneral subject, which has been tenta
tively fixed as Greek Civilization in all
of its various aspects to be taught

I studied. We will use whatever lan

the first year in which the new scheme

"We will have a very young faculty

munity," said Dr. Meiklejohn.
"The principal purpose which it is
intended that the new system of edu
cation shall accomplish is to cause
students to learn to think for them
selves," he stated.
Dr. Meiklejohn is certain that there
is something decidedly wrong with the
present method of college education.
, He hopes that his plan will succeed
: in really educating young people by
abandoning the lecture system and
specific reading assignments, and sub
! stituting for them individual instruc
tion by means of personal conferences
based on each student's voluntary
reading. Reports will be due at defi
nite times and an examination will be
given at the end of the year, but re
sponsibility for the acquisition of
knowledge will be placed entirely on
i the man himself.
j Although there is no plan such as
I that of Dr. Meiklejohn which has been

i in some respects like his. Reed Col

"I am coming to Stanford sometime
soon. What do you think 1 ought to
talk about?"
The writer felt incompetent to de

tide that question, but Stanford will
have the opportunity to hear Dr.
Meiklejohn speak on August 16, when
he will arrive on the campus from the
University of California where he is a
member of the summer faculty.
"Have a cigarette?"
After the writer was comfortably
.seated, Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn
pointed to a package of cigarettes on
the table and invited him to smoke
before proceeding with the interview.
This little incident is significant be
cause it makes apparent that Dr.
Meiklejohn attempts to bridge with
familiarity the invisible gulf that fre
quently exists between professors and
students as a result of the lecture sys
tem which places often hundreds of
young men and women into the pres
ence of a professor who is to teach
them but who knows none of them in
dividually.
Will Live Together
Next autumn Dr. Meiklejohn will
inaugurate at the University of Wis
consin a new method of teaching fresh
men and later sophomore students.
The 120 men who will enroll in this
experimental college will live together
with the twelve professors w r ho will
instruct them, in a dormitory which
has been recently constructed at the
University of Wisconsin.
Instead of choosing the subjects
which they will take for the ensuing
year according to the elective system,
all of these men will study the same
seneral subject, which has been tenta
tively fixed as Greek Civilization in all
of its various aspects to be taught
j during the freshman year. No classes
j will be held in the ordinary sense of
I the word, but each group of ten men
1 will meet with a certain professor for
I frequent discussions of common prob
j lems. Also it is probable that the en
, tire class of 120 students will gather
j quite often for discussions.
j The faculty will devote approximate
| ly two-thirds of its time to the new
j college and will probably give one
j course each in the regular curriculum
! of the university. During the sopho
j more year of the class matriculating
lat Dr. Meiklejohn's college next fall,
I"a nineteenth century civilization prob
| ably the English or American during
; the industrial expansion period will
!be studied."
A Middle Age civilization may be
| taken up before one of the nineteenth
! century is studied, but Dr. Meiklejolin
states that "the courses of study as
j well as the details of instruction will
not be definitely determined until the
faculty assembles in the fall."
"What is 'civilization' as you would
j define it for the purposes in which
you will employ it in your proposed
j course of study?" seemed a logical
question to ask.
! "Civilizaton means the complex of
j arrangements built up by a group of
| ' • _____

people in their inner and outer rela
tions," answered Dr. Meiklejohn.
To prevent the possibility of having
preferred against him the charge of
self-contradiction at a future time, he
added, "I may not define it that way
again, but for the moment that seems
to be an adequate definition. It in
cludes their beliefs, cares, interests;
| it comprehends everything they
thought, and were; all they valued and
did.
