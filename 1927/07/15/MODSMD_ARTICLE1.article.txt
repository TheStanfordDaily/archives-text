"Have a cigarette?"
After the writer was comfortably
.seated, Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn
pointed to a package of cigarettes on
the table and invited him to smoke
before proceeding with the interview.
This little incident is significant be
cause it makes apparent that Dr.
Meiklejohn attempts to bridge with
familiarity the invisible gulf that fre
quently exists between professors and
students as a result of the lecture sys
tem which places often hundreds of
young men and women into the pres
ence of a professor who is to teach
them but who knows none of them in
dividually.
Will Live Together
Next autumn Dr. Meiklejohn will
inaugurate at the University of Wis
consin a new method of teaching fresh
men and later sophomore students.
The 120 men who will enroll in this
experimental college will live together
with the twelve professors w r ho will
instruct them, in a dormitory which
has been recently constructed at the
University of Wisconsin.
Instead of choosing the subjects
which they will take for the ensuing
year according to the elective system,
all of these men will study the same
seneral subject, which has been tenta
tively fixed as Greek Civilization in all
