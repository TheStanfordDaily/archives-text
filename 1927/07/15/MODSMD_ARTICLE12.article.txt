# Feminism In France Less Aggressive Than Formerly, Declares Madame Stein
## 
### 
"Feminism in France is less aggres
sive than in Anglo-Saxon countries,"
said Hme. Marie do Mare Stein in the
Tuesday evening lecture on "Women
of Modern France." "Woman's influ
ence on national thought was strongly
felt until the fall of the monarchy in
the last century," she said, "but the
Republic is not a good place for the
French woman to exert her power;
she would rather exercise it on the
individual man than on the masses.
She doesn't interest herself in general
questions except individually."
In speaking of the political unit of
the French women, Mme. Stein said
that they have been severely criticized
for not organizing themselves more
efficiently, but that when they have
organized and insisted on their rights
they have had to pay dearly for them.
The men retaliated to their insistence

on perfect equality by passing a law
making women subject to military ser
vice. This act has been the origin of
many bitter controversies.
Still a Few Salons
With the publication of news and
literary reviews, the salon, where wo
men had occupied a conspicuous posi
j tiou, was deprived of one of its chief
'functions; however, it did not entirely
disappear with the fall of the mon
archy. The salon of Princesse Ma
thilde, cousin of Napoleon 111, was
open to the best wits in Paris until
her death in 1904, while today there
are still a few salons surrounded by
the glamour of the old regime.
In speaking of the outstanding wo
men figures of the last half century,
Mme. Stein first mentioned George
Sand and Mme. D'Agout. who belonged
to the romantic period. Though neither
of them were "man-haters" they were
both ardent feminists and championed
the cause of all women who considered
themselves the victims of convention.
They befriended the beautiful young
Mme. Lamarcine, later Mme. Ardent,
who afte ran unhappy marriage pre
ferred to turn to literature and mascu
line admiration rather than the con
vent for solace.
in 187G Mme. Ardent stepped into
the gap left by the death of George
Sand and gathered a group of young
writers about her. She was responsi
ble for the publication of the earliest
works of Loti and Bourget. The age
was one of materialism and skepti
cism, dominated by the philsopohy of
Taine and Renan, and Mme. Ardent,
like the other intelligenzia of the
time, renounced religion and conven
tion. Her point of view changed in her
old age, however, and she returned to
the religion of her youth. In this re
spect she is typical of the coldly in
tellectual Frenchwoman who tries des
perately not to believe in God, but
who, in the end, does.
Raschilde Began Career in 1881
Raschilde, who married Alfred
Valette, began her career as a re
porter in 1881, declaring her indepen
dence of convention by adopting mas
culine attire and having her cards en
graved: "Raschilde, homme des let
tres." She is the author of many popu
lar novels, and has been a critic in
later years.
The leading women poets of today
are the Countess de Noailles, an ar
dent socialist and a leading figure in
Bohemian life, Lucie Delarue 'Madrus,
who is also a prose writer, and Helene
Vacaresco, who was loved by Ferdi
nand of Roumania before his marriage.
It is in them that we find the most
sombre pessimism, while we look to
the men for religion.
Apollinaire Rivals Bernhardt
Among the actresses, next to Bern
hardt might be mentioned Apollinaire,
creator of the character of "Claudine"
of the Claudine series, written by
Colette. It is said that if the doors of
the Acadamie Francaise should ever
open to women, Colette would undoubt
edly be a candidate for admission if
it were not for these frivolous works.

Republic is not a good place for the
French woman to exert her power;
she would rather exercise it on the
individual man than on the masses.
She doesn't interest herself in general
questions except individually."
In speaking of the political unit of
the French women, Mme. Stein said
that they have been severely criticized
for not organizing themselves more
efficiently, but that when they have
organized and insisted on their rights
they have had to pay dearly for them.
The men retaliated to their insistence

on perfect equality by passing a law
making women subject to military ser
vice. This act has been the origin of
many bitter controversies.
Still a Few Salons
With the publication of news and
literary reviews, the salon, where wo
men had occupied a conspicuous posi
j tiou, was deprived of one of its chief
'functions; however, it did not entirely
disappear with the fall of the mon
archy. The salon of Princesse Ma
thilde, cousin of Napoleon 111, was
open to the best wits in Paris until
her death in 1904, while today there
are still a few salons surrounded by
the glamour of the old regime.
In speaking of the outstanding wo
men figures of the last half century,
Mme. Stein first mentioned George
Sand and Mme. D'Agout. who belonged
to the romantic period. Though neither
of them were "man-haters" they were
both ardent feminists and championed
the cause of all women who considered
themselves the victims of convention.
They befriended the beautiful young
Mme. Lamarcine, later Mme. Ardent,
who afte ran unhappy marriage pre
ferred to turn to literature and mascu
line admiration rather than the con
vent for solace.
in 187G Mme. Ardent stepped into
the gap left by the death of George
Sand and gathered a group of young
writers about her. She was responsi
ble for the publication of the earliest
works of Loti and Bourget. The age
was one of materialism and skepti
cism, dominated by the philsopohy of
Taine and Renan, and Mme. Ardent,
like the other intelligenzia of the
time, renounced religion and conven
tion. Her point of view changed in her
old age, however, and she returned to
the religion of her youth. In this re
spect she is typical of the coldly in
tellectual Frenchwoman who tries des
perately not to believe in God, but
who, in the end, does.
Raschilde Began Career in 1881
Raschilde, who married Alfred
Valette, began her career as a re
porter in 1881, declaring her indepen
dence of convention by adopting mas
culine attire and having her cards en
graved: "Raschilde, homme des let
tres." She is the author of many popu
lar novels, and has been a critic in
later years.
The leading women poets of today
are the Countess de Noailles, an ar
dent socialist and a leading figure in
Bohemian life, Lucie Delarue 'Madrus,
who is also a prose writer, and Helene
Vacaresco, who was loved by Ferdi
nand of Roumania before his marriage.
It is in them that we find the most
sombre pessimism, while we look to
the men for religion.
Apollinaire Rivals Bernhardt
Among the actresses, next to Bern
hardt might be mentioned Apollinaire,
creator of the character of "Claudine"
of the Claudine series, written by
Colette. It is said that if the doors of
the Acadamie Francaise should ever
open to women, Colette would undoubt
edly be a candidate for admission if
it were not for these frivolous works.
"Feminism in France is less aggres
sive than in Anglo-Saxon countries,"
said Hme. Marie do Mare Stein in the
Tuesday evening lecture on "Women
of Modern France." "Woman's influ
ence on national thought was strongly
felt until the fall of the monarchy in
the last century," she said, "but the
