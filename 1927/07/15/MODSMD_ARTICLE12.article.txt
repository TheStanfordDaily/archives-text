organized and insisted on their rights
they have had to pay dearly for them.

on perfect equality by passing a law
making women subject to military ser
vice. This act has been the origin of
many bitter controversies.

her death in 1904, while today there

men figures of the last half century,
Mme. Stein first mentioned George
Sand and Mme. D'Agout. who belonged
