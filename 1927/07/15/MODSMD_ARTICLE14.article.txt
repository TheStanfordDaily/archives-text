## 
### 
Eighteen Stanford men, a part of
the ordnance R.O.T.C. unit at Camp
Lewis, Washington, leave today for
Fort Casey on Puget Sound where two
weeks will be spent in the operation
and testing of high caliber cannon.
The work consists mainly in measur
ing powder pressure and muzzle velo
city with the accurate instruments
adopted by the War Department.
Following this period, the unit will
return to Camp Lewis for two weeks,
during which time the work will be
given over to tanks, tractors, and
trucks, which will be operated
by the students.
An ordnance department was start
ed at Stanford two years ago, and is
open to only those in the school of
engineering. Its purpose is to supply

along scientific lines that would be
available in cast of a national emer
gency. Many of the professors in the
