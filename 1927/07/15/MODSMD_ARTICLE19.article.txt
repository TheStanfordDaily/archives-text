# DAVIS ANNOUNCES TALENTED CAST FOR GALSWORTHY PLAY
## Many Men in "Loyalties" To Be Given on July 29 SAM HAYES GIVEN LEAD Dorothy Gamier Principal Feminine Character As Mabel 
### 
Headed by Sam Hayes, as Captain.
Ronald Dancy, D.5.0., a cast of nine
teen characters was finally chosen
Wednesday night by Gordon Davis for
"Loyalties," John Galsworthy's play,
which will be presented by the Dra
matic Council, Fridcy, July 29, in the
Assembly Hall.
Numbered among the members of
the cast are a great many people
familiar to campus theatregoers, as
well as several new ones. The play is
distinctly a man's play, with seventeen
male parts.
All of the roles are distinctive and
varied characters.
Dorothy Gamier to Be Mabel
Dorothy Garnier, who has the part
of Mabel, Dancy's wife, will be remem
bered for her work in "Wicked Wil
liam," this year's Junior Opera. Prior
to her matriculation at Stanford last
fall, Miss Garnier had played in stock
companies in Long Beach, San Bernar
dino, and at the Morosco Theater in
Los Angeles. With this background of
experience, she is well-fitted to handle
the intense role required in "Loyal
ties."
The other two female roles are
taken by Helen Cooper, as Margaret
Orme, and Martha Montgomery, as
Lady Adella. Miss Cooper was also in
the Junior Opera. "Wicked William,"
and had a dramatic part in John Per
guson. Miss Montgomery had her first
role on the campus in "Craig's Wife,"
in which she played Mrs. Frazier. Her
pleasing portrayal of that character
won much praise. She is cast in a
somewhat similar part in "Loyalties."
Among the male members of the
cast known to frequenters of Stanford
productions are Harold G. Brownson,
Raymond Haizlip, Dave Stollery, Guy
Holliday, Russell Stroup, Frank Baker,
Sid Badcon, and Charles Brinkley.
