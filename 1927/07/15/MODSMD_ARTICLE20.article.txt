# LE 						CERCLE FRANCAIS HEARS DR. CHARLIER TALK ON "TARTUFFE"
## 
### 
Dr. Gustave Charlier was the guest
of an informal meeting held Wednes
day evening at the home of Dr. Oliver
Martin Johnston, head of the Romanic
Language department. He is a visiting
professor from Brussels, Belgium.
Dr. Charlier read a paper on the tex
tual revision of Moli&re's best-known
comedy, "Tartuffe." He proved that
two lost versions preceded the compo
sition of the extant text and con
cluded from the internal and external
evidence that the play underwent a
radical revision during the five years
between its first presentation at Ver
sailles (16(54) and the appearance of
the drama as we know it (1669). The
lost version produced in 1667 with the
temporary title of "Panulph, ou l'lm
posteur" and the version of 1669 repre
sent two successive stages of revision.
Dr. Charlier explained the revision
of "Tartuffe" as a consistent effort to
adapt the comedy to the demands of
popular prejudiceâ€”to force it into con
formity with the beliefs of his ortho
dox critics. After its introduction to
the Court in 1664, "Tartuffe" was de
nied further production. The censors
interpreted its exposure of the pious
hypocrite as an attack on the Church.
Dr. Charlier suggested, from the evi
dence he has collected, that the revi
sion following this disastrous presenta
tion of the play resulted in an attempt
on the part of the author to qualify
and modify his comedy.
"It became less cynical and less gen
eral," he said.
The three principal characters un
derwent a gradual evolution. Having
begun life as a vicious priest, Tartuffe
shrank into the religious eccentric,
whose flagrant hypocricy and laugh
able egotism could not be interpreted
as mockery of the Church. Tartuffe is
not a legitimate "d6vot" but an im
post er.
"His dupe, Orgon, must also have
been considerably changed." And
| Cl6anthe, the third person, the critic,
i the restorer of equilibrium, has been
I developed from a negative minor rob>
!in the version of 1664, He becnme
; more important as his "soft answers"
1 became more necessary to the success
| of the play.
