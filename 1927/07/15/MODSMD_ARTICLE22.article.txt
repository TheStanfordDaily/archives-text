Do you think it is more enjoyable to "jazz around with the broads"
than to take your girl friends to dances? Would you rather "kill a
camel" than smoke a cigarette? Is there a better reaction to "razzing
the poor ham" than to showing the fellow his mistake?
Why do we "beat it" when it would be just as easy to go? Why do
we "spread the salve" when flattery would serve the purpose? What is
the advantage of being "scared bow-legged" when a bad fright would do
just as well?
Have you ever "got somebody's little old angora" instead of provok
ing him? Have you ever "got by" by "polishing the apples' when you
might just as well have passed the course by using your personality to
influence the professor?
Do you call on "queens" or attractive young ladies? Are they "keen"
or charming? Do you ''punch a hack" or drive an automobile? Do you
"crack the books" to "bone" for an "ex," or study hard for examinations?
Do you "put on the nose-bag" or eat your lunch?
In short, do you speak the English language that might reasonably be
expected of a representative university student, or do you sling
"slanguage ?"
