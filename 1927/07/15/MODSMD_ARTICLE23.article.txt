Dollars by twos and dozens rolled in through the windows of the
cashier's desk down at the Administration building yesterday. You
wondered where they were bound.
Those same dollars rolled right out again and will be put to work in a
number of ways by the departments -to whose credit they are entered.
Some of you actually do receive a syllabus in a course or two. If
none is given to the class, the money may be used bv the department to
buy recent books, which are then placed in the library for your use. You
perhaps have seen a book with the words "Syllabus Fund" inside the
cover.
The heavy syllabus fees paid by those taking a beginning language
are used to pay instructors for those courses, which are considered not
strictly of university grade.
When you take a laboratory course you have the privilege of seeing
what becomes of your fees, and the hope of getting back a little lucre if
you don't throw all the best tubes at the Phi Bete at the next table.
