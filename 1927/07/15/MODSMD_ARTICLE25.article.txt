# Practice Putting Green Added to Gym Equipment
## 
### 
Besides the six golf cages which are !
now heing extensively used for "long j
shot" practice in back of Encina Gym, I
there has been added a putting green
for practice. The green is made of sand |
mixed with oil. According to Will B.
Ellington, who is instructing golf en- j
thusiasts this summer, this type of :
green is used on many practice ]
grounds and courses and its speed is
very similar to that of the usual grass
green.
Ellington is now conducting classes j
from 3 to 5 o'clock on Tuesdays and
Thursdays for anyone on the campus
who wishes instruction in the rudi
ments of the Scotch game. No credits
are to be given. 1
