"CHARLES LINDBERGH"—By Dale
Van Every & Morris D. Tracy—!
(D. Appleton Co.)
"Charles Lindbergh," the biography j
of the transatlantic flyer, is a news- j
paper achievement by Dale Van Every,
a Stanford graduate, and Morris D.
Tracy, through the co-operation of
Karl A. Bickel, another former Stan
ford man. I
A Newspaper Achievement
Bickel has written the introduction
to the volume which was put together
in record speed through the initiative
of the United Press, of which he is
president. A call was sent out to all
correspondents of the United Press,
the country over, to develop and turn
in at once all material available con
cerning Lindbergh. This volume was
the result.
The book starts out with an account
of this young aviator when he was
headed East and kept on going East
until he had reached Paris. It is told
in vigorous newspaper style and the
details of the flyer's life are made
interesting reading.
Each chapter is a part by itself,
somewhat like a news story. It is com
plete, concise, and specific in its am
plification of details concerning Lind-

i bergh's life. Since the material for the |
j book was collected from the numerous
i agencies of the United Press Associa
| tion everywhere, the authors had an
I abundance of authentic data from
I which to compose the completed vol-
J ume. A characteristic which gives the
| work a touch of intimacy is the fre
j quent insertion of direct quotations
I from the people with whom Lindbergh ,
! had been closely associated during the i
I several distinct periods of his life.
