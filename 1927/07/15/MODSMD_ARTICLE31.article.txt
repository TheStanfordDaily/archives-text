# STANFORD RANKED FIRST IN TRACK BY "BIG TEN" CRITIC
## Season's Records Make It Backbone of Mythical "All American" 
### 
Stanford's possession of the best
college track team In the country,
with the University of Southern Cali
fornia runner-up, established in the
1.0.4-A. meet, is confirmed from an
other approach by the selection of the
annual theoretical All-American inter
collegiate team by Albon Holden in
the "Big Ten Weekly," organ of the
Western Conference colleges.
Holden, basing his selections on the
year's best competitive records, names
more Stanford men among the year's
leaders than receive places from any
other university.
He ranked the best six men in each
event. Under the usual system of
points in college meets, Stanford
would be credited with thirty-six and
one-half points and the, University of
Southern California with twenty and
one-half.
Spencer Third in Quarter
In the high hurdles, Ross Nichols
and Clarence West of Stanford are
placed in second and third positions.
As low hurdlers this pair was, in re
verse order, given honorable mention,
though not placed among the best six.
Emerson Spencer rates third to
Phillips of Butler and Alderman of
Michigan State in the 440. "Bud" blew
up from over-training, and failed to
show in the 1.C.4-A., but his time of
:47.S is far better than has been made
for several years, and was taken "Into
account by Holden.
Nineteen twenty-seven produced a
great number of fine milers. Alex Mc-
Kinnon, a Stanford sophomore, was
one of the best of these. Holden ranks
him as sixth.
Hoffman First in Shot
"Biff" Hoffman naturally rates as
king-pin among the shot and discus
men. Hoffman often approached the
fifty-foot mark with the iron ball, and
was a constant menace to "Bud"
Houser's discus record. "Taffy" Evans
received honorable mention, though
not included among the leading six.
Forster fitted into fourth position in
the shot-put. Way and Fleishhacker
came in for honorable mention. Hol
den gives considerable praise to Stan
ford's quartet of weight men.
Versatile Ted Shipkey is considered
by Holden to be the fourth best' jave
lin man in American colleges today.
Joaquin and Sparling were considered
worthy of special mention, though
falling below the top half-dozen.
King Places High
Bob King was shoved into second
place by the sustained excellence of
Burg, Chicago. Burg jumped no higher
than King, but was more consistent
than was the flu-handicapped Cardinal.
Competition Called "Amazing"
Ward Edmonds is a mighty fine
pole-vaulter, but he went up against
the most phenomenal competition in
field history, and, despite his mark of
thirteen feet, six inches, Holden had
to rank him fourth.
Zombro and Dyer are ranked sec
ond and third in the broad jump, and
Meeks, whom Holden calls "the third
of the great Stanford stars," receives
only an honorable mention in spite
of his 24-foot leaps. The broad jump
competition of the year is termed
"just as amazing" as that in the pole
vault. Hamm of Georgia Tech, who al
most reached 25 feet, is ranked first,
and Zombro and Dyer are ranked
ahead of Bates and Mathias, who beat
them in the East, on the score of their
season's better averages.
