# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
A New York golf writer, in a story
about Bobby Jones' first hole-in-one,
wrote that the event was "one of the
high spots of his (Jones') career, dur
ing which he won more titles than any
amateur the game has ever known."
I beg to differ. When Bobby Jones
finally lays aside his golf clubs, if the
kind Fates permit him to live his
allotted number of years, he will un
doubtedly have won more titles than
any other amateur, but at present the
honor must go to John Ball, Jr., of
Hoylake, the 64-year-old marvel who,
unfortunately, has never played in the
United States.
Let us compare the two gentlemen,
one just turned twenty-five, the other
going on sixty-five. Both have much in
common besides their numerous vic
tories. It is taken for granted that both
possess a free, rhythmic swing, great
courage, and the will to win. Both are
modest, unassuming, and true ama
teurs. Both were "infant prodigies"—
Johnny tying for fourth in the 1878
British open championship when he
was only 14, and Bobby qualifying for
and winning two matches in the 1916
United States amateur championship
when he was 14. Bobby played in his
first "open" when he was 18, finishing
eighth at Toledo in 1920. There was
no British amateur tournament until
ISS6. when Johnny Ball was 23. He
was runner-up the following year, and
won it first in 1888.
Now for their records in national
amateur and open tournaments. John
Ball won eight British amateur crowns
and one open, his last amateur victory
coming twenty-four years after his
first. Jones has won two U.S. amateur
titles (in succession), two U.S. open
titles, and one British open title. He
still has until 1948 to win six more

amateur crowns, and the chances are
that he will easily beat Ball's record.
The great English amateur won
ninety-nine matches in the British
amateur tournaments in which he
played. The great American amateur
has already won twenty-eight, thirteen
of them being consecutive, and there
were no tournaments in 1917 or 1918
for the young star to compete in.
Jones' record in the U.S. open, how
ever, is far superior to Ball's in the
British open. Bobby lost the champion
ship this year, but in the five years
before that he finished as follows:
tied for second, first, second, tied for
first, and first! Today he is making a
bid for the English open championship
at the historic St. Andrew s.

that he will easily beat Ball's record.
The great English amateur won
ninety-nine matches in the British
amateur tournaments in which he
played. The great American amateur
has already won twenty-eight, thirteen
of them being consecutive, and there
were no tournaments in 1917 or 1918
for the young star to compete in.
Jones' record in the U.S. open, how
ever, is far superior to Ball's in the
British open. Bobby lost the champion
ship this year, but in the five years
before that he finished as follows:
tied for second, first, second, tied for
first, and first! Today he is making a
bid for the English open championship
at the historic St. Andrew s.


Youth and Age
A New York golf writer, in a story
about Bobby Jones' first hole-in-one,
wrote that the event was "one of the
high spots of his (Jones') career, dur
ing which he won more titles than any
amateur the game has ever known."
I beg to differ. When Bobby Jones
finally lays aside his golf clubs, if the
kind Fates permit him to live his
allotted number of years, he will un
doubtedly have won more titles than
any other amateur, but at present the
honor must go to John Ball, Jr., of
Hoylake, the 64-year-old marvel who,
unfortunately, has never played in the
United States.
Let us compare the two gentlemen,
one just turned twenty-five, the other
going on sixty-five. Both have much in
common besides their numerous vic
tories. It is taken for granted that both
possess a free, rhythmic swing, great
courage, and the will to win. Both are
modest, unassuming, and true ama
teurs. Both were "infant prodigies"—
Johnny tying for fourth in the 1878
British open championship when he
was only 14, and Bobby qualifying for
and winning two matches in the 1916
United States amateur championship
when he was 14. Bobby played in his
first "open" when he was 18, finishing
eighth at Toledo in 1920. There was
no British amateur tournament until
ISS6. when Johnny Ball was 23. He
was runner-up the following year, and
won it first in 1888.
Now for their records in national
amateur and open tournaments. John
Ball won eight British amateur crowns
and one open, his last amateur victory
coming twenty-four years after his
first. Jones has won two U.S. amateur
titles (in succession), two U.S. open
titles, and one British open title. He
still has until 1948 to win six more

amateur crowns, and the chances are
that he will easily beat Ball's record.
