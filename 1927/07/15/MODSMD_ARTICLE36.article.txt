# CURTIS LANDSCAPES WILL BE MOVED FROM ART GALLERY SOON
## 
### 
The Curtis landscapes of Australia j
will be moved out of the Art Gallery
toward the end of the month to make
112 room for some other exhibition, ac- j
I cording to Pedro J. Lemos, Director
of the Museum and Art Gallery.
J. W. Curtis, who painted the col
| lection which was placed on display
last week, was hired by Thomas Wei
i ton Stanford on salary basis to make |
j these paintings of Australia. "He was !
! a commercial artist," said Director j
| Lemos. "His landscapes are valuable '
because they depict those of Australia ;
sincerely; they are too photographic j
to be artistic.
"Thomas Welton Stanford made a
hobby of collecting . pictures," con-,
j tinued Mr. Lemos. "He left so much
| that we could fill the Art Gallery from
j one end to the other with his collec
i tions only. The Curtis group is one of
these."
The Helen Hyde Bloc Prints which
were placed on display last month will
J remain on display until about October
! 1. Ordinarily outside collections are i
i not placed on display during the sum- j
nier; usually only re displays of vari
ous parts of the Thomas Welton Stan- j
ford permanent collection, such as the j
Curtis landscapes, are made. The Hyde i
prints have been donated to the Uni
! versity by relatives of the late Helen ;
i Hyde.
