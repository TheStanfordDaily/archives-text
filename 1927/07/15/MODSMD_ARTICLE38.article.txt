# MME. STEIN FINDS FRENCH PLAYWRIGHTS STUDY INNER SELF
## 
### 
French drama has changed its direc
tion since the Free Theatre of Andr»§
d'Antoine was in its prime—according
to Mme. Marie de Mare Stein, in her
French lecture on "Le Theatre d'Au
jourd'hui" held on Wednesday after
noon in the Little Theatre. Fifty years
ago, French dramatists fixed their at
tention and that of their public on ex
ternal reality—on the facts of material
existence. The playwrights of today
attempt to portray the soul —"the inner
self."
The writers of modern French trag
edy are either mystic, like Paul Clau
del, author of 'TAnnonce fait a Marie,"
or "superrealistic." Of the "superreal
istic" dramatists, Henrie Rene Lenor
mand is perhaps the most interesting
and certainly the most important. His
tragedies are studies in the subcon
scious.
"He shows the influence of Freud,
but in many of his plays, he distinctly
opposes psychoanalysis," Mme. Stein
said.
His best-known tragedies are "Le
Temps est un Songe," "L'Homme et
ses Fantomes," "Une Vie Secrete,"
"Le Mangeur de Reves," and "Le
Lathe." Mme. Stein illustrated from
"Le Temps est un Songe" and "Une
Vie Secrete."
She discussed the school of "IJnan
isrne," to which the majority of con
temporary comic writers belong. Like
"Superrealisme," "Unanisme" is based
on a psychological theory—for the
latter school a belief in "the collective
soul"—the single-minded impulsive
ness of a mob. In the comedies of
Jules Romains, the mob spirit is
treated as a single character. Mme.
Stein read a few pasasges from
"Knock! (ou le Triomphe de la M -
decine)" and from "Le Marriage du
Trouhadec."
"Jules Romains," she reminded her
listeners, "has been compared with
Moli^re."
