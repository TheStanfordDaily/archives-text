# Women's Swimming Classes Are Making Fast Progress
## 
### 
"Members of the swimming classes
are making good progress, and I am
proud of them," states Mrs. Ruth Cal
vin, Director of Physical Education for
Women.
The class in elementary swimming
now get their faces wet by sticking
t hem under water and blowing bubbles
"soft and fine" without being warned
to do so by their instructor. Many can
dive off the edge of the tank from a
sitting position. Of course, some get
a severe slap on the chest from a de
sire to dive without wetting the head,
but this is all taken, as part of the
game.
They can all float on face and back,
and some can "flutter kick" all the
way across the tank (35 feet). A per
fect score is across the tank in six
strokes. A few can already make this.
The intermediate class is also mak
ing good progress. They are practicing
the standing dive, and are able to
swim three times the length of the
tank without stopping.
