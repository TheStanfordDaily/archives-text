# Tennis Courts Are Closed For Play on Sundays
## 
### 
Varsity tennis courts will no longer
be open for play on Sundays, accord
ing to the physical education depart
ment. The reason given for this move
was that many people have failed to
observe the ruling that shoes with
hard heels are barred from the courts.
The following is a schedule of the
time at which the tennis courts may
be used:
