Coastal Range. At the highest point
the road may be seen stretching down
the slope for miles ahead.
Although there will be opportunity
to secure some light refreshments,
those making the trip are advised to
bring their own luncheon, as the town
is situated about a quarter of a mile
from the shore.
Reservations will be accepted up till
4 o'clock today at 173 Administration
building. The price for the trip is
$2.50.
