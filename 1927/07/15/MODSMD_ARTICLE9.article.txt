his court to a good advantage.

There are fifty men signed up for
the tournament —a much larger num
ber than was expected.
The intramural tennis tournament
promises to offer plenty of interest
and fast playing with such players as
Wallace Denny, Leighton Bledsoe,
Paul Engelcke from the upper half,
and Joseph Castellanos, Paul LaCha
pelle, Byron R. Snow, and Paul Mock
ett of the lower half signed up.
Denny, who is athletic trainer for all
Stanford sports, has an uncanny abil
ity for placing the ball which makes
up for his lack of racquet wprk and
speed. He seems to be able to put the
ball in any part of the colrt at will.
Bledsoe is seventh man on the varsity.
He plays a fast and steady game and
is a hard man to beat. Engelcke plays
a good game, beating Denny last sum
mer. He has a bad foot that may slow
him up. Barker has had lots of tourna
ment experience and is good on place
ment.
Castellanos fs Entered
Castellanos played on the freshman
team two years ago and has made
wonderful improvement this summer.
He will make someone work to keep
his place on the varsity as he is good
enough now for fourth place on that
gquad.
LaChapelle has very good form,
plays a good game, and covers his
court well. Snow has played in several
local tournaments and plays a fast
brand of tennis. Mockett was on the
freshman team two years ago. He
plays a hard, decisive game and covers
his court to a good advantage.
A dark horse is appearing in the
form of Eli Bashor, who defeated Dud
ley Haskell in a G-0, 6-0 match.
With players such as these signed,
the competition for the tennis racquet
that Ellery, Arms & Co. of San Fran
cisco is offering to the first-place win
ner is going to be very strong and
worth watching, Coach Hal Davis be
lieves.
