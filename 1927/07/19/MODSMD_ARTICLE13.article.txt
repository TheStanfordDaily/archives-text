# SCANDINAVIAN, SLAVIC MUSIC WILL FEATURE RECITAL AT CHURCH
## 
### 
Following Sunday's program of con
j temporary European organ music,
I Warren D. Allen will give a program
lof particularly interesting music by
j Slavic and Scandinavian composers
this afternoon in the Memorial
Church.
One of the Russian numbers, a
sketch by Borodin, tells a story that
has in it all the melancholy joy that
i is characteristic of the Slavic nature,
j It is called "In the Steppes of Central
Asia," and has in it the feeling of
broad sweeps which the name implies.
"Out of the silence of the sandy
I
steppes comes the sound of a peaceful
Russian song. There are heard next,
the melancholy strains of Oriental
melodies and the stamping of ap
proaching horses and camels. A cara
van, escorted by Russian soldiers, is
crossing the measureless desert, pur
suing its way, free from care, under
the protection of Russian arms. The
caravan moves ever forward. The
songs of the Russians and those of
the Asiatics mingle in common har
mony, their refrain gradually dying
away in the distance."
The program, as follows, consists
entirely of transcriptions from orches
tral and other sources owing to the
fact that the organ has not received
as much attention from composers
from the north and east of Europe as
j from the composers previously taken
I up in the series of recitals.

Church, the subject being "The Mod
j ern Organ." This lecture, to be illus
trated informally by selections from
current programs, will be given in (he
i gallery in order that the audience may
j observe the various parts of the organ,
! which Mr. Allen will explain. The
i lecture will take place, as before, at
4:15 Thursday afternoon, and at that
