# TOYON SUMMER CLUB STAGES ATTRACTIVE GARDEN PARTY DANCE
## 
### 
More than one hundred couples at
tended the informal dance of the Toy
on Summer Club last Friday night at
Toyon Hall.
The hall was artistically decorated
as a summer garden from courtyard
to ballroom, in colors of a garden
green and rosy hue. The courtyard
was enhanced by means of large, rose
colored spotlights shining down from
the corners of the roof, while in the
entrance ways to both the courtyard
and the lobby, green lighting aided in
giving a degree of contrast. In the
lobby the vine-covered pillars were
made to seem more realistic by the
use of park benches instead of chairs.
Encircling the dance floor were
rows of potted plants interspersed
here and there by masses of full
blooming hydrangeas. The main light
ing fixtures of the room were fitted
with green globes and covered by
green paper shades. From the balcony
above the ballroom, hidden and suf
fused red lights gave forth a rosy
glow that combine harmoniously with
the green.
Lew Foote's Hotel St. Claire orches
tra furnished the music for the dancÂ»
ing.
