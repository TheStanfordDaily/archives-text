# WORK ON RAISING STADIUM HEIGHT BEGINS AT ONCE
## Long Piles to Be Driven to Support New Rows Of Seats STABILITY IS ENSURED Pillars Will Pierce Mound And Reach Into Solid Ground Beneath 
### 
Actual construction work on the en*
; largement of the Stanford stadium by
I the addition of fourteen rows of seats
will begin tomorrow or Thursday. The
| pile-driver which will drive the sup
j ports for the outer wall of the new
! part is being assembled and will be
| run up to the top of the embankment
i and begin work at once.
The piles are about forty feet long
i and will be driven through the em
ibankment of the present stadium and
1 about six feet into the original ground
underneath, ensuring stability for the
added seats. These pillars will be
sheathed to form the outer wall, which
will be covered with gunite plaster of
; the same color as other Stanford build
| ings. With arches piercing this wall at
frequent intervals, it will present an
architectural unit surmounting the
| tree-planted hill of the old stadium
j slope.
j The top of this wall will tower
j twenty feet above the present rim of
'the stadium. Inside the wall and under
I the new seats will be a nine-foot
| arcaded walk, giving access to the
[seats inside the stadium.
The scoreboards at each end of the
i stadium will be raised almost to the
, top of the new stadium rim, so as to
J cut off only a few of the additional
j seats.
The work will be completed well in
advance of the Big Game next year
and the work will not interfere with
the use of the stadium for games to
ibe held there before it is fully re
i modelled.
