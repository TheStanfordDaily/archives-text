# "Boccaccio's Untold Tale" Is Given by English Class
## 
### 
To bring out clearly what is meant
by the tempo of a play, a group of
Mrs. Olive Kisich's English 118a class
members presented "Boccaccio's Un
told Tale," by Harry Kemp, yesterday
afternoon during the regular class
hour.
This play starts very slowly and
works up gradually to a tense situa
tion which is expressed by rapid read
ing of the lines and many pauses.
