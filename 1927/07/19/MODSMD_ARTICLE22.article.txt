# Welcome, Secretaries
## 
### 
To the Western School for Commercial Secretaries, in session on the
campus this week, the Stanford Daily extends a cordial greeting, and
welcomes its members to the fellowship of the campus.
Like the rest of us, the secretaries are here for study and work.
Stanford's facilities are always open to such.
To many of these men no welcome is really needed, for they have been
here before. The school was started at Stanford some seven years ago,
in order to help equip secretaries for the rapidly developing duties which
chambers of commerce are sponsoring and developing in their cities.
It is an important work, and we are glad that Stanford can claim
credit for having started it, and can continue to co-operate with the
organization.
