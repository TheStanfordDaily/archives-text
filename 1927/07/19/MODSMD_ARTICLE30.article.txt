# BOOKSTORE PATRONS GET BACK PART OF MONEY THEY SPEND
## Sales Tickets Yield Ten Per Cent of Amount of Purchase 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore will take '
your money for books, stationery, and
such things, and then it will pay you j
hack a part of the profits it makes on ;
sales if you will take the slight trouble j
to make that possible. The Bookstore ;
sells at regular prices but is run on a
profit sharing basis, returning to cus.-
tomers a percentage of the money it I
takes in, according to the amount of;
their purchases. For a number of years ,
this has been ten per cent.
Many Use Plan
According to R. M. Stager, manager
of the store, many people now take ad- j
vantage of this profit-sharing plan, j
Formerly students very largely disre- |
garded the opportunity, thinking the j
money to be gained not worth the trou- j
hie of saving the coupons entitling
them to their share. Some campus or
ganizations took advantage of this in
difference by putting boxes in the Book
store into which patrons of the store '
might drop their slips, which were gath-l

ered up and turned into considerable
amounts of cash.
To take a part in this co-operative
enterprise it is necessary for purchasers
to leave their names at the office of the
Bookstore. For each purchase a cus-1
tomer receives a receipt which must be j
saved and turned in to the office each !
month in an envelope. At the end of the j
fiscal year a rebate will be sent to the |
customer. This is usually done in No-!
vember.
Supplies of All Kinds
The Bookstore is equipped to meet '
all needs of students along the school
supply line. Supplies or books not on j
hand are wired for so that the studert j
will not be inconvenienced.
