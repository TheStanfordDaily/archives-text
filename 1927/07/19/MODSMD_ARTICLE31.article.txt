Harry W. Maloney, Associated Di- ;

recently a letter from Gene Tunney,
heavyweight champion, stating that he
is in training and will be in tit condi- '
tion to meet the winner of the Demp
sey-Sharkey fight, which takes place
Thursday evening.
Tunney is a personal friend of Ma
loney and it was from the Stanford
coach that the champion received his i
preliminary training during the World
War. The boxer wished to be remem- j
bered to all those students he met on
his visit here last spring.
