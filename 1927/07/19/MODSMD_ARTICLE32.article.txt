Thirteen volumes, with portfolios,
of "The North American Indian," by
Edwin S. Curtis, have been presented
to the Stanford Library. They are the
gift of seven former Stanford stu
dents.
The volumes are beautifully bound,
in keeping with the value of the eon
tent. Critics have said of these books
that for beauty of typography, as well
as for historical value, they are un
excelled.
Without sacrificing scientific accu
racy, the finish, style, and make-up of
these books is such as to appeal to
the public. Such was the primary aim
in writing "The North American In
dian."
Volumes Are Unbiased
The volumes, in content, are his- |
torical and unbiased. The Indian ver- I
sus the white man is treated with im- j
partiality. The author has reached be- |
neath the surface of the Indian's crea- j
tion myths, h\s legends, and folklore,
to his mode of thought. Few people j
have a more elaborate religious sys- j
tem than our aborigines, and none are I
more devout in the performance of the J
duties connected therewith. Scarcely :
an act in the Indian's life does not in
volve some ceremonial or is not in
itself a religious act.
The' pictures are as true to nature 1
as to art. They have strength, com- 1
pleteness, and tone. They show the j
Indian as a natural man. The pictures
are not colored but the massing of
dark and light secures effects which j
make the pictures art.
Covers U.S. and Alaska Tribes
"The North American Indian" is an
attempt to form a comprehensive and j
permanent record of all the important j
tribes of the United States and Alaska j
that still retain their primitive cus- i
toms and traditions. In treating the
various tribes a geographic rather

than an ethnological grouping is pre
sented.
Curtis says of the Navajo Indian
that he is the American Bedouin,
acknowledges no superior, a keeper
of flocks and herds', who asks nothing
of the Government but to be unmo
lested in his pastoral life and in the
religion of his forebears.
Twenty Years in Collection
Curtis spent twenty years collecting
his information, lived with the Indians

In their primitive camp life. Theodore
Roosevelt wrote in the foreword of the
volumes that Curtis "lived in Indian
conditions on intimate terms with
many different tribes of the moun
tains and the plains. He knows their
vigorous outward existence and has
caught glimpses of that strange spir
itual and mental life of theirs."
At the end of each volume, com
plete in itself, is an appendix giving
a very concise tribal summary, music
used in dances, songs sung on various
occasions, and selected vocabularies
from each tribe.
Will Comprise Twenty Volumes
Thirteen volumes of the series have
been written and when completed the
work will consist of 20 superb volumes
of text, with a total of 1500 full-page
illustrations, and 20 supplemental
portfolios containing 720 large photo
gravures.
