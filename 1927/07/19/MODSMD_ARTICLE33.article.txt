# HUNDRED MEN TRY FOR FIFTY PLACES IN AUTUMN QUARTER
## New Students Registered In Lower Division Number 155 
### 
One hundred and fifteen Lower Di
vision men and forty new Lower Divi
sion women have registered for the
summer quarter, according to the
Registrar's office.
Excluding from the 115 new Lower
Division men those who do not intend
to continue for another quarter and
those who have already been accepted
for next quarter, it is estimated that
between 90 and 100 men are trying to
place among the fifty who will be al
lowed to continue in the University in
the autumn on the basis of their sum
mer quarter records. No attempt will
be made to determine the exact num
ber of students trying for the privi
leged group until the early part of
August, when announcements will be
sent out asking students to declare
their intentions.
Because of the larger number of
students registered this year it is ex
pected that the competition will be
exceedingly keen. Selction of th fifty
will be based primarily on the scholas
tic record of the quarter, but. in the
final choice all previous records will
be given consideration.
