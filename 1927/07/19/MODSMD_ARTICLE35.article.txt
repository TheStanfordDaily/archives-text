# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, ’16 
If you happened to be numbered
among the 130,000 odd souls (some of
them were very odd) who sat through
the driving rain at the Sesqui Stadium
last September, you no doubt saw a
very athletic man of apparently thirty
five summers, who acted as one of the
champion's chief seconds. In many
ways he looked more like a champion
than Jack Dempsey himself did, and
you no doubt envied him his clear
skin, keen eyes, and bulging muscles.
(All this, of course, if you sat near
enough to see the aforementioned c. s.,
k. e„ and b. m.)
That man was Philadelphia Jack
O'Brien, former world's middleweight
champion, one of the scientific mar
vels of all time, a victor in 250 or more
ring battles! You'd never believe that
the big fellow is nearly fifty years
old, but he is, and years of careful
living and teaching others how to live
right and exercise right have kept
him in wonderful shape. Jack and his
younger brother run two successful
gymnasiums in New York City, and
by the "O'Brien's Health System, Inc.,"
impart their own vigor, health, and en
thusiasm to countless hundreds of
tired business men and worn-out ex
athletes.

Brothers have often achieved fame
in the prize ring, anil in the same
breath with the Gibbonses and the Sul
livans, mention must always be made
of the O'Briens. Joseph F. and John
T. Hagen were but two of a family of
twelve children, and John, arriving
nearly seventeen years after his old
est brother, couldn't be blamed for
patterning his career on that of Phila
delphia Jack O'Brien (for such was the
name that Joseph F. adopted) and call
ing himself "Young Jack O'Brien."
Between them they fought about
four hundred bouts—Big Jack taking
on such famous gladiators as Jim Jef
fries, Peter Maher, Joe Choynski,
Tommy Ryan, Jack (Twin) Sullivan,
Kid McCoy, Bob Fitzsimmons, Tommy
Burns, Stanley Ketchel, Jack Jo.hnson,
and Sam Langford; while Little Jack
fought such men as Ad Wolgast, Fred
dy Welsh, Ted Lewis, Kid Graves,
K. O. Brown, and Leach Cross. Jack
O'Brien never weighed over 159, while
Young Jack tipped the scales at from
130 to 138. Each having beaten a big
negro named Joe Butler, who weighed
240 pounds, they fought each other for
the family championship last winter,
and the 32-year-old O'Brien had to ad
mit that his 49-year old brother was
still there with his mitts.

delphia Jack O'Brien (for such was the
name that Joseph F. adopted) and call
ing himself "Young Jack O'Brien."
Between them they fought about
four hundred bouts—Big Jack taking
on such famous gladiators as Jim Jef
fries, Peter Maher, Joe Choynski,
Tommy Ryan, Jack (Twin) Sullivan,
Kid McCoy, Bob Fitzsimmons, Tommy
Burns, Stanley Ketchel, Jack Jo.hnson,
and Sam Langford; while Little Jack
fought such men as Ad Wolgast, Fred
dy Welsh, Ted Lewis, Kid Graves,
K. O. Brown, and Leach Cross. Jack
O'Brien never weighed over 159, while
Young Jack tipped the scales at from
130 to 138. Each having beaten a big
negro named Joe Butler, who weighed
240 pounds, they fought each other for
the family championship last winter,
and the 32-year-old O'Brien had to ad
mit that his 49-year old brother was
still there with his mitts.


The Brothers O'Brien
If you happened to be numbered
among the 130,000 odd souls (some of
them were very odd) who sat through
the driving rain at the Sesqui Stadium
last September, you no doubt saw a
very athletic man of apparently thirty
five summers, who acted as one of the
champion's chief seconds. In many
ways he looked more like a champion
than Jack Dempsey himself did, and
you no doubt envied him his clear
skin, keen eyes, and bulging muscles.
(All this, of course, if you sat near
enough to see the aforementioned c. s.,
k. e„ and b. m.)
That man was Philadelphia Jack
O'Brien, former world's middleweight
champion, one of the scientific mar
vels of all time, a victor in 250 or more
ring battles! You'd never believe that
the big fellow is nearly fifty years
old, but he is, and years of careful
living and teaching others how to live
right and exercise right have kept
him in wonderful shape. Jack and his
younger brother run two successful
gymnasiums in New York City, and
by the "O'Brien's Health System, Inc.,"
impart their own vigor, health, and en
thusiasm to countless hundreds of
tired business men and worn-out ex
athletes.

Brothers have often achieved fame
in the prize ring, anil in the same
breath with the Gibbonses and the Sul
livans, mention must always be made
of the O'Briens. Joseph F. and John
T. Hagen were but two of a family of
twelve children, and John, arriving
nearly seventeen years after his old
est brother, couldn't be blamed for
patterning his career on that of Phila
delphia Jack O'Brien (for such was the
name that Joseph F. adopted) and call
ing himself "Young Jack O'Brien."
