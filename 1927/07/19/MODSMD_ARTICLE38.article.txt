# POLO TEAM TO MAKE GOOD SHOWING THIS FALL WITH VETERANS
## Post and Thompson Back; McCabe Pleased With Prospects 
### 
With a record for 1 lie past year of
winning eight out of nine games, to
gether with the Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Championship, the Stanford
Polo team promises to make an equally
good showing for the coming year.
Wallace Rothrock, who played number
one, and Fred E. Trotter, who starred
at number four, will he lost from the
lineup, hut there are a number of ex
cellent players with varsity experience
to fill these positions.
Edward H. Post and Chauncey O.
Thompson, captain-elect, both veter
ans with a number of years of speedy
play to their credit, will furnish the
foundation upon which the team will
be built.
With the exception of a few private
mounts, most of the horses used by
the team to the Military De
partment. A government regulation,
which does not allow new horses to
be used for polo for one year, has kept
a number of good ponies out of the
game for the past year. These animals
will be brought into play next year
and will greatly speed up the game.
The college teams that will be met
are the University of Arizona, Oregon
Agricultural College, and the Univer
sity of Washington. Last year was
Washington's first year of collegiate
polo, as the beating they received from
Stanford would indicate. The score
was 25 to 0.
Games will also be scheduled with a
number of private teams. Among them
are the Thirtieth Infantry team from
the Presidio at San Francisco, the
Artillery and Cavalry teams from
Monterey, and one or two of the San
Mateo teams.
Colonel E. R. W. McCabe, who was
recently put in command of the Stan
ford R.0.T.C., is greatly pleased with
the prospects for next year. An old
player at the game himself, Colonel
McCabe promises to do much to in
crease the support and popularity of
polo at Stanford.
