# RUSSIAN ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR PLEASES AT SUNDAY CONCERT
## Second Program Features Schubert, Brahms, And Soriabin 
### 
"Divine Poem," the third symphony
of Soriahin, was the closing number
on Sunday afternoon's program given
by the San Francisco Summer Sym
phony. It was also the single Russian
piece. The program offered two Schu
bert numbers, the Overture to "Rosa
munde" and the "Unfinished Sym
phony," and the "Academic Festival
Overture," a student medley by
Brahms.
The concert was one of a series held
on Sunday afternoons in the Wood
land Theatre at Hillsborough, under
the auspices of the Philharmonic So
ciety of San Mateo County.
This concert, like the one before it,
"was conducted by Ossip Gabrilowitsch.
Mr. Gabrilowitsch is more favored by
music critics than any other conductor
in this country. His orchestral achieve
ment is the consumation of an exten
sive career.
Ossip Gabrilowitsch is a Russian,
and he received the better part of his
musical education at the Petrograd
Conservatory, where he studied with
Anton Rubinstein and won the Rubin
stein Prize. His later studies were di
rected by Leschetizsky at Vienna. He
made his debut as a concert pianist
with the Nikisch Orchestra in Berlin.
In 1909, he married Clara Clemens,
one of Mark Twain's daughters, and
her career as a concert singer reached
iits height in joint recitals with her
husband. Mr. Gabrilowitsch has been
almost exclusively a conductor of
orchestras for the last ten years.
