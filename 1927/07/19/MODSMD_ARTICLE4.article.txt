# Moser Starts Survey of Stanford Water Facilities For Future Development
## 
### 
A special study of the water distri
bution system on the campus is now
under way by Professor Charles Moser,
of the Engineering Department. Pro
fessor Moser is conducting the first
step toward a campaign contemplated
in the future for improving the water
facilities used at the University, ac
cording to Comptroller Roth.
James W. McDonnel, superintendent
of buildings and yards, says that "no
increase in planted area can be con
templated until the present supply of
irrigation water is increased." The
present supply is barely sufficient to
keep the plants growing which help
give the Stanford campus its distinc
tive beauty.
Will Enlarge Pump
Some relief of the water scarcity on
the irrigation system is planned for

the near future through the installa
tion of a large pump at Searsville
Lake. The pump has already arrived
and will be installed as soon as pos
sible. McDonnel says that the pump
should double the pressure on the sup
ply lines and thus bring more water
to the campus.
"Although no scarcity of water ex
ists at present on the domestic supply
system there is no over abundance.
In case it becomes necessary to in
crease the present supply on account
of the new residences now being built
two excellent water wells may be
switched in from above the Conva
lescent Home grounds.
Two Systems for Fires
A particular feature of the dual
water supply system which the Uni
versity maintains at present is of
