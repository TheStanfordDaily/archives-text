# LAW DEPARTMENT HAS EVENING OUTING WITH SPEECHES, BARBECUE
## 
### 
Forgetting for the moment their j
studies, fifty law students and faculty
members attended the Law Associa- j
tion barbecue last evening at Sears- j
ville Lake, where they enjoyed Sam
McDonald's barbecue dinner and an
interesting program.
Several cars left the Law Steps with
the group at 5 o'clock. Upon arrival
at the lake, the crowd was entertained
with fancy diving by Dave Fall, Stan j
ford swimmer and diver. The call then
came for all to appear at the pit where
the barbecue dinner was waiting.
Acting Dean William B. Owens then
took charge of the meeting and intro-1
duced the speakers. Four of the visit-1
ing professors were present and gave j
short talks. The speakers were Pro- '
fessor William E. Britton of the Uni
versity of Illinois, Orrin K. McMurray
of the University of California, Rich
ard 11. B. Powell of Columbia Univer- j
sity, and William C. Van Vleck of
George Washington University, all of
whom commented on the high stand
ing of the Stanford Law School.
This barbecue took the place of the
usual banquet and smoker that the
Law Association has had in past-sum
mers.
