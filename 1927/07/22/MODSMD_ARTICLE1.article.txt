# JORDAN TELLS OF STANFORD MEN IN DID DASIN PARK
## He and Early Professors Helped Bring About State Purchase PRAISES CHARLES B. WING Calls Reservation One of Finest Redwood Stands In Country 
### 
Big Basin, the chief point of interest
in the automobile trip tomorrow, is not
only one of the finest bodies of un
touched redwoods in existence but also
an outstanding example of California's
policy of preserving her forests and
creating state parks, according to
Chancellor Emeritus Jordan.
The creation and development of
the Big Basin as a state park has been
due to a group of enthusiasts among
-whom Stanford men have taken a con
spicuous part. Dr. Jordan himself was
among the early leaders in this group
and it was he who persuaded the gov
ernor of the state to sign the bill for
the purchase of the central area of
'fhe park by the state about twenty
seven years ago.
Professor Dudley a Leader
This group, in which the late Wil
liam R. Dudley, first professor of bot
any at Stanford, was a chief figure,
hoped to find somebody who would
Tbuy the plot and present it to the state.
Failing to discover such a purchaser,
they caused a bill to be passed by the
legislature for its purchase by public
funds.
There were other forestry measures
before the governor but Dr. Jordan
argued that these other needs could
be more safely deferred than the secur
ing of Big Basin, which was in immi- j
nent danger of being lumbered.
"The management of the park was j
put into the hands of a commission of j
which Professor Dudley and Professor
Charles B. Wing, still head of our civil
engineering department, were leading
members," Dr. Jordan recalls, explain
ing the growth of the park.
Professor Wing Builds Roads
Dudley died in 1913, and Wing was
put at the head of the commission. He |
developed the accessibility of the park !
to the people who used it as a recrea
tion center by improving the roads. I
and in every way showed unusual skill
and devotion in his management of the
park until he was released by Gover
nor Richardson a little less than four
years ago in the course of the gover
nor's political program. The governor j
extended no thanks to Wing for his j
services.
"The park comprises a magnificent J
stand of great redwoods, some of j
which are twenty feet and more in ;
diameter, and 2000 years old."

Professor Dudley a Leader
This group, in which the late Wil
liam R. Dudley, first professor of bot
any at Stanford, was a chief figure,
hoped to find somebody who would
Tbuy the plot and present it to the state.
Failing to discover such a purchaser,
they caused a bill to be passed by the
legislature for its purchase by public
funds.
There were other forestry measures
before the governor but Dr. Jordan
argued that these other needs could
be more safely deferred than the secur
ing of Big Basin, which was in immi- j
nent danger of being lumbered.
"The management of the park was j
put into the hands of a commission of j
which Professor Dudley and Professor
Charles B. Wing, still head of our civil
engineering department, were leading
members," Dr. Jordan recalls, explain
ing the growth of the park.
Professor Wing Builds Roads
Dudley died in 1913, and Wing was
put at the head of the commission. He |
developed the accessibility of the park !
to the people who used it as a recrea
tion center by improving the roads. I
and in every way showed unusual skill
and devotion in his management of the
park until he was released by Gover
nor Richardson a little less than four
years ago in the course of the gover
nor's political program. The governor j
extended no thanks to Wing for his j
services.
"The park comprises a magnificent J
stand of great redwoods, some of j
which are twenty feet and more in ;
diameter, and 2000 years old."
