# WORK WILL START ON ASSEMBLY HALL AFTER NEXT PLAY
## Approximately $10,000 Will Be Cost of Repairs To Be Made CEILING STRAIGHTENED New Lights Installed; Hall Should Be Ready for Use by October 1 
### 
Approximately $10,000 will be spent
on improvements 011 the Assembly
Hall between August, 1 and the open
ing of the Autumn Quarter. Immedi
ately following the play to be giveti oil
July 29, work will commence on a new
ceiling and on the complete redecora
tion of the upper parts of the Assem
bly Hall.
The barren arches which now com
pose the ceiling of the hall will be
covered by a light brown material of
special acoustical properties which
will have the effect of eliminating
echoes. It will be so applied as to
straighten out the present curves iu
the ceiling.
New Lighting Considered
Plans for installing the best modern
lighting system obtainable are being:
considered at present. Installation can
not be started, however, until the ceil
ing is practically finished. Orders have
already been placed for lighting fix
tures which should furnish much more
light and at the same time give the
interior of the building a highly
artistical effect.
j Comptroller Roth states that "just,
as soon as the play is over men will
be set to work erecting a scaffold from
which the work will be carried on."
A large crew of workmen will be em
ployed throughout the remainder of
I the summer in order to bring the work
: to completion before October 1.
"Blind Sections" Left
The "blind sections" of the balcony
cannot be eliminated while the im
provements are under way. This is im
possible at present as it would require
a complete re-arrangement of the
building itself. No structural changes
j of any kind are being contemplated
i other than that of eliminating some
of the arches by applying a straighter
ceiling.
Instead of having the work on the
Assembly Hall done by contract, the
j University has decided to have the
work done under the supervision ot its
own architects, Bakewell and Brown.
