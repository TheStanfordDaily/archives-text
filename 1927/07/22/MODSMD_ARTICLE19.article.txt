# OAKLAND SCHOOLMAN SAYS AVERAGE HOME AIDS CRIME WAVE
## 
### 
The average American home contrib
utes toward the crime wave which has
swept the country, said Frederick M.
Hunter, superintendent of city schools,
Oakland, in an address at the school
men's weekly luncheon yesterday. He
called upon the schoolmen to make an
ally of the home and to help remedy the
existing conditions.
The speaker pointed out five instances
in which he said the home failed. Par
ents pay too little attention to the com
panionships which their children are
forming; there is a lack of judgment and
guidance in the reading of children; par
ents neglect to guard against their chil
dren choosing sensational amusements;
the sex questions are not answered by
the parents; and parents are careless in
the matter of respect for the constitu
tion.
This week's gathering was in charge
of R. V. Hunkins, superintendent of
schools, Lead, South Dakota, represent
ing the middle western states. Three
musical numbers were given by H. R.
Woodward, R. D. Case, G. G. Stewart,
and F. P. Isensee, whom the chairman
introduced as the "Cowboy Quartet."
