# Learning Process Depends On Behavior, Says Koffka
## 
### 
The learning process consists in modi
fications of behavior, said Professor
Koffka, in an address to psychologists
Wednesday night.
Memory is not the only factor in the
modifications of behavior, he said. There
must be a new element, whcli he chose
to call achievement.
He cited illustrations to show that
learning was the perception of a group
of objects in relation to one another
rather than the sum of individual ob
jects. In other words, we learn by the
perception of forms or patterns, hence
the German proponents of this theory
have applied to it the name Gestalt or
configuration.
