# Many Attend Roble Club Tea Held Last Tuesday Afternoon
## 
### 
Roble Club again served tea last
Tuesday afternoon from 4 to 5:30. This
was the most successful of the teas
as more than one hundred were pres
ent. It was held in the lobby of Roble
Hall.
These weekly teas are informal. Stu
dents rome directly from class and
have a social hour together. Often
they are held on the lawn in front of
Roble. The teas are for both men and
women.
