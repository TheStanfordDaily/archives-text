# Theatre Improvements
## 
### 
Supporters of Stanford dramatic productions now have in sight the
long-hoped-for time when they may buy a ticket for a campus play and
expect to hear, as well as see, the actors on the stage.
The effectiveness of Stanford dramatic offerings will be materially
strengthened by the improvement in acoustics which will result from the
alterations on the ceiling of the Assembly Hall.
This is as much as can be done with the present building. The next
move will be a new theatre.
