# First Assembly of Quarter
## 
### 
Next Wednesday classes will be suspended for an hour in order that
the whole student body may gather in the Assembly Hall to hear L>r.
Alonzo Taylor on some of his ideas in connection with the economic
conference in which he recently participated at Geneva. The assembly
is worth while not only on account of what Dr. Taylor can tell, but also
because it provides an occasion for the whole student body to get
together in one place. There is actual though intangible value in thus
for once having the chance to see our whole group gathered for a common
purpose.
