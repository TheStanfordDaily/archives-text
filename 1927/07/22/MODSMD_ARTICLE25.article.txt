There is no reason to fear an epidemic of infantile paralysis on the
campus. The disease has made its appearance in various parts of the
state, and parents have been warned to be extremely careful of their
children. For those who have passed the age of childhood, however, the
likelihood of attack is slight. It is sound sense for everybody to avoid
close association with people who are not in the best of health and to
.see a doctor promptly about any symptoms of illness. Otherwise the
thing to do is to go about our business in our usual way.
