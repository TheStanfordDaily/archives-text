# FIRST TERM ENDS NEXT SATURDAY BUT WORK KEEPS ON
## Only 266 Plan to Finish Nowâ€”No Pause for Examinations 
### 
The first term of the quarter will end
Saturday, July 30, but the end of the
first term and the beginning of the
second will have practical significance
to only a comparatively small number
of students. For the great majority,
classroom Avork will run along as if
there were no terms, although some
professors may give examinations Fri
day and Saturday to all their students
as well as to the few who are com
pleting work at that time.
Of the total of 1378 students in the
student body now, only 266 are en
rolled for the first term alone, 1112
being registered for the full quarter.
Some of those who registered for the
first term may change their minds and
enroll for the second. None are admit
ted for the second term only except
under exceptional circumstances.
The Law School, which conducts its
summer quarter classes on the basis
of two halves of exactly equal length,
will conclude its first half tomorrow,
and begin the second Monday.
Final examinations in the Law
School are in progerss now. In gen
eral. final examinations for those com
pleting their work with the first term
will be held Friday and Saturday of
next week, but there will be no inter
ruption of the regular schedule for the
purpose, as there is at the end of the
quarter.
