# STAR SPRINTER TO ENTER AS FRESHMAN IN AUTUMN QUARTER
## 
### 
Leslie â€ž Hables, the sensational
sprinter of the King City high school,
will enter Stanford this fall.
Hables has been credited with bet
ter than even times in both the hun
dred and two-twenty. In the North
Coast Section track meet, held in the
Stanford stadium last April, he won
easily both sprint races in the face
of an annoying wind with times of
10.2 seconds in the century and 22.6
seconds in the furlong.
Hables is a natural runner with no
finish of form. His start is poor, but,
once he is clear of the holes, he is
remarkably aggressive. These charac
teristics stamp him as being far more
formidable in the longer dash. It is
rumored that Coach R, L. "Dink" Tem
pleton will make over Hables from a
sprinter to a quarter-miler. In either
capacity the King City boy will be a
welcome asset to next spring's frosh
track team, and, with some finishing
by T.mpieton, should make a name
for himself on the varsity in the fol
lowing three years.
