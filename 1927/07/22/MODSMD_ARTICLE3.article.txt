# "Dishonest" Movie Organs Explained by W.D. Allen
## 
### 
"The Modern Organ" was discussed
by Warren D. Allen in the gallery of the
Memorial Church yesterday afternoon,
and the organ was used to illustrate the
points which Mr. Allen made in explain
ing and describing the construction of
the organ.
The popularity of organs in theatres
has caused the production of "dishonest
organs," whose loud blare of sound is
expected to cover a multitude of de
ficiencies in construction. To bring out
this point better, Mr. Allen said that
while the organ in the church here is
comparatively a small one, which it is
hoped will be bigger some day, the largest
theatre organ in San Francisco has but
thirty sets of stops, while here there are
sixty. â€¢
Mr. Allen gave a brief history of the
organ and explained the "families of
tones," and showed the pipes which pro
duce them, carrying out all the while a
comparison between a symphony orches
tra and the organ. In conclusion he played
two selections, "The Swan, by Saint-
Saens, and a Bach Choral Prelude, in
order that the audience might see the
origan in action.
