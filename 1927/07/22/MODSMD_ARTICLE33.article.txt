Clarity of thought and capacity to con
centrate on a subject to the exclusion of

tributed much to Lincoln's success, ac

, President at the Little Theatre Tuesday

"Lincoln's greatest obstacle in life was
' that he was extremely temperamental.
His greatest asset was his mind," he said.
"Clear, profound, insistent thinking
were characteristic of the man, although
he did not work consistently. He did
| great quantities of work in fits and
| starts.
"At his death no one in America was
better educated. Clarity of thought
marked his intelligence. He could con
centrate to the point of trances, to the
exclusion of the outside world. He would
put his whole power in one subject, relax
for a while, then start anew."
Lincoln concentrated his ambition on
democracy as it is represented by the
I United States constitution. This was his
j ideal in life.
As a final consideration of Lincoln as
| a statesman of democracy, Professor
! Fish told of his skill as a political leader.
! In the first place, he knew his district
! man for man, and kept in touch with
j them. Further he used extreme care in
■ speaking. Every word he uttered was
written and gone over beforehand. "He
may have been careless in his dress," he
declared, "but his words were always in
dress suits." Finally, Lincoln could radi
ate his personality, he w ? as extremely
j sure of himself. He treated the corner
i "cop" the same as the ambassador from
j England.
| Although scandal mongers are always
j at work trying to dig up something sen
| sational about a great character, there is
not much danger of them harming the
memory of Lincoln, because serious
thinkers and scholars will protect it, he
said.
