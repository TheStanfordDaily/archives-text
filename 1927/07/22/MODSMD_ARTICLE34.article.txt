# DROP-KICK SLOWLY DISAPPEARING FROM FOOTBALL, IS BELIEF
## Coach Sprague States That Place-Kickers Easier To Develop 
### 
That the drop-kick, the most diffi
cult and certainly one of the most
spectacular weapons for scoring points
in football, is being slowly eliminated
from the modern gridiron game is the
opinion of a number of American
coaches. The new ruling which causes
the goal posts to be put back out of
the way and the gradual disappearance
of the U!-;e of the drop-kick all tend to
lead in that direction.
C. M. Sprague of Stanford, who has
helped coach freshman football for
the past two years, states:
"Neither the drop-kick nor the place
kick hold the same place in football
that they have previously held and the
former is gradually disappearing, not
because it is ineffective, but because
there is no one able to handle it well
enough to make it worth while. A good
drop-kicker is not developed in a year
or two but must train from the time
he is a young boy. If a coach has
neither a good drop-kicker nor a place
kicker he should develop a place
kicker and let the drop-kick alone.
Drop-Kick Easy to Defend
"Each has its own advantages, the
drop-kick leaves one more man for the
defense of the kicker and it takes
less time to execute than the place
kick. However, the place-kick is more
certain to score and is the easiest to
develop."
The 1027 rules state that the goal
posts must be 10 yards behind the
goal line, but where the trouble lies is
not in the fact that the goal posts are
being moved back but that the num
ber of men able to drop-kick the ball
over those same goal posts is rapidly
disappearing. Drop-kicking in the Pa
cific Coast Conference teams has be
come something of a lost art.
Templeton a Great Kicker
Rack in 1919, the most spectacular
threat on the Stanford team was
"Dink" Templeton, who could regu
larly boot the ball over from the 40-
yard mark. Templeton's 45-yard drop
kick defeated Washington, 3 to 0, the
same year, and again in the California
game a drop-kick of Templeton's gave
Stanford a 3 to 0 lead at the end of the
first quarter which paved the way for
the Cardinal's final offense which near
ly turned defeat into victory.
Stagg Backs Drop-Kicking
Alonzo Stagg, head coach at the Uni
versity of Chicago, says: "Look over
the field goal records and you will find
about three men who have drop-kicked
the ball from over 60 yards away. Al
most two dozen have kicked goals
from 50 yards or more. About six
dozen have booted the ball from be
tween 40 and 50 yards away. About
one hundred are on record as having
made drop-kicks of from 30 to 40 yards.
And I venture to say that fully half
of these kicks traveled 5 or 10 yards
further than was necessary. A good
kicker will still be useful any time
his team gets the ball within 30 yards
of the goal line, even with the posts
set back 10 yards under the 1927
rules."

from the modern gridiron game is the
opinion of a number of American
coaches. The new ruling which causes
the goal posts to be put back out of
the way and the gradual disappearance
of the U!-;e of the drop-kick all tend to
lead in that direction.
C. M. Sprague of Stanford, who has
helped coach freshman football for
the past two years, states:
"Neither the drop-kick nor the place
kick hold the same place in football
that they have previously held and the
former is gradually disappearing, not
because it is ineffective, but because
there is no one able to handle it well
enough to make it worth while. A good
drop-kicker is not developed in a year
or two but must train from the time
he is a young boy. If a coach has
neither a good drop-kicker nor a place
kicker he should develop a place
kicker and let the drop-kick alone.
Drop-Kick Easy to Defend
"Each has its own advantages, the
drop-kick leaves one more man for the
defense of the kicker and it takes
less time to execute than the place
kick. However, the place-kick is more
certain to score and is the easiest to
develop."
The 1027 rules state that the goal
posts must be 10 yards behind the
goal line, but where the trouble lies is
not in the fact that the goal posts are
being moved back but that the num
ber of men able to drop-kick the ball
over those same goal posts is rapidly
disappearing. Drop-kicking in the Pa
cific Coast Conference teams has be
come something of a lost art.
Templeton a Great Kicker
Rack in 1919, the most spectacular
threat on the Stanford team was
"Dink" Templeton, who could regu
larly boot the ball over from the 40-
yard mark. Templeton's 45-yard drop
kick defeated Washington, 3 to 0, the
same year, and again in the California
game a drop-kick of Templeton's gave
Stanford a 3 to 0 lead at the end of the
first quarter which paved the way for
the Cardinal's final offense which near
ly turned defeat into victory.
Stagg Backs Drop-Kicking
Alonzo Stagg, head coach at the Uni
versity of Chicago, says: "Look over
the field goal records and you will find
about three men who have drop-kicked
the ball from over 60 yards away. Al
most two dozen have kicked goals
from 50 yards or more. About six
dozen have booted the ball from be
tween 40 and 50 yards away. About
one hundred are on record as having
made drop-kicks of from 30 to 40 yards.
And I venture to say that fully half
of these kicks traveled 5 or 10 yards
further than was necessary. A good
kicker will still be useful any time
his team gets the ball within 30 yards
of the goal line, even with the posts
set back 10 yards under the 1927
rules."
That the drop-kick, the most diffi
cult and certainly one of the most
spectacular weapons for scoring points
in football, is being slowly eliminated
from the modern gridiron game is the
opinion of a number of American
coaches. The new ruling which causes
the goal posts to be put back out of
