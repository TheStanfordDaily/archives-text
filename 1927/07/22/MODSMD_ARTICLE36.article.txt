# KOFFKA CHALLENGES SUPERIORITY OF MIND OVER PHYSICAL BODY
## 
### 
"What right have we to call the
mind superior to the body? The body,
I am sorry to say, lies much less fre
quently than the soul —there is a deep
truth in physiognomy." These were the j
closing words of Kurt Koffka, German ;
psychoanalyst and writer, on Wednes-1
day afternoon in the Assembly Hall.
"We assume," he remarked, "(hat <
the mind is the higher form of being,
the form nearer God —that the soul is i
pure—whereas the body is a low form :
akin to brute nature. We think of the j
mind as good, of the body as evil."
Air. Koffka's lecture had been in
tended for the Little Theatre, but his j
audience outgraw the hall and ad- j
journed to fill all but the balcony of ■■
the Assembly Hall.
Close Intercommunication
Mr. Koffka defined and criticized j
two rival interpretations of the corre-;
lation between the mind and the body. |
"Whatever the mind is," he asserted, j
"and whatever the body, we find close
intercommunication, and an intimate,
connection.
"Unless you believe in telepathy,
and I do not," said Mr. Koffka, "you
cannot assume a direct communication
from spirit to spirit. Human inter- j
course is dependent on impressions re
ceived by the senses."
He denied that the intelligence re
fers to past experience when it inter
prets expressions and gestures. "We
do not perceive stimuli, but we per
ceive on account of stimuli. We do
not know what we see until we have
studied what we see." What we see is
not a collection of lines and colors
associated from experience. What we
see is an arrangement—an order —of
lines and colors, and we appreciate
order before we appreciate details.
Order and Association
Mr. Koffka found in "order" an ex- j
planation of the mystery. "Order," he ;
said, "is inherent in physical nature I
as in the world of the intellect. We j
must assume that the physiological j
world is ordered in a similar way to ;
that in which the mental world is j
ordered; the intellectual function of!
association has its physiological phase.
If we could drop the assumption that
mind and body are incompatible, the
problem would look much simpler.
"You can call them neither two sub
stances nor one substance —for you
must not think of them in terms of j
substance. But they are organized into ;
a whole. If events in the body are j
ordered in themselves, what is more i
plausible to assume than that the'
order is the same on both sides."

psychoanalyst and writer, on Wednes-1
day afternoon in the Assembly Hall.
"We assume," he remarked, "(hat <
the mind is the higher form of being,
the form nearer God —that the soul is i
pure—whereas the body is a low form :
akin to brute nature. We think of the j
mind as good, of the body as evil."
Air. Koffka's lecture had been in
tended for the Little Theatre, but his j
audience outgraw the hall and ad- j
journed to fill all but the balcony of ■■
the Assembly Hall.
Close Intercommunication
Mr. Koffka defined and criticized j
two rival interpretations of the corre-;
lation between the mind and the body. |
"Whatever the mind is," he asserted, j
"and whatever the body, we find close
intercommunication, and an intimate,
connection.
"Unless you believe in telepathy,
and I do not," said Mr. Koffka, "you
cannot assume a direct communication
from spirit to spirit. Human inter- j
course is dependent on impressions re
ceived by the senses."
He denied that the intelligence re
fers to past experience when it inter
prets expressions and gestures. "We
do not perceive stimuli, but we per
ceive on account of stimuli. We do
not know what we see until we have
studied what we see." What we see is
not a collection of lines and colors
associated from experience. What we
see is an arrangement—an order —of
lines and colors, and we appreciate
order before we appreciate details.
Order and Association
Mr. Koffka found in "order" an ex- j
planation of the mystery. "Order," he ;
said, "is inherent in physical nature I
as in the world of the intellect. We j
must assume that the physiological j
world is ordered in a similar way to ;
that in which the mental world is j
ordered; the intellectual function of!
association has its physiological phase.
If we could drop the assumption that
mind and body are incompatible, the
problem would look much simpler.
"You can call them neither two sub
stances nor one substance —for you
must not think of them in terms of j
substance. But they are organized into ;
a whole. If events in the body are j
ordered in themselves, what is more i
plausible to assume than that the'
order is the same on both sides."
"What right have we to call the
mind superior to the body? The body,
I am sorry to say, lies much less fre
quently than the soul —there is a deep
truth in physiognomy." These were the j
closing words of Kurt Koffka, German ;
psychoanalyst and writer, on Wednes-1
day afternoon in the Assembly Hall.
