Professor E. A. Cottrell, head of the
Department of Political Science at
Stanford, spoke at the Thursday
luncheon on Civic Development of
Cities. Professor Cottrell brought out
jn his talk that it is not the form of
city government that, keeps so many
cities from making the progress they
should, but the manner in which that
government is handled. He stated that
too many petty politicians, each work
ing for his own financial good, is the
greatest handicap to the development
of a city.
Cottrell Leader in Movement
Professor Cottrell was the leader of
the movement to combine the original
school with Stanford University which
resulted in the present school which is
known as the Western School for Com
mercial Secretaries.
Last night the school held its annual
"High Jinx," and tonight the "Speak
ing Contest" will be held.
