# ERECT BOXES, RING, LIGHTS ON DIAMOND FOR HORSE EXHIBIT
## Additional Stalls for Horses Are Also Under Construction 
### 
Stanford's old baseball field has been
supplanted by a fully equipped, regula
tion sized horse show park. Around the
ring, which is situated directly in front
of the baseball grandstand, 268 boxes
have been constructed, making the total
seating capacity 4,(X)CI seats. Painters
have already started to work and all that
remains to be done is to place the seats.
The ring will be illuminated by sev
enty-five 500-watt arc lights, while
throughout the grounds and stables more
than 2,200 seventy-five- watt lamps will
be used. It has been estimated that the
illumination will require 70,(XX) watts of
electricity an hour.
Two hundred and twenty-five tempo
rary box and tie stalls are being con
structed to take care of a part of the
several hundred horses entered in the
show. The remainder will be housed in
the Artillery sheds and the R.O.T.C.
stables. For the storage of the various
rigs, carriages, and racing gigs, a large
tent, 300 feet by 60 feet, will be put up.
Miss Ruth Landsburgh, a Stanford
student, has entered several thorough
breds in the show. Among them will be
Whose What, winner of the $2,000 stake
for jumpers at last year's Oakland show.
