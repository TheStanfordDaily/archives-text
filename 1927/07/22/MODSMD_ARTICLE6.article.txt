## 
### 
Louis P. Fales, who entered Stanford
this quarter, died at his home in Liver
more Wednesday of infantile paralysis,
after a brief illness. He complained of
feeling unwell Sunday evening and on
Tuesday was so much worse that he was
taken to Livermore, where he died the
next day.
Fales was a graduate of Livermore
High School and played a prominent
part in school activities, being a member
of the football and debating teams. His
father is a well known physician of
Livermore affiliated with the United
States Veterans Hospital in that city.
Four cases of infantile paralysis have
been reported in Palo Alto, but no others
on the campus. As a measure of pre
caution, Fales' room-mate in Encina Hall
has been isolated, and the boys' swim
ming classes in Encina pool have been
temporarily discontinued.
Both the Palo Alto and the campus
health authorities say that there is no
cause for great alarm over the appear
ance of the disease. There is little likli
hood of persons who have passed child
hood becoming victims, but it is advis
able for all to avoid contact with per
sons who are sick, and to consult a
physician promptly if they themselves
do not feel entirely well.
