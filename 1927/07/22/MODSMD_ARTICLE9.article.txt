# 'LOYALTIES'A PLAY OF MAN OUTSIDE AGAINST INSIDER
## Issue Is Between Social Climber and English Club Member STARTS WITH MYSTERY Crime in Country House Begins Dramatic Plot 
### 
The eternal conflict of the outsider
and the Insider, the conflict of loyalty
to oneself and loyalty to one's friend,
these furnish the theme for John Gals
worthy in his drama, "Loyalties,"
which is being presented in the Stan
ford Assembly Hall Friday, July 29,
under the direction of Gordon Davis.
The plot revolves about Ferdinand
De Levis, taken by Ray Haizlip, and
Captain Ronald Dancy, D.5.0., taken
by Sam Hayes. De Levis, being a Jew,
is the outsider, Dancy, the insider. One
critic has aptly put it as a duel be
tween "a Merchant of London and a
Merchant of Venice."
Starting out like "The Bat" or "The
Cat and the Canary," with a mysteri
ous crime in a country house, "Loyal
ties" reveals the clumsy devices and
false clues of those pieces and keeps
to its central theme of loyalty, logi
cally and simply. There are three
kinds of logic, the logic of the social
idea, the logic of melodrama, and the
logic of the loyalty theme.
Class prejudice, books are written
about it, about its evils, about Its con
sequences. Yet it remains, and is prac
tically as strong as it ever was, Gals
worthy believes and brings out in this
play. The Jew, feeling the injustice of
his position, fights his cause like a
cornered animal, getting nothing but
the vindication of his own views. The ,
gehtile, a distinguished captain of the j
British army, a well-liked clubman, j
plays a blind man's bluff. He cannotj
be satisfied with the "tame-cat" life.
Thus he involves all his friends, and
they have faith in him.
Conflict of Loyalties
But in his friends there arises, then, j
the conflict of loyalty to one man, or
the others to their club. There is at the j
loyalty to manyâ€”one to his profession,
last the conflict within his wife, Mabel,
of whether or not to stick to him.
Shall she face shame, disgrace, dis
honor, or shall she be disloyal?
There are, in fact, so many con- '
diets in the play that it is almost im
possible to enumerate them. Grant i
Overton, critic for the Bookman, says, !
"In this drama, as in all his novels,
and all his other dramas, Mr. Gals- '
worthy is constantly seeing and por- !
traying how conflicting loyalties both j
are right; he is forever presenting the
two or more sides and taking none." i
