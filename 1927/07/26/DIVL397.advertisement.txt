PERSONAL HYGIENE FOR WOMEN
By Clelia Duel Mosher, M.D.
Associate Professor of Personal Hygiene and Medical Adviser of Women,
Stanford University
Many teachers and students are already familiar with Dr. Mosher's
! writings on personal hygiene. Her latest book, just published, con

physical weaknesses. Her rules for health, based on long experience,
are few, simple, and eminently practical. The woman who believes in
j the ability of herself and her sex to meet present-day conditions will
I find Dr. Mosher's counsel invaluable as a guide to physical freedom.
