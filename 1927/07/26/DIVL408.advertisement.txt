A Big Picture Done in a Big Way
"THE ROUGH RIDERS"
The great story of the Spanish-American War with Frank Hooper as

Happy Joe, and Charles Farrell and Mary Astor. This is one of the
big specials of the year but there will be no advance in admission prices.
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, JULY 28-29
COLLEEN MOORE in
"NAUGHTY BUT NICE"
Vivacious, peppy, devil-may-care Colleen, in a idle that will make you
like her all the more! She puts the finishing touches to a finishing
school! A delicious concoction of Moore merriment! Adapted from
Lewis Allen Browne's "The Bigamists."
Enjoyable short reels and EDDIE LOVE with his New Stanford
Band in a stage act, "DELIGHTED"
SATURDAY, JULY 30—ONE DAY ONLY
The Big Grin and Chuckle Man, JOHNNY HINES, in
"WHITE PANTS WILLIE"
Adapted from Elmer Davies' Liberty Magazine story. From greasy
overalls to breezy flannels. He knew that clothes made the man, but
he had no idea a pair of white pants would make him a ladies' man!
It's Johnny's funniest—made to order for the whole family!
