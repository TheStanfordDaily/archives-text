I and the tournament will be brought to
I clore around August 3.
With the quarter finals of the intra
mural tennis tournament coming to a
close this week, eight men are left to
decide the contestants of the semi
finals. Out of these eight, Joseph Cas
tellanos looms as one of the most
probable victors. He has been playing
on the varsity for the past year and
ranked sixth on last year's team.
Coach "Hal" Davis expects his rank
ing to reach third or fourth this com
ing year. He plays a fast, hard game
and will be very difficult to beat.
Castellanos, however, will have to
play his fastest and hardest game to
defeat any of his seven opponents that
are vying for the final victory.
Bashor a Favorite
Eli Bashor, last year a professor at
San Mateo Junior College, is another
.strong favorite to reach the finals. His
drives are by 110 means terrific but
his game is exceptionally steady and
•consistent.
Leighton Bledsoe is a graduate stu
■dent and also ranked on the varsity
last year. His game is hard and con
sistent, and he covers the ground to a
■great advantage.
Trainer Wallace Denny is expected
to stand on his feet against any ter
rific game with his slow, accurate, and
exceedingly consistent placement. He
possesses an uncanny eye for accu
racy and usually wears his opponent
out in the first set.
Takazo Domoto, a Japanese player,
is, characteristic of his race, excep
tionally fast. His game, however, has
I not the perfection of his more experi
i enced opponents.
■ LaChapelle Has Good Game
Paul A. LaChapelle, a freshman, is
j playing a very good game. He elimi
nated his third-round opponent in a
decisive fashion and is expected to
i force his way at least to the semi
j finals.
Byron R. Snow is an exceptionally
! hard player, one who uever lets up on
j his game from start to finish. He is a
I graduate student and has had much
experience in the tennis game. His
technique will be hard to conquer.
' The tournament, from the third
round on, will be divided into an upper
and lower division including Bashor,
Denny, Bledsoe, and Domoto in the
upper division, and Castellanos, Snow,
LaChapelle and the winner of the yet
undecided match of the third round in
