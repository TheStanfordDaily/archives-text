Came to Stanford in 1892
Professor Lenox came to Stanford
as assistant professor in 1892, the sec
ond year of the University, a young
man less than thirty years old who
had already shown his ability in an
intensively active career.
He had been graduated from Colum

time, and besides teaching chemistry
at Lehigh University during that time,
had held a number of positions with
industrial companies and with the
â€¢U.S. Navy. Before his graduation he
had been assistant chemist for the
Bethlehem Steel Company. From 1888
to 1892 he was chief chemist with the
Conkling Iron Company and in 1891-92
he was chemist with the Allan Cement
Company and during that same period
was chemist in the ordnance depart
ment of the navy.
Establishes Chemistry Fellowship
In 1921 Professor Lenox established
a fellowship in chemistry, with an an
nual stipend of $600, to be awarded by
the department to a candidate for the
doctor's degree in his second year of
advanced work. The University au
thorities in accepting this gift named
the fellowship the Lionel Remond
Lenox fellowship in his honor.
In his thirty-five years of teaching
at Stanford Professor Lenox has won
a place of great personal affection
among his students, several of whom
are now members of the faculty here.
He has been interested primarily in
teaching and, especially in recent
years, has published comparatively
little, although he has continued his
research work to a degree.
Would Have Retired in Three Years
Professor Lenox was 62 years old
and would have retired in three years.
He is survived by his widow, who as
an advanced student, collaborated

I with him for several years in research
: work before their marriage last year,
and by a son by a previous marriage,
Lionel Tracy Lenox, who was at one
time a student at Stanford and is now
I a banker at Campbell.
