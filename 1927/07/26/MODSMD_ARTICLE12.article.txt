# BRITAIN'S LIBERAL SPIRIT STILL EXISTS ROBINSON DECLARES
## History Professor Returns From Year's Tour Of Europe 
### 
The traditional liberal spirit of the
British so prevalent before the war
still exists, but its maintenance has
to be fought for, said Edgar E. Robin
son, Professor of American History
and Director of Citizenship, in giving
the impression he obtained on his visit
to the British Isles from which he has
just returned.
Impressed by Statesmanship
While in England Professor Robin
son visited the British parliament,
where lie was greatly impressed by
the high level of statesmanship dis
played in the speeches of the various
party leaders. This characteristic he
found very noticeable at the Imperial
Conference where premiers of Bri
tain's overseas dominions met the
representatives of the British govern
ment.
Political campaigns in Britain and
Europe, the professor found, very
much resembled those conducted in
this country.
The complacency of the great mass
of people during the progress of the
great coal strike was remarkable, Pro
fessor Robinson thought. This point
he illustrated by the incident of strik
ing miners engaging in a football
match with a team composed of con
stables.
In the British universities he found
very friendly ' treatment being given
America in the history courses. In the
matter of the revolution of the Ameri
can colonies sympathy seemed to be
on the side of the colonies.
No Anti-American Feeling
Toward the League of Nations Pro
fessor Robinson observed a marked
contrast between the attitude of Bri
tain and that of the continental coun
tries. The British appear much more
enthusiastic in support of the league.
While he saw no evidence of anti-
American feeling in any of the coun
tries visited, the professor noticed a
very great interest in America dis
played by the French.

Professor Robinson spent a year in
the British Isles, France, and Italy.
He returned to California July 17.
