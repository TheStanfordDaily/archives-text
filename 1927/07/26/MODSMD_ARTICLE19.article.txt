## Although Called by League Of Nations, Operated Independently CONFERENCE A SUCCESS University Assembly Will Hear Expert Tomorrow At 11 O'clock 
### 
"Conferences can settle our world's
major crises," said Dr. Alonzo E. Tay
lor, director of the Food Research In
stitute at Stanford, in an interview on
his address to be given in a Univer
sity Assembly tomorrow morning at
11 o'clock.
Speaking on"The International
Economic Conference," Dr. Taylor
will tell of his experiences United
States representative at the Switzer
land meeting last May.
Many Obstacles Found
Post-war antagonism and distrust,
differences in technical language, the
presence of representatives from the
Union of Soviet Russian Republics
who attacked labor delegates from
Norway, Sweden, France, Germany,
England, and other countries on every
possible occasion—these were among
the chief obstacles encountered by
the gathering, says Dr. Taylor.
"But we went away from the meet
ing understanding one another. From
the Economic Conference came a com
mon language for economists," Dr.
Taylor points out.
• New Gathering in Five Years
He predicts that a second interna
tional gathering will be held within
the next five years.
The conference, although called by
the League of Nations, operated en
tirely free from any interference on
the part of that body, states Dr. Tay
lor. "It merely is a logical develop
ment following the foresight of the
League founders who anticipated the
need first, for the currency confer
ence, which was held in 1921, and the
Locarno Security Conference in 1925."
