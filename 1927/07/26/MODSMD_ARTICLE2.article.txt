# ENGLISH PROFESSORS WILL READ PAPERS TO PHILOLOGY CLUB
## 
### 
Dr. Hardin Craig, visiting professor
in the English department, and John
McClelland, also of the English de
partment, will read papers before the
Philology Club at its next meeting on
Thursday afternoon at 4:15 in the
Women's Clubhouse.
Mr. McClelland will introduce his
listeners to an unfamiliar side of Jane
Austen, the society novelist of the
early Nineteenth Century.
Dr. Crafg will outline a method of
approach to the study of Shakespeare
and the literature of the later English
Renaissance, through a consideration
of background. "The texture of
thought about life in the time of
Shakespeare," says Dr. Craig, "was
the knowledge that men possessed, or
thought they possessed, about the
forces which control the material uni
verse, their nature and laws, and
about the forces which were believed
to operate ethically, politically, and
supernaturally upon the souls of men.
Few of the current manuals of science,
pseudo-science, and philosophy have at
the time of Shakespeare have been
re-issued, whereas almost evorv piece
of pure literature has been repro
duced."
Dr. Craig will also discuss the in
fluence of Aristotle on the age of
Shakespeare and will explain the
Elizabethan meaning of true know
ledge of a man's self, and the Eliza
bethan conception of fate, and the
nature of Elizabethan skepticism.
