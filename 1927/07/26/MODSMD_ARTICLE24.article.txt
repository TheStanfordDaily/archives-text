Professor Lionel Remond Lenox of the chemistry department, who
died yesterday, was by enthusiastic choice a teacher and a man who
hound his students and his colleagues to him with strong ties of personal
affection. Some of those colleagues were formerly his students. The
chemistry department at Stanford has always been notably a group of
loyal men, loyal to their work and to their fellows without trace of
jealousy or self-seeking. Professor Lenox exemplified this spirit and
he helped to establish and maintain it by his own character and life.
Because his interest was centered so intensely on teaching and on his
students, although he was a student and scholar of the highest order he
found little time and little inclination to gain the outside reputation for
scholarship which comes from publishing. He carried on many valuable
investigations with valuable results, but was usually content with finish
ing the laboratory work and encouraging students to profit by the find
ings and to continue the study. To encourage able students to carry on
scholarly work he established a number of years ago a fellowship in
chemistry, which the University named in his honor.
Compelled in recent years to safeguard his health, he did not permit,
that to reduce his devotion to his life-work as a teacher. He sacrificed
other tilings instead. The loss of such a personality and force is deeply
felt by the University and especially by those whose lives he has touched
most closely as fellow student and teacher.
