# Cures for Cramming
## 
### 
Admiral Richard Jackson's assertion that frequent examinations will
eliminate "cramming" is right. The Admiral is right; but, strangely
enough, the exact opposite—very infrequent examinations —will have
the same result.
Undoubtedly, in courses where all credit is given on the basis of the
final examination, students are apt to let their work slide, in the hope of
assimilating it all the night before the examination. That they succeed is
not a fault of the system of education, but a proof of the wonderful
qualities of the human mind. That they fail to retain that knowledge
over a long period is natural.
As Admiral Jackson says, in courses where weekly examinations are
given, the students are forced to spread their work out, and are not so
likely to "cram." And they will retain more.
Yet, entirely opposed to this view, is that of the examination in which
the ground covered is larger. Next year, the Law School adopts the
system of continuing certain courses over the full year, and then giving
finals over the whole period. The idea that anyone "could "cram" for
these is out of the question. Thus we have "cramming" cures of either
extreme. Either very frequent examinations, or but few over a long
period of time.
After all, the fault may lie more with the examination itself than
with the frequency. Perhaps it is not comprehensive enough. A final
which truly covers the whole course could never be learned at the last
minute.
