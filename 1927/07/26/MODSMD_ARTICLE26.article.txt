# KOCH WILL DISCUSS CAROLINA STUDENT PLAYMAKING TONIGHT
## Students at University of North Carolina Write, Produce Own Plays 
### 
"The Carolina Playmakers" will be
the subject for this evening's lecture
by Professor Frederick Koch in the
Little Theatre at eight. The talk will
center around the work of the stu
dents at the University of North Caro
lina, who write and present their own
plays as an experiment in American
folk-drama.
According to Maxwell Anderson.
Professor Koch, as director of the
plavs, has "lifted an independent ban
ner in what New York condescendingly
refers to as the provinces, and his
work is likely to be of more moment
in the history of the drama in the
United States than the work of all the
manufacturers and importers of thea
trical novelties who are famous as
producers in this city."
Professor Koch will illustrate his
lecture with readings from his plays.
