# Alcove Book Store Opened In Palo Alto by Graduate
## 
### 
Located in one of the Spanish build- j
ings near the Cardinal Hotel on Raj
mona street, the Alcove Book Store j
has just been opened by Ken Carna- j
han, '24. In it can be found many of
the recent books, ranging from philo
sophy to fiction.
"I believe a bookstore is successful
only insofar as it creates the right at
mosphere," Mr. Carnahan says.
"I want the people to feel that they
can come in and look around at any
time," he continued.
He is planning to have displays of I
various kinds from time to time. Old
block prints, as contrasted with the
new printing, will be shown soon.
Rare collections of books, and color
printing will also be displayed. Mr.
Carnahan is receiving the co-opera
tion of Pedro J. Lemos, the director of
the Stanford Museum and Art Gallery,
in the displays he is planning.
The bookstore will haveÂ»a large cir- j
culating library for the benefit of its I
patrons and will, in many ways, try j
to make books more easily obtainable. 1
