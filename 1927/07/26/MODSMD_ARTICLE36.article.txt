# DR. MOSHER ISSUES NEW BOOK ON HEALTH FOR MODERN WOMEN
## University Press Publishes Volume by Stanford Authority 
### 
"Personal Hygiene for Women," by
Clelia D. Mosher, M.D., associate pro
fessor of hygiene and medical advisor
of women at Stanford, was published
today by the University Press. The
volume, the first of Dr. Mosher's
works to be published by the Stanford
press, serves as the fourth edition of
her "Health and the Woman Move
ment," and the second edition of
"Women's Physical Freedom," but the
material has been entirely revised and
brought up to date and the book has
been given a new format by the Stan
ford University Press.
Women Are Improving
Dr. Mosher is an optimist as re
gards women's health and the work
that women are able to do. The World
War and post-war conditions have
made unprecedented demands upon
women as well as upon men, she says,
and women can meet the demand if
they will take advantage of available
knowledge to keep themselves fit.
They do not need to be victims of
"traditional handicaps." Dr. Mosher
expresses her confidence that all in
telligent women can learn, as college
women learned long ago, that "being
a woman is no reason for not being
perfectly well," nor for being less able
to work as steadily and effectively as
men.
Book Is Practical
Dress, food, posture, habits are some
of the topics Dr. Mosher discusses, and
in her discussion of all of them she
notes improvements that women have
made, increase in health, strength,
size, and efficiency as a result of bet
ter habits, and foresees continued ad
vance.
She gives some rules, and they are
all simple and practical. The whole
book is practical and shows common
sense as well as authority. Dr. Mosher
is fitted to speak with authority by
her medical training and by her wide
studies with women both at Stanford
and elsewhere. The clear, direct style
of her writing fits the sanity and
practicality of her ideas.
The book is displayed at the Stan- j
ford Bookstore and at the Palo Alto j
Bookshop.
