# OAKLAND CLINIC HEAD TALKS ON PROBLEMS OF CHILD GUIDANCE
## Dr. Sidney K. Smith Asks For Frequent Physical Examinations 
### 
A talk on the general problems of
the child guidance clinic was given
Friday afternoon by Dr. Sidney K.
Smith, head of the child guidance
clinic at Oakland, before the vocation
al guidance class and visitors, who
filled the room to capacity.
He said that it was very easy to
lay too much emphasis on heredity.
4>ut that if this was dwelt on before
the child, it became not an heredity
handicap, but a factor of his develop
ment.
In way of remedies, he suggested
that physical examinations should be
much more frequent, that there should
be in every school a counsellor to
whom the child could turn, that a
balanced program of student activities
would keep the child from morbidity,
and lastly that there is need of knowl
edge on the part of school authorities
as to the laws of mental hygiene.
