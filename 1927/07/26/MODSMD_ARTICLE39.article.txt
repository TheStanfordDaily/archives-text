### 
Thirty Stanford students made a trip
to the California Redwood Park in
the Big Basin of the Santa Cruz moun
tains last Saturday.
The party went by way of Saratoga
and the picturesque Summit highway.
Three or four hours were spent in the
park inspecting the remarkable speci
ments of the Semperiviren redwood
tree peculiar to that locality. A picnic
lunch was eaten, and the cars started
for the campus.
