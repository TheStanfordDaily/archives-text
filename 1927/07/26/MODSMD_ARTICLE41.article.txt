# Stanford Dames to Picnic Tonight at Kendall Dell
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Dames
have completed plans for their picnic
supper this evening at Kendall Dell,
about one mile beyond Mountain View.
Members with their cars will meet at
the Women's Clubhouse at 5 o'clock
where they will pick up any who wish
to attend, but who do not have cars.
Each family is to come provided
with its own lunch and dishes and the
ten cents necessary for admission to
the park, but coffee and ice cream will
be furnished by the Dames.
