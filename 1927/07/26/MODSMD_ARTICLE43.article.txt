### 
John Herzog, former associate di
rector of the Greek Theatre of Berke
ley and an authority on theatrical
makeup, gave an exhibition of the
finer points of the art of makeup yes
terday afternoon before Mrs. Olive
Kisich's English 118a class in play
production.
The eyes, he said, are (he most im
portant feature in order to gain the
effects of various ages. Using four
students for exhibition purposes, Her
zog gave visual illustrations of his
points.
By putting blue over the eyes,
maroon under them, and adding a few
lines of maroon, Herzog achieved the
young hero-type effect. For the old
man type, he used crepe hair for
whiskers, and white powder in the
hair.
The young woman part—the ingenue
—was shown with only the lips and
eyes touched up. In case of rouge, he
said, care should be taken that it is
not of deeper shade than the lipstick.
In the last character he illustrated,
that of an old woman, the effect was
obtained by blocking out the cheeks
with grey, and the addition of a few
lines of maroon.
