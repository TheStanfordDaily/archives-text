# VISITING PROFESSOR ATTACKS SYSTEM OF PRESENT DAY COURTS
## "Better Judges and Juries" Urged by McMurray in "Sunset" Article 
### 
That there is something radically
wrong with the kind of court officials
employed to administer the laws
rather than with the laws themselves
is the contention of Orrin K. McMur
ray, Dean of the School of Jurispru
dence at the University of California,
and professor of law in the first half
of the summer session at the Stanford
Law School, in an article on criminal
reform which appears in the July num
ber of the Sunset Magazine.
"Most of the attack is directed
against the procedure in criminal
cases, when it is the system of ad
ministration that is at fault," said
Professor McMurray.
"Better judges and better juries are
needed," he added, to make his sug
gestion for administrative reform
more specific.
Aside from his discussion in the
Sunset, Professor McMurray com
mented on the plan for separation of
the younger and older prisoners at
San Quentin. "Segregation is a step in
4he right direction," he said.
He commented favorably on another
feature of the prison system as ap
parent at San Quentin: "It is very
desirable, too, for first offenders if
some outside work is provided." The
Yosemite road, which has been built
by convict labor organised into road
camps, he mentioned as a case in
point.
Professor McMurray returned to the
University of California this week,
since he terminated his course in
Wills last week.
