# Brandsten Makes Park of Searsville Old Town Site
## 
### 
Searsville Park as it is now is the
result of the work of Ernst Brandsten
during the last five years. The Uni
versity has had part interest in the
park for thirty years, but in 1920 it
bought out the Spring Valley inter
ests and leased the tract to Brandsten
in 1922. The purchase consisted of the
original 450 acres of unimproved land
and G8 acres of lake, plus 150 addi
tional acres. The lake covered the spot
where the old town of Searsville
stood.
In the last five years Brandsten,
who is head swimming coach at the
University, has converted this former
ly idle property into one of the most
popular summer and week-end resorts
in this vicinity. This is evidenced by
-the fact that large numbers of San
Francisco residents patronize the park
continually.
Puts in Many Improvements
In improving the land. Brandsten
put in two and a half miles of water
pipe, fifteen miles of automobile roads,
numerous bridle paths, electric lights,
bath-houses, cabins, stone fireplaces,
and tables and benches. He cleared
out all the underbrush in the park
grounds so that- people may picnic.
Brandsten says that since the con
version of Searsville into an amuse
ment park, it has rapidly increased in
favor until it is now nearly as popular

as Russian River. "This is a good thing
for the surrounding communities,"
said Brandsten, "because people come
to Searsville from as far as San Fran
cisco, which is only about an hour and
a quarter from here by auto."
Old Town Submerged
At the time of the purchase, the
University enlarged the dam so that
the level of the water was raised nine
feet; that was when the town of
Searsville became submerged. Up to
that time the foundations of the build
ings had been on dry land.
Senator Stanford was one of the
original investors in the project of the
dam at the townsite. This was about
thirty-eight years ago, when the town
was still a logging center in this
vicinity. Senator Stanford's idea was
to back the water up at that point, in
order to transfer the water from
Searsville Lake to Crystal Spring Lake
by tunnel. The buildings were demol
ished, but the connection with the
larger reservoir was never made.
In the days of its prime, the old
town was the principal rendezvous of
that section, as the county road was
the main street and formed a sort of
♦lyke across the shallows of the lake.
The county sclioolhouse was located
%here, what is now known as Cypress
Grove, on the west side, marking the
spot where it stood.

result of the work of Ernst Brandsten
during the last five years. The Uni
versity has had part interest in the
park for thirty years, but in 1920 it
bought out the Spring Valley inter
ests and leased the tract to Brandsten
in 1922. The purchase consisted of the
original 450 acres of unimproved land
and G8 acres of lake, plus 150 addi
tional acres. The lake covered the spot
where the old town of Searsville
stood.
In the last five years Brandsten,
who is head swimming coach at the
University, has converted this former
ly idle property into one of the most
popular summer and week-end resorts
in this vicinity. This is evidenced by
-the fact that large numbers of San
Francisco residents patronize the park
continually.
Puts in Many Improvements
In improving the land. Brandsten
put in two and a half miles of water
pipe, fifteen miles of automobile roads,
numerous bridle paths, electric lights,
bath-houses, cabins, stone fireplaces,
and tables and benches. He cleared
out all the underbrush in the park
grounds so that- people may picnic.
Brandsten says that since the con
version of Searsville into an amuse
ment park, it has rapidly increased in
favor until it is now nearly as popular

as Russian River. "This is a good thing
for the surrounding communities,"
said Brandsten, "because people come
to Searsville from as far as San Fran
cisco, which is only about an hour and
a quarter from here by auto."
Old Town Submerged
At the time of the purchase, the
University enlarged the dam so that
the level of the water was raised nine
feet; that was when the town of
Searsville became submerged. Up to
that time the foundations of the build
ings had been on dry land.
Senator Stanford was one of the
original investors in the project of the
dam at the townsite. This was about
thirty-eight years ago, when the town
was still a logging center in this
vicinity. Senator Stanford's idea was
to back the water up at that point, in
order to transfer the water from
Searsville Lake to Crystal Spring Lake
by tunnel. The buildings were demol
ished, but the connection with the
larger reservoir was never made.
In the days of its prime, the old
town was the principal rendezvous of
that section, as the county road was
the main street and formed a sort of
♦lyke across the shallows of the lake.
The county sclioolhouse was located
%here, what is now known as Cypress
Grove, on the west side, marking the
spot where it stood.
