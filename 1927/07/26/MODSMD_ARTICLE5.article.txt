# CRAIG WARNS WOMEN AGAINST TOO MUCH USE OF SHOP TALK
## Says Conversation Today Has Sunk Down to Low Ebb 
### 
Idle dinner table chatter gave way
yesterday at Roble to studiously well
cliosen remarks on subjects of univer
sal interest following the informal lec
ture on the "Art of Conversation" Sun
day evening by Professor Hardin Craig
of the University of lowa.
Conversation of the present day is
at a low ebb, and women are as prone
to talk shop as men, Professor Craig
said.
Too Much Private Affairs
Talking shop is not the only sin of
which this generation is guilty, accord
ing to Professor Craig, as long as the
egotist, who forgets that the recount
ing of private affairs is usually of in
terest only to the person who is doing
the talknig, is at large.
He gave as an example of this the
case of two well-bred persons meeting
after a vacation, each politely inquir
ing about the other's experiences, and
each wishing that the other would
cease his boresome tales. Both wished
to talk, and neither wanted to listen.

Give All a Chance

Too-detailed conversation is another
fault which detracts from interest in a
conversation, Professor Craig said. No
one should monopolize things to such
a degree that it is impossible for any
one else to get a word in. Each per
son partaking in a conversation should
at some time have his chance to
shine, he added.
Professor Craig pointed out that
raillery has dangerous possibilities,
and in touching upon the necessity of
its careful use, quoted from Samuel
Johnson, who said:
"Let us be serious; here comes a
fool."
