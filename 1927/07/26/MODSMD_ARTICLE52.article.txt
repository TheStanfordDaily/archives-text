# PROFANITY SIGN OF MEAGER KNOWLEDGE SAYS DEAN BROWN
## 
### 
"Knowledge and Reverence" was the
subject of Dr. Charles R. Brown of
the Yale Divinity School in his sermon
in the Stanford Memorial Chapel last
Sunday.
Dr. Brown said he was not in favor
of the Blue-law Sunday. He believes,
however, that the Sabbath must be
used to build a stronger moral fabric
in our race.
"A man's knowledge is meager who
feels that his daily speech must be
propped up with profane words," he
said in another part of his sermon.
Of the bible, he said, "different por
tions of the bible are on different
levels."
If one could have only one book for
the rest of his life, he would choose
St. Matthew in preference to Leviti
cus, or St. Luke rather than Ecclesi
astes.
Sex problems must be treated with
knowledge and reverence, he said, and
the same he felt to be true in regard
to the relation between science and
religion. Scientists believe that unless
God actually dictated the Holy Bible,
it is no better than any other book. We
are not afraid to open our eyes in the
presence of nature, nor are we
ashamed to close them in the presence
of God.
