# 'LOYALTIES' CAST INCLUDES MANY NEW TO CAMPUS
## Older Roles Are Taken by People With Wide Experience ONE MAN WAS IN STOCK De Hermida Formerly in Company Playing at Berkeley 
### 
Several faces new to Stanford audi
ences will be seen at the Assembly
Hall Friday night in "Loyalties," John
Galsworthy's drama of class prejudice,
which will be presented Friday night
by the Dramatic Council, under the
direction of Gordon Davis.
Outstanding among the new people
is Eugene A.de Hermida, taking the
serio-comic part of Gilman, a true
British country merchant. De Her
mida, being an older man, is peculiarly
suited to the part, having not only the
experience and ability, but the matur
ity which such a character requires.
He was playing in stock at the Liberty
Theatre in Berkeley at the same time
Gordon Davis was in juvenile leads
there. He tias* for some time past,
been interested in developing the Lit
tle Theatre at Sacramento.
Actor From Kansas
Another man taking a character part
is Albert Bourland, playing Ricardos,
the misunderstanding Italian. Bour
land is at Stanford taking graduate
work. He has had considerable experi
ence in modern shows in Kansas, play
ing in "The Whole Town's Talking,"
"It Pays to Advertise," "Nothing But
The Truth."and several others.
Hallett Smith, as Major Colford. has
a highly emotional part, taking sides
with Captain Dancy through the whole
turmoil, whether right or wrong. Lloyd
Smith, taking the part of Graviter, the
young partner in Twisden's law office,
offsets a lack of experience with a
resonant voice, and an understanding
of his character.
St. Erth to Be Clubman
Lord St. Erth, an old John Bull Eng-'
lish clubman, is played by Joseph Hill,
who has taken parts at the San Jose
Junior College, including roles in "Mr.
Pim Passes By" and"The Romancers."
During the past year he has been di
recting plays for the High School and
Community at Pixley.
Clark Bucknam and Henry M.
Schuttauff, who are playing the Foot
man and A Young Clerk, respectively,
have both had slight experience in
dramatics.
