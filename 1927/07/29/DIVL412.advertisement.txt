One Word More on
Browning
By Frances Theresa Russell
"It is a pleasure to come upon a
Browningite with a sense of humor,
one that neither protests too much
nor unconsciously parades the mar
tyrdom of having read every line of
! the master. Here is admiration with
out adoration. . . . An important
j contribution to a subject that has suf
| fered so much at the hands of unim
• portant commentators."
