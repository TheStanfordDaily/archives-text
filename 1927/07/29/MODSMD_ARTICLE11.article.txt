# STADIUM PILE DRIVER USED OVERTIME TO COMPLETE ADDITIONS
## 
### 
With a crew of about fifteen men
working two shifts at its side, the pile
driver working on the stadium fill is
busy fourteen hours a day.
The piles, which are being driven
down to the level of the top of the
present statdium, are now being placed
around the east side of the bowl. One
fifth of the work of the pile driver has
been completed. When the piles are
driven as far as the scoreboard on
the north end, the superstructure for
the seats will be started at this point
and worked back toward the south,
avoiding the necessity of carrying the
lumber beneath the completed erec
tion. This plan will then be carried out
on the west side in the same manner.
The lumber to erect the projection is
arriving and will be carried to the
top of the fill on standard narrow
guage railroad tracks which are now
being laid. The construction engineer
expects to use a small locomotive on
the lumber car until it reaches the top
of the fill and then to attach horses
to haul it around the pathway, upon
which other narrow-gauge tracks will
be laid.
The work is progressing as rapidly
as can be expected and will be easily
completed by the time of the Big
Game, it was said.
