## Plot Includes Struggle of One Man Against Many CAST IS WELL SUITED Haizlip and Hayes Will Play Leading Roles In Production 
### 
"Loyalties," considered in this coun
try to be John Galsworthy's best
drama, will be presented in the Stan
ford University Assembly Hall, under
the direction of Gordon Davis, at 8:15
o'clock tonight. This is the last play
to be given in the Assembly Hall until
next fall, as the hall will be closed
until then for repairs.
The play is a picture of a society of
sincere and generally likable people
who never mention or think of God,
but run their lives, on the whole finely
and conscientiously, on a scheme of
ethics founded on their loyalties.
All Stand Together
Finding one of their own attacked
by an outsider they stand by him,
though at times doubting the right
ness of their action.
Captain Dancy, accused by Ferdi
nand De Levis, of stealing a thousand
pounds from him, is the one to whom
the loyalty is devoted. De Levis, feel
ing himself in the right, fights not
only Dancy, but all of Dancy's friends.
Providing perhaps a more thorough
ly satisfying experience than anything
Galsworthy has ever done, the play is
of crystal clearness, sparing of word
