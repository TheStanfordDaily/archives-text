# Summer Swallows
## 
### 
This is the last day of the quarter for many students. We wonder
what memories of this summer will stay with them longest.
Most of them will take away thoughts of units well-earned, useful
know lege acquired, and worth-while achievements accomplished. All
will be richer for broadening contacts and new friendships.
Yet as the year slips by they will remember most something intangible
that is Stanford itselfâ€”the poetry of warm-toned archways, haunting
fragrance of oleanders, swallows curving in a clear blue sky.
