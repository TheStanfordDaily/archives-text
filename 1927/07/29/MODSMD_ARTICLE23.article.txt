# Then, Now

On August 3 there will be an exhibit of war-time posters in the Art
Gallery, the appeal with pictures from all of the fighting nations.
Many of us can recollect the war-time fever which possessed this
country, as it did others, when these appeals, for men, materials, and
saving, were launched.
Ten years later, we shall calmly survey the art that whipped the
nations to arms. They do not stir us now as they once did, and we will
not forget the work they accomplished.
