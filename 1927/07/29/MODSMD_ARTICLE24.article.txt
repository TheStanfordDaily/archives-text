# KOCH UPHOLDS DRAMA OF LOCALITY IN TALK ON PLAYERS TUESDAY
## Says Playwrights Should Choose Familiar Subjects 
### 
"Out of such states as Arkansas,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and
Texas there will come a drama of lo
calities with national and universal
significance," declared Professor Fred
erick H. Koch in a lecture last Tues
day evening on"The Carolina Play
makers."
The lecturer went on to explain the
drama of locality by the importance
of such plays as those of Shakes
peare, Moliere, Goethe, Lope de Vega,
and Ibsen, and their local presentation
of the Elizabethan Period, the Court
of Louis IV, Germany, Spain, and Nor
way. Even in Ireland playwriters used
the theatre to create in the minds of
the people a spirit of revolution.
Gives Courses in Playwriting
There is a transformation coming
over colleges in really serious drama,
says Professor Koch, who has been
giving courses in playwriting at the
University of California this summer.
Students are beginning to realize the
necessity of writing about places and
things with which they are more inti
mately associated.
Professor Koch described his pioneer
ing iff the prairie towns of North
Dakota twenty years ago with a wan
dering troupe of student players—one
of whom was Maxwell Anderson, au
thor of "What Price Glory."
"Every day,"he said, "we drew lots
to see which of us would have to dress
in the costumes we were going to
appear in on the stage, and walk
through the town drumming up an
audience."
Produce Their Own Plays
He also described the more welcome
expeditions of the Carolina student
plavmakers, who produce the plays
they themselves have written not only
on their own campus but also in
towns all through the state, and, once
a year, outside the state.
He pictured them riding through
the hills when the dogwood is in
bloom. "It's Pagliacci," he exclaimed,
"it's Moliere, it's the troubadour of all
time!"
To illustrate the efforts of his stu
dents, Mr. Koch read a one-act play
by Erma and Paul Green.
