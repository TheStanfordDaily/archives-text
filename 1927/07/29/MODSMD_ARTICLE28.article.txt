# DISCUSS AUSTEN AND SHAKESPEARE BEFORE PHILOLOGY MEMBERS
## McClelland and Craig Give Papers at Meeting Of Club 
### 
Jane Austen's correspondence with
her sister Cassandra and Shake
speare's background of popular knowl
edge were the subjects of papers read
yesterday afternoon before a well
attended meeting of the Philology
Club in the Women's Clubhouse. The
speakers were John McClelland of the
Stanford English department and Har
din Craig, visiting professor and well
known Shakespeare scholar.
Austen Letters Mentioned
Mr. McClelland left his listeners on
friendly and informal terms with Jane
Austen the woman —the maiden lady.
He commented on her letters to her
unmarried sister, and read many selec
tions from them. He called attention
to the frivolity, the triviality, and the
monotony of her social relations and
pointed out these qualities as ingre
dients in atmospher of her novels. He
revealed in her letters the same genial
gossip, the same interest in the out
ward details of life that she betrays
in her more formal pictures of her
soceity. "Of all our English novelties,"
he remarked, "Jane Austen concerned
herself the most exclusively with lives
of commonplace men and women. She
had no axe to grind. Perhaps it is for
this very reason that she is immortal."
Stresses Study of Period
Dr. Craig stressed the importance
of supplementing the study of Shake
speare and other Elizabethan poets
with a study of the current beliefs,
the current philosophy, of their time.
According to Dr. Craig, it is a mis
take to interpret Shakespeare's char
acters with reference to modern
psychology. The Elizabethan play
wrights, with their Aristotelian sys
tem, did not assume that human char
acter is a consistent unit. "Modern
psychology is inhibited by the idea of
unity. Character as it appears in hu
man life is a far less unified and con
sistent thing than literary critics be
lieve it to be."
