# COACH SPRAGUE SETS AUGUST 5 AS DATE FOR SWIMMING MEET
## Eighteen Already Signed For Intramural Contest 
### 
Thursday, August 11, has been defi
nitely announced by Coach Sprague as
the date for the Summer Quarter intra
mural swimming meet. More than
eighteen men have already entered, it
was announced.
The swimming races will consist of
three free-style events, one lap, two
laps, and five laps; a breaststroke
event of two laps; and a two-lap
breaststroke race.
Many Good Men
In the one- and two-lap free-style
events a great fight is expected with
such men as Kryne Van den Akker,
Guido Caglieri, Karl Doerr, and Jack
Voorsanger competing for honors. Van
den Akker and Doerr are varsity men,
the former capable of doing the 100-
yard free-style in fifty-six seconds.
Both Caglieri and Voorsanger are en
tering intramural competition for the
first time, but have notable high
school records.
Fighting finishes should not be miss
ing from the other events, even though
comparatively little is known of the
ability of the various other contenders.
In the breaststroke, three men appear
to be pretty evenly matched. They are
Warren Littlefield, a varsity swimmer,
John Saunders, and Larry Jeffries.
The last two are newcomers who have
been showing considerable ability in
practice. In the five-lap free-style and
the two-lap backstroke events no stel
lar performers have shown themselves
as yet. However, the competitiors are
so evenly matched that close races
should result.
Plan Diving Exhibition
The diving event will be run off
with four compulsory dives and two
optional. This event will be followed
by one of the most interesting fea
tures of the day, a diving exhibition
by Dave Fall and Ted Smith. Fall is
rated by swimming critics as being
one of the three best divers in the
country.
It is expected that the entry list,
which is still open, will have more
than thirty names before the day of
the meet arrives. Entry is open to
anyone in the University and those
desiring to enter should sign their
names on the list which is posted on
the bulletin board at Encina gymna
sium.
