# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, ’16 
You hockey fans, did you ever hap
pen to think this whole sport of skat
ing grew out of a crude necessity of
life? We enjoy this "champagne of
sports" today, because the people of
northern countries had to get about
from place to place on the ice. As the
sport of yachting developed from the
necessity of travel by water for trad
ing purposes, so speed skating and
fancy skating and ice hockey, "the
fastest of games," have developed
from the fact that about one thousand
years ago some adventurous spirit in
a frozen country had the bright idea
of strapping an animal's shin bone on
to the bottom of each shoe, and push
ing himself around on the ice with a
sharp stick.
Later on, in the seventeenth cen
tury, the blade skate was developed
and the first skating club was formed
in Edinburgh in 1744. Now we have
our numerous amateur and profession
al ice-hockey players, speed and fancy

skaters, and the sport, as well as the
promoters, is that much better off be
cause of it.
The beautiful lady shown in the
drawing just below the wicked stick
which Ching Johnson is wielding put
skating in a class by itself when she
was made the patron saint of the
sport. You never heard of a saint of
football, baseball, or boxing, did you?
Remember that during the next ice
hockey game you see, for I'm sure
the players forget all about anything
saintly during the heat of battle!
"Ching" Johnston is one of the New
York Rangers Hockey Club. Don't be
fooled by his amiable appearance, for,
if you try to get by him with the puck,
he will knock you flat, take the rubber
disc away from you, and, as likely as
not, shoot a goal with it. He and Taffy
Abel play the defense positions for
Col. Hammond's team, and are worth
considerable money. You know —"mil-
lions for defense, etc."
