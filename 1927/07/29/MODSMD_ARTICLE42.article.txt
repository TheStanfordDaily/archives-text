STANFORD WOMAN RESCUER
Miss Frances Lawrence, Stanford
'27, assisted Graham Hasty in rescuing
! Harry Brown from the waters of Lake
Tahoe last Tuesday. Brown, while
walking along a pier, suddenly fainted,
I and toppled into the water. Hasty
went to the rescue and grasped Brown.
Growing tired of holding his burden
above the water, he was relieved by
Miss Lawrence, who held the uncon
scious man above the surface, while
| Hasty swam ashore for a rope.
