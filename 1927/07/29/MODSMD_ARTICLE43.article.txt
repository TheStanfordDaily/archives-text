# SLAPSTICK COMEDY LONG IN FAVOR SAYS CHARLES BASKERVILL
## Had Forerunner in Clowns Of Shakespeare's Period He Explains 
### 
Song and dance men of today's
vaudeville stage are not a modern de
velopment in the history of comedy,
according to Professor Charles R.
Baskervill in his lecture on the
"Clowns of Shakespeare's Stage" at
the Little Theatre Wednesday after
noon. The sixteenth century song and
dance men, the most famous of whom
were Tarlton and Kemp, became so
popular in acts which made use of
satire, parody, and jigs, sentimental
and otherwise, that, according to Pro
fessor Baskervill, "all clowns were
their apes."
"The era was one of slapstick com
edy such as has its counterpart in the
parts taken by movie comedians of
today," the speaker said. Traditional
clown characters were assumed by
the actors, such as Jack Pudding and
Jack of Clubs. In such a guise they
amused by their dialogues which satir
ized both individuals and society, he
added.
Giving first the background which
caused the development of the song
and dance men, Professor Baskervill
explained the part these song and
dance men played in the growth of
comedy, and finished by drawing a
parallel between Shakespeare's comics
and the roles made by Tarlton and
Kemp.
"Shakespeare's clowns carry on the
conventions of the clowns made popu
lar by Tarlton," said Baskervill.
Shakespeare was so transformed as to
be hard to recognize..
Regarding Tarlton, Queen Eliza
beth's favorite clown, Baskervill said:
"His range of characters was enor
mous and he was famous for his im
promptu doggerel." It was popular to
have jesting fellows at the feasts who
satirized the guests. Thus the "Rag
man's Role" or Rigamarole evolved,
Dialogues between clowns were popu
lar then as now, but at that time farce
was really chiefly a matter of facial
grimaces and guffaws.
