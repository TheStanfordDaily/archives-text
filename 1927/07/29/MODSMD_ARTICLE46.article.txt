# Art Exhibit Is Memento Of Brother of Founder
## 
### 
In the Art Gallery is on exhibition a
number of Australian paintings, do
nated to the University by Thomas
Welton Stanford, the younger brother
of Leland Stanford. And thereby hangs
a story.
In the early '60's Thomas Welton
Stanford heard that there was a great
demand among Australian miners for
coal-oil ahd coal-oil lamps. He loaded
a ship with these commodities, and
left for Australia, ordering another
vessel to follow with a similar cargo.
He sold out both boat-loads. The
miners were so eager to have the
lamps and oil that they held the
lamps in their hands and waited for a
chance to pay for them.
On the way over, Stanford was so
sea-sick that he swore he would never
take an ocean trip again, and he never
did.
Leaves Estate to University
In 1918 all of Stanford's property
was willed to the University. But be
fore his death, Thomas Welton Stan
ford had erected the Art Museum and
the Administration building, which
originally was the University Library.
He also founded the Thomas Welton
Stanford Fellowship in Psychic Re

search, which amounted to $50,000, in
1912, and was increased by bequest.
His will bequeathed the University
nearly a million dollars, the ihterest
of which was to go to research work
in psychology and allied branches.
Remained American Citizen
Stanford became a wealthy man in
Australia and a benefactor of the land
of his residence, but he remained loyal
to his native country and never gave
up his citizehship.
His interest in Australia led to his
commissioning J. W. Curtis, a painter
of Australian scenes, to make pictures
for him of beautiful and characteristic
spots about the island continent.
In the course of years Thomas Wel
ton Stanford gathered many paintings
from all parts of the world, some of
them fine examples of art. All these
paintings came to Stanfgnl University,
either by gift or bequest of this munifi
cent benefactor in his will.
From the Australian collection a
special exhibit has been hung in one
of the smaller rooms of the Art Gal
lery, while in the big room is a selec
tion from the general collection which
bears the donor's name.
