Professor J. Duncan Spaeth of
Princeton will contribute to the Wed
nesday afternoon literary series in a
talk 011 "Tendencies in Contemporary
Literature" on August 3.
Spaeth, who is professor of English
Literature at Princeton, is a visiting
professor at the University of Cali
fornia this summer.
With Many Interests
A specialist, academically, in the
field of old English poetry, he has
been an amateur coach of Princeton
crews, he was an organizer and in
structor for the illiterate in army
campus during the World War, at one
time a member of the board of man
agers for the New Jersey State Re
formatory, and edited a Camp Reader
for American Soldiers, which was
adopted by the War Department for
the A.E.F. during the war.
In speaking of tendencies in con
temporary literature, Professor Spaeth
will bring out some of the underlying
characteristics of the modern move
ment as reflected in the work of such
American writers as Theodore Dreiser,
Carl Sandburg, Edgar Lee Masters,
Sinclair Lewis, Cabell, and others, to
characterize the reaction against the
so-called "sentimental" attitude toward
life, the temper of modern realism
and its iconoclastic violence.
To Appraise Movement
He will refer to contemporary writ
ers rather by way of illustration than
by way of interpretation or detailed
criticism, and will attempt an ap
praisement of what he terms "the era
of disillusionment and the new real
ism."
The lecture, commencing at 4:15 in
the Little Theatre, will be open to the
public.
