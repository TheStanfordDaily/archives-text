# Roble Holds Successful Tea Tuesday Afternoon
## 
### 
Last Tuesday's tea at Roble was the
most successful one this quarter. More
than one hundred were present.
Friends from off the campus had been
invited, and many men attended.
Miss Virginia Fox was hostess. In
formality in dress, animated conver
sation, and much merriment marked
the tea throughout.
