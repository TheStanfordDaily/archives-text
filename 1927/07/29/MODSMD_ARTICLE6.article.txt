# WORLD WAR POSTERS WILL BE PLACED ON EXHIBITION AUGUST 3
## 
### 
Selected posters from all nations
used in the World War will be placed
on exhibition in the Art Gallery about
August 3, according to an announce
ment made today by Director Pedro J.
Lemos. The posters are a part of the
collection of the Hoover War Library
and will replace the Australian views
in the Thomas Welton Stanford col
lection, which are now on view.
Among the posters are those issued
by the various nations in their calls
for recruits, for money, and for con
servation of resources, as well as
propaganda posters. In addition to
these, a number will be shown which
were issued by the Commission for Re
lief in Belgium, a war-time organiza
tion headed by Herbert Hoover, and
of the American Relief Administra
tion, a post-war relief group also led
by Hoover. The latter body was espe
cially organized for work in Russia,
in combatting starvation there.
The Hyde exhibition of block prints
will remain on view, as previously an
nounced, for the remainder of the
summer.
