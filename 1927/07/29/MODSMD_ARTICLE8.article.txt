# OR. TAYLOR CITES NATIONALISM AS EUROPE'S MENACE
## Says Economic Conference Resolutions Would End Trade Troubles "SPITE FENCES" MUST GO Stanford Man at Geneva Meeting Tells of Work Done There 
### 
"There isn't a single pending trade
war or existing trade barrier in Europe
which could not be solved or removed
within a month by the adoption of the
resolutions for which the delegates at
the International Economics Confer
ence voted," declared Dr. Alonzo E.
Taylor at the assembly Wednesday
morning, discussing the work of the
conference, in which he participated.
"But if Chamberlain's attitude toward
the resolutions, a kind of acceptance
filled with reservations, is to be that
officially adopted by the English gov
ernment and other European coun
tries, the whole conference was a
mere gesture.
"Europe faces a severe test in na
tionalism," he said. "It can be inter
national minded or it can maintain
barriers set up through intense na
tionalism and prevent a solution of
its economic troubles."
The conference was not an isolated
episode, Dr. Taylor pointed out: it
was directly related to the Confer
ence on Finance at Brussells in 1920,
to the work of the two expert com
mittees ending in the Dawes Plan, and
to the Locarno Conference on Political
Relations.
The Economic Conference, although
called by The League of Nations, was
left free to proceed unhindered by it.
Plans Well Laid
The council of the conference, fore
warned by the failure of the Geneva
meeting through failure to have a
plan, called together in advance a
group of sixty experts on reparations
to prepare an agenda, which was ready
last March. The agenda included only
questions of major importance which
could be translated into immediate
legislative action, and was in the
hands of the delegates long before the
meeting. Among the subjects purpose
ly excluded were: reparations pay
ments, international war debts, re
striction of immigration, international
finance, protectionism versus free
trade, and the nationalization of re
sources.
The agenda of the Economic Con
ference were divided into three main
sections, dealing with agriculture, in
dusty, and commerce. Much time was
wasted on agricultural questions,
which for the first time were given
the same importance as commerce
and industry.
Sought European Relief
The most practical results obtained
at the conference were those springing
from the discussions of commercial
matters, the real purpose of the con
ference being to get European trade
conditions back to where they were
before the war. Practically the reso
lutions passed at the conference apply
only to Europe, he said. Before 1914
there were numerous trade tariffs but
few trade barriers, the interpretations
of commercial treaties were clear to
all concerned, and there was universal
fairness and lack of discrimination in
all trade negotiations. All that is
| changed now, and the twenty-seven
countries of Europe are surrounded
with "spite fences," of varying heights.
"Americans may acknowledge that
the 'self-determination' of small na
tions has helped erect these barriers,"
said Taylor. The conference had to
deal with not only the barriers that
ame out of the war, but those result
ing from improvements in industrial
methods. The market for coal, for in
stance, has been considerably reduced
through the development of other
sources of power, which Europe has
failed to take into account.
Agriculture Resolutions Passed
In regard to the first agricultural
problem, that of plant and animal
quarantine, it was charged that coun
tries excluded plants and animals on
the ground that they are disease car
riers, merely in order to protect their
own products. It was proposed that the
League of Nations establish scientific
and standardized tests for detecting
diseases, but this is impossible since
the very nature of the need for quar
antine precludes long deliberation.
The discussion ended in the resolution
that countries should not employ quar
antine as an embargo.
The second agricultural question
concerned international farm credits.
It was claimed that capital is scarce
because Europe can't borrow on ade
quate security. Taylor declared, how
ever, that, the chief limitations pro
ceed from Europe's own governments
which limit agricultural loans. It was
recommended that co-operative asso
ciations be formed between producers
in exporting countries and consumers
in importaing countries. Such associa
tions will ultimately form of their own
accord, said Dr. Taylor.
The section on Industry was con
cerned with the two questions: "ra
tionalization" of industry, and inter
national trusts. "By the word 'ration
alization.'" said I)r. Taylor, "Europe
seems to describe something it hasn't
got but would like to borrow from us."
Standardization and elimination of
waste in mass production are little

known in Europe. The discussion re
solved itself into the question: "What
guarantee have the workers that when
efficiencies are introduced in industry
through machinery the extra profit
will be divided between capital and
labor?" European capital, on its side,
has no inclination to share increased
profits with labor. Europe lacks the
ideal of building up the standard of
living for all classes. It feels that the
classes are so "ossified" that if the
lower ones got any more income they
would not employ it wisely. Germany
is more advanced in this respect than
other European countries, said Dr.
Taylor.
"The delegates who wanted 'ration
alization' of industry but who were
fearful of committing themselves kept

up the discussion for days," he added.
As regards international trusts, the
producers are strongly in favor of
them, and the subject is at present
being agitated all over Europe.
In regard to the eight units of dele
gates from the British Empire Tay

lor said, "The component parts of the
British Empire are absolutely inde
pendent in the economic sphere. All
the dominions agree in uniting against
the mother country. They all seek the
opportunity to utilize their domestic
resources as independent units."
