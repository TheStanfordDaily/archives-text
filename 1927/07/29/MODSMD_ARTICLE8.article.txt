# OR. TAYLOR CITES NATIONALISM AS EUROPE'S MENACE
## Says Economic Conference Resolutions Would End Trade Troubles "SPITE FENCES" MUST GO Stanford Man at Geneva Meeting Tells of Work Done There 
### 
"There isn't a single pending trade
war or existing trade barrier in Europe
which could not be solved or removed
within a month by the adoption of the
resolutions for which the delegates at
the International Economics Confer
ence voted," declared Dr. Alonzo E.
Taylor at the assembly Wednesday
morning, discussing the work of the
conference, in which he participated.
"But if Chamberlain's attitude toward
the resolutions, a kind of acceptance
filled with reservations, is to be that
officially adopted by the English gov
ernment and other European coun
tries, the whole conference was a
mere gesture.
"Europe faces a severe test in na
tionalism," he said. "It can be inter
national minded or it can maintain
barriers set up through intense na
tionalism and prevent a solution of
its economic troubles."
The conference was not an isolated
episode, Dr. Taylor pointed out: it
was directly related to the Confer
ence on Finance at Brussells in 1920,
to the work of the two expert com
mittees ending in the Dawes Plan, and
to the Locarno Conference on Political
Relations.
The Economic Conference, although
called by The League of Nations, was
left free to proceed unhindered by it.
Plans Well Laid
The council of the conference, fore
warned by the failure of the Geneva
meeting through failure to have a
plan, called together in advance a
group of sixty experts on reparations
to prepare an agenda, which was ready
last March. The agenda included only
questions of major importance which
could be translated into immediate
legislative action, and was in the
hands of the delegates long before the
meeting. Among the subjects purpose
ly excluded were: reparations pay
ments, international war debts, re
striction of immigration, international
finance, protectionism versus free
trade, and the nationalization of re
sources.
The agenda of the Economic Con
ference were divided into three main
sections, dealing with agriculture, in
dusty, and commerce. Much time was
wasted on agricultural questions,
which for the first time were given
the same importance as commerce
and industry.
Sought European Relief
The most practical results obtained
at the conference were those springing
from the discussions of commercial
matters, the real purpose of the con
ference being to get European trade
conditions back to where they were
before the war. Practically the reso
lutions passed at the conference apply
only to Europe, he said. Before 1914
there were numerous trade tariffs but
few trade barriers, the interpretations
of commercial treaties were clear to
all concerned, and there was universal
fairness and lack of discrimination in
all trade negotiations. All that is
| changed now, and the twenty-seven
countries of Europe are surrounded
