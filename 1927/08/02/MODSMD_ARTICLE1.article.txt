Stanford Theatre, in Palo Alto, will
have as its lead, Gordon Davis, who
is also directing the play. This is the
last show Davis will direct or act in
at Stanford until a year from this fall,
when he will return from his year's
sabbatical leave.
As the repairs under way in the
Assembly Hall make it impossible to
produce this last play of the summer
there, the Dramatic Council has ar
ranged with the management of the
New Stanford Theatre to present this
bright play that is considered one of
the cleverest. English comedies writ
ten in recent years.
Eden Phillpotts, who has written
numerous successful comedies, has
collaborated with Basil Mac Donald
Hastings in this extremely modern
farce.
Is a Light, Lively Comedy
"The Angel in the House," as con
trasted with "Craig's Wife" and "Loy-,
alties," is a lighthearted, agreeable !
lively comedy, albeit with much meaty
wit scattered throughout.
For his cast Davis has chosen peo
ple with considerable* comedy experi
ence, among whom are numbered two
well-liked Stanford players, Norris E.
James. wHo is playing the part of
Basil Mallet, and Elizabeth Wilbur,
who as Lady Sarel, will be seen in a
role similar to those in which she has
before pleased campus audiences;
namely, that of the near-middle-aged
widow with sentimentalities deserving
of a much younger person.
