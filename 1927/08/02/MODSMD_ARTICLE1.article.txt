# GORDON DAVIS TO TAKE LEAD IN LAST PLAY OF SUMMER
## “Angel in the House” to Be Staged in Palo Alto August 12 IS VERY MODERN FARCE Cast Includes Several With Reputations for Comedy Roles 
### 
"The Angel in the House," which
will be presented by the Dramatic
Council, Friday, August 12, in the New
Stanford Theatre, in Palo Alto, will
have as its lead, Gordon Davis, who
is also directing the play. This is the
last show Davis will direct or act in
at Stanford until a year from this fall,
when he will return from his year's
sabbatical leave.
As the repairs under way in the
Assembly Hall make it impossible to
produce this last play of the summer
there, the Dramatic Council has ar
ranged with the management of the
New Stanford Theatre to present this
bright play that is considered one of
the cleverest. English comedies writ
ten in recent years.
Eden Phillpotts, who has written
numerous successful comedies, has
collaborated with Basil Mac Donald
Hastings in this extremely modern
farce.
Is a Light, Lively Comedy
"The Angel in the House," as con
trasted with "Craig's Wife" and "Loy-,
alties," is a lighthearted, agreeable !
