# MUSEUM STAFF IS ASSEMBLING POSTERS TO GO ON EXHIBITION
## 
### 
Museum staff employees are busy
assembling the war posters of the
Hoover War Library which are to be
011 exhibition at the Thomas Welton
Stanford Art Gallery from August 3
to 31.
These posters indicate how the
artist's skill was utilized to create a
spirit of service among the citizens
of the countries engaged in the World
War.
Of particular interest are the Ameri
can posters, some of which are the
work of the well-known artist, Joseph
Pennell.
The gaudily-colored and almost
comic posters from Russia are in
marked contrast to the forceful sil
houette posters of the British artists.
Among the countries represented
by these posters are the United States,
Britain, France, Austria, Russia,
Australia, and Germany.
