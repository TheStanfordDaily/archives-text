# Brilliancy of Cast Marks Local Presentation of Galsworthy’s ‘Loyalties’
## 
### Back Row 
Marked by an individually brilliant
cast in the main, John Galsworthy's
"Loyalties" Friday night was a suc
cess.
Although there was at times a ten
dency toward forgotten lines, and dis
tinct changes in the tempo of the
play, fault for this can be assigned in
part, at least, to the confusion of the
many scene changes called for in the
script. No less than six of these
changes were demanded —a heavy toll
on any inexperienced stage crew.

To Raymond Haizlip, taking the I
part of De Levis, a Jew, belongs the
major portion of the honors for the I
evening. Playing the part of a mem- |
her of a race which is met with scorn j
in England, yet oftentimes accepted j
forMts money and ability, haizlip j

faced a difficult role. Extraordinary
control of voice and gesture, for an
amateur performance, made his char
acterization excellent. He successfully
kept it out of the class of mere bur
lesque.
Carrying with Haizlip the emotional
burden of the play, Dorothy Gamier
and Sam Hayes fulfilled advance
notices. Miss Gamier, as Mabel, the
wife of Captain Dancy, was one of the
highlights of the show. Remaining
loyal to the end, despite first her pre
monitions and then her actual knowl
edge cf her husband's guilt, Miss Gar
nier gave a performance of fine and
subtle acting.

Of the other characters, the finest
portrayals were perhaps given by Eu
