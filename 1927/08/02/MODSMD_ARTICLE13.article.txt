# Brilliancy of Cast Marks Local Presentation of Galsworthy’s ‘Loyalties’
## 
### Back Row 
Marked by an individually brilliant
cast in the main, John Galsworthy's
"Loyalties" Friday night was a suc
cess.
Although there was at times a ten
dency toward forgotten lines, and dis
tinct changes in the tempo of the
play, fault for this can be assigned in
part, at least, to the confusion of the
many scene changes called for in the
script. No less than six of these
changes were demanded —a heavy toll
on any inexperienced stage crew.

To Raymond Haizlip, taking the I
part of De Levis, a Jew, belongs the
major portion of the honors for the I
evening. Playing the part of a mem- |
her of a race which is met with scorn j
in England, yet oftentimes accepted j
forMts money and ability, haizlip j

faced a difficult role. Extraordinary
control of voice and gesture, for an
amateur performance, made his char
acterization excellent. He successfully
kept it out of the class of mere bur
lesque.
Carrying with Haizlip the emotional
burden of the play, Dorothy Gamier
and Sam Hayes fulfilled advance
notices. Miss Gamier, as Mabel, the
wife of Captain Dancy, was one of the
highlights of the show. Remaining
loyal to the end, despite first her pre
monitions and then her actual knowl
edge cf her husband's guilt, Miss Gar
nier gave a performance of fine and
subtle acting.
Dancy Is Capable
Of the other characters, the finest
portrayals were perhaps given by Eu
gene de Hermida as Gilman, Frank
Baker as General Canygne, and
Charlese Binkley as Jacob Twisden. i
Even if we would, space does not per
mit us to enumerate the entire cast —
twenty in all.
De Hermida, characterizing an old, j
middle-class English merchant, gave
one of the finest bits of character act
ing that has been seen on the Stan- j
ford stage. To him goes the credit of !
the only spontaneous hand on the part
of the audience.
Frank Baker, as General Canynge, '
gave a fine and sure performance. A
maturity of voice, dignity of bearing, !
and excellent stage presence all con- j
tributed. Charles Binkley, as an Eng-1
lisli solicitor, despite a tendency to
confuse his lines, was very good at
times.
Essentially a Man's Play
As previously announced, the play 1
was essentially a man's play. Only j
two women besides Miss Gamier ap- :
peared in the cast, and they were
given but scant opportunity. Helen
Cooper, as Margaret Ornie, took ad- I
vantage of what chance she had, as
did Martha Montgomery, as Lady
Adella.
The end came almost too abruptly
for us. It wasn't until the final cur
tain that we suddenly realized the
cramped posture which the uncom
fortable Assembly Hall seats had
forced upon us.
The settings, executed by Leslie
Kiler, were artistically and techni
cally well done. And the scene j
changes, after all, considering the fa-1
cilities, were almost rapid enough. .>

To Raymond Haizlip, taking the I
part of De Levis, a Jew, belongs the
major portion of the honors for the I
evening. Playing the part of a mem- |
her of a race which is met with scorn j
in England, yet oftentimes accepted j
forMts money and ability, haizlip j

faced a difficult role. Extraordinary
control of voice and gesture, for an
amateur performance, made his char
acterization excellent. He successfully
kept it out of the class of mere bur
lesque.
Carrying with Haizlip the emotional
burden of the play, Dorothy Gamier
and Sam Hayes fulfilled advance
notices. Miss Gamier, as Mabel, the
wife of Captain Dancy, was one of the
highlights of the show. Remaining
loyal to the end, despite first her pre
monitions and then her actual knowl
edge cf her husband's guilt, Miss Gar
nier gave a performance of fine and
subtle acting.
Dancy Is Capable
Of the other characters, the finest
portrayals were perhaps given by Eu
gene de Hermida as Gilman, Frank
Baker as General Canygne, and
Charlese Binkley as Jacob Twisden. i
Even if we would, space does not per
mit us to enumerate the entire cast —
twenty in all.
De Hermida, characterizing an old, j
middle-class English merchant, gave
one of the finest bits of character act
ing that has been seen on the Stan- j
ford stage. To him goes the credit of !
the only spontaneous hand on the part
of the audience.
Frank Baker, as General Canynge, '
gave a fine and sure performance. A
maturity of voice, dignity of bearing, !
and excellent stage presence all con- j
tributed. Charles Binkley, as an Eng-1
lisli solicitor, despite a tendency to
confuse his lines, was very good at
times.
Essentially a Man's Play
As previously announced, the play 1
was essentially a man's play. Only j
two women besides Miss Gamier ap- :
peared in the cast, and they were
given but scant opportunity. Helen
Cooper, as Margaret Ornie, took ad- I
vantage of what chance she had, as
did Martha Montgomery, as Lady
Adella.
The end came almost too abruptly
for us. It wasn't until the final cur
tain that we suddenly realized the
cramped posture which the uncom
fortable Assembly Hall seats had
forced upon us.
The settings, executed by Leslie
Kiler, were artistically and techni
cally well done. And the scene j
changes, after all, considering the fa-1
cilities, were almost rapid enough. .>
Marked by an individually brilliant
cast in the main, John Galsworthy's
"Loyalties" Friday night was a suc
cess.
Although there was at times a ten
dency toward forgotten lines, and dis
tinct changes in the tempo of the
play, fault for this can be assigned in
part, at least, to the confusion of the
many scene changes called for in the
script. No less than six of these
changes were demanded —a heavy toll
on any inexperienced stage crew.
