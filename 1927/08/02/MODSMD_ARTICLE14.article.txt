Students are busy with rehearsals for

court of the Union on Thursday evening
at 8 o'clock. All students of the Summer
Quarter and the general public is invited
to the plays which will be presented by
casts carefully selected from the mem
bers of the class in English 118a.
Mrs. Margaret Shedd Kisich, in charge
of the class, will direct the productions.
The three plays which have been se
lected are "Finders Keepers," by George
Kelley; "When the Moon Falls," by
Webster Street, a Stanford law student,
and "Rivals," also written by a Stanford
student.
"Finders Keepers" depicts the struggle
which a woman has between her selfish
ness and her conscience, and "When the
Moon Falls" is a fantasy, with Pierrot
and Columbine as the chief characters.
The next program will be on August
10, when "The Cradle Song," by Sierra,
a Spanish writer, will be produced, and
following that will be a program of ex
perimental plays on August 23.
In preparation for these programs the
class gave a play under the direction of
Miss Dorothy Wilson on July 27. The
title of the play was "Saved," by J. W.
Rogers Jr., and was produced before the
class in the Little Theatre.
