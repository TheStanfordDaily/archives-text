# DR. BAILEY PLANS TO CARRY ON WORK IN BRITISH LIBRARIES
## 
### 
Dr. Margaret Bailey of the English
department will leave immediately after
the close of the summer quarter for a
year of travel and study in Europe. She
hopes to be able to check up the "Index
of Memoirs, Biographies, and Letters of
England in the Eighteenth Century,"
which she has in hand, through material
in the British Museum. In that collec
tion and in the Bodleian she hopes, also,
to carry on studies of Boswell's novel,
"Dorando," which he suppressed soon
after its publication.
Professor Bailey will sail from San
Francisco early in September, going
through the Panama Canal, and spending
the time until spring on the continent.
The remainder of her year she will pass
in England.
Before packing her books for the year,
Dr. Bailey is selling a number of volumes
of poetry, historical works and modern
novels, which she has in her office, where
they may be seen Tuesday and Thursday
mornings.
