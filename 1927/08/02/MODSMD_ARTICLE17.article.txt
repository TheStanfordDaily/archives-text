# LARGE TENT BEING ERECTED FOR HORSE EXHIBIT NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Workmen employed on the Horse
Show grounds are concentrating their
attention on the construction of the
large tent being put up in preparation
for the coming show which opens on
August 8.
So many last-minute entries have
been coming in that it has been found
necessary to greatly enlarge the pres
ent stable facilities. Eighty-five addi
tional stalls are being constructed in
addition to the R.O.T.C. stables and
artillery sheds. The complete entry
list is expected to be over 350
head of horses.
The present box stalls around the
ball field are being placed in final
readiness for the arrival of a number
of consignments of horses which are
expected this week. The first stable,
which is expected to arrive today, con
sists of twenty-five head and com
prises the entrants of the Bridgeford
brothers of Illinois.
