# REID WILL DISCUSS RELATION OF NATURE AND ART TONIGHT
## 
### 
In a lecture this evening on "Aes
thetic Experience in Art and in Na
ture," Professor Louis A. Reid of the
University of Liverpool will inquire
into the different ways in which our
experiences work when we get an
aesthetic experience from a work of
art on one hand and from the contem
plation of nature on the other.
Will Make Comparison
There has been a tendency in the
philosophy of aesthetics to say that
nature can only be said to be beauti
ful insofar as nature is looked at as
art. Professor Reid will question this
tendency in his lecture.
He believes that the experience to
be obtained from art and that to be
had from the contact with nature dif
fer from one another, but both are
aesthetic. Professor Reid intends to
compare the one with the other.
