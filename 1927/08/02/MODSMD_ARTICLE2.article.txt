# FOUNDATIONS FOR STADIUM ADDITION NOW BEING LAID
## 
### 
Piles to support the additional fourteen
rows of scats in the stadium have been
driven for more than half the distance
around the rim, and the preliminary work
for the addition itself is under way. The
pile driver having been worked far
enough around by rush work to be out
of the way of the workmen on the next
stage of construction, the double shift
operating it has been discontinued and
its work will be finished with a single
shift.
Immense timbers of creosotcd Oregon
pine are now being laid across the tops
of the piles to furnish a solid' foundation
for the added tiers of seats. As soon as
these have been placed half way around
the-stadium, the final stage will be begun
and worked backward toward the start
ing point, to avoid having to haul ma
terial past the work already completed.
Then the other side of the rim will be
completed in the same manner.
A narrow gauge railroad track has
been laid from the. ground level up the
incline to the path around the rim, and
will be used to haul lumber to the point
where the seat superstructure is being
erected. The cars are pulled up the in
cline by a winch and cable.
Within ten days the engineer in charge
expects to have work far enough along
to make it possible to increase the num
ber of laborers greatly and add speed to
the construction work.
