# WARNER BACK ON CAMPUS READY FOR HARD GRID SEASON
## Must Rebuild Stanford Line To Meet Better Teams Than Last Year EXPECTS CLOSE GAMES Coach Will Be Busy for a Month With Printing Of His New Book 
### 
Glenn S. Warner, Stanford football
coach, returned to the campus yester
day from a two-month trip in various
parts of the United States, and will
devote himself for a month to super
vising the publication of his book,
"Football for Players and Coaches,"
before the opening of the Pacific Coast
Conference training season on Sep
tember 15.
The Pacific Coast teams will be
more evenly matched this year than
they have been for a long time, War
ner thinks. He expects team.j that
were weak last year to be stronger
this season. Stanford, which was Con
ference champion last year, faces the
problem of rebuilding portions of its
machine which have been removed by
graduation.
Hard Games Come Early
Since the Stanford playing schedule
t4iis year calls for some harder games
earlier in the season than in former
years, the varsity will have to bo
brought to effective playing strength
early. The first week calls for two
games on one day, one with the Olym
pic Club and one with Fresno State
Teachers College. The aggressive St.
Mary's eleven comes in the second
week, while the fourth week will
bring the clash with U.S.C., and
U.S.C.'s aggregation certainly does not
look like soft pickings this year.
Must Find an End
"Pop's" biggest job of the year is to
rebuild the line. The loss of the two
outstanding ends, Ted Shipkey and
Ed Walker, will seriously impair the
strength of the front wall, and while
one of these positions may be filled
by "Spud" Harder, a plucky and ex
perienced player of last year, the
other vacancy will have to be filled
from last year's subs or from the
ranks of last season's frosh. It is pos
sible that some shift may be made in
the lineup to protect this weak spot.
. The loss of Captain Fred Swan at
guard and Ward Poulson at tackle will
be keenly felt on this year's line and
this will constitute quite a problem
for Warner.
Good Backfield Material
Although the absence of George
Bogue will greatly hamper the smash
ing power of the varsity backfield,
"Pop" will have no such dearth of
returning backfield letter men to woik
with as faces him in the line. The
tall form of "Biff" Hoffman will once
more haunt the Stanford practice field,
and from last year's record is likely to
haunt the dreams of coaches of other
colleges. Weaving Mike Murphy will
be on the job and will have plenty of
company at half in Frank Wilton,
Don Hill, Bob Sims, and Dick Hyland,
all of them last year's letter men.
Last year's letter men who will re
turn for the season's work are: Don
Robesky, guard; Hal Mc.Creery. cen
ter; Theo Harder, end; Chris Free
man. tackle; "Biff" Hoffman, fullback;
Eli Post, quarter; Mike Murphy, half
back; Laurence Lewis, quarter; Frank
Wilton, half; Don Hill, half; Hank
Millage, quarter; Bob Sims, half, and
Ernie Patcliett, full.
Men Who Are Lost
Stanford will lose the following men
either through their not returning to
the campus or on account of ineligi
bility: Captain Fred Swan, George
Bogue, Ted Shipkey, Ed Walker, Leo
Harris, Ward Poulson, Nat Symonds,
Stan Natcher, and Julius Trombetta.
Part of Warner's time during his
absence from the campus was taken
up in teaching football. He spent one
week at the Colorado Agricultural
College and two weeks at the State
Normal School at Superior, Wisconsin.
