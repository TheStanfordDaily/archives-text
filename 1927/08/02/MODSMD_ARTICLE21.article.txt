# BASKETBALL PAVILION TO BE SCENE FRIDAY OF LOESSER RECITAL
## 
### 
The Basketball Pavilion will be con
verted into a music auditorium next
Friday evening for the piano recital
of Arthur Loesser as it was for the
symphonies and other largely attended
musical events during the earlier
quarters of the year. Loesser's reputa
tion and popularity as a concert pian
ist are so widespread that Director Sel
lards had made this arrangement be
fore plans had been completed for the
work that has closed the Assembly
Hall for the remainder of the summer.
This recital is one of the musical
programs presented by the Director
of the Summer Quarter for the benefit
of the campus and neighboring com
munities, and admission will be with
out charge.
Loesser is an accomplished and
thoroughly-trained musician. He is not
only a pianist but a teacher and de
votee of chamber music, as well. He is
at present a member of the piano fac
ulty at the Cleveland Institute of
Music.
Born and educated in New York
City, he began his musical studies at
the age of six. His father, a music
teacher, recognizing his talent, of
fered him first violin lessons, but he
soon showed preference for the piano,
and his first piano lessons were given
by Elizabeth Strauss, a Leschetizky
pupil. Later he studied with Sigismund
Stojowski.
In 1911 he was graduated with hon
ors from the Institute of Musical Art
in New York and won a year's study
abroad. His European debut took place
in Berlin two years later. At the out
break of the war he returned to
America, where he started his concert
career. Up to 1924 he toured the
United States, Australia, and the
Orient with various eminent musi
cians.. For three years Mr.Loesser
has been devoting his time to solo
work, ensemble and teaching.
