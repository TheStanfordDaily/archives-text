# Friendship Between Nations
## 
### 
Yesterday about 120 officers and cadets of the Japanese navy visited
the campus. These men are in this country, not on any mission, but
merely as part of their training. A purely friendly visit.
In an entirely different part of the world, representatives of this
country and of Japan are meeting together, officially, to attempt a more
perfect agreement between the two nations as to naval forces.
Some day, those men who visited the campus here will he naval officers,
will be politicians, or merchants, in their own country. That they should
be here on such a friendly journey speaks more loudly for future amity
among nations than any number of conferences. After all. what is most
needed to perfect an understanding between the two nations, is first an
understanding among the peoples of the two countries. Nowadays, per
manent treaties are built with this as a basis.
