# Are You Disillusioned?
## 
### 
In a lecture on contemporary literature Professor Spaeth will discuss
"the era of disillusionment and the new realism," using the works of
modern writers as illustrations.
There can be no doubt this is the age of disillusionment. It is an
nounced to us subtlely, satirically or violently, according to the tempera
ment of the writer. Some proclaim it with great joy. others with poignant
regret. But there is no escaping it.
If you have not yet experienced disillusionment, dive into modern
fiction, and you will come up. if at all. a sadder but a wiser man. If you
absorb the spirit of the age too well, you may become an author yourself
and help to disillusion others.
