# Roble and a Dance
## 
### 
Roble Club, hoping, to meet the demand for campus dances, decided
Sunday to give another dance this quarter. Yesterday, on taking a survey
of those interested, the number answering affirmatively was so small as to
call for cancellation of plans.
Now what, we inquire, could be the reason for this? Could it be that
the four-week imminence of finals could cause these women to lose sight
of the amusing qualities of social pleasure? It can't be because of an over
abundance of mature minds —because we are only as old as we let our
selves be. Perhaps they didn't want a dance after all. We ask you.
