# EACH STUDENT BUYS MORE AT UNION NOW THAN AT OTHER TIMES
## 
### 
Summer school students and their
nickels are more easily parted, ac
cording to a study comparing the
Union Store sales this quarter with
those of other divisions of the year.
According to Miss Christine Ricker,
Assistant Director of the Union, the
Summer Quarter students spend more
per capita in campus stores than do
those attending Stanford during the
rest of the year.
Candy Has Fall-Off
With the coming of the Summer
Quarter the cigar business Ynore than
doubles. Sales of ice cream reached a
total of eighty-four gallons for a week
at the Corner Store and Cafeteria.
Orange juice averaged twelve gallons
a day for each day. Although the sale
of tobaccoes, ice cream, and soft
drinks increases with the coming of
the Summer Quarter, sales in candy
bars fall off markedly.
It was found that a better quality
of ice cream, as well as a slightly
larger quantity, could be served the
public through home manufacture.
Some of the creameries, which manu
facture ice cream on a commercial
scale, aerate their product to make it
light and fluffy, Miss Ricker says. In
this way less ice cream is required
to fill each scoop. The Union takes
less profit and eliminates the air.
New Plant Successful
The ice cream manufacturing plant
installed by the Union last winter has
proved successful as a business enter
prise. A large amount of the home
manufactured product is sold to
Searsville Lake people and to small
stores in this neighborhood. Orange
juice and a number of punches are
side products of the plant.
Over 1,000,000 cigarettes, 400,000 of
them Lucky Strikes, 310,000 of them
Chesterfields, and 200,000 Camels
passed through the hands of the Union
last term. That chewing gum is not
chewed by stenographers alone is em
phatically expressed in the sale of
26,000 sticks from October 1 to June
38.
