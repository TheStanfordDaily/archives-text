# PSYCHOLOGIST MARES STUDY OF ACTIONS OF STANFORD MEN
## 
### 
Is such a thing in Psychology
as "motor ability?" Does ability in one
motor performance of a person imply
ability in others? If ability is once
acquired is it permanent? What is its
relationship to the skill required for
such practical pursuits as athletics,
piano-playing, and typewriting? These
questions are being answered by Ru
pert H. Seashore, National Research
Council Fellow in Psychology, who is
conducting a series of tests this quar
ter on a group of 50' Stanford men.
There are eight different tests which
measure sponsori-motor co-ordination.
The eye-hand co-ordination test, for
instance, consists in watching a mov
ing target and describing its course
with the hand. All the subjects being
tested are new to experiments of this
sort. Subjects who acquired skill in
certain motor performances a year
ago, however, were recently re-tested
and found to retain much of their skill.
In order to see if athletes and musi
cians have all-around motor ability a
group of University varsity athletes
and accomplished musicians are being
tested. There will be no definite re
sults from these until the end of the
summer, however, says Seashore. He
is also interested to discover whether
individual differences persist during
training or if practice equalizes ability.
He hopes to find out if a person who
starts out with a low or an average
score can equal the highest score in
time; and also if the person first ob
taining the highest score can rate even
higher after practice.
