# SPAETH TO PRESENT AMERICAN WRITERS AS TYPICAL OF ERA
## Lecturer From Princeton to Portray Current Literary Trend Tomorrow 
### 
Recent American writers will be used as
illustrations of the current trend of liter
ature by Professor J. Duncan Spaeth oi
Princeton in his lecture on "Tendencies
in Contemporary Literature" in the Lit
tle Theatre tomorrow afternoon. Profes
sor Spaeth terms the present as an era
of "disillusionment and the new realism,"
and he will cite such Americans as Drei
ser. Sandburg, Masters, Sinclair Lewis,
and Cabell, not so much to interpret them
or analyze their work as to let them
serve for American readers who are
familiar with their books as typical of
this era.
These American authors Profesor
Spaeth perceives as participating in the
general revolt against a former "senti
mental" attitude toward life and a violent
break with old literary traditions, leading
to the intense realism of the newer gener
ation of writers in all tongues.
Professor Spaeth came to the Univer
sity of California for the summer session
there. He is a man of wide contacts
with life outside his scholarly interests.
He is an expert oarsman and during the
Worl War organized training for illiter
ates in camps, editing a reader for these
soldiers that was officially adopted by
the War Department. He has been a
membcj of the board of managers of the
New Jersey state reformatory.
The lecture will be given at 4:15
o'clock and is open to the public.
