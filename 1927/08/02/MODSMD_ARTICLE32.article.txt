# FAMOUS OLD BIBLES AMONG TREASURES STORED IN LIBRARY
## 
### 
Bibles, old ones, queer ones, fancy
ones, are anions the treasures to be
found in the library.
One of them, the Miles Coverdale
Facsimile was printed in 1535 by Tindal
and Coverdale and is of the first Pro
testant Edition, one copy of which sold
for 365 pounds sterling.
Another is a Sheng Keng Bible, which
is a first translation into Cantonese style.
There is also a Hudson and Goodwin
Bible published in 1815.
A Modern Doves Press Bible, ex
hioited in the foyer of the library, has
an appeal for booklovers as an example
of unusually fine printing.
An amusing story is attached to the
reason for the name of the Breeches
Bible, one which came out in the six
teenth century before the King James
version. Instead of the usual tale about
affairs, it very quaintly states that
"Adam and Eve saw that they were
naked and sewed fig leaves together
and made themselves breeches." And
so the name, Breeches Bible.
Several of the professors on the cam
pus have valuable and unusual books in
their possession. Professor Kennedy,
of the English department, has a first
edition King James Bible of the year
1611, and a Samuel Johnson Dictionary,
in which are found strange and startling
words quite unknown in modern usage.
One is led to believe that cats must
have held a much more important place
in society at large than they do at the
present time, for one word "Caticism"
is defined as the "killing of a cat."
