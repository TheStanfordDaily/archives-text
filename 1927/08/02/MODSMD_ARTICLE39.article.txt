# SPORTS OF 1927
## A 						Melhorn Year? 
### BY “FEG MURRAY, ’16 
Will this be a Bill year? 1926 was not .
so good to champions and near-champions
by the name of William. Witness what j
happened to Big Bill Tilden, Little Billy
Johnston, Bill Sherdel, Bill McKechnie, j
Bill Stribling, Willie MacFarlane, Willie
Hoppe, and William H. Dempsey. At
least this last Bill has made one step
back recently. His next may be argued !
about.
Here is my nomination of one Bill who !
is due to collect in 1927. His name is
William Melhorn, and he has been knock
ing at the door of golf greatness" for a
long time. Such an incessant pounding
cannot long be ignored, and some day
"Wild Bill" Mehlhorn is due to crash
through into real fame. Of course, he is
famous already, but by "real fame" 1
mean winning a national open champion
ship. Mehlhorn belongs to that select
group of golfers who seem right on a
par with the best in the world, but are
never quite able to win a national title.
Mac Smith and Abe Mitchell are two
others.
The last few United States open cham
pionships have been a series of heart
breakers for Wild Bill Mehlhorn. In
1926. he tied for third, four strokes be
hind Bobby Jones. In 1925, he was not
so lucky, scoring a 301 to Jones's and
MacFarlane's 291, ut in 1924 lie finished
third, after leading the field for the first
two rounds. . 1923 found him. ~as two
years later, ten strokes behind the win
ner, but the start of the final round in
1922 found him sharing the lead with
Bobby Jones. However, he was two
strokes back of Gene Sarazen, the win
ner, and one behind John Black and
Bobby Jones, at the finish.

Mehlhorn finished up the year 1926 in
California as he started it, by winning an
important tournament, this time the Sac
ramento open. lie won it with an ave
rage of 69 for the three rounds, too, and
after everybody had predicted that he
was through because of an accident last
fall to the index finger of his right hand.
So keep your eye on Blond Bill Mehl
horn, the long-driving, roitsering, loud
voiced, free-land professional. Victory
in an open championship cannot forever
elude this outstanding figure of the great
iraine of trolf.
