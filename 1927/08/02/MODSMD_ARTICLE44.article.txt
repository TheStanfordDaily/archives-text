# “Only the American College Has Campus,” says Charlier
## 
### 
Campuses belong exclusively to
American colleges. Of our many edu
cational characteristics, the college
campus is the most distinct and, in a
way, it interprets all the others. It
was one of the first novelties im
pressed on Dr. Gustave Charlier, pro
fessor of Letters at the University of
Brussels, Belgium, after his arrival in
the United States, and it was one of
his first comments on the American
institution of higher learning.
Dr. Charlier has come to Stanford
through the co-operation of the C.R.B.
Education Fund. This fund, an out
growth of the work of the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium, is employed
in fostering exchanges of students and
professors between universities of the
United States and Belgium. A num
ber of Belgian professors have made
lecture tours of universities in the
United States, but Dr. Charlier is the
first one who has come here as a mem
ber of the faculty for a full term.
Dr. Charlier hesitated to criticize
any but the most obvious features of
the American college, since his ex
perience is limited to the University
of Chicago, which he visited as a tour
ist, and Stanford, in which he is a
faculty member for the summer quar
ter.
Stanford a Big Family
He did describe his first impres
sion of Stanford as a campus com
munity. "Stanford is a large family.
It is so attentive to the lives of its
students, and the relation of student
and professor is so informal that the
University may be said to have not
only a code of scholarship but also
one of friendship.
"The Belgian university," he ex
plained, "puts at the student's dis
posal its lectures and its library. It
examines him on the results of his
work and lets him go."
Not only the area occupied by the
American collegiate halls but also the
scale and scope of the institutions
themselves impressed him: the multi
tudes of students representing a social
variety; the number and size of the
buildings housing a single college; the
immense libraries, the number of vol
umes and the number of hours a day
they are accessible to students."
Belgian Universities Compact
Dr. Charlier's reaction at first sight

of the American campus gives a con
trasting idea of the compactness and
concentration of the Belgian universi
ties. Within its self-imposed precinct,
the American university is aloof and
self-sufficient. "Belgian and French
universities are located in towns. The
four universities of Belgium: Liege,
Gand, Brussels, and Louvain, are
named for their respective cities. Two
of them, Liege and Gand, are directed
by the State; Brussels and Louvain
are endowed institutions and privately
organized.
"The Belgian university represents
not the French, but the Dutch, educa
tional method —a survival of united
Flanders. Students are ohosen for the
aptitude they have shown in prepara
tory school and not through competi
tive examinations like the French bac
calauriat; but the choice excludes all
students of technology, who take an
entrance examination in their subject.
The series of "grades" imposed by
this system does not correspond to
the undergraduate and graduate
courses in an American college. "The
first of these grades," explained Dr.
Charlier, "is known as the 'candida
ture'; it consists in two years of study
directed by the faculty and planned
to fit the student for an examination,
success in which entitles him to the
degree of 'candidat'."
The "candidature" is a liberal
course, but it prepares him for spe
cialized study in the future. "The
broadness of this foundation is another
respect in which the curriculum of
the Belgian university differs from
the characteristic course of lectures
offered by the French university, in
which the student specializes from
beginning to end."
After he has passed his "candida

ture," the Belgian student holds the
degree of "candldat" of "philosophie
et Iettres" or of "sciences," indicating
the dominant trend of his course.
"Two or three years of specialized or
vocational study follow the 'candida
ture,' adapted to the requirements for
either of two degrees: the 'doctorat'
and the 'doctorat special.' Both re
quire not only the restricted post
'candidature,' but also kindred study
during the 'candidature'.
"All the Belgian universities are
co-educational," said Dr. Charlier.
"Louvain has been open to women
students only within the last year. In
the other three the proportionate num
ber of women students is larger than
at Stanford."
