# DR. WILBUR AGAIN HEADS INSTITUTE OF PACIFIC RELATIONS
## 
### 
At the conclusion of the session of
! the Institute of Pacific Relations in
Honolulu on July 29, President Ray
Lyman Wilbur was re-elected to the
chairmanship for the next two years,
an office he has held since the origin
of the Institute five years ago. Presi
dent Wilbur is on his way home and
will reach the campus Saturday, Au
gust 6. His stay here will in all proba
bility be brief, however.
Dr. Wilbur was quoted in press dis
patches as expressing great satisfac
tion with this year's accomplishments.
The purpose of the Institute, in which
Dr. Wilbur has been a leading figure
since its inception, is to deal unoffi
cially with the international problems
of the nations surrounding the Pacific
basin, with the idea of promoting in
telligent public opinion as the basis
of wise action.
The body meets every other year.
The industrialization of the Far East
and the immigration question were
chief topics this year. Two other Stan
ford men, Dr. Carl Alsberg of the
Food Research Institute and Profes
sor Eliot G. Mears of the Graduate
School of Business, were delegates
from the United States this year and
took leading parts in the discussions.
