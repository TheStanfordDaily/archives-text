## Few Matches Left to Play; Should Be Over Soon, Says Davis 
### 
Leighton Bledsoe remained today

semi-finals of the intramural tennis
tournament.
Byron R. Snow, Paul H. Mockett,
and Nathan Morse have yet to play
off their matches in the third round.
The winner of these matches will meet
Castellanos and then Bledsoe will play
the winner in the final round.
Joseph Castellanos, by a victory over
Paul A. LaChapelle, 6-4, 6-1, has
emerged into the quarter finals of the
tournament. His victory was consid
ered almost inevitable before the
match but his young opponent, handi
capped by less experience, played an
excellent first set and made Castel
lanos work his hardest to overcome
him.
Leighton Bledsoe, a graduate stu
dent of Stanford and a ranking varsity
player of last year, advanced into the
semi-finals of the tournament last Fri
day afternoon by a victory over Eli
Bashor, the racquet-handler of San
Mateo Junior College faculty, 6-4, 8-6.
It was an exceptionally hard-fought
match, but it ended in a simple case
of consistency against hard, erratic
tennis, in which the former won out.
Bledsoe played his usual game, plac
ing at leisure, covering the court ex
cellently, and using his head to the
greatest advantage.
According to Coach "Hal" Davis, the
tournament will be completed by* the
end of this week.
