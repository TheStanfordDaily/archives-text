# RINGS OF SATURN WILL BE SEEN ON LICK TRIP TOMORROW
## Stanford Excursionists to View 1913 Earthquake Records 
### 
Two rings and four principle sate
lites of the planet Saturn will be visi
ble through the telescope to those
making the trip to Lick Observatory
tomorrow evening.
The image of Saturn is always
bathed in a purple glow which makes
it one of the most interesting and
beautiful of the heavenly bodies. The
planet at present is approximately
400,000,000 miles from the earth and
is comparatively brilliant.
One of the seismographs on display
at the observatory recorded the recent
Japanese earthquake. There is also a
chart of the seismographic record of
the famous 1913 earthquake there,
showing the two tremors, one through
the center of the earth and the other
along the surface. In addition there
will be a view of the mountains of the
moon through the 12-inch telescope.
The road is in excellent shape and
several Stanford students who mo
tored to the observatory last Satur
day reported having seen wild deer as
they passed through the state game
preserves.
Those making the excursion are ad
vised to bring their own supper as
there will be no opportunity to secure
any at the top of the mountain.
Reservations will be accepted until
4 o'clock today at 173 Administration
Building. The price for the trip is $3.
Busses will leave from the Union at
