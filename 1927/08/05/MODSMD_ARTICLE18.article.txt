# Arthur Loesser To Give Recital Tonight
## Has Gained International Reputation Through His Tours 
### 
What is a "musician ab intra?" That
is how Arthur Loesser, guest musi
cian this evening, has been described.
By definition, a "musician ab intra"
is one who combines with his mental
and technical powers a certain "ful
ness of heart" and "largeness of soul"
â€”who makes use of all his innate
powers.
In addition to this unusual quality,
Mr. Loesser has a second distinction,
a sense of "absolute pitch." He has the
ability to detect, remember, and dif
ferentiate between tones as easily as
one detects colors.
"It is not a feat, neither the result
of a sensitive or highly cultivated
organ," says Mr. Loesser. "It is wholly
a thing of the musical mind, that is,
the tone memory. This sense is not
strictly an essential to success, but it
is obviously a great aid."
Loesser, who will appear this eve
ning at 8 o'clock in the Basketball
Pavilion, is a pianist of great repute,
having been associated with such
well-known artists as Maud Powell,
Mischa Elman, and Schumann-Heink.
More recently, he has appeared as
soloist with such well-known organiza
tions as the Cleveland Symphony Or
chestra, under the direction of Nikolai
Sokoloff, the New York Symphony,
and the Stringwood Ensemble. In ad
dition to his other activities, he is at
present a member of the faculty of the
Cleveland Institute of Music.
His program for tonight follows:
Italian Concerto Bach
Allegro
Andante
Presto
Impromptu B Flat Schubert
Valse A Flat
Nocturne F Sharp
Etude G Flat Chopin
Berceuse
Ballade A Flat
Jeux d'eau Ravel
Au jardin du neux serail Blanchet
The Gardens of Buitenzorg (from
the Java Suite) Godowsky
Rhapsodie E Flat Brahms
The number of compositions written
by composers of romantic music will
give Mr. Loesser a chance for inter
pretation which will be in line with
the nature of his genius.
The program is open to the public,
and will be entirely free of charge.
