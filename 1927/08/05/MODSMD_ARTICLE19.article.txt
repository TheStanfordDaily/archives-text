# CAPACITY AUDIENCE SEES THREE PLAYS IN LITTLE THEATRE
## Program Includes Comedies By Former Stanford Students 
### 
Three one-act plays were presented
last night by the play production class
to a large audience which filled the
Little Theatre to capacity.
Make-up. stage management, proper
ty provision, and direction were han
dled by members of the class. The per
formance was supervised by Mrs. Mar
garet Shedd Kisich.
An outstanding feature of the pre
sentation was that the first two plays
were written by former Stanford stu
dents, "Rivals" by. Evelyn Brownell,
and "When the Moon Falls" by Web
ster Street. The third play, "Finders-
Keepers," was written by George
Kelley.
Scene in Tea-Room
"Rivals" took place in a tea-room
operated by two maiden sisters, the
house-wifely Jennie, Mary Willis, and
the pretty, care-free Nellie. Carol
Lasater, who were apparently destined
to be old maids for life. Both bent
their efforts toward one of the few
eligible men in the small town only
to discover after a time that he was
already engaged. Bert Davis, as Mr.
Hetz, the "eligible man," played his
part remarkably well.
Lovers Asleep in Woods
"When the Moon Falls" found
Columbine, Katheryn Peck, and Pier
rot. Kenneth Mc√üae, lost, asleep, and
dreaming in the woods. Pierrot, with
a tremendous desire for the moon,
dreamed that it had fallen nearby;
Columbine dreamed of an even greater
desire, food. They awoke, one to search
for the moon, the other to bewail the
lack of nourishment and the love of
her moon-sick companion. The lone
some and hungry Columbine was vis
ited by a cake vender. Harlequin, Har
old Brounson, who would exchange a
tart for love, but the bargain was not
made before Pierrot returned with his
"moon," a gold coin. With this the
tart was bought and an appetite satis
fied. Pierrot, his dream shattered, goes
into a trance, and things darken. The
custain falls as Columbine, nourished,
thinks again of love and calls for the
departing Pierrot.
Finds Four Hundred Dollars
In "Finders-Keepers," Mrs. Aldrid,
Clarita Hunsberger, is the finder of
four hundred dollars, and thinks she
[ should keep it. Aldrid, J. R. Besse,
! thinks not. Apparently Mrs. Hampton.
| Esther Brown, a neighbor, is the
loser. The finder, in doubt, refuses to
| confess. The plot unravels as Mrs.
Aldrid discovers that she, in turn, has
lost the money. Mr. Aldrid then pun
gles up and remunerates his neighbor
j for her, which is now his loss.
