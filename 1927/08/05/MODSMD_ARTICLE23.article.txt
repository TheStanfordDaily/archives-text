# A Summer Concert
## 
### 
This evening in the Basketball Pavilion there wilKbe offered the op
portunity to hear a famous pianist in recital, in the person of Arthur
Loesser.
As was demonstrated last winter and spring quarters, the Pavilion is
a satisfactory place for holding concerts and musical performances of all
kinds. Two groups of concerts were given there, one promoted by the
students, and the other by the Peninsula Musical Association.
We say that the Pavilion is a "satisfactory" place. The music can be
heard there, but it is not the kind of an auditorium we ought to have.
We have no wholly suitable auditorium at Stanford. As the Palo
Alto Times said last night:
"It is to be hoped that at some time, not too far distant, the expansion
plans at Stanford University will include the building of a real theatre.
Jt is an item which in our judgment would be certain to find much support
from the local off-campus population. We can guarantee hearty ap
proval, anyhow."
That's the difficulty: Everybody would approve, but who will sup
port? With sufficient support, Stanford would do many things it cannot
do, including building the assembly hall it needs.
