### 
Combining an understanding of the University with the skill of an
experienced writer, Mrs. Katherine Ames Taylor, a Stanford woman,
has put the spirit as well as the history of Stanford into her book, Ihe
Romancc of Stanford.
Stanford's history and present standing as an educational institution,
a pioneer into new fields, a leader in experiments, is one phase of the
University. But another phase, which is just as much a part of the
University, is the atmosphere of the campus, its simplicity and democ
racy. Mrs. Taylor has caught both of these, and has woven them to
gether into a picture that is Stanford. The photographs, by Mr. Stone,
have also caught the spirit.
The book itself should be of value to all Stanford students, both
past and present. As a memento, a souvenir of happy, sunshiny days on
the Quad, it is invaluable. Those who have become Stanford people
through being here this summer quarter, especially, will want this book
which epitomizes Stanford achievement and ideals.
