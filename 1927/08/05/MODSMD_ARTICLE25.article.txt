# A 						Horse Show for Stanford
## 
### 
Many of 11s have been wondering what was to be the fate of our
baseball field. Day after day a lrage crew of workmen has been busy,
building stands, stalls, a ring, stringing lights here and there, and doing
many other things to onr diamond. The infield has been covered with
tan-bark and rolled down. How it's coining up again, no one knows: but
there it is.
Be that as it may, we are glad to welcome the Northern California
Horse Show Association, and their third annual show, to the campus.
Such an affair as this seems rightly to belong here. After all, the old
Stanford farm was a training ground for horses before it became a
training ground for men and women. So it seems like welcoming back a
tradition to have the show here.
And the show deserves support, since the profits are to go to the
Stanford Convalescent Home.
