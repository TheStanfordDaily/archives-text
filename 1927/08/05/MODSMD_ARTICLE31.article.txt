# RUSH HORSE SHOW JOB IS SPORT FOR CRACK CARPENTERS
## 
### 
Carpentering on the campus took on
the aspect of an athletic contest among
the seven men employed at the Horse
Show, Tuesday evening. L. S. Legg,
construction boss, says that he will place
his seven men against any gang of twenty
men.
The reason for the carpenter's contest j
was the receipt of orders from the San'
Francisco headquarters for one hundred j
extra stalls, to be completed immediately.j
The order was received at 5:30 Tuesday]
evening, and Legg's men were on the job j
at 6 o'clock, after just a half-hour off;
for the night meal, and after having al
ready completed a hard day's work.
Saw Up Stock on Hand
All of the available lumber in Palo
Alto suited for building stalls was
brought over. By the time the lumber
trucks arrived, Legg's men had sawed up
a large pile of lumber already on the j
grounds and were nailing it together
into panels.
The men divided themselves into two'
crews and for the pure fun of the thing [
began to race each other. One man j
hauled the finished panels to the center ;
of the show grounds while the two cr »ws i
of three men each raced like mad.
Work After Dark
Electric lights were turned on and the !
work continued.
A panel, left unsupported for a mo-1
ment, toppled. Bert Legg, son of the j
construction boss, who intends to play j
fullback on the freshman team at Cali-1
forhia this year, caught it. The head j
carpenter and Legg almost Came to blows
over the few minutes' loss of time, so
great was the men's eagerness to beat
the other crew.
