Many Stanford students are earning
money this summer to pay their ex
penses for the coming university year.
Most of the Stanford men and women j
who are working this vacation secured j
their positions through the Stanford j
Appointment Office.
The Appointment Office is main- j
tained to assist students and grad- '■
uates to obtain permanent employ- j
ment or promotion in the kind of work !
for which they have been preparing j
themselves; to help students to find
suitable part-time or full-time employ
ment whether to earn money or to
become more proficient in their chosen :
field of work; and to give information !
regarding the actual opportunities
presented by the different fields of
employment.
Selling Most Popular
Selling is a very popular form of
-work with Stanford men, and it is |
almost the only work that enables I
the student to make enough during j
the summer to put him through a
year's work in the University. All
types of selling positions are filled
and range from magazines and alumi-1
num to refrigerators and automobiles.
Manual labor of all kinds is popular j
and a great number of these jobs;
were filled by the Appointment j
Office, while this kind of work does I
not pay so well as the sellig positions, j
it enables the student to secure a
physical return along with the finan-:
cial remuneration.
Many Students Tutor
Tutoring the small children of Penin- j
sula families has shown a decided
increase in popularity. The salaries
paid are good, and the work is pleas-;
ant and interesting. The student is j
often invited to go on many interest- \
ing summer trips as a companion to
the children. One student is travel
ling in Europe this summer as the
companion of two little boys. Many
others are taking charge of the child- ,
ren in various summer resorts while I
the parents travel.
There also has been a decided in- i
crease in chemical positions filled.
Last year one firm in particular hired
six Stanford students during the sum
mer to work in their California terri
tory. Their work was so satisfactory i
that this year only Stanford men were j
hired and put in administrative and !
executive positions throughout Wash- j
ington, and Oregon as well as Cali-,
fornia.
Numerous Outdoor Jobs
Many a student is enjoying a vaca
tion and receiving a salary at the
same time in summer camps. Here
the positions filled are those of hash-!
ers, electricians, cooks, boatmen, life >
guards, and camp managers.
Others with more specialized train- j
ing and a liking for the out of doors i
may be found in lumber camps and
mines, others insurveying and engi
neering parties, some in the Forestry ,
service and geological work.
The student with a preference for ;
city life may be found doing account- j
ing work in banks or other financial
organizations.
Many are doing chauffeuring work ,
and others are working for the post j
office, as clerks in stores, as steno- j
graphers and private secretaries, as j
teachers and librarians. Several posi- ■

tions for librarians were filled in Los
Angeles this year. Others have been
placed as store managers and one
group of musicians secured a position
on a round-the-world cruise.
Students who work represent all
types and classes in the University.
Undergraduate and graduate, men and
women. Hall and Row, athlete and Phi
Bete, all alike are represented.
