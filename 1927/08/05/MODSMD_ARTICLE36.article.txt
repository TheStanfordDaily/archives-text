# RECRUITING POSTERS NOW ON EXHIBIT AT STANFORD GALLERY
## English, German, Russian War Bulletins Among Those Shown 
### 
Different characteristic appeals used
in recruiting men for service in the j
Great War are portrayed by the war j
posters now on display in the Stan
ford Art Gallery.
The American, English, and Austra
lian posters represent or imply action !
and show studied care in their compo- |
sition. The German posters are of a
stolid nature and show less action or
emotion than the others. France and
Russia used highly emotional appeals,
the Russian posters in particular being
of a highly colored and sensational
nature. Japan's posters are more poeti- j
cal and artistic than those of the other
countries.
The Food and Relief posters appeal
more to reason and less to emotion ;
than those used in recruiting men.
This exhibit is part of the collection
of the Hoover War Library, and will
be on display until August 31.
