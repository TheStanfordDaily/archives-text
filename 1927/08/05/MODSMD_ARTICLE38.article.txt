# EXPOSURE IS BASIS OF REALISM, SAYS DR. DUNCAN SPAETH
## Sinclair Lewis Described As Romanticist With Furry Taste 
### 
"There are two kinds of books," re
marked Dr. J. Duncan Spaeth in his
lecture on Wednesday afternoon in
the Little Theatre, "books made out
of other books and books out of which
other books are made. The writers of
the present time are ignoring the
'literature of the past in their effort to
grapple in a frank, fresh, and sincere
•way with immediate human experi
ence."
Dr. Spaetli likened this modern ap
peal from books of experience to the
romanticism of Wordsworth and
Rousseau. He revealed a common ori
gin of the two movements in an exag
gerated idea of antithesis between
literature and life, and ascribed to
both a renewal of contact with life
as it is lived.
Dr. Spaeth also contrasted modern
fiction with that other phase of ro
manticism, "the literature of escape."
"Modern fiction is literature of attack.
It is the protest of the disappointed
romanticist, the reaction to overindul
gence in the literature of escape.
"Realism," he said, "is not an at
tempt to show life as it is. It is not
revelation; it is exposure."
He described Sinclair Lewis as "a
romanticist with a furry taste on his
tongue." "It's pathetic to see how hard
jVTr. Sinclair Lewis has taken his re
turn from romantic idealism. Only a
man who had expected a preacher of
the gospel to be perfection incarnate,
to be a Christ, could ever have written
•Rimer Gantry.' Lewis is suffering the
inevitable penalty for having misunder
stood and taken seriously the romantic
ideal.
"Great literature," he said, "is both
romantic and classic; both realistic
and idealistic. It does not contrast
with life, but helps the reader to un
derstand life. It is not an escape from
life, but an illumination of life."
