# Isolation Makes Stanford Unique According to Reid
## 
### 
"I doubt whether there's any other
university like this in the world,"
said Dr. Louis Arnaud Reid comment
ing on Stanford, where he Is a member
of the faculty this summer.
"Professor C. K. Webster who is
an old colleague of mine, says that
Stanford is unique and 1 believe he is
right."
Dr. Reid, who is independent lect
urer in philosophy at the University
of Liverpool, is acting professor of
philosophy at Stanford during the
summer quarter. Professor Webster,

to whom he refers, lectured at Stan
ford earlier in the summer and is a
member of the faculty of the Univer
sity of Wales.
The isolated location of Stanford
amid attractive surroundings was con
sidered the principal external charac
teristic which tends to make it unique.
"You couldn't imagine a greater con
trast," says Professor Reid, comparing
Stanford and the University of Liver
pool in their outward aspects. "At
Liverpool you go to the university in
fog and rain; you are never far from
the slums. There is soot everywhere.
The university is in the middle of the
dirt and roar of the city. Whenever I
walk from my home to the university
my face is speckled with soot."
Has Chance to See Life
There is one circumstance, however,
which compensates in part a student
who attends a university in a large
city such as Liverpool.

"A student who goes to a large uni
versity in an industrial center such
as Liverpool has a greater opportunity
to see life," declared, Professor Reid,
"He tends to know more about life
at first hand and that gives one who
comes to study ethics, psychology, or
social philosophy, a keenness and live
liness which cannot be present where
there is only an academic interest."
"In the big towns there is very little
communal life," continued Professor
Reid, "although at the colleges of
Aberystwyth, and Bangor, in Wales,
and at St. Andrews University in Scot
land, which are small, there is a great
deal.
" A student may go to his lectures
and not come into any contact with his
fellows in an institution in a metro
politan center. He may take rooms
and isolate himself completely. Hostels
for men and for women, which are the
same as dormitories, do not provide
for a great number,"
Asked about social groups in Eng
land like American college fraternities,
he said:
"I don't know of many merely social
clubs, beyond the general students'
union; tliey are mostly for some speci
fic and narrower purpose." The organ
izations that exist, he said, correspond
only to the academic societies or ath
letic clubs which are found in America.
Give Too Many Lectures
"Not nearly the same proportion
'to the square inch' go to universities
in England as in America,"he added,
emphasising a conspicuous difference
in the distribution of higher education
in the two countries. "And I want to
see university standards kept up all
around both in Great Britain and here.
Education ought to be given students
who can really benefit by it.
"In Great Britain we give, and
listen to too many lectures; but I do
not think we are as bud as you in
America. I believe in discussion,
where the size of the classes makes
it possible, but the difficulty is, of
course, the expense of staffing. Oxford
is an exception. It has been said
that a large part of an undergraduate's
education at Oxford consists in going
to the tutor's room and being 'smoked
at'. And in that phrase there's a world
of meaning. At Oxford, lectures do
not assume the same importance as
at other universities.,,

"I doubt whether there's any other
university like this in the world,"
said Dr. Louis Arnaud Reid comment
ing on Stanford, where he Is a member
of the faculty this summer.
"Professor C. K. Webster who is
an old colleague of mine, says that
Stanford is unique and 1 believe he is
right."
Dr. Reid, who is independent lect
urer in philosophy at the University
of Liverpool, is acting professor of
philosophy at Stanford during the
summer quarter. Professor Webster,

to whom he refers, lectured at Stan
ford earlier in the summer and is a
member of the faculty of the Univer
sity of Wales.
The isolated location of Stanford
amid attractive surroundings was con
sidered the principal external charac
teristic which tends to make it unique.
"You couldn't imagine a greater con
trast," says Professor Reid, comparing
Stanford and the University of Liver
pool in their outward aspects. "At
Liverpool you go to the university in
fog and rain; you are never far from
the slums. There is soot everywhere.
The university is in the middle of the
dirt and roar of the city. Whenever I
walk from my home to the university
my face is speckled with soot."
Has Chance to See Life
There is one circumstance, however,
which compensates in part a student
who attends a university in a large
city such as Liverpool.

"A student who goes to a large uni
versity in an industrial center such
as Liverpool has a greater opportunity
to see life," declared, Professor Reid,
"He tends to know more about life
at first hand and that gives one who
comes to study ethics, psychology, or
social philosophy, a keenness and live
liness which cannot be present where
there is only an academic interest."
"In the big towns there is very little
communal life," continued Professor
Reid, "although at the colleges of
Aberystwyth, and Bangor, in Wales,
and at St. Andrews University in Scot
land, which are small, there is a great
deal.
" A student may go to his lectures
and not come into any contact with his
fellows in an institution in a metro
politan center. He may take rooms
and isolate himself completely. Hostels
for men and for women, which are the
same as dormitories, do not provide
for a great number,"
Asked about social groups in Eng
land like American college fraternities,
he said:
"I don't know of many merely social
clubs, beyond the general students'
union; tliey are mostly for some speci
fic and narrower purpose." The organ
izations that exist, he said, correspond
