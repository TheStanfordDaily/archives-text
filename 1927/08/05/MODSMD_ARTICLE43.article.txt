### 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Company re
cently requested the Hoover War Li
brary to lend its assistance in supply
ing replicas of authentic war docu
ments tor a film which is to deal with
the downfall of the Austrian-Hun
garian monarchy.
A representative of the company
paid a visit to the War Library in
order that the picture, one of the "big
ger and better" variety, might not
suffer from technical inaccuracies.
Photographs of Franz-Joseph, his
proclamation of war. and official war
office letter headings and seals were
faithfully reproduced for the picture.
