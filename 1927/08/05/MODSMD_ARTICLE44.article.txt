# EXPERT PLANNING OF SCHOOLHOUSES TOPIC OF SAN JOSE SPEAKER
## Hill Discusses Building of Home Economics Rooms 
### 
Construction of school buildings
should be supervised by experts, says
Andrew P. Hall, assistant superin
tendent of schools at San Jose, in a
talk here Tuesday on the planning of
the home economics room in high
school buildings. He talked before
Professor John C. Almack's class in
School Buildings and Building Pro
grams.
Hill pointed out that many buildings
which are supposed to be model are
far from it, instancing a model bunga
low for teaching girls homemaking
which had no back door out of the
kitchen. He emphasized the fact that
the expense of buildings 'and their
long life make it imperative that their
construction should be supervised by
experts.
Mr. Hill is in charge of the school
building program at San Jose.
Word comes from Sacramento that
he has just been appointed head of
the division of school house planning
for the whole state. This position was
one of nine created to conform with
the legislation enacted by the last
legislature which provided nine divi
sion heads for a state department of
education.
Mr. Hill and Professor Almack are
at work on a book dealing with this
subject, which will be published early
in 1928 under the title, "School Build
ings and Building Programs".
