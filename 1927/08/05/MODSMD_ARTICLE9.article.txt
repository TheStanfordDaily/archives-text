# DAVIS HAS ROLE OF MISLEADING 'ANGEL' IN COMING PLAY
## Cast Progressing in Work On Last Production Of Summer MANY AMUSING SCENES Several New Members Are Included Among Actors 
### 
"Have you a little fairy in your
home?" One is reminded of this well
known slogan during the scenes pre
ceding the arrival of "The Angel,"
otherwise the Hon. Hyacinth Petaven,
in the house of his mother's dearest
friend, in the play, "The Angel in the
House," to be presented by the Stan
ford Dramatic Council Friday, August
12, at the New Stanford Theatre in
Palo Alto.
The plot revolves about the charac
ter of Hyacinth, his intended arrival
being accompanied by many jibes and
thrusts at his supposed effeminacy.
This part, which is taken by Gordon
Davis, is similar to the one Davis
played in "The Dover Road" two years
ago.
Nearly Wrecks Romance
By his strictly logical reasoning, and
dominating personality, Hyacinth
nearly wrecks the romances of the
two Bindloss girls and their respective
swains, Basil Mallett and Pietro Rossi.
What the two men do to him as a
result of this meddling, is the story.
Being an English play, it was, of
course, first presented in London, and
there met with tremendous success.
The Passing Show says of it:"It is
something that you laugh at from the
moment the curtain rises until you
are well on your way home again; and
after then whenever you think about
it." H. B. Irving, the talented English
actor, played the leading role in Lon
don.
Parts Well Taken
Davis has selected to support him,
two of the most-experienced campus
actors, Elizabeth Wilbur, who plays
Lady Sarel. and Norris E. James, in
the role of Basil Mallet. Thomas Watt,
playing Count Pietro Rossi, is in his
first quarter at Stanford, but has been
doing considerable professional work
with the Henry Duffy players in San
Francisco, and was with Richard
Bennett in "Creole." Davis pronounces
him to be one of the most promising
juveniles he has had in some time.
The part of Sir Rupert Bindloss, Bt.,
is being played by Palmer Young, who
is taking graduate work at Stanford
this summer. He has not been in a
campus production before, but has had
experience at the Oregon Agricultural
College.
Women in Cast
Catherine Plant, as Joan Bindloss, j
has had several parts in the San Jose
State Teachers College, for which she 1
has received high commendation. This
coming year she will direct dramatics
in Kansas City. Adelaide Mack, play
ing Lallie Bindloss, will be remem-'
bered for a choice bit of work two
summers ago in "Dear Brutus."
Miss Mack has not been at Stanford
since that time.
The management of the New Stan- j
ford Theatre has secured Love's Pep !
Band to provide music between acts. I
