# SANTA CRUZ TERMINUS FOR LAST AUTO TRIP OF SUMMER QUARTER
## Opportunities for Bathing, Boating, and Swimming To Be Had 
### 
Santa Cruz, situated on Carmel Bay,
and having all the attractions of a seaside
resort, will be the terminus of the last of
the Sunday automobile excursions ar
ranged by the director of the Summer
Quarter.
The route to be followed leads for the
first few miles through the orchard sec
tion until Los Gatos is reached. From
here the road commences its tortuous
climb over the Santa Cruz mountains;
and passes through large areas of oaks
and redwoods. At many points picturesque
scenes are presented. An altitude of
about one-half mile is reached at one
point on the road.
The excursion will go along the State
Highway and toward the coast passing
through Saratoga and Los Gatos. The
party will remain six hours at Santa Cruz,
where there will be opportunities for
bathing, boating, and sea-fishing.
The round trip covers 102 miles, at a
cost of $2.50. Automobiles will leave
Stanford Union at 8 o'clock Saturday
morning and return about 4 in the evening.
Those going on the trip are asked to make
reservations two days in advance in the
office of the Director of the Summer
Quarter, Room 173 Administration Build
ing.
