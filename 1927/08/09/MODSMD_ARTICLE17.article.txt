# NOVELS WITH ANCIENT THEMES SUBJECT OF CRAIG TALK TONIGHT
## Erskine to Be Considered as Merely Mirroring Own Age 
### 
"Professor John Erskine has done a
perfectly ordinary and traditional
thing in his rehandling of the ancient
theme of 'Helen of Troy'," says Profes
sor Hardin Craig of the State Univer
sity of lowa in an interview regarding
his lecture on "Contemporary Treat
ment of Ancient Themes" to be given
at S o'clock this evening in the Little
Theatre.
"There are two ways in which an
cient themes may be rehandled in
modern times. One is to treat them
as if they were current. The other is
to treat them according to the prin
ciples of historic criticism, which is
by imaginative restoration of the feel
ings and thoughts of the age which
produced them. It is only in compara
tively recent times that there has been
any attempt to handle these classics
in the latter way," states Professor
Craig.
Erskine makes the story of "Helen
of Troy" a mirror reflecting the life of
contemporary America.
"One cannot say very much for the
picture it gives us of ourselves," says
Professor Craig.
"It is useless to protest against the
desecration which Professor Erskine
has been accused of committing, since
it is inevitable that he and his school
of thinkers should insist on seeing
themselves in this ancient glass," Pro
fessor Craig goes on to explain.
It is the intention of Professor Craig
to illustrate in his lecture the two
ways of treating the story of "Helen
of Troy" by reading from Andrew
Lang and from John Erskine.
Craig, who is acting professor in
English at Stanford this summer, is
also an editor, having edited "Two
Coventry Corpus Christi Plays," "Lit
tle Masterpieces of Poetry" (with Dr.
Henry Van Dyke), "Richard II" (Tu
dor Shakespeare), "Childe Harold's
Pilgrimage and other Poems" by By
ron, and other works.
The lecture is open to the public.
