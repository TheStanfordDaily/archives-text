# LOESSER CAPTURES HEARERS WITH HIS COMMAND OF MUSIC
## 
### 
Tf being a "musican ab intra" means
being able to put personality into
playing, then Arthur Loesser demon
strated at his concert in the Basket
ball Pavilion Friday night that he is
rightfully entitled to this designation
that has been given to him. Loesser,
his hearers felt, was not merely a
technically trained musician of high
attainment, but a man putting himself
into his playing.
His command of appreciation and
of intrepretation ranged, in his pro
gram, over classical and more modern
compositions with equal success.
The audience, which more than half
filled the Pavilion, applauded every
number enthusiastically, but Loesser
responded with only two encores.
