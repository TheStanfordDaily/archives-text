# HORSE SHOW HOLDS SWAY ON CAMPUS FOR REST OF WEEK
## Jumping Events, Spirited Ponies Feature Program OPENING IS SPECTACLE Mounts of Many Kinds Go Through Paces for Crowd 
### 
Students of the summer quarter will
have the opportunity all the rest of
this week to see the horse "back in his
own" —the fancy teams of the boule
vards, the trotters, the pacers—the
mount for the dirt track, leaping hur
dles and handicaps—the farm horse,
sturdy and powerful—the polo pony,
and many others. The annual show
given by the Northern California
Horse Show Association began last
night, to run the rest of the week.
Brilliant lighting and colorful dis
play of horse and rider give the pub
lic a performance reflecting the "good
old fairground days." Jockes in red
and white contrasted with the well
groomed brown, black, grey, and
drab colored horses- —the white hur
dles and fences contrasted with the
dark background of the tanbark fing
—the banners against the dark sky;
the blast of the trumpet, the sound of
the curtain drawn apart, and the beat
ing of hoofs.
Outfits once the height of fashion
drawn by well-trained prancers give
a touch of the romance now gone by.
Light buggies with pacing ponies and
beautiful horses from stables and
ranches all over the West are there
on parade.
Fancy saddles and harnesses also
add a pleasing appearance to the dis
play. Powerful horses from the Ruby
stables, drawing heavy wagons of the
farm, comprise no minor part of the
program.
There will be matinee performances
of the show next Friday and Saturday
afternoons.
Tonight's program includes the Fos
ter and Kleiser $1000 stake for road
sters and the Hartford Livestock In
surance Co. $500 six-in-hand driving
competition. The Foster and Kleiser
stake is open to all horses that show
in the roadster class. They are to be
shown before a fourwheeled vehicle.
Draft horses-are the competitors for
the Hartford stake and they are
judged by driving ability, conforma
tion, and neatness of equipment.
Another feature will be the Shet
land pony event in which King Larigo
"the giggling pony" of F. H. Divan and
Son, of Monroe, Wisconsin, is guaran
teed to furnish plenty of life.
The most important events on
Wednesday's program are the Ben R.
Myer $1000 stake for harness horses
and the Carnation Farm Stables $1000
stake for jumpers. The harness horse
stake is open to stallions, mares, and
geldings over 14.2 hands. They are
judged for conformation, style, all
around action, and ability to go a good
pace. In the stake for jumpers the
winner is judged by the best perform
ance over five jumps; one brush hur
dle, four feet of timber and six inches
of brush on top; post and rail four
feet six one single bar, four feet and
one stone wall.
Two of the most exciting events of
the opening evening were the jumping
events for Novice and Handy Hunters
which were the opening and closing
events of the show. In the first event
Daddy Dear from the stables of Aaron
Frank of Portland won out over
Walter Sporle, Jr.,'s Commando and

the San Francisco Riding School's
Demosthenes. In the later event Who's
What, ridden by Lawrence Lansburgh,
took first place over Spanish Prince,
Dominique, and Demosthenes.
High honors at last night's opening
of the Horse Show were taken by Mrs.
W. P. Roth's Why Worry Farm of
Woodside. Mrs. Roth's entries took
three first places, one second, and two
thirds, amounting to $420 in prize
money. Irving Hellman of Beverly
Hills, whose entry won the Palo Alto

Chamber of Commerce stakes for fine
harness horses, was second with $350,
while Mrs. A. W. Pike, of Redwood
