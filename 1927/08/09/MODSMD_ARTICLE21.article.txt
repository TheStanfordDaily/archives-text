# HORSE SHOW HOLDS SWAY ON CAMPUS FOR REST OF WEEK
## Jumping Events, Spirited Ponies Feature Program OPENING IS SPECTACLE Mounts of Many Kinds Go Through Paces for Crowd 
### 
Students of the summer quarter will
have the opportunity all the rest of
this week to see the horse "back in his
own" —the fancy teams of the boule
vards, the trotters, the pacers—the
mount for the dirt track, leaping hur
dles and handicaps—the farm horse,
sturdy and powerful—the polo pony,
and many others. The annual show
given by the Northern California
Horse Show Association began last
night, to run the rest of the week.
Brilliant lighting and colorful dis
play of horse and rider give the pub
lic a performance reflecting the "good
old fairground days." Jockes in red
and white contrasted with the well
groomed brown, black, grey, and
drab colored horses- —the white hur
dles and fences contrasted with the
dark background of the tanbark fing
—the banners against the dark sky;
the blast of the trumpet, the sound of
the curtain drawn apart, and the beat
ing of hoofs.
Outfits once the height of fashion
drawn by well-trained prancers give
a touch of the romance now gone by.
Light buggies with pacing ponies and
beautiful horses from stables and
ranches all over the West are there
on parade.
