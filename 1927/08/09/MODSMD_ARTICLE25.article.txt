# The 						Assembly
## 
### 
President Wilbur's address tomorrow morning in the Pavilion on the
subject of what happened at the Institute of Pacific Relations conference,
from which he has just returned, will be a report by one who played a
leading role in that conference, and will be the second presentation of
international problems delivered here this quarter. Already we have
listened to a report on conditions in Europe, delivered by Dr. Alonzo
Taylor, a Stanford man and an authority. And now we are to be
privileged to hear of conditions in the Pacific, from another Stanford man.
Dr. Wilbur will be making his first appearance before the students this
quarter. President of the University, he has been absent during the past
few weeks attending the meetings of the Institute, of which he is chairman.
He is to head the body for another two years.
The assembly must be held in the Pavilion, due to the fact that the
Assembly Hall is undergoing repairs. It will be wise, then, to get an
early start for the Pavilion, since it is a brisk walk from some parts of the
Quad.
