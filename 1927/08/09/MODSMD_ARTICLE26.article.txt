# Last of Excursions
## 
### 
Saturday, students will have opportunity to take the last of the auto
mobile excursions which have been arranged. This trip will be to Santa
Cruz, a good example of Northern California beaches.
These excursions were primarily arranged in order to give Summer
Quarter students the chance to take in some of the scenic features of this
part of California. The campus and nearby countryside is filled with
beautiful places for trips.
The response this quarter to these opportunities has been very gratify
ing, It is only to be hoped that students who have not availed themselves
of them will find other means to visit some of these places before'returning
to their homes.
