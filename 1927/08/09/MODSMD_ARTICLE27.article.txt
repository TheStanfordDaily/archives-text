# DR. STRONG'S WORK ON VOCATIONAL TESTS TO BE EXPANDED
## Other Institutions Unite to Develop Stanford Manâ€™s Idea 
### 
Work carried on for a number of years
at Stanford by Dr. E. K. Strong, jr., of
the Graduate School of Business, on de
tecting vocational interest and apt'.tuck;,
was endorsed by the American Council
of Education at its recent conference at
West Point, from which Dr. Strong has
recently returned, and will be expanded
and developed by a number of co-operat
ing institutions.
Dr. Strong served on the committee on
personnel methods at the West Point
meeting. At Stanford he has secured
data for eight vocations, and in the
further development of the work plans to
work out tests for fifteen occupations in
all, covering the principal fields which
college graduates enter.
Developing a Stanford Plan
Another enterprise on which Dr.
Strong's sub-committee is studying is a
measurement of personality. I his com
mittee is going to develop a rating scale
to be used in high schools and colleges,
to be tried out in a number of institutions
under the most favorable auspices. Its
purpose is to sec if it is possible to get
measures of a student's personality aside
from scholastic grades.
The results of this investigation will
be of particular interest at Stanford,
since it is in line with the present prac
tice of the University in selecting stu
dents for admission. Four of Stanford's
ten requirements are based on person
ality.
The American Council of Education
has received $20,000 a year for three
years to carry on research- This money
will be expended on furthering the work
of the committee on personnel methods.
The sub-committee on the measurement
of personality is one of four sub-com
mittees.
Will Attend Minnesota Meeting
Dr. Strong plans to drive to Minnesota
the latter par of this month for a second
meeing of his committee.
While Dr. Strong was in the East he
attended a Y.M.C.A. conference in Chi
cago.
Dr. Strong visited many educational
institutions and business organizations to
discuss personnel problems. He finds that
there is a demand in business today for
men trained to conduct personnel work
and to handle psychological problems.
This demand is constantly increasing and
relatively few men are available, he said.
