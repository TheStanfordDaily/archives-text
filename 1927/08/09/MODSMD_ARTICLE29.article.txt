## Large Audience Witnesses Productions Directed By Miss Wilson 
### 
Three one act plays were given before
a capacity audience at the Little Theatre
last night by a group of Stanford stu
dents under the direction of Miss Doro
thea Wilson, a student of the University.
All three were written by Elene Wilbur.
"The Marriage Cake" showed just how
easily a man may be influenced by a
woman's, even a wife's, flattery. Henry
Wels, Eugene de Hermida, was a very
busy man . . . collecting the wages of his
wife, Hat Wells, Marcella Kartheiser,
who took in washing in order to support
her shiftless husband and herself. A
neighbor, Mrs. Blaney, Margaret Lee,
entered with a recipe for a marriage cake.
The one and only ingredient was flattery.
Hat, ironing expressively, put the formula
into practice upon the return of her
husband. It worked, and, under the effect
of more profuse compliments, he went in
quest of a mangling job in a nearby laun
dry. leaving Hat in the ccstacy of success.
"Four Women", a dramatic saga of
Persia long before the birth of Christ,
was a play with a complicated plot. The
outstanding feature of this act was the
difficult nature of the lines. The play was
heavy and emotional, but showed little
action, and failed to impress.
"The Wares Never Did So", but Doreen
Ware. Helen Cooper, did not know about
it. She thought that she was in love
with handsome Julian Montgomery,
Powell Carpenter, and was going to elope
with him to South America, but her mind
was changed by Peter Rand, Raymond
Haizlip. Peter was incited by Doreen's
aunt, Lucy Ware, Esther Brown, and his
own love for the girl to reveal the family
secret to her . . , the story of a Ware's
elopement which ended tragically in the
days of long ago.
