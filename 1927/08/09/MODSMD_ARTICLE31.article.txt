# STANFORD HAS MORE THAN TWENTY OLYMPIC PROSPECTS
## 
### 
Stanford will be well represented at
the 1928 Olympic Games in Holland,
according to all present indications.
More than twenty Cardinal athletes
seem to have better than a good
chance to qualify for this meet. In
addition, if advance reports hold good,
three coaches from here will also be
present at the Games.
Ernst Brandsten, who was coach of
the diving team at the last Olympics
is a most likely man for that post next
year as well. Although noÂ«selections
have as yet been announced, Brand
sten, more than any other man seems
qualified for the position. In addition,
he may coach the water-polo team as
well.
Coach "Dink" Templeton, another
Stanford man, appears a likely coach
for the field men on this trip. His
excellent record, especially of this
last season, when he won the 1.C.4-A.
title, and the Pacific Coast title with
his team, justify his selection.
May Have Rugby Team
If the United States decides to send
a rugby team to the Games, Harry
Maloney will doubtless be offered the
position as coach. His long experience
and knowledge of the game make him
the most logical coach in the country
for this assignment. He served in this
capacity at the last Olympics. More
over, if a rugby team is sent from this
country, probably better than half of
the athletes on it will be Cardinal men,
since Stanford was the last of the
major universities to abandon the Eng
lish game, and the last team selected
was picked largely from here and
from the University of California.
Cardinal Best in Track
Fifteen Stanford track and field per
formers, past and present, are logical
contenders to represent the United
States. At least, this is so on the face
of the records they have run up.
Leading the list, in numbers at least,

are the weight men. "Tiny" Hart
ranft, who represented the United
States at the last Olympic Games,
"Bit'f" Hoffman, 1.C.4-A. discus cham
pion, and Eric Krenz, national discus
champion, all appear to be sure of
places. In addition, A1 Forster should
have an excellent chance, together
with Herbert Fleishhacker, another
possible contender.
Hugo Leistner, Ross Nichols, and
Clarence West should show well in I
the hurdles. Leistner especially should
win <* place, it is said.
In the broad-jump, Stanford has' a
great trio of performers. Sid Meeks,
Kim Dyer, and Fred Zombro are all
capable of better than twenty-four feet,
and are consistent. This is a hard
event to pick, due to the number of
stars.
Bob King, national high jump cham
pion, appears a likely candidate for a
place. If King keeps up his pace he
stands a chance of breaking the world
record for this event.
Another sure winner is Vend&le
Harlow in the javelin. Harlow won
the national championship at Lincoln.
Ward Edmonds, whose improvement
in the polevault has been remarkable,
seems justified of a position.
Bill Richardson, former national
half-mile champion, who went to
the last Games, may earn a place if
he returns to form. Richardson has
not been 'in competition during the
past season. Emerson Spencer, holder
of the Coast 440-yard record, should
receive consideration as well.
Swimmers Also Prominent
In swimming, Stanford should be
well represented. Clarita Hunsberger,
A1 White, and Dave Fall all attended
the last Games, as did Wallace
O'Connor. In addition to these stars,
Reg Harrison and Carl Stevenson may
also win places on the American team.* i
