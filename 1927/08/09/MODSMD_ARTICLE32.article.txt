# CHARLIER TO DELIVER LECTURE IN FRENCH ON BELGIAN WRITERS
## Will Discuss Maeterlinck, Verhaeren, and Others 
### 
"Young Belgium" and the Belgian lit
erary renaissance of the last fifty years,
will be discussed in a lecture in French on
Wednesdey afternoon at 4:15 in the
Little Theatre. The speaker will be Dr.
Gustave Charlier of Brussels, visiting
profesor in the Stanford Department of
Romanic Languages.
According to Dr. Charlier, the national
literature of Belgium has been slow of
development for two reasons. The history
of the country: the intermittent invasions
and periods of alien rule—Spanish,
Austrian, French—has not favored cre
ative accomplishment. Then, like the
United States and the Latin American
countries, Belgium has a language in
common with another nation whose liter
ary tradition is established and distinctive.
Belgian writers in French have been
impeded with French litcrary'associations
and French literary prestige.
Belgium won its independence in 1830.
The renaissance of Belgian letters, known
among its leaders as the "Young Belgium
Movement", was achieved in the latter
half of the nineteenth century. It pro
duced a literature that is not only national
in charactcr but also worthy of inter
national interest.
Dr. Charlier will discuss Lemoonniere,
the poets, Albert Giraud, Iwan Gilkin,
and Valere Gille, and Charles Van Ler
berghe, the prose writers inspired by
"symbolic aestheticism", Georges Eckhout,
Maurice Maeterlinck, and Emille Verhaer
en the founder of a contemporary school
of poets.
Dr. Charlier will make a survey of con
temporary literature, that will include
poetry representative of four schools, the
short story, and the drama.
