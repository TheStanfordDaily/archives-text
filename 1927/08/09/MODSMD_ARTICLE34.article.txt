# STADIUM ARCHES ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE THEIR FORM
## Pile Driver Expected to End Its Part of Work By Tonight 
### 
Arches which will give the enlarged
stadium its characteristicfeature are begin
ing to take form. The wooden frame
work of a number are already in place,
and carpenters are erecting them as rapidly
as the supports for the additional fourteen
rows of seats are erected. This wurk is
progressing at the rate of twenty or
thirty feet a day aronnd the rim.
The arches are ararnged in groups of
entrances to the stadium at the tops of
the stairs. Between each group of five
arches there will be an interval of plain
wall.
Uprights are being put into place around
the arches to give the basis for the ex
panded steel reinforcement upon which
the exterior coat of gunile will be spread,
giving the whole the appearance of a
solid structure crowning a low hil.
; Preparations are being made also for
the construction of the deck pan, or cor
rugated iron roof just under the new
seats, that will form a rain trougli for the
protection of the passage way under the
arcade around the rim of the stadium.
The pile driver will probably finish the
last of its work by 5 o'clock today. The
laborers laying the foundation beams are
close on the heels of the pile driver and
this part of the work will soon be com
pleted and ready for the rest of the
framework.
