# SHAKESPEARE STUDY ADVANCED BY NEW METHOD, SAYS CRAIG
## Iowa Professor Sees Much Significance in System 
### 
Progress on an edition of Shakes
peare by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch and
J. Dover Wilson by the use of a new
bibliographical method is the most
significant thing in the field of Shakes
peare today, according to Hardin F.
Craig, visiting professor of English
from the University of lowe, when
interviewed on the subject.
Defines Method of Study
When asked to give a lay meaning
to the term bibliographical method,
he defined it as a study based on a
critical examination of the original
texts of the plays. "This," he added,
"has been made possible only because
of the last century's great discovery
of the chronological order in which
Shakespeare's plays were written."
This edition is being published in
the order of the first folio beginning
with "The Tempest." The ninth play,
"As You Like It," is just off the press.
Elaborate Stage Directions
These texts have elaborate stage
directions such as we see in our
modern plays.
"I think they have gone entirely too
far in this matter," said Professor
Craig. "In fact, I disagree with them
as to some of the actual facts which
they state in their stage directions."
"I think the new Shakespeare of
Quiller-Cough and Dover Wilson is
of greatest importance in the matter
of text.
Giving a Better Version
"The editors are perhaps over specu
lative, but they are giving us a better
version of the plays. The methods of
attack which they use will also yield
results when applied to the early
printed works of other poets and
dramatists.
"Of course, the whole field is still a
subject of controversy. Sir Edward
Chambers, one of the greatest living
authorities on Elizabethan drama, is
disposed to doubt the conclusions of
members of this new school, such as
A. W. Pollard who claims that some
of the quartos which have been con
sidered inferior are really a step
nearer to Shakespeare's manuscript
than is the first folio editions and that
they may have come from the prompt
copy of the actors. Chambers like
wise discounts Percy Simpson of Cam
bridge University who claims that
the apparent haphazard punctuation
of the early quartos was really Shakes
peare's system of directing the acting:
a comma meant a slight pause, a
semicolon, a longer pause, and a
period, a full stop, and that hence
come some of those puzzling periods
that occur in the middle of a sen
tence."

These texts have elaborate stage
directions such as we see in our
modern plays.
"I think they have gone entirely too
far in this matter," said Professor
Craig. "In fact, I disagree with them
as to some of the actual facts which
they state in their stage directions."
"I think the new Shakespeare of
Quiller-Cough and Dover Wilson is
of greatest importance in the matter
of text.
Giving a Better Version
"The editors are perhaps over specu
lative, but they are giving us a better
version of the plays. The methods of
attack which they use will also yield
results when applied to the early
printed works of other poets and
dramatists.
"Of course, the whole field is still a
subject of controversy. Sir Edward
Chambers, one of the greatest living
authorities on Elizabethan drama, is
disposed to doubt the conclusions of
members of this new school, such as
A. W. Pollard who claims that some
of the quartos which have been con
sidered inferior are really a step
nearer to Shakespeare's manuscript
than is the first folio editions and that
they may have come from the prompt
copy of the actors. Chambers like
wise discounts Percy Simpson of Cam
bridge University who claims that
the apparent haphazard punctuation
of the early quartos was really Shakes
peare's system of directing the acting:
a comma meant a slight pause, a
semicolon, a longer pause, and a
period, a full stop, and that hence
come some of those puzzling periods
that occur in the middle of a sen
tence."
Progress on an edition of Shakes
peare by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch and
J. Dover Wilson by the use of a new
bibliographical method is the most
significant thing in the field of Shakes
peare today, according to Hardin F.
Craig, visiting professor of English
from the University of lowe, when
interviewed on the subject.
Defines Method of Study
When asked to give a lay meaning
to the term bibliographical method,
he defined it as a study based on a
critical examination of the original
texts of the plays. "This," he added,
"has been made possible only because
of the last century's great discovery
of the chronological order in which
Shakespeare's plays were written."
This edition is being published in
the order of the first folio beginning
with "The Tempest." The ninth play,
"As You Like It," is just off the press.
