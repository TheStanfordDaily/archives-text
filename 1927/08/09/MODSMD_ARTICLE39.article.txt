# Buehler Calls Politics Major Sport In Austria
## 
### 
"While your students here appear to
have a great interest in athletics,"
said Dr. Karl Buehler, acting professor
of psychology from Vienna, "Our stu
dents in Austria are too much interest
ed in politics."
Although Austrian students have
football, tennis, and Swedish gym-

nasties, as well as skiing, Dr. Buehler
finds one of the outstanding differences
between American students and those
found in the universities of Vienna
to lie in the devotion of Austrian stu
dents to politics whereas young Amer-

icans consider sports their first extra
curricular activity.
"Skiing is to Vienna what motoring
is to an American university." Dr.
Buehler ventured when he was asked
about the prevalence of motoring in ;
his country. Because of the cold |
weather and the proximity of the j
mountains, the college population
quite often spends its week-ends on
skiing parties.
Live in Private Homes
"Fraternities exist at the univer-:
sities in Vienna, and there are one or
two dormitories, but most of the stu
dents live in private families, because
the fraternities have clubhouses with
out dormitory facilities," Dr. Buehler
said. "You ask what courses are
studied by the greatest number of
students at the University of Vienna.
We have four universities in Vienna.
There is the university in which train
ing is given the professions: law,
medicine, teaching; the technical uni
versity for engineering; the univer
sity for business; and the university
for agriculture. I cannot say which is
the most popular."
One of the conditions in American
universities that strikes an Austrian as
interesting is the combination of out
side work for self-support and regular
study carried on simultaneously. In
Vienna,, Dr. Buehler says, students
work in mines and on farms during
the vacation periods, but during the
time when college is in session, they
do no work other than, in a few
instances, that of teaching assistants
or tutors.

"Here I find men whom I have seen ;
in my classes waiting on table when I
I have my lunch," added Dr. Buehler, j
"And I think it is very good training, J
and in keeping with your strenuous j
American life." The intensity dis-j
played by the people of America dur-!
ing both their hours of labor and their I
leisure has been noted by Dr. Buehler. j
When they relax, the relaxation is!
strained and when they work, they I
concentrate on the work in hand to
the exclusion of all else.

ing is given the professions: law,
medicine, teaching; the technical uni
versity for engineering; the univer
sity for business; and the university
for agriculture. I cannot say which is
the most popular."
One of the conditions in American
universities that strikes an Austrian as
interesting is the combination of out
side work for self-support and regular
study carried on simultaneously. In
Vienna,, Dr. Buehler says, students
work in mines and on farms during
the vacation periods, but during the
time when college is in session, they
do no work other than, in a few
instances, that of teaching assistants
or tutors.

Approves of Self-Support
"Here I find men whom I have seen ;
in my classes waiting on table when I
I have my lunch," added Dr. Buehler, j
"And I think it is very good training, J
and in keeping with your strenuous j
American life." The intensity dis-j
played by the people of America dur-!
ing both their hours of labor and their I
leisure has been noted by Dr. Buehler. j
When they relax, the relaxation is!
strained and when they work, they I
concentrate on the work in hand to
the exclusion of all else.

"While your students here appear to
have a great interest in athletics,"
said Dr. Karl Buehler, acting professor
of psychology from Vienna, "Our stu
dents in Austria are too much interest
ed in politics."
Although Austrian students have
football, tennis, and Swedish gym-

nasties, as well as skiing, Dr. Buehler
finds one of the outstanding differences
between American students and those
found in the universities of Vienna
to lie in the devotion of Austrian stu
dents to politics whereas young Amer-

icans consider sports their first extra
curricular activity.
"Skiing is to Vienna what motoring
is to an American university." Dr.
Buehler ventured when he was asked
about the prevalence of motoring in ;
his country. Because of the cold |
weather and the proximity of the j
mountains, the college population
quite often spends its week-ends on
skiing parties.
Live in Private Homes
"Fraternities exist at the univer-:
sities in Vienna, and there are one or
two dormitories, but most of the stu
dents live in private families, because
the fraternities have clubhouses with
out dormitory facilities," Dr. Buehler
said. "You ask what courses are
studied by the greatest number of
students at the University of Vienna.
We have four universities in Vienna.
There is the university in which train
ing is given the professions: law,
medicine, teaching; the technical uni
versity for engineering; the univer
sity for business; and the university
for agriculture. I cannot say which is
the most popular."
