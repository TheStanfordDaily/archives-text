# LAST PRODUCTION OF QUARTER PROMISES FAST-MOVING COMEDY
## 
### 
"The Angel in the House," last play
of the Summer Quarter, promises to be
a fast-moving and interesting comedy,
of both situation and manners. In this
respect it will be somewhat of a relief
from the heavier and more melodra
matic offerings which marked the
other two presentations of the sum
mer.
The play itseir is concerned with the
fall from bachelorhood of a middle
aged English gentleman, Hyacinth,
played by Gordon Davis. Hyacinth is
an extremely fastidious, somewhat ef
feminate, but determined Englishman
of about forty. Cast on a desert island
with Lady Sarel, by the pranks of a
group of young people, he soon be
comes enamoured with the lady, and
falls from his single state. A petticoat
figures prominently in the action.
As previously announced, the play
will be produced in the New Stanford
Theatre on account of the improve
ments now being made in the Assem
bly Hall. From the seat sale yester
day, indications are that a capacity
house will be on hand Friday night.
Rehearsals show the play to be the
farthest along previous to the evening
of actual presentation of any of the
plays this quarter. The action of the
play is sparkling, and with an experi
enced cast, such as Davis has assem
bled, it should not drag at any time.
