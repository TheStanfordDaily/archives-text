# PROFESSOR POWELL EXPRESSES VIEWS ON SACCO-VANZETTI TRIAL
## 
### 
"Without having any certainty as
to the guilt or innocence of Sacco and
Vanzetti, I do not think this trial was
conducted in such fashion as to prove
that they were guilty," said Richard
R. B. Powell, acting professor of law
at Stanford during the Summer
Quarter, and regularly member of the
faculty of the Columbia University
Law School.
Although Professor Powell did not
feel able to state whether Sacco and
Vanzetti were guilty, he wished to
make apparent that it was his opinion
that the trial which should have deter
mined this question, actually did not
legally do so.
"Procedure in Massachusetts per
mits the Appelate Court to reverse the
decision on motion for new trial only
when they find an abuse of discretion
by the trial judge who denied the
right to a new trial.
"Hence, the highest court of Massa
chusetts has not given its judgement
as to the importance of the new testi
mony but has merely held that Judge
Thayer did not commit an abuse of
discretion in holding no new trial
should occur.
"The new evidence, if true, would
have proved that neither of these men
had anything to do with the crime for
which they were indicted," he con
tinued.
