Miss Ruth Lansburgh, a Stanford

the Northern California Horse Show,
one in the Palo Alto Chamber of Com
merce stakes, and the other in the
event for novice three-gaited saddle
horses. Miss Lansburgh is taking an
active part in the programs for the
next three nights. One of the features
of Thursday's program is the $1000
