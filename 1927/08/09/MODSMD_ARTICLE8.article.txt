# BLEDSOE DEFEATS CASTELLANOS FOR NET CHAMPIONSHIP
## Winner Covers Court at All Angles, Places Shots Accurately BOTH MEN PLAY WELL Gains Title in Straight Sets 6-4, 7-5, Played Yesterday 
### 
Leigliton Bledsoe defeated Joseph
Castellanos for the summer intramu
ral tennis tournament championship
yesterday afternoon by a score of 6-4,
7-5. Both men played brilliant tennis,
and Bledsoe's ability to cover the
court at all angles was the feature of
the match. Castellanos gave many
points to Bledsoe by driving over the
base line and into the net. Bledsoe
was sure of his game and, although he
didn't play a hard, driving match, his
placement shots won him many points.
Castellanos rated seventh on the
varsity tennis squad last year and
Bledsoe attained this ranking the year
before. Bledsoe was a graduate stu
dent last year and consequently could
not play on the varsity last season.
Bledsoe will receive as prize a
tennis racquet given by Ellery Arms,
San Francisco, for winning the tourna
ment.
