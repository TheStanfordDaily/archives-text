# SATURN DISCARDS PURPLE GLOW WHEN OBSERVED SATURDAY
## 
### 
Saturn dispensed with his usual purple
glow when the Stanford visitors to Lick
Observatory gazed at him through the
telescope last Saturday evening. Other
wise the events announced for the week
end trip were run off according to sched
ule and everybody was satisfied. There
were three carloads of Stanford visitors
who took turns gazing at Saturn and his
satellites, but this had nothing to do with
his appearing in an unemotional white
light. That would have necessitated too
much prearrangement, since astronomers
figure that it takes a great many years
for the light of Saturn, whatever its
tinge, to reach human eyes on earth.
Besides, Saturn is of a particularly cold
nature.
One of the Stanford party asked if
Saturn was inhabited, and was assured
that almost certainly it was not, since it
has recently been determined that the
temperature on the planet is minus 200.
The visibility of both the moon and
Saturn was clear, affording good obsr
vation of both bodies.
The moon was observed through the
large telescope. The objects of interest
on the moon this time were the craters,
which were clearly shown. The smaller
instrument was used to show Saturn.
The so-called "moons", or satellites of
Saturn were seen. There are three, and
they may not be seen by the naked eye.
A good view was had of the circles
surrounding Saturn, even though they
appeared white instead of purple.
Other interesting features of the trip
were the photographs and particles of
fallen bodies that were in evidence around
the observatory. The photographs were
of nebulae, and of some of the principal
heavenly bodies.
