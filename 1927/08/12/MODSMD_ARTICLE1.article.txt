## "Angel in the House" Will Be Given in Palo Alto SEAT SALES TOTAL 1100 Last Production Is Modern English Comedy of Manners 
### 
Before the largest audience to wit
ness a Summer Quarter play, "The An
gel in the House," a three-act comedy
will be presented this evening at the

the final production of the summer
dramatic season.
More than 1104) seats have already
been sold for the comedy of English
manners by Eden Phillpotts and Basil
Hastings. The curtain is announced for

Variety of Comedy Types
In the cast there are eleven campus
players who offer a variety of comedy
types —an eccentric, middle-aged Eng
lishman, an aristocrat and his two
daughters, their mid-victorian aunt, an
Italian aviator, and a British athletic
«champion.
"The Angel in the House" marks
the completion of Gordon Davis'
twelfth year on the Stanford stage as
an actor. He had been on the faculty
directing since 1920. Making his first
appearance in the 191a sophomore play,
"Bobby Burnitt," Davis has achieved
a number of distinct characterizations
remembered by campus theatregoers,
including those in such productions as
"Justice," "The Yellow Jacket," "Hell
Bent Fer Heaven." "The Dover Road,"
and "Aren't We All?" To these he will
add that of the ludicrous angel, the
Hon. Hyacinth Petavel.
Convention Goes by the Boards
Davis has an excellent comedy foil
in tonight's production in Miss Eliza
beth Wilbur as Lady Susan Sarel. Con
ventional proprieties of English life
are dispensed with by Hyacinth and
"Lady Sarel when, through the ma
chinations of the Italian aviator and
the English discus champion, they find
themselves marooned for the night on
an island. Hyacinth's susceptibilities
jto cold weather —a condition which he j
; terms the "snow sleep"—are finally
offset by a flannel petticoat belonging
to Lady Sarel.
i Palmer Young, a newcomer In LUii
,versity dramatics, is cast as Sir Rupert
Bindloss, an honorary colonel of two
territorial battalions, who adopts
Hyacinth.
Brilliant Younger Set
The four young people of the play,
Lallie and Joan Bindloss, and Basil
| Mallet and Count Pietro Rossi, are the |
j subject of much anxiety by the Hon.
Petavel. Lallie, played by Miss Ade
laide Mack, is in love with Pietro. Tom
' Watt, and Joan is engaged to Basil,
Norris James. Hyacinth, an ardent fol
lower of eugenics, attempts to inter-:
I change the relations of the couples
with dire results to himself.
Three weeks of intensive rehearsals
have prepared "The Angel in the
House" for tonight's production in |
■ Palo Alto.
Cubistic paintings, by James West, j
|of Palo Alto, and impressionistic |
statuary by Miss Lucy Bentley, of 1
Stanford, add much to the second act i
I
! setting. They required many days of
j research in prevalent artistic trends
before they could be executed for the
play. /

Davis, who will direct a six weeks
stock engagement for Jessie Bonstelle in
Detroit, leaves for New York tomorrow
morning at 10 o'clock, where he will
help cast and get two companies ready
for Bonstelle, then go to Detroit for the
six weeks work, and immediately after
wards will go to Europe.
Before the largest audience to wit
ness a Summer Quarter play, "The An
gel in the House," a three-act comedy
will be presented this evening at the
New Stanford Theatre, Palo Alto, as
the final production of the summer
dramatic season.
More than 1104) seats have already
been sold for the comedy of English
manners by Eden Phillpotts and Basil
Hastings. The curtain is announced for
3:15.
Variety of Comedy Types
In the cast there are eleven campus
players who offer a variety of comedy
types —an eccentric, middle-aged Eng
lishman, an aristocrat and his two
daughters, their mid-victorian aunt, an
Italian aviator, and a British athletic
«champion.
"The Angel in the House" marks
the completion of Gordon Davis'
twelfth year on the Stanford stage as
an actor. He had been on the faculty
directing since 1920. Making his first
appearance in the 191a sophomore play,
"Bobby Burnitt," Davis has achieved
a number of distinct characterizations
remembered by campus theatregoers,
including those in such productions as
"Justice," "The Yellow Jacket," "Hell
Bent Fer Heaven." "The Dover Road,"
and "Aren't We All?" To these he will
add that of the ludicrous angel, the
Hon. Hyacinth Petavel.
Convention Goes by the Boards
Davis has an excellent comedy foil
in tonight's production in Miss Eliza
beth Wilbur as Lady Susan Sarel. Con
ventional proprieties of English life
are dispensed with by Hyacinth and
"Lady Sarel when, through the ma
chinations of the Italian aviator and
the English discus champion, they find
themselves marooned for the night on
an island. Hyacinth's susceptibilities
jto cold weather —a condition which he j
; terms the "snow sleep"—are finally
offset by a flannel petticoat belonging
to Lady Sarel.
