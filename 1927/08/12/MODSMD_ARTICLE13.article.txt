Some of the country's best divers and
swimmers have just finished preparing
themselves at Encina pool and at Sears
ville Lake for the Hawaiian Swimming
Meet to be held in Honolulu August 23-
28. They are leaving this week for Hono
lulu.
Dave Fall, '27, who is competing for
the Athens Athletic Club of Oakland,
'eft Wednesday! Pete Desjarditis of Mi
ami, Florida, who has been here for the
last week finishing his training at Sears
ville Lake and in the Encina pool, left
| Thursday night for Los Angeles, and
there will sail to Honolulu.
Desjardins won both the high and
fancy diving in 1925 at Seattle and in
petition between him and Fall was very
c'osc, Desjardins nosing Fall out by one
point.
Ernst Brandsten, Stanford swimming
coach, says:
"In high spring board diving Desjar
dins is undoubtedly the best, but in high
fancy diving it will l)e close between the
two."
Carl Stevenson, '27. is leaving tomor
row to represent the Olympic Club in
the mile and half mile events.
"Stevenson will be doing well if lie
placcs third because Japan is sending
five of her best swimmers," Brandsten
remarked.
The coach is now making arrangements
so that he will have the swimmers at
Encina pool or at Searsvil'e Lake for an
exhibition meet if they return from Ha
waii by way of San Francisco. It will
probably be held at Searsville as the re
turn date is about September 6, and the
University will be closed at that time.
