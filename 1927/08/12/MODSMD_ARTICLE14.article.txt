# Horse Show Recalls Old Days to Watchman
## 
### 
"This horse show makes the campus
look like the old days when Senator
was alive," said Charles
Wooster, popularly known to Stanford
men as "Dad." Over fifty years ago,
"Dad" was first employed by the Stan
fords in the capacity of coachman.
After Mrs. Stanford's aeath, he be
came night watchman of Encina Hall.
He was retired two years ago on a pen
sion.
"Dad" is still an oft-seen figure on
the campus, especially now during the
horse show. It calls him back to the
days when Senator Stanford was pro
ducing his world-famous trotting
horses.
