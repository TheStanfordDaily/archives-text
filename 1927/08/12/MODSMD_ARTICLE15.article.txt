# WILBUR DELIVERS WELCOME ADDRESS TO CHINESE STUDENTS
## Urges Each to Do Share in Improving Their Country 
### 
"I have confidence that the educated
young peop'e of China will set an ex- :
ample to the world," said President Wil-!
bur in his address of welcome to the j
Chinese Student Conference in Branner j
Hall Wednesday evening. The president'
discussed the Institute of Pacific Rela- 1
tions of which he is chairman and de
scribed the situation of China as it was !
taken up at the second biennial meeting
held in Honolulu a few weeks ago.
Wilbur went on to show that the difli- i
culty of the present day is that only |
about ten per cent of the Chinese do the '
planning and thinking and consequently j
have to make up in the best way possible ;
for the other ninety per cent that does j
not. The general sentiment of the insti- |
tute regarding the situation in Shanghai
was one of great sympathy for China and
a desire was expressed to help China and
transfer responsibility and sovereignty j
into Chinese hands.
It is on'y within recent years that;
China has discarded her ancient customs |
and has taken new ideas and inventions j
into the country, and one cannot expect!
a great change in the place overnight, j
A long period of time is required to j
have perfection completed.
The president ended his speech by j
saying he had great faith in the Chinese j
students of today and had hopes that j
they would each do their part in placing j
China where it should be.
The following universities are repre-1
sented at the conference: University of i
California, Pomona College, College of ,
the Pacific, Nevada, Occidental, Univer- j
sity of Southern California, Washing- j
ton. and Stanford.
Discussions, athletics, and musical en- J
tertainments are taking up the greater
part of the time. The conference will j
terminate Saturday.
