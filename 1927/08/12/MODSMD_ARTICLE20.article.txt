which he has writen several books. Meikle
john is of Scotch descent. He was born
in Providence, R. 1., and went through
Brown University. Later, Meiklejohn was

"The Experimental College".
This summer Meiklejohn has been at
the sumer school of the University of
California.
While talking recently to Professor
Carl R. Fish, also of Wisconsin, who is
on the Summer Quarter faculty, Meikle
john remarked that his name was very
frequently mispronounced. The following
is correct, according to Fish. The "ei"
of the name is pronounced as the"i" in
"it", not as the"i" in "Michael".
