# "The Play's The Thing"
## 
### 
Tonight's production of "The Angel in the House" will mark the
last appearance of Gordon Davis on the Stanford stage as director or
actor for a year. Directly after the play, he will leave for the East, and
thence for Europe.
During his year's absence, Miss Anna May Price will direct Stan
ford dramatics. She will inherit a hard task on account of the high
plane to which Stanford dramatics has been brought by Davis during
the years in which he has been building up and maintaining the tradition
of thoroughness and finish, but that task is not beyond her powers.
Miss Price as a student at Stanford last summer demonstrated her
ability as an actress, and at the San Mateo Junior College she has proved
in marked fashion her capability as a director. To Davis, good luck and
a fortunate return ; to Miss Price, welcome and our support.
