The suggestion that Bookstore patrons deposit their coupons in the
Women's Clubhouse box if they are not saving them for their personal
use, is excellent. Stanford women have justification for pride in their
success in building and financing the clubhouse, and they have earned
the gratitude of the student body for the generous way in which they
have made the clubhouse available for campus afifairs. The Bookstore
coupons are worth money, but many purchasers do not bother to use
them. Giving the Women's Club the chance to add together a consider
able number of small sums will yield them a total that will be a material
aid in continuing the public usefulness of the Clubhouse.
