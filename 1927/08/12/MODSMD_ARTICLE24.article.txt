# CRAIG SAYS MODERN SETTINGS ROB OLD STORIES OF BEAUTY
## Erskine Says Helen of Troy Flippant and Menelaus Half Babbitt 
### 
"Helen of Troy" has been depicted
for the wonder of man through all ages.
Homer interpreted her in the simple
beauty of his times, Marlow in the ro
manticism of his period, and Shake
speare borrowed her for the Tudor
setting of Troilius and Cressida. Ers
kine has clothed her in the conven
tionalities of present times.
"The American school of sex fic
tion has expressed itselr through Ers
kine's book," stated Dr. Craig. "Frank
ness is preferred to propriety, denial
of any kind of desire is sin. His all
inclusive epithet is 'convention.' Ers
kine and his school have made this j
theme a mirror for themselves."
Helen runs away with her lover,'
then is taken back by her husband. In I
present-day terminology she has trans- j
gressed a moral law. Erskine makes j
her flip when she tells Menelaus that j
if he feels he must kill her his sword i
is in the dining-room where he last j
left it. Transferring the story without!
its setting has made Menelaus appear!
the weakling and coward. According!
to Homer, Menelaus was afraid of no j
one, but Erskine makes him a "wife's
apron-string" man.
In Helen's time the gods were re
sponsible for man's actions. Helen !
might be ashamed, but Aphrodite was |
to blame. Helen was beautiful and all-1
compelling, and the unafraid Menelaus
was willing to have eternal beauty as
his spouse. There was no weakness in
that willingness.
To illustrate the above point, Dr.j
Craig read from Swinburne. Menelaus
has called Helen to account for the
war she has caused. She stands before
the army for the men to condemn her.
They forget their desire for revenge
when they gaze on the beauty of her
face and not one of them will accuse
her. Menelaus is not overcome by her
beauty and strides toward her, sword
in hand. Aphrodite parts the clouds
and envelops them both in united
love.
Dr. Craig drew a parable of this
theme in the following story: "Mene
laus went hunting for Helen with a 1
sword. She met him, told her side of '
the case, and said for him to kill her
if he must. Menelaus' sword embar- j
rassed him. Helen said: 'Well, let's be
going home'."
"The hand of Menelaus but the j
voice of Babbitt," said I'rofessor Craig.
It would read as equally crass to put I
the story of Ruth and Boaz in the'
modern moral setting. Ruth and Naomi !
would be found comparing "lines" to '
try on Boaz in order to get him.
Rob these ancient themes of their |
own rich setting and they lose their!
freshness, vigor, and charm.

gressed a moral law. Erskine makes j
her flip when she tells Menelaus that j
if he feels he must kill her his sword i
is in the dining-room where he last j
left it. Transferring the story without!
its setting has made Menelaus appear!
the weakling and coward. According!
to Homer, Menelaus was afraid of no j
one, but Erskine makes him a "wife's
apron-string" man.
In Helen's time the gods were re
sponsible for man's actions. Helen !
might be ashamed, but Aphrodite was |
to blame. Helen was beautiful and all-1
compelling, and the unafraid Menelaus
was willing to have eternal beauty as
his spouse. There was no weakness in
that willingness.
To illustrate the above point, Dr.j
Craig read from Swinburne. Menelaus
has called Helen to account for the
war she has caused. She stands before
the army for the men to condemn her.
They forget their desire for revenge
when they gaze on the beauty of her
face and not one of them will accuse
her. Menelaus is not overcome by her
beauty and strides toward her, sword
in hand. Aphrodite parts the clouds
and envelops them both in united
love.
Dr. Craig drew a parable of this
theme in the following story: "Mene
laus went hunting for Helen with a 1
sword. She met him, told her side of '
the case, and said for him to kill her
if he must. Menelaus' sword embar- j
rassed him. Helen said: 'Well, let's be
going home'."
"The hand of Menelaus but the j
voice of Babbitt," said I'rofessor Craig.
It would read as equally crass to put I
the story of Ruth and Boaz in the'
modern moral setting. Ruth and Naomi !
would be found comparing "lines" to '
try on Boaz in order to get him.
Rob these ancient themes of their |
own rich setting and they lose their!
freshness, vigor, and charm.
"Helen of Troy" has been depicted
for the wonder of man through all ages.
Homer interpreted her in the simple
beauty of his times, Marlow in the ro
manticism of his period, and Shake
speare borrowed her for the Tudor
setting of Troilius and Cressida. Ers
kine has clothed her in the conven
tionalities of present times.
"The American school of sex fic
tion has expressed itselr through Ers
kine's book," stated Dr. Craig. "Frank
ness is preferred to propriety, denial
of any kind of desire is sin. His all
inclusive epithet is 'convention.' Ers
kine and his school have made this j
theme a mirror for themselves."
Helen runs away with her lover,'
then is taken back by her husband. In I
present-day terminology she has trans- j
