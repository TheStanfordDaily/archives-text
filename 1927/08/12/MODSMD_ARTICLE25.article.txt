# INSTITUTE PLANS FOR EXTENDED RESEARCH WORK, SAYS ALSBERG
## Wilbur Given Praise as Presiding Officer Of Meet 
### 
"The general opinion at the Insti- |
tute was that President Wilbur was a
very remarkable presiding officer,":
said Dr. Carl L. Alsberg, Director and
Executive Secretary of the Food Re
search Institute, when interviewed
this week.
President Wilbur, Dr. Alsberg, and j
Professor Eliot G. Mears from Stan
ford were among the forty delegates
representing the United States at the
Institute of Pacific Relations.
With Dr. Alsberg at the round table
discussions on the growth of popula- j
tion and its relation to the existing
food supply, especially as it concerns 1
Japan, were Professor Nasu of Japan
and Dr. O. E. Baker, agricultural
economist of the United States Depart- i
ment of Agriculture. Plans were made !
for the initiation of longer time re- j
searches on the problem of the ratio i
of population and food supply in the j
Orient.
Because of the frank discussion of
common problems abong the respec
tive national groups at the Institute,
Dr. Alsberg believes that the knowl
edge of mutual difficulties thus un- i
covered will contribute considerably j
to the avoidance of conflict at a more |
distant time. Contributing to the fa
cility with which delegates could com- i
municate with each other, was the j

common knowledge of a single lan
guage, English, he said.
"China was represented by a group
of young men and women, all of whom
had been educated in America, and
who spoke English with greater ele
gance than we often do here," said Dr.
Alsberg, speaking of the absence of
linguistic barriers.
