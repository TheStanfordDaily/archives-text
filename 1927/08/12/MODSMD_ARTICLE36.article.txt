# Envelopes Necessary for Mailing of Summer Grades
## 
### 
All students who wish to have their j
grades mailed them at the close of the;
Summer Quarter should leave self-ad-'
dressed envelopes at the Registrar's Office
before the end of the quarter. At the
Registrar's Window envelopes may be ob
tained for the sum of five cents apiece,!
the profits of which go to the Convales- j
cent Home.
Grades will not be mailed unless self
addressed envelopes are left at the office j
and it is therefore advisable for each stu-1
dent to call at the office and leave such an
envelope if he is leaving the campus be- i
fore September 12. All grades will be j
ready fur mailing at about this date.
