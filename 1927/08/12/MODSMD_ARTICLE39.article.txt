# HONOLULU MEET WAS SCHOOL FOR ALL, SAYS PROFESSOR MEARS
## Tells of Model Pineapple Plantation on Lanai 
### 
That the second /biennial meeting of
the Institute of Pacific Relations was
worth while and he found it a "most
interesting school" to attend, was the
way in which Professor Eliot G. Mears
of the Economics Department summed
up his opinion of the meeting in a recent
interview soon after his return. His
interview in full is as follows:
"One of the most interesting schools I
have ever attended was the recent meet
ing of the Institute of Pacific Relations
at Honululu. There the members from
ten countries around the Pacific had a
strenuous daily round table session from
9 until 12:15 in the morning and 7:45 to
9:30 in the evening, with the afternoons
frequently taken up with committee gath
erings. ,
Rowell, Lee at Meeting
"The program called for regular for
ums on Saturday and Sunday evenings.
It was a unique sight to see men of the
stamp of Sir Frederick Whyte, for many
years head of the Legislative Assembly
of India, General Sir Arthur Currie,
President of McGill University, T. Z.
Koo, Chester Rowell, and Ivy Lee of New
jYork, respond faithfully to the recita
tion bells of Punahou School.
"It was an exceedingly worth while
international conference. In fact, Mr.
.Lionel Curtis, of the Royal Institute of
.International Affairs, stated at the Uni
yersity Club of Honolulu that in his
bpinion the League of Nations was doing
the greatest work in the world in bring
ing nations together, while the Institute
of Pacific Relations was the most effi
cient of any organization in bringing
together peoples from various la-ids.
Islands Hospitable
"The hospitality of the Islands was in
evidence with its traditional barrage of
teas, receptions, dinners, and entertain
ment by the different Oriental communi
ties. It was no easy task to dodge the
combination of business and social plan
nings.
"To me one of the pleasantest experi
ences was a three day trip to the Islands
of Lanai and Maui in company with sev
eral other delegates, as the guest of
"Jim" Dole, donor of the $35,000 Derby
race. When Dole graduated from Har
vard in 1899 he knew nothing of Hawaii
or of the pineapple game, then practically
unborn. His first annual payroll was
$4,720, which included $900 for himself.
Now salaries and wages are in the mil
lion dollar class.
Company Buys Is'and
Five years ago the Hawaiian Pineapple
Company, of which he is president,
bought the Island of Lanai for $1,100,-
000. Since then nearly $5,000,000 has
been expended there with the result that
a model industrial community, excellent
roads, good harbors, et cetera, have been
constructed. Now about half the pine
apple products of the company come
from Lanai, with excellent prospects of
tripling the products of the company,
which now is cultivating 100,000,000
plants, with a product of 3,000,000 cases
â€”one-third of the Islands' total."
