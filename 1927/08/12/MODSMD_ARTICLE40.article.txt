# CHARLIER DISCUSSES BELGIAN WRITERS OF THE LAST CENTURY
## 
### 
Belgian writers of the nineteenth
and twentieth century were discussed
in French by Dr. Gustave Charlier
Wednesday afternoon in the Little
Theatre. Dr. Charlier reviewed the
progress of Belgian letters from the
creation of a national literature by the
"Young Belgium" school in the 1880's
to the present time.
Although his survey included the at
tainments of prose fiction and the
drama, he gave particular attention to
the nineteenth century poets, for, lie
remarked, the "Young Belgium" move
ment was dominated by poets, and,
generally, the Belgian writers have
achieved a fuller expression in verse
than in prose.
He described and illustrated with
selections the florid and studied verse
of Lemooniere (called the "Marechal
des Lettres Beiges") and traced his
influence on a school of poets that
included Charles Van Lerberghe (who
was also impressed by the French
poet, Francois Coppee), the polite,
Watteauesque Albert Giraud, and
Valere Gille.
Dr. Charlier also outlined the transi
tional career of Emille Verhaeren, the
poet who turned from violent realism
to mysticism, and who kept through
out a Germanic heaviness of style that
has left its impression on a school of
modern poets.
Fiction, philosophy, and the drama
both of the nineteenth century and of
the present time occupied the latter
half of Dr. Charlier's survey. "The
latest plays are being produced," he
said, "at the Theatre du Marais aijd
at the Theatre d'ldee."
