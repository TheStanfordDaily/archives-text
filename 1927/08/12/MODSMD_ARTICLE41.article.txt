## 
### 
Wallace Rolls will give an organ j
recital on Sunday evening, with 80l- j
ton White, violinist, as assisting artist. |
This is the second program to be given j
with Mr. Rolls as acting organist.
Sunday's recital has been sub t sti- j
tuted for the program which was to
have been presented by the Russian
Choir of San Francisco.
The music is nearly all of a roman- '
tic nature:
Choral and Minuet Leon Boelmann i
(from the Gothique Suite)
Romance from Concerto in D Minor
Wieniawski
Mr. White
To the Sea Edward MacDowell
Sailors' Song Edward MacDowell
Andante from Violin Concerto
Felix Mendelssohn 1
Mr. White
Sonata Romantica Pietro Yon ;
Adagio â€”Finale
Recital Successful
Last Tuesday's recital was a sue- 1
cessful one which proved Mr. Rolls to !
be an unusually sympathetic interpre
ter of the music presented. "Romance j
sans paroles," by Bonnet, one of the 1
numbers on the program, was remark-1
able for its delicacy and finish. All of
the numbers showed a great diversity j
in moods.
Two recitals next week, on August j
16 and August 21, will conclude the |
programs for this summer. They will
recommence in October under the di-'
rection of Warren D. Allen.
