# Effectiveness Of Work By Experts Seen During Institute, Wilbur Declares
## 
### 
"We have demonstrated in the Insti
tute of Pacific Relations," said Presi
dent Wilbur at the University as
sembly Wednesday, "that any inter
ested people who want to get facts
can take experts and get facts and
settle at least fifty per cent of the
difficulties between nations. The point
is that we must use the methods of
the expert and the scholar and not the
methods of the politician.
"Facts are what we need. With
facts you will gain the ability to see
your way through instead of having to
fight your way through after you have
made fools of yourselves.
Value of Facts
"Through the presentation of facts
eighty-five per cent of the troubles be
tween nations will solve themselves
and disappear, leaving the remaining
fifteen per cent to be settled through
discussion and compromise."
This spirit of eagerness for facts
Dr. Wilbur characterized as the out
standing feature of the Institute ses

sions. It was like a school, he said,
with the members intent on learning
and not 011 winning adherents to a
position they had been "instructed" to
argue for.
"In one way," he said, "we accom
plished nothing. If you try to measure
accomplishment by resolutions passed
and by legislation accomplished you
will find nothing. We passed only one
resolution and that was to thank the
people of Honolulu for their hospi
tality; but we demonstrated that there
is hope »)f achieving world understand
ing through getting the men of affairs,
the experts of nations, together, in
stead of continuing to use the outworn
machinery of the old diplomacy."
