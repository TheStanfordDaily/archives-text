# Effectiveness Of Work By Experts Seen During Institute, Wilbur Declares
## 
### 
"We have demonstrated in the Insti
tute of Pacific Relations," said Presi
dent Wilbur at the University as
sembly Wednesday, "that any inter
ested people who want to get facts
can take experts and get facts and
settle at least fifty per cent of the
difficulties between nations. The point
is that we must use the methods of
the expert and the scholar and not the
methods of the politician.
"Facts are what we need. With
facts you will gain the ability to see
your way through instead of having to
fight your way through after you have
made fools of yourselves.
Value of Facts
"Through the presentation of facts
eighty-five per cent of the troubles be
tween nations will solve themselves
and disappear, leaving the remaining
fifteen per cent to be settled through
discussion and compromise."
This spirit of eagerness for facts
Dr. Wilbur characterized as the out
standing feature of the Institute ses

sions. It was like a school, he said,
with the members intent on learning
and not 011 winning adherents to a
position they had been "instructed" to
argue for.
"In one way," he said, "we accom
plished nothing. If you try to measure
accomplishment by resolutions passed
and by legislation accomplished you
will find nothing. We passed only one
resolution and that was to thank the
people of Honolulu for their hospi
tality; but we demonstrated that there
is hope »)f achieving world understand
ing through getting the men of affairs,
the experts of nations, together, in
stead of continuing to use the outworn
machinery of the old diplomacy."
Financed Privately
This was the second meeting of the
Institute. Among the nations repre
sented were Canada, New Zealand.
Australia, China, Japan, Korea, the
Plilippines, Hawaii, Great Britain, and
the United States. Representatives
were made up of three groups from
each country: business men and men
of affairs, journalists, and experts on
food and population. The Institute is
financed by private subscription, and
no one has delegated power or policy.
Student atmosphere permeated all
the meetings. The work was divided
into four round tables, where informal
discussions were held. It was en
deavored to have men from each na
tion of relatively the same interests
at the same table.
In speaking of the Japanese situa
tion, Dr. Wilbur said that if all the
ocean-going steamers on the Pacific
to and from Japan were used to carry
the excess of population from the
island empire, they could not keep up
with the rapid birth-rate in that coun
try. The one remedy for this situa
tion will be in a higher standard of
living, which in turn will serve to de
crease the birth-rate, he said.
He recommended a withdrawal of
the present American policy of ex
cluding Orientals from this country.
By allowing a small number to enter,
the possibility of a friendly footing
with China and Japan will be greatly
increased. This does not mean whole
sale immigration, but rather a suffi
cient number to prove that we do not
regard these races as inferior, he said.
China, said the President, will soon
free herself from the domination of
foreign nations. The question will be
whether or not she is to receive the
good-will of the United States in her
efforts. A slight breaking down of im
migration barriers will be the best
way to recognize China, he declared.
According to Wilbur, the problems
of the Far East must be solved by dis

interested scholars who will make an
impartial study of the situation. When
politicians attempt to solve these ques
tions they work toward a definite re
sult which they hope to obtain and the
countries involved suffer the conse
quences. America must gradually de
velop a machinery which will help
these Orientals in their problems.
At the conclusion of the session, Dr.
Wilbur was elected to serve the Insti
tute for another two years in the role

of its chairman. The next session, held
biennially, will be the third over which
he will have presided.

can take experts and get facts and
settle at least fifty per cent of the
difficulties between nations. The point
is that we must use the methods of
the expert and the scholar and not the
methods of the politician.
"Facts are what we need. With
facts you will gain the ability to see
your way through instead of having to
fight your way through after you have
made fools of yourselves.
Value of Facts
"Through the presentation of facts
eighty-five per cent of the troubles be
tween nations will solve themselves
and disappear, leaving the remaining
fifteen per cent to be settled through
discussion and compromise."
This spirit of eagerness for facts
Dr. Wilbur characterized as the out
standing feature of the Institute ses

sions. It was like a school, he said,
with the members intent on learning
and not 011 winning adherents to a
position they had been "instructed" to
argue for.
"In one way," he said, "we accom
plished nothing. If you try to measure
accomplishment by resolutions passed
and by legislation accomplished you
will find nothing. We passed only one
resolution and that was to thank the
people of Honolulu for their hospi
tality; but we demonstrated that there
is hope »)f achieving world understand
ing through getting the men of affairs,
the experts of nations, together, in
stead of continuing to use the outworn
machinery of the old diplomacy."
Financed Privately
This was the second meeting of the
Institute. Among the nations repre
sented were Canada, New Zealand.
Australia, China, Japan, Korea, the
Plilippines, Hawaii, Great Britain, and
the United States. Representatives
were made up of three groups from
each country: business men and men
of affairs, journalists, and experts on
food and population. The Institute is
financed by private subscription, and
no one has delegated power or policy.
Student atmosphere permeated all
the meetings. The work was divided
into four round tables, where informal
discussions were held. It was en
deavored to have men from each na
tion of relatively the same interests
at the same table.
In speaking of the Japanese situa
tion, Dr. Wilbur said that if all the
ocean-going steamers on the Pacific
to and from Japan were used to carry
the excess of population from the
island empire, they could not keep up
with the rapid birth-rate in that coun
try. The one remedy for this situa
tion will be in a higher standard of
living, which in turn will serve to de
crease the birth-rate, he said.
He recommended a withdrawal of
the present American policy of ex
cluding Orientals from this country.
By allowing a small number to enter,
the possibility of a friendly footing
with China and Japan will be greatly
increased. This does not mean whole
sale immigration, but rather a suffi
cient number to prove that we do not
regard these races as inferior, he said.
China, said the President, will soon
free herself from the domination of
foreign nations. The question will be
whether or not she is to receive the
good-will of the United States in her
efforts. A slight breaking down of im
migration barriers will be the best
way to recognize China, he declared.
According to Wilbur, the problems
of the Far East must be solved by dis

interested scholars who will make an
impartial study of the situation. When
politicians attempt to solve these ques
tions they work toward a definite re
sult which they hope to obtain and the
countries involved suffer the conse
quences. America must gradually de
velop a machinery which will help
these Orientals in their problems.
At the conclusion of the session, Dr.
Wilbur was elected to serve the Insti
tute for another two years in the role

of its chairman. The next session, held
biennially, will be the third over which
he will have presided.
"We have demonstrated in the Insti
tute of Pacific Relations," said Presi
dent Wilbur at the University as
sembly Wednesday, "that any inter
