# PROFESSOR GUERARD LECTURES WEDNESDAY ON ANATOLE FRANCE
## Thinks French Author Has Had Excessive Praise 
### 
Dr. Albert Guerard of the Stanford
English department was the speaker
at an open meeting of the Cercle
Francais held last evening in the Wo
men's Clubhouse. His subject was the
Building Problem of Modern Paris.
"Americans think of Paris,'' he said,
"as the center of art and pleasure. It
attracts more artists and pleasure
seekers than any other city in the
world, but these artists and pleasure
seekers amount to an almost negligible
minority in the population. They can
be generously estimated at two hun
dred thousand, whereas the total popu
lation is from three to five million.
Paris is not only a city with tradi
tions; it also is a center of industry
and commerce and the largest port in
France."
City Planning "Fascinating"
Like other industrial centers, Paris
has a modern building problem. "City
planning is a fascinating problem,"
said Dr. Guerard. "and it becomes
even more fascinating when it in
volves the adjustment of past and
present, of beauty and expediency."
The history of Paris has favored a
symmetrical development and has con
tributed to its beauty. Paris has not
only kept its hold on an age of superla
tive architectural achievement; it also
has consistently reconciled necessity
and beauty. The ramparts of the me
dieval city have left their traces—a
circle of boulevards that could not
have been cut through the modern
city. The Avenue des Champs Elysees
with its bordering groves and parks
could scarcely have been opened out
of an unbroken succession ot' city j
blocks. Art and expediency have been j
reconciled In the development of the j
city. They can be reconciled in the i
solution of the problem of modern
times, the problem of commercial ex- i
pansion.
No Skyscrapers in Paris
There are both aesthetic and prac
tical arguments against the skyscraper
as a means to this end. This innova
tion would destroy the beauty of Paris. '
"The width of the streets, the height !
of the historic buildings, and the trees j
must all be taken into consideration. !
At the present time the width of the !
boulevards (seventy to one hundred !
feet) is approximately the same as j
the prevailing height of the buildings j
on the boulevards—an ideal propor- 1
tion. The skyline of the city is domi
nated by buildings of beauty and his- j
torical interest, such as the cathedral l
of Notre Dame. They would dwindle j
out of sight in a city of skyscrapers, j
Then, the trees, which flourish in the '
midst of Paris, could not live in such '
canyons as Wall Street.
"These considerations are purely j
aesthetic, but, as I have said, there is j
a practical argument against the sky- j
scraper. In a city as densely popu- j
lated as Paris they would be as much i
in the way of civic efficiency as they 1
would be disfiguring. Paris is more l
densely populated than either New
\ ork or Chicago, and the skyscraper
would further congestion. It would con- :
centrate business and impede traffic j
by throwing too many people into the i
street at once."

has a modern building problem. "City
planning is a fascinating problem,"
said Dr. Guerard. "and it becomes
even more fascinating when it in
volves the adjustment of past and
present, of beauty and expediency."
The history of Paris has favored a
symmetrical development and has con
tributed to its beauty. Paris has not
only kept its hold on an age of superla
tive architectural achievement; it also
has consistently reconciled necessity
and beauty. The ramparts of the me
dieval city have left their traces—a
circle of boulevards that could not
have been cut through the modern
city. The Avenue des Champs Elysees
with its bordering groves and parks
could scarcely have been opened out
of an unbroken succession ot' city j
blocks. Art and expediency have been j
reconciled In the development of the j
city. They can be reconciled in the i
solution of the problem of modern
times, the problem of commercial ex- i
pansion.
No Skyscrapers in Paris
There are both aesthetic and prac
tical arguments against the skyscraper
as a means to this end. This innova
tion would destroy the beauty of Paris. '
"The width of the streets, the height !
of the historic buildings, and the trees j
must all be taken into consideration. !
At the present time the width of the !
boulevards (seventy to one hundred !
feet) is approximately the same as j
the prevailing height of the buildings j
on the boulevards—an ideal propor- 1
tion. The skyline of the city is domi
nated by buildings of beauty and his- j
torical interest, such as the cathedral l
of Notre Dame. They would dwindle j
out of sight in a city of skyscrapers, j
Then, the trees, which flourish in the '
midst of Paris, could not live in such '
canyons as Wall Street.
"These considerations are purely j
aesthetic, but, as I have said, there is j
a practical argument against the sky- j
scraper. In a city as densely popu- j
lated as Paris they would be as much i
in the way of civic efficiency as they 1
would be disfiguring. Paris is more l
densely populated than either New
\ ork or Chicago, and the skyscraper
would further congestion. It would con- :
centrate business and impede traffic j
by throwing too many people into the i
street at once."
Dr. Albert Guerard of the Stanford
English department was the speaker
at an open meeting of the Cercle
Francais held last evening in the Wo
men's Clubhouse. His subject was the
Building Problem of Modern Paris.
"Americans think of Paris,'' he said,
"as the center of art and pleasure. It
attracts more artists and pleasure
seekers than any other city in the
world, but these artists and pleasure
seekers amount to an almost negligible
minority in the population. They can
be generously estimated at two hun
dred thousand, whereas the total popu
lation is from three to five million.
Paris is not only a city with tradi
tions; it also is a center of industry
and commerce and the largest port in
France."
