# PROFESSOR GUERARD LECTURES WEDNESDAY ON ANATOLE FRANCE
## Thinks French Author Has Had Excessive Praise

Dr. Albert Guerard of the Stanford
English department was the speaker
at an open meeting of the Cercle
Francais held last evening in the Wo
men's Clubhouse. His subject was the
Building Problem of Modern Paris.

"as the center of art and pleasure. It
attracts more artists and pleasure
seekers than any other city in the

seekers amount to an almost negligible
minority in the population. They can
be generously estimated at two hun

lation is from three to five million.
Paris is not only a city with tradi
tions; it also is a center of industry
and commerce and the largest port in
France."

has a modern building problem. "City
planning is a fascinating problem,"
said Dr. Guerard. "and it becomes
even more fascinating when it in
volves the adjustment of past and
present, of beauty and expediency."
The history of Paris has favored a
symmetrical development and has con
tributed to its beauty. Paris has not
only kept its hold on an age of superla
tive architectural achievement; it also
has consistently reconciled necessity
and beauty. The ramparts of the me
dieval city have left their traces—a
circle of boulevards that could not
have been cut through the modern
city. The Avenue des Champs Elysees
with its bordering groves and parks
could scarcely have been opened out
