Men—
Vou can't deceive an AUGUST
trout with a June fly—what he
wants is the fly that flies in
August.
The merchandise in this store is
always in keeping with the sea
son. No attempt is ever made to
make you purchase something
which has served its usefulness,
or is any "bait" displayed in the
windows to induce you to buy
something "just as good ' when
inside the store. Deception does
not pay today any more than it
did a hundred years ago. And a
store pays dearly when it de
ceives.
Drop in when you're in Paly and
let us show you some of the new
Fall shoes now arriving. You'll
not be urged to buy.
