# CAPACITY AUDIENCE APPLAUDS DAVIS IN FRIDAY NIGHT PLAY
## "Angel in House" Regarded A Success from Number Of Laughs CAST IS WELL ROUNDED Elizabeth Wilbur and Young Score Success in Difficult Roles 
### Back Row 
A capacity audience, which chuckled
arid guffawed vigorously from time o
time, made the performance Friday
night of "The Angel in the House" a
tribute to the ability and charm >112
Gordon Davis as both director a d
actor. The play itself might be re
garded as "trivial," but as su«li it wis
a distinct relief from the usual run of
heavier stuff which is usually offerd.
Technically, the flaw of the piy
was that it did not offer enough possi
bilities for characterization which j he
able cast could have made use of. but
their overcoming of this hanilap
went far toward making the play »iat
it was —a real success from the slnd
point of the audience. I
Really, much of the effectivencl of
the play was contributed by til at
mosphere in which if was presfted.
The audience was comfortably lited
for once, and everyone had a fuJ'iew
of the stage. That the proJtion
would have been so amusing rhen
viewed from the hard
seats is a stretch of the iniagltitfn.
Davis Plays Angel 112
Mr. Davis as the Honorabl Hya
cinth Petavel was at all thneli mus
ing. Playing the part of the jUgel"
who attempted to completely 110 the
life and events of his associal, who
in the end became ensnared la love
affair despite his struggles, fd who
was lovable withal, he was |e cen
tral character of the farce, ie part
itself did not measure up top capa
bilities which we have comep know
in Mr. Davis, but he confuted a
singular charm and personality to the
character.
During the first act, Davis had a
tendency to race through his lines at
almost too fast a rate for the audience
to follow. But as the play went on, and
found a more even tempo, this became
Jess and less noticeable. We can only
attribute the first-act performance to
the fact that he must have been trying
to speed up the action a bit, which
was hopelessly dragging. In the last
act he rose to sheer comedy heights,
giving a deft and sure performance.
Elizabeth Wilbur Effective
Playing opposite Mr. Davis, in the
role of Lady Sarel, Elizabeth Wilbur
added one more to her list of local
successes. But again we find a part
which did not measure up to the abil
ity of the person assigned it. Not that
Miss Wilbur did not give a delightful
performance, but one could not help
but feel her capable of assuming much
more intense roles than that in which
Khe was cast Friday night.
As usual, Miss Wilbur's voice and
stage presence were real high lights of
the show. She seems to have a vivid
and glowing personality which pro
jects itself out over the footlights, and
into the hearts of the audience. As a
comedian, she knows the value of
every turn of the head, every figure
of speech.
Bindloss a Difficult Role
D. Palmer Young, as Sir Rupert
Bindloss, did an intelligent piece of
•acting. His role was somewhat like
that of the interlocutor in the old min
strel shows—the feeder. As such, it
was difficult. But Mr. Young, despite
a first-act tendency towards being me
chanical, gave the part a sincerity and
naturalness.
Adelaide Mack, Catherine Plant,
Norris James, and Tom Watt, the quar
tet of lovers, gave amusing interpreta
tions of what were in the main un
interesting roles. They were really
background, albeit necessary back
ground. Mr. James, in particular,
struck our fancy. Whether it existed
or not, we could not help but remark
a likeness between his stage appear
ance and that of Mr. Charley Chase,
the motion-picture comedian. A little
change of makeup, and there he would
be.
Sets Were Excellent
The sets, designed and executed by
Leslie Kiler and his assistants,
were excellent. Mr. Kiler deserves a
great deal of the credit, for the suc
cess of Stanford productions. The
third-act setting in particular, despite
a scene-schifting wait of nearly twenty
minutes, was well done.
To return to the play itself. It was
amusing, and the audience enjoyed it.
That is the main thing. And although
one wouldn't care for this sort of a
thing for steady diet, yet many are
glad Mr. Davis decided to round out
the summer with something of a light
and amusing nature. And the seats
were fine.

Davis Plays Angel 112
Mr. Davis as the Honorabl Hya
cinth Petavel was at all thneli mus
ing. Playing the part of the jUgel"
who attempted to completely 110 the
life and events of his associal, who
in the end became ensnared la love
affair despite his struggles, fd who
was lovable withal, he was |e cen
tral character of the farce, ie part
itself did not measure up top capa
bilities which we have comep know
in Mr. Davis, but he confuted a
singular charm and personality to the
character.
During the first act, Davis had a
tendency to race through his lines at
almost too fast a rate for the audience
to follow. But as the play went on, and
found a more even tempo, this became
Jess and less noticeable. We can only
attribute the first-act performance to
the fact that he must have been trying
to speed up the action a bit, which
was hopelessly dragging. In the last
act he rose to sheer comedy heights,
giving a deft and sure performance.
Elizabeth Wilbur Effective
Playing opposite Mr. Davis, in the
role of Lady Sarel, Elizabeth Wilbur
added one more to her list of local
successes. But again we find a part
which did not measure up to the abil
ity of the person assigned it. Not that
Miss Wilbur did not give a delightful
performance, but one could not help
but feel her capable of assuming much
more intense roles than that in which
Khe was cast Friday night.
As usual, Miss Wilbur's voice and
stage presence were real high lights of
the show. She seems to have a vivid
and glowing personality which pro
jects itself out over the footlights, and
into the hearts of the audience. As a
comedian, she knows the value of
every turn of the head, every figure
of speech.
Bindloss a Difficult Role
D. Palmer Young, as Sir Rupert
Bindloss, did an intelligent piece of
•acting. His role was somewhat like
that of the interlocutor in the old min
strel shows—the feeder. As such, it
was difficult. But Mr. Young, despite
a first-act tendency towards being me
chanical, gave the part a sincerity and
naturalness.
Adelaide Mack, Catherine Plant,
Norris James, and Tom Watt, the quar
tet of lovers, gave amusing interpreta
tions of what were in the main un
interesting roles. They were really
background, albeit necessary back
ground. Mr. James, in particular,
struck our fancy. Whether it existed
or not, we could not help but remark
a likeness between his stage appear
ance and that of Mr. Charley Chase,
the motion-picture comedian. A little
change of makeup, and there he would
be.
Sets Were Excellent
The sets, designed and executed by
Leslie Kiler and his assistants,
were excellent. Mr. Kiler deserves a
great deal of the credit, for the suc
cess of Stanford productions. The
third-act setting in particular, despite
a scene-schifting wait of nearly twenty
minutes, was well done.
To return to the play itself. It was
amusing, and the audience enjoyed it.
That is the main thing. And although
one wouldn't care for this sort of a
thing for steady diet, yet many are
glad Mr. Davis decided to round out
the summer with something of a light
and amusing nature. And the seats
were fine.
A capacity audience, which chuckled
arid guffawed vigorously from time o
time, made the performance Friday
night of "The Angel in the House" a
tribute to the ability and charm >112
Gordon Davis as both director a d
actor. The play itself might be re
garded as "trivial," but as su«li it wis
a distinct relief from the usual run of
heavier stuff which is usually offerd.

was that it did not offer enough possi

in the end became ensnared la love
affair despite his struggles, fd who
was lovable withal, he was |e cen
tral character of the farce, ie part
itself did not measure up top capa
bilities which we have comep know
in Mr. Davis, but he confuted a
singular charm and personality to the
character.
During the first act, Davis had a
tendency to race through his lines at
almost too fast a rate for the audience
to follow. But as the play went on, and
found a more even tempo, this became
Jess and less noticeable. We can only
attribute the first-act performance to
the fact that he must have been trying
to speed up the action a bit, which
was hopelessly dragging. In the last
act he rose to sheer comedy heights,
giving a deft and sure performance.
Elizabeth Wilbur Effective
Playing opposite Mr. Davis, in the
role of Lady Sarel, Elizabeth Wilbur
added one more to her list of local
successes. But again we find a part
which did not measure up to the abil
ity of the person assigned it. Not that
Miss Wilbur did not give a delightful
performance, but one could not help
but feel her capable of assuming much
more intense roles than that in which
Khe was cast Friday night.
As usual, Miss Wilbur's voice and
stage presence were real high lights of
the show. She seems to have a vivid
and glowing personality which pro
jects itself out over the footlights, and
into the hearts of the audience. As a
comedian, she knows the value of
every turn of the head, every figure
of speech.
Bindloss a Difficult Role
D. Palmer Young, as Sir Rupert
Bindloss, did an intelligent piece of
•acting. His role was somewhat like
that of the interlocutor in the old min
strel shows—the feeder. As such, it
was difficult. But Mr. Young, despite
a first-act tendency towards being me
chanical, gave the part a sincerity and
naturalness.
Adelaide Mack, Catherine Plant,
Norris James, and Tom Watt, the quar
tet of lovers, gave amusing interpreta
tions of what were in the main un
interesting roles. They were really
background, albeit necessary back
ground. Mr. James, in particular,
struck our fancy. Whether it existed
or not, we could not help but remark
a likeness between his stage appear
ance and that of Mr. Charley Chase,
the motion-picture comedian. A little
change of makeup, and there he would
be.
Sets Were Excellent
The sets, designed and executed by
Leslie Kiler and his assistants,
were excellent. Mr. Kiler deserves a
great deal of the credit, for the suc
cess of Stanford productions. The
third-act setting in particular, despite
a scene-schifting wait of nearly twenty
minutes, was well done.
To return to the play itself. It was
amusing, and the audience enjoyed it.
That is the main thing. And although
one wouldn't care for this sort of a
thing for steady diet, yet many are
glad Mr. Davis decided to round out
the summer with something of a light
and amusing nature. And the seats
were fine.
