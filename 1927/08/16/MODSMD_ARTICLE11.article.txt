# Meiklejohn Talks Tonight At Basketball Pavilion On 'Democracy In Education'
## 
### 
Because of the wide interest which
has been created in the lecture by Dr.
Alexander Meiklejohn this evening,
the place of meeting for the occasion
has been changed from the Little
Theatre to the Basketball Pavilion.
The address, which will be on "Democ
racy in Education," will take place at
eight o'clock.
When the fall semester begins at
the University of Wisconsin, Dr.
Meiklejohn will be head of the new
experimental college there, according
to a plan conceived and developed by
him while he was president of Am
herst College.
Frank Favored Plan
"Dr. Glenn Frank, who is president
of the University of Wisconsin, is the
one who saw the possibility of insti
tuting this new college in the univer
sity as his first administrative move,"
said Dr. Meiklejohn.
"Democracy in Education," the sub
ject upon which Dr. Meiklejohn will
talk tonight, involves a problem of
great magnitude and importance to the
people of America. The enormous in

crease in prosperity in the United
States makes the possibility of secur
ing an education at once easy and
| difficult, he believes. "It is like 'the
rich man entering into the kingdom
of heaven'," he stated, quoting a
biblical parallel. Students in this coun
try have the means to sustain them
selves while securing an education,
but the very fact that they have this
financial abundance gives many of
them an attitude which is opposed to
the acquisition of a true education.
To achieve democracy in education,
he feels that the education must be
liberal first and foremost.
Any Subject a Liberal Education
"Any subject properly studied," he
says, "gives a liberal education."
He was asked what he meant when
he used the term "properly studied" in
relation to a liberal education.
"It is studied properly when it is
studied so that at the same time you
study all the other subjects you ought
to be studying," he answered. .
"The relation of a nation to democ
racy can be measured by its relation to
liberal education," he continued. "I
think there is a very powerful drive
among the young people in our col
leges toward liberal education. They
would like to have it but it is very
difficult to arrange."
It is the purpose of the experimental
college about to have its inception at
Wisconsin, to provide this liberal edu
cation which Dr. Meiklejohn finds so
lacking in the present system of higher
education.
By liberal education he does not
mean impractical education.
Seeks Practical Education
"All education should be essentially
practical," he said. "However, in spe
cialized education there are certain
values you lose, those in the realm of
taste, appreciation, and understand
ing; also, the control that comes from
understanding is absent when the edu
cation is no' liberal.
"But you can't do anything toward
liberalization of education in any large
university as a whole because you dis
turb the general scheme of things,"
said Dr. Meiklejohn. "The arrange
ment which is about to go into effect at
Wisconsin avoids this very wisely.
The experimental college will be only
one of the several colleges in the uni
versity."
Faculty in Close Touch
Only 120 freshman students will be
admitted to the experimental college
at Wisconsin this fall. All these men
will live in the same dormitory as
will all the unmarried men of the
faculty while those who are married
will spend the greater part of their
time 011 duty in their offices in the
same building.
There will be no fixed lectures to
attend or specific classes to which the
students must go. Each member of the
faculty will have under his supervision
ten students who will study what they
please under the general topic "Greek
Civilization" and will make reports at
specific times on what they have
learned. Since everyone will study the
same general subject all will be inter
ested in the same things so there will
be a community of interest.
