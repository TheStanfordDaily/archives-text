# Meiklejohn Talks Tonight At Basketball Pavilion On 'Democracy In Education'
## 
### 
Because of the wide interest which
has been created in the lecture by Dr.
Alexander Meiklejohn this evening,
the place of meeting for the occasion

Theatre to the Basketball Pavilion.

eight o'clock.
When the fall semester begins at

Meiklejohn will be head of the new

To achieve democracy in education,

He was asked what he meant when
he used the term "properly studied" in
relation to a liberal education.
"It is studied properly when it is

study all the other subjects you ought
to be studying," he answered. .
