# NAVARRO, CHARLIER TO TALK THUSDAY AT PHILOLOGICAL GROUP
## Leonard Schwartz and Miss Leah Dennis Also on Program 
### 
Professor Tomas Navarro Tomas
and Professor Gustave Charlier are
among the four speakers at the meet
ing of the Philological Association
which will be held at the Women's
Clubhouse at 8 o'clock Thursday eve
ning. The two other speakers are Pro
fessor Leonard Schwartz and Miss
Leah Dennis.
Professor Navarro will deliver an
address in Spanish on the philological
activities and research work of the
Centro de Estadios Historicos in
Madrid. He is the Director of the
Laboratory of Experimental Phonetics
there and is one of the leading pho
netic authorities in the world.
Professor Charlier will speak on the
genesis of Lamartine's story, "Grazi
iella." Charlier himself recently pub
lished an edition of this work and is
interested in its origins.
Professor Schwartz will discuss the
opportunities for literary research in
southern California. He has recently
been visiting some of the libraries in
Los Angeles and finds that they con
tain an excellent selection of modern
American prose and poetry. While
they have not many works in French,
there are numerous translations and
criticisms of French authors.
Miss Dennis, who is completing her
requirements for a Ph.D. degree here
this summer, will discuss "The Vogue
for Machiavelli at Cambridge before
1600." Letters from Gabriel Harvey to
Spenser and other friends testify to a
vogue for Machiavellian doctrines at
Cambridge in the 1570'5. Since several
of the most important men who dis
cuss Machiavelli or portray the
Machiavellian villain on the stage
were in Cambridge during and follow
ing the statement of this vogue it
seems not unlikely that their concept
of Machiavelli is to be traced back to
this interest they acquired in him dur
ing their days at Cambridge, accord
ing to Miss Dennis. The men thus in
fluenced are Greene, Marlowe, Nash,
and the Harveys.
