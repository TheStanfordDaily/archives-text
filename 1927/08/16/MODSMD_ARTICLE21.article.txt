# Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn
## 
### 
Students and others interested will have the opportunity tonight of
listening to Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, nationally famous educator, and
head and devisor of the "experimental college"' about to be given a trial
at the University of Wisconsin.
The lecture will be in the Basketball Pavilion, since the Little Theatre
would be unable to hold the crowd which will desire to hear Dr.
Meiklejohn in his appearance here. Stanford people are interested in
him on account of his attempt to solve a problem which this University,
along with all others, is now facing—namely, what shall be clone with
the first two years of the old college course.
Stanford would solve this problem by limiting the numbers admitted
to the first two years of undergraduate work in ratio with the junior
colleges' ability to care for them. Meiklejohn would take the students in
their first two years and put them into a separate college within the
university. At the end of that time, the students will then pick up the
regular universiy work.
In one respect. Dr. Meiklejohn's plan is similar to the Stanford
Independent Study plan, in that both call for the study of a compre
hensive field, based on individual work on the part of the student.
However, the Stanford plan is for students in their last two years, and
for only those who have demonstrated their ability by past performance.
