# The
						End Approaches
## 
### 
The last of the Summer Quarter plays has been presented. Last
Saturday saw the last of the week-end excursions. Tonight we have the
last of the Tuesday evening lectures, and tomorrow the last of the
1 Wednesday afternoon series. Before we know it, the last class will he
here, and then finals will be over, and the campus deserted until October.
Next Friday's will be the last issue of this paper. Those who have
notices which they want to appear should bring them or phone them
into the office at once, in order to insure their appearance.
