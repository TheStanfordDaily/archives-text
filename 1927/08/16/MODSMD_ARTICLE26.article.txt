# OCTOBER 15 IS NEW DATE FOR SAILING OF FLOATING UNIVERSITY
## Postponement Will Not Change Plans for Gray, Bassett 
### 
October fifteenth will be the sailing
date of the round-the-world trip of the
co-educational floating university
"Aurania" instead of September 21, the
original date. Two Stanford professors,
both of the English department, will
be faculty members of the university.
Professor Hendy D. Gray will teach
English and Professor Lee E. Bassett
will give a course in public speaking.
Margaret Ware, Stanford '24, and
Evelyn Brownell, Stanford '27, have
enrolled for the cruise. They plan to
combine a tour of the world with a
year of advanced study.
This postponement, announced to
day by officials of the International
University Cruise, Inc., at 11 Broad
way, New York, who are operating
the university in conjunction with the
Cunard S.S. Company, will make no
curtailment of the itinerary and will
on the other hand make the visits to
some of the countries more seasonable
and advantageous. It will bring the
floating university to India in January
instead of December, and will make
the extended European tour begin on
April eighth instead of March four
teenth, bringing the cruise home to
New York early in June.
Several Reasons for Change
According to the officials, there are
several reasons for this decision. In
the first place, further time is needed
for organization under the new presi
dent, Dr. Walter Wallace McLaren of
the Williamstown Institute of Politics.
It also will give time for additional
registrations, as the university reports
that it has not yet reached its quota
of five hundred students.
President McLaren was for many
years a professor at Imperial Univer
sity in Tokio, and he has traveled ex
tensively in the Far East. The perma
nent contacts he has made in foreign
countries as an organizer of the Insti
tute of Politics will assure that the
"University Afloat" can carry out its
educational programs on the visits
ashore. His appointment is resulting
in the inclusion of an increased num
ber of graduate courses in the depart
ments of Political Economy, Interna
tional Relations, and Government.
The courses offered by the floating

university will be supplemented, but j
not interrupted, by sightseeing trips. \
Each class will continue its activities :
on shore under its own professor and |
a professor from a local university.
This arrangement makes it possible
to fill the requirements of a college
year and receive a full year's credit
while seeing the world.
The delay in the sailing date affords an I
opportunity for late enrollment. Dr. Gra\ j
and Dr. Bassett have expressed their j
willingness to talk with students who are
interested. The necessary arrangements
including steamship reservations, t im
ports, and curricula, must be attend
at once if one is to join the party.
"1 am enthusiastic myself," says Dr. j
Gray, "about this trip and the opportuni- i
ties it offers for a student who wishes to j
see the world without losing time from !
his academic career. Being unable to
afford it is an excuse, but even that
seems rather a poor one in these days
when money can be borrowed for educa
tional purposes. Experienced travelers j
who notice the itinerary of the Aurania j
are surprised at its scope and at the time j
it allows for the tour."

co-educational floating university
"Aurania" instead of September 21, the
original date. Two Stanford professors,
both of the English department, will
be faculty members of the university.
Professor Hendy D. Gray will teach
English and Professor Lee E. Bassett
will give a course in public speaking.
Margaret Ware, Stanford '24, and
Evelyn Brownell, Stanford '27, have
enrolled for the cruise. They plan to
combine a tour of the world with a
year of advanced study.
This postponement, announced to
day by officials of the International
University Cruise, Inc., at 11 Broad
way, New York, who are operating
the university in conjunction with the
Cunard S.S. Company, will make no
curtailment of the itinerary and will
on the other hand make the visits to
some of the countries more seasonable
and advantageous. It will bring the
floating university to India in January
instead of December, and will make
the extended European tour begin on
April eighth instead of March four
teenth, bringing the cruise home to
New York early in June.
Several Reasons for Change
According to the officials, there are
several reasons for this decision. In
the first place, further time is needed
for organization under the new presi
dent, Dr. Walter Wallace McLaren of
the Williamstown Institute of Politics.
It also will give time for additional
registrations, as the university reports
that it has not yet reached its quota
of five hundred students.
President McLaren was for many
years a professor at Imperial Univer
sity in Tokio, and he has traveled ex
tensively in the Far East. The perma
nent contacts he has made in foreign
countries as an organizer of the Insti
tute of Politics will assure that the
"University Afloat" can carry out its
educational programs on the visits
ashore. His appointment is resulting
in the inclusion of an increased num
ber of graduate courses in the depart
ments of Political Economy, Interna
tional Relations, and Government.
The courses offered by the floating

university will be supplemented, but j
not interrupted, by sightseeing trips. \
Each class will continue its activities :
on shore under its own professor and |
a professor from a local university.
This arrangement makes it possible
to fill the requirements of a college
year and receive a full year's credit
while seeing the world.
The delay in the sailing date affords an I
opportunity for late enrollment. Dr. Gra\ j
and Dr. Bassett have expressed their j
willingness to talk with students who are
interested. The necessary arrangements
including steamship reservations, t im
ports, and curricula, must be attend
at once if one is to join the party.
"1 am enthusiastic myself," says Dr. j
Gray, "about this trip and the opportuni- i
ties it offers for a student who wishes to j
see the world without losing time from !
his academic career. Being unable to
afford it is an excuse, but even that
seems rather a poor one in these days
when money can be borrowed for educa
tional purposes. Experienced travelers j
who notice the itinerary of the Aurania j
are surprised at its scope and at the time j
it allows for the tour."
