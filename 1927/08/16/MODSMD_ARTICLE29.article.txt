# SOME UNITED STATES OPEN HISTORY
## 
### FEG MURRAY 
Bobby Jones, in describing his experi
ences in his first United States open
championship at the Inverness Club in
1920, said that he was "hypnotized" by
the tremendous finish, wherein five play
ers had a chance to win right up to the
seventy-second green, and that "I con
cluded right there that the open cham
pionship was the thing. It still is my
idea of a TOURNAMENT."
The efforts and achievements of the
redoubtable Bobby in the U. S. open
championship will require a special car
toon and story, so let us look at some
of the other winners (yes, there have
been other winners, though that may be
news to some who have only followed
golf in the last year or so) with especial
emphasis on the "pre-Jones" era.
Willie Dunn won a so-called national
open championship at the St. Andrews
Golf Club, Mt. Hope, N.Y., back in 1894,
two up from W. Campbell, but the first
real tournament at stroke competition
was held the following year at Newport,
and Horace Rawlins, a gent with a funny
cap, a brushy moustache, and long pants,
won by two strokes from the same Willie
Dunn, shooting a 173 for thirty-six holes.
Imagine where 173 would get you in a
U. S. open nowadays.
Skip now to 1900, to the Chicago Golf
Club links at Wheaton, Illinois, the town
later made famous by a red-headed ice
man. The tournament that year was
graced by the presence of the two famous
Britishers, Harry Vardon and J. H. Tay
lor. At one hole Vardon made the mis
take of regarding a six-inch putt with
such indifference that in trying to knock
it gaily into the hole he missed the ball
entirely and struck his club into the
ground. But he won the tournament
anyway, with Taylor second.
Like the well known pyorrhea ad, Wil
lie Anderson took four out of the next
five tournaments. The boys at that time
had been playing seventy-two holes since
1898, and in 1906 Aleck Smith made the
first score of less than 300, with a 295.

George Sargent reduced this to 290 in
1909, Hagen tied it in 1914, and, two
years later, Chick Evans made the lowest
score on record in the U. S. open with a
286, two under even fours for the four
rounds. Jack McDermott of Atlantic
City won the title in 1911 and 1912, being
the first American-born player to win

and the last player to win twice in suc
cession.
The "piece dc resistance" of SU the
U. S. open championships was Francis
Ouimct's tie with the two famous English
pros, Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, in
1913, at Brookline, and his subsequent
win in the play-off. Ouimet was a 19-

year-old amateur player from Woodland,
Mass., and his startling victory gave golf
as great an impetus in America as the
deeds of the fiery McLoughlin gave to
tennis about the same time. Both were
"torchbearers" in sports that had been
regarded up to that time as more or less
for the rich and for the elderly folk.
