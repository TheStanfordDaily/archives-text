# GUERARD TO DISCUSS ANATOLE FRANCE IN LECTURE TOMORROW
## Will Oppose View of New Book Published by Barry Cerf 
### 
Anatole France has been somewhat
unjustly condemned since his recent
death, according to Professor Albert
L. Guerard, who will speak in English
Wednesday afternoon at 4:15 in the
{ Little Theatre on the subject of -"A
Vindication of Anatole France." The
lecture is open to the public.
Professor Guerard assigns three rea
sons as the cause of the decline of
the glory of Anatole France. First,
his reputation was absurdly high be
fore his death. In the second place, his
funeral was seized upon as the pretext
for demonstration by members of the
Communist group in France. Finally,
his secretary published certain books
on his private life, which were far
from complimentary.
Will Oppose Cerf View
The expressed attitude of many
| critics found its culmination in the 1
publication of a book on"The Degra- ■
dation of a Great Artist," by Professor j
Barry Cerf of Reed College. The con
clusion drawn by this book will be i
opposed by Professor Guerard.
"There is one aspect of Anatole
France that I don't want, to defend at
all," said Professor Guerard, in speak
ing of his lecture, "and that is the so
called immorality in his writings. I
believe that is due to a morbid strain
which developed into a disease as he
grew older," Guerard explained.
"There is much else in Anatole
France. I want to insist that he was
not purely a skeptic and a cynic. This
is proved by his very consistent ad
vocacy of the cause of the common
people," says Professor Guerard.
France's Party Affiliations
He goes on to explain that the sym
pathy which Anatole France held for
the Socialist Party, of which he was a
member, although he was not a Com
munist, was without any self-interest,
for he had no political ambitions. His
connection with the Socialists brought
him no money, but was the cause of
much social embarrassment, and near
ly ruined his life.
"Of course one must remember,"
said Professor Guerard, "that Anatole
France in his political sympathies with
the Socialist party in France, and his
advocacy of their foreign policy during
the War, while he was not in line with
the French conservative group, was
merely expressing the common sense
attitude of the average American."
Author of Several Books
Guerard, who is Professor of General
Literature at Stanford, has had un
usual opportunity for study in the
literary field. French Civilization, in
various phases, has been the subject
of a number of books which he has
written and of courses he has given.
"French Prophets of Yesterday,"
"French Civilization in the XIX Cen
tury," "Five Masters of French Ro
mance," "French Civilization from Its
Origin to the Close of the Middle
Ages," "The Napoleonic Legehd," and
"Honore de Balzac" indicate his inter
est as an author.

Author of Several Books
Guerard, who is Professor of General
Literature at Stanford, has had un
usual opportunity for study in the
literary field. French Civilization, in
various phases, has been the subject
of a number of books which he has
written and of courses he has given.
"French Prophets of Yesterday,"
"French Civilization in the XIX Cen
tury," "Five Masters of French Ro
mance," "French Civilization from Its
Origin to the Close of the Middle
Ages," "The Napoleonic Legehd," and
"Honore de Balzac" indicate his inter

Anatole France has been somewhat
unjustly condemned since his recent
death, according to Professor Albert
L. Guerard, who will speak in English
Wednesday afternoon at 4:15 in the
{ Little Theatre on the subject of -"A
Vindication of Anatole France." The
lecture is open to the public.
Professor Guerard assigns three rea
sons as the cause of the decline of
the glory of Anatole France. First,
his reputation was absurdly high be
fore his death. In the second place, his
funeral was seized upon as the pretext
for demonstration by members of the
Communist group in France. Finally,
his secretary published certain books
on his private life, which were far
from complimentary.
Will Oppose Cerf View
The expressed attitude of many
| critics found its culmination in the 1
publication of a book on"The Degra- ■
dation of a Great Artist," by Professor j
Barry Cerf of Reed College. The con
clusion drawn by this book will be i
opposed by Professor Guerard.
"There is one aspect of Anatole
France that I don't want, to defend at
all," said Professor Guerard, in speak
ing of his lecture, "and that is the so
called immorality in his writings. I
believe that is due to a morbid strain
which developed into a disease as he
grew older," Guerard explained.
"There is much else in Anatole
France. I want to insist that he was
not purely a skeptic and a cynic. This
is proved by his very consistent ad
vocacy of the cause of the common
people," says Professor Guerard.
France's Party Affiliations
He goes on to explain that the sym
pathy which Anatole France held for
the Socialist Party, of which he was a
member, although he was not a Com
munist, was without any self-interest,
for he had no political ambitions. His
connection with the Socialists brought
him no money, but was the cause of
much social embarrassment, and near
ly ruined his life.
"Of course one must remember,"
said Professor Guerard, "that Anatole
France in his political sympathies with
the Socialist party in France, and his
advocacy of their foreign policy during
the War, while he was not in line with
the French conservative group, was
merely expressing the common sense
attitude of the average American."
