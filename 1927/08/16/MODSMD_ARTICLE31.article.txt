That evolution should have no ef
fect on a person's faith in religion and
the church was the main point of the
sermon of the Reverend W. W. Wil
lard given in Memorial Church, Sun
day.
Darwin and his fellows give facts
and not meanings. It depends on one's
faith and religion as to what interpre
tation one gives to these facts. It is
the end that counts, he says. One can
only understand life when one con
siders not from came but
where it is going.
The speaker mentioned the different
attitudes taken toward the Bible, say
ing that whereas some people look on
it as a dead level of events, it is really
a spiritual landscape with elevations
and depressions. "If the fundamental
ists today would live on the mountain
lops of the Bible they wouldn't have
wrangles about minor dogmatic dif
ferences, for we come to the true es
sence of religion where there is unity
in all faiths," declared Willard.
