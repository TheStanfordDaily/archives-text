matters.
Shift of Opinion
The shift of opinion voting, which
is becoming popular today in debating,
will be used. Each member of the

position—for, against, or undecided —

bate is over, he will be asked to state
whether his opinion is different. The
side which causes the most changes
wins. While the vote is being counted,
the meeting will be turned into an
open forum in which the audience is
invited to ask questions of the
speakers.
