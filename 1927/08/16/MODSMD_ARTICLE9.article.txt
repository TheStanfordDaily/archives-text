# INTERNATIONAL CLUB MEMBERS DECIDE TO CONTINUE ACTIVITIES
## Regular Quarter Eating Club Is Intention of Group 
### 
It is the intention of the International
Eating Club, consisting of Americans,
Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Rus
sian, East Indian, and Canadia students,
to extend its newly formed organization
throughout the succeeding quarters. This
lias been made possible because of the
immediate siccess the club has met with
this quarter.
There have been two meetings of the
club within the past week, in which the
question of future organization has been
thoroughly discussed. Although it would
be hardly possible for the club to acquire
its own house for some time to come, the
members have planned to have an eating
club of their own, probably at the Union
or at the Encina Commons. During the
summer quarter their meals have been
served at the Alpha Kappa Lambda house
on Salvatierra street.
Rex Bell, former secretary of the
Stanford Y.M.C.A., has been taking
charge of the organization wor kduring
the summer. The committee for the pro
motion of this club consists of the fol
lowing members: Professor Carl Mahr
of the German department, Leonard Wil
bur, Y. Y. Cheong, Pardee Lowe, David
Finch, Philip Wells, Ernest Wells, and
Stewart Way.
