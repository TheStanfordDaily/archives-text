One look at these superb new Wahl Pens will tell you that it
is no longer necessary to pay more for complete pen satisfaction
They're everything a campus favorite should be: handsome — big—and guaranteed to last.
Choose one of these big, new pens in your favorite color: Mandarin Red, Jade Green, Royal
Blue, Rosewood, Oxidized Silver, Coral or Ebony Black. Seven popular colors, and three
handy styles—long with roller clip, short with ring (for co-eds) or soldier clip.
All are tipped with the famous, easy-running Wahl Signature nib, a sturdy 14k gold point
that's not too stiff nor too flexible—and only $5.00. That's the whole story of the new
Wahl Fountain Pens.
Wahl Pens are world-famous for their writing qualities—easy writing, smooth writing.
The Wahl Comb Feed insures quick starting and an even How of ink at all
times. No scratch, no blot, no effort when you're in a hurry.
