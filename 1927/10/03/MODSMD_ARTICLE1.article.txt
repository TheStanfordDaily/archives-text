# ELIMINATION OF LOWER DIVISION IS NOT CERTAIN
## Abolition Probably Will Be Accomplished by 1934, Dr. Wilbur Says "FRATERNITIES BENEFIT" President Declares Against Subsidizing Elementary Instruction 
### 
Under the plan proposed by Presi
dent Wilbur for the increased limita
tion of the number of students permit
ted to enroll in the Lower Division,
which was approved by the Board of
Trustees last June, no changes will
be made during the college year
1927-28.
When questioned last week concern
ing a definite arrangement for gradu
al restriction of the number of stu
dents to be enrolled in the freshman
and sophomore years in 192 Sand
thereafter, President W T ilbur said no
final provisions had yet been made to
be effective at such future time.
"You are trying to get finality when
there is no finality," President Wil
bur stated.
Decrease Gradual 4
As the enrollment in the upper divi
sion increases and that in the lower
â€¢division decreases, President Wilbur's
recommendations will gradually be
come operative. As the number of
those who register for graduate and
upper division work approaches the
present total of all students, both un
dergraduate and graduate, the quota
of prospective students allowed to
matriculate in the Lower Division will
be diminished year by year as circum
stances warrant.
"We hope to maintain the student
body at about its present level," added
j President Wilbur in speaking of the
total numerical registration to be per
mitted at Stanford under the opera
tion of the plan approved by the Board
of Trustees expressed in the following
terms:
Resolution Passed
"RESOLVED: That the Board of
Trustees approve the recommen
dation of the President of the Uni
versity that there be a further re
duction in the number of students
to be admitted to the Lower Divi
sion of the University.
"AND that the President be au
thorized to carry out this policy at
such rate and to such extent as
may from time to time be author
ized by this Board,
"And that no determination be
made at this time of the question
of the elimination of the Lower
Division at any specific period."
As is apparent from this resolution,
the plan does not provide for the can
cellation of the curricula of the pres
ent freshman and sophomore years;
however, there has been some indirect
consideration of 1934 as the year in
which it might be compatible with the
interests of the University and with
those of prospective students to pro
pose the complete removal of the
Lower Division.
1934 Probable Date
"It seems probable at the present
rate of increase in the number of
junior college students that by the
time the present preferences cease,
January 1, 1934, our Lower Division
work will practically be absorbed by
other institutions." This is a part of
the statement upon which President
Wilbur addressed the Stanford Na
tional Board last April.
When state institutions of junior
college grade become sufficient in
number in the various parts of Cali
fornia and in other states, as is rap
idly becoming the case, according to
figures presented by President Wilbur
and T. T. C. Gregory, trustee. "There
is no good reason," according to Dr.
Wilbur, "why endowment funds given
for a 'university of high degree' should
be used to subsidize elementary in
struction given in many places in the
state when there is such a constant
demand for more funds for the assist
ance of those students who desire ade
quate university training for the pro
fessions and for research."
Junior Colleges Increase
Only eleven of the forty-eight states
have no junior colleges and there are
thirty-one in California alone. In the
United States there are twenty-five
private institutions doing junior col
lege work.
"At the University of Chicago this
year, 800 juniors have been enrolled,
while only 600 freshmen entered,"
President Wilbur continued, empha
sizing the tendency that is apparent
everywhere in America, viz.: that a
relatively greater number comes from
junior colleges to the large universi
ties, and that a relatively lesser num
ber of freshman matriculants enter
these big institutions.
By a slight revision of the eligibility
rules, a revision which might permit
athletes to compete during one year
following that in which they receive
their bachelor's degree, would not
alter the position of Stanford in sports,
if an elimination of the Lower Division
should become effective at some fu
ture date.
"Fraternities Need Not Worry"
Since students would enter Stan
ford as juniors, Mr. Gregory, now a
trustee and formerly Stanford student
and fraternity man, does not believe
that fraternities would be affected un
favorably by an absence of freshmen
and sophomores. He says:
"As to fraternity life, of which many
of. us have pleasant recollections, I
think that the scholastic position will
be helped and much of the criticism
of a too-adolescent control by younger
members will be removed when fra
ternities have men of more maturity
in their actions and in their judgment
Of men whom they take in,"
