# ELIMINATION OF LOWER DIVISION IS NOT CERTAIN
## Abolition Probably Will Be Accomplished by 1934, Dr. Wilbur Says "FRATERNITIES BENEFIT" President Declares Against Subsidizing Elementary Instruction 
### 
Under the plan proposed by Presi
dent Wilbur for the increased limita
tion of the number of students permit
ted to enroll in the Lower Division,
which was approved by the Board of
Trustees last June, no changes will
be made during the college year
1927-28.
When questioned last week concern
ing a definite arrangement for gradu
al restriction of the number of stu
dents to be enrolled in the freshman
and sophomore years in 192 Sand
thereafter, President W T ilbur said no
final provisions had yet been made to
be effective at such future time.
"You are trying to get finality when
there is no finality," President Wil
bur stated.
Decrease Gradual 4
As the enrollment in the upper divi
sion increases and that in the lower
•division decreases, President Wilbur's
recommendations will gradually be
come operative. As the number of
those who register for graduate and
upper division work approaches the
present total of all students, both un
dergraduate and graduate, the quota
of prospective students allowed to
matriculate in the Lower Division will
be diminished year by year as circum
stances warrant.
"We hope to maintain the student
body at about its present level," added
