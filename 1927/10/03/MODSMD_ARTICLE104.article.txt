# MEN TO HAVE USUAL SPRING RUSH PERIOD
## 
### 
Contrary to rumors circulated re
cently, fraternity rushing will take
place spring quarter as it has in the
past, announced Willis Wolf, president
of the Interfraternity Council, last
night.
Although many of the fraternity
men expressed themselves favorable
to a plan allowing fraternities to rush
winter quarter, it was definitely de
cided last year that such a plan
would not be advisable. Wolf placed
the responsibility for the false reports
on those men still striving for the
adoption of such a plan.
