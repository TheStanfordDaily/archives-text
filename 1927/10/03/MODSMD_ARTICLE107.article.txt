WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.—Al Smith's
record during four terms as governor
of New York State is being scrutinized
In the search for campaign material.
His friends intend to emphasize
most strongly that his record as gov
ernor is the best evidence of his :
qualifications for the presidency.
The first attempt to attack Smith's !
record, as governor, has been under- ;
taken by Colonel Theodore Roosevelt. |
His keynote at the New York Repub- ;
lican State Convention is to be circu- j
lated widely and will serve as the i
source material for a good many at- j
tacks.
Roosevelt, in brief, declares tha4!
Smith is so closely allied with Tam- j
many that he cannot escape responsi- |
bility for any of its shortcomings, that !
Smith has managed New York State
extravagantly, running it into debt by
heavy bond issues, that he has not
faithfully practiced the principle of a
nonpartisan judiciary which he advo
cates, and that he has been compla
cent in the face of New York City milk
graft.
