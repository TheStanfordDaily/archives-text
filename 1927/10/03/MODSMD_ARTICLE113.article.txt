# NORTHERN MEMBERS OF P.C.C. ALL WIN IN SATURDAY TILTS
## Huskies Get Double Victory; Montana Gives Vandals Decisive Defeat 
### George Storey 
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 2.— All six
northern members of the Pacific Coast
Conference came through Saturday's
games with victories, and the Huskies
of Washington made their afternoon a
doubly impressive one by winning two
games. As yet none of the northern
teams has been defeated, but some
thing will happen to the hopes of one
or two of the aggregations before an
other week passes.
Perhaps the outstanding showing
Saturday was that of Washington
State, the same team which was re
cently held to a tie by Mt. St. Charles,
a very smail college. Babe Holling
berry's Cougars came to life against
the College of Idaho warriors, who are
regarded as a better team than Mt.
St. Charles, and won easily by a 53
to 0 margin. Next Saturday the Cou
gars play Montana at Pullman in the
opening conference game for both
teams. Montana beat Mt. St. Charles
8 to 0 Saturday, so, according to com
parative scores, is better than W.S.C.,
but the Cougars are favored to win
much as they please.
Oregon Displays Power
Another good display of powers was
made by Captain John J. McEwan's
Oregon eleven, which inundated Pa
cific University under a 32 to 6 score.
The Webfeet defeated Linfield 7 to 0
the week before, and showed nothing
et all while so doing, but against
Pacific the Oregonians worked much
"better, and certainly advanced a long
way in a week. They play Idaho at
Eugene Saturday in a conference
game, and are given a good chance for
•victory, inasmuch as Charley Erb's
Vandals did not seem to be going at
ft very good clip last Saturday when
they beat Montana State 20 to 12.
The California Aggies invaded the
Oregon Aggies' home and were turned
back by a score of 25 to 6. Coach
Schissler of the Oregon boys used 35
men during the matinee, and was quite
"well satisfied with the day's develop
ments. Schissler lost twelve lettermen
from last year's squad, but retained
enough talent to give him a good start
for this season. He has Howard
Maples, quarterback, doing most of
the work in the backfield, and this
speedy young man leaves nothing to
be desired. He was one of the best
backs on the coast last fall, his first
year as a varsity man, and this season
he seems to be going even better.
U S.C. Tough Opponent
Scliissler's squad faces a tough op
ponent Saturday in U.S.C., and a de
feat means that his chances of a con
ference championship are gone. This
game should be a good one, for both
teams play fast and colorful football,
but the weather undoubtedly will han
dicap the northern team, if it is at all
warm in Los Angeles Saturday.
And now we come to Enoch Bag
thaw's Huskies, coast champions in
1925, who are facing one of their hard
est schedules, which includes two trips
"to the South and four other conference
game". Conch Bagshaw started this
season with plenty of veteran linemen,
but no backs, but he has made Pat
Wilson, captain and two-year veteran,
. into a halfback, and with Wilson, a
former tackle, Louis Tesreau and
Chuck Carroll to share the duties be
hind the line the backfield problem,
save for the discovery of a field gen
eral to replace George Guttormsen,
weenis well solved.
Husky Line Poor
But Saturday against the U.S.S.
Idaho and against Willamette Univer
sity the Husky line did not function
as it should. Although the Seattle lads
won both games, the former 27 to 0
and the latter 32 to 6, the line play
•was not as good as hoped for. How
ever, Washington does not have to be
in tip-top shape for two more weeks,
since it has another Navy team and
Montana on its schedule before the
real tests come, and Bagshaw is tak
ing advantage of this fact. He is bring
ing the team along slowly, because it
is not necessary that his men be going
at top speed until October 22, when
they meet Washington State.
To try to pick a probable winner in
the Northwest this early is futile. Al
most every team, with the exception of
Montana, has real possibilities, and
until these aggregations begin to elimi
nate one another no team seems to
have the market cornered.
