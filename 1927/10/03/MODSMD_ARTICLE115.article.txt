# CONCERT SERIES FOR COMING YEAR BOASTS FIVE NOTABLE EVENTS
## 
### 
Carrying out again the policy of
bringing to Stanford the most distin
guished musicians and ensembles ob
tainable, the management of the As
sociated Students Concert Series has
arranged a group of events for the
coming year which promises to be
eminently worth while artistically.
Five artists have been booked for the
season. The events, with dates, have
been arranged as follows: Claudio
Muzio, dramatic soprano of the Chi
cago, La Scala, Paris, and other opera
companies, and a concert singer of
great note, will open the series with
a recital on the evening of Monday,
October 17. Ignaz Friedman, who
ranks, in the opinion of trustworthy
critics, among the greatest living pian
ists, is scheduled for Thursday night,
November 3. On Thursday, February
23, Beniamino Gigli, undoubtedly the
leading tenor since Caruso's death,
will sing.
Fourth Event Unique
The fourth event will present a
group which is unique in music today.
Six capable singers, three men and
three women, calling themselves only
"The English Singers," have been al
most sensationally successful since
their first appearance in concert two
years ago. Grouped simply about a
table, they render their versions of
the authentic old English folk songs
and madrigals.
Dr. Alfred Hertz and his San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra will con
clude the musical season. Their con
cert last year was received with the
utmost enthusiasm.
Improvements in Pavilion
The basketball pavilion will again
be the home of the series. Its acoustic
qualities were thoroughly tested and
found excellent in the five exacting
concerts last year, and this season
r.ew and comfortable seats supplied
by the University will remove the only
serious objections found against the
pavilion last year.
Same Season Rate Retained
There will be no advance in the
price of season tickets, the $3.00 rate
for students and faculty established
for the first series being continued
this year. This brings the price per
concert to the sum of 60 cents. This
is far below the charge made in San
Francisco for even a second- or third
rate balcony seat for the same artists.
The Stanford series last year, accord
ing to reliable sources, was the most
ambitious, in point of financial mag
nitude, and the most representative,
according to student attendance, of
any college artist series in the country
â€”and that in its inaugural year.
Reservations of season tickets may
be made by writing P.O. Box 1151 and
enclosing a check for $3.00. To the
general public living in Palo Alto and
the Peninsula, the season rate will be
$4 on
