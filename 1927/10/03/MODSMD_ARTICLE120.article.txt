# CIANINI WILL RETURN TO TEACH COURSE IN LIGHTING PRINCIPLES
## 
### 
| L. G. Gianni, '20, will return this
I quarter to conduct a course on the
! principles of illumination. His class,
which will be under the electrical en
gineering department, is tentatively
planned for Tuesdays at 10 o'clock,
and will give one unit of credit. It will
be open to any upperclass or graduate
students.
Associated with the Edison Lamp
Works of the General Electric Com
pany since his graduation, Gianni was
engineer at the Oakland factory, and
is now lighting specialist in the San
Francisco branch.
The fundamentals learned in this
course, Gianni states, will enable one
intelligently to apply artificial illumi
nation to any particular problem in
the industry. With these fundamentals
in practice, more efficient production
will result, together with increased
safety, more comfort, less spoilage of
materials, and a minimum of labor
turnover.
This course will be especially adapt
ed to the needs of those who intend
to plan illumination for office or pub
lic buildings, or for those who will
plan municipal street lighting systems.
The lectures and the laboratory work,
however, will be more advanced than
that any central station work can give.
