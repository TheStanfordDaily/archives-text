# U.C. STARTS WORK ON SUN'S DISTANCE
## 
### 
As a preliminary step in the re
checking of the earth's distance from
the sun. Astronomer R. H. Tucker of
the University of California Lick Ob
servatory at Mt. Hamilton has just
completed a careful determination of
the exact positions of 419 stars, which
may be of value In later computations.
According to fellow astronomers,
these determinations of position are
fundamental contributions to astrono
mical science, with particular refer
ence to observations which will be
made in 1930, when the earth will be
approached more closely by the
planetoid Eros than any other solar
body, except the earth's own moon,
ever approaches.
The stars which Astronomer Tucker
has accurately located, he explains,
are in the path which the planetoid
Eros will taken when making its
closest approach to the earth, a mat
ter of some 13,500,000 miles. They will
enable observers to calculate the dis
tance to Eros very exactly and from
that result to determine the distance
to the sun.
