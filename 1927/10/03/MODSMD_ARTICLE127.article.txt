# ELABORATE VARSITY THEATRE OPENS FOR NEW COLLEGE YEAR
## Mission Style Playhouse Offers Best in Style and Equipment 
### 
Stanford theatregoers will be in
terested in the new and elaborate Var
sity Theatre of Palo Alto which was
informally opened to the public on the
night of Tuesday, September 27th. The
new amusement palace is located on
University Avenue between Cowper
and Waverly Streets and is owned
and operated by the chain of Arkush
Peninsula Theatres.
The playhouse, being of the Cali
fornia Mission style of architecture,
was appropriately christened by show
ing a film of early California life and
romance before capacity houses at its
first two performances. Preceding the
picture, Kane's llawaiians, dressed in
the costumes of the early dons, played
a few selections which added to the
Castilian atmosphere.
One enters the theatre through a
beautifully lighted court with a foun
tain in the center playing a steady
stream. The court, with its arched
columns, fountain, and tile flooring,
greatly resembles the Court of the
Alhambra. The interior of the theatre
with its indirect lighting and pastel
colored decorations, is furnished on
the principle that in simplicity is
beauty.
The structure with equipment and
furnishings represents a total invest
ment of one quarter million dollars. It
has been provided with the most mod
ern equipment consisting of improved
projection machines and electrical ap
paratus as well as an electrically con
trolled organ of 475 pipes. The house
has a seating capacity of one thousand
patrons. The fifteen-foot stage was
constructed for the showing of motion
pictures exclusively, no provision hav
ing been made for the legitimate
drama.
The policy of the theatre will be to
charge admittance prices of 50 and 75
cents for the nights of Monday to
Thursday inclusive. Admittance over
the week-ends will be 30 and 50 cents
except when special attractions are
shown.
