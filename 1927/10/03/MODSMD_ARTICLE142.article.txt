# SMALL GIFT BECOMES FINANCIAL PROBLEM FOR HARVARD BOARD
## 
### 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.,—(lP) — Ten
thousand dollars is not much to the
trustees of a university, the total en- !
dowment of which is some seventy
millions. But the financial adminis
trators of Harvard University, never
theless, are losing sleep over a mere
ten thousand.
When the late Professor Charles
Sargent left $10,000 to Harvard he pro
vided that it should be allowed to ac- j
cumulate for one hundred years. It is
then to be divided, the income from }
one-half to be used for the care of
Arnold Arboretum, the other half to
be allowed to accumulate for another
100 years.
What worries the trustees is that
if the ten thousand is invested at four
per cent interest, the principle in 200
years will be but $13,000,000, while, if
it can be invested at six and one-half
per cent, the principle two centuries
hence will amount to some six hun
dred million dollars.
Since it is not easy, according to
New York financiers, to invest a mere
ten thousand at profitable interest, the
Harvard trustees are becoming ner
vous over their charge.
