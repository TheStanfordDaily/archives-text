# STANFORD RANKED FIRST IN TRACK BY "RIG TEN" CRITIC
## Cardinal Men Form Backbone For Albon Holden's All-American 
### 
Stanford's possession of the best col
lege track team in the country, with
the University of Southern California
runner-up, established in the 1.C.-4A.
meet, was confirmed in another quar
ter by the selection of the annual theo
retical Ail-American intercollegiate
team by Albon Holden in the Big Ten
Weekly, organ of the western confer
ence colleges.
Holden, basing his selections on the
year's best competitive records, names
more Stanford men among the year's
leaders than representatives of any
other university.
Six Best Ranked
He ranked the best six men in each
event. Under the usual system of
points in college meets, Stanford
would be credited with 36% points
and the University of Southern Cali
fornia with 20%.
In the high hurdles, Ross Nichols
and Clarence West of Stanford are
placed in second and third places. As
low hurdlers this pair, in reverse
order, was* given honorable mention,
though not placed among the best six.
Emerson Spencer rates third to Phil
lips of Butler and Alderman of Michi
gan State in the 440. "Bud" blew up
from over-training, and failed to show
in the 1.C.-AA., but his time of 47:8 is
far better than has been made for
several years, and was taken into
account by Holden.
McKinnon Placed
Nineteen twenty-seven produced a
great number of fine milers. Alex Mc-
Kinnon, a Stanford sophomore, was
one of the best of these, Holden rating
him as sixth.
"Biff" Hoffman naturally ranks as
king-pin among the shot and discus
men. Hoffman often approached the
fifty-foot mark with the iron ball, and
was a constant menace to "Bud" Hou
ser's discus record. "Taffy" Evans re
ceived honorable mention, though not
included among the leading six.
Forster fitted into fourth position
in the shot-put, while Way and
Fleishhacker came in for honorable
mention. Holden gives considerable
praise to Stanford's quartet of weight
men.
Shipkey Honored
Versatile Ted Shipkey is considered
by Holden to be the fourth best jave
lin man in American colleges today.
Joaquin and Sparling were considered
worthy of special mention, though
falling below the first half-dozen.
Bob King was shoved into second
place by the sustained excellence of
Burg, Chicago. Burg jumped no higher
than King, but was more consistent
than was the Cardinal.
Ward Edmonds is a flashy pole
vaulter, but he went up against the

most phenomenal competition in the
field history, and despite his mark of
thirteen fee: six inches Holden had to
rank him fourth.
Three in Broad Jump
Zombro and Dyer are ranked second
and third in the broad jump, and little
Meeks, whom Holden calls the "third
of the great Stanford stars," receives
only honorable mention in spite of his
24-foot leapn. The broad jump compe
tition of the year is termed "amazing,"
as is that in the pole vault. Hamm of
Georgia Te< h, who almost reached 25
feet, is rani ed first, and Zombro and
Dyer are r; nked ahead of Bates and
Mathias who beat them in the East,
on the scoitj of their season's better
averages.

by Holden to be the fourth best jave
lin man in American colleges today.
Joaquin and Sparling were considered
worthy of special mention, though
falling below the first half-dozen.
Bob King was shoved into second
place by the sustained excellence of
Burg, Chicago. Burg jumped no higher
than King, but was more consistent
than was the Cardinal.
Ward Edmonds is a flashy pole
vaulter, but he went up against the

most phenomenal competition in the
field history, and despite his mark of
thirteen fee: six inches Holden had to
rank him fourth.
Three in Broad Jump
Zombro and Dyer are ranked second
and third in the broad jump, and little
Meeks, whom Holden calls the "third
of the great Stanford stars," receives
only honorable mention in spite of his
24-foot leapn. The broad jump compe
tition of the year is termed "amazing,"
as is that in the pole vault. Hamm of
Georgia Te< h, who almost reached 25
feet, is rani ed first, and Zombro and
Dyer are r; nked ahead of Bates and
Mathias who beat them in the East,
on the scoitj of their season's better
averages.
Stanford's possession of the best col
lege track team in the country, with
the University of Southern California
runner-up, established in the 1.C.-4A.
meet, was confirmed in another quar
ter by the selection of the annual theo
retical Ail-American intercollegiate
team by Albon Holden in the Big Ten
Weekly, organ of the western confer
ence colleges.
Holden, basing his selections on the
year's best competitive records, names
more Stanford men among the year's
leaders than representatives of any
other university.
Six Best Ranked
He ranked the best six men in each
event. Under the usual system of
points in college meets, Stanford
would be credited with 36% points
and the University of Southern Cali
fornia with 20%.
In the high hurdles, Ross Nichols
and Clarence West of Stanford are
placed in second and third places. As
low hurdlers this pair, in reverse
order, was* given honorable mention,
though not placed among the best six.
Emerson Spencer rates third to Phil
lips of Butler and Alderman of Michi
gan State in the 440. "Bud" blew up
from over-training, and failed to show
in the 1.C.-AA., but his time of 47:8 is
far better than has been made for
several years, and was taken into
account by Holden.
McKinnon Placed
Nineteen twenty-seven produced a
great number of fine milers. Alex Mc-
Kinnon, a Stanford sophomore, was
one of the best of these, Holden rating
him as sixth.
"Biff" Hoffman naturally ranks as
king-pin among the shot and discus
men. Hoffman often approached the
fifty-foot mark with the iron ball, and
was a constant menace to "Bud" Hou
ser's discus record. "Taffy" Evans re
ceived honorable mention, though not
included among the leading six.
Forster fitted into fourth position
in the shot-put, while Way and
Fleishhacker came in for honorable
mention. Holden gives considerable
praise to Stanford's quartet of weight
men.
Shipkey Honored
Versatile Ted Shipkey is considered
by Holden to be the fourth best jave
lin man in American colleges today.
