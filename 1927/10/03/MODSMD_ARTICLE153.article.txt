# FORTY-SIX STANFORD MEN TRAIN IN ARMY CAMPS LAST SUMMER
## Pettigrew, Whitmore Put in Charge of Artillery Unit at Presidio 
### 
Forty-six Stanford men got a taste
of martial life last summer in encamp
ments at Camp Lewis, Washington,
and the Presidio Monterey. A field ar
tillery unit composed of 31 members
of the R.O.T.C. was stationed at the
presidio and an ordnance unit of 15
at Lewis.
Captain Moses W. Pettigrew and
Lieutenant Charles S. Whitmore, as
sisted by two officers of the regular
army at Monterey, had charge of the
artillerymen, all but two of whom
were from the University. California
Institute of Technology sent an en
gineers' unit, and the University of
California and Pomona College sent
infantry.
The men were stationed in barracks
vacated by a squadron of the lltli
Cava4ry during the time they were in
camp, June 17 to July 28. The weeks
of training were devoted to mounted
battery drill, reviewing lectures in
artillery firing, practical work with the
plane table in locating the battery,
foot drill, mounted reconnaisance and
recreation. Several barbecues were
held on the 17-mile drive, and an over
night march to Point Lobos made.
A feather in the Stanford unit's cap
was the fact that Alfred Virag, who
has taken all his training with the
artillery, won the rifle manual of arms
in competition with the infantrymen of
the other colleges.
Shooting of enough heavy ammuni
tion to wipe out several villages helped
relieve the routine for the 15 ordnance
men who were stationed at Camp
Lewis for four weeks and at Fort
Casey for two. French 75's, trench
mortars, anti-aircraft guns, seacoast
guns, and 12-inch mortars throwing
one-ton projectiles were made to per
form by the reserve officers. Measure
ments of the muzzle velocity of the
shells, recoil, and of other firing fac
tors were carefully made and ana
lyzed. Each man was given an oppor
tunity to operate a tank at one time
during the training period.
A special trip to Mount Ranier near
Tacoma was made by the unit one
week-end.
