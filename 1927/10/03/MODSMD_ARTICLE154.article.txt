## 
### 
A seismometer station for studying
j earthquakes, the best equipped on the
I Pacific Coast and equal to any any
where, will be constructed at the Uni
versity of California by F. W. Bilger
of Oakland, at a cost of more than
$10,000. The station will be located

j feet long. The top of the chamber in
I which the instruments are to be placed
' will be 50 feet under the present sur
face of the hill and will be 40 feet
i beneath the surface when grading
plans now in prospect are developed.
It is to be so located that it will not
interfere with future building develop
ments on the campus.
