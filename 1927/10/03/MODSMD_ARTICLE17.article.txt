As each senior will have his picture in
the Quad the higher price is asked
to cover the cost of taking the pic
ture.
H. P. Fisher, a well-known San
Francisco photographer, will be on the
campus from October 10 to 20 to take
individual pictures of the Senior Class.
Appointments for them will be made
at the time of purchasing Quad. As
the senior section is one of the first
to be made up, seniors are requested
to buy their Quads early. Fisher took
the senior pictures last year.
