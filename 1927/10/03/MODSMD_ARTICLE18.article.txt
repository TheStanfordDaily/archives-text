# NEW SEROLOGICAL UNIT IS ESTABLISHED ON STANFORD CAMPUS
## Formal Presentation Expected To Be Made Within Ten Days 
### 
The new seismological station, which
has been under construction on the
Latlirop hill under the direction of
the Seismological Society of America,
will soon be completed and ready to
go into operation in the near future,
according to Dr. Bailey Willis, recently
returned from a year's trip around the
world. The committee in charge is ex
pected to make the formal presenta
tion to President Wilbur within a week
ffr ten days, at which time it will be
turfl&d over to the University.
The Stanford Unit Will be the first
of four bay region proposed
for accurate recording of earthquake
locations. The other stations will be
located on Mt. Hamilton, on the Uni
versity of California cafilpÂ»*s, grid a
projected unit in Golden Gate Park,
San Frrtnc/st'o. The four-unit system
was urged by Professor Willis, who
was instrumental in securing funds for
all except the University of California
unit from a group of influential men
in San Francisco. The University of
California station will be the gift of
F. W. Bilger of Oakland, and will be
the most elaborate of the group.
Townley Supervises Work
Professor S. D. Townley, of the
Stanford Mathematics department, has
supervised the work in co-operation
with Dr. Perry Byerly, who is in
charge of the Berkeley seismological
station. The Stanford station is lo
cated in a light-proof, building on a
hill back of the Charles Lathrop resi
dence. This location was chosen so
as to avoid all traffic disturbances and
enable it to stand on piers placed on
bedrock.
The equipment consists of three
Anderson-Wood torsion seismometers
for the recording of the tri-dimension
al phases of earthquake. It records
disturbances by means of a ray of
light thrown on a revolving film. This
ray of light is reflected from a mirror
at the top of a cylinder attached to a
tungsten wire. The slightest move
ment of this wire moves the cylinder
and with it the mirror. This motion is
recorded on the rotating film. A clock
is electrically connected with the
negative so that minutes and hours
are indicated, making it possible for
the observer to know the exact time
of a disturbance.
Four Stations Co-operate
The four stations are to be used in
the triangulation of the earth tremor.
A single station is able to determine
only the distance away and not the
direction. As the speed of the vibra
jtions is known, by mathematical cal
| culations of the hour at which the
! shocks are recorded at the different
| stations, it will be possible to deter
mine the location. A similar system
of triangulation is used in Southern
! California, where stations are located
at Pasadena, Riverside, Santa Barbara,
and La Jolla.
The Stanford unit represents an ex
penditure of approximately $5000. That
at Berkeley will cost nearly double
that amount as it is to be housed
underground and will have some ad
ditional instruments. It, together with
the Mt. Hamilton station, will be in
(he hands of the University of Cali
fornia. The Golden Gate Park station
will be conducted by the California
i Academy of Science.
