# IRISH WITHDRAW FROM CAMPUS WITH VICTORY OVER VARSITY
## Game Affords Hectic Hour For Rooters; Players Receive Injuries FUMBLES PROVE COSTLY Stanford Misses Old Power At Ends; Drives Fail Near Saint Goal 
### MILTON SILVERMAN 
Ted "Spud" Harder, outstanding
Contender for end on the Stanford
varsity, is in the Palo Alto Hos
pital, where he was taken after re
ceiving a double fracture of the
jaw, a hemorrhage of the nose,
and a slight brain concussion in
the St. Mary's game. His condi
tion iy serious, and the Cardinal
coaches have little hope that he
will return to football this yean
The Irish rebellion is over, and St.
Mary's returned to Oakland with a
highly prized 1G to 0 victory over the
Stanford eleven. And there aie those,
among them Coach "Slip" Mad?s aa
and the Stanford rooting section, who
would not be greatly grieved if that
hectic hour is not repeated for another
five years. For the Saint coach saw his
All-Coast center, Bettencourt, given a
beating that he will long remember,
and Kasperowicz, Merrick, and O'Gor
man requiring assistance to leave the
field, while the Card rooters watched
"Spud" Harder carried off to the hos
pital and his teammates make sixteen
fumbles in sixty minutes' play.
Promises Well
In spite of al ltlie "I told you so's,!'
there was something in Stanford's pla\
that promises great football. Frank'
Wilton got off kicks that averaged
close to fifty yards. Vincenti and Me-
Creery consistently broke through the |
Saints' defense to break up a play. But i
the game also proved that Stanford j
has not its old power on the ends, !
that the line was not charging low, j
nor was it following the ball as did
the Saint line.
There might be an excuse for all
the fumbling, especially since the
Cards were treated to an overdose of I
good, hard tackling. Unfortunately,
however, many of the muffs were
made when there was not a tackier j
within two yards. The Gaels not only
recovered well, but seemed to bring
on the breaks by tackling perilously
close to the ball.
Score Early
The Saints scored early in the first
quarter when Bettencourt recovered
a Stanford fumble on the twenty-yard j
line and went over for a touchdown.
Mulcahy converted. After this relapse,
the Cards started out in real earnest
and took the ball up to mid-field,
where they lost it again on another
fumble.
In the second quarter, after a good
deal of messing about, Hicks recov
ered another Stanford fumble and
scampered across the line to make the
score 13-0. Mulcaliy's kick went wide.
Mulcahy kicked off to Wilton, who
took the ball on his eight-yard line
and returned it seventy-two yards.
Two line bucks netted nine yards, and
Hoffman made two more and first
down. A reverse made one yard, but .
Wilton on the same play ran into a |
nest of Saints an dwas thrown for a
two-yard loss. A pass made six inches, j
but on last down Hoffman took the
ball to the three-yard line for first
down.
Team Fails
Then the rooting section broke
down and wept, for Stanford's first
string team was held for four downs.
Merrick and O'Gorman took the ball
for the Saints in the last half and
carried it to the twenty-five yard line, j
where Mulcahy again came to the fore
and sent a place-kick over for three
points more. The scoring for the game |
ended there, and the game itself could \

have stopped without much loss. Only
of interest was another episode at the
goal line when Stanford was again
held for four downs with a few yards
to go. St, Mary's rooters howled for
joy at this point, for Frankian of the
Saints, who had been mixing with Hy
land for about three quarters, got the
last word in the argument by stopping
"Tricky Dick" with the prettiest tackle
of the day.
U.S.C. Now Favored
After the Stanford-Olympic Club
game, which the Cards won 7-6 com
ing from behind in the third quarter,
and the Fresno State melee, which
resulted in a 33-0 victory for the Stan
ford third- and fourth-string team,
backers of the Cardinal were predict
ing an overwhelming smash-up of the
Saints' hopes. Now U.S.C. is doped to
be a heavy favorite over the Cards.
