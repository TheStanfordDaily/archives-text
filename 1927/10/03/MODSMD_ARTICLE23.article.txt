# That Football Game
## 
### 
It was rather disconcerting after all the pre-season publicity given
to the team to see the varsity go down before St. Mary's Saturday in a
tragedy of errors and fumbles. Stanford, taking its first defeat since
1925, was out-fought in practically every department of the game. The
number of fumbles set some kind of a record —we don't know just what
kind but certainly not one of which to be proud.
However, there are certain angles to the game which should be
considered before passing a verdict on the Cardinals. To begin with,
that football game meant more to St. Mary's than it did to Stanford, for
this was the first time since 1922 that St. Mary's had been placed on
Stanford's schedule and the Saints were determined to show that they
merited a date on the card. In keeping with this was "Slip" Madigan's
statement made on the evening before the game. "We are going to give
everything we have against Stanford," said he."It may kill us off for
the rest of the season, but the prize is certainly worth the sacrifice."
H ARU ' bitter tackling was promised by those words. "Spud" Harder,
trying to fill the place held down last year by an All-Coast end, was
the first to suffer from the stiff playing. He certainly deserved the ovation
he got for walking from the field to the ambulance. After Stanford
overcame its surprise, three St. Mary's men were forced out of the game
by injuries. Saturday's affair was no pink tea party.
Some think that the outcome of the game will do the team good. We
question it. Stanford will go into the U.S.C. game in as good shape as
if it had won last Saturday for the ounce of good that might have come
from the defeat was more than balanced by the loss of Harder. The
Cardinals' position now is somewhat analogous to that of California.
While the former lost a game, the latter has been losing men through
injuries. It will be interesting now to hear the outcome of the California
•„iSt. Mary's game next Saturday though the Saints will not be in the
' fettle they were for the Cardinals.
A WORD or two might be said about the quality of the refereeing and
umpiring as displayed in last Saturday's game. The new 1927 rules
may be confusing to the spectators but there is no excuse for officials to
be bewildered several times in the course of the game by some situation
a little out of the ordinary. For all games officials should be well versed
in the rules and capable of ruling on the situation without having to
debate at length on the matter. That's what they're there for.
Conference officials and coaches should insist on as high a standard
of officials for preliminary games as they do for the major clashes of
the season. If the better grade officials receive more pay, well and good;
crowds of 15,000 and 30.000 for early season games pay enough to
cover the additional expense.

everything we have against Stanford," said he."It may kill us off for
the rest of the season, but the prize is certainly worth the sacrifice."
H ARU ' bitter tackling was promised by those words. "Spud" Harder,
trying to fill the place held down last year by an All-Coast end, was
the first to suffer from the stiff playing. He certainly deserved the ovation
he got for walking from the field to the ambulance. After Stanford
overcame its surprise, three St. Mary's men were forced out of the game
by injuries. Saturday's affair was no pink tea party.
Some think that the outcome of the game will do the team good. We
question it. Stanford will go into the U.S.C. game in as good shape as
if it had won last Saturday for the ounce of good that might have come
from the defeat was more than balanced by the loss of Harder. The
Cardinals' position now is somewhat analogous to that of California.
While the former lost a game, the latter has been losing men through
injuries. It will be interesting now to hear the outcome of the California
•„iSt. Mary's game next Saturday though the Saints will not be in the
' fettle they were for the Cardinals.
A WORD or two might be said about the quality of the refereeing and
umpiring as displayed in last Saturday's game. The new 1927 rules
may be confusing to the spectators but there is no excuse for officials to
be bewildered several times in the course of the game by some situation
a little out of the ordinary. For all games officials should be well versed
in the rules and capable of ruling on the situation without having to
debate at length on the matter. That's what they're there for.
Conference officials and coaches should insist on as high a standard
of officials for preliminary games as they do for the major clashes of
the season. If the better grade officials receive more pay, well and good;
crowds of 15,000 and 30.000 for early season games pay enough to
cover the additional expense.
It was rather disconcerting after all the pre-season publicity given
to the team to see the varsity go down before St. Mary's Saturday in a
tragedy of errors and fumbles. Stanford, taking its first defeat since
1925, was out-fought in practically every department of the game. The
number of fumbles set some kind of a record —we don't know just what
kind but certainly not one of which to be proud.
However, there are certain angles to the game which should be
considered before passing a verdict on the Cardinals. To begin with,
that football game meant more to St. Mary's than it did to Stanford, for
this was the first time since 1922 that St. Mary's had been placed on
Stanford's schedule and the Saints were determined to show that they
merited a date on the card. In keeping with this was "Slip" Madigan's
statement made on the evening before the game. "We are going to give
everything we have against Stanford," said he."It may kill us off for
the rest of the season, but the prize is certainly worth the sacrifice."
