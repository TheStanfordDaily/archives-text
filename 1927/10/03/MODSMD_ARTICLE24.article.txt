# The 						Registration Dance Mix-Up
## 
### 
At the last meeting of the Executive Committee in June, Sigma
Delta Chi was granted the Registration Dance date for October 1.
Announcement now has been made that the Rally Committee will give
the dance on October 7. The reason for the change in the date isÂ»
obviously that President Wilbur's reception for new students would
conflict with the dance.
But the reason for the change in the organization sponsoring the
dance is not so obvious. During the summer an Ex Committee vote by
mail was taken at the behest of former Student Manager Bob Lewis on
regranting the date to the Rally Committee. The reason given for this
action was that it was stated as the policy to give this date to that
organization which stood most deservingly in need of whatever funds
might accrue from a Registration Dance. The Rally Committee, it was
held, needed money to properly carry out bleacher stunts during the
coining season. Another organization considered in this mail vote was
the Dramatic Council, which is forced to begin the year with several
debts still hanging over from a couple of years back. It was recom
mended, too, that Sigma Delta Chi should straighten out its financial
affairs.
The rub comes in the fact that neither the Rally Committee nor the
Dramatic Council applied for the date last June though both knew that
they would stand in need of money. Sigma Delta Chi knew that it would
need money and it applied for the dance, received the date, and now
holds the sack.
