# STRONG TEAMS CLAIMED LACKING THROUGHOUT U.S. AS 1927 GRID YEAR OPENS
## 
### 
As the 1927 football season is about
to open, two things of note are ap
parent. The first is that no one sec
tion has a monopoly of strong teams.
The second is that the greatest amount
of interest in intercollegiate football
lies in the midwest.
We must draw these conclusions, of
course, from the past season, and
what change in the situation will be
brought about this year is a matter
only for conjecture.
The East was not outstanding in
1926. Only one strong eastern team
defeated a strong eleven from any
other section, Carnegie Tech gaining
fame by destroying the aspirations of
the strong Notre Dame crowd. And
Carnegie is just about as much mid
western as it is eastern. If the Navy
is to be classed as eastern, then we
must add another victory for the East.
Stanford-Alabama Tie
The Midwest, South, and Pacific
leagues stood about on equal ground.
Notre Dame took over Southern Cali
fornia by but one point, while Ala
bama and Stanford tied in the New
Years game.
Without any doubt the Big Ten, of
the Midwest, is the most popular and
best supported group of gridders. The
former popularity of the East was
doomed the minute Yale and Harvard
and Princeton began playing poor
football. Should the strong eastern
schools establish a good conference,
that dead interest might easily be re
vived, for football fans want sectional
championships, and undisputed cham
pionships can be had only where a
conference exists.
Were it not so far from the center
of population, the Pacific league cer
tainly would give the Big Ten a run
for its money in popular opinion, for
there is no doubt that some of the
strongest teams ever turned out play
along the western coast.
The South, too, has a number of
formidable elevens, but they are too
loosely organized to furnish newspaper

material such as is supplied by the
Big Ten.
More Radio News
But we may expect that the in
creased use of the radio for broadcast
ing football games will bring all sec
tions closer together, and in the very
near future we may expect to find a
very great increase in the number of
inter-sectional football games played.
When that time comes, national cham
pionships will be much more easily
determined. It is not possible to say
which team was the best in the coun
try last year.
It is too early to predict champion
ships in any section. Michigan, North
western, Purdue, Minnesota, Illinois,
Ohio State â€”any one may take the Big
Ten.
In the East there probably will be
outstanding the Army, Navy, Brown,
New York IT., Lafayette, and Carnegie.
Alabama and Tennessee were the
only Southern Conference boasts last
year, and Alabama seems to have a
tradition which it is going to be diffi
cult to break.
Coast Is Strong
Probably one of the strongest con
tests, as usual, will take place on the
coast where Stanford, Southern Cali
fornia, the Oregon Aggies, and Wash
ington State will attempt to keep the
other hefty squads from climbing over
them.
Tradition and a number of good
teams have helped to make the New
England outlay one of the strongest of
the lesser combinations. In that sec
tion Brown, by virtue of last year's
clean slate, will be watched with in
terest, while Amherst, Williams, Dart
mouth, and Holy Cross will make it
hot for descending Yale and Harvard.
The Oklahoma Aggies and Nebraska
very likely will fight it out for the
top place in the Missouri Valley com
bination, while Ohio Wesleyan and
Oberlin, accredited the strongest
teams in the Ohio conference, will
wage a battle for supermacy in that
hardy organization.
