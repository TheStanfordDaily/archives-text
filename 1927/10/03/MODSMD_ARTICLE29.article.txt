# WOMEN IMPROVE AS LABORATORY HELPERS INVESTIGATION SHOWS
## 
### 
"Women are being looked upon with
increasing favor because of their sta
bility and accuracy in scientific labora
tories," declares Richard H. Behrens
in a bulletin published recently at the
University of California by the Divi
sion of Vocational Education.
As long as labor is expensive and
American resources are decreasing
there will be an increasing demand
for the skilled chemical laboratory
worker, Behren believes.
"The many opportunities open for
the young man or woman in this field
depend largely upon personal qualifi
cations of character and ability. Given
certain aptitudes in mechanics, the op
portunities to become head of a fac
tory or plant are facilitated for the
chemist who goes out from the labora
tory."
Behrens thinks the medical labora
tories and various departments of the
government also offer excellent open
ings.
