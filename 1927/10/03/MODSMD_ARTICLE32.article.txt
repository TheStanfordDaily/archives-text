# CABBAGES and THINGS

Today you stopped a man
To say, "Hello."
You asked if his summer
Had been wild or tame.
How embarrassing it was
To find
You couldn't call his name!

Lay down your ninety-six
The first week at Stanford —
And the summer roll is "nix."

The Old Line
"Now all you Frosh should immedi
ately sign up to take the (Name of a
San Francisco daily) because it will
be a great aid in your Citizenship
course."
This is why the Daily started U.P.
service—to safe freshmen money.

Battle Sonnet
The substitute upon the bench is
parked,
He sees the tide of battle eb and flow
And other men into the struggle go
While he sits out, a man unfit and
marked.
Things aren't so good; the coach with
little joy
Peers 'round to see what fodder there
is left
To stop the slaughter, but of men
bereft
He sees the tide of battle ebb and flow
our boy,
Who grabs the headgear of some other
mutt
Then wildly rushes to get in the fray;
Breaks up a badly-executed play
And lays a rival low —a fine thing, but
The next play ten men plough straight
through at guard
And grind our hero's gizzard in the
sward.

"Cabbages and Things" will conduct
a "My Roommate Said" feature in the
"near future." Remember all the cute
things your lil* roommate says and
mail 'em to Note —"Mem-
bers of the Daily Staff and their Fami
lies" will not be allowed to compete
for "prizes."

TOYON HALL
(As seen by a Soph)
Heaven must have
Some swell "dorms"—
With lots of drawer space,
Closets, steam heat,
Walls without cracks,
Desks that are desks
And not relief maps
With initialed craters
And knife-marked valleys
All over the tops.
I am living in Heaven now
But I have had
My share of Hell
Doesn't every Frosh have
To live in Encina!
