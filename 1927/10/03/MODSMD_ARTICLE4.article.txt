# A 						SEVEN YEARS' PROMISE REDEEMED
## 
### 
Seven years ago Earl Crowe, '21, editor of the Daily Palo Alto, as
The Stanford Daily was then known, made this statement in his
editorial column, "The United Press service has been canceled and will
not be renewed until the financial condition warrants it." Conditions
now permit the use of such service for the present year and so it is that
the Daily offers to its readers telegraph news of world and national
events.
United Press news was first carried in the Daily in May 1920. Its
use continued until December of that year when in a general student
body election a measure was defeated which had been intended to
provide the Daily with further funds for the continuance of the service.
Conditions now, however, are such that the Daily feels that it can
provide the students with this service once more.
