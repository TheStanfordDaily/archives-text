# THREE CARDINAL NET STARS WIN PLACES IN COLLEGIATE RANKINGS
## Herrington, McElvenny Given Fourth in Doubles, Ogden Seventh in Singles 
### 
• With three members of its four-man
tennis team ranked in the first ten
national intercollegiate players, Stan
ford leads all other colleges in the
country for team strength. Cranston
Holman, runner-up in 1925 and 1926
to Champion Edward G. Chandler,
was the only Cardinal not awarded a
rating this season. In singles Alan
Herrington rated fifth, Lionel Ogden
seventh, and Ralph McElvenny eighth.
In the doubles Herrington and McEl
venny ranked fourth, with Holman
and Ogden, Stanford's first doubles
team, not placed.
The basis for the ratings was the
brand of tennis shown during the
i week of the collegiate tournament,
June 24-30. Holman, Cardinal captain,
was in poor form, and although the
big favorite to win the title twice de
nied him, he fell in straight sets be
fore the steady, soft play of Whitbeck
I of Harvard in the quarter finals. Her
[ rington earned his place by a fine
performance against Van Ryn, cham
pion of Princeton. Van Ryn topped all
! eastern college players in earlier tour
| naments and was the one hope of the
East for the championship honors.
Herrington captured the first set and
j was leading with the advantage game
in the second set. Van Ryn braced,
fought back the impending defeat, and
coasted through the vital third set to
win. Ogden and McElvenny both were
victims to their old rival Benjamin S.
I Gorchakoff of Occidental College, Los
Angeles. McElvenny went out in the
quarter finals and Ogden in the round
! preceding.
Doubles Team Loses
In the doubles, Holman and Ogden
j lost early to Kline and Kline of St.
i Saviour. Whitbeck and Gorchakoff, re
| spectively, ran the Stanford players
