# THREE CARDINAL NET STARS WIN PLACES IN COLLEGIATE RANKINGS
## Herrington, McElvenny Given Fourth in Doubles, Ogden Seventh in Singles 
### 
• With three members of its four-man
tennis team ranked in the first ten
national intercollegiate players, Stan
ford leads all other colleges in the
country for team strength. Cranston
Holman, runner-up in 1925 and 1926
to Champion Edward G. Chandler,
was the only Cardinal not awarded a
rating this season. In singles Alan
Herrington rated fifth, Lionel Ogden
seventh, and Ralph McElvenny eighth.
In the doubles Herrington and McEl
venny ranked fourth, with Holman
and Ogden, Stanford's first doubles
team, not placed.
The basis for the ratings was the
brand of tennis shown during the
i week of the collegiate tournament,
June 24-30. Holman, Cardinal captain,
was in poor form, and although the
big favorite to win the title twice de
nied him, he fell in straight sets be
fore the steady, soft play of Whitbeck
I of Harvard in the quarter finals. Her
[ rington earned his place by a fine
performance against Van Ryn, cham
pion of Princeton. Van Ryn topped all
! eastern college players in earlier tour
| naments and was the one hope of the
East for the championship honors.
Herrington captured the first set and
j was leading with the advantage game
in the second set. Van Ryn braced,
fought back the impending defeat, and
coasted through the vital third set to
win. Ogden and McElvenny both were
victims to their old rival Benjamin S.
I Gorchakoff of Occidental College, Los
Angeles. McElvenny went out in the
quarter finals and Ogden in the round
! preceding.
Doubles Team Loses
In the doubles, Holman and Ogden
j lost early to Kline and Kline of St.
i Saviour. Whitbeck and Gorchakoff, re
| spectively, ran the Stanford players
all over the court in singles matches,
so the Kline brothers made excellent
use of their advantage, badgering
their tired opponents with alternate
lobs and dinks. McElvenny and lier
rington passed out at the rackets of
Gorchakoff and Craig, Occidental Col
lege, in a match long and tough but
ending as the other two encounters
between the same teams.
After the intercollegiates, the team
played at the Philadelphia Cricket
Club, thence going successively to
Providence, Longwood, Bay Ridge,
Seabright, Southampton, and New
port.
Longwood Successful
Longwood was the most successful
tournament for the team as a whole.
Holman played his first real tennis of
the season. Not seeded among eight, in
straight days he eliminated Van Ryn
in five sets, and Lewis White and Ar
nold Jones each in four sets, losing
only in the finals to the mighty serv
ing of John Doeg, a freshman at Stan
ford this quarter. Herrington and Mc-
Elvenny, improved over their grass
court form, gave Van Ryn and Appel,
Princeton, intercollegiate champions,
a good beating in three sets and later
in the afternoon carried White and
Thalheimer, third ranking national
team, to the extra set limit.
Holman and Ogden both graduated
in the spring, leaving Herrington, Mc-
Elvenny, and John Wheatley remain
ing from the 1927 varsity.

Herrington rated fifth, Lionel Ogden
seventh, and Ralph McElvenny eighth.
In the doubles Herrington and McEl
venny ranked fourth, with Holman
and Ogden, Stanford's first doubles
team, not placed.
The basis for the ratings was the
brand of tennis shown during the
i week of the collegiate tournament,
June 24-30. Holman, Cardinal captain,
was in poor form, and although the
big favorite to win the title twice de
nied him, he fell in straight sets be
fore the steady, soft play of Whitbeck
I of Harvard in the quarter finals. Her
[ rington earned his place by a fine
performance against Van Ryn, cham
pion of Princeton. Van Ryn topped all
! eastern college players in earlier tour
| naments and was the one hope of the
East for the championship honors.
Herrington captured the first set and
j was leading with the advantage game
in the second set. Van Ryn braced,
fought back the impending defeat, and
coasted through the vital third set to
win. Ogden and McElvenny both were
victims to their old rival Benjamin S.
I Gorchakoff of Occidental College, Los
Angeles. McElvenny went out in the
quarter finals and Ogden in the round
! preceding.
Doubles Team Loses
In the doubles, Holman and Ogden
j lost early to Kline and Kline of St.
i Saviour. Whitbeck and Gorchakoff, re
| spectively, ran the Stanford players
all over the court in singles matches,
so the Kline brothers made excellent
use of their advantage, badgering
their tired opponents with alternate
lobs and dinks. McElvenny and lier
rington passed out at the rackets of
Gorchakoff and Craig, Occidental Col
lege, in a match long and tough but
ending as the other two encounters
between the same teams.
After the intercollegiates, the team
played at the Philadelphia Cricket
Club, thence going successively to
Providence, Longwood, Bay Ridge,
Seabright, Southampton, and New
port.
Longwood Successful
Longwood was the most successful
tournament for the team as a whole.
Holman played his first real tennis of
the season. Not seeded among eight, in
straight days he eliminated Van Ryn
in five sets, and Lewis White and Ar
nold Jones each in four sets, losing
only in the finals to the mighty serv
ing of John Doeg, a freshman at Stan
ford this quarter. Herrington and Mc-
Elvenny, improved over their grass
court form, gave Van Ryn and Appel,
Princeton, intercollegiate champions,
a good beating in three sets and later
in the afternoon carried White and
Thalheimer, third ranking national
team, to the extra set limit.
Holman and Ogden both graduated
in the spring, leaving Herrington, Mc-
Elvenny, and John Wheatley remain
ing from the 1927 varsity.
