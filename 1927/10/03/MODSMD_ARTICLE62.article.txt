# Former Stanford Editor Heads Reorganized Paper
## 
### 
O. C. Leiter, '99, has been made
editor and publisher of the Portland,
Oregon, Telegram, following the pur
chase of the paper by a group of Port
land men after it had been declared
bankrupt. Leiter will hold this posi
tion pending formation of a corpora
tion including employees of the paper,
which will take over control. At Stan
ford he was editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, now the Stanford Daily, in his
senior year.
