# SPECIMENS OF INDIAN POTTERY BROUGHT TO STANFORD BY LEMOS
## American Research Museum Takes Steps to Better Art Work Standard 
### 
Pedro Lemos, director of the Stan-
Ford Museum and Art Gallery, returned
recently from a three weeks' trip to
the Indian pueblos of New Mexico,
bringing 100 pieces of Indian pottery,
nearly 2000 feet of motion pictures,
and many photographs characteristic
of Indian life.
The purpose of Lemos' trip was to
investigate the progress and condition
of the Indian handicrafts, particularly
pottery, silver smithing, blanket and
rug weaving, and bead work and em
broidery.
Arts Dying Out
"Because these Indian arts have
been dying out in recent years," says
Lemos, "steps are now being taken
by the Museum of American Research
in Santa Fe to create better markets
and better standards of Indian handi
crafts among the pueblos."
Lemos has long been interested in
these plans and declares that they
are now of practical import. The gov
ernment teachers who are located in
each pueblo are helping some of the
old members of the tribes instruct the
children in the Indian arts.
"There never has been any finer pot
tery made in America than that of
the Indians," says Lemos. "It is the
only true American handicraft, since
all other pottery made here is pat
terned after Oriental or European
types, the Indians' work being abso
lutely original.
Students of Indian work can tell by
the color and decoration plans from
"what pueblo pottery comes. Each bit
of decoration on a piece of Indian
pottery has a meaning, and each com
plete decoration tells a story or offers
up a prayer to some ancient idol.
Visits Pueblos
While in New Mexico, Lemos visited
three of the largest pueblos: Acoma,
.Zuni, and Taos. The former is an In
dian city situated on a mesa 300 feet
â€¢above the surrounding desert. It was
the first city in the new world to be
conquered by the Spaniards, and it is
the most southern of all the pueblos.
The Indians who inhabit Acoma are
the most primitive and backward in
America.
Zuni is one of the fabled old Seven
Cities of Cibola, and, according to
Lemos, the pottery being made there
today is made in exactly the same j
manner as it was when the Spaniards i
came.
Taos is the most northern of the |
pueblos and the most generally known
by Americans because of the artists'
colony which is located there.
Lemos has aided nationally in spon
soring the American Research move
ment in Zuni and it was from the
teacher of the Zuni school, Leo F.
Walker, that he received most of the
pottery. Lemos hopes within three
years to have instituted the teaching
in the Laguna pueblo as well.
Gets Pictures
In some of the pueblos Lemos had
a great deal of trouble securing pic
tures and had to take great care that
the Indians did not injure the camera.
At one place, after he had paid five
dollars for the privilege of taking pic
tures, the Indians conveniently
changed their minds and decided that
they would not allow him to do so.
Lemos, however, placed his motion
picture camera in a box with a false
bottom, cut a hole in the box, and
walked through the streets taking pic
tures in perfect safety. In the top of
the box he placed candies to give to
the native children.
During the spring months Lemos
plans to have an exhibition of Indian
handicrafts in the art gallery and
hopes to arrange for an Indian pro
gram with artists from the New Mexi
can pueblos.
With him on the trip were Mrs.
Lemos and Mr. and Mrs. Garfield Mer
ner of Hillsborough.
