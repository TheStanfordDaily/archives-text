# WOMEN TEACHERS OF HIGH SCHOOL BOYS IS INNOVATIONâ€”WYATT

### 
"The instruction of boys of high
school age by women teachers is a
peculiarity of education in the United
States," according to Professor H.
Wyatt, who has recently been added
to the faculty of the Education De
partment of the U.C. campus. "In
India, especially, where I have been
working for the past 18 years, boys
are trained by men. In America there
are so many directions in which a
young man can expend his energy that
the education of the very young is
undertaken largely by women."
Professor Wyatt was principal of
the Lahore Training College, India,
for many years. This is the largest
college in the north "of India- in wlifch
young men are trained to teach in
the secondary grades.
"Indian students, on the whole, are
probably no more brilliant and no less
so than students the world over. The
Indian students who come to Ameri
can universities are, as a rule, a se
lected group and are usually older
than the average college student."
Compulsory education has been
spreading recently in India, but is now
effective only in a few localities, ac
cording to Professor Wyatt. There is
a strong prejudice against the edu
cation of women, even among the wo
men themselves. The problem is fur
ther complicated by the difficulty of
finding suitable women teachers for
the girl students.,
Professor Wyatt has written several
books for use in Oriental schools, one
of which, "The Teaching of English
in India," is the accepted textbook on
the subject in India and Japan.
Of the many interesting problems
connected with his work which are
discussed in this volume is the ex
planation of the English idiom. One
exercise distinguishes for the student
the different uses of such expressions
as "to make up," "to make up to," and
"make for." Another passage com
ments on the tendency to stammer
found among Indian students of the
English language and suggests reme
dies for this condition. Different meth
ods of giving the student a real ap
preciation of English literature are
suggested by Professor Wyatt.
