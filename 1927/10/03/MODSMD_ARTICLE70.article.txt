"Yes, the outlook for another cham
pionship swimming team this year is
very bright," said Ernie Brandsten,
swimming coach, in regard to the pros
pects for the coming year.
With Krytie Van den Akker, Reggie
Harrison, and Bob Harris as a good
combination in the sprints, and Ogden
Driggs, Alan Kinkead, and Hadley
Bramel grouped as distance men,
Brandsten does not expect to feel the
loss of Wally O'Connor, Carl Steven
son, and A1 Christensen, who formed
the nucleus of last year's team.
In the breaststroke Clarence West,
Ernst Ophuls, Carl Conradi, and War
ren Littlefield are expected to do good
work.
The only weak point at present
seems to be the absence of a good
backstroke man. Brandsten, however,
expects to develop a champion to fill
this need.
Walter Mills, Ed Throndson, and
Ted Smith are expected to take care
of the diving end with ease.
"And as all of these fellows can play
expert water polo, I expect that Stan
ford shall again shine in this sport,"
concluded Brandsten.
