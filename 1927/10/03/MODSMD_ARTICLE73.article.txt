# Denies Rumors Of Flying Field For University; Palo Alto Plans Airport Site Near Polo Grounds
## 
### 
"There is no contemplated aviation
field fop the University nor will in
struction in flying be given, but the
City of Palo Alto is in the process of
negotiating for the leasing of a tract
of land along the highway, south of
the campus polo field," said Everett
P. Lesley, professor of aeronautics.
"And if they secure this land, it should
be a very good airport for the City
of Palo Alto." This statement is to
correct rumors broadcasted during the
summer that Stanford Was to have an
airport.
Research and instruction in aero
nautics is the purpose for which the
Guggenheim Foundation has placed
funds at the disposal of the Univer
sity, according to Professor Lesley.
Money for the alteration of a building
to make it suitable for aeronautical
experimentation and funds for addi
tional equipment and for operating
expenses for a period of about ten
years, have been contributed by this
Foundation.
Give Courses This Quarter
Since the aeronautics laboratory is
practically completed, courses will be
given by Professors E. P. Lesley, Al
fred S. Niles, and Elliot G. Reid, dur
ing the present quarter.
Professors Niles and Reid will have
charge of courses here for the first
time this quarter. Professor Niles
comes to Stanford from McCook Field,

I Dayton, 0., where he served as chief
| of the structural branch of the engi
! neering division of the United States
Army Air Service, while Professor
j Reid was employed formerly as aero
j nautic engineer at Langley Memorial
! Laboratory, Langley Field, Virginia, a
laboratory maintained by the National
! Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.
Lesley to Experiment
Courses in structure and stress
analysis and theoretical aerodynamics
will be given by these men, while Pro
fessor Lesley will be engaged in ex
perimental laboratory work.
W. F. Durand, professor emeritus of
mechanical engineering, who is at
present in Europe, will act in a con
sulting and advisory capacity in the
department of aeronautics.
"During the summer a propeller
dynometer has been built for testing
of model propellers and windmills.
Only the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology has a similar piece of ap
paratus. Balance beams for a six com
ponent wire balance will be installed
within the coming month.
"A program of research has been
laid out, including an investigation of
metal variable pitch propellers, the
operation of propellers in closed chan
nels, and the effect of removal of the
boundary layer from air foils at high
angles of attack," Professor Lesley
stated.
