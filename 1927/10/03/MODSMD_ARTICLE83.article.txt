# NEED OF CO-OPERATION BETWEEN SCIENTISTS AND PRESS ANALYZED
## Professor Urges Regulation of Popular Scientific Publishing 
### 
Making an attempt to meet news
papers half way in reaching some plan
for co-operation between the press and
scientists in general, Dr. W. E. Allen,
Assistant Professor of Biology at
Scripps Institution of Oceanography of
the University of California, has just
completed an analysis of the situation.
First of all, Professor Allen says,
palpable monstrosities in the way of
popular science writings should be an
swered by vigorous protests; and, on
the other hand, careful handling of
scientific material by any publication
should be given definite commenda
tion, as a stimulus to editors striving
for a high standard of accuracy.
Third, scientific organizations should
prepare lists of projects upon which
they are engaged for the information
of editors, in order that sufficient time
will be allowed for the preparation of
an adequate announcement when the
work is completed.
Fourth, men equipped with scientific
training and writing ability should be
encouraged to devote time to popular
explanation of technical work having
general interest.
Fifth, a list of reliable writers on
scientific subjects should be prepared
to aid editors in discriminating be
tween those worth while and those of
questionable ability.
Sixth, publishers of large papers,
and certainly news syndicates, should
keep some dependable scientific man
on the editorial staff as a consultant.
Seventh, scientific men and news
paper publishers should create a joint
organization for controlling the dis
tribution of scientific material, perhaps
a syndicated service more or less
like that of Science Service.
