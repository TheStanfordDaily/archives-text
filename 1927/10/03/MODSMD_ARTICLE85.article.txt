# U.C.L.A. REPORT SHOWS HIGH GRADE AVERAGES DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2. â€” Only a
university student of extraordinary
caliber can hope to attain even sec
ondary academic honors, it appears
from a comprehensive study just com
pleted by Dr. Marvin L. Darsie, Dean
of the Teachers College of the Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles.
The study shows that students en
rolled in U.C.L.A. must study well and
earnestly to obtain passing grades and
must exhibit a great deal of talent to
get much above the mere level abso
lutely required for a degree.
The survey deals with the grades of
410 seniors in the College of Letters
and Science and the Teachers College
at U.C.L.A. who were candidates for
degrees in January and June of 1927.
Facts developed disclosed that stu
dents enrolled in the College of Let
ters and Science are somewhat better
scholastically than those students who
had chosen teaching as their profes
sion.
In the University at Los Angeles as
a whole, Dr. Darsie's report showed,
less than ten per cent of those quali
fying for degrees attain a scholastic
Index of 2 or more, or a B average.
A B average, therefore, represents not
merely a strong but an extraordinary
achievement, he concludes.
