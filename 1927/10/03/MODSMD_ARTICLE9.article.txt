# STADIUM ADDITION WILL SEAT 16,500 MORE SPECTATORS
## New Structure Stuccoed to Present Appearance of Solid Concrete 
### 
Eighty-seven thousand people will
be in the stands next month when the
Cardinals face the Golden Bear in their
annual Big Game to be held this year
in the Stanford stadium upon which a
large crew has been working; since last
July, constructing additional seating
space. Approximately $160,000 has
been expended for the work.
The new part consists of fourteen
rows of seats which were built on up
from the old stadium. About 16,500
additional spectators will be accom
modated.
Outside Stuccoed
The outside of the structure is being
stuccoed, and gives the appearance of
being solid concrete in construction. It
is made in a series of arcades through
which stairs are built leading to the
interior.
Those in charge of the work say
that in all probability the stadium will
be ready for complete occupancy in
time for the Stanford-U.S.C. game on
October 15, but much depends on
weather conditions, so nothing is defi
nitely promised until the Card-U.C.
clash. Officials say, however, that work
on the stands will in no way inter
fere with those attending the contests
previous to its completion.
All Seats Painted
The new seats and the old ones will
receive a coat of paint in the near
future so that there will be no color
distinction between the old part and
the addition. The shade has not yet
been decided.
The scoreboards at each end of the
stadium have been raised almost to
the top of the new rim, so as to cut
off only a few of the additional seats.
New turf was grown on the field and
is now in splendid shape. It is of Ber
muda grass which was planted under
a thick layer of sand so that the field
has a springy quality. The goal posts
at each end of the field have been
moved back in compliance with tlie
new football rules.
