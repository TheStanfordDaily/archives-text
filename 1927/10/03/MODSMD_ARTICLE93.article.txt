# SCHMIEDER PRAISES GERMANY'S PROGRESS IN AVIATION SYSTEM
## 
### 
The United States is backward in
the development of commercial avia
tion for carrying passengers, in com
parison with the network of air lines
maintained by Germany, reports Dr.
| Oscar Schmieder, Associate Professor
of Geography at the University of Cali
fornia, who has just returned from a
summer visit to Germany.
"The companies are making money,"
Schmieder declares. He further states
that passenger rates on air lines are
lower than first-class railroad fares.
Speedy service and the elimination of
change from boat to train he cites as
other advantages.
German passenger aircraft he de
scribes as having palatial compart
ments for passengers. The planes also
have considerable traffic in perishable
goods, Schmieder added, including
prize dogs and other animals.
There is now a network of air lanes
comparable to railroad lines, he point
ed out. Even the most remote cities
and many small towns have airports
and are given regular daily service.
