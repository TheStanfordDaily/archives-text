# FRESHMAN OPPONENTS PROVE YEARLINGS' MATCH IN TIE GAME
## Babes, Victors Over Army, Meet Opposition in San Mateo Contest 
### Bob Speers 
After getting off to a flying start a
week ago by beating the 250t1i Coast
Artillery 19 to 6, Coach Husky Hunt's
freshmen found going considerably
tougher Saturday against the San
Mateo Junior College eleven, which
held the yearlings to a scoreless tie
preliminary to the Stanford-St. Mary's
clash.
The Freshman-Army game was a
typically early season affair with
plenty of loose playing, but it gave
Coach Hunt a chance to try his
charges under fire, and to test his
backlleld combinations.
Offensive Play Ragged
The first-year men, with only a
week's experience under the Warner
System, were ragged in their offensive
play, but put up a determined de
fensive game against which the sol
diers had difficulty making headway.
Frequent offsides slowed up the con
test, and cost the Stanford eleven
some valuable yardage. In the first
period, Moffit executed a beautiful 80-
yard dash for a touchdown, but the
score was not allowed because of hold
ing on the part of one of his ardent
teammates.
Hunt kept a steady stream of sub
stitutes going onto the field; so most
of his men had a chance to show their
wares. The changing lineup probably
caused the boys to look a little more
ragged than they really were.
Backfield Strong
The game showed that the 1931
squad has several strong backfield
players. Moffit at half did some par
ticularly spectacular work, and looks
good. Dawson and Hillman are two
powerful fullbacks whose work was
promising. Moffit is from Los Angeles
High, Dawson hails from Menlo, and
Hillman played at Hollywood High
School. Winneck, of San Diego, and
Saunders, of Lowell High, are the
leading quarterback contenders. Other
good halves are Cook, of Los Angeles,
Harper, of Bakersfield, Caglieri, from
Lowell, and Barks, of Monrovia.
The Stanford line did not show up
as well as the backs. Whether it is
because the material is not as good or
because the boys simply haven't got
together remains to be seen.
Bogue Family Again
Tampeke, of Galileo, at tackle, and
Bogue, of San Mateo, another tackle,
have been the best looking linesmen
so far. Bogue is a brother of the well
known George Bogue of Stanford
gridiron fame. Pike, from Harvard
Military Academy, Mears, of Holly
wood, and Bryan, of Fullerton, are
leading contenders for the end jobs.
Heisner of Los Angeles Poly, and
Dohrman, of Stockton, look good at
guard. A promising trio of centers is
Albertson, of Los Angeles Poly, Mason,
of Modesto, and Green, of Los Angeles.
The freshmen seemed to be a differ
ent outfit against San Mateo, but did
not shine so brightly in the matter of
score because the collegians were vast
ly superior to the service men of the
week previous.
Lengthy Gains Made
On many of their offensive plays
the yearlings were pretty to watch.
They showed unexpected power in
bucking the ball long distances. Twice
they seriously threatened their op
ponents. Once the chance was lost
because of penalties, and once the
San Mateans held the Redshirts for
downs.
The outstanding player of the foray
was Ward, visiting quarterback, who
made himself hard to catch. He flitted
around ends, and back with punts
with dazzling speed and elusiveness.
San Mateo showed some flashes of
dangerous football, and were at all
times capable of making the yearlings
work, but the latter had the edge when
the contest stopped at the end of the
third quarter to clear the field for the
varsity game.
