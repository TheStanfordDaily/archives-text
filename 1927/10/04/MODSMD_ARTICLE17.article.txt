# OPPOSE REVISION

WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.â€”Strong
representations against revision of the
United States-Cuban Reciprocity

Treaty were made to the U.S. Cham
ber of Commerce by representatives
of American domestic can and beet
sugar interests today. The domestic
sugar men allege that revision of the
treaty which is advocated by the
American Chamber of Commerce at
Havana would be an untimely blow
at an important agriculture industry
now operating with very small margin
of profit.
