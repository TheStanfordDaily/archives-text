# Increased Service

VESTERDAY'S issue of the Daily saw the first renewal of wire
service from the United Press Association in this paper since 1920.
The management of the Daily felt that by introducing world news once
more the newspaper would serve its readers in a more complete fashion.
By this step it now joins the ranks of the larger college papers which are
giving students more than the limited news of their own institutions.
Among these papers are The Daily Californian, The Cornell Daily Sun,
The Daily lowan, The Oregon Emerald, and many others.
From the mass of material which comes in over the United Press
wires, the Daily will select those subjects which will be of the most
interest and use to both students and professors. In short, it is hoped to
carry each day a summary of the most significant events in world and
national affairs. That the average college student does not keep himself
well informed on these matters is a fact upon which educators have
commented time and again. The Daily is now doing its part to remedy
this situation.
pRESIDENT WILBUR has commented favorably 011 the plan, ex
pressing the hope that the students would make the utmost use of the
news service. Murray Draper, President of the A.S.S.U., said of the
proposal, "The idea of a wire service for the Daily is a mighty good
one. I've felt that its lack has been the big weakness of the Daily in
the past." Several past editors of the paper have also added their ap
provals of the plan.
Besides this wire service, the Daily carries full news service of the
Pacific Intercollegiate Press Association and of the Intercollegiate Press.
Through these mediums news of other colleges which would not come
over U.P. wires is accessible. In a recent survey of Stanford students it
was found that approximately SO per cent of the hundred questioned
expressed the desire lor more news from other colleges. Acting on this,
the Daily has made available for its readers both of these services.
For the present the wire news will be grouped under the three-column
caption on the front page reading "NEWS OF THE WORLD BY
WIRE." Two or three galleys of the selected news will be run in this
way each day after being edited and copy-read by Gale Wallace, who
will have charge of this department. In the near future several of the
more important stories that come over the wires will be scattered through
out the paper.
IN order that the admission of this news may not crowd out campus
news, reporters have been instructed to write such stories more con
cisely. This, it is felt, will tend to correct what has been a trouble with
some of the Daily stories in the past. The news will be there but the
wordage will be gone. Another change that will come about, should the
scheme prove feasible, will be the grouping of a large part of the sport
news together 011 page three, thus leaving the front page top columns
open to all-university news and such of the world and national events as
may be deemed sufficiently important.
The foregoing sums up the system now being used on the larger
university papers mentioned before. When the Stanford Daily has
put this into operation, it will have truly taken its place among the leaders
in college journalism.
