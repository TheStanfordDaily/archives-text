# On the Borderline
## 
### 
At the meeting of the Men's Council yesterday a case came up per
taining to the use of the substance of a fellow student's report. This, the
student maintained in his defense, was not copying, but merely the result
of trying to use another's report in clarifying the assigned problem. The
class had been assigned to read a rather difficult and involved book, of
which the "Certain Student" declared that he could not make head or
tail. Hence, in order to clear his mind so that he might write his own
paper he read that of his fellow student.
Though the student was acquitted, for the Men's Council accepted
the defense that he had not tried to intentionally violate the ] lonor Sys
tem, he nevertheless had crossed the borderline. If one chooses to be
extremely and nastily technical about it, his classmate had also committed
a violation, for, as the Men's Council interprets the Honor System, one
should "neither give nor receive aid" either during examinations or for
outside work. It is upon this implication that the Men's Council will rule
in these cases that are seemingly on the ragged edge.
