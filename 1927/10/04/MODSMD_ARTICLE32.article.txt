Stanford's prospects of having a large rooting section to represent it
at the California game look slim when one sees the relatively small num
ber of applications that have come in for the Bear contest. Applications
for the other seats in the stadium are piling up rapidly but students seem
to have forgotten that there will be a Cardinal rooting section. Such is
the news we hear from Jake Irwin, who is handling the ticket sale and
distribution.
A student may apply for two other tickets in addition to his rooting
section ticket—there's no thought there that lie shouldn't apply for the
rooter's ticket. The organized rooting sections for the Stanford-Cali
fornia games are unsurpassed throughout the country for the color and
variety of their "stunts." It's a certainty that with the ticket problem at
the University of California (where about half the student body is lucky
to be able to get into the stadium at all) that the Blue and Gold section
will be filled to capacity.
Stanford students, not faced with such difficulties in getting tickets,
should plan, arrange, contrive, scheme, and make every effort to be in
the Cardinal rooting section when the whistle blows on November 19.
