DENVER, Colo., Oct. 3.â€”Ben B.
Lindsey, former Juvenile Court Judge,
has been vindicated by the Denver Bar
Association for burning the "shame
records" which he removed from his
office when he was ousted recently.
It was held that the juvenile records
were of confidential nature and that
such documents should be destroyed.
