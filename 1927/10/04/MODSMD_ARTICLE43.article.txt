BUYING BOOKS
I stand in line
At the Bookstore.
I spend my wad of cash.
I wait till the last minute,
Then to class I madly dash .

My Roommate Said
Stanford ain't no rest cure —unless
you mean a place to cure the habit of
resting.—A.L., '30.

"What did your roommate say? Send
it to the Daily.

Poor Archie Twitsbury, all too
anxious to get back to see the boys,
has found that he must also meet the
distributors of A's, B's, C's, and the
marks with which Archie is more
familiar. Listen to the poor boy's
bleat:
"Read ten pages of French
For tomorrow,"
The prof's first words
Turn the joy of getting back
To sorrow.
And Templeton, instead of
Being glad to see
Me back,
Made me do six laps
Around the track.
'Tain't right!

Today a Prof said:
"This course isn't to be considered
hard —just get your work from day to
day. I only had to flunk 30 per cent
last quarter."
Note: We are withholding the name
of the prof—to prevent—his classes
from being too crowded.

BULLFEST
Today I heard
Frosli gabbing
They didn't talk of rum
They only were agreeing
Encina grub is bum.
