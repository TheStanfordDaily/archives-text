# DR. JORDAN THRUSTS WITH RAPIER AT “SCIOSOPHY” IN HIS “HIGHER FOOLISHNESS”
## 
### 
From the role of a mildly satirical
narrator of "systematized ignorance
to that of an intensely dynamic de
fender of science, systematized knowl
edge, of religion, as against religions,
and that of a profound searcher after
unity in infinity ... a searcher whose
only reward is frustration; such is the
kaleidoscopic part assumed by Dr.
Jordan in his new book, "The Higher
Foolishness," published recently by
Bobbs-Merrill.
Sciosophv, a word coined by Dr. Jor
dan some thirty years ago, was de
fined as systematized ignorance; later,
Israel Zangwill referred to sciosophy
as "the higher foolishness," the term
which was borrowed for the present
book.
Since sciosophy, etymologically,
means "wisdom of shades" or "the
shadow of wisdom," Dr. Jordan writes
first of phantoms, apparitions, shad
ows, as various sciosophists have re
lated them to humanity.
Quotes Freely
Interpolating quotations into his text
with such frequency that they become
nearly the whole of his discussion, the
author makes apparent the principles
and applications of sciophistic facts
or fancies.
After describing the weird manner
in which Indian medicine men attempt
to heal by occult rites, describing them
with seeming seriousness, Dr. Jordan
quotes Voltaire without making any
personal comment: "Incantation will
kill a sheep if enough arsenic be
mixed with it."
Defines Logic of Sciosophy
"The crude notion of cause and ef
fect, so cramping to material science,
is cast aside in Sciosophy. It discards
all precedent." In such terms is the
logic of sciosophy stated.
Possession of wealth is of interest
to sciophosists, ". . . and what the
Bourgeoisie possess to the detriment
of the Proletariet is called Capital."
"The numerous and varied condi
tions involved in love and marriage
have naturally attracted the earnest
attention of scisopliists . . ~" con
tinues Dr. Jordan.
Even Hair Oil Sciosophic
Hair oil, scientifically useful though
it be, becomes endowed by sciosophy,
"systematized ignorance," with power
to stimulate the activity of the brain.
Who will doubt this? Witness the ad
vertisement reprinted by Dr. Jordan:
"W 's Scented Almond Oil, best
preparation to be used for men who do
mental work. The effect of almond oil
on the brain is known to everybody."
Finally, on page 193 of the 226-page
book, the author ceases to narrate idly,
easily: "Up to this point he (the au
thor) has tried to set forth, in enter
taining manner, examples of the meth
ods by which, through the ages, Scio
sophy has adorned or mystified truth."
Swiftly, concisely, he then deserts
sciosophy, hurries to discussion of sci
ence, religion, and infinity.
"Religions Die, Religion Never"
Ignorant superstition attached to the
adjuncts of religion, is not religion
itself: ". . . the term religion is used
as a general expression for organiza
tions, beliefs, creeds, symbols, tradi
tions . . . which have been developed
as accessories to religious thought or

feeling. . . . They are only means to
an end, not the thing itself. Religions
die, religion never," continues Dr. Jor
dan.
In defense of science, he writes:
"Delusion and illusion form the sub
ject matter of Sciosophy, as reality
forms the basis of science."
Astronomy, physics, mathematics,
biology: Dr. Jordan summarizes the
efforts made in each of these sciences
to find "the master key of the un
fathomed universe," and he finds that
nowhere has it been discovered. He
concludes:
Dr. Jordan Sums Up
"It is plain that neither in "syste
matic theology' nor in science has the
last word been said. In astronomy, in
physics, in life, in space, in time, in
thought, we find ourselves baffled in
the face of infinity. The master key
that shall unlock all doors which open
toward the Center, no man has yet
found. It too must lie within the gates
of Infinity!" —GUNNAR NORBERG.

easily: "Up to this point he (the au
thor) has tried to set forth, in enter
taining manner, examples of the meth
ods by which, through the ages, Scio
sophy has adorned or mystified truth."
Swiftly, concisely, he then deserts
sciosophy, hurries to discussion of sci
ence, religion, and infinity.
"Religions Die, Religion Never"
Ignorant superstition attached to the
adjuncts of religion, is not religion
itself: ". . . the term religion is used
as a general expression for organiza
tions, beliefs, creeds, symbols, tradi
tions . . . which have been developed
as accessories to religious thought or

feeling. . . . They are only means to
an end, not the thing itself. Religions
die, religion never," continues Dr. Jor
dan.
In defense of science, he writes:
"Delusion and illusion form the sub
ject matter of Sciosophy, as reality
forms the basis of science."
Astronomy, physics, mathematics,
biology: Dr. Jordan summarizes the
efforts made in each of these sciences
to find "the master key of the un
fathomed universe," and he finds that
nowhere has it been discovered. He
concludes:
Dr. Jordan Sums Up
"It is plain that neither in "syste
matic theology' nor in science has the
last word been said. In astronomy, in
physics, in life, in space, in time, in
thought, we find ourselves baffled in
the face of infinity. The master key
that shall unlock all doors which open
toward the Center, no man has yet
found. It too must lie within the gates
of Infinity!" —GUNNAR NORBERG.
From the role of a mildly satirical
narrator of "systematized ignorance
to that of an intensely dynamic de
fender of science, systematized knowl
edge, of religion, as against religions,
and that of a profound searcher after
unity in infinity ... a searcher whose
only reward is frustration; such is the
kaleidoscopic part assumed by Dr.
Jordan in his new book, "The Higher
Foolishness," published recently by
Bobbs-Merrill.
Sciosophv, a word coined by Dr. Jor
dan some thirty years ago, was de
fined as systematized ignorance; later,
Israel Zangwill referred to sciosophy
as "the higher foolishness," the term
which was borrowed for the present
book.
Since sciosophy, etymologically,
means "wisdom of shades" or "the
shadow of wisdom," Dr. Jordan writes
first of phantoms, apparitions, shad
ows, as various sciosophists have re
lated them to humanity.
Quotes Freely
Interpolating quotations into his text
with such frequency that they become
nearly the whole of his discussion, the
author makes apparent the principles
and applications of sciophistic facts
or fancies.
After describing the weird manner
in which Indian medicine men attempt
to heal by occult rites, describing them
with seeming seriousness, Dr. Jordan
quotes Voltaire without making any
personal comment: "Incantation will
kill a sheep if enough arsenic be
mixed with it."
Defines Logic of Sciosophy
"The crude notion of cause and ef
fect, so cramping to material science,
is cast aside in Sciosophy. It discards
all precedent." In such terms is the
logic of sciosophy stated.
Possession of wealth is of interest
to sciophosists, ". . . and what the
Bourgeoisie possess to the detriment
of the Proletariet is called Capital."
"The numerous and varied condi
tions involved in love and marriage
have naturally attracted the earnest
attention of scisopliists . . ~" con
tinues Dr. Jordan.
Even Hair Oil Sciosophic
Hair oil, scientifically useful though
it be, becomes endowed by sciosophy,
"systematized ignorance," with power
to stimulate the activity of the brain.
Who will doubt this? Witness the ad
vertisement reprinted by Dr. Jordan:
"W 's Scented Almond Oil, best
preparation to be used for men who do
mental work. The effect of almond oil
on the brain is known to everybody."
Finally, on page 193 of the 226-page
book, the author ceases to narrate idly,
easily: "Up to this point he (the au
