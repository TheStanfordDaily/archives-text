# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY “FEG MURRAY, ’16 
Over twenty-three years ago a young ]
recruit played his first major league !
ball game with the Cincinnati Reds.
Joe Kelley, Cy Seymour, Mike Donlin,
and Cozy Dolan were team-mates of .
the newcomer, while that famous tri
umvirate of Tinker, Evers, and Chance
were in the line-up of the visiting
team. The young recruit, though only j
able to bat .26.°. during his first season, !
proved himself a fast and brainy
fielder, and an excellent lead-off man,
and so he was able to hold down the
second-base position for the Reds and i
for the Cardinals for six years each,
finishing his major league career as a
player with eighteen games in 1916. i

Now that same recruit, grown
wrinkled and gray in the service, is
1 on the eve of managing the New York
Yankees in their fifth world series
| since he took over the reins as their
leader. Five American League pen
nants in ten years is a better record
than John McGraw's ten pennants with
j the Giants in twenty-five years. And a
! .500 average as manager is much bet
ter than a .265 average as a batter.
Ask Miller Huggins, for he is the fel
low under discussion.
Since Huggins, the "mighty atom
among managers," took over the job
of bossing the Yanks in the spring of
i 1918, his teams have finished in the

following positions: In 191 Sand 1919,
fourth; 1920, third; 1921, 1922, and
1923, first; 1924, second; 1925, sev
enth; and 192G and 1927, first. In four
world series, however, Manager Hug
gins has not been quite so successful.
He lost to the Giants, three to five, in
1921; was humiliated by them in 1922,
tying one game and losing four; and
last year was defeated by the Cardi
nals, four games to three. The Yankees
won their only world's championship
in 1923, defeating the Giants lour
games to two.
This week, however, it may be a
different story. Iluggins' 1927 team is
a truly great organization. Whether
they win or lose the series, their boss
deserves a world of praise on their
season's showing alone.
