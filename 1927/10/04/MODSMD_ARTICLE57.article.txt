# “LONE STAR” DIETZ REVEALS VARIED LIFE AS GRIDIRON MENTOR

"If we were pointed for St. Mary's as
they were pointed for us—well, we
would have walloped them. At that,
if we played defensive football, kicked,
and waited for the breaks, we could
have kept them from scoring."
And that is the opinion of William
H. "Lone Star" Dietz regarding the
recent Stanford - St. Mary's catas
trophe, for "Lone Star" was more in
terested in enjoying a good cigar than
in remorseful recollections of past de
feats. Moreover, he says he has been
beaten by better teams than St. Mary's
and is past the stage of wailing.
Dietz is helping ouc "Pop" now and
trying to assist in turning out a good
freshman team.
Former Carlisle Player
Twenty years ago, "Lone Star" first
broke in on Warner's football experi
ence. That was back at Carlisle, when
"Pop" was annually wrecking the fond
hopes of eastern teams. Dietz was a
substitute tackle on Warner's team
of 1907. In 1909, 1910, and 1911 he was
a regular, being captain in his last
year. On this team was the famous
Jim Thorpe, who, with Dietz, smashed
through Harvard, Pennsylvania, Pitts
burgh, Brown, Georgetown, and Lafay
ette, and lost only to Syracuse by a
score of 12-13.
After his graduation, Dietz helped
"Pop" coach the Indians, and then
went to Washington State in 1915.
Starting at the northern institution a
year before the Pacific Coast Confer
ence was organized, he brought the
Cougars to the championship of the
Pacific Coast. In January 1916, the
Cougars played the first intersectional
game at Pasadena, and gave Brown,
conqueror of Yale and Harvard, a 14
to 0 trouncing.
Coached Marine Eleven
After leaving Washington State,
where he played against Hugo Bezdec
and Gil Dobie, Dietz coached the Ma
rine eleven at Mare Island to the Ser
vice Championship of the Pacific. Then
he went to Purdue and brought the
team out of the slump that it had been
in since Andy Smith left. Louisiana
claimed "Lone Star" for two years,
and later he moved up to Wyoming,
where he has been until he dropped
in at Palo Alto—"just to help "Pop."

Jim Thorpe, who, with Dietz, smashed
through Harvard, Pennsylvania, Pitts
burgh, Brown, Georgetown, and Lafay
ette, and lost only to Syracuse by a
score of 12-13.
After his graduation, Dietz helped
"Pop" coach the Indians, and then
went to Washington State in 1915.
Starting at the northern institution a
year before the Pacific Coast Confer
ence was organized, he brought the
Cougars to the championship of the
Pacific Coast. In January 1916, the
Cougars played the first intersectional
game at Pasadena, and gave Brown,
conqueror of Yale and Harvard, a 14
to 0 trouncing.
Coached Marine Eleven
After leaving Washington State,
where he played against Hugo Bezdec
and Gil Dobie, Dietz coached the Ma
rine eleven at Mare Island to the Ser
vice Championship of the Pacific. Then
he went to Purdue and brought the
team out of the slump that it had been
in since Andy Smith left. Louisiana
claimed "Lone Star" for two years,
and later he moved up to Wyoming,
where he has been until he dropped
in at Palo Alto—"just to help "Pop."
"If we were pointed for St. Mary's as
they were pointed for us—well, we
would have walloped them. At that,
if we played defensive football, kicked,
and waited for the breaks, we could
have kept them from scoring."
And that is the opinion of William
H. "Lone Star" Dietz regarding the
recent Stanford - St. Mary's catas
trophe, for "Lone Star" was more in
terested in enjoying a good cigar than
in remorseful recollections of past de
feats. Moreover, he says he has been
beaten by better teams than St. Mary's
and is past the stage of wailing.
Dietz is helping ouc "Pop" now and
trying to assist in turning out a good
freshman team.
Former Carlisle Player
Twenty years ago, "Lone Star" first
broke in on Warner's football experi
ence. That was back at Carlisle, when
"Pop" was annually wrecking the fond
hopes of eastern teams. Dietz was a
substitute tackle on Warner's team
of 1907. In 1909, 1910, and 1911 he was
a regular, being captain in his last
year. On this team was the famous
Jim Thorpe, who, with Dietz, smashed
through Harvard, Pennsylvania, Pitts
burgh, Brown, Georgetown, and Lafay
ette, and lost only to Syracuse by a
score of 12-13.
