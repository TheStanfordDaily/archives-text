# Twenty Turn Out For Inter class Football Practice On First Day; Aspirants Given Light Work-Out
## 
### 
With a turnout of twenty men, in
i terclass football went through the first
i day with a light "get-acquainted-with
j tlie-ball" practice yesterday afternoon
j on the military field.
I Due to the naturally unsettled condi
j tions at present, C.- W. Davis, intra
; mural director, did not expect a
| larger number to come out for the
j first day of practice. The juniors re-
J sponded the strongest with enough
men for a full team. Although they
! will have the jump on the other
| classes, their advantage will not lje
! great if the others turn out with the
I
; usual enthusiasm that goes with mter
| class competition.
Each Class to Have Coach
Practice will begin today immedi
| ately after lunch because of the time
i necessary for physical examinations
j and for the distribution of equipment,
j The field is ready for play and there
, are coaches for all four teams.
Joe Oeschger, former St. Mary's
j coach and now doing graduate work
liere, will handle the freshmen. Willie
j Wolfe, a member of the 1929 freshman

| squad and a player on the "goofs," will
j coach the zealous juniors, and H. C.
Brown, who has been playing on inter
class teams for four years and who is
a former high school star, will help
the seniors to uphold their traditional
dignity. Davis will handle the sopho
mores.
Hot Contests Promised
After talking to the freshmen at
Encina last night, Davis expects a
large yearling turnout. The seniors
| who won the interclass football last
year and who will find it difficult to
| win the interclass title this year, are
expected to bring out more than
enough for a full team.
Thus the situation promises a hotly
| contested set of football games, what
with the juniors already out in force,
I the freshmen also coming out with
i several aggregations, and the seniors
: working up steam with which to re
peat their victory of last year. Of
course the sophomores will make some
I sort of a showing, but so far they have
not manifested much either by their
i turnout or their attitude.
