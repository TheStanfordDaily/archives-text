"LOST â€”An eighteen-year-old
girl; blonde,beautiful; reported
to have entered Stanford Univer
sity in the Class of 1931. Last
seen sitting on a trunk in front
of the railroad Station in Palo
Alto. $5000 reward for her re
covery."
The above notice has been
posted by the Chaparral staff,
who fear that the eighteen-year
old debutante has been kid
napped. "In order to facilitate
search, we are this morning dis
tributing to Stanford students
hundreds of pictures of the girl,"
the editor announced. "We have
not yet given up hope, because
women of this type are quickly
noticed."
The picture of the missing
beauty was done by Ruth Taylor
White. Maps of the campus, pre
pared from thorough research
and showing choice locations for
"those who wrestle by night,"
are also being distributed.
"All of this and much more in
formation is being issued in com
pact, handy form in the first num
ber of Chaparral, on sale this
morning," the Circulation Man
ager chuckled.
