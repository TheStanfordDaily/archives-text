"This will be an important year for
the Y.W.C.A.," says Harriet INI Cogs
well who suceceds Isabel Capps as
Secretary of the campus branch. "We
"will be working toward the National
Convention which will be held in the
•spring at Sacramento.
A new purpose will be presented
for the approval of the Stanford
group, and it will be seen whether
this group may then retain its affilia
tion with the national Y.W.C.A. The
purpose, which is deemed radical in
that it entirely omits any question of
the church, is as follows:
"We unite in the desire to realize
full and creative life through a grow
ing knowledge of God.
"We determine to have a part in
making this life possible for all peo
ple.
"In this task we seek to understand
Jesus and to follow him." .
