We learn from a United Press dispatch yesterday that a report is
being circulated to the effect that Herbert Hoover and Hiram Johnson
have collaborated on a "put and take" scheme whereby Johnson will
pledge the California votes in the next national convention to Hoover in
return for the Secretary's support of the Swing-Johnson Bill.
To the minority who firmly believe thai the world is going to the
dogs, and that the nation's politics have already gone there, this rumor
will be as welcome as the twelve-mile limit to a rum-runner. To the
thinking majority, the obvious absurdity of the charge is evident.
In the first place, Hoover has only to announce his candidacy in order
to get the votes of the California delegation. Disregarding his national
and international achievements, the mere fact that he is a Californian
would insure those votes. Hence, no such political schemes as this are
called for, even if Hoover were the type of man to resort to such cam
paign methods, and he is not that type.
In the second place, Hoover was one of the originators of the plan
to get the states concerned to co-operate in an effort to solve the Colo
rado River question. Therefore, it would require no persuasion on the
part of Johnson, or anybody else, to gain Hoover's support of any project
which offers a solution to the difficulty, and the Swing-Johnson Bill does
offer such a solution.
Rumors such as this only make more evident the desirability of edu
cating the public to a knowledge of sectional affairs in the political
hemisphere.
