# Defeat U.S.C. Twice
## 
### 
Today is the last day on which students may purchase rooters' tickets
for the U.S.C. game. Though the closing date for the purchase of these
tickets may seem early to freshmen, those who are "in the know" are
buying their tickets NOW. The Stanford-U.S.C. game, despite the fact
that this season the contest comes early, attracts almost as much interest
as the "ancient rival" Stanford-California duel.
Furthermore, the Trojans are planning to do bigger and better things
with their rooting section and band. These reports have worried Cheer
leader A1 Cass, who has voiced his hope that the Cardinal rooters will
turn out en masse. As preparation for the U.S.C. game all rooters are
asked to wear their red and white caps for the Nevada contest. The
football game won't be the only contest with U.S.C.—there will be
another between the rooting sections.
