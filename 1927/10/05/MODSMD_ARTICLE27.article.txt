Miss Anna May Price, recently director of dramatics at San Mateo
Junior College, and slightly further back, an artist on the New York
stage, has started in earnest her work as Director of Dramatics here at
Stanford, her opening production being for Sword and Sandals. The
exact play is not yet selected. Miss Price is already well known to a
considerable number of Stanford people, and by that number greatly
admired, both for her work in Ilamlct two summers ago and her invalu
able aid to Gordon Davis in several summer productions.
But this is her first appearance as Chief Kleagle, Ilead Potentate, or
whatchamacallit, and we predict that it will be a successful one. We have
seen some of her work, and it is good. Not only that, we have talked to
her, and we like her.
Miss Price's tryouts commenced yesterday, and she will, we are sure,
be glad to give all the dramatic fledglings a good fling.
We wish Anna May Price a lot of luck.
