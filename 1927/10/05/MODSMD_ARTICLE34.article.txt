## 
### 
BFPLTN, Oct. 4.â€”After a flight of
45 minutes, the Junkers seaplane G-24
landed at Schelling Woudy, near Am
sterdam, Holland, abandoning what
was to be a transatlantic flight via the
Azores and Newfoundland to New
York. There was great mystery re
garding the flight. The backers, who
had hoped to show the feasibility of
transatlantic passenger service by fly
ing two airplanes in tandem, are un
known.
