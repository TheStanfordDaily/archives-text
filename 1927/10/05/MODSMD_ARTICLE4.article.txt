"The grasping 'Uncle Shylock' has
replaced the old idea of generous
hearted Uncle Sam in the European
conception of the United States," as
serted Dr. Joseph Stancliffe Davis, Di
rector of the Stanford Institute of
Food Research, in his lecture on the
War Debt settlements last evening in
the Little Theatre.

"We are in danger of becoming
penny-wise and pound-foolisli in our
policy in regard to the debt," warned
the director. "In our safely intrenched
position of economic prosperity, we
are too prone to a short-sighted com
placency in our attitude toward the
foreign viewpoint regarding this prob
lem. We have taken a too narrow
legal position concerning repayment of
our loans to the Allies during the
War," continued Dr. Davis.
"The chiefest ganger is in the
strained relations resulting between
the United States and the foreign
debtor countries, who do not feel that
we have treated them fairly, nor shoul
dered our just share of a common re
sponsibility," the lecturer stated, in
estimating the probable result of the
settlement now in effect.
Points to Consider
Dr. Davis contrasted the idea held
by the average taxpayer, that the
War loan should be paid just as any
other loan; and the radical view fa
voring complete cancellation, advo
cated by many students of the situa
tion His personal standpoint was
somewhat between the two extremes.
Some outstanding points we must
consider in summarizing the situa
tion," declared Davis. "This is not an
ordinary debt, but a share in common
responsibility; money is worth from
a third to a half more than it was in
the time of war; and our government
should not demand a higher interest
rate than it pays on its own loans. A
spirit of friendly co-operation, rather
than a grasping and aloof policy,
would insure the international good
will and understanding which our
present attitude is endangering,"
warned Dr. Davis in concluding.
