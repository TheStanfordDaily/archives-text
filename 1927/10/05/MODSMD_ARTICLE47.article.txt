MUDFIGHT
Freshman, now
Comes the time,
When you learn
About the slime
Of Lagunita's cockleburrs
And algaed mud.
The Sophomores
Plan to wrinsc
Your scurvy necks
And make you bleat
Your prayers for mercy
In ignominious defeat.

"Hello, Phi Bete."
—"Hello, Phi Bete yourself!"
"I ain't no Phi Bete!"
—"Y'aint, huh? Who got the A

"That was the other Smith. I
only got a C ."
—"Pardon, ole man! I got a C myself.
Say er why don't you
come over to the room some

Yes. if somebody will pive us a mil
lion and a quarter endowment, we
might lower ourselves by taking over
Dr. Buxton's dental college.

When Archie road that "French girls
pay their way with kisses, he rose up
in righteous horror and wrote this lit

The French miss
Pays her way
With a sweet kiss
But I think
I'll be wary
I've heard
That kissing
Isn't sanitary.

My Roommate Said
My roommate asked me, "Who is
this guy, nicknamed "Sciosophy," that

Dr. Jordan thrust with a Rapier, and [
since when has Dr. Jordan taken up '
fencing?" He pointed to the headline j
in yesterday's Daily—
Dr. Jordan Thrusts With
Rapier at "Sciosophy" in
His "Higher Foolishness"
Whose roommate could be dumber? i
I")o I get the prize?—G. Whizz, '29, 229 i
Toyon.
* * *
That's a good one, G. Whizz! If no 1
cleverer remarks come in, you may
get the prize.—Ed.
* * #
Ts G. Whizz the only follow in Stan-j
ford who has a dumb roommate? We'll
be led to believe that they're all "too j
clever for words," that is, printed
words.
* * *
As our two transfers from Philadel
phia were discussing an important j
campus subject, one said to the other — j
"Go thou, dumb one,
Sign up for thy
Die: Game tickets.
If thou hast
No need of them,
Give them to thy friends
At cost —but don't
Make a damn cent
In thy bargainings!
* * *
I see that
Miss Sn&So, '29,
Has married
A prominent gink
From somewhere.
And they're on a
Honeymoon trip
To Europe—
After which they'll
Live in the town mansion
Of the groom.
—And all this time
I've been under the
Impression that
Stanford girls
Come here to get
An education!

Yes. if somebody will pive us a mil

When Archie road that "French girls
pay their way with kisses, he rose up
in righteous horror and wrote this lit

The French miss
Pays her way
With a sweet kiss
But I think
I'll be wary
I've heard
That kissing
Isn't sanitary.

My Roommate Said
My roommate asked me, "Who is
this guy, nicknamed "Sciosophy," that

Dr. Jordan thrust with a Rapier, and [
since when has Dr. Jordan taken up '
fencing?" He pointed to the headline j
in yesterday's Daily—
Dr. Jordan Thrusts With
Rapier at "Sciosophy" in
His "Higher Foolishness"
Whose roommate could be dumber? i
I")o I get the prize?—G. Whizz, '29, 229 i
Toyon.
* * *
That's a good one, G. Whizz! If no 1
cleverer remarks come in, you may
get the prize.—Ed.

Ts G. Whizz the only follow in Stan-j
ford who has a dumb roommate? We'll
be led to believe that they're all "too j
clever for words," that is, printed
words.
* * *
As our two transfers from Philadel
phia were discussing an important j
campus subject, one said to the other — j
"Go thou, dumb one,
Sign up for thy
Die: Game tickets.
If thou hast
No need of them,
Give them to thy friends
At cost —but don't
Make a damn cent
In thy bargainings!
* * *
I see that
Miss Sn&So, '29,
Has married
A prominent gink
From somewhere.
And they're on a
Honeymoon trip
To Europe—
After which they'll
Live in the town mansion
Of the groom.
—And all this time
I've been under the
Impression that
Stanford girls
Come here to get
An education!
MUDFIGHT
Freshman, now
Comes the time,
When you learn
About the slime
Of Lagunita's cockleburrs
And algaed mud.
The Sophomores
Plan to wrinsc
Your scurvy necks
And make you bleat
Your prayers for mercy
In ignominious defeat.
B. Ware, '30.
