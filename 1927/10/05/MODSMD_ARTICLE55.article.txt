Another world series—this one, the
twenty-third—is with us, and perhaps
a few facts on some previous autumn
madnesses would not be out of place.
The first "inter-league" competition
took place back in ISB4, when Provi
dence of the National League beat the
Metropolitans of the American Asso
ciation three games to none. These
nrst post-season series were not "world
series," however. They continued until
1891, with the exceptions of the years
1891-1893, inclusive; 1898 to 1902, in
clusive; and 1904. The Temple Cup,
contested for from 1594 to 1597. inclu
sive, was a trophy offered by W. C.
Temple of Pittsburgh for a post-season
series between the first and second
clubs in the National League, and no
championship Avas involved.
In 1903 the winners of the National
and Americ an Leagues met for the
first time, but not under present-day
rules. The Red Sox beat the Pirates,
five games to three. No series was
played the following year—the year of
John McGraw's first pennant—but in
1905 the winning teams of the two
rival leagurs got together in the offi-

J cial World Series, and have met with-j
' out interruption ever since. In the
twenty-two post season classics played j
! the champions of the younger circuit 1
nave won twelve times, and their ri-j
vals ten times.
Among the world series records you ,
will find that one George Herman
rtuth, the central figure in the above
composition, has played in the most
contests and holds several other rec- 1
crds worthy of your attention. This
I coming series will be the Babe's |
! eighth. His other records are as fol- j
lows: He has scored four runs in one j
game, and made eight home runs in
his total series games, four of them j
in one series and three of them in
cne game. He has hit for a total of j
twelve bases in one game, and made
extra bases on long hits to the extent !
of thirty in his total series, with j
twelve in one series and nine in one ,
game. Besides that, he has been ■
"walked" twenty-six times, total series, j
and eleven times in one series. And j
the Babe even breaks into the pitching |
! records with a total of twenty-nine j
| scoreless innings hurled back in 191G

! and 1918, when he was known as one
jof the best southpaws in the game,
| and not as a home-run king.
And rest assured that he will set
some new records in the coming strug
gle !

1891-1893, inclusive; 1898 to 1902, in
clusive; and 1904. The Temple Cup,
contested for from 1594 to 1597. inclu
sive, was a trophy offered by W. C.
Temple of Pittsburgh for a post-season
series between the first and second
clubs in the National League, and no
championship Avas involved.
In 1903 the winners of the National
and Americ an Leagues met for the
first time, but not under present-day
rules. The Red Sox beat the Pirates,
five games to three. No series was
played the following year—the year of
John McGraw's first pennant—but in
1905 the winning teams of the two
rival leagurs got together in the offi-

J cial World Series, and have met with-j
' out interruption ever since. In the
twenty-two post season classics played j
! the champions of the younger circuit 1
nave won twelve times, and their ri-j
vals ten times.
Among the world series records you ,
will find that one George Herman
rtuth, the central figure in the above
composition, has played in the most
contests and holds several other rec- 1
crds worthy of your attention. This
I coming series will be the Babe's |
! eighth. His other records are as fol- j
lows: He has scored four runs in one j
game, and made eight home runs in
his total series games, four of them j
in one series and three of them in
cne game. He has hit for a total of j
twelve bases in one game, and made
extra bases on long hits to the extent !
of thirty in his total series, with j
twelve in one series and nine in one ,
game. Besides that, he has been ■
"walked" twenty-six times, total series, j
and eleven times in one series. And j
the Babe even breaks into the pitching |
! records with a total of twenty-nine j
| scoreless innings hurled back in 191G

! and 1918, when he was known as one
jof the best southpaws in the game,
| and not as a home-run king.
And rest assured that he will set
some new records in the coming strug
gle !


The Autumn Madness
Another world series—this one, the
twenty-third—is with us, and perhaps
a few facts on some previous autumn
madnesses would not be out of place.
The first "inter-league" competition
took place back in ISB4, when Provi
dence of the National League beat the
Metropolitans of the American Asso
ciation three games to none. These
nrst post-season series were not "world
series," however. They continued until
1891, with the exceptions of the years
1891-1893, inclusive; 1898 to 1902, in
