# STUDENTS URGED TO AID CLUBHOUSE FUND
## 
### 
Students who do not wish to keep
their Bookstore slips are asked to
place them in the box for the Women's
Clubhouse fund, by Mrs. E. P. Cubber
ley of the Clubhouse Board. The box
will continue to be at the Lasuen
Street entrance of the Bookstore.
The Clubhouse has been able to
make over $300 each year by this
means. The money has been used for
improvements and furnishing. As the
Clubhouse is a community affair, men
as well as women are requested to aid
the fund.
