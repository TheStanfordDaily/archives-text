# DAILY TRYOUTS SCHEDULED FOR MONDAY NOON
## Actual Work in Publishing Paper to Be Duties Of Tryoutees FRESHMEN URGED TO TRY Applicants Require No Past Experience to Gain Staff Jobs 
### 
Opening tryouts for the editorial staff
of the STANFORD DAILY will begin
Monday with a meeting of all candidates
at 1 o'clock in the Daily office next to
the Press Building. All students, par
ticularly freshmen, who are interested in
newspaper work, should report at that
time.
Tryoutees will have au actual part in j
publishing the paper. Work will consist j
of covering campus beats, writing stories, |
rewrite work, and reading proof. These
duties will not take a great amount of
time from studies.
Advancement on the staff will be con
trolled by the quality of the work done
and the interest shown in the welfare of I
the paper. Promotion from the regular j
news staff progresses through copy read- j
ers to night editor and the other higher j
positions on the editorial staff.
Experience Unnecessary
Previous experience in journalistic i
work such as on high school or junior j
college publications, is not necessary, as j
tryoutees will have an opportunity to !
learn the work from the ground up. But
any students who have engaged in jour- j
nalism have through the medium of the I
Daily an excellent chance to follow up j
that work.
In addition to the experience to be
gained on the paper, the members of the
staff will find that their work is also
valuable in getting positions as campus j
correspondents for metropolitan papers j
and news services. In no other depart- j
ment of the University will students find
that thiir work will parallel that which
they would have to do in the same field
outside of college. The methods of pub
lishing The Stanford Daily arc almost
identical with those employed by large
â€¢outside papers.
Tryoutees are given definite assign
ments of news beats to cover and are j
thrown on their own devices and respon- j
sibility to secure and write up the desired \
information.
Through work on the Daily students i
learn o f the workings of the University !
and become better acquainted with var
ious phases of student activities and the
University administration.
