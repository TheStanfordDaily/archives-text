# SOPHOMORES WARNED AGAINST ENCINA RAID BY MEN'S COUNCIL
## 
### 
Warning has been issued by Clark
Cypher, head sponsor of Encina Hall,
that any sophomores found in the hall
the night before the mudfight will be
reported to the Men's Council and
dealt with accordingly by that body.
Sophomore raids were almost a tra
dition up to the fall of 1025 when the
attack on the hall resulted in seri
ous damage to University property
and cost the sophomore class a lot
of money.
