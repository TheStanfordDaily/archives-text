# DAILY'S CIRCULATION REACHES 3500 MARK
## 
### 
Only those students who failed to
give their correct addresses on the
registration blanks last Saturday have
not received the initial copies of the
Stanford Daily. Some 150 incomplete
or incorrect addresses have been
found, and are being corrected as rap
idly as possible.
Circulation of the Stanford Daily
has reached the 3500 mark, including
525 issues delivered daily In Palo
Alto. The Palo Alto deliveries started
yesterday morning.
