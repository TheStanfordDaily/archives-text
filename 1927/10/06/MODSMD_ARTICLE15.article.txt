LAREDO, Texas, Oct. 5. —Tourists |
arriving here today were not aware j
of revolt in the Mexican Republic after \
having travelled through Mexico City, i
Dudley Duype, United States consul J
to Guadalajara, refused to comment
on the Mexican situation, although he
did express surprise when informed of

was en route to Washington to confer
with Department of State officials.
"More than 60,000 persons, mostly]
unskilled workers, have entered the
United States from the republic of j

MEXIC O CITY, OCT. s—President

ism to the early suppression oE the
military revolt intended to overthrow J
hem. One rumor, unconfirmed, was j
that General Arnuelo Gomes,, chief |

tured and executed.

The elimination of Gomez would
leave but one outstanding rebel op
ponent of the government—General
Hector Almada, who led out of Mexico

who started the revolt. Almada is re
ported to be near Oriental, in Vera

federal column of 3000 infantry and
cavalry.
Calles Caused Revolt
It was announced by the government

learning of an impending revolution
against him and Obregon, began
quietly rounding up known opposition
leaders, and sending troops to strate
gic points.

all but from 15 to 25 by execution. The
others were killed in a fight at Torreon
that resulted in the overwhelming of
a rebel group by federals.
