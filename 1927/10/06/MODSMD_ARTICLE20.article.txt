# Freshman Squad Faces Varsity In Fast Scrimmages
## 
### 
I
Playing football of pre-St. Mary's !
| game quality, Pop Warner's battered i
l legion took out its accumulated venom !
ion the freshmen last night and proved :
| that in spite of holding the world's |
collegiate fumbling record there is l
i still plenty of the old fire left.
Hoffman, Fleishhacker, Murphy, and j
Patchett were in the backfield. Pat
chett were in the backfield. Patchett
I was consistent in swooping around
ends on reverse plays, and he exe
| cuted some llashy runs. Fleishhacker,
getting into active service again for
the first time since his ankle was
cracked, was powerful in line plunges,
| hitting his opponents with such vigor
i that he knocked himself out.
The varsity still showed consider
; able ability in dropping the bail, but
1 if there is as much improvement dis
j played by next Saturday as there has
j been since the Saint game, there is
|bo need for worry about that phase
of its performance.
i Husky Hunt's freshmen, on tho de
fense during the scrimmage, did some
neat tackling, and nipped plenty of
their opponents' reverses and end
runs in the hud. Against line plays,
however, they were no match for the
i varsity.
