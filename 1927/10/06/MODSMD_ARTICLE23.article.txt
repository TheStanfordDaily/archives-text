# WILBUR WARNS FRESHMEN TO SHUN CYNICISM
## President in Welcome Talk Advises Newcomers to Preserve Ideals "BEWARE BALL, CHAIN" 1931 Told to Examine Leader Before Following Him Slavishly 
### 
"Don't become cheap college cynic,"
President Kay Lyman Wilbur warned
the incoming freshmen in his annual wel
coming assembly address yesterday morn
ing. "Preserve your idealism and en
thusiasm. Follow the best traditions here
at Stanford, but beware of the ball and
chain of the past."
Follow the leader' is a popular slo
gan, but look over your leader first, and
don't lie in a hurry to do it," said the
president. "J'.c an off-horse at first, work
hard, and you will l>e all right. If you
came looking for a soft berth, it is bet
ter to slip out now before we slide you
out."
Sketches Work
Dr. Wilbur sketched the most recent
work of the University, giving especial
mention to the Ryan Laboratory, the
Hopkins Marine -Laboratory, and the
new additions in connection with the
physical education department, among
others. I lie four fields in which Stan
ford is not adequately represented, the
president gave as music, art, architecture,
and religion.
"I read in the newspapers and from
parents' letters about 'overwork.' This
is one of the biggest fallacies in college;
if the student oganizes his work and
keeps it up, he will never have cause to
complain," l)r. Wilbur asserted in fur
ther advice to the freshmen.
Needs Thinkers
"Beware of provincialism," the presi
dent continued. "We need men who can
think in the big terms of world citizen
hip; otherwise it is hard to see what
will be facing us in twenty-five years.
If we can develop out of Stanford those
wth this spirit, we can feel the founders
of the University did indeed a wise
thing."
"lake the attitude of an inquirer al
ways. Don't let superstition and tradition
stand in your way, and don't be too
lolerant of those who need a great deal
of toleration to be absorbed!" continued
Dr. Wilbur. "Another tradition to dis
regard or turn to account, is the number
of organizations with which the campus
is littered. The function of the majority
of them seems to be a photographic one.
Make what you go into worthwhile," the
president emphasized.
Fees Explained
Dr. Wilbur also spoke of the change
of Stanford from a "family affair'' to a
national institution, requiring the pay
ment of tuition by the students enrolled.
This fee covers only one-third of tiie
actual expense entailed, the president
said. He reported also a higher percent
age student return each year. Sixty per
cent of the l c J2l freshmen returned, while
83 per cent returned last year.
Automobiles, Dr. Wilbur spoke of as
a serious problem. "Princeton and Michi
gan have ruled them off the campus, and
we can do so here at Stanford if care is
not taken against reckless driving," de
clared the president.
