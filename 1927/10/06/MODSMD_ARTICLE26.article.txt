# "The Boat"
## 
### 
(A Note for Freshmen.)
the ensuing few months you will hear the phrase "Get on the
Boat" expounded to you from every angle, from professors, from club
presidents, from sponsors, from Y.M.C.A. representatives. They will tell
you that to become a real Stanford man you must join the crew of this
elusive water craft, lovingly known as "The Boat."
Being unable on the printed page to orate with far-flung arms, we
will try our best to hint at the true meaning of this aquatic allusion in
cold, black type.
Now, here at Stanford various customs and traditions have devel
oped, such as the Law Steps, not smoking on the Quad, and tipping one's
hat to the President or to Dr. Jordan. There is also a custom much en
forced by the professors (they are paid to do it) ; namely, that of doing
a great deal of studying.
BESIDES the traditions and customs, there is a great group of Stanford
institutions tagged en toto with the name "Activities." "Get out for
one activity and stick to it," is the cry. It is a good cry. The people who
tell you this know what they are saying. In following that one brief sen
tence two dangers may be obviated—being a bookhound or an activity
hound, both of which are similarly to be deprecated. If one goes out for
no activity, and becomes a book hound, he will be a dull boy, like Jack of
the fable. If he goes out for activities and does no studying—well, he is
liable not to get that coveted Abie Degree.
Now let us look at a group of students whose time is spent neither in
bookish pursuits, nor in the pursuit of "Activities," in the sense men
tioned above. In the singular, these college lads arc designated as "A
CERTAIN STUDENT." You may get more of an idea, without our
enlarging here, of what the activities of this group consist, by reading
little notices posted outside the Administration Building.
IHIE group appears to be made up of well-meaning men who have deter
mined that they must have a "well-rounded" college career. The big
trouble is that many of these careers are stopped before the circle is com
plete. To be sure, these individuals are allowed to hobnob with some of
the most eminent personages on the campus, members of the Men's Coun
cil (perhaps the Women's Council), and even at times, with Dr. Wilbur
and Dean Culver. However, as you will find out soon enough, it is not
always for pleasure that they thus hobnob. It may mean work.
Yes, even at Stanford, bad little boys must remain after school.
The trick of "getting on the boat" then, as you may already have dis
covered, is a matter of adding up certain of the first-mentioned and sub
tracting the last.
