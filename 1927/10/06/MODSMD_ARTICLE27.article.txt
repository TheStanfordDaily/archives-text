# Rejuvenating the Rally Committee
## 
### 
Several drastic changes in the organization of the Rally Committee
were made with the granting of the new charter at the last meeting of
the Executive Committee. Of major importance was the provision for a
reception sub-committee to be composed of ten of the total Rally Com
mittee membership which now numbers thirty instead of twenty as be
fore. This action now provides the University with a definite body
charged with the task of receiving visiting teams, coaches, and officialsâ€”
one not of small import when the value of pleasant contact with repre
sentatives of other universities is considered.
Bob Fraser, chairman of the Rally Committee, has the power of
changing this sub-committee membership in order that all thirty members
may have an opportunity to serve on this minor body should such a
scheme seem practical. What is accomplished by this is simply a division
of the labor which annually confronts the Rally Committee, and the se
lection of one body to handle a portion of the work.
At a meeting of the old members of the Rally Committee held last
Monday night the suggestion was made that the members secure white
sweaters with some distinguishing insignia, a small red axe, for example,
so that the policing and arranging of rooting sections would be easier. It
is thought that the red caps are insufficient for this purpose. The sugges
tion is a good one, and it is our belief that such a scheme would assist in
building up something more of an esprit dc corps among the members.
