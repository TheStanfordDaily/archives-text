# Everything All Right?

It just occurred to us a moment ago while we were lighting the
editorial pipe that thus far no Campus Opinions have conic in. We don't
know whether to infer that everything is going along smoothly, or
whether it's just too early for that sort of thing. Rut if anything turns
up that you may want to see in black and white, write it down (in less
than 250 words, please), and drop it in the mail care of the Stanford
Daily, or bring it in the officc. Sign your name to it and indicate
whether or not you desire the name to be withheld.
