# COMMITTEE MAKES FLAN FOR TROJAN RALLY WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford student body
will take their first action in preparation
for the Cardinal-Trojan clash here Octo
ber 15 at the rally to be held next Wed-;
nesday night at the Basketball Pavilion.
The date was chosen at the Rally Com- j
mittee meeting last night.
Although the final plans for the sea
son's first rally cannot be disclosed at
the present time, the Committee promises
to put on one of the best pep meetings
held on the campus for some time. Due
to the importance of the game, which is
attracting much attention both on the j
Coast and in the East, special plans have
been decided on by the Rally Committee.
Stunts to be used for the U.S.C. game
should be handed in to Bob Eraser, chair-1
man, before Friday noon. As yet not j
many stunts have been turned in, and I
there is still time to begin working on j
them, Fraser stated.
The Registration Dance, sponsored by j
the Rally Committee, was also discussed 1
at the meeting. Door prizes will be given
to roughs and couples alike, and the
trophy for the winning stunt will be pre-j
sented to the author sometime during the |
dance.
The number of rallies to be held this
year was cut to include one for the Big
Game and two send-offs, one for each
of the Washington and Oregon games in
the north. Special sweaters were voted
to be worn by the members in order to
distinguish them easily at the games and
rallies.
