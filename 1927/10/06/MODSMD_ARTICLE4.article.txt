# SWORD AND SANDALS TRYOUTEE SURVIVORS WILL MEET TONIGHT
## Thirty-Four Men, Nineteen Women Chosen for Second Trial 
### 
Thirty-four men and nineteen wo
men survived the first tryouts for the
Sword and Sandals play to be pre
sented October 28. They are asked to
report for second tryouts tonight from i
7 till 9 in the Assembly Hall.
The play to be chosen, according to
Miss Anna May Price, director of dra
matics, is a recent New York success
by a well-known playwright. It is a
play of interesting ideas, serious i
i
enough to balance the sophomore play j
which will be given later in the quar- j
ter. As there will be no productions
repeated from summer school, it is
necessary to offset the class comedy
with a heavier piece.
Two Hundred Try Out
The two hundred men and women
who tried out exhibited excellent ma- j
terial, says Miss Price. Because of
the type of play to be presented, how
ever, she found it necessary to cut the j
number of tryoutees very closely. She !
wishfes those who did not pass the!
first eliminations to tryout again, as '
she has kept a record of each as- j
pirant.
The following will please report for j
second tryouts tonight from 7 till 9 j
in the Assembly Hall. Students who!
were unable to try out previously will
still be given a first hearing at that
time:
