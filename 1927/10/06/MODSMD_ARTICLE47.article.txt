# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, â€™16 
The last two months of the National
League pennant struggle were fea
tured by the presence of three vet
! erans whose ages totaled 107 years.
Leslie Mann, it is true, did not "come
back"to the majors as Rabbit Maran
| ville and Heinie Groh did, but he was
| acquired by the Giants on July 1!).
j The three together form an interest
j ing example of how valuable the pres
| enee of a steady old-timer or two is to
j a ball club in the closing weeks of a
| tight pennant race.
The acquisition of that foxy and
i skillful playboy of the majors, Rabbit
| Maranville, by the Cardinals, and the
purchase by the Pirates of that famous
third-baseman, Heinie Groh. bottle bat
and all, were both very smart moves
on the part of their respective man
agements, as men like the Rabbit and
Heinie, while too old for a season's
service in the big time, are extremely
valuable over a stretch of four or five
weeks. Both, like Leslie Mann, have
been through the excitement of many

ja strenuous, nerve-wracking campaign,
i and were sure to be a good influence
|on their younger and more nervous
teammates. While those of only a few
| years' experience are wont to crack
I under the strain, players like Maran
ville and Groh could do as much by
their attitude and leadership as by
j their playing ability.
Leslie Mann, who was born exactly
| a week after Maranville, went to the
Braves back in 1913. He played one
! season with the Chicago Reds, and
four with the Cubs. He is a most in
: teresting character, for, besides being
j a good pinch-hitter and utility out
' fielder, he has used his knowledge and
j experience as a player to perfect a
novel method of teaching baseball by
moving pictures. Mann has invented
his own projecting lantern and made
numerous films to show the correct
! and incorrect ways of batting, fielding,
| base-running, pitching, and coaching.
| He has a lecture course to go with it,
! and his system of teaching is both
j unique and valuable.
