library are two valuable sets costing j
approximately $1,500. "Corpus Reforma
torum," an 87-volume set published in

the middle ages and contains Latin and
French documents of that time. The
work is too abstruse to be used as a
reference f or any of the history courses,

rity on the middle ages and the Reforma
tion, expects it to be of use to research
students.
"Palaeontographica," a 69-volume work
also published in the last century, is in
German, the authors being Dr. W. Dun
