# RETURNED VETERANS BRIGHTEN PROSPECTS FOR TENNIS SEASON
## Herrington and McElvenny Improved by Rigorous Summer Playing 
### 
Despite tho loss through graduation ,
of Cranston Holman and Lionel Ogden,
potent three-year Stanford tennis
luminaries, prospects for a powerful
11)28 team are exceedingly good. Ralph
McElvenny and Alan Herrington, vet
erans of two California varsity
matches, are back again, and with
John Wheatley, Gomer Thomas, Er
nest Renzel, and Larry Driscoll are
expected to defend successfully the
many honors captured both on the
Coast and in the East by the 1927!
players.
Real competition for team places!
looms with the summer improvement
of Thomas and Dricoll. Thomas won
a beautiful match on the 1928 fresh-1
man team against Heilbron of Cali
fornia but allowed his game to sag
subsequently for lack of regular prac-!
tice. Through the summer he played
steadily in Los Angeles, practically;
regaining his old-time form. Driscoll
is a new name in Stanford tennis, hav
ing forged ahead rapidly in the last |
two years on courts in Burlingame. Ho
plays in a fast, hard style, which,;
when steadied down slightly by con
sistent practice, should carry him far.
Herrington and McElvenny spent
the summer in rigorous competition in
various eastern tournaments. Con
sant play with the best in the tennis
world has worked an improvement in
their games which is hoped will aid
Stanford to repeat its last year's vic
tories over all Pacific Coast Confer- j
ence colleges.
