# MOST RECENT PHASE OF EVOLUTION DISCOVERED BY TEXAS PROFESSOR

### 
Arguments for the survival of the
fittest are again in order with the
announcement from the fifth Interna
tional Genetic Congress, recently held
in Berlin, of what has been termed
"the greatest scientific development
that has been made in the study of
evolution." Credit for the discovery
has been attributed to Dr. Herman J.
Muller, professor of zoology at the
University of Texas.
By experiments which he conducted
in his laboratory at the university, Dr.
Muller proved that the minute parti
cles known as genes which are found
in all animal life and which are known
to be responsible for heredity may be
speeded up in their development and
made permanent in after generations
by means of X-rays. In this way de
sirable qualities in both animal and
plant life may be brought about and
developed more rapidly through the
influence of the X-ray. This method,
if proved successful and practical, will
supplant the old system of cross
breeding for producing or eliminating
certain qualities and characteristics in
both animal and vegetable life.
Scientific circles, not only in the
United States but all over the world,
are greatly interested in the discovery
both for the effect it might have on
the agricultural industries and be
cause it will undoubtedly give an in
sight into the causes of evolution and
into the very nature of the genes
themselves.
Although most of Dr. Muller's ex
periments were performed on tiny
fruit flies .the effects will be the same
for all kinds of life, according to the
Scientific Monthly which states:
"While it seems a far cry from flies to
four-footed beasts, it has always been
found in the past that the principles
of heredity found in the flies apply also
to plants and to higher animals, in
cluding man himself."
