# GALOSHES SHOW WOMEN ARE OF LEISURE CLASS FASHIONS ARE EVIDENCE OF SOCIAL TRANSITION U.C. PROFESSOR CONNECTS FADS WITH HISTORY

"Trifles light as air" —even such gay
fads as Russian boots, may have an
interesting historical meaning for the
student of styles and manners.
Dr. Robert P. Utter, a professor in
the English Department at the Uni
versity of California, sees in the Rus
sian boots and galoshes a sign of
transition —a transition which men
made a hundred years ago.
The woman of today, according to
Professor Utter, has invaded the busi
ness world. But while she must be
able to do work in the same field
with her more practically-dressed
brother, she must look as though she
had just stepped from a limousine, and
were going to a tea, or on a shopping
tour. Her shoes are still high-heeled,
her dresses fragile, her stockings silk.
Fashion Basis Practical
"The Russian boot," Professor Utter
continued, "is a protection for the im
practical shoes and sheer hose which
fashion dictates women still must
wear. As far as fashions go, a woman
is still a member of the leisure class.
And, curiously enough, during the day
of the Industrial Revolution in Eng
land —the days of George III —men
were passing through the same sort
of transition.
Galoshes Show Styles
The fashionable beau, as the com
mercial life of Europe began to de
velop, began to interest himself in the
drab world of business. But, like the
"flapper" of today, he must still ap
pear to have stepped out of the draw
ing-room: his dress was as gaily im
practical as ever. Thus he, too, began
to wear long, knee boots during un
pleasant weather, and for the same
reason that the modern girl does —to

protect delicate ami impractical silk :
hosiery.
"Swallow-Tail" Army Relic
Commenting on men's styles, Pro
fessor Utter says: "During the revo
lution army officers wore coats which
were cut away to allow room for a j
swinging sword. We still have this
type of coat in the 'swallow-tail.' "
Utter also calls attention to the pres
ent cut in military uniform, giving us
the Norfalk jacket, which originated
as a shooting jacket for the English
country squire.
