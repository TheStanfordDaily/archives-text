# Half 1931 Class Passes English Entrance Test
## 
### 
Over half the entering class was suc
cessful in passing the matriculation ex- !
animation in English, show figures given 1
out by Samuel S. Seward, associate pro- j
fessor of English. The number, 235,1
represents about the same percentage as â– 
in former years, says Professor Seward.

Fumbles, except out of bounds, can
be recovered by either team.
A player may run out of bounds and
return to the field and still be eligible
to receive a forward pass.
Ihe ball is "dead" if muffed when
handed instead of passed backwards.
A player in motion toward his own
goal line is not considered in the rule
prohibiting motion as part of a shift.
