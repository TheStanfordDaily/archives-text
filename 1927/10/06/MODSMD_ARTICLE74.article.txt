# WOMEN'S HOCKEY GETS ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT
## 
### 
With a new field now being prepared
In addition to the two old fields, and
three coaches to handle the teams,
the women's hockey season is opening
this quarter with much better equip
ment than that of last year. There is
a slight fulling-ofi' in enrollment; over
90 signed up for the various teams
last autumn, while only 83 reported
this time. This is offset, however, by
a more even distribution of players
among the classes.
Last year's senior team consisted
of eleven members who were forced to
play short-handed on most of tne
games; this year they boast nineteen
regulars, five of whom are graduates.
Seventeen juniors appeared both last
year and this. Twenty sophomores
fcigned up, two less than last year, and
the freshmen show the greatest con
trast with thirty-five last year and
twenty-seven this.
The hockey department is handi
capped by the absence of the manager
elected last year. Ruth Mason, '29, is
unable to take the position this quar
ter, and aa yet no new manager has
been elected. The first practice will
lie on Monday, October 10, and the
managerial position will be filled later.
