(Sport is always a subject of much
discussion, particularly at this season
when even one's grandmother is likely
to reach into the sock for a coin or
two which she wants to wager on the
outcome of a football game or prize
fight. Accordingly, in order to keep
the Stanford student (as well as his
grandmother) completely informed of
the latest thoughts and speculations
of those "in the know,"the Daily will
from time to time run a column of
sport comment. This is the first of the
series.—Ed.)

A host of prayers respectfully peti
tioning a Blue and Gold victory in the
California-St. Mary's game Saturday
is daily going up from the lips of Stan
ford football funs. Furthermore, close
observers of gridiron activities who
congregate each night about the var
sity practice field are alleging that
St. Mary's will suffer defeat at the
paws of the Golden Bear. Even their
money is on the Berkeley eleven.
These same knowing ones say that
the prudent investor will watch close
ly the outcome of Saturday's struggle,
and if California wins, will patrol the
streets of Berkeley in order to take
up bets with rash Californians on the
Big Game at whatever odds are of
fered.

The expected return of Spud Har
der, Pop Warner's leading candidate
for end, to the practices next week,
makes prospects for the Washington,
Santa Clara, and California games
look brighter, as Harder probably will
be able to participate in these fra
cases. Dick Worden, out thus far this
season with a strained abdominal
muscle, is to return to the lineup and
will also be in the fight for a wing
job. All any of the half-dozen or so
aspirants for the end positions need to
earn the gratification of the coaches
and the student body is to look and
act on the field as Ted Shipkey and
Ed Walker did.' A fast-charging end
caii work miracles for his own squad
and havoc for his opponents,' as was
apparent during last Saturday's un
pleasantness.

Lieutenant-Colonel E. R. W. Mc-
Cabe, head of the R.0.T.C., announces
that an ettort will be made to send
the 1928 Stanford polo four East for
the intercollegiate matches next sum
mer.
Popularity of this game is increas
ing by leaps and bounds in the East
ern colleges, notably Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, and West Point, lie reports,
To send a Cardinal squad to partici

streets of Berkeley in order to take
up bets with rash Californians on the
Big Game at whatever odds are of

The expected return of Spud Har
der, Pop Warner's leading candidate
for end, to the practices next week,
makes prospects for the Washington,
Santa Clara, and California games
look brighter, as Harder probably will
be able to participate in these fra
cases. Dick Worden, out thus far this
season with a strained abdominal
muscle, is to return to the lineup and
will also be in the fight for a wing
job. All any of the half-dozen or so
aspirants for the end positions need to
earn the gratification of the coaches
and the student body is to look and
act on the field as Ted Shipkey and
Ed Walker did.' A fast-charging end
caii work miracles for his own squad
and havoc for his opponents,' as was
apparent during last Saturday's un
pleasantness.

Lieutenant-Colonel E. R. W. Mc-
Cabe, head of the R.0.T.C., announces
that an ettort will be made to send
the 1928 Stanford polo four East for
the intercollegiate matches next sum

Popularity of this game is increas
ing by leaps and bounds in the East
ern colleges, notably Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, and West Point, lie reports,
To send a Cardinal squad to partici

prestige of this sport of kings on the
Pacific coast.
(Sport is always a subject of much
discussion, particularly at this season
when even one's grandmother is likely
to reach into the sock for a coin or
two which she wants to wager on the
outcome of a football game or prize
fight. Accordingly, in order to keep
the Stanford student (as well as his
grandmother) completely informed of
the latest thoughts and speculations
of those "in the know,"the Daily will
from time to time run a column of
sport comment. This is the first of the
series.—Ed.)

A host of prayers respectfully peti
tioning a Blue and Gold victory in the
California-St. Mary's game Saturday
is daily going up from the lips of Stan
ford football funs. Furthermore, close
observers of gridiron activities who
congregate each night about the var
sity practice field are alleging that
St. Mary's will suffer defeat at the
paws of the Golden Bear. Even their
money is on the Berkeley eleven.
These same knowing ones say that
the prudent investor will watch close
ly the outcome of Saturday's struggle,
and if California wins, will patrol the
streets of Berkeley in order to take
up bets with rash Californians on the
Big Game at whatever odds are of
