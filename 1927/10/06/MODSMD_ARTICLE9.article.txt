# STUDENT EXPELLED UNDER NEW RULING OF MEN'S COUNCIL
## ORGANIZATION IS FIRM Merrill Armour Elected to Fill Vacancy Made by Grahamâ€™s Absence 
### 
Acting on its policy to be guided by a
literal interpretation of the honor pledge,
the Men's Council last night expelled a
certain student from the University for a I
three month period. "We intend to make
it known that the Council shall do all in
its power to maintain this Stanford insti
tution and to deal summarily with any {
one who violates his pledge," declared 1
Fred Wool, chairman of the body. '
The sentiment of the Council is as
follows:
The Men's Council feel that the honor J
pledge must be lived up to in order to
preserve the honor system as an institu
.
tion at Stanford. In accordance with this
feeling it shall be the policy for the
Council to recommend that offending
students be expelled for a period to be j
determined by the Council, as provided j
in the honor pledge. The Council further j
wishes to call to the, attention of the j
Student Body that either giving or re- j
ceiving aid is a violation of the honor {
system, and that conscious knowledge
that another student is copying from j
one's paper comes within the meaning l
of giving aid.
FRED WOOL, Chairman.
Merrill Armour was elected to fill the
vacancy left by Kenneth Graham. Ar
mour was formerly chairman of the!
Council but has not been in the Univer- j
sity for two quarters.
