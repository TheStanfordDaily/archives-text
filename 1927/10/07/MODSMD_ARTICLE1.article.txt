# VARSITY READY FOR ONSLAUGHT OF WOLF-PACK
## Nevada Team Due to Arrive On Card Campus Early Tomorrow Morning OPPONENTS ARE IN TRIM McCreery, Hyland Still Limp Prom Leg Injuries; Frentrup to Start 
### Templeton Peck 
The wolf is fond of red, if the
Little Red Ridinghood fable can be
believed, but the sort of red the
Nevada Wolfpack will meet in tomor
row's game will be the Sons of the
Stanford kind, which is considered to
be not so easily seducible.
Led by Captain Hansen, tackle, and
Coach Shaw, Nevada's gridiron hus
kies, will arrive here tomorrow morn
ing from Reno. The team is reported
to be in good shape after the Califor
nia game last week, with "Buck"
Farnsworth, center, again in the line
up following injuries sustained early
in the season which kept him out of
the Berkeley mixup.
Quarter Fast
The Wolves have a fast quarterback
in "Whitey" Lawson, a handy young
man about the field, who is making
the permanent portion of the Reno
citizenry rub their eyes and recall the
halcyon days when Rabbit Bradshaw
ran away from one of the California
wonder teams one Saturday afternoon
when the Bear coaches and first-string
players were scouting elsewhere.
The visitors' line is apparently fair
ly heavy, the meaker reports coing in
indicate.
Cards Confident
Despite the lesson taught by the St.
Mary's setback last week, the Cardinal
coaches expect little trouble in dis
posing of Nevada and will be chiefly
concerned in trying out different com
binations in the backfield and on the
ends preparatory to the U.S.C. game
October 15. Very probably one oÂ£ the j
members of the coaching staff will be
in Los Angeles scouting the Trojans
and O.A.C.
Indications were last night that Lud
i Frentrup, sophomore flash and per- i
haps the best punter on the varsity
squad, will start the game tomorrow
at left half. Frentrup hurt his leg in
I the Olympic game and has been on
the bench since.
Preston, Davidson Ends
Although Pop Warner has not an
; nounced the lineup, it appears prob
able that John Preston and Hodge
Davidson will start as ends. These two
positions will be the cynosure of all
I eyes, for their strength or weakness
I will have much to do with the out
come of next Saturday's campaign j
against the Trojans.
Hal McCreery and Dick Hyland
were still limping at yesterday's prac- i
tice. McCreery is bothered with a foot
blister, and Ilylaud wrenched bis !
knee in practice. Dick Worden was in
a suit today for the first time since
he hurt himself the first day of prac
i tice last month. Smalling, Sellman,!
and Post have all returned, following j
injuries last weelc.
The probable lineup is: ends, Pres
ton and Davidson; tackles, Freeman
and Sellman; guards, Robesky and
Post; center, Heinecke; quarter,
Lewis; halves, Frentrup and Hill;
j full, Hoffman.
| Preceding the varsity game, which !
is scheduled for 2:30 o'clock, the |
I Stanford freshmen will play the Santa i
Clara babes at 12:30 o'clock.
