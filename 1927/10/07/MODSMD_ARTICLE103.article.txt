# FOOTBALL COACHES IN EAST VOICE PROTESTS AGAINST NEW RULINGS
## 
### 
NEW YORK —,IP) —One week ago
; the coaches of the country were kick- '
i ing miglitily against the new pass!
rule in football, a rule which they said
woulS confuse the players. Today their
protest has changed and is directed
against a rule which was thought |
thoroughly harmless.
Saturday's games in the East dis
closed the fact that the removal of
the goal posts to ten yards from the
i playing field so confused the players
that in the majority of cases neither ,
j team was ever quite sure when a
touchdown had been made.
Already efforts are being made to 1
discover some novel manner of mark
| ing the hundred-yard lines so that I
I they may be discernable from a dis- j
tance and near at hand alike.
