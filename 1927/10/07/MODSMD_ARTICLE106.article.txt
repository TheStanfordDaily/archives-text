# REBEL LEADER MEETS DEATH AT HANDS OF MEXICAN FEDERALISTS
## 
### 
MEXICO CITY, Oct. 6.—With a
smile, General Alfred Ouijano, a rebel
leader, today met death before a firing
squad of federal soldiers.
"Goodbye," /he said in English, waving
to three American newspaper correspon
dents, who were permitted to witness
the execution.
The soldiers fired, and he fell back
wards.
Physicians, rushing to Ouijano, found
fiim still breathing, although two bullets
were lodged near his heart.
Bullet Pierces Heart
They motioned toward the execution
squafl, and a soldier stepped forward
with Lis rifle, to lire at scorching range
the "coup de grace." This bullet pierced
the heart.
A courtmartial of eight officers sat
through the night trying Ouijano for
treason. He was accused of joining a
Febel leader, General Hector Almada.
Later Ouijano had deserted from Al
mada's forces, and surrendered to the
government troops with his men.
Protests Guilt
Ouijano protested his innocence. He
testified that he was asleep at Taxcoco,
military post near the capital, when an
officer informed him at daybreak Sunday
that Almada and his troops—the ones
that deserted from the Mexico City gar
rison—had arrived.
Ouijano pleaded that Almada was his
superior officer, and that he was forced
to obey orders in joining the rebels. At
the first opportunity, he said, he deserted
them.
Court Refuses Plea
The court refused to accept his plea,
and around dawn he was pronounced
guilty of treason.
His aide, Lieutenant Colonel Florence
Aritua, was scntenoced with him.
