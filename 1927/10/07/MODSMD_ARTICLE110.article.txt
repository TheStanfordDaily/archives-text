# FEDERATION ASKS FOR NEW WAGE SCALE TO KEEP PACE OF TIMES
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 6.â€”A stirring
appeal for a new wage to keep pace with
increasing power to produce and the ap
parent failure of elTorts to block official
approval of the Boulder Dam proect fea
tured the session of the American Fed
eration of Labor here today.
Declaring that industries cannot func
tion full time because American labor
lacks the purchasing power to buy the
product, John P. Frey of Cincinnati, Sec
retary of the Retail Trades Department,
urged that the worker be given his just
share of the nations income'.
"The workers now produce 49 per cent
more than they did in 1899, but the real
wage paid has shown only a 5 per cent
increase," he declared.
Labor, in its fight for a lngher wage,
is not basing its demands upon what the
individual must consume in order to live,
but upon the market value of the things
produced.
Attempts of opponents of Boulder Dam
to prevent the convention from placing
its official stamp of approval upon the
Boulder Dam have failed, and a
vote on the resolution will be reached.
1 his action has been assured, Ralph L.
Criswell, representing the Los Angeles
Bureau of Water and Power, said' late
today.
