BOSTON*. Mass., Oct. 6.â€”Brilliantly
painted hieroglyphics and a row of fe
male statues which were cut into a wall
forty-five centuries ago and still retain
their coloring were two of the most re
markable findings reported by the George
A. Reisner expedition now in Egypt.
1 hese" splendid examples of ancient
Egyptian art were discovered in the tomb
of Queen Meresankh, great, great grand
daughter of the famous pyramid builder,
Cheops. Although her crypt had been
broken into and plundered at some unde
termined date, the inscriptions were un
touched. Two of them gave the date of
the Queen's death and the time of her
funeral, revealing the fact that 272 years
had elapsed between these events.
Of the remains of the mummy and the
splendid trappings which were undoubt
edly buried with it, only the disjointed
skeleton of the queen remains.
