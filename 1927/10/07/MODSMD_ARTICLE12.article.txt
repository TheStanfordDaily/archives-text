## FROM UNITED PRESS. ARMY PERFECTS NEW ANTI AIR-CRAFT GUN 
### 
ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND,
Md., Oct. 6.â€”Automatically sighting the
enemy in the air by means of sound
waves, the United States government to
day demonstrated the latest in anti-air
craft defense before delegates to the
ninth annual convention of the Army
Ordnance Association.
The gun, controlled by a sensitive in
strument that picks up the sound waves
of the enines of airplanes in flight, throws
a searchlight upon the aircraft when the
gun is discharged at night. The new
weapon was one of the new develop
ments placed on exhibition here.
From early morning until late at night
all types of ordnance equipment pos
sessed by the government, from huge 16-
inch guns to the evil-spitting machine
guns, cracked and barked until the Mary
land hills shook with the roar.
It was a satisfying and yet nerve rack
ing demonstration. The 16-inch gun
raised its ugly snout and hurled a ton
: shell 30 miles as easily as the one-pound
! shot out its death cargo. New eight-inch
i guns, mounted on railway trucks, and
12-inch railway guns belched forth their
; -00 and 700 pound shells.
