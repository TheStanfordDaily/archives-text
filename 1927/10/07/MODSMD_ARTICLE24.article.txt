place this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock on
the dry Lagunita bottom.
Pits Completed
The men turned out en masse yester

pleted by dark. They will contain four
and a half feet of the "thickest, most
uncomfortable mud that it is possible to
mix," Charles W. Dickenson, chairman
of the mud fight committee, announced
last night.
Although no foreign substance is to
be placed in the mud, no participant will
care for more than one dipping in the.
soothing and hygienic composition, Dick
enson avers. To prevent the introduction
of any foreign substance which might
prove injurious, or oil. which in years
past has been used and which has gen
erally remained with the participants
several days after the fracas, the com
mittee announces that the pits will not
be assigned until immediately before the
fight.
La Barba Is Leader
Freshmen last night held a final meet
ing in Encina and with Fidel La Barba
as their leader are ready to tost their
mettle against the experienced sopho
mores. The frosh are conceded a chance
with their superior numbers, but this ad
vantage is overbalanced by the experience
of a previous similar encounter which
fortifies the sophomores and makes them
a slight favorite.
The sophomores yesterday held a final
meeting at which it was decided to enter
the fray stripped and greased to the
waist. They elected Eric Krenz, Jack
Hare, Perry Taylor, and Chuck Eddy as
their leaders and planned what should
be an effective attack. They will meet in
, front of Sequoia at 2.15 ready to fight.
Emerson Spenser and Fred Wool, the
committee assistants to Dickensen, will
be on hand to judge the tussle with him,
and a crew of Block "S" men will act
as policemen and referees.
Two o'clock is the huur the freshmen
have set to meet in front of Encina. They
will receive a few daubs of paint there
and more upon reaching the scene of the
fight.
Once a contestant is thrown in the pit
nearest his starting point, he is ineligible
for further competition and must with
draw to the sidelines. Each class will
start from a pit and must be returned to
and thrown into the same pit before it
will be declared conquered.

La Barba Is Leader
Freshmen last night held a final meet
ing in Encina and with Fidel La Barba
as their leader are ready to tost their
mettle against the experienced sopho
mores. The frosh are conceded a chance
with their superior numbers, but this ad
vantage is overbalanced by the experience
of a previous similar encounter which
fortifies the sophomores and makes them
a slight favorite.
The sophomores yesterday held a final
meeting at which it was decided to enter
the fray stripped and greased to the
waist. They elected Eric Krenz, Jack
Hare, Perry Taylor, and Chuck Eddy as
their leaders and planned what should
be an effective attack. They will meet in
, front of Sequoia at 2.15 ready to fight.
Emerson Spenser and Fred Wool, the
committee assistants to Dickensen, will
be on hand to judge the tussle with him,
and a crew of Block "S" men will act

Pits Completed
The men turned out en masse yester
day afternoon and the pits were com
pleted by dark. They will contain four
and a half feet of the "thickest, most
uncomfortable mud that it is possible to
mix," Charles W. Dickenson, chairman
of the mud fight committee, announced
last night.
Although no foreign substance is to
be placed in the mud, no participant will
care for more than one dipping in the.
soothing and hygienic composition, Dick
enson avers. To prevent the introduction
of any foreign substance which might
prove injurious, or oil. which in years
past has been used and which has gen
erally remained with the participants
several days after the fracas, the com
mittee announces that the pits will not
be assigned until immediately before the
fight.
La Barba Is Leader
Freshmen last night held a final meet
ing in Encina and with Fidel La Barba
as their leader are ready to tost their
mettle against the experienced sopho
mores. The frosh are conceded a chance
with their superior numbers, but this ad
vantage is overbalanced by the experience
of a previous similar encounter which
fortifies the sophomores and makes them
a slight favorite.
The sophomores yesterday held a final
meeting at which it was decided to enter
the fray stripped and greased to the
waist. They elected Eric Krenz, Jack
Hare, Perry Taylor, and Chuck Eddy as
their leaders and planned what should
be an effective attack. They will meet in
, front of Sequoia at 2.15 ready to fight.
Emerson Spenser and Fred Wool, the
committee assistants to Dickensen, will
be on hand to judge the tussle with him,
and a crew of Block "S" men will act
as policemen and referees.
Two o'clock is the huur the freshmen
have set to meet in front of Encina. They
will receive a few daubs of paint there
and more upon reaching the scene of the
fight.
Once a contestant is thrown in the pit
nearest his starting point, he is ineligible
for further competition and must with
draw to the sidelines. Each class will
start from a pit and must be returned to
and thrown into the same pit before it
will be declared conquered.
No Slugging Allowed
Slugging or unfair play of any sort
will not be tolerated and will cause for
feiture of the contest to the opposition,
Dickenson announced.
Professors arc asked to allow all fresh
men and sophomores to leave classes in
time to attend the encounter.
