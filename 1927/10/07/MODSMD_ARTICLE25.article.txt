# MALONEY RE-ELECTED PRESIDENT OF PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF A.A.U.
## 
### 
Henry W. Maloney, director of minor
sports at Stanford, has been re-elected
president of the Pacific Association,
A.A.U., which office he has held for the
last two years.
In his recent report of the organiza
tion under his stewardship, he revealed
a surprising advance in membership and
financial condition of the Association.
He refused to take credit for this rapid
development and praised the officers and
commissioners for their conscientious
work.
Maloney predicts further growth hand
in hand with the ideals of standing for
the best in amateur sport and of being
of untold service to the youth of the
community.
