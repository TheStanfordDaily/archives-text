# MacInnes' Gleeful Statement
## 
### 
VESTERDAY'S Daily carried a small story of an announcement by
Professor C. R. Machines, director of Princeton's summer school,
saying that scholarship had been improved by the new ruling barring
student automobiles. At least, so he gathered after one summer session
under the new ruling, "While the new automobile rule was in effect
there were better attendance standards, better conduct, and only a small
number of failures," he reported.
We won't question the accuracy of the statement, though after Stan
ford's experience with the perversion, probably for publicity purposes,
of the University's poll of the prohibition question, we're inclined to
sniff at things like this.
Princeton's effort, then, to return to the studious, monastic form of
life has been successful in the eyes of one who should be in a position
to know. In order to prepare young men for the busy life of American
civilization of the present day, Old Nassau takes a running jump back
into the Middle Ages and gleefully says it's great. Anyone would —
after he has already jumped.
H ow EVER, to make such a statement one must assume that grades
are of greater importance than some who ought to know would have
us believe. Better known educators than Professor C. R. Machines and
Dean Christian Gauss, who are chiefly responsible for the inauguration
of the rule, have expressed themselves quite differently on grades.
Furthermore, it is a common thing to hear students say that they have
gotten more out of some courses where they received merely a passing
grade than out of some in which they received the elusive "A." And it
is a common phenomenon to see wide variations in the grades of the
same student during a year, whether or not he owns a car.
Princeton, instead of seeking to control mischievious, wilful abuse
of student automobiles, solves the problem by removing it entirely. The
Alexandrian method of cutting the Gordian knot received collegiate en
dorsement. If you're stumped in a game of chess, just sweep the pieces
off the board—it's so much easier.
IT IS only natural in a community of three thousand, the size of Prince
ton, including its faculty, that there would be several whose misuse of
automobiles would be obnoxious. Why not simply deny those, after they
are proved guilty, the right to use cars? There is no need of denying
many who do not misuse cars the right of a modern convenience which
they would be using daily after they left college. A man who has brains
enough to go to college shouldn't be branded as too untrustworthy to
use an automobile.
Furthermore, as we remember the Daily Princetonian at the time of
passing this rule, student opinion was strenuously opposed to the rule.
But that made no difference to the Princeton administration. The sooner
some college administrations seek to work with students, the better are
colleges going to be. A college, after all, would be a mighty sorry place
with no students.
