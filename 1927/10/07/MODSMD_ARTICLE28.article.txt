# The 						Season Isn't Over Yet

In a communication recently to the San Francisco Chroniclc, a Mr.
Joe De Forest, '02, complained of what he saw as a lack of teamwork
and use of too many substitutes on the part of "Pop" Warner in the
St. Mary's game. De Forest followed the usual style of the old alumnus,
saying that "in his day teamwork was the main objective and substitutes
were only used to replace the injured." He waxes sarcastic by sug
gesting that football be made compulsory so that every male student
could later tell his grandchildren how "he played in the Big Game for
four seconds when Stanford lost to the Bobbed-Flair High School 400
to nothing."
We enjoy reading such things almost as much as we do Stephen
Leacock; we laugh after reading either of them, but we laugh with
Leacock. As we see it, "Pop" is trying to train as many as possible in
teamwork, and to prepare for future seasons.
