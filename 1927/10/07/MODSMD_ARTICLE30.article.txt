# STEINBECK CAN'T HOLD SOPHOMORES FROM FRAY KRENZ FACES LA BARBA IN FEATURE EVENT WOMEN OF TROY TO AID 1930 MUD WALLOWERS
## 
### 
Four hundred and fifty sophomore
men assembled in Room 214 yesterday
afternoon to hear Stanford Steinbeck,
class president, reveal the carefully
formed plans of attack for the mud
fight which is""to be splattered off with
the freshmen this afternoon in the
lake bed at 2:30 o'clock.
When Steinbeck managed to be
heard above the uproar lie directed
the men to gather at Sequoia this
afternoon at 2:15 and to bring with
them only half as much pugnacious
spirit as they exhibited at the meet
ing. Eric Krenz, National A.A.U.
weight titleholder and world cham
pion, will lead the sophomore legions,
and will be assisted by Lieutenants
Perry Taylor, Jack Hare, and Chuck
Eddy, all of whom have had heavy-

I weight experience in the ring.
The sophomore girls, shouting like
the women of Troy, will be very close
to the actual battle if not in it. Their
spirit very nearly exceeds that of the
1 men.
The most of the meeting was taken
| up by speeches from members of the
i class who had seen freshmen, in the
j course of the last week, casting off
1 the bonds of tradition by committing
i offenses of various natures. Steinbeck
j immediately quieted the commotion
I worked up over this issue, and was
backed by the class in the resolution
: that there would be no raid on Encina
at any time before the struggle. The
concensus of opinion was that it would
be much more gratifying to have but
one explosion of energy, and that at
2:30 this afternoon.
