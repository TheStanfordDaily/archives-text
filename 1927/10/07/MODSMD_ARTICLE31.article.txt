There is 110 denying that the Calif ornia-
St. Mary's tussle tomorrow is going to
have all the football fans of these Pa
cific States fairly pop-eyed with won
der. For if the Bears win, what will
those California fellows do, who were
forced to waste the entire fall semester
last year watching their team meet suc
cessive defeats every time Saturday came
around? We don't wish to be quoted,
but the thought of the elation that will
sweep over the Berkeley campus warms
our charitable heart.
Or assume the Saints win, They will
then have a pair of feathers in their hat
that would shame an ostrich. Victories
over Stanford and California on suc
cessive Saturdays are feats seldom ac
complished, and for this very reason the
Blue and Gold may reasonably be ex
pected to win.
Bettencourt, Catholic captain, and
O'Gorman, the brilliant halfback, are
both out of the game, if reports are cor
rect, and the loss of these two men might
well demoralize a team that can't have
helped suffering a serious letdown after
having been "pointed" for the Cards.
