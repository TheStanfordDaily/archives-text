The fact that Stanford claims three of
the nine players ranking in the intercol
legiate list of tennis stars last summer,
while six other colleges have but one
representative each, speaks eloquently of

limelight shed 011 the younger players of
the season, with John Doeg of Santa
Monica, a member of the class of 1931,
being selected as a Davis Cup team alter
nate, and Cranston Holman, Allen Her
rington. Ralph McElvenny, and Lionel
Ogden participating in nearly every ma
jor tournament.
