# INTENSIVE WORKOUTS ARE NOW UNDER WAY FOR CLASS FOOTBALL
## 
### 
Intensive scrimmage is well on its
way in the interclass football camps
on the military field. The teams have
passed the stages of just getting
familiar with the ball, and are settling
down to the old grind that leads to
perfection.
The senior eleven is light but lias
speed to spare. There is a driving
power at the center of the line that
gives that team something to build
around. The juniors are getting their
plays down to mechanical precision
with a versatile backfield that can
pull most of the tricks known to foot
ball.
The freshmen have just begun to get
down to work, up to this time having
been handicapped by their small num
bers. The sophomores are badly in
need of more material, Coach Davis
having but half a team to which he
can teach football.
In the past, it has been noticed that
the class winning the football inter
class conference usually gets the start
on the others for tne interclass title,
the reason being that it takes so many
men to make a single team. The
coaches of the four teams would wel
come more candidates, not for the
making of good teams so much as for
more men receiving the privilege of
studying the game.
