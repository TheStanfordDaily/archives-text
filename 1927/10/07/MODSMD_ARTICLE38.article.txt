# TROJAN-AGGIE GAME OPENS CONFERENCE FOR SOUTHERN TEAM
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 6.â€”Coach
i Howard Jones' Thundering Herd
which stampeded against the Santa
Clara Bronchos last Saturday in the
Los Angeles Coliseum are now busy
j going through the paces preparing for
the Oregon Aggie Beavers Saturday.
This will officially open the confer
ence season for the Trojans and pres
ent predictions are to the effect that
the Trojans will have to fight to win
the argument.
The Beavers boast of having a
smooth-running machine which is way
i ahead of their aggregation of 1926.
: The Trojans' exaggerated win over
| the Broncs may mean a lot or it may
| not. The Trojans pulled one fumble
' which cost them a touchdown and a
| couple of others that would have been
I costly against a better machine.
Jones will endeavor to remove the
I unnecessary juggling from the playing
J and send the Thundering Herd against
j the Beavers an even better team f h:ui
j trampled the Bronchs.
