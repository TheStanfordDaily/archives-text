# Twenty-One Survivors Remain After Cut In Tentative Play Cast
## 
### 
Twenty-one tryoutees remain 111 com
petition for the Sword and Sandals play,
according to Miss Anna May Price, di
rector. Rivalry has been unusually keen,
and Miss Price has experienced great
difficulty in cutting the list.
Many new aspirants reported for the
first time last night, bringing the total
number of tryoutees to approximately
225. This is believed to be a new record
for a dramatic turnout.
The difficult type of characters re
quired for "The Lady of the Rose" calls
for unusual ability in those who are
cast. However, Miss Price believes that
with the material available she will have
no trouble in selecting her cast.
Miss Price wishes again to thank those
who have tried out, and to congratulate
Stanford on the amount and excellence
of its dramatic supply. She expects a
most satisfactory year, as such great en
thusiasm has been manifested already.
The following are asked to report for
third tryouts in the Assembly Hall to
morrow evening from 7 till 9 o'clock.
Tryouts will be over promptly so that
the actors may attend the Registration
Dance.
Women: Spirito, Bentley, Gamier,
Fitz, Mcrritt.
Men: Haizlip, Thornton, Pischel,
Ricklefs, Funk, Meyer, McNaught, Hurt,
