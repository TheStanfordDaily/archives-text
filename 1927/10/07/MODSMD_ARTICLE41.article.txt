MY ROOMMATE SAID
My roommate took Gen. Biology last
quarter. I'm taking it this year. When
we came to this question—
"If a curly winged, blue-eyed wam
pus is mated to a straight-winged,
pink-eyed wampus, what will the little
wampi look like in the second genera
tion if blue eyes are recessive and
straight wings are sex-linked?"
My roommate said nothing.

MY ROOMMATE SAID
My roommate took Gen. Biology last
quarter. I'm taking it this year. When
we came to this question—
"If a curly winged, blue-eyed wam
pus is mated to a straight-winged,
pink-eyed wampus, what will the little
wampi look like in the second genera
tion if blue eyes are recessive and
straight wings are sex-linked?"
My roommate said nothing.

To have a car—

If the Sophomores
Should get you wet
Just get them a little wetter.
