# QUANTITIES OF FOOD PRODUCED IN ARCTIC ZONE, TROPIC REGIONS
## Professor Says That World Will Not Starve for Many Years 
### 
The world is in no danger of starving
so long as the Arctic and the tropics lie
undeveloped, says Professor 1!. H. Cro
cheron. Director of Agricultural Exten
sion at the University of California.
Professor Crocheron recently returned
from a trip to Alaska, on which he vis
ited every important town except Nome.
He traveled 1,300 miles down the Yukon
and on all three of the railroads in the
territory.
Impressed with the possibility of Alas
ka furnishing food for the temperate
zone, Professor Crocheron says:
"Those who have predicted that Amer
icans would cease to be a meat-eating
people because of the lack of grazing
lands and grazing animals have evidently
failed to take into calculation the vast
territory which we call Alaska.
"This area, one-fifth the size of the
United States, has prairies measured in
terms of thousands of square miles on j
which certain animals thrive. To be sure, i
lhe winters are long and severe and the ;
earth is perpetually frozen below the '
surface thaw of summertime, but the i
mosses and grasses grow abundantly and
•over it vast herds roam at will.
"One firm has 125,000 reindeer. They
are marketing 5,000 carcasses a year at
successful prices and are now building
a canning plant and operating a refrig
erator ship.
"Caribou run wild by many thousands; >
one band of 70,000 swam the Yukon, j
blocking the way of steamers till they j
had passed.
"The College of Alaska is crossing the
caribou on the reindeer to increase their !
size.
The United States Experiment Station ;
at Fairbanks is crossing the yak from
Tibet on Galloway cattle, expecting to .
secure a breed of beef animals that will ]
live and feed on the open range in win- |
ter. The cross is a queer looking beast j
with a body like a Galloway and a tail
like a horse. You see it, but you don't I
believe it.
"All of which goes to show that the i
■world is far from starving to death, and
that all estimates of the possible popula-1
tion which the world can support arc [
only based upon present practices and i
present knowledge.
"From time to time knowledge grows j
and practices change, which upset the
calculations of the pessimists. There are !
still many undeveloped frontiers. Civili- |
zation is largely based upon a narrow
belt that we call the north temperate ■
zone. The tropics and the Arctic still ■
lie, a fallow field for the future."

present knowledge.

and practices change, which upset the
calculations of the pessimists. There are !

zation is largely based upon a narrow
belt that we call the north temperate ■
zone. The tropics and the Arctic still ■
lie, a fallow field for the future."
The world is in no danger of starving
so long as the Arctic and the tropics lie
undeveloped, says Professor 1!. H. Cro
cheron. Director of Agricultural Exten
sion at the University of California.
Professor Crocheron recently returned
from a trip to Alaska, on which he vis
ited every important town except Nome.
He traveled 1,300 miles down the Yukon
and on all three of the railroads in the
territory.
Impressed with the possibility of Alas
ka furnishing food for the temperate
zone, Professor Crocheron says:
"Those who have predicted that Amer
icans would cease to be a meat-eating
people because of the lack of grazing
lands and grazing animals have evidently
failed to take into calculation the vast
territory which we call Alaska.
"This area, one-fifth the size of the
United States, has prairies measured in
terms of thousands of square miles on j
which certain animals thrive. To be sure, i
lhe winters are long and severe and the ;
earth is perpetually frozen below the '
surface thaw of summertime, but the i
mosses and grasses grow abundantly and
•over it vast herds roam at will.
"One firm has 125,000 reindeer. They
are marketing 5,000 carcasses a year at
successful prices and are now building
a canning plant and operating a refrig
erator ship.
"Caribou run wild by many thousands; >
one band of 70,000 swam the Yukon, j
blocking the way of steamers till they j
had passed.
