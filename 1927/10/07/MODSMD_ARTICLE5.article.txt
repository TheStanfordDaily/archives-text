## 
### 
Six of U.S.C.'s crop of freshmen will
be a considerable addition to the Trojan
track team unless they fail to repeat past |
performances.
Victor Fitzmaurice, all-American two
mile champion in 1926, is the shining
light of the lot. He holds the New York
City record in the indoor mile, stepping |
it in 4:36, and also collected the New {
York City cross-country championship. I
In 1926 he was a member of the four-:
man two-mile relay team that won the'
inter-scholastic championship.
Wchner, of Brawley, interscholastic
100-yard dash title holder in 1926, is l
another new star. He is credited with
9.8 in the century. Another touted dash
man is Rucker of Santa Monica. He lias
been clocked in the 100 in 9.9.
Howard Paul, who has leaped 24 feet
6 inches, is a new Trojan hope in the j
broad jump.
Ritchey, a newcomer from San Diego, j
has a promising record in the hurdles, j
John MacFadden, runner up in the ;
Southern California interscholastic meet,
is the best prospect in the quarter mile, j
He runs it consistently in 52, and has |
often bettered that mark.
