# Present Day College Football Discovers Historic Antecedents In Ancient Hellenistic Games
## 
### 
The football fan of today probably
lever stops to wonder where football
ame from, but truly it may be said
hat the game is a sport of great
mtiquity. Football, the most promi
nent collegiate sport in America,
thrills thousands of enthusiastic spec
tators every year. Hearts thump and
eyes are eager as two great football i
elevens run out on a lield surrounded J
by a huge stadium and are set into !
action by the referee's whistle. The :
shouting of the gay crowd is wild and ;
furious, and the players push forward ]
fighting for all they are worth.
The ancient Greeks played a form
of football which they called harpa
ston. The Romans played a similar
game. Julius Pollux, a Roman writer
of the second century, described the
game as follows: "The players divide
themselves into two bands. The ball !
is placed upon a line between them.
At the ends of the field, behind the
line upon which the players are sta
tioned, are two other lines beyond
which these two bands strive to carry
the ball." This description brings out
the fundamental basis of the game.
Eskimps Play It
Varieties of the game have been
found in other parts of the world.
Even the Eskimo played, using a ball !
made of leather filled with moss.
The style of the game played by j
American colleges is an outgrowth of j
English rugby; the two games still j
possess a few points of similarity. On j
the whole, however, American foot- j
ball has developed so far from Rugby
that an Englishman would probably i
be unable to recognize the American
game as an outgrowth of their popular
sport.
Football was originally introduced
to American colleges by Harvard,
whose team visited Canada and played
under Canadian rules which were
styled after those of English rugby.
Even before, however, in IS4O, to be
exact, football in a crude form made
its appearance at Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale. Only the freshman and
sophomore classes engaged in the
game, which consisted mostly of rush
ing.
The first intercollegiate contest in
America (this game antedated the j

firsat in England) was held between
Princeton and Rutgers, Nov. 6, 1869.
In 1875, Harvard played her then an
cient rival, Yale. In these first con
tests, the player held that anything
not distinctly prohibited by the rules
was perfectly legitimate. This situa
tion led to a rapid multiplication of
the rules.
Because of the roughness of early
football in America, state legislatures
were asked at various times to forbid
the game.
Mass Play Barred
In 1906, the rules committee intro
duced a change which did away with
the old mass plays. This change was
the ten-yard rule, and it had a decided
effect on the game.
Football has come to be very popu
lar; the game eclipses all other sports
during its season. For this reason,
football is a great money-maker and
as such helps to support the other
athletic branches of the school
throughout the year.
In 1913, American intercollegiate
football was played by 400 colleges
and 5000 schools.
In 1926, football history reached a
hitherto unattained climax when
110,000 spectators paid approximately
$1,000,000 to watch the thrilling strug
gle between the United States Military
Academy and (he United States Naval
Academy; the great Army and Navy
teams battled to a 21 to 21 tie —a com
promising if not a fitting result.
Three Undefeated
Only three teams in the entire coun
try finished the 1926 season without a
defeat or a tie. These three were
Lafayette in the East, Alabama in the
South, and Stanford on the Pacific
coast.
The 1927 season is opening with
brilliant prospects and hopes in a
great many camps. In addition to thou
sands of students, thousands of red
blooded American citizens will don
holiday attire, purchase a ticket, and
go to the game only to yell themselves
hoarse in support of their favorite
team. Traditional rivalry between cer
tain teams is responsible for some of
the popularity of football, but the game
itself is a great game. Distinctly
American, the sport is significant of
American enthusiasm. —Daily Kansan.

to American colleges by Harvard,
whose team visited Canada and played
under Canadian rules which were
styled after those of English rugby.
Even before, however, in IS4O, to be
exact, football in a crude form made
its appearance at Harvard, Princeton,
and Yale. Only the freshman and
sophomore classes engaged in the
game, which consisted mostly of rush
ing.
The first intercollegiate contest in
America (this game antedated the j

firsat in England) was held between
Princeton and Rutgers, Nov. 6, 1869.
In 1875, Harvard played her then an
cient rival, Yale. In these first con
tests, the player held that anything
not distinctly prohibited by the rules
was perfectly legitimate. This situa
tion led to a rapid multiplication of
the rules.
Because of the roughness of early
football in America, state legislatures
were asked at various times to forbid
the game.
Mass Play Barred
In 1906, the rules committee intro
duced a change which did away with
the old mass plays. This change was
the ten-yard rule, and it had a decided
effect on the game.
Football has come to be very popu
lar; the game eclipses all other sports
during its season. For this reason,
football is a great money-maker and
as such helps to support the other
athletic branches of the school
throughout the year.
In 1913, American intercollegiate
football was played by 400 colleges
and 5000 schools.
In 1926, football history reached a
hitherto unattained climax when
110,000 spectators paid approximately
$1,000,000 to watch the thrilling strug
gle between the United States Military
Academy and (he United States Naval
Academy; the great Army and Navy
teams battled to a 21 to 21 tie —a com
promising if not a fitting result.
Three Undefeated
Only three teams in the entire coun
try finished the 1926 season without a
defeat or a tie. These three were
Lafayette in the East, Alabama in the
South, and Stanford on the Pacific
coast.
The 1927 season is opening with
brilliant prospects and hopes in a
great many camps. In addition to thou
sands of students, thousands of red
blooded American citizens will don
holiday attire, purchase a ticket, and
go to the game only to yell themselves
hoarse in support of their favorite
team. Traditional rivalry between cer
tain teams is responsible for some of
the popularity of football, but the game
itself is a great game. Distinctly
American, the sport is significant of
American enthusiasm. —Daily Kansan.
The football fan of today probably
lever stops to wonder where football
ame from, but truly it may be said
hat the game is a sport of great
mtiquity. Football, the most promi
nent collegiate sport in America,
thrills thousands of enthusiastic spec
tators every year. Hearts thump and
eyes are eager as two great football i
elevens run out on a lield surrounded J
by a huge stadium and are set into !
action by the referee's whistle. The :
shouting of the gay crowd is wild and ;
furious, and the players push forward ]
fighting for all they are worth.
The ancient Greeks played a form
of football which they called harpa
ston. The Romans played a similar
game. Julius Pollux, a Roman writer
of the second century, described the
game as follows: "The players divide
themselves into two bands. The ball !
is placed upon a line between them.
At the ends of the field, behind the
line upon which the players are sta
tioned, are two other lines beyond
which these two bands strive to carry
the ball." This description brings out
the fundamental basis of the game.

Varieties of the game have been
found in other parts of the world.
Even the Eskimo played, using a ball !
made of leather filled with moss.
The style of the game played by j
American colleges is an outgrowth of j

Academy and (he United States Naval
Academy; the great Army and Navy
teams battled to a 21 to 21 tie —a com
promising if not a fitting result.
Three Undefeated
Only three teams in the entire coun
try finished the 1926 season without a
defeat or a tie. These three were
Lafayette in the East, Alabama in the
South, and Stanford on the Pacific
coast.
The 1927 season is opening with
brilliant prospects and hopes in a
great many camps. In addition to thou
sands of students, thousands of red
blooded American citizens will don
holiday attire, purchase a ticket, and
go to the game only to yell themselves
hoarse in support of their favorite
team. Traditional rivalry between cer
tain teams is responsible for some of
the popularity of football, but the game
itself is a great game. Distinctly
American, the sport is significant of
American enthusiasm. —Daily Kansan.
