# "TRICKY DICK" BARES INSIDE DOPE ON HOW HE MADE THE TEAM
## 
### 
The inside story of how "Tricky" Dick
Hyland made the Stanford varsity is of
fered for your approval in the Novem
ber issue of College Humor. Announced
as "an authentic story, by Adela Rogers
St. John and Dick Hyland," the tale
called "The Front Runner" has the open
ing position in College Humor's crisp
pages.
Micky Farrell was naturally cocky, so
the authors say. He had played sandlot
baseball in San Francisco as a twelve
year-old and even then was the cleanup
man, always making the spectacular hit
in the box or play in the field. Why
shouldn't he swagger, the story asks, and
we find ourselves unable to reply.
He came out for the Cardinal varsity
in the fall of what is obviously the year
1925, confidently expecting to be chosen
for the first squad. But Doc Foster, the
coach, quietly ignored him during the
weeks of practice, while his heart smoul
dered and flamed in anger and disap
pointment, because he was better than
the first string men. Foster treated him
as a rookie during the Oregon and Ne
vada games and failed to put him in the
starting lineup when the team journeyed
to Southern California to meet U.S.C.
But Pop, or rather Doc, needed speed
to beat those "big husky dodoes in yel
low-striped jerseys," so when Oemler
(who is this?) started dropping punts,
Doc sent Farrell in. It was his chance,
and he helped win the game, and two
nights later he was on the Channing
front porch on Jackson street, but the
butler said Jeanne had gone to Europe.
Which means that next month the story
of Micky Farrell in Paris will be vouch
safed.
Of course, nobody knows exactly the
ins and outs of the Warner-Hyland rela
tions, but whether the tale told in College
Humor is true or not, it gives some very
satisfactory explanations of some things
that have never been explained before. i
And who is to say that the amours of
Micky Farrell are based on fact? Prob
ably Adela Rogers St. John is responsible
for them, but they sound splendid, and
,very logical.
"The Front Runner" to the layman is
probably just another "rah rah" grid
iron yarn, but to those on the Farm the
story is intensely interesting because
everything has a familiar ring, and be
cause it deals with a subject which is
being given a lot of attention just now
â€”football, Dick Hyland, and Pop War
ner.
