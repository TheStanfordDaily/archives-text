# NEW BIOLOGICAL LIBRARY WILL BE OPENED AT HOPKINS MARINE STATION
## $ 100,000 Gift of Rockefeller Foundation Approximately Covers Cost of Two-Story Building 
### 
Continuing its expansion program,
Stanford will soon open a new biologi
cal laboratory as an addition to the
Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific
Grove. It will be named in honor of
Jacques Loch, the eminent biologist,
and the building will bear his name.
It will be a two-story, tile-roofed
structure, and is a gift of the Rocke
feller Foundation, which organization 1
recently appropriated $100,000, the ap- j
proximate cost of the structure.
It will be fitted with the most mod
ern laboratory equipment and con
veniences possible to obtain, which is |
evidenced from the fact that the \
plumbing and mechanical contract al- i
most equals the general building cost.
Near Old Station
The building will be situated be-'
tween the site of the present struc-1
ture and Point Cabrillo. It will be 150 (
feet long with two wings, each 75 feet
deep.
Construction started about three
weeks ago and the laboratory will be
opened about January 1. The wall?
are now well up and construction is
progressing with little interruption.
Upon completion, workers will have
at their disposal taps of hot, cold, dis
tilled, and sea water. Individual!
switchboards will provide students j
with direct, alternating, and battery i
current; suction, pressure air, and!
gas will also be at the disposal of each
worker.
The north wing will be essentially
the center of the research activities, j
while in the south wing there will be |

room for teaching laboratories and in
dividual laboratories for visiting
workers. The second story will con
tain stack rooms and a reading and
conference room for the library.
Laboratories Furnished
The research wing consists of three
main laboratories, one for chemistry,
one for bacteriology, and one for
physiology. Also a thermostat room
with a place for 8 100-liter thermo
stats, a balance room, centrifuge
room, and photographic dark room.
The south wing contains two large
teaching laboratories and three small
rooms for individual workers. There
will also be a completely equipped
machine shop and a boiler room with
suction and pressure pumps, motor
generator set, and hot water thermo
stat boiler.
Air will be sucked in from pipes pro
jecting 30 feet above the roof of the
building, for investigations on proto
zoal and bacterial content of atmos
pheric air.
Sea Water Studied
Sea water will be especially studied
is a biological medium as well as
being subjugated to a badteriological
survey by means of cultures.
The station will co-operate with the
U.S. Weather Bureau and the U.P.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey, which
would be extremely helpful.
Consideration is also being given
to the advisability of establishing a
small botanical garden, which could
be accomplished with small expense.
This would include a garden of named
and labeled coastal species.
