ITIIACA, N. Y —(IP)—Prohibition
is given as the reason for the closing
of one of Ithaca's oldest restaurants,
one noted in pre Volstead days as the
chief gathering place of the upper
class Cornell students.
It was one of four downtown re
sorts which were closed to freshmen
at all times. According to the Cornell
Daily Sun, The Senate, as it was
called, has seen more potential nota
bles intoxicated than any other such
place in the city.
