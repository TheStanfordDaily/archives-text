# FRESHMAN FOOTBALL TEAM FACES THIRD OPPONENT OF SEASON
## Squad Shows Improvement In Practices During Past Week 
### Merle Emery 
Going into action for their third game
of the season, Coach Husky Hunt's fresh
men meet the Santa Clara yearlings at
12:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
With only one game to their credit,
the Stanford men will have to play sixty
minutes of good ball in order to keep
ahead of the losing mark, as they meet
the strong Saint Mary's team next Sat
urday, and any victories they can count
before the Little Big Game comes in
sight will make them much more formi
dable.
Line Improves
The line, which showed up rather weak
in the San Mateo game last Saturday,
has been improved during last week's
practices. Bigelow has been shifted to
right guard, and Tampeke, who formerly
played at right tackle, has been moved
to end. Bogue in turn has been moved
up to till Tampeke's old position. Hunt
expects to strengthen the right wing on
his team which should give a better ac
count of itself.
Green will start at center and be sup
ported on his left by Heiser at guard,
Dohrmann at tackle, and Pike at end.
Winr.eck Hurt
Winneck may not start at his position
at quarter due to a wrenched knee. Just
how badly he was injured in Tuesday's
practice was not ascertained. In case lie
isn't able to begin, Saunders will take
over his position. With an original squad
of 107 men which has been voluntarily
cut to forty-five, the coaches have some
thing to think about whenever an injury
occurs.
Moffit, who made an 80-yard dash in
the Army game, will start at left half
with Harper at right and Hillman at
fullback.
Dawson, fullback, and Cook, halfback,
will lie ready to go in if things don't get
started right within tlie first quarter.
They have been bidding hard for posi
tions.
In practice Wednesday night the fresh
men first string eleven surprised itself
and the Varsity, against whom the scrim
mage was held, as it made substantial
gains and showed real power, as much as
a lighter and more inexperienced squad
can show against the best the University
has.
The Santa Clara beginners held the
highly rated 1931 California squad from
running up a big score in their 18 to 8
game last Saturday.

started right within tlie first quarter.
They have been bidding hard for posi
tions.
In practice Wednesday night the fresh
men first string eleven surprised itself
and the Varsity, against whom the scrim
mage was held, as it made substantial
gains and showed real power, as much as
a lighter and more inexperienced squad
can show against the best the University
has.
The Santa Clara beginners held the
highly rated 1931 California squad from
running up a big score in their 18 to 8
game last Saturday.
Going into action for their third game
of the season, Coach Husky Hunt's fresh
men meet the Santa Clara yearlings at
12:30 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
With only one game to their credit,
the Stanford men will have to play sixty
minutes of good ball in order to keep
ahead of the losing mark, as they meet
the strong Saint Mary's team next Sat
urday, and any victories they can count
before the Little Big Game comes in
sight will make them much more formi
dable.
Line Improves
The line, which showed up rather weak
in the San Mateo game last Saturday,
has been improved during last week's
practices. Bigelow has been shifted to
right guard, and Tampeke, who formerly
played at right tackle, has been moved
to end. Bogue in turn has been moved
up to till Tampeke's old position. Hunt
expects to strengthen the right wing on
his team which should give a better ac
count of itself.
Green will start at center and be sup
ported on his left by Heiser at guard,
Dohrmann at tackle, and Pike at end.
Winr.eck Hurt
Winneck may not start at his position
at quarter due to a wrenched knee. Just
how badly he was injured in Tuesday's
practice was not ascertained. In case lie
isn't able to begin, Saunders will take
over his position. With an original squad
of 107 men which has been voluntarily
cut to forty-five, the coaches have some
thing to think about whenever an injury
occurs.
Moffit, who made an 80-yard dash in
the Army game, will start at left half
with Harper at right and Hillman at
fullback.
Dawson, fullback, and Cook, halfback,
will lie ready to go in if things don't get
started right within tlie first quarter.
