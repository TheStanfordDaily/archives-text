# FRESHMAN WOMEN AT TEXAS LIMITED TO THREE DATES WEEKLY
## 
### 
AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. (>. — (IF) —
Freshman women at the University of
Texas will again be limited to three
dates a week, announced Miss Ruby
Terrill, dean of women. This regula
tion, says Miss Terrill, was begun
last year not for the purpose of re
stricting freshmen but simply to help
j them divide their time in order to
I reap the greatest all-round benefit,
j The strictness or laxity with which
: lhe "date rule" will be enforced is, to
j some extent, left to the judgment of
I the house mother, and where girls are
| doing excellent work in school and
! fcel they have time for more than
the three allotted dates in a week,
j r.liey will be allowed more. The basic
idea of the ruling is to please rather
! than antagonize the first-year students
j by offering them a more balanced and
| a more productive budget of their
time.
