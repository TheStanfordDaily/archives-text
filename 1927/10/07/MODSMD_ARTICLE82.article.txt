# COACH BILL ROPER WRITES NEW BOOK ABOUT FOOTBALL
## 
### 
Football is rapidly becoming a game
for the little man as well as the "big
fellow," according to William W.
(Bill) Roper, Princeton's famous
coach, whose book, "Football Today
and Tomorrow," was published by
Duffield and Company of New York.
The notion that a player must be
husky to excel at the game is no
longer borne out by the facts, he
asserts.
"Small me nail over the country are
making big reputations," Roper de
clares in his book. "Size or build as a
necessary factor in football is being
discarded.
"The little fellow is compelled to
face great odds. This has sharpened
and developed his competitive in
stinct. Things don't come quite so
easy for him. This means harder work
and therefore greater development.
He must use every resource, and this
means that his timing is often better
and surer and there is less waste in
everything he does.
"The tall, rangy fellow has a longer
stride, but he doesn't get there any
quicker, or get any more revolutions
per minute, as an engineer would say,
than the little fellow.
"Invariably the crowd is with the
game little fellow. For, after all he
exemplifies the courage and spirit that
warms the heart of the spectator.
"The utility of the brainy little fel
low is appreciated by the modern foot
ball coach who realizes that intelli
gence, skill, and speed can be con
densed into a small, wiry body. And
gray matter is not determined by bulg
ing muscles and deep chests."
