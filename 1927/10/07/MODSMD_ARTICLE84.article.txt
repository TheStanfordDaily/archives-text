# APPARATUS MEASURES RAPIDITY OF REACTION OF STANFORD VARSITY
## 
### 
Apparatus which measures the re
action time of groups of men is being
used to test the rapidity of the charge
, of Stanford football players. The ma
, chine, a multiple chronograph, is an
j invention of Professor Walter Miles
I of the Psychology department,
j Seven men are tested at a time.
| They line up inside a framework and
, at a given signal charge against light
j boards to which heavy cords leading
! to the testing machine are attached.
lAs the strings are tightened, a golf
i ball is released which drops and
1 makes an impression on a roll of
! paper. Each man has seven trials, one
I at each board.
Two groups of twenty-eight men
; each were tested and the average of
j the two groups was found to differ by
i only 3-1000 of a second, one group
1 averaging 394-1000 and the other 397-
j 1000. Members of the first-string line
were considerably faster in charging
than the others, however; only one
man was as slow as 400-1000 of a sec
ond.
Professor Miles expects to continue
his experiments and to eventually pre-
I pare a report on his findings.
