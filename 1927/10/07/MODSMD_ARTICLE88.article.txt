# HARVARD TURNS FROM FOOTBALL TO GLORY IN PATHS OF STUDY
## 
### 
Harvard, reconciled to its faded j
football glory, is finding new happi- j
ness in its selection as a member of :
the new scholastic Big Three. Toronto
and Swarthmore universities share in
the honor, which was bestowed by the
Carnegie Foundation for the Improve
ment of Teaching, in its twenty-first
annual report.
These three institutions, of all in
the western hemisphere, stand alone !
in their devotion to high standard
work, says the report.
It is significant, in view of the nu-!
merous educational experiments now
under way in colleges throughout the ;
land, that at the three institutions!
named there are being made "differ-1
ent forms of approach to the problem !
of selecting the able mind and guiding!
its intellectual development." These |
the Harvard Crimson describes as ]
"the tutorial system at Harvard, the i
specially 'selected' curricula at To-1
ronto, and the honor courses at !
Swarthmore."
Speaking for Harvard, the Crimson
says: "Despite the ideas of the old
school, college, for the public and for
a large part of the graduates, is no
longer a place to study. It is a place
that turns out athletic teams, and on
Saturday provides amusement for the
public and for its graduates. . . .
"Three institutions, at least, have j
been found where a good running :
backfield is not considered as import
ant as a good faculty."
