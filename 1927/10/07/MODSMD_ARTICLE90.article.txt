# CHEATING PRESENT IN OHIO UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR CLAIMS
## Psychologist Observes That "A" Students Are Not Among Offenders 
### 
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 6.—Do al
most two-thirds of college 1 students cheat
at examinations, either as a matter of
course, or if they are anxious about
grades? An experiment in honesty dur
ing an examination, conducted by Nor
man Fenton, psychologist at University
of Ohio, has produced the rather start
ling evidence that 63 per cent of a class
of women consulted their notes, asked
their neighbors for information, or
looked over another student's papers.
"When the instructor was in the room
and not especially observant, 31 per cent
cheated," says Mr. Fenton, in reportin
tiie experiment to School and Society.
"When the instructor was in an adjoin
ing room, 39 per cent cheated. When he
placed them upon their honor and went
across the campus to the library, 45 per
cent cheated.
Superior Students Included
"'1 hese proportions are especially strik
ing in this class because these students
seemed to be comparatively a rather su
perior group."
A close connection between the stu
dents' success in their class work and
their honesty in examination was found.
None of the students who rated grade A
cheated at all. Thirty-three per cent of
the grade 15 students cheated; 80 per
cent of the grade C students; and 75 per
cent of those who were in danger of
failing.
Only five of the students had been
under the honor system in high school,
and four of these women did not cheat
during the test, Mr. Fenton reports, even
though three were not particularly good
students. The one student who had been
under the honor system in the grade
schools did not cheat.
Student Honor Acquired
This is an optimistic note, the psepholo
gist points out, because it indicates that
student honor may be a product of train
ing.
"Until we are willing to provide spe
cific training in honesty in the examina
tion situation, beginning in the primary
grades, we will not be justified in ex
pecting honesty among students, or in
the too self-righteous condemnation of
lapses from it at those times," he adds.
