## 
### 
Aspirants to positions 011 the edi
torial staff of the Stanford Literary
Magazine are asked to meet the new
editor, Margaret Olsen, at 1:15 Mon
day afternoon, in the office of the
publication on the second floor of the
l'ress Building.
There are six associate editors posi
tions to be filled during the year; two
this quarter. A new plan of rating
tryoutees is to be instituted. Previ
ously much office work has been re
quired of the tryoutees.
Ability Rated
In place of this, the rating will be
made this year largely upon the ability
of the tryoutee to criticize and edit
manuscripts. Original work as it
comes in will be given tryoutees who
will read it and write their criticism
of it. Rating will also be made on the
basis of original work submitted by
the tryoutees themselves.
Out November 15
The first issue of the magazine will
appear 011 the Quad November 15.
The deadline for material is set at
October 31, and the issue will go to
press November 5.
Marian Farr has been appointed
poetry editor. She has been a con
tributor to the magazine and assisted
materially in its publication.
