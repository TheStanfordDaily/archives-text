# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
This nice-looking young man is an
Irish-American named Tommy Lough
ran who is to fight Mike McTigue in the
near future for the world's light heavy
weight championship. You may remem
ber that Tommy's friends raised some
thing of a squawk when the New York
state boxing commission handed Mike
the crown with their compliments after
Jack Delaney resigned the throne be
cause they—Tommy's friends—claimed
that he was the logical heir to it.
Tommy Loughran is one of the finest
young men you ever could hope to meet,
but I doubt if he ever has been, or ever
will be a great fighter. He is a master
boxer, there is no doubt about that, and
he seems to be game enough and ag
gressive enough, but so far there has
been no indication that he packs any
amount of dynamite, and you've got to
have a punch or you can't be a great
lighter.
Ring fans will remember a little over
a year ago how Tommy, invited to At
lantic City to train with Jack Dempsey,

showed up the champion's true condition
by completely outboxing him, tying him
up in knots, makin ghim miss by a couple
of feet, and bouncing punches off bis
! head and body at will. But in few of his
! one hundred or so ring battles has
j Loughran displayed much of a "killer
: instinct" or knock-out wallop. About
, seventeen of his opponents have been
| counted out, close to half his battles have
| been no-decision affairs, and he has lost
six, two to Harry Greb in 1923, one each
'to Jack Delaney and Young Stribling in
® 1924, and to Young Stribling and Ad
Stone in 1925.
As all the fistic world knows, it was
no disgrace to be beaten by Harry Greb
and Jack Delaney, and as for the two
Stribling defeats, Tommy wiped the
j memory of them from the books by de
! cisively whipping the Georgia Peach last
I May in Brooklyn. He has fought two
j no-decision affairs with Mike McTigue,
i and now his many friends are pulling
j for him to win the title from the aged
I Irishman.
