# THIRTY-FOUR GRAYS TURN OUT FOR FIRST PRACTICE OF SEASON
## 
### 
With a squad of thirty-four men
out, the Stanford Grays held their
initial practice last night under the
coaching of Hal Davis of tennis fame.
The Grays play their first game when
they meet the St. Mary's Goofs here
on October 22.
Besides those boys who have turned
out because of the varsity cut, some
promising new material is seen, Davis
believes. For instance, there is Mc-
Coen, who captained the Northwest
ern freshman team two years ago,
and Taylor, who was a promising half
on the Wisconsin team. The Stanford
boys who are sticking with the game
in spite of Pop Warner's selections
are Rehrig. Snyder, Wilson, Driscoll,
Fetzer, Laird, and Temploman.
