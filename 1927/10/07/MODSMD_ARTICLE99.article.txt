# Four Student Publications Offer Many Opportunities For Writers
## 
### Janet Post 
For those who write, Stanford now
offers remarkable opportunities in the
field of actual experience to supple
ment its regular curriculum work.
The Stanford Daily, the Chaparral,
the Literary Magazine, and the Quad
demand widely varying types of liter
ary ability, and positions on their
staffs, some of which entail substan
tial salaries, are open to all students.
Gain Experience
Practical journalistic experience can
be gained on the Stanford Daily,
which is run, as nearly as conditions
permit, along the line of a city paper.
Successful tryoutees are taken on the
staff as reporters. This position
brings them in close contact with cam
pus people and affairs and hastens
(he process of "getting on the boat"
as well as developing poise and per
sonality.
The next step is appointment to the
copy desk and then to the position of
night editor, who has complete charge
of one issue of the paper every week.
Night editors are in line for promo
tion to the editorial board composed of
the editor, the women's editor, a man
aging editor, and two associate ed
itors. This body shapes the policy of
the Daily, and two of its members,
the editor and the managing editor,
receive salaries.
"Old Boy" Humorous
What Chaparral wants are humorists.
The "Old Boy" is constantly on the
lookout for anyone who can write
funny jokes, funny poems, or funny
almost anything. Contributions ac
cepted in nine different issues make
a man eligible as a candidate for mem
bership in Hammer and Coffin and a
job as associate editor of Chappie.
Writing that more truly comes
under the head of "literature" is han
dled by the Stanford Literary Maga
zine. Contributions in the form of
poems, short stories, articles, book
and theatre reviews, and every other
type of literary effort are solicited
from all University students. Like the
other publications, however, staff
members are chosen by the tryout
system on the basis of the quantity
and excellency of their work.
Work on the Quad, which is pub
lished annually by the Student Body,
is an excellent extra-curricular activ
ity for those interested in article writ
ing and in magazine organization.
Sophomore Eligible
All sophomores are eligible to be
come tryoutees, and the trial period
lasts for an entire year. At the end

jof this time tryoutees are rated ac-
I cording to the number of horns tliey
have devoted to Quad work and the
i quality of the work done. The editor
I and the women's editor are chosen
by the Quad board from among the
highest on the rating, hut all try
outees who work till the end of the
j year are given some position on the
yearbook. All executive positions are
, salaried.
