# TRYOUTEES FOR DAILY TO MEET THIS AFTERNOON
## Aspirants Will Participate in Actual Publishing of Newspaper VARIED WORK OFFERED Chance Offered Journalism Students for Practical News Experience 
### 
Editorial tryoutees for the staff of the
Stanford Daily will meet this afternoon
at 1 o'clock in the Daily office next to
the Press building. Freshmen with jour
nalistic inclinations are particularly urged
to report at that time.
During the tryout period, those work
ing for a position on the staff will be
given an actual part in publishing the
paper. The covering of campus beats,
writing stories, rewrite work, and read
ing proof will all be included in their
work.
Previous experience in journalism is
not necessary, as tryoutees will have an
opportunity to learn their duties from
the ground up. Any students who have
newspaper experience will find the Daily
an excellent chance to follow up that
work, points out Frank Baker, managing
editor, who with Aileen Hicks, women's
editor, is in charge of the tryouts.
Quality of writing done and interest
shown in the paper will control the ad
vancement on the staff. Promotion from
the regular staff progresses through copy
readers to night editors and thence to the
other high editorial positions.
Work on the Daily will materially as
sist campus journalists to secure posi
tions as correspondents for metropolitan
papers and news services. The publica
tion of the Daily is carried along on
almost parallel lines with that of larger
papers, and experience on its staff affords
a chance to learn of the work in the same
field outside of college.
Through work on the Daily, students
learn of the workings of the University
and become better acquainted with vari
ous phases of student activities and the
University administration.
