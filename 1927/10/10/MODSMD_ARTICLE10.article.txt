# PACIFIC RELATIONS TOPIC OF WILBUR'S ADDRESS AT MILLS
## College Women, Supposedly Educated, Hence Modest, Avers President 
### 
"If Mrs. Stanford had not set 500
as the limit of our women students at
Stanford University, I probably should
not be standing before you today,"
said Dr. Hay Lyman Wilbur in ad
dressing the 600 Mills College stu
dents at their Founders' Day assem
bly Saturday.
"Now my task," the president add
ed, "is to reach all the college women
of the West and to enlist their co
operation in an understanding of
Pacific relations.
"College women," he added, "are
supposed to be educated and hence
modest. When the tirst conference of
the Institute of Pacific Relations was
called two years ago, a few women
delegates were invited with some
hesitation, but they were so modest,
and their ideas proved so construc
tive, that the impression gained was
entirely favorable," the president de
clared.
"I believe if each of you will per
sist in your work until you have se
cured your bachelor's degree, you too
will have learned humility and mod
esty, the principles upon which this
institution is established," Dr. Wilbur
admonished his audience.
