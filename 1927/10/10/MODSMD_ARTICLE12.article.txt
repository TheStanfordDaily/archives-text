# ODORIFEROUS KITTY SHOT BY INCENSED FRATRES IN MELEE
## 
### 
A rustic hunting scene was en
acted last night at one of the
lofty outposts of the Farm, when
members of the Phi Psi house
pursued, wounded, and subse
quently killed an active skunk on
San Juan hill.
The representative of Mephitis
Americana had been molesting
the Phi Psi's for several nights
past and also had been suspected
of having frequented the Pi Phi
front porch. A bonfire was start
ed by the brothers in a drainpipe
into which the skunk had crawled
to refuge, forcing it out into the
open. The animal was pursued
up the hill toward Dean George
B. Culver's residence, and two
shots were fired at it en route ,
the final one being fatal.
