# RECOVERED FUMBLE GIVES BRONCOS WIN IN YEARLING GAME
## Weak Defensive Play Hurts Cardinal Team in Fast Preliminary Tilt 
### Bob Speers 
Fumbles, a weak line, and a fluke
were costly to Stanford's freshman
eleven Saturday afternoon when it
went down to a 7-0 defeat before the
Santa Clara Babes in a game prelimi
nary to the Varsity-Nevada clash.
Cacanova scored for the winners
when he grabbed his own team's fum
bled lateral pass in the second period,
and dashed 30 yards around the Cards
for a touchdown. This lad is, by the
way, an exceedingly fancy player, and
deserves plenty of credit for the work
he did Saturday.
Line Ineffective
Stanford's heavy line, with the ex
ception of a few flashes of strength,
was unable to stop the Broncos with
anything like success, and the latter
simply sifted through for large gains.
The Cardinal forward wall did not
oiler much protection to the passers
and kickers, either.
Both teams fumbled with consider
able regularity, but the Colts were
lucky in converting one of their slips
into a score, while Stanford's fumbles
were usually recovered by the oppo
sition.
Passing Poor
Another thing which was bad was
the Cards' passing from center, and
it was very bad. The backs were for
tunate to get the ball on the second
bounce during the pivot men's tem
peramental spells. Weak clipping was
another reason for the Babe downfall,
while the Santa Clarans consistently
took their men out. The one score of
the day owes its existence, pretty
largely, to the fact that the winning
team knocked down most of the Red
shirts before they could stop Casa
nova's dash.
On the other hand, Stanford did
show some spurts of excellent foot
ball. When the line managed to get
organized it really wonted as it should,
and had no trouble In breaking up
the opponents' plays. The only diffi
culty was that this occurred too
rarely.
The game showed, too, that the
Babes have some class in the back
field. Moft'it is a hard man to catch.
He returned kickoffs, skirted ends,
an dhit the line with lots of power
and flash. Dawson, Saunders, and
Caglieri all played fast, hard football,
and would have done plenty with a
little more support from the line, and
a little better passing from the center.
