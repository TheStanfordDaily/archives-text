# MODERN MUSIC TO BE SUBJECT OF LECTURE, RECITAL BY BUTTLES
## 
### 
Modern music, from Debussy on
ward, will be the subject of a com
bined lecture and recital to be given
by Bruce C. Buttles of The Dominican
College at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow eve
ning in the Assembly Hall.
Buttles, who is extremely well
versed in the forms and tendencies of
modern schools, will deal with the
forerunners of our modern composers,
the transition from classicism to ro
manticism, and the general subject of
musical impressionism.
The modern French school, a cota
trast and comparison with the Ger
man classicists, the Russian Five, and
their influence upon contemporary
composers, will be dealt with in the
lecture; and the national, cultural, and
historical backgrounds with their con
sequent shaping of modern music will
be explained.
Butties' musical numbers will be
illustrative of the most representative
and distinctive modern types.
