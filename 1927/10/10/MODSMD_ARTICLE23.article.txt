# FIGHTING SPIRIT IS LACKING AS CARDINALS ROUT NEVADA PACK
## Blocked Kick at Goal Line Yields Score to Visitors On Referee's Ruling TRY NEW COMBINATIONS Sixty-Five-Yard Advance in Third Quarter Leads to Final Touchdown 
### Milton Silverman 
Stanford defeated Nevada 20 to 2
last Saturday, and such will be the
entry in the annals of football. But in
the opinion of many of the old grads,
the Cardinals are little better than
they were last week, and have lost the
fire and the fight that won the Con
ference championship for them last
year.
Merely three touchdowns scored
against a team that was defeated 54
to 0 by California the week before is
nothing to boast about. Most of the
time, however, the Cardinals were try
ing out new combinations in every
possible position. The regular first
string did not see action until only a
few minutes before the end of the
last quarter.
"Pop" Absent
"Pop" Warner did not see the re
sult of his new ideas, for at the time
he was a highly interested spectator
at the U.S.C.-O.A.C. game in Los An
geles. His assistants, however, will
have several things to tell him when
he returns.
They will have some pleasing in
formation about the punting of Wil
ton and Frentrup, and about the ef
forts of enormous Herb Fleishhacker
in leaning on the Nevada guards and
tackles. They can tell him that the
Cardinal line was charging fast and
low, and that the backfield defense
was breaking up Nevada's famous
passing attack.
Besides that, "Pop" will discover
that he did not miss an exciting game
at Palo Alto.
Long Advances Spectacular
Of interest to the local pessimists
was the sixty-five yard advance to a
touchdown in the third quarter, when
Fleishhacker, Hoffman, Hill, and
Frentrup rammed through, over, and
around the Wolfpack defense. Hoff
man made the first score in the sec
ond period, and in the same quarter,
passed to Murphy, who ran twenty
three yards to the second touchdown.
The summary follows:
Score by periods-
Stanford 0 14 6 o—2o0 —20
Nevada 0 0 0 2 — 2
Scores by touchdowns —Hoffman,
Murphy, Fleishhacker.
Goals after touchdown —Hoffman 2.
Safety for Nevada.

Stanford defeated Nevada 20 to 2
last Saturday, and such will be the
entry in the annals of football. But in
the opinion of many of the old grads,
the Cardinals are little better than
they were last week, and have lost the
fire and the fight that won the Con
ference championship for them last
year.
Merely three touchdowns scored
against a team that was defeated 54
to 0 by California the week before is
nothing to boast about. Most of the
time, however, the Cardinals were try
ing out new combinations in every
possible position. The regular first
string did not see action until only a
few minutes before the end of the
last quarter.
"Pop" Absent
"Pop" Warner did not see the re
sult of his new ideas, for at the time
he was a highly interested spectator
at the U.S.C.-O.A.C. game in Los An
geles. His assistants, however, will
have several things to tell him when
he returns.
They will have some pleasing in
formation about the punting of Wil
ton and Frentrup, and about the ef
forts of enormous Herb Fleishhacker
in leaning on the Nevada guards and
tackles. They can tell him that the
Cardinal line was charging fast and
low, and that the backfield defense
was breaking up Nevada's famous
passing attack.
Besides that, "Pop" will discover
that he did not miss an exciting game
at Palo Alto.
Long Advances Spectacular
Of interest to the local pessimists
was the sixty-five yard advance to a
touchdown in the third quarter, when
Fleishhacker, Hoffman, Hill, and
Frentrup rammed through, over, and
around the Wolfpack defense. Hoff
man made the first score in the sec
ond period, and in the same quarter,
passed to Murphy, who ran twenty
three yards to the second touchdown.
The summary follows:

Stanford 0 14 6 o—2o0 —20
