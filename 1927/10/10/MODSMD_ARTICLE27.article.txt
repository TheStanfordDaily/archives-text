# Clean Up the Mud-Fight
## 
### 
The complaining minority which does not like the continuation of
the mud-fight "tradition" was given something more upon which to
hang criticisms by last Friday's exhibition. Though almost three-quar
ters of an hour late in starting, the fight dragged on indefinitely. Viola
tions of the "rules" for the affair were as common as burrs in the
Lagunita lake bottom, for many of the contestants were thrown in three
or four times before they "retired from the field."
Friday's fiasco was an exhibition in more ways than one. Some men
were completely stripped during the course of the fighting and had only
the then welcome presence of their mud coating with which to scurry
about while they looked for a convenient bush. With several hundred
spectators, including men and women, present at these annual afifairs, it is
necessary that precautions be taken against such occurrences if the
mud-fight is to persist.
The date of the next mud-fight, if there is to be one, is almost a year
off. Enough time is furnished by the interval in which to forget the
evils of the last fight and thus allow them to crop up again. Some
precaution must be taken instead, however, to prevent this being the case,
otherwise the mud-fight will drop anchor in the port of missing tradi
tions.
