An automobile crash late Friday night at the intersection of Palm
Drive and the main highway has shown again the need for some "Stop"
an d"Slow" signs at this point. A "Stop" sign should be placed at the
exit of Palm Drive as soon as the post can be driven into the ground.
Five or ten minutes later two "Slow" signs—preferably of the red
reflector type —should be in position warning drivers on El Cainino Real
of the intersection. It may be the King's Highway though he isn't
using it just at present.

Postoffice. The noon rush may be bad but there's no need for adding to
the congestion.
