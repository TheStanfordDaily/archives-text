# The 						Bears' Double Victory
## 
### 
The Golden Bears took a double victory by virtue of the St. Mary's
contest —and both victories were more because of Stanford than for
any other reason. Stanford's loss to the Saints practically doubled the
public interest, and hence the seat sale, in the California-St. Mary's game.
Next, the effect of the Cardinal game upon the Saint players was ap
parent to the spectators. Not even the most rabid Blue and Gold rooter
would say that the St. Mary's team would have taken a 13-0 beating
from California on October 1.
