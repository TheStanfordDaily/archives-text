# The 						Small-Town College

Following is an editorial taken from a recent issue of the US.C.
Daily Trojan. The purpose of printing it here is to show how some
people look at Stanford, as well as to remind students that there is
something to be said on both sides of this question.
It seems that a great many people are lying awake nights worrying
over the magnitudinous question of whether a small town college or the
college in a large city is the best. As far as we can see everylxxly is
arguing in favor of their own particular Alma Mater, and if everyone
is satisfied, why worry?
David Starr Jordan, who is not exactly averse to a school called
Stanford (which, as you recall, is situated in a rather wee little town
callcd Palo Alto), says in a recent editorial: "A College should be in
a town so small that college interests over-shadow all others." Well,
that's all right, and college interests are quite important at that, but stillâ€”
you know there are a great many people who come to college for the sole
and only purpose of preparing themselves for the time when they get out
of a college, and a lot of small town college boys with oodles of pep and
college spirit have been lost completely when they got to the city.
It seems only sensible that a college situated in a big city with the
advantages of courts, and corporations, and everything that goes with
big business in a big city should be able to offer more to students in
training for that sort of thing. After all, even lectures can't cover
everything and good old practical experience has the odds to win every
time.
