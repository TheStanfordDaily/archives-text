CHAPEL WELL ATTENDED
The Chapel service Sunday morniug
was particularly satisfactory, there
being entertainment, activity, and in
spiration for all who came, however
various their tastes.
Those who observed the freshman
women gathered for the first time
found them ample in number and not
undecorative. The administrative
heads of the University renewed in
chorus their annual assurance that a
broad spiritual feeling of religion as
distinguished from sectarianism per
vades their official life. There was
standing up and sitting down to ease
the cramped and High Church beauty
and choral mellifluence to please the
esthetic and pious.
And to those unregenerates of
whimsical mind there was a particular
treat when the Registrar in a long,
black robe read the Parable of the
Ten Virgins to the "Five Hundred,"
who were the principal guests, and
followed it with the Parable of the
Talents.
That out of all the stories credited
to him who once asked who by taking
thought could add to his stature one
cubit these two should be chosen by
an official of a great modern univer
sity was doubtless not deeply calcu
lated but nevertheless tempts to in
cidental comment.

The ethical implications of those
tales are so devastating, for sheer sav
agery hardly being exceeded even by
that of the Prodigal Son! It may be
hazarded that the first story was in
tended to point for the solemn-eyed
young women that moral the Boy
Scouts use as a motto, and the sec
ond was to urge them to make the
best of their abilities. These guides to
conduct are not infrequently drawn
from the two anecdotes.
But see what else the parables im
ply. Ignoring the illustration of an
cient customs there is throughout the
suggestion of competition for sur
vival unrelieved by hint of idealism
or that charitable urbanity which is
a luxury of man. The reply of the
wise to the foolish virgins may be a
shrewd observation on human reac
tions or perhaps even on the essential
nature of living but it is a bit harsh
for the tender-minded.
The Parable of the Talents seems
equally severe, and in the version
read does not so clearly credit the
Master with that seignorial, if grim,
humor evident in the St. Luke repeti
tion. The sympathy of the Far West
American seems naturally attracted
from the Master whose idea of legiti
mate interest was a hundred per cent
to the servant who called him outright
a profiteer and took the consequences.
