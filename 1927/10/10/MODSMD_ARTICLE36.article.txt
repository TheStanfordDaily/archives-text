The Editor, Sir:
About this time of year when every
one is struggling to get rid of the sum
mer inertia and trying to get on the
boat, some of us begin to wonder
where the time-honored and venerable
traditions have gone.
Not so many years ago—some of us
still remember them —we had such
things as "The Encina Raid," "The
Poster Fight," and "Roughs' Day."
They are gone, not without regret, and
wo wonder if our other traditions are
going the same way or are just dying
out from lack of usage.
This morning there were actually
two Frosh who went down the Quad
wearing "dinks." They seemed rather
doubtful of the approval of their mates
and I suppose tomorrow for them, too,
the "dinks" will be gone. I have never
seen so many of the scrubs take to the
vile weed and Morey says that he is
losing money on his stock of corncobs.
Even the Law steps are no longer safe,
and as for "cords" —they are left, but
"How long, O Lord? How long?" It
is up to the Sophomores to put the
Frosh wise and make them toe the
mark, and as some of us feel —To
arms, men, and let us revive the wan
ing traditions of yesteryear!
