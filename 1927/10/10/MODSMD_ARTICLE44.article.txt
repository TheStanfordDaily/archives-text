# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
World aeries always bring visions
of the courageous, artistic pitching of
Christy Mathewson, and likewise the
annual fall championship games will
always be saddened by the remem
brance that this great athlete and true i
sportsman died during the Pittsburgh-
Washington series in 1925.
It is just twenty-two years now |
since "Matty" was in the midst of the
greatest feat of his whole pitching !
career. On October 9th, 1905, he shut
out the Athletics with four hits, the i
Giants winning 3 to 0. The great Eddie
Plank was Matty's rival, and Hartsel,
Lord, Davis, Lave and Monte Cross, j
Seybold, Murphy, and Sclireckengost
were the other members of Connie j
Mack's champions that bowed before j
the wizardry of Mathewson's great j
pitching. Three days later "Big Six" !
again blanked the American League i
champions, this time winning 9 to 0, |
and again allowing only four safe
bingles. Andy Coakley was the losing
pitcher on October 12th. Two days
later, this time in New York, Matty I
weakened to the extent of allowing
six hits, but beat Chief Bender and
his teammates in the series final, 2 [
to 0. He had not allowed a run in 27 j
innings!
Now skip to 1911, Matty's next world
series, Philadelphia vs. New York J
again. Matty beat Bender in the first
game, 2 to 1, allowing six safeties. In
the third game, on October 17, Matty
allowed nine hits in eleven innings
and was beaten by Coombs, 3 to 2.
But one of those nine hits was J.
Franklin Baker's second home run of
the series. The fourth game was
played a whole week later, due to bad
weather. Matty was taken out in the \
eighth, and replaced by Wiltse. The
Athletics won, 4 to 2.
In 1912, "Big Six" pitched the sec- j
ond game against the Red Sox, which
was an eleven-inning tie. He allowed

only five hits in the fifth game, yet
was beaten, 2 to 1. Then came the
heart-breaker on October 16th that
went ten innings and decided the
series in favor of Boston, four games
to three. In it Snodgrass made his fam
ous muff, and Matty lost again, this
time 3 to 2.
The following year was Mathew
son's last in a world series. He won
the only game the Giants could cap
ture from the Athletics, shutting out
Connie Mack's men with eight hits in
the second game, and winning over
Eddie Plank, 3 to 0. Plank got revenge
in the final on October 11, Matty los
ing, 3 to 1, and ending his wonderful
career of 103 2-3 innings on the mound
in championship contests.

the third game, on October 17, Matty
allowed nine hits in eleven innings
and was beaten by Coombs, 3 to 2.
But one of those nine hits was J.
Franklin Baker's second home run of
the series. The fourth game was
played a whole week later, due to bad
weather. Matty was taken out in the \
eighth, and replaced by Wiltse. The
Athletics won, 4 to 2.
In 1912, "Big Six" pitched the sec- j
ond game against the Red Sox, which
was an eleven-inning tie. He allowed

only five hits in the fifth game, yet
was beaten, 2 to 1. Then came the
heart-breaker on October 16th that
went ten innings and decided the
series in favor of Boston, four games
to three. In it Snodgrass made his fam
ous muff, and Matty lost again, this
time 3 to 2.
The following year was Mathew
son's last in a world series. He won
the only game the Giants could cap
ture from the Athletics, shutting out
Connie Mack's men with eight hits in
the second game, and winning over
Eddie Plank, 3 to 0. Plank got revenge
in the final on October 11, Matty los
ing, 3 to 1, and ending his wonderful
career of 103 2-3 innings on the mound
in championship contests.


"Big Six's" Four Series
World aeries always bring visions
of the courageous, artistic pitching of
Christy Mathewson, and likewise the
annual fall championship games will
always be saddened by the remem
brance that this great athlete and true i
sportsman died during the Pittsburgh-
Washington series in 1925.
It is just twenty-two years now |
since "Matty" was in the midst of the
greatest feat of his whole pitching !
career. On October 9th, 1905, he shut
out the Athletics with four hits, the i
Giants winning 3 to 0. The great Eddie
Plank was Matty's rival, and Hartsel,
Lord, Davis, Lave and Monte Cross, j
Seybold, Murphy, and Sclireckengost
were the other members of Connie j
Mack's champions that bowed before j
the wizardry of Mathewson's great j
pitching. Three days later "Big Six" !
again blanked the American League i
champions, this time winning 9 to 0, |
and again allowing only four safe
bingles. Andy Coakley was the losing
pitcher on October 12th. Two days
later, this time in New York, Matty I
weakened to the extent of allowing
six hits, but beat Chief Bender and
his teammates in the series final, 2 [
to 0. He had not allowed a run in 27 j
innings!
Now skip to 1911, Matty's next world
series, Philadelphia vs. New York J
again. Matty beat Bender in the first
game, 2 to 1, allowing six safeties. In
the third game, on October 17, Matty
allowed nine hits in eleven innings
and was beaten by Coombs, 3 to 2.
But one of those nine hits was J.
Franklin Baker's second home run of
