The Golden Bear, which last year
was the inanimate, furry plaything of
all its opponents, has been regener
ated and is now a wily beast, knowing
well where and how to get its daily
honey.
Or to use the prosaic and unembel
lished language seldom found on our
sport pages, California, which was
beaten regularly during the 19126 sea
son, has improved to the point where
it plays effective football and is to be
regarded as a serious contender in
the conference race this year.
Seldom is the precision shown Sat
urday by California exhibited by any
team in early-season games. Made by
California, rated the weak sister of
the major conference aggregations,
the showing was startling.
Perhaps the explanation is partly
to be found in the fact that Satur
day's was a Big Game, with capital
letters. More fans were sardined into
less space than ever were seen in the
Memorial Stadium before. The St.
Mary's shutout of Stanford the week
previous made the affair an ideal test
of what the Bears will be able to do
this season.
As evidence that California rooters
were thinking of Stanford when their
varsity showed it had the upperhand
over Slip Madigan's proteges, they
sang the Stanford Jonah song in a
hearty and menacing fashion between
the third and fourth quarters.
In an elaborate brochure done in
rotogravure a statement was made to
the effect that it was the opinion of
many that the result of the game
would determine the strongest team
on the Pacific Coast for 1927.
Stanford would prefer to say that

the one who will fight it out with
California for the confernece title
will be determined next Saturday
when the Cardinals and Trojans meet.
Warner's men should by then be in
form and able to demonstrate their
power, which up until now has been
very, very latent.
