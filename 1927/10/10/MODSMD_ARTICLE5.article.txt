# POSTMASTER WARNS STANFORD STUDENTS TO FILE ADDRESSES
## All Residence Changes Must Be Listed at Postoffice To Speed Service 
### 
"We are trying to give Stanford
residents the very best of postal ser
vice, and this is impossible unless the ,
mail is completely addressed," de- j
Clares Postmaster W. C. Werry of the j
Palo Alto postoffice and the Stanford |
branch. "Those who have not tiled
their addresses anew this quarter at
the postoffice must expect delay."
A new directory system containing
the names, addresses, and forwarding
addresses of all patrons is being in- j
stalled as fast as the pink cards con-!
taining the orders to change address j
are filled out by the students. Those !
who have not yet done so are re- j
quested to file these at once in order
to complete the directory. Hundreds j
of letters, addressed only to Stanford j
University and sent to students who ;
have neglected to file their cards, are
now going to General Delivery, and if
not called for are returned to the
sender. Fraternities are most lax in
this direction, and Postmaster Werry j
urges them to attend to it at once, so
that congestion in the office may be j
relieved.
For carrier service, mail should be i
addressed to the street and number; !
for boxes, the number should be on
the address; and anyone not included |
in these categories should have his
mail sent specifically to General De
livery. If this advice is complied with,
delivery can be assured within an
hour after the mail arrives at the
postoffice, declares Werry. A search .
for the address naturally delays the !
delivery.
