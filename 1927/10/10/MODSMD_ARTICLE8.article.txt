# FRESHMEN, SOPHOMORES, BYSTANDERS RECEIVE TRADITIONAL MUD IMMERSION
## Second-Year Men, Benefitting by Last Year's Battle, Employ Aggressive and Organized Tactics Against Inexperienced Yearlings 
### 
i Splash! and the first victim re
■ ceived his baptism of mud before the
I eager eyes of the spectators assem
bled to witness the latest annual bat-
I
, tie staged between the freshman and
sophomore classes for supremacy in
I the art of immersing the other fellow
in the depths of the mud pit. But this
victim was not La Barba; it was a
: quite bewildered and innocently in-
J quisitive black water spaniel.
Following this unexpected begin
' ning, the real fight started, and raged
with an annually unprecedented fury.
The mark of concerted action, La
j Barba, was one of the first to fall, but
i it was left to the next ingeniously to
j swim across the pit.
I After this the melee was general
! and impartial. The white sleeveless
| jerseys of the '31's, with their green
' paint decorations, and the liberal
i grease coats of the supposedly more
i experienced '30's lost all individuality.

Mud was the common dress of all,
and, as excited feminine shrieks at
tested, practically the only dress of
some. Even non-combatants who
crowded over-eagerly near the banks
came home bearing the spots, if not
the scars, of battle.
Sophomore tactics were on the
whole aggressive, while the freshmen,
densely ignorant and inexperienced
as they were, lurked close to their
own pit, and succeeded in coercing
not a few of their brawn opponents
to bite the erstwhile dust as they
were in the very act of seizing one of
the freshman number.
Tradition Favors '30
And so the battle raged. After an
hour's alternate immersing and being
immersed no one seemed discouraged
except the clothes involved. But of
course the sophomores won. They
had that "ball and chain of the past"
attached to their defenseless ankles,
and what else could they do?
