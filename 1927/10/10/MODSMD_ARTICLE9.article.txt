# SOCCER TEAM SHOWS LACK OF PRACTICE IN BEATING PESCADERO
## Raggedness, Bad Teamwork Mar Playing, Prevent Large Score 
### 
I The Stanford varsity soccer team
showed a lack of practice and team
| work in their game with the inexperi
j enced Pescadero High School players
1 last Friday, despite the fact that they
came out on the long end of a 2 to 1
score.
Time after time the varsity carried
J the ball down the field, only to lose it
i because of a poor pass. Silva and
' Holmes were the only two men who
! played a consistent game. The rag
igedness on the part of the rest of the
! team can be attributed to lack of
' practice, and the constant shifting
! made by Maloney in an effort to find
I the proper position for the most wor
thy of the fifty aspirants and a conse
quent lack of familiarity with their
new positions by the players.
Harry Maloney, soccer coach, be
lieves that by playing hard practice
games every Saturday and meeting
' high school teams during the week,
i the soccer team will be in good shape
i to meet California on November 5 in
j the first contest of the three-game
j series.
The starting line-up for Friday's
| game was: Goal, Hyde; fullbacks,
Holmes and Dawson; halfbacks, Fell,
jJacobsen, and Wright; outside right,
|Gibbs; inside right, Farewell; center
I forward, Smith; inside left, Silva; and
1 outside left, O'Donnell.
