112 Wateraian's
There's no reason why any
student should â€”because he
can buy a perfect Waterman's
for the trifling amount of
$2.75 and keep his con
science clear.
If you want a low-priced pen that
is as perfect as even high-priced
pens can be made, ask your supply
dealer to show you a Waterman's
No. 52.
It will write one word or one
thousand words with unerring;
accuracy.
