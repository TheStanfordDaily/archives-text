# VARSITY SQUAD PREPARES FOR TROJAN HORDE
## Hardest Workout of Season Scheduled This Week By Card Mentor DUMMY PRACTICE HELD Warner Scouts U.S.C. Team; Finds Centers Weak, End Men Strong 
### Milton Silverman 
With "Pop" Warner back from Los
Angeles, and less than a week remain-

ing before the coming of the Trojans,
the Stanford varsity is looking for the
hardest practice week so far this year.
For almost an hour yesterday, the
Cards were put through their paces
in dummy practice, and then were
charged and raced up and down the
field.
Only one man, "Spud" Harder, was
missing from the field, and reassuring
reports about him have come from the
Palo Alto Hospital. The wires on his
jaw will be removed tomorrow, and
he is already beginning to take an in
terest in life.
Reports from U.S.C. are making the
Card line buckle down to real work.
Coach Howard Jones, after taking a
hair-raising victory from 0.A.C., is
putting his two lines through enforced
scrimmage daily. In what will prob
ably be his starting lineup, he has
Tony Steponovich, a likely looking
sophomore, and Charlie Boren, for
mer varsity halfback, at ends; Jesse
Hibbs, All-Coast star last year, and
Jim Moser, 200-pound substitute, at
tackles.
Bert Heiser, another big bulwark,
and Chick Galloway, 1926 "Spartan,"
are the outstanding contenders for
guards, while John Fox, formerly un
derstudy to Captain Jeff Cravath, will
probably take the pivot position.
The second string line, which is
only called that for identification, is
composed of Francis Tappan, 1926
freshman captain, and Lowry McCas
lin, six-foot substitute, at ends; A1
Scheving, flashy substitute, and John
Ward, an unheralded gigantic sopho
more, at tackles; John Porter, 1926
fullback, and Alvin Schaub at guards;
and Nate Barrager, 1926 freshman
fullback, at center.
Jones is having most of his diffi
culty with the center of the line. He
is woefully weak in centers, and his
guard material is nothing to rave
about. At tackle and end, he has at
least four good men, but what these
four can do to stop Cardinal smashes
around center and guard will be of
considerable interest to both "Pop"
and Jones. The Stanford mentor has
been driving his men through the
center of the line all season, and by
now they should have enough experi
ence at such antics to wreak general
havoc among the Trojans.
