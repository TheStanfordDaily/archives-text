Freshman "Bibles," or A.S.S.U.
handbooks may be procured in the
student office at the Old Union any
afternoon between 1 and 2 o'clock,
according to Murray Draper, student
body president.
This will be for all those not receiving
a copy in the distribution at Encina
dining hall last night, or at ltoble
this noon Care will be exercised in
the distribution, since only one copy
is allowed per student.
The handbooks, which have previ
ously been published under the
Y.M.C.A., were this year put out by
the A.S.S.U., Frank Baker editing
the book. He was assisted in several
of the departments by Walter Camp
bell, and Winston Norman. Harry Call
was business manager, and Hardie
Gramatky drew pen and ink sketches
to introduce each section. There was
no advertising admitted to this year's
volume.
Included in the book are welcoming
statements from President Wilbur,
Dean Culver, and Dean Mary Yost,
track records and athletic scores for
past years. A general discussion of
the University, its ideals, location,
and regulations, precede the new
A.S.S.U. constitution and by-laws.
Articles on activities and a foreword
to the freshmen were written by the
editor.
A "Frosh Dictionary" and Stanford
yells and songs conclude the book.
The yells and songs have directions
for rooters, which were outlined by
Robert Fraser, last year's yell leader.
