## HIGH COURT CANCELS TEAPOT DOME LEASE ON FRAUD EVIDENCE 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10.—The Uni
ted States Supreme Court has can
celled the Teapot Dome oil lease on
grounds of fraud just one week before
former Secretary of Interior Albert B.
Fall and Harry F. Sinclair, millionaire
oil man, are due to go on trial here for
criminal conspiracy to defraud the
Government in the same transaction.
The Supreme Court decision, read
today by Justice Pierce Butler, re
turns this valuable naval oil reserve
in Wyoming to the custody of the
I Government and denounces Fall as a
1 "faithful public officer." The decision
ends the civil phase of the oli cases.
Next Monday Fall and Sinclair must
| stand trial on criminal charges based
on the same evidence that the Su
preme Court has just reviewed.
Decision Withheld
It was a surprise that the court
should make its decision known on
the eve of the criminal trial. In the
Doheny civil case, the court did not
hand down its decision, which was
equally denunciatory of Fall and
Doheny's dealings, until after Fall
and Doheny were acquitted by a jury
of criminal conspiracy on the same
evidence.
Whether Sinclair and Fall now es
cape punishment depends on whether
the jury takes the same view of the

Teapot Dome transaction that the
Supreme Court has just taken.
Culpability Undecided
Under the rules of evidence, it is
doubtful if the decision of the Su
preme Court can be directly brought
to the attention of the jury. Unless
the jurors happen to read the news
paper reports, or some hint of the
decision creeps into the trial indi
rectly, they will pass on the guilt or
innocence of Fall and Sinclair without
the benefit of the nine supreme legal
judges of the land.
Butler concluded that the Teapot
Dome leases were fraudulently made
although he found "no direct evidence
of the corrupt arrangement." The cir
cumstances disclosed however, "prove
the charge" in his estimation.
