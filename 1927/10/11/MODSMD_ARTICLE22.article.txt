# INTRAMURAL GOLFERS ASKED TO PLAY OFF QUALIFYING ROUNDS
## Tournaments Scheduled for Emerald Lake Course At Redwood City 
### 
Prospective entrants in the intra
mural golf tournament must be ready
to play off their qualifying rounds by
a week from Saturday morning, says
Coach C. W. Davis. This tentative
date has been set to allow entering
teams almost two full weeks for prac
tice before the eliminations start.
The. tournament will take place at
the Emerald Lake Golf and Country
Club at Redwood City. The proximity
of this golf course, as compared to
the more distant ones used in past
tournaments, should induce a larger
number of teams to enter, declared
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
athletics. Entering a team and having
that team on hand to play in the
qualifying rounds alone, wins five
points for the club or fraternity repre
sented by the entrants. These points
all count toward the yearly trophy
given to the organization having the
highest aggregate score in intramural
events at the end of the season.
The first rounds of the play-off will
follow a week after the qualifying
rounds, and by that time elimination
will probably have reduced the num
ber of entries to eight or ten.
The team scores will consist of the
aggregate of the two players' indi
vidual scores. For example, if the two
men composing a team make indi
vidual scores of 80 each, their record
will be marked up as 160.
Men entering the tournament must
make arrangements to run their
matches at times that do not inter
fere with curricular activities, for
matches cannot be used as an excuse
for missing classes, Davis stated.
