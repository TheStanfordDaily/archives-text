# BRUCE BUTTLES WILL TALK ON MODERN MUSIC
## Piano Selection, Phonograph Records From Germany Assist Speaker OLD SCHOOLS COMPARED Lecture Will Be Technical As Well as Popular In Development 
### 
Illustrating his lecture with a piano
selection and with phonograph rec
ords from Debussy's compositions,
Bruce C. Buttles, of the Dominican
College, will talk upon modern music
in the Assembly Hall this evening at
7:30 o'clock. Buttles will take as his
topics, "The Forerunners of the Mod
ern Movement," and "Debussy and
Musical Impressionism."
The Russian, German, and French
schools will be compared and con
trasted, their tendencies and modes
developed in a general and expert
resume of modern forms and develop
ments. Beginning with Debussy, But
tles will deal with the most recent
composers.
Contrast Made
Technical as well as popular in its
scope, the lecture will deal with the
harmonic development of the roman
tic school, the use of six-four chords,
the freer form now followed, and the
programatic development, as distinct
from the absolute music of the classic
ists. Brahms as the most formal of
the Romantics, will be contrasted with
more recent composers.
The French group includes Faure,
with his departure from accepted
modes and his tendency to classicism;
and in greater detail, the life and
work of Debussy, and his reaction to
the schools under whose influence ho
worked. His pianistic style will also
be dealt with. Saint-Saens and his
harmonic development and use of
exotic scales will be included.
Berlin Records Used
