# Money or Arguments

At the meeting of the Executive Committee tonight some progress
will probably be reported upon the rather ominous motion passed at the
meeting of October 4 relative to the "financial condition of various honor
ary societies." The motion was worded as follows:
"M.S.C.â€”7hat the President be authorized to appoint a committee to
\work with the Student Manager to report on the financial conditions of
the various student honorary societies."
Since the funds of all student organizations of this sort are handled
through the Students' Organization Fund it was felt that it was desirable
to have all of these societies 011 a firm financial basis. Various means
have been suggested to achieve this object, one being the requiring of a
budget with the provision for a reserve to be accumulated by next June.
This extension of power, if such it be, is taken from a grant in the
new A.S.S.U. constitution which in Article 111, Section 2, paragraph G,
gives to the Executive Committee the "control of, creation or dissolution of
all organizations on the campus which receive money from student mem
bers; with the exception of living groups and eating clubs." (Ambiguous
though it may seem, this does not give the Executive Committee power
to dissolve the University organization. That exception, Oswald, is noted
in the preamble.)
The question may arise soon whether the Executive Committee will
be justified in ordering the dissolution of a society which cannot show a
reserve fund by such and such a time (also to be set by the Executive
Committee.) One elate sugested for the submission of the budget is
December 1, though it is more probable that January 1 will be selected.
This budget must be, according to tentative plans, for the current year
and should indicate a profit by next June.
The thing for the honorary societies to do is to put themselves on a
"firm financial basis," so that if and when the shock comes they will be
more prepared than is largely the case at present. Those who will not be
able to see their way clear to such a desired condition by next June should
begin thinking of their arguments now.
