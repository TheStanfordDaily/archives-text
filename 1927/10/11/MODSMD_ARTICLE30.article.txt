Copies of the 1927-1928 handbook have been distributed to members
of the freshman class. The new freshman "Bible" is seen to differ con
siderably from copies of former years in that there is no advertising and
in the general make-up and contents of the volume. For instance, in
the chapter on "Traditions" there is no mention of either the Bonfire
or of "dinks."
Two opposite assumptions have been made here by the management
of the handbook. In the case of the Bonfire, it would seem that this
event has become such a fixture that its yearly continuation has put it
beyond the pale of traditions. The wearing of "dinks," on the other
hand, has become a custom so obsolete and little observed as not to be
deemed worthy of mention tinder traditions. Here is something for the
old boys of '99, '05, and '14 to speak about!
Whether the management of the handbook made the correct assump
tions in these cases remains for the freshmen to judge. Their verdict
will be expressed by the number of "dinks" worn and by the willingness
with which they co-operate on the Bonfire. The "fixture" of the Bonfire,
however, totters somewhat this year by virtue of the comments upon
drinking last year. Unless successful plans are worked out to curb this
evil the management of the handbook may have been correct by omitting
the Bonfire from the tradition list.
