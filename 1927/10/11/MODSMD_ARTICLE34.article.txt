# DR. TAYLOR WRITES ARTICLE ON WORK OF GENEVA CONFERENCE
## Relation of International Meeting to League of Nations Told 
### 
"The International Economic Con
ference" is the title of an article writ
ten by Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, Director
of the Food Research Institute, and
published in the Saturday Evening
.Post of October 8. A second article
will appear in the Post soon, under
Dr. Taylor's name.
Relation of the Conference to the
League of Nations, the personnel of
the Conference, discussions into which
it entered, and the resolutions pro
ceeding therefrom are the subjects
with which Dr. Taylor deals.
Non-Members Represented
Nations sending representatives to
the Conference, but who are non
members of the League, were the
United States, Russia, Egypt, Turkey,
Brazil, and Mexico, is the statement
of Dr. Taylor.
Reparations payments did not enter
into the discussions of the Economic
Conference because they had been ex
cluded at the instance of the Council
of the League of Nations.
Maldistribution of fixed capital,
post-war poverty in Europe, scientific
discoveries, higher tariffs, immigra
tion restriction, and the instability of
the currency especially in Europe,
were stated by Sir Arthur Salter,
representing the League of Nations,
as the principal causes for economic
maladjustment in the world of today,
according to Dr. Taylor.
Forty-seven countries had repre
sentatives at the Conference. Mon
sieur Theunis, of Belgium, was presi
dent of the Conference, of which Dr.
Taylor was one of the American mem
bers.
Taylor Lauds Geneva
Geneva, the city in which the Con
ference met, is a much better loca
j t.ion than London or Paris for such a
| meeting as this, Dr. Taylor believes.
Relations between employers and
! employees is a problem in which Dr.
; Taylor was particularly interested. He
: found that the standard of living re
ceives more consideration in America
than is the case in Europe.
Monopolizing more than its allotted
| time, the topic "international trusts"
| held the center of interest during
I many meetings of the Conference.
Dr. Taylor, who returned from
i Geneva during the summer quarter
! just past, spoke to the entire student
i body at an Assembly shortly after his
â€¢ return, concerning the International
I Conference then recently concluded.
