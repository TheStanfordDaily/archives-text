The Editor, Sir: This season the
Student Body is fortunate in having
three good yell loaders. They're alive
and seem to have plenty of pep and
spirit; they do what they're supposed
to do —lead the yells and not sleep,
especially when the team needs a lit
tle moral support. That's why I say
Stanford has three good yell leaders —
individually. But as a trio of cheer
leaders whose business it is to lead
yells in unison they're the bunk.
Stanford rooters get a lot of lectures
on getting together, acting together,
and yelling together, and yet I've
never seen a set of Stanford cheer
leaders who could get together them
selves and lead a yell as we would
like to see one led. One leader waves
his arms in perfect free style; the
next one is all cramped up; the third
is somewhere in between. One's arras
start to move before the second one's
begin; the third one is probably all
finished and ready for the next move
before the second leader is through
with the first part. The resulting yell
will probably be good—but don't look
too closely at the leaders; it spoils
the effect.
Stanford rooters are going to get

together and practice their yells;
they're going to practice their stunts,
they're going to make the Stanford
rooting section the best there js as it
has been in the past. It's up to the
cheer leaders to break out of a slump
and make themselves the best to be
had. They can do it; they've got the
spirit; they've got the ability to make
as good a trio of cheer leaders as
any of us would want to follow. But
they've got to stick together, they've
got to act together. Three men waving
their arms about don't make good
yell leaders —don't forget that the sec
tion across the way is watching our
leaders as well as being made to listen
to our yells. What they see at present
isn't any too good in the way of yell
leading motions.
In paying my respects to A1 Cass
and his assistants I'd like to ask if
they, too, couldn't practice their lead
ing just a little more to improve their
technique. We would all like to go to
a game and yell for a set of cheer
leaders who could really act together
—who could really lead a yell like
three editions of one man. ,
It can be done. How about it, Al?

technique. We would all like to go to
a game and yell for a set of cheer
leaders who could really act together
—who could really lead a yell like
three editions of one man. ,
It can be done. How about it, Al?

The Editor, Sir: This season the
Student Body is fortunate in having
three good yell loaders. They're alive
and seem to have plenty of pep and
spirit; they do what they're supposed
to do —lead the yells and not sleep,
especially when the team needs a lit
tle moral support. That's why I say
Stanford has three good yell leaders —
individually. But as a trio of cheer
leaders whose business it is to lead
yells in unison they're the bunk.
Stanford rooters get a lot of lectures
on getting together, acting together,
and yelling together, and yet I've
never seen a set of Stanford cheer
leaders who could get together them
selves and lead a yell as we would
like to see one led. One leader waves
his arms in perfect free style; the
next one is all cramped up; the third
is somewhere in between. One's arras
start to move before the second one's
begin; the third one is probably all
finished and ready for the next move
before the second leader is through
with the first part. The resulting yell
will probably be good—but don't look
too closely at the leaders; it spoils
the effect.
Stanford rooters are going to get

together and practice their yells;
they're going to practice their stunts,
they're going to make the Stanford
rooting section the best there js as it
has been in the past. It's up to the
cheer leaders to break out of a slump
and make themselves the best to be
had. They can do it; they've got the
spirit; they've got the ability to make
as good a trio of cheer leaders as
any of us would want to follow. But
they've got to stick together, they've
got to act together. Three men waving
their arms about don't make good
yell leaders —don't forget that the sec
tion across the way is watching our
leaders as well as being made to listen
to our yells. What they see at present
isn't any too good in the way of yell
leading motions.
In paying my respects to A1 Cass
and his assistants I'd like to ask if
they, too, couldn't practice their lead
ing just a little more to improve their
technique. We would all like to go to
