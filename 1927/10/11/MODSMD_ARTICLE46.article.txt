# FORMER ROBLE GYM HEAD RESUMES POST AFTER YEAR IN EAST
## “Wide Social Contacts Tend To Broaden Education” Says Miss Bunting 
### Janet Post 
"I've always had great faith in my
own line of work, and I've come back
with even more," said Helen Masters
Bunting, who has returned to direct
Roble Gymnasium after a year spent
studying at Columbia University and
traveling in the East.
"I have always believed in the value
of extra-curricular activities for de
veloping personality and building
character," Miss Bunting declared.
"Seeing the value that psychologists
lay on activities from an educational
standpoint has strengthened my
opinion."
Social Contacts Valuable
"Almost every course I took em
phasized the importance of social con
tacts," she stated. "The wider the
range of contacts the broader the edu
cation will be."
Miss Bunting specialized in psych
ology, philosophy, and history while
at Columbia and received her M.A. de
degree in its point of view.
Take Motor Trip
Miss Bunting and Miss Georgina
Burks, who also spent a year at
Columbia, started East early last fall
by the Columbia Highway route. They
traveled somewhat out of their way
in order to see as many universities
as possible on the way. Visits to the
University of Wisconsin, Cornell,
Smith, Wellesley, Mt. Holyoke, Yale,
Princeton, and Harvard were included
in their itinerary.
Miss Burks will resume her position
in the women's physical education de
partment this year.
