# SPORTS OF 1927
## Scotts in Sports 
### BY “FEG MURRAY, ’16 
There have been many famous
Scotts, of course, in history, literature, :
and art, such as Sir Walter Scott and |
General Winfield Scott, but if we :
delve into the realms of sport we find j
that the clan of that name is also j
quite prominent in baseball, boxing,
and golf.
The much criticized, yet most con
sistent winner among the British
heavyweights of recent years is Phil
Scott, who is about to try his luck in
a series of bouts in this country. I
say "series" with the hope that the
young man survives his first few,
which isn't likely, if he is patterned
after most British heavyweights, i
"Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled"
does not apply to Phil. He is too big
to mingle with Billy Wallace, who is
only a lightweight, so tnere will be
110 bleeding in a bout with that gentle-1
man for tliis Scott, anyway.
Phil Scott's chief claim to fame, as
far as one can gather irom a perusal
of his ring record, is that he out-'
pointed Tom Heeney in twenty rounds, i
But the fact that he was knocked out
by Paulino, who was beaten by our
own Jack Delaney, and also put to
sleep by Harry Persson, who was !
beaten by our Jimmy Maloney, seems j
to offer scant hope for his future sue-'
cess here against even second-rate \
fighters. He has hopes, however, of i
surviving a series of elimination bouts -
and then of being matched with |
Champion Gene Tunney.
There have been several Scotts in
baseball. Most famous of these is |
Everett Scott, former Red Sox and
Yankee shortstop, who played in 1307 ;
consecutive games. Then there are
Jack Scott, Philly pitcher, and four J

other "Scott" hurlers: Amos, Cincin
nati, 1901; Edward, Cleveland, 1901;
George W., Cardinals, 1920; and
James, who was with the White Sox
from 1909 to 1917, inclusive.
In golf there are Andrew, the Hon.
Denys, the Hon. Michael, the Hon.
Osmund, and Robert, Junior, who may
be an "Hon." yet, if he doesn't watch
out.
Scott of Wisconsin was All-Ameri
can tackle in 1920. Don Scott won the
A.A.U. half-mile championship in 191G,
setting a new record of 1 minute, 54
seconds.

Champion Gene Tunney.
There have been several Scotts in
baseball. Most famous of these is |
Everett Scott, former Red Sox and
Yankee shortstop, who played in 1307 ;
consecutive games. Then there are
Jack Scott, Philly pitcher, and four J

other "Scott" hurlers: Amos, Cincin
nati, 1901; Edward, Cleveland, 1901;
George W., Cardinals, 1920; and
James, who was with the White Sox
from 1909 to 1917, inclusive.
In golf there are Andrew, the Hon.
Denys, the Hon. Michael, the Hon.
Osmund, and Robert, Junior, who may
be an "Hon." yet, if he doesn't watch
out.
Scott of Wisconsin was All-Ameri
can tackle in 1920. Don Scott won the
A.A.U. half-mile championship in 191G,
setting a new record of 1 minute, 54
seconds.

There have been many famous
Scotts, of course, in history, literature, :
and art, such as Sir Walter Scott and |
General Winfield Scott, but if we :
delve into the realms of sport we find j
that the clan of that name is also j
quite prominent in baseball, boxing,
and golf.
The much criticized, yet most con
sistent winner among the British
heavyweights of recent years is Phil
Scott, who is about to try his luck in
a series of bouts in this country. I
say "series" with the hope that the
young man survives his first few,
which isn't likely, if he is patterned
after most British heavyweights, i
"Scots wha hae wi' Wallace bled"
does not apply to Phil. He is too big
to mingle with Billy Wallace, who is
only a lightweight, so tnere will be
110 bleeding in a bout with that gentle-1
man for tliis Scott, anyway.
Phil Scott's chief claim to fame, as
far as one can gather irom a perusal
of his ring record, is that he out-'
pointed Tom Heeney in twenty rounds, i
But the fact that he was knocked out
by Paulino, who was beaten by our
own Jack Delaney, and also put to
sleep by Harry Persson, who was !
beaten by our Jimmy Maloney, seems j
to offer scant hope for his future sue-'
cess here against even second-rate \
fighters. He has hopes, however, of i
surviving a series of elimination bouts -
and then of being matched with |
Champion Gene Tunney.
