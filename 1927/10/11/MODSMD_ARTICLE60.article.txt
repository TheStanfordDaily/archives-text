LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10â€”Dr. Mal
bone W. Graham, Jr., of the political
science faculty of the University of
California at Los Angeles, has recent
ly published a new book, "New Gov
ernments of Eastern Europe." Much
of the material for this book was ob
tained from the Hoover War Library
at Stanford which is probably the
greatest source for that subject in the
world today.
Dr. Graham says there is no possi
bility of a return of a monarchy of
the old type, and that it will be only
by continuous compromise that the
Bolsheviks can remain in power.
