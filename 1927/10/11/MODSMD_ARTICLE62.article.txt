LONDON, Oct. 10. —The American
Legion "Goodwill" delegates today
met King George and Queen Mary.
Filing into Buckingham Palace Mon
day to be introduced to the King and
Queen by Howard P. Savage, retiring
Legion commander, and American
Ambassador Alanson B. Houghton, the
Legionnaires and their wives were
filled with trepidation. But the King
and Queen met the Americans on
their own ground and made them feel
quite at home.
Most of the women attempted to
curtsey to the Queen, some achieving
a real success but others performing
awkwardly, their heads swaying from
side to side and their hands trem
bling.
