Evening
Grand and Glorious Feeling?
YOU, too, will soon be thinking of "stepping out" to
an informal dinner or dance and you'll be expecting to
wear that New Suit of OXFORD GRAY which you
just purchased across the street. But you're wondering
about your shoes.
BLACK THEY MUST BEâ€”if your appearance is to
be "right." We had you and such men as you in mind
when we included
BLACK HEATHER GRAIN OXFORDS
in our Fall Assortment
Your special attention is directed to a new model made
by Heywood of Worcester on the "English Togs" last.
It blends with an Oxford Gray like smoke into fog.
Moderately priced, too, for FINE quality at $10.
Other models in smooth or grain leather $6 to $11.
