# ODDS SOAR AS FUMBLES MAR GRID PRACTICE
## Famous Sophomores Remain Intact; Regulars Have Fight for Places SCRIMMAGE WITH GOOFS Captain Drury, Don Williams Lead Flashy Backfield Of Trojan Herd 
### Milton Silverman 
Fumbles during practice yesterday
caused odds to jump skyward in favor
of the north-bound Trojans. Not any
special men were dropping the ball,
but everyone seemed to muff it once
or twice, and as a result fumbles were
happening all over the field.
Four new backfield combinations
were working in dummy practice, and
of these, two at least will most likely
see action Saturday. Behind the first
string line were Hoffman, Wilton,
Hill, and Lewis; the second crew con
sisted of Murphy, Sims, Hyland, and
Fleishhacker. The Famous Sophomore
ball-carriers were still intact, with
Frentrup, Simkins, Rothert, and Jack
Murphy cavorting around together.
Lewis Calls Signals
On the first four are two triple
threat men, Hoffman and Wilton, with
the latter scheduled to do most of the
kicking. Lewis will bark the signals,
■while Hill can be counted on for all
necessary sensational work.
The second quartet, although not
including any phenomenal kickers or
passers, is just such a backfield to
plow through the Trojan line. And
then Sims and Hyland can add a lit
tle entertainment around the ends.
There is, too, the possibility that
Frentrup may be drafted into service,
while Rotliert's punting has caused
favorable comment on the sidelines.
Scrimmage Goofs
Scrimmage against the Goofs yes
terday showed that the first-string
four will have their share of hard
luck against the Southern California
backs. Centered around Captain Mor
ley Drury is an outfit of ball-toters
that rivals "Devil May" Kaer and his
playmates.
With Drury shifted to quarter,
Coach Howard Jones will probably
use Lloyd Thomas, 192G regular, and
Russ Saunder, freshman star, as full
backs. At quarter, substituting for
Drury, are Don Williams and Howie
Elliott, two of U.S.C.'s greatest ball
carriers. Max Thomas and Harry Edel
son are the best bets for fullback.
Thomas substituted for Laraneta last
year, but did not win a letter; Edelson
was regular full on the 1926 freshman
eleven.
Trojan Backfield Light
The Trojan backfield is an unusual
ly light one in this neighborhood.
With Drury scaling 185, Saunders 175,
Thomas 185, and Edelson 172, which
is almost too light for a fullback, the
combined tonnage of the U.S.C. backs
gives promise of a game with end
runs, off-tackle bucks, and double and
triple reverses galore.

including any phenomenal kickers or
passers, is just such a backfield to
plow through the Trojan line. And
then Sims and Hyland can add a lit

There is, too, the possibility that
Frentrup may be drafted into service,
while Rotliert's punting has caused
favorable comment on the sidelines.
Scrimmage Goofs
Scrimmage against the Goofs yes
terday showed that the first-string
four will have their share of hard
luck against the Southern California
backs. Centered around Captain Mor
ley Drury is an outfit of ball-toters
that rivals "Devil May" Kaer and his
playmates.
With Drury shifted to quarter,
Coach Howard Jones will probably
use Lloyd Thomas, 192G regular, and
Russ Saunder, freshman star, as full
backs. At quarter, substituting for
Drury, are Don Williams and Howie
Elliott, two of U.S.C.'s greatest ball
carriers. Max Thomas and Harry Edel
son are the best bets for fullback.
Thomas substituted for Laraneta last
year, but did not win a letter; Edelson
was regular full on the 1926 freshman
eleven.
Trojan Backfield Light
The Trojan backfield is an unusual
ly light one in this neighborhood.
With Drury scaling 185, Saunders 175,
Thomas 185, and Edelson 172, which
is almost too light for a fullback, the
combined tonnage of the U.S.C. backs
gives promise of a game with end
runs, off-tackle bucks, and double and
triple reverses galore.
Fumbles during practice yesterday
caused odds to jump skyward in favor
of the north-bound Trojans. Not any
special men were dropping the ball,
but everyone seemed to muff it once
or twice, and as a result fumbles were
happening all over the field.
Four new backfield combinations
were working in dummy practice, and
of these, two at least will most likely
see action Saturday. Behind the first
string line were Hoffman, Wilton,
Hill, and Lewis; the second crew con
sisted of Murphy, Sims, Hyland, and
Fleishhacker. The Famous Sophomore
ball-carriers were still intact, with
Frentrup, Simkins, Rothert, and Jack
Murphy cavorting around together.
Lewis Calls Signals
On the first four are two triple
threat men, Hoffman and Wilton, with
the latter scheduled to do most of the
kicking. Lewis will bark the signals,
■while Hill can be counted on for all
necessary sensational work.
The second quartet, although not
including any phenomenal kickers or
passers, is just such a backfield to
plow through the Trojan line. And
then Sims and Hyland can add a lit
tle entertainment around the ends.
There is, too, the possibility that
