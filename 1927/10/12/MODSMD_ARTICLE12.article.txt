# DEBUSSY MODERN PIONEER---BUTTLES
## French Show Influence of North African Scales In Modern Music 
### 
"Debussy is no longer considered mod
| ern, although he began the modern move
| inent," declared Bruce C. Buttles, of the
| musical department at Dominican Col
i lege, in his lecture last evening in the
Assembly Hall. "He initiated the first
| great break from the old romantic school,
using the whole tone scale, and striving
: for impressionism.
"Even Bach was considered a revo
lutionist in his time. As musical modes
■ change and progress all the more modern
! composers arc looked upon as revolu
tionary," Buttles added.
Debussy's Background
"When France lost her Alsace-Lor
raine provinces her interest was shifted
I to Asia and Africa," continued the lec
turer in sketching the historical back
ground of Debussy's technique. "Here
were found the whole tone scale, and the
scale based on the black notes on a
i piano. With the French capacity to ab
sorb a great deal and make it their own,
Debussy employed these new scales to
gain the mystical effects and represent
the artificial paradise he created for
himself. Later, fearing his work was too
misty, he attempted to define it, return
ing somewhat to the more classical
forms."
Buttles illustrated his lecture with se
lections from representative works of
Debussy, giving a piano number from
his "Vocal Sketches" and playing the
first and third movements from the
j .'String Quartet," and a selection from
the "Fetes" on a phonograph. Other
i piano numbers were "It's Snowing and
! Snowing" and"The Enchanted Garden"
j from Hurum, a modern Norwegian com
| poser who studied with Raff. This lat
ter was illustrative of the cold effect
gained by the use of the minor second.
Answers Questions
In answer to questions put to him after
the lecture regarding the appreciation of
modern youth to higher types of music,
Buttles advanced his opinion that young
people are particularly able to understand
and enjoy the more modern forms, since
they arc not subject to the inhibitions of
education in the older musical modes.
"America's spirit in music is the spirit
of Whitman, mystical, transtonal. The
lack of tradtions and folk songs has kept
America from producing much of note
so far. A real appreciation is here,
though, and will eventually express itself
distinctively," Buttles asserted.

"America's spirit in music is the spirit
of Whitman, mystical, transtonal. The
lack of tradtions and folk songs has kept
America from producing much of note
so far. A real appreciation is here,
though, and will eventually express itself
distinctively," Buttles asserted.
"Debussy is no longer considered mod
| ern, although he began the modern move
| inent," declared Bruce C. Buttles, of the
| musical department at Dominican Col
i lege, in his lecture last evening in the
Assembly Hall. "He initiated the first
| great break from the old romantic school,
using the whole tone scale, and striving
: for impressionism.
"Even Bach was considered a revo
lutionist in his time. As musical modes
■ change and progress all the more modern
! composers arc looked upon as revolu
tionary," Buttles added.
Debussy's Background
"When France lost her Alsace-Lor
raine provinces her interest was shifted
I to Asia and Africa," continued the lec
turer in sketching the historical back
ground of Debussy's technique. "Here
were found the whole tone scale, and the
scale based on the black notes on a
i piano. With the French capacity to ab
sorb a great deal and make it their own,
Debussy employed these new scales to
gain the mystical effects and represent
the artificial paradise he created for
himself. Later, fearing his work was too
misty, he attempted to define it, return
ing somewhat to the more classical
forms."
Buttles illustrated his lecture with se
lections from representative works of
Debussy, giving a piano number from
his "Vocal Sketches" and playing the
first and third movements from the
j .'String Quartet," and a selection from
the "Fetes" on a phonograph. Other
i piano numbers were "It's Snowing and
! Snowing" and"The Enchanted Garden"
j from Hurum, a modern Norwegian com
| poser who studied with Raff. This lat
ter was illustrative of the cold effect
gained by the use of the minor second.
