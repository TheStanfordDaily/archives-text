# REVENGE PLANNED BY FRESHMAN SQUAD IN SAINT MARYâ€™S GAME
## Difficult Task in Subduing Saints Anticipated by Yearling Team 
### Bob Speers 
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman foot
ball aggregation will be given the op
portunity Saturday of wiping off in
part the mark left on Stanford's grid
iron prestige a couple of weeks ago
by St. Mary's. The 1931 squad will
meet the Saint yearlings in the sta
dium at 10 o'clock on the day of the
Trojan-Card clash.
According to all indications the task
will be anything but an easy one, for
the visiting team will arrive with an
impressive record behind it. Last
Saturday the Bear Cubs were extreme
ly lucky to eke out a 14 to 7 win from
the Oaklanders, and the latter have
beaten San Mateo Junior College, who
held the freshmen scoreless.
Offense Perfected
Hunt has been working his charges
steadily since the Santa Clara game
last week, giving them scrimmages
among themselves and with the Goofs
in an effort to perfect a stronger of
fense.
Sport writers have time and again
excused the shortcomings of the var
sity squad on the grounds that under
the Warner system of intricate, re
verse plays it takes a long time for a
team to work smoothly. This same
handicap works against the freshmen,
and works even more damagingly, for
most of the first-year men have never
played under the system before, and
have to be taught from the funda
mentals up, while all members of the
varsity have had at least one year's
experience.
Another thing which is making
tough sledding for Hunt and his squad
is the fact that they are playing only
one game a week. In previous years
two or three contests have been ar
ranged each Saturday, so that all
members of the squad can get some
action under fire. This season, because
of a lack of funds, the freshmen play
only once a week, making it impos
sible for more than a few men to get
into the game.
Games Cut Short
Both the San Mateo and the Santa
Clara games had to be cut short by a
quarter to make room for the varsity.
This also gave the freshmen a bad
break because no game is won, or
lost, until it is over. Ten o'clock is
the time set for the St. Mary's con
test so there will be plenty of time
in which to finish.
An effort is being made to get mem
bers of the rlass of 1931 in the stands
to support their team. A larger crowd
is expected because the playing time
will not cut into the noon hour.

the time set for the St. Mary's con
test so there will be plenty of time
in which to finish.
An effort is being made to get mem
bers of the rlass of 1931 in the stands
to support their team. A larger crowd
is expected because the playing time
will not cut into the noon hour.
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman foot
ball aggregation will be given the op
portunity Saturday of wiping off in
part the mark left on Stanford's grid
iron prestige a couple of weeks ago
by St. Mary's. The 1931 squad will
meet the Saint yearlings in the sta
dium at 10 o'clock on the day of the
Trojan-Card clash.
According to all indications the task
will be anything but an easy one, for
the visiting team will arrive with an
impressive record behind it. Last
Saturday the Bear Cubs were extreme
ly lucky to eke out a 14 to 7 win from
the Oaklanders, and the latter have
beaten San Mateo Junior College, who
held the freshmen scoreless.
Offense Perfected
Hunt has been working his charges
steadily since the Santa Clara game
last week, giving them scrimmages
among themselves and with the Goofs
in an effort to perfect a stronger of
fense.
Sport writers have time and again
excused the shortcomings of the var
sity squad on the grounds that under
the Warner system of intricate, re
verse plays it takes a long time for a
team to work smoothly. This same
handicap works against the freshmen,
and works even more damagingly, for
most of the first-year men have never
played under the system before, and
have to be taught from the funda
mentals up, while all members of the
varsity have had at least one year's
experience.
Another thing which is making
tough sledding for Hunt and his squad
is the fact that they are playing only
one game a week. In previous years
two or three contests have been ar
ranged each Saturday, so that all
members of the squad can get some
action under fire. This season, because
of a lack of funds, the freshmen play
only once a week, making it impos
sible for more than a few men to get
into the game.
Games Cut Short
Both the San Mateo and the Santa
Clara games had to be cut short by a
quarter to make room for the varsity.
This also gave the freshmen a bad
break because no game is won, or
lost, until it is over. Ten o'clock is
the time set for the St. Mary's con
test so there will be plenty of time
in which to finish.
