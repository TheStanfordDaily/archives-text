# Reorganizing Conferences
## 
### 
The break-up last month of the Missouri Valley Conference has
brought to the attention of other athletic organizations that permanency
is not an inherent characteristic of such groups of colleges. One of the
reasons given for the withdrawal of six of the leading teams in the
Missouri Valley Conference was that the admission of weak teams had
brought about the dissatisfaction.
That there is a natural tendency to admit teams of an inferior caliber
is clear. Smaller colleges, situated in the geographical location embraced
by a strong conference group, often adopt the "left out" attitude and
leave no stone unturned until they are allowed to join the organized ranks
of larger and better coached institutions. Had St. Mary's defeated
California it would have had claim to the title of "uncrowned champion
of the Pacific Coast." Such an event would, to the casual sport fan of
the Middle or Eastern states, tend to minimize the laurels of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
Other things besides athletics are considered in the matter of ad
mitting new members to a conference. The matter of scholarship and
eligibility rules, together with the obtaining of consent of member teams,
must be considered. With these reasons conference teams, be they mem
bers of the Big Ten, Little Three, or what not, hold down memberships
in their organization. Despite such efforts a natural increase in the
number of colleges has been apparent throughout the country.
Few conferences have maintained their limited group number and
still grown in prestige as has the Big Ten. An exactly opposite result
came about some time ago in the Big Three with the Harvard-Princeton
break which had been preceded by a deterioration in the quality of the
Harvard teams, though this may not be cited as the reason for the split.
Conferences, to establish and maintain prestige, should be of such a
size that stagnation will not result as, we suspect, was the trouble with
the Big Three, and should maintain a fixed membership unless the
quality of schools applying for membership is equal to that of the con
ference members. St. Mary's recognizes the difficulties of drawing up
suitable conference memberships. It is content to try to topple Coast
title-holders from their throne. Last year the Saints defeated California,
this year Stanford bowed before them; year by year the Saints turn out
good teams, notably in football and baseball. The time may not be far
off when St. Mary's will be a factor to consider in lining up conference
memberships.

Harvard teams, though this may not be cited as the reason for the split.
Conferences, to establish and maintain prestige, should be of such a
size that stagnation will not result as, we suspect, was the trouble with
the Big Three, and should maintain a fixed membership unless the
quality of schools applying for membership is equal to that of the con
ference members. St. Mary's recognizes the difficulties of drawing up
suitable conference memberships. It is content to try to topple Coast
title-holders from their throne. Last year the Saints defeated California,
this year Stanford bowed before them; year by year the Saints turn out
good teams, notably in football and baseball. The time may not be far
off when St. Mary's will be a factor to consider in lining up conference
memberships.
