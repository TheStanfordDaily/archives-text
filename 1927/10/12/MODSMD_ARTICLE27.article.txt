# Let There Be Light

Members of the A.S.S.U. have now had ten days in which to become
accustomed to the new student body constitution which was accepted by
vote last spring. To the proverbial ninety-nine and forty-four one
hundredths per cent of the students no perceptible change has occurred.
It is, however, time now that managers of various student organizations
should realize exactly what interpretations will be placed on various rules
listed in this new constitution in order that plans of theirs may not
go awry.
The old precedents of the former constitution and by-laws have been
swept away; new ones are being formed from which will develop cus
toms and then rules, with a gradual and probably unnoticed accumulation
of power originally not intended in this constitution.
A new set of managers each year for various student organizations
are apt to let little things slide year by year and by virtue of custom and
precedent to make things hard for their successors in some future time.
The present is not too soon to have a clear and definite understanding of
powers and rights under the new A.S.S.U. constitution. Co-operation
between all student officials must be brought about.
