# A 						Change in the Masthead
## 
### 
Word lias come that Jack Springer, who was recently appointed asso
ciate editor of the Daily, will be unable to return to the University this
quarter because of illness. His loss will be felt by the entire staff and it
was with regret that his letter with this news was read at the staff meeting
today. To fill his place, Herbert Klein will become associate editor. Klein
has held a night editor's position for over a year and is a writer of talent.
His chief task in his new office will be the management of the United
Press Association news which the newspaper receives daily. Assisting
him in this work will be Miss Elsa Krotozyncr and Gale Wallace.
