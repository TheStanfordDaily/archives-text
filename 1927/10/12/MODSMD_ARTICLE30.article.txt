A PLEA FOR PEACE
Such has been the influence of light
opera and lighter fiction that it is
hard for the ordinary person to visu
alize seriously a war in Central Amer
ica or. in the Balkans. This in spite of
the fact that we read of fighting in
those places most of the time. It
always seems the combatants must be
only movie extras in Chocolate Sol
dier uniforms, carrying popguns but
never drawing real sticky blood.
Now the diplomats are going
through the preliminary motions for
what could possibly be a new Euro
pean or even World War, and it just
sounds absurd. Some general or other
was shot. What of it; haven't they
lots more? If their archdukes and the
rest of the gold braid brigade can't
keep out of trouble let them come to

this country and be killed by auto
mobiles, decently and without inter
national complications.
In comparison with the larger issue
of preserving what civilization we
have and continuing the million and
one normal daily activities of human
ity such threatful phrases as "main
taining prestige" and "ultimatums"
seem childish. Can't somebody just
spank those Balkans or put them to
bed without any supper? It would
save no end of learning difficult
names in case we should have to go
over there to aid a violated Lithuania
or protect our homes and firesides
from barbarous Bulgarians a few
months from now.
Besides, saving the world again
would be an awful nuisance right in
the middle of the football season!
