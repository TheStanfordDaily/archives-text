# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Concerning a recent editorial which
appeared in the Stanford Daily it
might be well to express another
opinion along the same line. The ques
tion is: Which is better, a university
in a large city or one adjacent to a
small town? It is evident that the
writer of the editorial failed to per
ceive the true nature of the subject.
It is not a question of one being bet
ter than the other. They are both
necessary, perhaps, and in the long
run subject to the preference of the
individual. But to one who is aware
that the city is beginning to disinte
grate our civilization just as it did
that of Rome the country college is
inevitably the first choice. The city
must constantly recruit new material
from the country. When that source
fails the city is doomed. —'31.

The Editor, Sir:
We're off again, I see. A tradition
that is rapidly taking its place in ven
eration with Jim '28's Encina Raid is
that of the annual "Campus Opinion"
jabber about traditions.
By the way, I was just thinking
what a long time ago it was that
Encina became the freshman dormi
tory, and the "Encina Raid" raised its
hoary(!) head —but that's neither
here nor there.
Neither is my poor personal belief
that Stanford traditions should spring
somewhat spontaneously from the im
pulses of Stanford men and women.

The Editor, Sirrah:
A brash farmhand would like to
offer a few suggestions to the Rally
Committee or whoever is responsible
for organized whooping at our games.
They are given in a spirit of helpful
fun, and with the hope that some ef
fect may show at this evening's U.S.C.
rally:
1. Why Is it necessary, just after
the final strains of our excellent Hymn
have died, and when three thousand
students are standing, bare-headed, at
the most impressive moment of the
day, for us to ruin the whole effect by
the "Varsity" yell which some reptile
established as tradition? The yell, fol
lowing the song, is an anticlimax. It
ruins everything.
2. Must we keep on singing, "Down

with the Gold and Blue," regardless
of the team we play or the colors they
bear? If, for example, the opponents'
colors are green and yellow, this line
of the song sounds like nothing if not
foolishness. A slight change in word
ing to suit color change would be
easily arranged, and would involve no
particular mental strain for us
patriots.
3. Two or three yells end with
"Stanford" repeated three times. Why
should the third repetition be "Stan-
FORD!" — providing a sort of left
handed advertisement for a well
known make of automobile? Or per
haps the writer is the only one who
is bothered by this. At any rate, it is
easier and much fore effective as fol
lows: "Stanford! Stanford! STAN
FORD!" —F. 0.8.
