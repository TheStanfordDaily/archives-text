BRASS TACKS

The Stanford varsity apparently
has knuckled down to business.
Secret practices this week show
the men have assimilated the
finer points of play, and the for
mations and their execution con
stantly are getting smoother.
Freshmen going hard after their
citizenship assignments could be
no more determined than are
the fifty-three Whiteshirts under
Pop Warner. They knit their
brows chronically and swear a
good deal when things go hay
wire.
No need to fear overconfidence
in the U.S.C. fray Saturday, if
the men keep in their present
state of mind. The early season
reverse at the hands of St.
Mary's assures that. Also the
widespread opinions of dopesters
favoring U.S.C.
Complaints of the Union dining
room food may from time to time
sound ominous, but the fact that
forty-one of the entire varsity squad
enthusiastically elected to dine at a
training table in the Union from now
on during the season is a good sales
argument for any chop house. The
only stipulation Pop Warner made
when he announced last night that
the table would be organized was
that the men should not throw buns
and butter on the ceiling.
Spud Harder, whose jaw was
broken in the St. Mary's game,
watched practice yesterday. The
wires are to be removed from
his teeth today. Spud insists he
will be in the lineup of the Big
Game, although he is still in the
Palo Alto hospital.
John Gifford, tackle, is run
ning through signal practice but
is unable to indulge in scrim
mages, on account of a broken
nose. He got his wound stripe
in the Nevada battle.
Pop Warner devoted an hour or
two after training table last night
to a lecture and demonstration of
the Trojans' plays by motion pic
ture.
Question : When is Pop going to
use Technical Director Dick Hvland's
great film drama, "The Drop Kick,"
in his skull work sessions?
