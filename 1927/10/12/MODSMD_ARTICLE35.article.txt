## 
### Sylva Weaver 
There will bo Hard Times tomorrow
night at the Women's Conference
Party when the old women greet the
new women in that particular type
of apparel known to connoisseurs of
costumes as "hard time" garb.
On the stroke of 7:15 the Women's
Clubhouse will be opened by a group
of strangely dressed people, other
wise known in Stanford circles as
the Women's Council. They will be
eager to receive and entertain the
new women who have yet to be initi
ated into the pleasures and mys
teries of a Women's Conference Party.
Entertain New Women
As soon as the complete live-hundred
have assembled, and the Clubhouse
begins to take on the air of a moving
picture Bowery cafe, the lights will
suddenly Hash on the stage, and tlie
program will begin.
Margaret Mudgett, chairman of the
social committee, who will probably
be distinguishable from the other
mortals present by her unconvention
ality in appearing in regular campus
clothes, will preside over the meeting.
Davidson Speaks
Eleanor Davidson, president of As
sociated Women Students, will extend
a cordial welcome to the new women,
and tell them a little about Stanford
so that the way before them may be
made more easy. Barbara Fenwick,
president of the Women's Athletic
Association, will begin the story of
the joys of athletic life, while Miss
Helen Bunting, head of Roble Gymna
sium, will complete the narrative.
The program will be concluded by
a skit which is being arranged by
the Masquers Society. To show the
complete democracy which prevails
over the Farm, Masquers is choosing
the actresses for this skit from every
living group on the campus. It will be
truly representative.
During the program the Apache at
mosphere of the Clubhouse will be
very still and attentive; but when
the bands of social convention are
broken, and the program is finished,
then the shouting and (he music will
begin. And it will be long and merry
and jolly—even if one does have to
pay ten cents for a live-cent ice cream
cone.
