## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Oct. 11.â€”Born, bap
tized, presented to the Ministers of
State, anft acclaimed by a joyful na
tion all within the span of twelve
hours, Belgium's new princess has
survived her first day on earth with a
ceremony befitting the sturdy stock
of her royal ancestors.
Tuesday was a big day for the
daughter of Belgium's beautiful Crown
Princess, Astrid, and Prince Leopold.
She came into the world at 8:15 a.m.
and scarcely had emitted her first
wail until the booming of 51 guns
informed the populace that she was
here. With the birth of the Princess,
the line of succession of one of the
finest monarchies in the world, but
one of the most stable, continues as
before. Prince Leopold is heir to the
throne and in the event of his death
while King, the throne would revert
to his younger brother, Prince
Charles.
