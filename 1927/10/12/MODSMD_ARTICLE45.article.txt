## 
### 
ROOSEVELT FIELD, N.Y., Oct. 11.
â€”Miss Ruth Eldei- and Captain
George Haldeman, in Miss Elder's air
plane, "American Girl," sailed away
from Roosevelt Field at dusk today
on their long-heralded attempt at a
non-stop flight to Paris.
The plane rose from the long run
way which Lindbergh, Chamberlin,
and Byrd had used in their flights to
Europe and fame, at 5:04 p.m. The
first effort of an American girl to cross
the Atlantic Ocean nad been delayed
for several hours by a southeast wind,
and it was not until sunset that the
take-off was made.
