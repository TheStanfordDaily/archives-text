# U.S. INDIFFERENT TO FLIGHT

### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11. â€”Person-
ally and officially, America seems to
have turned its back on recent air
tragedies and with apparent indiffer
ence is watching attempts of Mrs.
Frances Grayson and Miss Ruth Elder
to span the Atlantic.
A month ago the ffro projected
flights would have brought a storm of
protest to the War Department, Navy
and Commerce Department, and the
National Aeronautic Association. To
day not a murmur of complaint was
heard in official circles.
