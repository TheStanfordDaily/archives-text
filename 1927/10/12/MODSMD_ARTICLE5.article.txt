the Sword and Sandals play. Lucie
Bentley will play the Lady of the Rose
and Olga Spirito will take the part
of Lorraine. Howard McCone will take
the male lead. The cast also includes

Lucie Bentley is well-known in cam
pus dramatics, and has taken part in
both of the last two junior operas, in
"Hay Fever," "In the Next Room,"
"Dear Brutus," and others. Olga Spir
ito appeared in the lead of the Dance
Drama last year.
Homard McCone will make his first
appearance in a dramatic production
on this campus with this play. Mc-
Cone is a transfer student from South
wark, Pennsylvania, where he had ex
perience in some of Synge's Irish
plays, and some of O'Neil's.
Carpenter and Hurt will be remem
bered for their parts in last year's
"Wicked William," where Carpenter
was cast as the movie hero, and Hurt
as the producer, Buchowitz. The char
acter of Lubin offers Hurt excellent
opportunities for characterization, in
the role of a Jewish theatrical pro
ducer. Lubin is perhaps one of the
best characterizations of the type in
contemporary dramas, since he is pre
sented without sentiment, and com
pletely "de-theatreized" from the tra
ditional and hackneyed figure of a
producer.
