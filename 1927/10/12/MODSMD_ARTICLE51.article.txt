# SPORTS OF 1927
## Big-Jawed Athletes 
### BY “FEG MURRAY, ’16 
This is the anniversary of the land
ing of Columbus, and though most
contemporary portraits show the gen
tleman with a beard, I am sure that
he had a fighting jaw, because it took
plenty of nerve and rugged determina
tion to accomplish what that daring
Italian did. Which brings us down to
the subject at hand —"Big-Jawed Ath
letes," and it is no hard task at all
to show that men like Dave Shade,
Johnny Evers, Eddie Mahan, and Bill
Tilden are endowed with all the cour
age and fighting spirit that are usually
associated with an underslung man
dible.
Take Dave Shade, for instance.
Here is a lighter with a fighter's jaw,
if one ever lived. No in-growing chin
mars Dave's physiognomy, and his
many ring victories will attest that
his. looks do not belie his fighting
spirit and ability. Another ring war
rior with "a chin you love to touch"

is Joe Dundee, of the same nation
| that loaned Columbus to Spain for his
I epoch-making voyage. The Baltimore
I Italian, as everyone knows, won the
1 world's welterweight title from Pete
Latzo, who had won it from Mickey
! Walker. Shade, in the opinion of many
who saw his fight with Walker when
Mickey was still champion, should
have been awarded the decision. A
fight between Shade and Dundee
would be a battle of two big-jawed
i fighting men worth going miles to see.
"Came the Jawn," as they might
say in the movies, and ball fans will
j at once remember "Jawn" Evers, the
! fighting "Crab" of the old Chicago
i Cubs. Evers had the pronounced lower
jaw of a fighter, and fight he could,
as well as play baseball!
I
Bill Tilden in tennis, and Eddie
j Mahan of Harvard and Ted Coy of
: Yale in football are other cases in
j point. Fighters through and through,
all of these boys, and, thanks to their
I "underslung potatoes," they look the
part.
