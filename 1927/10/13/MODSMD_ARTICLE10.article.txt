# GUERARD SPEAKS ON JOYCE AT MEETING OF ENGLISH SOCIETY
## Professor Discusses Chaos As Literary Technique Before Students 
### 
"Groping for a new psychological ap- j
proach in literature has led to a technique !
which is akin to cubism in pictorial art," j
stated Professor Albert Guerard, of the ,
Department of General Literature, speak-'
ing on"The Art of James Joyce, or;
Chaos as a Literary Technique," at the ■
opening meeting of the English Club :
last night.
Joyce is the author of "Ulysses," a
book which caused a great sensation at
its appearance both in this country and
in France.
"The new art is diving to get beneath
the surface and reach the real self. The
method is an approach through sheer
chaos and diregard of reason; the effect
may be that the true workings of the j
subconscious mind will be discovered.
Joyce shows up the animalism of man in;
his subconscious being—hence the ob-1
scenity of Joyce's writing. Fortunately, j
the difficulty of reading his work it its !
own antidote."
