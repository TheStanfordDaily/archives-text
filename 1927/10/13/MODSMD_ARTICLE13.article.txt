# FIVE COAST COLLEGE RADIO CLUBS ARRANGE FOR NEWS EXCHANGE
## 
### 
Continuing the work it has been en
gaged in for the past few years, the
Stanford Radio Club has recently made
arrangements for a news exchange with
the University of Washington, Washing
ton State College, 0.A.C., and the Uni
versity of California. Other schools may
be added later, announces F. B. Dietrich,
president. Last year plans toward such a
schedule were not completed in time to
put the exchange into practice except with
the University of California. The pres
ent plans promise a very satisfactory fuU
fillment.
The work of the club includes amateur
experimentations, and technical discus
sions concerning problems that come up.
In its present equipment the club has a
fifty-watt transmitter operating in the
forty-meter band. The club can handle
private messages for the campus if a suf
ficient number of operators can be se
cured to take charge.
