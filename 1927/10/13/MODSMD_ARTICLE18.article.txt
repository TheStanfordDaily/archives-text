### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 12.—The flights of I
others served to hearten those who hoped '
for Miss Elder's success. Lindbergh flew'
almost unseen until he reached the Irish!
coast; so did Byrd and Brock and Schlcc. ]
The messages from the passenger liner I
American Banker told of the otic and
only time Ruth Elder's plane was sighted.
Both messages were picked up by the
Independent Wireless Corporation. The [
first, received at 5:45 a.m. today— I
hours after the flight began — said the [
liner had sighted the monoplane at lati-;
tude 41 north, longitude 55.04 west, flying!
due cast, with a northwest wind pushing ■
it along.

The second message, a few hours later,
amplified the announcement, saying the
plane was flying at an altitude of 1,000
feet, that it flashed several lights as it
passed over the steamer, and that the
weather was ideal, with a high barometer.
