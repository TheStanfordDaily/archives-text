# 'OUTLAWRY OF WAR' TO BE DISCUSSED BY DR.JORDAN TONIGHT
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will discuss "The Out
lawry of War" tonight at the second
of his series of Thursday Evening
Conferences. Dr. Jordan believes that
war is possible only as it is legalized
and supported and that laws should
be passed which will outlaw war, like
any other crime. The League of Na
tions is inadequate to handle this
problem at present, according to Dr.
Jordan, who says that the League,
rather than being a league of nations,
is a select group which holds the
whip-liand. It is inevitable that the
United States eventually will join the
League, however.
The conference, which is open to
the public, will be held at 7:30 in Dr.
Jordan's home.
