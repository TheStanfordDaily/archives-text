###

eral years. |

The Stanford varsity backfield has
stopped dropping the ball. And that
means that something must have hap
pened between yesterday and the day
before. Not only were the ballcarriers
becoming more sure of themselves
yesterday, but thoy ure beginning to be
sure of what everyone else will do.
Lessoning the stress on deceptive
tactics and on quick starts, the
coaches were continually demanding?
a cessation of fumbling and muffing.
Reverses and lateral pass plays were
not as fast or as spectacular as they
might have been, but to the great
pleasure of the spectators, when the
ball once left the center's hands, it
stayed above ground.
Have Slight Scrimmage
Since the U.S.C. eleven uses a shift
formation somewhat similar to that
used by the Olympic Club, the Fam
ous Sophomores were being drilled
yesterday in some of the Trojan
plays in order to give the varsity a
good dose of defense practice today.
The varsity, meanwhile, spent most
of the afternoon in dummy practice,
and then had a light scrimmage
against the second string.
Leaving Los Angeles on the Lark
at 8 o'clock tonight, the Trojans will
arrive here early tomorrow morning.
Four of the U.S.C. coaching staff,
Howard Jones, head mentor, Bill Hun
ter, backfield coach, and Leo Calland
and Jeff Cravath, are expected to ac
company the team.
Williams to Play
With the Southerners will be Don
Williams, who returns to the Trojan
fold after a two weeks' absence. The
U.S.C. quarterback was injured in
the Santa Clara game, and did not
perform against the Oregon Aggies,
when Jones could have well used a
spare signal-caller. Williams' return
to the game gives the Trojans five
quarters, Captain Morley Drury, Wil
liams, Howard Elliott, Rocky Kemp,
and Malilon Chambers.

Have Slight Scrimmage
Since the U.S.C. eleven uses a shift
formation somewhat similar to that
used by the Olympic Club, the Fam
ous Sophomores were being drilled
yesterday in some of the Trojan
plays in order to give the varsity a
good dose of defense practice today.
The varsity, meanwhile, spent most
of the afternoon in dummy practice,
and then had a light scrimmage
against the second string.
Leaving Los Angeles on the Lark
at 8 o'clock tonight, the Trojans will
arrive here early tomorrow morning.
Four of the U.S.C. coaching staff,
Howard Jones, head mentor, Bill Hun
ter, backfield coach, and Leo Calland
and Jeff Cravath, are expected to ac
company the team.
Williams to Play
With the Southerners will be Don
Williams, who returns to the Trojan
fold after a two weeks' absence. The
U.S.C. quarterback was injured in
the Santa Clara game, and did not
perform against the Oregon Aggies,
when Jones could have well used a
spare signal-caller. Williams' return
to the game gives the Trojans five
quarters, Captain Morley Drury, Wil
liams, Howard Elliott, Rocky Kemp,
and Malilon Chambers.
