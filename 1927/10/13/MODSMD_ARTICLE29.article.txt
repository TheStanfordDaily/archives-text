# A 						Dollar's Worth of Culture
## 
### 
QNE DOLLAR," says Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, educator and health au
thority—"one dollar expended at Hanover, a small college in Indiana,
gives as much culture as five at Harvard." Dr. Wiley goes on to point
out that since he is a graduate of both institutions he is "in a position" to
say this with authority. The contention is later made that a large uni
versity is conducive to godlessness and disbelief in government, while
the smaller college fosters the opposite desirable characteristics.
Dr. Wiley is basing his conclusions on false premises. The size of
the college or university to our notion is an irrelevant factor in guiding
the average student to the ways of the cultured man. What matters more
is the small group of associates with which the average student is inti
mate, and this group he selects by chance or desire from his fellow
collegians. The question, then, hinges upon the individual and upon the
relative number of cultured students which may be found in large or
small colleges. We question whether a small college attracts more cul
tured students than does a large one, though exceptions, of course, exist
as in the cases of Williams and Amherst.
THAT godlessness is fostered by a large enrollment strikes us as being
a foolish statement. Dr. Wiley does not list the qualities of a small
college which make for an increased belief in God. True, more small
colleges have compulsory chapel than do large ones, but such a require
ment makes more for a continual reminder that other people believe in
God than for conversion to such a belief.
The many and varied attractions of a larger university's life may be
considered as detracting from time for thought on religious matters. The
writer may also have reference to the recent atheism rings which were
uncovered in a number of universities, but their activities were not as
pernicious in this regard as they were sensational. The average college
student today adopts a more laissez-faire policy toward religion. He sees
that religion does not play such a great part in active life as he was told
it did ten or twenty years ago, and it is only natural, therefore, that his
interest is small in God and churchcs.
A s FOR the "disbelief in government," we fail to see any connection
whatsoever with the size of the enrollment. Both large and small
colleges give courses in citizenship and government, and if these do not
attain results the fault lies with the instructors rather than with the num
ber of students. The spread of student government provides a laboratory
for learning the essentials of such a subject first-hand. The very college
administration itself is an example of government.
Dr. Wiley got off on the wrong foot when he made these statements,
and though logic admits that a true conclusion can be drawn from false
premises, we believe that he has here both false conclusions and false
premises.

God than for conversion to such a belief.
The many and varied attractions of a larger university's life may be
considered as detracting from time for thought on religious matters. The
writer may also have reference to the recent atheism rings which were
uncovered in a number of universities, but their activities were not as
pernicious in this regard as they were sensational. The average college
student today adopts a more laissez-faire policy toward religion. He sees
that religion does not play such a great part in active life as he was told
it did ten or twenty years ago, and it is only natural, therefore, that his
interest is small in God and churchcs.
A s FOR the "disbelief in government," we fail to see any connection
whatsoever with the size of the enrollment. Both large and small
colleges give courses in citizenship and government, and if these do not
attain results the fault lies with the instructors rather than with the num
ber of students. The spread of student government provides a laboratory
for learning the essentials of such a subject first-hand. The very college
administration itself is an example of government.
Dr. Wiley got off on the wrong foot when he made these statements,
and though logic admits that a true conclusion can be drawn from false
premises, we believe that he has here both false conclusions and false
premises.
QNE DOLLAR," says Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, educator and health au
thority—"one dollar expended at Hanover, a small college in Indiana,
gives as much culture as five at Harvard." Dr. Wiley goes on to point
out that since he is a graduate of both institutions he is "in a position" to
say this with authority. The contention is later made that a large uni
versity is conducive to godlessness and disbelief in government, while
the smaller college fosters the opposite desirable characteristics.
Dr. Wiley is basing his conclusions on false premises. The size of
the college or university to our notion is an irrelevant factor in guiding
the average student to the ways of the cultured man. What matters more
is the small group of associates with which the average student is inti
mate, and this group he selects by chance or desire from his fellow
collegians. The question, then, hinges upon the individual and upon the
relative number of cultured students which may be found in large or
small colleges. We question whether a small college attracts more cul
tured students than does a large one, though exceptions, of course, exist
as in the cases of Williams and Amherst.
THAT godlessness is fostered by a large enrollment strikes us as being
a foolish statement. Dr. Wiley does not list the qualities of a small
college which make for an increased belief in God. True, more small
colleges have compulsory chapel than do large ones, but such a require
ment makes more for a continual reminder that other people believe in
God than for conversion to such a belief.
