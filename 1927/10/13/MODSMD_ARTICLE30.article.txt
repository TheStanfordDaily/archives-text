# Introducing: Captain McCreery
## 
### 
lial McCreery was yesterday elected to captain the Cardinal varsity.
He is Stanford's first captain to be elected under the new system of
choosing a leader after the grid season has gotten under way.
The varsity's trust is well placed: Mac is a competitive athlete who
has shown time and again that he plays best and hardest when it is most
needed. His election comes as another tribute to the work of the men
in the line, for under Coach Warner's plan of having different sets of
backfield players the fact goes unnoticed that the starting lineup of the
forward wall is much the same throughout the season.
"We'll do our talking Saturday," said Captain McCreery at the rally
last night. He didn't mean it; he together with the team will do their
fighting Saturday—not talking.
