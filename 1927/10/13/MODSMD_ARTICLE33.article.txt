HOW I KEEP FIT
As Told to Handa Beermug
By Algernon S. Smith,
Bleacher Athlete.
"How do I keep fit?" chortled Algie
S. Smith, the Great Bleacher Athlete.
"Dun't esk! I'll tell you."
"I take lung exercises to develop
this." The Great Bleacher Athlete
pointed to that inch-and-a-half ex
panding equipment which he proudly
exhibited as chest. "I just yell, 'Fight
furiously, boys,' loudly as the rest —
and that's how I got this way. It's
great fun, too!"
"I sit in the bleachers on Satur
days—you know sitting on those
rough boards IS hazardous, y'know?"
confided the daring Bleacher Athlete.
"I've heard of no end of people get
ting blood-poison from splinters!"
"When the game is going badly
with our boys I wring my hands and
shout to the boys to 'Come on and
make a touchdown!' Look! You can
see what being out of training does
for a fellow. Algie exhibited two
slightly swollen wrists from the re
cent St. Mary's-Stanford Fumbling
Fiesta.

"Do you walk much, Mr. Smith?"
"Why—er—yes." (Mr. Smith got
very red at this query.) "I walk to
Roble once a week —and then some
times we go for a walk in the hills at
dusk —but," (Mr. Smith hastily add
ed), "never in parties of less than
six!"

There's a guy over here in Toyon
who is going to get murdered. He
plays "I'm Going to See My Baby
Now," and "You Went Away Too
Far," alternately and continuously. I
hope he sees this and takes the gentle
hint. I hate cold-blooded, premedi
tated murder —and I've been meditat

Priceless poems, mudfight, "cracks,"
Registration Dance "digs," an' such,
irreparably lost to "our dear public."

Wuxtra! Wuxtra!

My Roommate Said
When we were going up to Lagunita
to see the mud battle my roommate
asked, "Where do they get the mud
for the mudfight?"
—Roble, '30.
Watch for tomororw's "My Roon*
mate Said" —it's a warm one!

HOW I KEEP FIT
As Told to Handa Beermug
By Algernon S. Smith,
Bleacher Athlete.
"How do I keep fit?" chortled Algie
S. Smith, the Great Bleacher Athlete.
"Dun't esk! I'll tell you."
"I take lung exercises to develop
this." The Great Bleacher Athlete
pointed to that inch-and-a-half ex
panding equipment which he proudly
exhibited as chest. "I just yell, 'Fight
furiously, boys,' loudly as the rest —
and that's how I got this way. It's
great fun, too!"
"I sit in the bleachers on Satur
days—you know sitting on those
rough boards IS hazardous, y'know?"
confided the daring Bleacher Athlete.
"I've heard of no end of people get
ting blood-poison from splinters!"
"When the game is going badly
with our boys I wring my hands and
shout to the boys to 'Come on and
make a touchdown!' Look! You can
see what being out of training does
for a fellow. Algie exhibited two
slightly swollen wrists from the re
cent St. Mary's-Stanford Fumbling
Fiesta.

"Do you walk much, Mr. Smith?"
"Why—er—yes." (Mr. Smith got
very red at this query.) "I walk to
Roble once a week —and then some
times we go for a walk in the hills at
dusk —but," (Mr. Smith hastily add
ed), "never in parties of less than
six!"

The Editor, Sir:
There's a guy over here in Toyon
who is going to get murdered. He
plays "I'm Going to See My Baby
Now," and "You Went Away Too
Far," alternately and continuously. I
hope he sees this and takes the gentle
hint. I hate cold-blooded, premedi
tated murder —and I've been meditat

WUXTRA! WUXTRA!
