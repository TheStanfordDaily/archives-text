# IMPORTED DRUMS FOR STANFORD BAND WILL ADD NOVELTY EFFECT
## 
### 
Addition of a Persian whip drum, a
Scotch bass drum, a daoul, and a dou
baba drum will lend novelty and an inter
national aspect to the percussion section
of the Stanford Band. These instru
ments are being imported for the band
and are expected to arrive before the
Big Game.
The whip drum will be struck with a
knotted cord, the mode of playing used
by the Persian natives. The Scotch bass
drum is of large circumference and nar
row shell, enabling the drummer to play
with two special drum sticks, crossing
hands and juggling the while. Both dou
baba and daoul drums are from the East
and are played with muffled sticks.
