## 
### 
Tryouts for the women's debate with
the University of California, to be held
cither the end of November or the be
ginning of December, have been set for
October 20. The time and place will be
announced in a later issue of the Daily.
Trial speeches, which should be from
three to five minutes in length, may be
made on the questions: Resolved, That
there can never be equality of men and
women under the present social and eco
nomic system; or Resolved, That women
are an inferior sex. These questions are
merely tentative and may not be used in
the debate with California.
Women making the team receive two
units of university credit, and those act
ing as substitutes will receive one unit,
announced Ruth Tinsley, debate man
ager. She hopes to schedule more than
the two customary debates this year.
Professor Anthony Blanks of the Pub
lic Speaking department addressed the
meeting. "Interest in debate gives you
the power to defend yourself and to
support yourself intellectually," he said.
"Most students need the assurance that
the art of argumentation and debate
brings."
