# MARTIN PICKS CALLES TO WIN OUT IN MEXICO ARMY CONTROL IS KEY OF SOUTHERN REPUBLIC LABOR UNIONS FAVOR OBREGON FOR PRESIDENT
## 
### 
"It looks at present as if Calles will j
win out in the 'flare-up' that is occur-1
ring in Mexico now. The labor unions, I
and the agrarians, the people who are
breaking up the large estates, are all
supporters of Calles. Of course, if he !
loses control of the army he will lose
out anyhow, but it seems likely that'
the army will not desert him." This
was the statement of Percy A. Martin,
professor of history, who spent a sab
batical leave recently in South and
Central America, when asked his
opinion of the Mexican situation by
the Daily.
"Obregon, whom Calles favors for j
re-election to the presidency of Mex-1
ico, is the most able man Mexico lias j
produced in recent years. Obregon is \
much more skillful and tactful than
Calles. He has travelled a good deal, j
Although he is not a great statesman, !
I think him a man of considerable j
parts. There is no reason why he [
should not be re-elected so far as the j
constitution of Mexico is concerned, j
The constitution states only that a
president may not immediately suc
ceed himself. Because another man, j
Calles, has been president since Obre
gon, the latter may legally become !
president again if the Mexican people '
so desire.
Clergy Opposes Calles
"Although Calles has suceceded |
after a fashion, by carrying out the
policy of looking after the lower
classes, he has aroused opposition
among the clerical and upper classes.
Serrano, who was assassinated re
cently at the instance of Calles, repre- j

sented this latter group of people,
who are in a minority. Foreign and
Mexican capital is opposed to Calles
because he has tried to make opera
tive Article 27 of the Mexican consti
tution, which says that the 'sub-soil
properties belong to the nation.' This
applies particularly to oil, which has
been taken from the soil by private
corporations heretofore.
"If Obregon should become presi
dent again, he would probably proceed
along the same general lines as Calles>
but he would antagonize fewer peo
ple. I consider Obregon a great out
standing personality. Calles has much
shrewdness and native ability, but he
is tactless.
"Under Diaz, foreign capital was en
couraged to come into Mexico, and
the small upper classes ruled the
country, but this is no longer true
under Calles, nor would it be under
Obregon.
Mexico Greatly Changed
"Whether the present government
of Mexico is better or worse than that
which has preceded it, is a difficult
question to answer. Figuratively, a
great deal of water has flown under
the bridges of Mexico during the past
fifteen years. At least, the Mexicans
think they are better off, that is, the
majority of them.
"There can be no finality in a state
ment about Mexico, because today it
may present one phase and tomorrow
another. The person or faction that
controls the army controls the coun
try in the end," concluded Professor
Martin.

parts. There is no reason why he [
should not be re-elected so far as the j
constitution of Mexico is concerned, j
The constitution states only that a
president may not immediately suc
ceed himself. Because another man, j
Calles, has been president since Obre
gon, the latter may legally become !
president again if the Mexican people '
so desire.
Clergy Opposes Calles
"Although Calles has suceceded |
after a fashion, by carrying out the
policy of looking after the lower
classes, he has aroused opposition
among the clerical and upper classes.
Serrano, who was assassinated re
cently at the instance of Calles, repre- j

sented this latter group of people,
who are in a minority. Foreign and
Mexican capital is opposed to Calles
because he has tried to make opera
tive Article 27 of the Mexican consti
tution, which says that the 'sub-soil
properties belong to the nation.' This
applies particularly to oil, which has
been taken from the soil by private
corporations heretofore.
"If Obregon should become presi
dent again, he would probably proceed
along the same general lines as Calles>
but he would antagonize fewer peo
ple. I consider Obregon a great out
standing personality. Calles has much
shrewdness and native ability, but he
is tactless.
"Under Diaz, foreign capital was en
couraged to come into Mexico, and
the small upper classes ruled the
country, but this is no longer true
under Calles, nor would it be under
Obregon.
Mexico Greatly Changed
"Whether the present government
of Mexico is better or worse than that
which has preceded it, is a difficult
question to answer. Figuratively, a
great deal of water has flown under
the bridges of Mexico during the past
fifteen years. At least, the Mexicans
think they are better off, that is, the
majority of them.
"There can be no finality in a state
ment about Mexico, because today it
may present one phase and tomorrow
another. The person or faction that
controls the army controls the coun
try in the end," concluded Professor
Martin.
"It looks at present as if Calles will j
win out in the 'flare-up' that is occur-1
ring in Mexico now. The labor unions, I
and the agrarians, the people who are
breaking up the large estates, are all
supporters of Calles. Of course, if he !
loses control of the army he will lose
out anyhow, but it seems likely that'
the army will not desert him." This
was the statement of Percy A. Martin,
professor of history, who spent a sab
batical leave recently in South and
Central America, when asked his
opinion of the Mexican situation by
the Daily.
"Obregon, whom Calles favors for j
re-election to the presidency of Mex-1
ico, is the most able man Mexico lias j
produced in recent years. Obregon is \
much more skillful and tactful than
Calles. He has travelled a good deal, j
