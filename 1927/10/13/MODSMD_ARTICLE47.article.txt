LAFAYETTE, Ind., Oct. 11. â€” In
true Rover Boy style, Ray Welch, un
known substitute on the Purdue Uni
versity football squad, burst into glory
Saturday afternoon and won the game
against Harvard for his "dear old
alma mater" with a score of 19-o'. It
was his first varsity game at that!
As a substitute for Captain "Cot
ton" Wilcox, one of the Middlewest's
best halfbacks, Welch ran wild
through the Crimson tacklers, smash
ing gaping holes in Harvard's forward
wall, and tossed several passes includ
ing one for forty yards that led to a
touchdown. He drove across the
enemy's goal line for two of the three
touchdowns made by Purdue, and as a
sideline was credited with outpunting
Harvard's kicker consistently through
out the game.
Welch entered Purdue last year and
played on the freshman team, but it
was not until Wilcox was hurt in the
first game of the season that he had
been considered regular backfleld ma
terial.
