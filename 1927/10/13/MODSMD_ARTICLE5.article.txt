# Templeton Expresses Confidence In Warner Team At U.S.C.Rally
## 
### 
Stanford rooters "should realize by
now that under Pop Warner's system
a month of practice is required before
the team can begin to play real foot
ball," and "there is no reason why
the followers of our team should lose
heart" over early-season showings, de
clared Dink Templeton at the U.S.C.
rally last night in one of the most
optimistic forecasts yet ventured on
Saturday's game.
"I have every confidence in Pop
Warner's ability to time his practice
so that when it comes to the games
that really count they (the team) will
look like a Stanford football team
should," said Templeton, admitting
that he had been fooled the past two
years and did not intend to make the
same mistake again. "I expect that
team to come through next Saturday
in a way that will gladden the hearts
of everyone here tonight," was his
prophesy.
In line with the Rally Committee's
new policy of short and snappy reali
ties, last night's was the speediest
and peppiest seen at Stanford in quite
some time. Nearly the entire student
body was present and went through
the yells and songs in a way that de
lighted the yell leaders.
The varsity squad was present and
Hal McCreery, newly-elected captain,
promised that the team would do its
part Saturday.
Vaudeville stunts were cut out and
short and optimistic talks by Dink
Templeton and Jack Patrick, former
varsity captain who holds the honor
of scoring the first touchdown in
Stanford's present stadium, together
with music by Hu Berner's orchestra
and a brass quartet from the band,
made up the whole program.
Pashgian Wins Prize
Bob Eraser, Rally Committee chair
man, was awarded the silver cup
given by Lapp & Roberts of San Fran
cisco for the best rooting section stunt
for the U.S.C. game to Y. C. Pashgian
for two ideas. The Rally Com
mittee, however, is responsible for the
major proportion of the stunts to be
presented Saturday.
The new "Stanford Forever" song
was very favorably received by the
Cardinal rooters at its first real prac
tice.
