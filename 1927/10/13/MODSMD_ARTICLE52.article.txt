OREGON STATE COLLEGE, Cor- i
vallis, Oct. 12.—(P.I.P.A.)—The Lady !
of the Fountain, the talisman oi the col
lege that stands on the lower campus, !
has lived a varied life. She has been
stolen, buried in a cellar, painted, deco
rated, and subjected to vandalism. The ■
class of 1902 holds the honor and dis- J
tinction of being the first class to give a
class gift to the college, which was the
Lady of the Fountain. The statue repre
sents Hebe, the Greek cup bearer to the j
gods.
Money for the statue was raised by 1
the senior excursion to Newport. At !
that time citizens of Linn and Benton
counties also enjoyed the annual trip. j
Years ago water used to flow from the
pitcher held in the Lady's hand. The
rooks were ducked there until the act
became too frequent.
When the statue was found in the
basement of a Portland store several
years ago, it was returned to the campus.
Money was then appropriated to give it
a permanent foundation. The statue was
filled with cement and given a sufficiently
heavy base to insure it against future
theft.
