# SKIRTS STILL SHORT; STYLES OF MOMENT FAVOR COLLEGE TYPE
## Horizontal, Diagonal Lines Reduced to Sport Hems Alone 
### Lady Vee 
College women were never more
favored by that flighty lady, Dame
Fashion, than they are this year—un
doubtedly a sure sign that she was
once a college youth herself.
Skirts, despite the propaganda of
the cloth manufacturers, have stead
fastly maintained their more or less
knee length. Pleats, circular cut, and
more pleats give her the mucli-de
sired freedom. The colour palette was
evidently designed for the co-ed age.
Altogether, the college girl is the first
lady of the land, so far as Dame
Fashion is concerned.
Show Diagonal Lines
The straight horizontal lines that
used to mark everything—hat line,
waist line, hem line —have been re
duced to the sport hem line alone.
Everything is diagonal, irregular,
asymmetrical. Hat brims have spared
no pains to keep themselves from
being straight. They tie themselves
in knots and perch over one eyebrow,
leaving the other one quite exposed;
they cut half of themselves away and
leave the rest to be pinned up on one
side —another way of hiding one eye
brow and exposing the other.
Waistlines are carefully suppressed
and kept in the background by the
use of diagonal incrustations of either
a different fabric or a different shade.
Intricacy of cut, simplicity of effect —
the paradox that hounds the steps of
the home dressmaker are the pass
words of 1927.
Hemlines Are Uneven
As for hemlines, the uncompromis
ingly straight one of the last two or
three years has practically disap
peared from the evening mode, and is
losing ground in the afternoon. The
evening hemline is either up in front
and down in back, or up on one side
and down on the other. An even hem
now looks strangely pass 6.
In this season's fashion ballet the
place of premiere danseuse must go
to transparent velvet. Its soft drapa
bleness and incredible limpness make
all other velvet now seem like mo
hair. The wardrobes that do not in
clude a black dress of this material —
either evening or afternoon —will be
few and far between. It has the un
usual quality of making the blonde
look more blonde and the brunette
more brunette —a boon to the college
girl.
Black Popular
Black, this fall, is the running-mate
of white. They are supremely smart
for evening—possibly because of the
great popularity of brilliant jewelry,
for which they are such excellent
backgrounds. Rhinestones and strasse,
gold and semi-precious stones have
almost eclipsed the once ever-present
pearl. Next to black and white, pale
colours lead for evening—off-shades
of pink and blue; and one or two
houses are showing yellow. The
Chanel red that stormed last year's
fashion world, is quite demode; while
the Hunters' green that was mildly
popular last year is again being shown
this fall by Worth.
Brown, Grey in Favor
Breaking all traditions, brown has
entered the sport world. It used to
stop with beige, but now the brown
is unmistakable. It is used in the
four-piece sport costumes of skirt,
jumper, jacket, and topcoat; it ap
pears in sweaters and tweed-like
skirts; and it is often found in the
felt sport hat.
Another colour that has gained pres
tige is grey, although it will never
reach the Chanel-red point in popu
larity. However, ensembles of vary
ing values of grey were shown at
several of the Paris openings.

Everything is diagonal, irregular,
asymmetrical. Hat brims have spared
no pains to keep themselves from
being straight. They tie themselves
in knots and perch over one eyebrow,
leaving the other one quite exposed;
they cut half of themselves away and
leave the rest to be pinned up on one
side —another way of hiding one eye
brow and exposing the other.
Waistlines are carefully suppressed
and kept in the background by the
use of diagonal incrustations of either
a different fabric or a different shade.
Intricacy of cut, simplicity of effect —
the paradox that hounds the steps of
the home dressmaker are the pass
words of 1927.
Hemlines Are Uneven
As for hemlines, the uncompromis
ingly straight one of the last two or
three years has practically disap
peared from the evening mode, and is
losing ground in the afternoon. The
evening hemline is either up in front
and down in back, or up on one side
and down on the other. An even hem
now looks strangely pass 6.
In this season's fashion ballet the
place of premiere danseuse must go
to transparent velvet. Its soft drapa
bleness and incredible limpness make
all other velvet now seem like mo
hair. The wardrobes that do not in
clude a black dress of this material —
either evening or afternoon —will be
few and far between. It has the un
usual quality of making the blonde
look more blonde and the brunette
more brunette —a boon to the college
girl.
Black Popular
Black, this fall, is the running-mate
of white. They are supremely smart
for evening—possibly because of the
great popularity of brilliant jewelry,
for which they are such excellent
backgrounds. Rhinestones and strasse,
gold and semi-precious stones have
almost eclipsed the once ever-present
pearl. Next to black and white, pale
colours lead for evening—off-shades
of pink and blue; and one or two
houses are showing yellow. The
Chanel red that stormed last year's
fashion world, is quite demode; while
the Hunters' green that was mildly
popular last year is again being shown
this fall by Worth.
Brown, Grey in Favor
Breaking all traditions, brown has
entered the sport world. It used to
stop with beige, but now the brown
is unmistakable. It is used in the
four-piece sport costumes of skirt,
jumper, jacket, and topcoat; it ap
pears in sweaters and tweed-like
skirts; and it is often found in the
felt sport hat.
Another colour that has gained pres
tige is grey, although it will never
reach the Chanel-red point in popu
larity. However, ensembles of vary
ing values of grey were shown at
several of the Paris openings.
College women were never more
favored by that flighty lady, Dame
Fashion, than they are this year—un
doubtedly a sure sign that she was
once a college youth herself.
Skirts, despite the propaganda of
the cloth manufacturers, have stead
fastly maintained their more or less
knee length. Pleats, circular cut, and
more pleats give her the mucli-de
sired freedom. The colour palette was
evidently designed for the co-ed age.
Altogether, the college girl is the first
lady of the land, so far as Dame
Fashion is concerned.
