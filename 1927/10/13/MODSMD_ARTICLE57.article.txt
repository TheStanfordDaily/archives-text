the faculty—is capable or making mis
takes quite as readily as the students.
It all comes to light with the receipt
by the Board of Athletic Control of the
ticket applications sent in by the fac
ulty for the Big Game.
No less than eight professors in one
department failed to fill in their ap
plication blanks correctly. Several
others admitted that the instructions
were beyond their grasp and sent their
applications back to the Board of Ath
letic Control, requesting the officials
there to please straighten things out
lor them and fill in their applications
correctly. Generally a large check was
inclosed with the request that the
Board deduct the necessary amount
and refund the difference.
Repeated mistakes caused the ticket
office to mail out as many as five sets
of special instructions to the profes
sors before the latter were able to
fill in the blanks correctly. Several
faculty members made personal visits
to the ticket office to get special in
structions for procuring their seats.
It is rumored that a special course,
