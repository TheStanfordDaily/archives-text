# ADDITIONS MADE TO BENDER COLLECTION PLACED ON DISPLAY
## Valuable Works Included in Rare Examples of Fine Printing Shown 
### 
Willi the purpose of developing the
appreciation and love of art in stu
dents by the display of the better ex
amples of line printing, the Bender
Collection of Finely Printed Books
was donated to the Stanford Library
last year. This collection, assembled
by Alfred M. Bender of San Francisco
with the co-operation of friends, has
since then constantly grown in size
and scope and now contains a great
many valuable items, as is testified
by the 1927 catalogue just published.
It is the aim of the collector that it be
a thoroughly representative assem
bly, and he considers it by no means
complete as yet.
Collected Rare Books
As a boy Mr. Bender was profound
ly impressed by the rare old books he
saw in the British Museum, and in
later years he became a collector of
beautiful books. It is his wish to in
fluence some of the modern youth
with the art that he himself appre
ciated so much. Naturally the Library
must select its books for utility, and
the Bender Collection is an appeal to
the aesthetic side.
Famous Printers Included
The most famous printing houses of
the world are represented from the
earliest ones in the fifteenth century
to the modern press, there being 47
different houses thus far. Of these, six
are located in San Francisco; some
of the finest work in the collection is
done by John Henry Nash, and the
Grabhorn Press. The majority of the
printing houses are in London, how
ever.
Doves Bible Displayed
Choice items of the collection are
on display in the showcases on the
second-floor balcony of the library,
and will be changed at intervals. At
present the London Doves Press Eng
lish Bible is among the displays; this
company is in quest of the perfect
book, and the five-volume edition of
the Bible lays claim to the honors.
There are other examples from the
Ashendene Press and Kelmscott Press
of England, and John Henry Nash
and the Grabhorn Press of San Fran
cisco.
