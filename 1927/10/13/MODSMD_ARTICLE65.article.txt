# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
This energetic-looking young man is
William A. Ingram, head coach of the
United States Naval Academy foot
ball team. It is easily remembered
how the Middies tied the Army last
November in one of the greatest
games ever played in the United
States, and how previously they had
beaten a strong Michigan team which
had run roughshod over them the year
before. But this year Coach Ingram
faces a far different situation, be
cause stars such as Wickhorst, Hamil
ton, and Eddy are gone, and there is
little material to take their places. No
major team in the country faces such
a situation as the Navy's, for every
line position must be filed anew, and
only five of the players who faced the
Army in Chicago in 1926 remain.
Frankly, the outlook is not so good.
However, Bill Ingram has the confi

dence of every officer and midship
man in the "Yard." To say that he is
the most popular coach the Navy ever
had would not be a misstatement. Ten
years ago Bill was the Navy's star
quarterback. He filled that position in
1916, '17, and '18, and was known as
a great player and a fine and brainy
field-general. Because he played dur
ing the war years, he did not receive
the recognition that would have other
wise been his. He also stroked the
Navy crew in 1918 and 1919.
Ingram has been a success as a
coach. He assisted Gil Dobie in 1919,
and the Navy beat the Army that
year. In 1920 and '21, he coached the
United States Fleet team on the
Pacific coast, and they triumphed over
all opposition except Andy Smith's
"wonder team" at California. In 1922,
he coached at William and Mary, and

his freshman team was the nucleus of!
the eleven that represented that col- j
lege so well during the next three i
years. From 1923 to 1925, inclusive, J
Bill was the football mentor at In-!
Diana University. With poor material,;
he got better results each year. His
last year's record at Annapolis needs {
no more comment. The 1926 Navy j
team was never beaten.
Day after tomorrow the Middies I
play Notre Dame in one of the big I
intersectional games of the year, j
Then we will see what Bill Ingram i
has been able to accomplish with his |
green material.

year. In 1920 and '21, he coached the
United States Fleet team on the
Pacific coast, and they triumphed over
all opposition except Andy Smith's
"wonder team" at California. In 1922,
he coached at William and Mary, and

his freshman team was the nucleus of!
the eleven that represented that col- j
lege so well during the next three i
years. From 1923 to 1925, inclusive, J
Bill was the football mentor at In-!
Diana University. With poor material,;
he got better results each year. His
last year's record at Annapolis needs {
no more comment. The 1926 Navy j
team was never beaten.
Day after tomorrow the Middies I
play Notre Dame in one of the big I
intersectional games of the year, j
Then we will see what Bill Ingram i
has been able to accomplish with his |
green material.


The Middies' Mentor
This energetic-looking young man is
William A. Ingram, head coach of the
United States Naval Academy foot
ball team. It is easily remembered
how the Middies tied the Army last
November in one of the greatest
games ever played in the United
States, and how previously they had
beaten a strong Michigan team which
had run roughshod over them the year
before. But this year Coach Ingram
faces a far different situation, be
cause stars such as Wickhorst, Hamil
ton, and Eddy are gone, and there is
little material to take their places. No
major team in the country faces such
a situation as the Navy's, for every
line position must be filed anew, and
only five of the players who faced the
Army in Chicago in 1926 remain.
Frankly, the outlook is not so good.
However, Bill Ingram has the confi

dence of every officer and midship
man in the "Yard." To say that he is
the most popular coach the Navy ever
had would not be a misstatement. Ten
years ago Bill was the Navy's star
quarterback. He filled that position in
1916, '17, and '18, and was known as
a great player and a fine and brainy
field-general. Because he played dur
ing the war years, he did not receive
the recognition that would have other
wise been his. He also stroked the
Navy crew in 1918 and 1919.
Ingram has been a success as a
coach. He assisted Gil Dobie in 1919,
and the Navy beat the Army that
year. In 1920 and '21, he coached the
United States Fleet team on the
Pacific coast, and they triumphed over
all opposition except Andy Smith's
"wonder team" at California. In 1922,
