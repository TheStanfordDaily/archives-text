# MIXING NATIONALITIES DECLARED CAUSE FOR BALKAN REVOLUTIONS
## Dr. Jordan Claims Serbians Deserving of Blame In Many Cases 
### 
Assassination of the Jugo-Slavian Gen
eral Movachevitch, presumably by Bul
garians, and the raids of Bulgarian "co
mitadjis" into Jugo-Slavian territory and
into Greece near Cornitsova almost pro
voked another Balkan war a few days
ago. However, the strained relations be
tween Bulgaria and Jtigo-Slavia appear
to have been settled now by the Bulgarian
minister of foreign affairs and the Jugo-
Slavian ambassador.
The question of the appropriate divi
sion of Macedonia among Serbs, Alba
nians, Greeks, and Bulgarians has been
one of long standing in the Balkans, and
one which has been the occasion for the
several Balkan wars and diplomatic rup
tures, according to Dr. Jordan, who made
an extensive study of the situation there
prior to the World War.
Jordan Is Authority
"Dr. Jordan is one of the greatest liv
ing authorities on the Macedonian ques
tion," according to Professor Ralph H.
Lutz, who is in charge of the Hoover
War Library. "Thanks to Dr. Jordan,
we have one of the most extensive and
comprehensive lists of books and docu
ments on the Balkan situation that can
be found anywhere.
"The bulk of Macedonia is inhabited
by Bulgars. The first war among the
people in the Balkans took place when
the Turks were driven out. Later Sir
Edward Grey called representatives of
conflicting countries together at London
. . . . and divided things so that everyone
was dissatisfied, thereby making another
war inevitable instead of averting it."
This is a brief statement of the origin
of the Balkan question as Dr. Jordan
expresses it. He continues
Serbia Wanted Port
"Serbia had no access to the sea. Part
of the Bulgarian people had been placed
under the rule of Greece and Rumania.
The Bulgarian government tried to re
main as neutral as possible but the 'co
mitadjis' (irregular Bulgarian troops)
made trouble. Bulgaria had no control
over her nationals in Greece or Jugo
slavia, but the Bulgarian people sympa
thized with their alienated countrymen.
Serbs Disliked
"There are now almost as many people
in Jugo-Slavia who are opposed to the
Serbs as there are Serbs themselves, but
the Serbs have the upper hand.
"Whenever a student of the problem
presented by Macedonian partitions has
become acquainted with conditions in the
Balkans, I believe, he has come to sym
pathize with Bulgaria. Of course, I may
be prejudiced : the queen of Bulgaria gave
me a fine automobile and two guards
when I toured the country. Nevertheless,
I think Bulgaria has been done an in
justice in the partition of Macedonia,"
concluded Dr. Jordan.
