# FEW TEACHING JOBS OPEN TO GRADUATES SAYS MRS. STEARNS
## 
### Janet Post 
"There are more teachers this year
than there are positions to be filled,"
Elizabeth H. Snell, appointment office sec
retary, announced yesterday.
"At the end of August we had ninety
seven available teaching applicants, and
oversupply was the biggest factor in our
inability to place them. The fact that
many of them registered with the office
too late in the year greatly aggravated
the difficulty.
"This overcrowded condition exists all
over the country," Mrs. Snell stated, "and
it will probably continue next year. It
means that economic conditions are forc
ing business women back into the teach
ing profession, and that teachers who
have positions already are retaining
them. If the Appointment Office is to
cope with the situation, prospective
teachers must register with us early this
year, preferably in the second week of
November. It is essential that we get to
know each applicant personally."
Mrs. Snell advised students working
for junior high school certificates to get
elementary school credentials as well.
Questioned as to the advisability of
English as a teaching major, Mrs. Snell
said: "There are too many persons who
are only prepared to teach the first two
years of high school English, but there
is a big demand for teachers who can
instruct in all four years. Don't try to
teach English unless you have a strong,
vigorous personality and plenty of en
thusiasm," she warned. "In most schools
it is a required subject, and it takes these
qualities to put it over to children who
are not particularly interested."
In the interest of prospective teachers
who have not yet decided upon their ma
jors, Mrs. Snell listed a number of sub
jects for which instructors are particu
larly in demand. Spanish and Latin in
combination, commercial English, all
sorts of music, particularly band and or
chestra, and a combination of the sciences
she mentioned as particularly good teach
ing subjects. There are few positions
open for those prepared only in mathe
matics, history, or are, she said, although
there is quite a demand for people who
can teach this work in conjunction with
some other subjects.
Coaches Must Teach
Men planning to teach athletics, un
less they are stars in some sport, should
prepare themselves to instruct in aca
dcmic courses as well. Women who are
prospective physical education instructors
need training in corrective gymnastics in
addition to being able to coach sports,
Mrs. Snell said.
Last year the Stanford Appointment
Office placed 280 applicants in teaching
positions. The oversupply of teachers, the
fact that many did not enroll early
enough at the office, and the refusal of
some to teach outside a special locality
were the three principal reasons that
ninety-seven teachers were not located,
Mrs. Snell explained.

fact that many did not enroll early
enough at the office, and the refusal of
some to teach outside a special locality
were the three principal reasons that
ninety-seven teachers were not located,
Mrs. Snell explained.
"There are more teachers this year
than there are positions to be filled,"
Elizabeth H. Snell, appointment office sec
retary, announced yesterday.
"At the end of August we had ninety
seven available teaching applicants, and
oversupply was the biggest factor in our
inability to place them. The fact that
many of them registered with the office
too late in the year greatly aggravated
the difficulty.
"This overcrowded condition exists all
over the country," Mrs. Snell stated, "and
it will probably continue next year. It
means that economic conditions are forc
ing business women back into the teach
ing profession, and that teachers who
have positions already are retaining
them. If the Appointment Office is to
cope with the situation, prospective
teachers must register with us early this
year, preferably in the second week of
November. It is essential that we get to
know each applicant personally."
Mrs. Snell advised students working
for junior high school certificates to get
elementary school credentials as well.
Questioned as to the advisability of
English as a teaching major, Mrs. Snell
said: "There are too many persons who
are only prepared to teach the first two
years of high school English, but there
is a big demand for teachers who can
instruct in all four years. Don't try to
teach English unless you have a strong,
vigorous personality and plenty of en
thusiasm," she warned. "In most schools
it is a required subject, and it takes these
qualities to put it over to children who
are not particularly interested."
In the interest of prospective teachers
who have not yet decided upon their ma
jors, Mrs. Snell listed a number of sub
jects for which instructors are particu
larly in demand. Spanish and Latin in
combination, commercial English, all
sorts of music, particularly band and or
chestra, and a combination of the sciences
she mentioned as particularly good teach
ing subjects. There are few positions
open for those prepared only in mathe
matics, history, or are, she said, although
there is quite a demand for people who
can teach this work in conjunction with
some other subjects.
Coaches Must Teach
Men planning to teach athletics, un
less they are stars in some sport, should
prepare themselves to instruct in aca
dcmic courses as well. Women who are
prospective physical education instructors
need training in corrective gymnastics in
addition to being able to coach sports,
Mrs. Snell said.
Last year the Stanford Appointment
Office placed 280 applicants in teaching
positions. The oversupply of teachers, the
fact that many did not enroll early
enough at the office, and the refusal of
some to teach outside a special locality
were the three principal reasons that
ninety-seven teachers were not located,
Mrs. Snell explained.
