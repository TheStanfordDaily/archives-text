# CLOCK TOWER CHIMES ONCE HUNG IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
By Margaret Cummings I
"One, two, three, four; one, two,
three, four." And the tower clock
chimes ring out the half hour. For
twenty-four years they have tolled
out their message each passing quar
ter of an hour. They are aristocratic ;
chimes, for they are tuned exactly,
with the famous ones at Westminster !
Abbey, London.
For twenty-one years they have
hung from the roof of the clock
Lower, where they have become famil
iar to successive Stanford genera-
Lions. This was not their first rous
ing nor destiny, however. In 1903,
when the Memorial Church, which is
Mrs. Stanford's most famous gift to
the University was dedicated, these
chimes were hanging in the steeple
of the tower which then rose high
over the center of the church.
Clock Face Visible to All
Here they rang out the hours told j
on the four great faces of the church
tower clock. From every point on the
campus, and from Palo Alto, one of
the clock's faces was visible, and a
great pair of gilded hands could be
seen pointing the time of day. Eight
feet in diameter stood each face, set
high up from the rest of the campus,
and plainly visible to all.
Three years the clock and the
chimes were undisturbed. Then in
1906 came the earthquake which
wrought such havoc to the Univer
sity, destroyed the famous archway
leading into the Memorial Court, shat
tered the Rose Window on the front

of the church, and shook down the
too-fragile superstructure of the
tower so that it broke four ways and
fell, bringing with it the heavy ma
chinery that ran the clocks, and loos
ing the chimes, which fell and mingled
with the other debris.
Chimes Salvaged
Later the chimes were salvaged,
and a clock tower erected to which
they were transferred, pending the
time when the University should re
build the tower on the church. A
single clock was built on the north
ern side, facing out over the Quad,
and to it the chimes were attached.
Stands for 21 Years
Twenty-one years of service have
made the clock tower into an institu
tion that seems permanent rather
than transient. High up from the
campus, housed in a little room in the
tower, stands the heavy machinery
which turns the hands of the clock,
and rings the little chimes at the end
of each fifteen-minute period, and the
big bell for the hours.
Swinging slowly through the musty,
cobwebby interior of the tower, the
massive pendulum marks the minutes.
Hung from pulleys connected to the
machinery, heavy weights, ranging
from 300 pounds to half a ton regulate
the movement of the clock hands.
Also connected to the clock are the
bells ringing classes over the campus.
So throughout the day the clock
and the chimes regulate the activities
of all who are connected with
Stanford. For nearly a quarter of a
century they have exercised this
sovereignty, chiming out unfailingly
the hour, the half, the quarters, with
bells tuned exactly with those that
ring from Westminster Abbey.

tower clock. From every point on the
campus, and from Palo Alto, one of
the clock's faces was visible, and a
great pair of gilded hands could be
seen pointing the time of day. Eight
feet in diameter stood each face, set
high up from the rest of the campus,
and plainly visible to all.
Three years the clock and the
chimes were undisturbed. Then in
1906 came the earthquake which
wrought such havoc to the Univer
sity, destroyed the famous archway
leading into the Memorial Court, shat
tered the Rose Window on the front

of the church, and shook down the
too-fragile superstructure of the
tower so that it broke four ways and
fell, bringing with it the heavy ma
chinery that ran the clocks, and loos
ing the chimes, which fell and mingled
with the other debris.
Chimes Salvaged
Later the chimes were salvaged,
and a clock tower erected to which
they were transferred, pending the
time when the University should re
build the tower on the church. A
single clock was built on the north
ern side, facing out over the Quad,
and to it the chimes were attached.
Stands for 21 Years
Twenty-one years of service have
made the clock tower into an institu
tion that seems permanent rather
than transient. High up from the
campus, housed in a little room in the
tower, stands the heavy machinery
which turns the hands of the clock,
and rings the little chimes at the end
of each fifteen-minute period, and the
big bell for the hours.
Swinging slowly through the musty,
cobwebby interior of the tower, the
massive pendulum marks the minutes.
Hung from pulleys connected to the
machinery, heavy weights, ranging
from 300 pounds to half a ton regulate
the movement of the clock hands.
Also connected to the clock are the
bells ringing classes over the campus.
So throughout the day the clock
and the chimes regulate the activities
of all who are connected with
Stanford. For nearly a quarter of a
century they have exercised this
sovereignty, chiming out unfailingly
the hour, the half, the quarters, with
bells tuned exactly with those that
ring from Westminster Abbey.
By Margaret Cummings I
"One, two, three, four; one, two,
three, four." And the tower clock
chimes ring out the half hour. For
twenty-four years they have tolled
out their message each passing quar
ter of an hour. They are aristocratic ;
chimes, for they are tuned exactly,
with the famous ones at Westminster !
Abbey, London.
For twenty-one years they have
hung from the roof of the clock
Lower, where they have become famil
iar to successive Stanford genera-
Lions. This was not their first rous
ing nor destiny, however. In 1903,
when the Memorial Church, which is
Mrs. Stanford's most famous gift to
the University was dedicated, these
chimes were hanging in the steeple
of the tower which then rose high
over the center of the church.
Clock Face Visible to All
Here they rang out the hours told j
on the four great faces of the church
tower clock. From every point on the
campus, and from Palo Alto, one of
the clock's faces was visible, and a
