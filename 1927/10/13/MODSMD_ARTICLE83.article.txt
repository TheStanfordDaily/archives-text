### 
SEDALIA, Mo., Oct. 12.â€”The Cool
idge administration was charged with
protecting money and monopoly in a
speech by Senator James A. Reed to
15,000 Democrats at their annual politi
cal barbecue today.
He was greeted with an uproarious
demonstration lasting five minutes. The
State Democratic Central Committee
yesterday endorsed Reed for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination and he was
presented to the convention of Demo
crats today as "the most outstanding
Democrat in the United States and the
logical candidate for president."
Discusses Prohibition
Reed passed over prohibition lightly
and emphasized the anti-monopoly issue.
It was thought by many that this was in
response to the suggestions of dry Demo
crats who would like to support Reed but
objected to his wet views.
"How stands the case?" he asked.
"Trusts multiply, and the president
does not choose to interfere.
"Monopoly grows fat, and the presi
dent does not choose to act.
"Combinations are formed and arro
gantly pursue their methods under the
protection of the government, and the
president chooses to approve.
Commissions Corrupt
"Commissions are packed by interested
parties and their attorneys so that in
stead of being guardians of the public,
they have become instruments of oppres
sion and of wrong, and the president
chooses to do the packing.
Reed did not refer directly to prohibi
tion, but denounced in general "the inva
sion of personal rights and privileges."
The protective tariff he blamed for the
farm crisis. ' The foreign policy of the
administration, he said, caused "the in
solent attitude of foreign nations."
