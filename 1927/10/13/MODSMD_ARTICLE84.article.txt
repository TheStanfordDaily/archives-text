### 
LONDON, Oct. 12.—Cracks in the
crust of Great Britain are causing wide
spread alarm. Scarcely a day passes
without a landslide or the collapse of a
building.
Two of the most serious of such dis
asters were the fall of a house in Beak
Street, West London, in which two peo
ple were killed, and the collapse of the
Commercial Union Assurance Company's
seven-story building in Cornhill, London's
Wall Street district. In this case a sub
sidence also occurred under the roadway,
■necessitating the closing of the thorough
fares.
