# Banditry, Robbery Trails Wake of Russian Children

### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 12.—Banditry, rob- ■
bery, and "even murder" are increasing
among the bands of homeless children, 1
who are recruiting their ranks among
boys of eight to fourteen years who leave
their homes to join the bands of rovers,!
i

lured by the tales of high adventure, ac
cording to a report of the M.U.R., tin
Moscow municipal detective bureau.
A round-up of 177 homeless youngsters
in one section of Moscow recently
showed that many of the ragged boy>
had left comfortable homes within a year
and that most of them had one or botl
parents living. But the fascination of a
roving, carefree life, wandering wherever
fancy calls and all over Russia, had
drawn the youngsters out of their com
fortable home life.
New recruits, the M.U.R. declared, are
usually immediately required to divide
their good clothing among the members
of the gang they have joined and are in
structed in the fine art of picking pock
ets, raiding curb stands where food is
sold, and diving onto the rods under
neath moving freight-cars.
