and a fine of $1000 for violation of the
State Corrupt Practices Act.
It was the first sentence to be for

Duvall was specicifically charged
with bartering public office before his
election as mayor in return for cash
contributions to his campaign fund
and political support. He dened the
charge and while he admitted he ac
cepted $10,000 from an Indianapolis
politician before the campaign, he as
serted he returned it because he could
not accept the obligation it entailed.
