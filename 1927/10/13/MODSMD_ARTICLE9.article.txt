# ELECTED CAPTAIN OF CARDINAL GRID TEAM
## 
### 

"Hal" McCreery, who was elected by the varsity team yesterday to be football captain for 1927. He has been
first-string center for the past two seasons, and is entering his last year of competition for Stanford. With the
exception of Dud McCreery is the first center to be Cardinal captain for over a decade. National
critics rank him as All-American material, and on a par with Bettencourt of St. Mary's and former Captains
Jell Cravath of U.S.C. and "Babe" Horrell of California.
