Parker's "No Expense After
Purchase" offer means that tho
new model Duofold necessarily
must be a pen that stays in per
fect order. Otherwise we'd go
broke making repairs.
The fact is that trouble has prac
tically vanished since we replaced
rubber barrels with Non-Break
able Permanite.
And of course there's never been
anything else like the Parker Duo
fold Point that yields to any hand
yet never loses shape.
If you want to taste something
new in writing ease —called Pros
sureless Touch —try the New
Model Parker Duofold at the near
est pen counter.
