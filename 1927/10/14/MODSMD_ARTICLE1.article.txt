ATEXT fall's registration of new Lower Division men will be limited to 350
as compared to the 450 admitted this quarter, according to a resolution
passed yesterday at a meeting of the Stanford Board of Trustees in the
Balfour Building, San Francisco. Following is President Wilbur's statement
issued after the meeting:
The Board of Trustees of Stanford University has set at three
hundred and fifty (350) the number of new men students to be
admitted to the Lower Division October 1, 1928. This number is for
that year only. Further determinations as to the reductions or in
creases in the Lower Division will depend upon experience and
future registration in the University. No determination for the elimi
nation of the Lower Division has been made by the Board of Trustees.

Time for Cut Has Come <s
The Board of Trustees felt that the |
University cannot handle a greater :
total registration than is now admit-;
ted and that because of this fact the i
time has come for a greater limitation
upon the Lower Division. Provision is
made, however, that should it be
deemed desirable, more than the 350
figure set for 192S may be admitted j
in any later year.
Though yesterday's action specifi
cally affirms that the total elimina
tion of the Lower Division is not yet
determined upon, the University has j
nevertheless taken a definite step in
that direction, with the provision that
it may retrace its course should this ,
be deemed desirable.

ATEXT fall's registration of new Lower Division men will be limited to 350
as compared to the 450 admitted this quarter, according to a resolution
passed yesterday at a meeting of the Stanford Board of Trustees in the
Balfour Building, San Francisco. Following is President Wilbur's statement
issued after the meeting:
The Board of Trustees of Stanford University has set at three
hundred and fifty (350) the number of new men students to be
admitted to the Lower Division October 1, 1928. This number is for
that year only. Further determinations as to the reductions or in
creases in the Lower Division will depend upon experience and
future registration in the University. No determination for the elimi
nation of the Lower Division has been made by the Board of Trustees.

Time for Cut Has Come <s
The Board of Trustees felt that the |
University cannot handle a greater :
total registration than is now admit-;
ted and that because of this fact the i
time has come for a greater limitation
upon the Lower Division. Provision is
made, however, that should it be
deemed desirable, more than the 350
figure set for 192S may be admitted j
in any later year.
Though yesterday's action specifi
cally affirms that the total elimina
tion of the Lower Division is not yet
determined upon, the University has j
nevertheless taken a definite step in
that direction, with the provision that
it may retrace its course should this ,
be deemed desirable.
Gifts Received
Other aotions of the Board of Trus
tees included the acknowledgement of
gifts totalling approximately $120,000,
among which was the receipt of a;
$50,000 gift from the estate of Charles j
T. Brooker of Ansonia, Conn. The
money is to be used for the establish
ment of a Fellowship fund in memory
