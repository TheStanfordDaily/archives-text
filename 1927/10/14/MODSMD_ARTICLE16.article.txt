# HOUSES WILL ADOPT CO-OPERATIVE BUYING SCHEME THIS MONTH
## 
### 
Co-operative buying by fraternities i
and sororities will probably be accom- j
pllshed within a month it' a satisfac
tory plan can be worked out. It was i
announced last night by an official j
of the University that research work, i
including the study of co-operative j
buying plans in other universities, I
was carried on throughout the past j
summer.
The subject is undergoing a tlior-1
ough study at the present time by ;
University experts, and they will be
able to submit a proposed plan to the ;
students in the near future. Co-opera
tion of all the living groups is neces-!
sary to successfully operate such a
plan, for, the official continued, the â€¢
co-operative marketing plan is based
on the active membership of all the j
possible groups. Such a plan cannot j
be carried on by only a few fraterni-1
ties and sororities.
