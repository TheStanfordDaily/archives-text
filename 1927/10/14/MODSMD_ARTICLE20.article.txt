# THUNDERING HERD STAMPEDES NORTH TO MAINTAIN UNBROKEN STRING OF WINS AT STANFORD
## Southerners Chosen in Camp Of Enemy; Up Against Odds at Home CARDINALS SHOW FIGHT Rival Team on Warpath to Redeem Showings Made In Early Season 
### Milton Silverman 
Coach Howard Jones and his Thunder
ing- Herd will pass through Palo Alto
early this morning bound for parts yet
unknown to do their last bit of practice
in order to follow the dictates'of history,
h or the annals of foutball show that the
Trojans are invincible at Palo Alto, that
they have won four games here and lost
three at Los Angeles.
Furthermore the Herd is coming from
a city that is favoring Stanford to win
at odds of five to four, and that is an
ideal situation in the mind of Howard
Jones. But the Trojans must remember
that northern California is reluctantly
admitting that the Cardinals are entering
the fray tomorrow as underdogs. And
that, as history also shows, is the best
news heard on the Farm for many days.
'I he varsity has heard of their appar
ently unenviable position, and yesterday's
practice was one that cheered everyone
but "Pop" Warner. "Pop" will not *be
cheered by anything, even by the sight
of his first string taking out a personal
grudge on the charging machine, on their
scrimmage opponents, and on anyone who
comes too close to the scene of scrim
make.
Ibis sudden outburst of rage, if it
continues till sundown Saturday, will be
a most unhospitable welcome for the Tro
jans. Yesterday it caused the tackling
dummies to be sent whirling up over the
) supports. It made the Famous Sopho

touch-tackle and watch the main attrac- j
lion 011 the field.
Called the crucial game of the 1927!
conference race, the Stanford-Southernj
California tilt will be an attempt of two j
teams to redeem themselves in the eyes I
of their backers. Stanford has a defeat'
at the hands of St. Mary's to account
for, as well as a narrow escape from the
Olympic Club. The Trojans remember!
vividly a game last Saturday which i
rankles becausc they deserved to lose.'
And there is another little matter also
ending in a 13-12 score which U.S.C.
would like to avenge.
Ihe Trojans are coming prepared to
take the victory which has been withheld
them for two years. They have a team I
which is superior in every department of
the game to the Herd of 1926. They
have backs galore, Williams, Elliott, Cap
tain Drury, Edelson, Thomas, Chambers, j
and Kemp. They have kickers in Drury,
Elliott, and Hibbs. They have a line l
which, though not equal to that of pre-1
vious years, is equal man for man to'
that of the Cards.
Besides these qualifications, the Trojans,
most certainly have the desire to win the
game. Their coaches, many of whom
have been beaten by Stanford teams, have'
for the past week been pointing the Herd
for this tilt. Then the Trojans may
remember the victories which the Cardi-1
nals took last year in all five of the major
sports. To the winner of this Conference'
classic may well go the title of Pacific ;
Coast champion.

Furthermore the Herd is coming from
a city that is favoring Stanford to win
at odds of five to four, and that is an
ideal situation in the mind of Howard
Jones. But the Trojans must remember
that northern California is reluctantly
admitting that the Cardinals are entering
the fray tomorrow as underdogs. And
that, as history also shows, is the best
news heard on the Farm for many days.

conference race, the Stanford-Southernj
California tilt will be an attempt of two j
teams to redeem themselves in the eyes I
of their backers. Stanford has a defeat'
at the hands of St. Mary's to account
for, as well as a narrow escape from the
Olympic Club. The Trojans remember!
vividly a game last Saturday which i
rankles becausc they deserved to lose.'
And there is another little matter also
ending in a 13-12 score which U.S.C.
would like to avenge.
Ihe Trojans are coming prepared to
take the victory which has been withheld
them for two years. They have a team I
which is superior in every department of
the game to the Herd of 1926. They
have backs galore, Williams, Elliott, Cap
tain Drury, Edelson, Thomas, Chambers, j
and Kemp. They have kickers in Drury,
Elliott, and Hibbs. They have a line l
which, though not equal to that of pre-1
vious years, is equal man for man to'
that of the Cards.
Besides these qualifications, the Trojans,
most certainly have the desire to win the
game. Their coaches, many of whom
have been beaten by Stanford teams, have'
for the past week been pointing the Herd
for this tilt. Then the Trojans may
remember the victories which the Cardi-1
nals took last year in all five of the major
sports. To the winner of this Conference'
classic may well go the title of Pacific ;
Coast champion.
Coach Howard Jones and his Thunder
ing- Herd will pass through Palo Alto
early this morning bound for parts yet
unknown to do their last bit of practice
in order to follow the dictates'of history,
h or the annals of foutball show that the
Trojans are invincible at Palo Alto, that
they have won four games here and lost
three at Los Angeles.
