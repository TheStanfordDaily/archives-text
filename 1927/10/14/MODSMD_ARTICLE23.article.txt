# Tomorrow's the Day!
## 
### 
Stanford opens its Conference season with an opponent
which, barring California, could not be a more desirable team from
which to win. A number of reasons, some of which originated in past
games, make this statement true. To begin with, Stanford has never
defeated U.S.C. in the stadium. During the past two years Warner's men
have defeated the Trojans in their Coliseum, but in previous encounters
here U.S.C. has carried off the honors.
Next, remembering the track episode of last spring, each institution
is making every effort, with one exception, to re-establish "friendly rela
tions" once more. The notable exception lies in the fact that neither insti
tution is willing to accept defeat to more firmly establish those "friendly
relations." And such is as it should be—otherwise the game wouldn't be
worth seeing.
MORE immediate reason for making victory so highly desired by
each of the contestants is their showing in previous games. Stanford
lost to St. Mary's 16-0, and was content with a 20-2 victory from Nevada.
The Crimson and Gold eleven, on the other hand, had difficulty with the
Oregon Aggies, barely emerging victorious, 13-12. Both of tomorrow's
contestants are eager to show the Coast —the country —that preliminary
games do not always tell the tale.
Speaking of scores, 13-12 is a hoodoo for U.S.C. That score, re
versed, it will be remembered, was the outcome of last-year games with
both Stanford and Notre Dame. The one-point margin is a serious thing
in the eyes of Southern California rooters. What if U.S.C. should lose
tomorrow by a lone point!
THROUGH crafty work on the part of Coach Warner, Stanford's newly
elected captain will lead a team of men anxious to show by their playing
that they are first-string material. The uncertainty of "who's who" in the
backfield which has characterized the Cardinal lineup during the prelimi
nary season has produced a number of backs each pointed toward this
game as being his chance to cinch a berth as a regular. Linemen, too,
realize that some are going to be classed by fans as second- or third-string
material after tomorrow's game and none is anxious to be rated as such.
An assembly today will give Stanford students an opportunity to hear
U.S.C.'s highest student body officer discuss the cementing of "good-will"
between the two institutions. In all, tomorrow's affair has more color,
more interest, in it than any past contest between the Cardinals and
Trojans has ever possessed.
