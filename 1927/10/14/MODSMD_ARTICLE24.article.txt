Approximately 80,000 visitors will be on the campus tomorrow and
the University colony of 4000 will be faced with the task of entertaining
them. Dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, faculty homes, and
the stadium parking area will be the scene of this monster reception.
"Stanford hospitality" will receive one of its annual tests and to some

mean much that is pleasant. The problem of "selling the University," in
the jargon of our advertising go-getter friends, is a matter to be solved
by the living-group organizations as well as by each student. A student
may do nothing more tomorrow than pleasantly direct a visitor, but that
particular act may be of more benefit than a poorly managed entertain
ment schedule on the part of a living group.
Stanford's 4000 students and faculty have their work cut out for
them. The Golden Rule is the most applicable suggestion for handling
the task.
