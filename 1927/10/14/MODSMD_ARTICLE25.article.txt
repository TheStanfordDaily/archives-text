# Two Bottles of Beer

### 
The W.C.T.U. breaks into print too much for its importance. Con
sider the following gem culled from a nearby exchange:
MUSKOGEE, Okla.â€”Because two bottles of beer were found in her
iccbox, Mrs. M. E. Hunt, for years a member of the Woman's Qiristian
Temperance Union, has sued the temperance organization for $75,000.
The W.C.T.U. members, according to Mrs. Hunt's petition, accuscd
Mrs. Hunt of breaking the organization's pledge never to taste intoxicants.
Mrs. Hunt says she was using the beer on a physician's orders.
To our mind the W.C.T.U. lost an excuse for its existence with the
passage of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. Its chief
function now seems to be in the promulgation of publicity advertising its
adherence to the national laws. We hope that Mrs. Hunt wins her case
and takes the $75,000.
