# And Then Our a Little SALLY...

### 
And, my dear, the assignment tliey
gave me was to get the dope on the game
next Saturday between Stanford and
U.S.C. 1 thought the best way was to
have an interview with some one who
knew all about it, and he was really the
nicest man. Not a typical brute football
player, but a gentleman whom we girls
could easily introduce to our best friends.
It was such a lovely moonlight night
that we thought, 1 mean, I wanted every
thing explained to me, so we went down
to the Stanford Stadium where they
were going to play.
Yes, Of Course
Of course, I wanted to go on the field
so that 1 would be sure to understand the
plays. But he said that he could explain
all the tackles and passes just as well in
the bleachers.
And he drew the cutest little marks on
a paper to show how the plays worked.
My dear, it was wonderful. And I don't
see how those U.S.C. men can possibly
win when the Stanford men start doing
those funny things with the ball. And
there was a lateral pass that was simply
fascinating. But I really don't under
stand why the player has to drop back
and then throw the ball to someone else.
Why doesn't lie just run with it to the
goal posts, they are usually right behind
him when they pull that play.
Victory Would Be Nice
And this football man was so nice and
charming and of course his car was gor
geous and he comes from a nice family.
I'm sure that all football men should
come from nice families, it gives morale
to the team, dont you know. And I'm
sure that with such a fascinating man to
be in it, the game will be wonderful Sat
urday and that the Stanford men just
can't help but win.
