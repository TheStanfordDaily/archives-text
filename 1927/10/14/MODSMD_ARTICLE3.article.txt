# CARDINAL SWIMMERS APPEAR CERTAIN OF COAST CHAMPIONSHIP
## Backstroke Race Only Weak Spot; Breast Stroke Is Strongest Event 
### 
Despite the loss of several record- j
holding men, this year's Cardinal swim
ming team has the brightest prospcct of
any on the Coast. The breast stroke
division is remarkably strong, and sprint
and long distance swimming and diving
are all well represented. The back stroke
has the poorest showing.
Entering this year to continue Stan
ford's line of famous divers is Pete Des
jardins, American National Champion.
Dcsjardins is working hard preparing
to win at Amsterdam next year. Under
Coach Ernie Brandsten's supervision he
is expected to be in condition to walk
away with the fancy spring-board, fancy
high, and plain high dives.
Mills, a good all-around man of long
experience, and Throndson arc back.
Warren Littlcfield, former holder of
the American 440-yard breast stroke rec
ord, Ophuls, and West have returned this
year and will make a very good breast
stroke team.
Sprint material is excellent; Harrison
and Pahl from last year's freshman team,
Van den Akker, and Bramel are going
strong. Penfield, a transfer from a junior
college at St. Louis, is the only real
varsity material for the back stroke.
Absence of Carl Stevenson, 440 and
back stroke man, and Ted Smith, star in
I back stroke and diving, will be most
; keenly felt. Other men not returning
are Bob Williams, 50-yard man; Wally
O'Connor, prospective Olympic games
sprint material; and Hobdy, last year's
freshman backstroker.
