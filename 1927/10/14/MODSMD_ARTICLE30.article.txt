Question: Why are there always so
many showers out of order in the gym?
Answer by Mr. E. S. Loder, Engineer
for Board of Athletic Control:
The heating system of the gym has
been outgrown. The several showers not
working are beyond fixing. One of the
best engineering firms in San Francisco
is drawing the plans now and an almost
completely new installation of showers
will be made as soon as possible, probably
during Christmas vacation.

Question: What is the best way to ad
dress mail to the Campus?
Answer by Mr. W. C. Werry, Post
master :
While the Campus station is now a
branch of the Palo Alto office, it receives
and dispatches mail as independently as
ever. Mail addressed to General Delivery,
a residence or box number, STANFORD
UNIVERSITY, CALIFORNIA, is de
livered here most expeditiously. If Palo
Alto is added to the address, mail is de
layed several hours.
