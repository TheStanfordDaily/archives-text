I have listened
To many "profs"
And hoped they would
Talk less.
Why can't they
Make orations
Like the McCreery
Rally address?

As we went by Encina on the way
home from the Rally, we heard this
parody on our new Stanford son, "On,
Men of Stanford" :
On, Stanford women,
A future awaits you;
All the men tremble
As your grades they can see—
boo,
hoo,
hoo!
You raise the average
That rolls many Freshmen
Out of our college dear
Into the cruel world.
I have listened
To many "profs"
And hoped they would
Talk less.
Why can't they
Make orations
Like the McCreery
Rally address?
