# COLORADO FRESHMAN PRESIDENT HAS JINX
## 
### 
Betting on football games, prize
fights, and politics in University of
Colorado circles is relegated to the
background with the advent of a new
sporting proposition in the college.
The question is whether or not the
new president of the freshman class
will flunk out during his first quarter.
The odds are 7 to 1 in the affirmative.
The jinx that lies over the head of
the yearling officer is the cause for
all the interest. In the past seven
years, only one student has succeeded
in holding the freshman presidency
without leaving at the end of his first
quarter because of scholastic short
comings.
