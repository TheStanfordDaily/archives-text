# Frat Houses Not Classed As Homes, Court Ruling
## 
### 
Fraternity houses are not to be classed
as homes in Omaha. This is the ruling of
the Supreme Court of Nebraska in a case
in which residents of an exclusive dis
trict protested against the actions of a
certain fraternity located in the vicinity.
"Late hours, queer noises, and the use
of abusive and sonorous musical instru
ments," were given as some of the dis
tractions caused by the nearby group of
Greeks which lost them their house's
position as a private residence.
