# PROSPECTS FOR POLO AGAIN BRIGHT AS LARGE SQUAD IS OUT
## 
### 
Prospects for another championship
polo team to represent Stanford this year
arc very bright if the abundance of ma
terial on hand at this early date can be
used as a criterion. More than forty-five
men have turned out for practice, thirty
of whom have had previous experience
on the Stanford polo squad.
Although the loss of Captain Fred
Trotter and Frank Rothrock of last
year's team will be felt, Tex Thompson
and Bud Post, lettermen playing num
bers two and three, are back to form a
nucleus, with Laurence Weymouth, Bill
Hollingsworth, George Connolly, Ralph
Mossman, and Moye Stephens of last
year's varsity squad fighting for the posi
tions left open by graduation.
