## SAINT CONTEST CRUCIAL GAME FOR FRESHMEN Future of Yearling Squad Will Be Decided in Stadium Tomorrow 
### Bob Speers 
Just as the future of Pop Warner's
varsity hangs to a great extent on
the results of the U.S.C. game, so the
question of what Stanford may ex
pect from its yearling squad will be
answered when the freshmen meet
St. Mary's in the stadium at 10
o'clock tomorrow.
Only one thing is absolutely cer
tain about the contest, and it is sim
ply that Husky Hunt's charges are
in for a busy morning. Dope is an
unsatisfactory thing when it comes
to solving the problem of who will
win.
St. Mary's and Stanford have only
met one team in common. That is
San Mateo Junior College whom the
Oaklanders beat, and who succeeded
in tying the Card freshmen. Such a
fact, in itself, does not look so prom
ising, but certain things enter in
which somewhat alter first appear
ances. In the first place, St. Mary's
played the collegians early in the
season —a time when football games
are won by fumbles and Lady Luck.
Also, the Stanford-San Mateo clash
went for only three quarters, because
of a scheduled varsity game. Had
there been time for the additional
period, the advantage would undoubt
edly have been with Hunt's outfit
because of its greater reserve
strength.
The freshman defeat last week at
the hands of Santa Clara was un
pleasant, but it must not be taken
too seriously. The yearlings were
weakened somewhat by the fact that
Winneck did not hold down the quar
terback berth, and because some of
the other regulars also were disabled.
The men who played in their places
filled the jobs well, but the holes in
the ranks necessitated shifts in the
line-up which put men in positions
with which they were unfamiliar. And
then, too, the game was called almost
a period before it was over.
Hunt has been pushing his squad
through stiff workouts this week, and
the team is looking better. The pass
ing of the centers, which was so pain
fully poor against Santa Clara, has
improved, and that fact alone will
increase Stanford's chances.
