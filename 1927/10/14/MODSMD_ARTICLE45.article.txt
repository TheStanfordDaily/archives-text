# CARDS, U.S.C. WILL BE ON EVEN TERMS, COACH DIETZ SAYS
## 
### 
"Stanford has a good team;
U.S.C. has a good team, even bet
ter than last year, and both will
start Saturday on even terms. And
the team that will win is the one
that will watch the little things."
That is the opinion of "Lone Star"
Dietz, assistant freshman coach
and football impressario in gen
eral.
"U.S.C. has three good backs,
each a triple threat man. Captain
Drury, Don Williams, and Howard
Elliott will mean trouble for Stan
ford. And unless Stanford snaps
out of it, they're going to have
hard going Saturday."
Dietz was the only member of
the Cardinal coaching staff who
would predict the outcome of the
game.
Captain Hal McCreery, when
asked how it would turn out, re
plied, "Aw, hell, I don't know."
