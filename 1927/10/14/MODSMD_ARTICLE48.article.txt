# SIX P.C.C. TEAMS START GRID RACE FOR LEAGUE TITLE
## 
### 
Following are Pacific Coast
Conference games scheduled for
tomorrow:
Stanford vs. U.S.C. at Palo Alto
California vs. Oregon at Portland
Washington vs. Montana at Mis
soula
Washington State vs. Gonzaga at
Spokane
Idaho vs. Whitman at Moscow
Six conference teams will take the
field tomorrow, and except in case of ties,
three of them will advance to the 1.000
per cent column for victories. Stan
ford's affair with the Trojans is called
the championship game of the Confer
ence.
Coach Nibs Trice's Bears take on Ore
gon State at Portland, with the Cali
fornians doped to continue their string
of victories. After a year of starvation
diet, the Golden Bears have made tasty
meals on the Santa Clara Broncos and
the Wolfpack from Nevada, and have
topped these off with a banquet at the
expense of St. Mary's.
Huskies Start Tomorrow
Washington starts its conference sched
ule tomorrow, after running up high
score victories over Willamette and sev
eral U.S. battleship teams. Montana
could be a more dangerous foe, but its
record of last week, when it lost 35 to 0
at the hands of Washington State, does
not indicate much trouble for Coach Bag
shaw's Huskies.
W.S.C. Meets Gonzaga
Gonzaga will provide a non-conference
game for Washington State, and might
furnish a surprise or two to those in the
know. The W.S.C. Cougars were given a
very bad shock when Mt. St. Charles
held them to a 6-6 tie. And since Gon
zaga is another small college and one
that delights in annually trouncing bigger
and stronger, rivals, much might happen
in the Northwest.
After being conceded the championship
of the conference for this year by virtue
of its easy schedule, Idaho ruined the
dope sheets last week with a scoreless
tie at Oregon State. This week the Van
dals have a practice game with Whitman.
