# New Seats Make Cardinal Stadium Largest In West
## 
### 
By November 1, Stanford will have
the largest football stadium in the
West, and the second largest in the
country. Adding the 16,000 seats now
under construction will give Stan
ford's bowl a capacity of 88,000, Board
of Athletic Control officials said yes
terday.
The addition consists of several
tiers of seats topping the old level,
and will be completed by next month.
Besides the 16,000 seat addition, all
the old seats have been painted and
the stairways repaired. A broadcast
ing station has been built in, and two
emergency first-aid stations will be
completed by the time of the Big
Game.
Franklin Field at the University of
Pennsylvania is the only football sta
dium larger than Stanford's will be.
It has a capacity of 94,000. Soldier's
Field in Chicago can seat 110,000, but
only by using 25,000 temporary emer
gency seats. The Memorial Stadium
at Berkeley seats approximately 78,-
000, about 3000 more than the Yale
Bowl accommodates. The University
of Washington bowl contains seats for
close to 45,000 spectators.
Stanford's new seat addition is built
on piles driven through the old em
bankment into the surface or original
ground. The walls are covered with
Dunnite, a preservative which will add
considerably to their life.
