# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, ’16 
Two of the strongest teams in the
country meet tomorrow in the annual
'football game between Stanford Univer
sity and Southern California. This game
is so rapidly growing in importance that
before long it will outdraw the Pacific
Coast's annual "P>ig Game," the Stan
ford-California battle.
The reasons for this are easily under
stood. While Stanford and California are
age-old rivals and the game between the
two universities has all the tradition and
history that go to make it the Yale-Har
vard game of the Far West, neverthe
less the Stanford-U.S.C. game has the
added intersectional interest to it that
the Big Game lacks. There is consider
able feeling between the southern part of
the state and the northern half, so the
old feud between Los Angeles and San
•Francisco looms up and adds more kick
to the U.S.C.-Stanford game.
The "Thundering Herd" of Southern
California also plays California, but since
tlie death of the Popular Andy Smith,

California has had no wonder teams, and
last year lost to U.S.C., 3 to 27, and to
Stanford, 6 to 41. Between those two
games Stanford and Southern California
put on a marvelous battle in the Los
Angeles Coliseum before 80,000 people,
Stanford finally winning, 13 to 12, after
being twelve points behind. Stanford won
by as fine a display of fight as any Car
dinal team ever showed. Dick Hyland,
the flashy half-back, starred in this game,
blocking U.S.C.'s try for goal after their
first touch-down, and later catching a 40-
yard pass and scoring Stanford's second
touch-down.
When foxy Glenn Warner and wily
Howard Jones meet, something tricky is
sure to happen. Both coaches stress of
fense over defense, although in the game
last year Stanford's great defense against
the Trojans' passing attack was one of
the features of the game. In Captain
Morlcy Drury, Howard Jones has a fine
quartet-back, for he is a strong runner,
good passer, and able field-general.
