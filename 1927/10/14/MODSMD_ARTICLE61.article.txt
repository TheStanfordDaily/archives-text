# POSTMASTER WERRY PREDICTS AIR MAIL USE FOR PENINSULA
## 
### 
Palo Alto is only thirty miles from
San Francisco, which is a landing
point on the San Francisco-Chicago-
New York transcontinental air mail
line, according to Postmaster W. C.
Werry, who states that this entire
region can easily use the air mail ser
vice under the new regulations.
"Air Mail," said Postmaster Werry, j
"goes anywhere in the United States, ;
traveling as much as possible of the
route by airplanes and the rest by
stage or train. From one- to two-thirds |
of the usual train delivery time is
save 011 air mail, depending on the i
distance.
"The flat rate on air mail letters to !
all points in the United States, Can-'
ada, and England is 10c per half !
ounce. A Lalf ounce is equal to an i
envelope and two sheets of average j
weight letter paper. Air mail stamps
are sold for convenience, but are not j
necessary. Use any postage—two five- '
cent stamps, five two-cent stamps, 1
etc. If the letter weighs more than a
half ounce it requires postage for a ;
full ounce, 20c. Neither are air mail
envelopes necessary. Simply write
"'Air Mail" plainly on the envelope 1
the stamps. Drop air mail en-'
velopes in any mail box or letter j
chute."
Besides the transcontinental air
mail line, Postmaster Werry said,
other lines operate along the Pacific j

and Atlantic coasts, south to Los An
geles and Dallas, north to Boise, Spo
kane, St. Paul, Detroit, Boston, and
to many other points, so that air mail
is delivered most anywhere in the
country in one or two days—three
days to the most distant places.
