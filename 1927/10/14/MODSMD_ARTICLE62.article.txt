# COAST TEAMS COVER 35,435 MILES DURING SEASON'S GAME TRIPS
## Southern California First With 6,644; Oregon Travels Least 
### 
Coast grid elevens will circle the
globe almost once and a halt during
their roamings this season. The nine
conference teams will travel 35,435
miles in less than two months.
Howard Jones and his pack of Tro
jan warriors lead the sightseers in
season mileage with 6644 miles. This
includes their journey to Chicago
where Notre Dame will be awaiting
them. The University of Oregon are
the most domestic. The Webfooters
will wander only a little more than
2500 miles, between Eugene and their
three out-of-town frays, in Portland,
Palo Alto, and Seattle.
Oregon State and Idaho lead in the
number of trips with five each, but
fail to pile up high mileage. The
Orangemen have but one long jour
ney, which was to Los Angeles last
week; three overnight stays in Port
land, which is less than ninety miles
from Corvallis; and one short ride of
forty miles to Eugene for the Web
foot Homecoming classic. Charley
Erb's Gem-starters will cover 4445
leagues, rating them fourth place in
the travellers' standing. The Vandals'
longest trip is to San Francisco for a
non-conference tilt with St. Mary's.
The shortest trip for a conference
game is made by the Idaho outfit to
Pullman, Wash., where they take on
the Washington State Cougars after
a nine-mile ride.
The nine teams in the conference
carry on the average a travelling
squad of twenty-five men, thus a total
of 885,875 miles will be traversed. If
one person attempted to ride this dis
tance, he would round the world
thirty-five times before his tirket was
used up.
Team mileage follows:
Southern California 6,644 mi.
Washington State 5,324 mi.
Montana 4,474 mi.
Idaho 4,445 mi.
Stanford 3,594 mi.
Univ. of Washington 3,206 mi.
Oregon State 2,978 mi.
