BERKELEY, Oct. 13—(P.1.P.) —
The German producer is still much
more of an idealist than the American
moving picture producer, in the opin
ion of Professor Hugo K. Schilling of
the German department of the Uni
versity of California.
"It is this, I think, which appeals
to the latent idealism in Americans,
and which accounts for the popular
ity of German films in this country,"
he says.
"We are, in America, fundamentally
idealistic. The desire to make of the
cinema an art, which actuates Ger
man film makers, finds a response in
us." Professor Schilling commented
on the American's dislike for an un
happy ending. "In this country, the
fortunate living conditions have
spoiled us a little. We are used to
happiness, and we refuse to consider
unhappiness, even though we know it
exists. In Europe unpleasant facts are
acknowledged as part of reality and
are shown in art."
