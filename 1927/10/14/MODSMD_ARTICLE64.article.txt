# HUSKIES CRIPPLED BY LOSS OF BRIX, WRIGHT
## 
### 
When the strong Huskies team lines
up against the Montana team Saturday
it will be without the services of two
veteran linesmen, Brix, tackle, and
Wright, guard. Although reports from
Seattle would indicate that the Huskies
are seriously crippled by their losses the
fact that only two regulars arc missing
from the lineup shows that the Montana
team is in for a hard afternoon.
With the backfield intact, and plenty
of reserves to call upon, Washington fig
ures to win its first conference game
without much trouble.
