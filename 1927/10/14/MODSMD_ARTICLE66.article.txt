# EASTERN TEAMS HAVE CRUCIAL BATTLES ON SATURDAY SCHEDULE
## 
### 
Tomorrow's games in the eastern con
ferences arc expected to furnish some of
the hardest tests for the favorites. Last
week showed several very unexpected
upsets, and this week will see the come
back of some and the downfall of other
title contenders.
The big attraction is the Navy-Notre
Dame game at Baltimore. The Navy
showed its strength when it walked over
Drake in a 35-6 win last Saturday. Yale
will have a tough job with Brown. The
"Iron Men" lost their first game since
the 1925 season last week against the
strong Penn State eleven. Yale lost to
Georgia in an upset; so both plan to
make this game a comeback. Princeton
will invade Washington and Lee, win
ners over Duke University last week.
Harvard will have a double purpose
in hand when it plays Holy Cross to
morrow, for last year Holy Cross trim
med them 19-4; that coupled with Har
vard's defeat by Purdue last Saturday
should make the game hard fought. Har
vard will have a chance to show whether
or not it can get out of the slump that
caused it to lose most of last year's
tilts. The Army will meet Davis Elkins
at West Point, and will try to perfect
the defense which let Marquette score
twelve points against their three touch
downs a week ago. Dartmouth should
win easily over Temple.
Following its victory over Harvard,
Purdue has been counted among the ser
ious contenders for the Big Ten title.
Minnesota, Michigan, Northwestern and
Ohio are the others who are expected to
come through.
Following is a list of the more im
portant eatsern games on tap tomorrow:
