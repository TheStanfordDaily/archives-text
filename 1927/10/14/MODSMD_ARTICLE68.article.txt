# PICTURES WILL SHOW SPEED OF GRID SQUAD
## 
### 
Movies of the Stanford football squad
charging against the multiple chronograph
will be shown at one of the local theatres
within a month or two, according to
Professor Walter Miles of the Psychol
ogy department. During practice periods
this quarter, Professor Miles has been
measuring the rapidity of the charge of
groups of players by means of an ap
paratus known as the multiple chrono
graph, which tests seven men at a time.
Although unable personally to super
vise the tests, Professor Miles has fol
lowed the results closely and expects to
send a cameraman out on the field in the
near future.
