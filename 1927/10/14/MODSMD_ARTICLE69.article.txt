# MO-1 IS TITLE BORNE BY NAVAL SEAPLANE OF AERO LABORATORY
## Method of Selecting Names For Planes Given by Professor Niles 
### 
"MO-l"—That is the seaplane which
was received by the Guggenheim Aero
nautics Laboratory a few days ago. it
was designed and built by the Glenn
Martin Company of Cleveland, in 1923
or thereabouts, says Professor A. S.
Niles of the aeronautics laboratory. Since
that time it has been in naval service at
San Diego, until it was donated to Stan
ford recently, because it was surplus
naval equipment.
"M" stands for Martin, the name of
the manufacturer; "O" for observation,
the purpose for which the plane was con
structed; "1" indicates that this was the
first design of observation plane con
structed by the Glenn Martin Company.
"This plane was one of the earliest
examples of metal wing construction,"
said Professor Niles. "Wooden wing ribs
and metal spars were unusual in construc
tion of planes at that time."
"This particular plane has been used at
San Diego about three years by the navy
in scouting and in spotting gun fire," he
stated.
"What sort of plane is this, an am
phibian or a seaplane," Niles was asked.
"This is a medium-sized, single-mo
tored seaplane designed as a monoplane.
A seaplane has a pontoon, or twin pon
toons, in which case the pontoons may be
removed and wheels substituted for use
in land flying. An amphibian plane is a
flying boat, one which can be used both
for flying over land and over water.
Wheels that can either be folded into
the fuselage or let down, depending
whether the plane is to land on water or
oil land. Amphibians have usually been
small; I can think of only one amphibian
built in the United States,' he answered.
The plane will be used in the aero
nautics laboratory for demonstration
purposes.
