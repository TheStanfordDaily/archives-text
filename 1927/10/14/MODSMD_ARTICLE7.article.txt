# INCREASED AIR CARGO REPORTED BY PACIFIC TRANSPORT COMPANY
## 
### 
Nearly 300,000 letters and parcels
were sent by air mail between all
coast cities last month, reports A. K.
Humphries, vice-president of the !
Pacific Air Transport Company. The
total weight was 7365 pounds, a gain
of 5G5 pounds over the preceding
month's cargo.
Improved facilities for overcoming!
treacherous weather are believed to I
account for the increasing patronage
of the air mail service between coast
cities. Extra planes are stationed at
strategic points in southern California
and the air mail is rushed to these
planes when the airport is fog-bound.
To combat adverse weather in the
Pacific Northwest, a specially built
motorcycle manned by a former race- 1
driver is held in readiness to carry j
the mail to the southbound plane be
yond the bad-weather area.
Fred Speers and Claude Conn,;
editor and business manager of the ]
Daily, will take the Pacific Air Trans-1
port line to Seattle Sunday.
