# STANFORD HAS OPPORTUNITY TO TIE RECORDS U.S.C. HOLDS FOUR WINS; CARDINALS THREE FIRST OF GRID CONTESTS FOUGHT OUT IN 1905
## 
### 
If Captain Hal McCreery and his team
score a victory tomorrow it will not only
mean that the Cardinals are a superior
aggregation this year, but it will bring
Stanford's list of games won from U.S.C.
up to the number of wins garnered by
the Trojans during years gone by. U.S.C.
has beaten the Red Shirts in four of
seven games played.
Back in 1905 a husky Card eleven
started the Trojan feud by trimming
the Southern Californians 10 to 0. Stan
ford had a powerful outfit that year, and
football fans here on the Farm were
disappointed in a mere 16 to 0 score. It
seems that the local team relied on heavy
mass plays during most of the game
without success. Then during the last
eight minutes things broke loose, and the
Cards did some fast and furious scoring.
Vandervoort made a hero of himself in
those last few minutes by receiving a
kickoff and dashing 70 yards for a touch
down. This same Stanford team beat
U.C. 12 to 5 later in the season.
Lean Years
Then came some lean years for the
Cardinals, who found the Trojans stiff

! competitionâ€”too stiff in fact. U.S.C. won
the 1919 game 13 to 0 after a fourteen
year interval during which competition
was abandoned. In '20 sledding was not
sq tough, and Stanford lost 10 to 0. The
1922 game gave the fans their money's
worth. It was terrifically fouht by two
evenly matched elevens, but the Trojan
horse galloped through for a win once
more. The score was 6 to 0. U.S.C.'s
outfit proved to be better again in 1912
and beat the Cardinals 14 to 7.
When the two schools met on the
gridiron in 1925 there was a different
drama enacted. Stanford whipped the
Southerners by a 13 to 9 tally, but it was
a hard earned victory. Mike Murphy j
made the run of the day when he inter
cepted a pass just before half time and j
romped 65 yards to a touchdown. The!
Trojans fought gamely during the second
half and threatened the winners by mak-!
ing nine points, but they lacked the neces- j
sary punch to get across a victory.
Cards Came From Behind
Last year Stanford and the University
of Southern California waged one of the
greatest football battles seen on the Pa

cific Coast during recent seasons. Pop
Warner's team beat U.S.C. 13 to 12,
coming from behind to win. It was a
wonderful game with a powerful offense
and a great defense executed by both
outfits.
