# SOCCER SQUAD MUST START SERIOUS WORK. SAYS HARRY MALONEY
## Varsity Shows Inability to Kick or Pass m Two Practice Tilts 
### 
Varsity soccer men will have to start!
serious work to be prepared to meet the j
University of California on November I
5, said Coach Harry Maloney yesterday.)
In the two practice games that have been I
played, the team has managed to win by
2-1 scores, but their showing was rather
poor because they made the same mis
takes in each game.
Lack of accuracy in passing and kick
ing has been the fault of the varsity in
each game, Maloney states. He believes
that constant practice and hard scrim-!
mages will correct these faults, but three
nights a week is not sufficient for prac
tice because the squad is so large. Start
ing Monday varsity men will report each
day.
The California team has been practic-.
ing since August 15, giving them a month
and a half before Stanford started.
No first team has been selected to play ;
regularly, but the men have been shifted'
and tried out to find their ability. Menl
have been changed from one position to
another; so that is a possible reason for j
the poor showings.
The lineup that did best against San I
Mateo Junior College was: Jennings,
outside left; Strowger, inside left;'
Wright, center forward; Farewell, inside
right; Gibbs, outside right; Frost, left;
half ; Smith, center half ; Fell, right half;!
Holmes, left fullback; Stollery, right
fullback; and Robinson, goal.
Others that are making strong bids
for positions and may replace any of
these men before the next game arc:
Dawson, Mayer, Silva, Taylor, Springer,
Birch, and O'Donnell. Some of these are j
members of the 1930 team and lack the j ,
experience of the first string men, but [
may develop quickly.
