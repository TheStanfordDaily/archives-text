OLD ORCHARD, Me., Oct. 13.â€”Al
though local weather conditions are aus
picious for a take-off, Mrs. Francis \V.
Grayson announced that she would not
start on her Copenhagen flight oefore
Friday morning at the earliest.
A wind amounting almost to a gale ac
companied by heavy rain which swept
this section today gave way to clear
skies and moderate winds late in the
afternoon.
In the storm Mrs. Grayson's Sikorsky
amphibian plane was buffeted about by
the inrushing tide and narrowly escaped i
being damaged. As the tide receded the j
plane was pulled up on the runway on j
the beach and given a thorough examina- i
tion. No damage was found.
