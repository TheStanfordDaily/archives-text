# EMERSON STRESSES STANFORD SINCERITY BEFORE EUPHRONIANS
## 
### 
"In debating at Stanford we try to
be sincere, to speak with sincerity,
and to dig up the truth rather than
cover it up." This was the conviction
expressed by Professor James Gordon
Emerson, debate coach, before the
Euphronia Society last evening.
"I believe that there are many men
who would enjoy competing on the
platform with their fellow students,
but they allow themselves to be brow
beaten out of participating in public
speaking," the forensic coach de
clared.
