# RELIGIOUS ATTITUDE HOPEFUL, SAYS Y.M.C.A. NATIONAL SECRETARY
## Students Question Church As an Organization, Is Porter's Belief 
### 
David R. Porter, national executive
secretary of the student division of the
Y.M.C.A., who 011 account of his position ■
is able to obtain a splendid idea of the'
composite thought of college students,
sees no real cause for alarm over the
evident lack of interest in religion among
college men and women. Porter, who
left the campus today after a two day j
visit here as a part of his tour of Pacific j
Coast colleges, when interviewed seemed
hopeful about the situation and not de
pressed, as are many other Christian
writers on the subject.
" I hat great indifference exists, is true," '
declared Porter, ''but it is toward organ-;
ized religion, rather than a total lack of 1
interest. I consider this a hopeful time!
when students in a spirit of search are
questioning organized creed and the or
ganized church. Such a discussion shows
that religion still holds a place in the
students' thought, and this spirit of criti- ■
cism is far more encouraging than an
attitude of unconcern."
