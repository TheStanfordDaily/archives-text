ITS ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION
Wlliam M. Proctor, Editor
A joint study of the junior college in actual operation, made by eleven men
who are in closc touch with the junior college movement and who speak
here from their practical experience as teachers and school executives.
"The timeliness of such a study is obvious, in view of the rapid growth of
the junior college movement in California as in other states. The fact that
these men are actively engaged in junior college work, and are here setting
forth the results of their experience, makes the book of real importance
to the educational world."—Sierra Educational Nczvs.

PERSONAL HYGIENE FOR WOMEN
By Clelia Duel Mosiier, M.D.
"Being a woman is no reason for not being perfectly well." On this belief
Dr. Mosher bases her study of health and habits, and her concise and
practical health rules. "Her book should be read by every college woman
and by every mother of girls fit to be sent to college."—
