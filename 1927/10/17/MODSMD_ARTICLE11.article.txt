# ST. MARYâ€™S WINS CLOSE GAME FROM BABE ELEVEN, 13-7
## MOFFIT IS OUTSTANDING Freshmen Outplay Visitors Through Major Part Of Grid Contest 
### 
Stanford's freshmen didn't win Sat
urday, but even in defeat they re
deemed their reputation in the eyes
of Cardinal fandom. After outcliarg
ing, outgaining, and outclassing St.
Mary's for almost four periods, the
yearlings let the visitors slip a long
pass behind their defense, and win
the game 12 to 7 in the last two min
utes of play.
Babes Improved
Hunt's team was a different outfit
against the Saints. It looked like a
football machine and played like one,
but the boys from the Farm didn't
succeed in scoring until the last quar
ter when Hardy recovered a fumbled
punt, and Moffit slipped through for
a nice gain which put his team within
tallying distance. Then Hardy bucked
the oval across, and Winneck con
verted.
Not more than a half dozen plays
later this same Hardy fumbled, and
Loftus scooped it up, dashing 65 yards
for a touchdown. The Saints failed to
convert, and the score stood 7 to 6.
From that point Stanford played
faultless football, with the line open
ing great holes through which the
backs trotted effortlessly. Another
Cardinal score seemed inevitable.
St. Mary's Scores 7
Then St. Mary's tightened, got con
trol of the ball, and began passing.
Right the nthe Stanford men let the
game slip by. Just three-quarters of
a minute before the final gun was
fired Boyle got under one of those
long heaves, and fell across the goal
line. St. Mary's didn't convert, but
the game was won.
Moffit stood out as the most spec
tacular player of the game. He was
good for a gain every time ho got the
ball, and not infrequently he reeled
off fifteen and twenty yards at a
crack. On top of that he kicked for
the Babes, and he booted well.
Caglieri played good ball all the
first half, then when he entered the
fray again in the fourth period he had
more fire, making himself hard to
catch, and being responsible for gain
after gain.
If as much improvement is shown
in succeeding weeks as was displayed
since the Santa Clara game the Card
babes may be counted upon to run in
a good account of themselves against
California and U.S.C.
