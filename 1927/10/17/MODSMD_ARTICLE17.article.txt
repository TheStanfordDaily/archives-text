## FALL, SINCLAIR GO ON TRIAL BEFORE JURY IN TEAPOT DOME CASE 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16. â€” With
keen suspense aroused by the deci
sion of the United States Supreme
Court last week, Albert 13. Fall, former
Secretary of the Interior, and Harry
F. Sinclair, millionaire oil man and
sportsman, go on trial before a jury
here tomorrow charged with conspir
acy to defraud the Government in the
leasing of Tepot Dome Naval Re
serves.
Reviewing in the civil case practi
cally the same evidence that will
come before the jury in the criminal
case, the Supremo Court last Monday
hold that Fall had been a "faithless
public officer,"and that the transac
tion was "made fraudulently by
means of collusion and conspiracy"
between him and Sinclair.
These deductions will not be per
mitted to go before the jury, in all
probability, and it remains to be seen
whether twelve laymen will reach the
same conclusions that were reached
by the highest court in the land.
The trial will bo held in the Su
preme Court of the District of Colum
bia, Justice Frederick Siddons presid
ing, and in the same courtroom in

which Fall and Doheny were acquitted
nearly a year ago on conspiracy
charge in the leasing of California
Naval Reserves.
The trail from Fall's ranch at Three
Rivers, N.M., where the Teapot Dome
lease apparently was first discussed,
to the jury box at Washington, is long
and devious. That meeting was New
Year's Eve, 1921. Sinclair and some
of his friends went in a private car
to talk to Fall. Three months later,
on April 7, 1922, Fall signed with Sin
clair the Teapot Dome lease turning
over to the big oil man the 9,000-acre
Naval Reserve in Wyoming.
The Government was to receive
about 17 per cent of this oil as its
royalty. The remainder was to be
given to Sinclair as payment for drill
ing the field. Of the 17 per cent Gov
ernment oil, two-tlilrds was to be
given to Sinclair as payments for
building steel tanks at the seaboard in
which to store the oil for future use
of the Navy.
The reason given for this transac
tion was that outside drillers were
draining the oil out of the reserve.
The Supremo Court holds this was
not the case and that Fall knew it, but
was seeking a pretext.
The Government charges that Fall
entered into a conspiracy to turn this
Naval Reserve over to Sinclair, that
he deceived other applicants for the

lease and maneuvered so that no one
except Sinclair had passed to Fall
$230,500 in Liberty Bonds.
Transfer of these bonds, the Gov
ernment charges, was covered up by
creating the Continental Trading Com
pany, a Canadian concern which made
an oil resale contract, the profits of
which were converted into Liberty
Bonds, part of which were traced to
Fall.
The Supreme Court says that it is
plain the Continental Trade Company
was "created for some illegitimate
purpose."
Three years later Sinclair sent Fall
$25,000' in Liberty Bonds. It was later
explained that this was a loan. But
the Court, reviewing circumstances of
the transaction, said, "it is obvious
that this was not a straightforward
transaction."
