## 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 16. —A cloud of doubt
passed over all recent claims of swim
ming the English Channel today fol
lowing Dr. Dorothy Logan's amazing
confession that her "victory" over the
turbulent waters last week was mere
ly "a hoax to end hoaxes."
The British ideal of sportsmanship
was profoundly shocked.
Echoes of Dr. Logan's confession,
made after she had been awarded a
prize of $5,000 by the News of the
World, that she did not swim the
channel at all —to say nothing of her
claim that she broke Gertrude
Ederle's record —were heard in the
press, in speeches of notables, and in
the conversation of the masses.
Tho London physician's confession
came Saturday after many sections of
Great Britain had vied in claiming a
share in the reflected glory of her sup
posed achievement. Newspapers called
her "our channel heroine." Lord Birk
enhead referred to her as "this in
domitable lady."
"Who really did swim the English
Channel?" all England now is asking.
