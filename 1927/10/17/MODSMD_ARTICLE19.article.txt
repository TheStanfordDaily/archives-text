# ADMISSION WARD OF CONVALESCENT HOME NEARING COMPLETION
## Capacity of McLaughlin Unit Increased to Forty-Six By New Addition 
### 
Work on the new admission ward of
the McLaughlin Unit at the Stanford
Convalescent Home is nearing comple
tion, and is expected to be ready for oc
cupancy within the next month. This ad
dition supplies a badly needed place, not
only for the purpose planned, but in in
creasing the capacity of the hospital to
forty-six children.
The ward, which has been added to the
north side of the McLaughlin Unit, con
tains rooms for six extra beds, where
children may be kept for the first week
or two and allows them to become ad
justed gradually to their new surround
ings. A large sunporch opens from these
rooms, after the plan used in the other
buildings. An isolation room, utility
room, treatment room, locker room, are
also provided for in the new unit.
The Convalescent Home is filled to
the capacity at the present time. Eighteen
of the children are enrolled in regular
school work under Mrs. Gladys Herring
ton, who is the present teacher.
The grounds of the Convalescent Home
are in excellent condition at the present
time, owing to the work put in by cer
tain students during the two weeks be
fore Stanford registration day. Accord
ing to Miss Spandy, in charge of the
Home, miscellaneous work of all types
was performedâ€”from washing windows,
carrying wood, to oiling bed castors, and
mending chairs.
