## PASS IS BIG SURPRISE Brilliance of Drury Shows All-American Calibre Of U.S.C. Captain 
### Milton Silverman 
Pop Warner and Howard Jones
staged a battle in the Stanford sta
dium last Saturday in which the
Cardinal veteran retained his title of
the "foxiest coach of football," out
guessing his younger rival in the last
minutes to save Stanford with a 13
to 13 tie.
For nearly three quarters Morley
Drury, the greatest Ail-American pos
sibility in the West in three years,
outran, outplayed, and outshone a
Stanford team. And then, with but a
few minutes to play, "Pop" changed
his tactics, opened a passing attack
that took the ball to the Southern
California 21-yard line, and then sent
in Herb Fleishhacker for Hoffman.
Biff had played the greatest game of
his life, but he could not equal Fleish
liaeker, who made eighteen yards
through center in seven consecutive
plays. With only a few seconds to go,
Pop again displayed his genius, and
sent in Patchett with orders for the
next play. The Trojans, waiting for
another terrific line smash, had no
expectation of a pass, and Fleish
hacker's left-handed throw to Vincenti
earned the three yards to the goal
line and to the tying score.
Drury Stars
Morley Drury, Captain of the Tro
jans, gave the sixty thousand spec
tators an exhibition of great football.
Throughout the game he carried the
ball forty times, for an average gain
of 4y 2 yards. He knocked down the
Stanford passes, ran back the kicks,
and for a Jong time made the Card
offensive look Very we&k and futile.
In, the first quarter, however, It was
his teammate, Saunders, who was
lucky enough to be around when Wil
ton made his only fumble £»112 the game, (
Saunders grabbed the ball and raced
thirty yards for a touchdown. Drury
converted to give the Trojans a
seven-point lead.
Wilton Makes Long Run
Wilton got his revenge from Saun
ders late in the second quarter when
the Cardinals were driven back to
their own 10-yard line. Sims made six
teen yards on a reverse to §tart oil
the drive; Wilton finished it by snag
ging a twenty-nine-yard pass right
out of Saunders' arms and running
forty-five yards to a touchdown.
U.S.C.'s second score came in the
second quarter after Stanford was
penalized for holding and the Trojans
were given the ball on the nine-yard
line. The try for goal was blocked.
Not till the last period did the Stan
ford fighting spirit show its existence.
Faced with inglorious defeat, the Red
shirts took the ball on their own
thirty-yard line, made twenty on a
freak pass, and another throw netted
nine more. Fleishhacker went in, made
eighteen yards on line bucks, and
threw to Vincenti for the tying score.
Murphy's try for goal was short.

sibility in the West in three years,
outran, outplayed, and outshone a
Stanford team. And then, with but a
few minutes to play, "Pop" changed
his tactics, opened a passing attack
that took the ball to the Southern
California 21-yard line, and then sent
in Herb Fleishhacker for Hoffman.
Biff had played the greatest game of
his life, but he could not equal Fleish
liaeker, who made eighteen yards
through center in seven consecutive
plays. With only a few seconds to go,
Pop again displayed his genius, and
sent in Patchett with orders for the
next play. The Trojans, waiting for
another terrific line smash, had no
expectation of a pass, and Fleish
hacker's left-handed throw to Vincenti
earned the three yards to the goal
line and to the tying score.
Drury Stars
Morley Drury, Captain of the Tro
jans, gave the sixty thousand spec
tators an exhibition of great football.
Throughout the game he carried the
ball forty times, for an average gain
of 4y 2 yards. He knocked down the
Stanford passes, ran back the kicks,
and for a Jong time made the Card
offensive look Very we&k and futile.
In, the first quarter, however, It was
his teammate, Saunders, who was
lucky enough to be around when Wil
ton made his only fumble £»112 the game, (
Saunders grabbed the ball and raced
thirty yards for a touchdown. Drury
converted to give the Trojans a
seven-point lead.
Wilton Makes Long Run
Wilton got his revenge from Saun
ders late in the second quarter when
the Cardinals were driven back to
their own 10-yard line. Sims made six
teen yards on a reverse to §tart oil
the drive; Wilton finished it by snag
ging a twenty-nine-yard pass right
out of Saunders' arms and running
forty-five yards to a touchdown.
U.S.C.'s second score came in the
second quarter after Stanford was
penalized for holding and the Trojans
were given the ball on the nine-yard
line. The try for goal was blocked.
Not till the last period did the Stan
ford fighting spirit show its existence.
Faced with inglorious defeat, the Red
shirts took the ball on their own
thirty-yard line, made twenty on a
freak pass, and another throw netted
nine more. Fleishhacker went in, made
eighteen yards on line bucks, and
threw to Vincenti for the tying score.
Murphy's try for goal was short.
Pop Warner and Howard Jones
staged a battle in the Stanford sta
dium last Saturday in which the
Cardinal veteran retained his title of
the "foxiest coach of football," out
guessing his younger rival in the last
minutes to save Stanford with a 13
to 13 tie.

Drury, the greatest Ail-American pos
sibility in the West in three years,
outran, outplayed, and outshone a
