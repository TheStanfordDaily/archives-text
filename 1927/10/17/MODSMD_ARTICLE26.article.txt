A spectator at last Saturday's football game, seeing U.S.C. ancl
Stanford in athletic competition for the first time, would have a hard
time believing that there had ever been any differences between the two
on the score of sportsmanship. Except for a little "boo"ing at close
decisions, we have never seen a better display of friendly feeling. We
are glad to note this disturbance came, not from the rooting sections,
but from others who, perhaps, do not realize they are showing very bad
taste.
Whether or not the good-will assemblies sponsored last week by both
student bodies were contributory causes to the attitude at the game is a
matter of conjecture, but at least the spirit which prompted the assem
blies carried over to the game, both among the students and among the
contestants themselves.
Good sportsmanship should be presumed, so why hold advertising
conventions to promote it? The student bodies at U.S.C. and Stanford
should assume that "the esprit de corps that exists among gentlemen"
is a matter of course, and cease the ballyhooing that "We're all right
and they're all wrong."
Henceforward, let us consider the matter as closed.
