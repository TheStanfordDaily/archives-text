# Vive La Lower Division
## 
### 
"No determination for the elimination of the Lower Division has
been made by the Board of Trustees" is an excerpt from a resolution
passed by that body at a meeting - held last Thursday. Yet in the same
resolution, 350 was set as the limit for new men students to be admitted
to that popular and exclusive group known as the "Lower Division."
The arbitrary fixing of the number has a special significance when
linked with the knowledge that 450 freshman and sophomore men were
admitted this quarter.
By the simple process of deduction, it appears that the rumored
policy of the University, to completely eliminate the Lower Division is
now in the process of being carried out.
This policy is meeting with loud cries of protest from many alumni
and students. The students take the matter less seriously than "the old
grads" because most of them have gotten the benefit, or are getting it.
from the first and second years at Stanford, and haven't yet had time to
think of the effect on posterity. On the other hand, the alumni consider
it will be hard on their children.
Several aspects of the situation can be considered. In the first place,
endowments from private sources are apparently going to be used to
improve the upper division curricula and sundry of the graduate schools.
The logical source of these endowments is the great body of alumni
who are always enthusiastic for the University. One of the strongest
bonds which holds them to the college is the football team. When they
have something like the respective merits of football teams to argue
about, the college spirit never dies. This new plan would, of course, be
a serious blow to future Stanford football prospects, and probably would
topple her from her high pinnacle in local and natoinal football circles.
The same spirit cannot be distilled in two years as in four.
It has been suggested that this plan would not change our football
situation because an alteration in the eligibility rules could be effected
to allow a man to compete during one year following that in which he
receives his bachelor's degree. There seems to be no question about the
Pacific Coast Conference making this change. But would it? There
seems no particular justice in making special allowances for one college
when the other eight have different rules, and those eight are quite
likely to take that attitude. Even if they did, there would be few fifth
year men who could afford to spend the time necessary to devote to
football.
Another angle to the fifth-year rule is also presented, and that
involves the financial situation. Stop to consider how much more that
fifth year is going to cost. It's surprising to see the number of
students who are now wholly or partially earning their way through
Stanford. The University alone is aiding, by scholarships or gifts, some
one hundred students. The result will be that the student who can afford
to take the fifth year will be so immersed in his studies and earning a
living he won't have time for athletics.
From the cultural standpoint, Junior Colleges would not offer as
much as a University. During his freshman and sophomore years, the
student is more impressionable, and when exposed to the ideals and
curriculum of a University like Stanford, is bound to gain more than
if forced to go to a Junior College. The latter has not the facilities. It
cannot afford to pay the salary demanded by the best professors, and
can't overcome the small-town atmosphere.
George Herbert Palmer, professor-emeritus of philosophy at Har
vard University, sees the Junior College idea as the very antithesis of
the best element in educational ideals—the one good element which
characterizes American education as distinct from European education
■—its ability to send out into the business world men who, although their
chief interest is business, have been in contact with the cultural side of
life and consequently are prepared to pass on the cultural spirit to the
communities in which they live. Nobody could accuse a Junior College
of offering this cultural side of life. It's the University with the back
ground which can do that for the student.
The elimination of the Lower Division would probably be practicable
for those following the professions, which require five years or more of
college work to complete the course. 1 lowever, the majority of students
in the University are not majoring in the professional schools, and it is on
them that the proposed elimination would work a hardship.
From a financial, cultural, and athletic standpoint, we can well cry
"Vive La Lower Division!"
