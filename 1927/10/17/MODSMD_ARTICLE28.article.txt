A High Hat for Hollywood
The recent decision of University
of Southern California to give a four
year course in movie-making, while
a little shocking to conservative edu
cators, seems a most admirable resort
to protective coloration and adapta
tion to the times.
Courses in architecture, physics,
cliemfstry, literature, composition,
dramatics, and criticism as well as
cinematography will distinguish the
curriculum. Hollywood has at last
made the social grade and will doubt
less assume the more temperate vices
of the Intelligentsia as fast as pro
duction can be gotten under way in
the classrooms.
It may even be that motion picture

stories will sometimes be raised to
the artistic level of photography now,
but tastes differ so. Many people
praised Mr. DeMille's version of the
Ten Commandments.
At any rate it's one sure thing that
whether or not cinema technique may
raise the educational standards of
U.S.C., a university education won't
do the movies any harm.
So, applause to our enterprising
southern neighbors! And a little sigh
of thanks that Stanford is far enough
from the Los Angeles and Hollywood
Chambers of Commerce so that we do
not have to sponsor Movies and
Higher Education into a fadeout
clinch —and keep a straight face about
it. —Donald Gledhill.
