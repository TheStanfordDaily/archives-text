I mean, I think it really was won
derful the way we got into that of
ficial parking space so close to the
stadium. And when we parked right
next to the President's car, I was
thrilled to death. From then on, I
didn't think I could breathe, I was so
excited, athletics simply make me so
nervous. I mean, the terrible thing
was, it was so dusty, and no girl
wants to go to a game with dust on
her face. And I missed the kick-off '
trying to get my face straight again, j
Wasn't it the funniest thing when !
the photographers ran back and forth ;
so often to get their pictures. And 1 1
thought I'd expire when that player
asked the man to blow his whistle
so that he could get off the ball. But
do you know, I didn't think that girls
would be so awful as to yell and
scream right into your ears. And the
one next to me was simply terrible.
I don't think that really refined girls
would let their hair grow and not pin
it up. I mean, I was so ashamed for
her that I had a hard time watching
all the intricate plays like triple
passes and things. She became actu
ally annoying, because when nice girls
know football men personally, they
don't say intimate things right out
loud. And the next time I see him, I
shall hint about being careful about
the girls one knows.' I think football
games are wonderful because they
are fine to talk about afterwards. I
mean, every girl should have some
repartee in case she happens to be
in a position where she has to say
something quickly without thinking.
And football men are just fascinating.
