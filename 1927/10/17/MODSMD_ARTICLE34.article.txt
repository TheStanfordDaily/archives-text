## MASTER STRATEGY 
### 
The varsity thoroughly proved
itself in last Saturday's game
with U.S.C., though perhaps not
to the great surprise of anyone,
even the Trojans. Football fol
lowers have learned that reliance
may as safely be placed in Pop
Warner as in the Bank of Eng
land. When Pop sent in Herb
Fleishhacker to buck the ball to
the line and then pass, he demon
strated again that he is a master
of last-minute strategy. Warner's
resourcefulness and the Stanford
fight unite to provide thrilling
fourth quarters, e.g., the 1924 Big
Game.
Decision to give the Trojans the
ball on Stanford's nine-yard line
when Preston held Boren, who
was going down the field on
U.S.C.'s punt, was one of the
moot questions of the game. Head
Linesman Badenock's ruling pre
vailed, and the way was paved for
a Red and Gold score.
A PARALLEL CASE?
Now, Franklin B. Morse's report
of tyie California-Oregon game in
the Chronicle declared that
"Woodie (0) got off a punt good
for 43 yards, which Newman ran
back to his (California's) 38-yard
mark, but the Californian's were
penalized for holding, and the ball
went to Oregon at midfield."
Is this not a parallel case to the
one which provoked the big argu
ment Saturday?
It's the bottom of the column",
but it is not too late to predict
that Morley Drury will be an All
- halfback this year. Ed
Hughes called him "as fine a back
field man as ever played in the
West."
Those close to the sidelines said
that on one of many occasions
when the Trojan skipper went
down with three or four husky
Cards on top of him in a flop that
would have brought a grunt from
the toughest back, Drury came up
laughing and singing, "We've won
the game, we've won the game."
This was of course before the
Cardinals' drive to tie the score
started.
He's good, and Stanford is as
willing as any to recognize his
ability. —Templeton Peck.

This was of course before the
Cardinals' drive to tie the score
started.
He's good, and Stanford is as
willing as any to recognize his
ability. —Templeton Peck.
