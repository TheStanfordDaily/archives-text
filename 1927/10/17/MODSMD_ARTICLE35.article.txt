The Editor, Sir:
Are we about to lose another tra
dition?
* This morning one of our most popu
lar professors advocated, with some
merit, the abandonment of the bonfire 1
at the Big Game Rally. He main
tained that it did not serve to increase
school spirit, but rather that if the
spirit needed something of that sort l
to pep it up, it didn't amount to a
heekuvalot. He also mentioned the
terrible waste of fuel, and the number
of hours that the poor, brain-starved
frosh had to work on it, when they
could least afford it.
On the other hand, it makes the
yearling men feel as though they had
some integral part in the victory, or !
—woe is me! —a common bond in de-1
feat if such a catastrophy is destined !
ever to happen again. In other words, [
it helps them get on the boat.
This ought to provoke a little dis- j
cussion, anyway. Why not have a
"weenie-bake" afterwards?
Ever thine,
"PARK," '31
