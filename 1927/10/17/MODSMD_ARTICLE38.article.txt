Dear Miss Hall,
Sorry to disturb you but I found a
purse containing a telegram to you
from your friend, brother, cousin, or
uncle —I don't know which. But I
thought I would try and find out if I
could. But first I might as well explain
how I found it. While we were in
Frisco it come floating by the ship
and of course me being one of the
boat's crew that brings visitors aboard
ship and one of the first to see it,
I did one of Tom Mix's- Trix's. I
straddled the gunnel of the boat,
leaned down, and picked it up out of
the water. Then I took what it con
tained, let them dry, and put them
away. But somebody stoled the purse
but left what it contained. So if you
want the stuff please write me at once
und I will send it to you all but the
purse and I will pay for it or buy you
a new one. Well I will close after
asking you to please excuse this writ
ing.
