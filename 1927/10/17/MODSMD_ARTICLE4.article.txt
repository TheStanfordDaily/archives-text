# ADVANCE DEADLINE FOR PURCHASE OF BIG GAME TICKETS
## 
### 
"Because students have had
only from October 1 to make ap
plications for tickets for the Big
Game, the Board of Athletic
Control has decided to give them
until 6 p.m., tomorrow, to make
their applications out and have
them in the office at the Encina
Gym, not in the mail," according
to Jake Irwin, who is in charge
of ticket distribution.
"Opportunity to apply for tick
ets should have closed last Sat
urday evening, but so great a
number of the students had
neglected to apply for them that
the time has been extended."
