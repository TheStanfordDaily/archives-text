# Soviet Ambassador Leaves Paris for Berlin Secretly
## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 17. â€”Disregarding all
diplomatic custom, Christian Rakow
sky, recalled soviet ambassador to
France, today took French leave of
Paris.
Without presenting letters of recall
or paying any of the usual diplomatic
visits to President Doumergue, Pre
mier Poincare, and Foreign Minister
Briand, Ambassador Rakowsky secret
ly left the Russian embassy with his
family at 6 a.m., bound for Berlin.
The secret departure, made by auto
mobile, prevented political manifesta
tions and was regarded in the Quai
d'Orsay as a direct snub.
Rakowsky was recalled last week
by Foreign Minister George Tchicher
in after France had requested twice
that the ambassador be replaced.
