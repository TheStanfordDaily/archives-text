# MOVIE DISPUTE STILL REMAINS UNSETTLED
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. IG.—"What's the
matter with the movies?" remained
unanswered as came the dawn today
and the producers, distributors, and
exhibitors of the two billion dollar
industry faced the same old life anew
after a week of failing to agree upon
an understandable "code of ethics."
Federal Trade Commissioner Abram
F. Meyers' hopes that the industry
would voluntarily straighten out its
own tangle in regard to what was
fair and what was unfair, especially
in regards to "block booking" failed
to come true.
Such will be the disposition of the
contest over compulsory "block book
ing," as embodied in the commission's
"cease and desist" order to the Para
mount-Famous Players-Lasky Corpora
tion. The order becomes effective No
vember 1, but there is every indica
tion that the question involved will be
fought through to the Supreme Court.
Out of the hodge-podge of minor
resolutions, such as that forbidding
pictures showing ridicule to the
clergy, the depiction of infants in the
all-in-all, or technique of opium smok
ing or murder, there arose but one
important accomplishment. This was
the creation of an arbitration commit
tee to draw up a new standard exhibi
tion contract.
