# WILD PUTTERS I HAVE KNOWN
## 
### Feg Murray 
"Putt," according to a "Glossary of
technical terms employed in the game
of golf" in Spalding's Golf Guide,
means "to play the delicate shots
close to the hole." As at least half
the strokes of a par round of golf are
taken on the putting greens, it is
easy to see how important the club
that makes "the delicate shots close
to the hole" is. And right there lies
the trouble with many a player's put
ting. The ball goes to the hole, but
not into it.
Ever since the late Walter Travis
went over to England in 1904 and won
the British amateur championship
with his Schenectady putter, freak
clubs for use on the greens have been
turned out in large numbers, and the
best way I can describe some of them
is that the imaginative, grotesque

creations of my own in the above
cartoon are not very different from
some actually on sale.
The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of
Scotland immediately barred the
Schenectady type of putter from fu
ture British championships, but Mr.
Travis had already won the cup and
it was more or less a case of locking
the stable door after the horse had
been stolen. Only Walter Travis was
guilty of no bit of thievery, for the
type of putter that he used and vari
ations of it are quite legal in America.
The "Dear Old Ladies of St.
Andrews" kicked because the shaft
of the Schenectady putter was not
fixed at the heel of the club, but at a
point above a third of the way from
the heel to the other end (the toe,
perhaps!). A club like that is 0.K.,
says the United States Golf Associ

ation, but it bars other clubs of the
mallet-headed type.
"The U.S.G.A. will not sanction any
substantial departure from the tradi
tional and accepted form and make of
golf clubs," so say the rules. Also,
"the ball must be fairly struck at with
the head of the club, not pushed,
scraped, nor spooned." Mr. Folger's
croquet style of putting, while all
right in a friendly little game, would
never do in a sanctioned tournament.
No, indeed! Neither would Nick Alt
rock's billiard-style putting, using the
end of the shaft handle to hit the
ball, while lying down on the green
011 his stomach.
There have been many novel put
ting methods besides those of Mr. Du
Pre and Mr. Folger. Some golfers
have been content to be only unortho
dox enough to putt with one hand,
while others have gone so far as to
putt kneeling down. Putters with foot
long shafts and putters with a pro
jecting handle like a scythe have been
tried out by various ambitious, though
eccentric golfers.
