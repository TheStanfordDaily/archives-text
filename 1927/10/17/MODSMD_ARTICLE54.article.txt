BERKELEY, Oct. 16— (P.1.P.) —
Herman Eickmeyer, center of last
year's California freshman team which
defeated Stanford, will not appear in
the Bear varsity lineup this season.
Before the opening of the season it
was expected that Eickmeyer would
rate the varsity pivot position over
Riegels, present first-string center.
He suffered a broken jaw, however,
and was put on the hospital list in
definitely. He now has an infection
in his jaw that will keep him out the
rest of the season.
