# GOOD HOCKEY SEASON PREDICTED BY COACH; SENIOR TEAM STRONG
## 
### 
"Prospects for interclass hockey are
good so far," said Miss Marguerite
McGowen, hockey coach at Roble
Gymnasium. "This year a record num
ber of seniors have turned out, and
as this class won last year's champion
ship, they bid fair to carry off the
honors again this year.
"As far as can be predicted so far,
it looks as though the outcome of the
season will be a contest between the
juniors and seniors. Although the
sophomores have individual stars,
they have not developed the team
work of the other two classes."
This year will find several women
on the junior team who did not play
last year. Among these are Matie Mc-
Laren and Katherine Doyle. Not much
can be said of the freshmen yet.
Team captains are: Seniors, Caro
lyn Shepherd; juniors, Rose Taft;
sophomores, Marion Holley. A fresh
man captain will be elected later in
the season.
