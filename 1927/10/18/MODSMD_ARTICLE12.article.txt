# STIFF SCRIMMAGES, PRACTICE SCHEDULED BY DAVIS FOR GOOFS
## 
### 
With stiff scrimmages and practice
sessions scheduled for every night
this week, Coach Hal Davis is round
ing his Goof football eleven into shape
for the game Saturday with the St.
Mary's Grays.
Special attention is being given to
plays from punt formation and to
other points which need smoothing
out before the outfit gets into actual
competition. Davis is also working his
men 011 correct kick-off formations.
Driscoll, recently of the varsity
squad, has been showing up well at
guard. His playing has been promis
ing, and he should be a strong unit in
the forward wall against the Saints.
