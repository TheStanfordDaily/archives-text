# CHINA MUST SETTLE HER OWN PROBLEMS---JOHNSON

### Gunnar Norberg 
"About the only tiling that is cer
! tain about the Chinese situation is
! that it's uncertain," said Dr. Obed S.
j Johnson, when asked his opinion of
the present internal strife in China.
He is instructor in Chinese language
and culture, and a new member of the
faculty of the History department.
Seventeen years of his life have been
spent in educational work in the
Orient. Last December he returned to
! America after having visited in China
for a period of eight months.
"We, as outsiders, must allow China
to settle her own troubles; and, if
! she is given time, China will settle
i them, as she has in the past. China
i has a wonderful past," stated Dr.
j Johnson.
Foreigners Must Go
| "Foreign interests must go; imper
ialism must disappear .... before
China can become a unified nation."
"Which do you consider the most

critical aspect of Chinese difficulites
right now: political, economic, or so
cial?" Dr. Johnson was asked.
"1 think the political situation the
most important now.
"China has been known as a sleep
ing giant; that's only a half-truth at
j present. China still is a giant, but not
j asleep, rather quite wide-awake. China
has Ijeen shocked into wakefulness,
an ominous condition. The people of
China are conscious that China has
suffered great injustice in the years
that are past.
"The Chinese, that is the enlight
ened element, have a feeling that
China must throw off her foreign
yoke, seek release from her foreign
bondage."
Dr. Johnson has become aware of
great contrasts in the civil war in
China, also in its social and economic
activities.
"The present civil war in China,
broadly speaking and with proper
reservations, is a struggle of reaction,
conservatism; in the South is repre
sented the force and spirit of revolu
tion, revolution that aims for Chinese
national integrity.
"China may also be grouped into
several other categories: the East,
the West, and a major section not in
dicated by the compass; the Center.
"However, there is a feeling that
pervades all China, all its warring
factions: 'China for the Chinese.' This
feeling exists with especial fervor
among the student classes.
Old Regime Strong
"But there is in China also a group,
a small but powerful group that has
been filling its pockets with foreign
gold through all the years of foreign
domination, a group called the 'old
regime.' This faction is opposed to
the realization of an autonomous rule

| in China, by the Chinese, because it
i would mean killing the goose that laid
j the golden eggs.
"Whether the North or the South
| wins, one thing is certain: the day
of foreign dominance in China is fast
! disappearing. But we must be patient,
| we must wait; we are dealing with a
! civilization five thousand years old,
j a population of four hundred millions,
j and with habits that are milleniums
I old."
To make apparent the contrast be
tween the new and the old China, the
modern and the ancient, as it may be
seen at this late day, in any large
center of population in the "land of
the rising sun," Dr. Johnson spoke of
Canton.
Canton Ancient
"Canton, for example, a city two
thousand years old with two million
people; a city of small shops, little
men and women, who have for cen
turies carried their loads on bamboo
sticks. 'Look out for your backbone'
used to be the cry as the coolie passed
through the narrow streets with loads
| as wide as the streets almost. Canton
I still has some of these narrow thor
| oughfares.
112 "Now you will come out from one
of these small streets into a wide,
macademized boulevard, often a hun
dred and twenty feet wide. Here the
cry is 'look out for the market tiger,'
the market tiger being an auto bus,
such as the Pickwick stages you find
in California.

"About the only tiling that is cer

the present internal strife in China.

Foreigners Must Go

"Which do you consider the most

critical aspect of Chinese difficulites
right now: political, economic, or so

"1 think the political situation the
most important now.
"China has been known as a sleep
ing giant; that's only a half-truth at
j present. China still is a giant, but not
j asleep, rather quite wide-awake. China
has Ijeen shocked into wakefulness,
an ominous condition. The people of
China are conscious that China has
suffered great injustice in the years
that are past.
"The Chinese, that is the enlight
ened element, have a feeling that
China must throw off her foreign
yoke, seek release from her foreign
bondage."
Dr. Johnson has become aware of
great contrasts in the civil war in
China, also in its social and economic
activities.
"The present civil war in China,
broadly speaking and with proper
reservations, is a struggle of reaction,
conservatism; in the South is repre
sented the force and spirit of revolu
tion, revolution that aims for Chinese
national integrity.
"China may also be grouped into
several other categories: the East,
the West, and a major section not in
dicated by the compass; the Center.
"However, there is a feeling that
pervades all China, all its warring
factions: 'China for the Chinese.' This
feeling exists with especial fervor
among the student classes.
Old Regime Strong
"But there is in China also a group,
a small but powerful group that has
been filling its pockets with foreign
gold through all the years of foreign
domination, a group called the 'old

i would mean killing the goose that laid
