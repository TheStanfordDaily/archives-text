## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17â€” Colonel
Charles A. Lindbergh is opposed to
further transoceanic stunt flights at
the present stage of aviation develop
ment.
"The immediate future of aviation

in this country rests in development
of transcontinental airways rather
than furthering transoceanic air traf
fic," he said.
The strain of the nation-wide air
tour, which Lindbergh is conducting
for the Guggenheim Fund for the Pro
motion of Aviation, appears to be tell
ing on the young flyer. He seems to
have lost his tan.
