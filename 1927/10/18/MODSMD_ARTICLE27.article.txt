# CARD PRACTICE TO CENTER ON LINE STRENGTH
## Sellman Is Most Consistent Man Saturday; Shows In Last Quarter WILTON, HOFFMAN STAR Preston, Davidson, Vincenti, Muller Gain Strength; Passes Are Good .

Weakness in the Cardinal line,
one of the main causes of Saturday's
near disaster, must be given most of
Pop Warner's attention during the
coming week. Against almost any
team but 0.A.C., a strong backfield
defense could make up in part for a
weak line; the Webfooters, however,
have been concentrating their plays
on terrific bucks and smashes into
the line. A team that allowed as many
openings as did Stanford last week
would be a delightful dish for the
northern backg.
By far the outstanding man on the
Cardinal line for consistent playing
was Sellman. One of the twin blonde
tacklers, he started the game rather

Scheving of the Trojans and making
his presence known. He and Preston
were usually the first two Redshirts
to arrive on the spot after chasing a
punt down the field. But lie had his
big chance in the fourth quarter when
Hoffman sent a long pass into a mass
of players, of various assortments.
The ball bounced around the heads
of these men and finally landed in
Sellman's arms. Not having dreamed
of any such thing happening, he final
ly realized that he was eligible to
carry the ball, and started off to the
Cardinal's goal .He was too big and
bulky to dodge li is tacklers, and was
pulled down 011 his own thirty-yard
line.

Biff Hoffman, after merely filling a
position for a month, came into his
own against the Trojans and showed
spurts of great football. He was not
the sensational Fleishhacker, but he
was consistent, and the consistency
