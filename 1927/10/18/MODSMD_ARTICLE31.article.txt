Looking across the fields from the Daily office we see a bunch of
bouncing, black, ball-like somethings, each tipped with a crisp little patch
of white. These ball-like somethings are propelled by LIMBS —the limbs
of Stanford women. We thought at first a rehearsal was being staged
for an eighteenth-century bathing-girl act to go into the Dance Drama.
But we couldn't find any parasols or bathing caps, so we investigated
and were told this was a gymnasium class in action, and that these
voluminous black objects were all that could be seen of a campus woman
in her regulation gym suit.
We were also told that the costumes had been designed to incorporate,
besides the features of freedom and utility, a certain degree of modesty.
But this modesty business can be carried to a ludicrous extreme. We
laugh at the costumes women used to wear a quarter of a century ago 011
the bathing beaches, but to see modern young women cavorting about
in practically the same kind of clothes —well, draw your own conclu
sions ! Modesty doesn't come from the clothes a woman wears.
Aside from the comical aspect, however, we question even the physi
cal advantages of the present gym suit. To hold up the long black
stockings there must be some kind of apparatus, and such apparatus
usually is not beneficial to circulation. And how about all the bulky
pleatings and billowings that must be carried around—doesn't all this
material get in the way? And when women are playing basketball don't
long sleeves restrict movement?
We advocate that the women wear, in essence, the same sort of
athletic paraphernalia that the men wear. A lightweight jersey (and at
times a sweatshirt), a pair of duck shorts, a pair of sweatsocks, and a
pair of shoes. It is simplicity, not complexity, that is required.
It must be admitted that there are two very fine things about the
present trappings—they allow plenty of room, and make one judge the
feminine contestants 011 their ability alone.
