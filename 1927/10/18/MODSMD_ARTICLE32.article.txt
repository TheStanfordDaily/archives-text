We learn that after the U.S.C. game Saturday, some puerile residents
of Encina, with warped senses of humor, perched in various windows
of the dormitory and threw bags of water at the passing motor cars..
These motor cars contained not only Stanford students, but alumni,
U.S.C. rooters, and off-campus football enthusiasts. We can't blame any
of them who were the recipients of the watery deluge, or even saw the
proceedings, for forming a very derogatory opinion of Stanford students.
The University is judged by the conduct of its students, and usually
by the conduct of its weakest members, and we note with sorrow that
some of Stanford's latest additions fall in that class. It seems a pity that
a few of the underclassmen have not yet learned how to conduct them
selves as gentlemen. It's a quaint custom on this campus to do just that.
A repetition of such conduct lends strength to the arguments in favor
of eliminating the Lower Division.
It is hoped that the offending underclassmen will promptly get on
the boat.
