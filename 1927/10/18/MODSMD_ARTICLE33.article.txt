# Metropolis?

As "success" is a criterion of man in our modern world, so specializa
tion is increasing in its importance as a means of attaining this success.
Even in college this demand for specialization, so talked of in the
business world, the realm of arts, and the fields of science, is becoming
urgent.
Perhaps the last word in this machine-like mode of preparing the
student for a profession or other means of livelihood is that voiced by
President Charles E. Beury of Temple University, who regrets "to say
that the time has come when it is virtually impossible for the student
of medicine to divide his time between work and study, and successfully
attain his degree."
Such an announcement, applicable as well to study other than in the
school of medicine, would appear decidedly discouraging to students
seeking to "work their way" through college. Not only arc athletic
activities, social festivities, and other extra-curricular diversions shunted
into the discard, but even self-support is denied. And specialization's
demands arc doubly apparent as we sec the truth of Dr. IJcury's state
ment as applied to the modern college. The percentage of students work
ing their way through a law, business, or medical school is small indeed.
One wonders, with all this talk of concentration, singleness of pur
pose, and again, of specialization, if the work of the undergraduate, too,
is to shrink into narrowness with the casting off of traditions and extra
curricular activities, even though by slow degrees. Thoughts of a world
"metropolis" are dissatisfying; with our college life as a part of such
a world, especially so.
