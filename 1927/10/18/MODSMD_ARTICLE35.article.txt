# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps my criticisms may seem a
bit premature inasmuch as it is yet
early in the year, and the project
about which I am going to complain
is only just starting after a period of
reorganization. But, premature or not,
I believe a few words will not be out
of order, and certainly will do 110
harm.
The cause of my righteous indigna
tion is the so-called service received
at the University Postoffice. I feel
that it is a little unreasonable to ex
pect one to wait from five to fifteen
miutes to make the purchase of a
stamp simply because there is no one
at the window. The securing of two
cents' worth of postage is not usually
a life-and-death matter, I'll admit, but
at the same time ten or fifteen min
utes is quite a period when one is
hurrying to make a class.
The trouble does not seem to be
with the postal employees themselves
(for their treatment of patrons is al
ways courteous), but with the lack of
these said employees. The man at the
stamp window is constantly called

away to assist in other parts of the
office while would-be stamp purchas
ers cool their heels before the aper
ture, and are late to classes. The ser
vice wasn't perfect last year, but it
was superior to that given so far
under the new management.
