Questions may be mailed to the "In
formation Editor," left at the Daily
office, or phoned to the paper at PA
1074. They need not be signed, but
must concern University or student
affairs.

Question: "Is there any magazine
or periodical published by the student
body of the University, or any por
tion of its members, which forms an
expression of and presentation of the
short story?"
Answer by Margaret Olsen, editor
of the Stanford Literary Magazine:
Quite so.
The first number of the Lit for this
year will be out soon. Contributions
for subsequent issues are invited.
Question: "What departments or
activities emphasize the spiritual and
moral development of the students?"
Answer by "Information Editor":
The Memorial Church holds services
on Sunday and before morning classes.
There are twelve churches in Palo
Alto. The national Christian Associa
tions maintain secretaries on the cam
pus. There is a student Y.M.C.A. and
Y.W.C.A.
Many courses in philosophy are
given, including ethics.
The rituals of all fraternities and
sororities are most solemn and inspir
ing.
There are many uplifting books in
the library.
The sponsors at Encina act as
moral guides to the freshmen.
The Honor System is an all-perva
sive institution at Stanford.
The more strictly student activities,
such as writing for Chaparral, "queen
ing," Going to San Francisco, and
whatnot are more practical than spir
itual, but some remarkable effects in
the development of morality can thus
be obtained.
