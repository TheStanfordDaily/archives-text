# U.S. SEEKS TO FIND SOLUTION FOR TARIFF ATTITUDE OF FRANCE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. â€”Fearing
that unless the French tariff dispute
is settled before Congress meets there
will be embarrassing debate, the
United States is seeking a formula
which will be agreeable to France and
yet within the existing laws.
The latest French compromise pro
posal was found to carry one provi
sion that may prevent complete ac
ceptance by this Government. France \
offers to postpone her discriminatory !
tariff rates against American goods
but wants in, return assurances that j
the United States will lower certain |
tariff rates on imports from France |
and delay sanitary restrictions on |
French commodities, principally cer
tain medicines which contain nar
cotics.
Makes No Promises
The United States cannot make defi
nite promises as it is restricted by!
law but offers to investigate the rates |
complained of by France and to
change them if justified under the I
American law. This would have to be 1
done through the U.S. Tariff Commis
sion's recommendations to the Presi- j
dent under the flexible tariff provision..
France has made a concession in
offering to postpone application of her ,
decreased rates pending negotiations j
of a commercial treaty but whether
she will accept the necessarily indefi-1
nite promises of the United States re-!
garding tariff changes is uncertain.
