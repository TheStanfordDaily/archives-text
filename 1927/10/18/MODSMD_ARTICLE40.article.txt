### 
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. â€” The
threatened cyclonic disturbance in the
War Department, arising from Presi- i
dent Coolidge's recall of Major Gen
eral Charles A. Summerall, chief of
staff, from a West Coast speaking
tour, appears to have blown over.
Thirty-six hours after the General's
hurried return to Washington, ,he was
still waiting to be summoned before |
the President. At the White House it
was said no arrangements had been
made for a conference between Cool- j
idge and General Summerall and it
was intimated none would be made.
