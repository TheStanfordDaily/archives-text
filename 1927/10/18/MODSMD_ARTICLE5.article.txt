# MUZIO SONGS PLEASE WITH APPEALING, LYRIC BEAUTY
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Singing a program made up almost
entirely of appealing melodies, with
now and then a burst of dramatic fire
which has made her a foremost oper
atic star, Claudia Muzio last night
charmed the audience which heard
her open the Concert Series in the
Basketball Pavilion, and proved that
she is at least as much a lyric as a
dramatic soprano.
Mme. Muzio's marvelously pure
voice used with the intelligent re
straint that marked all her singing
proved itself capable of the gentlest
lullaby, the most torrential aria, and
everything that lay between. Her sing
ing is distinctly of the type which
grows upon the listener, so that the
first impression of effortless, mobile
vocalization and gracious personality
is heightened as each successive num
ber and encore, and thei'e are many,

reveals new aspects of her art.
The first group, of classical compo
sitions, was sung with quiet dignity
and charm.

Cesar Franck's "Nocturne" was one
of the most subtle and satisfying
songs of the evening.
In "Pace, Pace Mio Dio," the audj
ence had its first opportunity to hear
Mine. Muzio's handling of an operatic
aria. The spirit with which the singer
imbued each successive number was
nowhere better exemplified than in
the air of tragic grandeur with which
she rendered this outcry of the unfor
tunate heroine of Verdi's opera.
The last* number of the program,
the aria, "Mia Piccirella," was equally
brilliant. Two and three encores were
given after each number.
