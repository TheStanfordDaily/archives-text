### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Everything must have a beginning |
and an end, but there is no end to the i
discussion as to who are the two i
greatest ends in gridiron history. It is j
generally admitted that Frank Hinkey, j
that "Big Little Man" of Yale from I
1891 to 1894 inclusive, was the best at !
(he wing position that the game ever j
knew. Hinkey was one of Yale's great-!
est. heroes, yet was hated and abused
by other colleges and the press, prob-1
ably because they never understood
him. Frank never weighed much more
than 140 pounds, yet his muscles were
bands of steel, and his unconquerable i
spirit was like that of a fanatic. "The
Tonawanda Terror," as he was called,
made Walter Camp's All-Anierican
team four years in succession, and it
was said that no opponent ever gained
an inch around Franky Hinkey's end.
Old Eli gave another great end to
history in Tom Shevlin (1902-1905), i
who frankly admitted that he was the
greatest end who ever lived. Tom,
who was 190 pounds of bone and
muscle, and as fleet as a deer, re
ceived quite a rude shock when he
once asked the late Mike Murphy,
Yale trainer, "If Hinkey wasn't as
big as I, nor as strong as I, nor as
fast as I, was he a better football
player than I?", and Mike replied,
"Tom, Frank Hinkey made you look 1
like the change from a counterfeit
nickel!" Shevlin was great, but he
wasn't the end genius that Hinkey
was, in spite of his superior physical
qualifications.
Ranking almost on a par with
Hinkey were "Tacks" Hardwick, of
Harvard, and "Brick" Muller, of Cali
fornia. Either one would make a fine
mate for Hinkey on any all-time all
star team. Muller was one of the
greatest passers the game ever knew,

while Hardwick was known as the
greatest interferes
Paul Robson, the giant Rutgers
negro, now an actor, and Bert Baston,
of Minnesota, a remarkable forward
pass receiver, make another pair of
ends that would delight the heart of
any coach. Robeson was an All-Ameri
can end in 1918; Baston, in 1915 and
1916; Hardwick, in 1914:

pass receiver, make another pair of
ends that would delight the heart of
any coach. Robeson was an All-Ameri

1916; Hardwick, in 1914:


Four Famous Ends
Everything must have a beginning |
and an end, but there is no end to the i
discussion as to who are the two i
greatest ends in gridiron history. It is j
generally admitted that Frank Hinkey, j
that "Big Little Man" of Yale from I
1891 to 1894 inclusive, was the best at !
(he wing position that the game ever j
knew. Hinkey was one of Yale's great-!
est. heroes, yet was hated and abused
by other colleges and the press, prob-1
ably because they never understood
him. Frank never weighed much more
than 140 pounds, yet his muscles were
bands of steel, and his unconquerable i
spirit was like that of a fanatic. "The
Tonawanda Terror," as he was called,
made Walter Camp's All-Anierican
team four years in succession, and it
was said that no opponent ever gained
an inch around Franky Hinkey's end.
Old Eli gave another great end to
history in Tom Shevlin (1902-1905), i
who frankly admitted that he was the
greatest end who ever lived. Tom,
who was 190 pounds of bone and
muscle, and as fleet as a deer, re
ceived quite a rude shock when he
once asked the late Mike Murphy,
Yale trainer, "If Hinkey wasn't as
big as I, nor as strong as I, nor as
fast as I, was he a better football
player than I?", and Mike replied,
"Tom, Frank Hinkey made you look 1
like the change from a counterfeit
nickel!" Shevlin was great, but he
wasn't the end genius that Hinkey
was, in spite of his superior physical
qualifications.
Ranking almost on a par with
Hinkey were "Tacks" Hardwick, of
Harvard, and "Brick" Muller, of Cali
fornia. Either one would make a fine
mate for Hinkey on any all-time all
star team. Muller was one of the
greatest passers the game ever knew,

while Hardwick was known as the
greatest interferes
Paul Robson, the giant Rutgers
negro, now an actor, and Bert Baston,
of Minnesota, a remarkable forward
pass receiver, make another pair of
ends that would delight the heart of
any coach. Robeson was an All-Ameri
