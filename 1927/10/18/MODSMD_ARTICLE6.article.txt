# YEARLING SWIMMERS EXPECTED TO SHOW POWERFUL LINE-UP
## Burns, Desjardins Foremost Men in Breaststroke, Diving Berths 
### 
That Stanford's freshman swimming
squad will be one of the strongest in
history this year was the belief ex
pressed yesterday by Coach Brand
sten who is already lining up his men
for regular practices.
Desjardins, for three years national
diving champion, is the best known of
the prospective yearling mermen, but
he is by no means the only potential
star.
Burns, from Santa Cruz, exceptional
in the breast stroke, according to
Brandsten, is already in a class with
the best varsity men in that event. He
is also a diver of 110 mean ability.
In the distances Brandsten is count
ing on Moffit, Scott, Morrow, and
Dake. Promising 50- and 100-yard dash
men are Lucy, Brown, and Tanzer.
Smith, of Palo Alto High School,
looks good in the backstroke.
Coach Brandsten believes that there
may be still likely swimmers among
the 1931 men whom he has not yet
uncovered, and he urges that those
with aquatic aspirations turn out for
a berth on the squad.
