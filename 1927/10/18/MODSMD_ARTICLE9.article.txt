# SWORD AND SANDALS DRAMA PROGRESSES; MISS PRICE PLEASED
## 
### 
Work on the Sword and Sandals j
play, "The Lady of the Rose," is going j
ahead steadily. The character of the j
play demands particularly skillful !
treatment and work on the part of the I
whole cast, but, according to Anna
: May Price, work is progressing even
better than could be expected in view
of the short time rehearsals have been
going on.
"The Lady of the Rose" is a type !
of work that contrasts strongly with |
i the dramatic productions 011 the cam- |
! pus in the last two years. Contrary to ,
| the inference of the title, the play is '
i almost entirely masculine, laying em-!
I phasis on the character of the men
j rather than of the women.
Although several traditional heroes j
j appear, they are treated in an original
i way, and at 110 time descend to the ]
j hackneyed form. The part of Lubin,
I the Jewish producer, played by Alfred
Hurt, will be an exceptionally interest
; ing one to watch. In last year's Junior
i Opera, "Wicked William," Hurt played
the role of Buchowitz, a pseudo-Rus
] sian movie director. The role of Lubin
|is entirely the other extreme. The
, play is an ambitious effort for a cam- â€¢
, pus production, and is the first under
Miss Price's direction.
