# THOMAS DESCRIBES MEXICO AS LAND OF GREAT RESOURCES
## WEST RICH, UNOPENED Education, Vast Credit, New Blood Are Three Vital Needsâ€”Thomas

"Mexico is the land of romance, of
chivalry, and of unbounded wealth:
it is also the land of ignorance, pov
erty, and cruelty," declared Dr. C. N.
Thomas in his lecture last night in
the Little Theatre. Dr. Thomas was
formerly Colonizing and Industrial
Agent for the Southern Pacific Kail
road Company for Mexico, and in this
capacity became widely acquainted
with conditions there.
The section along the west coast,
fronting the Gulf of Mexico, with
which Dr. Thomas was particularly
acquainted, he described as "possibly
the richest, and least developed area
in the world." He advised his audi
ence that this is the United States'
big opportunity, and California's in
particular. "Mexico is now where Cali
fornia was 75 years ago. It is up to
us to pour our civilization into it and
remould it with our resources during
this formative period.
"The typical American thinks the
Mexican is stupid. He isn't: he's dif
ferent," said Dm, Thomts. "He lacks
leadership, and the capacity of the
Anglo-Saxon to lift himself. He does
have great talent along certain lines,
such as his great capacity to do things
with his hands. He makes beautiful
and intricate jewelry as an example.
All Mexicans have an innate love for
the beautiful, and they have also an
amazing capacity for music.
"Mexico needs three things," con
tinued Dr. Thomas, in presenting the
economic side of the Mexican prob
lem. "She is rich in resources, and
poor as a government and as a peo
ple. She needs vast credit for develop
ing these resources; she needs an in
fusion of the right kind of new blood
in the form of desirable immigrants;
and she needs education.
The foreign influence is a profound
one, according to Dr. Thomas. Ger
mans are by far the most popular,
both here and in Spanish America, he
says, because of their intellectual
type and sincere interest. Most of
them speak Spanish, and are received
into the best families.
