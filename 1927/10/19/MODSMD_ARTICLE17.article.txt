## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18—The first
definite issue has cropped up out of
the foggy intricacies of the Fall-Sin
clair Teapot Dome conspiracy trial.
This question is whether Fall had
sufficient evident that outside drillers
were draining the Navy's oil out of
the Teapot reserve to justify the mak
ing of the lease with Sinclair.
In his opening statement to the
jury, Martin M. Littleton, speaking for
the defense, declared that the Navy's
oil was being drained out of the re
serve and that the secrecy empha
sized as a sinister factor by the prose
cution was the result of secret plans
made by the Navy for national de
fense.
It was apparent from his opening
statement, which is not yet complete,
that the defense will justify the Tea
pot Dome lease on the patriotic
ground that it was up to Fall to save
the Navy's oil from being drained
away and that this action was taken
with the full knowledge and approval
of the Navy heads.
