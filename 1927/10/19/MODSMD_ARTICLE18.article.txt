# INTERCLASS TEAMS IN CONDITION TO START FOOTBALL OCTOBER 29
## Sophomores Are Exception; Need Weighty Linemen For Forward Wall 
### 
Interclass football teams this week
have been developing their plays in
scrimmage against the goofs and
other class teams. With the exception
of the sophomores, all teams are in a
fair way to open their season on Octo
ber 29. 1930, coached by Charles
Davis, needs several beefy linemen to
strengthen their forward wall. It is
hoped that a number of men will turn
out for practice which will last about
three weeks longer.
The seniors are well organized with
an experienced team that averages
o.round 1(55 pounds. 11, C, Brown scrim
maged them against tiie team
last week with great success.
Juniors Play Together
The JOnloi's will furnish the big
game with the seniors as they have
a team that has J)layed together since
their freshman year. Fox, Winters,
Parker, and Skeldon have shown up
well, says Willie Wolfe, Who is coach
ing them. They have been Working
out every night against the goofs and
last night took a lay-off from scrim
mage.
"The sophs are few in number and
are liable to get beaten by the frosh
if they don't watch out," said Coach
Charles Davis during practice. "If
men who have no gym at 4 o'clock
would come out it would help the
team a great deal, as the turnout has
not been big enough because so many
sophomores are on the goof team."
Freshman Team Light
The freshmen have the lightest
team of the bunch but are well organ
ized and have developed their plays
so that they are ready for hard work.
Henry, at full, has turned out to be
a triple-threat man for the yearlings
who are expecting to clean up on the
weak sophomores.
