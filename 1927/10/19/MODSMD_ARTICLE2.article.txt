## 
### 
"Our new object for this year is
that of building a house on the cam
pus for tired, half-sick, and conva
lescent students," stated Mrs. Edwin j
Thomas, president of the Stanford j
Mothers' Club, at their meeting yes- j
terday afternoon in the Clubhouse.
"Providing scholarships to enable j
students to attend the University will j
remain one of our most important
works, but we should also concern
ourselves with caring for the students
already here."
Mrs. Thomas introduced Dean Yost, !
the principal speaker "of the afternoon,
as "the nearest to the mother of this
University."
"You can't separate the interests of
men and women in this University,
nor anywhere else in the world," said i
Dean Yost, in outlining the student
body organization.
"My job here is to look after the
women's interests especially. I have
no authority in Women's Council, but
the girls talk things over with me to
get an older person's point of view.
The deans here are advisory and not
disciplinary, as they are in most uni
versities." Dean Yost quoted a defini
tion of the popular idea of deans and
presidents; "Deans are the ones who
■deal with the prodigals; presidents
are those who deal with the indignant
righteous."
"The women here have a strong
representative government and are
doing a fine work. They are facing
every day problems that they will
meet later in the community, and they
are meeting them efficiently," con-!
eluded Dean Yost.
