# VARSITY DEPARTS TOMORROW TO PLAY O.A.C. AT PORTLAND
## New Combinations Tried in Practice to Choose Men For Northern Trip HILL, MURPHY ON BENCH Coach Schissler Possesses Powerful Backfield, Reserve Strength 
### Milton Silverman 
With Stanford's departure for Port
1a 11 set definitely at 3 o'clock Thurs
day afternoon, yesterday's practice
was partly to determine who shall
compose tiie thirty men to leave on
the Southern Pacific's Cascade. New
backfield and new line combinations
were tried, and many of the regular
players, found themselves watching
scrimmage from the sidelines.
Hoffman was still fullback on the
first string, with Lewis barftlug the
signals, but Wilton and Hill were
missing. In their places Pop put Ernio
Patchett and Lud Frentrup.
Wilton on Second Squad
Wilton, changed from the first
string, was playing ha!? fin the second
with Dick Hyland. Fleishhacker was
holding onto his fullback berth, while
Mike Murphy was replaced by
Heineke, who in turn, had his center
position filled by Vermilya. A1 Cook
was playing first string center instead
of McCreery.
At Corvallis Coach Schissler has
begun to polish up his team after the
injuries it suffered in the past sev
eral games. Since the Orangemen
loafed last Saturday, almost every
man is free from fractures and
bruises.
Avrit Triple-Threat Man
Schissler has been using Les Avrit,
a dangerous triple-threat man, at full
back. Although he is a fine defense
player, and a real fighter, he scarcely
fills the place of the great Wes "Iron
Man" Schulmerich. Howard Maple, a
real ball-carrying quarter, is the
Orange's best bet for signal-caller.
Specializing in long runs through open
fields, he broke into fame as a hero
last year when he made a touchdown
after running 75 yards through the
whole California team.
Dave Luby and Melvin "VVhitlock
are slated to do most of the offense
work against the Cardinals. Luby, aa
field captain in the 0.A.C.-U.S.C.
game, played remarkable football un
til he was carried from the field.
Whitlock, another of these triple
threat men, is supposedly better than
Luby, but so far has yet to prove him
self. He is an all-around athlete, com
peting in almost every sport, and do
ing most of the punting work in foot
ball.
O.A.C. Uses Line Shift
The Orangemen use a tricky line
shift with a backfield hop, all mixed
in with plenty of the famous "poosh
'em up," as the Trojans can well tes
tify. With all the men they need to
do the end runs and off-tackle bucks,
the Northerners insist on pulverizing
through center and guard. McCreery,
Robesky, and Post will have plenty
of occupation on their hands to stop
Avrit and his gang.
Substitute strength, one of the big
features of the Cards this year, is no
better than that of the Orangemen.
Besides three or four complete addi
tional lines, at quarter is Montgom
ery, a fast, noisy gentleman. Scott,
Owen, and Metten are slightly in
ferior to the regulars, but have enough
power to promise them a swipe at
Stanford. Carl Gilmore, subbing for
Avrit, is a fullback on the type of
sure-gain Herbie Fleishhacker.
