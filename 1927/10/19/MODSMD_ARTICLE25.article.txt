# "COURTESY PREFERRED"
## 
### 
Because of the number of complaints received from chaperones con
cerning their discourteous treatment at campus dances, the Executive
Committee has been forced to take action to remedy the situation.
Last night a committee of three was appointed by Murray Draper to
interview Dean Yost with the idea of securing from her suggestions as to
a general set of requirements for future treatment of chaperones at social
functions on the campus. When these requirements have been determined,
notices thereof will be sent to each living group and other organizations
on the campus carrying on any social functions. The Executive Com
mittee then intends to enforce its right to refuse to grant a second date
to any organization disregarding these rules.
The chaperones complain that the only attention they now receive at
campus dances is a box of candy thrown at them, and recognition from
about six young people who deign to notice their presence.
As a result, it is becoming a problem to secure chaperones. Their de
mands are really quite simple. All they want is to be recognized and con
versed with amicably, and not to be mistaken for furniture.
Such a situation on the campus is deplorable. "The family" would
doubtless be scandalized to learn that Executive Committee action is
needed to force their offspring to observe the common courtesies in which
they have been drilled since childhood.
If we all behave in a courteous manner at social functions at home
(which point is taken for granted), we should not allow our manners to
go to seed while in college. It reflects on us, and we are the ones who
suffer. Courtesy may not be one of the five cardinal virtues, but it's a
close sixth.
