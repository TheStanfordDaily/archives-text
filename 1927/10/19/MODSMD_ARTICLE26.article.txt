Because of a ruling of Pan-Hellenic, a very artificial situation now
exists on the campus between sisters in cases where one lives on the Row
and the other as a freshman in the Hall.
Sisters in the above category cannot ride together in the same machine
on the campus. One sister cannot visit the other in her room at the Hall.
They are permitted to see each other only on Quad or at the library or in
the lobby of Roble Hall. Other meetings are banned unless authorized
each time by Pan-Hellenic. This certainly is a blow to sisterly affectoin.
Even in this emancipated twentieth century, the old tradition of
friendliness with members of one's family still persists.
In addition to the filial aspect, there is another angle. Such prohibi
tions work an inconvenience when one car is shared by two sisters, which
is usually the case. Under the Pan-Hellenic ruling, only one sister can
ride home from the Library, or the classroom, in comfort; the other must
trudge home with a heavy load of books under her arm.
Isn't this a case of straining at gnats?
