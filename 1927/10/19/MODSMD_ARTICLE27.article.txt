# GONE—WE HOPE NOT FORGOTTEN

Traditions don't seem to be the only things which are fast disappear
ing from the campus. The latest accessory to go is the red danger signal
formerly located at the bend in the road just past the end of the bridge
over San Francisquito Creek, as it enters the campus grounds.
Perhaps we don't need some of the more cumbersome traditions, but
that signal was of real service. The sharp turn in the road, looming up
suddenly, is a trap to the unwary motorist, especially one who is not
familiar with the highway. If he should be unable to twist his wheel
quickly enough—over the fence is out.
We make a plea for the reinstatement of this valuable signal.
