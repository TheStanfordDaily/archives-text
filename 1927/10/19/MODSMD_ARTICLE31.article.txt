## HARDER'S PLUCK 
### 
One has to hand it to Spud Harder
for pluck. Three doctors attending
him when he was in the hospital with
a broken jaw insisted that he would
be unable to play again this season.
Undaunted, Harder secured the con
sent of three other medicos to allow
him to return to the lineup. Now, with
professional authority divided, Spud
is having an iron brace made to pro
tect his face when he does get into
the game again.
