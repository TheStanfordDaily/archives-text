Now that everyone's heart has had
a chance to recuperate from the strain
of last Saturday, it is high time to
point out that the coming fracas with
the Oregon Aggies on the Portland
turf will be an affair demanding self
fortification with smelling salts or
other stimulants for the one who lis
tens in over the radio. It is well
known to all that the Lumberjacks
lost by a single point to the Thunder
ing Herd in a tough game. Compara
tive dope makes the victory either
team's, and only Stanford's confidence
in Pop Warner's obstinacy and well
proved prejudice against losing an
important game leads one to look for
a Cardinal win.
