# COME, PRAISE THE BAND

A Stanford supporter cannot but
take pride in the excellent display
made by the Cardinal band at the
U.S.C. game. The ninety-six men exe
cuted their drills faultlessly, and the
manner in which the band introduced
again the new "Stanford Forever"
song was a credit to Professor E.
Whitney Martin, leader, and Drum
Major Willits. It would now be ideal
if the student body would take the
trouble to learn the words of this
catchy air, which promises to be one
of the Cardinal favorites.
In the interests of a conservatism
fast dying out, it was satisfactory to
note that the band had not slipped a
surprise and appeared in smocks,
blazers, or (perish the thought!)
bloomers when it showed up on the
field, but instead adhered for another
year to the style of uniform that
caused such alarm at Lexington and
Concord. —Templeton Peck.
