The Editor, Sir:
—and Don ended liis Bull Session
discussion of the new moving picture
course being offered at U.S.C. with a
"little sigh of thanks that Stanford
is far enough from the Los Angeles
and Hollywood Chambers of Com
merce that we do not have to sponsor
Movies and Higher Education into a
fadeout clinch —and keep a straight
face about it."
