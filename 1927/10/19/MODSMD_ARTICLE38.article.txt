And you should have seen all the
skull practice and the dummies they
liad out on the field yesterday. I was
never so impressed with football be
fore.
All the men seemed to be working
hard most of the time, and I know it
must make them tired because there
aren't any people for them to get in
spiration from. But I wish they would
n't play so hard and furiously, I mean
I think they should try to save their
energy and their best plays for a
real game.
It was perfectly wonderful, though,
how the second team just wouldn't let
the first team gain any yards. Why it
almost seemed as if some one had
told them beforehand just what the
play was going to be.
There was one man out there in a
gray sweater who seemed to be giving
all the orders, and he really had a
wonderfully nice voice. I think that
every one should pay special atten
tion to the way that some of the men
ran. Their knees went way up in front
and their feet way out in back. If
they're not careful, someone is going
to be hurt by getting kicked that way.
There was an immense number of
men on the field. And even assistant

managers and our yell-leader were
there practicing, I mean with the foot
ball. And I have a hunch that some
day a ball is going to be passed to
Ihe red-haired one, and he'll probably
save the game, because after all, he is
higher up and can see everything that
is going on.
And then when it got darker, they
turned oil the prettiest spot lights for
the men to play in. It really was
awfully effective.
