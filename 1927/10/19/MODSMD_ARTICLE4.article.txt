# BABE GRID MEN WILL LEAVE FOR SOUTH TO PLAY S.C. FRESHMEN
## Card Squad in Good Shape; May Defeat Trojans On Saturday 
### Bob Speers 
Twenty-two freshman football play
ers with Coaches Hunt, Dietz, and
Mitchell, will board the Lark tomor
row evening for Los Angeles where
they will the yearling team of
the University of Southern California
in the Coliseum Saturday.
Barring possible accidents in prac
tice between then and now, the Babes
will be practically unhampered by in
jury or illness. They came through
last Saturday's battle with the Saints
in good shape, and are ready for ac
tion again.
May Defeat Trojans
That game last week rather estab
lished a reputation for Hunt's charges,
by the way. Since then their stock
has risen to a point where even pessi
mistic critics are giving them a chance
to bowl over the young Trojans and
later the 1931 Bears.
Just what will happen Saturday is
problematical, and will remain so until
the game is over, simply because
there is no possible way of compar
ing the two teams. The U.S.C. fresh
men are always a dangerous outfit,
and it is not likely that this gang will
be any exception.
Cards Play Well
The Cardinal youngsters played a
high calibre of football last week. The
line, formerly a doubtful factor, was
strong with Heiser and Bogue and
BigloWe smashing plays consistently.
The backs performed smoothly and
effectively. If this work is repeated
against the Southern Californians, it
is certain that Stanford's freshmen
will put up a real battle.
