# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
One of the most interesting phases
of the 1927 Western Conference foot
ball season will be the success —or
failure—of Coach Glenn Thistleth
waite at Wisconsin University and
Coach Dick Hanley at Northwestern, j
Both moved to their new positions |
after very successful seasons, and
each, it is presumed, considered that |
he was bettering himself by making j
the change. The fact that Dick stepped j
into Glenn's shoes at Evanston while i
Glenn moved on to Madison makes
the situation all the more interesting.
Why did Wisconsin want Thistleth
waite? Because, in a brief space of
time he had lifted the football affairs j
of the college on the shores of Lake ;
Michigan from the slough of despon- \
dency to a tie with Michigan for first
place in the 1926 Big Ten race. Only
Notre Dame, a non-conference school, j
was able to defeat the Purple last fall, J
and then only in the final minutes of ;
play. Chicago was beaten for the first
time in ten years, and six other games |
were won by very comfortable mar- j
gins. As former Coach Little wanted
to devote his time to the job of ath
letic director, it is easy to see why
Wisconsin wanted Glenn Thisleth
waite.

Now, then, why did Northwestern
want Dick Hanley? Because he had
proved his ability as a coach by the
fine record of the Haskell Indian
team, of which he has been the "Big
Medicine Man" the past five years.
Last season, in thirteen games played,
from Boston to San Francisco, the
Indians were not beaten, and only held
even once, scoring 558 points to their
opponents' 49. Young Hanley is a sort
of a grandson of the Warner school
of coaching, as he was a pupil of
"Lone Star" Dietz at Washington
State, and Dietz in turn, was coached
by Pop Warner at Carlisle.
As far as prospects go, Hanley has
inherited the better material, yet
Northwestern has the weaker sched
ule. "Moon" Baker and Johnson, the
giant tackle, have gone, but Capt. Yic
Gustafson, "Tiny" Lewis, and about a
dozen other lettermen are back at
Evanston. At Madison, the prospects
are also good, as the sophomore backs
who beat lowa and Chicago should go
on to even greater deeds.
Glenn Thislethwaite went to Earl
ham College, and graduated iflto the
Big Ten as coach from Oak Park High
School, where he was quite successful
in developing star players.

Indians were not beaten, and only held
even once, scoring 558 points to their
opponents' 49. Young Hanley is a sort
of a grandson of the Warner school
of coaching, as he was a pupil of
"Lone Star" Dietz at Washington
State, and Dietz in turn, was coached
by Pop Warner at Carlisle.
As far as prospects go, Hanley has
inherited the better material, yet
Northwestern has the weaker sched
ule. "Moon" Baker and Johnson, the
giant tackle, have gone, but Capt. Yic
Gustafson, "Tiny" Lewis, and about a
dozen other lettermen are back at
Evanston. At Madison, the prospects
are also good, as the sophomore backs
who beat lowa and Chicago should go
on to even greater deeds.
Glenn Thislethwaite went to Earl
ham College, and graduated iflto the
Big Ten as coach from Oak Park High
School, where he was quite successful
in developing star players.


Two Big fen Coaches
One of the most interesting phases
of the 1927 Western Conference foot
ball season will be the success —or
failure—of Coach Glenn Thistleth
waite at Wisconsin University and
Coach Dick Hanley at Northwestern, j
Both moved to their new positions |
after very successful seasons, and
each, it is presumed, considered that |
he was bettering himself by making j
the change. The fact that Dick stepped j
into Glenn's shoes at Evanston while i
Glenn moved on to Madison makes
the situation all the more interesting.
Why did Wisconsin want Thistleth
waite? Because, in a brief space of
time he had lifted the football affairs j
of the college on the shores of Lake ;
Michigan from the slough of despon- \
dency to a tie with Michigan for first
place in the 1926 Big Ten race. Only
Notre Dame, a non-conference school, j
was able to defeat the Purple last fall, J
and then only in the final minutes of ;
play. Chicago was beaten for the first
time in ten years, and six other games |
were won by very comfortable mar- j
gins. As former Coach Little wanted
to devote his time to the job of ath
letic director, it is easy to see why
Wisconsin wanted Glenn Thisleth
waite.

Now, then, why did Northwestern
want Dick Hanley? Because he had
proved his ability as a coach by the
fine record of the Haskell Indian
team, of which he has been the "Big
Medicine Man" the past five years.
Last season, in thirteen games played,
from Boston to San Francisco, the
Indians were not beaten, and only held
even once, scoring 558 points to their
opponents' 49. Young Hanley is a sort
