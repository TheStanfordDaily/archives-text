# KILER TO PRODUCE MANY RICH SCENES FOR LADY OF ROSE
## SWIFT CHANGES NEEDED Strong Contrasts Between Brilliance, Darkness Of Different Sets 
### 
Richness without ostentation will
characterize the sets planned by Les
Kiler, technical director, for "The
Lady of the Rose." They will be car
ried out in a formal Elizabethan type,
with the emphasis upon creating one
focal point in each set, rather than
scattering the effect.
The play calls for very tricky light
effects, demanding several fade-outs
and swift transition of scenes. One
particularly interesting change is the
change in the first act from the real
study of John Meredith's home, to the
reproduction of it that has been made
at Lubin, the producer's, theatre.
The second act in the dining room
of Meredith's home, will feature an
enormous window with stained glass
which contrasts in brilliance with the
sombreness of the first and last act,
The dining room set, though similar
in some ways to that of "The Swan,"
produced last year, will be done in a
more subtle manner.
New draperies have been secured
for use in the second act. A new and
original effect in dramatic sets may
be expected.
The ticket sale will begin Thursday,
contrary to the old policy of placing
student tickets for disposal two days I
before. There will be a pre-sale at
Roble Hall, at 12:30, preceding the
Quad sale at 1 o'clock. Tickets will
be obtainable at Crandall's Book
Store, in Palo Alto, after Thursday.
