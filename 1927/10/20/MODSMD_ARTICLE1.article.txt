# EX COMMITTEE WILL CONTROL FUTURE PYRES
## Freshmen Will Do Actual Labor of Putting Up Big Game Fire CONSTRUCTION SPURRED Definite Specifications Set for Size of Piles to Be Built in Future 
### 
Starting with the 1931 bonfire this
November, Big Game bonfires will in
the future be under the supervision
of the Rally Committee instead of
freshmen, as a result of action by the
Rally Committee on the proposal made
Tuesday night by the Ex Committee
to that effect. A freshman committee
will still have charge of the actual
construction, but will be subject to
instructions from the rally officials.
Matters of discipline concerning the
bonfire will be in the hands of the
Men's Council, Encina sponsors, and
the Ex Committee.
The aims of these changes are espe
cially to shorten the time required to
build the bonfire, and to minimize
wasted effort on the part of freshmen.
Faculty members felt that the usual
three weeks required to construct the
pyre i? more time than the freshmen
can afford to spare during their first
quarter.
To aid in shortening the construc
tion period, a specific size is to be
determined on by the Rally Commit
tee for all future bonfires. This will
do away with the attempt of each
succeeding class to build the biggest
fire.
