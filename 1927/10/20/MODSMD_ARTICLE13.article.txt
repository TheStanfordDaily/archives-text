# PROFESSOR GUEST IS AUTHOR OF BOOR ON PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
## 
### 
Harold W. Guest, lecturer in eco
nomics at Stanford two years ago, and
now professor of economics at Baker
University, has written a book entitled
"Public Expenditures" which has been
published recently by G. P. Putnam's
Sons, New York.
Factors that control the size of gov
ernment disbursements, and a discussion
of mob psychology are the two principal
subjects about which Professor Guest
discusses at length. In connection with
the latter subject, the education of the
voter to develop a social consciousness
is considered.
