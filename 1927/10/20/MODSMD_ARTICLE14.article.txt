Playing fast, hard football, Coach
Hal Davis' Goof contingent ran circles
around the second varsity last night
in an exciting practice scrimmage
preparatory to the Gray-St. Mary's
clash Saturday.
The varsity outfit seemed totally
unable to stop the end runs and line
bucks of the opposing backs, Taylor,
May, Goodcell, and Lewis, who slipped
across three touchdowns in short
order.
On the other hand, Warner's
charges failed to display much punch
when they were given the ball. The
Gray linemen consistently broke
through the opposition's forward wall,
nailing the runners before they start
ed. It was not until late in the eve
ning that Fleishhacker and Ilyland
began to show their stuff, and tear
off some respectable gains.
One fact is established beyond a
doubt —that St. Mary's reserve outfit
will have to possess a number of coal
heaver linesmen and some classy
backs to squelch Davis' boys.
Besides the men already mentioned
Davis has two strong backfield play
ers in Cohen and McCone who showed
up particularly well defensively. The
line, too, displayed lots of strength
with Driscoll, Fetzer, and Dietrich
opening holes and stopping plays con
sistently.
