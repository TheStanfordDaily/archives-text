# TEMPLETON PRINCIPAL SPEAKER AT SMOKER HELD BY TOYON CLUB
## 
### 
"We have a football team to be
proud of this year, coached by Pop
Warner, who is head and shoulders
above other football coaches," de
clared Dink Templeton, varsity track
cocah, in a short talk before the fresh
men and the members of Toyon Hall
at the Toyon smoker last evening.
"Warner has a system that never
works well at the beginning of the
season. At the start of the season he
gives his team all the plays which it
will use during the whole football
period; and, although it is rather diffi
cult for the team to get onto his in
tricate plays at first, by the time the
Big Game rolls around the Stanford
squad has reached its peak and is able
to perform to the best of its ability.
Since the smoker was being given
for freshmen, he spoke of Encina Hall
and how changed it is now. "In those
days," Templeton remarked, "Encina
was a real club, and once in it a stu
dent couldn't get out until he had
graduated. Everyone knew everyone
else, and the freshmen didn't look
sideways at the upperclassmen with
out going in the water troughs.
John Truman gave recitations be
fore and after Templeton's talk, and
music was furnished by Howard Gab
bert and Sam Poepoe. Alexander Ross
was chairman of the evening.
