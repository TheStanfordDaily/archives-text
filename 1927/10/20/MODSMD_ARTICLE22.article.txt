# COMPLETE PLANS FOR ORGANIZING FRESHMEN IN DIVISION GROUPS
## First-Year Women to Divide In Small Sections at Y.W.C.A. Meeting 
### 
Definite plans for the formation of
Freshman Discussion Groups, spon
sored by the Stanford Y.W.C.A., were
completed at a meeting of Misses
Harriet Cogswell, Winifred Hunting
ton, Sally Kinsman, and Benetta Mer
ner held Thursday.
Freshman women will be given an
opportunity to sign up in groups of
about ten each at an open meeting
of the Y.W.C.A. Tuesday, October 25,
in the Women's Clubhouse. Group
leaders will be chosen chiefly from
members of sophomore and senior
cabinets. There will be at least two
leaders to each group, and these will
change about among the groups, in
order that the new women will have
an opportunity to come in contact
with different personalities within the
year.
At least one group is planned to
accommodate upperclass transfer stu
dents.
Anna Fitzhugh, '25, will sponsor the
groups as a representative of the Ad
visory Board. Miss Fitzhugh was for
merly private secretary to Mrs. Her
bert Hoover.
