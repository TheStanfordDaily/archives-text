### Milton Silverman 
Thirty men, comprising the entire
first two teams and part of the third,
were selected yesterday by Pop War
ner to go north on the Cascade this
afternoon. These players, witli the
coaching staff and (he managers, will
arrive in Portland early tomorrow
afternoon, with plenty of time to take
out any stiffness before the O.A.C,
game Saturday.
Iwo elevens, more or less reno
vated .will probably see most of the
action on the northern sawdust field,
and if rain interferes, several other
Cardinals will have an opportunity to
sample the mixture of mud, water,
and shavings. .On the first string, the
same that started against the Tro
jans, will be Captain McCreery at
center; Robesky and Post, guards;
Sellman and Freeman, tackles; and
Preston and Davidson, ends. In the
backfield will be Hoffman at full,
Lewis at quarter, and Wilton and Hill
at half.
Look Dangerous
Patchett and Hyland hold down the
halfback posts on the second team,
with Fleishhaeker at full and Heineke
quarter. Cook, a hurtling piece of
trouble that is extremely dangerous
when kicked on the nose, takes
Heineke's place at center. Around him
will be Kazanjian and Macabee,
guards; Smalling, former fullback,
and Everett, tackles; and Muller and
Vincenti, end®.
In the scrimmage against the Goofs
yesterday, Vincenti was watching
from the sidelines, while Montgomery
filled his place.. Kanzanjian, however,
disturbed Hal Davis' charges more
than anyone else, for he insisted on
smearing up most of the Goofs* plays.
It is not absolutely certain that
Casey' was doing all the damage,
but after each play the spectators dis
tinctly heard Davis' "You've got to
stop Kazanjian."
To complete the roster of thirty,
Pop has selected the following: Wor
den, end; Klabau and Gilford, tackles;
Morley, guard; Crary and M. Murphy,
quarters; and Sims and Fretrup,
halves.
