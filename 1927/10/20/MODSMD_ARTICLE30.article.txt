Since the elimination of intercollegiate competition for Stanford
women, nothing has taken its place to add any zest to the athlctic cur
riculum of the Five Hundred.
Intramural competition, similar to that indulged in by the men, would
be one solution to this problem. At the University of Southern California,
as well as at other Western colleges, this is much in vogue. U. S. C. has
a regular intramural schedule for women, with pairings in brackets in the
approved fashion. An inter-sorority cup is also offered to the sorority
which stands highest in the final intramural ratings.
Intramural hockey at Stanford might be a little cumbersome because
it requires eleven players on a side, but competition in basketball, archery,
swimming and tennis ought to put new life into the flagging interest of
the women in their athletic plant. W. A. A. Board could take up the
matter, and offer its recommendations to the various living groups, which
in turn could submit their entries and arrange a schedule. The result
would doubtless give to women's athletics at Stanford a new lease on life.
