# Red-Hot Literature

### 
Every one of the past ten days we have gone over to the Library to
study. To further this aim, we even got out a book and took it to a table,
then started to read, got through a few pages, remarked how hot it was,
pulled off our coat and slid down onto our spine.
The first thing we knew our head was nodding; we jerked it back and
looked around, only to see there were two others at the table already fast
asleep. So we just gave in to the nice warm room and went to sleep, too.
Now this sounds fine, but we have the whole night in which to sleep;
SOMETIMES we want to do a little studying; and SOMETIMES we
want to do it in the Library; but how can we do it when it's so hot we
go to sleep before we can read half a page?
We'd like to see the Library considerably cooler, and we have a lot
of friends who concur in our opinion.
