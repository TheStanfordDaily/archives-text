Pursuant to various comments which have come to its notice, the
Executive Committee has decided to remove the defunct information
posted on the War Bulletin Board located in the corridor back of Me
morial Court between the corner of the Law Building and the Germanic
Languages Building.
Along with the material goes a great mental strain imposed on many
of the curious members of the student body who couldn't decide whether
or not the information was there as a memorial or merely through inad
vertence. With the burden of deciding this question removed, we can
devote more time and effort to the problem of discovering the fourth
dimension, trisecting an angle, or figuring out the score of the Big Game.
