The Daily Nebraskan ran the following item in its columns on Octo
ber 14:
"Campus territory amounting to 11,000 acres will be appropriated by
Stanford University for developing the greatest botanical gardens in the
world. One million dollars must be secured before work is begun. It is
estimated that the ultimate cost will be almost ten million dollars."
Well, well, well, all this going on under our very noses and we didn't
even know about it.
