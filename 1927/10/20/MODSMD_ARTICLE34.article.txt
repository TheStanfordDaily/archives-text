# Three for the Band!
## 
### 
Whereas the editorial columns of the "Columbia Spectator" and the
"Cornell Daily Sun" are filled with plaints as to the sloppy appearance
and general poor effect of their respective bands at football games, we
can point with pride to the efficiency and pleasing aspect of the Stanford
Band.
Nattily attired in their trim red and white uniforms, they present a
commendable appearance, and the quality of the music furnished does the
organization credit. There's no need for us to bow our heads in sorrow
at the thought of the reaction of visiting rooters to the band. We know
that reaction will be admiration.
