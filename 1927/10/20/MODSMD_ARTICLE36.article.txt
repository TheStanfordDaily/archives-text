The Editor, Sir:
With an erroneous trust in the Stan
ford Honor System I left a card index
file on one of the shelves designed
for students to leave books, hats, and
the like downstairs in the Library
about a week ago. The next day it
was gone.
As the box contained not only all j
the work I had put in on my pro-!
seminar course this quarter but a
complete identification card, I hoped
that it had been taken by mistake
and would he returned. However, such
was not the case. As the file can be
of no value to anyone but myself,
since individual topics were assigned,
the kleptomaniac or otherwise is I
either as ignorant of Stanford tradi
tions as the well-meaning freshman
of three years ago who went around

, the Quad gathering the books and foun
| tain pens from the windows and
turned them into the Lost and Found,
! or else he or she is so depraved as to
, destroy the work of a fellow student
for the sake of a wooden box and a
few cards. If the latter is the case,
t?ie present writer would be obliged if
| a rubber band were put around the
I used cards, if these are not already
! confiscated, an dthe latter returned to
; where they were found. It is within
the limits of human endurance to pur
chase a new file, but the contents
can be of service to no one but myself.
Will Stanford students have to give
up trusting their belongings for a few
I hours on the Quad as a totally unsafe
proposition, or can something be done
to make the traditions of the Univer
sity universal with all the student
body? â€”E.C.
