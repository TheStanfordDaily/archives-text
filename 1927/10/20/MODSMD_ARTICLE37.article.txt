# UNIVERSITY SPENDS $40,000 IMPROVING ENGINEERING SHOPS
## 
### 
Expenditures of approximately $40,-
000 are being made by the University
to improve the laboratories of the
Department of Engineering as recent
ly reorganized. Money for this im
provement is being supplied by the
regular Engineering Department fund.
The various engineering shops are
being rearranged according to a plan |
for the conservation of building space, j
and new and more up-to-date experi-!
mental apparatus is being installed.
The old machine shop equipment, for
merly located in the Machine Shop I
Building, has been moved to the
Forge and Foundry building where ex
tensive repairs have been made.
Of the new apparatus, the machine j
shop receives four expensive lathes — I
two of which are said to be thebest 1
manufactured in the United States, a
milling machine, and a grinder for
grinding tools to standard angles.
Each machine will be driven by a
separate electric motor.
In the Forge and Foundry shops, an i
electrically operated melting furnace j
for melting steel, and several otherj
special furnaces, as well as a new ex
haust and blowing system are being
installed. Provisions are also being
made for acetylene and electrical
welding.
