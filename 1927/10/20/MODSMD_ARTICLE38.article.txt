# AMERICAN INFLUENCE ON EUROPE'S SCIENCE INCREASES â€“ KOFOID

American influence upon Europe in
scientific matters is seemingly grow
ing stronger, says Dr. C. A. Kofoid,
Chairman of the Department of Zool
ogy at the University of California,
who has just returned from a three
months' trip across the Atlantic, j
where he represented the University, \
and on several occasions the United |
States, at international scientific con
ferences.
The war has been a serious setback
to scientific institutions in Great
Britain and Europe, he says, and the
practical application of science has
accelerated more than the study of'
pure science. This development is i
parallel to that of America, particu- ;
larly in reference to agricultural j
science.
American money also is playing an
important part in the development of
scientific projects in Europe, Dr. Ko
foid says, through the Rockefeller
Foundation and other organizations.
The three conferences attended by
Dr. Kofoid while abroad concerning
medicine, zoology, and genetics were
very well attended. The large attend
ance, he points out, is proof of the
increasing number of men and women
devoting their time to scientific re
search, and also to the growth of the
American contingent. At Budapest
there were about thirty Americans
present, and at Berlin there were
fifty. A number of Americans read
papers at the conferences.
In spite of this apparent activity on
the part of America, however, Dr.
Kofoid found that knowledge of Eng
lish among European scientists, espe
cially among the younger generation, i
is less than it was before the war.
