## INSTRUCTIONS TO FRESHMAN THEATRE-GOERS 
### 
Make plenty of noise coming in.
Get lost from your companions.
This is a good excuse to cause a good
deal more confusion.
Trip over everyone's feet getting to
your seat. And don't forget to knock
the heads of the people in the row
ahead as you pass; if you have a
book or hard elbow, use that to dis
arrange the coiffure of any old lady
in front of you.
Stand up a long time before settling
down. A large overcoat is good to
flourish in the air, making sure to hit
all your neighbors as you take it off.
Be sure and have some potato chips
or peanut brittle in a good crinkly
bag. That is a big point in your favor.
Don't read the subtitles. That is
too old. But any comments will make
a big hit. Funny cracks, loudly uttered,
will win a great deal of admiration,
applause, and laughter from all those
sitting near, especially upperclassmen.
If there are any gadgets or gum
selling machines on the seats, pry
them off and take them along.
If there is vaudeville, the perform
ers always want your suggestions and
hints. After all, their public is their
best friend and severest critic. Shout,
whistle, or stamp in all passionate
love scenes to show that you know
what it is all about.
When you are kicked out, use the
never-failing expressions such as "I've
been kicked out of better theatres
than this" and"I didn't want to see
the lousy picture anyway."
Take everything in the lobby that
appeals to you. The management aims
to please each and every customer.
Go shoot yourself.
