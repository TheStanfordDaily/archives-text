SEATTLEr Wash., Oct. 19. — (Spe
cial)— Modern youth has more temp
tations, just at present drinks more
liquor, and yet on the whole is more
moral than ever before, are three con-
of Ben B. Lindsey, founder
and for many years judge of the juve
nile court of Denver.
"I have observed more drinking
among youths since prohibition than
ever before," Lindsey declares. He
sees the human disposition to do
things when told "Thou shalt not"
being illustrated by antagonism to the

| coercion of prohibitory laws.
"Prepare youth for the path, not the
path for youth," urges the famous
"little judge" before whom thousands
have told their stories of broken or
saddened lives. Young people today
! feel they deserve more freedom. "(Jive
it to them," he advises, "but give it to
them with culture."
The jurist does not consider the
college youth as the moral Moses of
the present day. "Hope lies not with
1 college youths, but with training be
! ginning in the cradle. College youths,
| as future parents, should learn that
I their duty lies in equipping them
selves to give such training," Lindsey
I believes.
