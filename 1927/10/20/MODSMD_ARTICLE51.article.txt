# COOLIDGE IS DEEDED INDIANA JOKER FARM
## 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS, lnd„ Oct. 19.—The
farm deeded to President Coolidge by
Luke Duffy, Indiana agricultural leader,
is worth $13,000, it was estimated by the
State Farm Bureau today.
But the bureau admitted the farm
probably could not be sold for that
amount. It carried a mortgage of $3,500.
"Under average conditions, the farm
should yield an income of $200 a year
above expenses," L. L. Needier of the
Bureau said. "But when you consider
that the farmer, working as a common
laborer in a factory, cotdd earn $1,600 a
year, it is apparent he would be losing
money by working the farm."
Duffy deeded the farm to President
Coolidge, as Trustee, and other oppo
nents of McNary-Haugen Farm Legis
lation "for services which they have
failed to render to agriculture."
