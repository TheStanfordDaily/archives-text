CINCINNATI, Ohio, Oct. 19—A plea
for systematized maternity attention for
the isolated, rural mother was made here
by Mrs. Mary Breckenridge, before the
American Public Health Association.
Mrs. Breckenridge, Director of the
Kentucky Committee for Mothers and
Babies, said:
"Our death rate is the highest of any,
contrasting the perfected midwifery
service of several countries with the in
adequate service in rural America. That
is why we have lost more women in our
nation than men in battle.
"Maternity is the young woman's bat
tlefield. It is more dangerous, more pain
ful, more mutilating than war and as
inexorable as all the laws of God."
