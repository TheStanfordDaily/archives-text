LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. 19.—(P.1.P.)—
Underweight is tiie most common ail
ment among women of the University
of Nebraska, according to Dr. Inez
Philbrick, of the University Medical
Staff. This she attributes to the pre
vailing mode for slim figures. Foot
troubles come next, due to wearing
improper footwear, with anemia from
malnutrition and nervous breakdown
from lack of sleep close behind.
Despite the prevalence of these ail
ments, Dr. Philbrick says the women
entering the university today are far
healthier than their sisters of fifteen
or twenty years ago.
