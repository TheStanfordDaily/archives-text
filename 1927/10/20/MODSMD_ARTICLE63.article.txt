# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Yale has a pretty fair set of running
backs too, no doubt about that. Tad
Jones may not be the best line-coach
in the world, but you've got to admit
he always has some excellent ball
carriers. Caldwell, Goodwine, and Co.
will make plenty of trouble for Yale's
opponents in the future.
As for T. A. D. Jones, who is sing
ing his swan song as Yale coach, for
business reasons, and perhaps, partly
because of the "Down Town Athletic

I Club"and the "Pool Hall Betters' As
sociation," it must be said that he has
j won more than his share of games,
and that he has been a very fine in«
1 fluence on Yale athletics. Tad was
both a football and baseball star at
Yale back in 190 S. In 191G, he coached
j Cupid Black's team, which was one of
two Yale teams to defeat Harvard in
thirteen years. Lately, however, things
have been different. Jones will be
t missed at New Haven.

What of Yale in 1927? Will the
"cradle of football" hold once again a
first-class team, as a final tribute to
Tad Jones, its great coach, who is
quitting at the end of the season, or
1 will Old Eli suffer another setback as
! it did in 1926, when games were lost
I to Brown, Army, Maryland, and
j Princeton?
Where are the Coys and Ileffelfin
gers, Shevlins and Hinkeys that made
Yale supreme on the gridiron in days
of yore? Harvard has finally beaten
Yale at crew —is this to be a Crimson
year in football as well? But we're
getting a little too far ahead, for Yale
plays the Army day after tomorrow
and the memory of last year's 33 to 0
defeat still rankles in the hearts of
old grads and students, and so, for
the moment, all thoughts are of re
venge on the men of West Point. Har
vard will come later, as will Dart
mouth, Maryland, and Princeton.
You have to hand it to Yale. She
doesn't pick the soft ones. Probably
only Pennsylvania has a harder
schedule of all the eastern colleges.
Fully 35,000 words of press matter
were telegraphed from the press box
of the Memorial Stadium at the Uni
versity of Kansas on the occasion of
the Kansas-Wisconsin football game.

Davis Agricultural College will hold
a short course in decidious fruitu
and grapes from November 27 to De
cember 3.


How About Old Eli?
