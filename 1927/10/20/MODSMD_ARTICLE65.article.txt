# TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD GIFT TO LIBRARY PROFESSOR EVANS-WENTZ MAKES COMPILATION TRANSLATED FROM EIGHTH CENTURY ORIGINAL
## 
### Page Bradshaw 
Professor Walter Y. Evans-Wentz, '
'06, recently presented the Stanford (
Library with a copy of his latest book,
"The Tibetan Book of the Dead." This
is a compilation of an old Tibetan
sacred book written in about the |
eighth century, and translated for |
Professor Wentz by Lama Kazi Dawa- j
Samdup, a learned scholar of the Oc- :
cult Sciences of Tibet and Western
Science as well.
Professor Wentz lived some time !
in India where he made a study of
religions and particularly of this j
branch, which deals with the after
death experiences on the so-called
"Bardo" plane. He is now residing at
Jesus College, Oxford, England, where
his book was published.
Art of Dying Treated •
This Text, as explained in a fore
word by Sir John Woodroffe, deals I
with the technique of dying and the
attitude of mind which makes Death
the entrance to good future lives
until the final liberation, or Nirvana. 1
In the language of the renouncer of
fleshly life it tells the nobly born that
one should not cling to life on earth, j
but implore the aid of the Divine
Mother for a safe passing and for the
attainment of all-perfect Buddhahood.
In the Buddhist belief, "Death as
well as Life is an Art, though both
are often muddled through." A man
ual of religious therapeutics follows
this work on the art of dying, filled
with the most elaborate directions to
the departing soul and the rites which I
must be performed by those left on I
earth.
Spirit Wanderings Told
The last and perhaps the most in-1
teresting part of the book is a de- j
scription of the experiences of the
deceased during the period between
Death and Rebirth. Unlike Christians,
Buddhists believe in Reincarnation of
the soul, but their goal is the same
in their striving for attainment of j
perfect freedom from earthly desires.
Man is in fact liberated, but he does
not know it. When he realizes it he i3
freed. The departed may rise or fall
in his next earthly existence to the

I extent in which he has turned from
! the material viewpoint.
On the Bardo plane, between Death
and Life, the dead are not at first con-;
scious that they have left the world, !
and their imagination calls forth the
objects they were most fond of or
i accutsomed to. Later they realize that
' they are dead, and then conies the
| testing of the liberation of their
souls. The Text is full of directions
! to the departed in this trial. Near the
, end of the period they begin to visu
alize earthly desires, and soon enter
an embryo to be born again into the
I world by their own choice.
"Blessed State" Is Good
When the soul has really achieved
the Freedom of perfection, it is re
leased from the cycle of wandering j
and is absorbed int otlie Void, which
is not claimed to be nothing, but a
j state unknown to finite experience.
This blessed state may be achieved
at any time.
The period on the Bardo plane is
( forty-seven days long, the square of
the sacred number seven, which fig
ures in the Christian religion as well |
| in the observance of Sabbath.
This book goes a long way in show
ing the oriental attitude and philo
sophy which is so little understood.,
It will be placed on the library shelves
as soon as it is catalogued.

In the language of the renouncer of
fleshly life it tells the nobly born that
one should not cling to life on earth, j
but implore the aid of the Divine
Mother for a safe passing and for the
attainment of all-perfect Buddhahood.
In the Buddhist belief, "Death as
well as Life is an Art, though both
are often muddled through." A man
ual of religious therapeutics follows
this work on the art of dying, filled
with the most elaborate directions to
the departing soul and the rites which I
must be performed by those left on I
earth.
Spirit Wanderings Told
The last and perhaps the most in-1
teresting part of the book is a de- j
scription of the experiences of the
deceased during the period between
Death and Rebirth. Unlike Christians,
Buddhists believe in Reincarnation of
the soul, but their goal is the same
in their striving for attainment of j
perfect freedom from earthly desires.
Man is in fact liberated, but he does
not know it. When he realizes it he i3
freed. The departed may rise or fall
in his next earthly existence to the

I extent in which he has turned from
! the material viewpoint.
On the Bardo plane, between Death
and Life, the dead are not at first con-;
scious that they have left the world, !
and their imagination calls forth the
objects they were most fond of or
i accutsomed to. Later they realize that
' they are dead, and then conies the
| testing of the liberation of their
souls. The Text is full of directions
! to the departed in this trial. Near the
, end of the period they begin to visu
alize earthly desires, and soon enter
an embryo to be born again into the
I world by their own choice.
"Blessed State" Is Good
When the soul has really achieved
the Freedom of perfection, it is re
leased from the cycle of wandering j
and is absorbed int otlie Void, which
is not claimed to be nothing, but a
j state unknown to finite experience.
This blessed state may be achieved
at any time.
The period on the Bardo plane is
( forty-seven days long, the square of
the sacred number seven, which fig
ures in the Christian religion as well |
| in the observance of Sabbath.
This book goes a long way in show
ing the oriental attitude and philo
sophy which is so little understood.,
It will be placed on the library shelves
as soon as it is catalogued.

Art of Dying Treated •
This Text, as explained in a fore

with the technique of dying and the
attitude of mind which makes Death
the entrance to good future lives
until the final liberation, or Nirvana. 1
