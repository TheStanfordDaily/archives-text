# DAILY MANAGER RETURNS FROM CANADIAN TRIP
## Conn Declares Flight Was Most Novel Experience Of a Lifetime SPEERS ARRIVES TODAY P.I.P.A. Convention Reported Success; Voyage Made Up Vancouver Bay 
### 
Claude C. Conn, business manager
of the Stanford Daily, returned yester
day afternoon by airplane from the
Pacific Intercollegiate Press Associa
tion convention at Vancouver, B.C.
Due to a lack of room, Fred Speers,
Daily editor, was unable to return
with Conn, but will arrive this after
noon in another plane.
"The trip was one of the most
novel experiences of my life," said
Conn last night, discussing the uiglit.
"We flew direct to Corning in the
northern part of California for the
first leg of our trip. Here we trans
ferred to a larger and faster plane
which covered the 180-mile trip to
Medford, Oregon, in an hour and ten
minutes. We flew at an altitude of
13,500 feet, and when we descended
the change of height made my ear
drums pop.
Monoplane to Vancouver
"Arriving at Medford late in the
afternoon, we took a monoplane to
Vancouver, Washington, which is
right across the river from Portland.
Here we missed the plane which was
to take us to Seattle and took a train
which got us into Seattle at 9 o'clock
that night. From here we traveled by
boat to Vancouver, 8.C., arriving there
Monday morning at 7:30 o'clock in
ample time for the convention.
"An interesting feature of the trip
was the voyage up Vancouver Bay in
the Harbor Commissioner's yacht,
Fispa, at ihe close of the convention.
On returning from this trip the dele
gates were entertained by members
of the Theta Epsilon sorority at the
University of British Columbia.
Flipped for Place
"While we were at Portland on the
return trip we received a telephone
message from the transportation com
pany saying that they could only take
one of us at a time. Fred and I flippod
to see who would go on.
"The biggest thrill of the home trip
wasf when we hit an air pocket going
over the mountains. The plane drop
ped suddenly and was nearly turned
up on end by a heavy gust of wind.
It was quickly righted, however, and
landed at Crissy Field at 2:30 o'clock
as whole as when I started."

to take us to Seattle and took a train
which got us into Seattle at 9 o'clock
that night. From here we traveled by
boat to Vancouver, 8.C., arriving there
Monday morning at 7:30 o'clock in
ample time for the convention.
"An interesting feature of the trip
was the voyage up Vancouver Bay in
the Harbor Commissioner's yacht,
Fispa, at ihe close of the convention.
On returning from this trip the dele
gates were entertained by members
of the Theta Epsilon sorority at the
University of British Columbia.
Flipped for Place
"While we were at Portland on the
return trip we received a telephone
message from the transportation com
pany saying that they could only take
one of us at a time. Fred and I flippod
to see who would go on.
"The biggest thrill of the home trip
wasf when we hit an air pocket going
over the mountains. The plane drop
ped suddenly and was nearly turned
up on end by a heavy gust of wind.
It was quickly righted, however, and
landed at Crissy Field at 2:30 o'clock
as whole as when I started."
