# FALL'S PLEA IN COURT HIGH LIGHT OF TRIAL, FAILS TO WIN JUDGE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20.â€”The spirit
of the two-gun lighting rancher of the
West showed up in the feeble body of
Albert B. Fall in the Teapot Dome trial
today when he rose and pleaded with the
I court to admit evidence which he thought
would help him of the grave conspiracy

charge on which he and Harry F. Sin
clair arc being tried.
Fall's pica was vain. The judge de
nied it kindly, but firmly, and refused
to admit the evidence. The old man
sank down in his chair again and held
a small vial of spirits of ammonia to his
nose for a moment. After lie had calmed
down he drew out a black stogie and
chewed it.
Edward S. Finney, who was First As
sistant Secretary of Interior under Fall,
was under cross-examination by the de
fense.
Blame Placed
In direct testimony Finney had placed
responsibility for the secrecy surrounding
the Teapot Dome negotiations directly
on Fall's shoulders.
The defense was seeking to have him
state his interpretation of the policy gov
erning the interior department's handling
of naval oil lands. Fall's policy had
heen attached by the supreme court as
one of bad faith. Fall believed Finney,
a government witness, would testify that
his interpretation was the same as Fall's.
The dramatic incident came after three
hours of dreary haggling between the
opposing lawyers. The jury was rarely
awake.
