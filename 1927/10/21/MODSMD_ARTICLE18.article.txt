## 
### 
ROME, Oct. 20.â€”Fascism lias ruled
! against any return to the Pope of Uic
Temporal Power which he lost in 1870.
The Fascist attitude is revealed in a
party communique discussing the various
factors on which depend solution of the
old controversy between Church and
state.
Thus, settlement of the Roman ques
j tion has struck another snag.
Papal Partisans Obdurate
The statement, observers believe, com
, plicates the situation more than ever be
cause the Holy See is insistent upon
I Temporal Power.
The Fascist party believes settlement
of the knotty problem is possible, never
theless, for "there has never been a knot
in history that could not be unwound
cither by force or patience or sacrifice."
Close observers predicted settlement
i was near, pointing out that Mussolini
was anxious to succeed in ironing out
j Church-State differences where other
) Premiers had failed. Some observers
j even saw the Vatican coming out of the
! settlement a full-fledged state.
Fascism Is Unbending
I The Fascist communique dashes that
| possibility. Even in a reduced form, Fas
cism will not tolerate Papal Temporal
Power.
For years the Roman question, involv
ing disputes between the Vatican and the
Italian Government over lands and juris
diction, lay dormant. Then, a fortnight
ago, Observatore Romanc, official organ
of the Holy See, revived the controversy
by indicating tiie time for settlement
was rife. Its article liad the official san
tion of the Vatican.
