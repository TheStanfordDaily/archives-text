# CUBBERLEY SUPPORTS ABOLISHMENT OF LIFE TEACHING CERTIFICATE
## 
### 
Dean Elwood P. Cubberley of the!
Stanford School of Education supports i
the statement made by State Superin-'
tendenc Cooper recently that life certifi-J
cates for teachers should be abolished.
"California life teaching certificates
are the cheapest given in any state in!
the union," said Dr. Cubberley. "All that j
is required is for a teacher to get a job!
and hold it for forty-four months, and
the life certificate is granted."
"No provision is made for original
standards, or for improving standards
of education. I agree with Dr. Cooper
that teaching methods are changing con
stantly, and the work of a teachcr con
tinually requires newer and higher:
standards.
"We certainly ought to get rid )f a
certificate that can be got so cheaply, and
I felt that the arguments presented by
Dr. Cooper, who pointed out that stand
ards of years past are no longer satis
factory, are entirely sound."
