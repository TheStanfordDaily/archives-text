# BRUINS SLATED TO MEET WASEDA CAGE TEAM NEXT JANUARY
## 
### 
Plans for a basketball encounter be
tween the University of California at
Los Angeles and Waseda University,
champion casaba tosscrs of Japan and
Korea, early in January have been nearly
, completed.
Waseda, the first oriental basketball
i team in some years to visit the coast, is
| planning a basketball tour of this coun
try during January. A recent letter from
the foreign university stated its willing
ness to include the Bruins on its sched
ule. The date has not been definitely
arranged as yet, but it will be announced
later when the rest of the schedule is
made public.
There was talk of an international
! game of this kind last year, but the Jap-
I ancse team could not make the trip.
â–  However, their athletic ability can be
j vouched for by the Golden Bears who
I played a series of baseball games with
j Waseda in Japan last spring.
