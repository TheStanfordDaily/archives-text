# ROOTERS SEND REDSHIRTS OFF TO CONQUER AGGIES IN NORTH
## O.A.C. Squad Prepares Hot Reception for Visiting Gridiron Men ORANGEMEN CONFIDENT Deception, Open Field Work Expected to Feature Portland Battle 
### Milton Silverman 
More than two hundred rooters
gathered at the Southern Pacific de
pot yesterday afternoon sent the Stan
ford varsity off to Portland with a
final skyrocket ringing in their ears.
And the team will need that encour
agement, will need a great deal more,
for tiie Aggies are awaiting them up
north with their arms outstretched
and filled with line plunges, and end
runs, passes, and kicks. The Redshirts
will be given a royal welcome.
Coach Schissler has been waiting
for a long time to take a crack at
Pop Warner, and he and his Orange
men think the hour has come, for
Stanford no longer makes the North
tremble in their shoulder-pads. Stan
ford has been defeated once, and has
been tied once.
Deception Planned
With a deceptive Luby at quarter
and the flashy Maple at half, the
Orangemen will at least make the
game interesting, for Stanford also
uses plenty of deception and open
field running. Aggie scouts were re
ported to have enjoyed themselves
immensely at the Cardinal-Trojan
melee, and Schissler will know just
as much about Pop's tricks as the
Stanford mentor knows about his
rival's.
Robbins and Logan will go out of
their way to meet Stanford plays
around the ends. The first, moreover,
is supposed to be as good at catching
passes as Morley Drury is at knocking
them down. Logan is a tackier that
rivals Hibbs.
Tough Tackles
At tackle, with Luce, Schell, and
Kent, and at guard, with Carlson,
Eilers, and Badley, the Aggies have a
complete assortment of efficient play
wielders. Kirk and Geddes are Schis
sler's choices to meet Mr. McCreery,
and these two lads are eager for the
introduction.
The Northerners will be playing on
home ground, on a sawdust field, and
before a hilarious homecoming crowd.
Neither factors mean any breaks for
the Cardinals. These returning grads
will give just the pep and the spirit
that the Aggie backs need to start
their reign of terror.
Weak in Journalism
Avrit, Whitlock, and Montgomery,
with a few others, have not made
great fame in the backfleld, either
athletically or journalistically, but a
number of the Trojan line retain Ore
gon footprints on their spines. Also,
Oregon fans claim that the boys are
good, and from such pessimistic root
ers, made even more downhearted by
numerous bad slips, these words are
worthy of consideration.
The Redshirts arrive in Portland
this nfternoon, and will take a light
practice on the famous sawdust. Later
they will feast at one side of a train
ing table at the Multnomah Hotel,
while the Orangemen dine at the
other.
