# ORGANIZE DISCUSSION GROUPS AT Y.M.C.A. FOR FRESHMAN MEN
## 
### 
"Organized discussion groups built
around prominent student leaders will
feature the Y.M.C.A. program for the
freshmen this year," declared Ben
Culver, Y.M.C.A. secretary, yesterday,
when outlining plans.
"These discussion groups will give
the new men an insight into the vari
ous activities and an acquaintance
ship with the representative men in
them."
Besides such meetings, informal
discussion groups will be held each
Sunday evening in the Encina lobby,
with noted members of the faculty
speaking. At intervals dinners will
also be given where off-campus speak
ers will be heard.
To help in carrying out this pro
gram a Freshman Cabinet of sixteen
men has been formed. Next Wednes
day evening a meeting will be held at
7:30 o'clock in the "Y" building to
mako final arrangements for the
work.
