# On With the Dance
## 
### 
The off-campus dance question is with us again. At its last meeting,
the Executive Committee temporarily tabled the application of a certain
organization for an off-campus dance. This was done despite the fact
that there now stands on the minutes of the Committee a resolution ap
proving off-campus dances with certain reservations.
This resolution was formally passed on May 17 of this year. Under
the new rules, seven dates were granted to certain sororities. No other
dates were applied for. No conduct unbecoming to Stanford men and
women was reported at these dances.
The provisions included in the resolution were recommended by Dr.
Wilbur, Dean Culver and Dean Yost to the Executive Committee as the
only effective means of regulating conduct at off-campus dances.
No fault has been found by the administration with the dances given
under these regulations, which have been in force only a short time. Yet,
the Executive Committee arbitrarily tables the application of an organi
zation, about which no questions of "moral turpitude" were raised, which
applied in good faith for an off-campus dance under the new ruling. Their
action is even more inconsistent than would appear on the surface in view
of the fact that a motion to rescind the resolution and ban off-campus
dances entirely was lost for want of a second during the meeting.
