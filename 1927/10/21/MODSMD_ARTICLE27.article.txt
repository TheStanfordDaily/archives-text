Students of Stanford pride themselves on the fact that the campus is
essentially democratic. They also pat themselves on the back when they
consider that their number is made up of men and women from forty-one
of the United States, twenty foreign countries, and four United States

classes in their own countries. Being from the higher intellectual groups
in the world they can hardly fail to know many things which would be
beneficial to Americans, if the Americans would take the trouble to seek
them out.
It is a fine thing to have a democratic spirit and a cosmopolitan popu

body's most valuable members it is not of much use.
