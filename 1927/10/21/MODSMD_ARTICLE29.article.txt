What this University needs is a senior course in the Assumptions. Here
are we (editorially speaking) within three months of graduating, faced
with the realization that we don't know the difference between the terms
Objective, Subjective, Form and Content, Romanticism and Classicism,
and a myriad of other antonyms and synonyms in common use by the
academic devotee. Furthermore, and what is probably worse, we have
never owned a pair of corduroy pants.
All these things (even the pants) are taken terrifyingly for granted by
our professors and fellow students in classroom discussion and elsewhere,
and no one seems inclined to do anything about it. Of course, it is quite
possible that we, alone, are in ignorance regarding these matters, but on
second thought the good old Ego comes to the rescue with a loud, firm No.
It would be so convenient if there were some course in no particular
subject where we could sort of get together with some sympathetic soul
and talk. Stephen Leacock's ideal college in a nice, comfortable room
with plenty of tobacco. Then, if there is any money left over, the regents
might hire a professor or two.
