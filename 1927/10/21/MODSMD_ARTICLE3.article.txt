# RED ROSEBUD LOST BY BLUSHING USHER IS FOUND ON QUAD
## 
### 
A rod rosebud, fading but still
fragrant, with tho stem plucked
short and one dainty petal
slightly scorched, was found
Tuesday morning on the cloister
north of the Little Theatre. To
all appearances it was the
identical rosebud kissed Monday
evening at the A.S.S.U. concert
by Mme. Claudia Muzio and pre
sented to the blushing usher who
handed her a bouquet of red
roses.
It is assumed that the owner
started out Tuesday morning
wearing the memento of the
soprano in his buttonhole, and
unwittingly lost it. The finder of
the rose notified the Daily, and
the owner may recover It by
communicating with this paper.
