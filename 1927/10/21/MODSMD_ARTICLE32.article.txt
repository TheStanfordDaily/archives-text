# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
May I respectfully suggest tliat the ;
Rally Committee, of which you are a
member, firmly do away with the {
color-blind tradition of singing "Down
with the Golu and Blue" when the
opposing varsity does not wear those
colors? It would involve the writing
of one simple little verse to a well
known melody.
Why not have the Committee hold
a contest with, or without silverware
awards, to secure at least two new
verses to the bleacher songs now in
use, and at least a half-dozen entirely
new songs. That sounds ambitious,
but the volume of interest might be
larger than if only one or two were
solicited. Then hold a short pep
rally, and have some of the fellows
sing the new songs so that the rest
of the school may select one or two,
and let them learn the ditties on the
spot.
New songs will mean different
music. While we have no large music
department to aid in the selection,
there should be enough musicians in
the thousands of men here to form a
capable committee for selection. Our
present anthems are getting a bit
worn from repetition during the last
quarter of a century, and while the

music and the words are inspiring, it j
is tiresome to sing the same few over
and over.
By the way, why didn't the rooters
Bing the Trojan Horse .song when we
played the Trojans? Is it being saved
for the Santa Clara game?
So, Mr. Editor, will you use your edi
torial inliuence to stir up a little in
terest on these matters? I do not
flatter myself that I am the only
light-headed sophomore who takes ex
ception to the present method of or
ganized rooting, and perhaps with the
power of the press behind the idea, a
lot could be accomplished before the
end of this season.
