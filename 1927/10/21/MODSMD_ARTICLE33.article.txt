The Editor, Sir:
Wouldn't it be a good thing to have
the bulletin boards cleared of all their
signs about once a month? Their use
fulness is seriously impaired by the
great amount of dead matter on them;
rooms long rented, cars sold, etc. The
three most needing it are by the
postoffice, the engineering corner,
and the English building.
Also a word of praise for the editor
of the Daily. His editorials are fair,
level-headed, and original.
â€”Jack Jennison.
