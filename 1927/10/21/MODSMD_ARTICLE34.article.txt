# HOUSE MANAGERS TO INSTITUTE SYSTEM OF CO-OPERATIVE BUYING
## Committee of Six Named to Consider Ways, Means Of Operating 
### 
The system of co-operative buying
among the fraternities on the campus
came into actual being with the elec
tion of a committee-in-charge at the
meeting of house managers Wednes
day night. The committee is com
posed of five regular members and
Willis Wolf as president of the Inter
fraternity Council; they will meet
with the representative of the Uni
versity, Eliot Ayres, to consider ways
and means of operating as a unit.
The buying of food will not begin
until January so that houses which
are stocked at present will begin on
the same basis with the other groups.
As soon as the marketing begins, a
permanent board will be elected to
handle the work of buying. Staples
will be all that will be bought at first,
and as the system grows it will in
clude the other articles necessary,
such as meat and perishable vegeta
bles.
Jud Crary will represent the alumni
in the work of the group, as he is the
one who started the plan here on the
campus, Wolf announced.
The members of the committee cho
sen to handle the affairs at present
are as follows: Raymond Coleman,
Delta Kappa Epsilon; David Adams,
Kappa Sigma; Grant Burton, Sigma
Nu; Sheldon Riveroll, Theta Delta
Chi; Robert Kearl, Alpha Delta Phi;
and Willis Wolf, Kappa Sigma.
