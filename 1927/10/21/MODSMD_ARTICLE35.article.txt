I read in the paper last night about
some one saying that even if you couldn't
travel in foreign lands, you could sec
your own community. And you know
how serious-minded I am, and that 1
take as much advice as I can.
I was never so impressed in my life, 1
mean it really was the most thrilling
trip. I went to the library first so I could
get acquainted with the people in my
community. It really is a wonderful lo
cal center, because every one walks
through at least once every night.
I was so intent on my purpose, that the
gentleman next to me told me not to try
too hard, that he really didn't mind. And
he was so polite and interesed, that I
told him about the paper. And he of
fered the most fascinating suggestions, 1
mean I was surprised to find that college
men think about traveling, and things.
He thought that 1 should see every
thing, and, my dear, I didn't know there
were so many hills back of the campus.
I was so thrilled. I saw more scenery in
a half an hour than I ever expected to
see.
But the funniest thing was the way we
ran into so much traffic coming hack. I
mean, when we started there weren't any
other cars. But he told me not to worry
about their sudden appearances. And I'm
really quite flattered, because he is going
to come over and study some more with
me tomorrow night.
