which Dick Hyland was technical di
rector, plays for the last time tonight
at the New Stanford Theatre in Palo
Alto.

the picture is nevertheless of particu
lar interest to Stanford students be
cause of the fact that "Tricky" Dick
Hyland is shown in his best form
punting, running, anu carrying the
ball to make a perfect touchdown for
his "dear old alma mater," Shoreham

sities all over the country.
The cast, with Dick Barthelmess
and Barbara Kent in the leads, is on
