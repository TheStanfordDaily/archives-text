BERKELEY, Oct. 20.—(P.1.P.A.)—
Establishment of a number of small
colleges in the University of Califor
nia for students in their first two
years is the plan suggested by Dr.
Monroe E. Deutsch, dean of the Col
lege of eLtters and Science, at Berke
ley, to secure for students the advan
tages of both the small college and the
largo university.
"I should like to see created in the
distinct unit, first one college and
university, as a part of it, but as a
part of it, but as a distinct unit, first
one college and then others consist
ing of students in their first two years.
Dr. Deutscli stated. "In other words, I

istrative unit, the School of Letters
and Science (and perhaps other col
leges), during the lower division
period, put into a considerable num
ber of small units composed of pos
sibly 200 students.
Each of these small colleges would
be under the control of its own fac
ulty and its own dean, according to
Deutsch's plan. The group would be
small, the faculty would be small, and
thus we should have close contact be
tween the members of this one uni
versity community," he said,
