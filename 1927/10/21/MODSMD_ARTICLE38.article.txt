### Vern Cordry 
Professor in History: Our murder
rate is appallingly high. One doesn't
go to European centers to find the
greatest number of crimes. One goes
to nice American cities like Chicago
or Hollywood "
One of Stanford's southern gentle
men: "Hollywood?"

PERSONALS
(As one of them may appear in the
Hollywood Weekly Gazette)
Mr. Thomas Mix, and party of this
city, motored up to Palo Alto to at
tend the Stanford-U.S.C. game. Mr.
Mix sat on the Stanford side, next
to the rooting section, and cheered
lustily for the Cardinals. Fortunately
for Mr. Badenock, head linesman, he
left his guns at home.

Archie Twitsbury, 0.P., dropped in
on us yesterday afternoon to give us
this little poem. It seems that Archie
saw an article in the Daily about a
letter sent to "Miss Encina Hall" by
a sailor. "I wrote this poem about five
times and the metre seems to fi«ll,"
explained Archie as he handed it to
us. For that matter the rhyme and
reason also goes over our heads, so
we are passing it on to the intelli
gentsia:
Miss Encina Hall's a swell gal—
The Navy thinks so, too!
If they should meet Miss Roble —
What would those sailors do!

When we asked Archie what "0.P."
stood for, he explained that it meant
"on pro."

MY ROOMMATE SAID
My roommate sidled up to me very
confidentially and said, "Can I have
your two extra Big Game tickets?
Some friends down South would like
to come up for the Game."
