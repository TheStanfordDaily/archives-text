# Seat Sale For "Lady Of Rose" Gives Promise Of Good House
## 
### 
Scat sale for "The Lady of the Rose"
will continue this week and next at the
office of the Dramatic Council in the Old
Union. Tickets may also he secured at
Crandall's Bookstore in Palo Alto. So
far, the advanced sale promises one of
the biggest audiences in many years of
Sword and Sandal productions.
Work of the cast has been going along
smoothly, and a heavy program of re
hearsals is planned for the last week. In
addition to the interest the play prom
ises for originality, and contrast with
previous campus productions, this is one
of the first plays produced here by a
California author. Martin Flannin is a
resident of Monterey county.
Actors Cast Differently
Most of the actors have been cast as
types entirely different from those in
which they have hitherto appeared. Lucy
Bentley, as the lady of fantasy and the
dream girl, contrasts strongly with her
former roles as the cold Mrs. Darth, in
"Dear Brutus," and as the flashy little
vamp in "The Rover Boys."
Powell Carpenter, as the good-looking
but rather stupid foil for the older hus
band and his wife, Lorraine, plays a part
somewhat similar to the handsome unin
telligent movie star of "Wicked Wil

liam." Lorraine, played by Olga Spirit,
is a hard, brittle woman, unable to un
derstand in any way the liner sensibili
ties of her husband. This objective role
sets off the character of Meredith, which
is almost entirely subjective.
Departs from the Ordinary
In the relationship of Meredith, the
author, and Lubin, the theatrical pro
ducer, the author has drawn on his own
actual experience with the demands of
the theatrical world for happy endings
and sterotyped cast. "The Lady of the
Rose" departs from the hackneyed de
mands of a play in the portrayal of this
relationship.
Lighting effects will contribute to the
effectiveness of the play. A weird dupli
cation of the fantasy and the real woman
is called for by the play and a contrast
between the somber studio of John Mere
dith and the comic burlesqued reproduc
tion of it at Lubin's theatre.
Campus audiences may confidently ex
pect the same type of enjoyment and
thrill that they had at the production of
"The Dover Road," four years ago. "The
Lady of the Rose" combines many of the
same elements of mysticsm and fantasy,
but proceeds to an original and unex
pected climax that is thoroughly realistic.

types entirely different from those in
which they have hitherto appeared. Lucy
Bentley, as the lady of fantasy and the
dream girl, contrasts strongly with her
former roles as the cold Mrs. Darth, in
"Dear Brutus," and as the flashy little
vamp in "The Rover Boys."
Powell Carpenter, as the good-looking
but rather stupid foil for the older hus
band and his wife, Lorraine, plays a part
somewhat similar to the handsome unin
telligent movie star of "Wicked Wil

liam." Lorraine, played by Olga Spirit,
is a hard, brittle woman, unable to un
derstand in any way the liner sensibili
ties of her husband. This objective role
sets off the character of Meredith, which
is almost entirely subjective.
Departs from the Ordinary
In the relationship of Meredith, the
author, and Lubin, the theatrical pro
ducer, the author has drawn on his own
actual experience with the demands of
the theatrical world for happy endings
and sterotyped cast. "The Lady of the
Rose" departs from the hackneyed de
mands of a play in the portrayal of this
relationship.
Lighting effects will contribute to the
effectiveness of the play. A weird dupli
cation of the fantasy and the real woman
is called for by the play and a contrast
between the somber studio of John Mere
dith and the comic burlesqued reproduc
tion of it at Lubin's theatre.
Campus audiences may confidently ex
pect the same type of enjoyment and
thrill that they had at the production of
"The Dover Road," four years ago. "The
Lady of the Rose" combines many of the
same elements of mysticsm and fantasy,
but proceeds to an original and unex
pected climax that is thoroughly realistic.
Scat sale for "The Lady of the Rose"
will continue this week and next at the
office of the Dramatic Council in the Old
Union. Tickets may also he secured at
Crandall's Bookstore in Palo Alto. So
far, the advanced sale promises one of
the biggest audiences in many years of
Sword and Sandal productions.
Work of the cast has been going along
smoothly, and a heavy program of re
hearsals is planned for the last week. In
addition to the interest the play prom
ises for originality, and contrast with
previous campus productions, this is one
of the first plays produced here by a
California author. Martin Flannin is a
resident of Monterey county.
Actors Cast Differently
Most of the actors have been cast as
types entirely different from those in
which they have hitherto appeared. Lucy

"Dear Brutus," and as the flashy little
