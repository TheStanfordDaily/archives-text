# SCRIPPS COLLEGE IS PRAISED ON OUTLOOK BY DEAN MARY YOST
## New Institution for Women Second of Claremont Colleges Group 
### 
"One of the finest things about
Scripps College is its open-minded
ness," declared Dean Mary Yost on
returning early in the week from the
presidential inauguration exercises
held at the new women's college at
Claremont.
"Scripps has a fine sense of direc
tion, but it has no definitely estab
lished policy which cannot be
changed," she said. "It is open to
suggestions and will build up its sys
tem through practical experience."
At a conference on "Problems in
the Education of Women" held in con
nection with President Jaqua's inau
guration, Miss Yost spoke on"The
Campus as a Social Laboratory." She
stressed the importance of making
clear to the student the connection
between theories taught in the class
room and actual practices in student
activities. Dr. Aurelia Reinliardt,
president of Mills College, ex-secre
tary Baker of the War Department,
and President Mann of Grinell Col
lege, lowa, were other speakers on
the program.
Dormitory Impressive
Dean Yost was particularly im
pressed with the Scripps College
plant and dormitory. The dormitory,
in which she stayed during her visit,
is built in Spanish style around open
courts, and is finished on the outside
in white stucco. In the interior a color
scheme of white, soft green, and soft
yellow is carried out.
The rooms, which are all single, are j
l'ully furnished with rugs, chintz
covered armchairs, and a desk, book-1
case, and dresser designed to imitate
old walnut furniture. The walls are
tinted in either soft yellow or green.
Accommodates Fifty
The public rooms include a large ;
living room, a library done in oak i
panelling and walled on three sides
with bookshelves, and a dining room.
Small rooms in which women may en- \
tertain their guests in private open |
off the main living room. There is j
also a small private dining room. The ;
dormitory will accommodate fifty. I
Miss Yost describes the buildings as !
having been designed by one "who |
senses the value of beauty in life. "It \
is a lovely setting for a new experi
ment," she says.
Scripps College for Women is the
second unit of the proposed group of
institutions to be known as '"The
Claremont Colleges." Pomona was the
first of this group.
