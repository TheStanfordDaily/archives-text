# EMOTION EQUIPMENT DETERMINES SUCCESS, OPINE PSYCHOLOGISTS

"Psychologists are of the opinion that
one's success in the world is very largely
determined by his emotional equipment.
This furnishes the most important back
ground for character," declared Dr.
Lewis M. Terman yesterday in refer
ence to the symposium of psychologists
that gathered last Wednesday at Spring
field, Ohio, to discuss a proposed system
of scientific research for testing emo-
tional reactions.
"Psychologists are also generally of
; the opinion that one's emotional reac
tions are largely due to training. Expe
rience indicates that one's tendencies to
certain types of emotional response, may
be fixed as the result of experiences
gained during the first two or three years
of life.
"For example, Professor Watson has
shown that a child may be made to de
velop quickly, fears for many kinds of
stimuli, which do not cause fear by orig
inal nature at all.
"Nearly all fears are due to condi
tioned responses. One's personality is
probably, in large part, the result of
emotional conditioning early in life. This
may be made bold and self-dependent or
lacking in aggressiveness by appropriate
training."

At Wednesday's meeting of he con
son, Danish neurologist, listed fear, hap
piness, sorrow, want, anger, and shyness
as the elements which constituted the
basis for all human actions.
"Most psychologists would not name
these six elements," said Dr. Terman.
"Shyness is derived from fear. Happi
ness is not primary. Fear, anger, love
are ordinarily the three elements named."
