# STUDENTS INVITED TO ROOT AT O.C. CONTEST
## 
### 
Students wanting to see the Olympic
Club-California game at Berkeley tomor
row will have the opportunity of getting
seats in the Olympic Club rooting sec
tion, according to Burt Lapp, former
Stanford yell leader and now yell leader
for the Olympic Club.
The purpose of the rooting section is
to promote anti-professionalism in the
club. The card stunts will be of a sim
ple nature. Stanford people in the sec
tion will not necessarily be yelling
against California.
Passes for admission to the rooting
section are obtainable at the accountant's
office in the Old Union. Tickets to the
stadium must of course be bought at
Berkeley.
