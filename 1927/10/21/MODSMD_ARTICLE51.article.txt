# FACSIMILE COPY OF UNIQUE MANUSCRIPT PRESENTED LIBRARY
## 
### 
A fascimile of the manuscript of the
Cancionero de Baena, a collection of
fifteenth century Spanish poetry, was re
cently printed by the Hispanic Society of
America and a copy presented to the
Stanford Library. This unique manu
script was compiled by Johan Alfon de
Baena, and is the official collection of the
poetic court of John the Second of Cas
tile.
The adventures of the manuscript are
told in a foreword by Henry R. Lang.
It was begun around 1445 and finished
shortly before the death of the king in
1454. From him it passed to the hands
of his son, Henry IV, who gave it to
his sister, Isabella. During this time it
was kept in the palace at Segovia, but
after her death it was placed in the
sacristy of the Royal Chapel at Granada.
Philip II moved it to the library of
the Escorial in 1591 where it remained
till the Royal Spanish Academy and the
Royal Academy of History appointed
three scholars to continue a collection of
Spanish poetry begun at an earlier date.
This manuscript was put in the collection
and was handed down by one of the col
lectors to his descendants. One of the
latter sold it to an English collector,
at whose death it was sold to a French
bookseller, who again sold it to the Bib
liotheque Nationale where it is now.
Two editions of it have been printed,
one in Madrid and one in Leipzig, but
the book given to the Library is in the
form of the original. It is a thick loose
leaf folio of verses in beautiful medieval
printing on heavy paper.
