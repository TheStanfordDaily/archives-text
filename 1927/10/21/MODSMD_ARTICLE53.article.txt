BERKELEY, Oct. 10. (P. I. P.) —
Women at the University of California
insist upon retaining some degree of
femininity. As the result, James Tyson,
chairman of the rally committee, is in a
quandary which threatens to spread and
envelop the rest of the student body.
The trouble began when the women
decided that they would like to be like
the men and hold their football rally in
the Greek Theatre instead of at the base
of the Campanile where it has been held
in past years.
The women decided that they would
have to have a bonfire also, but when it
came to setting out in trucks and wagons
and getting the wood, they rebelled. It
was all right to be a little of a tomboy,
but too much was too much.
Tyson was appealed to. He succumbed
to feminine charms and promised that
the rally committee would get the wood.
But it seems that the members of the
rally commitee, who are juniors and sen
iors, are rather adverse to gathering
wood, a function usually performed by
freshmen. And the freshmen can not be
asked to gather wood for a women's rally
from which they as well a*; the other
men are excluded.
So Tyson and the women are sitting
and pondering, but still there is no wood.
