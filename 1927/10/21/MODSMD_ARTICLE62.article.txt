THE BOY ORATOR
Dink Templeton to our mind
represents most admirably the
easy-going type of Stanford gen
tleman who takes seriously ath
letics, Stanford spirit, and in fact
the whole University.
The Boy Coach spoke at a
smoker in Toyon the night before
last, and as his was a hall audi
ence, he told of the old Encina
days. Dink accounted very reason
ably for the wholesome atmos
phere of Stanford, which he called
a city within itself in which the
student is undisturbed by outside
Irruenccc.
Then, getting "on his mark,"
Dink talked football. The O.A.C.
game in 1919 was described in
connection with predictions made
as to the result of the varsity
clash tomorrow. The Cardinals,
he said, went North that year to
meet a team of football and army
veterans, playing their first game
of American football.
The betting was all on the
proposition that the Aggies would
win 72-0, by which score Washing
ton beat the Golden Bears in their
first attempt at the new game.
O.A.C. GETS SURPRISE
Stanford won the contest when
Adams scooped up a fumble and
ran ninety-seven yards to a touch
down. O.A.C. was so stunned it
never recovered from the defeat,
and has yet to win a game of
American football from the Red
shirts.
Dink calls O.A.C. the Stanford
of the Northwest. It is a small
town college and incidentally
would like nothing better than to
win from the Cards this season.
As for the said Cards, the track
mentor says they will play with
more pep than they have yet
shown, owing to the cool north
ern weather.
