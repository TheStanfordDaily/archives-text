# Warm Days Lure Varsity Net Men
## McElvenny, Al Herrington, Wheatley Veterans 
### 
Lured forth by the continuous warm j
weather, members of the varsity tennis I
team have been practicing daily, giving |
promise of another successful net season j
for Stanford in the spring.
The mainstays of he team are expeced
to be Ralph McElvenny, Alan Herring
ton, and John Wheatley, remaining mem
bers of the 1927 varsity. McElvenny and
Herrington competed throughout the East
list. Wheatley played extensively in San
during the summer, both winning first
ten rankings in the national intercollegiate
J'rancisco, greatly improving his game.
Competition Close
Competition for places bids fair to be
close, with the fine form being shown by
Gomer Thomas and Larry Driscoll.
Thomas played second on the 1928 fresh
man team, but allowed his game subse
quently to slump for lack of practice,
lie took up play once again during the
summer and now has recovered much of
his former effectiveness.
Driscoll has come to the front by con
centrated eflor the last two years. He
has a natural game, with sound ground
strokes, good service and net work. Lack
of steadiness is his main difficulty. This
can be overcome by experience and hard,
steady practice, Coach Hal Davis thinks.
Tide Turns Toward Stanford
Until two years ago, Stanford took reg
ular beatings in the net spor from the
University of California. In 1926 the tide
turned, and a Stanford team composed
of Holman, Ogden, Herringon, and Mc-
Elvenny won the first victory from
Berkeley since 1912. Last year the same
team repeated. This season, with Hol
[ man and Ogden graduated, new players
| must he developed from tiie ranks to take
I the veterans' places.
