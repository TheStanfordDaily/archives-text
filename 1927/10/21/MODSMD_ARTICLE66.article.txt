NEW YORK CITY, Oct. 20.— (1.P.)
—Education is an endless process
which has neither a beginning nor an
end, according to Nicholas Murray
Butler, of Columbia University. He
believes the increased strength of
resistance is the only difference be
tween the educational status of the
child and that of the adult. He also
made the statement that "Intelligent
occupation itself is as much a part of
true educational process as is study
in classrooms, in library, and in lab
oratory."
