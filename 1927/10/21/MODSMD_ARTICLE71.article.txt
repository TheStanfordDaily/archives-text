## 
### 
The sophomore interclass football team
will meet the "left at homers" of the
freshman team this afternoon in a regu
lar game, announced Charles Davis yes
terday.
The sophomores, which have been the
underdogs so far, have been improving
through the week with the addition of
some new men, so that they expect to
show their real ability against the Frosh
team. This week's practice has brought
out a number of good men for the sec
ond year players. Northrup and Stanley
both are hitting hard. Against the sec
ond string Grays the line of sophomores
held successfully against all the line
plays their opponents could offer.
The freshmmn interclass team scrim
maged against the juniors Wednesday
night and looked good in their playing.
However, the juniors are conceded a bet
ter chance when the real competition
starts. The seniors are working out by
themselves and with the Paly team, so
that comparisons are not possible as yet.
The fourth year men boast several hold
overs, which helps to make them likely
contenders for the interclass title.
All the teams are winding up three
weeks of practice today in good condi
tion. Next week will see hard practice
for the first games which come off at
the end of the week.
