# GRAYS TEAM PRIMED TO ENTER ST. MARY'S GAME TOMORROW AFTERNOON; FAVORED TO AVENGE EARLY VARSITY, YEARLING DEFEATS
## Contest Scheduled for 2:30 O'clock in Stadium; Clash Initial One 
### 
Resting after their strenuous scrim
mage with the secon dvarsity Thursday
afternoon, Coach Hal Davis' Stanford
Grays indulged only in signal practice
last night in preparation for the Saint
Mary's game in the Stadium tomorrow
at 2:30 o'clock.
If Davis can keep his men going at
the pace they set Thursday, he needn't
worry about the sort of a showing they
will make against the Oaklanders. It
will take much better than the usual
Saint reserve to beat them.
No Dope Available
Saturday's clash will he the first game
for either team; so concrete predictions
are out of order. Basing conclusions on
the Grays' work against Warner's second I
string, however, it seems very likely that I
they will do what the varsity and the j
freshmen failed to accomplish—whip St.
Mary's.
A trip to the Stadium tomorrow after
noon may hold considerable interest to
those who see nothing but gloom in
Stanford's football horizon. It is not a
had guess that some of the future mem- |
hers of Card varsities will be seen in ac
tion there.
Tentative Lineups
A tentative lineup for the St. Mary's
game follows: Groenwegen, center; i
Driscoll and Fetzer, guards; Ruling and
Munson, tackles; Dietrich and Rehrig,
ends; Lewis, quarterback; Taylor or
Wilson, fullback; May, right half; and)
McCone or Goodcell, left half.
