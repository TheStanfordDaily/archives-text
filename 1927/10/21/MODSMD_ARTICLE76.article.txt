## 
### 
"Olympic swimming and diving con- j
| testants from every part of the country
will come to train at Searsville Lake,
I next spring," Ernie Brandsten declared!
' yesterday. He will conduct the camp.
The list of experts who will seek
I Brandsten's instruction cannot be de- j
j termined until they indivadually apply.
Besides the Hawwaiian team, there will
be both men and women representatives ;
from all sections of the country.
Aquatic stars from the Middle West:
and from the East come to take advan-,
tage of the early spring here, while
Southern swimmers come to temper their \
bodies to a more rigorous climate, for J
a cold and possibly a rainy season is an- j
ticipated for the Olympic Games at Am- \
sterdam this coming summer. In last
year's tryouts, held at Indianapolis early j
in June, the water was so cold that sev-1
eral participants were overcome in the
| mile swim.
At the training camp, which wll open
; for two months starting early in May, 1
there will be 50-yard and 50-metre I
courses, high-diving apparatus, spring-'
boards, and sun baths. The colony will
live and eat at-the camp.
