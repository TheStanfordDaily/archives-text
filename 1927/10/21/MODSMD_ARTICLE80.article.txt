# THIRTY FRESHMAN FOOTBALL MEN ON WAY TO LOS ANGELES FOR ANNUAL ENCOUNTER WITH 1931 U.S.C. GRIDDERS IN COLISEUM
## Husky Hunt Probably Will Use Large Number as Game Progresses 
### Bob Speers 
When the Lark left Palo Alto last
night twenty-two yearling gridmen were
I 011 board along with Coaches Hunt and
j Michell. Los Angeles is the destination,
j and the Trojan Babes arc to be the vic
tims.
The possibility that the victims will do
I a little victimizing casts somewhat of a
I shadow over Saturday's affray, but those
I who have watched the progress of the
Card freshmen, and more particularly
I
those who saw last Saturday's game are
not worrying over that chance too much.
Babes Improved
Two weeks ago one would have grant
ed the freshmen little more than an out
side chance to win. The St. Mary's con
test, however, put somewhat of a differ
ent light 011 the matter, and a real
football battle may be expected.
Because the two elevens have not met
j any teams in common, it is difficult to
i do much accurate guessing as to the out
-1 come of the game. The Southern Cali
-1 fornians have come through the season
j to date without a defeat, but the strength
I of the outfits they met is an unknown
quantity. Stanford's 1931 squad has been
! humbled twice. Both of their defeats,
! however, came under rather extenuating
| circumstances.
Lineup Announced
| Who will start against the Trojans has
! not been announced. It will not be
known, probably, until the teams take
the field. If Hunt continues his usual
( practice it is likely that a large number
of players will get into the game.
The men who will make the trip are
as follows: Reynolds, Craig, Bigelow,
; Mears, Albertson, Green, Heiser, Miller,
Dohrman, Bogue, Haight, Tampke, Win
neck, Saunders, Gatzent, Moffat, Hardy,
Dawson, Human, Cook, Caglieri, and
Pike. Junior Managers Nichell and Long
will accompany the squad.
