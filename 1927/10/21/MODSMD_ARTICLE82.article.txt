# PENNSYLVANIA STORM NETS MILLION DAMAGE
## 
### 
HARRISBURG, Pa., Oct. 20.â€”Penn
sylvania's flood damage passed well over
the million dollar mark as new evils of
suffering, disease and unemployment fob1
lowed the state's worst fall (inundation)
Thursday.
Over a wide area in the Harrisburg,
Pittsburgh, Wilkes-Barre and Shamo
kin districts, swollen waters from the
fall rains made thousands homeless,
10,(XX) men idle and took a toll of at
least three lives.
Hundreds of highways in the flood
section were turned into raging canals,
creeks overflowed their banks and the
waters poured into cities and towns,
flooding cellars and tying up traffic.
Seventy-Eight Hour Fall
Continuous rain fell for 78 hours. Here
the Susquehanna reached a stage of 1-
feet 6 inches and was still rising. At (
Johnston trolley service was paralyzed j
by llood water, and Connellsville, 1'Iiila- j
delphia and other points had tlieir share j
of suffering. I
Two railroad employes were kdled :
when an engine ran into a washout near
Hallstead, and at Sayre, a man was
drowned when a bridge over a swollen
creek collapsed with the weight of his
car.
As the torrents made the Wilkes-
Barre section an inland sea, hundreds of
families fled their homes to dry ground
and were marooned in the bottom lands
of the Susquehanna.
Highways, Homes Ruined
Highways and residences around
Scranton were ruined by the waters and
the lowlands were washed out and badly
damaged.
Anthracite coal mines were given new
grief by the overflow. Already suffering
from an industrial slump, many mines
were flooded and face suspension of
work.
Accompanying the floods near Union
town, snow clogged traffic arteries.
Along the Delaware river, seven feet j
of water covers the main highway in j
spots, and it is impassable at Point j
Pleasant Brockenburg and Yardley.
