### 
PARIS, Oct. 20.—An academic and i
sometimes acrimonious discussion of j
why Samuel Schwartzbard killed Gen- j
eral Simon Petlura marked the third day j
of the trial of the 33-year-old Jewish I
watchmaker.

H. Campinchi, attorney for the anti
red general's family, tried to prove
Schwartzbard was a Bolshevik agent who
killed Petlura, not to avenge pogroms
in the Ukraine which brought death to
thousands of Jews, but because Petlura
was an Anti-Bolshevik.
M. Henri Torres, attorney for the de
fense, read extracts from the Ukrainian
newspaper "Trident," published in Paris,
which he said gave Schwartzbard the
inspiration to murder. The abstracts
were highly anti-semitic in character.
