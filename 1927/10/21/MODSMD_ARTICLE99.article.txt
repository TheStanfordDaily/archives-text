# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Among the many star players who
will he seen in action on the various
gridirons of the country tomorrow,
none will he watched with greater
interest than Benny Oosterhaan,
Michigan's end and captain, who will
try to lead his team to a victory over
the Ann Arbor institution's arch-rival,
Ohio State. Ttiis game, always one
of the feature events of the Western
Conference season, will be played in
the beautiful new stadium at Ann
Arbor. Last year, as you no doubt re
member, Michigan won this game by
the margin of one point, and no one
of the 90,000 who saw that 17 to 1G
thriller 'will ever forget it.
Benny Oosterhaan started in that
contest, as usual, and in the second
Minnesota game a week later, it was
his alertness in scooping up a fumble
by Nydahl that brought about the de
feat of "Fat" Spears's fine team by
the score of 7 to 6. Big Ben is a great
basketball player, and this no doubt
has helped him to snare forward
passes with one or both hands with
considerable ease and abandon. He is
fast and spectacular, and as captain
of his team, should have the best sea
son of his career this fall.
But the Michigan-Ohio State game
is not the only big game scheduled
for tomorrow. Not by a "Little Brown

Jug"-ful! Cast your glittering eye
down the list of sparkling contests
and you'll find that October 22 is foot
ball's biggest day so far this fall. If
offered two seats on the fifty-yard line
for any one game tomorrow, a real
fan would go all to pieces like the
; chameleon on the patchwork quilt, for
lack of being able to decide on one of
the many interesting games. The an
nual Yale-Army spectacle is probably
the juiciest morsel of all in the East,
with Princeton-Cornell and Harvard-
Dartmouth close behind in interest.
Out in Chicago they are putting on
I one of the big intersectional games
J of the year between Penn and Stagg's
i boys, while in the South the Alabama
| Sewanee game stands out as the best
! bet.
