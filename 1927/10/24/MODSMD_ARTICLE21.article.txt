## Both Touchdowns Scored on Passes From Taylor; May Plays Well 
### Bob Speers 
While the biggest portion of Stan
ford fandom was enjoying the Cardi
nal victory over O.A.C. via radio Sat
urday, Hal Davis' Gray eleven was
making hay in the stadium with the
St. Mary's reserves, beating the Oak
landers 12 to 2. •
The game was no set-up in spite
of the fact that the first quarter was
Stanford's by a wide margin. The
Saints presented a tough defense, and
showed some flashes of good ball
carrying, but the local eleven was
consistently better in all-around foot
ball.
Score on Passes
Both of Stanford's touchdowns were
made on passes from Taylor. May
grabbed a toss at his own thirty-yard
line in the first period, and raced
across for a tally. In the third quarter
Taylor heaved the ball thirty yards to
Rehrig who caught it behind St.
Mary's goal. St. Mary's scored a safety
in the first period when a Stanford
man was tackled behind the line after
scooping up his own team's fumble.
The Redshirts plowed through the
visitors brilliantly during the first
part of that initial period and should
have registered more than once if {
superior work went with a large score. |
But the Saints steadied their playing, I
and held the Goofs in check until the !
third quarter when they again kept
(he oval in the visitors' territory.
Penalties Frequent
Several portions of the clash de
veloped into holding contests, with 1
Stanford winning by a scant margin. '
Fifteen-yard penalties were the order i
of the day, and the referee dispensed i
them freely.
The Gray interference worked beau- ;
tifully. May's long dash for a score j
was made only with the help of hard
clipping on the part fo his teammates.
May Spectacular
May played a spectacular game. He !
received passes, hit the line, and
skirted ends with speed and power. <
McCone was the outstanding defen
sive back. He is a vicious tackier, and
almost invariably got his man. The
Stanford line played a steady game. 1
The kicking and passing of Stennett, 1
St. Mary's full, was one of the fea
tures of the day. He placed his long !
boots with uncanny accuracy, and '
caused the locals plenty of trouble |
stopping his aerial attack.
The Grays are the first Stanford
team to beat St. Mary's this year. The
game established the fact that they !
will be a dangerous outfit when they j
meet the University of California.

The Gray interference worked beau- ;
tifully. May's long dash for a score j
was made only with the help of hard
clipping on the part fo his teammates.
May Spectacular
May played a spectacular game. He !
received passes, hit the line, and
skirted ends with speed and power. <
McCone was the outstanding defen
sive back. He is a vicious tackier, and
almost invariably got his man. The
Stanford line played a steady game. 1
The kicking and passing of Stennett, 1
St. Mary's full, was one of the fea
tures of the day. He placed his long !
boots with uncanny accuracy, and '
caused the locals plenty of trouble |
stopping his aerial attack.
The Grays are the first Stanford
team to beat St. Mary's this year. The
game established the fact that they !
will be a dangerous outfit when they j
meet the University of California.
While the biggest portion of Stan
ford fandom was enjoying the Cardi
nal victory over O.A.C. via radio Sat
urday, Hal Davis' Gray eleven was
making hay in the stadium with the
St. Mary's reserves, beating the Oak
landers 12 to 2. •
The game was no set-up in spite
of the fact that the first quarter was
Stanford's by a wide margin. The
Saints presented a tough defense, and
showed some flashes of good ball
carrying, but the local eleven was
consistently better in all-around foot
ball.
Score on Passes
Both of Stanford's touchdowns were
made on passes from Taylor. May
grabbed a toss at his own thirty-yard
line in the first period, and raced
across for a tally. In the third quarter
Taylor heaved the ball thirty yards to
Rehrig who caught it behind St.
Mary's goal. St. Mary's scored a safety
in the first period when a Stanford
man was tackled behind the line after
scooping up his own team's fumble.
The Redshirts plowed through the
visitors brilliantly during the first
part of that initial period and should
have registered more than once if {
superior work went with a large score. |
But the Saints steadied their playing, I
and held the Goofs in check until the !
third quarter when they again kept
(he oval in the visitors' territory.
Penalties Frequent
Several portions of the clash de
veloped into holding contests, with 1
Stanford winning by a scant margin. '
Fifteen-yard penalties were the order i
of the day, and the referee dispensed i
them freely.
