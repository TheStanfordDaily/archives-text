# BIFF HOFFMAN STAR AS CARDS TROUNCE O.A.C.
## Stanford Threatens Oregon Goal Five Times, Makes Three Touchdowns AGGIE PASSES STOPPED Orange Defense Dizzy With Versatile Tactics Used By Redshirt Team

Biff Hoffman came into his own
Saturday as Stanford sent O.A.C.'s
championship hopes tumbling with a
20 to G trouncing in the Multnomah
Stadium at Portland. For almost half
the season Biff looked like a second
rate fullback. Against U.S.C. he began
to get back into form, but the Aggies
felt the full effect of his power.
Stanford made five drives toward
their goal, and on three of them made
touchdowns. Hoffman, with the aid of
Hill and Wilton, crashed and passed
into the Aggie line until the Orange
defense was dizzy with the versatile
Cardinal attack. On defense, the Stan
ford line was top-form brick wall. The
famed Aggie passing attack was en
tirely broken up, while runs and bucks
netted small yardage. Twice, with but
a few yards to a touchdown, the Ag
gies were held for four downs.
Straight Plays Score
Taking the ball on their own 40-
yard line, the Cardinals started out
on their first drive to a score. Hill,
who made himself a marked man after
his successful reverse plays, and Wil
ton, who was even better than against
the Trojans, took the ball on straight
plays down toward the first score.
Each time that the Aggie defense
stiffened, Hoffman was called in and
crashed through for about five yards.
Another kind of attack, with passes,
and long end runs, including a 20-
yard toss from Hoffman to Preston,
