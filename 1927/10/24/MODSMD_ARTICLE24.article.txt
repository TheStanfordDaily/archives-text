# BIFF HOFFMAN STAR AS CARDS TROUNCE O.A.C.
## Stanford Threatens Oregon Goal Five Times, Makes Three Touchdowns AGGIE PASSES STOPPED Orange Defense Dizzy With Versatile Tactics Used By Redshirt Team 
### Milton Silverman 
Biff Hoffman came into his own
Saturday as Stanford sent O.A.C.'s
championship hopes tumbling with a
20 to G trouncing in the Multnomah
Stadium at Portland. For almost half
the season Biff looked like a second
rate fullback. Against U.S.C. he began
to get back into form, but the Aggies
felt the full effect of his power.
Stanford made five drives toward
their goal, and on three of them made
touchdowns. Hoffman, with the aid of
Hill and Wilton, crashed and passed
into the Aggie line until the Orange
defense was dizzy with the versatile
Cardinal attack. On defense, the Stan
ford line was top-form brick wall. The
famed Aggie passing attack was en
tirely broken up, while runs and bucks
netted small yardage. Twice, with but
a few yards to a touchdown, the Ag
gies were held for four downs.
Straight Plays Score
Taking the ball on their own 40-
yard line, the Cardinals started out
on their first drive to a score. Hill,
who made himself a marked man after
his successful reverse plays, and Wil
ton, who was even better than against
the Trojans, took the ball on straight
plays down toward the first score.
Each time that the Aggie defense
stiffened, Hoffman was called in and
crashed through for about five yards.
Another kind of attack, with passes,
and long end runs, including a 20-
yard toss from Hoffman to Preston,
brought the second score to Stanford
in the second quarter. Hill counted
for the touchdown on a 14-yard run
around right end.
Maple Elusive
Howard Maple, Aggie quarter,
played the part of Morley Drury for
the benefit of the Northerners. He
was the only one who eould get
through the line, or around the end,
or, at the end of the game, under the
passes. Post and Robesky outshone
McCreery, Sellman, and Freeman in
stopping the elusive Orangeman, but
at times even they could not hold on
to him. Maple did most of his damage
in running back kicks and kick-offs
behind a wedge-shaped interference.
Late in the third quarter Stanford
got under way again when Hyland
ran sixteen yards after intercepting
Maple's pass. Sims and Hoffman alter
nated in messing up the Aggies, and
went over for the last Redshirt touch
down. Hoffman converted for the sec
ond time.
Aggies Come Back
Attempting a last-minute comeback,
the Aggies took the ball on their own
35-yard line and completed three
passes for a gain of over fifty yards.
The next pass was incomplete over
the goal line, but Referee Bob Evans
gave the Aggies the ball on the five
yard line because of Stanford's inter
ference. Again the ball sailed over the
line and was dropped by an Aggie
end. This time the ball went out to
the twenty-yard line.
A Stanford fumble again proved
costly, and an Orangeman grabbed
| the ball, carrying it to the two-yard
line before he was stopped. Previous
attempts on the Carlinal line had
proved fruitless, and the Aggies' first
play, a pass over the line, was com
pleted to save the Northerners from
a whitewash. 1
