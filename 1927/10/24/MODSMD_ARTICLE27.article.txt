is the time, in the middle of the gridiron season, when more or
less rightfully interested football fans begin talk of East-West games.
Stanford has thus far figured in two such agitations: one being a pro
posed game with the Navy; another, more recent, being in talk of a clash
with the Army. Discussion of the first was given color by the fact that
Secretary of the Navy Wilbur and President Wilbur are brothers.
Secondly, for no apparent reason, Senator Hiram Johnson telegraphed
President Coolidge to "use his influence to obtain a football game between
the Army and Stanford."
In both cases General Manager A1 Masters has stood pat with state
ments to the effect that no authoritative information relative of such
games has been received at his office. A1 has the right idea. If such a
game as one of these is to be arranged he or the proper authorities at one
of the academies should start the ball rolling. It is nice of sports editors
and senators to have such a paternal interest in collegiate competition,
but shouldn't the colleges with their teams be the ones to propose or
dispose as they choose?
pUP)LIC interest in post-season games year after year can wane. College
interest in football, after being sustained during a two- or three
month period of regular football competition, invariably slumps after the
natural climax of each institution's big game in the middle of November,
It is upon the public, then, that seat sales for such intersectional games
largely depend. Furthermore, few students of the visiting university
can find it possible to travel the enormous distances necessary to see
such games.
Continually scheduling of post-season games, to our mind, leads to a
semi-commercializing of what is essentially a college sport. The argu
ment may be here advanced that early-season games with their de
pendence upon open seat sales do not differ greatly in principle, then,
from post-season games which also depend upon the dear public. True,
but there is no need of keeping two football squads in training a month
longer merely to provide an afternoon's amusement for 70,000 good
average citizens of Los Angeles or San Francisco. They can get their
amusement during the early-season games and go to the movies on
Christmas or New Year's Day.
Post-season games should be events of major interest and not annual
affairs. The teams which should be asked to contest under these condi
tions should be outstanding ones, as Michigan's "point-a-minute" team
of some years back or a team that has two All-American players and is
without question an eleven that warrants a place on football's roll of
honor. Such teams do not occur in pairs or even singly each year. It
would be difficult, for example, to name one outstanding team in the
country today.
STANFORD'S team of the present year is not of such calibre as to
warrant its playing a post-season game of such intersectional im
portance as a clash with the Navy or the Army would be. One loss and
one tied game are factors to be considered in judging the qualifications
of a team for such a contest. Furthermore, the men on the squad should
be given consideration before any steps whatsoever are taken.
"East is East and West is West" goes the threadbare phrase, and
we might add that never the twain should meet on the gridiron unless
the representatives are truly outstanding and paramount in their own
divisions of the nation. Then and only then will post-season and East-
West clashes be justifiably important. Wait until the occasion presents
itself in the form of two powerful teams, each worthy timber for that
mythical title of "national champions."

but there is no need of keeping two football squads in training a month
longer merely to provide an afternoon's amusement for 70,000 good
average citizens of Los Angeles or San Francisco. They can get their
amusement during the early-season games and go to the movies on
Christmas or New Year's Day.
Post-season games should be events of major interest and not annual
affairs. The teams which should be asked to contest under these condi
tions should be outstanding ones, as Michigan's "point-a-minute" team
of some years back or a team that has two All-American players and is
without question an eleven that warrants a place on football's roll of
honor. Such teams do not occur in pairs or even singly each year. It
would be difficult, for example, to name one outstanding team in the
country today.
STANFORD'S team of the present year is not of such calibre as to
warrant its playing a post-season game of such intersectional im
portance as a clash with the Navy or the Army would be. One loss and
one tied game are factors to be considered in judging the qualifications
of a team for such a contest. Furthermore, the men on the squad should
be given consideration before any steps whatsoever are taken.
"East is East and West is West" goes the threadbare phrase, and
we might add that never the twain should meet on the gridiron unless
the representatives are truly outstanding and paramount in their own
divisions of the nation. Then and only then will post-season and East-
West clashes be justifiably important. Wait until the occasion presents
itself in the form of two powerful teams, each worthy timber for that
mythical title of "national champions."
is the time, in the middle of the gridiron season, when more or
less rightfully interested football fans begin talk of East-West games.
Stanford has thus far figured in two such agitations: one being a pro
posed game with the Navy; another, more recent, being in talk of a clash
with the Army. Discussion of the first was given color by the fact that
Secretary of the Navy Wilbur and President Wilbur are brothers.
Secondly, for no apparent reason, Senator Hiram Johnson telegraphed
President Coolidge to "use his influence to obtain a football game between
the Army and Stanford."
In both cases General Manager A1 Masters has stood pat with state
ments to the effect that no authoritative information relative of such
games has been received at his office. A1 has the right idea. If such a
game as one of these is to be arranged he or the proper authorities at one
of the academies should start the ball rolling. It is nice of sports editors
and senators to have such a paternal interest in collegiate competition,
but shouldn't the colleges with their teams be the ones to propose or
dispose as they choose?
pUP)LIC interest in post-season games year after year can wane. College
interest in football, after being sustained during a two- or three
month period of regular football competition, invariably slumps after the
natural climax of each institution's big game in the middle of November,
It is upon the public, then, that seat sales for such intersectional games
largely depend. Furthermore, few students of the visiting university
can find it possible to travel the enormous distances necessary to see
such games.
Continually scheduling of post-season games, to our mind, leads to a
semi-commercializing of what is essentially a college sport. The argu
ment may be here advanced that early-season games with their de
pendence upon open seat sales do not differ greatly in principle, then,
from post-season games which also depend upon the dear public. True,
