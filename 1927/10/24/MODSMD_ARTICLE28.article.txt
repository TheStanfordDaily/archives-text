(Follozuing is an editorial written by Miss Jean Tolmie, editor of
"The Übyssey," University of British Columbia publication, in which is
summed up the work accomplished at the recent P.I.P.A. convention in
Vancouver, B.C. The editorial is peculiarly fitting since Miss Tolmie
acted as principal hostess to the delegates.)
The Press Conference —or at least the actual business part of it—is
over. The Übyssey has had the privilege of entertaining the delegates
for two days and the experience has been both delightful and profitable.
Both in business and in pleasure we have met these delegates from the
universities of the south and that contact has been stimulating—for us
at least. The exchange of ideas—not merely on the technical scale of
college publications, but in the more general aspects of student activities
—ought to be productive of fresh viewpoint in tackling problems in the
near future.
We cannot expect that the conference will effect a revolution in any
of the publications represented. One material advantage it had, however,
was that it brought forth for inspection and discussion many of the

problems which make editors and business managers turn gray before
their time.
The convention clearly emphasized the value of the P.I.P.A. as a
system for the exchange of college news, and the value of the items which
this university gets through the papers themselves. In addition the meet
ing decided that each college should make a selection of its news and
release a clip sheet to the other members twice a week. Each paper should
also organize a competent staff to rewrite and edit the items thus gath
ered. All this shows that 1927's P.I.P.A. conference is perfecting the
existing efficient organization.
In saying farewell, therefore, to our guests we have great hopes for
the future. We would like to feel, too, that this convention has been as
profitable and entertaining to them as it has to us. Suffice it to say that
at least we have now a much more vital interest in co-operation in jour
nalistic work and a consequently broader conception of the problems and
ideals of the other papers as a result of this personal meeting with the
editors and managers of the P.I.P.A.—The Übyssey.
