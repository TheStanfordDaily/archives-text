When one takes a flying trip, so to
speak, through British Columbia it is
somewhat ambitious to label a re
sum6 of topics current there as "Cana
dian" impressions. However, when
one's activities there centered about
the chief university in British Colum
bia and one had free converse with
professors and student leaders, a more
or less vivid cross section of life in
U.B.C. may be obtained.
Of chief interest to those collegians
south of the line is life of the college
students in Canada —always barring,
of course, the liquor problem which is
not so great in Canada as elsewhere.
One thing that struck us there was
the utmost freedom and comradeship
apparent in the "co-eds" (if that term
is used in U.8.C.). At the University
of British Columbia there are appar
ently no restrictions on the hours at
which women may come and go.
In personal conduct, too, at the
dances as elsewhere there is a most
refreshing atmosphere. We may be
biased because the members of a cer
tain sorority undertook the entertain
ing of the P.I.P.A. delegates, but they

| accomplished their task in a very
pleasing manner.
One thing that was observed in the
j student body at the University of Brit
ish Columbia was a distinct division
of opinion on the nature of the life
! to which U.B.C. students would be
j best adapted. Half seemed to favor
' the hurry and press characteristic of
j the American undergraduate life while
: the other half looked more to the Ox
onian and Etonian life as being more
suitable to their needs.
Such a division is only to be ex
pected when one considers the geo
graphical situation of Vancouver —
close enough to the border to permit
some degree of intimacy with Ameri
cans and their ways, yet British
enough in population to look to rner
rie old England for leadership.
The University of British Columbia
i is but fourteen years old, though it
j boasts an enrollment of 1,600. It is
another "university of the future," but
{ unlike the others to which this phrase
i is often applied, it will grow solidly
I and substantially, British-like, but
| never lacking an attraction to these
i United States.

the utmost freedom and comradeship
apparent in the "co-eds" (if that term
is used in U.8.C.). At the University
of British Columbia there are appar
ently no restrictions on the hours at
which women may come and go.
In personal conduct, too, at the
dances as elsewhere there is a most
refreshing atmosphere. We may be
biased because the members of a cer
tain sorority undertook the entertain
ing of the P.I.P.A. delegates, but they

| accomplished their task in a very
pleasing manner.
One thing that was observed in the
j student body at the University of Brit
ish Columbia was a distinct division
of opinion on the nature of the life
! to which U.B.C. students would be
j best adapted. Half seemed to favor
' the hurry and press characteristic of
j the American undergraduate life while
: the other half looked more to the Ox
onian and Etonian life as being more
suitable to their needs.
Such a division is only to be ex
pected when one considers the geo
graphical situation of Vancouver —
close enough to the border to permit
some degree of intimacy with Ameri
cans and their ways, yet British
enough in population to look to rner
rie old England for leadership.
The University of British Columbia
i is but fourteen years old, though it
j boasts an enrollment of 1,600. It is
another "university of the future," but
{ unlike the others to which this phrase
i is often applied, it will grow solidly
I and substantially, British-like, but
| never lacking an attraction to these
i United States.
