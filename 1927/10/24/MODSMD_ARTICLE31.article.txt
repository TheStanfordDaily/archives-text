# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We note with sympathetic interest
your recent editorials regarding wom
en's athletics and other physical edu- j
cation activities, and are grateful, in j
general, for the interest the Stanford I
Daily is taking in women's activities, j
We prefer criticism to apathy, and it;
is very often helpful to see ourselves
as others see us. We have many burn
ing problems, two of which you have
touched upon. The matter of athletic j
outfit is constantly under considera- j
tion, the discussion of which appears j
in another column of the Daily. The '
matter of competition is also too com-1
plicated to handle in the "Campus j
Opinion" but suffice it to say the type I
of competition conducted by the
Women's Athletic Association is that
which has been their own choice.
Any change in this respect is subject
to the approval of that Board.
We will always be glad to answer i
any questions which you may care to |
ask. More serious than the questions j
of outfit and competition, at the pres
ent time, is the question of equipment.
Why is it that the women must con
tinue to use a frame shack which was
built in the first years of the Uni
versity—must play on tennis courts
the roughness of which makes accu
rate play impossible and which fre
quently raises blisters on the soles of
the player's feet —and must run over :
stubble ground to get to inadequate !
athletic fields? We note with pride ■
the magnificent plant provided for
men's athletics and other physical
education activities. We are glad that j
they have that which is worthy of

Stanford, but is it not time now that
equally adequate equipment should be
provided for the women? If you will
help us to answer this question we
will be deeply grateful.
