# AND Then Our a Little SALLY---

I thing that college girls should
take courses that really make them
think about things that are important
for every-day life. I mean a girl never
really knows when she is going to
meet some interesting man that she
would like to have interested in her.
And philosophy professors are per
fectly wonderful for that, don't you
know. I mean, they make their lec
tures so hard to follow. But they do
talk about such abstract things like
dual personality. The fascinating
thing is that it is usually blonde and
brunette. But I really don't under
stand how they stick so long. I mean
when two people live on the same
campus, all the interesting topics are
so quickly exhausted.
But I told the boy next to me that
I thought a man should fall in love
when he is in college because it
really helps his appearance a lot. But
college men never pay attention to a
course, they just sit and write their
names all over their textbooks, and a
girl gets awfully bored.
I was simply furious, too, because
he said that he would never take out
a campus woman because lockout

rules were too early. Why the very
idea! I don't think that is really the
reason at all, I mean to say, they like
to take girls out who are a little dumb
so that they can boast about being in
a university.
