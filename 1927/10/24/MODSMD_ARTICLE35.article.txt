The whole bay region north of
San Jose already is getting up
steam over the California-U.S.C.
game in the Los Angeles Coliseum
next Saturday. A good share of
the "loyal Californians" we hear
of in the song will start rolling
southward Thursday, along with
a number of others who wave
pom-poms of a different color from
the widely known blue and gold.
Chances of the Bears' bringing
home the honey are undoubtedly
strong. A team against which only
six points have been scored in the
course of five games has to be
carefully reckoned with.
If California only wins, then
the stage will be set for what
Christopher Marlowe would have
designated as a blood-and-thunder
melodrama when what will not
inaccurately be known as the Big
Game takes place.
