George Bogue, one of the most
useful men Pop Warner ever had
in a Cardinal backfleld, scampered
about the Memorial Stadium last
Saturday under an O.C. jersey,
somewhat in his old-time manner,
and was the one who tackled the
speedy Marcus after the latter had
run half the length of the field to
the five-yard line.
When asked how California
compares with Stanford, Bogue
replied, with a world of meaning,
"Very favorably."
