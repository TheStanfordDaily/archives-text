# Change In Women's Gymnasium Suits Must Come Slowly, Says Miss Bunting, Athletic Manager
## 
### Margaret Cummings 
"We can't go faster than public
opinion. It is better to err on the side
of being over-conservative than to
lake a step which would bring upon
us adverse criticism," said Helen
Masters Bunting, director of Roble
Gymnasium, in commenting upon the
editorial suggestion in the Daily that
the present women's gym suits be
abolished in favor of a costume simi
lar to that worn by the men.
"If track shorts were adopted as
part of the women's suits the criticism
from the Stanford Mothers and from
the outside would be great," she con
tinued. "We must be careful not to
do anything which the papers could
play up in a spectacular manner.
Evolution in Process
"Last year the question of a change
in the present costume was discussed
and is again under advisement by the
Women's Athletic Board and by the
women themselves. Wo realize that
the suit now worn is uot entirely
satisfactory, and is in the process of
evolution. This is our third try during
the past eight years, and is an admit
ted improvement upon the first two."
Miss Bunting described the first
suit as having been large woolen
bloomers with white long-sleeved mid
dies, which was abandoned because it
was too cumbersome; and the second

| p.s tho English hockey costume witji
white blouse, black wool bloomers,
and a pleated iunic which hung from
shoulders to I.'. Objection to a
I three-piece ou;lit caus vl this t<3 be
1 discarded in favor of the present suit,
i Aniont tho points under considera
tion is that of rolling tho black gym
j stockings. "It is necessary to have
I the costumes uniform in all respects,
and so either all must roll, or none,
j and we are reluctant to force any
woman to roll her stockings if she
does not wish to do so," Miss Bunting
said.
Women Decide
J "In every case," she continued, "the
j women themselves, through the
j W.A.A. and Women's Athletic Board,
j have designed and approved the cos
j tuines. The next step, I am sure, will
lie a three-piece suit, probably bloom
ers, blouse, and sleeveless jersey, such
as are worn in most of the eastern
schools."
