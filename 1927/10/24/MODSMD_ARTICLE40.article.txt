# FOOTBALL'S BEST ALL-TIME PLAYER
## 
### Feg Murray 
That there never has been a better
all-round football player than Jim
Thorpe seems to be the consensus
among the football coaches, old-time
stars, and writers who have covered
the game from the days of the flying
wedge down to the present time. They
claim that "Big Jim" was superior to j
Coy, Mahan, Eckersall, Heston, and ,
Grange because he could do every- [
thing on the gridiron well, which in
cludes carrying the ball through the
line, around the ends, in a broken
field, interfering, punting, place-kick
ing, drop-kicking, passing and receiv
ing passes, tackling, backing up the
line, diagnosing opposing plays, and j

exercising brilliant judgment in tne
way of generalship on both attack
and defense.
Many a would-be tackier from Har
vard, Penn, Army, or some other east
ern university who found himself grov
eling in the dirt being evaded
by or trampled on by the speedy Car
, lisle halfback, did not realize the
j background behind Thorpe's powerful
physique, quick brain, and daring
aggressive tactics. James Francis
Thorpe was born in Oklahoma on May
2S, 1886, and was a direct descendant
of Black Hawk, that famous Sac and
Fox chief whose deeds of valor form
J such an interesting chapter in Ameri

can history. I
Naturally a life on the prairies of j
Oklahoma developed young Thorpe
into a fine specimen of manhood. Jim !
was just a natural born athlete, good ,
at any sport almost the first time he j
tried it, and it is no wonder that he
became a star, when he went to the
j Carlisle Indian school, in football,
j baseball, lacrosse, hockey, track, and
basketball.
Under Pop Warner's able tutelage
he developed into the greatest foot
ball player of all time, and his suc
! cess in track was just as pronounced.
After winning the Decathlon and Pen
j tathlon at the 1912 Olympic games in j

Stockholm, he calmly informed an
emissary of the King of Sweden, who
had come to his tent to get him, that
he was too busy playing cards just
then to go to see His Majesty, but
that he might on the morrow, if he
felt like it!
Thorpe's declaration in 1913 that he
had played semi-pro baseball in the
summers of 1909 and 1910, not know
ing that it was wrong, exploded a
bomb-shell in the ranks of amateur
athletics. His Olympic prizes were re
turned, and he rejected numerous
vaudeville offers to begin a long and
successful career as a professional
athlete.

Thorpe seems to be the consensus

stars, and writers who have covered
the game from the days of the flying

Naturally a life on the prairies of j
Oklahoma developed young Thorpe
into a fine specimen of manhood. Jim !
was just a natural born athlete, good ,
at any sport almost the first time he j
tried it, and it is no wonder that he
became a star, when he went to the
j Carlisle Indian school, in football,
j baseball, lacrosse, hockey, track, and
basketball.
Under Pop Warner's able tutelage
he developed into the greatest foot
ball player of all time, and his suc

After winning the Decathlon and Pen
j tathlon at the 1912 Olympic games in j

Stockholm, he calmly informed an
emissary of the King of Sweden, who
had come to his tent to get him, that
he was too busy playing cards just
then to go to see His Majesty, but
that he might on the morrow, if he
felt like it!
Thorpe's declaration in 1913 that he
had played semi-pro baseball in the
summers of 1909 and 1910, not know
ing that it was wrong, exploded a
bomb-shell in the ranks of amateur
athletics. His Olympic prizes were re
turned, and he rejected numerous
vaudeville offers to begin a long and
successful career as a professional
athlete.
