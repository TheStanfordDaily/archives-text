# Use Tear Bombs to Disperse Georgia Tech Student Mob
## 
### 
ATLANTA, Ga. (1.P.). â€”Tear bombs
were necessary for the dispersing of
a mob of wildly cheering Georgia
Tech students who gathered in the
downtown section here recently to
let the world know that someone had
at last put the brakes on the Crim
son Tide from Alabama.
The undergraduates picked up help
less motor cars which attempted to
negotiate the crowd, turned them
around, and bounced them up and
down. Trolleys were pulled from the
wires, and a bread fight was staged in
the streets.
