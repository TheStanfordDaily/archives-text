# FRESHMEN DEFEATED BY STRONG SOUTHERN GRID TEAM, 22 TO 13
## 
### 
Seriously handicapped by injuries
to its star performers, Coach Husky
Hunt's freshman team fell before the
strong U.S.C. freshmen 22 to 13 in a
game that was featured by many
thrills and injuries galore. Pete
Heiser, newly elected captain of the
Card yearlings who has been the out
standing player in the line, and Phil
Moffat, star fullback, were both taken
out of the game after being hurt early
in the first quarter. Heiser suffered a
broken nose, while Moffat's dislocated
shoulder will keep him out of football
for at least a year.
Start Strong
Starting out in the first quarter
with a strong offense, the Stanford
men showed up better than their op
ponents, but with two strong men out
and a fumble turned into a touch
down by U.S.C., they could not keep
up with the fast-charging Southern
outfit. During the second quarter Stan
ford scored with a long run after a
pass to Tampeke. In the same session
a twenty-five-yard penalty for clipping
by a Stanford man was turned into
a touchdown by the young Trojans.
During the third quarter both teams
scored, Stanford again on a long run
by Tampeke after a pass. Tampeke
was the outstanding Stanford player,
catching four passes, two of which
netted touchdowns.
During the fourth quarter Hunt's
battered men hold off a fresh U.S.C.
team which looked about as good as
the first string. "They had the better
material, that's all," said Hunt, "and
as I said early in the season in re
gards to our prospectsâ€”the material
is simply not there."
Pete Heiser, who was elected cap
tain of the 1931 eleven just before the
team left for the South, is a graduate
of Los Angeles Polytechnic High
School, and lias been the mainstay of
the line at guard all season.
