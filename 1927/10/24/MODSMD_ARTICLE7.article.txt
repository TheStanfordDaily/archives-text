## 
### 
Playing a weak game during the
first half, the Babe soccer team lost
to the San Mateo Junior College men
by a 4-0 score in their first conference
game last Friday. The junior college
men made all four scores during the
first half, but were unable to get by
the first-year fullbacks and goal
keeper in the last.

their forward line. The forwards
seemed unable to get the ball within
scoring distance, and the few times
they did were unable to kick accu
rately. Defense was very strong and
the two fullbacks, Dalton and Burns,
and the goalkeeper, Wight, saved two
or three goals in the last half by their
quick work.
Following is the starting lineup:
outside left, Damato; inside left,
Eberhart; center forward, Nichols;
