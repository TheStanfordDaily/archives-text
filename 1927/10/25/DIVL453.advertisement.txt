"Rubber
Stamped?"
SO MUCH of the present
day clothes for younger
men seem to have been
rolled out under the same
factory formula...
A FINE balance between
the "rubber stamped" and
the novelty styles, has ever
distinguished the Phelps-
Terkel clothes
OUT OF our experience in
outfitting men at college,
we have developed a more
distinctive type of clothes:
correct of fit, individual of
style and exclusive in
fabrics
Suits $45 and more
Topcoats $35 and more
