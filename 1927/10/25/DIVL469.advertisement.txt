' Your favorites in the greatest
romance of their screen careers
—Ronald Colman and Vilma
Hanky in—
j "THE MAGIC FLAME"
Adapted from the stage play,
"King Harlequin," by Rudolf
Lothar. The New York World
1 says: "One of the loveliest, most
brilliant pieces of dramatizing
to leave Hollywood in a year.
Moving, exciting, from the very
start. Human, and grasps the
interest."
