# FLEISHHACKER, JOSEPHS SHOW DRIVING POWER
## Speedy Attack, Built Around Hill, Wilton, Perfected For Webfooters VARSITY ENJOYS REST Worden Gets Around Ends for Sensational Tackles; Patchett Strong 
### Milton Silverman 
Taking no chances on a let-down in
the Stanford team, Coach Pop Warner
gave the first string a rest yesterday,
while he sent the second and third
elevens into a scrimmage that gave
all the boys considerable exercise.
Fleishhacker and Patchett did most
of the heavy work for the seconds,
with Frentrup slashing off occasional
gains through the line, while Josephs
was usually given the summons by
the third-string quarter.
Fleishhacker had his usually strenu
ous workout, carrying six or seven
linesmen around on his back on most
of the plays. On the line, Hulen and
Heinecke did considerable damage,
with Dick Worden dashing around the
end to make some sensational tackles.
He will have to do some strong play
ing in the next few days, for Spud
Harder, back in a suit and with a jaw
that looks solid as cement, is aching
to see his name in the lineup.
Oregon Tough
In spite of the criticism aimed at
the Webfoot coaches and players, the
Oregon eleven still remains a tough
barrier for the Cardinals. California,
who had been smashing up all the
local teams with topheavy scores, was
Tield to a 16-0 victory. At that, only
one of the touchdowns was earned.
Coach McEwan has been carefully
guarding against injuries, and will
send in a team unhampered by
cracked noses and corkscrew verte
braes. The lateral and forward passes,
as well as the deceptive running at
tack, that were used against the
Bears.with little success, have been
worked up during the past two weeks,
until the Webfooters are under the
impression that they will have a fast
offense to serve the Cards. Stanford,
incidentally, has also been working up
on this passing and running business,
and also believes that Oregon will
bow down before a superior speed
attack.
Fast Men Develop
Warner will have two men, Sims
and Hill, ready by next week to play
leal football. In the IT.S.C. game both
of these men tried their flashiness to
little avail, but against O.A.C. they
ran off their reverses and end runs to
perfection.
