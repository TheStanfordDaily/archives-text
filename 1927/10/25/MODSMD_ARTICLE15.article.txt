# FRIDAY SET AS LAST DATE FOR TAKING OF SENIOR PHOTOGRAPHS
## 
### 
Friday of this week has been set as
the deadline for the taking of senior
pictures, Mac Lewis, manager of the
Quad, announced last night. Nearly
500 have had their pictures taken or
reserved their places in the senior
section.
As the section is limited to some
550 pictures, it is imperative that
those seniors who desire to be in the
section and have not as yet made ar
rangements, do so immediately. The
hooks and reservations may both be
procured in the Quad office in the
Old Union.
The photographers have made a
record in the past two weeks by pho
tographing almost 600 individual pic
tures.
