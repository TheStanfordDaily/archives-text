# Gigantic Tremor On Pacific Coast Baffles Savants
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 24â€”The
Pacific Coast and the islands of the
Pacific were breathing easier tonight
after a (lay of anxious waiting for a
possible tidal wave following a severe
earthquake shock which occurred
somewhere in the west half of the
North American continent or some
where on the floor of the Pacific.
Scientists Search
Throughout one-fourth of the sur
face of the globe in which the conti
nent. of North America is the most
conspicuous object, scientists experi
enced grave apprehension all day
while they searched for the greatest
"lost" earthquake in a quarter of a
century.
They knew only that somewhere in
or near the United States about noon
Eastern Standard time, the earth's
crust buckled and crumpled on a scale
so vast as to defy the imagination.
Gigantic Waves Travel
The convulsion sent out tremors
that rippled through the rocky ribs
of the continent as if its limestone
and granite under structure had been
water. The waves startled seismo
graph observers in Nova Scotia and
electrified with apprehension a watch
er in the Hawaiian Islands. They
jarred the recording pins from the
sockets of instruments in Denver,
Colo., and in New Haven, Conn.
Had the cataclysm occurred be
neath a densely populated region it
would have been one of the great
disasters of history. Instead, the con
vulsion seemingly took place where
only forests could be toppled over, or
where the waters of an ocean roared
unseen in a suddenly yawning crevice
far below the surface.
On this latter theory all ships in
mid-Pacific were warned by a navy
radio broadcast to prepare for a tidal
wave expected to reach the Hawaiian
Islands about 2 p.m.
Relief as 2 O'clock Passes
When that hour had passed without
developments it was felt in Honolulu
that there was no further cause for
alarm.
Other guesses from scientists all
over the continent placed its probable
location in Mexico, or Central or
South America, or in the Pacific near
these places.
The chief point of agreement was
that the shock was of "tremendous
intensity."
