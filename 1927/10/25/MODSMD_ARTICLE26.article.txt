# SKETCHES SHOWN IN HOOVER WAR LIBRARY
## 
### 
Sketches of life in a British prison
camp by a German officer, Genre:
Philipp Worlen, are on exhibit in the
Hoover War Library. This camp was
for German officers at Ripon-York
sliire, England, and contained about
a thousand prisoners.
It was one of the last English camps
to break up; many of the prisoners
were not released until December
1919.
Boredom is suggested throughout
the collection, and the craving for
reading matter appears in several pic
tares. The landscapes and quarters
are bare and bleak .The artist creates
his effects with angular lines and
broken outlines.
