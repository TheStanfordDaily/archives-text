Coincident with the recent expression of some students' desire to have
Judge Lindsey on the campus as a speaker the following - notification was
received yesterday by various organization heads. The announcement is
intended as an explanation of the general University policy in matters
pertaining to the procuring of speakers:
There seems to be some confusion as to the relationship of
student organizations to meetings of a public character held in
University buildings. Tlie attitude of the University in its Founding
Grant and by actions of the Board of Trustees towards partisan,
political, and religious discussions includes all of the assembly halls,
buildings, and grounds of the institution.
Kindly note the following:
Student organizations, approved by the President, are free upon
proper arrangement to use the University buildings for their own
meetings. Whenever these meetings are open to the public, approval
should be sought of the Committee on Public which is
charged, under the Articles of Organization of the Faculty, with
responsibility for all public exercises held at the University. Permis
sion, therefore, must be secured from the Committee on Public Exer
cises when meetings are held in the Union, Women's Clubhouse, or
elsewhere, when meetings are of a public character.
Invitations to individuals not connected with the University to
speak or perform at any University function, social or otherwise,
can only lie extended by the President or the Committee on Public
Exercises. This does not refer to simple invitations to attend meet
ings or functions.
The endeavor of the University is to have free discussion in
student organizations and among groups of students, but it is im
portant that such discussions be representative of all sides and that
they be not in any way identified, even by until inking outsiders, with
the name of the University. Controversial subjects of all sorts* are
naturally considered in classroom work and in research activities.
When topics of this sort are presented by the Committee on Public
Exercises it tries to see that proper representation of all important
phases of the subject is given.
In general, it will be the policy of the University not to permit
student organizations to invite outside individuals to give addresses
to which the public is invited. The Committee on Public Exercises
is authorized to exercise this function for the University.
Dated October 20, 1927. RAY LYMAN WILBUR, President. â€¢
