# Why Have Classes?

### 
The gradual breakdown of college classes has, perhaps, never been
more clearly shown than is the case at Stanford. Many things, including
the introduction of the quarter system have been at work to bring this
about. As it seems now the chief significance of being a member of the
Class of '26, '27, or any of the others is that Jack McDowell may place
that figure after one's name 011 the alumni register.
Each winter and spring quarter new students enter the University
and these are at a loss to determine exactly what class number designa
tion they are entitled to. And after they have determined this bit of
information, little use is made of the knowledge. Consider, for example,
the average attendance at class meetings called by presidents elected at
regular Quad elections. Less than half of the total votes cast in a Quad
election are represented at a meeting called by an officer so elected.
Few distinctions remain between the classes: upperclasstnen wear
•corduroys and seniors have the right to wear sombreros. (But who
wears 'em?) One or two freshman classes have tried to introduce a
tradition of wearing blue denims but no class has been able to get this
through by vote. Furthermore, if one did, why couldn't the next clnss,
by similar vote, set such a rule to naught? The whole thing is in a
frightful mess.
