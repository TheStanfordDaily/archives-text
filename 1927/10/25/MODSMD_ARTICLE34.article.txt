The Editor, Sir:
I
Good for Miss Bunting! That's what
I call keeping one's eye on the ball.
These discussions about girls' gym
suits are doubtless very interesting.
And I must admit that I can see no
obvious reason for not rolling one's
socks. (I feel quite strongly on this
jioint, as I have already mutilated llie
knees of one pair, while enjoying that
gentle little s.Trrt known as hockey).
But I can also sympathize with the
Department as regards the proposed
suit. Can't you just imaging what
mama would say? Of course, she
needs education —but use discretion.
(Please don't misunderstand me. Per
sonally, I own and operate one of
(hose unladylike outfits, on every pos
sible occasion).
As I have said, this topic is very
intriguing, and is undoubtedly more
appealing than the prosaic question of
a building for women. But facts are
facts, and we most, certainly need

that building. Think it over once, and
then just tell me we don't!
And why, in the name of justice,
don't we get it? Take a look, once,
at the beautiful women's gym our
friendly enemy in Berkeley has. Or
notice the gyms that high schools
give their students —high schools with
no more students than Stanford has
girls. We may be a very dumb "500,"
but 1 should think that just for the
benefit of the public, you would want
us to look our best.
If Stanford were stricken with pov
erty, why we would reconcile our
selves and be very properly sympa
thetic. But doggone it! Haven't they
just been building a hundred thou
sand dollars' worth of rooms for the
men? But I'd better not pursue that
point, or I will have hysterics.
The point is:—the women need a
new gym, urgently. The University
has the money. Mr. Editor, won't you
please try to find which pocket it's in?
—M.H., '30.
