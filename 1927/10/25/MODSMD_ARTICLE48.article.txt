# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Chick Meehan, the mentor of those i
blushing Violets of the metropolis,
New York University's football team,
is now face to face with the hard part
of a football schedule. Next Saturday,
at the Yankee Stadium, Chick's pro
ttfg<ss undertake to defeat Colgate; on I
the following Saturday, N.Y.U. takes
on Carnegie Tech; and on November i
12, the violet-liued centaurs journey j
to State College, Pennsylvania, to bat- i
tie Hugo Bezdek's Nittany Lions. On
November 19, Allegheny is entertained :
in New York, and then follows the
piece de resistance of this whole i
menu, the annual journey to Lincoln, I
Nebraska, to scrap it out with Ernest
Bearg's big Cornliuskers. Quite dif- j
ferent from the first half of the sched-!
ule —eh, Chick?
Chick Meehan, as nearly every one i
knows, made quite a name for him
self as coach at Syracuse University. ;
In the last two years he gave new life
to New York University's football I
hopes, developed a great backfleld
quartet in Connors, Briante, Strong, i
and Roberts, and brought the modest i
Violets through the 192G season with
only one defeat, and that at the hands j
ot the strong Nebraska team and in a I
blizzard at Lincoln, too. N.Y.U. de- j
feated Carnegie Tech, 6 to 0, and |
what Tech did to Notre Dame later !
on in the season is still being talked |

about.
Football, for Meelian, is a sport;
not work or a business. He wants his
boys to enjoy the practice sessions, to
have fun in the games, and to get all
they can out of the season. Chick was
born at Shelburne Falls, Mass., and
learned his football under Buck O'-
Neill at the Salt City school, succeed
ing his tutor in 1920 when Buck moved
on to Columbia. Meehan shone at
quarterback as a player, and his qual
ities of leadership have greatly helped
him in his coaching duties.
