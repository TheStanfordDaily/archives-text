# Senior, Junior Interclass Gridders Play Saturday
## 
### 
Saturday morning the senior and
junior interclass football teams will
meet on the freshman field, probably
to determine tjie interclass champion
ship.
Although the freshmen and sopho
mores will meet at the same time on
the Goof field, neither is conceded
more than a mere chance to win over
the two upperclass aggregations. The
upper division and lower division
teams will meet each other during the
weeks following.
