# Davis To Follow Development of Ethical Concepts
## 
### 
Tracing the natural development of
goodness, and seeking to overcome
the objections formerly raised to the
theory of an evolutionary progression
of ethical characteristics is the pur
pose of Dr. William Morris Davis' lec
ture on"The Natural History of Good
ness or The Evolution of Ethical
Qualities" to be given at 7:30 o'clock
this evening in the Little Theatre.
This lecture involves a trespass
from his own department into the
realm of ethics, for Dr. Davis is an
expert in tlie field of physiographic
geology, and is conducting a class in
the subject here this quarter.
In dealing with the objections made
to the idea of the evolution of ethical
qualities, Dr. Davis will point out
that this is similar to the process of
gradual change involved in physical
evolution. He will illustrate his argu
ments by examples drawn from lower
animal life.
Dr. Davis declares of goodness, "It
is not an absolute finality. What is
considered goodness at different
stages of the development of civiliza
tion is man's opinion of the matter
at different times."
His lecture will touch the relation
of evil to goodness suggesting a na
tural origin of evil, simpler than that
proposed by philosophers, or by the
theologians who bring the devil into
their arguments.
