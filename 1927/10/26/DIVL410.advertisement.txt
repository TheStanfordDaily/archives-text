The Roos Football Special of last year proved such a
happy thought that tickets were sold out two weeks
ahead of the game. We again have obtained the co
operation of the Southern Pacific Company and have
chartered another Special for this year's Big Game.
Tickets will soon be as hard to get as tickets for the
Big Game. It must be a case of first come, first served,
but Roos Bros, specially invites college men and their
families to buy their tickets NOW.
