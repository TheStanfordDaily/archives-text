"There was a sound of
revelry by night." —LORD BYRON
Once upon a time an undergraduate came back
from his summer vacation, bought a case of
"Canada Dry" and to his friends said, "Come
around to my rooms, this evening. . .
"There was a sound of revelry by night," as
Lord Byron put it. And if you don't believe me,
look it up in some canto or other of Chilue 1 larold.
This is not a story of flaming youth. Or any
thing devilish.
But just tiiis: "Canada Dry" is the smoothest,
mellowest, most palatable ginger ale you've ever
tasted. It quenches your thirst. It has a distinc
tive flavor. It mixes well with other beverages.
It contains no capsicum (red pepper). And it is
really good for you.
