# ROOMS NEEDED FOR DELEGATES TO CONVENTION
## Students Leaving Campus For Week-End Asked To Sign List EXPECT 300 TO ATTEND High School Journalists of State Will Discuss Press Problems 
### 
More rooms to house visiting dele
gates to the California Interscholastic
Press Association meeting are needed,
states Lynn Bramkamp, chairman of
the housing committee of the conven
tion. Rooms will be used only Friday
night, since the visitors will leave the
â€¢campus Saturday. More than 300 are
expected to attend.
Campus residents who will be
away from their rooms Friday night,
are asked to donate their rooms
to the use of the convention. Anyone
who has not been approached by can
vassers is asked by the sponsors of
the convention to leave his name,
address, and telephone numbers at
the Stanford Daily office.
The delegates will arrive Friday
morning to attend the meeting, which
starts at noon of that day. The pro
gram for the convention has not yet
been decided upon, although it will
probably parallel last year's.
With 100 women and over 200 men
to be housed Friday, the Division of
Journalism and the housing commit
tee have asked all campus organiza
tions to co-operate and help relieve
the situation. This year more dele
gates than ever before are expected
to attend the convention.
