# GOOD, EVIL PART OF EVERYDAY
## 
### 
"Good and evil are not eternal veri
ties, but actual phenomena of every
day life, wholly subjective in their
nature. They vary with the preju
diced self-interest of those concerned
on (lie two sides on the problem of
existence, as they have always done,"
declared Dr. William Morris Davis in
his lecture upon "The Natural His
tory of Goodness" last night in the
Little Theatre.
"All that the word 'good' means as
inherited from our Anglo-Saxon an
cestors, is to characterize anything
satisfactory, as we still say we have
had 'a good dinner'," continued the
lecturer. "The gradual growth of the
word, especially in its substantive
form, goodness, has come to mean
more than something merely selfish
ly fitting."
In tracing the development of good
ness through the animal kingdom, Dr.
Davis chose illustrations of the often
time intelligent rather than instinc
tive protection of their young ani
mals and birds.
The history of man's ascent from a
primitive ethical code to his present
standards was drawn from the Old
and New Testaments. Increasing hu
manity in the laws given therein
shown this moral evolution, said the
speaker, and the New Testament in
particular, written at a later period,
represents a greater advance.
"We say that human nature doesn't
change. This cannot be true when we
remember the old law that whoever
witnessed a murder must raise an
immediate hue and cry and exact
prompt vengeance, and contrast this
with our present procedure. Human
nature does change, and for the bet
ter.
"The moral world is as little exempt
as the physical world from the law
of ceaselcss change, of perpetual
flux," added Dr. Davis. "We can no
more arrest the process of moral evo
lution than we can stay the sweep
of the tides or the course of the
stars."
