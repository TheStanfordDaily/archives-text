VIENNA, Oct. 25. â€”Evidence of re
pressed turmoil in Rumania seeped
through tlie censorship bound orders
of that country today.
W T liile the populace celebrated King
Michael's sixth birthday and the Boy
Ruler played with his toys, troops
marched through the streets of Bucha
rest to strengthen the guard around
all government buildings.
To Prevent Carol's Return
Soldiers marched to guard the fron
tier to prevent a possible attempt by
the exiled father of the King to re
turn to Rumania.
Several persons were arrested sus
pected of being allied with the alle'ged
plot to return Carol to the throne or
make him a power in the regency.
Added to the Government's prob
lems in Rumania's biggest crisis in
months was the grave illness of Alex
ander H. Vojvoda, an Opposition
party leader who has worked toward
reconciliation between his party and
the Government party. It was feared
his death would widen the breach be
tween the two parties.
Since noon, according to authentic
reports from Belgrade, telegraph and
telephone communication between
Bucharest and the Serbian capital has
been suspended. Before the communi
cations were suspended the United
Press received several uncensored dis
patches from Bucharest by way of
Belgrade.
