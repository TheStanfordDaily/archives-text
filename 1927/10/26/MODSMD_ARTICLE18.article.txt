# UPPER, LOWER CLASS SQUADS WILL MEET SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Two interclass football games are
scheduled for nine o'clock Saturday
morning. The seniors and juniors
will mix on the freshman field while
the sophomores and freshmen will
fight it out on the Grays' field. Both
games will probably decide the inter
class standing, as neither of the lower
division teams are rated capable of
| cleaning up on the upperclassmen
! which they meet the following week
to finish the series.
