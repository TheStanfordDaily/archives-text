SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25.â€”With
! Wrangcll, the la.st point in Southeastern
Alaska isolated by the broken cable
caused by yesterday's earthquake, again
in communication with the outside world
tonight with reports of no damage there,
: it seemed certain that the ccntcr of the
quake, if it was .really as violent as
seismographs recorded it, was some
| where under the ocean.
There were no reports of tidal waves
from any sections of the Pacific but all
fears of such disturbances had been prac
tically abandoned Tuesday night.
