# A 						CAPELLA SINGERS TO GIVE PROGRAM IN UNIVERSITY CHAPEL
## 
### 
The Smallman A Capella Choir of
Los Angeles will sing the service at
the Memorial Church at 11 o'clock
next Sunday. The choir is composed
of forty mixed voices, and was or
ganized in December 1924 by John
Smallman.
Singing "a capella," or unaccom
panied, is the purest form of choral
art and was the style used in the
early centuries. "A capella" means
literally, "chapel style," hence the
reason for the choir adopting the
Italian title.
For over three years this body of
singers has rehearsed, acquiring a
large repertoire. Smallman states that
his idea in making his tour is to in
spire other choirs to take up this
kind of music and present it in the
respectve churches, thereby gradually
raising the standard of church music,
â– especially on the Pacific Coast.
