## 
### 
"America wants to lead, but slie
will never lead other people until she
has learned to understand them," ad
vised Professor Yamato Ichihashi at
the open meeting of Y.W.C.A. last
night in the Women's Clubhouse.
"Racial and Religious prejudices are
obstacles hard to overcome. World
Peace needs a new basis of under
standing, and this must come from
the younger generation, free from the
heritage of the older. Students at
Stanford should use their leisure
time, outside of their intellectual ac
tivities, to open themselves up,
broaden their point of view, and think
in terms of the world.
"Stanford is unique in its stand
toward Far Eastern culture. It is the
only University in the country that
employs three professors who are spe
cialists in Far Eastern affairs."
The sixty new women who attended
the meeting were also addressed by
Winifred Huntington, president of the
Stanford Y.W.C.A., Anna Fitzhugh,
member of the Advisory Board, and
heads of the Y.W.C.A. commissions.
The new women then signed up for
commissions in which they were in
terested.
