# OREGON ELEVEN LEAVES EUGENE THURSDAY NIGHT
## Webfooters Have Versatile Passing Attack; May Baffle Cards ENDS WEAK RECEIVERS Three Triple-Threat Men in Backfield; Woodie Is Heady Player 
### Milton Silverman 
Captain Beryl Hodgen and his flock
of Webfooters will leave Eugene to
morrow night to give Stanford another
taste of a northern passing attack.
The Cardinals successfully weathered
the tossing attempts of the Oregon
Aggies last week, but that was on a
slow field, and the Orange ends could
not get down under the passes. What
will happen on a reasonably fast field
this Saturday may turn out to be
something entirely different.
The Oregon wingmen have been
working for weeks to perfect a de
pendable overhead attack. Thus far,
the main trouble with this style of
play is that the ends can't catch the
ball. There are passers aplenty in the
backfield, and they can throw the ball
with great speed and accuracy.
Triple Threat Men
Woodie, Coleman, and Robinson are
three triple-threat men specializing in
runs, short passes, and long passes.
Woodie is by far the best backfield
man on the team ,and produces most
of the Webfooters' effectiveness. He is
a heady player, knows good football,
and most certainly plays it.
Coleman, a second team player, is
not nearly so dangerous as is Bobby
Robinson, a fast, powerful negro back.
Robinson was bad business for the
Bears in the few minutes he was in
the California game. Fortunately for
Price's men, the Webfooter had not
sufficiently recovered from his in
juries of the week before to play more
than a few minutes.
Wetzel is Coach McEwan's best
choice for end, since this lanky lad
has had plenty of experience in both
backfield and line. When luck is with
him, he can catch a ball from any
angle, but his luck rarely stays with
him Ihrough an entire game. On the
other end Handley is not as sure on
the passes, nor is he quite so fast, but
his interference and hard tackling
have earned him a berth on the first
string.
Woodie Carries Offense
But with minor exceptions, the en
tire Oregon offense rests on the shoul
ders of Woodie. He does the big part
of the ball-carrying, as well as of the
kicking and passing. Something on the
type of Howard Maple of 0.A.C., as
long as he is in the play, Stanford
will do well to keep a close watch
on him.

of the ball-carrying, as well as of the
kicking and passing. Something on the
type of Howard Maple of 0.A.C., as
long as he is in the play, Stanford
will do well to keep a close watch
on him.
Captain Beryl Hodgen and his flock
of Webfooters will leave Eugene to
morrow night to give Stanford another
taste of a northern passing attack.
The Cardinals successfully weathered
the tossing attempts of the Oregon
Aggies last week, but that was on a
slow field, and the Orange ends could
not get down under the passes. What
will happen on a reasonably fast field
this Saturday may turn out to be
something entirely different.
The Oregon wingmen have been
working for weeks to perfect a de
pendable overhead attack. Thus far,
the main trouble with this style of
play is that the ends can't catch the
ball. There are passers aplenty in the
backfield, and they can throw the ball
with great speed and accuracy.
Triple Threat Men
Woodie, Coleman, and Robinson are
three triple-threat men specializing in
runs, short passes, and long passes.
Woodie is by far the best backfield
man on the team ,and produces most
of the Webfooters' effectiveness. He is
a heady player, knows good football,
and most certainly plays it.
Coleman, a second team player, is
not nearly so dangerous as is Bobby
Robinson, a fast, powerful negro back.
Robinson was bad business for the
Bears in the few minutes he was in
the California game. Fortunately for
Price's men, the Webfooter had not
sufficiently recovered from his in
juries of the week before to play more
than a few minutes.
Wetzel is Coach McEwan's best
choice for end, since this lanky lad
has had plenty of experience in both
backfield and line. When luck is with
him, he can catch a ball from any
angle, but his luck rarely stays with
him Ihrough an entire game. On the
other end Handley is not as sure on
the passes, nor is he quite so fast, but
his interference and hard tackling
have earned him a berth on the first
string.
Woodie Carries Offense
But with minor exceptions, the en
tire Oregon offense rests on the shoul
ders of Woodie. He does the big part
of the ball-carrying, as well as of the
kicking and passing. Something on the
type of Howard Maple of 0.A.C., as
long as he is in the play, Stanford
will do well to keep a close watch
on him.
