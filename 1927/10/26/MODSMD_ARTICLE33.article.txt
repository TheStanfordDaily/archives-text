DLANS for the handling of funds through the Students' Organizations
Fund are in the process of completion. An entirely new plan is being
proposed which includes the revamping and revision of regulations cover
ing requisition blanks, payment of bills, personal expense accopnts, and
all other matters coming under the general head of finance of student
organizations.
With the exception of' the Dramatic Council, the largest business
enterprises on the campus are the publications. Their needs and those
of the Dramatic Council are often immediate and necessary of quick
fulfillment. The managers of these organizations are men who have
met competition for their posts and upon whose shoulders responsibility
should rest. These are the men who are conversant with the problems
in their own particular field and they are the ones who should determine
what is satisfactory in the handling of the funds.
IT is imperative, therefore, that the wording of the new A.S.S.U. consti
tution be adhered to strictly. On the matter of publications the
say in Article IV, Section I, "The immediate financial and editorial
control of each publication shall be in a body local to that publication."
Any provisions for the handling of funds of these organizations must
not in any way hamper or impair the efficiency of the work of these
business managers.
It is upon the student manager that the task falls of evolving a
satisfactory set of rules for the Students' Organization Fund. What
ever system is adopted should be devoid of red tape and should be
satisfactory to the business managers concerned. Because of the com
plicated nature of these financial problems free discussion between all
managers is an essential item. All students through whose hands money
of student organizations passes are immediately concerned with these
problems.
THE matter, though not of such a character that it appeals to the
popular mind, is important. At the Executive Committee meeting last
night a vote of approval of the plan now under discussion was given.
The whole affair is one that will have to be worked out carefully in
order that all parties concerned may be satisfied. The groups directly
interested are the Executive Committee, the general and student man
agers. and the managers of the campus organizations. The question is one
which requires a careful and open investigation.
