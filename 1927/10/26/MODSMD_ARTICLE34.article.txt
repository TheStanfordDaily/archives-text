Dr. Byron Cummings, President of the University of Arizona, re
cently attended an Interfraternity smoker at that university. Following
the smoker he is reported to have remarked, "If the fraternity men
have no better ideals than have been shown here tonight, the fraternities
have no right to be on this campus or any other campus." The remark
is singularly deserving of comment.
To begin with, Dr. Cummings admits the possibility of fraternity
men having higher ideals. Higher than whbse ideals? The non
fraternity men? The idea is preposterous; fraternity men in the large
du not set themselves up as little tin gods with higher ideals than anyone
else. 1 112 they do, the fraternity system is rotten to the core.
The ideals, whatever they may be, of fraternity and non-fraternity
men as groups are the same. What one says about the ideals of one
group is applicable to the other group. In fact, it is wrong to speak of
them as groups in that connection; they are all college men, some of
whom live in fraternity houses.
Dr. Cummings commits another fallacy. After attending a smoker
on one campus, lie generalizes his conditional conclusion to suit any
campus. But we weary of pointing out other fallacies in his twenty
seven words.
