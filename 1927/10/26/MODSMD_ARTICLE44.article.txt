The Editor, Sir:
The showing of the freshman foot
ball team against the Trojan frosh
merits more commendation than the
score of 22 to 13 indicates. The mea
ger allowance doled out by the Board
of Athletic Control limited the squad
to a mere handful. This was par

tially recompensed by the fine spirit
of some six or seven substitutes who
paid their own expenses. However, in
juries developed early in the game
and the ranks were quickly depleted
so that guards were forced to play
tackle positions, and halfbacks played
as fullbacks, etc. It was even neces
sary for Heiser with a broken nose
and Moffit with a crushed shoulder to
return and play most of the second

half on nerve. The Stanford frosh bat
tied till the final gun and were a con
slant threat. The members of the var
sity might benefit from the gritty ex
ample of these youngsters who havt
spent a bare two months on the Stan
ford campus. —An Alumnus.
