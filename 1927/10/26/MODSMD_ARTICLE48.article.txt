# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The Army may have its Cagle and
its Wilson, Southern California its
Drury and its Elliott, Ohio State its
Marek and its Eby, but Northwestern
is not worrying, for hasn't it Vic Gus
tafson and Tiny Lewis, two of the
sweetest ball-carriers who ever trod
a gridiron? Perhaps the Purple rooters
are a bit carried away by their en
thusiasm, perhaps Vie and Tiny are
not the two greatest backs in the
country, or even in the Western Con
ference, but just the same they'll do
for little old Northwestern, and North
western may well be proud of her
two stalwart sons.
Didn't Vic Gustafson catch the open
ing kick-off in the Chicago game last
year and dash ninety-two yards
through the entire Maroon team to a
touchdown, helping the Purple to de
feat Stagg's men for the first time in
ten years? I'll say he did, and right
in the new stadium at Evanston, too!
Vic comes from Wheaton, 111., the
home town of the great Grange, so
touchdowns on the kick-off are to be
expected from him. On the second
play of the 1926 Northwestern-lowa
game, Gustafson stepped sixty-five
yards for a touchdown that was nulli
fied because of off-side play.' He also
is a basketball player of some ability,
which accounts for the manner in
which he snares passes.
Now for Brother Lewis, the big full
back, called "Tiny" in fun, but chris
tened Leland. A triple-threat man,
this Lewis person, who can pass,
kick, and run, as easily as you or I
walk, talk, and eat. In the South
Dakota game early this month, he not

only ran the opening kick-off back
eighty-five yards for a touchdown, but
he ran 101 yards for a score later on
in the game. Tiny eats up yardage
like Tony Lazzerri does macaroni!
Northwestern meets Missouri this
Saturday. The Tigers beat Nebraska
a couple of weeks ago with two of
their star players injured, so it ap
pears that Gustafson and Tiny have
their work cut out for them, but Cap
tain Gus wasn't named Victor for
nothing!
