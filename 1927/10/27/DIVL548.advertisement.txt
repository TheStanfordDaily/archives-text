THE JUNIOR COLLEGE
ITS ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION
Wlliam M. Proctor, Editor
A joint study of the junior college in actual operation, made by eleven men
who arc in close touch with the junior college movement and who speak
here from their practical experience as teachers and school executives.
"The timeliness of such a study is obvious, in view of the rapid growth of
the junior college movement in California as in other states. The fact that
these men are actively engaged in junior collcge work, and are here setting
forth the results' of their experience, makes the book of real importance
to the educational world."—Sierra Educational News.
