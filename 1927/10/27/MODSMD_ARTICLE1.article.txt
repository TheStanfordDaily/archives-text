# SHIP BLOWS UP AS PROPELLER SHAFT BREAKS
## Loss Believed Not So Great As Was Declared in Earlier Reports LIFE RAFTS LAUNCHED Five Boats Act in Rescue of 1256 Persons Aboard Stricken Craft 
### 
' RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Oct. 26.—
Rescue ships were speeding toward Bra
zilian ports tonight with survivors of the
liner Principessa Mafalda, which explod
ed and sank off the Brazilian coast while
en route to Rio de Janeiro with more
than 1,000 passengers and crew members.
Of the 1256 persons aboard the veteran
liner, which was making its very last
voyage after nineteen years of service, it
was believed 100 to 300 were lost.
Little definite information was avail
able pending the arrival of rescue ships.
The Principessa Mafalda, bound for
Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, sank
last night about ninety miles east of Ita—
quena Point, Brazil. Its propeller shaft
had broken and apparently it was strug
gling toward port when the explosion
occurred.
S.O.S. signals had been sent out as an
extra precaution and they were heard in
Brazil at 7 :30 o'clock last night.
Ships at sea had received the distress
calls earlier and about six liners had put
on full steam in a desperate dash to the
rescue.
Undoubtedly there was plenty of time
to launch the lifeboats. Otherwise, ex
pert mariners here pointed out, the loss
of life would have been far greater.
With the lifeboats at sea, carrying their
human cargoes, the ships speeding to the
rescue had no difficulty finding the exact
spot where the Principessa Mafalda went
down.
The rescues were effected by the steam
ers Empire Star, Alhena, Formosa, and
Rossetti.
The French steamer Mosella, reported
to be bringing an unknown number of
the Mafalda's passengers and crew, is
due here early Thursday. Until tonight,
it had not even been reported among the
ships participating in the rescue.
