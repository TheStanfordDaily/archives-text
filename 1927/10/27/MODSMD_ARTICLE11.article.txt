# BABE SOCCER TEAM WILL MEET MISSION HIGH SCHOOL TODAY
## 
### 
Yearling soccer men will meet the
Mission High School team at 4 o'clock
today on the varsity soccer field. The
San Francisco men should give the
first-year squad a stiff workout since
they beat the California freshmen by
a 1-0 score in one game and tied them
1-1 in the second game.
The babes have been rounding into
shape rapidly with hard workouts this
week. They meet the San Jose Junior
College next Saturday morning in
their second conference game and
are anxious to avenge their defeat by-
San Mateo Junior College, which de
feated them 4-0.
