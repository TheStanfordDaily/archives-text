# FOWLER DISCUSSES COLORADO DAM AT ENGINEERS MEETING
## 
### 
"The damming of the Colorado River
is a great engineering problem which
will be solved eventually, and some of
you young men will in all probability take
part in the solving of this problem," de
clared Frederick Hall Fowler, '05, in an
informal address before the thirty-five
student members of the American So
ciety of Civil Engineers last night at the
home of Professor Reynolds in Palo
Alto.
Fowler's talk centered around a four
teen-day boat trip down the Colorado for
a distance of about 240 miles, made by
himself and two companions.
