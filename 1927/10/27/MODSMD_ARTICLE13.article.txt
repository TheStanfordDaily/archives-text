# Ruth Says College Men Coming Into Leagues Need Experience
## 
### Herb Wenig 
"College boys coming into the big
leagues have a lot to learn," said
Babe Ruth, Sultan of Swat and the
motive power for sixty-one circuit
clouts this season, when asked about
Ernie Nevers, former Stanford foot
ball and baseball star. Speaking of
Nevers, Babe went on to say, "He's a
great boy. Coming right along, but
he still needs a lot of experience. He
mixes them up like the rest of them
and now and then I collect one from
him."
Dine on Campus
Ruth and Lou Gehrig, the boy who
kept on the Yankee star's heels dur
ing most of the season, were at the
Phi Delta Theta house last evening
for dinner. Babe is easy to meet.
Tells you to sit right down and an
swers questions about himself quietly
and with little enthusiasm. "Sixty-one
is a hard record to crack. I doubt if
I can do it next year."
But when it comes to talking about

his club Ruth brightens a bit and
seems relieved that the question is not
about himself. "Will the Yankees get
the pennant next year?" he was asked.
"The Yanks are sure to repeat," he
replied. "No club can come near them
at present.
"Two or three more years is all I
want. Big League ball and this barn
storming (he is now on a tour) gets
you," lie answered when asked how
long he would play ball.
Gehrig Fascinates
Lou Gehrig has a personality that
fascinates. He is many years younger
than Ruth and has had the enthusi
asm of one looking forward to bigger
things. When he was questioned
about college baseball he said, "I
played for Columbia three years ago
but it is a different story when you
get in the majors. You feel so green
you're afraid the caretaker will cut
you down with the lawn-mower."
The dinner last evening was held in
honor of Gehrig, who was a Phi Delta
Theta at Columbia.
