# STAGE SETTINGS FOR "LADY OF THE ROSE" NEARING COMPLETION
## Obtain Hand-Carved Antique Furniture for Campus Presentation 
### Hallie Keating 
Sets for "The Lady of the Rose"
are nearly completed, making a rec
ord for completion of scenes for the
first play of the quarter. One of the
features of the play will be the hand
carved antiques which Mrs. Chrysella
Dunker Kiler, property and costume
director, has secured.
A gorgeous carved chest, wing
chairs, and a beautiful refectory table
are among these. The costumes of the
women of the cast, while modern,
have also been chosen with care to
maintain the spirit of the play. New
drapes have been secured.
John Newbegin, who is in charge of
the lights this year, has nearly fin
ished work on the effects planned.
"The Lady of the Rose" calls for
more complicated and elaborate light
ing than any production since "Hell
Bent Fer Heaven."
Technically the most interesting
set will be the burlesqued reproduc
tion of the study of John Meredith's
home, at Lubin's Theatre, with which
the stolen play is to be produced. Al
though the same sets will be used in
this change of scene, the lighting pro
duces an entirely different effect.
Rough seats for the play will go
on sale at fifty cents each Friday
night at 7 o'clock, at the ticket office
in the Assembly Hall. A few good
seats are still available downstairs,
which may be secured at the office
of the Dramatic Council in the Old
Union.
