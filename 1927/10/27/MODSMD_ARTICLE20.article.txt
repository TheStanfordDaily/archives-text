# GRAYS HANDICAPPED BY LOSS OF TAYLOR; NEED NEW FULLBACK
## 
### 
Coach Hal Davis has the problem
j of developing a fullback for his Gray
i eleven to solve before his charges
meet the University of California Re
serves in the stadium one week from
Saturday.
Taylor, regular holder of the posi
tion, received a shoulder injury
against St. Mary's last week, which
has developed to such an extent that
he will not play any more this sea
son. The fact that Taylor is a sensa
tional passer makes his going even
, more serious. W T ilson, the other Gray
! full of ability, is out of a suit, and it
is questionable whether he will be of
any service from now on.
May is another valuable player who
won't report for some time. The fact
that Davis has several good halves
makes this loss less important than
| the scarcity of fullbacks.
Driscoll, who has been smashing
I things up at guard for the Grays, has
! been elevated to the varsity again.
His job will probably be held in the
future by Doyle, recently demoted
from Pop Warner's contingent.
