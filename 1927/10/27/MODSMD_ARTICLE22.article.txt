# HOOT TEAM LEAVES EUGENE FOR CARD GAME
## Northern Gridders Primed to Avenge Defeat at Hands of Bruins BOB SIMS MAY BE OUT Second String Backfield to Play Against Oregon In Contest 
### Milton Silverman 
Leaving Eugene early this morning,
the Oregon Webfooters will embark
in time to have one practice in Cali
fornia before they tackle Pop War
ner's Redshirts Saturday in the Stan
ford stadium. Once again the North
erners are preparing to meet the
Cards on lopsided terms, but still have
the usual pre-game feeling of an even
chance of victory.
The full strength of the Webfooters
will be pitted against a slightly dam
aged Stanford team. While the Ore
gon outfit has been taking a rest for
two weeks, the Cards have been mak
ing hay, and with the normal results—
a few broken haywielders.
Sims on Bench
Rob Sims has been sitting on the
bench for the past few days with a
wad of tape on his ankle and a dis
consolate look on his face. Louis Vin
centi will be kept out of the play
Saturday because of a bad leg. Al
though he considers himself ready for
a quarter or so of football, Spud Har
der is still kept out of scrimmage by
doctor's orders.
These injuries have caused changes
in the several teams that might serve
up a new style of play to the Ore
gonians. A second string combination,
featuring Fleishhacker, Frentrup, and
Patchett, will get a chance early in
the game to go gunning for Ducks.
Oregon in Good Shape
Injuries, on the other hand, mean
nothing to Coach McEwan, who will
have an untarnished squad to heave
at the Cardinals. Robby Robinson's
injured wrist is entirely recovered,
and he has been messing up the Ore
gon seconds during the scrimmages
this week. At left end, Howard Hand
ley is back after easing up on a
wrenched ankle. Hal Hatton, half, is
kicking over the traces since he found
his foot still definitely attached after
a bad spill in practice.
