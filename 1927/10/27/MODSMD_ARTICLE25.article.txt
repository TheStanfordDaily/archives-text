"We may be very sure that in the future as in the past the Navy's
services to industry and the arts of peace and science zi'dl continue com
pletely to justify its maintenance in the highest efficiency.'—Calvin,
COOLIDGE.
The question of sea power is one that has always attracted both col
leges and politicians, and it is rarely that the two groups agree on solu
tions that are offered. Colleges make charges of undesirability of navies
and of war caused by rivalry. In return they receive little attention
from the practical politicians, who apparently regard them as dwelling
places of impractical dreamers. In general, the cloistered college walls
harbor fine theories of international peace, achieved without the aid of
navies or armies, while a great many politicians feel that such peace may
not be achieved without powerful arms of defense.
The college students who may sometime be called upon to fight for
their country are in one of the warring camps and the information placed
at their use for a personal decision on the question of sea power is neces
sarily colored. It would be the same if the students were under the influ
ence of politicians.
A navy is more to the nation than a means of defense. It is inciden
tally. to the popular mind, a symbol of national unity—an expression of
some force constantly ready to protect the nation. That's why news reels
always carry some naval or military scenes. The public likes to see
great dreadnaughts in battle practice. It would seem, then, that the
people side with the politicians, but where do college students side."
October 27, the birthday of President Theodore Roosevelt, has been
set aside by the Navy League of the United States for public observance
and press comment on naval affairs. The message of this year's Navy
Day is an effort to point out the use of the navy to commerce and the
interrelation of the merchant marine and sea power. More open discus
sion on naval affairs is desirable so that the taxpayers (and college stu
dents will be in that class soon) may know something of these problems.
One Navy Day isn't enough to properly educate all concerned on naval
matters.
