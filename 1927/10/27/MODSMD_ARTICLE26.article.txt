# Another Bloomer

Miss Helen Bunting', Director of Ruble Gymnasium, tells us that the
girls themselves have designed the present costumes they wear in ath
letics. This seems to us much like saying they have made their own
beds, so now they must lie in them. Since it is up to the users (we must,
of course, assume this) to work out their own dress, it seems a futile
thing for them to object to having to wear the ridiculous whoozits they
now affect, unless they have a few suggestions of their own.
Either the women are too indolent to start any movement, or they
don't care, but from the invective that is hurled at "those darned tents"
we believe they do care. We suggest, since the burning question at Roble
Gym now is, whether or not the girls will roll their stockings, that all of
them get together and decide on a real campaign slogan, such as "A
rolled stocking means a quicker kick," or something to that effect.
But what is bothering us is, why the girls (or is it merely the
administration?) object to wearing something similar to the men's gym
suits. Aside from the matter of modesty, which is all a lot of tosh
anyhow, consider the saving if they were to adopt the simpler regalia.
The women's suits cost around twenty dollars at present. The men's
are only about two to six dollars. And since the upper division women
do not have to take physical education any more, the girls can wear
their costumes onlv two years.
