Eugene O'Neill once again brings
to us a transcending of satire, in
which he shows the agony of human
spirit in the face of its own ineffec
tually. If you like a keen satire, and
a good play, you might read Eugene
O'NeilT's "Marco Millions," recently
published by Boni and Liveright.
The remarkable dramatic imagina
tion of Mr. O'Neill in choosing the
half-legendary figure of Marco Polo
for his hero, endowing him with all
the attributes of a modern Babbittry
and then creating a Tartar princess to
fall in love with him is something to
wonder at. The Princess Kukachin is
the ideal Queen of Love, if there ever
was one. Only Marco doesn't know it.
And even when the overwhelming
power of Kukachin's passion draws
him halfway to the heaven that is pre
pared for him —the love is lost. Marco
never gets any farther than saving
the princess three times. Was that
romance? All Marco thought of was
the possible bonus he might get from
the prospective husband of the prin
cess for doing it.
Thus the love of the lovely Princess
Kukachin was wasted on an illusion —
and the illusion was Marco Polo. Thus
the life of Marco Polo, as seen in the
crystal, was exhausted in things that
perish. The tragedy of love wasted on
an illusion and better off in death;
the tragedy of life lost in the pursuit
of things that perish; the tragedy of
faith embalmed in a series of dead
symbols; the tragedy of philosophy
unanswered through the ages—this is
the central theme from which the
play is woven.
It is a sermon, not only on the
graceless indifference of an age that
builds its own Babels, but also a com
mentary on ttie eternal fatuity of the
flesh. Set amid the "barbaric pearls
and gold" of the medieval Orient, it
accounts for that fatalism immemor
ially associated with the East; and in

doing so utters a challenge to the easy |
! optimism of the West.
What a tremendous spectacle tliis
j play will he on the stage will never
be known until it is performed. Per-
I sonally I wquld like to see such an
actor as Rollo Peters in the part of
Marco and then the effect would be
| memorable. Now who should play j
Kukacliin—well, since she was Love \
and Beauty it is hard to say. That is
a difficultrrolande —and this is no Judg
• ment of Paris.
