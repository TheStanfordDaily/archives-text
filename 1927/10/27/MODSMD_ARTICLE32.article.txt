1 have never seen so many dancing
boys as there were at the tryouts yester
day afternoon. And some of them sang
| the most intricate songs like Pomp's pe
jeuliar perpetual patent pocket Pomeranic
! ponies for passing examinations.
But I really think chorus girls should
j n't be made to do such intricate steps
I right at first. I mean they are supposed
j to begin at the bottom, unless someone
I nice helps them. But can you sec a
'woman for a chorus director? Just think
of all the wasted efforts!
There was just the right atmosphere,
J too. Quite Bohemian with everyone mov
j ing about and talking and sitting any
j where. And the noise helped a lot be
cause an actor never knows what kind
of an audience there is going to be. And
campus men are so critical, too. I mean
to say, every girl can't be gifted with
graceful arms and things.
And I know there must have been a
lot of original ideas there, but everyone
! seemed sort of bashful about saying any
| thing about them.
