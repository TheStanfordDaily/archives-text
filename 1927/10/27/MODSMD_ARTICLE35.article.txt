Question: Why didn't the Univer
sity invite Judge Lindsey to speak
when there was such a demand for
him?
Answer by the editor:
| The request, of certain students to
have Judge Lindsey speak here was
denied by J. E. McDowell, Chairman
I of the Committee on Public Exer
cises, which has control of such mat
ters. Tlie reasons given were lack of
i funds, the crowded condition of the
; calendar, and the University's general
| policy concerning such matters. This
\ policy is outlined in a letter recently
J sent out by President Wilbur, in eon-
I formity with a provision in the Found-
Ing- Grant, a copy of which letter is
fully set out in the editorial columns
of the Daily for Tuesday, October 25.
! Incidentally there is a question as to
i how great the "demand" was.
