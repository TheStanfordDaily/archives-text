Hollywood has fallen for the lure of
the collegian!
Are dusky sirens imported from the
shadows of the pyramids these days?
Are buxom bathing beauties cavorting
around but never in the water? Realiz
ing that the correct answer here is "No!"
you must consign the dear old days of
the movies' infancy to the precious past
along with the War, your high school
thought so perfect.
Old-Timers Gone
Today it's very much a case of
good-bye to the old-timers' inefficiency
and stupidity and welcome to the well
bred and intelligent college graduates
who have shown that they can write, pro
duce, direct, and act much better than
cx-cloak and suit men, dime novelists,
hash slingers, and Follies queens. I
wouldn't fool you for anything, and to
prove my contention I'll give you an in
side glimpse of what collegians are doing
right now in picture land.
For the sake of local color, perhaps
I'd best begin by telling you about some
of the Stanford grads who hold hand
some positions in Hollywood. Getting
into a studio is just as easy as nabbing
Lindy for a day's personal chat ,and even
Wales himself would have to produce
newspaper clippings to convince those
hard-boiled gatekeepers that he was the
man who falls so often. But sentimental
mention of the Quad brought a number
of gallant alumni with the magic pass
word to my aid.
Coming down to cases, consider the
career of Denison Clift, '07, who is very
well known as a director, playwright,
and scenarist. His play, "The Woman
Disputed," recently ran nine months on
Broadway. Norma Talmadge is filming
it now, Clift having written the scenario.
His book, "Guns of Gait," scored so
heavily last spring that Mae Murray
bought it for production this season,

Although his most vivid recollection j
of Stanford seemed to be the morning j
that the 1906 earthquake shook him out |
of Eticina Hall, I uncovered traces of j
many campus activities. Besides editing!

terfly Isles" and "In Tangicrs." I

| After graduation he edited the Ovcr-
I land Monthly, became a special news and
publicity writer, and was advertising
| manager for Hale Bros, for six years.
In 1917 he left San Francisco to enter
the picture game under Cecil B. De
| Mille's guidance, writing and directing
many stories for this producer as well as
for the Fox organization.
In 1920, Clift went to England to
direct eleven pictures, including such suc
cesses as A. S. M. Hutchinson's "This
Freedom," Stephen McKenna's "Sonia,"
Arnold Bennett's "Old Wives' Talc," and
George Meredith's "Diana of the Cross
ways." Returning to Hollywood in 1923,
via a world tour encompassing thirty
countries, he resumed his association with
De Mille. One of his recent screen
stories was "The Yankee Clipper," and
at present he is just completing a stage
play dealing with diplomatic intrigue in
Washington, D.C. Other novels and
plays are in preparation.
The Clifts (Mrs. Clift being Lillian
Sturgess, '08) have just moved into a
charming new home in Beverly Hills, and
there arc two children who are planning
very earnestly to come to Stanford in a
few years.
Stanford Prominent
You who read movie magazines will be
surprised to know that one of the fore
most contributors to these journals is a
Stanford woman, Miss Helen Starr, a
Kappa of the class of '09. Becoming in
tensely interested in theatrical work after
taking part in campus dramatics, Miss
Starr went on the legitimate stage, win
ning laurels in all lines of the drama, in
cluding regular plays, musical comedy,
stock engagements, and Keith vaudeville.
One of her hits was "Within the Law,"
in which she toured for an entire year.
Visiting in Hollywood, as so many
stage people do, Miss Starr played in
the movies a short while and then be
came interested in the writing angle of
the game. Having written short stories
all the time she was on the stage, she was
soon writing scenarios and titles at the
Goldwyn, Universal, American, and
Schulberg studios.
Now Free Lance
Now she is free-lancing, writing spe
cial features and interviews for such
film magazines as "Motion Picture," do

for several well-known stars, and acting,

via a world tour encompassing thirty
countries, he resumed his association with

Stanford Prominent
You who read movie magazines will be
surprised to know that one of the fore
most contributors to these journals is a
Stanford woman, Miss Helen Starr, a
Kappa of the class of '09. Becoming in
tensely interested in theatrical work after
taking part in campus dramatics, Miss
Starr went on the legitimate stage, win
ning laurels in all lines of the drama, in
cluding regular plays, musical comedy,
stock engagements, and Keith vaudeville.
One of her hits was "Within the Law,"
in which she toured for an entire year.
Visiting in Hollywood, as so many
stage people do, Miss Starr played in
the movies a short while and then be
came interested in the writing angle of
the game. Having written short stories
all the time she was on the stage, she was
soon writing scenarios and titles at the
Goldwyn, Universal, American, and
Schulberg studios.
Now Free Lance
Now she is free-lancing, writing spe
cial features and interviews for such
film magazines as "Motion Picture," do
ing original short stories for fiction mag
azines, acting as publicity representative
for several well-known stars, and acting,
as Hollywood representative for the!
Thompson Feature Syndicate Service of!

New York City. (A. A. Preciado, '09,
is general manager of the latter, which
serves hundreds of newspapers through

Butler, star and director for Fox; Wral

leading lady for Universal; and Guy
Bennett, special cameraman for Para

through the various studios, we'll start

Old-Timers Gone
Today it's very much a case of
good-bye to the old-timers' inefficiency
and stupidity and welcome to the well
bred and intelligent college graduates
who have shown that they can write, pro
duce, direct, and act much better than
cx-cloak and suit men, dime novelists,
hash slingers, and Follies queens. I
wouldn't fool you for anything, and to
prove my contention I'll give you an in
side glimpse of what collegians are doing
right now in picture land.
For the sake of local color, perhaps
I'd best begin by telling you about some
of the Stanford grads who hold hand
some positions in Hollywood. Getting
into a studio is just as easy as nabbing
Lindy for a day's personal chat ,and even
Wales himself would have to produce
newspaper clippings to convince those
hard-boiled gatekeepers that he was the
man who falls so often. But sentimental
mention of the Quad brought a number
of gallant alumni with the magic pass
word to my aid.
Coming down to cases, consider the
career of Denison Clift, '07, who is very
well known as a director, playwright,
and scenarist. His play, "The Woman
Disputed," recently ran nine months on
Broadway. Norma Talmadge is filming
it now, Clift having written the scenario.

For the sake of local color, perhaps

mention of the Quad brought a number
of gallant alumni with the magic pass

Coming down to cases, consider the
career of Denison Clift, '07, who is very
well known as a director, playwright,
and scenarist. His play, "The Woman
Disputed," recently ran nine months on
Broadway. Norma Talmadge is filming
it now, Clift having written the scenario.

In 1917 he left San Francisco to enter
the picture game under Cecil B. De

many stories for this producer as well as
for the Fox organization.
In 1920, Clift went to England to
direct eleven pictures, including such suc
cesses as A. S. M. Hutchinson's "This
Freedom," Stephen McKenna's "Sonia,"
Arnold Bennett's "Old Wives' Talc," and
George Meredith's "Diana of the Cross
ways." Returning to Hollywood in 1923,
via a world tour encompassing thirty
countries, he resumed his association with
De Mille. One of his recent screen
stories was "The Yankee Clipper," and
at present he is just completing a stage
play dealing with diplomatic intrigue in
Washington, D.C. Other novels and
plays are in preparation.
The Clifts (Mrs. Clift being Lillian
Sturgess, '08) have just moved into a
charming new home in Beverly Hills, and
there arc two children who are planning
very earnestly to come to Stanford in a
few years.
Stanford Prominent
You who read movie magazines will be
surprised to know that one of the fore
most contributors to these journals is a
Stanford woman, Miss Helen Starr, a
Kappa of the class of '09. Becoming in
tensely interested in theatrical work after
taking part in campus dramatics, Miss
Starr went on the legitimate stage, win
ning laurels in all lines of the drama, in
cluding regular plays, musical comedy,
stock engagements, and Keith vaudeville.
One of her hits was "Within the Law,"
in which she toured for an entire year.
Visiting in Hollywood, as so many
stage people do, Miss Starr played in
the movies a short while and then be
came interested in the writing angle of
the game. Having written short stories
all the time she was on the stage, she was
soon writing scenarios and titles at the
Goldwyn, Universal, American, and
Schulberg studios.
