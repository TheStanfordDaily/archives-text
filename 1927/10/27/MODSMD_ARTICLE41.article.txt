THAT REBATE
Yesterday at 2 p.m.
i The Bookstore Gang
Presented me
With three iron men.
Now where the heck
Have those three
Ferrous gentlemen
Disappeared!

CABBAGES OPINION COLUMN
The Editor, Sir:
One of Stanford's "fairest" was
standing by the Girls' steps. My
roommate went up to her and said,
"May I take you to the dance
on Nov. 4?" The girl was insulted!
Can't you date a campus woman under
four weeks' notice?
—Little Oswald, '31.

YES?
Now that "Gordie" is in Europe, we
can tell this one at his expense.
Two elderly women were overheard
talking on the Quad this summer.
They were standing before a poster
announcing "The Angel of the House,"
starring Gordon Davis.
One turned to the other and in
' formed her, "That's the story of the
! Christ, you know." —E.C.
DINKEY DITTIES
! I watch my fellow passengers
Observe their styles and fads,
\ And tiring of the passing show
I read the street car "ads."
Now the "first thing you think of"
Is Mr. Ridgeway's tea.
! Next come Calumet muffins —
Gosh, they look good to me!
j And if your clothes get ink on 'em,
It is nobody's fault.
For presto! Chango! and away— l
It's cleaned by Leslie's Salt.
I THE BEGINNING OF A BEAUTIFUL
CAMPUS FRIENDSHIP
"I'm so far behind jn my work that
; I'll !"
"Am I behind? I'm so fa;* behind in
that I'll probably —• ."
"I thought all the time that you
were one of those up-to-the-minute
men."
"Hex, no! I'm about to flunk that

| course!"
"Come on up to the room sometime
and bring your uke along."

Mr. Heinz makes pickles
And also good spaghetti.
And say! That girl on Rinso's ad
Looks like my cousin Betty.
Now Paly town is almost here,
In movie land I'll roam.
Two to one I'll catch a ride —
Not take the Dinkey home!

FRESHMAN PRIMER
I have a car.
It is se-cond-hand.
I have a second-hand car.
It does not run very well.
It steers fun-ny.
It leaks.
It leaks water
It leaks gas.
It leaks oil.
It leaks gas, oil, and water.
The brakes do not hold.
It has a knock.
Things come apart in it.
I am always paying for re-pairs.
The guy who sold it to me was a
damn swindler. —J.T.

Dean Frank W. Nicholson of W<>s
leyan College holds the opinion that
students should not work during their
first few months in college. He says
that the time should be devoted to
becoming adjusted to college life.
"But why just the first few
months?" asks little Oswald.
