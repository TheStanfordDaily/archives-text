# CONTRIBUTORS TO 'LIT' NOT REQUIRED TO TRY OUT-MARGARET OLSEN
## 
### 
"There is some confusion in the minds
of those interested in the Stanford Lit
erary Magazine as to the relation of try
outees and contributors to the publica
tion," said Margaret Olsen, editor of the
magazine.
"We of the editorial staff wish to
make it clear that tryoutees are not neces
sarily contributors nor arc contributors
required to try out. Each is independent
of the other."
Miss Olsen further stated that the
Headline for copy for the first issue is
October 31 and that short stories regard
ing college life, specifically Stanford, arc
much desired. Poetry and light essays are
also suitable for publication.
