# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Well, Harvard plays Indiana Satur
day and folks are wondering if the
Cantabs are going to be beaten twice
in one season by Western Conference
teams. At first glance, Indiana ap
pears to be one of the weakest of the
Big Ten outfits this year, as they
were beaten 13 to 0 by Chicago, and
Chicago hadn't won a conference
game since 1925. But no one who
knows Pat Page, the Hoosier coach,
will concede Johnny Harvard a cinch
in the coming intersectional battle.
For Harlan Orville Page is a fighter
all the way through, and he has the
knack of instilling his own aggres
siveness into his teams before an

important game. As a student at Chi
cago, he played end 011 the team for
two years, and, in 1909, was captain
and quarterback. Following Ecker
sall and Steffen as pilot of Stagg's
Maroons was 110 easy job, but little
Pat, by his gameness, fiery zeal, and
all-around ability, usually came off
the field after each game covered with
grime—and glory.
Nine sweaters- did Pat win at Chi
cago, in football, basketball, and base
ball. I wrote last January about a
trick goal that Pat made against Penn
in 1908, shooting the ball between his
legs when knocked off balance, and
winning the game in the final minute

of play. Page's punting was like that
too, he'd just throw the ball up in the !
air any old way, and hick it with his
left foot, and oh boy, how she would
travel! Pat also shone at passing and j
receiving passes, and it was his left- j
handed heave to Schommer that tied '
the Cornell game about 1909.
After ten years on the Midway as '
basketball and baseball coach, Pat j
went to Butler, where he had remark
able success with so small an institu
tion. His team beat Illinois at football
in 1921 —so look out, Harvard!
