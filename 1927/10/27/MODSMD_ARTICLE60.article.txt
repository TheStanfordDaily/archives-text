## Moffat, Heiser Out of Game; Hunt Lacks Reserves To Fill Gaps 
### 
It will be a crippled freshman foot
ball team which takes the field Satur
day against Santa Barbara Junior
College for the last contest before
the Little Big Game.
With Moffat definitely out, the year
ling offensive power is seriously di
minished. He has been a mainstay
in the backfield all season. His shoul
der injury, received against U.S.C.,
was serious, and will put him under
the weather for months. The fact that
Dawson was badly bruised also makes
things look a little less promising.
Line in Bad Shape
The line, however, is the portion
of Hunt's outfit which is in the worst
straits. Captain Heiser's broken nose
will keep him out of practice indefi
nitely. Bigelow is not in a suit be
cause of a ruptured blood vessel in his
leg. Pike and Tampcke are not able to
do heavy work. The squad is lacking
in reserve linesmen so these gaps will
be hard to fill. Even if the injured
players are able to see action Satur
day they will seriously feel the lack
of practice.
Reserves Hamper Babes
It is this lack of reserve material
which has hampered the babes all
season. While they were able to pre
sent an unbroken front to the Trojan
freshmen the Stanford team consist
ently outgained the Southerners, but
as soon as the casualties began occur
ring Stanford could not hold the
U.S.C. outfit.
To make things worse, it is said that
Santa Barbara has a strong team for
Saturday's game. Earlier in the sea
son they held Occidental College's
eleven to a 14 to 0 score.
