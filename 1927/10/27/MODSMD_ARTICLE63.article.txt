### 
PARIS, Oct. 26.—Through a peculiar
technicality of French criminal law, a
jury today found that Samuel Schwartz
bard, who boasted about his assassination
of General Simon Petlura, did not even
wound the general.
Schwartzbard's flat acquittal of the
crime was hailed as a great victory for
the Jews. It had been his boast that he
killed Petlura because the general had
led bloody Jewish massacres in the
Ukraine.
Uproarious scenes marked the an
nouncement of the verdict in the crowded
court of assizes. Enthusiastic sympathiz
ers lifted the newly freed Schwartzbard
on their shoulders and carried him out
of court.
The case went to the jury at 5 :40 o'-
clock in the afternoon, after the French
Attorney General asked the jury, not for
the death penalty for the defendant, but
for a prison sentence.
"I prefer that Schwartzbard be sent to
jail for a certain time," said the mild
mannered prosecutor.
The jury was out only twenty minutes.
One by one, they returned from an ante
room and took their seats. Then their
unusual verdict was announced.
