WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 26.â€”Ad
miral T. P. Magruder, recalled as com
mandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard,
will be questioned further about his re
cent attacks on the service, it was said
today at the Navy Department.
Although Secretary of the Navy Wil
bur said Magruder's recall from his pres
ent post to Washington was not intended
as a punitive move, other navy officials
declare that the admiral must answer for
his "unwarranted" accusations against
the efficiency of the navy.
Magruder was ordered to leave his
present post and report to Washington
not later than November 3. He will be
succeeded by Rear Admiral Julian Lati
mer, former chief of American naval
forces in Nicaragua.
Navy officers are incensed over Ma
gruder's repeated After his first
magazine article on"The Navy and
Economy" had been overlooked, he should
not have continued to "bait" his navy su
periors by continuing the attack, it was
said.
