# REDUCE ARMAMENTS, OUTLAW WAR, URGES DAVID STARR JORDAN

That naval armaments should be re
duced and finally abolished altogether,
and that the people of the United
States and of the world at large
should be educated to look upon war
as an atavistic and abominable sort
of conflict, and consequently to out
law war between nations, as duelling
has already been made illegal, be
tween individuals, was the opinion ex
pressed by Dr. Jordan during an in
terview given the Daily yesterday.
"In my opinion the only purpose
that a large navy can serve is that of
a gigantic decoration for a gigantic
nation such as ours," Dr. Jordan said.
"It has been said that these great
ships of the navy would probably be
of no considerable consequence in
case of war. Of course, there oughtn't
to be any naval warfare at all, but
if there should be, airplanes would
probably decide the issue.
"No Dangerous Enemy"
"I don't think there is such a thing
as a dangerous enemy to the United
States. The world is dead set against
war. However it is not necessary for a
nation to have a navy to be prosper
ous; Denmark has no navy to speak
of, yet it is prosperous. Of course, one
must be cautious in assigning causes
of prosperity or of poverty, but it
seems that a large naval force is not
the reason for a nation's well-being.
"It would be unwise absolutely to
cut out our navy all at once, but
there should be reduction, which
would in the end remove our naval
establishment altogether.
"Education is the one thing which
will make war impossible. The idea

'that it is a great, noble thnig to die
for one's country' is one which is es
sentially bad for world peace, and
one which should no longer be
taught.
"Rivalry Provokes War"
"Rivalry, provoked and maintained
by armament builders, has been the
cause of former wars," continued Dr.
Jordan, speaking of the principal rea
sons lor international strife.
"Incidentally, the splendidly edu
cated and organized personnel of our
navy does not like to have its appro
priations cut down, but this fact does
not make the navy indispensable,"
Dr. Jordan added.

"It would be unwise absolutely to
cut out our navy all at once, but
there should be reduction, which
would in the end remove our naval
establishment altogether.
"Education is the one thing which
will make war impossible. The idea

'that it is a great, noble thnig to die
for one's country' is one which is es
sentially bad for world peace, and
one which should no longer be
taught.
"Rivalry Provokes War"
"Rivalry, provoked and maintained
by armament builders, has been the
cause of former wars," continued Dr.
Jordan, speaking of the principal rea
sons lor international strife.
"Incidentally, the splendidly edu
cated and organized personnel of our
navy does not like to have its appro
priations cut down, but this fact does
not make the navy indispensable,"
Dr. Jordan added.
