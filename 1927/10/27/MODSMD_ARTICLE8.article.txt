# NEW MODEL FORD CONVERTIBLE COUPE APPEARS WITH RAIN
## 
### 
Rain makes things green and
mushrooms grow, which explains
the phenomenon discovered in
front of the Administration
Building yesterday morning. It
probably belongs to a freshman,
for it couldn't very well have
lasted this long with any of the
unprotected upperclassmen driv
ing it.
It is green—a rich, vivid, un
mistakably green Ford roadster
or, when the occasion demands,
a convertible coupe.
The smart accessory which
does the converting is a large
buff-colored beach umbrella,
which, when fastened in an up
right position, protects the oc
cupants of the car from any in
clemency of the weather and in
addition gives mushroom effect.
