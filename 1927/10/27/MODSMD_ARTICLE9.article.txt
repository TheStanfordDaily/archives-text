# ADMIRAL DECLARES FINANCIAL BENEFITS COME WITH SHIPS
## Merchant Marine Requires Help of Strong Navy, Says Washington 
### Gunnar Norberg 
According to a statement made to
the Daily yesterday, by Rear-Admiral
Thomas Washington, commandant of
the Twelfth Naval District with head
quarters at San Francisco, the navy
serves an important purpose, quite
aside from its infrequent use, when
ever "national emergencies" arise.
"The nation boasting the greatest
number of vessels, flying its flag, can
claim the greatest financial benefits
for its citizens who own and utilize
the carrying power of these ships,
can provide a sure and stable means
for marketing its products, and can
insure an available source of supply
of trained officers and men for its
first line of defense, the navy.
"A preponderance of merchant
ships is assured only to the country
that can guarantee its shipowners a
safe and uninterrupted use of the
trade routes of the world; and, such
guarantee can come only from a gov
ernment that can support its assur
ance by an adequate enforcing agent.
A navy, equal in size and efficiency to
that of any other single power, will
supply the necessary means of main
taining clear trade routes.
"Need Protection and Men"
"Adequate protection on the seas
and the need of an unfailing source
of supply for trained American sea
men, are the two ties which join the
merchant marine and the navy in a
relationship that is indispensable to
the one or the other.
"A merchant marine without a
guardian in the form of a navy of
sufficient power to best the armed
naval force of any other nation in a
clash over the right-of-way on the
seas, can never survive," added Rear-
Admiral Washington.
