# LAW ASSOCIATION WILL ORGANIZE MOOT COURT
## OFFER WINNERS PRIZES Partnerships to Be Formed For Arguing Cases; Use Legal Procedure 
### 
Moot court work, to be carried on
by the Law Association under the
supervision of a moot court board, is
being instituted by the Law School,
according to George N. Crocker, mem
ber of the board. Other members who
were appointed by the law faculty
are Robert M. C. Littler, chairman,
Fred A. Weller, and A. Vernon Green.
Law students will be divided into
two general groups, the first-year men
will form one, and the second- and
third-year men another. Within the
first group clubs or divisions will be
formed, and group and inter-group
discussions will take place.
Form Partnerships
Second- and third-year men will
form partnerships of two, and will
argue cases between partnerships. A
substantial prize will go to the two
winning men at the end of the year.
All arguments will be based on facts
submitted to the groups, and the
points of law involved will be dis
cussed .All material will be chosen
by the faculty. The foru of procedure
observed will be similar to that fol
lowed in an appellate court. Judg
ments will be given by outside attor
neys and judges after listening to the
presentation of arguments.
Adapted o Stanford
This plan for the organization and
work of the morv court was decided
upon after an examination of similar
schemes in operation at law schools
throughout the country. It is believed
to be the best adapted to the condi
tions at Stanford, an dis expected to
fill the need for practical work in the
Law School which is felt at present.
In preparation for this work Dean
Marion Rice Kirkwood will give a
series of four lectures on legal biblio
graphy, beginning Tuesday, Novem
ber 1. The hour of the lectures will be
announced later.
