# Present Flavin's Play Tonight As First Of Season
## 
### 
Under the auspices of Sword and San
dals, "The Lady of the Rose," by Martin
Flavin, the first autumn production on
i the campus under the direction of Miss
Anna May Price, will be presented at
i the Assembly Hall at 8:15 o'clock to
| night. The play marks the beginning of
| a new dramatic season as a play with a
cast including as many new names as
familiar ones, and as a play of entirely
different type and mood than hitherto has
appeared here.
"The Lady of the Rose" sets a prece
dent for the first play of autumn quarter
in containing strong elements of mysti
cism and romance. It is the first play
that has been produced for some time
that has not rounded up with an abso
lutely happy ending.
Cast New to Campus
Although the cast is a comparatively
inexperienced one, the schedule of re
hearsals in the last two weeks has been
heavy, and they have been drilled par
ticularly upon the mood and spirit of
the play. The dress rehearsal last
night promised tones and interpreta
tion of the play of exceptional sensi
tiveness.
Lucy Bentley, a favorite in dramatic
activities, will make her appearance in a
role strongly contrasting with her former
ones. As the lady of dreams and fantasy
she carries a part that requires an amount
of subtlety and artistry in the rendition.
Olga Spirito has the difficult role of of
fering contrast to the delicate qualities of
the Lady, and still retaining charm of
her own.
Howard McCone, as John Meredith,
the lead, makes his debut in campus pro
ductions for the first time. McCone has
had previous experience in the east at
Swarthmore, in Syngc and O'Neil plays,
but is a newcomer to the campus.
Kenneth Funk, Trevelyan; Arthur
Hurt, Lubin; Powell Carpenter, Brain
ard; Bradley Pichel, Pete; Dana Mor
ganson, Dan, complete the cast. From
all indications, the audience promises to
be one of the largest in the history of
Sword and Sandals productions.
