# PALO ALTO STUDENTS PETITION FOR SUBWAY UNDER S.P. CROSSING
## 
### 
The students of Palo Alto Junior
'College passed resolutions Wednes
day asking immediate construction of
a subway under the Embarcadero
crossing of the Southern Pacific tracks
in Palo Alto. Following the tragedy
Wednesday morning, in which Mary
C. Harris was killed and Max Springer
fatally injured when the automobile
in which they were riding was struck
by a southbound train, feeling ran
high in favor of eliminating the cross
ing danger. Both of those in the acci
dent were Palo Alto Junior High stu
dents, and the student body of that
school adjourned for the remainder of
the day in memory of Miss Harris
after passing the resolutions.
Establishment of a subway is hin
dered by the heavy cost it will incur
if work is commenced. More property
will be required, and the tracks of
the railroad will have to be moved
several feet west, according to the
fact-finding committee composed of
Palo Alto officials, members of the
Southern Pacific Company, and the
State Highway Commission.
