Smith Lauds Pianist
Max Smith, the notable musical critic,
lauds Friedman in the following words:
"If you want to be thrilled by the 'Tann
hauser' overture, don't go to concerts of
the philharmonic or symphony societies.
Hear it in the Liszt transcription for
piano as played in Aeolian Hall by Ignaz
Friedman to an audience that went wild
with enthusiasm.
"How he did it the writer is unable
to say. Surely it was not with ten fingers
only that he enunciated those oily violin
passages in clean-cut legato octaves,
while proclaiming sonorously the chant
of the pilgrims.
Artist Called Colossus
"It was stupendous, it was incredible,
what this man accomplished—this torea
dor among pianists, as one listener called
him. For in technical prowess, in the
triumphant victory over mechanical ob
stacles—not of one kind but of all—he
beat every one of his competitors to a
frazzle. I care not whom you mention.
As a master of the black and white clavi
atur I(j)iaz Friedman is a colossus."
