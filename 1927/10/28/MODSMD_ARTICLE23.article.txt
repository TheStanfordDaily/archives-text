# CARDINAL SECOND TEAM WILL OPEN OREGON TILT TOMORROW
## Webfooters to Arrive Today For Light Workout Before Game ROBINSON OREGON STAR Driscoll, Patchett, Frentrup, Fleishhacker Start With Shock Troops 
### Milton Silverman 
With no insult intended, Coach Pop
Warner is starting a composite sec
ond- and third-string team against the
invading Oregon Webfooters. Whether
this eleven will do most of the play
ing, or whether it will serve only as
shock troops against the Northerners,
no one knows, but Pop is evidently
building up strong reserve material
as well as saving his varsity for the
University of Washington Huskies.
Most interesting to many of the
Stanford fans will be the work of
"Bull" Driscoll, whose football his
tory has the scent of a two-reel col
lege picture scenario.
From Grays to Varsity
Driscoll went out for guard at the
beginning of practice this season. Al
though nothing remarkable was no
ticed about his playing, he pulled
down a good job on the fifth or sixth
team. After the first cut of the sea
son, Driscoll found himself looking
for a job, and located it on the Grays.
Under the tutelage of Coach Hal
Davis, "Bull" began to take stock of
his qualifications, and in the St. Mary's
Gray game last Saturday, displayed
these virtues to the discomfiture of
the whole Saint line. Apparently Pop
heard of Driscoll's effect, and gave
the hero of our tale a chance on the
varsity. And now comes the pews that
Driscoll will start against the Web
footers.
