# CARDINAL SECOND TEAM WILL OPEN OREGON TILT TOMORROW
## Webfooters to Arrive Today For Light Workout Before Game ROBINSON OREGON STAR Driscoll, Patchett, Frentrup, Fleishhacker Start With Shock Troops 
### Milton Silverman 
With no insult intended, Coach Pop
Warner is starting a composite sec
ond- and third-string team against the
invading Oregon Webfooters. Whether
this eleven will do most of the play
ing, or whether it will serve only as
shock troops against the Northerners,
no one knows, but Pop is evidently
building up strong reserve material
as well as saving his varsity for the
University of Washington Huskies.
Most interesting to many of the
Stanford fans will be the work of
"Bull" Driscoll, whose football his
tory has the scent of a two-reel col
lege picture scenario.
From Grays to Varsity
Driscoll went out for guard at the
beginning of practice this season. Al
though nothing remarkable was no
ticed about his playing, he pulled
down a good job on the fifth or sixth
team. After the first cut of the sea
son, Driscoll found himself looking
for a job, and located it on the Grays.
Under the tutelage of Coach Hal
Davis, "Bull" began to take stock of
his qualifications, and in the St. Mary's
Gray game last Saturday, displayed
these virtues to the discomfiture of
the whole Saint line. Apparently Pop
heard of Driscoll's effect, and gave
the hero of our tale a chance on the
varsity. And now comes the pews that
Driscoll will start against the Web
footers.
In the backfleld probably will be
Fleishhacker, Patchett, and Frentrup,
the first of the famous sophomores to
land on the varsity. These three have
been playing together for the last few
days, and Pop will doubtlessly let
them cavort together.
Oregon tc Work Out
While the Cardinals have rounded
off their practice, Coach McEwan and
his Oregon gridmen will arrive here
today in time to take a light workout
before the game. The visiting team,
doped to bow once again to the Cardi
nal, will not be at anywhere near
top form for the game.
McEwan has a fine lot of material
this year, most of it experienced, and
he has done a great deal with his men.
Unfortunately he cannot play the
game for them, and until they learn
to act as a team, their chances for
finishing in a respectanle (position
seem slim.
Robinson Is Leader
Like many other coast teams this
year, Oregon plays football only when
one man is in the lineup. Bobby Rob
inson, colored quarterback, is the only
player that instills anything like tight
into the eleven.
A passing attack is Oregon's chance
to get around the Stanford defense,
and many tosses, forward, backward,
and sideways, will start from around
Robinson and Woodie. Experts who
have been watching the Webfooters
practice up at Eugene predict that
this overhead display will bother the
Stanford defense. A similar attack
from another Oregon university did
not seem to trouble the Cards.

ticed about his playing, he pulled
down a good job on the fifth or sixth
team. After the first cut of the sea
son, Driscoll found himself looking
for a job, and located it on the Grays.
Under the tutelage of Coach Hal
Davis, "Bull" began to take stock of
his qualifications, and in the St. Mary's
Gray game last Saturday, displayed
these virtues to the discomfiture of
the whole Saint line. Apparently Pop
heard of Driscoll's effect, and gave
the hero of our tale a chance on the
varsity. And now comes the pews that
Driscoll will start against the Web
footers.
In the backfleld probably will be
Fleishhacker, Patchett, and Frentrup,
the first of the famous sophomores to
land on the varsity. These three have
been playing together for the last few
days, and Pop will doubtlessly let
them cavort together.
Oregon tc Work Out
While the Cardinals have rounded
off their practice, Coach McEwan and
his Oregon gridmen will arrive here
today in time to take a light workout
before the game. The visiting team,
doped to bow once again to the Cardi
nal, will not be at anywhere near
top form for the game.
McEwan has a fine lot of material
this year, most of it experienced, and
he has done a great deal with his men.
Unfortunately he cannot play the
game for them, and until they learn
to act as a team, their chances for
finishing in a respectanle (position
seem slim.
Robinson Is Leader
Like many other coast teams this
year, Oregon plays football only when
one man is in the lineup. Bobby Rob
inson, colored quarterback, is the only
player that instills anything like tight
into the eleven.
A passing attack is Oregon's chance
to get around the Stanford defense,
and many tosses, forward, backward,
and sideways, will start from around
Robinson and Woodie. Experts who
have been watching the Webfooters
practice up at Eugene predict that
this overhead display will bother the
Stanford defense. A similar attack
from another Oregon university did
not seem to trouble the Cards.
With no insult intended, Coach Pop
Warner is starting a composite sec
ond- and third-string team against the
invading Oregon Webfooters. Whether
this eleven will do most of the play
ing, or whether it will serve only as
shock troops against the Northerners,
no one knows, but Pop is evidently
building up strong reserve material
as well as saving his varsity for the
University of Washington Huskies.
Most interesting to many of the
Stanford fans will be the work of
"Bull" Driscoll, whose football his
tory has the scent of a two-reel col
lege picture scenario.
From Grays to Varsity
Driscoll went out for guard at the
beginning of practice this season. Al
though nothing remarkable was no
ticed about his playing, he pulled
down a good job on the fifth or sixth
team. After the first cut of the sea
