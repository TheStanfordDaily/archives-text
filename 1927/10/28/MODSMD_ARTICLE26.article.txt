						Word to Delegates
## 
### 
Stanford will play host today to "perhaps the largest number of visit
ing' press delegates that has ever attended a meeting of the California
Scholastic Press Association. The University welcomes these delegates
and those Stanford professors and students immediately concerned with
the reception will make every effort to make the visit a worthwhile one
to the high-school journalists and their advisers.
To the delegates the greatest benefit from this meeting will come from
exchange of ideas among themselves. They are all concerned with the
problems of high-school publications and, while the University journal
ism faculty and students will attempt to assist them in every way possible,
the value of such conventions as this one lies in opening the eyes of the
delegates to the problems and their solutions offered by other schools.
Formal discussions in round-table groups will take up many problems
such as staff organization, display of news, nature of the editorial, special
columns, capacity of the adviser, and the many questions which business
managers must answer. Such discussions will of necessity be in the
nature of generalities applicable to as many papers as possible.
However, the individual editors and business managers will perhaps
find their greatest benefits coming from informal discussions with dele
gates from other schools. To establish as much contact as possible with
each other is, then, the best advice that the Daily, the journalism faculty,
and students can offer.
