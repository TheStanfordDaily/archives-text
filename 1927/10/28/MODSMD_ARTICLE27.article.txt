When seven substitntes 011 the freshman football team pay their trans
portation and expenses in order to make the trip to U.S.C. with their
team, it's time for someone to ask "Why?"
The General Manager authorized twenty-five to make the trip. He
was absent whe nthe squad left, but apparently included in this allotment
were the coaches, the trainer, and two managers, leaving twenty players
to make the trip. Heretofore, at least twenty-five players have always
gone, and that number has at times proved inadequate.
The varsity took thirty men to Oregon the week-end the freshmen
played U.S.C, and only twenty of them got in the game. The train fare
and expenses of two or three of the men of that squad would have
provided the money needed by the freshman substitutes to make the
southern trip.
The freshmen are future varsity material. Any victories they might
gain over U.S.C. and other well-touted opponents create a psychological
mood. They can't win unless there are enough men on the squad to play
the game properly. Remember that our 20-20 tie with California in 1924
came only after the 1927 players, who won from California for the first
time since we resumed the playing of American football, had advanced
to the varsity. That's an example of the psychology involved. U.S.C. is
sending a squad of thirty-seven to Berkeley this week-end.
It's equalization of the expenditure that is suggested—not necessarily
a further outlay.
