Tonight Anna May Price offers to Stanford tlicater-goers her first
campus production, "The Lady of the Rose," a slightly highbrow play
of which there have been few on the campus in recent years. It is a
drama requiring much intricate work on lighting effects and delicate
shades of interpretation.
Being a play slightly out of the ordinary, its success should be pro
nounced, if it is handled properly. It is a difficult task to come onto the
campus and to pick a cast without knowing beforehand the qualities of
the people with whom one must deal, which leads us to say that Miss
Price is to be commended for undertaking so complicated a presentation
for her opening number.
