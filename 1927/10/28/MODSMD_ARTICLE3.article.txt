# VALUED ALPHABET VANISHES IN WIND; RANSOM IN OFFING
## 
### 
Dramatic Council has lost its
p's and q's and doesn't know
where to find them! A reward of
two balcony seats for the per
formance of "The Lady of the
Rose" will be given to whoever
brings them home. No questions
asked.
The letters were lost when the
council's aerial sign suspended
across Lasuen street at the Post
office was blown down by high
winds. A frantic search has been
conducted for the missing letters
with no result. Thuy are of course
needed for future advertisements,
hence the princely ransom.
Finder may collect the reward
on presentation of the lost mem
bers of the alphabet at the office
of the Dramatic Council in the
Old Union.
