"What Anne Brought Home," at
the President. Playing in its
fourth week and a good comedy
with plenty of laughs.
"Pigs," at the Alcazar. Entering
its fifth week John Golden's in
genious comedy still draws the
crowds.
"The Great Necker," at the
Lurie. It played five months in
Los Angeles and starts its San
Francisco engagement this week.
"My Maryland," at the Curran.
Begins this week and comes from
its smashing success in Phila
delphia.
"The Vortex," at the Columbia.
With Marjorie Rambeau, a sensa
tional comedy drama.
"What Anne Brought Home," at the
President, can be considered good,
clean, wholesome entertainment, and
we guarantee a thoroughly enjoyable
evening. On the other hand, this com
edy has something to offer besides
an immaculate character, and no one
need abstain from viewing this gay
little comedy for fear of having
virtue thrust upon him. Although stain
less, the play is not offensive; con
structive righteousness does not fig
ure among its defects.
In a narrative abounding in homely,
infectious humor it tells what befell
a pleasant, small-town Indiana house
keeper when one of three young
daughters, sent to a neighboring cen
ter to buy her mother two yards of
crepe de chine, brought back a hus
band instead. Although given a job
in his father-in-law's modest shingle
mill, the youth did not do so well.
A dreamer, he caused the family dis
tress through his desire to start a fish
farm. Everything came out splendidly
in the end though; he sold the mill
at a fabulous price to an industrialist
who wanted the site for a power plant
and was not averse to taking a flyer
in the fish hatchery business.

Awakening suddenly from a long
summer's hibernation, the Theatre
will cavort about this week in a man
ner suspiciously vernal. We will have
to forgive the torpor of the preceding
months. "The Great Necker" and "My
Maryland" ring the bell this week,
and they are both as different as
shows might be. The former deals

with a pet art and damns morals,
while the other gives us a chance to
see how people acted nearly three
quarters of a century ago.
These are the two shows that are
toying with us now. There is some
thing so very special about going to
see a play dealing with the tender
physiology of marriage and sexology,
even though it is done in a perfectly
legitimate fashion —and I've heard
that "The Great Necker" is. I'm not
speaking of the lone female in the
seat beside you, who, slyly, persistent
ly seems to be getting more out of it
than you are. The whole air is dif
ferent. The snappiest humor and cate
gorical Imperativeness of a theatre
crowd is in this show; the jolly
warmth of their minds —all that is
there. There is no contagion in the
audience —they slink in aimlessly as
if ashamed or thinking of something
else. Evidently an altruist of some
sort brings light to the unenlightened.
But; if anything can break down the
barriers and give people a good time,
generally it is the discussion of seri
ous problems in a farce manner —wit-
ness the success of "The Great
Necker."
Well, anyway, here we are, in an
other show. "My Maryland," and this
comes from Philadelphia. An oper
etta, always granting the fine and
novel flavor, which struck me as so-so.
Here is the playing with an interest
ing idea —romance in the Civil War,
probably claiming success on the
musical hits. The music is along the
lines of "The Student Prince" with a
large chorus, and it is a chaste and
entertaining operetta, withfrtwo hours
and a half of highly successful amuse
ment.
You can't make too many asser
tions to the college public about
shows, because they have already
heard of "The Great Necker" while
possibly ten per cent have already
heard vague mutterings about "My
Maryland." Much mechanical ingenu
ity accompanied by intellectual inep
titude will draw crowds to "The
Great Necker," rather than listen to
a lecture 011 the sex life of a newt
or the habits of soft-shelled crabs,
and marvel about the humor of it.
