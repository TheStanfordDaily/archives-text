# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
If, as explained in a University an
nouncement in Tuesday's Daily, no stu
dent organization is permitted to invite
a public speaker to address a public
gathering under its auspices without first
securing the permission of the Committee
on Public Exercises, and, if the Commit
tee on Public Exercises is opposed to
granting audience to only one side of a
controversial subject, why don't the As
sociated Students of Stanford University
secure the necessary permission to invite
both Judge Ben B. Lindsey and Rabbi
Louis I. Newman to give a debate in the
Assembly Hall on "Companionate Mar
riage" ?
Stanford, if our motto of "Die Luft
Der Freiheit Weht" is to be taken seri
ously, is the logical place for such a
discussion. As one of the greatest uni
versities in the United States and a
leader in thought and the fostering of
an open-minded attitude, it should be its
duty to provide authentic information on
such a popular and important question.
Everyone on the campus has read and
formed some opinion of companionate
marriage, but few know what Judge
Lindsey means. The average opinion
seems to be that he is extremely radical,
advocating "free love" and "trial mar
riage," and we are interested in correct
ing that erroneous impression. The ques
tion is difficult to understand clearly and
such opinions formed on hearsay and
sensational newspaper reports arc unfair
to a man like Judge Lindsey.
Ilis reputation as the judge of the
juvenile court of Denver for twenty
seven years is both national and inter
national in scope. He is not a sensation
alist but is trying to preach a doctrine of
common sense and education. The least
that can be done is to give him a chance
to present his opinions, backed as they I
arc by his knowledge and experience.
Rabbi Newman is also well known and |
is at the present time participating in a i
series of debates with Judge Lindsey j
here on the coast on the subject of "Com-1
panionatc Marriage." Rabbi Newman is 1
recognized as one of the leading thinkers \
in the West and has contributed numer- '
nus articles to San Francisco newspapers. !
He has spoken several times in the Me
morial Church at Stanford, each occa
sion bringing out a larger audience than
the previous one.
Those who have heard Judge Lindsey I

and Rabbi Newman want to hear them
again, and those who haven't, should.
This is an appeal to the common sense
and fair play for which Stanford is
justly famous. We want information
and authoritative opinion, and now is the
time for action while Judge Lindsey and
his able opponent, Rabbi Newman, are
so close to us.

on Public Exercises, and, if the Commit
tee on Public Exercises is opposed to
granting audience to only one side of a
controversial subject, why don't the As
sociated Students of Stanford University
secure the necessary permission to invite
both Judge Ben B. Lindsey and Rabbi
Louis I. Newman to give a debate in the
Assembly Hall on "Companionate Mar
riage" ?
Stanford, if our motto of "Die Luft
Der Freiheit Weht" is to be taken seri
ously, is the logical place for such a
discussion. As one of the greatest uni
versities in the United States and a
leader in thought and the fostering of
an open-minded attitude, it should be its
duty to provide authentic information on
such a popular and important question.
Everyone on the campus has read and
formed some opinion of companionate
marriage, but few know what Judge
Lindsey means. The average opinion
seems to be that he is extremely radical,
advocating "free love" and "trial mar
riage," and we are interested in correct
ing that erroneous impression. The ques
tion is difficult to understand clearly and
such opinions formed on hearsay and
sensational newspaper reports arc unfair
to a man like Judge Lindsey.
Ilis reputation as the judge of the
juvenile court of Denver for twenty
seven years is both national and inter
national in scope. He is not a sensation
alist but is trying to preach a doctrine of
common sense and education. The least
that can be done is to give him a chance
to present his opinions, backed as they I
arc by his knowledge and experience.
Rabbi Newman is also well known and |
is at the present time participating in a i
series of debates with Judge Lindsey j
here on the coast on the subject of "Com-1
panionatc Marriage." Rabbi Newman is 1
recognized as one of the leading thinkers \
in the West and has contributed numer- '
nus articles to San Francisco newspapers. !
He has spoken several times in the Me
morial Church at Stanford, each occa
sion bringing out a larger audience than
the previous one.
Those who have heard Judge Lindsey I

and Rabbi Newman want to hear them
again, and those who haven't, should.
This is an appeal to the common sense
and fair play for which Stanford is
justly famous. We want information
and authoritative opinion, and now is the
time for action while Judge Lindsey and
his able opponent, Rabbi Newman, are
so close to us.
