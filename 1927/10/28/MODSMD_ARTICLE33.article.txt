The Editor, Sir:
We believe that an opportunity has
been missed, for surprisingly few Stan
ford students went to Burlingame Mon
day evening to hear Judge Lindsey speak
in the interest of delinquent children.
Student attendance would have been bet
ter if more publicity had been given the
address, for many did not know until
too late that Lindsey had been near.
We do not believe that these few were
truly representative of the interest the
campus really has in such a man as
Judge Lindsey or in the subjects on
which he is an authority. However, there
is still time to invite him to speak on the
campus, and there is every assurance that
such a lecturc would be well attended.
