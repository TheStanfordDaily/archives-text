I am simply thrilled to death. The
convention of the California Interscho
lastic Press Association is going to be on
the campus today. There are one hundred
women coming and two hundred men.
Isn't it wonderful?
And 1 know that every one is going to
have a wonderful time. I mean there are
so many exciting things going to happen,
such as staying on the Row and in the
halls of a real college, I know the young
high-school people are going to be so
impressed, because the students here al
ways make such a thrilling impression
011 strangers. 1 mean they are so unique
in their appearance and attitude.
And I can hardly wait to show some of
them the sights and points of interest on
the campus. No one must be allowed to
overlook the darling little benches in the
center of the tree circles of the inner
quad. And I hope there will 'be a lot
of artists in their bright-colored smocks
out drawing the arches. They give such
a delightful atmosphere to the University.
And of course they must have the ex
perience of looking at the famous dating
bureau, it is such an immense building.
I am really beginning to feel the im
portance of being in a University when
I am allowed the privilege of entertain
ing the Press Convention. I mean it is
such a responsibility to see that every
one sees everything from the right point
of view, because you know that the high
school students are so impressionable.
