# TWO GIANT BONFIRES WILL BE BUILT FOR WASHINGTON RALLY
## 
### 
To prove to the campus that the Rally
Committee is well fitted to supervise
construction of the Big Game bonfire,
members of the committee will vie with
members of the freshman rally commit
tee during the next week in building two
enormous pyres at the Engineering cor
ner for the Washington send-off rally.
Construction work will begin from
scratch at 7 :45 o'clock Monday morning
and end at 12 o'clock noon Wednesday.
The huge stacks will be touched off at
2 o'clock Wednesday when the rooters
gather for the rally at the Engineering
corner.
Stunts will be presented while the au
dience is judging the merits of the two
fires, and a parade will follow to the
Palo Alto dpeot, where the team will
entrain north at 3 o'clock.
Both committees will try hard to break
the all-time All-American record set by
the Class of '28 when it built an S2-foot
pyre for the 1924 Big Game. Fire Chief
Dugan is expected to issue a warning or
dering all machines away from the vi
cinity Wednesday because of the danger
from falling embers.
