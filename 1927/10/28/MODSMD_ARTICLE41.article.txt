# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Versatility is always interesting. That's
why athletes lie Jim Thorpe, Ernie Nev
ers, George Lott, and Eric Pedley have
so popular an appeal. They are good at
more than one sport—sometimes shine at
three or four—therefore, they stand out
above their brethren in athletics who can
merely do one thing well.
The Syracuse University football team
boasts of two versatile performers, one
of whom is the captain, Ray Barbuti,
who plays full-back. Ray was a familiar
figure during the indoor and outdoor
track season, as he dashed around the
board or cinder ovals of the East wear
ing the silks of the Salt City institution's
track team. Barbuti was a member of
the Syracuse mile-relay team that cap
tured both intercollegiate one-mile relay
championships this year.
When the IC4A meet was held last
May at Franklin Field, one of the favor
ites to win the 440-yard dash was Cecil
Cooke, also of Syracuse, giant negro
athlete and a former national champion.
But when the race was run, Cooke was
not even among the first three, while Ray
Barbuti, running the race of his life,
captured the bronze medal that goes with
third place. Ray can step a quarter in
less than 49 seconds, and run a furlong
in less than 22, so it is no wonder that he
is as fast as greased lightning on the
football field.
Jacob Patterson, one of the big Syra
cuse tackles, is another versatile fellow.
He is intercollegiate heavyweight wrest

ling champion, and uses his great strength
and powerful hands to bowl over his op
ponents on the gridiron. Jake was with :
the Marines during the World War, spent
seventeen months overseas, and was j
wounded. So what's a mere football i
game or wrestling match to him?
Syracuse plays Nebraska Saturday, and J
Barbuti and Patterson will be up against j
the strongest team they have faced this |
year.
