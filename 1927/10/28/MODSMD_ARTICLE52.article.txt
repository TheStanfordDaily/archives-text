GREAT SOCIAL PROBLEMS
It has been the custom of this
, column to devote itself strictly to
observations of men's athletics,
giving the activities which go on
at Roble gym a wide berth. But,
iured and enticed by the coura
i geous editorial crusade to abolish
the billowing bloomer from the
precincts of that temple of physi
cal development, we shall today
burst our shell of reticence and,
as Mr. Frisgy would say, take the
I matter straight to the people.
The athlete is clothed essen
i tially for protection: protection
from the public gaze in the track
suit, and from knocks and tum
bles of the gridiron by the padded
football suit. Why, then, does the
Stanford woman who disports her
self at hockey, tennis, or other
I sober sports, have to be protected
even from conjecture by rompers
inside of which, as was said of the
girl's costume in "The Fair Co-ed,"
she could turn a somersault?
Turning from the ridiculous to
the more ridiculous, it seems as
if the movie of college life might
offer the solution of this problem
of raiment. Marion Davies and her
teammates in "The Fair Co-ed"
showed that an intelligently de
signed suit, consisting of a sweat
shirt and shorts, will do wonders
toward making a girls' basketball
game exciting, while before we
had thought one about as thrilling
as croquet
Perhaps women's competitive
athletics at which the other half
might look on would develop and
flourish if these immense pairs of
tangled parachutes could be re
placed by shorts and jerseys.
A well set up man takes pride
in adorning himself in a football
or track suit, and presumably a
woman likes the flattery a bath
ing suit does her. Why will the
same woman, when she exercises,
consent to wear as much as, or
more than, she does at any other
time? Perhaps she likes the con
trast afforded when she does don
her bathing suit in the summer.
