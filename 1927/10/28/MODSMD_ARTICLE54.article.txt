# CHALLENGER FOR COAST TITLE WILL BE DETERMINED BY RESULT OF CALIFORNIATROJAN GAME IN LOS ANGELES COLISEUM
## Rivals Meet in Southland for First Time Since 1923 Argument 
### 
One challenger for Stanford's Pacific j
Coast Conference football title will be j
boosted into the limelight and another J
definitely eliminated in the Los Angeles !
Coliseum tomorrow, when the Golden |
Bears invade the southland for the first;
time since 1923, for a tilt with the S.C. |
Trojans.
Neither team has had a defeat this •
year, although the Thundering Herd was i
held to a 13-to-13 tie with the Rcdshirts,
and the winner will have a good chance
to take the coast title. If, however, Cali
fornia comes out on top and then loses
to Stanford in the Big Game, the Bears :
and Trojans will end the season in a tie. ■,
Two of the best backfields on the;
coast will fight out ball-carrying honors.!
Nibs Price can boast of better teamwork !
in the backfield, but Coach Howard Jones i
can furnish a one-man backfield that will |
be deadly to the Bears.
With such an array of stars as Benny 1
Lom, Lee Eisan, Brick Marcus, Ralph j
Dougery, Clymer, Lane, Gill, Brecken- \
ridge, and Cockburn, California has anj
outfit in the backfield such as has not
been wearing the Blue and Gold for many
years.
Morley Drury, Trojan captain, will
again try to do all the sensational playing
for the Southerners. Football critics,
however, claim that the S.C. half rose
to his greatest heights against Stanford,
and his playing for the season, by com
parison, will be disappointing.
The Trojans' strength in the line will
again be centered around Jesse Hibbs at
guard. Hibbs, on the other hand, the
critics say, has not yet played his best,
and will make life miserable for the
Californians.
