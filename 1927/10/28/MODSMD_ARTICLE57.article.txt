# EASTERN TEAMS SET FOR IMPORTANT GRID STRUGGLES SATURDAY
## Yale Faces Dartmouth; Irish Football Men Take on Georgia Tech 
### 
The Yale-Dartmouth clash in the Yale j
Bowl Saturday is going to be a battle
that will keep the gamblers guessing till
the game is over. Dartmouth is one of
the four great teams leading Eastern |
football, with five victories and no de- !
feats. So far, they have run up more j
than 200 points to their opponents' 20, |
| which shows their scoring power. Tad
i Jones's Yale eleven came back from an
i early season defeat to wallop the Army l
i last week. Dartmouth has not been as
| severely tested as Yale, Harvard proving
! too much of a set-up a week ago. Yale
! is strong on defense, while the Green has
| been depending on a patent offense to j
| overcome its opponents.
The Notre Dame-Georgia Tech game
' is a tough affair for Knute Rockne. The
boys from the famous Tech have been
cleaning up the South, last week beating
Alabama, two-year confercnce winners.
Harvard Meets Indiana
Harvard-Indiana intersectional fracas j
will be a game between last week's losers.
As an intersectional affair, it will not
prove Eastern or Western strength.
Princeton will take on William and
Mary in a contest which ought to boost
Nassau's average. Princeton has lost no
games and is out to hold its lead. New
York University, which with Dartmouth
stands out among eastern teams, will go
against Colgate at New York in a game
that looks like New York's since Col
gate's defeat at the hands of Wabash.
The Army will go against Bucknell,
which has four victories and no defeats
to its credit. The Cadets have a power
ful team this year and should make good
against their opponents.
Illini Clash with Michigan
In the midwest Illinois, which upset
j Northwestern last week, will go up
against Michigan, Big Ten Conference
I leaders. Illinois' victory was well earned
| and another surprise may be due this
week. The charging Gophers from Min-!
nesota will attempt to put away the Badg
ers from Wisconsin Saturday. Pepped I
up with their big victory last week over j
' lowa, they expect to continue winning.!

â–  Brown vs. Temple, Cornell vs. Columbia,!
Nebraska vs. Syracuse, Northwestern vs. i
J Missouri, Penn State vs. Lafayette, Pur
i due vs. Mont. State.
