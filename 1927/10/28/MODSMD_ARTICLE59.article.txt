# Rules To Govern Basketball Next Season Altered
## 
### 
Announcement of important changes in |
the basketball rules which will operate
during the coming season has been re
ceived by Husky Hunt, varsity basket
ball coach. The regulations were drawn
up by the Joint Basketball Rules Com
mittee and are, in condensed form, as
follows:
1. Time is to be taken out on all fouls,
the watch to be stopped at the instant the
foul is called until (a) in the case of
technical fouls, the ball is tossed up at
center; (b) in the case of personal fouls,
whether calling for a single or a multiple
free-throw, the ball is placed at the
disposal of the free-thrower on the free
throw line for the first free-throw. In
the latter case, the referee will signal
with his hand or otherwise, that the
watch.is to be started. On double fouls
time will be resumed when the ball is
tossed up at ccnter as formerly.
2. In order to avoid confusion when
the officials designate with their fingers
the number of free-throws on a foul,
teams are asked not to use number one
and two, and to avoid further confusion
the whistle is not to be blown when the
ball is tossed up.
3. When a player dribbles and throws
for goal, he may recover th<b ball and
dribble again after the ball has touched
the basket or backboard. Also if the
bail is batted out of the hands of a
player who has completed a dribble, the
player may dribble again.
4. On a jump-ball, if the ball drops
without being tapped by either jumper,
it shall be tossed up again even though
one player catches it before it reaches
the floor. This is not to be interpreted
as permitting a player to jump and catch
the ball.
As was decided at the annual meeting
of the Joint Basketball Rules Committee
in April, the dribble will remain limited
to a single bounce of any length.
