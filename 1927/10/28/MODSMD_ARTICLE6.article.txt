Noboru Foujioka, whose paintings arc
being exhibited in the Stanford Art Gal
lery until November 8, is regarded by
many lovers of art in New York as one
of the most promising Japanese artists
of the present time. He is a member of
the Society of Independent Artists of
New York.
Foujioka first attracted attention in
Tokyo, where he studied in the Japa
nese Art School. He then came to the
Portland Art School, where he first came
under the influence of American vast
ness and magnitude which he has been
able to incorporate so well in his work.
After spending some time in study in
New York, the artist studied for two
years under Otton-Frieze and Guerin,
leaders of the French modern school.
He became a master of weight and sim
plicity, two characteristics which make
his paintings notable. His portrayals in
dicate a strong sense of humor and
satire. For example, "A Country Home"
is pictured surrounded by telephone wires
and a conspicuous signboard.
A. B. Clark, head of the Stanford Art
Department, says that Foujioka has fresh
vision, is not academic in his work, and
that his art is not extreme, but is very
good drawing.
