# INTERCLASS GRIDIRON TUSSLES SLATED FOR TOMORROW MORNING
## Seniors Given Slight Edge Over Junior Eleven; '30, '31 Are Even 
### 
While the freshman-sophomore inter
; class football struggle is taking place on
i the field tomorrow morning, the scnior-
I junior game will he fought out on the
i freshman field. The games will both
j start at 9:00 o'clock sharp, Charles W.
Davis, director of intramural and inter
j class sports, announced last night.
Because the seniors are allowed to
i play graduate students and hold-overs,
| they arc given a slight edge over the
junior squad. The 1927 men have prac
, tically a complete backfield which has
played in previous seasons, as well as
j several men with varsity experience.
! Their plays are largely those of the
| Warner system, and in addition they have
| an unusually heavy line.
Brown Expected to Star
Starring for the senior squad will be
| Brown at quarter, who is also coach,
J Lloyd, considered the best punter on the
1 interclass teams, and King, with several
! seasons of interclass play to his credit,
j The sophomore - freshman interclass
teams will tangle after three weeks of
j practice in an effort to determine the
I superiors in the Lower Division. Both
| teams are light and lack the experience
of the upperclassmen, but will put up
i a good battle because of their evenness
! of ability.
Coach Joe Oeschgcr of the frosh scrim
maged his team against Charles Davis'
second-year men Wednesday night in a
pre-game practice. Most of the frosh
' plays center around Henry, but Oeschger
! plans on using two complete backfields
I in the game.
Davis has a heavier backfield with
I Stanley, Northrup, and Koster as ball
1 carriers. Clarke at end is a new addi
tion to the team in the last week. Prisin
zano at tackle is one of the sophomores'
best bets to break up the frosh plays.
