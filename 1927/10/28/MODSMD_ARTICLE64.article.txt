# CONTENDERS FOR P.C. CONFERENCE HONORS TO PLAY HARD GAMES
## Stanford-Oregon, Bear-U.S.C. Contests Overshadow Rest in Interest 
### Stanley Mullin 
Saturday's Pacific Coast Conference
games are likely to decide this year's
title, with the U.S.C.-California game
holding the limelight. If California wins,
only admittedly weaker teams stand in
its way before the Big Game, whereas if
U.S.C. wins, the title might be disputed
with Stanford because of its tie game.
The Stanford-Oregon game will deter
mine whether or not Stanford will keep
her slate clean. Defeat is not expected,
but another stiff test is assured.
In the north, Washington State College
land Oregon State meet in gridiron'com
bat for the first time since 1924. At that
time the Orangemen won from the Cou
gars 14 to 13. In the meantime the Cou
gars have obtained a new coach, "Babe"
Hollingberry, who put them in a tie
for third place in the conference last year.
The game will have added attraction
with the meeting of Howard Maple and
Butch Meeker, the rival quarterbacks
for the Orangemen and Cougars. Both
are possibilities for all-coast quarter.
Maple showed up well against Stanford
last week, while throughout the North
west Meeker is outstanding for honors.
So far, W.S.C. has lost to Washington
and won from Montana, while Oregon
State has lost to Stanford and U.S.C.,
both conference leaders.
Washington will have an easy week
end with Whitman College, and Mon
tana will take on Mines. Both are non
conference games but will have much to
contribute to the development of con
ference players.
