# INTEREST CENTERS ON LITTLE BIG GAME CHANCES AS FRESHMEN TAKE ON SANTA BARBARA J.C. TOMORROW IN PRLIMINARY
## St. Mary's Yearlings Say Cards Are Better Than California Babes

Husky Hunt's freshmen will meet
i Santa Barbara Junior College in the
. Stadium tomorrow, but interest in year-
Ming football now centers mainly around
| the impending trouble with U.C.'s babes
| the next week-end.
It is probable, of course, that the '31
j Cards will come through for a victory to
morrow against the collegians, but it is
a different matter, however, next week,
j Coaches, players, and dopesters are all
; figuring the angles to discover just what
' chance the freshmen have against CalU
fornia.
The strength of the Bears is an es
tablished fact. They have come through
| the season undefeated with an outfit of
I youngsters which is the best seen at Ber
j keley in years. The Cards, orf the other
hand, have small basis for cocksureness.
Their record thus far has been, from the
standpoint of cold figures, far from suc
cessful. Hunt has been working all sea
-1 son under the disadvantage of only a
small reserve force.
There is another side to the matter,
however, which causes dopesters to re
frain from hanging crepe on the Stanford
goal posts prematurely. Those who have
[carefully watched the outfit's progress
1 through the season, and saw its work
! against St. Mary's and U.S.C., give the
[ Babes a chance.
Members of the Saint squad, which
j met both Stanford and California, did
not hesitate to call the Cards a better
team in spite of the fact that U.C. beat
! the Oak landers. The punch and power
| of Hunt's eleven was superior to that of
the young Trojans last Saturday as
long as the full first string stayed on
i the field. It was the big injured list
which beat 1931.
