UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, Oct.
27. — (I.P.) —Approximately one out of
every six students at the University
of Michigan works to help meet finan
cial expenses while at college. The
number of students working this year
is slightly higher than former years
due possibly to the poor industrial
conditions.
