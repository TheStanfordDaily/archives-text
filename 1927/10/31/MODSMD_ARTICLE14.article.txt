# JUNIORS, FRESHMEN WIN IN INTERCLASS FOOTBALL CONTESTS
## 
### 
Defeating supposedly stronger
teams, the junior and freshman inter
class football squads came out vic
torious in their games Saturday morn
ing against the senior and sophomore
squads.
In a game featuring fumbles, and a
decidedly weak line, the senior inter
class squad lost by a 2-0 score to the
junior class aggregation.
The junior team's victory was due
principally to its consistently good
line.
Putting over a touchdown after a
drive from the middle of the field in
the second quarter the freshmen won
over the sophomores in a well-fought
6 to 0 victory.
The sophomores failed to get going
until the last part of the second quar
ter. During the third and fourth quar
ters the teams fought back and forth
on the field, several fumbles causing
the ball to change hands at inoppor
tune times.
