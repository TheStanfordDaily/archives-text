# Audience Receives Play Unfavorably
## 
### H. K 
An unusually large house was the
chief feature of the Sword and San
dals production of "The Lady of the
Rose" Friday night. This was un
doubtedly a compliment to Miss Anna
May Price, on her first campus dra
matic production.
It was also undoubtedly out of com
pliment to Miss Price that the large
audience remained through the play.
As a rule, Stanford audience have not
yet been educated up to the point
where casual mentions of moonlight
on Moroccan deserts are assimilated
with ease, nor are they accustomed to
seeing "wine" poured from ginger ale
bottles.
Some Good V/ork
Disregarding the unfortunate choice
of the play itself, and considering the
pressure of time under which the
cast worked, there were however a
few surprising pieces of Rood work.
The first scene dragged with bad light
ing in evidence. The second scene was
amusing, more coherent, and gave
some hope that there was a plot to
the play somewhere. The second and
third acts were better, by contrast,
through the work of Howard McCone
and Arthur Hurt.
McCone, as John Meredith, main
tained as consistent a characterization
as anyone under thirty-five years of
age could throughout the play. He I
had a good voice, and convincingly |
I bit his knuckles at moments of har
! rowing emotional stress, though he
j did use his hands too much. His mono
logue at the end of the second act
was as fine as could he done —with
that play.
Lighting Bad
Lucie Bentley, as the lady of the :
rose, managed to do fairly well in the
matter of interpretation of such a
role. Unfortunately the lighting effects
with her appearance and disappear
ance were so disconcerting with their
eccentricities, that she was at a great
disadvantage.
Olga Spirito, as Lorraine, the wife,
was decidedly uneven. She had per
haps the most unconvincing role in i
the play. Kenneth Funk as Trevelyan,
showed a surprising amount of stage
presence, considering his inexperi
ence, and gives promise for the future.
Both Lorraine and Trevelyan picked
up their cues so fast throughout the
entire play that a decided feeling of
pressure and hurry resulted. Others,
however, did not pick up their cues
fast enough.
Arthur Hurt was perhaps the most j
pleasing of the lot. He was an amus- i
ing director, every inch, even to his j
moustache quivering with tempera- [
ment. Dana Morganson, prop man, or j
Dan, and Lubin shared the honors for j
comedy relief, and got by far the best |
hands from the audience —even when j
no comedy on their parts was in- j
tended. Powell Carpenter, as Brain
erd, maintained his part creditably,
and was as stupid and good-looking as
the author himself could wish.

Leslie Kiler, technical director,
came through with some of the best
looking sets that have appeared on
the campus for some time. The scene
of John Meredith's study was us som
ber, sinister, and rich-looking us
promised.
Unfortunately, due to a little mis
understanding in the minds of most
of the audience as to what in the
world the play was about, the tone
of the sets and the uncunny way the
j lights went down and stayed down
I until there was time enough to com
mit three murders, most of us spent
the entire evening waiting for a bat or
gorilla to appear—or a dead body at
least to fall out of the panelled walls.

amusing, more coherent, and gave
some hope that there was a plot to
the play somewhere. The second and
third acts were better, by contrast,
through the work of Howard McCone
and Arthur Hurt.
McCone, as John Meredith, main
tained as consistent a characterization
as anyone under thirty-five years of
age could throughout the play. He I
had a good voice, and convincingly |
I bit his knuckles at moments of har
! rowing emotional stress, though he
j did use his hands too much. His mono
logue at the end of the second act
was as fine as could he done —with
that play.
Lighting Bad
Lucie Bentley, as the lady of the :
rose, managed to do fairly well in the
matter of interpretation of such a
role. Unfortunately the lighting effects
with her appearance and disappear
ance were so disconcerting with their
eccentricities, that she was at a great
disadvantage.
Olga Spirito, as Lorraine, the wife,
was decidedly uneven. She had per
haps the most unconvincing role in i
the play. Kenneth Funk as Trevelyan,
showed a surprising amount of stage
presence, considering his inexperi
ence, and gives promise for the future.
Both Lorraine and Trevelyan picked
up their cues so fast throughout the
entire play that a decided feeling of
pressure and hurry resulted. Others,
however, did not pick up their cues
fast enough.
Arthur Hurt was perhaps the most j
pleasing of the lot. He was an amus- i
ing director, every inch, even to his j
moustache quivering with tempera- [
ment. Dana Morganson, prop man, or j
Dan, and Lubin shared the honors for j
comedy relief, and got by far the best |
hands from the audience —even when j
no comedy on their parts was in- j
tended. Powell Carpenter, as Brain
erd, maintained his part creditably,
and was as stupid and good-looking as
the author himself could wish.

Leslie Kiler, technical director,
came through with some of the best
looking sets that have appeared on
the campus for some time. The scene
of John Meredith's study was us som
ber, sinister, and rich-looking us
promised.
Unfortunately, due to a little mis
understanding in the minds of most
of the audience as to what in the
world the play was about, the tone
of the sets and the uncunny way the
j lights went down and stayed down
I until there was time enough to com
mit three murders, most of us spent
the entire evening waiting for a bat or
gorilla to appear—or a dead body at
least to fall out of the panelled walls.
An unusually large house was the
chief feature of the Sword and San
dals production of "The Lady of the
Rose" Friday night. This was un
doubtedly a compliment to Miss Anna
May Price, on her first campus dra
matic production.
It was also undoubtedly out of com
pliment to Miss Price that the large
audience remained through the play.
As a rule, Stanford audience have not
yet been educated up to the point
where casual mentions of moonlight
on Moroccan deserts are assimilated
with ease, nor are they accustomed to
seeing "wine" poured from ginger ale
bottles.
Some Good V/ork
Disregarding the unfortunate choice
of the play itself, and considering the
pressure of time under which the
cast worked, there were however a
few surprising pieces of Rood work.
The first scene dragged with bad light
ing in evidence. The second scene was
amusing, more coherent, and gave
some hope that there was a plot to
the play somewhere. The second and
