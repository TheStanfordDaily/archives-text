A hard-hitting, smooth-working
: Cardinal eleven advanced one more
: step in wiping out the blemish o£
I Stanford's early-season third-rate per
i formances by decisively beating the
University of Oregon in the stadium
Saturday.
I Pop Warner used his second varsity
| almost exclusively, but the Northern
ers were completely outclassed. Ore
gon threatened tlie Stanford goal only
once when a series of passes in the
| fourth quarter placed the ball within
j six yards of a score.
Two Scores Made
Two touchdowns were made by the
winners in the second period. The
first came when Mason fumbled
| Frentrup's punt five yards from Ore
| gon's goal, and Muller recovered.
I Fleishhacker pounded the opposing
line for four yards in two plays, and
i Frentrup put the oval across over left
tackle. Murphy converted for the ex
tra point.
A few plays later the Cardinals
began a march at the center of the
field which ended in the second tally.
A deluge of bucks and passes backed
the blue team onto its own two-yard
mark. Joseph hit left tackle for the
touchdown. Murphy's kick failed.
Another drive from Stanford's 45-
yard line in the third period netted
the final score of the game. Frentrup
tossed a short pass to Muller who
dashed ten yards for the additional
six points. Murphy again failed to
convert.
Passing Good
This Frentrup to Muller aerial com
bination worked smothly Saturday,
completing four passes. In all Stan
ford was successful in seven out of
ten attempts to gain by the overhead
route.
