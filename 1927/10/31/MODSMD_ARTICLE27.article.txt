# CARD SECOND STRING VARSITY SWAMPS OREGON ELEVEN 19-0
## Muller Recovers Fumble on Five-Yard Line for Initial Tally LUD FRENTRUP STARS Visitors Threaten Stanford Goal Only in Fourth Period of Game 
### Bob Speers 
A hard-hitting, smooth-working
: Cardinal eleven advanced one more
: step in wiping out the blemish oÂ£
I Stanford's early-season third-rate per
i formances by decisively beating the
University of Oregon in the stadium
Saturday.
I Pop Warner used his second varsity
| almost exclusively, but the Northern
ers were completely outclassed. Ore
gon threatened tlie Stanford goal only
once when a series of passes in the
| fourth quarter placed the ball within
j six yards of a score.
Two Scores Made
Two touchdowns were made by the
winners in the second period. The
first came when Mason fumbled
| Frentrup's punt five yards from Ore
| gon's goal, and Muller recovered.
I Fleishhacker pounded the opposing
line for four yards in two plays, and
i Frentrup put the oval across over left
tackle. Murphy converted for the ex
tra point.
A few plays later the Cardinals
began a march at the center of the
field which ended in the second tally.
A deluge of bucks and passes backed
the blue team onto its own two-yard
mark. Joseph hit left tackle for the
touchdown. Murphy's kick failed.
Another drive from Stanford's 45-
yard line in the third period netted
the final score of the game. Frentrup
tossed a short pass to Muller who
dashed ten yards for the additional
six points. Murphy again failed to
convert.
Passing Good
This Frentrup to Muller aerial com
bination worked smothly Saturday,
completing four passes. In all Stan
ford was successful in seven out of
ten attempts to gain by the overhead
route.
The Webfooters came south bring
ing with them what was alleged to be
a dangerous air game, and two col
ored boys who were rated as being
very hard to stop. Either the Red
shirts were too much on their toes
or the northern passers and runners
were having a bad day. At any rate,
neither of these threats did very much
threatening.
Reports brought down from the
California-Oregon contest a couple of
weeks ago said considerable concern
ing the strength of the northern
team. They didn't show a noticeable
amount of power Saturday, however,
and Stanford's victory was so com
plete that the less said about the Ore
gon angle of the game the better.
Frentrup Stars
There was a work-horse in the
Cardinal backfield. That individual
was Lud Frentrup, so-called second
string halfback. It is hard to find a
play in which this Berkeley lad did
not have his hand. He passed, he
punted, he the line, lie skirted ends
in rapid succession, and lie did them
all well enough to satisfy the most
exacting critic. On defense his tack
ling was sure.
There has been a great deal of
head-shaking, and many worried looks
this season when the matter of Stan
ford ends has been mentioned. A cer
tain Mr. Muller has been spoken of
before, but he deserves noticing
again, for it was his performance at

the wing job which makes this busi
ness of Cardinal ends look less dark.
Play Steady Game
These two aren't the only "second :
raters" whose work looked like first- 1
string playing should look. Fleish- ]
hacker maintained the tradition lie j
established against the Trojans by
supplying a pile-driver punch when a
few yards were needed. Joseph, who !
replaced him, continued the pounding, '
and Little Mike Murphy, whose hectic ,
football career has been the subject |
of endless discussion, played an even, I
heady game. He didn't carry the ball ,
much, but he delivered the goods i
when called upon, and gave the run
ners plenty of support.
The playing of the Redshirt line
was not spectacular in the way of in
dividual stars, but no Stanford for- j
ward wall this season has functioned J
more smoothly and effectively than j
the one did Saturday.
The Oregon game did two very im- j
portant things besides chalking up i
another victory. It proved beyond a !
doubt that Warner has a practically
unlimited force of substitutes who
can carry on in any emergency, and
besides that it saved the first string
from any risk of injury that might
hurt its ability to present an unbroken
front to the University of Washing
ton next week. ,
