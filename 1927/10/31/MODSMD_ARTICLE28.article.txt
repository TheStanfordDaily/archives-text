"How can democracy operate if the
newspapers, our only source of infor
mation, won't give us the truth?"
challenged Chester H. Rowell at the
assembly held Friday in honor of the
California Interscholastic Press Asso
ciation convention. His message to
the young journalists stressed the im
portance of the press in shaping
political and popular thought.
"Three challenges face democracy
today," said the lecturer, "Lenin, Mus
solini, and Big Bill Thompson, mayor
of Chicago. life who fears bolshevism
is dreaming nightmares. Mussolini is
a real problem. He puts out a good
business government, judged by our
standards; but the principle of busi
ness is the principle of autocracy,
that is that one man shall run it. If
our method produces less results, wo
must meet this test of efficiency, and
face that other problem of making
democracy care.
"Big Bill Thompson typifies the
greatest danger we are facing. He is
a good showman, but a condescending
leader. Lincoln thought the best was
none too good for his people. The
people will always do more if they are
dealt with on the supposition that
they are intelligent. What democracy
needs today is a combination of the
virtues of Lincoln and Big Bill."
