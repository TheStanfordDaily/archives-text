# An Ugly Predicament

### 
A RUDE shock was given recently to universities which believe that
they have the right to expel students with insufficiently stated rea
sons. The shock was delivered by a justice of a New York court in his
decision on the case of Miss Beatrice Anthony, a Syracuse student who
had been asked to withdraw from the university because she was "not
the Syracuse type." Miss Anthony at least proved that she is not the
usual type of student by going to court about the matter.
Justice Edward N. Smith stated in his decision that the university,
being a semi-public institution, did not have the authority to dismiss
without stating the cause. Furthermore, he held that a Syracuse pledge,
acknowledging attendance to be a "privilege and not a right," required
of all students, was void. The university, with firm faith in its power of
dismissal, appealed to the New York supreme court which will take up
the case in January.
the meagre facts at hand indicate that the university is holding
something back. Deans do not sit up late of nights discussing stu
dents with flimsy excuses such as this. True, students have been and will
be dismissed for dimly stated reasons, though occasionally a student is
perfectly willing that the true cause be kept hidden. That is true in
SOME cases, in which Miss Anthony's experience logically does not fall.
Students can always be flunked out. The common and particularly
evil phenomenon of refusing to return examination papers makes this
course of action easy for university officials. But Syracuse, we are glad
to see, did not adopt this step. Instead, the student is curtly dismissed
with the stateent that she is "not the Syracuse type."' Miss Anthony, bo
iler public demand for an explanation, put the university in a bad hole.
THE decision of Justice Smith is one with which we are heartily in
accord. University administrations are not hierachies in whose
hands should rest dominating power of this sort. As was pointed out in
the decision, the university is a semi-public institution and as such, it
has its obligations.
The boavt is often heard that students are admitted to an institution
on a competitive basis; "pull," it is said, is to no avail. It should also
be the boast of universities that students are not dismissed unless with
sufficient cause. No university should go to court in an effort to legally
obtain the power of sentence without trial.
