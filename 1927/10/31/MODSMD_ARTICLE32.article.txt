# There Is Hope

It is, sometimes, a good thing that college plays are given only one
night. As a consequence of this rarely excepted custom, Stanford's
Dramatic Council has all the money it will ever receive from seat sales
of "The Lady of the Rose" carefully put away. It could not, then,
object from economic reasons to criticism of last Friday night's per
formance.
With the exception of Les Kiler's sets, which are always satisfactory,
we were disappointed in the play. Altogether too long intervals were
taken between cues and the succeeding lines; a bit of over-acting in the
second act resulted almost in a burlesque at a tense moment; the "dream
illusion'' was ruined by seeing—and hearing—the actors move about;
and, last but not least, the lighting was poorly timed. Everyone will
overlook an occasional forgetting of lines for the moment, but everyone
will not overlook some of the slips of last Friday night.
Most of the difficulties experienced in the performance may be laid
to the fact that the play itself was not good. Besides not having a con
vincing plot, it was replete with trite, time-worn phrases, and was
clearly not a show to please a campus audience.
But there is hope. There are more plays scheduled and it is natural
to hope that they will be better than "The Lady of the Rose" presentation.
