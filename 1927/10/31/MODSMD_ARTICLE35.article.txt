Dear Sally:
I received all your letters through
the Daily, and, Sally, dear, I would
have answered sooner, but I've been
sick. You see, I've been eating at the
Union, and trying to do it on a dollar
fifty a day, and Sally, I'm weak from
hunger. And this reminds me I've
been sure 'nuff robbed! And such a
sensation! You feel so helpless and
your brain is whirling around; but let
me tell you all about it. I went down
to the Union cafeteria for lunch today,
passed down the line, and came to
the cashier. Guess what that man
said —eighty-three cents! I looked at
him kinda fuuny, and said, "Now, Mis
ter, let me tell one." And the big
mans, he says, "Hurry up," and I
thought he said "Stick 'em up." And
the first thing 1 thought of was you
and shotguns, and all, and then I
looks at him again, and he looks back
hard, and then I grabs a salad and
takes it back to the serving counter,
and that knocks off fifteen cents, and
the salad —well, I just took it in the
first place because it looked so lone
some, for it had been there three days
in the same place, but I still owed the
cashier sixty-eight cents, and, Sally, I
only had fifty. My next thought was,
what shall I take back next? A bril
liant thought pierced my worried
brain. The beans! And still I owed
fifty-eight. Then came the question,
"Pie or no pie?" The pie went back.
Sally, what I got for forty-eight cents,
well, you won't believe it —one lone
piece of last year's bull, cold potatoes,
a glass of milk, and bread and butter.
A bit shaky, I sat down to the nearest
table and tasted the milk, and —pre-
pare for the worst, Sally—the d —d
stuff was sour.
But what I can't understand is why
they say the food is sold at cost, and,
no foolin', they're the highest place
in the county. Why don't they out
and tell us they're paying for the Stan
ford Union, paying all the faculty's
salaries, and giving a cold million a
year to the French war orphans?
That's what hurts.
I've got to close and beat it to
Morey's, so give my best to all the
sisters, and be sure and throw the
scraps in the usual place.
Love 'em heaps,
LITTLE EVA'S YOUNGER
BROTHER
P.S. —Sally, do girls like curly-haired
boys?
