The Editor, Sir:
May I meekly protest against the I
relentless logic of your editorial col
umn, used last Tuesday against poor
Dr. Byron Cummings? To me, his
statement was quite simple and un
derstandable until you began to shove
in some of your own profound ideas
and tied his into a veritable Gordian
knot. Don't you have any pity for a
college president, you big brute?
Just what do you mean by ideals?
Whatever you mean, I have always
thought of them as conceptions of
things in their highest perfections,
things to be aimed at and, if possible,
realized. These things do not need to
be moral: they are just as likely to
be intellectual, especially in a college
community. Nor do they need to be
gathered from a definite statement:
they may be much more reliably as
certained by a little rational observa
tion.
Now please read JDr. Cummings'
statement again. Your first mistake
was calling it "Twenty-Seven Words,"
when, as a matter of fact, it has
twenty-eight words. And, to satisfy
your evident proclivity to quibble,
please mark that he mentions not fra
ternities but fraternity men as the
ones who have disappointed him in
their exhibition of deals. He believes
that the particular kind of individuals
he observed at the smoker should not
be permitted to pool their low stand
ards by organizing. It happens that
they have organized fraternities. So
he attacks the fraternities. He would

probably attack any organizations that
depend on such men and on such
ideals. And 1 fail to see how he strays
from the point in remarking that
groups anywhere, consisting of such
men, should be very strongly discour
aged.
Reflect on the fact that there really
is an amazingly large number of in
telligent, congenial Stanford men who
refuse a dozen or more invitations to
go row. These men do this because
their own ideals, "whatever they may
be," cannot possibly conform to those
they find among some of the frater
nity men. And notice that I say
"some." For the same reason, many
do not join any kind of a campus
group at all.
You are approximately correct in
arguing that college groups, strictly as
such, do not possess distinct person
alities. But there is no particular
point to such an argument. The indi
viduals who compose the groups do
have distinct personalities and if they
are distinctly undesirable, as Dr.
Cummings sadly avers, they occupy
a worthless place on a respectable
campus.
You may have wearied "pointing out
other fallacies" in the Arizona presi
dent's very sane words, but it's a
cinch you wearied me too. In fact,
I'm weary right now. Throw an egg
at me if you wish!

community. Nor do they need to be
gathered from a definite statement:
they may be much more reliably as
certained by a little rational observa
tion.
Now please read JDr. Cummings'
statement again. Your first mistake
was calling it "Twenty-Seven Words,"
when, as a matter of fact, it has
twenty-eight words. And, to satisfy
your evident proclivity to quibble,
please mark that he mentions not fra
ternities but fraternity men as the
ones who have disappointed him in
their exhibition of deals. He believes
that the particular kind of individuals
he observed at the smoker should not
be permitted to pool their low stand
ards by organizing. It happens that
they have organized fraternities. So
he attacks the fraternities. He would

probably attack any organizations that
depend on such men and on such
ideals. And 1 fail to see how he strays
from the point in remarking that
groups anywhere, consisting of such
men, should be very strongly discour
aged.
Reflect on the fact that there really
is an amazingly large number of in
telligent, congenial Stanford men who
refuse a dozen or more invitations to
go row. These men do this because
their own ideals, "whatever they may
be," cannot possibly conform to those
they find among some of the frater
nity men. And notice that I say
"some." For the same reason, many
do not join any kind of a campus
group at all.
You are approximately correct in
arguing that college groups, strictly as
such, do not possess distinct person
alities. But there is no particular
point to such an argument. The indi
viduals who compose the groups do
have distinct personalities and if they
are distinctly undesirable, as Dr.
Cummings sadly avers, they occupy
a worthless place on a respectable
campus.
You may have wearied "pointing out
other fallacies" in the Arizona presi
dent's very sane words, but it's a
cinch you wearied me too. In fact,
I'm weary right now. Throw an egg
at me if you wish!

The Editor, Sir:
May I meekly protest against the I
relentless logic of your editorial col
umn, used last Tuesday against poor
Dr. Byron Cummings? To me, his
statement was quite simple and un
derstandable until you began to shove
in some of your own profound ideas
and tied his into a veritable Gordian
knot. Don't you have any pity for a
college president, you big brute?
Just what do you mean by ideals?
Whatever you mean, I have always
thought of them as conceptions of
things in their highest perfections,
things to be aimed at and, if possible,
realized. These things do not need to
be moral: they are just as likely to
be intellectual, especially in a college
community. Nor do they need to be
gathered from a definite statement:
they may be much more reliably as
certained by a little rational observa
tion.
