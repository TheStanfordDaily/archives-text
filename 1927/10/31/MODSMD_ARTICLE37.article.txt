Polo games are really the most
thrilling and intriguing things. I
mean one gets so excited trying to ;
watch all the horses and riders and
balls. I really don't understand just j
how they keep from getting all
tangled up.
And the way they keep having to
change the goal posts. It seems too
silly to have to go from one end of
the field to the other. But when every
one is chasing the ball I nearly die.
I just love horse races.
Those cork hats are just wonderful
for protection. It would be safer if
they wore cork trousers, too. don't you
think? It really is a very dangerous
game, too. I know the players must
be awfully brave. The horses are so i
sensitive. And the way they all kick j
and buck is really interesting. I can't !
see how they manage to jump around j
at so many different angles.
And there was one thing that re?\
was exciting. A man from the circus
fell off his horse, and then right away,
a man from our team was almost hurt
when his horse fell too.
I think chukkers is such a darling
name. It sounds so nice when you
say it ,it might mean so much. I mean,
it is just the name for a polo period,
it is so unique. And polo is really a
terribly amazing game. Just imagine
what might happen if a horse should
be stubborn.
And there was one man that got all
the attention. I don't think he de
served it either, because he just rode
around telling the men how to play
and didn't really work at all himself.
I guess the reason was because he
was so good-looking on his horse.
