# FAMOUS QUARTERBACKS
## By Feg Murray 
### 
Don't be alarmed, ladies and gentle
men—the writer does not claim that Eck
ersall, Friedman, Buell, Grange, Boyn
ton, and Stuhldreher were the greatest
quarterbacks of all time. Friends and ad
mirers of Wallie Steffen, Willis Rich
ardson, Pooley Hubert, Vin Stevenson,
Giarley Daly, Ellory Huntington, Char
ley Erb, and other great ball-carriers
and field generals need not be offended.
A drawing the width and depth of this
whole page could not do justice to the
many great quarterbacks in gridiron his
tory, Hannibals and Napoleons of foot
ball, who had brains as well as brawn,
generalship as well as "guts," and the

ability to size up the situation in a jiffy
and call the right play at the right time,
even though half-numb from making
tackles, leading interference, and carry
ing the ball.
I have given Benny Boynton of Wil
liams College a prominent position in this
cartoon because 1 always thought that
his fame would have been nation-wide if
he had gone to Yale, Harvard, Michigan,
or some such large institution. But even
a weak team at a minor college, as foot
ball fame goes, couldn't hide Benny
Boynton's great ability. He had every
thing—that is, everything but publicity—
and no one who has ever seen him in
action, sans headguard, often with sleeves

rolled up to his elbows, carrying the ball
in both hands before him like a Rugby
player, will ever forget his flaming gen
ius. His 110-yard run to a touchdown
in 1920 against Hamilton is merely one
of the records he left.
Walter Eckersall's all-around ability
is too well known to need further com
ment. He has been rightfully called "the
Prince of Quarterbacks," and nearly ev
ery critic's all-time all-American team
has his name at the pilot's post. His suc
cessor, Wallie Steflfen, now a judge and
coach at Carnegie Tech, was nearly his
equal, while nervy little Vin Stevenson,
the colorful Penn quarterback with the
biting tongue, deserves high rating.

One man not yet mentioned here so far
who should not be overlooked is George
Pfann of Cornell, a wonderful ball-car
rier and all-American quarterback in
1923, but George did not have the chess
brain that characterized men like Eckie
and Stuhldreher and Buell. He was
stronger, perhaps, but slower-witted.
