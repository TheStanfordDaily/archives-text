# Snyder, Benson Star at End, Block Two Punts; Line Shows Strength
## 
### Bob Speers 
Stanford's Gray contingent, hit by
j injuries and hard luck, was supposed
to be only a weak shadow of its for
mer self, but the phantom came to
life Saturday, and an outclassed Santa
Barbara State Teachers College
! eleven, coached by Dud DeGroot, re
j tired from the lists at the small end
|of a 12 to 0 score.
j The visitors journeyed north sched
| uled to play the freshmen, but ex-
I tensive injuries among Hunt's charges
: caused a change of plans which put
| Hal Davis' team against the Southern
| ers. This latter Stanford outfit was
! supposed to be in almost as bad a
condition as the yearlngs, but Satur
day's game put another light on
things.
Victory Decisive
Stanford's victory was much more
I decisive than the two touchdown mar
j gin indicates. The Santa Barbarans
j could not gain, and were unsuccessful
jin stopping the winners' offense,
j which kept the ball in the losing
team's territory most of the four
periods.
The first score came when Cal
Snyder blocked a punt on Santa Bar
bara's twenty-five-yard line. Stanford
carried the ball within striking dis
tance in a few plays, and Cohen
smashed across for a touchdown.
In the second quarter, when the
visitors attempted to kick from be
hind their own goal, this same Snyder
broke through again to block the ball
which Benson dropped on for a score.
End Play Smashing
One big feature of the contest was
the smashing Cardinal end play which
caused two-thirds of Santa Barbara's
I punts to be partially blocked. Snyder
and Benson, at the wings, had no
small part in Stanford's success as
has been already shown.
The whole line played good ball,
shoving the visitors about almost at
will. Jake Fetzer distinguished him
self by breaking through the opposi
tion for nice tackles, and by clipping
recklessly in the interference.
While the Stanford backs did not
shine as individual stars they worked
well together, and showed an abun
dance of driving power. Goodcell and
I Cohen filled the vacant fullback berth
as if they had played that position for
years.
McCone came through with his
I usual spectacular tackling, and dis
' played some unexpected ability in
! ball-carrying. Lewis, although he did
j n't stand out from the bleacher's
! point of view, ran the team cannily,
j taking advantage of every situation.
