# Scribe-Chappie Grid Clash Ends With Tied Score
## 
### 
The Daily Scribes played the Ham
mer and Coffin Chappies in a rioting
game Saturday afternoon to the tune
of 6-G. Both teams played a consistent
game and the scores were run up last
and furiously, from the first pyramid
play of the Chappies, which piled up
the first touchdown, to the triple
touchdown by Captain "Sticky" Lynn
Bramkamp of the Daily. Although
there was some doubt at this point in
the game as to which goal post was
which, Bramkamp cleared up the dif
ficulty by making a double-end run,
and placing the ball at both ends of
the field.
One of the chief features of the
game was the appearance of the Red-
Cross nurse, Helen Stanford, the only
active honorary woman member of
Hammer and Coffin. She was greeted
by cheers from the rooting section at
the beginning of the game, and a new
varsity yell was dedicated to her.
Co-operation Perfect
Both teams maintained perfect co
operation throughout the entire game,
even in the use of the double assem
bly huddle system. This new type of
signals should prove a valuable sug
gestion for varsity sport, since it does
away with the difficulty of the sepa
rate huddle system that the opposition
team never knows what signals are
being called, and what is to happen.
At the last moment, changes were
made in the conference rules to allow
more than eleven men to play at a
time. The Scribe team took advantage
of this to appear with a baker's
dozen. This proved a more satisfac
tory method of play than with the
old eleven-man team, since more men
share in the scrimmage.
Trick Plays Used
Chappies held consistently to trick
plays, showing an intricate and ver
satile attack. The tensest moment of
the game fell with the conspicuous
use of the Utah play (so-called be
cause of the wide and open spaces of
the formation), with two minutes to
go of the last quarter of the game.
This developed into a fake end run
and lateral pass, completed three plays
later, when "Demitasse" Winston
Norman caged the ball in a bug net
for a twenty-yard gain. Unfortunately
Norman ran afoul in the net and was
downed. This was the Chappie's last
chance to score and the game ended
with the ball on the fifteen-yard line,
and the Chappies lined up for their
famous mystery play. Â»
