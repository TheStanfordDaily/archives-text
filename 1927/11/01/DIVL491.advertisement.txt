YOUR FRIENDS
NOTICE YOUR SHOES
When a man dresses neatly from head
to angles and NEGLECTS his Shoes;
that "lacking something" is sure to be
noticed. And it will "register" first with
his friends.
There is no reason to be careless or need
to be extravagant about your Footwear.
The thing is to buy GOOD SHOES. Have
shoes enough for a "change off" and a
correct pair for each occasion. TAKE
GOOD CARE of them and SAVE money.
There's a Scotch Grain Oxford here now
—made by Slater —which is a wonderful
example of Real Worth in Good Foot
wear. In Tan or Black, the price is $10.
Come in and let us slip a pair on.
