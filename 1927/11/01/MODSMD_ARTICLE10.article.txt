# WILL DISPLAY PROOFS OF QUAD PICTURES IN OLD UNION THIS WEEK
## 
### 
All Quad photographic proofs which
have been on display for the past few
days in the Women's Clubhouse may
be seen in the trophy room of the Old
Union this week, beginning today
through Friday from 8 to 5 o'clock
and Saturday morning from 9 to 12
o'clock, according to Mac Lewis, Quad
manager. These include all of the
senior photographs taken up to the
time they went on display in the
Women's Clubhouse.
No more pictures of seniors will be
taken this quarter, but arrangements
are being made to have those seniors
who have bought books but have not
had their pictures taken, photographed
at some later time. These are asked to
hand their names into the Quad office.
All seniors who have not purchased
Quads are urged by Lewis to do so.
