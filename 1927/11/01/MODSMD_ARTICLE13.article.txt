## 
### 
With iiis latest English work, "From j
J A Paris Balcony," as subject matter |
for his talk, Abbe Ernest Dimnet, |
noted French writer and lecturer, will |
speak tonight at 7:30 o'clock in tliej
' Little Theatre.

Abbe Dimnet, who has attained lit
erary distinction by his English
works, has been a contributor to vari-r
ous English, American, and French
periodicals, and is the author of sev
eral books. Among them are "Les
Soeurs Bronte" and "France Herself."
The last, printed on the eve of the
war, was prophetic in tone, and was
widely circulated in America as well
as in England.
Largely because of the success of
this book, President Abbott Lawrence
Lowell of Harvard invited him to
give a series of lectures during the
fall of 1919. The enthusiasm with
which his lectures were received led
the Abbe to leave his Paris home
each year for a few weeks in order
to address American audiences.
Recognized as holding unusual sym
pathy and understanding for this
country and its people, the Abbe has
been widely acclaimed for fluent and
lucid English, for a keen wit, and for
convincing presentation of ideas.
When Abbe Dimnet lectured at
Stanford in 1920 on"The Return of
the Native," he gave an account of
the changes wrought in his native vil
lage by the war. This was captured
by the Germans in 1914, and his own
home occupied by German officers for
several years.
