## FROM UNITED PRESS MELLON RECOMMENDS $225,000,000 TAX CUT 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 31â€”Tax
reduction not to excecd $225,000,000 was
proposed to the House Ways and Means
Committee today by Secretary of the
Treasury Mellon.
The $225,000,000 was distributed by
Mellon into five major reductions, in
cluding :
Lowering the rate on corporate income
taxes one and one-half per cent, from
13J4 to 12, resulting in a loss of revenue
of approximately $135,000,000.
Amending provisions of the law to
permit corporations with net incomes of
$25,000 or less to file returns and pay
taxes as partnerships, resulting in a reve
nue loss of approximately $35,000,000.
Income Readjustment
Readjustment of rates on incomes be
tween $18,000 and $70,000 which would
result in a revenue loss of approximately
$50,000,000.
Repeal of the federal estate tax, re
sulting in a revenue loss of $7,000,000.
Exemption of American bankers' ac

ceptanccs held by foreign banks from
taxation, involving a loss of approxi
j mately $35,000.
All other takes would he retained under
| the Mellon plan and the rates on indi
vidual incomes under $18,000 and over
$70,000 would remain the same.
Representative Garner, of Texas, the
ranking Democratic member of the com
mittee, took exception to the treasury's
i estimates of surplus.
"For five years the President and the
Treasury Department have underesti
mated the treasury surplus," Garner de
clared, "and for this reason Congress
must come to the conclusion that the
methods used either in the President's
office or the Treasury Department arc
inefficient and unreliable and that Con
gress can reduce taxes still further than
the limit set by the Treasury Depart
ment."
Representative Garner intimated that
in the tax reduction program to he draft
ed by the minority members of the com
mittee, an even larger corporation tax
reduction than the one and one-half per
cent would be proposed.
