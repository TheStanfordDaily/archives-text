# GRAYS IN SHAPE FOR SATURDAY GAME WITH CALIFORNIA RESERVES
## 
### 
With a scrimmage last night and
another scheduled for this evening,
Coach Hal Davis' Grays are getting
into nice shape for their game with
the University of California Reserves
in the stadium Saturday.
The squad came through the Santa
Barbara contest in good condition. All
the players are practically free from
injuries except May and Taylor who
are out for the rest of the season.
Last Saturday's game, by the way,
showed very conclusively that even
with the loss of these two stars
Davis has an outfit which is strong
in every respect. '
Nobody knows just how much of a
problem California will be. The two
aggregations have not met any of the
same teams; so there is no basis for
comparison. It is an established fact
that Stanford is strong, but whether
the invaders will be stronger will re
main a question until the game is
finished.
