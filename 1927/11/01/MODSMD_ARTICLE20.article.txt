GENEVA, Oct. 31.â€”The League of |
Nations' dream of universality practi- j
cally has become a reality.
The United States is now participating i
in virtually all League activities save j
those which are political and the Soviet
government decided Monday to take part
in the League's preparatory disarmament
conference.
League observers contend that eight
years' experience has demonstrated that
it is unimportant whether nations are
members of the international body so
long as they willingly co-operate in the
League's activities.
Ecuador is virtually the only nation in
the world not yet collaborating with the
League.
