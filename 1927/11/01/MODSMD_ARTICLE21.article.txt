# Government Meets Further Obstacles in Fall Case
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 31.—The
government met obstacles today in its
effort to show the jury in the Teapot J
Dome conspiracy trial that Harry F. Sin-1
clair furnished the $230,500 in Liberty I
bonds that Albert 15. Fall received soon
after he had turned the naval reserve over
to the millionaire oil man.
That attempt was made by delving
further into the complicated deal involv- j
ing the mysterious Continental Trading \
Company of Canada. The indirect meth- |
od was made necessary when the court
last week upheld Fall's son-in-law, M. T. |
Everhart, in refusing to tell where he j
got the bonds on the ground that it would j
incriminate him.
Thus far the government has been un-1
able to prove directly that Sinclair was
the real figure behind the Continental j
company.
