# BRANDSTEN, MALONEY TO LEAVE SOON FOR A.A.U. MEET IN EAST
## Representatives Will Try to Bring National Swim Tryouts to West 
### 
Ernst M. Brandsten, swimming coach,
j and Harry Maloney, director of minor
j sports, will leave November 15 for the
| conference of the A.A.U. to he held at
Cincinnati, Ohio, November 20, 21, and
i 22.
| The meeting will be held to close the
financial year of the Union, consider
! amendments, and allocate all champion
| ship meets. The Pacific Amateur Asso
ciation district, of which Maloney is
j president, has instructed him to bid for
] the indoor national swimming champion-
I ship, or the outdoor national champion
| ship, or, failing both, to bid for the
I Olympic tryouts, it is said.
It is a matter of great expense success
| fully to carry out any one of these meets,
'and San Francisco has already indicated
j her willingness to back the proposition
j by appropriating $6000.
"We stand a pretty good chance of
| getting one of the meets, but we don't
! know which," stated Coach Brandsten.
! "If we are successful, the events will be
| held at the Olympic Club, the Sutro
J Baths, or the Fleishhacker Pool."
"Directly following the A.A.U. confer-
J ence, Brandsten will attend a meeting of
I the American Olympic Committee to dis
| cuss the Olympic Games, which are being
J held at Amsterdam this coming summer,
j Coaches in charge of the American
j teams will be selected and a course of
| training for the athletes determined. A
j program of organization for the cotn
| mittee is to be worked out, and the dates
I set for the American championship
Olympic tryouts. From $350,000 to
$400,000 is necessary to finance the Olym
pic tryouts and to send the contestants
| abroad.
Before returning to Stanford Brand-
I stcn probably will stop at the University
jof Minnesota and Northwestern Uni
j versity to discuss affairs in connection
j with the national intercollegiate swim
j ming meets.
