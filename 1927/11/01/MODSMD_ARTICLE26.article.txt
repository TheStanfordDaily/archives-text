# PREPARES FOR MUDDY GRID AT SEATTLE BOWL
## Frentrup, Patchett Are Best Bets for Stanford If Field Is Slow SIGNAL PRACTICE FAST Warner's Squad Leaves for North on Wednesday; Rain Is Expected 
### Milton Silverman 
Coach Pop Warner is allowing no
grass to grow under the cleated shoes
ol the Stanford Redshirts. Immedi
ately after tlie Oregon game Saturday,
all the Cardinals, including Herb
Fleishhacker, who had not played
more than two quarters, were sent
through tiie toughest scrimmage seen
in this part of tlie country for many a
day.
A galloping signal practice, a few
trips ii]) and down the field accom
panied by the charging machine, and
then around the grid four times, with
Pop's incessant "speed it up there,
you fellows!" made the Cardinals
long for a good firm seat on the
bench. Yesterday, another hectic prac
tice began to make some of the men
realize that Huskie hunting will be
no picnic.
Will Leave Wednesday
Leaving Palo Alto Wednesday af
ternoon on the crack Cascade, the var
sity will arrive in Seattle just in time
to get nicely soaked in the expected
rain. But Pop has been preparing for
this monstrous scrap in the slime.
Lud Prentrup is one of the best mud
scows that Stanford can offer. Hitched
up with Ernie Patchett, he can pull
the Cardinal team out of many a deep
rut.
Captain Pat Wilson and his brother
backs are no slouches themselves
when it comes to squeezing through
the muck and mire. Louis Tesreau,
though not at all equal to his brother
Elmer, is fairly respectable in a good i
sea of ooze. McCann and Geehan are i
staging a great fight in the northern
stadium to decide who shall have the
honor of splashing mud in Spud
Lewis' face.
Chuck Carroll and Thurle Thornton, j
two mighty sophomores, will also
make their footprints on the Wash- j
ington grid. Coach lJagshaw will be |
able to chuckle, if not to laugh out-1
right, if he sees heavy rain storms j
predicted for Saturday.
