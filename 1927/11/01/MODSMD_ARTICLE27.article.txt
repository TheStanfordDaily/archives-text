## 
### Herbert Klein 
A pianist, who is something more
than merely a capable performer upon
his chosen instrument, one who is
also a composer, a scholar, an editor
of musical literature, and an innovator
in interpretation—such is Ignaz Fried
man, Polish virtuoso who will play in
the Stanford. Pavilion next Thursday
evening as second attraction of the
Stanford Concert Series.
Strangely enough, Friedman does
not in the least resemble the conven
tional picture of the concert pianist.
He is powerfully built, broad shoul
dered, as vigorous as is his playing
and is physically equipped to meet
(he strenuous demands of his exact
ing interpretations of the most "pyro
technical" classics.
Friedman is noted for sympathetic
and subtle interpretation of the works
of his great fellow countryman,
Chopin, and so cannot bo regarded
only as a performer remarkable for
his ability in overwhelming and daz
zling his audience with displays of
sheer technique.
Friedman has been touring in Amer
ica only during the past four years,
and has established himself at the
top among American piano favorites,
sharing the ranking of the great
Polish triumvirate, Paderewski, De
Pachmann, and Hoffman. His fame in
Europe has for long been securely es
tablished. where he has given brilliant
recitals in all the leading cities.
The following announcement has
been made by Miss Gertrude Ilaker,
manager of the Series, relative to
tickets. "In order to make Friedman's
concert and the three which will fol
low it available at the regular student
rate, season tickets will be sold for
these last four events at the special
price of $2.50. All students and fac
ulty may secure tickets at the Asso
ciated Students Office, Old Union."
