Complaints in the form of Campus Opinions and verbal knocks are
"beginning to come into the office as a result of yesterday's comments on
"The Lady of the Rose." How different it is when the statement is
made that a football player fumbled—his admiring friends don't blame

One of our Campus Opinion writers tells us that Miss Anna May
Price comes "unannounced" to the campus. We don't know the figures
on the amount of space that she and"The Lady of the Rose" play re
ceived from other papers, but the Daily printed 109 column inches on
these items, sixteen of the inches being in the form of paid advertise
ments for the seat sale of the play. The Daily is willing to back Anna
May Price and her actors —but it will not say that the play is a good one
just because it's a Stanford play.
