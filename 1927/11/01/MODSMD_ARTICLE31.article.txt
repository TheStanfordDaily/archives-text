# An "Improved" Lit
## 
### 
The first issue of the Stanford Literary Magazine will appear on
November 15. As is always the case with collegiate magazines, we hear
that improvements are being planned by the new management. We have
reason to believe that the 1927-1928 Literary Magazine will have a
wider appeal to the campus than have the literary magazines of the
previous two years.
Variations in the make-up of the magazine to achieve this object
include a greater use of informal essays, more short stories of a non
collegiate character, and no editorials (there is something curious in
this). In the place of editorials will be substituted articles of "general
interest," preferably by a faculty member.
This is the Lit's announced policy during the drive for subscriptions.
If you like the policy, you'll probably like the magazine.
