Stanford's freshman football team's Little Big Game is now but five
days away. The squad played no game last Saturday, letting the Grays
face the Santa Barbara State Teachers' College team in its stead. In the
eyes of the campus, next Saturday's contest is the decisive one upon
which judgment of the first-year men's team will be passed.
It is, then, only fitting that all of Encina Hall's inhabitants should
co-operate in as many ways as possible to insure victory. Complaints
from members of the squad that there is too much noise in the Hall are
being made to sponsors. If only for this week, freshmen should observe
silence rules.
