Question: Why does Stanford make
its visitors face the sun at the foot
ball games?
Answer by Edward S. Loder, Engi
neer at the Board of Athletic Control:
Stanford takes the west side of the
stadium to facilitate the traffic prob
lem. The visitors come down the high
way and enter on the east side, and
the main Stanford section comes from
the west. If it were vice-versa, the
moving crowds would be hopelessly
tangled up.
