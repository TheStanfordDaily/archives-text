It is regrettable but not a great loss
that Lindsey did not speak on the
campus. The little judge is no better
orator than a public speaking flunkout
and all he has to say has been better
said in his easily available books and
articles.
It will be very unfortunate how
ever, if the furor raised among the
students dies in futile grumbling.
There are real grounds for criticism
of the comparative intellectual isola
tion of the campus.
The University policy on public
meetings was established in the found
ing grant. Those were turbulent times
and Mrs. Stanford wisely sought to
keep the young Alma Mater out of
political mudfiglits. Conditions have
changed and now the need is to in
terpret the letter of the policy into
keeping with the spirit of intellectual
adventure which best typifies the
University.
Controversial questions are faced
as much as could be expected in our
classrooms. But on religious, current
ly social or economic and political
questions the classroom can never be
adequate. The groundwork of agreed
fact takes most of the time. The stu
dent must still get a great part of his
education on current affairs outside.
Hearing able controversial speakers is
a chief means to this end.
San Francisco, a large cosmopolitan
city, draws to its rostrums exponents
of all sides of everything. Very few
of these are invited down to the Farm.
Getting speakers here requires some
money and an active interest.
At the present time the University
itself is about the only organization
which invites any public speakers at

all to the campus. The Christian As
sociations, liberal within limits, are
preoccupied with contemplating their
own virtue. Cosmopolitan club is im
possible. Euphronia is too dead to lie
| down. No one outside an asylum would
| expect political science, sociological,
| or journalistic fraternities to stimulate
i the extra curricular education of their
| classmates. Everything is left to the
; Committee on Public Exercises. This
i committee has the worlds highest
| known respect for what the neighbors
will say, or as it is so quaintly put,
j "unthinking outsiders." It is very con
j scious that vigorously expressed ideas
| are uncomfortable and swell no en
; dowinents. Tuesday evening lectures
j are in consequence often mildly in-
I formative but always very, very safe.
There are two remedies possible.
One is that the administration may
sometime take the stand that ably
presented stimulating ideas are in
themselves good for the young, and
trust that appetite may grow with
feeding. Then it could be established
University policy that here was to he
a forum where ideas might fight it
out and various points of view be pre
sented as such without the institution
; being involved any more than now.
But an immediate proposal is for a
group of students to take the responsi-
I bility, confer with the University
every time an outstanding thinker
heaves in sight, then if the University
doesn't want the speaker and the stu
} dents do, let them pay the cost and
invite him down to Palo Alto.
If extra-curricular free discussion of
j current questions is worth having it
I is worth going after in a way to get
I results. â€”Donald Gledhill.
