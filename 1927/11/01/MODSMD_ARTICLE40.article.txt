"Something About Eve," by James
Branch Cabell. Mcßride & Co., New
York. 1927.
"Something About Eve," the latest
novel of Cabell, is a subtle parody,
written in all seeming seriousness, a
parody on all those men, who feel
that the material world in which they
live, live only to die, is incomplete,
insufficient; .... in short, a bur
lesque on all those men who do not
find complete satisfaction in their
women, nor are willing to reconcile
themselves to the tenet, that this
present life will end their separate,
individual existences.
That ". . . only two truths endure,
and the one teaching is that we copu
late an ddie . . ." is not sufficient
for many men, and among the lat
ter's, Gerald Musgrave, the character
whom Cabell releases from his physi
cal body and whom he transforms into
a god, who searches for a third truth,
this searching being vain and futile,
as has been the similar fate of all who
have preceded him on earth in a simi
lar quest.
Near the end of the narrative, after
the author has caused Gerald to re
turn to his natural body, a Protestant
Episcopal body in the United States
of America, to be exact; now when
Gerald is no longer a god, now when
his anticipation of a pleasant vision
of a third and ultimate truth is no
longer, he is made to think these few
well-chosen words:

"For as' you .... got older . . . . i
there was less bitterness ... to be
derived of the knowledge that in hu
man living very much amounted to
nothing, because you saw even more
clearly and more constantly that
nothing amounted to very much . . ."
Thus it brought home to Gerald
finally that in an eternity there may
be a void only, while a great deal may !
be got out of a living called ephe
meral. There might be found an in
finity of pleasure in a brief existence,
whereas there is always the tenta
tive possibility that there might be
merely an infinitesimal pleasure in a
long, tediously protracted vitality.
While Gerald is lolling by a way
side in the shape of an indolent god,
a spirit, in the garb of a bishop, Is
made to address him. This bishop
who is about to pass into the land
from which there is 110 returning, the
region to which all gods, discarded
by fickle humanity, are relegated . . J
this bishop places the germ of a doubt j
into the mind of Gerald, a doubt that j
his knowledge of even two truths Is
complete, as it should be complete |
before he should seek a third. The
bishop speaks:
. I suspect that when anybody 1
anywhore once understands the na
ture of any two truths, that will be j
quite time enough for him to be re
quiring a third truth to exercise liis j

wits upon."
This elusive third truth about which
Gerald and his fellow gods know
nothing, hut about which they seek to
know everything, is not one of any
unity at all; to metamorphis the gods
into men; men think in their idle mo
ments about immortality. But such a
varied immortality: to live in a city
of solid gold, or to enjoy beyond all
reason pleasures of the senses, are
hut two hypotheses upon which the
thoughts of eternity have been con
ceived by men.
All these ideas, some of them obvi
ous, others enigmas to the casual
glance, are written in such a style,
with such beauty of prose, as is pe
culiarly that of Cabell, and Cabell
alone. Phrases, sentences, paragraphs,
even pages are covered with such
matter as would be suppressed, fierce
ly censored, were these written by
one less subtle, less capable than
Cabell. There is a smile in every line
but in none there is laughter. Humor
is everywhere in this somewhat am
biguous burlesque, if only reason re
move the ambiguity. Conventions are
forgotten; much is written that would
bo disapproved by many on the
grounds that it is too frank or too
course, depending on the individual
perspective. Still such prose, merely
for its own sake, is well worth the
reading. —Gunnar Norberg.
