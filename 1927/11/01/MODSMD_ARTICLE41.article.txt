# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
H. K. was rather personal in his
criticism of the play staged last Fri
day night in the Assembly. I therefore
take great pleasure in being personal
with him.
To begin with he seems to think
that campus audiences are a bunch of
morons or imbeciles who are not
capable of telling the meaning of a
; play, staged as it was last Friday
I night. It is evidently his intention
through his "Dippy" (capital D and
quotations) articles to raise the stand
ard of intelligence amongst poor uni
versity students to a point of simple
understanding.
Practically every uncomplimentary
thing that could be said was directed
against the cast. I, on the contrary,
I was very much impressed by the
splendid way in which the cast inter
-1 preted such a difficult play. My opin-
I ion is shared by many of my friends
who understand dramatics much bet
ter than myself or H. K. either.
I have a personal grudge at my
I friend 11. K. for his many ignorant
criticisms of campus musicales and
if he wants to "have it out" with me,
1 I would appreciate his finding my
| name from the editor and coming to J

visit mo. —A.D.H., '27.
(Editor's Note—A.D.H. overlooks
the fact that "U.K." might have been
a woman, as it happens was actually
the case.)
