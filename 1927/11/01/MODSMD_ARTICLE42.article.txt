The Editor, Sir:
Once upon a time there was an Old
Gang. And the Old Gang used to play
together, and have wonderful times
telling each other what marvelous
actors they were. Those were the
good old days.
By flowery speeches and even by
written account, The Gang found
great joy in telling each other (and
anyone else that might listen or read)
how truly remarkable "We all" really
and truly were. Now to join into this
lovely mutual appreciation circle, the
envious outsider had but to learn the
secret ritual, which I may now di
vulge, as The Gang is no longer ex
istent. It was a powerful magic, and
most remarkable in its logical sim
plicity. The candidate had only to say
or write in the presence of "The
Ones," "I think your work was per
fect! What an actor you are!" And
this simple speech, whose logic was
so undeniable, would open wide the
gates of fame.
What an apt example this makes of
one of Hamaha's truisms, when this
great Persian What-not said, "It is
truth that I say unto you. It is the
simple things that make the greatest
magic; it is careful study of details
that leads the obscure into the sun
shine."
And so The Gang grew in strength
and pretty sayings. Those were the
days!
But at last the clock struck twelve,
and the Old Gang's day was tolled
into the land of memories. A new
Queen had entered thei rstronghold
unannounced, and, it seems, unwel
comed, for she did not bother to learn
their magic. However, she was a real
Queen, for she routed them from their
lady place into the cold beyond. And
now, broken in unity and no longer
able to handshake each other violent
ly over the new triumphs, they stand
around in little groups and yowl
against this Queen in their pitiful im
potence. For it was a thorough opera
tion.
Now this howling is the cause of
my complaint. We, the respectable
part of the population, are becoming
annoyed by it.
When the old gang was in the sad
dle they carried on in their ridiculous
and amusing fashion quite as harm
lessly as does any Rotary Club. And
that is even to be preferred to this
present display of ill taste, which so
grates the nerves of anyone with any
delicacy of feeling and betrays so
obviously the truth of the poor breed
ing, coarseness, and unsportsmanlike
yelping of those who hog no more.
