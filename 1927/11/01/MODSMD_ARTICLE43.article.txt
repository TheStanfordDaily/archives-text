Yesterday's Stanford Daily, unoffi
cially I hope, threw the worst splash 1
of mud against the sportsmanship and
hospitality of the high-flung banner
of Stanford that has yet been thrown
by her sons in betrayal of her inspira
tion. And, worst of all, because of its
peculiar nature, there can ho no 112
apology made for the damage done.
Hereafter may the Daily keep people
with inferiority complexes otY the j
front page, and the editorial columns. |
God bless our Queen.
