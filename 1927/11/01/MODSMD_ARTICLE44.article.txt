The Editor, Sir:
Concerning your editorial, "Another
Bloomer." While the women of the
campus do appreciate your interest
in their activities—and activeness — i
nevertheless we should suggest that |
you do some research into the ques
tion of track suits before passing edi

#' torial judgment.
Two years ago there was consider
able agitation about the black impedi
menta known as "gym suits," and
with a view to their abolition several
varieties of track suits were imported
from San Francisco as possible
models. Noi»e of them were accepted
i by the authorities, so the women were
forced to effect a compromise by de-
I signing the present "rompers." It
has never been for lack of agitation
that we are not wearing track suits,
but time and persistency will undoubt-
I euly win in the end.
