LEXINGTON, Mo., Oct. 31 (U.P.â€”
Open warfare between rival factions in
the coal fields of Lafayette and Ray
counties sprung' up here today when 700
regular union miners forcibly prohibited
250 independent union workmen from en
tering the mines.
Local authorities, fearing that order
could not be enforced, telephoned to Kan
sas City asking the use of police reserves.
Chief William A. Shreeve told the au
thorities here that he doubted the legality
of sending patrolmen but would take the
matter up with the police coriimissioners
immediately.
Several fist fights and local disturb
ances were at least partially quelled
when milling crowds were dispersed by
the sheriff and deputies.
