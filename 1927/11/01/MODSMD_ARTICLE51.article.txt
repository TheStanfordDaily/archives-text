UNAPPRECIATED?
It seems to be a sad but true
fact that the Stanford football
team is not without honor save in
its home area. A Tacoma sports
writer quotes Coach "Cac" Hub
bard of the College of Puget
Sound as follows "I have seen two
great lines —that developed by
Lone Star Dietz at Washington
State in 1915 and that developed
by Pop Warner at Stanford this
year."
The tight-lipped connoisseurs
hereabouts have not so far been
so open in their praises of the
Redshirts as are the Purple and
Gold supporters.
Moreover, it is an open secret
that the varsity fails by far to
attract as large crowds at home
as it does when it goes a-visiting.
The fact is indeed a melancholy
one, witness the 35,000 empty
seats at the varsity-US.C. thriller.
MORE MUD TO THROW
It is beginning to get quite dis
couraging. We have just finished
a further demonstration of the
orgy of good feeling existing be
tween Stanford and the Trojans
only to discover that the Wash
ington sports writers again are en
deavoring to open the old wound
made in 1925 when Ernie Nevers'
team complained of the beating it
took on the rock-strewn Seattle
field, protesting against the con
dition of the gridiron and the
refereeing of the game.
One writer says The Washing
ton-Stanford game "may have that
'grudge''angle if you will, but there
is something to the game that no
other contest on the Husky pro
gram brings forth.
"Stanford, the Cardinal Criers,
if you persist, is again fighting on
Washington soil and—on that
'boulder-strewn field!' Yea, boul
ders, powerful sons of Washing
ton, physically trained, mentally
alert, boulders in the form of a
gridiron stonewall. Come ahead,
Stanford! Fight there shall be!
. . . If defeat comes, there will
be no 'boulder' bawl, but a clean
admittance from Stanford that
the better team won."
So help us, God, may there be
the desired "clean admittance,"
if Stanford loses, that we may be
spared a series of good-will as
semblies and other strained ef
forts to patch shaky relations be
tween the two schools.
