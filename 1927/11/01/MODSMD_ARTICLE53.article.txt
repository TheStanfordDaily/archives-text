# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Shades of Heston, Thorpe, Coy, and
Maulbetsch! That's Herb Joesting.
The rush and roar of the Twentieth j
Century Limited, the charge of an in
furiated rhinoceros, the impact of Jack j
Dempsey's left hook crashing into the |
punching-bag and knocking it loose j
from its moorings—these, too, are like I
Herb Joesting in action; for this blond j
behemoth of the North, this thunder
bolt from Owatonna, smashes into the
line like a shell from Big Bertha,
against Michigan on November 19.
When you dissect Herb's attributes,
you realize some of the reasons for

I bowling over tachlers right and left,
j and leaving a wake of injured in his
j trail!
Seriously speaking, "The Terrible
I Swede," as opponents of the great
I Minnesota fullback are wont to call
| him, is the most vicious line-plunger
| that football has seen in years. He
l was the outstanding back of 192G, a
unanimous choice for Ail-American
honors, and now, as captain of Doc
Spears's powerful Gopher team, will
have ample opportunity to test his
power and ability, barring injuries,
against Notre Oarne on Saturday and

his success. Twenty-two years old, |
six feet one inch tall, weighing 192
pounds, with tremendously powerful i
hips and a high knee-action, and 1
blessed with the fighting spirit of his i
Morse ancestors, it is little wonder
that he is nearly unstoppable until he
has gained at least five yards.
Nearly one thousand yards he
plunged through all opposition in eight
games last season, proved "positively '
wicked" in running interference, and
a high-class defensive player. No
wonder that Coach Yost of Michigan
called him "the greatest back in the j
West." This fierce, pile-driving, pow
erful runner is fast for his weight,
and always tears straight ahead, slip- ;
ping, lunging, diving, plowing, smash
ing—it's no wonder they call him
"Thundering Herb"!
