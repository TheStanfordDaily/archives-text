# FRESHMAN GRID MEN GET INTO SHAPE FOR TILT WITH U.C. CUBS
## Extensive Rest Gives Babes Opportunity to Recover From Injuries 
### 
Only four more practice sessions
remain for Coach Husky Hunt to make
last-minute changes, and to perfect
the performance of his freshman squad
for the Little Big Game with the Uni
versity of California yearlings to be
held in the stadium Saturday.
The rest granted the babes last
week-end came as a real boon and
furnished an opportunity for those on
the extensive injured list to set back
into shape. Shifting the Santa Barbara
State eleven onto the Grays was a
wise move. A game with the South
erners could have been no possible
advantage, and it might have proved
fatal to Card chances against the
Berkeley team.
Moffat's place is, of course, hard to
fill, but it has been two weeks since
he was injured, a period long enough
to accomplish considerable in the way
of closing the breach. Hillman has
been shifted from fullback to half,
and is being groomed for the job. He
has been a steady player all season
with plenty of weight, and a football
head. He has looked good in practice,
and by Saturday he will be familiar
enough with the work to hold down
the position effectively.
Stanford's line, sadly mangled
against the Trojans, is getting into
action again. Captain Heiser, Bogue,
Bigelow, and the others should be in
good shape by Saturday, barring pos
sible accidents in practice.
