# FLOATING UNIVERSITY GROWS IN POPULARITY
## 
### 
The popularity of the floating uni
versity is growing since the inaugura
tion of the idea last year. No student
who expects to go on the ship leaving
New York October 6, 1928, can regis
ter after Febuary 1, 1928.
Several new graduate courses have
been added, including those in geo
graphical, historical, political, eco
nomic, and social conditions, and na
tive art, music, and drama. While the
students are being taught these sub
jects, they see the world and exam
ples illustrating their studies.
