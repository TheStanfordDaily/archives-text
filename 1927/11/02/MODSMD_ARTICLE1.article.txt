# YEAR'S BIGGEST SEND-OFF RALLY SET FOR TODAY
## Two Bonfires, Parade, Band, Special Stunts Will Be Features NERO TO PLAY ZITHER Rooters Meet at 2 O'clock; Will Go With Varsity To S.P. Depot 
### 
With the two promised bonfires already i
reaching toward the skies at the Engi- ,
neering corner, rooters will meet around
them at 2 o'clock this afternoon for the I
biggest send-otT rally of the year, prep- j
aratory to following the varsity down to i
■the Southern Pacific depot, where it j
leaves at 3 o'clock for Washington.
Twenty pieces from the hand have |
been secured to play at the rally, and
■will lead the parade to the depot. Spe
cial stunts are also planned, but their i
details are being kept secret, except for !
Nero's proposed zither recital, which is I
being advertised only at the request of j
the eminent musician himself.
At latest reports the Rally Commit- j
tee's pyre was leading in the race for j
height by a margin of two barrel staves
and a four-inch redwood splinter, but i
the freshmen are prepared for a last-1
minute rush and may be able to over- |
come this lead. Guards will be posted j
all morning to prevent premature con- J
flragations.
