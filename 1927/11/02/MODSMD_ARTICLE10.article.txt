the discussion gi'oup commission.
About six groups, with eight or nine
members each, will be organized this
week. Upperclass women, selected as
leaders, will be changed from time to
time throughout the year. Meetings
will be held every Thursday night.
Last week the new women met in
two groups to discuss the question,
"What I expect to get from my college
life."
