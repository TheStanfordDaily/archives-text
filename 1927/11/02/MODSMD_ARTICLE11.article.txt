# ALFRED HERTZ PLANS BIG GAME SYMPHONY
## 
### 
Alfred Hertz, conductor of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra and
composer of rank, has conceived the
idea of writing a symphony about the
Big Game.
Last year he attended his first Big
Game, when the cheering of the enor
mous crowds, the yells of the root
ing sections, and the University bands
all suggested powerful music to him.
This year tho Hoard of Athletic
Control has secured tickets for Dr.
Hertz in order that he may attend
again, and plan further his "Big Game
Symphony."
