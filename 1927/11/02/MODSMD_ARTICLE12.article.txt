# DUET WATCHES WORLD PASSING HIS BALCONY

### Margaret Cummings 
"Wait for the swinging of the pen- j
dulum —this is what my balcony has j
taught me," advised Abbe Ernest!
Dimnet, smiling as he imparted to his j
audience snatches of the wisdom he j
has gleaned in his twenty-five years' j
observation of his own country and \
the world from his Paris balcony, in j
his lecture last night in the Little j
Theatre.
From his vantage point, the Abbe
watched the currents flowing in the j
literature, politics, and economics of
his country.
French Literature Changes
French literature he depicted in its
swing away from the influence of Ana
tole France, who was long regarded ;
as the leading French stylist with his i
grace, and cheer, and beauty of lan- j
guage, toward the more direct and
impassioned presentation advocated
by the modern school. This reaction '
he gave as due directly to the war. j
Keenly aware, as a Frenchman, to j
France's attitude toward Germany and j
the war, he has watched the gradual
swing of his countrymen's sentiment j
toward paciflstic ideals, and their de- j
sire for the international co-operation i
wlich he feeis is finding its beginning j
in such a venture as the League of
Nations.
Economic Readjustments Made
France's economic readjustments
Abbe Dimnet touched briefly, rejoic
ing in the gains made during this last
year.
The lessons his balcony taught him
in contemplation and independent con
sideration —"to wait for the swing of
the pendulum"—is the message the
Abbe aims to bring his American
audiences in this review of his twenty
five years' observation.
