# EX COMMITTEE PLAMS TO LIMIT DIMENSIONS OF FUTURE BONFIRES
## 
### 
Dimensions for future Big Game bon
fires were determined on last night by
the Ex Committee as thirty by thirty feet
at the base and forty feet high, not
counting the California coffin. These are
approximately the measurements of last
year's bonfire built by the class of 1930,
which Rally Committee officials declare
to have been one of the most successful
ever built.
Six new members were also appointed
to the Rally Committee, bringing its total
membership up to thirty-eight, including
eight ex-officio members. Those appointed
were: William Glen, Virginia Moulton,
Alexis Ehrman, R. Frank Baker, Sidney
Madden, James Sapero.
