# SEARCH REALMS OF HUMOR TO MEASURE LAUGH-ABILITY
## 
### Calvin Wood 
What is it that droll fellow, the col
lege buffoon, finds as his most potent,
sure-fire laugh-getter? What joke in
two hundred failed utterly to tickle
the sense of humor of one person in
one thousand? And question of all |
questions, what is the philosopher's ;
stone of the jokester that turns the j
dull into the sparkling, the stupid into
the subtle, and the dreary jest into
the pungent bon mot?
A tall, reserved gentleman, profes
sor by calling, and searcher into the |
realms by avocation, has the distinc
tion of answering these questions.
Calmly taking the scientific method

in one hand and a large assortment
of contemporary wise-cracks in the
other, he has brewed them together
in the pot of serious endeavor, con
cocting scientific solutions.
Humor Test Devised
For example, he has evolved a test
whereby he can approximate "laugh
ability"; that is to say, the sense of
humor of a man. He has found that
college jesters resort to the topic,
necking, as their infallible laugh
source. And the one joke in two hun
dred that couldn't arouse a snicker
from one of a thousand readers ap
peared in the Stanford Chaparral.
