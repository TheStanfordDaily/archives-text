# SEARCH REALMS OF HUMOR TO MEASURE LAUGH-ABILITY
## 
### Calvin Wood 
What is it that droll fellow, the col
lege buffoon, finds as his most potent,
sure-fire laugh-getter? What joke in
two hundred failed utterly to tickle
the sense of humor of one person in
one thousand? And question of all |
questions, what is the philosopher's ;
stone of the jokester that turns the j
dull into the sparkling, the stupid into
the subtle, and the dreary jest into
the pungent bon mot?
A tall, reserved gentleman, profes
sor by calling, and searcher into the |
realms by avocation, has the distinc
tion of answering these questions.
Calmly taking the scientific method

in one hand and a large assortment
of contemporary wise-cracks in the
other, he has brewed them together
in the pot of serious endeavor, con
cocting scientific solutions.
Humor Test Devised
For example, he has evolved a test
whereby he can approximate "laugh
ability"; that is to say, the sense of
humor of a man. He has found that
college jesters resort to the topic,
necking, as their infallible laugh
source. And the one joke in two hun
dred that couldn't arouse a snicker
from one of a thousand readers ap
peared in the Stanford Chaparral.
Contrary to the American credo
that says fat men, mothers-in-law, old
maids, and umbrellas are fanny, this
gentleman has proven them other
wise. And the sovereign recipe of all
wit? Well, what do you want for
nothing?
Researcher Is Dr. Almack
This researcher in the field of hu
mor is Dr. John C. Almack, professor
of education. Dr. Almack, beginning
in 1921, analyzed and classified every
joke appearing in the Spice of Life
and in the Topics in Brief columns of
the Literary Digest. Up to date he
has classified G4lB jokes.
In devising his sense of humor test,
a group of two hundred jokes was
selected. These two hundred jokes
Dr. Almack placed on two sheets.
Those taking the test were to grade
them as "very funny," "fairly funny,"
and "not funny." At the bottom of
one of the sheets this injunction ap
pears, "Rank your own sense of hu
mor by underlining one of the follow
ing letters: superior A, very good B,
average C, poor D, lacking E."
Curious Results Found
The test was given to a thousand
people with these results: five per
cent of the jokes were rated very
funny, forty-five per cent fairly so,
and fifty per cent not funny at all.
Married women had a keener sense
ol' humor than tliei rliusbands. No one
rated himself as lacking. College stu
dents rated themselves higher than
results showed they should have. Fac
ulty members rated themselves as A
or Band most of them should have
checked D or E.
College Humor Is Puns
From an examination of two thou
sand jokes from college publications,
he discovered that two-thirds of the
collegians' jokes are puns. These
topics in order of importance, he de
termined, are the college man's idea

of joking matters: petting, kissing, i
woman's dress, bootlegging, drinking,
ridicule of marriage, stupid acts, bad
classroom conduct, modern engage
ments, freshmen, and flappers.
