WASHINGTON, Nov. 2.—The Fall-
Sinclair Teapot Dome Trial appears
likely to be stopped today because of
charges that attempts were made in
behalf of Harry F. Sinclair to influ
ence the jury. Defense lawyers an
nounced tonight they would join in
requesting a mis-trial.
Thus it seems probable that through
a midnight telephone call from a
street car conductor who had heard a
juror talking about the case, this
famous trial, carried half-way through
at tremendous expense, involving
nearly two hundred witnesses and
many thousands of dollars, will come
to a dead stop, half finished.
The Government, in its affidavits
of charges, drew a. picture of a juror,
Edward J. Kidwell, a leather worker,
who sat for days in the jury box, leav
ing the courtroom and going into a
soft-drink parlor, telling his friends
that he saw nothing for Sinclair in
a conviction.
Newspaper Gets Evidence
The affidavits offered in court by
the U. S. District Attorneys who
worked on the case, the street car
conductor and the newspaper reporter,
tell the whole story in vivid detail.
Donald T. King, reporter on the
Washington Herald, who traced down
a rumor that reached his office, swore
in his affadvit that he answered the
telephone at his office about midnight
last Friday and was told that "they
are going to hang the jury."
The message was telephoned by
J. R. Akers, the street car conductor.
Akers arranged for himself and King
to meet Kidwell the next day in front
of a soft drink place.
Expresses Admiration for Sinclair
He discussed the case with Kidwell
and that during a conversation be
tween himself, Kidwell, and King, the
reporter, Kidwell expressed great ad
miration for Sinclair because of Sin
clair's democratic manner.
For tampering with a jury, the pen
alty may go as high as one year in
prison and a fine of $1000. For a con
spiracy to tamper with a jury, the
penalty may reach six years in prison
and a $5000 fine.
