# FRESHMEN TO STAGE PAJAMARINO TONIGHT FOR LITTLE BIG GAME
## 
### 
The freshman pajamarino will be
held tonight in preparation for the
Little Big Game which will be played
this Saturday in the stadium. Fresh
men will meet in the lobby of Encina
at 7 o'clock. They will appear dressed
in pajamas over their clothes.
The event will be under the direc
tion of Sergius Klotz and Scott Web
ster, assistant yell-leaders, and in
structions for the parade will be given
at the start. This annual pajamarino
has nothing to do with the Washing
ton game. It is held for the Little
Big Game.
