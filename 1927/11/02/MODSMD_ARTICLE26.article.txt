# CARDS TO FACE UNBEATEN TEAM IN HUSKY PACK
## Saturday's Gridiron Battle Called Grudge Fight by Sports Writers TWENTY-NINE GO NORTH Varsity Up Against Strong Line; Last Year's Men Reclaim Positions 
### Milton Silverman 
On tho Southern Pacific Cascade
tonight will be a Stanford football
team bound for what northern sport
writers are trying to paint up as a
grudge fight. But it won't be a grudge
fight at all. Stanford had its share
of hard-boiled football games and
track moet3 last year, and Washing
ton must have noticed the bad re
sults. If there is any argument on the
game, il will be entirely on the ques
tion of the final outcome.

LEAVE FOR SEATTLE TODAY

Following is the list of men to
be taken to Seattle today as an
nounced by Encina gym: Harder,
Preston, Worden, Vincenti, Da
vidson, Muller, ends; Sellman,
Freeman, Klabau, tackles; Ro
besky, Post, Macabee, Kazanjian,
Morley, guards; McCreery, Hein
ecke, Cook, centers; Murphy,
Lewis, quarters; Hyland, Hill,
Sims, Patchett, Wilton, Frentrup,
halves; Smalling, Fleishhacker,
Hoffman, Joseph, fulls.

At Washington is a team that is
unknown in southern athletics so far
this season. The Huskies have no
black marks against their name, but
the type of competition they have re
ceived would scarcely make a fighting
grammar school team rise to the oc
casion.
Huskies Defeat Cougars
Last month, in the critical early-sea
son game, the Huskies walloped down
the impolite championship demands
of the W.S.C. Cougars to the tune of
14 to 0. But since that time these
terrific Cougars also bowed to a few
gentle farmers from Oregon State.
And then on the other hand, as they
say, Washington is not yet devoid of
football players, although practice on
the famous rock-bound stadium of
Seattle may remedy that. For exam
ple, there is a line that has played
together for nearly three years, and
by this time is fairly Avell coordi
nated.
Washington Line Strong
Scliuh and Douglas are two im
mense ends, each better than Jud
Cutting, the only Huskie lineman lost
by graduation last year. At tackle are
Brix, Dirks, and Broz, three gentle
men of one syllable and lots of power
apiece. Brix, who was injured early in
the season, has not had much of a
chance to play football, but is sure of
an opportunity to give either Free
man or Sellman a sample of real
Seattle hospitality.
Wright and Huhta will do the hon
ors at guard, with Bob Shaw ready to
replace either. Gene Cook, who, at
the start of the season was rated as
the best drop-kick artist on the coast,
finds no place in the line-up. Romeo
"Adonis" Lauzon is a center on the
type of Walt Heinecke. "Adonis,"
however, has managed to shove the
regular center, Bonamy, into the back
ground.

SEATTLE, Nov. I.—(IT.P.)—Two
reports of ticket scalping were re
ported at the office of Darwin Meis
nest., manager of Washington ath
letics, pasteboards for the Stanford-
Washington game being offered for
$15 each. There are 6000 tickets left
at the end of the field but they are
not expected to last beyond tomorrow.
