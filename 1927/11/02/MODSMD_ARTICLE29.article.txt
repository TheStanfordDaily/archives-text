# Satisfy the Managers
## 
### 
Another "proposed plan" which had been tinder discussion for
several days deals with the appointment of a Musical Manager (or his
equivalent under some similar title) whose duties will be to co-ordinate
the work of the various musical organizations on the campus. Coming
under this head are the Band, the Glee Clubs, the Orchestra, and the
Concert Series.
We have always looked askance at "one man manager" plans. They
centralize too much power in one person's hands and remove responsi
bility from subordinate managers as well as break down a certain sense
of office. What's the use of being a manager of some particular
organization if you are merely subordinate to another man who may not
know as much as you do about your own organization?
The discussion of this plan brings campus attention to several lines
of improvement that are possible along musical lines. Advocates of the
Musical Manager scheme say that these improvements will sooner or
later come with the introduction of the plan. Well, that may or may
not be. For one thing the Orchestra and the Glee Clubs could give a
combined program which we predict would arouse considerable interest.
For another thing, an extension of trips taken by the Men's Glee Club
would lie of double benefit to the University and the Club itself. The
Concert Series is taking care of itself and is doing a very good job of it.
Whatever plan is adopted should be carefully worked out in accord
ance with the desires of the managers of the organizations concerned.
If they choose to have a Musical Council, then let them have one.
But if the same good can be achieved without having to select one
central manager, we see no reason why such a central manager should
be chosen.
