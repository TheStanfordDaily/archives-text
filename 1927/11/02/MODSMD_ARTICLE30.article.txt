# Two Events

### 
Stanford's send-off rally for the Washington game and the annual
freshman Pajamarino are both on the calendar for today's events. To
Stanford's football standing the Washington game is of vital importance.
The Huskies lead the conference with two victories; the Cardinals have
two victories and one tie game. For either team to lose would mean
an almost certain loss of the chance to win the Coast laurels.
The afternoon rally, then, means something to the team and to the
rooters. The Pajamarino, however, is of more immediate concern to
the freshmen. Coming this year as a rally preceding the Little Big
Game it rests with the freshmen to perform a duty similar to that
which faces the send-off rally rooters.
