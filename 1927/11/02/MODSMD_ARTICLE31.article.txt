# A 						Treasure Hunt
## 
### 
The new By-Law Revision Committee has a rocky road before it.
If its difficulties parallel those of last year's Constitution Committee, it
might be wise for each member of the committee to apply now for
leave of absence.
Heckling and bickering is ahead in a wilderness the paths of which
are mapped about as clearly as a treasure hunt. Last year's by-laws
are, as Murray Draper points out, contradictory, out of date, and of
little use to the average student.
Even after the task is completed there will be objections and ques
tions as to the meaning of various clauses, as is now the case with the
new A.S.S.U. constitution. Suggestions, of course, will be welcomed
by the committee. It is, as has often been remarked, "A very hard
undertaking to try to please everyone."
