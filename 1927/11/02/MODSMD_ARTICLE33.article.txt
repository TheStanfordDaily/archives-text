In llie opinion of many disgruntled
students milling around the ticket
windows of last Saturday's football
game, there was a preliminary con
test in which the students of Palo
Alto and other peninsula high schools
triumphed over the sons and daugh
ters of the Stanford Red by a score
of fifty cents to $1.00. This advance in
price for Conference games was called
everything from unexpected on. And
the spectacle of the high school lads
and lassies getting in for the usual
four-bit admission fee did nothing but
salt the wound. Caustic comments
were plentiful, especially from those
who came with nothing more than the
customary A.S.S.U. card and half dol
lar and who departed, unable to see
even the Daily-Chappie classic be
tween halves .
Many "how come's" have been re
ceived by the Daily, and, as the neces
sary elucidation requires somewhat
more space than can be given to any
one problem in the regular question
and answer column, the results of our
inquiries are here offered.
Firstly, let it be said that those old
timers who swore up and down that
they never, never, never had heard
of such a thing before were correct;
the Oregon fracas was the first of its

calibre for which an entire iron n\an
hp.s been demanded. Last year our
game with Washington was a reserved
seat affair for which ticket applications
were sent out. In the previous year,
1925, only fifty cents was charged for
both the Oregon and Oregon Aggies
contests, and so through the seasons
preceding it.
It has been the policy of the Board
of Athletic Control to admit those
aged 16 years or under for a fifty
cent charge. The possession of a high
school student body card has been
taken as sufficient evidence that the
possessor was within the required
limit. Naturally no young hopeful is
going to plead being 17 years old
when it means the difference between
fifty cents and $2.00.
An agreement with Oregon, similar
to the ones in effect with other con
ference teams specifies the ticket
price basis on which the division of
receipts shall be made. In the case
of the Webfeet this price is $1.00. In
the past, the Board has simply re
linquished its half of the specified
one berry when the game was played
here. Now with the new stadium ad
dition, Athletic Building, etc., such
altruism is inadvisable. So there is
the situation. —Herbert Klein.

receipts shall be made. In the case
of the Webfeet this price is $1.00. In
the past, the Board has simply re
linquished its half of the specified
one berry when the game was played
here. Now with the new stadium ad
dition, Athletic Building, etc., such
altruism is inadvisable. So there is
the situation. —Herbert Klein.
In llie opinion of many disgruntled
students milling around the ticket
windows of last Saturday's football
game, there was a preliminary con
test in which the students of Palo
Alto and other peninsula high schools
triumphed over the sons and daugh
ters of the Stanford Red by a score
of fifty cents to $1.00. This advance in
price for Conference games was called
everything from unexpected on. And
the spectacle of the high school lads
and lassies getting in for the usual
four-bit admission fee did nothing but
salt the wound. Caustic comments
were plentiful, especially from those
who came with nothing more than the
customary A.S.S.U. card and half dol
lar and who departed, unable to see
even the Daily-Chappie classic be
tween halves .
Many "how come's" have been re
ceived by the Daily, and, as the neces
sary elucidation requires somewhat
more space than can be given to any
one problem in the regular question
and answer column, the results of our
inquiries are here offered.
Firstly, let it be said that those old
timers who swore up and down that
they never, never, never had heard
of such a thing before were correct;
the Oregon fracas was the first of its

calibre for which an entire iron n\an
hp.s been demanded. Last year our
game with Washington was a reserved
seat affair for which ticket applications
were sent out. In the previous year,
1925, only fifty cents was charged for
both the Oregon and Oregon Aggies
contests, and so through the seasons
preceding it.
It has been the policy of the Board
of Athletic Control to admit those
aged 16 years or under for a fifty
cent charge. The possession of a high
school student body card has been
taken as sufficient evidence that the
possessor was within the required
limit. Naturally no young hopeful is
going to plead being 17 years old
when it means the difference between
fifty cents and $2.00.
An agreement with Oregon, similar
to the ones in effect with other con
ference teams specifies the ticket
price basis on which the division of
receipts shall be made. In the case
of the Webfeet this price is $1.00. In
the past, the Board has simply re
