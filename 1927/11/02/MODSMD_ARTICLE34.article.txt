# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It was with some amusement that I
read the recent criticism of "The Lady
of the Rose," and, too, the editorial
comment, for it was just what I had ex
pected, and there is at times a satisfac
tion in the fulfillment of expectations.
Let me say, however, that your critical
judgment is a good deal keener than
that of your worthy dramatics critic,
for you did notice the comedy of the
theatrical producer was overdone, while
the honorable H. K. immediately handed
the laurels to that and the one other
comcdy character. Too often the slogan
on this campus seems to be, "It's funny;
it's good." Of course, such an attitude
would not be unlikely to the now tradi
tional aeroplane-turowing audiences.
Lucie Bentley, we arc told, "managed
to do fairly well in the matter of inter
pretation of such a role." I ask anyone
who has an appreciation sensitive and
broad enough to comprehend things
deeper than football shows —with all re
spect for those shows—to tell me when
a more delightful and more convincing
interpretation has been seen on the Stan
ford stage. Miss Bcntley's voice is one
of the most exquisite I have ever heard
in amateur theatrical work. It is ex
mark written in anaemic vein of humor
tremely melodious, well modulated, preg
nant with delicate nuances. In her in
terpretation I found an ethereality and
a poetic sensuousness combined which
were just as moving and as exquisite as,
say, the more atmospheric things of De
bussy.
The remark about Howard McCone
biting his kunckles convincingly at times
of harrowing emotional stress is as stupid
as it is absurd. It is only another re
which "higher journalism" seems to too
often provoke. Obviously if one could
see so little in Miss Bcntlcy, he could
not be expected to receive more stimu
lation from the interpretation of McCone
than the above remark would indicate.
H. K. does not seem to realize that
dramatic interpretation to be convincing
must be more than "registering emotion."
and that the phrase "biting his knuckles"
can apply just as thoroughly to a languid
country bumpkin watching the hay being
brought in. I attended some rehearsals
of the play, and neither then nor in the
final performance did I notice any con
sistent biting of knuckles. 11. K. over

! looks entirely the intensity, the high
pitch, of McCoue's presentation, and the
fact that his portrayal was inspired, was
I moving, poetic. These overshadowed the
! effect of somewhat staccato gesture.
I said that H. K.'s criticism was
amusing. May I add that it was. how
ever, no more amusing than all tHej
j others written on dramatic and music
| events for the past three years.
j Miss Price is to be commended on the

selection of such a play as "The Lady of I
the Rose," for it is an essentially difficult j
play, difficult from all angles, technical
and dramatic. There is nut a single sit- |
tuition which can carry itself. It means :
hard work on the part of the director
and cast. It is due to the fact that the j
play is one of the most difficult ever at
tempted on the campus that a few er
rors 011 t,he part of the stage crew were,
perhaps a bit more noticeable than usual.
Miss Price, 1 think, has made her of
ficial bow to the campus effectively and i
with dignity, and those of us who are |
looking for something ti bit deeper than I
farce, and those who can appreciate a!
play founded upon the poetry of an idea j
enjoyed immensely "The Lady of the j
Rose."

sistent biting of knuckles. 11. K. over

! looks entirely the intensity, the high
pitch, of McCoue's presentation, and the
fact that his portrayal was inspired, was
I moving, poetic. These overshadowed the

I said that H. K.'s criticism was
amusing. May I add that it was. how
ever, no more amusing than all tHej
j others written on dramatic and music
| events for the past three years.
j Miss Price is to be commended on the

selection of such a play as "The Lady of I
the Rose," for it is an essentially difficult j
play, difficult from all angles, technical
and dramatic. There is nut a single sit- |
tuition which can carry itself. It means :
hard work on the part of the director
and cast. It is due to the fact that the j
play is one of the most difficult ever at
tempted on the campus that a few er
rors 011 t,he part of the stage crew were,
perhaps a bit more noticeable than usual.
Miss Price, 1 think, has made her of
ficial bow to the campus effectively and i
with dignity, and those of us who are |
looking for something ti bit deeper than I
farce, and those who can appreciate a!
play founded upon the poetry of an idea j
enjoyed immensely "The Lady of the j
Rose."

The Editor, Sir:
It was with some amusement that I
read the recent criticism of "The Lady
of the Rose," and, too, the editorial
comment, for it was just what I had ex
pected, and there is at times a satisfac
tion in the fulfillment of expectations.
Let me say, however, that your critical
judgment is a good deal keener than
that of your worthy dramatics critic,
for you did notice the comedy of the
theatrical producer was overdone, while
the honorable H. K. immediately handed
the laurels to that and the one other
comcdy character. Too often the slogan
on this campus seems to be, "It's funny;
it's good." Of course, such an attitude
would not be unlikely to the now tradi
tional aeroplane-turowing audiences.
Lucie Bentley, we arc told, "managed
to do fairly well in the matter of inter
pretation of such a role." I ask anyone
who has an appreciation sensitive and
broad enough to comprehend things
deeper than football shows —with all re
spect for those shows—to tell me when
a more delightful and more convincing
interpretation has been seen on the Stan
ford stage. Miss Bcntley's voice is one
of the most exquisite I have ever heard
in amateur theatrical work. It is ex
mark written in anaemic vein of humor
tremely melodious, well modulated, preg
nant with delicate nuances. In her in
terpretation I found an ethereality and
a poetic sensuousness combined which
were just as moving and as exquisite as,
say, the more atmospheric things of De
bussy.
The remark about Howard McCone
biting his kunckles convincingly at times
of harrowing emotional stress is as stupid
as it is absurd. It is only another re
which "higher journalism" seems to too
often provoke. Obviously if one could
see so little in Miss Bcntlcy, he could
not be expected to receive more stimu
lation from the interpretation of McCone
than the above remark would indicate.
H. K. does not seem to realize that
dramatic interpretation to be convincing
must be more than "registering emotion."
and that the phrase "biting his knuckles"
can apply just as thoroughly to a languid
country bumpkin watching the hay being
brought in. I attended some rehearsals
of the play, and neither then nor in the
final performance did I notice any con
sistent biting of knuckles. 11. K. over
