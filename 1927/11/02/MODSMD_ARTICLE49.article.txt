# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
As Julius Caesar might have said,
"All Gall is divided into three parts— !
brass, nerve, and cheek." But the kind |
of "nerve" dealt with in this piece is
not the Gallic nerve that inspired a \
fresh freshman to walk up to All-
American Sprackling as he stood on
the steps of the Brown University j
Union talking with some friends and
announce: "I'm coming out for quar
terback, and I expect to make it. I
can run the 100 in ten-one and the
220 in evens and I'm a gotod quarter
back. I'm going to beat you out of j
your job!"
No, that's a little too nervy, but it
left Sprackling speechless, at any
rate. (N.B. The freshman did NOT get
the job!) The kind of nerve under
discussion here is courage, an ice
cold control of the emotions during
the heat of conflict, as well as the
ability to take desperate chances,
chances in which a match may be
lost if things go wrong, or in which
the athlete may be badly hurt physi
cally if his effort fails —or even if it
succeeds.
Walter Hagen is noted for his cool-1
ness, his cockiness, and his ability to
play phenomenal golf when the odds j
against him are the highest. Sir Wal- '
ter is now defending his Professional
Golfer's title in the annual P.G.A.
tournament at the Cedar Crest Coun
try Club, Dallas, Texas. Hagen has
held the title three years in a row, j
and, as the year 1927 has not been so j
hard on champions as its predecessor, j
it seems that he has a fine chance of
making it four years in a row. An ■
example of Hagen's nerve in a tight
place was well illustrated the time he
had to sink a 30-foot put in a Texas |
tournament to win $750. He looked i
over the difficult task that confronted
him, and then modestly announced to .
a breathless gallery, "Do you think I
could miss that putt for $750? Not on ;
your life." After which he proceeded j
to can the ball and win the money, j

Oh yes, "The Lion of the Links" is
good, and he knows it!
Coolness, confidence, and an iron
nerve are often seen on the gridiron,
on the diamond, and in the ring, other
wise there would be no Tunneys, no
Mullers, Hardwicks, Winsletts, and
Hansons, and no Pennocks, Moores,
and Miljuses.
