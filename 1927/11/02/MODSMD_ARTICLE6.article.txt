# J.C. EMERSON CALLS MEETING TO DISCUSS S.C. DEBATE TRYOUTS
## 
### 
A general meeting of all men inter
i ested in debating will be held this
evening at 7 o'clock in Room 201. The
main purpose of the gathering, which
will be presided over by Professor
I James Gordon Emerson, debate coach,
I is to discuss the tryouts of the dual
■ debate with U.S.C. and the squad de-
I bates. Only one tryout will he held
j for both teams at which four men will
be selected for the U.S.C. debate,
j From this number and from the men
i now working on the California de
i bate Professor Emerson will make the
final selections. This is being done as
those men working on the California
• question would not have sufficient
| time to prepare for the tryouts which
j will be held shortly after the Bear
debate.
The discussion will be over in time
to allow men to attend the Euphronia
J Debating Society meeting.
