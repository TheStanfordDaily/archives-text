# NORTHBOUND SQUAD GIVEN DUCK DINNER BY OREGON ALUMNI
## 
### 
Stanford alumni at Klamath
Falls, Oregon, were on hand to
greet Pop Warner's men and to
present them with apples, grapes,
and other fruit when the train
carrying the team to the battle
with the Washington Huskies
stopped in that city for a few
minutes early this morning. The
makings of a wild duck dinner
were also but aboard the train by
the alumni.
In previous years the Cards
have traveled to Seattle by the
Shasta Route, and during these
years were cheered on their way
by the "old grads" at Medford.
This year, however, the train
passed through Klamath Falls
on the new Cascade line, and the
alumni of that city had their first
opportunity to cheer a north
bound squad.
