# Rooters Send Varsity Team Off To Seattle At Washington Rally
## 
### 
Despite the unexpected absence of
Nero and his trusty zither, some 400
Cardinal rooters gathered at the
Engineering corner yesterday after
noon to watch the retired emperor
light the fires that would prophesy
Washington's fate, and succeeded in
singing, yelling, and parading down to
the S.P. depot to send the Stanford
varsity off to Seattle in the approved
fashion. It was explained that the
zither had suffered a broken cylinder.
A loud cheer that arose when Yell
Leader A1 Cass touched off the fresh
man bonfire that would have won the
pyre-building contest for 19:31, had not
the Rally Committee decided that its
own fire was the more artistically
constructed and should be awarded
the decision.
Twenty members of the band pro
vided most of the afternoon's enter
tainment, filling in the many vacant
spaces on the program with popular
selections, and leading the parade to
the station, where a long half-hour
of determined rooting succeeded in
attracting a train to take the team
north.
