Playing the first practice game of the

junior hockey team defeated the fresh

squad maintained a strong defense. Al
though the juniors continually threatened
the freshmen's goal, they were able to
force through only one score made by
Helen North.
Approximately in the middle of the
second half the freshmen team weak
ened, allowing the juniors to make five
goals in the remaining time. Two were
made by Helen North and three by
Eleanor Patten, who twice carried the
ball in a field run to score.

formance and good playing judgment,
particularly in the cases of Captain Sue
Betty Dunlap, Beatrice J ago, and Ruth
Rosebcrry. The juniors have better team
work as a result of playing together in
former games.
