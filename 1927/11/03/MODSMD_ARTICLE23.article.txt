# CARDS, HUSKIES WELL MATCHED IN BACKFIELDS
## Frentrup, Hoffman, Patchett, Lewis Equal Northern Stars Man to Man HILL LIKELY TO START Captain Pat Wilson, "Chuck" Carroll Are Threats of Washington Team 
### Milton Silverman 
Lutl Frentrup and Chuck Carroll.
Ernie Patchett and Louis Tesreau.
Spud Lewis and Johnny Geehan. Biff
Hoffman and Captain Pat Wilson.
Here are four Redshirts and four Hus
kies who will stage a battle in the
North Saturday that might easily
grind the Seattle rock-stadium into
chalk-dust.
• Unless the Washington grid is con
verted into a lake-bottom, Wilton and
Hill will probably be Warner's choices
lo start against the Purple and Gold.
The Frentrup-Patchett combination,
however, is reasonably sure of a trial
against Coach Bagshaw's outfit.
Have Husky Rivals
If these two men meet up with their
respective rivals, Carroll and Tesreau,
somebody is sure to get a bad beating.
Both Carroll and Frentrup are sopho
moric, nervy, and dangerous. Carroll
specializes on heavy plunging labor,
while Frentrup is a bit better on run
ning just around his tacklers.
Louis Tesreau would have a con
siderable edge on Patchett., for the
Husky is following well in the foot
steps of his famous brother. Likewise
is Geehan, former understudy of
Washington's greatest quarter and
field captain, George Guttormsen,
making a good job in filling the shoes
of his noted predecessor. Spud Lewis
will probably outplay Geehan, but not
by a large margin.
Fullbacks Outstanding
The two outstanding players, for
all-around mutual discourtesy, will be
Biff Hoffman for Stanford and Captain
Wilson for Washington. Playing a
brilliant game on the line last season,
Wilson was expected to be the best
tackle on the Coast this year. When
he was shifted to full, critics claimed
he would be nailed before he had
time even to reach the line. During
the past few tilts, Wilson has ably
demonstrated that not only can he
reach the line, but with little diffi
culty, can go right on through it.
