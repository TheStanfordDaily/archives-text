# A 						University Faux-pas

### 
Authorities at the University of California at Los Angeles, according
to today's dispatches, have barred news stories of Judge Ben Lindsey's
lectures from appearing in the Daily Bruin. This action, it is said, raises
the question of whether the authorities have the power to control the
selection of news dispatches for the student paper.
We hold, and believe that practically every other college editor will
agree with us, that some sort of control is necessary over student publi
cations. But such control should not be construed to mean the suppres
sion of legitimate news stories or editorial policy even if the publication
of writings of this class are harmful to the university or college. No
student publication should be made into a "bally-hoo" organ for a par
ticular institution.
The reason given by Regent Edward Dickson for his action, which
was requested by Dr. Ernest C. Moore, director of the university, was
simply "that news of this type (Judge Lindsey's lectures) should have
no place in a student publication." James F. Wickizer, editor of the
Daily Bruin, answers that it had been his "policy to print that which is
of general interest to students." The Lindsey news most assuredly is
of interest to students and yet Regent Dickson says that such news should
have no place in the Bruin.
In our opinion the U.C.L.A. authorities were within their technical
right to exclude this news but no thinking university authorities should
ever choose to exercise the right in a case like this. The official action
will cause more unfavorable publicity to U.C.L.A. than the publication
of Lindsey news would ever cause it.
