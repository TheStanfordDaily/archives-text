# Poor Judgment
## 
### 
Writers of communications to the editors of publications, be they
city or college newspapers, often do not stop to consider how their
opinions will look when placed in type. There is a great difference be
tween writing for publication and for personal correspondence.
One of the San Francisco paper has recently been carrying corre
spondence in which writers have charged Stanford with unethical and
unsportsmanlike conduct. Such letters do a vast amount of harm simply
by their publication in the paper, even though the charges may be with
out foundation. The fault, however, lies with poor, hasty, and unpard
onable judgment on the part of the writers who should have communi
cated with Stanford authorities or with the Stanford Daily so that an
investigation in answer to the charges may be made.
