That a lake will be assured we learn from news of the introduction
of a new pipe system on the campus. This comes as good news to every
one who has ever heard of or seen Lake Lagunita. No longer will the
question, "Will there be sufficient rain to fill the lake?" harry students
who view the spring quarter as the best one of the year.
Canoeing and swimming assured every spring! As we see it, the
only objection to the lake lies in the frogs' choral efforts.
