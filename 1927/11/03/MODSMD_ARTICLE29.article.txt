FAST SERVICE, more than ever before, is the Daily's motto this
year. Two examples from yesterday's issue will make clear that the
Daily is getting the news from outside QUICKLY: Dr. Herzstein's gift
of $100,000 and the story of ticket scalpers at Washington were both
carried yesterday. Through the P.I.P. service, in addition to U.P., the
Daily today carries the story of the ban on Lindsey's news stories in the
Daily Bruin.
