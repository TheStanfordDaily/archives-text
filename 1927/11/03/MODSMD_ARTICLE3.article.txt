### 
IJ.C.L.A., Los Angeles, Nov. 3. —
(P.I.P.) —News stories dealing with
the series of lectures by Judge Ben
Lindsey on"The, Revolt of Modern
Youth" h:ive been barred from pub
lication in the California "Daily
Bruin," student publication of the
University of California at Los An
geles, as the result of action of Dr.
Ernest C. Moore, director of the uni
versity, and llegent Edward Dickson,
it was revealed here today.
Stories Barred
The "Daily Bruin" recently pub
lished a United Press dispatch con
cerning comment on modern youth
made by Judge Lindsey while lectur
ing in Portland, Oregon. When the
article came before Regent Dickson's
attention, he requested Director Moore
to see that no more news stories of
the Lindsey debates appear in the
student publication.
Dickson, one time editor of the
"Daily Californian," student publica
tion of the University of California at

I Berkeley, and present editor and
owner of the Los Angeles "Express,"
i claimed, in his request to Director
j Moore, that news of this type should
have no place in a student publica
i tion, it was learned from members of
I the Daily Bruin editorial staff.
Whether the director and a regent
iof the University have authority to
j control the selection of news dis
patches in the student newspaper is
a question which is occupying the at
tention of students interested in pub
lications here.
Wickizer Comments
James F. Wickizer, editor of the
"Daily Bruin," in commenting on the
action, said: "It has been our policy,
in regard to news dispatches pub
lished, to print that which is of gen
| oral interest to the students and the
I young people today. Lindsey's state-
I ments need no comment and we have
| not attempted to do so." Other than
the statement above, Wickizer re
fused to comment on the action.
