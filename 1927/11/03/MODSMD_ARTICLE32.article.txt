SO HARD TO BE A HERO
Speaking of traditions, it seems
they have one at Princeton —
An ancient bell in the tower of
Nassau Hall sounds the hours for
classes. Once or twice a year a fresh
man used to steal the clapper, thereby
throwing the schedule of the day into
confusion and the faculty into fits.
The theft had all the merits of a
perfect tradition: it was spectacular,
would stand repetition, and annoyed
the officials. The janitors posted
guards; and of course the bell was
silenced more often than ever.
Then the administration plotted
deep. A large supply of clappers was
bought and locked up securely. Guards
were taken off and a $30 fine auto
matically levied on the freshman class

for each replacement. One freshman,
displaying extreme ingenuity, man
aged to dispose of the whole reserve,
but with the passage of years the
tradition declined.
Now the Daily Princetonian notes
that a member of the class of '31
has scaled the belfry and made off
with the first clapper removed for
some time.
There's a lush humor in the idea.
Picture the enterprising freshman
sneaking across the campus, toiling
up the outside of the tower in the
gray dawn at risk of limb and trouser.
Success! Then a grumbling janitor
fits a new clapper from a carload in
the safe, the faculty genially leaves a
$30 fine and Tradition, though ruffled
and worn, lives on forever.
