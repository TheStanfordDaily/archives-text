' V
Like many others on the campus I
do not hold a favorable opinion of
the Daily's review of "The Lady of
the Rose" and of the editorial com
ment made.
Do you not think that it would have
been better to have ignored the play
than to print an inaccurate and dis
courteous write-up such as yours?
In support of my charge that you
were inaccurate, and I shall also say,
very superficial, I am enclosing the
review of the play by George C. War
ren, Dramatic Critic of the Chronicle.
Will you reprint it? I must say that
your editorial was the more accurate
of your two criticisms, but I do not
consider accuracy in picking flaws
and neglect of proper favorable com
ment the right thing for an open
minded editorial.
As to the discourtesy of your copy
I can only say that a very representa
tive number of people with whom I
have talked, and who read Monday's
Daily, regard your criticisms as ex
ceptionally rude.
Very truly yours,
Peter Sylvester.
P.S.: You will see from Mr. War
ren's review that, while in one or two
points your reviewer hit the mark, in
most cases U.K. took a stand directly
opposite to that of the experienced
(iean of The Chronicle's dramatic staff.

(Editor's Note: Limitations of space
forbid the reprinting of George C.
Warren's review. This has also been
Hie reason why several Campus Opin
ions have not been printed.)
