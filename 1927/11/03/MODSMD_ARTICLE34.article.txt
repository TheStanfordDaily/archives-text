The Editor, Sir :
College critics usually like to see their
words in print; they like to hear them
selves talk, but this one takes the cake.
What cheap vulgar criticism of a work
of art —that article on the "Lady of
the Rose." I do not know who "H. K."
is, but if you do, kindly tell him to at
tend to any performance or production

' that lie desires to weigh scientifically with
: his great literary genius and present in
: dissected form to the Daily readers.
As one alumnus said at the convention
the other day,"the Daily is as bad as
; ever; it makes me feel at home." Now
that need not be true, but it certainly is
| when 3,219 Stanford students have to
| read "H. K.'s" enlightening discourses
j on drama.
Now about the play. In the first place
there could not have been a more pleased
audience than the one that walked out
j of the auditorium after the performance
of the "Lady of the Rose." The play
, itself was a piece of art and the splendid
work of the actors re-enhanced its value
and beauty. At the conclusion of cach
act the audiences applauded with gr.r.t
zest. The audience did not remain in
their seats out of compliment to Miss
Price; as well known as she is on the
j campus, at least half of the audience
j merely had heard of her. Anyway, no
| matter who the director is, when peo
j pie want to walk out, they walk out. Not
| a person left the play till after the final
I curtain.
Tell "H. K." not to judge the intellect
;of the audience by his own. His blase
| type of criticism may be in vogue in the
j "root-tootue" university, but from what
j I hear, there is no reason for its exis
tence 011 the Stanford campus.
Sincerely yours,
GEORGE E. SHIBLEY.
