The Editor, Sir:
"Little Eva's Younger Brother" said
! much and implied more in his recent
letter to your paper. The fact is, that
both the "much and more" are true,
soundly true!
The food at the Union could, I am
; sure, be greatly improved upon.
Though I've had no experience in the
J line of operating restaurants, cafe
! terias, etc., I've had considerable ex
perience in eating at such places. I
think I can truthfully say that the
: Stanford Union serves the poorest
i food for the prices charged of any
place at which I've ever eaten. But for
the fact that it's very inconvenient to
he under the constant necessity of
running into Paly in order to get a
little good food, I shouldn't go to the
bother to write this protest. To eat at

one of the dining halls involves too
great an expenditure of money on the
part of one who doesn't spend one's
week-ends on the campus. Where's the
trouble? With the cook or the man
agement. Signed:
—Not An Epicure.
