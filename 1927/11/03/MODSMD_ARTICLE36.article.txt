MY ROOMMATE SAID
My freshman roommate came to me
the other day and wanted to know
how many men there were on the
campus in comparison to the Five
Hundred. "About five to one," I re
plied.
"Where are the five?" she asked.

Shudder, Mr. Shakespeare!
I study English 25,
I wish kid Shakespeare was alive.
I have to loarn his rotten verse,
By reading his my own gets worse.
Give me that guy for one short hour,
His grave daisies will start to flower!
—Ethelda, '28.
