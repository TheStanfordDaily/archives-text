# U.C. HONOR SYSTEM CALLED SUCCESS BY STUDENT COMMITTEE
## New Rules for Examinations Recommended; Student Objections Asked 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Berkeley, Nov. 2. — (P.I.P.) —Confi-
dence that the present Honor System
is being supported by the students,
and that it is the best one possible,
was expressed by the Student Honor
Spirit Committee at U.C. after inves
tigating causes for disapproval of stu
dent conduct at examinations, ad
vanced by the faculty last spring se
mester.
"It is our deep conviction that under
no system other than that now in ef
fect would there be as little dishon
esty. Nevertheless this committee
feels that a continuous and persistent
effort should be made to strengthen
and maintain the operation of the
honor system," the committee reports.
Recommendations Made
In order to make the Honor System
at U.C. even more effective than it is
at present, the committee made five
specific recommendations.
"During each and every examina
tion students will take alternate
seats ....
"Unnecessary noise and conversa
tion will not be tolerated.
"Through the men's and women's
advisory system, incoming freshmen
will be informed, personally, of their
obligations and responsibilities under
the Honor System.
"Publicity will be given the duties
and obligations of students under the
Honor System through: ~ . .the
Daily California, all student organiza
tions, various meetings of the Student
Body, and letters to freshmen.
"A more strict enforcement of pen
alties for violation of the Honor Spirit
shall be effected by the Student Af
fairs Committees. In this connection
it is to be noted that during the aca
demic year 1926-27, no student was
suspended from the University by
the action of the committees for vio
lation of the Honor Spirit in examina
tions.
Penalties Laid
During the current semester, five
men were given sentences of suspen
sion from the University by the men's
Student Affairs Committee; and two
other students were forced to with
draw from the University as a direct
result of action taken by the commit
tee.
The Student Honor Spirit Commit
tee is asking for any objections the
students may have to its findings, but
these objections must be in the hands
of the committee by Tuesday in order
to secure consideration.
