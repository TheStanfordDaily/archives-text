# GRAYS PREPARE FOR SATURDAY'S BATTLE WITH U.C. RESERVES
## 
### 
Coach Hal Davis and his Gray ag
gregation are facing a team of un- i
known strength in U.C.'s reserves who
will meet Stanford in tlie stadium as '
a curtain-raiser to the Little Dig Game |
Saturday afternoon.
Whether Ihe Bears are dangerous j
or not remains to be seen. No teams j
have been met by both California and
the Cardinals this season, but Davis
is taking no chances, and is working j
his charges as if they were preparing
for the most powerful outfit on the '
Coast.
The Grays have already demon-1
strated ther ability by beating St.
Mary's Reserves and Santa Barbara I
State Teachers' College, and unless |
unexpected injuries develop this J
strength will remain intact to wel
come the Bears.
