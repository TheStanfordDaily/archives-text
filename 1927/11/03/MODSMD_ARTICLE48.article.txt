# NEW FLUME INSURES FILLING OF LAGUNITA
## 
### 
Lagunita is sure to be filled dur
ing the spring season as work has
been started on fourteen hundred feet
of open ditch flume to bring water
from San Francisquito Creek, acco.'.l
ning to Roy H. Button, Superintendent
of Buildings and Grounds.
The new ditch replaces the section
of old wooden flume that has been the
source of much trouble for years, hav
ing been in use since the making of
the lake in Senator Stanford's time.
A steam shovel started work on the
project last Wednesday so as to insure
completion before the start of the
season.
