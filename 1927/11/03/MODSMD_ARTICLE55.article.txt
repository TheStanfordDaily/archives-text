# SEARS MAKES SURVEY OF TAMALPAIS UNION HIGH SCHOOL ACTIVITY
## 
### 
A. complete survey of all phases of
the activity of Tamalpais Union High
School is being made by Jesse B.
S'ar√ü, professor of education. The
Tamalpais school is unusual in that
it has had the same principal for the
past nineteen years who, starting it
in a tent, has built it up to a school
numbering nine hundred in its en
rollment. The principal, E. E. Wood,
has been carrying out certain experi
mental ideas of his own in the ad
ministration of the school.
The purpose of the survey, which
was requested to be made by Wood
himself, is to ascertain the degree of
efficiency of his new methods.
Professors John C. Almack, Walter
C. Eells, and William M. Proctor are
assisting Professor Sears in this
work.
A similar survey published by the
Napa Hoard of Education was made
by Professor Sears of the Napa
schools. The report found the elemen
tary schools below efficiency, and the
Hoard of Education is now following
out Professor Sears' recommendations
for bettering conditions.
