# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Harvard, having played, or attempt
ed to play, Purdue, Holy Cross, Dart
mouth, and Indiana, will now meet on
the gridiron that worthy rival Penn
sylvania, which foe has just completed
an even harder series of games with
Brown, Penn State, Chicago, and the
Navy. In the meantime, the Nassau
Tiger, which has been in the habit of
dining on Johnny Harvard at about
this time of year, tackles the power
ful Ohio State eleven, but the inter
est of the East, except for those with
i Princeton sympathies, will center on
I Franklin Field, Philadelphia.
j Let's take a look at the "Who's
j Who" among the Harvard regime, not
I overlooking Captain Charles Pratt,
j who is quite a versatile performer,
being as adept in throwing the 16-
pound shot as he is at following a
football, and Bill Bingham, the ath
letic director, who is as much a West

erner in manner as "Chuck" Carney
and "Duke" Dunne, the assistant
coaches. Bill is well remembered as
one of the greatest of all middle-dis
! tance runners a man who would have
been a record-holder but for the fact
that Ted Meredith was just a little
bit better.
Head Coach Arnold Horween is now
in the throes of his second season at
Cambridge. "Throes" is right, if you'll
pardon a pun, for Harvard teams
under "Bob" Fisher never threw half
. the forward passes that the Cantabs
of 1927 throw. Horween is a young
i man with Western ideas, who played
; good football at Harvard and gradu
, ated in 1921. The new "Haugliton
, system" lost five games in 192 C, but it
- is a safe bet that the score will be
i better at the end of the present sea
- son.
"Chuck" Carney, end coach, was one

of the Western Conference's great
athletes in 1920. His sixty baskets in
one season still stands as a Big Ten
basketball record, and at Champaign
and Urbana, Illinois, they still talk of
the way Ail-American Chuck played
in that 1919 Ohio State game. With
barely a minute left to play, and the
Buckeyes leading 7 to 6, Walquist and
Carney completed six out of seven
forward passes, advancing the ball 65
yards to the Ohio State twenty-yard
line, where Fletcher kicked the field
goal that won the game, 9'to 7.
"Duke" Dunne, who coaches the
guards, was captain of the 1922 Michi
gan team, and represented the United
States in the 1920 Olympic games at
Antwerp.

"Chuck" Carney, end coach, was one

of the Western Conference's great
athletes in 1920. His sixty baskets in
one season still stands as a Big Ten
basketball record, and at Champaign
and Urbana, Illinois, they still talk of
the way Ail-American Chuck played
in that 1919 Ohio State game. With
barely a minute left to play, and the
Buckeyes leading 7 to 6, Walquist and
Carney completed six out of seven
forward passes, advancing the ball 65
yards to the Ohio State twenty-yard
line, where Fletcher kicked the field
goal that won the game, 9'to 7.
"Duke" Dunne, who coaches the
guards, was captain of the 1922 Michi
gan team, and represented the United
States in the 1920 Olympic games at
Antwerp.


Harvard's Big Three
Harvard, having played, or attempt
ed to play, Purdue, Holy Cross, Dart
mouth, and Indiana, will now meet on
the gridiron that worthy rival Penn
sylvania, which foe has just completed
an even harder series of games with
Brown, Penn State, Chicago, and the
Navy. In the meantime, the Nassau
Tiger, which has been in the habit of
dining on Johnny Harvard at about
this time of year, tackles the power
ful Ohio State eleven, but the inter
est of the East, except for those with
i Princeton sympathies, will center on
I Franklin Field, Philadelphia.
j Let's take a look at the "Who's
j Who" among the Harvard regime, not
I overlooking Captain Charles Pratt,
j who is quite a versatile performer,
being as adept in throwing the 16-
pound shot as he is at following a
football, and Bill Bingham, the ath
letic director, who is as much a West

erner in manner as "Chuck" Carney
and "Duke" Dunne, the assistant
coaches. Bill is well remembered as
one of the greatest of all middle-dis
! tance runners a man who would have
been a record-holder but for the fact
that Ted Meredith was just a little
bit better.
Head Coach Arnold Horween is now
in the throes of his second season at
Cambridge. "Throes" is right, if you'll
pardon a pun, for Harvard teams
under "Bob" Fisher never threw half
. the forward passes that the Cantabs
of 1927 throw. Horween is a young
i man with Western ideas, who played
; good football at Harvard and gradu
, ated in 1921. The new "Haugliton
, system" lost five games in 192 C, but it
- is a safe bet that the score will be
i better at the end of the present sea
- son.
