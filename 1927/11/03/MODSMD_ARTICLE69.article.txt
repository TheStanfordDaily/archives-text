Professor Charles H. Titus, of the Po
-1 litical Science Department of the Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles, who
I was an instructor in the Citizenship De
partment here last year, has just con-
I eluded a study of voting behavior in this
! state, which shows that "slackers of the
, ballot" are increasing 32 per 1,000 of vot
ing population at every presidential
j election.
The study was conducted 011 the
] ground in twenty-two of the most rep
! resentative cities of the state, with the
j largest cities of the state listed as by far
! the worst offenders. The period from
j 1900 to 1924 is covered. The outstanding
j fact developed is that the larger the city
| the smaller the relative vote cast in pro
portion to voting population.
The study revealed a higher voting
! average in the northern cities, such as
I San Francisco, Santa Cruz, than in their
I sister cities in the south.
