# DR. BADE TO SPEAK FRIDAY EVENING ON MIZPAH EXCAVATION
## 
### 
Speaking on"The Romance of a
Buried City," Dean William Frederic
Bade of the Pacific School of Religion
will relate accounts of the excavation
of Mizpah in Palestine at a lecture to
be given at 7:30 o'clock Friday eve
ning in the Assembly Hall.
He has recently been digging in
Palestine on what is apparently the
site of ancient Mizpah, where he has
made extensive progress toward an
insight into an ancient civilization.
Dr. Bade, who has been Professor
of Old Testament Literature and
Semetic Languages in the Pacific
School of Religion since 1902, became
dean of the faculty there in 1922. He
has written "The Old Testament in
the Light of Today," and a life of
the late John Muir, whose works he
edited.
