### 
"Oregon Aggies" are no more since
Llie Oregon Agricultural College has
finally dropped the word "Agricul
tural" from its name, and is now
known simply as Oregon State Col

agitation hy the students of the north
ern institution for the past two years.

of this college are agricultural stu
j dents.
