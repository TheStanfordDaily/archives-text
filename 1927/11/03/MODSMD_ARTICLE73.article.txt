# IMPROVE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT DURING PAST MONTH
## 
### 
Improvements affecting several depart
ments and activities of the University
have been made during the past month,
among the important changes being the 1
purchase by the University, at a cost
of more than $5,000, of 1.400 chairs in
walnut finish to replace the old collapsi
ble ones heretofore used in the Pavilion
for musical concerts. Backs have also
been placed on all the permanent seats.
Hereafter, instead of using the mili
tary barracks, the ordnance offices of
the military department will be located
adjacent to the rooms where the officers
hold their classes, as the old forge and
foundry machine shop has been turned
into a suite of rooms for this purpose.
The machine shop will be set up in the
remodelled forge and foundry building.
The old high tension laboratory has
been turned into an office for Dr. Clelia
D. Mosher, women's medical adviser. â– 
Steam pipes are being installed now, 1
causing the torn-up state of Palo Alto
avenue at the Press building. Dr. Mo- j

slier is expected to move in about the j
first of January.
The old wooden flume that has carried
water to Lagunita for several decades j
and which has been the cause of many |
of the troubles that occur during the
filling of the lake, will 110 longer be
used. Instead an open ditch flume will
be made which will assure an ample
supply of water to fill the lake.
