"Discussion groups for freshman
men will soon get under way," said
Chairman George 13. Hammond last
night at the regular meeting of the
freshman Y.M.C.A.
A series of four meetings is planned
for this quarter and will be conducted
hy a number of campus leaders. No
limit has been set upon the lists of
subjects for discussion although it is
preferred that the groups adhere to
topics of campus interest, he added.
Plans for another informal Sunday
evening talk, similar to that given
last week by Dr. Bailey Willis, are
being arranged for the night of No
vember 13.
