# SOCCER TEAM MAKES THREE GOALS TO WIN FROM S.F. SEMINARY
## 
### 
In spite of playing a weak offensive
(,'ame, the Stanford soccer varsity
managed to defeat the San Francisco
Theological Seminary by a 3-0* score
yesterday afternoon on the varsity
field. Poor passing and inaccurate
kicking cut down the Stanford score,
since the forwards lost several
chances for goal.
The goals were kicked by Jakunin-
Malushin, Strowger, and Bishop. Jaku
nin-Malushin, center forward, was
the star of the game, helping on every
score by his accurate kicking and
passing. Moffitt and Fell, halfbacks,
kept the ball in enemy territory most
of the time by their defensive playing,
and backed up the forwards on of
fense.
Following is the starting lineup:
outside left, O'Donnell; inside left,
Bishop; center forward, Ward Smith;
inside Bishop; outside right,
Farewell; left half, Moffitt; center
half, Fell; right half, Jacobson; left
fullback, Holmes; right fullback, Stol
lary; and goalkeeper, Robinson.
