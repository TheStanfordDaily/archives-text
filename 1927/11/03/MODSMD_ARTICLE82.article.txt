# WILL HOUSE ANIMALS FOR RESEARCH WORK IN NEW $7500 HOME
## 
### 
Rabbits, guinea pigs and other small
animals belonging to the Anatomy De
partment of the University will have a
new residence hall, costing $7,500. Con
struction was started yesterday on the
new animal home which will be sit
uated at the rear of the museum.
The building will be a frame and
stucco structure having fifteen rooms for
the segregation of its occupants. Among
the luxurious features planned for the
building is an electrical heating system,
thermostatically controlled to maintain
an even temperature in the building at
ail times. This, it is expected, will not
only improve the health conditions of the
animals, which arc used for scientific
purposes, but will greatly reduce the ex
isting death rate resulting from pneu
monia.
