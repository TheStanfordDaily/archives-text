# FRESHMAN SQUAD WORKS HARD FOR LITTLE BIG GAME
## Speedy Practices Held This Week; Team in Good Physical Shape 
### 
With only two more practice ses
sions before the Little Big Game, the
last and most important of the season,
Coach Husky Hunt is working his
freshman football squad at top speed
to iron out all last-minute defects.
Over at Berkeley the Bear Cubs are
recovering from all ill effects of the
U.C.-Trojan clash a week ago. The
Blue and Gold outfit played high class
football against the Southerners who
are themselves a powerful aggrega
tion, and California freshman rooters
are waxing enthusiastic about chances
of a Stanford defeat Saturday.
Last Workouts Held
Here on the Farm none of the
squad, at least, is saying much about
the game one way or another. Actions,
however, are indicative of the fact
that things are happening. At no time
this season has there been such spir
ited workouts as have been in evi
dence this week.
All gaps in the line-up have been
filled, and the various combinations
have looked good in practice. Hunt's
main job n&w seems to be that of
correcting those defects in detail
which are constantly cropping out at
all times in a season.
Rest Helpful
Last week-end's rest saved the year
lings a lot of possible grief, and fur
nished what was needed most â€”the
chance to recover from injuries. The
Cardinals will trot onto the field
against U.C. in first-rate physical
shape.
