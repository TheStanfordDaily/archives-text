# PIANIST PLEASES WITH VIGOROUS TECHNIQUE
## Chopin Group Shows Artist's Brilliance, Facility of Performance 
### Hubert Gagos 
Ignaz Friedman, modest and re
served, proved himself a colossus of
piano technique by his performance
in last night's concert in the Stanford
pavilion.
"Twenty-four Variations and Fugue
on a Theme of Handel" was a suitable
number to serve as a background for
Friedman's skill. He expressed his
virile temperament by his vigorous
technique, contrasted with a delicacy
of touch seldom heard on a concert
stage.
All of his skill and profound musi
cal appreciation was demonstrated in
the Chopin group of his program.
Humor, whimsicality, piquancy, were
all brought out by Friedman's facile
fingers, weaving dreams on the piano.
"Four Studies," the last number of
the group, was the best indication of
his power to make the most of his
technique in expressing moods.
"Hark, Hark, the Lark," by Schu
bert-Liszt, and the second Viennese
Dance, by the artist, were the out
standing selections of the final group.
The performer generously gave sev
eral encores.
