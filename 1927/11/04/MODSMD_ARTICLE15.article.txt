# YOUNG McCREERY WOULD LIKE PLACE OPPOSITE BROTHER
## 
### 
Playing first-string center on the
University of Washington reserves is
a young man that would relish, more
than anyone else, a chance to line up
Saturday against Captain Hal Mc-
Creery of Stanford.
Experts who have been watching
j this ball-snapper, a transfer to
j Washington this year, say that with
out a doubt he could keep Bonamy
and Lauzon, the regular Husky cen
ters, out of the running. And next
year, when he will be eligible for
varsity competition, he promises to
keep the name of McCreery high in
the list of Coast centers, for Bob
! McCreery, of Washington, is said to
; be quite as good as his older brother,
j Hal, of Stanford.
