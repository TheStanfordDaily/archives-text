Election to honor societies should
be taken as a challenge as well as a
reward, Dean Mary Yost told San :
Jose High School students yesterday
morning when she spoke at the in
stallation of new members in the
school's honorary clubs.
Such recognition, if considered j
merely as a reward, is apt to termi
nate the usefulness of an individual,
Miss Yost pointed out. It should be !
looked upon as a c hallenge to keep up
the standards of the group and to con- J
tinue putting forth one's best efforts, j
A student who is elected to an hon- j
orary society becomes a conspicuous |
