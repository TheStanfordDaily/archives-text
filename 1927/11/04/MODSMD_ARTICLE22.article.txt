# RESERVES PLAY FIRST
## Outcome of Clash Difficult To Predict Because of Insufficient Dope 
### 
Dope may be against Stanford in
one Bear-Cardinal Clash tomorrow,
but chances for Coach Hal Davis'
Gray eleven to beat U.C.'s Reserves
at 12:30 o'clock Saturday in the sta
dium in the preliminary contest to
the Little Big Game are not even
slightly influenced by that fact.
The Stanford and the University
of California workhorse aggregations
have had different schedules all sea
son, so each will be an unknown dan
ger to the other until the whole trou
ble is settled by a victory for one.
Although they have only met two
teams this year Davis' charges have
made for themselves a reputation
which is a testimony of the quality
of their playing.
St. Mary's College reserve squad
was the first victim. The Grays, made
up of individual players who had
never worked together before, and
with only a few practice sessions in
which to develop, were unquestionably
the stronger team. They beat the
Saints easily, and missed numerous
touchdowns through flukes and tough
luck.
Then Santa Barbara State Teach
ers' College, coached by Dud DeGroot,
came north, and the Grays, minus two
leading backfield stars, May and Tay
lor, entertained the visitors and sent
them home at the small end of a 12
to 0 score.
