# SOCCER TEAM MEETS BEARS TOMORROW IN FIRST SERIES GAME
## 
### 
Playing the first of a tliree-game
series, Stanford's soccer varsity will
meet the California eleven at 12:30
o'clock tomorrow in the stadium as a
preliminary to the California-Montana
football game.
Comparative scores give the Bears
an advantage over the Cards, but this
is offset since two California men,
one of whom is said to be a star,
have been declared ineligible. The
Cardinals have a strong defense, with
fullbacks Holmes and Stollery and
goalkeeper Robinson, but a weak of
fense.
Following is the probable starting
lineup: goal, Robinson; right full
back, Stollery; left fullback. Holmes;
right liaf, Jacobson; center half, Fell;
left half, Moffitt; outside right, Fare
well; inside right, Strowger; center
forward, Jakunin-Malushin; inside
left, Silva; and outside left, O'Donnell.
The substitutes will be chosen from
Hyde, Dawson, Mayer, Frost, Gibbs,
Bishop, Birch, and Jennings.
