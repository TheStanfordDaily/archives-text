I gridiron men all season is to be set-
I tied tomorrow afternoon in the sta
dium at 2:30 o'clock when California's
horde of Bear Cubs will attempt to
prove that it is as much stronger than
l lie Cardinal babes as the dope indi
cates.
Practices recently have boen eased
j for the benefit of Hunt's charges, who
are in good shape for the impending
battle. Mentally, too, the yearlings
are set to play their smoothest brand
of football. A different spirit has per
vaded workout sessions this week,
making Stanford stock take an up
| ward turn .among those who have
watched the progress of the team this
| season.
Berkeley Picked to Win
It almost goes without saying that
! the Berkeley eleven is picked to win.
Betting odds Quoted last night make
them three-to-one favorites over the
Cards.
Mere odds and scores, however, do
1 not tell the whole story. St. Mary's
players, who had felt the power of
each machine, were not backward in
saying Stanford's freshmen were
more dangerous in the Saint's game
than the Californians were against the
same outfit a week earlier.
California beat the Trojans, a thing
I which, coming just after Stanford's
j defeat at the hands of U.S.C. as it did,
| looks serious. With the full first string
on the field Stanford looked as much
better than the southerners as did
! California. Injuries were what lost
i that contest.
Tables May Turn
So the Little Big Game may not be
the set-up anticipated across the Bay.
Husky Hunt's team has played no
game since its journey South and
may be counted upon for the greatest
fight of the season.
