# BABE SOCCER SQUAD FACES CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY TOMORROW
## 
### 
Lead by Captain Reynolds, the year
ling soccer team will play the first of
a two-game series with the U.C. fresh/-
men at 10:30 o'clock tomorrow at
Berkeley. Encouraged by their vic
tory over San Jose Junior College last
Saturday, the babes should give the
California yearlings a good battle.
With two capable fullbacks, Burns
and Dalton, the first-year men have a
strong defensive team and should be
able to keep the opposing score low.
Captain Reynolds plays a fast game
at center half, being strong on de
fense and backing up the forward line
well on offense. The scoring machine
has been strengthened by placing
Williams at center forward. With
Mujica, outside left, and Domoto, in
side left, who are both accurate at
passing and kicking, the three should
make a fast combination.
