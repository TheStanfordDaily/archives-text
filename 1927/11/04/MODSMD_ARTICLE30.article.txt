Further movement on the part of the Intercollegiate Prohibition
Association (there is such an organization) is planned with the sending
of five field secretaries to Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and
Tennessee. These secretaries will launch a campaign for student interest
in the prohibition question. Debates, conferences, surveys, and reports
will result from the activities of these secretaries.
The obvious intent of this campaign will be to firmly implant in the
mind of the student that scrupulous respect for the Eighteenth Amend
ment and the Volstead act is essential. "Student opinion," it is hoped,
will he strengthened so that violations of the liquor law will be reduced.
The whole campaign is one for the interests of all prohibition organiza
tions,
At one Eastern college the same object of reducing student drinking
is being striven for in an entirely different way. Students there have
been placed on their honor to report any cases of drinking which may
•come to their attention. The code of refusing to be a "tattle-tale'' will,
we predict, result in the breakdown of this plan. Appearances here seem
to indicate that this is merely a forerunner to some other scheme that
the college authorities have already determined upon but not yet divulged.
Here, however, are two different ways of obtaining the same object:
one through an extensive publicity campaign, the other working more
upon the individual student. Neither, we predict, will have any far
reaching results, or even results sufficient to merit extension of the
successful plan to all colleges. Solution of the liquor problem among
students cannot be reached before the similar problem throughout the
nation is solved —the student's disregard for the prohibition law is in
direct ratio to that of the nation. Colleges cannot be purged of bootleg
until the nation is thoroughly cleaned.
