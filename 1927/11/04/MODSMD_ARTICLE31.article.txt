# Signs of the Times

### 
That the University authorities are taking - an activc interest in the
traffic problem is plainly shown by the erection of new signs along the
campus highways and by-ways. Perhaps never before has the automo
bile problem been as serious on the campus as it is at the present time.
There are more machines and consequently more reckless and careless
drivers.
With this display of interest on the part of the University, it is high
time that students, both in and out of official A.S.S.U. positions, turn
their attention to some of the problems with which the University is
now trying to cope single-handed. How about noon traffic at the Post
office? Haven't you noticed that fellow in the snappy roadster who
seems to better his time each day in making an eight o'clock? Didn't
it irritate you the time that girl in the coupe almost ran you down be
cause she was powdering her nose? On the other hand, haven't you
sometimes had a wild desire to run over the fellow who purposely
tempts you to do so?
Signs alone won't be enough to solve the automobile question as
it now is. \
