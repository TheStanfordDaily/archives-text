While the varsity is up North battling for the Conference lead, two
games that won't set telegraph wires throughout the country humming
are scheduled tomorrow. Stanford's freshmen and Stanford's reserves
both climax their, seasons by meeting corresponding California teams.
Captain lleiser's team meets the Bear freshmen with the odds against
the Cardinal. Coach Davis sends his men into the contest with "dope"
in their favor. There's quite as much drama to Stanford's supporters in
these two home games as there is in the outcome of the Seattle game to
football fans through the country. Just because you didn't go to
Seattle, don't think that that's any reason why you sho'uldn't be in the
stadium tomorrow for both games.
