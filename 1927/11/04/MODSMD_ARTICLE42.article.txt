"Three impressions during my life
liave been so deeply implanted in me
that the wonder of them never
ceases," said Blanche Collet Wagner,
an American artist whose work is
being . shown to the campus in
an exhibition at the Stanford Art
Gallery.
"The fright I experienced for ten
days during the Madero bombardment
of Mexico, the awe with which I
gazed into the depths of the Grand
Canyon, and the wonder and mystery
which entered my soul on looking at
the majestic beauty of the California
redwoods, are the three lasting im
pressions."
Pictures Sequoias
Madame Wagner has succeeded ad
mirably in transforming her awe and
wonder of the California redwoods
into paint and canvas, and with the
aid of her technique and vivid color
sense, she has given the world a re
markable picture of the sequoias. She
has put in all her work the sense of
mystery and awe she feels about life.
Her color is extremely bright and
vivid almost to the point of exaggera
tion, but the subjects she deals with
are more forcibly brought out by her
glorious colors.

j A number of her pictures represent
| scenes of Guatamala. The artist lived
I in Mexico and the southern countries
for five years, and she has emulated
the warmth and color of these tropical
countries. There are a series of pic
tures showing the Fiesta of San Jose,
a yearly event in Guatemala, and it
I is interesting to trace the different
I divisions of the procession.
Some of the pictures are: Hopi In
| dians, Mysteries of the Past, Doll Rag
I of the Conqueror, Fiesta of San Jose,
1 Antiqua, Japanese Buddha, Chinese
j Buddha, and Eucalyptus Grove at Sun
i set.
Humorous Satire Shown
j Distinctly different in feeling from
j Blanche Wagner's poetic touch are
; the humorously satirical paintings by
j the talented young Japanese artist,
Noboru Foujioka, whose work re
mains on exhibition until November S.
A. B. Clark, head of the Stanford
! Art Gallery, said of the Japanese ex
hibition that the thing that impressed
him most was the definite technique
'of the artist. "The drawing is not
. stilted or strained, b.ut free. The low
toned colors are well-balanced and
| give a sense of completion that a
more realistic interpretation would
| lack."

Humorous Satire Shown

A. B. Clark, head of the Stanford
! Art Gallery, said of the Japanese ex
hibition that the thing that impressed
him most was the definite technique
'of the artist. "The drawing is not
. stilted or strained, b.ut free. The low
toned colors are well-balanced and

more realistic interpretation would

"Three impressions during my life
liave been so deeply implanted in me
that the wonder of them never
ceases," said Blanche Collet Wagner,
an American artist whose work is
being . shown to the campus in
an exhibition at the Stanford Art
Gallery.
"The fright I experienced for ten
days during the Madero bombardment
of Mexico, the awe with which I
gazed into the depths of the Grand
Canyon, and the wonder and mystery
which entered my soul on looking at
the majestic beauty of the California
redwoods, are the three lasting im
pressions."
Pictures Sequoias
Madame Wagner has succeeded ad
mirably in transforming her awe and
wonder of the California redwoods
into paint and canvas, and with the
aid of her technique and vivid color
sense, she has given the world a re
markable picture of the sequoias. She
has put in all her work the sense of
mystery and awe she feels about life.
Her color is extremely bright and
vivid almost to the point of exaggera
tion, but the subjects she deals with
are more forcibly brought out by her
glorious colors.

j A number of her pictures represent
| scenes of Guatamala. The artist lived
I in Mexico and the southern countries
for five years, and she has emulated
the warmth and color of these tropical
countries. There are a series of pic
tures showing the Fiesta of San Jose,
a yearly event in Guatemala, and it
I is interesting to trace the different
I divisions of the procession.
