# Fashions Show New Trends Skirts Longer; Herns Uneven Diagonal Neck Line Popular

### Lady Vee 
Winter fashions have established
themselves, now â€”faint rumors have
become certainties and barn-storming
fads have faded out.
Skirts, possibly because the evening
mode has so distinctly lengthened,
have slipped perceptibly lower. Even
afternoon frocks reflect the trend
both as to length and to irregularity.
As far as evening is concerned, the
straight hem line is virtually extinct.
Diagonal Neck Line
The diagonal neck line introduced
last spring has survived and modified
itself until now the evening decolet
tage has become one of the centers
of scissors' activity. Patou is using a
squared V line that is noticeably new,
featuring an asymmetrical neck line.
For daytime the handkerchief neck
line is chic and flattering. However,
when the neck line is sufficiently col
lared without a scarf, and when the
costume itself is colorful enough with
out one, the college woman will be
wise to leave it off for the day.
Pearls Being Worn
Another fetish especially peculiar
to the college woman, which requires
a halting word, is that of the long
lengths of pearls which are caught
around the throat in a double choker
and then allowed to hang their full

length in two strands down the back.
They are now to be worn in three

loops around the neck, forming three
strands of graduated lengths.
While the college maid is on the
carpet, her stand might be made more
comfortable by a word about the
leather jacket. The leather jacket,
either in half or three-quarter length,
is a featured note for the college
mode. The three-quarter variety has
given rise to a new raincoat now be
ing seen in New York which closely
resembles leather but is a rubber
fabric that does not crack or stick.
