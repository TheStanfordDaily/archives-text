# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
| Enoch Bagshaw is the Big Man in
. Pacific Northwest football. His Wash
i ington Huskies won the 1925 Pacific
; Coast Conference, and tied a great
: Nebraska team on its home field at
Lincoln. In Wilson and Tesreau,
Coach Bagshaw developed two of the
finest players ever seen on the Coast,
; and the fact that he was able to stop
! Ernie Nevers and beat one of the
' strongest Stanford teams in years
speaks well of his ability as a coach.
Out in Washington, as the saying
goes, the men are tall and straight
like the stately pines and fir trees,
[ and oarsmen and football players
j from the Northwest have long demon-
I strated the fact that it may rain a lot
| in Seattle and Puget Sound, but they
' grow kingly men out there, who reign
| in the various fields of athletics for
| long stretches at a time.
Coach Bagshaw's team faces three
hard games in a row now, following
I a brief breathing spell last Saturday,
: nnd if the Huskies can defeat Stan
; ford, Oregon, and Southern California
lin succession, it will indeed cause
j them to be ranked with the best teams
in the country. True, there is an inter
j mission of nineteen days between the
j Stanford and Oregon games, but the
I land made famous by Conibear and
j Leader will need a rest, if this year's
j Stanford-Washington game is any-
I thing like the last two. Feeling ran

I high when Nevers was knocked cold
J in 1925 ,and last year the Cardinals
got revenge to the tune of a 29 to 10
i victory over Bagshaw's Bad Boys.
First in war, first in peace, and first
in Coast Conference football, is Bag
! sliaw's motto, and he is so wrapped
up in his coaching at the Seattle in
stitution, which he himself attended
and where he played football, that
when he is through here, he will quit
the game forever. Bagshaw went to
coach at the University of Washing
ton about six years ago, after making
a fine reputation for himself as foot
ball mentor at Everett (Wash.) High
School, where in 1920 his boys won
1 the interscholastic championship.

A "Husky" Coach
| Enoch Bagshaw is the Big Man in
. Pacific Northwest football. His Wash
i ington Huskies won the 1925 Pacific
; Coast Conference, and tied a great
: Nebraska team on its home field at
Lincoln. In Wilson and Tesreau,
Coach Bagshaw developed two of the
finest players ever seen on the Coast,
; and the fact that he was able to stop
! Ernie Nevers and beat one of the
' strongest Stanford teams in years
speaks well of his ability as a coach.
Out in Washington, as the saying
goes, the men are tall and straight
like the stately pines and fir trees,
[ and oarsmen and football players
j from the Northwest have long demon-
I strated the fact that it may rain a lot
| in Seattle and Puget Sound, but they
' grow kingly men out there, who reign
| in the various fields of athletics for
| long stretches at a time.
Coach Bagshaw's team faces three
hard games in a row now, following
I a brief breathing spell last Saturday,
: nnd if the Huskies can defeat Stan
; ford, Oregon, and Southern California
lin succession, it will indeed cause
j them to be ranked with the best teams
in the country. True, there is an inter
j mission of nineteen days between the
j Stanford and Oregon games, but the
I land made famous by Conibear and
j Leader will need a rest, if this year's
j Stanford-Washington game is any-
I thing like the last two. Feeling ran

I high when Nevers was knocked cold
J in 1925 ,and last year the Cardinals
got revenge to the tune of a 29 to 10
i victory over Bagshaw's Bad Boys.
First in war, first in peace, and first
in Coast Conference football, is Bag
! sliaw's motto, and he is so wrapped
up in his coaching at the Seattle in
stitution, which he himself attended
and where he played football, that
when he is through here, he will quit
the game forever. Bagshaw went to
coach at the University of Washing
ton about six years ago, after making
a fine reputation for himself as foot
ball mentor at Everett (Wash.) High
School, where in 1920 his boys won
1 the interscholastic championship.
