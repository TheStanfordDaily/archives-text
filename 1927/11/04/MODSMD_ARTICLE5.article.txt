# HARBOARD EXPLAINS CHANCES FOR COLLEGE MEN IN RADIO
## 
### 
"We like to have men with college
background in our organization," de
clared General James G. Harboard,
president of the Radio Corporation of
America, speaking of opportunities in
his company in an interview given the
Daily yesterday at the Palace Hotel in
San Francisco.
"Of course, a good deal depends on
the man so far as promotion is con
cerned, not on whether he is or is not
a college graduate," said the General.
"But, generally, we think that a man
ought to have had a college course,
one which has been strong in physics,
chemistry, and mathematics.
Two Divisions of Organization
"There are two parts of our or
ganization: merchandising and com
munication. Each year, we put on col
lege men in the branches of interna
tional communication and broadcast
ing. These men ought to be electrical
engineering graduates. After being
put through a special training period,
acquainting them with the various
phases of our work, the men either
are found not to have interest enough
and dropped, or else And the position
for which they are best fitted.
College men are not always so in

| terested in doing work now as in
thinking about the executive position
they intend to have five years hence.
I think a more tolerant attitude on
! the part of college men would get
i them farther. Of course, the executive
positions are there; hut, they are not
there for any pre-ordained individual,
i The General, himself, is a college
man, however. He holds a B.S. and
M.S. from the Kansas State Agricul
tural College.

When asked in what manner he ex
: pected education to be affected by
J future invention and progress in radio,
! Harboard said: "Sound movies, in
| which you will reproduce a lecturer,
I with all that makes apparent person
-1 ality, will make it possible, for in
j stance, for you at Leland Stanford
: to have the best lecturer at Oxford,
1 say, without the present system of
exchanging professors. Faculty per
; sonnel will thus be reduced."
Before retiring from the army in
I 1922, Harboard was a major-general
! in the United States Army, and also
| chief of staff. He has served in the
! Philippines and acted as the chief of
j staff of the American Expeditionary
j Force during the World War.

Radio to Affect Education
When asked in what manner he ex
: pected education to be affected by
J future invention and progress in radio,
! Harboard said: "Sound movies, in
| which you will reproduce a lecturer,
I with all that makes apparent person
-1 ality, will make it possible, for in
j stance, for you at Leland Stanford
: to have the best lecturer at Oxford,
1 say, without the present system of
exchanging professors. Faculty per
; sonnel will thus be reduced."
Before retiring from the army in
I 1922, Harboard was a major-general
! in the United States Army, and also
| chief of staff. He has served in the
! Philippines and acted as the chief of
j staff of the American Expeditionary
j Force during the World War.
"We like to have men with college
background in our organization," de
clared General James G. Harboard,
president of the Radio Corporation of
America, speaking of opportunities in
his company in an interview given the
Daily yesterday at the Palace Hotel in
San Francisco.
"Of course, a good deal depends on
the man so far as promotion is con
cerned, not on whether he is or is not
a college graduate," said the General.
"But, generally, we think that a man
ought to have had a college course,
one which has been strong in physics,
chemistry, and mathematics.
Two Divisions of Organization
"There are two parts of our or
ganization: merchandising and com
munication. Each year, we put on col
lege men in the branches of interna
tional communication and broadcast
ing. These men ought to be electrical
engineering graduates. After being
put through a special training period,
acquainting them with the various
phases of our work, the men either
are found not to have interest enough
and dropped, or else And the position
for which they are best fitted.
