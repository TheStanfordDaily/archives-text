Barring a tie, tomorrow's game at
Seattle, featuring the Stanford Cardi
nals and the University of Washing
ton Huskies, will serve to relegate one
team to the conference ash-heap. Last
night the Huskies were being nomi
nated for the relegation.
Coach Bagshaw's Purple Tornado,
consisting mostly of Captain Tat Wil
son, Louis Tesreau, Chuck Carroll,
and Thurle Thornton, is little weaker
than the northern gust of last year.
Stanford is considerably less strong
than the 1926 coast championship
eleven.
Unlike the Huskies, the Redshirts
have a versatility in their attack that
means bad luck for the Washington
outfit. Warner will make his team
pass and buck and kick and run, and
unless something happens to the
Stanford defense, the Huskies are in
for a drubbing.
Latest reports show that Warner
will start Davidson, Preston, Free
man, Sellman, Robesky, Post, and
Captain McCreery in the line, with
Hoffman, Wilton, Hill, and Lewis,
backs. For Washington, Schuh and
Douglas will start at ends; Dirk and
Broz, tackles; Shaw and Huhta,
guards; Lauzon, center; Geehan,
quarter; Carroll and Tesreau, half
backs; and Captain Wilson, fullback.
