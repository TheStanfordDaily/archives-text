# DOPE UPSET AS YEARLINGS WIN FROM U.C. CUBS
## Cardinal Yearlings Trounce Bear Wonder Team by 25 to 7 Score HILLMAN, DAWSON STAR Stanford Eleven Scores in Second, Third, Fourth Periods of Game 
### Bob Speers 
California's so-called Wonder Team
number two was stopped Saturday,
and stopped with a jerk when the
downtrodden Stanford freshmen
trounced Brick Mitchell's Bear Cubs
25 to 7 in their annual Little Big
Game at the stadium.
It was an amazed crowd of fans
that witnessed the decisive Cardinal
victory, and probably a much more
amazed California football team that
watched the Redsliirts roll down the
field for four touchdowns. The visitors
had entered the contest four to one
favorites.
Hillman Valuable
Harry Hillman, recently shifted
from fullback, and playing in Moffat's
halfback position, will not soon be for
gotten by those who saw the game.
Supported by good interference and a
fast-charging line he kicked, bucked,
passed, and skirted ends. He and Daw
son carried the major part of the
Cards' attack on their shoulders.
The ball was in California's terri
tory during the entire first period.
Stanford was held on the Bear one
yard line once, and missed another
score when Hillman's pass to
Tampcke was intercepted ten yards
from California's goal.
Winnek Runs 35 Yards
A pass from llillman to Winnek,
who dashed 35 yards through a broken
field, scored Stanford's first touch
down in the second quarter. Winnek
converted for the extra point. Later
in this same quarter Hillman kicked
to Hurd who fumbled on his own 25-
yard line. Hillman recovered the oval,
and the Cards marched down the field
