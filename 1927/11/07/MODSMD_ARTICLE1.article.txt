# DOPE UPSET AS YEARLINGS WIN FROM U.C. CUBS
## Cardinal Yearlings Trounce Bear Wonder Team by 25 to 7 Score HILLMAN, DAWSON STAR Stanford Eleven Scores in Second, Third, Fourth Periods of Game 
### Bob Speers 
California's so-called Wonder Team
number two was stopped Saturday,
and stopped with a jerk when the
downtrodden Stanford freshmen
trounced Brick Mitchell's Bear Cubs
25 to 7 in their annual Little Big
Game at the stadium.
It was an amazed crowd of fans
that witnessed the decisive Cardinal
victory, and probably a much more
amazed California football team that
watched the Redsliirts roll down the
field for four touchdowns. The visitors
had entered the contest four to one
favorites.
Hillman Valuable
Harry Hillman, recently shifted
from fullback, and playing in Moffat's
halfback position, will not soon be for
gotten by those who saw the game.
Supported by good interference and a
fast-charging line he kicked, bucked,
passed, and skirted ends. He and Daw
son carried the major part of the
Cards' attack on their shoulders.
The ball was in California's terri
tory during the entire first period.
Stanford was held on the Bear one
yard line once, and missed another
score when Hillman's pass to
Tampcke was intercepted ten yards
from California's goal.
Winnek Runs 35 Yards
A pass from llillman to Winnek,
who dashed 35 yards through a broken
field, scored Stanford's first touch
down in the second quarter. Winnek
converted for the extra point. Later
in this same quarter Hillman kicked
to Hurd who fumbled on his own 25-
yard line. Hillman recovered the oval,
and the Cards marched down the field
Washington continued to outplay
Stanford in the second quarter, but a
temporary letdown gave the southern
team its first score. Tesreau, fumbling
a pass from center, was forced to
hurry his kick, which went out of
bounds on his own thirty-yard line.
Hyland, dropping back to pass,
found six Huskies rushing at him from
all angles. He threw the ball in the
general direction of San Francisco,
but Preston scooped it up and behind
perfect interference ran over the line
for a Stanford touchdown. On the try
for a convert, Hoffman's pass was in
complete.
Between the halves, Coach Bagshaw
gave his warriors a good tongue
lashing, for they came back in the
third period to drive rough-shod over
the Cardinals. With a brilliant dis
play of line bucks and passes from a
kick formation, the Huskies, starring
Tesreau, Carroll, and Captain Pat
Wilson, marched 71 yards down the
field for the touchdown and extra
point which put them in the lead.
Cards Get Breaks
Entering the fourth quarter one
point behind the Purple Tornado, the
Cardinals began to get the breaks that
finally won the game. Hoffman tried
a place kick, but the ball was caught
by the Washington quarterback on
his own ten-yard line.
Lewis, Stanford quarter, then broke
into prominence when he intercepted
a Husky pass. Two bucks brought the
ball to the 13-yard line. A penalty and
lour bucks failed by six inches to
make first down, and Washington
took the ball on its own four-yard
line.
And here came the break that fin
ished the Huskies. The Cardinals,
fighting mad after being held from a
touchdown, broke through the power
ful Washington line, blocked the kick,
and recovered the ball for the win
ning score.
"Tricky Dick" Hyland again showed
that as a safety man he is far from
through. His return from kicks and
intercepted passes, with a few passes
on his own part, gave Stanford many
much-needed yards.
Line Plays Great Game
On the line, Captain McCreery,
Freeman, Sellman, and the ends, al
though outcharged, played a great
game against the heavy Washington
machine. A large part of the Husky
attack was directed at the tackles.
When, in the final quarter, Freeman
intercepted a pass, he was so tired
that he flopped to the ground.
With all the opportunities and rea
sons and alibis in the world to offer,
the Stanford backs refused to fumble
the ball. The pigskin, slippery, heavy,
and coated with mud, offered little
trouble to the Cardinals when it came

to kicking and passing. Before a crowd
of over 42,000, the Stanford team
fought through the mist and mud with
out once muffing or fumbling the ball.

of over 42,000, the Stanford team
fought through the mist and mud with
out once muffing or fumbling the ball.

California's so-called Wonder Team
number two was stopped Saturday,
and stopped with a jerk when the
downtrodden Stanford freshmen
trounced Brick Mitchell's Bear Cubs
25 to 7 in their annual Little Big
Game at the stadium.
It was an amazed crowd of fans
that witnessed the decisive Cardinal
victory, and probably a much more
amazed California football team that
watched the Redsliirts roll down the
field for four touchdowns. The visitors
had entered the contest four to one
favorites.
Hillman Valuable
Harry Hillman, recently shifted
from fullback, and playing in Moffat's
halfback position, will not soon be for
gotten by those who saw the game.
Supported by good interference and a
fast-charging line he kicked, bucked,
passed, and skirted ends. He and Daw
son carried the major part of the
Cards' attack on their shoulders.
The ball was in California's terri
tory during the entire first period.
Stanford was held on the Bear one
yard line once, and missed another
score when Hillman's pass to
Tampcke was intercepted ten yards
from California's goal.
Winnek Runs 35 Yards
A pass from llillman to Winnek,
who dashed 35 yards through a broken
field, scored Stanford's first touch
down in the second quarter. Winnek
converted for the extra point. Later
in this same quarter Hillman kicked
to Hurd who fumbled on his own 25-
yard line. Hillman recovered the oval,
and the Cards marched down the field
Washington continued to outplay
Stanford in the second quarter, but a
temporary letdown gave the southern
team its first score. Tesreau, fumbling
a pass from center, was forced to
hurry his kick, which went out of
bounds on his own thirty-yard line.
Hyland, dropping back to pass,
found six Huskies rushing at him from
all angles. He threw the ball in the
general direction of San Francisco,
but Preston scooped it up and behind
perfect interference ran over the line
for a Stanford touchdown. On the try
for a convert, Hoffman's pass was in
complete.
Between the halves, Coach Bagshaw
gave his warriors a good tongue
lashing, for they came back in the
third period to drive rough-shod over
the Cardinals. With a brilliant dis
play of line bucks and passes from a
kick formation, the Huskies, starring
Tesreau, Carroll, and Captain Pat
Wilson, marched 71 yards down the
field for the touchdown and extra
point which put them in the lead.
Cards Get Breaks
Entering the fourth quarter one
point behind the Purple Tornado, the
Cardinals began to get the breaks that
finally won the game. Hoffman tried
a place kick, but the ball was caught
by the Washington quarterback on
his own ten-yard line.
Lewis, Stanford quarter, then broke
into prominence when he intercepted
a Husky pass. Two bucks brought the
ball to the 13-yard line. A penalty and
lour bucks failed by six inches to
make first down, and Washington
took the ball on its own four-yard
line.
And here came the break that fin
ished the Huskies. The Cardinals,
fighting mad after being held from a
touchdown, broke through the power
ful Washington line, blocked the kick,
and recovered the ball for the win
ning score.
"Tricky Dick" Hyland again showed
that as a safety man he is far from
through. His return from kicks and
intercepted passes, with a few passes
on his own part, gave Stanford many
much-needed yards.
Line Plays Great Game
On the line, Captain McCreery,
Freeman, Sellman, and the ends, al
though outcharged, played a great
game against the heavy Washington
machine. A large part of the Husky
attack was directed at the tackles.
When, in the final quarter, Freeman
intercepted a pass, he was so tired
that he flopped to the ground.
With all the opportunities and rea
sons and alibis in the world to offer,
the Stanford backs refused to fumble
the ball. The pigskin, slippery, heavy,
and coated with mud, offered little
trouble to the Cardinals when it came

to kicking and passing. Before a crowd
of over 42,000, the Stanford team
fought through the mist and mud with
out once muffing or fumbling the ball.

took the ball on its own four-yard
line.
And here came the break that fin
ished the Huskies. The Cardinals,
fighting mad after being held from a
touchdown, broke through the power
ful Washington line, blocked the kick,
and recovered the ball for the win
ning score.
"Tricky Dick" Hyland again showed
that as a safety man he is far from
through. His return from kicks and
intercepted passes, with a few passes
on his own part, gave Stanford many
much-needed yards.
Line Plays Great Game
On the line, Captain McCreery,
Freeman, Sellman, and the ends, al
though outcharged, played a great
game against the heavy Washington
machine. A large part of the Husky
attack was directed at the tackles.
When, in the final quarter, Freeman
intercepted a pass, he was so tired
that he flopped to the ground.
With all the opportunities and rea
sons and alibis in the world to offer,
the Stanford backs refused to fumble
the ball. The pigskin, slippery, heavy,
and coated with mud, offered little
trouble to the Cardinals when it came

to kicking and passing. Before a crowd
of over 42,000, the Stanford team
fought through the mist and mud with
out once muffing or fumbling the ball.

California's so-called Wonder Team
number two was stopped Saturday,
and stopped with a jerk when the
downtrodden Stanford freshmen
trounced Brick Mitchell's Bear Cubs
25 to 7 in their annual Little Big
Game at the stadium.
It was an amazed crowd of fans
that witnessed the decisive Cardinal
victory, and probably a much more
amazed California football team that
watched the Redsliirts roll down the
field for four touchdowns. The visitors
had entered the contest four to one
favorites.
Hillman Valuable
Harry Hillman, recently shifted
from fullback, and playing in Moffat's
halfback position, will not soon be for
gotten by those who saw the game.
Supported by good interference and a
fast-charging line he kicked, bucked,
passed, and skirted ends. He and Daw
son carried the major part of the
Cards' attack on their shoulders.
The ball was in California's terri
tory during the entire first period.
Stanford was held on the Bear one
yard line once, and missed another
score when Hillman's pass to
Tampcke was intercepted ten yards
from California's goal.
Winnek Runs 35 Yards
A pass from llillman to Winnek,
who dashed 35 yards through a broken
field, scored Stanford's first touch
down in the second quarter. Winnek
converted for the extra point. Later
in this same quarter Hillman kicked
to Hurd who fumbled on his own 25-
yard line. Hillman recovered the oval,
and the Cards marched down the field
Washington continued to outplay
Stanford in the second quarter, but a
temporary letdown gave the southern
team its first score. Tesreau, fumbling
a pass from center, was forced to
hurry his kick, which went out of
bounds on his own thirty-yard line.
Hyland, dropping back to pass,
found six Huskies rushing at him from
all angles. He threw the ball in the
general direction of San Francisco,
but Preston scooped it up and behind
perfect interference ran over the line
for a Stanford touchdown. On the try
for a convert, Hoffman's pass was in
complete.
Between the halves, Coach Bagshaw
gave his warriors a good tongue
lashing, for they came back in the
third period to drive rough-shod over
the Cardinals. With a brilliant dis
play of line bucks and passes from a
kick formation, the Huskies, starring
Tesreau, Carroll, and Captain Pat
Wilson, marched 71 yards down the
field for the touchdown and extra
point which put them in the lead.
Cards Get Breaks
Entering the fourth quarter one
point behind the Purple Tornado, the
Cardinals began to get the breaks that
finally won the game. Hoffman tried
a place kick, but the ball was caught
by the Washington quarterback on
his own ten-yard line.
Lewis, Stanford quarter, then broke
into prominence when he intercepted
a Husky pass. Two bucks brought the
ball to the 13-yard line. A penalty and
lour bucks failed by six inches to
make first down, and Washington
took the ball on its own four-yard
line.
