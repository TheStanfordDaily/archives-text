BOSTON, Nov. 6â€”Snow, a cold
north wind, and a shortage of food in
the isolated areas brought additional
suffering to New England tonight as
the greatest flood in her history began
receding.
Communication with most of the
Vermont cities and towns which had
been cut off since Thursday night,
when the flood started pouring down
across the state, had been re-estab
lished.
Fear for Connecticut Valley
Today fear was felt for Central and
Western Massachusetts and Connecti
cut. The crest of the flood which had
swept across Vermont and a part of
New Hampshire appeared to be head
ed for the Connecticut Valley.

I The airplane and the radio were
I brought into the fight to communicate
1 with isolated cities and to carry aid to
communities where lack of food
threatened to bring death to many
who had escaped the flood.
Martial law was in force in all the
towns along the Winooski River Val
[ ley and in many other places as a
j precaution against looting. Food was
| being dispensed at churches and
j armories.
Months to Fix Railroads
Though telephone and telegraphic
! service had been restored to most of
I the northern communities, train ser
! vice was impossible and railroad of
! ficials said it might be months before
J any semblance of regular service
could be attempted.
Electric light and power have been
1 re-established in many places, but
some cities still were working in the
i light of kerosene lamps and candles.
