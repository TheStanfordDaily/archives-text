WASHINGTON, Nov. 6.â€”"The way
J we select juries is disgraceful and so
' far as the Federal Government's pro-

I cedure is concerned, 112 intend to see
! if we can't do something about it at
j the coming session of Congress," Sen
ator George Norris of Nebraska,
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, told the United Press to
night.
He believes that as a result of the
nation-wide concern aroused by the
| charges of jury tampering in the Tea
pot Dome case, an effort at jury re
: form will receive a good deal of atten
| tion in Congress.
