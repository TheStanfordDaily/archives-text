WjTASHINGTON STADIUM, Seattle, Wash., Nov. 6. —Playing the entire con
test without a fumble, despite a wet and muddy field, Stanford defeated
the Huskies of the University of Washington here Saturday afternoon, 13 to 7,
in one of the hardest-fought games ever witnessed in the Pacific Northwest.
It was a heartrending defeat for the Washington eleven; they could have
won the game if the breaks, for which they alone were responsible, had not
gone against them. The Huskies proved themselves stronger, more dangerous,
more versatile, than any football outfit on the Coast, but the slippery field,

<§>which was supposed to be their own
| element, resulted in their undoing.
Harder Is Hero
Ted Harder, Stanford's renovated
j right end, was the hero of the con
test, being responsibly for the win
, ning touchdown on a spectacular
j blocked punt.
Washington had held the Redshirts
| for downs 011 its four-yard line in the
J last quarter, with the Stanford team
I trailing in the score. Louis Tesreau,
1 Husky half, dropped back to his goal
j post to kick out of danger.
j Harder, with the entire Stanford
J line, crashed through at Tesreau, but
| (he Cardinal end was picked to stop
the ball as it left the kicker's toe.
Then, following the pigskin as it
whirled around behind the Washing
ton goal line, Vincenti fell on it and
J scored the points needed to give a
j victory to the Cardinals.
Huskies Threaten
! Three times in the first quarter the
j Washington linesmen led their asso
-1 ciates in the backfield precariously
J near the Stanford goal line.
The first time a pass was incom
; plete on fourth down, with the ball on
! Stanford's 20-yard line. A kick drove
I back the Huskies, but once again they
| advanced into Redshirt territory.
This time they pounded their way
.to the Stanford five-yard line, when
I a fumble was scooped up by Captain
McCreery. Their third threat at the
| goal line was stopped by Hyland, who
intercepted a pass on the ten-yard
line and ran it back 27 yards.
