WjTASHINGTON STADIUM, Seattle, Wash., Nov. 6. —Playing the entire con
test without a fumble, despite a wet and muddy field, Stanford defeated
the Huskies of the University of Washington here Saturday afternoon, 13 to 7,
in one of the hardest-fought games ever witnessed in the Pacific Northwest.
It was a heartrending defeat for the Washington eleven; they could have
won the game if the breaks, for which they alone were responsible, had not
gone against them. The Huskies proved themselves stronger, more dangerous,
more versatile, than any football outfit on the Coast, but the slippery field,

<§>which was supposed to be their own
| element, resulted in their undoing.
Harder Is Hero
Ted Harder, Stanford's renovated
j right end, was the hero of the con
test, being responsibly for the win
, ning touchdown on a spectacular
j blocked punt.
Washington had held the Redshirts
| for downs 011 its four-yard line in the
J last quarter, with the Stanford team
I trailing in the score. Louis Tesreau,
1 Husky half, dropped back to his goal
j post to kick out of danger.
j Harder, with the entire Stanford
J line, crashed through at Tesreau, but
| (he Cardinal end was picked to stop
the ball as it left the kicker's toe.
Then, following the pigskin as it
whirled around behind the Washing
ton goal line, Vincenti fell on it and
J scored the points needed to give a
j victory to the Cardinals.
Huskies Threaten
! Three times in the first quarter the
j Washington linesmen led their asso
-1 ciates in the backfield precariously
J near the Stanford goal line.
The first time a pass was incom
; plete on fourth down, with the ball on
! Stanford's 20-yard line. A kick drove
I back the Huskies, but once again they
| advanced into Redshirt territory.
This time they pounded their way
.to the Stanford five-yard line, when
I a fumble was scooped up by Captain
McCreery. Their third threat at the
| goal line was stopped by Hyland, who
intercepted a pass on the ten-yard
line and ran it back 27 yards.
i for their second tally. The kick after
1 touchdown went wide.
j Stanford caught Mitchell's outfit
napping at the beginning of the last
i half. Hillman recovered the Cardinal
onsides kickoff on California's 41-
yard line. From that point, with Daw
son and Hillman alternating as ball
carriers, the Babes battered the Blue
and Gold line straight down the field.
Hillman finally took the oval across.
Winnek's try for conversion failed.
California Scores
California's lone score came during ,
the third quarter when the Bear Cubs
displayed some of the speed and
power for which they have been ac
claimed, passing and bucking for a
touchdown. The kick after touchdown
was wide, but Stanford's offsides gave
the visitors the extra point.
In the final period Stanford took
the ball on California's 45-yard line. !
A few bucks and a beautiful 35-yard
pass from Hardy to Reynolds put the
Card yearlings within scoring dis
tance, and Hillman shoved the ball
across. Saunders failed to convert. i
Husky Hunt's charges got into their !
stride Saturday, and eluded that re
lentless injury jinx which has dogged
their trail all season. They played the
type of football they had been coached i
to play, and they did it like veterans. '

WjTASHINGTON STADIUM, Seattle, Wash., Nov. 6. —Playing the entire con
test without a fumble, despite a wet and muddy field, Stanford defeated
the Huskies of the University of Washington here Saturday afternoon, 13 to 7,
in one of the hardest-fought games ever witnessed in the Pacific Northwest.
It was a heartrending defeat for the Washington eleven; they could have
won the game if the breaks, for which they alone were responsible, had not
gone against them. The Huskies proved themselves stronger, more dangerous,
more versatile, than any football outfit on the Coast, but the slippery field,

<§>which was supposed to be their own
| element, resulted in their undoing.
Harder Is Hero
Ted Harder, Stanford's renovated
j right end, was the hero of the con
test, being responsibly for the win
, ning touchdown on a spectacular
j blocked punt.
Washington had held the Redshirts
| for downs 011 its four-yard line in the
J last quarter, with the Stanford team
I trailing in the score. Louis Tesreau,
1 Husky half, dropped back to his goal
j post to kick out of danger.
j Harder, with the entire Stanford
J line, crashed through at Tesreau, but
| (he Cardinal end was picked to stop
the ball as it left the kicker's toe.
Then, following the pigskin as it
whirled around behind the Washing
ton goal line, Vincenti fell on it and
J scored the points needed to give a
j victory to the Cardinals.
Huskies Threaten
! Three times in the first quarter the
j Washington linesmen led their asso
-1 ciates in the backfield precariously
J near the Stanford goal line.
The first time a pass was incom
; plete on fourth down, with the ball on
! Stanford's 20-yard line. A kick drove
I back the Huskies, but once again they
| advanced into Redshirt territory.
This time they pounded their way
.to the Stanford five-yard line, when
I a fumble was scooped up by Captain
McCreery. Their third threat at the
| goal line was stopped by Hyland, who
intercepted a pass on the ten-yard
line and ran it back 27 yards.
i for their second tally. The kick after
1 touchdown went wide.
j Stanford caught Mitchell's outfit
napping at the beginning of the last
i half. Hillman recovered the Cardinal
onsides kickoff on California's 41-
yard line. From that point, with Daw
son and Hillman alternating as ball
carriers, the Babes battered the Blue
and Gold line straight down the field.
Hillman finally took the oval across.
Winnek's try for conversion failed.
California Scores
California's lone score came during ,
the third quarter when the Bear Cubs
displayed some of the speed and
power for which they have been ac
claimed, passing and bucking for a
touchdown. The kick after touchdown
was wide, but Stanford's offsides gave
the visitors the extra point.
In the final period Stanford took
the ball on California's 45-yard line. !
A few bucks and a beautiful 35-yard
pass from Hardy to Reynolds put the
Card yearlings within scoring dis
tance, and Hillman shoved the ball
across. Saunders failed to convert. i
Husky Hunt's charges got into their !
stride Saturday, and eluded that re
lentless injury jinx which has dogged
their trail all season. They played the
type of football they had been coached i
to play, and they did it like veterans. '
