# STANFORD FRESHMAN, VARSITY SOCCER MEN LOSE TO CALIFORNIA
## Overconfidence Causes Babe Defeat; Regulars Lack Scoring Machine 
### 
California teams scored two soccer
! victories over Stanford Saturday, de
! feating the freshmen 2-1, and the var
i sity 3-0, the last contest being played
!in the Berkeley stadium as a pre
! liminary to the California-Montana
j football game. The varsity was beaten
by superior teamwork, but the year
| ling defeat can be partly charged to
: overconfidence.
The varsity game was a repetition
I of the story of a strong defense and
j no offense. The two fullbacks, Holmes
and Stollery, and goalkeeper, Robin
son, played a strong defensive game,
but could not be expected to keep
California from scoring.
Lack Teamwork
Fell, center half, and Jakunin-Malu
sliin, center forward, were the stars
| on offensive, both passing accurately.
I All of the men played hard, fast ball
j hut they lacked teamwork. Jacobson,
j right half, received a cut on his head
I and was taken out, which weakened
I the team.
Stiff workouts will be held every
! evening with the purpose of getting
J the men to work together, said Coach
j Harry Maloney after the game. If the
! Cards can develop a scoring machine
| they will have a good chance to win
the last two contests, which will be
at Stanford.
The Babes, who were beaten by an
inferior team, lost because they
played a slow, listless game. Wil
liams, center forward, scored a goal
in the first five minutes of play, tak
ing the ball from the center of the
field to the goal by himself. This lone
! tally gave the yearlings so much con
; fidence that they slowed down for the
rest of the game. California scored
twice in the last half, winning the
I first of the two-game series.
I Dalton and Burns, fullbacks, played
I heady ball during the whole game
: saving several scores by timely kick
j ing. Williams, center forward, was the
| star on the offensive.
