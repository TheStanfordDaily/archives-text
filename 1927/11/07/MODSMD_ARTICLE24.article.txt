# Worrying the Colleges
## 
### 
If Judge Lindsey has done nothing else on his tour of the Coast, he
has at least caused many college officials a great deal of worry. In
practically every metropolitan paper appear headlines to the effect that
the "Insertnameof College Authorities Ban Lindsey Article (or De
bate)."
College authorities do not like to worry about incidents of this sort.
When some of their students, who may be a little more ambitious than
the rest of the herd, make an effort to learn something about Lindsey's
theories, it is often disturbing to the calm serenity of scholastic life.
Deans, presidents, and other officials scratch their heads to think of rea
sons why Liudsey's writings and views should not be discussed 011 the
Insertnameof platform or in the student publications. These reasons,
of course, must not sound too silly, and this fact makes it very hard for
the college authorities. The reasons officially stated are not the real
reasons.
Colleges have a notorious fear of unfavorable publicity. It is
because of the belief that Lindsey discussions will bring such publicity
that they "ban" the little judge's views. Another reason for this colle
giate "ban" lies in the fact that some authorities really believe that "col
lege students just shouldn't be concerned with these things."
How much more weight an official statement of the reasons for
barring material of this sort would carry if the authorities making the
statement were sincere and frank!
