# Speed Up the Swing
## 
### 
Abbe Ernest Dimnet, in his lecture last week, advised the world to
"wait for the swinging of the pendulum." The inference seems to be
that nothing we can do will speed up the world's progress—time alone
will take care of that. Wait long enough for something and it will turn
up—like the spotted horse on the merry-go-round—is what his advice
amounts to.
If we had followed that idea, the twentieth century wouldn't have the
list of achievements to its credit which it now has. Enterprise of indi
viduals is what stimulates world progress—not apathy. Apathy is a
dry-rot which is fatal when it creeps into the structure of society. Let's
inveigh against it, and stamp it out, and not wait for the swinging of
the pendulum. llow about even tampering with the works and using
some technical knowledge to speed up the pendulum's swing?
