"Aw, hell," says the dapper but bored collegian as he flips the
ashes from a cigarette, "I'm going to a regular school next year. Noth
ing ever happens here.''
In a vacant room on the second floor a youth is poring over a book.
The book is pretty hard reading he finds; it would be hard for any one
who had never heard or seen a word of English until a year ago. Far
away, in a little village near Odessa, his brother is reading Pushkin.
It is four days before the big game. Yes, it is a big game. Of
course, it will not burn up the Associated Press wires and Grantland
Rice will never hear of it. But, nevertheless, the men who are preparing
for it can think only of victory. It is yelling that makes throats husky,
and there is only one kind of fighting spirit.
In the library, a couple are trying to make a date, the watchful eye
of the librarian being the only deterrent. The young man is filled with
hope. He is thinking of the last row of the movie house, the dim lights,
and the soft, soothing music. She, too, is hopeful and is not adverse to
the cinema palace. But she also has a dim memory of a little white house
with green shutters that she once saw while passing through a small
town in New York State.
The son of the laborer adjusts the microscope. Never before has he
seen an amoeba, much less heard of one. lie decides that the night he
and the fellows sneaked out to see the burlesque show was not quite the
ultimate in human experience, and fortunes in copper and oil vanish—at
least for the moment.
The collegian slicks back his hair with his hand; he adjusts his
necktie and is all set for a large evening at the Palais de Terpsichore.
"Nope, nothing ever happens here."—Detroit Collegian.
