THEY HELD ONTO THE BALL
The varsity beat Washington at
its own game, that is to say, the
Cards handled the slippery ball
better than did the Huskies, the
line refused to be slowed down by
the mud, and Hoffman outpunted
Tesreau, who was touted as a sec
ond Dink Templeton in getting off
long ones. Stanford's reverses and
end runs may not have worked so
well and the Washington defeat
may have been due to a "dumb
play," but we won the game and
we're quite ready to take credit
for so doing.
It is almost an intellectual thrill to
watch Pop Warner's teams play when
the game is at a crisis. The Old Fox
shifts his position on the bench, lights
a cigarette and sends a substitute in
with instructions for a play which is |
designed to put the contest on ice
and usually does. One likes to think ;
that Davidson, when he was substi-!
tuted for Harder in the second quar- i
tor, carried word for Hyland to make I
the pass to Treston which resulted in j
Ihe first touchdown. Whether the play
was Warner's idea or Spud Lewis', it
was strategic and was described by
the raving radio announcer as beauti-}
fully executed.
ATTENTION NUMEROLOGISTS
If Alma Mater does nothing else
for her children she will at least
not send them into the world with
the superstitition that thirteen is
an unlucky number. Stanford has
won too many football games by
that sum of points to allow such
a canard to remain in the mind.
Two years ago it was 13-9 against
U.S.C., last year 13-12, this year
13-13 (the Trojans got wise to the
value of this score), and now
comes the 13-7 Washington defeat, j
Soon perhaps games will cease to
seem important unless the score
board shows S 13 sometime during
the final quarter.
Dick Hyland displayed great form i
Saturday and was described as look
ing "like a work of art on the field."
He is, however, somewhat more ani
mate. One is glad to see him flashing
again because be is a spectacular
player and will be needed in the Big
Game. Moreover, he is partially vindi- j
eating himself for the College Humor j
•article which U.S.C. and the Los An-!
geles "Times" et al took exception to
and which probably made many fans j
sputter and refer to Stanford men as
snooty upstarts.
