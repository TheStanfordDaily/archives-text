The Editor, Sir:
"Criticism of Criticism of Criti
cism" —I hope my quotation of Mr.
Mencken will be forgiven, but this
letter is now overdue. Isn't it about
time that all this criticism of Miss
H.K. of the Daily staff ceased? The
first letter differing with her views
was sufficient, and perhaps justifi
able, but it seems that quite a num
ber have decided to join the panning
chorus, giving to the casual reader of
the Daily nothing less than the im
pression that a super-performance of
a very real and fine drama has been
unjustly criticized by one of "them
college intellectuals." Perhaps the
language of some of our boys would
have been kinder had they known the
young lady whose article called forth
such a howl of rage. Personally I
have a high opinion of her intelli
gence, indeed enhanced at the read
ing of her criticism of "The Lady of
the Rose." This play was an extreme
ly poor play—but was held up and
saved by excellent individual acting.
Does anyone really honestly think oth
erwise?
As we can have no comic sheet in
the Daily, isn't it just great that we
have "Campus Opinion"?
