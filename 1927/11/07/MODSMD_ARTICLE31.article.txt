! tion ones, people who are unable to
j report in the afternoon may try out
i for the first time in the evening.
No definite decision has yet been
1 made concerning the choice of a play,
j but two comedies, "The Butter and
! Egg Man" and "Expressing Willie,"
| are under consideration. Uncertainty
|as to securing the rights of produc
tion has delayed the selection. Both
' plays give opportunities for well-bal
anced casts, and the uncertainty as to
the choice will not materially affect
the first tryouts.
All sophomore women are eligible
for tryouts for this play, including
' sophomore transfers. The length of
residence in the University will not
debar new sophomore women from
! appearing.
