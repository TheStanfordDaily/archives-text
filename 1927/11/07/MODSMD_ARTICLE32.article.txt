# RESEARCH IN SCIENCE IS INDISPENSABLE TO INDUSTRY SAYS SWAIN

"Research in pure science is indis
pensable to the industrial progress of
any nation," said Professor Robert E.
Swain of the Department of Chem
istry at Stanford, in his address Fri
day night before a joint meeting of
the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers and the Italy-America So
ciety at the Engineers' Club in San
Francisco, held to commemorate the
contributions to science of Alessandro
Volta, eminent Italian scientist, who
died a century ago.
Professor Swain cited the case of
a recent development in Germany of
a way in which hydrogen and carbon
monoxide are converted into wood al
cohol through an inexpensive and
simple process. "The production of
this compound at approximately one
third of the cost of production in this
country threatened the future of the
entire wood distillation industry in
the United States, representing an in
vestment of $150,000,000," he said.
American research answered this chal
lenge by the development of its own
process at a still lower cost of pro
duction.
Other speakers on the program were
j Professor Charles L. Cory of the Uni
' versity of California, who spoke on
' "Volta, the Scientist," and Sylvester
Andriano, a San Francisco attorney,
who gave a talk on "Volta, the Man."
