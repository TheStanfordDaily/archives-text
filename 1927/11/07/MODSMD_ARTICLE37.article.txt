# H'S IN FOOTBALL
## 
### Feg Murray 
Where would the game of football |
be without its "H's"? You'd have to j
take the very backbone out of grid
iron history if you stripped it of its
great K-players, H-coaelies, and H
institutions. The game of American
intercollegiate football is, as you
know, an outgrowth of English Rugby.
I imagine a lot of Britishers came
over here 011 the Mayflower and
started dropping H's around, and j
these all grew up into goal posts, and
then the great players whose names
begin with the eighth letter of the
alphabet were all born and raised in |

the shadow of these huge wooden H's. [
Colleges and universities such as
Harvard, Holy Cross, Hamilton, Has-!
kell Institute, Haverford, Heidelberg, j
Hobart, and Howard have contributed
many great H-men to gridiron history,'
but it is from the whole length and j
breadth of the land that this H'All I
H'American team has been chosen.
