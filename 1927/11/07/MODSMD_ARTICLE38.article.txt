# Dr. Bade Declares Hill Of Seven Cities Site Of Ancient Mizpah
## 
### 
Tell en-Nasbeh, the hill of seven
cities, has been identified as the site
of the ancient Mizpah of Benjamin by
Dr. William Frederick Bade, who told
of his archaeological investigations in
Palestine at an illustrated lecture Fri
day night in the Assembly Hall. Dr.
Bade is professor of Old Testament
Literature and Semitic Languages at
the Pacific School of Religion, and is
an archaeologist of note.
Mizpah, supposed to have flourished
around ISOO 8.C., and long an object
of search, was located seven miles
north of Jerusalem. Here, beneath the
rocky surface of a promontory used
by a group of Arabs to raise crops,
were discovered the massive ruins of
a city built between the stone and
early bronze ages.

Getting his cue from an airplane
picture of the hill which revealed the
contours of the walled-in city through
the covering layer of earth, Dr. Bade
chose this spot for his excavations,
and after half an hour of digging
struck one of the walls. Further work
revealed the remains of an entire city
of the pre-Canaanite period, with huge
outer walls, houses, tombs, cisterns for
storing grain (some of these latter
with false bottoms to deceive the an
cicnt prototype of an income-tax col
lector), and many forms of pottery,
affording valuable ceramic evidence.
One jar handle was stamped "Miz
pah," further identifying the city.
Further excavation showed this hill
to have been the site of seven cities,
superimposed upon each other, as was
the ancient custom. Pottery was

j found to identify the different periods
! of time, some of it dating as far back
as 2GOO to 3000 years B.C. Remains
! of pottery native to Greece and Rome
indicated commercial relations with
| these countries at an early time.
Mutton Stew Found
Among Dr. Bade's finds were the
I remains of a mutton stew, abandoned
on a primitive hearth, presumably
when the owners were forced to flee
before an invasion; the clay head of
a bobbed-haired goddess; and evidence
in images of the worship of a Queen
of Heaven. Valuable bronze vases j
were found, and some jars of great j
size. Most of this will be removed i
to the Pacific School of Religion.
Under his contract, Dr. Bade was ■
required to cover over the ruins with j
earth as soon as he had finished his
investigations, in order that the Arab ;
farmers might continue to raise crops
i upon their customary fields.

earth as soon as he had finished his
investigations, in order that the Arab ;
farmers might continue to raise crops
i upon their customary fields.
Tell en-Nasbeh, the hill of seven
cities, has been identified as the site
of the ancient Mizpah of Benjamin by
Dr. William Frederick Bade, who told
of his archaeological investigations in
Palestine at an illustrated lecture Fri
day night in the Assembly Hall. Dr.
Bade is professor of Old Testament
Literature and Semitic Languages at
the Pacific School of Religion, and is
an archaeologist of note.
Mizpah, supposed to have flourished
around ISOO 8.C., and long an object
of search, was located seven miles
north of Jerusalem. Here, beneath the
rocky surface of a promontory used
by a group of Arabs to raise crops,
were discovered the massive ruins of
a city built between the stone and
early bronze ages.
Photograph Gives Cue
Getting his cue from an airplane
picture of the hill which revealed the
contours of the walled-in city through
the covering layer of earth, Dr. Bade
chose this spot for his excavations,
and after half an hour of digging
struck one of the walls. Further work
revealed the remains of an entire city
of the pre-Canaanite period, with huge
outer walls, houses, tombs, cisterns for
storing grain (some of these latter
with false bottoms to deceive the an
cicnt prototype of an income-tax col
lector), and many forms of pottery,
affording valuable ceramic evidence.
One jar handle was stamped "Miz
pah," further identifying the city.
Further excavation showed this hill
to have been the site of seven cities,
superimposed upon each other, as was
the ancient custom. Pottery was

j found to identify the different periods
! of time, some of it dating as far back
as 2GOO to 3000 years B.C. Remains
! of pottery native to Greece and Rome
indicated commercial relations with
| these countries at an early time.
Mutton Stew Found
Among Dr. Bade's finds were the
I remains of a mutton stew, abandoned
on a primitive hearth, presumably
when the owners were forced to flee
before an invasion; the clay head of
a bobbed-haired goddess; and evidence
in images of the worship of a Queen
of Heaven. Valuable bronze vases j
were found, and some jars of great j
size. Most of this will be removed i
to the Pacific School of Religion.
Under his contract, Dr. Bade was ■
required to cover over the ruins with j
earth as soon as he had finished his
investigations, in order that the Arab ;
farmers might continue to raise crops
i upon their customary fields.
