# LAST-MINUTE PASS GIVES BEAR ELEVEN 6-6 TIE WITH GRAYS
## McCone, May Feature Contest By Spectacular Work; Cohen Scores 
### 
Completing a pass over the goal line
in the final minute of play, the Cali
fornia Reserves cheated the Stanford
Grays of victory by tieing the score
G-G in Saturday's contest, which was
played in the stadium as a preliminary
to the Little Big Game.
The playing of McCone and May
featured the contest. McCone came
through with his usual spectacular
defensive work, and in addition
proved that as a ball-carrier he has
plenty of ability. His kicking, too, was
beautiful. May was in the game only
for a little more than a quarter, but
while there he made several spectacu
lar dashes.
Coach Davis started practically a
full second eleven, and the first period
was played near the center of the
field.
In the second quarter with the regu
lars in, Stanford missed a touchdown
by one foot after Groenewegen re
covered a Bear fumble on California's
25-yard line. Later in the period the
Cards scored after completing two
passes which took the ball from the
visitors' 40-yard line to the goal.
Cohen bucked the oval across. In this
same quarter California missed a score
after a brilliant aerial attack when
the man receiving the ball stepped
over the end zone.
Slow playing made the third quar
ter uninteresting. The ball hovered
about midfleld and in Stanford terri
tory most of the time. California again
threatened to score by the air route
but lost the ball before any damage
could be done.
The Bears' pass over Stanford's
goal in the final minute of play
spoiled chances for a Cardinal vic
tory. California's attempt at conver
sion failed.
