# FOUJIOKA PRAISED BY EASTERN ART CRITICS
## 
### 
Noburo Foujioka, tlie talented
young Japanese artist, whose work is
on exhibition in the Stanford Art Gal
lery until Wednesday, is regarded by
many lovers of art in New York as
one of the most promising artists of
the present day.
His canvasses combine good tech
nical drawing with a keen insight into
human nature. As a result his work
presents humorously satirical pictures
of life. His pictures of New York life
are particularly interesting.
The exhibition will be shown in San
Francisco at the Palace of the Legion
of Honor after it leaves Stanford.
