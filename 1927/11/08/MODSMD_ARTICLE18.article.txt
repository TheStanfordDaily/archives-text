## FROM UNITED PRESS FIRE, DISEASE COME IN WAKE OF FLOODS 
### 
BOSTON, Nov. 7. â€”Fire and disease
added their hazards to those of snow,
sleet, and cold in the wake of the
New England flood tonight.
With thousands of basement fur
naces flooded and refugees depending
on improvised stoves and wood flres
for warmth, military men and volun
teers on duty in the stricken areas
were taking elaborate precautions
against fires.
Relief workers, handicapped by
snow and bitter cold, already have
been balked in their efforts by bad
fires in two Vermont towns.
General Preston Brown, Comman
der of the First Corps Area, returned
to Boston late today by airplane from
an aerial survey of the devastated
sections.
"The problem," General Brown
said, "is largely an administrative
one. However, I have conferred with
Red Cross and local relief officers
and I believe they are well organized
and have a definite plan.
"The amount, of damage cannot be
estimated accurately at this time but
it is sure to run into many millions.
