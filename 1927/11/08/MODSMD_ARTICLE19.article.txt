# Russians Celebrate Tenth Anniversary Of Bolshevist Rule
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Nov. 7. â€”A singing,
shrieking mob of a million men, wo
men and children surged through the
red-bannered streets of Moscow to
day in celebration of the tenth anni
versary of Bolshevism.
From the freezing Siberian steppes
and the Ukraine, the shores of the
Black Sea and the fringe of the Arctic
Circle, they came to participate in the
greatest Soviet demonstration since
November 7, 1917, when the Bolshe
viks captured Petrograd and over
threw the provisional government of
Alexander Kerensky.
It was a characteristic Russian So
viet display. All the theatrics in the
Russian flair for the dramatic were
exhibited. Emotions were given free
rein.
Intermingled with this, however,
were the stern economics of the So
viet. Some sections of the mammoth
parade wore veritable forests of fig
ures, statistics, graphs, and diagrams
comparing economic conditions before
the Soviets became the Government,

and today.
"Long live Soviet," Mikhail I.
Kalinin, president of the central execu
tive committee of the Soviet union,
shouted into the microphone atop
Lenin's Mausoleum.
"Hurrah," replied a million men,
women, and children in a prolonged
cheer. Ten minytes of cannonading
followed the tremendous "hurrah,"
shaking the square and filling it with
smoke.
