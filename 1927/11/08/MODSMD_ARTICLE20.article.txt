NEW YORK. Nov. 7.—Freezing
ocean gales swept in upon New York
today with pent-up winter fury as
three storm-tossed liners made port
| with stories of a heavy tempest rac
: ing at sea.
Still battling against mountainous
waves were eleven vessels bound for
New York. They all will be from 14
' to 3G hours late —a marine record for
seasonable November disturbances.
The thermometer dropped to 31 de-
I grees at 4 p.m. Temperatures in the
ocean gale area were believed to be
j even lower.
