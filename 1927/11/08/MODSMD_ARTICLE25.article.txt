# CARDINAL GRID TEAM RETURNS FROM SEATTLE
## Only One Stanford Player Is Injured After Game With Washington SANTA CLARA TILT NEXT Coach Adam Walsh Is Noted Exponent of Rockne Shift System 
### 
Over three hundred enthusiastic
Stanford men and women gath
ered at the Southern Pacific depot
last night to give to a victorious
Cardinal varsity the greatest
spontaneous welcome accorded a
returning team. Because of late
leave given to the entire women's
student body, the team was wel
comed by a larger crowd of wo
men than ever attended such a
rally before.

Captain Hal McCreery and his Stan
ford varsity football team returned to
the campus at 11 o'clock last night
from Seattle, where they demon
strated that, with a break or two, a
Redshirt eleven can break through
oven the greatest team in the Pacific
Northwest, Washington's Purple Tor
nado.
Only one man, Chris Freeman, was
injured at all, and his wrenched leg
will not even keep him out of scrim
mage. Hard labor for the varsity, how
ever, will be cut to the minimum,
since the second team is scheduled
to do most of the work against Santa
Clara next Saturday.
Broncs No Set-Up
Coach Adam Walsh's Br or. cos will
be no set-up for the Cardinals. Sunday
they were holding the Olympic Club
to a scoreless tie until a fumble late
in the game gave the clubmen a start
toward a touchdown. And although
there are numerous excuses available,
one must remember that the Olympics
held Stanford to a 7-G victory.
Walsh, center on the Notre Dame
team with its famous Four Horse
men backfield, will give Stanford its
fifth dose of Knute Rockne football.
The Santa Clara coach, with the ex
ception of "Slip" Madigan of St.
Mary's, is the outstanding exponent
of the Notre Dame shift in the West,
and has given his teams a good foun
dation in this style of play.
Shifts Weakened
Although all shifts are spectacular,
and sometimes amusing, they have
lost their innovation and their force.
The direction of the shift always
gives away the direction of the play.
The practice the Cardinals have had
against shifts during the first of the
season, together with the one-second
stop rule, will give Santa Clara a
great deal of trouble in hop-skipping
their way through the Stanford line.

ever, will be cut to the minimum,
since the second team is scheduled
to do most of the work against Santa
Clara next Saturday.
Broncs No Set-Up
Coach Adam Walsh's Br or. cos will
be no set-up for the Cardinals. Sunday
they were holding the Olympic Club
to a scoreless tie until a fumble late
in the game gave the clubmen a start
toward a touchdown. And although
there are numerous excuses available,
one must remember that the Olympics
held Stanford to a 7-G victory.
Walsh, center on the Notre Dame
team with its famous Four Horse
men backfield, will give Stanford its
fifth dose of Knute Rockne football.
The Santa Clara coach, with the ex
ception of "Slip" Madigan of St.
Mary's, is the outstanding exponent
of the Notre Dame shift in the West,
and has given his teams a good foun
dation in this style of play.
Shifts Weakened
Although all shifts are spectacular,
and sometimes amusing, they have
lost their innovation and their force.
The direction of the shift always
gives away the direction of the play.
The practice the Cardinals have had
against shifts during the first of the
season, together with the one-second
stop rule, will give Santa Clara a
great deal of trouble in hop-skipping
their way through the Stanford line.
