# Modernity's Decalogue

### 
A parody is sometimes a valuable thing. From an exchange we learn
that "a group of women college students met somewhere in Michigan and,
having nothing else to do, formulated a new version of the ten command
ments." Following is their valuable contribution to life and letters:
"1. Thou shalt not drink anything which makes thee say 'yes' when
meaning 'no.' 2. Thou shalt kiss no man more than twice in an evening.
3. Thou shalt scatter thy dances and smiles alike, instead of giving to one
man only. 4. Thou shalt be punctual for class, dance, and motor ride.
5. Thou shalt not discuss chapel sermons with thy professors. 6. Thou
shalt not smoke the boy friend's cigarettes. 7. Thou shalt dress so as to
make them bet about thy frock. 8. Thou shalt wear only one man's frater
nity pin at a time. 9. Thou shalt finish the night's study in the library
before stepping out in the moonlight. 10. Thou shalt repay thy partner
one compliment for every one he payeth thee."
What good will come of such twaddle being printed in college papers
is hard to predict. From the tone of the introduction we gather that time
hung heavy on the hands of the women who drew up this parody on the
ten commandments and that they did not expect anyone to take them seri
ously. No one willâ€”they can rest assured of that.
