# SPONSORS TO RETAIN POSITIONS AS ENCINA COMMITTEE ADVISORS
## 
### 
With Clark Cypher, head sponsor,
in charge, the house committee of
Encina Hall held its first meeting last
night in Room 216 at Encina, to dis
cuss plans for the year. Cypher stated
that the sponsors plan to retain their
positions as advisors while the house
committee takes charge of any neces
sary discipline in the hall.
He declared that in the past the
house committee had proved to be a
failure, but that if the 1931 commit
tee could manage the disciplinary
matters in a successful manner it
really would have accomplished some
thing for the class.
All offenders will be requested to
report at the next committee meeting
Monday night at 10 o'clock when in
dividual cases will be tried.
