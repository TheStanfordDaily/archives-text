Since it is a foregone assumption that university officials must assume
several of the parental duties in order properly to handle the college
youths entrusted to them, it is only wise that the universities should go
for advice to the parents of the students. Recently the president of the
University of Oklahoma sent out a form letter to the parents of the stu
dents asking their opinions on what should be done in the case of several
rules pertaining to social affairs and automobiles.
This system, if used in moderation, should be a worthwhile means for
developing more interest on the part of the parents in the problems of
university officials. Such officials often complain that parents show too
great an interest in their affairs, but after all the students belong more to
their parents than they do to the university.
