# The 						Truly Great
## 
### 
President Burgstahler of Cornell College, Mount Vernon, lowa, re
cently committed a great injustice to the advertising managers of the vari
ous student publications. He placed a ban on the advertising of tobacco
and cigarettes in the college publications because, he said, such advertise
ments were not compatible with the college ruling against the use of to
bacco in any form.
Any student advertising manager who can sell space to tobacco com
panies when his college will not permit the use of the filthy weed cer
tainly deserves to receive congratulations instead of edicts. President
Burgstahler cannot recognize true greatness when he sees it.
