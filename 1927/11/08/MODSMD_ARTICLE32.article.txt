# Tell the "Y"
## 
### 
The annual effort of the Y.M.C.A. to secure voluntary contributions
from the parents of freshman students will he made shortly. In letters
to the new freshmen the Y.M.C.A. will tell its intention to send circulars
and more letters to the parents of the freshmen.
If, "for any reason," a freshman desires that his parents do not
receive the Y.M.C.A. letter he is requested to inform the "Y" of this fact.
