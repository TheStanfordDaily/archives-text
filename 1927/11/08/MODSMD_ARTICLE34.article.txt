# AND Then Our Little SALLY

I really think that older men are
ho thoughtful. They are always trying
to protect the younger people from
shocks, and from new ideas. I mean
they keep them from reading about
the future and the awful things that
may happen then.
But I do believe that they are a bit
unfair to some of the men who are
trying to help the young boys and
girls to lead better lives. I mean the
judge is so little and helpless look
ing that I don't see how he could
harm any one. Of course if I had any
troubles I wouldn't go to him, be

cause T don't want them put in a
book. No thank you.
I guess those who say his solution
won't work must have tried it to find
out, they seem to know so much
about it. But they do say that, it would
all he very legal. So 1 don't understand
why there is so much worry about
college people, and the future, because
iwe always try to avoid legalities,
j They bring so much trouble you know.
