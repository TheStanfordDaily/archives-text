SEVERAL YEARS TOO LATE
If reports from University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles are not more
than usually exaggerated a pair of
officials down there are particularly
foolish. It appears that at the request
of a regent the head of the school arbi
trarily forbade the student newspaper
to print any news articles about the
Lindsey debates.
That the official action, if correctly
reported, was stupid and will be futile
goes without saying. The marvel is
that Los Angeles go-getters would at
tempt direct censorship, a weapon
that always has been a boomerang.
If they want to lteep the collegiates
innocent of ideas there are better
ways than gagging the press. They
might make Lindsey-ism a five-hour
course for three units credit. Or pro
hibit the students from thinking of
Lindsey in parties of less than six!
Taken at their very worst the Den
ver judge's proposals are pretty tame.
He is so old-fashionedly in favor of
marriage that he wants to make it
work better by adapting the legal
form to observed fact, and he has un
dergone considerable real persecution
for his faith.
He does advocate supervised dis
semination of birth control knowledge,
but that whole subject is by this time
almost pass 6 to the youth concerned.

Further, the judge would modernize
the law so that a childless couple who
for their own reasons have ceased to
be happy together may separate with
out the debasing hypocrisy of the
archaic accusations and trial. Bui
none of the judge's suggestions would
seem to have much power to soil by
mere contact the minds of college stu
dents who are commonly of the social
class among whom divorce carries a
minimum of social stigma.
We are watching the institution of
marriage in transition. It may some
time be recognized that while indi
vidually it may be as much a sacra
ment as the participants please, so
cially and legally it is a contract. Re
form movements are growing in re
spectability and it is not beyond rea
son to anticipate that newer ideals
as typified by Liiulsey may become
law.
Whether "companionate marriage"
is the next step or something like it,
the occasion calls for interested, lively
discussion, a measure of tolerance, and
recognition of the fact that the world
does move.
Students at U.C.L.A. will get good
practice in citizenship while enjoying
the fun of getting out from under the
stimulating ukase. The two misguided
university officials are to be pitied.
