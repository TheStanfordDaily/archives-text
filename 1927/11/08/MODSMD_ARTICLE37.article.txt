"The Land of the Pilgrims' Pride," by
George Jean Nathan. Alfred A.
Knopf, New York, 1927.
In this book of essays on the "con
temporary scene" in that land, which
was once the land in which they
would not now have any pride at all
should they be made to live again,
Nathan has written abundantly and
with great good humor. He has ob
served and noted everything that an
inhabitant of these United States
might do, think, or feel, in this most
modern era; and he has been prolific
in expressing these actions, thoughts,
and emotions; being sure always, how
ever, to tinge them with the color of
his own perspective.
Virtue, morality in the colleges,
negro literature, Ayers' Almanac, cen
sorship. sandwiches in New Orleans
and Chicago, roast beef in New York,
jazz and opera, the American critic,
democracy: these are only a few of
the themes on which Nathan becomes
eloquent.
Quoting college papers "from Har
vard on the East to Leland Stanford
on the West," the author finds "symp
toms of the changed attitude of Amer
ican young men toward young women,
and vice versa." By inserting in his
text "a few recent sample pleasan
tries from various undergraduate col
lege humorous journals," he attempts
to prove his statement,
Censorship, Nathan finds, has a
tendency to improve literary America.
Writers "in the field of lovely letters"
are now compelled to use their imagi
nations and by various, devious ways
to avoid a suppression of their work.
After telling the reader, among
other things, that there are C3l shops

in San Francisco and 2312 in Chicago
which specialize in sandwiches, he
writes: "Today, there are no less than
1546 different recorded kinds of sand
wiches." Then for two pages, he does
nothing but enumerate a few of these
various kinds.
Nathan says of American critics,
among which he, himself, is one, that
they question a writer's motives, when
they are incapable of making adequate
answer to his argument, because of
the latter's "indubitable integrity."
When Sinclair Lewis refused the Pul
itzer prize for his novel "Arrowsmith,"
Nathan says that these inane critics
could see only that Lewis wanted free
publicity, whereas to such an excep
tionally capable critic as Nathan him
self, this was quite obviously errone
ous.
"The failure of democracy is of a
piece with the failure of marriage
since the emancipation of women.
Where there is the theory of equality
among persons living under the same
roof or under the same flag there can
be no sound and workable organisa
tion." In such definite terms does the
author dismiss democracy. "Men may
follow, but they do not and never will
lay down their lives, their intelli
gence, and their derisory humor for
a fellow citizen from a cow state in
a Stein-Block three-piece suit, an Ar
row collar and a Dunlap derby hat."
These are only a few of the pleasant
bits of humor and of sarcasm that
may be found in this, series of disser
tations on, let's say, this, that, and the
other thing. A trite phrase, but it will
do. The book is one which might be
picked up in any odd moment and
read with pleasure.

1546 different recorded kinds of sand
wiches." Then for two pages, he does
nothing but enumerate a few of these
various kinds.
Nathan says of American critics,
among which he, himself, is one, that
they question a writer's motives, when
they are incapable of making adequate
answer to his argument, because of
the latter's "indubitable integrity."
When Sinclair Lewis refused the Pul
itzer prize for his novel "Arrowsmith,"
Nathan says that these inane critics
could see only that Lewis wanted free
publicity, whereas to such an excep
tionally capable critic as Nathan him
self, this was quite obviously errone
ous.
"The failure of democracy is of a
piece with the failure of marriage
since the emancipation of women.
Where there is the theory of equality
among persons living under the same
roof or under the same flag there can
be no sound and workable organisa
tion." In such definite terms does the
author dismiss democracy. "Men may
follow, but they do not and never will
lay down their lives, their intelli
gence, and their derisory humor for
a fellow citizen from a cow state in
a Stein-Block three-piece suit, an Ar
row collar and a Dunlap derby hat."
These are only a few of the pleasant
bits of humor and of sarcasm that
may be found in this, series of disser
tations on, let's say, this, that, and the
other thing. A trite phrase, but it will
do. The book is one which might be
picked up in any odd moment and
read with pleasure.

"The Land of the Pilgrims' Pride," by
George Jean Nathan. Alfred A.
Knopf, New York, 1927.
In this book of essays on the "con
temporary scene" in that land, which
was once the land in which they
would not now have any pride at all
should they be made to live again,
Nathan has written abundantly and
with great good humor. He has ob
served and noted everything that an
inhabitant of these United States
might do, think, or feel, in this most
modern era; and he has been prolific
in expressing these actions, thoughts,
and emotions; being sure always, how
ever, to tinge them with the color of
his own perspective.
Virtue, morality in the colleges,
negro literature, Ayers' Almanac, cen
sorship. sandwiches in New Orleans
and Chicago, roast beef in New York,
jazz and opera, the American critic,
democracy: these are only a few of
the themes on which Nathan becomes
eloquent.
Quoting college papers "from Har
vard on the East to Leland Stanford
on the West," the author finds "symp
toms of the changed attitude of Amer
ican young men toward young women,
and vice versa." By inserting in his
text "a few recent sample pleasan
tries from various undergraduate col
lege humorous journals," he attempts
to prove his statement,
Censorship, Nathan finds, has a
tendency to improve literary America.
Writers "in the field of lovely letters"
are now compelled to use their imagi
nations and by various, devious ways
to avoid a suppression of their work.
After telling the reader, among
other things, that there are C3l shops

in San Francisco and 2312 in Chicago
which specialize in sandwiches, he
writes: "Today, there are no less than
1546 different recorded kinds of sand
wiches." Then for two pages, he does
