Question: Why is not a bell run di
rectly upon the hour in the library to
warn the students so that they get
to their next classes on time?
Answer by George T. Clark, Direc
tor of the Library:
We believe that it would not help
as many students as it would hinder.
The ringing of a bell upon the hour
would most certainly disrupt those
students who have no class to attend.
The University has also placed large
clocks in all of the reading rooms.
Question: When and how are the
men that worked as ushers in the
U.S.C. football game going to be paid?
Answered by the Accounting De
partment:
Payments are made twice monthly.
Owing to a large payroll and frequent
mistakes in addresses and names,
checks cannot ha mailed exactly on
the first of the month. However, the
work is in progress at present.
Question: Why were students
charged $1.00 admission at the Ore
gon game? Why were they not noti
fied ahead of time?
Answer by J. C. Irwin, manager of
(he ticket department of the Board of
Athletic Control:
The answer to the first query can
be found in the "Bull Session" column
in last Wednesday's Daily. The ticket
department does not announce the
prices ahead of time unless reserved
seats are on sale in advance.
