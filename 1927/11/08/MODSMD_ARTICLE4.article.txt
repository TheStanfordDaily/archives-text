Turning off the state highway, Dietz

both cars onto the tracks. The trolley
car, travelling at a high rate of speed,
was unable to stop and crashed into
both automobiles. The Studebaker,
which Dietz was driving, was struck
against a telephone pole sixty-five
feet distant. The truck was knocked
for a distance of 132 feet down the
