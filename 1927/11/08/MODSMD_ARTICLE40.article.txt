During a recent interview, Profes
sor B. H. Lehman of the English de
purtment of the English department
of the University of California and
Director of Research in Modern Lan
guages at the same institution, and
the author of two popular novels,
"Wild Marriage" and"The Lordly
Ones," was questioned concerning
the manner in which lie thought a
novel should be constructed, the man
ner in which he, himself, produced
fiction.
"Before I ever think of putting a
character into the setting of a novel,
I have in mind one of a certain indi
viduality, in fact, one which becomes
an obsession with me. Then, when I
sit down to write, 1 cease to think of
the drives, which are of the very
cssence of character, and become con
cerned only that my people shall act
naturally. However, both before and
after 1 have written, 1 always think
of these drives. Character can be ex
pressed only by motive revealed
through action, by drives, in short.
It is the novelist's business to pre
sent character by exploring and ex
hibiting motive expressed in action.
Balance Necessary
' One thing that is very necessary,
one which I feel that I have to some
extent achieved in niv last book, is
the envelopment of all that is the
novel in a sort of mood, the giving to
it of a sort of aura.
"In the creation of a novel, per
spectives and balances must be main
tained among the various characters

and their actions, in order that pro
portion may not be destroyed.
"Sometimes after I have written for
a time, I 'go away and let the tank
get full,' as Mark Twain would say.
Incidentally, I would much rather talk
for two hours than write for an equal
time.
"After a novel has been completed,
I don't see how a man can revise and
make any great change in the manu
script proof. In my first novel, "Wild
Marriage," I changed only a single
word.
Sincerity Important
"The artist's sincerity is most im
portant in the creation of a work of
fiction. It must not be perverted or
altered for ulterior purposes. Sincerity
means humility. Willa Cather and
Theodore Dreiser have achieved this.
By the way, I consider Dreiser the
foremost modern writer of fiction;
he is not merely a creator of charac
ter, but of people. His Clyde Griffith
in his "American Tragedy" is a real
person, whereas, for example, the
Babbitt of Sinclair Lewis is only a
type, one in whom the externals, the
superficial paraphernalia of our civili
zation is apparent.
"Above all else, I believe that a
writer of fiction should be fertile. He
should write a novel, at least, every
two years. I have ideas for a half
dozen novels now, but I have not the
time to write them. For a professor,
such as myself, sabbatical leave,
which may be granted every third
year, is a great boon."
