## 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â€”The Tea
pot Dome jury tampering charges now
being investigated by a Grand Jury
may be brought into court sooner than
expected because of a demand by
Edward J. Kidwell, the juror accused
of talking too much, that he be given
a chance in open court to deny the
affidavits against him which caused
a mistrial to be declared last week.

Another sensational turn was pre
dicted by William J. Burns, who dis
closed affidavits intimating that the
Government had been shadowing one
of the jurors. One of the Burns detec
tives trailed an automobile whose oc
cupant was said to have talked with
Norman L. Glasscock, one of the
jurors, at Potomac flying field. A sec
ond affidavit identified the car as be
longing to H .R. Lamb, a special as
sistant to the Attorney General who
has been handling anti-trust cases
involving oil companies.
