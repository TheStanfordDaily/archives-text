# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
As the Football Rules Committee
said, in a resolution passed in 1925
soon after Walter Camp's death,
"American Football has lost its great
champion, but his influence on the
game will endure as long as the game
is played." Walter Camp's tireless ef
forts as a coach, critic, author, selec
tor of "All America" teams, and as
the guiding genius who safeguarded
the good name of football and kept

pace with its evolution until his
death, are all well known, but perhaps
his abilities as a player have been
more or less forgotten. Let me quote
from "Big Bill" Edwards' book, "Foot
ball Days." Edwards quotes F. It. Ver
non, who played on the Yale team with
Camp:
"Camp was always alert, and seemed
to sense developments before they
occurred. One of my chief recollec
tions of Camp's play was his great
confidence with the ball. In his room,
on the campus, in the gym, wherever
he was, if possible, he would have a [
football with him. He seemed to know !
I
every inch of its surface, and it j
seemed almost as if the ball knew him. I
It would stick to his palm, like iron
to a magnet.
"In one of his plays, Camp would j
run down the side of the field, the ball \
held far out with one arm, while the :
other arm Avas performing yeoman
service in warding off the oncoming
tacklers. Frequently he would pass the !
ball from one hand to the other, while i
still running, depending upon which j

i arm he would need for defense. Smil-
I ingly and confidently, Camp would run
i the gauntlet of opposing players for
many consecutive gains. I do not re-
I call one instance in which he lost the
! ball through these tactics."
