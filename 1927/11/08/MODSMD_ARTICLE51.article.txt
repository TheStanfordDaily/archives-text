# ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN GERMANY FLOURISH AVERS WELTON CROOK
## Professor Tours Europe to Investigate Industries Upon Continent 
### 
"A tremendous amount of trading
and manufacturing is being done to
day in Germany," says Professor Wel
ton J. Crook of the Mining and Metal
lurgy Department, who has just re
turned from a four months' tour of
continental Europe where he in
spected the large steel plants and
made an investigation of industrial
conditions.
"The war seems to have left no
marked economic effects on Ger
many," he says."The country is
densely populated, there is no unem
ployment, and all of the industrial
plants are very busy. The Rhine and
Elbe rivers, and the harbor at Ham
burg are crowded with shipping.
France Unfilled
"There is not much unemployment
in France though a good deal of soil
is left unfilled. Sweden is having a
hard time, and Austria is in miserable
shape. In Vienna beggars enter the
restaurants during meal times and
cannot be ejected for fear of starting
a communistic riot," Professor Crook
relates.
He also reports that in Germany a
great number of French and Belgian
soldiers still patrol the west bank of
the Rhine where "the French have
taken over all the large buildings to
use as garrisons, and where they fly
their flag from all the windows."
Regiments Dirty
These regiments are extremely dirty
and ill-kept and are apparently the
poorer part of the French army. Many
of the troops are entirely composed
of colored or Oriental soldiers.
German policemen are compelled to
salute all officers and under-oi'fieers
of these occupation armies, according
to Professor Crook who says that
"these conditions are proving very
trying to the patience of the German
people."
