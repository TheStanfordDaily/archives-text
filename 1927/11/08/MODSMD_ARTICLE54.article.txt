# PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY OF AUDITORY IMAGERY CONDUCTED BY YOUNG
## 
### 
Auditory imagery, or the apprecia- |
lion of sound values in silent reading, j
is impossible without the accompani- i
ment of the corresponding tongue
movements, according to Clarence W. ;
Young, psychology research student
who this summer completed a study
of the functions of inner speech in
reading and thought.
. To prove this theory he required
his subjects, .Stanford students, to
hold their tongues so tightly between i
their teeth that any movement was
impossible, then to think the word ,
"ashes" and the sentence, "She sells j
sea shells beside the seashore." The
subjects confessed that they failed to j
gets the "s" sound in their auditory
images.
Since auditory imagery plays such
an important part in the appreciation
of poetry Young believed that there
was more tongue movement in the j
silent reading of poetry than in that
of prose, where, as a rule, meaning ]
alone is necessary. By the means of i
a delicate membrane instrument, the '
tongue tombour, which, when placed
above the tongue, measures its move
ments, Young showed that this was
true with many of his subjects, usu- \
ally those whose poetic appreciation
was the keenest.
Hardly any inner speech is neces
sary for meaning to register, accord-!
ing to Young; only a little is essen
tial for the appreciation of rhythm, {
but more is required for poetry. Many
of Young's subjects had never before
realized that the tongue played any
part in silent reading and thinking.
