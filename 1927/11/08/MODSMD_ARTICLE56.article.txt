THE LITTLE WONDER TEAM
We should all line up by the
Law Steps this morning and give
way to a hearty laugh at "Brick"
Morse's little wonder team of Cali
fornia, 1931. The sorrel-topped
sporting authority of the upper
bay region cracked into print a
week ago after the Berkeley babes
had trounced the Trojan fledg
lings by a round sum of points the
while the Bear varsity, which had
been in Morse's eyes up until that
time a team of destiny, was being
castigated by U.S.C., with the
modest statement that the Little
Bears were, in a brief word, a
wonder team in the making. But
it is followers of the team who
have been in a fog of wonder
since the Stanford freshmen won
the victory last Saturday, despite
the short odds Mr. Morse con
ceded them before the game.
Even the Daily Californian, al
though not a yellow journal as
college publications go, neverthe
less used tha following modest
headline last Friday on its story
of the Little Big Game of the next
day: ''Stanford Frosh Will Give
Bear Babes Workout."
Well, of course a drowning man will
grasp even at a straw, and frantic
student bodies hoping for a winning
team are not much more reasonable.
The foregoing is not to imply, how
ever, that the Blue and Gold varsity
is composed of men of straw. Anyone
who saw California trim St. Mary's
and the Olympic Club would be con
strained to think otherwise, regard
loss of the fact that the Bears fell
before Morley Drury and U.S.C. It
seemed as if California was impotent
in that battle and a little off form.
Stanford is proven; California may be
expected to rise to its greatest heights
next Saturday against Washington.

And then the Big Game.
STATUS OF FOOTBALL
F. Scott Fitzgerald, writing in
College Humor this month on
"Princeton," says that football,
bfick in the nineties, "became the
most intense and dramatic spec
tacle since the Olympic games."
This is true; for next to war, foot
ball is the most combative sort of
business youth commonly indulges
in. The game expresses "the eter
nal violence of American life," as
Fitzgerald has aptly said.
