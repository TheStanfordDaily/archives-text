### 
"We need the co-operation of every
member of the freshman class to make
the construction of the bonfire a suc
cess," said Tom Pike, chairman of the
Freshman Rally Committee, at a meet
ing of the class at Encina Hall last
night. Bob Fraser also spoke, empha
sizing the fact that the yearlings will
be judged by the quality of the pyre
not only by the student body but by
(he many spectators from off the cam
pus.
With the arrival of a third box-car
full of lumber, work started in earnest
yesterday. Guard duty by the fresh
men will begin tonight and a rigid
watch will be kept until the pile is
lighted on Wednesday night, Novem
ber 16, after the Big Game rally.
Students have been combing the
surrounding country for available lum
ber, and sufficient material is at. hand,
according to the committee. The re
mains of last Sunday's fire at Lytton
and High streets will yield a good sup
ply of wood for the structure, declares
Fire Chief William Clemo of Palo
Alto.
