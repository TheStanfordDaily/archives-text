# ANNA MAY PRICE IS NAMED DIRECTOR OF "BIG GAME GAIETIES"
## 
### 
General direction of acts for the
"Big Game Gaieties," Ram's Head
show given on the night preceding
the Big Game, will be by Anna May
Price, it was announced last night.
This will be the first football show
directed entirely by the dramatics
coach, although Gordon Davis as
sisted in the direction last year.
As a departure from past perfor
mances a revue having no central
plot will be given instead of the
usual musical comedy. The show will
also be considerably shorter than pre
vious "Gaieties," emphasis being laid
on skits.
Musical direction will be by Theo
dore Duncan, and dances will be
supervised by Frances Boone. All
musical numbers will be original com
positions of campus people.
Norman Larson, dramatic manager,
requests that all faculty members
make applications for seats immedi
ately. In view of the fact that alumni
have been mailed applications it is
expected that there will be a pressing
demand for tickets.
