# BUTTLES TALKS ON DISSONANCE TREND IN MUSIC
## Tone Combination Discussed, Minor Second Popular With Composers CLASSIC FORMS RETURN Ravel, Scriabine, French Six, Strawinsky Leaders of Modern School 
### 
"Musical history is the acceptance
of one dissonance after another by
Hie ear as pleasing," said Professor
Bruce C. Buttles in his discussion at
the Assembly Hall last night of the
trends in contemporary music. He
gave the first tone combinations to be
used as octaves, followed by fifths,
which were at first considered dis
sonant, and on down to the shortest
possible piano interval, the minor
second.
"Quarter tone intervals will come
next " Buttles said, "and are even now
in use abroad. The Hindus and Chi
nese and Japanese have known and
used these intervals for centuries,"
lie added. "Polytonality, or composi
tion in two or more keys at the same
lime, is another contemporary mode
in general use illustrated in the works
of Ravel and Ilonegger.
Contrasts Ravel, Debussy
Tn contrasting Ravel with the older
Debussy, Buttles pointed out the re
cent turn from introspective treat
ment, disregarding form conventions,
to the tendency shown in the work
of the Frenrh Six, who are finding
their material in everyday .life, from
locomotives to American jazz. Cou
pled with this is a marked return to
regular form in composition, and in
melodic treatment.
"Scriabine is another of the mod
erns who writes in a slightly different
vein, putting into his music the at
mosphere of mysticism characteristic
of his own nature. He uses Debussy's
whole tone scale, adding to it the
minor second so popular at present.
Strawinsky, on the other hand, now
considered one of the greatest influ
ences in modern music particularly
in the use of dissonances, wrote ob
jectively." ,

Buttles gave examples of character

tions from the composers he dis
cussed, and from records of their
music. Ravel's "Le Valse," which was
recorded by the second largest orches
tra ever used; Honegger's "Pacific
