## FROM UNITED PRESS INDIFFERENT POLLING IN ELEVEN STATES IS MARKED BY VIOLENCE 
### 
Contests between dozens of candi
dates in eleven states throughout the
nation went to the vote counters
j Tuesday night at the end of a politi
! cally dull but physically violent off-
I year election day.
Only a suggestion of a national is
j sue came out of the variegated con
! tests. That was in Mississippi's guber
natorial election. Thomas Bilpo, in
' an open fight with the Ku Klux Klan
over his refusal to pledge an anti-
Smith delegation to the next Demo
cratic convention, may indicate south
ern sentiment toward Tammany's
choice for president by the number
of voters who stayed away from the
! polls.
Kentucky Race Fights
Kentucky had a gubernatorial elec
tion as a Republican and Democratic
candidate swamped the state with pro
i and con propaganda on horse racing.
With the prestige of the Anti-Saloon
I League at stake, Ohio's electorate
'found election day marked by bomb
] ing assaults and other forms of vio
: lence. Special guards were placed at
some of the voting places.
Pennsylvania's interest in local is
sues over the state centered in the

contests of independent candidates
opposing the Mellon organization in
Pittsburgh and Vare's machine in
Philadelphia.
Prohibition Question Arises
New Jersey voted on a big road
issue and seven state senators.
The prohibition issue dominated
Michigan. Detroit, which was voted
wot once before, chose between John
N. Smith, wet, and John C. Lodge,
dry, for mayor.
Arrests were plentiful from the
time the polls opened in New York
City with complaints of voters against
alleged intimidation by political
workers, pouring into a nonpartisan
headquarters.
Democratic gains or losses in the
New York state assembly will indi
cate the trend of A1 Smith's strength
in his own state.
