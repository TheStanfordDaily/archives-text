### 
MOSCOW, Nov. 8. â€”The sorrowing
figure of Leon Trotsky, until a year
ago one of the outstanding men in
Soviet Russia, has been forgotten by
the millions who are celebrating the
tenth anniversary of t lie Soviet
I Regime.
Today Trotsky and Kameneff, an
-1 other idol who has fallon before Jo
| seph V. Stalin, general secretary of

the central committee and one of the
biggest powers in Russia, motored
around Moscow as 1,000,000 men, wo
men, and children paraded in the
great demonstration which centered
in Red Square.
Here and there they addressed
small crowds, but the people who
once hung on every word Trotsky and
Kamenoff spoke, shouted at them,
"Away, away; we have heard enough
from you."
