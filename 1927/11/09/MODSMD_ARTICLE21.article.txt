# MME. WAGNER WILL VISIT STANFORD ART GALLERY TOMORROW
## Paintings Exhibited by Artist Made During Travels in Spain, Porto Rico 
### 
Blanche Collet Wagner, whose
paintings are now on exhibition in
the Stanford Art Gallery, will be on
the campus tomorrow afternoon from
2 to 5 o'clock to meet the students
and faculty who are interested in art.
She will hold an informal reception
in the room in the Art Gallery where
her pictures are being exhibited.
Members of Delta Epsilon, national
art fraternity, will attend the recep
tion.
Her paintings will remain on ex
hibition until Monday, November 14.
These include her California, Oriental
still life and flower pictures, and
paintings of subjects in Spain, Guate
mala, and Porto Rico which she made
during her travels in these countries.
Mme. Wagner is French by birth
and American by adoption. She is a
pupil of Clinton Peters, New York
portrait painter, a student of the Pa
risian painter, H. Gazan, and of Al
phonse Grosse of Seville, whom critics
place well to the front in modern
Spanish art.
Mme. Wagner's range is from in
tense bright warm colors to deep dark
shadow colors, which gives the feel
ing of richness characteristic of most
of her canvases.
