# MANY INJURIES WILL HANDICAP BRONCO VARSITY
## Santa Clara Quarter, Full, Mold Down Places on Hospital Squad COMMINGS IS THREAT Three Backfield Men Still Dangerous to Stanford In Game Saturday 
### 
There is a mighty pood clxance that
the Stanford varsity will face a badly
bruised and battered bunch of Bron
cos in the stadium here Saturday. The
Olympic Club team, which took a one
touchdown victory over the Santa
Clarans last Sunday, did a little bit
of everything to the poor boys.
Coach Adam Walsh, sitting on the
bench, saw his Rockne plays shot all
over the place, and his backfield men
banged in practically the same local
ity. One by one his ball-carriers were
carried off the field, until only two
halves and a fullback remained.
Charles Fa!k, who plays end and only
end, had to be drafted in to call sig
nals.
Tiie three backfield men that do re
main, however, are the dangerous trio
of the team. Bud Cummings, diminu
tive captain and halfback; "Frenchy"
Terremere, massive full; and Guido,
Walsh's ace kicker, have been able
to escape serious injury.
On the hospital squad are Ilaskin
son, regular quarter; Barsi, another
big fullback, who has also played
against Stanford basketball teams;
and half a dozen halfs, including
Hassler, McCormick, Miller, Regan,
and Fawley.
