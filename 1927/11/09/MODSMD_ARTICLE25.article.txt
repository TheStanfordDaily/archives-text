# EX COMMITTEE GIVES BLOCK "S" BLANKET AWARD TO PHIL NEER
## 
### 
Phil Noer, Stanford tennis captain
in 1922 and since that time winner of
a number of coast titles ,was granted
a Block "S" blanket last night by the
Ex Committee as a third award in
varsity tennis. He played on the net
team in 1920, 1921, and 1922.
Through some oversight the blanket
was not granted in 1922 when Neer
first became eligible for it, and the
matter was not brought up again
until discovered in the records at the
gym this year.
