# Award Managers—When?
## 
### 
The attention of the By-laws Revision Committee will he centered on
the question of managerial awards at the meeting tonight. It is understood,
of course, that whatever this committee decides upon is subject to the
approval of the Executive Committee, or, in event of a petition, to the
approval of a student body election.
Whether managers of sports should receive their awards before or
after the season during which they are managers sums up the question.
General Manager A1 Masters, it seems, favors awarding of the sweaters
after the close of the season because this system would insure greater
efficiency and dependability in turning in reports for the Board of Athletic
Control. On the other hand, last year, when the present system of giving
the awards before the season was installed, it was pointed out that the
awarding of the sweaters at the beginning of the season gives the man
ager a certain badge of authority necessary for dealing with officials and
men on other teams.
The whole question is a delicate one—any matter pertaining to sweater
awards is so. The sentiment and personal satisfaction in wearing a block
letter are generally left in the background when awards are discussed.
Should a man who has not yet fulfilled the requirements for an award
(i.e., the managerial duties) be permitted to wear his sweater before his
task is finished? Is the award the object of his labor or the experience
coming from an office of this sort? How about the track and tennis man
agers who would not receive their awards until the end of the year?
These and kindred questions are ones that will make it hard for the
Executive and for the By-laws Committees to determine upon a plan
satisfactory to the managers and the Board of x\thletic Control. Un
doubtedly the plan chosen should be of such a nature that it will make
for the greatest efficiency possible in the managerial system. Some think
that the present scheme of making the awards before the season's work
has been completed makes for inefficiency because the managers, it is said,
consider their object achieved as soon as they have their awards.
One suggestion might be that during the season the managers wear a
distinguishing sweater somewhat similar to that of the junior managers.
Such a plan would facilitate the varsity managers' work on the field or
track in dealing with participants and officials. The bar block "S" sweater
could then be awarded after the season when the sweaters for the team
under this manager are given out.
