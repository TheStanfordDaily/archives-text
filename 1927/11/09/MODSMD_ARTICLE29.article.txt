The passing of the old-time college serenading is a matter of common
knowledge. Some have attributed its disappearance to prohibition, others
say it was merely a characteristic of college during the "rah-rah" days.
It remained for the University of Oregon to give spontaneous serenading
the last push over the brink for that campus. The student council there
recently passed a resolution providing that all serenades in the future be
scheduled with the Dean of Men and the Chief of Police. The serenades
must be scheduled at least three days in advance.
