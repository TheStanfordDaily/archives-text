# U.S. VETERANS PUBLISH MAGAZINE AT HOSPITAL
## 
### 
Patients and personnel of the U.S.
Veterans Hospital at Palo Alto write,
type-set by hand, and print a ten
page magazine, "The Live Oak," semi
monthly. The publication has a circu
lation of 400, and is sold at $2 a yearly
subscription.
The men working on the magazine
are in the occupation therapy depart
ment of the hospital. Two to five
hours a day are devoted to this work.
The magazino had its beginning as a
mimeographed paper, but within the
last year it has been enlarged and
printed in magazino form.
