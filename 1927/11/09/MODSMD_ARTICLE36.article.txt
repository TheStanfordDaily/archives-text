The Editor, Sir:
In front of Stanford Union, though
The day be done, the darkness low,
We always see a curious sight—
The fountain splashing through the
night.
From dawn to dusk the plaza lies
Unfountained 'neath the burning
skies;
Rut when the night falls on the square
We find the fountain playing there!
O waters musical and sweet!
O fountain —beauty ineffete!
As soon as winter comes again
They'll turn you on despite the rain!
—MARSHALL KIRBY
