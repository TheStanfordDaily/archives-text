The Editor, Sir:
We were much disappointed to find
no comment in the Daily on the ser
mon of the Sacramento Bishop. Evi
dently the members of the staff are
all Anglo-Saxons who were ardently
delighted to hear that theirs is the
"glorious race," or perhaps they were
asleep when the Bishop proclaimed
that Ihe Declaration of Independence
was the brain-child of the Episcopal
church. Evidently the Bishop doesn't
agree with the college authorities that
"students should not be concerned"
with Judge Lindsey's ideas, since he
presented them to the five hundred
in flowery metaphor which he unfor
tunately got "fruitily" mixed.
(Signed): A Lily and a Peach.
