The Lady of the Rose.
(apologies ,Mr. Tennyson. I'm bor
rowing the "swing" of ShulloLt).
In the columns, thinly veil'd
Slopped with heavy humor, trail'd
By poison words that failed,
The articles come in like hail
Beating in upon the Daily.
But who doth know the campus woes
As all this hubbub loudly grows
For she is stabbed, and her life blood
flows,
The Lady of the Rose.

MY ROOMMATE SAID
The other day my roommate said
that she'd rather take a bad man and
try to make him good than take a
good man and try to make him inter
esting. —Lil' Hellin', '28.

The Editor. Sir:
When my roommate read Roble
1930's "My Roommate Said" he swore
by The Great Blue Eyes of the Per
fect. Blonde that he'd meet this Frosh
gal who wanted to know where the
five men were. I have to keep him
locked in the room—he may do some
thing rash! —Toyon 1930.

Visitor: "Can you tell me where the
Memorial Church is?"
Very, very clever Frosh: "I didn't
know it was missing."
