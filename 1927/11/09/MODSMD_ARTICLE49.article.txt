# JUNIORS NOW IN TIE WITH FRESHMEN FOR CLASS GRIDIRON TITLE
## 
### 
With the juniors and freshmen tied
for the lead in the interclass football
competition, their game having ended
in a tie, the championship depends
upon the outcome of the junior-sopho
more and the senior freshman battles
to be held at 9 o'clock next Saturday
morning.
The juniors hold a slight edge, hav
ing defeated the seniors. The fresh
men won over the sophomores, who
in turn were cleaned by the seniors.
However, the yearlings have proved
the scrappiest and most unexpected
team of the lot and may win over the
seniors in their game. If the juniors
take a victory over the sophomores,
tlie situation will still be a tie for the
championship; only by the sopho
mores beating the seniors can the
freshmen win the Interclass.
Many injuries featured the junior
freshman game last Saturday and will
keep several men out of the games
this week. Allan Kenward, junior half,
was severely kicked in the head and
will not be able to play. Gerhart and
Young, of the first-year men, were
hurt and may be kept out of the game.
