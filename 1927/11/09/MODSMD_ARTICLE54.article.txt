## 
### 
Dr. J. Pearce Mitchell, registrar of
Stanford University, is in attendance
at the second annual meeting of the
Pacific Coast Association of Collegi
ate Registrars now in session at Ore
gon State College, Corvallis, Oregon.
At the first session of the conven
tion Registrar C. E. Corbin of the
College of the Pacific gave a report
on the wide adoption of the automatic
dunking rule in colleges of the West.
This device is in operation at Stan
ford, students who fail in their work
being automatically eliminated. Inas
much as the Scholarship Committee is
thus not called upon to consider each
case of poor scholarship the commit
tee is free to take up exceptional
cases.
