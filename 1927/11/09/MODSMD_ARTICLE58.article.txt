Following is the song recommended
by the Rally Committee to be sung in
all living groups tonight. One will be
published every day until the Big
Game rally, with the object of im
proving the singing at the game.
THE CARDINAL IS WAVING
(Key of E-flat —Starting note F)
The Cardinal is waving over the field,
Our men are fighting with a spirit
that will not yield.
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Farewell oh| Berkeley—we're after
you,
Once again the Cardinal will WHIP
the Gold and Blue.
When the game is over and the ioe
has fled,
The Cardinal is triumphant and the
Oski Bear is dead.
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Farewell, old Berkeley—we're after
you.
Once again the Cardinal has
WHIPPED the Gold and Blue.
