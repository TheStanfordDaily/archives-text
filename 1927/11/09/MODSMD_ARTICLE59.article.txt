# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Next Saturday Princeton meets
Yale at New Haven, and the eyes of
the "Effete East" will be centered on
the struggle in the New Haven Bowl,
because this Tiger-Bulldog classic
represents the longest unbroken ri
valry in the history of collegiate sport.
For more than half a century now
Princeton teams have been meeting
Yale teams on the gridiron, and Yale
has won twenty-six times, Princeton
fifteen, and there have been nine tie
games.
This series of colorful struggles has
seen more sensational runs, more
last-minute wins, and more great
heroes of the sport, than all the
games between three or four other
universities combined. Where else can
you find such deeds as those of Ar
thur Poe, Johnny DeWitt, Ted Coy,
Sam White, Hal Pumpelly, Jake
Slagle, and other supermen of the
gridiron?
A little about Bill Roper, Tiger
coach, the man who has no superior
when it comes to instilling fighting
spirit into a team. Psychology plays
a big part in Bill Roper's football, and
makes up for his lack of genius as a
play originator. His record is one to
be proud of. In the last six years his
teams have beaten Y'ale four times
and have been beaten by Harvard
only once! Many of these victories
have been won by "inspiration" and
"spirit," and sometimes the boys from
Tigertown showed so much spirit that

their opponents accused them of play
ing "unethical" football. Roper's teams
were "Big Three" champions in 1922,
1925, and 1926. In the off-season he is
a lawyer and a member of the city
council in Philadelphia.


Ready for Yale
