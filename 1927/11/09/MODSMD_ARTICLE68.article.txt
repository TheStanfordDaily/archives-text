# TARIFF NOTE PROVIDES U.S.-FRANCE PROTOCOL
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 8. â€”Tiie latest Ampri j
can tariff note tonight was believed |
by American and French business and j
official circles to have cleared the j
way for a temporary tariff agreement, j
The note, delivered to the Foreign ;
Office by Charge d'Affaires Sheldon
Whitehouse, has smoothed over the '
last remaining objections to an agree- j
ment which would re-establish the j
former tariff for American goods, ac
cording to authoritative opinion.
The contents of the note are being
kept secret. The Foreign Office, how-1
over, has admitted that the cabled re-1
ports of the note's contents are "gen- 1
erally correct."
It is expected France will send a ;
memorandum expressing an under-!
standing of America's position and j
accepting it as a basis for negotia
tions which would permit signing of :
a temporary accord next week.
