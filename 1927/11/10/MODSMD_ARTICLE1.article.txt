# INTERNATIONAL STRIFE SCORED BY DR. WILBUR
## President Speaks on World Problems in Talk at Mount Holyoke CITES PACIFIC INSTITUTE Present Diplomatic Regime Based on Old Ideas; Now Outworn 
### 
SOUTH HADLEY, Mass., Nov. 9 —
(Special)—"A new era of national as
sociation and international relation
ship is dawning," declared Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur in his Founders' Day
address at Mount Holyoke College.
■"Modern methods of communication
have made the world very small, and
furthered the economic interdepend
ence of nations. Because of this we
appreciate the menace of the attitude
of suspicion in undermining that con
fidence which is necessary in a close
ly knit world."
New Methods Needed
Dr. Wilbur decried existing diplo
matic machinery as based on outworn
methods of association, saying the
lack of adequate information back of
the world's conflicts is appalling. His
advice in regard to this situation was
that each country should know the
•circumstances and conditions of her
neighbors, and make use of all the
•agencies which have the possibility
of developing international under
standing.
Exchange of students between
■countries, and the education of chil
dren to an understanding and friend
ship for other races and other lands,
were stressed by Dr. Wilbur as ex
tremely important in achieving this
international good-will.
Prejudice Causes Discord
"As an example of the possibilities
in this field is the Institute of Pa
cific Relations. From our experience
it seems evident that a large per
centage of the ordinary disputes be
tween nations could be settled simply
by a group of men willing to estab
lish the facts.
"Uncontrolled prejudices based
upon suspicions or upon national or
racial attitudes have been and are apt
to remain the commonest source of
war and discord. The cooling effect
of established fact upon overwrought
emotions indicates that it is possible
to draw many of the most controver
sial questions out of that domain of
contest into that of arbitration and
settlement."
