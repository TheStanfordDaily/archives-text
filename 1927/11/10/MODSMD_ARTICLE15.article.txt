culties face Great Britain at home
and abroad, Prime Minister Stanley

Batho.
j In comparing the situation today
j with that of yesterday, however, Bald-
I win found hope for optimism, espe
cially in view of the friendliness be
' tween France and Germany which,
I he said, had set an example for all
| Europe.
So far as Russia is concerned, the
| Prime Minister said, sketching a pano
j rama of the European situation, Eng
land is not concerned with her form
of government. If the Soviet would
1 change its attitude and agree not to

sumption of diplomatic relations,
Baldwin said. He added his regret,
however, "that so far no evidence of
a hands-off intention has been evi
dent."
