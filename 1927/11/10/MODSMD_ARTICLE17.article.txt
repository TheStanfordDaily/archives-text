### 
PARIS, Nov. 9. â€”The spectres of J
bloc alliance, balance of power and
I control of the Mediterranean appear j
| again on the European horizon, as a
| result of the Franco-Jugoslav "Friend
ship" Treaty which will be signed to
| morrow.

While the Quai d'Orsay declared to
day that the treaty was analagous to
the accords with Czechoslovakia and
1 Rumania for settlement of differences
| by arbitration or friendly negotiations
: the German and Italian press have
I hinted the treaty is aimed at Italy,
i The treaty will be signed by For
' eign Ministers Briand and Marinko
j vitch. M. Nincliich, former Yugoslav
foreign minister who helped draft the
covenant in 1926, said in Belgrade
that actual signing was held up a
year pending negotiations with Italy.
"Franco-Italo-Yugoslav negotiations
failed, however," Nincliich said, sig
nificantly.
