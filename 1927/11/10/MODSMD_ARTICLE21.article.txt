# BY-LAWS COMMITTEE CHANGES AWARD DATE FOR SPORT MANAGERS
## 
### 
Standardization of letters on sweat
ers of all junior managers to "J.M."
and the awaking of letters to major
sports managers at the beginning of
the conference season, with the block
"S" card at the end, were changes
made in the Senior Manager Plan to
conform to the present practice, by
the By-Laws Committee last night in
its tentative work of revision.
Another change involves the ap
pointment of the Senior Manager, the
outgoing Senior Manager making the
recommendation previously provided
to be made by the athletic director.
Recommendation of the outgoing jun
ior manager, when approved by both
the Senior Manager and General Man
ager, for the appointment of the new
Junior Managers was an additional
requirement. No man will be allowed
to compete twice for the same sport
managership.
Aileen Hicks was appointed as Sec
retary of the Committee to replace
Helen Bell, who resigned because of
a heavy scholastic program.
At the next meeting on November
21 social regulations will be taken up
by the committee.
