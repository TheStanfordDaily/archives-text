Lud Prentrup, Ernie Patchett, Herb

die Marks will carry the brunt of the
back field work against Santa Clara
this Saturday afternoon, if the team
that has been working together in
scrimmage will be Pop Warner's
choice to start.

crew of leather-carriers is the same
that played against Nevada several
weeks ago, and can and will take
care of itself. The Big Game is only
nine days off, and Pop is taking 110
chances of having his first string in
jured by the Thundering Broncs.
A1 Cook is slated for the pivot posi
tion since little Walt Heinecke has
been shifted once more, this time to
tackle. Around Cook will probably be
Casey Kazanjian, who should be right
at home with the beefy Santa Clarans,
and Lloyd Macabee. Tackles will be
Ted Klabau, Lyle (Everett, Johnny
Gifford, or Heinecke.
Three good ends, two of which
were playing first string until Spud
Harder returned from the injured list
and broke things up, will be available
Saturday. Louis Vincenti, although
not entirely recovered from his
wrenched leg. and Hodge Davidson
are doped to start. Don Muller, who
gave a shining exhibition against Ore

the game.
