# Meet the President

JjJVEN the sacred office of president of a great university is not immune
from student suggestions as to the course of action to be followed by
the holder of that office. The Yale Daily News is pleading for "closer
bonds" between the university and its president, Dr. Angell. "Under
graduates," says the Ncu's, "are not apt to have much confidence in a
person whom they do not know. They are inclined to distrust his motives,
and where there is distrust there is trouble." The News suggests, as a
possible remedy to the problem, that the president teach at least one course
in the university.
On the other side of the continent—at Pomona College, to be exact —a
college president has appointed an executive committee to take over many
of the routine duties of the president's office. Now it seems that the News'
suggestion and President Blaisdel's action might be combined in many
universities to the ultimate benefit of students and presidents.
TIIAT the average college or university president does have too little
contact with his students strikes us as a true charge. The picture of a
fatherly, white-haired old man, beloved by students and alumni, has
faded away. College presidents, in the main, are younger men than was
formerly the case. They feel that under the press of the many duties of
being a college president, they do not have the time to wander about the
campus joining in friendly informal conversations with the students.
That the growing barrier between an institution's head and its students
is a problem due to the president more than the students is clear. Too
many students are actually fearful of dropping in for a moment's conversa
tion with their president because they know that he is a busy man and
they see little good to come from such a conversation. It seems that the
responsibility for establishing better contact with students lies with the
presidents of the institutions.
THE most suitable means for solving the situation vary with every
campus and this fact makes it a special problem for each president to
solve. No college president who does not make some effort to solve this
question should aspire to the title "educator."
President Wilbur has recognized this problem and has taken a step
to solve it. Several weeks ago he invited to a dinner at his house members
of the Executive Committee, presidents of several organizations, and some
of the publication heads. This afforded an excellent opportunity for
furthering proper co-operation between the student government and the
administration.

college president has appointed an executive committee to take over many
of the routine duties of the president's office. Now it seems that the News'
suggestion and President Blaisdel's action might be combined in many
universities to the ultimate benefit of students and presidents.
TIIAT the average college or university president does have too little
contact with his students strikes us as a true charge. The picture of a
fatherly, white-haired old man, beloved by students and alumni, has
faded away. College presidents, in the main, are younger men than was
formerly the case. They feel that under the press of the many duties of
being a college president, they do not have the time to wander about the
campus joining in friendly informal conversations with the students.
That the growing barrier between an institution's head and its students
is a problem due to the president more than the students is clear. Too
many students are actually fearful of dropping in for a moment's conversa
tion with their president because they know that he is a busy man and
they see little good to come from such a conversation. It seems that the
responsibility for establishing better contact with students lies with the
presidents of the institutions.
THE most suitable means for solving the situation vary with every
campus and this fact makes it a special problem for each president to
solve. No college president who does not make some effort to solve this
question should aspire to the title "educator."
President Wilbur has recognized this problem and has taken a step
to solve it. Several weeks ago he invited to a dinner at his house members
of the Executive Committee, presidents of several organizations, and some
of the publication heads. This afforded an excellent opportunity for
furthering proper co-operation between the student government and the
administration.
