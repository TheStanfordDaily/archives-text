# A 						Muddle of "Facts"

Following are some "facts" bearing on the recent Lindsey news story
controversy that stirred the University of California at Los Angeles:
"Director Moore h?s given his consent to the running of Lindsey stories.
He has never objected. He said suppression of stories was to be de
termined between himself and the editor. Also that Regent Dickson had
nothing to say regarding the matter; it was "none of his business in other
words." We are admonished, in this dispatch, to "use these facts carefully."
In an editorial "letter of explanation" of the matter, James F.
Wickizer, editor of the Daily Bruin, it is made clear that Director Ernest
Moore had no direct connection with the command from the regent
(Dickson) that Lindsey's discussion be barred from the Bruin. In other
words, Moore merely carried out Dixon's request, and Moore, we take it,
is thereby exonerated. But how about Dickson ? The answer seems to be
that he spoke out of turn —that "it was none of his business."
If nothing else, this controversy has apparently settled for U.C.L.A.
the question of what official has the right to ban stories in the student
newspaper—that man is Director Moore. And Moore has given his con
sent to the Lindsey stories. If anyone scored a victory, it
seems that the Daily Bruin may take the credit for gaining the right to
run Lindsey stories.
