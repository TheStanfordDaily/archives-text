UNIVERSITY OK CALIFORNIA, '
Nov. 9.—(P.l.P.)—Professor W. H. |
Durham, chairman of the Department
of English of the University of Cali- j
fornia, declares that the attitude of I
the average American toward his chil
dren's education resembles too close
ly the mid-Victorian/ attitude toward
a daughter's piano lessons. In other
words, too many young men and wo
men are forced to do the traditional
thing regardless of their personal de
sires or abilities.
