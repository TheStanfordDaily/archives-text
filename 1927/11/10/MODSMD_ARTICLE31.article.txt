Campus traditions are to me the
most fascinating things. I mean, the
way they are always changing them
simply is a scream. The Big Game
Bonfire is one of the nicest. It really
is wonderful, too, the way they have
cut down the size of it so that the
freshmen who are building it won't
get discouraged. I mean, the morale
is so much better if they know that
the pyre is only going to be a little
one.
Then, of course, all we girls just
adore the rough tradition. The men
always are so unique in their old
clothes. It makes such a lovely con
trast when we are all together. And
their long beards and dirty cords are
an incentive to make us girls try to
look better. It really is a lot of fun
trying to figure out just who is who.
I mean they all look alike you know.
But there is one tradition that can't
be changed. I mean the excuse for a
lock-out because the car had to be
slowed down over the little road be
tween the San Francisquito bridge
and the highway. That road just can't
be fixed. Why, what would we do with
out those bumps?
