"Sons of the Stanford Red" is the
song recommended by the Rally Com
mittee to be sung in all living groups
tonight. There are two times in this
song, the first three lines and the
fifth moving along rapidly, with the (
fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth '
considerably slower.
SONS OF THE STANFORD RED
(Key of A—Starting note A)
Sons of the Stanford red,
Fight for your Alma Mater;
Fight for the fame of the Stanford !
name—
Undaunted forge ahead;
Hearts that are brave and true,
Down with the Gold and Blue,
Shoulder to shouder, fight and win,
Sons of the Stanford red.
