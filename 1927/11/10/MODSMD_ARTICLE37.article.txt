### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Football Coach John W. Wilce, M.D.,
of Ohio State, seems to be blessed
with an abundant number of things
—things for which numerous other
coaches would almost be willing to
part with an ear or an eye. Jack
Wilce (or "Doctor," as he prefers to
be called, as he is a full-fledged physi- j
cian) has abundant material, one of |
the best athletic plants in the coun- j
try, a record to be proud of, and prob- j
ably the highest ideals of any football j
mentor in the country.
Let's investigate these items and
see if I am not right. First, his ma
terial —wouldn't any coach give three
cheers if presented with a backfield
that included Marek, Eby, Grim,
Alber, and Oshner, and a line that had |
Capt. Meyer at guard and Raskowski |
at tackle? Elmer Marek is a splendid j
open-field runner, a triple-threat man, J
and Byron Eby is the same —only
more so. as he is faster and can hit a ,
line with terrific force. Twin-thunder- >
bolts, these two, plunging, twisting :
ball-carriers who can also punt and
pass with the best of them.
Second, Ohio State's athletic plant, j
would put to shame Harvard, Prince- j
ton, and many other great Eastern '
universities. The stadium at Columbus i
is one of the most beautiful in the !
world, and seats 90,000 persons.
Third, Coach Wilce's record. As an j

athlete, he starred at Wisconsin in
basketball, crew, track, and football,
all the while keeping up a high stand
ing in his studies. He single-handed
i won a thrilling 21-20 victory over Pur
j due in basketball, he stroked the
freshman crew that won at Pougli
j keepsie, and, playing fullback for the
I Badgers against Chicago, caught the
| kick-off and ran 90 yards to a touch
! down. As a coach, his teams have
, won three "Big Ten" championships
| since he took over the Buckeye reins
about thirteen years ago, and have
always been noted for their powerful
and varied forward-pass offense.
Now for his ideals. Jack Wilce is a
fighting Christian, a champion of
I clean sport, and the highest type of
I coach to be found anywhere. His idea
| is to build men and uplift sport rather
j than to produce winning teams, and
for his patience and perseverance he
is often rewarded by bitter criticism
i from the "Old Grads" and the "Down
town Athletic Association." But he
; won't have to worry about a losing
I team this year, unless I am greatly
j mistaken.

athlete, he starred at Wisconsin in
basketball, crew, track, and football,
all the while keeping up a high stand
ing in his studies. He single-handed
i won a thrilling 21-20 victory over Pur
j due in basketball, he stroked the
freshman crew that won at Pougli
j keepsie, and, playing fullback for the
I Badgers against Chicago, caught the
| kick-off and ran 90 yards to a touch
! down. As a coach, his teams have

about thirteen years ago, and have
always been noted for their powerful
and varied forward-pass offense.
Now for his ideals. Jack Wilce is a
fighting Christian, a champion of
I clean sport, and the highest type of
I coach to be found anywhere. His idea

j than to produce winning teams, and
for his patience and perseverance he
is often rewarded by bitter criticism

I team this year, unless I am greatly
j mistaken.


About the Buckeyes
Football Coach John W. Wilce, M.D.,
of Ohio State, seems to be blessed
with an abundant number of things
—things for which numerous other
coaches would almost be willing to
part with an ear or an eye. Jack
Wilce (or "Doctor," as he prefers to
be called, as he is a full-fledged physi- j
cian) has abundant material, one of |
the best athletic plants in the coun- j
try, a record to be proud of, and prob- j
ably the highest ideals of any football j
mentor in the country.
Let's investigate these items and
see if I am not right. First, his ma
terial —wouldn't any coach give three
cheers if presented with a backfield
that included Marek, Eby, Grim,
Alber, and Oshner, and a line that had |
Capt. Meyer at guard and Raskowski |
at tackle? Elmer Marek is a splendid j
open-field runner, a triple-threat man, J
and Byron Eby is the same —only
more so. as he is faster and can hit a ,
line with terrific force. Twin-thunder- >
bolts, these two, plunging, twisting :
ball-carriers who can also punt and
pass with the best of them.
Second, Ohio State's athletic plant, j
would put to shame Harvard, Prince- j
ton, and many other great Eastern '
universities. The stadium at Columbus i
is one of the most beautiful in the !
world, and seats 90,000 persons.
Third, Coach Wilce's record. As an j

athlete, he starred at Wisconsin in
basketball, crew, track, and football,
all the while keeping up a high stand
ing in his studies. He single-handed
i won a thrilling 21-20 victory over Pur
j due in basketball, he stroked the

j keepsie, and, playing fullback for the
I Badgers against Chicago, caught the
| kick-off and ran 90 yards to a touch
! down. As a coach, his teams have
, won three "Big Ten" championships
| since he took over the Buckeye reins
about thirteen years ago, and have
always been noted for their powerful
and varied forward-pass offense.
