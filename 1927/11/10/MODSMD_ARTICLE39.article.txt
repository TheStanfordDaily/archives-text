# ICHIHASHI ADDRESSES EUPHRONIA CLUB ON DEMOGRAPHY TOPIC
## 
### 
"When can we get a majority in a
given society that is intelligent
enough to properly guide progress l
along democratic lines," asked Pro
fessor Yamato Ichihashi, associate
professor of Japanese History, in his j
talk before the Euphronia Debating
Society last evening on "Demography
and Democracy." "Higher education
has given us a greater intellectual
class but the marital tendency among
the intelligensia is not particularly
encouraging and marriage among this
class has not proved productive."
Professor Ichihashi gave the first
course in Demography or the study
of the phenomena of populations at j
Stanford in 1904. Since that time
similar courses have been offered at'
many other universities.
