# Development Of France's Early Architecture Traced In Lecture
## 
### 
"When I see the young land of Cali
fornia, and the houses which sprang
up only yesterday, I feel it almost im
possible to tell how old my country
seems!" declared Mine. Aline Caro-

Dclvaille in her illustrated lecture at
the Little Theatre last night on
French architecture of the middle
ages.
In speaking of the feudal period,
Mme. Caro-Delvaille said, "The small
French landlords were petty sover
eigns. Their castles were their fort
resses, and so windows were small
and walls were thick. There were lit
tle balconies around the tower from
which to pour boiling pitch upon at
tackers. On the inside the lord, his
wife, and children lived simply, in
one big room where everyone gath
ered. The heating system was primi
tive and was only improved when
Voltaire invented a central heating
system.
Expansion Period
"Later, in the fourteenth and fif
teenth centuries, came a period of
change and expansion. Art, and songs
of love were popular. Life was no
longer a question of defense, but of
outrivalling one's neighbor, and as a
result, castles were enlarged and
elaborated. Louis the XIV built what
he thought was the most beautiful
castle in the world. It was not perfect
—it was too big—but it has some

j perfect points.
"Then the French went to war in
j Italy, and brought back with them in
fluences which have beautified France
ever since. The castles became more
I nearly fit to live in. It was about this
| time, too, that religious architecture
i became far less interesting. There
J were no more beautiful churches.
"Those impressive castles which
Americans so admire when they go to
France are the flowers of the French
crown, and were built for the most
part in a period of less than seventy
years, between 1520-1590. Although
these were inspired by Italian pat
terns, they were not copied."
Shows Slides
In the slides, Mme. Caro-Delvaille j
showed representative types from the
different periods, giving the early
castles, with villages huddled at the
: base for protection, and calling atten
j tion to the high towers. Slides from
a later time showed the changing
i style, particularly in the larger win-:
dows.
Her illustrations included typical
: corners of the early French villages.
Both gothic style and renaissance
types of architecture were given, in
particular some views of Cliambourg,
built almost entirely by Frances I. :
Slides of the palace built for j
Madame de Pompadour were also!
I shown.
