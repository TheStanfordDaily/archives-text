"Persons afflicted with a certain
type of color-blindness can see some
tinted objects at twenty feet with
much more accuracy than they can
at four," states Henry Beaumont, who
is at present conducting a series of
tests on the subject of color-vision,
under the supervision of Professor
Walter R. Miles of the Psychology
Department. The purpose of these
tests, taking place in the Psychology
Department, is to verify a newly
founded theory on the subject of
color-blindness.
The subjects for these tests are
the men who in the physical examina
tion at the first of the quarter proved
to have trouble in distinguishing
colors. This year out. of the 450 men
examined, 46 were found color-blind.
In former years the average has been
between three or four per cent.
This is the first experiment of such
score that has been conducted in arti
ficial daylight, the investigators being
of the opinion that this is the only
constant light source.
