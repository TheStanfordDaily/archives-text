]0j) The Imported Leather for "He-Men"!
« There's something about these frank, sturdy,
** old-country leathers that gets close to a man s
iaS .. heart. They bring a feeling of contentment — fritV
like a faithful collie or an old briar pipe. [
They're comrades from the start — and, like ...»
true friends, they improve with age. Their
color mellows and enriches with wear. And,
thoroughbreds that they are, they're as much :
at home at the club or at the office as they are
J on the fairway or among the braes and heather. ||
