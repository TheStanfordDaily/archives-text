# INTERCLASS FOOTBALL TITLE IS AT STAKE IN CONTESTS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Champion of the interclass football
teams will be decided next Saturday
morning when the seniors play the
freshmen on the freshman field, and
the juniors tangle with the sopho
mores on the Grays' field.
At present the competition rests a
tie between the third-year men and
the yearlings who have each won a
game and played a G to 6 tie between
themselves last week. The games this
week will probably bring out some
good football, as all the teams have
had sufficient practice to round out
their plays. The first-year men have
proved the surprise of the series, hav
ing developed a fighting team from
very light material.
If both the freshmen and the jun
iors win their contests the situation
will still remain a tie. The sopho
mores look good to hold the cellar
position.
