# CARDS TO TAKE EASE AGAINST BRONCS TOMORROW AS BEARS STUMBLE OVER HUSKY HURDLE
## Berkeley Game Is Center of Attention; Tough Fight For Second Place HOPE FOR U.C. COMEBACK Stanford Substitutes May Have Job on Hand to Beat Santa Clara 
### Milton Silverman 
While the Stanford second team
will take on the Santa Clara Broncos
;in the stadium tomorrow, the first
| string will rest up for the California
; varsity, which tackles the Huskies
j tomorrow at Berkeley.
I The Washington game will hold the
| center of attraction, for both teams
j are fighting for a hold on second
' place in the conference. Coach Nibs
| Price is going to have a hard after
noon, for the northern squad has no
; love for any football team in the state
| of California.
Will Bears Come Back?
Blue and Gold rooters are insisting
| that the Montana scare of last weelc
will send the Bears into the game
with the famous California comeback
spirit.
Meanwhile, the Stanford substitutes
i will have an engagement at Palo Alto
which might develop into either a
football game or just another work
out. The probable starting lineup in
j eludes Patcliett, Frentrup, and
! Fleishhacker in the backfield, with
Vincenti, Klabau, Kazanjian, Cook,
Macabee, Gii'ford, and Davidson in the
line. Warner may start either Murphy,
Lewis, or Crary at quarter.
S.C. Has Many Hurts
From Santa Clara also comes news
of trouble in finding a quarter. Coach
Walsh has too many injured. Haakin
! son and Barsi, regular signal callers,
have been limping around for the past
week, while Eddie Cummings is out
| for the season. Charles Falk, a former
flankman, has been shifted to the
quarter berth, and will start against
the Cards.
On the other hand, the line will
take insults from nobody. Their per
| formance against the Olympic Club
last week proved that. With Joe Bo
land, former Notre Dame All-Ameri
' can. coaching them, the linesmen
1 know how to play nice football.
"Squints" Granucci, center, and
"Red" Chisholm, tackle, are two San
Francisco youths that are playing in
their last and best season. Warren
Ahart, who also plays tackle, is one
of these great big fellows that always
land up in the front line of a football
team.
