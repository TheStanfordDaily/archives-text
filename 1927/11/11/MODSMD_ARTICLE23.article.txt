# PRINCETON CLASHES WITH YALE IN GRID CLASSIC TOMORROW
## 
### 
Yale and Princeton will play the
national gridiron classic of the week
when they tangle in the Yale Bowl
tomorrow afternoon.
Princeton remains the only large
important university in the country
that has not either been tied or de
feated this season. Yale is recognized
as one of the most powerful elevens
in the East, but probably will bo
playing without the aid of its star,
Bruce Caldwell, who has proved the
outstanding player on the team. Dur
ing the week he was discovered to
be ineligible because of transfer
rules. Princeton, however, has asked
to let him play in the game tomorrow.
Another important fracas will bo
the Notre Dame-Army contest in the
Yankee Stadium. Knute Rockne is
playing one of his hardest seasons
and is making a strong bid for the
national championship. Although tho
Cadets have been defeated by Yale,
they are a strong team and might upset
the Irish in their drive for the title.
Pacific Coast games this week-end
are as follows: Santa Clara at Stan
ford, Washington at California, Colo
rado at TT.S.C., Idaho at W.S.C., O.S.C.
at Oregon, Gonzaga at Montana.
