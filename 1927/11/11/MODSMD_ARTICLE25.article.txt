# Stating the Cases

### 
Because of the agitation among campus women for intramural ath
letics, W.A.A. Board, at its meeting Tuesday night, again took up offi
cially the advisability of such an innovation, and decided to submit the
question to each women's living group for consideration.
At the meeting, Miss Helen Masters Bunting, Director of Roble
Gymnasium, presented the following objections to the proposed intra
mural schedule:
1. It would be detrimental to the health of the women if they
indulged in unorganized competition without observing any training
rules.
2. It would defeat the object of establishing better social con
tacts, since mixed teams further this more than selected ones.
3. It would ruin interclass competition, since women would go
out for intramural instead of interclass sports.
4. It has no connection with the regular work of the gymnasium
department, and would be strictly a W.A.A. activity.
5. It would work against the future good of W.A.A.
6. It would foster a spirit of competition, which would be un
desirable.
7. It would be difficult to arrange a schedule with so many
teams competing.
The arguments advanced by supporters of the project in refutation of
the above are as follows:
1. Competition only three or four times pe* quarter, as is antici
pated by the proposed schedule, would involve no more additional
exercise than would ordinarily be taken.
2. More women would come out for intramural than is the case
for interclass. Hence, it follows that better social contacts would
be established.
3. No points would be given for intramural competition, thus
women working for a Block "S" would have to continue with inter
class to get their points. Very few upperclass women compete in
interclass who are not working for a Block "S." It would probably
get more women out for interclass, too, because if they found they
could play well enough to get on the intramural team, it would in
crease their confidence enough to go out for the regular squad and
thus the quality of class competition would be raised.
4. Each woman pays $5.00 per quarter for the use of the gymna
sium and its equipment. Most upperclass women never use it, and
they would merely be getting the use of the equipment for which
they pay.
5. One can never be sure of a result until the plan is tried. Give
this one a chance. It would probably be beneficial to W.A.A.
6. The main objection to competition is the hard training neces
sary to prepare for a strenuous season. This could be obviated.
Competitive sports on an unorganized basis would be a novel and
interesting diversion from the organization prevalent on the campus.
7. The men have successfully worked out an intramural schedule
with at least five times as many competitors as the women could
hope to produce. The women should be able to follow suit.
The plaintiff and defendants have rested their case. The verdict of
the jury will be returned from the living groups Monday night. It will
then be up to the judge—W.A.A.

Competitive sports on an unorganized basis would be a novel and
interesting diversion from the organization prevalent on the campus.
7. The men have successfully worked out an intramural schedule
with at least five times as many competitors as the women could
hope to produce. The women should be able to follow suit.
The plaintiff and defendants have rested their case. The verdict of
the jury will be returned from the living groups Monday night. It will
then be up to the judge—W.A.A.
Because of the agitation among campus women for intramural ath
letics, W.A.A. Board, at its meeting Tuesday night, again took up offi
cially the advisability of such an innovation, and decided to submit the
question to each women's living group for consideration.
At the meeting, Miss Helen Masters Bunting, Director of Roble
Gymnasium, presented the following objections to the proposed intra
mural schedule:
1. It would be detrimental to the health of the women if they
indulged in unorganized competition without observing any training
rules.
2. It would defeat the object of establishing better social con
tacts, since mixed teams further this more than selected ones.
3. It would ruin interclass competition, since women would go
out for intramural instead of interclass sports.
4. It has no connection with the regular work of the gymnasium
department, and would be strictly a W.A.A. activity.
5. It would work against the future good of W.A.A.
6. It would foster a spirit of competition, which would be un
desirable.
7. It would be difficult to arrange a schedule with so many
teams competing.
The arguments advanced by supporters of the project in refutation of
the above are as follows:
1. Competition only three or four times pe* quarter, as is antici
pated by the proposed schedule, would involve no more additional
exercise than would ordinarily be taken.
2. More women would come out for intramural than is the case
for interclass. Hence, it follows that better social contacts would
be established.
3. No points would be given for intramural competition, thus
women working for a Block "S" would have to continue with inter
class to get their points. Very few upperclass women compete in
interclass who are not working for a Block "S." It would probably
get more women out for interclass, too, because if they found they
could play well enough to get on the intramural team, it would in
crease their confidence enough to go out for the regular squad and
thus the quality of class competition would be raised.
4. Each woman pays $5.00 per quarter for the use of the gymna
sium and its equipment. Most upperclass women never use it, and
they would merely be getting the use of the equipment for which
they pay.
5. One can never be sure of a result until the plan is tried. Give
this one a chance. It would probably be beneficial to W.A.A.
6. The main objection to competition is the hard training neces
sary to prepare for a strenuous season. This could be obviated.
Competitive sports on an unorganized basis would be a novel and
interesting diversion from the organization prevalent on the campus.
