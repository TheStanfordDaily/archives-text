That the number of "vote slackers" in California has been increas
ing yearly is the conclusion reached Professor Charles IT. Titus of the
U. C. L. A.and formerly of Stanford. His observations are timely because
of the flurry of election time throughout the country. Professor Titus' re
markable study which covers the period from 1900 to 1924 shows that
the larger cities arc by far the worst offenders in the number of "vote
slackers."
In a paper soon to be published Professor Titus will raise the ques
tion, "Is democracy and universal suffrage compatible with large cities
and rapidly growing urban regions?"
The question, on the surface, looks like heresy against the doctrine of
democracy. Larger cities than any at the present time are certain to
come in the future and this means, according to Professor Titus' studies,
the probability of relatively fewer people voting in elections. The need
for solving the "vote slacker" problem will become more pressing each
year. Here's a chance for someone to make his place in the hall of fame.
