# Armistice Day!
## 
### 
Almost a decade has passed since the first Armistice Day. Busy
scholars have been prying into archives of the once warring nations and
almost at every turn they have exploded the old theories and ideals of
the war. The propaganda of wartime days has worn thin. No one has
yet definitely fixed the question of war guilt or yet fully determined the
war aims of the Allies and the Central Powers. But serious questioning
of the purity of the motives of all the governments concerned has under
mined the once blindly accepted slogans of the "War for Democracy,"
the "War for Ideals," and those other catch phrases that led men to kill
and to die.
Yet it is only fitting that this one day should be set aside in memory
of those who, like all the rest of us, did once believe in those stirring
slogans and who, firm in their belief, went to their deaths. It's Armistice
Day today!
