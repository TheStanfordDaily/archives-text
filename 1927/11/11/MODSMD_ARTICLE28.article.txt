# Feg Murray Tells Impressions Of Eastern College Campuses
## 
### Gunnar Norberg 
Feg Murray, *16, gave his impres
sions of college campuses and foot
ball stunts in the East, and of the
interest of New York papers in Coast
football, in an Interview with the
Daily yesterday at the Palo Alto home
of his parents, Professor and Mrs.
Augustus T. Murray, whom he is vis
iting at present.
"Generally, I find college campuses
in the East are beautiful, especially
those of Princeton and Cornell on the
Atlantic Seaboard and Michigan and
Illinois in the Middle West. Of course,
they have not the unity of architec
tural effect that Stanford has
achieved, but I find them very at
tractive places in the fall, with brown
leaves falling from the trees, cover
ing the ground everywhere, before
winter comes.
Football Spirit Varies
"Football, I believe, is essentially
the same everywhere, but the spirit
shown by the students varies consid
erably in the East, the Middle West,
and on the Pacific Coast. There is
nothing to compare with the card
stunts you had at the Stanford-U.S.C.
game anywhere else in the country.
Harvard uses handkerchiefs to spell
out H-a-r-v-a-r-d, but it looks pretty
sickly.

"Organized rooting is not so good
at any of the colleges on the other
side of the Rockies, as here, except
ing only the Army, which of course
I pulls everything off with military pre
' cision.
"In the East, there are practically
no bands in evidence at football
games, but in the Middle West some
of the colleges have as good bunds
as those out here.
Warner Brings Attention
"As soon as Pop Warner came to
Stanford, everybody expected big
things to happen at Stanford and,
they haven't been disappointed. The
New York papers are usually inter
ested enough in the games out here
jto run about a thousand words on
j each of the more important ones.
| "Speaking of my sport features, I
might say that there are about sixty
five papers that use my stuff. The New
i York Sun uses it every day. Out here
on the Coast, the Los Angeles Times
uses it about three times a week. I
began doing cartoons for 'Chaparral'
and later continued doing them for
'Judge.' At present all my material is
i syndicated from the New York office.
"I am looking forward to the Big
\ Game this year. It will be the first one
I I save seen since 1914, the last year
; rugby was played by California and
' Stanford.
