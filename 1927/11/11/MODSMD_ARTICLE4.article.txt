# INTERNATIONALIST ASSERTS U.S. WILL SOON OWN HALF WORLD'S ECONOMIC WEALTH

### Margaret Cummings 
"In thirty years' time the United
States will own, manage, and direct
perhaps one-half the economic activi
ties of the world," declared Philip 11.
Kerr, secretary of the Rhodes Trust,
speaking last night on "International
Problems Confronting the Twentieth
Century."
"Nothing can stop this," Kerr con
tinued. "Your country will become
the greatest economic empire ever
known. Outside this country the situ
ation is more fully recognized than
it is here. The United States is ex
porting capital at a rate unknown in
history, and as a result its investors
will own and direct the economic life
of the other nations."

In dealing with the present inter
national political situation Kerr ex
plained the position of Europe in re
spect to the Treaty of Versailles. "It
is popular to decry the Paris peace.
I think it is better to suspend judg
ment. The men who formulated it had
to solve all the political problems of
the world in the space of six months,
in a way which the citizens of the
victorious countries would approve
when they were not present at the dis
cussions, and could not understand
the true situation.
"Now the problem is whether or not
the temper of the nations and the

machinery of Europe will allow the
changes necessary to rectify the mis
takes made at Versailles. Germany
needs peace, and feels that in twenty
years she will be the most important
single factor in Europe. The modifica
tions necessary will be made peace
ably when public opinion compre
hends the true situation."
War Unavoidable
War, according to Kerr, is the most
important of all problems. "I do not
wish to be pessimistic, but I do not
think, with the present differences in
culture and civilization, a certain
amount of war can be eliminated from
the intercourse of nations." This, he
says, is because no other means of
settling disagreements is offered. The
League of Nations approaches this,
and is "a permanent and indestruc
tible element in the political structure
of Europe. If there were another war,
it would function again afterwards."
The United States, being outside this,
has no alternate recourse.
With his outline of the present situ
ation in international politics and eco
nomics for his background, Kerr, as
secretary of the Rhodes Trust, em
phasized the large part to be played
by men who come to esteem Ihe per
formance of public duties as the high
est service. To educate men to this
was Cecil Rhodes' purpose in estab
lishing his scholarships, he concluded.

important of all problems. "I do not
wish to be pessimistic, but I do not
think, with the present differences in
culture and civilization, a certain
amount of war can be eliminated from
the intercourse of nations." This, he
says, is because no other means of
settling disagreements is offered. The
League of Nations approaches this,
and is "a permanent and indestruc
tible element in the political structure
of Europe. If there were another war,
it would function again afterwards."
The United States, being outside this,
has no alternate recourse.
With his outline of the present situ
ation in international politics and eco
nomics for his background, Kerr, as
secretary of the Rhodes Trust, em
phasized the large part to be played
by men who come to esteem Ihe per
formance of public duties as the high
est service. To educate men to this
was Cecil Rhodes' purpose in estab
lishing his scholarships, he concluded.
"In thirty years' time the United
States will own, manage, and direct
perhaps one-half the economic activi
ties of the world," declared Philip 11.
Kerr, secretary of the Rhodes Trust,
speaking last night on "International
Problems Confronting the Twentieth
Century."
"Nothing can stop this," Kerr con
tinued. "Your country will become
the greatest economic empire ever
known. Outside this country the situ
ation is more fully recognized than
it is here. The United States is ex
porting capital at a rate unknown in
history, and as a result its investors
will own and direct the economic life
of the other nations."
Would Suspend Judgment
In dealing with the present inter
national political situation Kerr ex
plained the position of Europe in re
spect to the Treaty of Versailles. "It
is popular to decry the Paris peace.
I think it is better to suspend judg
ment. The men who formulated it had
to solve all the political problems of
the world in the space of six months,
in a way which the citizens of the
victorious countries would approve
when they were not present at the dis
cussions, and could not understand
the true situation.
"Now the problem is whether or not
the temper of the nations and the

machinery of Europe will allow the
changes necessary to rectify the mis
takes made at Versailles. Germany
needs peace, and feels that in twenty
years she will be the most important
single factor in Europe. The modifica
tions necessary will be made peace
ably when public opinion compre
hends the true situation."
War Unavoidable
War, according to Kerr, is the most
important of all problems. "I do not
wish to be pessimistic, but I do not
think, with the present differences in
culture and civilization, a certain
amount of war can be eliminated from
the intercourse of nations." This, he
