# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Amnog the thousands of brave sol
diers who gave up their lives for their
country in the world war were many
famous athletes who had previously
shown their ability to fight on the
football fields of their universities.
Much has been written of Johnny Poe
and Hobey Baker of Princeton —great
athletes and fine soldiers both —but I
wish to write about a man who
though he never made a name for
himself as a football star, neverthe
less played the game hard and fair
at a little college and when the call
came to take part in the biggest
game of all, went to his death in the
face of terrible odds with "gallantry
and intrepidity above and beyond all
call of duty" that won for him the
supreme recognition from his govern
ment.
It is easy to make a parallel be
tween football and war, especially in
William Bradford Turner's case. He
was slow, but forceful, unrelenting,
and persistent in his attack on the
gridiron, hammering away with all
that was in him. So, too, four years
later, in that terrible fight at Ronssoy,
he hammered away at the Hinden
burg line with incredible valor, and

led an attack that took trench after
trench from the enemy. A brave and
lovable boy, Brad Turner. It wa3 my
privilege to know him well, and to
admire and respect his quiet humor,
his keen sense of what was right, his |
determination to succeed, and his ap
pealing personality.
Brad's athletic training stood him!
in good stead in his courageous bat-!
tie with the Germans on September ;
27, 1918, as may be seen in the fol
lowing quotation from the government
citation that accompanied his Con
gressional Medal of Honor: "With the,
utmost bravery he continued to lead
his men over three lines of hostile 1
trenches, cleaning up each one as ;
they advanced, regardless of the fact!
that he had been wounded three
times, and killed several of the enemy
in hand-to-hand encounters."
"Given a job to do, he would stick
to it to the end." '
