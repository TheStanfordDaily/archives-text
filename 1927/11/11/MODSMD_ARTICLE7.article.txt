| colorful cover and the theme of the
no less colorful contents of the No
vember Illustrated Review which was
I issued yesterday.
Dink Templeton says Stanford will
win the Big Game, and in his article
appearing in this number tells the
alumni that the "working and fighting
spirit" the team has developed and
the "hardest kind of a worker and
fighter" that it has elected for a cap
tain are two of the biggest reasons

why.
Some of the secrets of the Warner
coaching system are revealed by Don
ald Gledhill in "Everybody Calls Him
Pop." Then there is a review of "Big
Game Yells," from the Yah-h-h stage
in 1892 to the sophisticated cheers of
today, over which "old grads" and
"moderns" alike will chuckle.
"The Autobiography of a Big Game
Ticket," "Finding Seats is a Problem,"
and "When General Wood Coached
the Cardinals" are other articles that
got to make the current issue what
the editors consider the best one of
the year. But the cover on which
Ruth Taylor White, '19, has depicted
a cross-section of a typical Big Game
audience is the finishing touch, and,
realizing the fact, the alumni office
has made extra copies of it available
for 'twenty-five cents each.
