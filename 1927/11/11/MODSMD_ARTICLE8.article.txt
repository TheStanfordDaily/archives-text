# DEBATE DUO FACES CALIFORNIA MONDAY IN FIRST OF SERIES
## LOWER DIVISION TOPIC Harris, Kirkpatrick Uphold Negative; Affirmative Clashes Tuesday 
### 
Bis Game week, when competition
between Stanford and California
reaches its greatest intensity, will
start Monday when Stanford's debat
ing team meets the California repre
sentatives in the Assembly Hall at 8
o'clock in the evening on the ques
tion, "Resolved: That the Lower Divi
sion at Stanford and California should
be abolished." Henry Harris, a mem
ber of last season's crime squad, and
Leonard Kirkpatrick, debater against
Nevada last year, will uphold the
negative side of the subject for the
Cardinals.
An affirmative team composed of
Phil Cavalero and Gordon Shallen
bevger will debate California Tuesday
night in Berkeley.
The debate comes at a time when
the abolishment of Lower Division is
being discussed pro and con by Stan
ford students and alumni. The speak
ers will discuss the effect of the pro
posed change on athletics, fraternities,
and social life, whether liberal educa
tion will receive a setback or not, and
the future status of the junior college
man.
"The affirmative case is an attrac
tive and logical one, aful has been well
presented in Stanford publications
and elsewhere," declared Professor
James Gordon Emerson, debate coach,
yesterday. "Tiie negative case has
had to depend almost entirely upon
the argument for tradition, with very
little of a practical and concrete na
ture as support. The purpose of Stan
ford's team on Monday evening will
lie to make this argument real and
tangible, and I believe that it is pre
pared to offer a material contribution
in this respect."
