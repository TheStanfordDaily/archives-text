### 
HANKOW, Nov. 13.—(United Press)
—American, British, and Japanese
Marines liave landed here to protect
the city's foreign population.
The city has virtually fallen to Nan
king Nationalist troops following the
disorderly retreat of the forces of
Tang Slien-Tse, Hankow war lord
whose disaffection from the Nation
alist cause resulted in a concentrated
attack upon him.
Bargain to Stop Looting
"General Ho Cliien, who split with
Tang, now controls the city. Ho Chien
was reported to be bargaining today
with Nankingites to save the Wuhan
cities —Wuchang, Hankow, and Han
yang—from looting. Complete demor
alization of General Tang Shen-Tsfe's
army followed his flight from the city.
A portion of the Wuhan army al
ready has surrendered to the Nation
alist forces and has been disarmed.
The Nationalists' position in the
Yangtse Valley, by virtue of Tang's
flight, has been consolidated. Civil
ians are fleeing and a portion of the
native city is afire.
Warships on Yangtse
A large number of American, Brit
ish, Italian, and French warships are
on the Yangtse River, with many of
them at Hankow.
When Tang Shen-Tse, who recently
deserted the Nationalist cause, left his
army, the troops effected a disorderly
retreat in the face of the Nanking ad
vance. Looting began almost immedi
ately in Hankow, Tang's headquar
ters being the first to be ransacked.
