# Gaieties Chorus Will Feature In Dance Novelties
## 
### 
Al Cass, director of the "Foot
ball Gaieties," announces that the
entire cast of the show must re
port at the Little Theatre at 7:30
o'clock tonight for a full rehears
al. At this time the various num
bers of the show will be brought
together.
One of the most unique anil sur
prising novelty dances ever presented
on the campus will be a feature of the
chorus numbers of this year's "Foot
ball Gaieties," according to Cass. The
dance has been worked up with skip
ropes and though the nature of the
novelty is to be kept a secret until
the performance, it lias been hinted
that the dance will present an entire
ly new optical illusion.
Marshall Kirby, a new comedian 011
the campus, will be featured in a few
of his own interpretations. Cass also
announces that the quartet which has
been serenading at the sorority houses
and at Roble has at last been run
down and persuaded to sing a few
numbers for the "Gaieties."
Chorus Opens Program
The chorus of the "Gaieties" will
appear in the opening and the closing
numbers but will not be used in the
skits as in the past. Three individual
numbers will be devoted to them. One
chorus of sixteen will be used instead
of two choruses of Beauties and
Ponies as in former revues.
The personnel of the chorus in
cludes women who have appeared in
campus productions before and also
seven sophomore women who are
making their debut in dramatic activi
ties. The chorus includes California
Andrews, Nancy Campbell, Doris Con
ner, Marianna Evans, Fay Hamilton,
Edna Johnson, Katherine Kamm, Dor
othy Kimberlain, Jeanne Kurtz, Mary
McCleave, Jeanette Owens, Denny
Poole, Frances Sanford, Parnie
Storie, Margaret Waite, and Helen
Ward.
Schedule Made
A strenuous schedule of rehearsals
is being followed by the chorus. The
program was assembled in the entire
Saturday morning for the first time,
and rehearsals are called for every
night this week. With the exception
of the opening number, in which
Powell Carpenter as "Our Captain"
appears with the chorus, the dances
are of entirely feminine personnel.
