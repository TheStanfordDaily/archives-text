### 
GENEVA, Nov. 13. —On the sixth
anniversary of the opening of the
Washington Naval Disarmament Con
ference, the League of Nations is at
last ready to take up the problem of
disarmament from the point where
the Washington conclave left off.
This is the declaration of League of
Nations officials who have now spent
eight years in the study and prepara
tion of the problem of disarmament,
and who expect in 1928 to complete
the last details for the agenda and
convocation of the first general, world
wide disarmament conference.
If the Coolidge conference of last
summer failed to give the same re
sults as the first Washington confer
ence of six years ago, League officials
declare this was principally due first
to a lack of thorough preparation, and
secondly, to wrong methods.
