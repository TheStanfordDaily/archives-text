# ROOS BROTHERS PLAN THIRD SPECIAL TRAIN FOR BERKELEY FANS
## 
### 
Roos Brothers will operate a third
special train between Berkeley and
Palo Alto on the day of the Big Game
because the accommodations are not
sufficient for the demand on the
''Blue" and "Red" de luxe "Football
Specials." The third train will be
known as the "Gold Special."
Roos Brothers officials reported
yesterday that this train is the last
one that can be chartered because
the Southern Pacific Company de
clared that it would be a physical im
possibility to add another train to
their schedule Saturday morning.
The "Gold Special" will leave the
University Avenue station at Berkeley
lit 11:10 o'clock, stopping at Sixteenth
Street, Oakland, at 11:18 o'clock,
First and Broadway, Oakland, at
11:29 o'clock, and arriving in Palo
Alto at 1 o'clock. This train will
leave Palo Alto on its return trip at
6 o'clock.
Like its sister trains, the "Gold
Special" will have a diner and obser
vation car, and will have musicians
on board.
