# HEY! HEY! â€”HAY RIDE LOOMS LARGE BEFORE WOMEN!
## 
### 
Big red wagons piled high with
hay will call for all but fresh
men women in Roble and the
sororities at 5:30 o'clock tomor
row to take them across the
Stanford farm to the quarry near
the isolation hospital. This is
the occasion of the A.W.S. hay
ride, given for all sophomores,
juniors, and seniors so that the
new members may meet the
women in their classes.
There will be music and songs
around a bonfire at the end of
the journey, and then a picnic
supper. Blue jeans or old clothes
will be in style.
