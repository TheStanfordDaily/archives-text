### 
With construction work on the Big
Game bonfire nearly completed, fire
extinguishers, flashlights, and lan
terns are badly needed by members
of the freshman class who are guard
ing the pyre. "At present," say fresh
man officials, "should the bonfire be
prematurely ignited, there would be
practically no way of extinguishing
the flames, and guarding is seriously
hampered because of insufficient il
lumination."
Anyone who can lend the class any
extinguishers or lanterns is requested
to notify Bob Filley, 346 Encina, or
Boynton Tickner, 307 Encina. All arti
cles will be returned in good condi
tion.
California's coffin will be placed
atop the bonfire in a mournful cere
mony tomorrow night under the di
rection of Sequoia Club at the annual
Sequoia Wake. Actual construction is
expected to be complete by then.
Guarding during the rally in
pavilion Wednesday will be taken cart*
of by holdovers, as tradition demands,
but the vigil will be under strict
supervision of the Rally Committee
and care will be taken to see that the
fire is not lighted before the entire
crowd has arrived.
