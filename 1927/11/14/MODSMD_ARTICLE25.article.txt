the pedals, vivid colorature effects
distinguished the recital given in the
Memorial Church Friday morning by
Palmer Christian, organist at Ann
Arbor, the University of Michigan.
Christian found suitable vehicles
for his excellent technique and sensi
tive interpretation in a carefully cho
sen program. His selections were
from the works of modern as well as
the older classical composers.
Sir Edward Elgar's "Sonata in G
Major" gave a contrast in mood from
the vigorous allegro movement with
passages of melody transfer from
treble to bass, and clear, high thrills;
to the slower, wistful andante.
"Sportive Fauns" was an impres
sionistic transposition of a canvas
theme to the organ. Christian's own
composition, "In Memoriam," was
serious in tone, with minor refrains,
some heavy pedal work, and was the
only number in which chimes were
rung.
