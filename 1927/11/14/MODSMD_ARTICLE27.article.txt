# BRONCS SNEAK VICTORY FROM CARD ELEVENS
## Varsity Squad Lets Down in Absence of Pop Warner, Captain McCreery STANFORD INDIFFERENT Santa Clara Team Outfights Dazed Whiteshirts For 13-6 Win 
### Merle Emry 
"When the cat's away the mice will
play," and this is what happened Sat
urday afternoon when Coach Pop
Warner's football team lost to the
Santa Clara Broncos 13 to 6 while
Pop himself was in the Memorial
Stadium getting the low-down on Cali
fornia for the Big Game.
That Stanford would let down
somewhat after the Washington game
was generally recognized and it was
known that Pop would take advan
tage of seeing the Bears in action
against the same players that his
squad beat one week previously. How
ever, these factors did not lead to
grave doubts as to the outcome of the
Santa Clara contest.
Although these were disadvantages
for Stanford, the fact still remains
that the Broncs fought and played
circles around the first and second
Cardinal squads. The Santa Clara
boys in the rooting section were *so
enthusiastic that they poured out on
the field before the echos of the final
gun had died away. They grabbed,
pounded, and carressed their heroes
and were whisking them away when
Referee Braddock tried in vain to
shoo them off the gridiron and get the
Bronc players assembled to stage the
last play again. On the play before
the gun popped Santa Clara was oft
side and the rules call for a re-play
even if the time is up.
A last desperate attempt on Stan
