# BRONCS SNEAK VICTORY FROM CARD ELEVENS
## Varsity Squad Lets Down in Absence of Pop Warner, Captain McCreery STANFORD INDIFFERENT Santa Clara Team Outfights Dazed Whiteshirts For 13-6 Win 
### Merle Emry 
"When the cat's away the mice will
play," and this is what happened Sat
urday afternoon when Coach Pop
Warner's football team lost to the
Santa Clara Broncos 13 to 6 while
Pop himself was in the Memorial
Stadium getting the low-down on Cali
fornia for the Big Game.
That Stanford would let down
somewhat after the Washington game
was generally recognized and it was
known that Pop would take advan
tage of seeing the Bears in action
against the same players that his
squad beat one week previously. How
ever, these factors did not lead to
grave doubts as to the outcome of the
Santa Clara contest.
Although these were disadvantages
for Stanford, the fact still remains
that the Broncs fought and played
circles around the first and second
Cardinal squads. The Santa Clara
boys in the rooting section were *so
enthusiastic that they poured out on
the field before the echos of the final
gun had died away. They grabbed,
pounded, and carressed their heroes
and were whisking them away when
Referee Braddock tried in vain to
shoo them off the gridiron and get the
Bronc players assembled to stage the
last play again. On the play before
the gun popped Santa Clara was oft
side and the rules call for a re-play
even if the time is up.
A last desperate attempt on Stan
ford's part, a pass from Hoffman to
Ilyland over the goal line, failed and
the game was over. It was a different
looking squad of men wearing the
red-and-white socks that trudged off
the field from the bunch that strolled
on some two hours previous. They
were stunned as well as looking
mighty serious.
McCreery Needed
Besides needing Pop Warner on
the bench, Stanford needed Captain
Hal McCreery to stabilize the Stan
ford line. McCreery was with Warner
at Berkeley. Like the backfleld, the
line showed erratic streaks of smart
playing but it could not always be
depended upon for support as the
fighting Broncs, lead by Chisholm and
Valine, broke through too many times.
Santa Clara's first score came in
the first quarter as a result of the
McCormick - Cunnnings combination.
After an exchange of punts between
Frentrup and Cummings, with Cum
mings getting the better of the deal,
the Broncs worked the ball down to
Stanford's 28-yard line. Here McCor
mick tossed a pass to Cummings who
caught it on the Cardinal 15-yard line
and cavorted through Stanford's de
fense for a touchdown. McCormick
failed to convert.
Stanford Scores
Stanford pulled the expected come
back by scoring in the second quar
ter. Sims started the march by put
ting the ball on his 35-yard line on a
run from a reverse play. Frentrup
passed to Vincenti who was downed
on Santa Clara's 28-yard line. Frent
rup then passed to Muller who took
the ball to the 6-yard line. Fleish
hacker bucked across the line, making
Stanford's lone score. Lewis failed to
add the extra point.
Cardinal rooters were betting how
much Stanford's score would be run
up as they saw the varsity first string
swing into action at the beginning of
the third quarter. After recovering a
blocked punt and executing a series
of passes, Stanford could get no far
ther than the Bronc 25-yard line, and
gave the ball to Santa Clara. Simoni
then got off a punt which went 75
yards before it was stopped, the long
est in the game. An exchange of
punts again and Santa Clara put the
ball on Stanford's 14-yard line. A
lateral pass netted the Broncs 5 yards
and a short pass from Falk to McCor
mick, who was across the goal line,
resulted in Santa Clara's second and
final score with Falk covering.
From then on it was a desperate
fight with the Cardinals spending
every nerve on scoring and Santa
Clara resisting them tenaciously
every inch. The only time that Stan
ford came near scoring was when
Warner's men marched down to the
Bronc 13-yard line using reverses and
passes with Davidson and Preston on
the receiving end. Then Hoffman
passed to Preston, who was in the

clear over the goal line. The fast
rush of Chisholm and the weight and
wetness of the ball made the attempt
a failure, and in a few minutes the
game ended.
