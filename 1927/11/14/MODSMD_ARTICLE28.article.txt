# JUNIORS WIN CLASS GRID CHAMPIONSHIP BY TROUNCING 1930
## 
### 
Juniors won the Interciass football
championship Saturday morning by
trouncing the sophomores 18 to 0,
while the seniors were cleaning the
freshmen G to 0.
The championship was virtually de
cided in the evenly matched first game
of the schedule when the juniors de
feated the seniors 2 to 0. The fourth
year men hold second place, the fresh
men third, and the sophomores claim
the cellar championship with three
defeats.
Playing on a slippery field, the
seniors outplayed the yearlings in a
good exhibition of football. Although
the freshmen never penetrated be
yond the thirty-yard mark, the fourth
year men scored only one touchdown.
Good senior defense, with spurts of
good offense delivered by Van King
and Brown, managed to overcome the
scrappy babes.
The juniors had an easy time with
the sophomores, pushing over three
touchdowns in four eight-minute quar
ters. The second-year men could not
meet the steady playing of the cham
pions. Fox and Winter played good
ball for the winners, Northrup, Nye,
and Stanley coming through for the
losers.
