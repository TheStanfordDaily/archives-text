# Re-Stating the Case
## 
### 
In the Campus Opinion column today is a communication from Miss
Helen Masters Bunting, Director of Roblc Gymnasium, objecting - to the
"tone" and the content of the editorial in Friday's paper concerning' the
proposed intramural athletic program for women.
The Daily editorial in question merely stated the two sides of the
question in order to allow the'living groups to have a basis for discussion,
from which they could draw their own conclusions as to the project.
The objections presented by Miss' Bunting, as stated in the editorial,
were taken from her remarks at the W.A.A. Board meeting last week.
The arguments in refutations are 110 conclusions of the Daily but were
taken from the statements made at the meeting by Board members and
the sentiment of prominent campus women who had been interviewed on
the subject.
As for the."tone" of the editorial, there was 110 implication that there
did not exist a cordial relation and co-operative spirit between the
Women's Athletic Association and the Department of Physical Education
for Women. We hope, with Miss Bunting, that such "will always be the
case."
The Daily heartily agrees with Miss Bunting's statement that "We
can count 011 Stanford women not to take any hasty or immature action,
but to give this matter the thorough investigation and careful considera
tion which it deserves." The editorial was designed to assist the Stanford
women in reaching a conclusion so based. The "objections 1-7" were
not attributed to Miss Bunting as her own personal views. Such objec
tions were taken from statements which she made concerning the pro
posed plan.
The "plaintiff" (i.e., those who favor this plan) and the "defendant"
(i.e., those who oppose it) have stated their cases. The decision as to
whether or not the women want intramural competition will be reached
at meetings of the living groups one week from tonight.
