The Board of Athletic Control has begun moving into its new
$102,000 office buildng about which considerable comment has been made
in student circles. It might be appropriate at this time to give some
figures of expenditures of the Board of Athletic Control.
The stadium which, due to the efforts of the football team, is perhaps
the largest source of revenue for the Board of Athletic Control, has
reached its present size after two additions to the original structure. In
1924 the stadium, seating 60,000, was completed at a cost of $234,000.
Two additions have been made since that time: one calling for 10,200
more seats at a cost of $168,000, the second, calling for 16,500 additional
seats, at a cost of $190,000. The total cost, then, comes close to $592,000.
Branner Hall, donated to the University by the Board, was erected at
a cost of $437,000, of wh'ch the Board still owes $350,000. The Board
relieved itself of the burden of expense coming from another structure —
the basketball pavilion—by finishing the payment of its $27,000 share.
These figures, given to the Illustrated Review by General Manager
Alfred R. Masters, are deserving of consideration along wth the annual
budget of the Board which, for the year 1927-1928, estimates expendi
tures at $274,000. The total revenue for the year is estimated at $300,000.
The foregoing constitutes some excellent food for thought on the
part of those students who informally discuss the monetary expenditures
and income of the Board of Athletic Control. Don't think that the
Board has money to burn—it hasn't!
