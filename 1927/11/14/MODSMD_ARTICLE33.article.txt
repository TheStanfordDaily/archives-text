Like many other Stanford students at the California-Washington
game, we were more than surprised by the megaphone announcement of
"Santa Clara, 13; Stanford, 6." Similarly, we were surprised, too, by
the many cheers from the spectators in the Berkeley stadium at the
announcement of the Cardinal's upset—but that's neither here nor there.
One thing is certain and that is the fact that California's showing
against the Husky team and Stanford's loss to Santa Clara is bound to
cause some query of the hitherto excellent chances of the Cardinal in
the Big Game. Speaking in the vernacular, the betting odds are going
down and more California money will come into circulation.
Stanford still leads the Coast Conference with three wins and a tie;
Stanford is still the favorite in the Big Game. So why worry?
