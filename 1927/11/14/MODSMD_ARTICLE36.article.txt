### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your latest editorial concerning wo
men's athletics has, we regret to note,
what seems to us a mo'st unfortunate
tone. There certainly is no question
of "plaintiff" and "defendant" in the |
matter of intramural sports for the
women of Stanford. There has al
ways existed a most cordial relation
and co-operative spirit between the
Women's Athletic Association and the
Department of Physical Education for
Women. This department sincerely
hopes that that will aways ho the
case.
I should like to take this oppor->
tunity to say that the "objections" so j
systematically attributed to me in !
tabulations 1-7 of your editorial are j
far from expressing my views on the j
matter. If space permitted I should i
like to reply to them one by one, but '
since it does not I should like simply j
to say:
First that it is a fundamental prin- j
ciple from the standpoint of hygiene j
that all vigorous athletic competitions j
should always be preceded by a period
of systematic preparation. The Wo
men's Athletic Association has recog
nized this principle in its already es
tablished interclass competitions. I
have permission from the Department
of Physical Education for Men to say
that as soon as adequate equipment
can be provided their whole intra
mural program will be put on such a

j basis and that they are working to
ward this ideal.
Secondly I should like to say that
; the question of interhouse competi
! tion, with all the fundamental princi
; pies involved, in under widespread
; consideration throughout the country
and a survey of the same is at present
being made by the University of Wis
consin. In some of the institutions
where it has been tried it has been
abandoned because it failed to con
tribute to the best interests of the
athletic association as a whole.
I Third, 1 should like to say, although
I it should be obvious to all, that my
j chief function as Director of Athletics
! for Women is to help Stanford women
;to develop their athletic program
j along the lines that will be, in the
i long run, of greatest benefit to all,
j and to help them to get a broad out
, look and a long perspective on their
: whole athletic situation. I feel that
J we can count on Stanford women not
j to take any hasty or immature action,
; but to give this matter the thorough
investigation and careful considera
tion which it deserves.
I shall be glad to discuss this situa
tion in detail with anyone who is
sufficiently interested to come to talk
with me about'it.
Yours very truly,
HELEN MASTERS BUNTING,
Director of Physical Education
for Women.
