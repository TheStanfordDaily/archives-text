# AND Then Our Little SALLY---
## 
### 
I am so glad that rainy weather has [
come. I mean it is so nice because i
of our gym classes; that is. it is so
much more fun to swim when it. is
raining. Ann now that it get 3 dark ;
so soon we have to have electric
lights, just like football practice.
OL' course, if the class is tennis or
hockey we have loads of fun just
getting together, trying to learn how
to play better by talking up a good j
spirit. I mean, that is one of the j
things that stand out in that depart
ment.
I think that physical training classes
are wonderful for the girls in more ;
ways than one. You see, the instruc
tors are very particular about slang,
and chewing gum, and talking in
class. And if some one is not careful |
she gets a smoke-up, just as in gram- i
mar school.
Since there has been so much chat-1
ter on our suits, I really have been
trying to think of a solution. There ;
are so many arguments on both sides 1
like, being warm, but flattering, and i
all that sort of thing, that the only
conclusion that I could possibly think
of was just not to have any classes at
all. And I sincerely think that in the
end, every one agrees with me.
