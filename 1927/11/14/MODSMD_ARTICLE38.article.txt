We are quite sorry for you. Father
Ricard is reported to have said that
there will be rain the day of the Big
Game, and he can predict the weather
with more certainty than Breakers
Club can the outcome of campus elec
tions. We shall see you all from the
press box, which is as you know cov
ered with canvas, and trust that the
I glorious cardinal in your rooters' caps
will not dissolve and run down your
; necks onto your white shirts.
I Perhaps it will be fair after all.
i Father Ricard may have forecast the
! precipitation with the inteition of
frightening us. Nothing, with the ex
! ception of an announcement that the
! Upper Division was to be abolished,
A SCHOLAR FOR A' THAT
Louis Vincenti, Warner's flashy
end, is a conspicuous example of
what the college athlete seldom
I is—a Phi Bete. The learned young
man has a bawlout average which
is positively revolting, as Little
Sally might say, and is a fine
rushing prospect for the P.B.K.'s.
Dud DeGroot, one-time skipper of
the Redshirt varsity, wore the
key, but no football man has
since, to our memory.
