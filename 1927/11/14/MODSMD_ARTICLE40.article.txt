# FAMOUS RED-HEADS

Sorrel-tops have figured strongly in
the history of the world from the time
of Julius Caesar down to George
Bernard Shaw, the pink-whiskered
bard who once penned a most amus
ing play about the aforementioned
Roman redhead's girl-friend, Cleopa
tra. So, too, have flaming-thatched
athletes left a crimson trail across the
pages of athletic history, and it is
about some of these "Scarlet Stars in
Sports" that I write —using red ink,
of course.
Red is the badge of courage and
red-headed athletes seem to have j
more fighting spirit, more aggressive-1

ness and more of the "will to win" |
than their blond or brunette brethern. |
In boxing the most famous examples
of sorrel-tops are Bob Fitzsimmons,
known as "Rudy Robert"; Frank Mo
ran, who once fought a twenty-round j
bout with Jack Johnson, if memory
doesn't fail; and Bobby Barrett.
Baseball boasts of many flaming
thatched wonders. "Red" Faber, fa
mous old spit-ball pitcher of the Chi
cago White Sox; Larry Benton, who
did such noble work for the Giants
last summer; Hughey Jennings, "Red"
Ames, "Red" Murray, Fred Lucas, f
Wingo, "Red" Smith, "Red" Ormsby,
the umpire, and you might even say

I that those two great right-handers,
I Grover Alexander and Dazzy Vance,
are red-headed.
Not forgetting "Red" Green in
hockey, "Red" Murray in handball,
and Maurice "Red" McLoughlin, that
fiery comet of the courts, who won
the United States singles tennis
championship in 1912 and 1913.
Now for football! "Red" Grange
—you've probably heard of him —
also "Brick" Muller, that wonderful
end, who can throw a football as you
or I would throw a baseball, and who
likewise excelled in track and field
athletics. And remember "Red" Bar
ron, that much-feared ball-carrier from

I Georgia Tech, and "Red" Roberts, the
' giant end from Centre College in 1921
land '22? Last year "Red" Barnes was
fcaptain of the Alabama team —in fact,
the Crimson Tide boasted of three
sorrel-topped backfleld stars —and the
Notre Dame team was led by two red
headed captains, "Red" Hearden and
"Red" Edwards.
