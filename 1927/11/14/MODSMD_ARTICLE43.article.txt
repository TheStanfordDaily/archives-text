# HILLSBOROUGH, MEMO CLUB PLAYERS DOWN CARDINAL POLO MEN
## 
### 
In one of the fastest matches seen
on local turf for some time, Stanford's
polo squad went down to a 14 to 13
defeat Saturday before a team com
posed of players from the Menlo Cir
cus Club and the Hillsborough Coun
try Club.
The visitors allowed the Cardinals
a nine-point handicap and had some
difficulty in overcoming it and in
emerging victorious. The superior
mounts of the mixed quartet aided
materially as the Stanford ponies

j slowed down toward tho end of the
| game. Perkins, playing number 3, and j
! Travis, number 4, starred for the op- j
posing side while Captain Chauncey O. '
Thompson, number 3, was the out-1
' standing player for the Cardinals.
