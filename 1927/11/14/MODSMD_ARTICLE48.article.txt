# MALONEY WILL MISS MEETING OF A.A.U., OLYMPIC COMMITTEES
## 
### 
Harry W. Maloney, director of
minor sports and president of the
Coast district of the P.A.A., announced
last Saturday that he would bo un
able to attend the conference of the
A.A.U., and the Olympic Committee
meeting which are to be held in Cin
cinnati, Ohio, starting November 20.
This news was roceived with dis
may in Coast swimming circles, for
besides the loss of Maloney's vote in
the A.A.U., his influence will be
missed when the vote is held to de
termine the awarding of national
championship meets and Olympic try
outs.
Coach Maloney had planned to
leave tomorrow for the East with
Coach Ernst Brandsten, but a soccer
game next week and other important
matters preclude any possibility of
liis leaving.
