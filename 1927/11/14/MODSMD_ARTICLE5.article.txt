# BANCITALY HEAD DECLARES COLLEGE EDUCATION ASSET
## 
### GUNNAR NORBERG 
"What chance do you figure a col
lege graduate has in the banking
business?"
This question was put to A. P. Gi
annini, president of the Bank of Italy>
at his office in the Bancitaly Corpora- j
tion building in San Francisco, Thurs
day afternoon. Although, Giannini,
himself, has never matriculated at any '
college, he is far better educated than j
the average of those who have. He
speaks French, Italian, and German
with nearly as great ease as he does j
English. He reads everything, and he
absorbs page after page with tre- j
mendous rapidity. A large man physi- j
cally, a giant mentally, Giannini is j
impressive. The very room in which
he alternately sits and stands behind
a large desk on which there is a neat
pile of papers to which he attends;
the room, itself, seems surcharged
with an altogether pleasing energy,
his magnetic personality is diffused
throughout the place, giving to the j

whole a warm, genial glow, pervading
it with such a spirit, as makes the
doing of work, play only. lie talks
rapidly, evenly, without interruption.
His deep, resonant voice suggests
power. His speech is as an efferes
cent torrent, appearing to inhibit ideas
too long if words cease to come even
for a moment.
Opportunities Great
"A serious-minded young man can
go ahead faster in banking than in
anything else. Given two men of equal
ability, one with a college education
and the other without it, the college
man would be sure to come out ahead.
But if the man without it has a better
brain, he will come out on top; of
course, for him it will be harder but
he'll get there.
"The man who doesn't go to college
gets into the business, six, eight,/ or
ten years earlier than the man who
does, and gets a lot of experience. I
think that if a man can do it, he
should get up and go to school at
eight o'clock in the morning and at
three o'clock in the afternoon go to
work, do something along the same
line as he will follow after he gets
out of college. For the average man,
however, I think that a college educa
tion taken by itself is a big advan
tage.
Interest Needed
"A young man should go into a
business in which he is interested. He
ought to forget himself completely;
he ought to think only of the corpo
ration for which he is working; if he
does this, he is sure to move up. He
should think of his work as a pleasant
thing, think of it as he does of base
ball or football.
"When a man tries only to build a
fortune, he worries and has a bad
time of it, if things don't happen to
turn out right. Of course, he will se
cure a competency for himself, but he
will never enjoy his work. There is
a joy in in accomplishment, a pleasure
in doing something better than some
one else, these things, the one who
works only for dollars and cents
misses."
It has been said of Mr. Giannini,
himself, that he has largely forgotten
himself in a desire to serve. This,
which is true of himself, he wishes to
impress upon others.
According to Major F. L. Kerman,
to whom Giannini referred the writer
for details, the personnel department
of the Bank of Italy interests itself
in Stanford, U.C., and U.S.C. students,
who have decided to make banking a
life work.
