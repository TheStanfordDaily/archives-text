"The true Stanford traditions are,
not such affairs as the mudfight and
the new extinct tie-ups, "plug-ugly," j
and what-not, but are reflected in j
something deeper and finer," declared i
Comptroller A. E. Roth last night;
when speaking before Encina Club on i
the second Frosh "Y" informal pro
gram.
"Stanford men have always been
noted for their fine sportsmanship,
clean living, and democracy," the!
speaker added. "The last is perhaps ;
the most evident. It is practically im
possible to distinguish between the
student who has a literal million dol-1
lars and the fellow who is working his J
way through school."
Roth also related much of the early j
history of the University to the fresh- j
men, many of them from personal j
experience.
