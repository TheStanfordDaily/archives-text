We're Not Anticipating Bad Luck
but—
There are two things you may need for the
BIG GAME.
HOSIERY
An extra pair of dress hose in case a run de
velops just before the big event.
And in case of stormy weather a pair of warm
silk or silk-wool—a pair in reserve will be an
insurance against disappointment.
$1.50 to $2.50
Galoshes $2.50 to $5.50
It's worth the price just to know that your
pleasure will not be marred nor your health en
dangered by damp feet—to say nothing about
the saving on your footwear.
