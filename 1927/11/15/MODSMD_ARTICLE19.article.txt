# Communist Party Expels Former Bolshevik Leaders
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Nov. 14.—Leon Trotzky
and Gregory Zinovicff, Bolshevist lead
ers since the revolution ten years ago,
were expelled from the Communist party
Saturday night, it was learned today.
The expulsion means the full eclipse
of the two men, who with Lenin, con
trolled Soviet Russia in the first forma
tive years of the new government.
Trotzky, former commisar of war, and
Zinovicff, former secretary of the Cen
tral Executive Committee—the post now
held by the powerful Joseph V. Stalin—
fell out of party favor a year ago for
opposing the government and were ousted
from the central committee.
