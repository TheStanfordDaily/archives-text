# BRANDSTEN LEAVES TO ATTEND ATHLETIC CONFERENCE IN OHIO
## P.A.A. Directs Coach to Bid For National Meets Next Spring 
### 
Coach Ernst Brandsten is leaving !
by train today from San Francisco for
Cincinnati, Ohio, where he will attend
the A.A.U. conference on November
20, 21, and 22. In conjunction with this
will be a meeting of the American
Olympic Committee, including these-1
lection of Olympic team coaches.
Brandsten left yesterday for San
Francisco where he attended the!
P.A.A. conference; Walter Christie, 1
University of California track coach,
and Ernest Smith, retired San Fran
cisco swimmer of note, and fourth
vice-president of the A.A.U., are also
going as P.A.A. representatives from 1
the Coast.
The A.A.U. conference will be held i
to close the Union's financial year
and to award national meets. P.A.A. |
has instructed Brandsten to bid for
either the Indoor or Outdoor National
Championship meet, or the Olympic
tryouts, which are to be held some- !
time next spring. The Association is I
allowed six votes, and has other ad
vantages: all swimmers who have
competed in this state have been very
enthusiastic, and Brandsten lias con-;
siderable influence due to his wide '
experience in aquatic circles. It is
regretted that Harry W. Maloney,
president of the P.A.A. and former i
member of the Olympic nominating 1
committee, cannot attend to use his j
influence toward getting one of the i
meets mentioned above for California. 1
Brandsten will stop at the Univer- j
sity of Minnesota and Northwestern I
University to discuss intercollegiate j
swimming meets, and will return No- j
vember 29. The Pacific Amateur As-'
sociation includes Oregon, Nevada, |
and California as far south as San.
Luis Obispo.
