# REDSHIRT TEAM STARTS SECRET GRID SESSIONS
## Rumor Current That "Pop" Accused Men of Being "Puffed Up" HARD WEEK SCHEDULED Dry Field Needed for Spin, Reverse Plays; Game Plans Unknown 
### Templeton Peck 
Secrecy settled like a blanket over
the activities of the football squad
yesterday afternoon when Coach War
i ner ordered the no-admittance sign
| posted at the gate leading to the var
j sity practice field. From now on until
: a certain Saturday afternoon, no one
i will know what the Redshirts are en
gaged in except the men themselves,
j and they will be too tired to tell.
The news leaked out, nevertheless,
that Pop lined up the men on the
1 bleachers and gave them a tongue
| lashing that would have outdone Dink
j Templeton at his height of form,
j 'Puffed up" was one of the expres-
I sions Pop used in his nettling drawl
that had everyone squirming.
It is nd secret that the Cards are
due for a hard week's work. Pop may
have thought they were a good foot
ball team, but after leaving them to
topple over Santa Clara, only to have
: his week-end spoiled by an unneces-
J eary defeat, he can't have much re-
I liance to place in the boys.
: yet, on the other hand, the men are
fighting mad and dead in earnest for
the Big Game. The Old Fox told them
! they would have to fight to beat Santa
Clara, but the sly young foxes were
I not so sly and slipped up on their as
j signment.
In addition to getting his charges
i into shape, Pop will spend the week
j wondering what the weather will be.
He needs a dry field for his reverse
and spin plays, yet the season's rec
ord shows that the team refuses to
fumble only when the ball is wet!
i T hen again, Warner is faced with the
; quandary of planning the attack. Will
the Redshirts step out ahead of the
Bears and stay ahead, or will he have
to smoke an extra package of cigar
; ettes while thinking up last-minute
i ruses to avert defeat? It's fun being a
| football coach, except during the grid-
I iron season.
