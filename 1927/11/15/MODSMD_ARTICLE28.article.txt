# "Official Lawlessness"
## 
### 
An article entitled "Official Lawlesness" is found in the October
number of Harper's Magazine, written by Oswald Garrison Villard. The
treatise discloses certain facts concerning the operation of that gentle
method of police grilling known as the "third degree," facts damning to
the police and detectives of this country.
The theory of American criminal law is that a man is innocent until
he is proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but it would appear the
practice of the gentlemen employed to track criminals is to "get their man"
(anyone will do) and intimidate him to such an extent that he will gladly
admit anything rather than undergo further tortures.
A. C. Sedgwick, of the New York Times, had occasion to be an
invisible guest at one of the "initiations." An excerpt from his personal
observation runs: "Blow after blow from the rubber hose, blackjacks, and
night sticks. The prisoners fall to the floor. The blood pours from their
faces. They spit and cough blood .... a detective kicks a prisoner in
the face, pulls him to his feet, props him against the desk, then with the
butt end of his revolver makes a gash in his head. The three prisoners go
to the hospital."
This is merely one of the means used to force suspects to confess to
something of which they may or may not be guilty. It is immaterial to
the inquisitors whether they have an innocent man or not. Their object
is to get a confession. It may mean a promotion.
There is no excuse for such treatment of prisoners. The men involved
work on the theory that the worst crime is to allow a guilty man to get
away, but they do far greater harm both to themselves and to the nation,
by causing innocent persons to lose their respect for "the law." The
press in Indianapolis asserts that there were 22,325 arrests in 1926, and
only 7,518 convictions. This means that 14,000 people arrested were
innocent in the eyes of the law, and that 14,000 tongues will denounce
the police, the courts, and the government of the United States.
In London the police do not carry revolvers, and the "third degree"
is practically unknown. It is also to be noted that in the United Kingdom
the murder toll for a year is less than that in a middle-sized American
city. Surely some of this great difference may be accounted for by the
attitude of the police.

practice of the gentlemen employed to track criminals is to "get their man"
(anyone will do) and intimidate him to such an extent that he will gladly
admit anything rather than undergo further tortures.
A. C. Sedgwick, of the New York Times, had occasion to be an
invisible guest at one of the "initiations." An excerpt from his personal
observation runs: "Blow after blow from the rubber hose, blackjacks, and
night sticks. The prisoners fall to the floor. The blood pours from their
faces. They spit and cough blood .... a detective kicks a prisoner in
the face, pulls him to his feet, props him against the desk, then with the
butt end of his revolver makes a gash in his head. The three prisoners go
to the hospital."
This is merely one of the means used to force suspects to confess to
something of which they may or may not be guilty. It is immaterial to
the inquisitors whether they have an innocent man or not. Their object
is to get a confession. It may mean a promotion.
There is no excuse for such treatment of prisoners. The men involved
work on the theory that the worst crime is to allow a guilty man to get
away, but they do far greater harm both to themselves and to the nation,
by causing innocent persons to lose their respect for "the law." The
press in Indianapolis asserts that there were 22,325 arrests in 1926, and
only 7,518 convictions. This means that 14,000 people arrested were
innocent in the eyes of the law, and that 14,000 tongues will denounce
the police, the courts, and the government of the United States.
In London the police do not carry revolvers, and the "third degree"
is practically unknown. It is also to be noted that in the United Kingdom
the murder toll for a year is less than that in a middle-sized American
city. Surely some of this great difference may be accounted for by the
attitude of the police.
