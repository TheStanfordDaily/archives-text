The question of women's intramural athletics has started much fire
works, with the Daily on the receiving end of a few skyrockets. The
Daily advocates and would like to see the introduction of inter-living
group competition among women. It holds that such a plan would be
feasible, and, though it would cause a bit of work in the handling of such
a system, that there would be worthwhile benefits to come from such a
plan.
If the women of the University, by vote and uninfluenced by any
considerations save those of "thorough and careful" investigation, favor
the plan, let it be tried out. If, in the end, it can be shown that such a
plan does not prove practicable, then the innovation can be dropped.
It is not a question of W.A.A. versus the Department of Women's
Physical Education, unless one or the other should seek to hinder any
cordial and co-operative spirit in the discussion of this proposed plan.
Right now the question is that of those who oppose the plan against those
who favor it with 110 designation of those who officially uphold one side
or the other.
