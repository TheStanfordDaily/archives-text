Stanford's loss to Santa Clara may be said to open the question of
whether it is "right" for big universities to attempt to use little college
teams as set-ups or fill-ins on a grid schedule. The question would have
been opened even if the Cardinals had defeated Santa Clara 102 to 0.
Santa Clara, before the game, was regarded as a set-up.
As a matter of fact, we don't think that there is any logical question
of "right" or "wrong" in scheduling games with small college teams.
There are not enough large college teams on the Coast to fill up a football
schedule for the season. If the little college team can upset the big
universities, well and good. They deserve their victories.
