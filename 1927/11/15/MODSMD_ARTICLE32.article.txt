### 
Ambrose Martin, president of the j
Stanford Masonic Club, announces j
that, there will be a meeting of all
DeMolays and past DeMolays In the j
Old Union at 7:30 o'clock tonight to 1

consider and discuss plans for a cam
pus organization of the DeMolays sim
ilar to that of the Masonic Club.
Such an organization which is lin
