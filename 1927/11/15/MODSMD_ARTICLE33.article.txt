MAGIC FIRE MUSIC
That great pile of telephone poles,
boxes, and old tires, the freshman
bonfire, which is to warm the hearts
of Stanford rooters (and of several
thousand fascinated spectators) and
kindle the sacred flame of lofty school
enthusiasm, rises and grows day by
day. Already it is a very fair sample
of what it will be just before the
torches are applied.
But —the last few days have always
been the hardest, and this time will
undoubtedly be the most critical, not
only for this occasion but for the
future. It remains to be seen whether
there is a necessary and inevitable
connection between fires and fire
water. Last year came very close to
being the last for Big Game bonfires,
and there is no doubt that the tra
dition — a real, authentic tradition
with a past—is on trial this time.
There is no reason why it should
not justify itself.
Very wisely the Rally Committee
set specific and practical limits for
the size of the pile, so that there need
be no meaningless attempts to "shat
ter all previous records for size"
which will result only in a flimsy and
perilous construction that defeats its
own purpose by falling within the
first three minutes of burning. The
thirty by thirty by forty size is more
than ample for heating, lighting, and
enthusing, and with these dimensions
and the work progressed so far al
ready, it should be possible to arrange
a schedule of work for the freshmen
which will eliminate all excuse for
such a wild and disorganized last
minute scramble as has filled the
thirty or forty hours before the great
incineration in some previous years.
Probably all suggestions for a san
er «iiul safer bonfire building will be
classed as more attempts to systema
tize all the fun out of such things, and
to bleach away what little color of
life there still remains in a man's
first year at Stanford. But was the
prevailing tone of last year's fire

building (which was, for all too many
frosh, a dull and deadly gray, succeed
ed by a very disagreeable brown —
taste) to be regarded as desirable in
a first-quarter color scheme?
During the three days before the
fire last year, a freshman on the
Quad —and there were few enough of
them there— could be spotted four
times out of five, by large dark cir
cles under the eyes, and a strained,
abstracted expression. Attendance in
Citizenship and other predominantly
first-year classes fell off scandalously
all during the week. Consumption of
liquor increased even more than usual
around fire time, and much of it went
down throats of those unaccustomed
to it (we do not refer to holdover gul
lets!) but willing to co-operate in this
as well as everything else. Off-campus
ladies lacking inhibitions were pres
ent, and apparent ....
As a University which is so emi
nently concerned for the good health
of its student body as to require its
women students of all ages safely
within doors by 10:30 five nights out
of seven, mere consistency would
seem to recommend that all the first
year men not on guard duty have a
chance at least for a little honorable
and well-earned sleep before they see
the fruits of their labors go up in
smoke. Not, as last year, to be burst
'n upon by a crowd of raucous —albeit
well-meaning — enthusiasts, dragged
out of bed and set to doing feverish
and ineffectual work. Loud stampings
in the midnight Encina halls, reflec
tions on the paternity of those frosh
who are reluctant to get on the boat,
out of bed, into their clothes, and
outdoors —there has been enough of
this sort of thing during the past
three or four years.
The frosh are entitled to be in con
dition to enjoy the Gaieties, the Rig
Game itself, and whatever follows.
And barring pre-ignition or earth
quakes, it seems that they will be,
and the bonfire will prove itself a
success.

But —the last few days have always
been the hardest, and this time will
undoubtedly be the most critical, not
only for this occasion but for the
future. It remains to be seen whether
there is a necessary and inevitable
connection between fires and fire
water. Last year came very close to
being the last for Big Game bonfires,
and there is no doubt that the tra
dition — a real, authentic tradition
with a past—is on trial this time.
There is no reason why it should
not justify itself.
Very wisely the Rally Committee
set specific and practical limits for
the size of the pile, so that there need
be no meaningless attempts to "shat
ter all previous records for size"
which will result only in a flimsy and
perilous construction that defeats its
own purpose by falling within the
first three minutes of burning. The
thirty by thirty by forty size is more
than ample for heating, lighting, and
enthusing, and with these dimensions
and the work progressed so far al
ready, it should be possible to arrange
a schedule of work for the freshmen
which will eliminate all excuse for
such a wild and disorganized last
minute scramble as has filled the
thirty or forty hours before the great
incineration in some previous years.
Probably all suggestions for a san

to bleach away what little color of

first year at Stanford. But was the
prevailing tone of last year's fire

building (which was, for all too many
frosh, a dull and deadly gray, succeed

During the three days before the
fire last year, a freshman on the
Quad —and there were few enough of

times out of five, by large dark cir

abstracted expression. Attendance in
Citizenship and other predominantly
first-year classes fell off scandalously
all during the week. Consumption of
liquor increased even more than usual
around fire time, and much of it went
down throats of those unaccustomed
to it (we do not refer to holdover gul
lets!) but willing to co-operate in this
as well as everything else. Off-campus
ladies lacking inhibitions were pres
ent, and apparent ....
As a University which is so emi
nently concerned for the good health
of its student body as to require its
women students of all ages safely
within doors by 10:30 five nights out
of seven, mere consistency would
seem to recommend that all the first
year men not on guard duty have a
chance at least for a little honorable
and well-earned sleep before they see
the fruits of their labors go up in
smoke. Not, as last year, to be burst
'n upon by a crowd of raucous —albeit
well-meaning — enthusiasts, dragged
out of bed and set to doing feverish
and ineffectual work. Loud stampings
in the midnight Encina halls, reflec
tions on the paternity of those frosh
who are reluctant to get on the boat,
out of bed, into their clothes, and
outdoors —there has been enough of
this sort of thing during the past
three or four years.
The frosh are entitled to be in con
dition to enjoy the Gaieties, the Rig
Game itself, and whatever follows.
And barring pre-ignition or earth
quakes, it seems that they will be,
and the bonfire will prove itself a
success.
