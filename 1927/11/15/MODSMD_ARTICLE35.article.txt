The Editor, Sir:
What with Bull Session propaganda
for open-mindedness and the annual
revision of By-Laws, and things of
such a nature going on full blast —as
Chappie would put it —what about the
Goofs?
Everyone knows that these fellows
contribute materially to the building
of Stanford football teams, but no one
seems to feel that they merit any
official recognition of their efforts.
Other universities make some sort of
award to their "Goofs" or "Grays,"
and surely ours are worthy of equal
consideration.
It may be said that there are men
on the varsity squad who get nothing
for their efforts, but such is not the
case. Besides getting ten extra tick
ets to the Big Game (no small item
in itself) and having their names on
every program, these men always
have the possibility of engaging in
active competition against other col
leges.
Now this is purely an impersonal
matter with me —the nearest I come
to a football field is a seat in the
rooters' section, but I do think that
as long as we recognize meritorious
effort in practically every other line
here on the Farm, we are very unjust

n slighting the "Goofs." How about
i little discussion of the matter?
Thanks.
