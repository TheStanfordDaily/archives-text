Question: Is it possible to flunk out
and graduate the same quarter? That
is, may a student earn less than fif
teen units during the quarter preced
ing his graduation if he has enough
hour points to make up for his last
delinquent quarter?
Answer by Mrs. Margaret D. Hus-|
ton, secretary of the committee on i
scholarship:
Yes, 110 can. Graduation is under !
the jurisdiction of a different com- j
mittee than the scholarship commit- j
tee. '1 lie graduation requirements are j
that a student must make as many ;
grade points as registered units. He
must have passed 180' units of work.
His major department must recom
mend him. Grade points may be made
ahead of time so that none need be
made the last quarter. A student can
fail to meet the scholarship require
ments in a single quarter, meet gradu
ation requirements, and yet graduate.
He must meet the same requirements
before re-registering as any other dis
qualified student.
Question: What is the speed limit
on Palm Drive exclusive of the 15 |
mph speed allowed at intersections?
Answer by Fred Frelie, deputy sher
iff of Santa Clara county:
On that section of Palm Drive |
bounded by points 400 feet from the |
state highway and 400 feet beyond j
the road to the Mausoleum, the state j
law permits a speed limit of 40 mph
if there is no other car within 100 i
feet moving in either direction. With
the exception cited above and the!
15 mph ruling at intersections, the j
state law provides a speed limit of !
20 mph on the campus.
