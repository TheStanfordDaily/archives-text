Nevers, thou shouldst be with us at
this hour!
Stanford hath need of thee, her foot
ball men
Play like cigar store Indians. Now
and then
Their very impotence brings to mind
that tower
Of force thou wert, thou, who didst
once our
Cardinals lead and with them win
the pen-
Nant race in '25; O, raise us up
again,
For sad we need speed, interference,
power.
Thy running, Ernie, was a thing of
art,
Thy punts would soar like
birds on wing;
While of thy passing all the scribes
did sing
Such praises high as set thee on thy
way
To all-American full. May thy brave
heart
Serve to inspire the Cards on Big
Game day.
