Westbrook Pegler, who might
be called dean of the humorous
sport writers, save for the fact
that deans are rarely humorous,
has discovered that the Eastern
football championship situation,
if any, is in a muddle. Further
investigation would have led the
noted authority to the conclusion
that such is also the case in the
West. If anyone can imagine a
more complicated and at the
same time ludicrous tangle than
the clumsy one the Pacific Coast
teams have got into this year,
he may go to the head of the
class.
You have the diverting spec
tacle of Stanford and U.S.C. in a
tie for the P.C.C. championship.
Stanford has been beaten by two
non-conference Catholic colleges,
both of which the rival Bears
beat. The Trojans are by no
means universally favored to win
from Washington next month in
the final conference game, and
were the Huskies to win and were
Stanford to defeat California
(which is another debatable as
sumption), the Cards would have
open claim to the P.C.C. title and
a perfect record for the season,
except for two defeats and a tie
game! If U.S.C. beats Washing
ton and California trims Stanford,
the Trojans will rule the roost.
Etc., etc. Clearing up this mud
dle is worse than learning to play
chess. And then, of course, there
is the time-honored problem which
has always worried the Old Boy—
what about crew?
