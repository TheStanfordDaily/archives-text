# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
President Washington and Presi-,
dent Jefferson probably never played
football, but, man, how the Presidents I
of Washington and Jefferson Univer
sity play it! The wearers of the Red
and Blaek tackle West Virginia tlii3
coming Saturday, and, as any roulette
player will tell you, Red and Black is
a hard combination to beat. Carnegie
Tech and Lafayette, among others, '<
have learned it to their sorrow this
year. The big gun of the Washington,
Pa., college attack, and the little man
behind the guns, are "Big Bill" Amos,
the fullback, and Little Andy Kerr,
the half-pint coach.
Let's consider "Big Bill" first. Ac
cording to Coach Kerr, Amos is a
greater all-around football player than
Ernie Nevers was, except in the mat- j
ter of punting, and, as Andy coached !
Ernie at Stanford, he should know
whereof he speaks. "He could make j
any team in the country," avers
Amos' coach. And why not? Isn't this
"Wild Bill of the campus" a fine line
plunger, an elusive open-field runner,
good kicker, passer, interferer, and
defensive player? Amos learned his ;
football "Over there" at the age of'
seventeen when he was a soldier in |
France. From Kiski Prep he went to
the "Presidents," and soon became a
fixture on the eleven. Now he is in
line for Ail-American honors.
Andy Kerr played football at Pitts
burgh and started coaching at the
Johnstown, Pa., high school in 1900. |
In 1914 he went to assist "Pop" War

ner at Pitt, where he became head
track and basketball coach as well.
This is his second season, I believe,
as football and bsketball coach and
supervisor of track athletics at Wash
ington and Jefferson.
