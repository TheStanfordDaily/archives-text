When the last ursine ashes ascend

is sung as the flames begin to die
•down at the bonfire tonight, followers
of the Golden Bear who may be
sprinkled around the outskirts of the
crowd will tremble and hasten back
across the bay under cover of the
night.
For Santa Clara will be forgotten,
and those gathered around the em
bers will know that Sons of the Stan
ford Red are behind their gridiron
warriors to a man in the same fashion
that has in the past spelled defeat to
Berkeley ambitions.
With Stanford students arriving en
y —
masse in a parade following the band,
and thousands of alumni already

finished ten thousand spectators will
group around the Big Game bonfire to
see the annual accomplishment of
freshman labor envelope the Califor
nia coffin in tall, red flames.
Dan Evans, student body president
in 1921-22, will be the main speaker
at the rally. Pop Warner wlil talk,

the varsity team and all coaches will
be there.
