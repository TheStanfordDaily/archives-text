### 
BUCHAREST, Nov. 15.—The surpris
ing acquittal of Michael Manoilescu, who
was charged with conspiracy because he
acted as envoy to former Crown Prince j
Carol, was characterized today as a "cold j
shower for Premier lon Bratianu."
The effect of the acquittal by a vote of |
three to two may be far reaching, be- j
cause it has created the impression that,
the Bratianu government's power, al-1
though dictatorial, is not strong enough 1
to cope with the rising tide of pro-Carol
ist propaganda.
It is believed the government may seek j
a basis for reconciliation with Carol, as!
it was evident from the court martial
that the army is not wholly subservient j
to the Bratianu regime.
