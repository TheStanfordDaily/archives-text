# CALIFORNIA FANS BELIEVE WARNER FEARS BIG GAME
## Secret Practice for Cards Shows Coach Worried, Say U.C. Backers 
### Milton Silverman 
Secret practice preparatory to the
j Big Game is having at least one re
| suit. California backers are claiming
that for the first time in his life
Coach Pop Warner is afraid of the
Bears. Therefore he demands locked
doors while he makes a last-minute
attempt to arrange something, any
thing that will withstand the all
powerful attack of the Blue and Gold.
The Bears, no doubt, are a strong
team. They have met good opposi
tion, and have beaten most of it. They
defeated the only two elevens which
downed the Cardinals. They have
some wonderful backfield timber, and
a better than average line.
Not only Warner, but the entire
Pacific Coast respects California for
the brand of football they display and
their real fighting spirit. But Warner
was never actually afraid of any team
in his life.
A bad case of overconfidence in the
Santa Clara game will probably be a
good thing for the Cardinals. In the
secret practice sessions, they are go
ing to listen to Warner, who is by no
means trembling in his boots, and do
what he says, and by Saturday they
will be able to show these Telegraph
Avenue coaches that even though
whiteshirts may at times be overcon
fident, they are never so timorous as
not to know what to do with the ball
when they get it.
