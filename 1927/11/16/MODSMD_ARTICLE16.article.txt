# OLD BOY TO MAKE ANNUAL BIG GAME APPEARANCE TODAY
## 
### 
"True to form," announced the
Old Boy patriotically, while he
put the cuff links in his annual
rooting shirt, "Chaparral will be
the first to start the celebrations
for the Big Game. Students will
be given an opportunity to get
their Big Game issues today on
Quad from 8 o'clock on."
Although Chaparrals will be
sold outside the stadium Satur
day, the Quad sale of the Big
Game issue is being held two
days earlier in order that stu
dents will have first chance at
the copies.
A resume of fables of the
farm, some facts about "Pop"
Warner's private life, and a dis
closure of an editorial scoop for
the Old Boy, will be a few of the
features.
