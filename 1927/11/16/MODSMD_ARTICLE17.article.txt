# NEW ZEALAND HOPES TO LEAD DEMOCRACY STATES JAMES HIGHT
## Social Legislation Is Result Of Anglo-Saxon Mind Believes Speaker 
### 
"It is the desire of the New Zealand
democracy that it shall lead the way,"
Professor James Hight, from the Uni
versity of New eZaland, said, as char
acterizing his country's political atti
tude, in his lecture in the Little Thea
tre last night.
This claim is particularly relevant
versity of New Zealand, said as char
stituted, according to Professor
Hight, who cited such important con
tributions as establishment of an old
age pension, female suffrage, vote by
ballot, and representation of the na
tives by natives.
"Social legislation here is the re
sult of the essentially practical Anglo-
Saxon mind," says Hight. Government
control in many fields, including care
ful regulation of immigration, and the
fixation of wages has led the mass of
the population to attribute the gen
eral prosperity to state legislation, de
clares the lecturer.
In discussing New Zealand's rela
tions with the United Kingdom, Pro
fessor Hight said no close intercourse
was maintained with Canada, or with
Australia, in spite of their nearness.
South Africa has attracted the trade
and interest of New Zealand to a
much greater extent.
Extensive trade and a population
homogeneous in blood and interests
have made for a peaceful prosperity,
states Hight. Out of the nineteen or
twenty million population, only about
5000 are race aliens.
