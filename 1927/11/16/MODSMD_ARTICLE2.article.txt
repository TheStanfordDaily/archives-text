# PENINSULA MUSICAL ASSOCIATION OFFERS BRASLAU, CONTRALTO
## 
### 
Sophie Braslau, noted American
•contralto who will sing in the Stan
ford Assembly Hall tomorrow night
under the auspices of the Peninsula
Musical Association, is a unique figure
in contemporary musical life. Born
and educated in New York City, she
is one of the few artists of today who
is equipped by nature and training to
•carry on the great vocal traditions of
the past, and America can justly be
proud of her accomplishments.
Despite the popular credo that a
European reputation is essential to
success in this country, Sophie Bras
lau was firmly established in this
country before she duplicated her
American triumphs abroad.
As a girl her musical gifts were
evident when she set her heart on
becoming a piano virtuosa. Her sing
ing voice was so extraordinary, how
ever, that her teacher insisted that
she abandon the piano for the vocal
career.
