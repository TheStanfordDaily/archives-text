"I would like to prophesy that the La
bor party will come back to power in
England within a short time, although
whether it will be in four months or two
years I don't know," said Harold R.
Benjamin, Director of Practice Teaching,
in his talk before the Founders' Day
meeting of Phi Lambda Theta Mon
day afternoon.
"When this takes place the Fisher Act
of 1918 will he enforced and England's
educational system improved."
In spite of the efforts of Minister of
Education Herbert Fisher to organize a
more efficient and central school control
after the war, the cabinet was loathe to
make any unnecessary expenditures im
mediately. Besides, many people felt
that higher education for the masses was
non-essential if not undesirable.
"The elementary school teachers of
England are a strong political force," said
Benjamin. "They have unions similar to
trade unions in this country, and their
influence is keenly felt."
