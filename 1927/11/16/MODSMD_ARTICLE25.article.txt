# Making Students Responsible

It has come.
"Student control" of the automobile situation on the campus has been
granted. This means that the authority to try student offenders of the
set of rules published elsewhere has been delegated to the Men's and
Women's Councils. These Councils have also the power to fix the penalties
for such violations.
The list of regulations which goes into effect on December 1 is the
result of the efforts of a joint committee from the Councils meeting with
Comptroller A. E. Roth. The system of fines, as now formulated, was
modeled in accordance with the traffic and speed code of San Francisco,
according to Fred Wool, chairman of the Men's Council. The fines, he
adds, are from one to three dollars below those of the Bay City. It is
understood that the money to be derived from the fines will help to defray
the expense of the additional police force necessary to insure compliance
with the regulations.
As yet, it is hard to predict just how successful the plan will be. That
the list of regulations will need revision is our prediction. For example,
the third offense on "improper alignment" will bring revocation of the
right to drive on University property for one quarter. If this refers to
"double parking" the penalty is probably satisfactory, but revocation is too
strict for the other interpretations possible under "improper alignment."
We question, too, the wisdom of a similar revocation penalty for second
offense speeders.
The foregoing are two criticisms of the new set of rules. It is not to
be expected that the first set of rules under the new system of control
will be perfect. There will have to be revisions of some sort.
Necessity for some sort of action was occasioned, it is said, by two
factors: the increase in the number of automobiles on the campus, and
the number of automobile accidents. Two courses of action were open:
abolition of automobiles on the campus, or adoption of some method of
enforcing regulations.
The plan adopted—that of more effective policing—will, we believe,
insure the enforcing of the regulations. Abolition of the automobiles has
been averted; co-operation on the part of automobile drivers is necessary
to insure the success of the plan which goes into effect December 1.
