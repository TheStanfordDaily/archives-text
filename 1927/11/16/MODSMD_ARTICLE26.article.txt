# "By Popular Vote"
## 
### 
A part of the Stanford community Monday night showed itself, by a
substantial vote, to favor the retention of the Lower Division. Such is
the interpretatiojto place on the audience vote in Monday night's debate
with California. of the University's definite commitment to the
further underclasses within a short period of years, one
would expect to discover Stanford students and professors attempting to
content themselves with the Junior College idea and rationalizing the
position of acceptance into which they find themselves thrust.
Not so, however. One hundred and seven agreed with Stanford's
negative team which favored retention, while eighty-six were swayed by
arguments for abolition.
Lven after hearing both sides of the debate, one listener was still
undecided as to whether the Lower Division should be relegated to the
Junior College. In an effort to clarify his bewilderment, he threw out
the following question after the debate proper had been concluded : "Is not
culture the sum total of knowledge and hence only finally obtainable
through research?" Ilis point was that research, which "is generally
thought of as being at swords paints with culture, actually leads to the
latter. Abolitionists ' believe the university primarily should stimulate
research, shifting the burden of broadening the student to lower schools.
"Retentionists" hold culture is better attainable m the Lower Division of
the university than in Junior College.
Leonard Kirkpatrick of the Stanford side answered the question
clearly. There are three definite steps in the acquisition of knowledge, he
said. I'acts, without their significance or bearing on other facts, arc in
culcated in grammar and high school; previously learned facts are exam
ined and established coherently in the student's mind during the first two
years in the university; and then, but not until then, the educational
product has a foundation for research. Yet it is blind, Kirpatrick
asserted, for the student to attempt research without the benefit of the
co-ordination of knowledge accomplished in the Lower Division.
The case lies here until Philip Cavalero and Gordon Shallenberger
argue its other phases tonight at Berkeley.
