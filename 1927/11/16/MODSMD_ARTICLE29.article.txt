# STANFORD RECEIVES LETTERS OF CECIL RHODES RECIPIENTS OF OXFORD SCHOLARSHIPS DESCRIBED STUDENT SHOULD SEEK PUBLIC DUTY AS AIM
## 
### 
Original letters of Cecil Rhodes,
English Empire builder and states
man, concerning the foundation of his
Oxford scholarships, have been given
to the University for the Hoover War
Library. These letters are extremely
rare and have already attracted a
number of people to the library.
Dislikes Bookworms
One, written from Madeira by
Rhodes to his friend, Hawksley, de
scribes the author's idea of men he
wished to receive his scholarships. He
said, "I think 1 have hit the phrase.
'In awarding the scholarships great
consideration will be given to those
who have shown during school days
that they have instincts to lead and
take an interest in their schoolmates,
which attributes will be likely in
after life to guide them to esteem the
performance of public duties as their
highest aim.' The last thing I want is
a bookworm. I do not think you will
beat the above. The thought came
from the sea.
"The temporary nature of human
life is very depressing. As 'soon as
you have drafted it (the idea) kindly
post to me for signature, or some
hidden devil may whip me off before
my worldly depositions are signed."
Fosters Imperial Thought
In another letter to Hawksley,
dated July 1899, and written on board
a Union Steamship Company liner, he
said: "My idea as to the yearly in
come of the balance of funds in my
estate after providing for present
scholarships and perhaps some more
that trustees may create: my idea is,
that they should be spent on the
maintenance and extension of the Im
perial thought by a party literature
. . . . You might in time have a dis
tinct Imperial party in the House of

Commons though the name might be
distasteful to the electors and there
fore perhaps better avoided. You
should also select the best of the
students and send them to different
parts of the world to maintain the
Imperial thought. In the colonies they
would be better unmarried as the
consideration of babies and other do
mestic agencies generally destroys
higher thought. Please understand I
am in no sense a woman-hater, but
this particular business is better un
trammelled with material thought."
Fears Insinuations
A third letter dated February 21,
1886, and written from the Kimberley
Club, Kimberley, South Africa, to
Shippard, another South African ex
ecutive, deals with the problems pre
sented by the various native tribes.
"I am afraid," lie said, "I shall not be
able to run up and see you as I am
rather busy with my mining matters
and until all land matters are over in
your territory I think it is better not
to pay you a visit as else I shall be
exposed to some more scurrilous in
sinuations from my opponents.
"I am glad you gave that Veybrug
contingent a lesson. It seems to have
quieted them down. Why cannot they
go out and farm instead of drinking
all day at canteens and plotting all
kinds of sedition with a view of creat
ing disturbances in the country. They
appear to be not the least changed
since I was there."
A letter marked "confidential" writ
ten by Milner to Rhodes in 1901 con
gratulates the latter on his scholar
ship project. "I think it is conceived
in the most broad and munificent
spirit, and is calculated to produce an
f-ffect out of all proportion to the
mere money outlay, enormous though
that is," he said.

hidden devil may whip me off before
my worldly depositions are signed."
Fosters Imperial Thought
In another letter to Hawksley,
dated July 1899, and written on board
a Union Steamship Company liner, he
said: "My idea as to the yearly in
come of the balance of funds in my
estate after providing for present
scholarships and perhaps some more
that trustees may create: my idea is,
that they should be spent on the
maintenance and extension of the Im
perial thought by a party literature
. . . . You might in time have a dis
tinct Imperial party in the House of

Commons though the name might be
distasteful to the electors and there
fore perhaps better avoided. You
should also select the best of the
students and send them to different
parts of the world to maintain the
Imperial thought. In the colonies they
would be better unmarried as the
consideration of babies and other do
mestic agencies generally destroys
higher thought. Please understand I
am in no sense a woman-hater, but
this particular business is better un
trammelled with material thought."
Fears Insinuations
A third letter dated February 21,
1886, and written from the Kimberley
Club, Kimberley, South Africa, to
Shippard, another South African ex
ecutive, deals with the problems pre
sented by the various native tribes.
"I am afraid," lie said, "I shall not be
able to run up and see you as I am
rather busy with my mining matters
and until all land matters are over in
your territory I think it is better not
to pay you a visit as else I shall be
exposed to some more scurrilous in
sinuations from my opponents.
"I am glad you gave that Veybrug
contingent a lesson. It seems to have
quieted them down. Why cannot they
go out and farm instead of drinking
all day at canteens and plotting all
kinds of sedition with a view of creat
ing disturbances in the country. They
appear to be not the least changed
since I was there."
A letter marked "confidential" writ
ten by Milner to Rhodes in 1901 con
gratulates the latter on his scholar
ship project. "I think it is conceived
in the most broad and munificent
spirit, and is calculated to produce an
f-ffect out of all proportion to the
mere money outlay, enormous though
that is," he said.
Original letters of Cecil Rhodes,
English Empire builder and states
man, concerning the foundation of his
Oxford scholarships, have been given
to the University for the Hoover War
Library. These letters are extremely
rare and have already attracted a
number of people to the library.
Dislikes Bookworms
One, written from Madeira by
Rhodes to his friend, Hawksley, de
scribes the author's idea of men he
wished to receive his scholarships. He
said, "I think 1 have hit the phrase.
'In awarding the scholarships great
consideration will be given to those
who have shown during school days
that they have instincts to lead and
take an interest in their schoolmates,
which attributes will be likely in
after life to guide them to esteem the
performance of public duties as their
highest aim.' The last thing I want is
a bookworm. I do not think you will
beat the above. The thought came
from the sea.
"The temporary nature of human
life is very depressing. As 'soon as
you have drafted it (the idea) kindly
post to me for signature, or some
hidden devil may whip me off before
my worldly depositions are signed."
