# POLO SQUAD TO MEET NINTH CORPS AREA IN GAMES TODAY, FRIDAY
## Both Teams Rated as Equal; Cards Will Use Trick Plays in Tilts 
### 
Playing with a string of horses that
on the whole equals that of their op
ponents, with individual exceptions,
the varsity polo team stands an even
break in today's and Friday's games
with the Ninth Corps Area.
No handicap is given either team
in this series. Many new trick plays
have been instituted this year by the
varsity which ought to aid materially
against army men.
The line-up for the series is as fol
lows: Weymouth at No. 1, McDougall
at No. 2, Thompson at No. 3, and
Connolly at No. 4.
The opponents' line-up will be:
Lieutenant Butler at No. 1, Captain
Kilbourn at No. 2, Major Ilucker at
No. 3, and Lieutenant Griffith at No. 4.
