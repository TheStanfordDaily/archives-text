I The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the article in this
j morning's Daily about Stanford's
i besting California in debating I
I should like to suggest that outside
of being a misstatement of facts, it
reflects a provincial attitude upon the
part of the campus newspaper. For it
seems to me too bad that we are un
i able to hold a discussion of some
i topic of intellectual Interest upon this
| campus without beins pestered with
! the question, "Who won?"
The vote on the debate Monday
j night, as has been the custom in past
i debates, was solely upon the merits
of the question, and the statement
that such a ballot proves a team vic
! Tory is certainly embarrassing to both
j the Stanford and the California
i speakers. For surely, after both teams
tried to take objective points of view
in dealing with the question, it is
painfully reminiscent of high school
[ days to be told that one side or the
| other "sold" its case to the judges.
And, in conclusion, may we hope
that no one thinks that the purpose
iof intercollegiate debating is to dis
cover whether or not the "home
team" is the best, or that no one be
lieves that the Stanford debaters, in
j this instance, feel that the audience
| decision was "for them" rather than

for the side of the question thny had
chosen. Yours, with thanks,
L. H. Kirkpatrick, '29.
