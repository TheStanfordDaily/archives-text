Original drawings by Feg Murray,
whose cartoons appear each day in
the Daily are now being exhibited in
the Graphic Art department. Exam
ples of each stage of the drawing,
printing, and mat-making processes
are shown.
"Murraymentos for Editors" consti
tute the finished product which is
sent, to the newspapers of the country
every week. This is a large sheet on
which are six cartoons. The work is
done two weeks ahead of time as it
takes that length of time to do the
engraving, printing, mat-making, and
mailing.
Pencil, Brush Used
The original drawings are made on
two kinds of paper, ross-board and
croquil. Ross-board is a chalk-coated
surface on which it is possible to
draw with soft pencil and crayon to
give a dotted effect like tiny pen
points. The cartoons are drawn first
in brush and ink. Then gray is applied
with crayon or soft pencil. This gray
can be scratched off the ross-board
with a sharp surface.
