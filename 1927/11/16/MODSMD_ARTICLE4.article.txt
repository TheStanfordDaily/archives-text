# BABE SOCCER TEAM TO MEET SAN JOSE SQUAD HERE TODAY
## 
### 
Babe soccer men will meet the San
Jose Junior College team at 4 o'clock
this afternoon. This is the second
time that the two teams have played,
the yearlings taking the first game 4-3.
The Junior College squad is much
heavier than the freshmen, and is
determined to avenge its defeat in
the first game. The babes have a
stronger team than is shown by their
scores. They outclassed the Bear
Cubs in each contest with them, but
tied the last game 1-1, because two
scores were lost on off-side penalties.
Following is the starting line-up:
outside left, Mujica; inside left, Do
moto; center forward, Nichols; inside
right, Eberliart; outside right, Black;
left half, Dienstein; center half, Rey
nolds; right half, Jackson; left full
back, Burns; right fullback, Dalton;
and goalkeeper, Wight.
