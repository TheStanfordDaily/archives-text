ing their third season for Stanford, !
Wheatley his second, and Thomas his [
first.
Strong competition for all the
places is expected to be provided by i
Joseph Castellanos, Lawrason Dris
coll, and Ernest lienzel. Castellanos ;
played on the 192S freshman team but
iet his game slip somewhat through !
lack of practice until last summer,
when he took up the sport again in
earnest.
Renzel also is a former freshman i
star, class of '29. He played seventh

proved his game sensationally during >
the last two years.
Heading the freshman team is John j
Doeg, alternate on the American
Davis Cup team, and 1927 national

sesses a powerful game built around J

East on, two Southern California high
