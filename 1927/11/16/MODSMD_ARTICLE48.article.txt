# 'GAIETIES' REHEARSAL IS SET LATE DUE TO CONFLICT WITH RALLY
## Request Cast to Report in Costume; Purpose to Co-ordinate Revue 
### 
Members of the cast, chorus, and musi
cal specialties of the "Football Gaieties"
must report in costume at 9 o'tHock to
night at the Assembly Hall. This will
give members opportunity to attend the
Big Game Rally, but will not allow them
time to see the bonfire.
Rehearsal tonight and tomorrow night
will be used chiefly to unify the entire
revue. Plans arc almost completed for
the assembling of the show, and only a
few finishing touches are needed.
The program contains a well-balanced
and varied group of numbers. The only
three long acts arc the monologues by
Marshall Kirby, and two skits, "The
Illusive Earl or the Vanishing Viscount,"
and "Helen Gone."
Another attractive feature of the pro
gram is a comedy musical number, with
A1 Cass, callcd "Why." The cast will
include Jack Meakin and Bill Worthing
ton, well-known campus musicians.
Staging of the show this year will be
greatly facilitated by the reccnt purchase
of new equipment. A set of new velvet
drapes will appear for the first time with
the Gaieties. The program has been so
|ilanned that there will be no delays be
tween the numbers.
