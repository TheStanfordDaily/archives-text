# Sophomore Meeting Date Changed to Next Tuesday
## 
### 
Sophomore Class meeting scheduled
for last night at 7 o'clock was called
off because of conflicting dates, and
will be held next Tuesday at 7 o'clock
in the Women's Clubhouse. The wo
men's hay ride made it impossible for
the sophomore women to attend the
meeting, while the Sequoia Club Wake
required the presence of many of the
sophomore men.
