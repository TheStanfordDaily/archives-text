WASHINGTON, Nov. 14.â€”T0 pro
duce 1,000',000,000 pieces of smaller
paper money by Octobcr 1928 is the
gigantic task now before the United
States Bureau of Printing and En
graving. Reducing the size of the
present paper bills twenty-five per
cent will result in a $2,000,000 annual
saving to Uncle Sam.
Twelve new bills can be produced
with the same amount of material as
is used for eight of the present size.
First steps toward production were
taken last week when Secretary Mel
lon approved the new engravings from
which the money will be struck.
