# BIG GAME FIRE WILL RECEIVE 800 GALLON PETROLEUM BAPTISM

As soon as 800 gallons of oil, donated
by the Peninsular Burner and Oil
Company to pour on the bonfire ar
rive this afternoon, the 1931 pyre will
be in readiness for tonight's crema
tion ceremonies, announced David S.
Johnson, Rally Committee member in
charge of bonfire construction, last
night. The oil, together with a flue
of ties extending all the way up the
middle of the structure, is expected
greatly to speed up the conflagration.
Although the stack has already
reached the height limit, several de
tails remain and a good number of
men will be needed during the day,
says Jacobson. But few freshmen
have been turning out during the past
few days.
