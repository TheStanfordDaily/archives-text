# CAM MELD COMBINATIONS MAY PROVE DOWNFALL OE CARDINALS; DODGERY, NEWMAN SENSATIONALISTS
## Blue and Gold Ball-Carriers Comprise Half of Bear Varsity Grid Squad BARR FAMED AS PUNTER Coach Price Will Depend on Benny Lom, Lee Eisan For Driving Power 
### Milton Silverman 
Pop Warner has slightly more than
fifty men on his varsity squad. Nibs
Price has about forty. Warner has
three, possibly four, backfield com
binations in good working order.
Price, so sport critics inform us, has
about a dozen or so.
If the California coach actually
had all these ball-carrying crews
without having some of the men play
ing on several combinations at the
same time, it would be remarkable.
Nevertheless there are enough backs,
with considerable ground-gaining pos
sibilities, on the Berkeley gridiron.
With Ralph Dougery, Cockburn,
and Schmidt available for fullback
work, and Breckenridge, Evans, and
Eisen for quarter, most of Nibs' wor
ries are over right there. For the
halfback positions he has Rice, New
man, Van Horn, Frank Gill, Clymer,
Marcus, Lane, Lom, Perrin, Barr,
Bruno, Ewing, and Von Tagen all
signed up on the program.
Out of the score of backfield men,
Benny Lom, triple-threat man, Lee
Eisen, sophomore quarter, and
"'Speed" Newman, who has not played
for Calif6rnia since 1923, are the most
sensational.
Jack Evans is the most experienced
•quarter on the squad, while Dougery
can be counted on for a good amount
of the line-smashing. Stan Barr broke
into the sport columns last week
when he more or less ran circles
around the Huskies for awhile. Not
only can he run, but he holds the
punting record for distance on the
squad.
Irv Marcus, a cousin of the afore
mentioned Lom, is generally con
sidered to be the most consistent
player on the team. "Dutch" Clymer
is all-around utility man on the squad,
and looks good at any position he
plays.
