## 
### 
Presenting the affirmative side of
the question, "Resolved, That the
Lower Division at Stanford and Cali
fornia be abolished," Philip Cavalero
and Cordon Shallenberger represent
ed Stanford againpt, the California
negative team at Berkeley last night.
The debate was a no-decision contest.
Main points made by the affirma
tive team were that the elementary
students would gain through personal
guidance and a more balanced cur
riculum, and that the more advanced
workers would gain through better re
search facilities.
Negative arguments brought out the
points that the university's broaden
ing influence cannot be replaced by a
junior college system, and that extra
curricular activities would disappear
in the universities.
Last night's debate was the second
forensic contest with U.C. on the
Lower Division question. Henry Har
ris and Leonard Kirkpatrick met the
Bear affirmative team here Monday.
