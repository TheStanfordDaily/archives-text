## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.—Action
has been started to make 11. M. Black
mer, oil man and friend of Harry F.
Sinclair, pay the price fixed by law—
$100,000 —for his refusal to return from
Paris and tell what he knows of the
inside of the Teapot Dome case.
A court order was issued today for
seizure of Blackmer's property to the
extent of $100,000 as provided tinder the
recent law forced through by Senator
Thomas F. Walsh of Montana, the origi
nal Teapot Dome investigator, to meet

the Blackiner case. This probably will be
arranged through a formal deposit of
$100,000 by Blackmer's attorney, Nathan
L. Miller, former governor of New York
and now counsel for the U.S. Steel Cor
poration.
