EVANSTON, 111., Nov. 16.—(1.P.)—
The Knights of the Checkbook, secret
order of fathers of Northwestern Uni
versity students, will be organized at
the reception which is the climax of
Dad's Day.
At the initiation ceremony the mem
bers solemnly swear "faithfully to
sign all checks that are necessary to
the well-being of my son or co-ed
while attending Northwestern, never
to speak harshly to him when his ac
count is overdrawn, and to come back
every year and give the place the
once over."
