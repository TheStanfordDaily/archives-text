# CARD SOCCER VARSITY PREPARES FOR FINAL CONTEST WITH BEARS
## 
### 
Varsity soccer men are having stiff j
workouts every afternoon this week j
to prepare for their final game with
the Bear varsity Saturday. Coach j
Maloney has been concentrating on I
the forwards to develop a strong scor
ing machine, in hopes of avenging the
last two defeats.
The Cardinals have showed power
in every game but have not played !
as a team. They have ability to take
the ball down the field and have a
strong defense, but lack men who can
shoot accurately. In the last game,
with California, which they lost 1-0, j
the varsity played a stand-off game
but were beaten by one long kick, j
which scored the lone tally.
Maloney is at a great disadvantage i
since he has only one month to whip
a team into shape to meet the Cali-!
fornia varsity which starts practice !
during August. However, the Bears
have won only ten games during the j
whole time of competition with Stan- j
ford.
