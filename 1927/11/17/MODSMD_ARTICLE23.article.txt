### 
No storm is in sight which can
reach Stanford by Saturday, an
nounces the Weather Bureau.

'Td like to tell you what the team
Is going to do, but I can't." Such was
Top Warner's word to 7000 Stanford
supporters last night at the annual
Big Game rally, after he had indulged
in considerable sarcasm at the ex
pense of the Cardinal varsity, which
he remarked had evidently been in a
"mood" to play against Santa Clara.
"The first fifteen minutes of the
Oregon Aggies game was the only
time I've seen them play football this
year," declared Pop, admitting that
they had shown flashes of real form
then.
In a brief talk that was the hit of
the rally, Dan Evans, former student
body president, set forth the propo
sition that "you can't make wildcats
any wilder," and that Captain Hal Mc-
Creery, eminent sign painter, was just
the man to lead in painting an Indian;
sign on the Golden Bear. He also sug
gested that "the blushing blonde in
the blue bodice" and his playmates
"observe the fine old Roman custom
of killing wild animals, in our arena
here Saturday."
Captain Hal McCreery, Trainer
Wallace Denny, who, for one, paid
the team a compliment, and Bob
Fraser, who outlined Saturday's
stunts, were the other speakers.
Miss Barn hart, featured by the
Brooks-Worthington orchestra, sang
four numbers that gained loud ap
plause from the rooting section pack
ing the Pavilion floor. Little Red Rid
ing Hood, Shylock,. the Calford coach,
and one of the Smith brothers pre
sented a touching skit pointing out
the moral that "the Golden Bear is
nothing but n cow."
Following the Pavilion program,
Murray Draper, student body presi
dent, touched off one of the best ocn
structed bonfires in Stanford history
at 8:27 o'clock, the flames requiring
scarce ten seconds to start licking
far above the pyre.
