# More Laughs Per Inch
## 
### 
lii a recent issue of the Vassar Miscellany Neivs was a summary of
the answers to a questionnaire sent out to the editors of forty college
publications. The questions chiefly concerned humorous or literary (it's
droll that there is such a distinction) magazines, and the answers, in the
main, were "surprisingly alike,"' as one unknown Vassar writer put it.
The News' interest in this subject was occasioned by the adoption of a
plan of having a single magazine on the Vassar campus.
The results of the questionnaire, however, are of interest to every
campus which supports one or more magazines. Answers showed that
literary magazines were almost universally regarded as being in a "tran
sitional state," as one editor aptly expressed it. Concerning "humorous"
magazines the answers indicated some doubt as to the worth of the
contents.
College publications in general can better themselves and benefit from
an analysis, perhaps somewhat more searching than that of the Vassar
Nczvs, and from results of investigations such as that of Dr. John C.
Almack as described recently in the Daily. Dr. Alrnack, professor of
education, could give many good tips to editors of college humor maga
zines. The results might mean more laughs per column inch.
