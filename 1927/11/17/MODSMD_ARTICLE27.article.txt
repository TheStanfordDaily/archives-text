# "Getting It Straight"

Skull and Snakes has brought to light the facts in regard to the
recent rumor that varsity athletes after the close of their training seasons
would be compelled to take regular gymnasium courses until the end of
the quarter. This rumor, like many others, is false.
The facts in the case are that at a meeting of Dr. Storey and the
coaches of the athletic teams, it was decided that it was desirable for
athletes to continue with some training in order that no harm might
result from a sudden cessation of training- However, the question of
whether or not a man may cease his training was left up to the coaches
to decide for the individual cases.
