It was nice to receive so much advertising at the women's assembly
yesterday morning. Phoenix-like, the Daily rises from the ashes to
assure the women that if they show by their vote on the question that they
desire to have an inter-living group competition schedule, it will make
every possible effort to have such a plan tried out on the Stanford
campus. The Daily thinks that a suitable plan could be worked out and
it hopes that a majority of the women have enough confidence in their
W.A.A. officers' ability to draw up such a plan. The Daily has such
confidence.
