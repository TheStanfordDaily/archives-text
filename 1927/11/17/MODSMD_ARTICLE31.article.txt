The Editor, Sir:
As useless as it may be to once more
call the winds of freedom doldrums in
sofar as they are of such a light, shifty,
and squallish nature as to prevent all
progress upon the limitless seas of
knowledge, I risk the contempt of the
authorities in the hope that repetition
will some day gain its goal. When ac
cused of unreasonable prejudices favor
ing the conservative plutocracy, as shown
by a one-sided curriculum, the authori
ties point with pride to the courses in
which students are encouraged to inde
pendent investigation. These are officially
known as seminar courses.
When the student comes to these
courses with the open mind created by
his antagonism to the views he has heard
expressed at home, his hopes are high
that at last he can judge for himself.
Hollow phrase, that. Self judgment of
important social and economic questions
is a mockery, because in order to judge
independently and impartially he must be
allowed to investigate both sides. This
is impossible because periodicals and
newspapers, to saj» nothing of books, are
in a few cases spasmodically received but
in no case preserved if they smack at all
of that dread poison known scientific
ally as communism, socialism, or radical
ism of any sort.
The young lady at the desk told me
that they happened to have a copy of the
weekly newspaper I needed, but it was
not considered an asset to the library to
save them, so I could get no back num
bers ; nor was she sure when the next
copy would arrive, there being conse
quently no way of reserving them to pre
vent their destruction.
Naturally the administration welcomes
investigation when it knows that the ma
terial will come only from sources iden
tified with capitalism and the "ins." By
providing the illusion of independent
judgment in the shape of a library the
plutocracy adds hordes to its already
legion supporters, and does itself far
more good than prohibiting investigation
would do. Obviously, investigation that
can't help being in their favor is better
than 110 investigation at all—for them.

The Editor, Sir:
It is unfortunate, I think, that you
consider the question of women's intra
mural sports one of "plaintiff" and "de
fendant." The tone of your editorial
gives a lamentable as well as erroneous
statement of the case. It would seem to
the reading public that Miss Bunting
came to the last board meeting with
seven objections numbered and tabulated,
and that the Board on the other hand
had seven good answers lined up for each
of her objections. I wish to have it un
derstood that there has always been the
most harmonious relationship and the best
possible co-operation between W.A.A.
and the Physical Education Department.
There has never been antagonism of any
kind, nor is there now, as your editorial
would have people believe. It was at my
request that Miss Bunting presented to
the Board the serious problems connected
with instituting intramural basketball. It
involves a complete change of policy, a
policy that brings with it the necessity
of looking at the question from the long

point of view. Will it be to the best j
interests of Stanford's women's athletics,
let ns say, five years hence?
In stating the "cons" of the case, Miss
Bunting was only bringing before the |
eyes of the Board the problems that
might arise from instituting an unorgan-;
ized sport founded only for "social con-1
tacts." In no one of her statements did
Miss Bunting say "it would do thus and
so." She said "it might work against the'
future good of W.A.A., and it might ruin!
interclass competition," and so on with \
all of the seven objections, thou;>h until i
I read your editorial 1 was not aware of j
the exact number.
Therefore 1 want you to know that j
W.A.A. objects to the tone of your edi
torial, not only because, it creates a false
atmosphere and gives an antagonistic
slant that does not exist, but also because
it is not true. There is no "case," there
is no "jury"; it is merely a question we
are discussing with an attentive ear to
both its good and bad points. Miss Bunt
ing and the Board are working out a
tentative intramural program, remember
ing that it has failed in a good many
colleges and that it might not be for the
good 6f women's athletics at Stanford
were it installed here for winter quarter.
The "case" is by no means "rested," nor
is the judgment of W.A.A. awaiting the i
decision of any "jury."

President of W.A.A.

Dear Little Sally:
I read your column every day. I mean
I read it every day that you write it.
The other day I read something of yours
about traditions and the bonfire. Now,
Sally, I really think you arc mean.
I am a poor Frosh who has stayed
awake over a smoky fire all night on
guard duty and have just as many blisters
on my hands as these cute little sophs
got last year. Merely because we are
putting our efforts towards stability in
stead of stacking empty boxes on top of
each other, it isn't a bit nice of you to
think we are shirking on the job. And
really, Sally, this fire is going to have
more wood in it than those of previous
years even if it won't be as high. A
senior with corduroy breeches and high
laced boots told me so, so I know it is
true. So please don't get discouraged,
little Sally, as we will build a humdinger
of a pyre.
And, Sail} - —my hair isn't curly, but I
have rosy cheeks. Do Stanford girls like
little boys with rosy cheeks?
JUST A NICE BOY.
The Editor, Sir :
I would like to offer as an explanation
for Saturday's catastrophe that eating at
a training table in the Union will tell.
Those of us not fortunate enough to en
joy life in the more select pensions on
the campus, or without an automobile,
sometimes arc forced to eat at Miss
Handy's. Despite the sanitary conditions

iof the Union (see Daily's whitewash of
the Union last year) the food is awful.
| Its preparation and menu make us appre-i
1 ciate even the City Cafe.
j If those ardent supporters of the pres
ent campus cuisine will look at facts, I
I think I can convince them of this. Last
] year Morey opened a coffee shop, this
j year an addition. The patrons are en
| tirely students. And is business good?
I During the past year four tea-rooms have
! opetied in Paly depending principally on
| campus trade. And Sequoia, student man
aged, serves food very superior to that
! of either the Union or Encina and is
j well patronized. (This despite the noise).
| More: we ask any sincere admirer of
ice cream whether the chalky flakes
laughingly called by the Union soda
jerkers "vanilla ice cream," resembles
anything he has ever before eaten.
Any Socialist-in-the-making should see
the Stanford Union in operation before
further supporting business management
from above without any competition. It
•is rumored that Mr. Hoover is largely
| responsible for the existing regime. If
i this is true, we hope as a punishment he
may be made to eat at the cafeteria for
a month. Sincerely,
C. F. R.
