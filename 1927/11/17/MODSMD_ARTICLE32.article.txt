I
Dean M. It. Kirlcwood of the Law !
'
School will speak before the organiz- 1
ing session of the newly created Cali- j
fornia State Bar tomorrow night in
| the San Francisco Native Sons Hall. ;
Dean Kirkwood will discuss the "Edu
cational Requirements for Admission
! to the Bar."
, The new State Bar is a public cor-1
poration which was established by j
' the last state legislature. It is com
pulsory that every lawyer in Cali
fornia must have membership in this
| organization before he may practice
his profession. There has been a
| similar organization previous to this !
i time but now it has been put under
i state supervision.
"The attorneys are all behind the
movement," states Kirkwood, "as is
evidenced by the fact that in the !
! coming elections of a Board of Gov- j
i ernors,, 95 per cent of the 8000 Cali- i
fornia lawyers have signified their in- :
tention of voting."
