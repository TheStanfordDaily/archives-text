# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Don't be afraid, children —this is ,
not the naughty "Kinkachoo," nor is j
it a hob-goblin left over from Hal- I
lowe'en. It is merely Mr. "Brick" Mar
cus, a mild-mannered young halfback
who occasionally presents the calling
card of his university, California, be
hind the goal posts of some rival
team. Mr. Marcus is about as short- i
sighted as a mole, or a bat, and so, J
to enable him to catch the elusive I
pigskin and dodge the arms of would- J
be tacklers, wears glasses while play- ;
ing football, and this trick headguard i
was manufactured solely for the pur- j
pose of protecting Mr. Marcus' |
"cheaters" from the wear and tear I
one usually meets with in the ordi- |
nary course of a game - of football.
I have seen Mr. Marcus play, and i
he plays a dandy game. He is a fast, ]
elusive runner and a mean tackier, j
but sad to relate, he did not wear
his funny-looking headguard and
blinkers combined, and I was in- i
formed that he only dons it when the j
shades of night are falling fast and •
the low visibility makes it almost im- j
possible for him to see.
A football player with glasses! And
why not? "Brick" isn't the first one !

in history. Carl Wolfe, a star halfback
at Rutgers, wore spectacles in action
on the gridiron, as did a Columbia
player whose name was Fisher, un
less memory fails me. Both men wore
specially prepared guards, of course.
Marcus, had his leg broken in the
University of Southern California
game in 1926; otherwise, California
might have done a little better
against Stanford in their annual con
test later on in the season. These
two traditional rivals meet Saturday
in the stadium at Palo Alto, and per
haps it will be Brick's turn to shine,
and maybe the "Masked Marvel" will
not only get his chance, but, with the
sun's rays magnified by his lenses,
literally "burn up the gridiron!"

in history. Carl Wolfe, a star halfback
at Rutgers, wore spectacles in action
on the gridiron, as did a Columbia
player whose name was Fisher, un
less memory fails me. Both men wore
specially prepared guards, of course.
Marcus, had his leg broken in the
University of Southern California
game in 1926; otherwise, California
might have done a little better
against Stanford in their annual con
test later on in the season. These
two traditional rivals meet Saturday
in the stadium at Palo Alto, and per
haps it will be Brick's turn to shine,
and maybe the "Masked Marvel" will
not only get his chance, but, with the
sun's rays magnified by his lenses,
literally "burn up the gridiron!"
