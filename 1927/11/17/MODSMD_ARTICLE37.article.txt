NEW YORK, Nov. 16.â€”Moer than a
thousand shiny new Hudson, Chrysler,
and Auburn automobiles were reduced to
clinkers of molten metal today when lire
destroyed the warehouse in which they
were stored in one of the most populous
districts of uptown Manhattan.
Before firemen succeeded in bringing
it under control late in the afternoon, the
fire had gutted the four story building
which occupied a block of land near the
Hudson river front.
Owners of the warehouse and agents
of firms who had stored their automobiles
there estimated the loss at three million
dollars.
The University of Redlands is
building a new gymnasium which will
be one of the finest on the Pacific
Coast.
