# Warning Against Use of Bayshore Highway Sent
## 
### 
Recommendation against use by
motorists of the new Daysliore High
way from South San Francisco to
Broadway, Burlingame, during and
alter heavy rains, was issued recent
ly by the Touring Bureau of the
California State Automobile Associa
tion. The past several days of rain
have made tlio ungraded surface of
the newly constructed road extremely
muddy, according to George S. Grant,
manager of the Association Touring
Bureau, and it is not practical to drive
over it until a period of sunny weath
er follows the rains. This situation
will hold throughout the winter after
wet weather.
