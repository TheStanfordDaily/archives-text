# STANFORD SONGS
## 
### 
"Hail Alma Mater" is the song re
commended by the Rally Committee
to be sung in all living groups tonight.
The keynote is dignity rather than
speed, and the notes of "Hail" should
be held.
HAIL ALMA MATER
(Key in G â€”Starting note E)
Hail! Hail! Hail! Alma Mater, Hail!
Stanford Hail!
Thy fame shall e'er prevail.
Thy sons thy glory shall acclaim,
And ever honor thy fair name.
So, Hail! Hail! Hail!
Alma Mater, Hail!
Hail! Hail! Hail! Alma Mater, Hail!
Stanford Hail!
Thy fame shall e'er prevail.
With hearts that ever true shall be,
We pledge our love anew to thee,
So, Hail! Hail! Hail!
Alma Mater, Hail!
