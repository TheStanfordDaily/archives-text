Think what it means to paint
a lamp, vase, chair or table and
use it within thirty minutes!
Nitrokote Enamel dries in that
short time.
This new-day lacquer is
satin-smooth and amazingly
durable. It won't show mars or
scratches and resists grease,
gasoline and hot soapsuds. Buy
a can from your Fuller dealer
and ask for a descriptive color
card. He stocks ten attractive
colors.
