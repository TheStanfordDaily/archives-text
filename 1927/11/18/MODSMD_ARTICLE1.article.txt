# RAM'S HEAD PLAYERS OFFER 'BIG GAME GAIETIES' TONIGHT
## Revue Features Chorus Of Thirteen Women; Star Campus Dramatists Are On Cast; Vim, Vigor, Vitality Promised 
### HALLIE KEATING 
RAM'S HEAD all-star varsity will kick-oft" promptly at 8:15 o'clock tliis
evening in the third annual "Big Game Gaieties." With sixteen of the
most beautiful women on the campus, and a cast numbering eighteen popular
dramatic figures, the program promises to be full of vim, vigor, and vitality.
Although this show is in the nature of a coming-out party on the Stanford
stage for several of the featured artists, the old grads in the audience will
find many familiar stars from past years on the program. Billy Worthington,
Jack Meakin, A 1 Cass, and Greg Williamson need no introduction.
Kathleen Fitz, Sarah Margaret Burns, and Dorothy Gamier will readily be
remembered for their work in revues and dramatic performances in the
past year. The fact that Frances Boone is chorus director this year is in

itself a recommendation for the show/
Les Kiler has designed some un
usual skits and novelty back drops
that promise to be sensational. The
new set of drapes which will facili
tate quick change of sets is another
welcome addition. The monologues by
Marshall Kirby, the mystery skit of
"The Elusive Earl," with the comedy
trio from last year's junior opera, Hal
Boomer, Kenneth Lloyd, and Paul
Speegle, are a few more of the at
tractions on this year's menu.
Duncan Directs Songs
Ted Duncan, as musical leader, has
an interesting and good group of
original campus songs under his di
rection. This will be the first campus
appearance of Larry Staley, who will
be featured with banjo solos, and in
musical skits with his own lyrics. The
"Melody Butchers," a quartette that
has heretofore limited itself to sere
nades, will also be seen for the first
time in the limelight.
Several good before-curtain inter
mission acts are scheduled, with Link
Malmquist, Don Marquis, and Royal
Chapman in unique clog dances. The
chorus will be featured in a clog
dance which also is another innova
tion in campus choruses.
All in all, the show promises to
carry out the plan Ram's Head de
cided to undertake at the beginning
of the tryouts for the performance,
to wit: a revue, with emphasis on
short, clever numbers, rather than
upon a program of four or five long
acts. Prospects look well for an ap
propriate pre-game vaudeville.
