# BULLDOG IS FAVORED TO DOWN HARVARD IN EAST'S GRID CLASSIC
## 
### 
Harvard and Yale meet tomorrow in
the Big Game of eastern gridiron com
jjetition.
The classic is annually a time for the
underdog to come through and upset the
overconfident opponent. Although the
Crimson was beaten by Purdue, Dart
mouth and Pennsylvania, Harvard keeps
faith in Coach Horwecn's ability to pull
it out of a slump. The season was start
ed with excellent material, but it failed
to materialize; one week they looked
good and the following they could not
do a thing.
Yale has had a successful season, de
feating Army, Dartmouth, and Prince
ton. Old Eli will suffer a relapse after
the struggle with Princeton last week.
Horbcn and Captain Webster may not be
able to play on account of injuries suf
fered against the Tigers.
Although Yale is conceded a much

greater cliance of running off with a fat
victory, the Yale-Harvard game has
never been doped successfully before the
final whistle. Upsets have become the
rule in games this season; an upset in
the classic is even more possible.
