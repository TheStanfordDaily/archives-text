# BROWN TEAM PROVES BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
## 
### 
One of the season's football mysteries
is the Brown University team.
Dubbed the "Iron Men" last year be
cause they played through a number of
crucial games without a substitution, nine
of the eleven stars who carried Brown
through 1926 undefeated returned this
year and it was thought that they would
have another powerful team. Yet Brown
collapsed in its first big game, proving
a big disappointment.
There have been many reasons ad
vanced ; one being that last year they had
no hard games until they were well along
in the scasodn whereas this year they
tackled Pennsylvania early in the year;
another is the loss of Broda, All-Amcri
can end.
