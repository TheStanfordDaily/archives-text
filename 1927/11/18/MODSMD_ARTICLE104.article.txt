## 
### 
'If we can play our men lor only two
years instead of for three, as at present,
I see our finish under the Junior College
plan, which would eliminate our lower
division altogether," said Alfred R. Mas
ters, General Manager of the Board of
Athletic Control.
"It all depends on what the Confer
ence would do. 1 don't think the Con
ference would want to kill our standing.
Some plan would be worked out that
would make it possible for us to com
pete. We're just as necessary to the other j
members of the Conference as they are
to us," he continued.
Professor W. B. Owens, to whom
Masters referred as one who would he
particularly interested in Stanford's fu
ture athletic stataus, is the faculty repre
sentative from Stanford to the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Athletic Confer
ence, which holds its next semi-annual
meeting next month.
According to Professor Owens, there
has been no formal discussion of a tenta
tive competitive position to be assumed
by Stanford should be curricula of the
first two years be removed. However,
there lias been informal discussions
among the several members of the Con
ference at past conventions.
Two plans that might be tried would
be either to make it possible for Stanford
men to play during two upper division
years and one graduate year, or else to
have only the juniors and seniors at
other universities play the Stanford team,
while the sophomores and freshmen at
those other institutions would play only
with junior colleges.
