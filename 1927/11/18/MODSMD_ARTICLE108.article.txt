# PROFESSIONAL GRID TEAMS LACK SPIRIT CLAIMS C.W. DAVIS
## 
### 
"The spri of the tiling is entirely
changed," said Charles W. Davis, Direc
tor of Intramural Athletics, when asked
his opinion of professional football as
compared with the college game. "I don't
think much of the professional game,"
he added.
"Practically all of the polish is taken
oil the game when it is played by pro
fessionals," Davis continued.
"For instance, a man playing tackle on
one side of the line does not do much
work if the play is going through tin
other side. He takes it as easy as he can. I
'
1 remember once when Grange's team!
had just put over a touchdown, they did
not feel at all elated. They just went
through the motions listlessly. It was just
a touchdown, that was all; it was a part
of their work to get touchdowns. The
spirit that you sec at college games was !
lacking. No one becomes jubilant over
the scores that professionals make as a !
part of their day's work. Always the
players are thinking only of themselves.
1 hey try to figure how they're going to;
get by with the minimum chance of per
sonal injury."
