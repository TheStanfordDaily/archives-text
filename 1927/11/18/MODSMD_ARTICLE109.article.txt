WALDO WEETH, formerly on the Cal Aggies, is
holding down a regular guard position. Injuries have
kept him out of the game for some time, but he will be
in the line-up.
JIM DOUGERY, not as famous as his brother Ralph,
is nevertheless having a lot of fun on one of the end
berths. Specializing in pass-receiving, he will probably
see action tomorrow.
ROY REIGELS, sophomore Bear center, is probably
the nerviest man between end and end on the California
line. In spite of keen competition he has managed to
grab and hold a first-string berth.

Once a year the sports writers say that DICK HYLAND is through. Tomorrow he plays for the
last time against California, and is expected to run riot once again over the hopes of the Blue and
Gold. Hyland is the most colorful player on either team, and whether he scores or not, he will give the
87,000 spectators enough thrills for their money.


BENNY LOM
first got acquainted
with Stanford in
the Little Big Game
last year when he
raised havoc with
the Cardinal babes.
Now he is one of
Price's most sensa
tional triple-threat
men, and will be the
source of much
worry to the Red
shirts. If he gets
away in an open
field, Stanford will
just be out of luck.


ROLAND "SELLMAN and
CHRIS FREEMAN are Pop's
choices to start at the tackle
posts against California.
