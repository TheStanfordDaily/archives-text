# GRIDIRON TRAINING IS HELD MORE USEFUL THAN BOOKS
## 
### Gunnar Norberg 
"To my mind the education, if you
please, or the training that a man
gets out of football is worth more to
him in later life than most of the
books he studies at college. I'm a
strong booster for football!"
Paul Downing, '95, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association and vice
president in charge of electrical con
struction and operation of the Pacific
Gas and Electric Company, was speak
ing. He had been asked what effect
he thinks football has in shaping the
career of the one who has played the
game before being graduated from
college. Downing was captain of Stan
ford's grid team In 1894. Sitting be
hind a large desk in his spacious, well
ordered office on the thirteenth floor
of the P. G. and E. building in San
Francisco, he spoke about football as
it has affected him and as it affects
others, and also about the present
Cardinal grid team and its chances in
tomorrow's Big Game.

| "A man's pride and his loyalty to
' his college will cause him to put forth
I his best efforts in order to make the
I team and to stay on the team. His
| desire to make the team will cause
him to stand up under a lot of punish
j ment and survive the hardest knocks.
1 If a fellow has any yellow streak in
him, he gets it knocked out of him
pretty quick! He learns to take the
knocks at iirst, but he figures how he
will be able to give them instead of
! take them the next time.
"After a man gets out of college
and into the game of life, he realizes
that the game of life, itself, is just as
competitive as the one of football
he played while he was an under
| graduate.
Diploma No Asset
"College men often think it's easy
to get a job, to hold it, and to get
to the top, when they are trying to
I establish themselves after gradua-
I tion, but it'B not easy. They've got to
Jearn that a college diploma doesn't
put them ahead of everybody else
who hasn't one, that they can't get
ahead on their college reputations.
They've got to produce, or they won't
niako first down or get to first base!
They've got to keep on coming back
alter every setback. Football is the
only sport that gives a man the "guts"
to come back all the time.
"A man, coming out of college,
ought not to get the idea that he has
the right-of-way. There is only one
"way to succeed: don't feel that you're
"way above everybody, and be good
and willing to learn from those who
liave never gone to college.
Inherent Ability Needed
"As Dr. Jordan has said, you can't
j)ut a hundred dollar education into a
fifteen-cent boy. Unless a fellow has
Ability to use his head, has what we
call horse-sense, and is a good, clear
thinker, he can't succeed, whether he
lias a college education or he Hasn't.
/U'ter all college is only a foundation
on which the graduate will build, as
iiest he can, the rest of his life."

Ability to use his head, has what we
call horse-sense, and is a good, clear
thinker, he can't succeed, whether he
lias a college education or he Hasn't.

on which the graduate will build, as

"To my mind the education, if you
please, or the training that a man
gets out of football is worth more to
him in later life than most of the
books he studies at college. I'm a
strong booster for football!"
Paul Downing, '95, president of the
Stanford Alumni Association and vice
president in charge of electrical con
struction and operation of the Pacific
Gas and Electric Company, was speak
ing. He had been asked what effect
he thinks football has in shaping the
career of the one who has played the
game before being graduated from
college. Downing was captain of Stan
ford's grid team In 1894. Sitting be
hind a large desk in his spacious, well
ordered office on the thirteenth floor
of the P. G. and E. building in San
Francisco, he spoke about football as
it has affected him and as it affects
others, and also about the present
Cardinal grid team and its chances in
tomorrow's Big Game.

| "A man's pride and his loyalty to
' his college will cause him to put forth
I his best efforts in order to make the
I team and to stay on the team. His

him to stand up under a lot of punish
j ment and survive the hardest knocks.
1 If a fellow has any yellow streak in
him, he gets it knocked out of him
pretty quick! He learns to take the
knocks at iirst, but he figures how he
will be able to give them instead of
! take them the next time.
"After a man gets out of college
and into the game of life, he realizes
that the game of life, itself, is just as
competitive as the one of football
he played while he was an under

Diploma No Asset
"College men often think it's easy

to the top, when they are trying to
I establish themselves after gradua-

Jearn that a college diploma doesn't
put them ahead of everybody else
who hasn't one, that they can't get
ahead on their college reputations.
They've got to produce, or they won't
niako first down or get to first base!
