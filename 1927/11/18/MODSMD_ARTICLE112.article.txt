# WARNER'S RECIPE FOR TEAMS-WORK, PLAYS, PLENTY SCRIMMAGE
## 
### 
Rumor has it that there is a magician
on the Stanford campus, that Pop War
ner has considerable in common with the
late Houdini, and that tliis same Mr.
Warner holds the sacred secret of some
mysterious formula for producing foot
ball teams.
Last Saturday, however, it wasn't dif
ficult to find those who were emphatic in
saying that some of the equations in the
"Old Fox's" formula became twisted in
the shuffle.
Be that as it may, the fact still remains
that Warner over a period of years has
set records in college gridiron history,
and has then broken them. His name has
been firmly established as one of the
deans of the great American game.
But the dark, sequestered mystery has
been bared at last. Warner's recipe for a
good team is simply like that of practic
ally all other mentors. Plenty of scrim
mage, lots of work, and lots more good
plays are his ideas on the requisites of a
powerful eleven.
He employs the tapering off process
with variations. At the first of the season
a Warner team works and scrimmages,
then works and scrimmages some more.
When the outfit has become thoroughly
hardened, the menu is slimmed down, but
only to a certain point, for early in each
week the squad goes back to the good
old working and scrimmaging. Then as
Saturday and a game come near, easier
workouts are given.
Warner has no freak training stunts.
His players are put through essentially
the same schedule as are those of his
rival coaches. The difference, it seems
then, must comc somewhere else. In the
plays, in the man's personality, or in the
fighting spirit he instills in his players.
Maybe all three.
