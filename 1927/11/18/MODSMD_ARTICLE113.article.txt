Three pairs of microphones located
around the stadium will convey the noise!
that 87,000 people are making. One set !
will be placed in front of the California
rooting section and another one will get,
the Stanford yells from the Cardinal,
side. The third one will be placed at the
end of the bowl.
Operators underneath the stadium will
regulate the power so that the noise of
the howling fans will not drown out Jack
Keough's description. Everything is be
ing done to make the word picture more
realistic. Between halves the rooting
scction stunts of the two universities will
be described. Besides the announcer, a
technical stafT of seven men will be kept
busy in tending to the equipment and
supervising the work, while scores will
handle the news from the publication
angle.
