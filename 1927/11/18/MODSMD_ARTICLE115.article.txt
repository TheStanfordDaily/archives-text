FRANKIE WILTON hasn't been so very far behind
his shifty colleague, Dick Hyland, in the matter of open
field running this season. He wrecked things for the Ore
gon Aggies a few weeks ago, and shows every indication of
doing a little dirty work against the Bears tomorrow. He'll
probably provide the elusive threat for Pop's eleven next
year as he'll be eligible for another season.
