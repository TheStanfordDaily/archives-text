# BRANDSTEN INVENTION ACCEPTED OFFICIALLY FOR OLYMPIC GAMES
## 
### 
"The International and Intercollegiate
Regulation Diving Board" invented by
Coach Ernst Brandsten in 1912 has been
accepted again as the official and only,
board for the Olympic Games this com- j
ing summer according to word received
from Amsterdam. This board is now ac-l
cepted and authorized the world over.
G. Van Rossen of the Holland Olym
pic Committee explains in a letter that, j
as in 1912, 1920, and 1924, it "will be!
official Olympic equipment in 1928 be-1
cause of its universally proven capacity I
for giving the best results."
The fact that an order is to be filed j
for the boards is a high compliment to
the Stanford swimming coach, as the I
Olympic Committee has full right to use
his design and manufacture them in Hol
land.
Brandsten's diving board has two
unique features. The fulcrum is readily
adjustable to front and rear, and the
board itself is tapered from the base to
the takeoff. The adjustable fulcrum per- j
mits the modification necessary for a re
placed board, which never has the same
elasticity as the former one. Tapering
gives a good spring. The whole is so ar
ranged that a new board may be installed
in a few minutes.
