# CARDINAL SWIMMING, DIVING TEAM STRONG, DECLARES BRANDSTEN
## Freshmen Weaker Than Last Year But Should Make Good Showing 
### 
"Our varsity swimming and diving
team is probably the most powerful
in collegiate circles of the United
States," comes the encouraging state
ment from Coacli Ernst Brandsten.
"And the freshman line-up, though
not as good as last year's, is very
fair." The truth of these statements,
coupled with the fact that one of the
National Championship meets is al
most certain to be held in San Fran
cisco, foreshadows a banner year for
Stanford mermen.
Harrison has made the 50-yard
sprint in less than : 24, and the 100 in
5G flat, with Van den Akker not more
than a split second behind. Bramel
does the 220-yard free-style in 2:26,
and the 440 in"5:32. Driggs is close
to Bramel in these races, and Kinkead
has done the last mentioned trial in
5:50.
"All these times made by our men
are worth notice," says Brandsten.
"They were made in Encina Pool,
which is what we call a long course,
and such records would furnish stiff
competition in any pool."
Backstroke Improving
The backstroke department was
Brandsten's chief worry the first of
the quarter, but Driggs, Jessop, and
Penfield have all made 1:15. The
outlook is brighter now, however, and
"as the men are new, I predict that
later in the season they will swim it
in 1:10, which will win anything."
Ted Smith, who will graduate in Janu
ary, turns the back race in 1:10 and
1:09 with ease.
"Mills and Throndson are going
very well in diving, and both are high
class performers on the board," Brand
sten stated. "For the relay we have
Harrison, Van den Akker, Bramel,
Morey, Colin Smith, and Harris."
Babe Team Powerful
The freshmen have Lucy and
Thomas in the sprints. The former
has reeled off the 50-yard race in :2G
and the 10*0 in one minute flat. There
is Moffat in the 220, and Scott and
Brown in the 440. In the breaststroke
there are Roberts, Saunder, and
Burns; the latter has made 1:16 in the
Encina tank. Smith and Brown are
the backstroke swimmers.
Desjardins, national diving cham
pion, needs no introduction, but Marsh
and Price are two first year divers of
interest. Lucy, Smith, Thomas, Moffat,
Desjardins, and Brown make up the
relay team.
Schedule is Completed
The varsity schedule has been fully
worked out yet," stated Manager
Dixon Smith. "Stanford will play
California in water polo on February
25, here, and will meet them in a
swimming meet at Athens Club on
March 10. From January to March
there will be various P.A.A. champion
ship matches along the coast. We
will have dual matches with U. S. C.,
U. C. L. A., and Hollywood, and we
will enter a water carnival of south
ern schools at Los Angeles, probably
in the U. S. C. tank, on March 30 and
31."

Brown in the 440. In the breaststroke
there are Roberts, Saunder, and
Burns; the latter has made 1:16 in the
Encina tank. Smith and Brown are
the backstroke swimmers.
Desjardins, national diving cham
pion, needs no introduction, but Marsh
and Price are two first year divers of
interest. Lucy, Smith, Thomas, Moffat,
Desjardins, and Brown make up the
relay team.
Schedule is Completed
The varsity schedule has been fully
worked out yet," stated Manager
Dixon Smith. "Stanford will play
California in water polo on February
25, here, and will meet them in a
swimming meet at Athens Club on
March 10. From January to March
there will be various P.A.A. champion
ship matches along the coast. We
will have dual matches with U. S. C.,
U. C. L. A., and Hollywood, and we
will enter a water carnival of south
ern schools at Los Angeles, probably
in the U. S. C. tank, on March 30 and
31."
"Our varsity swimming and diving
team is probably the most powerful
in collegiate circles of the United
States," comes the encouraging state
ment from Coacli Ernst Brandsten.
"And the freshman line-up, though
not as good as last year's, is very
fair." The truth of these statements,
coupled with the fact that one of the
National Championship meets is al
most certain to be held in San Fran
cisco, foreshadows a banner year for
Stanford mermen.
Harrison has made the 50-yard
sprint in less than : 24, and the 100 in
5G flat, with Van den Akker not more
than a split second behind. Bramel
does the 220-yard free-style in 2:26,
and the 440 in"5:32. Driggs is close
to Bramel in these races, and Kinkead
has done the last mentioned trial in
5:50.
"All these times made by our men
are worth notice," says Brandsten.
"They were made in Encina Pool,
which is what we call a long course,
and such records would furnish stiff
competition in any pool."
Backstroke Improving
The backstroke department was
Brandsten's chief worry the first of
the quarter, but Driggs, Jessop, and
Penfield have all made 1:15. The
outlook is brighter now, however, and
"as the men are new, I predict that
later in the season they will swim it
in 1:10, which will win anything."
Ted Smith, who will graduate in Janu
ary, turns the back race in 1:10 and
1:09 with ease.
"Mills and Throndson are going
very well in diving, and both are high
class performers on the board," Brand
sten stated. "For the relay we have
Harrison, Van den Akker, Bramel,
Morey, Colin Smith, and Harris."
Babe Team Powerful
The freshmen have Lucy and
Thomas in the sprints. The former
has reeled off the 50-yard race in :2G
and the 10*0 in one minute flat. There
is Moffat in the 220, and Scott and
Brown in the 440. In the breaststroke
there are Roberts, Saunder, and
Burns; the latter has made 1:16 in the
Encina tank. Smith and Brown are
the backstroke swimmers.
