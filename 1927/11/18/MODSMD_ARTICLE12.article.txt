hall game to he played at the Rose
Bowl in Pasadena on New Year's
Day," Don Liehendorfer, head of the
Stanford athletic news service, ad

been specifically mentioned," he said,
"but it has been indicated that either
Washington and Jefferson, or Pitts
burgh University, once coached by
Pop Warner, will be invited to repre
sent the East."
According to Liehendorfer, the ad
visability of accepting the invitation
to play a post-season game was put to
the Stanford team and favorably
voted upon. It now remains for the
Board of Athletic Control officially to
sanction Stanford's acceptance when
it meets next Monday to take action
on the invitation.
"The Board has not deferred action
until Monday to consider the result
of the game tomorrow! The terms of
the invitation are to the effect that
the result of the Big Game will have
nothing to do with it. The invitation
will stand, regardless," Liehendorfer
says.
