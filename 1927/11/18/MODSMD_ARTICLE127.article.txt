# ADDITION TO GYM IS UNIT OF PROJECTED CONSTRUCTION PLAN
## 
### 
With the removal of all athletic ad
ministrative offices from Encina Gym
nasium to their new quarters in Stan
ford's recently constructed $102,000
building, the last step has been taken in
making the physical education plant here
comparative to any similar unit in the
country.
Space in the new structure has been
utilized by the general manager, the di
rectors, the medical staff, and the various
coaches. Formerly these men had their
desks in the gymnasium proper, and the
recent change provides additional room
in that building.
The cost of the building was met large

!!y with revenue from football. A debt
I still remains, however, on the offices, the
| stadium, and Brainier Hall of $560,000.
Until this sum is paid additional con
struction will go slowly. But plans for
the future include a new swimming pool,
additional gymnasium space, and the
completion of the Physical Education
Quadrangle, which will be made up of
Encina Gym, the new office building, the
Basketball Pavilion, and the new portions
of the plant which are yet to he built.
