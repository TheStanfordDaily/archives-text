# MOST PACIFIC COAST COLLEGES HAVE NEW FOOTBALL DIRECTORS
## Erb Is Latest Acquisition; Jones at U.S.C. Shows Most Success 
### 
One distinguishing characteristic of
the Pacific Coast gridiron mentors
taken as a group is that they are
either very new men in the game of
coaching or have been at their re
spective universities only a compara
tively short time. Yet out of new and
green material, they have developed
teams which can cope with the best
In the country.
While Coach Charles Erb of Idaho
is the only real example of a new man
at coaching, Coach liabe Hollings
berry of W. S. C. haa been at his first
JÂ»ig coaching job only two years. Erb
played for three years at quarter on
the California Wonder Teams of '20,
'21, and '22. He was chosen captain
at California and All-Coast quarter in
his last year, but these were the only
qualifications he had to land a berth
at Idaho last year. However, in this
brief time he has brought Idaho into
the running for conference honors,
the Vandals being one of the three
undefeated teams in the conference
this season.
Hollingsberry at W. S. C.
Before Hollingsberry went to W.S.C.,
he ceached at the Lick-Wilmerding
High School in San Francisco, and also
sit the Olympic Club. On reaching
Pullman in the fall of 1926, he found
xnen in the Cougar camp who were
iar from inexperienced in the gentle
nrt of handling the pigskin. Out of
such stuff as "Butch" Meeker he de
veloped a strong, powerful aggregation-
However, with practically the same
material this year he has not made
such an impressive showing.
Neither Coach Paul Schissler of
O. S. C., Coach John McEwan of Ore
gon, nor Coach Howard Jones of U.S.C.
lias been at his present job more than
four years. Schissler in his college
days played football for the powerful
Nebraska Cornhuskers. Then for four
years he enjoyed wonderful success
sis head coach at Lombard College in
Illinois. It was only a small college
but he produced exceptional teams.
Since he has been at O. S. C., his
teams have always been up in the
conference rating, but in the last few
years it has been a peculiarity of
Aggies to play brilliant football during
the first half of the season and then
suddenly to go stale.
McEwan is Ail-American
McEwan who is now in his third
year as coach at Oregon, was chosen
Ail-American center while playing
for West Point. Later he was made
head coach of the Army gridsters,
and though he was not especially
successful, remained three years. In
the fall of 1925 he resigned from the
army and accepted the Oregon job.
Though he has not produced a cham
pionship team at Oregon he has al
ways managed to put a well balanced,
lighting combination on the field.
Jones, considering the short time he
has been at U. S. C., has probably
been more successful than any other
coach. He went there in 1925 and
with good material he lias developed
three powerful teams. Kaer and Drury,
two of the four greatest players that
the coast has ever had, came into
their own under Jones' tutelage. Jones
started his career by playing end on
one of the strongest teams Yale ever
had. He then became head coach at
the University of lowa, where he pro
duced Big Ten conference champion
ship teams in '21 and '22. Just before
taking over the Trojans, Jones coach
taking over the Trojans, Jones coached
a year at Duke University in North
Carolina.
Bagshaw Teams Strong
Of the Pacific Coast coaches, ex
cluding Pop Warner of Stanford and
Nibs Price of California, Enoch Bag
shaw of Washington and Ott Romney
of Montana have served their respec
tive institutions the longest time, each
coaching there seven years. Bagshaw

in his early days as a coach produced
three National Interscholastic cham
pionship teams at Everett. When he
went to Washington he took such
men as Wilson, Guttormsen, and the
Tesreaus of his Everett teams with
him. As a result the Huskies have
always been a close contestant for
the conference championship, winning
it in 1925. This year Bagshaw is con
tinuing his good work and has a team
that has swept everything before it
except Stanford.
Romney while attending the Uni
versity of Utah was a star performer
in the grid game. Later he was coach
of the East High School team at Salt
Lake for several years and put out
one state championship team after
another. He has not had any success
at Montana but he developed "Wild
Bill" Kelly, mentioned for All-Ameri
can quarter last year. The failure to
produce an exceptional team can not
be blamed entirely on Romney for
according to an authority in con
ference football circles Montana is
considered the "graveyard for
coaches."
