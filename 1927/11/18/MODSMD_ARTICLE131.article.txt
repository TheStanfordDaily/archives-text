READING left to right are DON HILL, SPUD LEWIS, BIFF HOFFMAN, and DICK HYLAND, regular Cardinal
backfield four, who will probably see action together against the Golden Bears. Although Murphy may start at quarter, Lewis
is almost certain of a chance to call signals. Hill and Hyland are playing their last game for Stanford, unless future arrange
ments are made for a post-season game. Hoffman has one more year of football, and is expected to be the greatest fullback

most dangerous open-field runner in the West, while Hill has won for himself the title of the most consistent ball-carrier
on the team.
