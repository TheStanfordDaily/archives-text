# BABE FOOTBALL MEN MAKE STRONG FINISH BY DEFEATING BEARS
## Yearlings Have Poor Start; Lose Three Games; Tie One, Lose One 
### Bob Speers 
Stanford's freshman football season
started this year with loud groans and
much head shaking. It ended with a vie- j
tory over California's yearlings in one |
of the most startling upsets in Cardinal J
gridiron history.
Looking at the Babes' early record
from any angle, one gets a gloomy view.
Up to the Litle Big Game they had met
five teams, and had received a beating
from three of them. They were tied once,
and victorious once.
U.S.C. Scores Win
The 250 th Coast Artillery team was no
match for Hunt's eleven, and went down
to a 19 to 6 defeat. On the following Sat
urday the Cards tied San Mateo Junior
College 0-0. Then Santa Clara spoiled
things by sneaking through with a 7 to 0
victory. Against St. Mary's first-year
outfit the Babes seemed to hit their stride.
They played flawless football, but were
cheated out of a victory in the last min
ute of play when the Saints shot a long
pass over the goal to win 13 to 7. U.S.C.'s;
powerful aggregation battered Hunt's j
first string to bits, and beat the reserves
22 to 13.
Defeat Bear Cubs
That's enough for the dismal days.
Brick Mitchell's young Bears journeyed
south anticipating an easy workout. The
Stanford freshmen were the underdogs
from every viewpoint. California was>
favored to win, the odds being 4 to l.j
Comparative scores showed their theoret-1
ical superiority and Hunt's team was |
weakened by injuries.
Two totem poles have been pre
sented to the University of British
Columbia.

But the worm turned that day. An as
tonished California rooting section, and
a gang of Stanford fans, who were only
a little less surprised, saw the red
shirted team push the Cubs up and down
the field at will. They saw a scoring ma
chine which functioned perfectly. They
saw the highly touted California babes
whipped on straight, hard football by
the score of 25 to 7.
