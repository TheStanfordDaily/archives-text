# 87.000 SPECTATORS WILL FILL CARDINAL STADIUM TOMORROW
## New Addition Boosts Total Seat Capacity 17,000 Over Last Year 
### 
Approximately 87,000 Big Game
fans, the largest crowd that has ever
witnessed a Stanford-California clash,
will be present tomorrow to cheer for
the Great American Game.
Though 17,000 more people will see
this contest than in 1925 when the
game was last held here, there is still
the frantic last-minute demand on the
part of the public to obtain tickets.
This greater accommodation is made
possible by the recently completed
$190,000 addition.
Starting out with a seating capacity
of 60,000 in 1924, costing $284,000, the
Stanford bowl has grown to its pres
ent size totaling a cost of more than
$594,000', which includes the $ix new
lavatories. The first addition provided
for 10,200 new seats costing $108,000.
The demand for seats was so great
that the second and present section
was added. .
Besides the new unit of seats, which
includes fourteen rows built on the
rim of the old structure, a new cov
ered press box has been installed, an
up-to-date radio broadcasting station
lias been provided for, two new emer
gency first aid stations have been
built, and the scoreboards have been
raised.
"Safety first" was the motto in
building the new addition. Piles have
been driven through the stadium em
bankment 1o the depth of five to eight
feet in the original ground. Steel
plates insure stability of the main
joints, and a three-fourths-inch coat
ing of "Gunite" makes the walls more
rigid.
The same type of architecture, the
arcade style, was followed in harmony
with the Quad. The bowl has been
painted a buff color which forms a
pleasant contrast witli the green
steps and the green turf.
With these new improvements
Stanford now has a stadium that is
the largest in the West and second
largest in the country, according to
the Board of Athletic Control. Frank
lin Field, University of Pennsylvania,
is larger, having a seating capacity of
94,000. Soldiers' Field at Chicago can
accommodate 110,000 by using 25,000
temporary emergency seats. Neither
the Palmer Memorial Stadium at
Princeton, nor the Yale Bowl is as
large, the latter constructed to seat
only 60,000 people.
In the West, the Los Angeles Coli
seum runs a close second with a seat
ing capacity of 85,000. The Memorial
Stadium at the University of Califor
nia, costing more than $1,000,000, pro
vides accommodation for 78,000. The
University of Washington arena con
tains approximately 45,000 seats.
