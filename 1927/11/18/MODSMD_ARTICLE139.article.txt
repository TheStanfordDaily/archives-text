# GEORGIAN ELEVEN HAS PERFECT GRID RECORD
## 
### 
Coach Woodruff of the University of
Georgia today has the only undefeated
or untied college football team in the
country. Only two opponents have
scored against the Southerners this sea
son—Yale and Auburn—with a total of
13 points against Georgia's 202.
Assisting Woodruff are Mehre, for
merly a Notre Dame center, and Jim
Crowley, one of the famous "Four
Horsemen of Notre Dame" a few years
back.
