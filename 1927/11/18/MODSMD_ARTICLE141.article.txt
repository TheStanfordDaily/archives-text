# HEAD BEAR COACH
## 
### 

NIBS PRICE enters his second Big Game tomorrow as
head coach of the California Bears. Coming back in sensa
tional style from last year's nightmare, Nibs has quickly
raised the rating of his team in Pacific Coast football. Fans
are expecting a great battle when he sends his men in to
tussle with Pop Warner's prodigies. Nibs is a dyed-in-the
wool Bear, graduating from U.C. in 1914. Five years later
he became head freshman coach, and in 1926 he succeeded
Andv Smith.
