# BIG GAME MEASURES NIBS PRICE'S SECOND YEAR AS GRID COACH
## 
### 
Nibs Price, California football mentor,
will test the results of his second season
of varsity football coaching at U.C. when
the Hears and Cardinals meet tomorrow
in the Stanford Stadium.
Formerly freshman football and head
basketball coach at California, Price took
over his present position on the death of
Andy Smith in the fall of 1925, and
guided the Bears through their disastrous
season of last year. This year lie has
seemingly succeeded in placing California
on the upward path again, and fans are!
expecting a great battle when he sends
bis men on the field for his second Big
Game.
Price came to U.C. from San Ber- i
nardino High School in 1910 and gradu
ated in 1914. lie starred in rugby, basket
ball, and baseball in college, and on
graduation became head coach at San
Diego High School, where his success
was phenomenal. In 1917 he entered the
air service and returned to the Univer- |
sity of California in 1919 to become head
freshman coach.
His work with the Bear cub football
team caused him to be promoted to bead
assistant to Andy Smith in 1 ( >20, putting
him in the logical position to succeed
Smith.
He was made head basketball coach in
1925, in which position he has been the j
nemesis of all coast teams, his aggrcga- [
lions winning the Pacific Coast Confer- i
ence championship for the past three
years and downing the Stanford varsity I
in each series.
