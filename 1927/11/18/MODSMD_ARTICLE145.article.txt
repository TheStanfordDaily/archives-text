# CARDINAL GRAYS HAVE SUCCESSFUL SEASON; DEFEAT SAINT TEAM
## 
### 
A story of the Stanford Grays' foot
ball season is short, but it is also very
sweet, with two wins and one tie. Hal
Davis' crew played only three games this
year, but the manner in which they played
them is little short of startling.
With a disorganized line-up and only
a few practice sessions, the Grays in
some measure wreaked revenge for St.
Mary's varsity and freshmen defeats by
trimming the heavier Saint reserves 12
to 2.
Later when Husky Hunt's freshmen
were too battered to play, the workhorse
outfit took on Dud Degroot's Santa Bar
bara State College eleven, and won 12
to 0. The Grays, who were in almost as
bad a physical shape as the yearlings,
more completely outclassed the southern
outfit than the score indicates.
Against the California Reserves, Davis'
aggregation was only able to get a 6 to 6
tie. It is the only blemish on their sea
son's record, but it is no disgrace, as it
can be said that the Grays were one of
the few elevens which have played War
ner system football so that it looked like
Warner system football should look.
They did something, too, which is not
so generally known but was several times
more difficult than winning games. That
was the business of scrimmaging Pop
Warner's varsity, and they did that job
a great deal more successfully than some
college teams.
