"I think the rooting section lost the
Santa Clara game as much as the team
did," says A 1 Case, Stanford cheer leader.
We have a chance to come back for the
Big Game and we will have to come back
strong to win."
" 1 he attitude oi' the men in the rooting
section has been very good this season.
It was unfortunate that we were over
confident in the Santa Clara game, but
we should not lose our morale because we
lost two games this season."
"Rooting section stunts are a great
spectacle and should be kept up for the
sake of the crowd," says Cass.
