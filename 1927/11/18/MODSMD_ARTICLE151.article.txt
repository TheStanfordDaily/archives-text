Statisticians who arc fond of fooling with figures have found the following
facts to be feasible:
If all the tickets used at the game were placed end to end, they
would cover a distance of 40,333 feet, or nearly eight miles. That
would take them around the gridiron 39 times, with a surplus for a
trip to the press box.
If all the seats in the stadium were laid in a straight line, they would reach a
distance of 25 miles, or practically to the Los Angeles city limits.
The spectators will consume 15,000 hot dogs, 1,500 pounds of pea
nuts, 14,400 bottles of soda pop, 4,800 eskimo pies, 40,000 cigarettes,
7,500 sticks of chewing gum, 10,000 packages of candy and mints, 11,001
fifths of gin and assorted liquors, and later about 40 gallons of castor
oil.,
Ihe entire population of the state of Nevada, including all of the potential
grass widows in Reno, could not fill the stadium.
I here will be over forty special trains of twelve coaches each, and 14,000
automobiles to convey spectators to the game.
There will be 1,200 quarts of orange juice drunk, and
spectators.
Eighty-seven thousand people will spend $435,000 to watch a football game for
a grand total of 217,500 hours. This is equal to 9,062]/ 2 days, 1,294 4-7 weeks, or
?4 9-10 years, which is enough time to study for a Political Science exam.
The net weight of all the spectators will be 6,600 tons. If they
were stacked vertically, one above another, they would reach a height
of 491,333 feet, or 93.07 miles, but somebody would probably slip.
Seven thousand rooters will tear 21,000 cards into 336,000 pieces, of which
frorne 74,146 fragments will land under approximately that many collars.
For an afternoon's work, 500 ushers, 180 gatemen, 270 traffic
directors, 18 state officers, 72 student police, and 30 plainclothes men
will earn a total of $2,570, or nearly enough to send a man through
one month at college.
Ten referees, five officials, and an as yet undetermined number of
gentleman attempting to bring pop into the stadium will exhume enough hot
air to provide ample heating facilities for the entire stadium.

I here will be over forty special trains of twelve coaches each, and 14,000
automobiles to convey spectators to the game.
There will be 1,200 quarts of orange juice drunk, and
spectators.
Eighty-seven thousand people will spend $435,000 to watch a football game for
a grand total of 217,500 hours. This is equal to 9,062]/ 2 days, 1,294 4-7 weeks, or
?4 9-10 years, which is enough time to study for a Political Science exam.
The net weight of all the spectators will be 6,600 tons. If they
were stacked vertically, one above another, they would reach a height
of 491,333 feet, or 93.07 miles, but somebody would probably slip.
Seven thousand rooters will tear 21,000 cards into 336,000 pieces, of which
frorne 74,146 fragments will land under approximately that many collars.
For an afternoon's work, 500 ushers, 180 gatemen, 270 traffic
directors, 18 state officers, 72 student police, and 30 plainclothes men
will earn a total of $2,570, or nearly enough to send a man through
one month at college.
Ten referees, five officials, and an as yet undetermined number of
gentleman attempting to bring pop into the stadium will exhume enough hot
air to provide ample heating facilities for the entire stadium.
Statisticians who arc fond of fooling with figures have found the following
facts to be feasible:
If all the tickets used at the game were placed end to end, they
would cover a distance of 40,333 feet, or nearly eight miles. That
would take them around the gridiron 39 times, with a surplus for a
trip to the press box.
If all the seats in the stadium were laid in a straight line, they would reach a
distance of 25 miles, or practically to the Los Angeles city limits.
The spectators will consume 15,000 hot dogs, 1,500 pounds of pea
nuts, 14,400 bottles of soda pop, 4,800 eskimo pies, 40,000 cigarettes,
7,500 sticks of chewing gum, 10,000 packages of candy and mints, 11,001
fifths of gin and assorted liquors, and later about 40 gallons of castor
oil.,
Ihe entire population of the state of Nevada, including all of the potential
grass widows in Reno, could not fill the stadium.
