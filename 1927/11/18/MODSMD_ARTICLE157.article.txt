# SURPRISES PREDICTED IN DEMONSTRATION OF BLUE AND GOLD BAND
## 
### 
Surprises galore may be expected I
when the 125 piece California Band
; marches on the field resplendent in j
! blue, white, and gold uniforms during ;
I the half of the game tomorrow. In a I
communication to the Stanford Daily, j
Charles C. Cushing, Band Captain, 1
stated that something new in march
ing will be shown then.
Drill will be conducted by Drum-
Major Earle Rogers, whose six feet
four inches of height will be exagger
| ated by a tall white snake. The !
j California band is entirely a student
' activity, being directed and managed j
by students and financed by the
A.S.U.C. With an enrollment of only !
i forty men in 1924, the organization 1
j has increased in size and now holds j
| a position comparable with the finest '
college bands in the country.
The band appears at all football \
games, rallies, and other student meet
ings. One hundred and twelve pieces
were sent to Los Angeles to play at
the game with U. S. C.
This will be the first time in the
history of the Big Game that Cali
fornia will have a larger band than
Stanford.
