# PIGSKIN ARTISTS CAN SECURE NEW LIDS BY SCORING IN BIG GAM
## 
### 
If a heated argument occurs in the
huddle tomorrow just as one of the teams
is about to put over the first score of
the afternoon, it will be because visions
of a new Thanksgiving bonnet arc pre
dominating the situation.
The Hat Company of
Francisco has offered a ten dollar Stetson

to the first man of either the California
or Stanford squads who makes the first
tally in the annual Bear-Cardinal clash
tomorrow. The fortunate young gentle
man who first fulfils the above qualifica
tion will have his choice of the entire
Lundstrom stock. No restrictions have
been placed on the manner of scoring,
so in this instance, a field goal is a
touchdown.
