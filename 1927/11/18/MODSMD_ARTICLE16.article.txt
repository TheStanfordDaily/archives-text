# CARDS READY FOR CALIFORNIA
## STANFORD LOOKS FOR VICTORY BY MARGIN OF TEN POINTS IN SEASON'S FOREMOST CONTEST CARDS PLAN COME-BACK California Said To Be Down-Hearted On Eve Of Big Game As Result Of Defeats By Great Washington, Trojan Teams 
### MILTON SILVERMAN 
TANFORD will beat California tomorrow by ten points. And the Redshirts
will not do all their scoring in the last half. They will have to tight every
minute of the game, and not depend on a last-minute spurt to put over the
winning touchdown.
Old Man Psychology is going to be a twelfth man on the field for the
Cardinals. He is going to be shoving with the Stanford backs and dragging
on the Californians.
The Bears finished their game with Washington at the short end of a
G to 0 score. Many supporters of the Blue and Gold claim that this defeat
was just the thiitg the Bears needed, that it would send them into the Big
Game with a do-or-die fight. But the defeat is serving to make the old Bear

S>feel pretty downhearted. He knows
i tliat he gave his best, and his best
i was not good enough.
Cards Must Come Through
I Meanwhile, the Redshirts, playing
|on the same afternoon, lost their
j game to an irreverent horde of Bron
! Cos. These Redshirts, however, will
| not be downhearted tomorrow. They
! know that last week they played ter
i rible football, and that they must
come through tomorrow.
Stanford will have no time to play
tiddle-de-winks for a half hour before
they settle down to business. For
four solid quarters, two rival coaches
are going to send in fresh combina
tions one after another. This will not
be a siege attack, with two teams
trading blows at midfield until some
thing breaks. The action will be tak
ing place all over the field, and most
ly at the same time.
Pop's Bag of Tricks
Man for man, Stanford has a better
team for one of these final games of
; the year. It has a whole bag of tricks,
knows how to use them, and usually
i gets results. .
Hoffman and Dougery, opposing
! fullbacks, will be given the burden
1 of line plunging. Dougery is good at
! hitting the line, and so is Hoffman.
Biff, however, can kick and pass,
I which Dougery can not.
Coach Price has a dangerous safe
| ty man in little Benny Lom, but War
! ner and all Stanford will stake their
; chances on Dick Hyland any time,
j Newman will play a great game for
: California tomorrow, but Wilton can
j give "Speed" a ten-yard start and
i beat him to the goal line.
Eisan and Evans are two fine quar
! terbacks. Price will depend on these
i men for much of his driving power.
| Stanford cannot beat them outright,
j but with the charging of Mike Mur
! pliy and the defensive play of Spud
Lewis, it can claim an even break.
