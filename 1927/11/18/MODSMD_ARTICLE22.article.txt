# Big Game Time Again!
## 
### 
IT'S with us once more! The biggest and most colorful week-end in a
year of student life at Stanford and California is at hand. A football
game that is aptly designated as the Big Game is the occasion for alumni,
students, and visitors to gather this year on the Stanford campus. After
the story of tomorrow's game has been told, the score will simply be
added to the already long list of Stanford-California clashes, but before
that time comes 86,000 spectators will receive their greatest thrills of the
entire football season. The Big Game furnishes those each year.
Stanford's football season has been a paradoxical as one could ever
expect to see. Despite two defeats at the hands of small college teams, the
Cardinal pennant tops the Coast Conference standing. Touted as a "mys
tery team" in early season reports, California's Bears have come back
from their dismal showing last year to bring themselves once more near
the top. Against Washington (already defeated by Stanford) last Satur
day the Bears showed that they are almost on a par with the powerful
Huskies.
ON the same day that the Golden Bear uncovered its suspected power,
the Cardinals suffered the most surprising upset of the year at the
hands of Santa Clara. Despite this comparison, the betting odds—what
ever they may indicate —still favor Stanford. What counts is that the
Farm is practically unanimous in predicting a Cardinal victory tomorrow,
while those who dwell under the shadow of the Campanile are not quite
so confident that California's Bears will win. What greater expression
of confidence in Stanford's team and coaches could be made in the face
of last Saturday's showing?
Ifow different such a feeling is when it is compared with the senti
ment expressed during Stanford's Dark Ages when the only illumination
was that cast by the brilliant stars of California's Wonder Teams! There
are those who believe faithfully that some day, however, the Bears will
regain the undisputed supremacy of the west again for a period of years.
We question it. Stanford has tasted of the same wine of which California
for years drank so deeply, and the taste of victory is sweet indeed!
THERE'S something different about the spirit of this year's Big Game
week-end. It was shown in the Rally last Wednesday night. Old
timers say that in former Big Game Rallies the function of the yell leaders
was to keep the crowd from continual cheering. Such enthusiasm is not
like that displayed Wednesday, but the difference in no wise detracts from
the fact that there is as much of the old "Stanford Spirit" as there ever
was. The days of "moral victories" passed three years ago—the day of
another unqualified victory is at hand.

IT'S with us once more! The biggest and most colorful week-end in a
year of student life at Stanford and California is at hand. A football
game that is aptly designated as the Big Game is the occasion for alumni,
students, and visitors to gather this year on the Stanford campus. After
the story of tomorrow's game has been told, the score will simply be
added to the already long list of Stanford-California clashes, but before
that time comes 86,000 spectators will receive their greatest thrills of the
entire football season. The Big Game furnishes those each year.
Stanford's football season has been a paradoxical as one could ever
expect to see. Despite two defeats at the hands of small college teams, the
Cardinal pennant tops the Coast Conference standing. Touted as a "mys
tery team" in early season reports, California's Bears have come back
from their dismal showing last year to bring themselves once more near
the top. Against Washington (already defeated by Stanford) last Satur
day the Bears showed that they are almost on a par with the powerful
Huskies.
ON the same day that the Golden Bear uncovered its suspected power,
the Cardinals suffered the most surprising upset of the year at the
hands of Santa Clara. Despite this comparison, the betting odds—what
ever they may indicate —still favor Stanford. What counts is that the
Farm is practically unanimous in predicting a Cardinal victory tomorrow,
while those who dwell under the shadow of the Campanile are not quite
so confident that California's Bears will win. What greater expression
of confidence in Stanford's team and coaches could be made in the face
of last Saturday's showing?
Ifow different such a feeling is when it is compared with the senti
ment expressed during Stanford's Dark Ages when the only illumination
was that cast by the brilliant stars of California's Wonder Teams! There
are those who believe faithfully that some day, however, the Bears will
regain the undisputed supremacy of the west again for a period of years.
We question it. Stanford has tasted of the same wine of which California
for years drank so deeply, and the taste of victory is sweet indeed!
THERE'S something different about the spirit of this year's Big Game
week-end. It was shown in the Rally last Wednesday night. Old
timers say that in former Big Game Rallies the function of the yell leaders
was to keep the crowd from continual cheering. Such enthusiasm is not
like that displayed Wednesday, but the difference in no wise detracts from
the fact that there is as much of the old "Stanford Spirit" as there ever
was. The days of "moral victories" passed three years ago—the day of
another unqualified victory is at hand.
