						Scrutiny of Athletics

### 
Coolly and deliberately will the Carnegie Foundation conduct a survey
of college athletics. To anticipate the nature of this survey and of the
report which will appear in about nine months we will probably do best to
scan a report by Dr. Henry S. Pritchett of the Foundation made in March,
1925. It is as follows:
"Today the outsklc Activities of the college overshadows and run counter to the
intellectual life; athletics, in a large measure, fills a larger place in the eyes of the
students than any one other interest. No student in the undergraduate life of one of
our universities should cxpect to receive the recognition or appreciation given a suc
cessful football player.
"No reasonable man will object to the employment of these activities for ex
ample, athletics —in their due perspective. But when they are allowed to dominate
the intellectual life of the colleges, they become abuses. The paid coach, the profes
sional organization of college athletics, the demoralization of students, the use of
extravagant sums of money constitute a reproach to American colleges and those
who govern fchem."
That Stanford is "guilty" on the last three counts of the indictment
there can be no question. Tomorrow a paid coach —one of the best in the
country —will send a Cardinal team on the field with a professional or
ganization (the Board of Athletic Control) handling the arrangements,
many of them through a man who does not and never will get enough
credit for his work —Football Manager Dick Lowry. Extravagant sums
of money have been spent in preparation for tomorrow's game.
There are evils to the present system of college athletics, but when
such evils can produce the Big Game, the end justifies the means.
