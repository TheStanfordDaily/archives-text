# Drive Carefully

Tomorrow at least 82,000 visitors will invade Stanford's peaceful
community of 4,000, with an ensuing trffic congestion that can easily be
come demoralizing unless handled properly. On page 5-B of the Daily
is found a set of instructions for motorists which, if observed, will greatly
facilitate the handling of the automobile traffic.
Don't cut in! Keep in line! Give proper signals! Park in the right
area! If these admonitions to the motorists are heeded, Stanford will be
deserving of commendation similar to that accorded her two years ago
for the efficient handling of the traffic problem at the Rose Bowl the day
of the Notre Dame game.
