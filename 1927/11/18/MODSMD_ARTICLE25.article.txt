There are two things to do Saturday,
see the game and spend the evening.
Those who haven't tickets can only do
the second. They will.
Big Game Saturday is the one day in
the year half the world remembers it
went to college and the other half wishes
it had.
Tt ts a day of regular exceptions to all
the rules. The rest of the year Stanford
is an institution of, if no higher, at least
medium education. A half-embarrassed
cynicism about the college customs we
put away a few years ago bothers most
students. But Big Game Saturday is
different. The mob is big enough to
make conformity a pleasure. And why
not? The student, graduate or guest who
for one day at least isn't absorbed into
the crowd, doesn't get an incomparable
wallop out of the Big Game itself and
wake up with a headache next noon
Somewhere On The Peninsula is missing
a wow of an experience!
It is noticeable that recent graduates
seem to enjoy the Battle of San Francisco
more spectacularly than either present
students or all but a few grads. If he

climbs the table at 2 a. m. and erronously
declares that lie drinks only Bear's blood
it's three to one he is Stanford '25 or so.
Otherwise he is probably a high school
junior or comes from Berkeley!
There are a few exceptions of course
and once in a while a real "typical old
grad" appears, most often a survival of
that remarkable decade around 1900 when
it seems there was nobody on the cam
pus under seven feet tall. The Rally
Committee always finds one for the Ron
fire show, but "typical old grads" are
getting rare.
It is to be sincerely hoped that all
men students who contemplate a wild,
wild evening will Saturday exercise a
certain amount of discretion as to time
and place. In much the same way as the
old-fashioned father accepted with a
shyly proud fatalism the fact that son
stayed out till midnight the world in gen
eral is willing to extend toleration Sun
day. That broad-mindedness for a day
is too good a thing to lose through lack
of finesse.
Skyrocket for the team, spell Volstead
and Six for the Board of Athletic Con
trol. May it never go broke.

It's All Imported
There are two things to do Saturday,
see the game and spend the evening.
Those who haven't tickets can only do
the second. They will.
Big Game Saturday is the one day in
the year half the world remembers it
went to college and the other half wishes
it had.
Tt ts a day of regular exceptions to all
the rules. The rest of the year Stanford
is an institution of, if no higher, at least
medium education. A half-embarrassed
cynicism about the college customs we
put away a few years ago bothers most
students. But Big Game Saturday is
different. The mob is big enough to
make conformity a pleasure. And why
not? The student, graduate or guest who
for one day at least isn't absorbed into
the crowd, doesn't get an incomparable
wallop out of the Big Game itself and
wake up with a headache next noon
Somewhere On The Peninsula is missing
a wow of an experience!
It is noticeable that recent graduates
seem to enjoy the Battle of San Francisco
more spectacularly than either present
students or all but a few grads. If he

climbs the table at 2 a. m. and erronously
declares that lie drinks only Bear's blood
it's three to one he is Stanford '25 or so.
Otherwise he is probably a high school
junior or comes from Berkeley!
There are a few exceptions of course
and once in a while a real "typical old
grad" appears, most often a survival of
that remarkable decade around 1900 when
it seems there was nobody on the cam
pus under seven feet tall. The Rally
Committee always finds one for the Ron
fire show, but "typical old grads" are
getting rare.
It is to be sincerely hoped that all
men students who contemplate a wild,
wild evening will Saturday exercise a
certain amount of discretion as to time
and place. In much the same way as the
old-fashioned father accepted with a
shyly proud fatalism the fact that son
stayed out till midnight the world in gen
eral is willing to extend toleration Sun
day. That broad-mindedness for a day
is too good a thing to lose through lack
of finesse.
Skyrocket for the team, spell Volstead
and Six for the Board of Athletic Con
trol. May it never go broke.
