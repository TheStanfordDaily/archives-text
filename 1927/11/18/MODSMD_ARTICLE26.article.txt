# CABBAGES and THINGS
## THE 						RIME OF THE ANCIENT GRAD 
### Vern Cordry 
(Apologies to Samuel Taylor Coleridge for lack
of rhyme, reason, etc.)
There was an ancient Gray-llaired Grad,
He stoppeth one of three.
"By thy triple chin and gin-lit eye,
Now wherefore stop'st thou me?"
The stadium gates are opened wide,
The rooters now file in;
"The field's not wet, my money's bet,
Can'st hear the mighty din!"
He holds him with his flabby duke,
"There was an intercepted pass "
"Leggo! Gwan home, you old galoot,
Get out! Step on the gas!"
He holds him with his gin-lit eye —
The poor young Frosh stood still,
And listens like a three-year's child;
The Old Grad hath his will.
The poor young frosh sat on a rock;
He cannot choose but hear —
And thus spake on that Ancient Grad,
Lit up on Menlo beer.
"The rooters roared, the kickoff soared,
Slowly it did drop,
The safety made a nifty catch,
But in his tracks did flop.
"A fast back came around the left,
Behind his men camc he!
lie rnn on light, cut to the right,
Went down for gain of three.
"Higher and higher sailed the punt,
And on our "fifty" fell—"
The poor young Frosh swore mightily,
For he heard the rooters yell.
"The bands have done their pretty stunts
Red show the Stanford stands,
Across the field the Blue and Gold
Root on through fear-taut hands.
"And now came in our all-star "full,"
Husky and mighty strong,
He hit the line with driving steps
And carried it along.
r
"Each linesman hunched his shoulders,
Determined was each back.
For we were all intent that day
To beat the Pink and Black.
"And now there camc a crucial time
Made famong by heroic rime,
The ball was on the three-yard line —
And it was goal to make.
"I saw their line determined
To hold at any cost.
We had to gain and that dcmquick,
Or else the game was lost.
"And then a thought came in my head,
Now why not throw a pass instead?
So back I dropped, cleats spurning grass,
And coolly threw the fateful pass.
"And I had done a hellish thing
To add defeat to shame.
For all averred, I was the bird,
Who passed away the game.
"The coach then called me from the game
And what he said was plenty!
I won't forget a syllable
If I reach four times twenty.
"Water, water, in the pails,
The managers did shrink,
The coach's words came scorching hot,
The water steamed, I think."
"Go in to see our football game,
Your luck that time forsook you—
You'd better get your ticket here,
Don't let the scalper's rook you.
"You lost a game to the Pink and Black,
Now watch the Blue and Gold
Lose this game to the Red and White
E're the afternoon is old.
"Now this pink slip costs twenty bucks,
Hell, no, there ain't no change!
Gwan in and sec each Stanford back
Play football like Red Grange."
He went like one that hath been stunned,
And is of sense forlorn,
The scalper pocketed his dough—
"Each minute there's one born."
(Apologies to Samuel Taylor Coleridge for lack
of rhyme, reason, etc.)

The safety made a nifty catch,
But in his tracks did flop.
"A fast back came around the left,
Behind his men camc he!
lie rnn on light, cut to the right,
Went down for gain of three.
"Higher and higher sailed the punt,
And on our "fifty" fell—"
The poor young Frosh swore mightily,
For he heard the rooters yell.
"The bands have done their pretty stunts
Red show the Stanford stands,
Across the field the Blue and Gold
Root on through fear-taut hands.
"And now came in our all-star "full,"
Husky and mighty strong,
He hit the line with driving steps
And carried it along.
r
"Each linesman hunched his shoulders,
Determined was each back.
For we were all intent that day
To beat the Pink and Black.
"And now there camc a crucial time
Made famong by heroic rime,
The ball was on the three-yard line —
And it was goal to make.
"I saw their line determined
To hold at any cost.
We had to gain and that dcmquick,
Or else the game was lost.
"And then a thought came in my head,
Now why not throw a pass instead?
So back I dropped, cleats spurning grass,
And coolly threw the fateful pass.
"And I had done a hellish thing
To add defeat to shame.
For all averred, I was the bird,
Who passed away the game.
"The coach then called me from the game
And what he said was plenty!
I won't forget a syllable
If I reach four times twenty.
"Water, water, in the pails,
The managers did shrink,
The coach's words came scorching hot,
The water steamed, I think."
"Go in to see our football game,
Your luck that time forsook you—
You'd better get your ticket here,
Don't let the scalper's rook you.
"You lost a game to the Pink and Black,
Now watch the Blue and Gold
Lose this game to the Red and White
E're the afternoon is old.
"Now this pink slip costs twenty bucks,
Hell, no, there ain't no change!
Gwan in and sec each Stanford back
Play football like Red Grange."
He went like one that hath been stunned,
And is of sense forlorn,
The scalper pocketed his dough—
"Each minute there's one born."
(Apologies to Samuel Taylor Coleridge for lack
of rhyme, reason, etc.)
There was an ancient Gray-llaired Grad,
He stoppeth one of three.
"By thy triple chin and gin-lit eye,
Now wherefore stop'st thou me?"
The stadium gates are opened wide,
The rooters now file in;
"The field's not wet, my money's bet,
Can'st hear the mighty din!"
He holds him with his flabby duke,
"There was an intercepted pass "
"Leggo! Gwan home, you old galoot,
Get out! Step on the gas!"
He holds him with his gin-lit eye —
The poor young Frosh stood still,
And listens like a three-year's child;
The Old Grad hath his will.
The poor young frosh sat on a rock;
He cannot choose but hear —
And thus spake on that Ancient Grad,
Lit up on Menlo beer.
"The rooters roared, the kickoff soared,
Slowly it did drop,
The safety made a nifty catch,
But in his tracks did flop.
