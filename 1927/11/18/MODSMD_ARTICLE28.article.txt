The Editor, Sir:
After holding my tongue and pen in
check for two successive seasons in the
past, the writer has decided that this,
the third season, is the traditional charm,
and now rises to voice his objections to
the seats which have been allotted to
him, as a student and as an alumnus.
For three years now tickets to the Big
Game, which have been granted to this
person, have been in no better section
than V. That is the high water mark;
and they have varied from V upwards
in the alphabet. There are good seats,
that we know; and knowing this, we
would like to know just who it is that
is so favored by the grace of the gods as
to secure one of those good seats.
It seems as if there are two classes
that should be entitled to the best seats
in the stadium, and they are the students
and the alumni. They are the ones who
have attended the University, understand
it, and have the greatest personal inter
est in the annual Big Game. It means
far more to them than it docs to the idle
spectator, who has never been a student
at Stanford or California, or anywhere
else. And yet, in the choice sections, on
cither side of the rooting sections, are
found hundreds of persons who have
never seen the inside of a classroom. And
off in the God-forsaken regions of Sec
tions X, Y, and Z are squatted the alumni

and students, bringing about premature
blindness by the eye strain caused by
watching the game from a distance. They
can guess how the game is going from
their far-off seats, while the outsiders
can get the real dupe in their choice
seats.
As stated previously, the writer has
bought tickets on the alumni classifica
tion for the last two years, and is yet
to be granted a pasteboard from that
Impartial Ticket Group in better than
Section V. Congratulations, Ticket De
partment, on such marvelous manage
ment. Long may you prosper. And while
you are busy prospering, we of the alumni
will watch twenty-two men struggle in
the dim and distant grid from the "sec
tion God forgot."
1 hanking you in advance for the at
tention I know we will not get.
SECTION V.
November 16, 1927.
The Editor, Sir:
It is known that the Stanford Band
can play difficult music, and play it well,
and it is also known that the Stanford
Band can march, and it, —well—, ter
ribly.
Let us hope that we do not have a
repetition of last Big Game. No
body can forget how that Band piled up
at the end of the Memorial Stadium
when the drum major's pistol failed to
go off and how the men tied their shoe
laces at the end of the field while wait
ing for the California Band to go through
their paces.
The Big Game is the place to sacrifice
mass formation for some stunts. We go
to see something unusual, not to hear
perfect music. If we want that, we can
go to the band's concert in the spring.
Let us hope that the band has decided to
do a stunt of the calibre of the "S.U."
at the U.S.C. game. That was the best
here.
The band is off to a good start this
year for they have a drum major that
can twirl the baton without getting "sta
dium" fright, and a drillmaster that shows
a tendency to stunts.
We have the drum major, we have the
size, we have the music, now let's have
a massive, marching, musical Block S.
Yours very truly,
A SENIOR.
