# RALLY COMMITTEE GIVES ORDERS FOR ROOTERS' SECTION
## 
### 
To insure proper execution of
rooting stunts ,Bob Fraser, chair
man of the Rally Committee, has
prepared the following instruc
tions for rooters Saturday:
1. Wear rooters' hats, bow
ties, and white shirts. This is
required. Colored shirts ruin the
effect of an otherwise perfect
stunt. Rooters' hats may be pur
chased at Roos Bros.
2. Read and listen to all in
structions carefully.
3. Be careful not to disarrange
cards in reaching your seats. Do
not detach them until told to
do so. Look on card, however,
and make sure you have all the
colors required.
4. Sit well lined-up in straight
rows.
5. Let the yell-leader do the
talking. There will be plenty of
time to yell.
G. Co-operate willingly. Time
for the stunts is very limited,
and a greater number is being
presented than ever before.
7. If you want anything, ask
the man in the red cap.
