## 
### 
Captain Hal McCrccry, the "Bad Pass
McCreery" of years gone by, was never
conceded a chance to make the team when
he turned out for the varsity six years
ago. He sat on the bench all season, and
finally went to the Olympic Club, where
he learned how to play football.
He returned to the Farm, tried for the
team again, and immediately cinched a
berth at center. Since that time, he has
played on the varsity for nearly two
years, and will conclude his football ca
reer at Stanford tomorrow.
The best compliment ever given Mc-
Creery is that he is a hard worker and a
hard fighter. He was chosen just before
the U.S.C. game this season, and his
election met the approval of not only
coach and team, but of the entire student
body.
