# RED-COVERED "LIT" TO MAKE FIRST BOW AT QUAD SALE TODAY
## 
### Calvin Wood 
The Stanford Literary Magazine, awak
ened from its lethargy of conservatism,
appears today on the Quad in a startling
new cover of flashing red with thirty
pages of exceedingly readable stories,
verse, and essays.
A light satire, after the manner of
Cabell, by the designer of the cover, Mar
shall Somerville, is the first story in the
magazine. Following close behind this in
interest, as well as in position, is a letter
written to the "folks back home" by a
Chinese student upon his arrival in Amer
ica. The letter is entirely authentic, hav
ing been written by a graduate student in
psychology here.
Helen Stanford calls the attention of
the world to the realm of olfactory de
lights in her article, "The Cultivated
Nose." Herman Salinger, editor of the
Princeton Literary Magazine last year
and a graduate student in the German de
partment, has a piece of modernistic verse
in this issue.
The deadline for the December issue
of the"Lit" is placed at November 26
and that of the deadline for the Jan
uary number at December 12.
Those not receiving the first issue are
asked to notify Jack Hodges, circulation
manager, Box 2, Campus.
