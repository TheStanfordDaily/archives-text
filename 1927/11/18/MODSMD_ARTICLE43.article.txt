# HIGHT TELLS SOCIAL, POLITICAL STATUS OF NEW ZEALAND MAORI
## 
### 
"Though he was a stone age can
nibal in the age of living man, the
Maori enjoys all the social and politi
cal rights of a British citizen," as
serted Professor James Hight of the
University of New Zealand yesterday
afternoon in discussing the problem
of the native in his country.
The Maori Professor Hight de
scribed as "strong, tall, well-built, re
sourceful, intelligent." Unlike most
native populations the Maoris have
survived the process of British colo
nization, and have assimilated Euro
pean ideas and habits to a surprizing
degree, said the lecturer.
"Unfortunate handling in the ear
lier history of the native caused dis
sension and resulted in wars, but the
recent legislation is proving satisfac
tory, and Maoris attend school, prac
tice law, medicine, and other profes
sions. At least four Maoris represent
the native population in Parliament."
There are now 135 primary native
schools subsidized by the government,
and several secondary schools. As
many attend the regular public
schools, however, as those for the
Maoris only. In the Universities there
is complete equality.
Maori population is increasing, says
Professor Hight, fifty per cent faster
than that of the whites. The native
death rate is nearly twice that of
Europeans, however.
