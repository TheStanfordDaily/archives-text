# UNDEFEATED JUNIORS FALL BEFORE SENIOR HOCKEY SQUAD 6 TO 1
## 
### 
In a hard-fought game between two
undefeated teams the senior hockey squad
downed the juniors yesterday by a score
of 6-1. The seniors played more scien
tific hockey and had more finished team
work, but they were bitterly contested
throughout the match.
Three senior goals were made by Caro
lyn Shepard, two by Lida Rittler, and
one by Dorothy Cone. Helen North scored
for the juniors.
Sophomores defeated the freshmen
Wednesday 3-0; two goals were made
by Marion Holley and one by Marian
Leachman. These matches end the prac
tice games, and the championship series
will begin next week.
