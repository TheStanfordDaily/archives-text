# TRAINER DENNY ONE OF MOST VALUABLE AIDS TO CARDINALS
## 
### 
How many of the thousands who
crowd the Stanford stadium tomorrow
will know him when he is on the
field? How many will recognize one
of the most important figures in the
Cardinal football unit?
He isn't a player and he isn't a
coach, but he is just as important as
either. He's Varsity Trainer Wallace
Denny, the man with the satchel
whom nobody knows.
You've seen him often enough, a
broad, earnest figure, hurrying across
the gridiron to aid some leatlier
helmeted warrior lying stretched
upon the turf. You've seen him re
vive an injured player who rose, per
haps, to win the game.
Great Aid to Team
It is only Pop Warner and his Cards
themselves who fully realize just
what Wallace Denny means to the
team. They find him there when they
report to practice and they know he's
still working after they are all gone
home.
The plunging fulls, the elusive half
backs, and the giant tackles receive
the hoarse cheers of the packed root
ing sections, but they know that be
hind their smooth machine and be
hind their individual speed and

! power is a man who restores the
! spring to their legs, and brings back
j the smoothness to torn muscles.
For years he has been with Warner. j
Back at Carlisle in his college days, <
! Denny knew Pop as a coach, and
j since then as an associate. He's one i
of the closest to the throne, perhaps,
and no one understands the purposes I
and the fancies of the "Old Fox" ■.
better.
He spoke the other night at the
rally. What he said probably wasn't
so much when judged from the stand-,
point of polished oratory. But those |
! few sincere words, simply stated, j
were characteristic of the man, and
when the thunderous applause died
away, Wallace Denny must have
realized that no longer is he the man
nobody knows —not among Sons of
the Cardinal at least.
