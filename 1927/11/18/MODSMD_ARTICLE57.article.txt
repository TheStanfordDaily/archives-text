I have never been so excited as
I was Wednesday night at the
Big Game Rally. I mean, every
day I find more and more things
to be interested in about the foot
ball team.
But I really don't understand
why they take the team away off
just before the game. It does
seem sort of mean, because I
know that all the alumni are so
anxious to see them. Alumni are
always so enthusiastic that they
always want to give parties and
things for the men.
I mean, they try to help the
team's spirit, along before the
game. Alumni really are the gay
est people, if you know what I
mean. And they are so willing to
help us make the college what it
was in the good old days.
When the old grads come back
to the campus the freshmen have
just the grandest time taking
them to lunch and listening to
the stories about the past games.
The raiiy? On yes, it was full
of pep and fire. I know the boys
who built the pyre feel repaid for
their work. It gave off just the
most wonderful lights and noises.
It will be easy for them to catch
up in their studies now, with such
an inspiration.
