LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17.—(P.1.P.)
—At a recent meeting of the Presi
dent's Cabinet of the University of
California at Loh Angeles, campus
leaders voiced their objection to sinn
ing honor system pledges previous to
each examination.
They based their objection on the
fact "that the signing of pledges pri
marily violates tile ideals of the
honor code." If we are to be on our
honor during examination hours, why
should we need a legal statement to
the effect that we are honorable?"
they asked.
