# CITY SCRIBES AGREE ON UNCERTAINTY OF CARDINAL-U.C. CLASH
## Press Box Prophets Refuse to Predict Definitely on Final Outcome 
### 
"Any or either team is likely to win
from a safety to eleven touchdowns,"
says Franklin B. Morse, of the Chronicle
staff. "Furthermore, I am absolutely
through for the remainder of this season
as far as making prognostications are
concerned. If I were a betting man, my
address would be the county poorhouse."
This is the attitude of most of the
press-box prophets after Saturday's
games. They do not choose to be arbi
trary any more, but Morse goes on to
make the assertion, "If Stanford plays
as it did against Santa Clara and Cali
fornia plays as it did against the Uni
versity of Washington, then Stanford is
going to be beaten by three touchdowns."
Bears Given Chance
Ed. R. Hughes, of the same paper, de
clares, "If Nibs Price can get the Cali
fornia boys in the same mental attitude
as they were last Saturday when they
liattlcd a powerful Washington team in
the mud, his boys are liable to beat
Stanford or any other team.
"It will be remarkable if Captain Fritz
Coltriti and his men can get in that
frame of mind twice in one week, how
ever. They are human beings and they
are young, so you can't dope them."
Morse Likes Cardinals
Brick Morse, Call sports writer, has a
little to say about the handling of the
teams. "Pop Warner will have his men
in far better shape than they have been
all season. Don't forget that. The Big
Game is the thing that Pop aims at.
Nothing else matters much, although lie
doesn't like to lose.
"Kibs Price, however, must go full tilt
ail year.
"No one denies that Stanford will
have an edge next Saturday from a
coaching standpoint. Coaches learn a lot
each year. Pop Warner has been learn
ing as head coach for thirty-three years.
Nibs Price is in his second year. He is
learning fast, but he certainly has not
caught up with Warner yet."
