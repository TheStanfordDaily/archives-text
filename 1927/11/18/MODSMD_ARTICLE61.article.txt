# STIFF STRUGGLE SEEN BY STANFORD MENTOR FOR CARD-U.C. CLASH
## 
### 
"Who'll win? Well, it's a toss up,"
said Coach Pop Warner. "It all depends
on what frame of mind the men are in
tomorrow. Stanford ought to he in good
form for the game. The breaks will be
pretty important.
"Both sides are hoping for a dry field.
Wet turf is an equal handicap, as each
depends on speed and open playing. Don't
think that California will lie tired from
the Washington game. The Bears will
have their full strength, and have just
as good a team as Stanford. I cannot
say that there is any edge, one way or
the other. It is anyone's game."
Tcmpleton Picks Stanford
"Stanford will win by three touch
downs," said "Dink" Tcmpleton. And
there was no doubt in his voice as he
gave the Daily this terse statement, the
only bright outlook extant.
The men who will actually do the
playing are not expecting a walkaway
either. Captain Hal McCreery thinks
that the game is "certain to be a tough
one." lie sltys, "I saw California play
Washington last Saturday, and they arc
good. I do not think that they will be
played out by that game. They can and
wiil fight hard. We were awful cocky
before the Santa Clara game, and I
rather think the loss did us good We
will fight the hardest game of the season
against the Bears, nothing held out. Both
teams will be at their best, but I think
we have a slight edge. I will be satisfied
if we win by one point."
Players Predict Struggle
"Biff" Hoffman agrees with McCreery
that Stanford is slightly favored. "The
game will be close and the outcome will
depend on fight and consistency. Our
system is better than when we played
U.S.C. It is only a matter of the indi
vidual players carrying it out."
