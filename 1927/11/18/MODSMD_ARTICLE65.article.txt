# THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF TRADITIONS BEHIND BAND LACK OF FUNDS TROUBLED FIRST ORGANIZATION PROFESSOR E.W. MARTIN DIRECTOR SINCE 1915

### 
"Come join the band, and give a cheer
for Stanford Red—■"
When the band takes the field tomor
row afternoon with the strains of "New
Colonial" march, it will have behind it
the traditions of nearly thirty-five years.
For it was in 1893 that Stanford rooters
were first pepped up by a Cardinal band.
Beginning at that time with thirty
three men, membership in the organiza
tion fluctuated for many years. Stumb
ling blocks presented themselves to the
band in its formative stage, not the least
of which was the lack of funds.
Professor Ernest Whitney Martin, who
had been playing cornet in the band
while taking an advanced degree here,
undertook the directorship of the organi
zation in 1915—a position he has held
ever since.
In 1921 the band reached some degree
of proficiency and with sixty-four uni
formed men made its appearance at the
1 >ig Game. A sort of rivalry began to
spring up between the Stanford and Cali
fornia bands playing at football games.
Though not officially recognized, the two
organizations have waged a contest from
that time on.
The present rod and white uniforms
were first worn at the Big Game in 1924,
when a seventy-five piece band maneuv
ered on the field at half time. The fol

lowing year it was enlarged to ninety-six
pieces; 1926 saw 104 men journey to
Berkeley, and this year there will be 108
in uniform. Membership is increased
only when improvement in instrumenta
tion can be made.
All the larger and more rare instru
ments are owned by the organization,
purchased by it or presented by friends.
| Among the most rare is an electrically
j operated set of tubular chimes which will
!be featured tomorrow. The Stanford
Band will give its fancy drill and con
cert before the game, leaving the half to
1 California.
The "Stanford Loyalty Song" will be
featured by the Cardinal band at the
: game, announces Professor Martin. The
I piece was written by J. M. Willits, '25,
! and E. R. Flint, '01, authors of "Stan
! ford Forever," and it was dedicated to the
1 present director. The words follow:
I
| Fair Alma Mater, thy glory we sing;
Throughout the land thy praises shall
ring;
; Gladly we pledge endless loyalty,
I Stanford, to thee.
II
1 Praising thy name, our voices we raise,
Faithful and true throughout all our days;
| Unto the end we shall loyal be,
| Stanford, to thee.
