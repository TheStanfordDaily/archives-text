(This is the second of a series of fea
tures on men and women of moving pic
ture fume. Material was obtained exclu
sively for the Stanford Daily.)
Tales of temperament and tantrums al
most cheated me out of a personal "back
stage" interview with the movies' most
famous dancing star —Mae Murray.
When I ventured to call upon the Nell
Brinkley girl at the Granada Theatre
this last week-end, I was warned that my
life might be much happier and my illu
sions would remain intact if 1 passed up
this particular story. Dame Rumor took
me aside and assured me that the screen's
"Merry Widow" was an unrestrained
whirlwind. Face to face encounter might,
it seemed probable, be fatal in more than
one respect.
Remembering the success that Colum
bus had when he took his big chance, 1
insisted upon being ushered into the as
serted lair. Suffice it to say that I am
still lacing the future optimistically. My
pre-conceived ideas about Miss Murray
are, however, considerably altered.
Unfortunately I had chosen the last
night of her stay in San Francisco, and
the diminutive one was busily packing to
leave for Chicago the following morning.
The theatre dressing room was knee
high with gowns of every hue and de
scription, to say nothing of trunks, bags,
and sundry carriers. Yet "La Petite"
graciously consented to half an hour's
cross examination.
In person Miss Murray is small, daz
zlingly blonde, and undeniably pretty.
Her slight affectations are overshadowed
by her sincerity and frankness. Perhaps
the star was on her good behavior, for
during my visit no vases were heaved at
the maid-in-waiting, no cuss words were
used in describing the inadequacies of the
small dressing room, and no cigarettes
or cocktails were on hand.
To put it plainly, "The Merry Widow"
may cavort and vamp outrageously within
studio walls. She may flap and dance as
boisterously as Clara Bow when facing
the camera. But in the flesh she is dig
nified, scrupulously polite, and possessed
of good mentality. A lady in every
sense of the word.
Guns of Gait in tbe actual locale—
"Guns of Gait" in the actual locale—
Southern Europe," she told me with much
enthusiasm. "Nowadays the actress and
the play are too often brought together

j without thought as to the artistic value
or the suitability of the actress for the
part. A star has to be temperamental to
j protect her interests. Mr. Clift wrote
| this story especially for me, and I am
: going to wait for more such vehicles in
j stead of doing inane program features."
Mr. Clift, who is a Stanford man, was
extolled as an outstanding example of
j the new element coming into the picture
business. "He has everything—brains,
! personality, and character," Miss Murray
I said. "I know that I can do my best in
his story."
When told of the fervent way in which
Stanford students are wont to receive
movies in the Palo Alto theatres, she
gave her approval to such displays of
feeling. "As long as the audience does
not become ribald, it is splendid for it
to be aroused by what it sees on the
screen. Enthusiasm is a tonic for all of
us."
Taking a temporary vacation from
Hollywood, she is making a three
months' personal appearance tour of the
| big picture houses. All records were
! broken when she presented her "Merry
\\ idow Waltz" act in Los Angeles and
San Francisco, and she is now on her
way to Chicago to start on her Eastern
circuit. "Stage work is much harder and
very confining, but it makes me happy to
meet the theatregoers," Miss Murray ex
plained.
My illusions are indeed shattered—"La
Petite" is not a human cyclone. Person
ally I'm glad I didn't let the story drop.
My ideas of movie stars are changed,
but since one proved to be as refined and
lady-like as could be wished my general
estimation has risen a good many notches.
Whereas one thinks of the count,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen when Estelle
Taylor is mentioned, one invariably won
ders about the prince when reading about
Miss Murray. Prince David Mdvani, of
Georgia, was present during this inter
view, and lived up to all expectations. He
is tall, athletic, and handsome. Dame
Rumor's hints of matrimonial discord
were set at rest when the prince returned
from Europe three weeks ago to accom
pany his wife on this jaunt. He told me
that he wants her to retire, but how could
the movies get along without Mae? Pier
individuality and remarkable personality
asure her of a permanent place in Holly
wood's front rank of stars.

My illusions are indeed shattered—"La
Petite" is not a human cyclone. Person
ally I'm glad I didn't let the story drop.
My ideas of movie stars are changed,
but since one proved to be as refined and
lady-like as could be wished my general
estimation has risen a good many notches.
Whereas one thinks of the count,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen when Estelle
Taylor is mentioned, one invariably won
ders about the prince when reading about
Miss Murray. Prince David Mdvani, of
Georgia, was present during this inter
view, and lived up to all expectations. He
is tall, athletic, and handsome. Dame
Rumor's hints of matrimonial discord
were set at rest when the prince returned
from Europe three weeks ago to accom
pany his wife on this jaunt. He told me
that he wants her to retire, but how could
the movies get along without Mae? Pier
individuality and remarkable personality
asure her of a permanent place in Holly
wood's front rank of stars.
(This is the second of a series of fea
tures on men and women of moving pic
ture fume. Material was obtained exclu
sively for the Stanford Daily.)
Tales of temperament and tantrums al
most cheated me out of a personal "back
stage" interview with the movies' most
famous dancing star —Mae Murray.
When I ventured to call upon the Nell
Brinkley girl at the Granada Theatre
this last week-end, I was warned that my
life might be much happier and my illu
sions would remain intact if 1 passed up
this particular story. Dame Rumor took
me aside and assured me that the screen's
"Merry Widow" was an unrestrained
whirlwind. Face to face encounter might,
it seemed probable, be fatal in more than
one respect.
Remembering the success that Colum
bus had when he took his big chance, 1
insisted upon being ushered into the as
serted lair. Suffice it to say that I am
still lacing the future optimistically. My
pre-conceived ideas about Miss Murray
are, however, considerably altered.
Unfortunately I had chosen the last
night of her stay in San Francisco, and
the diminutive one was busily packing to
leave for Chicago the following morning.
The theatre dressing room was knee
high with gowns of every hue and de
scription, to say nothing of trunks, bags,
and sundry carriers. Yet "La Petite"
graciously consented to half an hour's
cross examination.
In person Miss Murray is small, daz
zlingly blonde, and undeniably pretty.
Her slight affectations are overshadowed
by her sincerity and frankness. Perhaps
the star was on her good behavior, for
during my visit no vases were heaved at
the maid-in-waiting, no cuss words were
used in describing the inadequacies of the
small dressing room, and no cigarettes
or cocktails were on hand.
To put it plainly, "The Merry Widow"
may cavort and vamp outrageously within
studio walls. She may flap and dance as
boisterously as Clara Bow when facing
the camera. But in the flesh she is dig
nified, scrupulously polite, and possessed
of good mentality. A lady in every
sense of the word.
Guns of Gait in tbe actual locale—
"Guns of Gait" in the actual locale—
Southern Europe," she told me with much
enthusiasm. "Nowadays the actress and
the play are too often brought together

j without thought as to the artistic value
or the suitability of the actress for the
part. A star has to be temperamental to
j protect her interests. Mr. Clift wrote
| this story especially for me, and I am
: going to wait for more such vehicles in
j stead of doing inane program features."
Mr. Clift, who is a Stanford man, was
extolled as an outstanding example of
j the new element coming into the picture
business. "He has everything—brains,
! personality, and character," Miss Murray
I said. "I know that I can do my best in
his story."
When told of the fervent way in which
Stanford students are wont to receive
movies in the Palo Alto theatres, she
gave her approval to such displays of
feeling. "As long as the audience does
not become ribald, it is splendid for it
to be aroused by what it sees on the
screen. Enthusiasm is a tonic for all of
us."
Taking a temporary vacation from
Hollywood, she is making a three
months' personal appearance tour of the
| big picture houses. All records were
! broken when she presented her "Merry
\\ idow Waltz" act in Los Angeles and
San Francisco, and she is now on her
way to Chicago to start on her Eastern
circuit. "Stage work is much harder and
very confining, but it makes me happy to
meet the theatregoers," Miss Murray ex
plained.

Tales of temperament and tantrums al
most cheated me out of a personal "back
stage" interview with the movies' most
famous dancing star —Mae Murray.
When I ventured to call upon the Nell
Brinkley girl at the Granada Theatre
this last week-end, I was warned that my
life might be much happier and my illu
sions would remain intact if 1 passed up
this particular story. Dame Rumor took
me aside and assured me that the screen's
"Merry Widow" was an unrestrained
whirlwind. Face to face encounter might,
it seemed probable, be fatal in more than
one respect.
Remembering the success that Colum
bus had when he took his big chance, 1
insisted upon being ushered into the as
serted lair. Suffice it to say that I am
still lacing the future optimistically. My
pre-conceived ideas about Miss Murray
are, however, considerably altered.
Unfortunately I had chosen the last
night of her stay in San Francisco, and
the diminutive one was busily packing to
leave for Chicago the following morning.
The theatre dressing room was knee
high with gowns of every hue and de
scription, to say nothing of trunks, bags,
and sundry carriers. Yet "La Petite"
graciously consented to half an hour's
cross examination.
In person Miss Murray is small, daz
zlingly blonde, and undeniably pretty.
Her slight affectations are overshadowed
by her sincerity and frankness. Perhaps
the star was on her good behavior, for
during my visit no vases were heaved at
the maid-in-waiting, no cuss words were
used in describing the inadequacies of the
small dressing room, and no cigarettes
or cocktails were on hand.
To put it plainly, "The Merry Widow"
may cavort and vamp outrageously within
studio walls. She may flap and dance as
boisterously as Clara Bow when facing
the camera. But in the flesh she is dig
nified, scrupulously polite, and possessed
of good mentality. A lady in every
sense of the word.
Guns of Gait in tbe actual locale—
"Guns of Gait" in the actual locale—
Southern Europe," she told me with much
enthusiasm. "Nowadays the actress and
the play are too often brought together

j without thought as to the artistic value
or the suitability of the actress for the
part. A star has to be temperamental to
j protect her interests. Mr. Clift wrote
| this story especially for me, and I am
: going to wait for more such vehicles in
j stead of doing inane program features."
Mr. Clift, who is a Stanford man, was
extolled as an outstanding example of
j the new element coming into the picture
business. "He has everything—brains,
! personality, and character," Miss Murray
I said. "I know that I can do my best in
his story."
