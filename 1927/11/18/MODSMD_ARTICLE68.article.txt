# INTERACTIONAL GRID STRUGGLE TO HOLD NATIONAL LIMELIGHT
## 
### 
Intersectional football games-will soon
hold the limelight in gridiron circles.
The annual Rose Bowl classic may
name Washington and Jefferson as its
eastern representative to meet a western
team on New Year's Day at Pasadena. |
Which western team the Presidents are
to meet probably will not be announced
until after the Washington-U.S.C. game
to be played in the Coliseum December 3.
Washington and Jefferson is undefeated
this season and has a chance to remain!
so, with Cornell their only obstacle on
Thanksgiving Day. Andy Kerr's eleven j
played a scoreless tie with Pittsburgh,
which is also undefeated.
U.S.C. Meets Irish
U.S.C. will play Notre Dame in Chi-1
cago on November 26, before what is I
expected to be one of the largest crowdsl
ever drawn together for a football game, i
The teams have both had successful sea
sons and are good representatives of the |
East and West. Two years ago the Irish I
defeated Southern California by one
point at Los Angeles. This year the Tro- j
jans will be in foreign territory. The j
fact that Minnesota held Rockne's men I
to a tie and the Cadets ran around them
last week, somewhat dims Notre Dame's
chances of claiming the eastern title.
The Shrine All-Star game will be held '
in Kezar Stadium December 26. Andy j
Kerr, former Stanford Coach, is nego- [
tiating to get the services of Bruce Cald- j
well, Yale star who was declared ineli
gible, to play on the eastern team. The'
western eleven has not been chosen as j
yet, although it is expected that on it;
will be several former Stanford men now j
playing for the Olympic Club.
California is playing an intersectional I
game against the University of Pennsyl- j
vania in the Berkeley Stadium January!
first. Penn has lost several games, but j
has still a strong team.
