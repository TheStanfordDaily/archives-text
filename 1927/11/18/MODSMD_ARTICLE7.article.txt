# Almack Asserts College Comics Weak In Humor

### 
"When American humor was said to
[have gone to the lowest depths, college
humor probably is what the speaker had
in mind. It is the kindergarten of hu
mor," declared Dr. John C. Almack of the
education department, in a talk on the
study of American humor at a meeting
yesterday of the Stanford Dames in the
Women's clubhouse.
"Taxes, prohibition, Germany, flappers,
Congress, and prize-fights have been the
funniest things in American comics for
the last six years," the speaker said.
"Chicago is the funniest city ; Florida and
California, the funniest states; farming
and preaching the most comical voca
tions; and radio and dancing the fun
niest sports.
People Discriminating
"The American people do have the
stability to discriminate between what is
humorous and what is not. They put a
law estimate on satire, sarcasm, and
scorn, unless the joker is the subject. The
humorous joint of view is the best from
which we can view the world. We can
learn to be humorous in an agreeable
way," Dr. Almack concluded.
Dr. Almack spoke in the place of Da
vid Starr Jordan, who was to have given
a talk on "World Peace," but was unable
to appear on account of illness.
