# WAR UNFIT PASTIME FOR DECENT GORILLA, SAYS CORRESPONDENT
## London Man Anathematizes "Obscene Outrage on The Intelligence" 
### 
"The sort of romantic entertainment
which would have proved disagreeable to
any respectable gorilla," was the charac
terization of the Great War given Prince
ton University students recently by H. M.
Tomlinson, who was a war correspondent
for the London Daily News.
Interviewed by the Daily Princetonian,
Tomlinson declared further:
"One's impression now in remembering
it is that it was like a nightmare, a dream
from which one couldn't wake up. It
was an obscene outrage 011 the intelli
gence. It wasn't real, according to all
intelligence and reason. All the poets and
romanticists who dwell on the glories and
heroism of war are utterly wrong. Most
of the patriotic verse is sheer bunk.
"What keeps a man in the front line
is not courage but a dread of the disci
pline behind which surpasses the fear of
the enemy in front. The vast majority of
fighters, after they knew what the war
was like would have said, 'Yes,' empha
tically had they been asked if they wanted
peace.
"Horrible as it all was, the next gen
eration will hear only the reports of it
that romantic writers give, and soon, on
some pretext or other, another war will
result. Propaganda picturing the realities
of war rarely does good. LTsually it
poisons good. The writer is labeled a
pessimist or a pacifist.
"My experience teaches me that if any
country engages in another war I shall
want to have absolutely nothing to do
with it. It would seem to me like engag
ing in an obscenity. However, in this
case, experience is the only teacher. The
only way to cope with people who have
not been through it is to tell them of the
new difficulties that surround each new
war. War is always an experiment and,
as such, it will always prove alluring to
those who haven't seen it.
"Personally, I believe that man is one
of the silliest creatures alive. If he wants
war he will have it whatever may be the
cost. I cannot conceive of a war, as Wells
pictures it in 'World Set Free,' that
would do away with all further wars.
The only means of achieving this result
would be by killing off the greater part of
the people 011 earth and the next war
may perform that sanitary act. Litera
ture 011 the subject effects only the few
who are intelligent enough to understand
it and their influence is not sufficient to
count.
"One of the probable effects of another
struggle would be the destruction of in
dustrial society. The important people
who have the most to lose will certainly
lose it. That will be entirely just. The
people most responsible for war will be
punished by it at last. In their constant
quest for plunder and profit they always
ignore everything but their own desires,
and get to a crisis without knowing where
they are going. Then war is precipi
tated."
