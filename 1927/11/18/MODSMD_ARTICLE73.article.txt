## 
### Sylva Weaver 
Sons and daughters of the Stanford
Red will mingle with the guardians of
the Golden Bear in many brilliant aiter
the-game festivities tomorrow night in
San Francisco. For the rivalry and spirit
that will be expended over a Cardinal flag
and a Blue and Gold one will not cease
with the referee's final whistle and the
exit of the sturdy warriors from the foot
ball field, but will last on and 011 until
the hours just before dawn.
The greatest joy of the Big Game lies
in this spirit of friendly enmity which
exists between the two universities. It is
this Big Game spirit that enhances the
enjoyment of dining and dancing, to say
nothing of shrieking, singing, and what
not. "Come Join the Band" will be
played more times tomorrow night than
during the rest of the season. And all
will be jolly fellows together. Will they
sing!
Dun't esk, nize baby, hev anodder
spoonful hepple sauce mitt Stanford
songs.
"Boys and Girls Together"
Farm maids and lads will meet in many
places to while away the merry hours
from dusk till dawn. The Fairmont will
be the principle scene of festivity. Twelve
hundred Stanford enthusiasts will gather
there in the three rooms reserved espe
cially for them.
Stanford's football team and coaches
will turn back the clock of time, and be
come Normans in a merry feast in Nor
man Hall. Eager fans will look in vain
for a glimpse of Pop Warner, however,
for he is leaving early Sunday for New
York, and cannot attend the festivities.
Tomorrow night will be the eighth an
nual football dinner.
"Frantic" Crowds
Geary, Post, and Powell Streets will
be the center of a "Frantic" celebration

with about five thousand people clamor
ing to get into the dancing salon. Twenty
three hundred reservations have been
sold, and dinner will be served in seven
dining rooms.
Big Game night is the greatest evening
of the year for the hotels, and its fes
tivities eclipse even those of New Year's
Eve, according to Manager Barson of
the St. Francis.
The California football team will
drown its sorrow or celebrate its victory
at the Castlewood Country Club in Liver
more Valley. Other exhuberant U.C.
partisans will sing away the evening at
the Claremont and the Whitecotton in
Berkeley. Great hordes of frivolous spir
its also will seek enjoyment at the San
Francisco hotels. Other groups of stu
dents will gather at the Palace, Clift,
\\ hitcomb, Mark Hopkins, Benjamin
Franklin, and the St. Claire in San Jose.
