# LOW AIRPLANE RATES NOT TO BE EXPECTED SAYS ELLIOT G. REID

"Ridiculously low airplane freight
and passenger rates, such as now
exist in Europe as a result of a re
cent rate war between French, Dutch,
and English airlines, cannot be ex
pected in this country," says Elliot G.
Reid, Professor of Aerodynamics at
Stanford, who attributes this to the
fact that American companies are en
tirely self-supporting and do not de
pend on governmental subsidies as do
the European companies.
