Reader, has it occurrcd to you that to
morrow the varsity will enter its fourth
'big game of the year? Two weeks ago
"Washington held its annual homecoming
day at Stanford's expense, and the team
had to he keyed up for the Huskies' big
effort of the season. The battle with the
Trojans last month was the first confer
ence game and was prepared for as the
most strenuous on the schedule; and Ore
gon State, like Washington, made its su
preme drive against the Cards. Small
wonder then, that the squad shows tend
encies toward letting down, as it did
-against Santa Clara. Every other eleven
is after its scalp and would gladly mort
gage the farm to beat the Redshirts.
Enter Ursus
Now comes the Golden Bear,
his claws sharpened, with intent to
commit assault and battery. The
lumbering mammal hit his stride
last week when he all but put away
the Husky dog, and tomorrow he
will be most carnivorous. Cali
fornia is dangerous this year The
chief satisfaction Stanford support
ers have is the knowledge that none
is more aware of this than the Old
Fox, Pop Warner.
"What sort of game will it be?"
one might ask. Open and spec
tacular, or predominantly a scrim
mage battle?
Much will depend on the weather
and the condition of the field. Un
less the turf gives a good footing,
the reverse plays around which the
attack is built will be to a degree
unsuccessful. The halves must be
able to show a clean pair of heels
and hit for the open soon after the
ball is snapped, or the play is lost.
The affair cannot very well develop
into a line-plunging contest, be
cause Dougery and Hoffman will
be the only really successful line
plungers on the field.
The sideline philosophers wag
their heads and say that if Hyland,
Hill, and Wilton are sent into ihe
open instead of through tackle and
guard, Stanford should be able to
gain ground with appreciable con
sistence. This, sounds reasonable,
and although everyone will have
confidence in Pop's plan of battle,
still the sight of Wilton and Hy
land starting out hell bent for elec
tion into the open field will be wel
come.
Cards Are Well-Balanced
Among the complimentary things
<hat could be said about the Cardinals
is that they are a well-balanced team.
Ends have sprung up like mushrooms
to do the jobs Walker and Shipkey
liandlcd last season. The critics said
the work of Preston, Harder, and Vin
centi in the Washington mixup was the
equal of any last year's star wingmen
•ever did. This is hard to believe, but it
cannot be gainsaid that Warner's hope
fuls follow the ball as vultures do pros
pective carrion.
Stanford admittedly needs a
heavy, fast and hard-hitting back
good for four or five yards off
tackle with regularity—a Bogue, in
short. Bob Sims sometimes is able
to deliver, but the best bet for such
an exacting job is young Lud
Frentrup. A sophomore, this
fledgling has every mark of class
as a shifty, hard-hitting back. His
inexperience will keep him on the
bench until next year, however.
