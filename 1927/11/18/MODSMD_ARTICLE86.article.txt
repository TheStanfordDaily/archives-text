# RALPH M'ELVENNY TO PLAT DOEG IN EXHIBITION MATCH
## Both Stanford Tennis Stars Rated High in National, Collegiate Circles 
### 
Campus visitors tomorrow will have the
opportunity of witnessing an exhibition
tennis match between John Doeg, former
national junior champion, and Ralph Mc-
Elvenny, veteran varsity player, to be
held on the varsity courts at 10 o'clock.
Doeg, a freshman, is considered by
sports writers to be one of America's
very best hopes for future Davis Cup
teams. He posseses a peerless service
which he follows to the net to volley the
returns, if there are any, to the far cor
ners of the court.
McElvenny, who heads the present
varsity list, is entering his third year of
varsity competition. At the national inter
collegiate tournament this summer he
rated in the first ten in singles and with
Alan Herrington was placed fourth in
the doubles. He has twice won the cham
pionship of Colorado, and has placed in
various tournaments throughout the
country.
