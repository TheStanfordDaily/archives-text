# Stanford Displays Late Season Improvement After Poor Start; Two Defeats Mar Year's Record
## 
### 
A temporary letdown with fatal results
is the only thing to mar Stanford's late
season improvement. In a mediocre early
season, the Cardinals won their first two
games, over Fresno State and the Olym
pic Club, but lost to the hard-hitting St.
Mary's eleven.
After an easy victory over Nevada, the
Redshirts tackled the invading Trojans.
Stanford tied the score 13 13, but only
after a last minute finish that demoral
ized the U.S.C. line.
On the first trip north, the Cards took
on the strong O.S.C. eleven, but came out
with a 20-6 victory. Hoffman and Wilton
played great football, and but for a
fumble in the last period Stanford would
have held the Aggies scoreless.
Another Oregon team came to Palo
Alto the following week and was sent
back after a 19-0 whitewashing. The
second team did most of the work against
the Webfooters.
The University of Washington Hus
kies provided the toughest reception for
the Redshirts during the entire season.
On a slippery, muddy field, the Stanford
team was outplayed and outcharged for
nearly the entire game. In the last c|uar
tcr, and trailing by one point, the Cardi
nals blocked Tesreau's kick behind the
goal line and recovered for the winning
touchdown.
Coach Adam Walsh and his Broncos
gave Stanford an unpleasant surprise last
Saturday, when they took advantage of
Warner's absence and trounced the Cards
13-6. Not even the first team could with
stand the Broncs.
