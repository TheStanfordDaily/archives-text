## 
### 
Glenn Scobey Warner, author, artist,
golfer, and sometimes football coach,
sends his fourth Stanford team against
the California varsity tomorrow in the
Stanford stadium. Warner is doped to
win.
Nobody realizes how valuable Pop can
be until he is missing. When last year
he traveled to Los Angeles to scout the
U.S.C. Trojans, the Redshirts beat out
the Olympic Club only after a last min
ute rally. When last week he watched
the Bears play Washington at Berkeley,
the Stanford team was defeated by a
supposedly weak Santa Clara eleven.
Pop is not content to get a team to
gether every fall, coach it for two weeks,
and then send it through a season of nine
or ten games. He has spring practice,
winter practice, and fall football. And in
the summer, when he ought to be taking
a vacation, he writes a book on football.
Moreover, over the week end, when he
might be painting trees and brooks in
oils, lie diagrams football plays in detail.
Stanford is not basing its chances of a
conference championship this year on the
fact that Warner was a good coach at
Pittsburgh. Pop knows a lot about foot
ball, but lie is not averse to learning a
bit more.
