# California's Banner Again Near Top Of Conference Pole After Disastrous Defeats During 1926
## Bears Defeated Only Twice By Powerful Teams in This Year's Games 
### 
After a disastrous season of defeats in
1926, California is once more shoving
the Blue and Gold banner toward the
top of the conference flagpole. Only two
elevens, U.S.C. and Washington, prob
ably the strongest on the Coast, were
able to-beat the Bears.
Three non-conference games offered
little difficulty to the Berkeley eleven,
which downed Santa Clara, Nevada, and
St. Mary's in short order. The Saints,
conquerers of Stanford, were defeated
13-0.
Oregon provided mild opposition to
Coach Price and his Bears, losing 16-0,
while the Olympic Club fell before the
| advance of the once powerless Blue and
j Gold.
, The first defeat of the year was handed
| out by the U.S.C. Trojans, who crushed
California in the Los Anegles Coliseum,
! 13-0.
A noticeable slump was seen in the
Bear ranks against Montana. At one
time the Bears found themselves at the
short end of a 13-12 score and unable to
do anything about it. Later they came
to and ran up three more touchdowns.
Washington took a 6-0 victory over the
Bears in a heartbreaking affair for Cali
i fornia. Twice during the game the U.C.
! team had three downs to carry the ball
j five yards to a touchdown, and each time
they were stopped by the gun.
i The Huskies, however, provided the
right medicine to bring the Blue and
j Gold team back to a fighting pitch. The
Californians, although beaten, displayed
an excellent brand of football and a
fighting spirit that may mean a lot of
; trouble for Stanford.
