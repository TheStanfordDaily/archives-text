# PRESIDENTS BID FOR NATION'S GRID TITLE; NUMBER ONE DEFEAT
## 
### 
Undefeated, and untied until their con-j
test with the strong Pittsburgh team on!
November 5, Coach Andy Kerr's Wash
ington and Jefferson warriors are very
much in the running for national honors.
Already it has been predicted that the
Presidents will be invited to represent
the East in the annual game to be played
in the Pasadena Rose Bowl on New
Year's Day.
During the two years that Kerr has (
been at W. and J., he has led his team
to the top of the pile in eastern football.!
Piling up 145 points to their opponents'
15, the W. and J. men have won seven
games and tied one, a creditable showing.!
They revenged themselves on Lafayette
by handing them a 14 to 0 defeat. Carne- !
gic Tech fell before them by a margin
of 20 to 6, while the annual Pittsburgh I
game resulted in a scoreless tie. Bucknell, |
conquerer of Penn State, was downed !
last Saturday 19 to 3.
Kerr, formerly Warner's assistant at
Pittsburgh, learned the style of football!
he is now teaching from the Old Fox j
himself. During the two years before [
Warner came to Stanford, Kerr was head .
football coach. Later he was made as
sistant to Warner and head basketball
mentor, which positions he kept until the j
spring of 1926, when he accepted a three
year contract with Washington and Jef-;
ferson as head football and basketball
coach.
