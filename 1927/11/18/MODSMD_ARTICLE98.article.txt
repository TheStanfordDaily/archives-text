# BETTING ODDS FAVOR CARDS TO WIN
## CHANCES OF BEARS IN BIG GAME TOLD BY SPORTS EDITOR Blue and Gold May Upset Predictions in Close Tilt Tomorrow

You never can tell what to expect when
California and Stanford hold their annual
gridiron get-together. And this year is
no exception.
In fact, the Card-Bear game is more
of a question mark this season than ever.
First it was California that was an over
whelming favorite, then the situation was
completely reversed as the Blue and Gold
brilliance flickered in the gloom of the
Trojan defeat and the poor showing made
in the Montana game.
But California's spirit burst into full
flame against Washington. Unless the
Bear eleven burnt itself out by that high
tension, the two teams will be practically
on even terms, with the edge, if any,
going to Pop Warner's eleven on the
basis of experience.
California,, however, has been exceed
ingly contrary when it comes to obeying
the dictates of the dopesters this year,
winning from St. Mary's when doped to
lose, losing to the Trojans when doped
to win, and scaring the Huskies almost
to death when expected to furnish only a
feeble resistance to the power of the
Northerners. So much for dope, then,
and we leave California's rooters salaam
ing to the god of Upsets.
Just what kind of an offense the Blue
and Gold will employ, or just which
players will bear the brunt of the Cali
fornia offense will remain a mystery un
til the game starts. In fact, it will more
likely remain a mystery until the game
is over, for no one knows quite what to
expect from each of the California backs.
