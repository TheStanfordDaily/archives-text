# BETTING ODDS FAVOR CARDS TO WIN
## CHANCES OF BEARS IN BIG GAME TOLD BY SPORTS EDITOR Blue and Gold May Upset Predictions in Close Tilt Tomorrow 
### EDWARD SALRACH

You never can tell what to expect when
California and Stanford hold their annual
gridiron get-together. And this year is
no exception.
In fact, the Card-Bear game is more
of a question mark this season than ever.
First it was California that was an over
whelming favorite, then the situation was
completely reversed as the Blue and Gold
brilliance flickered in the gloom of the
Trojan defeat and the poor showing made
in the Montana game.
But California's spirit burst into full
flame against Washington. Unless the
Bear eleven burnt itself out by that high
tension, the two teams will be practically
on even terms, with the edge, if any,
going to Pop Warner's eleven on the
basis of experience.
California,, however, has been exceed
ingly contrary when it comes to obeying
the dictates of the dopesters this year,
winning from St. Mary's when doped to
lose, losing to the Trojans when doped
to win, and scaring the Huskies almost
to death when expected to furnish only a
feeble resistance to the power of the
Northerners. So much for dope, then,
and we leave California's rooters salaam
ing to the god of Upsets.
Just what kind of an offense the Blue
and Gold will employ, or just which
players will bear the brunt of the Cali
fornia offense will remain a mystery un
til the game starts. In fact, it will more
likely remain a mystery until the game
is over, for no one knows quite what to
expect from each of the California backs.
Marcus Best U.C. Back
Price has used a whole flock of ball
carriers and almost all of them have
shown some brilliant playing at one time
or other. Marcus is probably the best of
; the California backs. Poor eyesight and
the fact that the Bears have not furnished
I him with any extraordinary interference
j are probably the only things that have
| kept him from being one of the out
standing players of the nation. Lee Eisan
j is another shifty back who may or may
j not to be the star of the game. Lee
I is the most dangerous safety man that
lias represented California for some time,
and is always a threat, but it is barely
j possible that Stanford will follow the
j strategy of the Trojans in not kicking to
this shifting, whirling mite, choosing to
boot short or outside instead.
Lom, Clymer Dangerous
Bennie Lom and Paul Clymer have
i been the big triple threats of the Bear
eleven this year, and one or both may
| furnish a few thrills to the multitudes.
Then there is Stan Barr, who rose from
substitution to stardom last Saturday,
j Stan's kicking and passing has been ex
ceptional all through the season, but his
j line plunging of last Saturday came as a
complete surprise. Two other power
players who have shown well all through
the year are Ralph Dougcry and Jim
j Cockburn. Both have backed the line
well, and have ripped off some nice gains
| through the opposing lines.
And if none of these Bears star, there
is Speed Newman, Rabbit Brekenridge,
Jack Evans, Lee Rice, Red Gill, Charlie J
Schmidt, or Eldred Lane, any of whom i
may be called upon.
So California is still a "Mystery Team" i
even though its general capabilities have!
been determined as a result of the last j
few games.
