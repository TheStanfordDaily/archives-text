# VARSITY AT ITS BEST CAN BEAT CALIFORNIA BELIEVES TEMPLETON
## 
### 
Stanford will beat California Satur
day if it plays its best game, Coach
Dink Templeton told members of the
Palo Alto Kiwanis Club yesterday.
Templeton bases his belief in Stan
ford's superiority on the grounds that
it is line strength that makes football
attacks effective, and that the Cardi
nal line can play better football than
any line on the Coast today. Stan
ford's line, from tackle to tackle, is
superior to the California line with
its great weakness in the center,
Templeton pointed out.
"There is no man in football who is
more capable of putting the Cards in
a frame of mind that will bring out
their best, than Coach Pop Warner."
believes Templeton.
