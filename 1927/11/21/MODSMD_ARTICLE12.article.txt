# PRESIDIO TEAM WINS FROM CARDINAL POLO FOUR BY 10-5 SCORE
## 
### 
Playing a hard fast game, the Ninth
Corps area polo team from the Pre
sidio, San Francisco, evened the
count with Stanford's squad by de
feating the Cardinals 10 to 5 Friday
on the local field, 10 to 5. Stanford
played a good game but failed to
show the same amount of teamwork
as on last Wednesday when they
gleaned a victory from the army
team. At no time during the match
did the local quartet take the lead.
Captain Kilburn, playing for the
visitors, featured in nearly every
play. The other members of the visit
ing team, Major Kilburn and Lieuten
ants Butler and Griffith, former West
Point players, likewise performed
creditably and showed the results of
long experience.
Captain Tex Thompson starred for
the Cardinals. Time after time he pre
vented the army men from scoring
and in the beginning of the sixth
chukker he made a dazzling run with
the ball down the length of the field
for a goal. MacDougal kept the oppo
sition on the run, his near side for
ward shots being particularly good.
