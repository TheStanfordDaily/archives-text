BERLIN, Nov. 20. â€”An internation
al scandal of the first magnitude that
threatens to cause trouble between
Soviet Russia and Germany, Great
Britain, and Italy, was disclosed to
day with the discovery, by Berlin po
lice, of a plot *o counterfeit and un
dermine Russian currency. Ten ar
rests have been made.
The police gathered evidence which j
indicated that the conspirators under- j
took the huge forgery after they had !
secured the assurances of support!
from the important foreign oil inter-'
ests of the three countries. These
include former owners of the Daku
petroleum fields, who are supposed to
have aided the Caucasian counter
revolutionists behind the plot.
