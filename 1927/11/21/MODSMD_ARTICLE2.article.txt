## 
### 
Traffic conditions before and after
the Big Game Saturday worked out
better and ran more smoothly than
ever before, is the opinion of Fred
Frehe, foreman of outside properties
of the University, for a few persons
who couldn't find their cars because
of losing their bearings in the excite
ment of getting to the game and who
were found* as late as 8 o'clock on
Palm Drive looking for cars that they
had left near the South Gate, every
thing went, well.
From 11:30 o'clock till 2:30' o'clock
southbound traffic was diverted down
Palm Drive, through the University,
and into Mayfield on the Mayfield
road. The northbound traffic was di
rected during these hours up Church
ill street into Palo Alto, and into the
highway again over the bridge near
the Convalescent Home.
After the game it took more than
an hour and a half to clear the main
drive. Between the hours of 5 and
6:30 o'clock the southbound traffic
was diverted through the Convale
scent Home up Governor's Avenue,
through the University, and into May
field on the Mayfield road. The north

Zink of the Palo Alto police force.
