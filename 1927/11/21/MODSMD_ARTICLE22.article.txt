# CARDINALS EARN 13 TO 6 VICTORY OVER BEARS IN CLOSE GRID GAME
## Score Closest Since 1919 With One Exception; Writer Describes Contest as Ideal, Both Elevens Deserving of Commendation BATTLE FOUGHT OUT CHIEFLY BY FULLBACKS Hoffman Does Everything That Can Be Expected From Four Men in Backfield; Hyland Finishes Career in Blaze of Glory 
### MILTON SILVERMAN 
{STANFORD and California battled in the Stanford stadium Saturday to a
score, 13-6, which is with but one exception the closest since 1919. The
Redshirts deserved their victory, the Bears deserved their score, and every
thing in this Big Game of Games turned out as it should.
Maybe the game was a battle of lines, with Stanford taking such a big
lead in the first half, that California's comeback could not overcome it.
Maybe it was one of halfbacks, with Dick Hyland of Stanford and Benny
Lom and "Speed" Newman of California providing the required sensations.
But it was more a battle of fullbacks, of Biff Hoffman and Bud Cockburn,
and Stanford came out with the spoils. It is unfortunate for Hoffman that
Stanford ever had Ernie Nevers, for in comparison, Biff's efforts lose their
greatness. Nevertheless he gave an exhibition which assures him of being
the greatest fullback in the West since the days of Nevers.
For three quarters Hoffman was the Stanford backfield. With occasional
help from Hill and Hyland, he did everything that can be expected of

four men. He drove through the line
time after time, finding the holes and
driving through for 142 yards from
scrimmage. Not contented with that
charging, he kicked for an average
of 29 yards, equal to that of Lom, and
consistently broke through California
interference to throw Blue and Gold
backfield men for a big loss.
Leads Card Drive
He started off in the first quarter
and led Stanford's drive to the Cali
fornia goal line. Although he fum
bled on the 17-yard line, he managed
to score in the fourth period when he
dropped his role of plunging fullback
and in a hidden ball play scampered
around end for a touchdown.
Cockburn, although unable to total
as much yardage as his teammate
Lom, managed to. carry the ball thir
teen times without losing a yard,
while Lom lost one yard for every
five he gained.
Hyland Scores
Gaining an average of five yards
each time he carried the ball, Dick
Hyland finished his football career at
Stanford in a blaze of glory. He made
the first touchdown for Stanford
when in the first quarter he went
through left tackle. Although he fell
short of the line, he shoved the pig
skin over with the ends of his fingers.
California nearly tied the score in
the third quarter once when Wilton's
interference with a pass gave the
Bears the ball on the 7-yard line.
Three downs gave a gain of six yards.
On last down and four to go, Marcus
took the ball around right end to the
I 3-inch line, where Wilton just barely
j clipped him out of bounds.
Fitz Makes Touchdown
The Bears did get their score in the
I third period when Captain Fritz Col
j trin broke through and blocked Hoff
j man's kick from the 15-yard line. Six
| Californians swooped down on the
ball, and Fitz, tackle, grabbed it and
carried it ten yards to a score. Heiii- !
ecke blocked the try for point.
After a bad third quarter, Stanford j
came to life again and once more I
kept pushing the ball into California
territory. First they carried it from
their own 20-yard line to the 42-yard
line, and kicked. Then Wilton caught
a California kick on his own 12-yard
line and carried it back to nearly mid
field.
Fake Play Nets Gain
A guard-around play netted 5 yards,
and Hoffman contributed 23 more. He !
made 12 more on two plays, and then |
Sims on a Statue of Liberty play j
gained eight yards around right end. ;
With four yards to go, Hoffman faked i
another Statue play, put the ball be-j
hind his back, and went hell-for-'
leather to the California left end. A
Bear tackier dived at Hoffman, but j
thinking he did not have the ball, let
him go, and the Card fullback went j
over for the last score of the day.
The summary follows.
