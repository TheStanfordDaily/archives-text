# Having Their Say
## 
### 
Tonight in the Little Theatre the Stanford women will indulge in
their only intercollegiate activityâ€”debate. This one is to be with the
University of California. The question is: "Resolved, That this house
disapproves of nationalism." This is the third year that women's inter
collegiate debating has been on the Stanford schedule.
The debate should be interesting from more than one standpoint. The
topic is one which is much discussed at this time and vitally affects
international relations, so the debate will be worthwhile from an educa
tional aspect. The debate also gives the women their chance to show what
they can do in an intercollegiate capacity. We support the men when they
are upholding Stanford in their various activities, and the women deserve
just as much support for doing the same thing. We hope that they get it,
and that the Little Theatre will be packed this evening.
