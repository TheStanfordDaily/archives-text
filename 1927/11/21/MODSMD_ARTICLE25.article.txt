# Another Rumor Spiked
## 
### 
Considerable excitement among students was caused over the week
end by the circulation of a rumor that prohibition agents would search
the fraternity houses during Big Game time while the house members
and guests were away. The rumor said nothing of searching the
dormitories. When questioned last evening concerning this rumor Presi
dent Wilbur said that he knew nothing of the matter.
This rumor, unlike many others, we venture to say, had at least a
salutary effect in cutting down the amount of drinking on the campus.
Whoever started the rumor may not have known it at the time, but he
did commendable work in lessening obnoxious drinking.
