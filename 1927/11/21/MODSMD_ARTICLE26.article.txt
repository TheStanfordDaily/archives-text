Approximately one-tenth of the Stanford women's rooting section
blocked the aisles along side of their allotted section in the stadium
Saturday. This, through no fault of their own, caused Rally Committee
members to attempt to clear the aisle in order that other spectators might
be seated. To their surprise, the Rally Committee men found that the
women thus blocking the aisle were in possession of rooters' tickets for
the women's rooting section.
More seats, then, were sold than were allotted in this section. How
come? Stanford women had planned this year to put their rooting
section on the map by a colorful display of balloons in addition to pom
pons such as have been used at previous games. They got a poor deal,
somehow, in the seating arrangement.
