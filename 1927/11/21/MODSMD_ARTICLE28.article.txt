# MASTERS POSTPONES STANFORD-U.C. SOCCER TILT TO DECEMBER 3
## 
### 
"December 3 has been tentatively
set as the date for the varsity soccer i
game with California, which was
scheduled for Saturday morning as a j
stadium preliminary to the Big j
Game," stated Coach H. W. Maloney !
yesterday.
"I was not notified until Thursday
night that we would be unable to
carry out our plans on Saturday. Al
though it greatly disappointed players
and other interested parties, Alfred
R. Masters, General Manager of the j
Hoard of Athletic Control, decided I
that a fast game of soccer would be
too hard on the stadium field before
the Dig Game; that it would tear up
the turf and make it rough for the |
players that afternoon.
"The date will be definitely settled j
this week betweeif Masters and tho
graduate manager of California." j
