The Editor, Sir:
There is an affectation of the Stan
ford men of scorn for campus women.
As long as this attitude is carried out
within the limits of the campus itself,
the women laugh good-humoredTy at
it.
But when it is openly displayed for
the public, there is a distinctly ob
noxious atmosphere created. Is it the
true spirit of our college to put any
of its members in a laughable and
unpleasant position?
At the Big Game last Saturday a
great number of Stanford women
were forced to'sit in the aisles of the
stadium in order to see the game.
The Rally Committee tried to locate
the offenders by asking for a show
ing of rooters' tickets. Evidently
enough seats had not been reserved.
The women had paid for tickets. Are
they not entitled to seats, by law?
Another thing. The women's root
ing section was overcrowded with im
ports. We appreciate their spirit, but
not to the extent that we are willing
to sit in the aisles where it is only
possible to see twenty yards of play.
And may I suggest that in the fu
ture balloons will not be used? With
only five hundred women holding
them in a stadium for thousands, they
are distinctly not effective.
