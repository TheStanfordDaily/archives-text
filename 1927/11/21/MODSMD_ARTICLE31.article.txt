The Editor, Sir:
I read your columns of "Campus
Opinion" every day, and of late, I
notice the students are asking for a
"square deal" from the Stanford
Union.
The general opinions seem to he
that the students are now being
gypped by the cafeteria and the Union
Store, that poor foods are being
served and that prices are high. I
am not denying the fact that said
students are right or wrong, but as a
group of students at Stanford Univer
sity, in due respect to those who de
serve credit and our patronage, let's
take our hats off to one portion of
the Stanford Union —"The Cellar."
Last year "The Cellar" was the
"bunk." Prices were high. Food not
always the best. This year "The Cel
lar" and Miss Handy are very for
tunate to have the services of a
jolly little sandwich man who answers
to the name of "Pete." Pete is one
hundred per cent for the students.
He doesn't serve "caftria food" at
"roadhouse" price, but he does serve
Morey's type of foods at Morey's
prices.
If a few of Morey's so-called "ar
dent supporters" will sample one of
Pete's sandwiches and can say Morey
has a better one for the same price—
I will fade out.
Yes, Mr. Hoover would ask for an
other "three-decker."
Sincerely, A Student.
