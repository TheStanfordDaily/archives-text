# AND Then Our Little SALLY---

It really is the hardest thing for
me to settle down to tell you all about
everything; I mean, my mind is sim
ply jumping from one thing ot an
other. It actually is.
But anyway, I never realized until
the Gaieties the other night that there
was so much talent on the campus. It
would be wonderful if we could capi
talize on it, I mean where it would
be perfectly legitimate.
And the dance in the pavilion after
ward was more fun. Everyone stayed
on one side of the floor so that the
roughs would have enough room. I
wish more people had come, too, be
cause there was loads of room in the
corners to be filled. I mean I have
never seen so many vacant spaces at
a dance before.
And then the Big Game. I really
was terribly excited. There was noth
ing subtle about the plays our team
made. They wanted something, and
they won it. But of course, I couldn't
see it all because I had to sit on the
steps.
Evidently campus men must think
that we are smaller than we really
are. I mean, there were certainly not
500 women's rooting seats reserved.
I rally felt quite hurt about it.
Up in the city after the game, I
was never so thrilled in my life. I
mean I was actually shocked. You
either drowned your sorrows or cele
brated the victory. The same means
to an end, as they say in Citizenship.
