To youth growing up in a dull, me
chanistic, ill-run world the Big Game
and Big Game Night seem to be ves
tiges of the carnivals and spectacles
that used to enliven ancient cities,
when life was worth living.
No other night in the year, San
Francisco club and hotel operators
say, equals the night after the annual
battle in color, liveliness, and bril
liance, not even excluding New Year's
Eve. Joy flows fast in the city hotels
where Stanford and California stu
dents (with a minimum of butter and
egg men) meet and together enter
into the spirit of the event.
