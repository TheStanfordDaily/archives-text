# Robbers Take Advantage Of Big Game To Pilfer Six Fraternities
## 
### 
An increasing total of losses by rob
beries which took place Saturday was
being discovered as residents re
turned to the campus last night. A
check of fraternity and sorority
houses made by the "Daily" last night
indicated that at least six fraternities
had been pilfered during the absence
of residents. No sororities were en
tered by the robbers.
Phi Delta Theta reported the great
est loss, of approximately $450 in
clothing, a saxophone valued at $125,
and $40 in cash. The cash was in a
pocket of one of the suits taken. Indi
cations were that two men, one six
feet tall and one about five feet ten
inches in height committed the rob
bery. It seems probable that tuxedos,
suits, and overcoats were intended to
be worn by the thieves, for only
clothes fitting men of those sizes were
taken while suits of other sizes in
the same rooms were left behind.
One may have had a penchant for
music. Besides the clothes several
suitcases were taken, possibly to
carry the haul in.
Sigma Chi was robbed of all loose
money, the sum of which has not yet
been ascertained. Two vases valued
at $25 each were missing from the
dining room of the Phi Gamma Delta
house. Three watches were lost at the

Alpha Tau Omega house, and the
Alpha Delta Phi members reported
that two suits and an overcoat were
stolen. Most of the houses admitted
that the findings were incomplete,
since many residents had not yet re
turned from week-end celebrations.
A different note was struck at the
Sigma Nu house, where it was found
that padlocked closets were "jimmied"
open but no clothes taken. The cook
reported the presence of strange men
during the game who urged him to
give them a drink of illicit beverage.
Their request was not complied with,
and the cook told fraternity members
that he suspected the strangers to be
Federal Prohibition agents. Verifica
tion of his assertions has not been
possible to discover any grounds for
his suspicions.
Theft of a two-door Ford sedan, be
longing to Alice Buhler of San Fran
cisco, and of a Dodge roadster was
reported to Palo Alto police. Loss of a
$2500 Patlie News camera at the sta
dium was also listed with the police
authorities. No report of its recovery
was made up to last night.
Fred Frehe, special campus officer,
said that the Kappa Alpha Theta
house reported the presence of a
prowler about the house to him, but
that there was nothing missing.
