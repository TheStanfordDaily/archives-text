That play of Hyland's scoring the
first touchdown for the Cards in the
first quarter was a cheater if ever
there was one. Dick nearly split an
infinitive to put the ball on the line.
When he was downed he reached out
and touched the chalk-line with the
ball and then drew it back under him
again, meanwhile explaining to the
referee that the Cards were entitled
to six points therefor.
