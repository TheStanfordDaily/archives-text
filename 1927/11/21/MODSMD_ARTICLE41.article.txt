# STRANGE ALIBIS
## 
### 
A large, powerful hand was an im
portant factor in the Cardinal victory,
and a cleated shoe helped defeat Cali
fornia.
Hoffman tucked the ball in his capa
cious mike and hiding it behind his
back sneaked around left end to make
Stanford's second touchdown, and
Marcus, so those on the sidelines said,
stepped out of bounds in the third
quarter when he was only about three
inches from the goal line. If his step
had been made inside by the width I
of his foot, it would have been a I
greater day for California.
