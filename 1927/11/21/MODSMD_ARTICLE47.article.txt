# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
That "S" stands for stars is a self
evident statement, and statistics will
support it, speaking from a football
sense at any rate. Supposing we skim
over a few coaches whose names be
gin with the nineteenth letter, and
then pick an all-star all-time "S" team.
"Wally" Steffen, shown above in
the robes he wears while sitting on
the judicial bench, was chosen All-
American quarter-back in 1908. For
over thirteen years now, Judge Steffen
has coached the football teams ft
Carnegie Tech, and their long string
of victories will attest to his skill.
Amos Alonzo Stagg has been "chef
de football" at the University of Chi
cago for thirty-six years. Jack Suther
land was Pittsburgh's greatest guard,
and now is as successful as a coach
as he was as a player.
Foster Sanford, who coached at
Columbia and Rutgers with great suc
cess, was Yale's best center, and one

of the greatest from any school. A1
Sharpe did fine work at Cornell, and
broke through Harvard's long line
of victories over the Ithacans with
his 1915 team. "Fat" Spears was All-
American guard at Dartmouth, and
has coached brilliantly, first at West
Virginia and lately at Minnesota. The
late Andy Smith's University of Cali
fornia teams were not beaten for six
years. Andy was All-American full
back at Penn in 1904.
Here is my All-time S-team, not,
however, chosen entirely from S- col
leges and universities. Ends: Shelvin,
of Yale, and Snow, of Michigan;
tackles: Slater, of lowa, and Sund
strom, of Cornell; guards: Spears,
of Dartmouth, and Sutherland, of
Pittsburgh; center: Schultz, of Michi
gan; quarter-back: Stevenson, of
P.enn; backs: Slagle of Princeton;
Salmon, of Notre Dame; and Smith,
of Penn.
