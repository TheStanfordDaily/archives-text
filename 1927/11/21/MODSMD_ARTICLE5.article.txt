# RAM'S HEAD PROVIDES NIGHT OF GOOD CLEAN FUN IN ANNUAL SHOW
## "Gaieties" Program Lacking In Unity; Quality of Numbers Uneven 
### H.J. K 
Ram's Head Society presented an 1
evening of good clean fun Friday
night with their "Football Gaieties,"
and in addition presented some good j
musical features. The show was a ]
nice, collegiate one, and with the help !
of the pre-game spirit, scored plenty
of applause.
I-lowever, even such numbers as
the Music Manglers, the banjo duet,
the first five minutes of Marshall
Ivirby's "Tryoutee," and Alonzo B.
Cass himself, did not entirely com
pensate for the unevenness in the
quality of some of the numbers, and
the obvious lack of unity in the pro
gram. The system of using the new
drapes for backdrops did not get away
from the annual difficulty of long
waits between acts, and even a revue
should plan its program with some
regard to succession of effects.
Now for the compliments: The skits
showed more care than usual in the
preparation, and cues and lines were
followed in an almost unprecedented
manner for campus vaudeville. Some
of the jokes indicated a master mind
somewhere had been observing cam
pus topics. The Party of Six appears
to have taken its place with the tra
ditions, "I mean, I actually do!" is
now officially campus vernacular.
"The Elusive Earl" was particularly
rich with contemporary burlesque.
The chorus was pretty and well
trained. Frances Boone deserves cred
it for the hard work that goes into
turning out sixteen clogging girls.
Jack Wiggin's "Rolling, Strolling"
helped to make the skip rope dance a
catchy number.
The Music Manglers made a touch
down in the first quarter. Larry Sta
ley's songs were good, and the banjo
duet with Payne Thebaut and Staley
was one of the best numbers the cam
pus has heard for some time.
A1 Cass helped to redeem some of
the discrepancies of the program. The
skit, "Why, for no good reason," fur
nished welcome comedy relief to the
program.
