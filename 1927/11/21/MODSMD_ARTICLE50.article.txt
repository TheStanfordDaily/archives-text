# STANFORD, CALIFORNIA ROOTING STUNTS GAIN APPROVAL OF CROWD
## Sixteen Displays Planned by Cards; Only Nine Are Completed 
### Templeton Peck 
Perhaps there are cynics who sneer
at mention of college spirit, but their
sniffs were quite inaudible in the gen
eral approval of the California and
Stanford rooting sections and the
stunts they put on at the Big Game.
Stanford had sixteen different
rooters' stunts scheduled, in thirty
one movements, but at the end of the
half, only nine had been completed.
The opening display was a greet
ing, blue letters on a gold back
ground, "Hello Bears." A bear, la
belled "California," but unceremoni
ously shown on his side rather than
on his feet, and a representation of
the outline of the state in gold with
a blue "C," followed by a change to
a white "S" on red, made up the first
group.
In honor of Pop Warner, the fourth
stunt showed a reddish-brown fox
smoking a cigarette, the curling of
the smoke being simulated by flipping

; of the cards. Perhaps the most popu
lar Stanford effort was the McCreery
, stunt, showing the Cardinal skipper
j poised to center the ball, with his
nickname, Mac, spelled out below.
A blue "C" was next shown above
' the Palo Alto tree, which grew to
' swallow up the "C."
California rooters greeted the Stan
ford stunt with tlie chant "Who's got
the axe?" to which they later re-
I joined "We've got the axe" when
J Stanford showed a brown bear with
a red axe implanted in his back,
j Stanford's stunts were among the i
! most elaborate ever staged by the
ltally Committee. Under the chair
manship of Bob Fraser, the members
| worked steadily all last week, making
i out instructions and placing the cards.
Yell Leader A1 Cass directed the
! stunts.
California showed Captain Coltrin
| with a blue shirt and a brown helmet
against a gold background; two'
| crossed chrysanthemums in blue on a
| gold field, bearing the letters "" and
: "S"; a pine tree on a gold back
ground, with an axe nearby—a quick
! change showing the axe hit and de
molish the tree; a large golden bear
with little red Indian —a change to
j show the bear about to gobble up the
! Indian.
