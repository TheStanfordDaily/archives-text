# BIG GAME PRESS BOX HOLDS HARD-BOILED, UNEMOTIONAL GROUP
## Radio Announcer, Separated From Reporters, Has College Spirit 
### 
In the press box at the Big Game there
are the reporters, the telegraph operators,
and all by himself, the radio announcer
for KPO.
Some of the reporters are hard-boiled
and unemotional. Others are intensely
interested in all that passes on the grid
below them, quite apart from the neces
sity that brings them to the game to get
a story.
KPO Gets College Spirit
Jack Keough, the radio announcer, is
partitioned off from all the others in a
special booth alone with his instruments
and equipment. In several parts of the
stadium he has microphones which con
vey to his radio audience the essence of
the spirit of the game. The great noise
that college boys and girls in the rooting
sections make is certainly splendid, some
people think; so Jack gets it all.
For the most part the telegraph oper
ators are a cold-blooded bunch. One of
these will sit with his elbow 011 the table,
his hand supporting his chin, while he
taps out the plays on the key, without
showing the least trace of interest or ex
citement. Stanford makes a touchdown
on a spectacular forty-yard pass! The
operator doesn't care, but he tells the
world about it, because that's what lie's
paid for.
Not All Editors Calm
"Where's that interference 1" This
from one of the sporting editors, who is
waving his arms wildly. Thereafter, he
hears of nothing but interference. The
others in the box will remind him every
minute or so about his break.
"Where's that interference!" they'll
yell at him until he feels the urge to
speak out loudly once more with some
phrase of a profane species. The staid,
stolid reporters who are with him enjoy
his antics.
Toward the end of the game, or after
it is over, a few of the men in the press
box get together in some corner and
listen to the results of an eastern game
as the results trickle in over the wire.
When there is nothing that would exhil
erate or enrapture a spectator at the game
taking place near them, this group
often shouts itself hoarse after getting
the low-down on Notre Dame's last
touchdown, or something like that.

citement. Stanford makes a touchdown
on a spectacular forty-yard pass! The
operator doesn't care, but he tells the
world about it, because that's what lie's
paid for.
Not All Editors Calm
"Where's that interference 1" This
from one of the sporting editors, who is
waving his arms wildly. Thereafter, he
hears of nothing but interference. The
others in the box will remind him every
minute or so about his break.
"Where's that interference!" they'll
yell at him until he feels the urge to
speak out loudly once more with some
phrase of a profane species. The staid,
stolid reporters who are with him enjoy
his antics.
Toward the end of the game, or after
it is over, a few of the men in the press
box get together in some corner and
listen to the results of an eastern game
as the results trickle in over the wire.
When there is nothing that would exhil
erate or enrapture a spectator at the game
taking place near them, this group
often shouts itself hoarse after getting
the low-down on Notre Dame's last
touchdown, or something like that.
