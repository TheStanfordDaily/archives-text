# NEW AERO DESIGNS TESTED IN RACING—REID INTERNATIONAL CONTESTS HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE PLAYER UNOFFICIALLY MAKES 5 MILES AN HOUR

"Air racing is the proving ground
for new principles in aero design as is
automobile racing the testing course
for new features in automobile de
sign," declared Elliott G. Reid, pro
fessor of Aerodynamics, when ques
tioned concerning the numerous air
races that have been held within the
last few months.
"It was with this thought in mind
that Jacques Schneider, a wealthy
Frenchman, in 1912 donated the beau
tiful Schneider International Seaplane
Trophy. He realized the tremendous
driving force that international com
petition could exert on aviation.
Speed Developed
"In the Schneider races held this
past summer in Venice, Italy, Lieu
tenant S. N. Webster, the English
winner, attained an average speed of
281.5 miles per hour. A few days
later, Major Deßernardi of Italy, who
was forced out of the race at the last
moment, did 298 miles per hour over
the same course.
"In the few short years since the
close of the Great War the speed of
the airplane has risen from 140 miles
per hour until now Lieutenant Alford
'Al' Williams has been reported to
have unofficially done 322 miles per
hour. This is faster than five miles
per minute, and at such a rate we
could travel from Stanford to San
Francisco in something less than five
minutes.
Three Factors Involved
"There are three main factors
which account for this almost incon
ceivable speed. The first deals with
engine improvements. The ratio of
power per unit of frontal projected
area has been greatly increased. This
speeds the plane up considerably. The
propellers are not connected directly
with the motor but are geared down to
a lower speed with a consequent gain
of efficiency.
"Perhaps the most important influ
ence is the manner in which the size
of the fuselage has been reduced. Ev
ery effort has been made to cut down
this part of the plane. The English
have done it to such a degree that
they claim that each fuselage is es
pecially shaped exactly to fit the pilot
who is to fly the slyp. The body is

| now practically a hollow shell witli
| out any cross supports. It is con
j structed of duraluminura which is as
j strong as steel and yet only one-third
j as heavy.
Venice Course Hard
"The course at Venice was particu
larly difficult in that it was so flat
that it necessitated two complete
turn-abouts 011 each lap which prob
! ably lowered the average speed. The
| English had been preparing for the
j event for over two years and as a
result they put a very wonderful ma
chine in the field. Next year the Uni
ted States will be in the same posi
tion in the point of time and if Lieu
| tenant Williams' performance can be
I taken as a sign, things look well for
! another victory for the U.S.A."
