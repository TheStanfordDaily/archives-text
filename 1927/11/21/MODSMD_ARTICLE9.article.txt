LONDON, Nov. 20. â€”Footsore but
joyous, "Emperor" A. J. Cook's army
of 248 hardy South Wales miners car
ried their unemployment cause to the
British capital today, marching into
Trafalgar Square at the end of their
184-mile hike to the tunes of "Bye,
I Bye, Blackbird" and the Communist
! "Internationale."
The march, organized by Cook, sec
retary of the Miners' Federation,
started at Newport, November 9, to
bring to the attention of the country,
Parliament, and Prime Minister Stan
ley Baldwin the fact that thousands of
miners have been jobless for 18
months. It ended in the heart of the
city at 3 p.m.
Aristocrats Watch March
On the sidewalks, thousands of
workers kept abreast of the miners,
parading through miles of fashionable
streets where speculative aristocrats
pressed their noses against window
panes to watch the procession of the
proletariat.
Arriving at Trafalgar Square, the
marchers scaled the base of the Nel
son Monument. They stook banked in
three tiers, like flowers around a cof
fin. The yellow lights of miners'
lamps, in the early darkness, added
to the picturesqueness of the spec
tacle.
Miners Cheer Leaders
! A few leaders harrangued the rain
j soaked crowd which cheered and
sang. They broke into the "Interna
tionale" when Cook began to sp&uk.
"This class war in which we are
engaged," said the indomitable
miners' leader, "must prevent capi
i talism from exploiting the miners and
the working classes,",
There were cheers. A few specta
j tors risked an almost inaudible boo.
They were met with fierce glares and
; found it the better part of wisdom to
take their leave.
The miners had drawn up a Magna
| Cliarta and were to present it to Cook
,at liunnymede, where King John
I signed the real Magna Cliarta. It was
j presented to the "Emperor" at Trafal
j gar Square instead, and read in the
J declamatory of the born orator. Run
nymede was not on the itinerary.
While owners still are doing their
utmost to regain the markets they
lost during last year's coal shortage,
foreign competitors, particularly of
Germany and Poland, appear to be
successfully holding their newly-won
markets.
