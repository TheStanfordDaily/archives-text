# NATIONALISM IS DISAPPROVED BY AUDIENCE VOTE
## Debate Is First of Series With Berkeley Women on Same Subject U.C. ARGUES NEGATIVE Reeder, Woodward, Tinsley Uphold Affirmative For Stanford 
### 
Nationalism was disapproved by an au
dicnce vote on the merits of the question
last night at the first of a series of two
women's intercollegiate debates between
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia in the Little Theatre on the sub
ject, "Resolved, That this house disap
proves of nationalism." The Votes showed
that twenty-seven persons changed their
opinions in favor of the affirmative and
nine in favor of the negative.
Dean Yost Presides
The affirmative was argued by the
Stanford team, consisting of Lorraine
Reeder, '29, Kathleen Woodward, '28, and
Ruth Tinsley, '29. The University of
California, represented by Eva Dalander,
'28, Martine Emert, '28, and Ruth Holli
day, '28, debated the negative. The de
bate was presided over by Dean Mary
Yost.
The main arguments advanced by the
affirmative were that nationalism, through
the promotion of economic greed and
rivalry, causes war and fosters the ex
ploitation of backward areas for its own
selfish ends; it hinders economic recuper
ation of the world after wars by demand
ing full payment of reparations, and
changes education to propaganda; it en
courages intellectual blindness, justifies
intrigue and treachery in the name of
diplomacy, and turns religion into a
means of self-justification.
Nationalism Progressive
The negative held that nationalism has
made for economic, cultural, and social
progress and will lead to international
peace.
The Stanford negative team will speak
at Berkeley tonight in the final debate
on this subject. Violet Crosbie, '31, Clara
R. Brecher, '28, and Jeanettc C. Owens,
'29, will represent Stanford and Martine
Emert, '28, Eleanor Noteware, '28, and
Lynn Roundtree, '30, California.
The Stanford teams were coached by
Stanley A. Weigel. Ewald T. Grether
was the coach for the University of
California.
