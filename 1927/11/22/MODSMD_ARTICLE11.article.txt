# PLOT TO KILL 'AL' CAPONE REVEALED IN CHICAGO COURT
## 
### (By United Press 
CHICAGO, Nov. 21.â€”A highly or
ganized and well-financed plot to as
sassinate "Scarface Al" Capone in
police court where he was to appear
on a vagrancy charge was uncovered
by police today and ten men were
arrested.
Capone has been dictator of the
Chicago underworld for more than
three years. Rebellion of his hirelings
was believed responsible for the mur
derous "beer war" of 1925-26.
Warfare Preparations Shown
The ramified plot to kill him, police
believed, indicates wide preparation
for renewal of open warfare in an at
tempt to dethrone the vice dictator.
There are plenty of facts to support
this opinion and it appeared tonight
that only the most unlooked-for de
velopments can prevent hostilities
with machine guns, sawed-off shot
guns, and automatic rifles.
Control of gambling and alcohol
distribution which Capone has sought,
was believed to be the prize for which
the rival factions are contending.
Chief of Detectives William O'Con
nor ordered arrest of every known
gangster.
Bulge Reveals Gun
A short time before Capone's case
was to be called in South Clark Street
Court, Sergeant James Ryan, O'Con
nor's chauffeur, noticed a suspicious
bulge in the pocket of one of the by
standers.
Arrest of three gunmen followed.
They were members of the gang
known to the police as the "Aiello
Mob," enemies of Capone.
Other gunmen, the United Press
learned through police sources, com
pletely surrounded the South Clark
Street court. They belonged to both
factions.
Capone had been appraised of the
plot, obtained a continuance in court
and sent members of his own "mob"
to shoot if need be.
All of the active gunmen, according
to police, were imported for the war
in prospect.
Violence Attempted on Chief
All three arrested were taken to
the detective chief's office. One of
them, Sam Martin, drew a revolver
and leveled it at the chief. He was
disarmed. The others identified them
selves as Louis Campana and Nick
Perry.
Earlier today, police raided a ma
chine gun nest in a respectable down
town hotel opposite a political hang
out which Capone and his aids are
said to frequent. The hotel room con
tained two machine guns, bombs,
small arms, and ammunitions.
