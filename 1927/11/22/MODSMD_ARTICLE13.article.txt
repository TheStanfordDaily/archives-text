## 
### 
"University authorities will take
steps to prosecute the pilots who en
dangered the lives of thousands of
spectators last Saturday when they
flew their planes over and about the
crowds at the stadium during the
game," Comptroller A. E. Roth said
yesterday.
"A few pilots were given permission
to land their planes on University
property behind the campus," he
says, "but none were authorized to
fly so close to the assemblage, in vio
lation of the law." ,
Several planes flew over the cam
pus during the game, some of which
maneuvered about the stadium for
several minutes. One plane, whose
name and number were easily read,
swooped down within two hundred
feet of the crowd surging from the
stadium after the game.
In a case similar to this last year,
a pilot who flew too low over the
crowds at the Nevada-Stanford game
was arrested, tried, and fined.
