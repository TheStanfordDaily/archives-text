# JUNIOR HOCKEY TEAM DOWNS FRESHMEN IN FIRST TITLE CONTEST
## 
### 
In the first championship game of
the season the junior hockey team
overwhelmed the freshmen yesterday
by a score of 10-0.
A strong forward line on the junior
team was the controlling factor. The
freshmen played well on defense, hut
as in the practice games, they did not
have enough drive to score when they
were near the junior goal.
Captain Thelma Patton starred on
the junior team, scoring six of the
ten goals. Louise Oestreich made two
goals and Editha Wright and Bar
bara Frick one each. Wright and
Matie McLaren both exhibited fine
stick-work.
Elizabeth West did splendid work
as freshman goal-keeper, though it
was the first time she has played
that position.
Sophomores meet the seniors this
afternoon in the second championship
match.
