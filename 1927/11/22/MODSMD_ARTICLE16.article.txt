## FROM UNITED PRESS GLOOMY DEAN SIDES WITH MODERNISTS IN SCIENCE GUILD SPEECH 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 21. â€”Gloomy Dean
Inge, boldly skiing with the modern
ists, believes "religions of the future
must get rid of their pre-scientiflc
survivals."
Delivering the third annual Norman
Loekyer lecture before the British
Science Guild on "Scientific Ethics,"
the Very Rev. William Ralph Inge,
Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, said to
day that "the theories which but
lately were openly accepted as tru
isms seem again in the melting pot."
"Science may be on the verge of
some momentous discovery," he add
ed, "which may bring weal or woe
to humanity."
Sides With Bishop Barnes
The Gloomy Dean outspokenly
sided with Bishop Barnes of Birming
ham, who is the center of the reli
gious controversy now raging in Eng

land over evolution and transubstan
tiation.
In an address studded with epi
grams, Inge said "mankind probably
will have a hundred thousand or per
haps a million more years in which
to try every possible and impossible
social experiment." His apparently
natural dourness, however, tinged this
bright observation with the remark
that "catastrophe is always possible."
"If there is a God he certainly is
not a capricious oriental sultan," Inge
said, "and he certainly is not the
head of the clerical profession!"
