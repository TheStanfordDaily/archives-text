# MACHINE GUNS TURNED UPON STRIKERS IN NEW COLORADO MINE FIGHT
## 
### 
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 21.—The
Woody history of industrial warfare
in Colorado reached a new and vio
lent chapter today when three men
were killed and two score wounded
in a battle between I.W.W. strikers

and state police officers near the little
mining town of Erie.
State troops, called out by Governor
W. H. Adams a few hours after the
clash, tonight moved into Erie and
assumed control of the situation.
Violence Comes Suddenly
The outbreak of mob violence came
with the suddenness of a lightning
bolt. Six hundred strikers, attempting
to picket the Columbine Mine —the
only northern Colorado mine that has
been operated since the walkout five
weeks ago—were met by a withering
machine gun fire from the squad of
officers stationed there to guard the
holdings.
Perhaps it never will be determined
who fired the first shot. Eyo witnesses
who reported the riot to Governor
Adams declared that the police, under
Louis Scherf, head of the State Law
Enforcement Bureau, fought with
their fists against overwhelming odds
until it became evident that they
would have to resort to revolvers to
save their lives.
