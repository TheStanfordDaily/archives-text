# FALL TRACK TRAINING BEGINS; FIELD EVENTS HAVE GOOD MATERIAL
## Practice in Anticipation of Olympic, Collegiate National Meets 
### 
Varsity trackmen are turning out
well for fall training this year in an
ticipation of the National and Inter
collegiate meets to be held in the
held in Amsterdam next summer.
Strong in Field Events
Coach Dink Templeton has excep
tionally good material to work with
in the field events. Such men as Ward
Edmonds, who by vaulting 13 ft. 6 in.,
placed second to Sabin Carr of Yale
last year in the 1.C.4-A. high jump
last year in the 1.C.4-A. meet, Bob
King, who placed first in the 1.C.4-A.
high jump event, and Eric Krenz,
who not only broke the Stan
ford-California freshman records in
the shot put and discus last year but
won first place in the National A.A.U.
meet, are championship timber over |
which Stanford is justly elated.
Other men who are practicing regu- j
larly in the field events are Bill Spar- j
ling, who placed third in the 1.C.4-A.
javelin throw last spring; Tom Joa
quin, javelin; Walt Hulsman, pole
vault; and Stew Way, discus and
shot.
Wesley Doe, who ran three years j
for the Illinois Athletic Club, and
Gibson Kingsbury, star freshman
sprinter last year, are expected to
take care of the dash events for the
varsity next spring. Both Alex Mc- i
Kinnon, who took third place in the !
i
1.C.4-A. mile run last year, and Bob j
Swain, varsity two-miler, are doing !
the daily grind in their respective j
events.
For the high hurdles Templeton has
Ross Nichols, who placed third at the I
1.C.4-A. meet last season, and for the
low timber-topping event he has
Johnny Lauritzen, who has proven
himself a plugger of the first degree.
Few Half-Milers
The middle-distance events are ap
parently a problem to Templeton. He
has changed Jack Dales and Tom
: McGuire, last year 440 men, to the
j SSO-yard run this fall. Also Johnny
! Morrison, who set a new Stanford-
I California freshman record in the 440,
|
i has been changed to the 880. \v nether
| Dink's idea for doing this is only to
J have the men develop more wind by
| running the longer race or whether it
! means a permanent change, is a ques-
I tion worthy of consideration.

the daily grind in their respective j
events.
For the high hurdles Templeton has
Ross Nichols, who placed third at the I
1.C.4-A. meet last season, and for the
low timber-topping event he has
Johnny Lauritzen, who has proven
himself a plugger of the first degree.
Few Half-Milers
The middle-distance events are ap
parently a problem to Templeton. He
has changed Jack Dales and Tom

j SSO-yard run this fall. Also Johnny

Varsity trackmen are turning out
well for fall training this year in an
ticipation of the National and Inter
collegiate meets to be held in the
held in Amsterdam next summer.
Strong in Field Events
Coach Dink Templeton has excep
tionally good material to work with
in the field events. Such men as Ward
Edmonds, who by vaulting 13 ft. 6 in.,
placed second to Sabin Carr of Yale
last year in the 1.C.4-A. high jump
last year in the 1.C.4-A. meet, Bob
King, who placed first in the 1.C.4-A.
high jump event, and Eric Krenz,
who not only broke the Stan
ford-California freshman records in
the shot put and discus last year but
won first place in the National A.A.U.
meet, are championship timber over |
which Stanford is justly elated.
Other men who are practicing regu- j
larly in the field events are Bill Spar- j
ling, who placed third in the 1.C.4-A.
javelin throw last spring; Tom Joa
quin, javelin; Walt Hulsman, pole
vault; and Stew Way, discus and
shot.
Wesley Doe, who ran three years j
for the Illinois Athletic Club, and
Gibson Kingsbury, star freshman
sprinter last year, are expected to
take care of the dash events for the
varsity next spring. Both Alex Mc- i
Kinnon, who took third place in the !
