PASADENA, Nov. 21.—(United
Press)— Until the results of the
eastern Thanksgiving football
games are known the definite op
ponent to play Stanford here in
the Rose Bowl on January 2 is
still unknown, it was announced.
While Stanford authorities wish
to select the University of Pitts
burgh, the invitation to the East
ern team will be sent to Washing
ton and Jefferson if the Pitt
Panthers falter Thursday.

For the third time in four years
Stanford will represent the West in
the annual East-West Tournament of
Roses game at Pasadena's Rose Bowl
on New Year's Day, the Faculty Ath
letic Committee sitting with the
Board of Athletic Control announced
last night.
U.P. Probable Opponent
The Cardinals' opponent will most
probably be the University of Pitts
burgh and the game will be played on
Monday, January 2. Physical head
quarters will be established at Pasa
dena tomorrow. A1 Masters announces
that ticket applications will he ready
for distribution as soon as possible.
A'lumni of both schools, stadium sub
scribers, scrip holders, and students
will get the first chance for tickets.
Other teams, among them the Army
and Navy, were approached by Stan
ford for a post-season game for De
cember 10 to be played here. The only
dates convenient for the Eastern
schools would conflict with the Cali
fornia-Pennsylvania and the Shriners'
East-West games.
Pop Plans Training
Pop Warner submitted to the Fac
j ulty Athletic Committee a satisfac
tory plan which calls for no practice
| this week, practice three times a week
■ lor the next two weeks, and inten
i sive training to start December 21.
Five years ago Stanford played the
j Panthers at Pasadena and lost 16 to
7 before a crowd of GOOO. At that
time Pop Warner was Pittsburgh
coach, while under him was All-Amer
ican Jock Sutherland, now mentor at
the Eastern institution.
Although the team is the strongest
that Pitt has had in years, and has a
more impressive record than either
| Washington and Jefferson or Georgia,
| Coast fans would like to see the W.
and J. team play again in California.
The Presidents are still possibilities,
i for Pittsburgh must still run the
| gauntlet of Penn State. Georgia is
the only undefeated and untied team,
in the country, and holds a victory
over Yale, but has played an other
' wise easy schedule.
