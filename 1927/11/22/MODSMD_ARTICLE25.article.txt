# East, West, and the Dollar Sign

### 
Stanford last night, acting through the Board of Athletic Control,
accepted the invitation to play as the Western team in the annual Rose
Bowl tournament. This action, despite two defeats at the hands of small
college elevens, will be touted as an intersectional grid game of East-
West importance. The members of the squad have voted as favoring
such a contest.
1 hat the Board of Athletic Control can well use the money to be
received from the gate receipts of this game is common knowledge. The
new $102,000 office building and financial obligations on Branner Hall
are still matters of concern. Stanford's action in accepting the Rose
Bowl tournament, then, is but a means of lessening these obligations.
There is nothing of a highly commendable nature in the acceptance
of the Rose Bowl game; the whole game is placed on a semi-commercial
basis. Stanford, even though it wins the Coast Conference, is not, in
our opinion, in a position to accept the game with any other under
standing than that it is doing so for financial reasons.
1 he New Year's Day game is becoming an annual money-making
affair for one afternoon's amusement of thousands of non-collegiate
spectators. Stanford s student football players, after a season of play
ing for the amateur sportsmanship of American college football, will
now help to advertise southern California and thereby boost the price
of real estate there.
