# "For Women Only"

A1 Masters has explained the mix-up that occurred in the women's
rooting section seats at the Big Game. He has explained it in what seems
to be a very satisfactory and logical manner. The trouble comes in the
fact that a number of men gave their rooters' tickets to "imports" who
occupied the seats which should rightfully have belonged to Stanford
women.
1 here were enough seats reserved for women rooters, says Jake Irwin,
ticket manager. Eighty-five of Stanford's "Five Hundred" did not return
applications for rooters' tickets while 450 seats were reserved. And still
the section was filled to overflowing—due, according to Masters, to the
giving away of tickets to women outside the University.
Another evil to be noted in this regard is the admission of persons to
the men's rooting section who do not possess rooters' tickets. The Rally
Committee tried to check up on this but it could not quite handle the
matter. The person who gets a seat in "V" (the "section God forgot") is
willing to take the chance of squeezing into the regular rooting section.
When a number of persons do that confusion results.
To solve the situation in future Big Games, the Daily suggests that
women's rooting section tickets be so marked, so that a woman may not
be accorded a seat unless she has one of these special tickets. Secondly,
because the reserving of special seats would practically kill the rooting
section for men, the Daily suggests that for Big Games there be but one
Entrance to the rooting section—roped or fenced off, if need be—and that
each person admitted to that section be forced to show that he has a
looter's ticket.
