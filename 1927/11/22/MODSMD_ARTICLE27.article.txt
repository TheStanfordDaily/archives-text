# The 						Campus Truck Evil
## 
### 
\\ ith all of the new signs placed at street intersections, the campus
has taken on the appearance of a well-organized city, busy with the traffic
problem. I hough Student observance of the signs still leaves much to be
desired, there is still one greater evil which should receive serious atten
tion from the authorities. Campus trucks of the laundries, cleaners, meat!
markets, grocery stores, continue to run wild with an utter disregard for
the new signs.
Many of these nuisance traffic violations occur in the morning while
students are at classes and the streets of the campus are comparatively
lightly traveled. 1 his fact, however, does not mitigate the offenses. In
some cases these offending trucks are driven by students. Violations on'
their part will be handled after December 1 by the Men's Council under
the new plan of student control of the automobile traffic problem. Other
violators should be reported to civil authorities.
Unless this menace through these truck violations is lessened, the
Daily will post men at intersections to watch for violations which will be'
reported to the proper authorities. In planning to handle student-driven
cars, it is not fitting that other violators should go scot-free at a rattling
pace past the "Stop" signs.
