The Editor, Sir:
The past two years have seen the
instigation ot' good-will assemblies
among U.S.C., Stanford, and U.C.
Some skeptics have been pessimistic
as to their value, hut an incident of
last Saturday calls to our attention
the real worth and results oi such
efforts.
During the process of getting the
red balloons filled we ran short of
helpers. At that time the U.C. band
was assembled in the Basketball Pa
vilion, and when they heard of our
predicament several of the band mem
bers came to our aid, working hard
and fast that our welcome stunt for
the Stanford football team might be
finished in time. If such co-operation
isn't an outward manifestation of
friendly spirit existing between two
competitive schools, what is?
And yet we don't have to leave our
own campus to find co-operation and
a spirit of helpfulness. Among the
steadiest of workers we had was a
small group of about eight freshman
men who volunteered their services
and "stuck by their gas tanks" even
when others left for lunch. The as
sistance of these men was very much
appreciated by Women's "S" Society
and the Rally Committee, who take
this means of thanking them and all
taose who helped with the filling of
the balloons.
CAROLYN SHEPARD,
President "S" Society.
The Editor, Sir:
It has come to my attention that
the Board of Athletic Control Ticket
Department has been criticized be
cause many of the Stanford women
were forced to sit in the aisles owing
to the fact that their rooting section
was filled to overflowing at the Stan
ford-California football game last
Saturday. This criticism is absolutely
unwarranted and unfair. We have had
the same trouble for the past two or
three years. There were absolutely no
more tickets sold in the women's
rooting section or elsewhere in the
stadium, than there were seats. The
difficulty arose through the fact that
a number of men rooters gave their
tickets in the men's rooting section
to women outside the University. Na
turally these women were not allowed
in the men's rooting section and
crowded into seats in the women's
rooting section. There were no va
cant seats in the men's rooting sec
tion because the men who gave away
their rooters' tickets gained entrance ;
to the stadium by means of one of
their other two tickets, donned their I
rooters' hats, and took seats in the
rooting section. In the future, I am
afraid that we will be forced to com
pel each man rooter to sit in the j
exact seat for which his ticket calls ,
in order to alleviate this difficulty. ;
Women who present men's rooters'!
tickets will doubtless be denied ad- 1
mittance to the stands. In the past, :
we have allowed the men rooters to !
take their seats anywhere in the j
rooting section but I fear that we will j
have to discontinue this practice, in '
fairness to the women of the Univer- j
sity.

An opportunity to do honor to |
Thomas Carlyle is presented during
the next few days. The Trustees of
i

Carlyle's House, 24 Cheyne Row, Chel
sea, have announced their need of an
endowment fund from the income of
which they may meet overhead
charges incidental to maintaining as
a memorial museum this famous Lon
don residence of the great English
writer. A poster in the first-floor cor
ridor of the English-History-Econo
nomics building conveys more defi
nite information and a roll of noted
supporters of the appeal. I have been
appointed the representative of the
Stanford Department of English to re
ceive contributions from this com
munity. Every modern university,
every progressive community owes
much to Thomas Carlyle; it will be
but acknowledging that debt in an
appropriate way if a substantial sum
can be forwarded from here.

The past two years have seen the
instigation ot' good-will assemblies
among U.S.C., Stanford, and U.C.
Some skeptics have been pessimistic
as to their value, hut an incident of
last Saturday calls to our attention
the real worth and results oi such
efforts.
During the process of getting the
red balloons filled we ran short of
helpers. At that time the U.C. band
was assembled in the Basketball Pa
vilion, and when they heard of our
predicament several of the band mem
bers came to our aid, working hard
and fast that our welcome stunt for
the Stanford football team might be
finished in time. If such co-operation
isn't an outward manifestation of
friendly spirit existing between two
competitive schools, what is?
And yet we don't have to leave our
own campus to find co-operation and
a spirit of helpfulness. Among the
steadiest of workers we had was a
small group of about eight freshman
men who volunteered their services
and "stuck by their gas tanks" even
when others left for lunch. The as
sistance of these men was very much
appreciated by Women's "S" Society
and the Rally Committee, who take
this means of thanking them and all
taose who helped with the filling of
the balloons.

It has come to my attention that
the Board of Athletic Control Ticket
Department has been criticized be
cause many of the Stanford women
were forced to sit in the aisles owing
to the fact that their rooting section
was filled to overflowing at the Stan
ford-California football game last
Saturday. This criticism is absolutely
unwarranted and unfair. We have had
the same trouble for the past two or
three years. There were absolutely no
more tickets sold in the women's
rooting section or elsewhere in the
stadium, than there were seats. The
difficulty arose through the fact that
a number of men rooters gave their
tickets in the men's rooting section
to women outside the University. Na
turally these women were not allowed
in the men's rooting section and
crowded into seats in the women's
rooting section. There were no va
cant seats in the men's rooting sec
tion because the men who gave away
their rooters' tickets gained entrance ;
to the stadium by means of one of
their other two tickets, donned their I
rooters' hats, and took seats in the
rooting section. In the future, I am
