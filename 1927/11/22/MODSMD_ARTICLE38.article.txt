### 
Each year the American-German
Students Exchange offers fellowships
in German universities to American
students. This year's quota has been
filled. Professor William A. Cooper
of the German department announces
that applications for next year may
be made soon.
Both men and women are eligible;
the fellowships, which are given in
various fields of study, cover tuition,
board and lodging, and are tenable
for one year. The candidate must
have a working knowledge of German
and must have attended an American
university for at least two years.
Preference is given to those between
twenty and thirty years of age.
