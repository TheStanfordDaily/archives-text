# DECEMBER 10 IS TENTATIVE DATE FOR SOPHOMORE PLAY
## 
### 
December 10th lias been tentatively
chosen as the date for the sophomore
play, "Expressing Willie." Although
this change destroys the traditional
continuity of sophomore week, it was
found necessary since "The Great
Necker," starring Taylor Holmes, will j
play in Palo Alto on the night of the |
original date, December 3. As this
will be the only performance on the
peninsula of this play, Dramatic
Council decided to change the sopho
more farce date in order that students
might have the opportunity of wit
nessing both productions.
After an exceptionally long and in- [
tensive series of tryouts, the cast of j
eleven have been definitely chosen,
and work upon the play is going i
along. Patricia Rhodes, as Minnie '
Whitcomb, and Paul Speegle, as
Willie Smith, will play the leads.
The rest of the cast are: Mrs.
Smith, Edith Jayne; Taliafero, Stan

Mullin; George Cadwaller, Alfred
Leonhardt; Dolly Cadwaller, Helen
Thompson; Frances Sylvester, Eda
I Lord. Although this will be the first
appearance on the campus stage of
many of the members of the cast, the
j group is less inexperienced than in
j the case of the majority of sophomore
plays. Several of the cast have worked
with amateur theatricals.
Mullin played John Ceasar in "John
Ferguson" last fall, appeared in the
last "Football Gaieties" as Menelaus,
in "Helen Gone," and played the part
of the war-crazed Lieutenant Moore
1 in the Pendragon production of "What
> Price Glory," in Palo Alto last spring.
: Speegle will be remembered for work
I in "The Swan," last winter; as the
! son of the earl in "The Elusive Earl"
in the "Football Gaieties"; and as
the stuttering bell-hop in "Wicked
William," one of the most popular
comedy hits in that play.
