Athletically, Stanford has much to
be thankful for at this season. Of
course the Big Game victory is the
paramount thing to which we can
dedicate the Thanksgiving turkey,
but while we are being thankful we
should breathe a sigh of satisfaction
that we haven't a Harvard for our
chief rival. Fancy playing a big game
with four-to-one odds on your team!
That is what Yale faced Saturday—
an eleven almost unanimously chosen
to hold the sack.
INDIVIDUALISM VS. FOOTBALL
Harvard's defeat is attributed
to the predominant individualis
tic sentiment at Cambridge. The
student body thinks athletics are
tosh, and the graduate students
coming from other more robust
institutions usually root for the
visiting team rather than for the
Crimson.
It is beginning to look as if
Harvard will have to abolish its
lower division, as that apparent
ly is the surest panacea for ane
mic athletics. Or the Hearst pa
pers might be subsidized to run a
campaign against individualism
as anti-American or anti-Har
vardian.
The Cardinal varsity has voted that
it is willing to play a post-season
game. California is to meet Pennsyl
vania, and it is good news to hear
that as good an eleven as that which
skinned the Bear last week will not
yet be relegated to the 1928 Quad and
history. The Tournament of Roses
annual game is proposed, but if we
remember correctly the" prevailing
opinion last January 2 was, "Never
again in the Rose Bowl."
Why isn't an effort made to get
a Big Ten team as an intersec
tional rival for a game to be
played here during the holidays?
The stadium would draw a big
crowd New Year's Day, for the
Cardinals are riding on a wave of
popularity owing to the flashing
manner in which they finished
the conference season. Minnesota
perhaps would be the best choice,
although Illinois is at the top of
the Big Ten list. It seems to us
that either of these teams would
have more prestige to bring along
than Pittsburgh or W. and J.
BIFF TO PLAY AGAIN
Biff Hoffman, thanks to the eligibil
ity rules, will be able to play next
year for Stanford. If, next season, he
is as consistent and brilliant as in
his performance at the Big Game, he
ought to be a cinch for all-American.
Two years ago, Nevers played a stel
lar game against California such as
Hoffman did, but he was fully ex
pected to do as well as he did, while
Biff was not counted on to perform
so well. Which makes the satisfaction
therein the greater.

Crimson.
It is beginning to look as if
Harvard will have to abolish its
lower division, as that apparent
ly is the surest panacea for ane
mic athletics. Or the Hearst pa
pers might be subsidized to run a
campaign against individualism
as anti-American or anti-Har
vardian.
The Cardinal varsity has voted that
it is willing to play a post-season
game. California is to meet Pennsyl
vania, and it is good news to hear
that as good an eleven as that which
skinned the Bear last week will not
yet be relegated to the 1928 Quad and
history. The Tournament of Roses
annual game is proposed, but if we
remember correctly the" prevailing
opinion last January 2 was, "Never
again in the Rose Bowl."
Why isn't an effort made to get
a Big Ten team as an intersec
tional rival for a game to be
played here during the holidays?
The stadium would draw a big
crowd New Year's Day, for the
Cardinals are riding on a wave of
popularity owing to the flashing
manner in which they finished
the conference season. Minnesota
perhaps would be the best choice,
although Illinois is at the top of
the Big Ten list. It seems to us
that either of these teams would
have more prestige to bring along
than Pittsburgh or W. and J.
BIFF TO PLAY AGAIN
Biff Hoffman, thanks to the eligibil
ity rules, will be able to play next
year for Stanford. If, next season, he
is as consistent and brilliant as in
his performance at the Big Game, he
ought to be a cinch for all-American.
Two years ago, Nevers played a stel
lar game against California such as
Hoffman did, but he was fully ex
pected to do as well as he did, while
Biff was not counted on to perform
so well. Which makes the satisfaction
therein the greater.
Athletically, Stanford has much to
be thankful for at this season. Of
course the Big Game victory is the
paramount thing to which we can
dedicate the Thanksgiving turkey,
but while we are being thankful we
should breathe a sigh of satisfaction
that we haven't a Harvard for our
chief rival. Fancy playing a big game
with four-to-one odds on your team!
That is what Yale faced Saturday—
an eleven almost unanimously chosen
to hold the sack.
INDIVIDUALISM VS. FOOTBALL
Harvard's defeat is attributed
to the predominant individualis
tic sentiment at Cambridge. The
student body thinks athletics are
tosh, and the graduate students
coming from other more robust
institutions usually root for the
visiting team rather than for the
Crimson.
