# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Having watched Lloyd Thomas
star for the University of Southern
California in three games on the Pa
cific Coast this season, and with vi
sions of John and Harry Thomas'
smashing play on mid-Western grid
irons for Chicago in '22, '28, and '24
still fresh in my memory, it was no
distinct shock to learn that they, as
well as Max Thomas, a substitute
back on the U.S.C. team, are all
brothers. Princeton had its six Poes,
but probably no single family ever
was before represented by a quartet
of ball-carriers as brilliant as these
"Tearing Thomases."
John Thomas was named on Walter
Camp's 1922 All-American team, main
ly because that great critic happened
to be present at the Chicago-Prince
ton game of that year, and was great
ly impressed by John's superb play
ing. His vicious plunges tore the

Princeton line to shreds and scored
three touchdowns. John gained three
hundred yards in that game, and often
carried the ball eight and ten times
in succession.
Harry came along a year after
John and the two boys played to
gether in 1922 and '23. Harry was
probably a better all-around player
than John, but not such a great ball
carrier. He was a deadly tackier and
a finished defensive player. Max
played on the freshman team at Chi
cago in the fall of 1923, and a year
later the Thomases moved from
Jamestown, North Dakota, to River
side, California.
Lloyd made Cliff Herd's freshman
team at U.S.C., and in 1926 starred in
the Trojan's great 27 to 0 victory over
California. In the Stanford game he
made a 46-yard run to a touchdown.
He has been used more as an inter

fering back this year, and works
finely with Saunders in clearing the
way for Captain Drury or Don Wil
liams, who get all the glory.
