A Ford roadster belonging to
Charles West, and a typewriter, were
added yesterday to the list of articles
stolen from the campus last Saturday
during the game. These additions in
crease the total value of the thefts to
an amount in excess of ยง4000.
University officials, who are co
operating with George Lyle, sheriff
of Santa Clara county, in an effort
to recover the stolen property, are
working on several new clues, but
have refused to divulge any further
information until arrests are made.
