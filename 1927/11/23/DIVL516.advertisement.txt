students of Spanish would welcome a first-

able reading practice at the same time that

Stanford books literature and literary history. When he
assumed the editorship of the STANFORD
SPANISH SERIES he planned the first number of the Series
to that purpose. The interest which the book has already
evoked proves the soundness of his judgment.
LECCIONES DE LITERATURA ESPANOLA
By Aurelio M. Espinosa
"La lectura de Lecciones de literatura espanola me ha
producido excelente impresion. Me parece un libro claro,
sencillo y perfectamente adecuado al publico a que el autor
lo destina. Presenta en forma amena y agradable un cuadro
complete de los principales autores y obras de la literatura
espanola sin que falte nada esecial de lo que los estudiantes
de los primeros grados de espanol deben aprender de estas
materias." Tomas Navarro Tomas, of the Centro de Estudios
Historicos (Madrid).

IVbat can I earn in the
bond business ?
FOR young men about to graduate, thinking about the
bond business as a career, that is a natural question. To
answer it, Yankee-fashion,"How hard and how intelligently
are you willing to work? Would you be willing to put in a
year or two with just fair earnings for the probability of a
much better income after you are well started ?"
The financial possibilities of a college man in the bond
business are limited only by his own capacities. One who has
been a good student and a good "mixer" in college, if lie
applies himself, will find success more quickly than lie would
in many other occupations. As a rule, he reaches a satisfac
tory earning power earlier in life than does the average man
in one of the professions. And his earnings increase as he
gains experience and standing in the business.
Besides the subject of earnings there are other questions
you should settle in determining your interest in and your
fitness for the bond business. To help you in your decision
we have printed a pamphlet, "The Bond Business as an
Occupation for College Men." If you would like a copy,
