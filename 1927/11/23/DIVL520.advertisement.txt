Five minutes to play
The score 21-0 against dear old Siwash. Brown, the great
est Siwash quarter-back, gets the ball. He rushes down the
field for a touchdown. But one isn't enough. He makes
another . . . another . . . another . . . until the score
stands 28-21. And Siwash wins. 50,000 people go crazy.
They yell themselves hoarse. Brown marries the girl and
is now mining fire-proof coal in Labrador.
Well! What of it ? Brownie, his girl and all the bunch
drank "Canada Dry" after the game, the coolest, most
thirst-quenching ginger ale they'd ever tasted. Uecause
it contains only pure Jamaica ginger, it has a delightful
flavor . . . tang to it . . . dryness . . . sparkle. Because
it blends well with other beverages.
Drink "Canada Dry!" The Champagne of Ginger
Ales. When your friends drop in . . . on every occasion.
