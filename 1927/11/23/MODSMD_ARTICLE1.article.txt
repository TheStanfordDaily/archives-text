# VARSITY CAGE SQUAD CUT TO TWENTY MEN
## Six From Last Year's Team To Form Nucleus for Stanford Outfit FEW GRIDMEN PROMISING 1927 Season's Freshmen to Add Strength to Hunt's Basketball Crew 
### Merle Emry 
While Stanford has been following
the doings of Pop Warner and his
football team, during the past month
and a half some forty-odd men have
been holding serious basketball prac
tice under the direction of Coach
Husky Hunt and George A. Dewey.
Up to date there are twenty men
left on the squad—men w'io have
been drilled and re-drilled in the
fundamentals of the game—passing,
dribbling, and pivoting. These players
show now about the same class of
basketball as the team of last year
finished with.
Material Experienced
Although Price, David, Jayred, and
Anderson will not be in the line-up
for the Cardinals, there is still plenty
of material left and more coming up.
Bryant, forward, Biaggini, guard,
McCandless, Clark, Christ, and Dob
son, forwards, form the nucleus for
this year's squad.
Elliot, a transfer from the New
Mexico Military institute, looks like
good center timber. Jack Stewart,
Harry Berg, captain of the Babe squad
last year, llotliert, Thompson, and
Simkins, each have had one year's
experience under Hunt.
Due to the fact that this year's
squad is more advanced than others
of previous seasons, not many of the
men who are out for football and who
come out for practice are expected to
develop into varsity calibre. Vincenti,
star guard of last year, has been try
ing to straddle both football and bas
ketball, and as he has plenty of speed
and ability, he may make it.
Competition Keen
Besides the preliminary cut of last
week, men who can not stand the
pac will be dropped from time to time
until Hunt gets his squad down to a
workable size. Competition has been
keen, and it will take both ability
and hard work to survive.
