# AZURE-EYED RALLY SONGSTER WILL BE COTILLION VOCALIST
## 
### 
Stanford roughs, who felt
heart tremors at the Big Game
Rally on seeing a certain blonde
blues singer from San Jose, will
be thrilled again at the Sopho
more Cotillion on December 2
when this same azure-eyed vo
calist is to hold forth with the
Brooks-Worthington Hotel Sainte
Claire orchestra.
Bernice Burkhardt, the young
lady in question, was the hit
of the evening last week, and
very nearly put such things as
football players and coaches into
the background. She is well
known on the peninsula and
points south, having sung all last
summer at Capitola, popular
beach resort near Santa Cruz.
