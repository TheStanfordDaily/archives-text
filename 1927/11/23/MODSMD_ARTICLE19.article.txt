# TICKET APPLICATIONS FOR PASADENA GAME IN MAIL NEXT WEEK
## Students Will Be Allowed Four Preferred Seats, Rooter's Ticket 
### 
Applications for tickets for the New
Year's game at Pasadena will be sent
to alumni and scrip holders on De
cember 1, according to J. C. Irwin,
Manager of the Ticket Department.
Students will call for theirs on the
same day at the Old Union. On ac
count of the limited time, applications
must be received by the Stanford of
fices in Pasadena by 6 o'clock on the
evening of December 12. Addressed
envelopes will be enclosed with the
applications.
Students, Block "S" men, scrip
holders, and paid or non-paid alumni
will all be allowed the same number
of tickets. Four seats will be allotted
in the preferred section, and as many
in the end sections as are desired.
Students will also be allowed one
rooter's ticket. The enlargement of
the Rose Bowl may change the prices
in some of the sections, but the pre-!
ferred seats will be $5, end sections j
will be $2.50, and rooters' tickets will I
be $1.50. After all Stanford applica-j
tions are filled, seats will be sold to
the public.
A plan similar to that used at the
Alabama-Stanford game last New
Year's day will be used again this
time to frustrate the sale of rooters's
tickets to those who are not students.
A large number of people last year
were caught when holders of the
rooters' pasteboards were made to
validate them at the gate just before
entering the stadium. Five students
were present with bawl-outs, and each
rooter was asked his name, living
quarters, and scholastic standing as
I printed.
