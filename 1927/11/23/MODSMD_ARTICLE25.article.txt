# PHI PANTHERS HAVE EDGE ON WESTERN TRIP
## Easterners' 249 Points to Opponents' 20 Show Team's Power ONE TIE MARS RECORD Win From Penn State Will Clinch Invitation for New Year's Game 
### Milton Silverman 
Pittsburgh's Panther eleven is defi
nitely given the edge over all other
Eastern teams now under considera
tion as the East's representative in
the annual Tournament of lloses
game at Pasadena.
Panther Team Strong
Regarded as one of the strongest
teams outside of the Big Ten, the
Panthers have only a tie with Wash
ington and Jefferson to mar their im
pressive record. Thiel, Carnegie, and
West Virginia have all bowed with
top-heavy scores to the Pitt men.
Drake, which lost 32-0 to Notre Dame
last Saturday lost by the same score
to the Panthers earlier in the season.
Pitt's 21-13 victory over Nebraska
in an intersectional contest has
brought the Panthers into definite fa
vor, while their 249 points scored
against their opponents' 20 is also for
bidding.
Sport writers in the East were al
ready crooning over the possibility of
seeing Gibby Welch, Pitt star and cap
tain, prominently mentioned for Ail-
American honors, stack up against
Morley Drury of U.S.C. Other football
critics were filled with joy at the
prospect of a fight between Bill Amos
of Washington and Jefferson, and Biff
Hoffman.
Pittsburgh Is Favorite
Pittsburgh, however, seems to he
the logical opponent for Stanford,
while the Presidents and the Trojans
will probably be spared the dubious
honor of a New Year's game. The
possibility of seeing Booth, Pitt full,
and Welch play against Hoffman,
Hyland, and Wilton will nevertheless
have no small effect on the ticket
sale.
The Panthers, say the Tournament
committee, need only to beat Penn
State tomorrow to cinch their invita
tion. The Nittany Lions and the Pan
thers, not being on any too friendly
] terms, are doped to stage a great
' battle, with the Lions banking on the
; efforts of Roepke, third highest
' scorer in the East, and the Panthers
| on Welch.
