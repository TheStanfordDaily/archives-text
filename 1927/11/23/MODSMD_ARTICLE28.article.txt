We find that a combination of seemingly laudable and commendable
aims underlies the action which brought about Stanford's acceptance of
the East-West game invitation accorded it by the Tournament of Roses
committee. This becomes apparent when one listens to the statements
explaining just why Stanford accepted the invitation.
The Faculty Athletic Committee felt that Stanford was being accorded
a signal honor by receiving the invitation; that under the schedule of
practice outlined by Pop Warner the scholastic difficulties would be les
sened ; that it would be of financial benefit to the University. The Board
of Athletic Control, recognizing the financial worth of the project, like
wise sanctioned the acceptance. In view of contemplated improvements,
the University will benefit from the game. »
The Rose Bowl committee feels that it is doing a big thing for Southern
California by sponsoring these East-West games. Public demand war
rants them, it is said. That's just where the catch comes: if PUBLIC
DEMAND didn't warrant the game, there would be a financial loss, and,
hence, no game.
The chief objection to this game lies in the fact that the Tournament
of Roses committee is making it Jin annual affair, with a promise of finan
cial benefits to the universities which play in the East-West tilt. Without
technically professionalizing Coast football, the sport is placed more on a
financial basis than seems to be warranted in amateur athletics. East-West
clashes should not be annual affairs; they should be staged only when
occasioned by the existence of two outstanding powerful teams. The strug
gle, then, will retain some of the characteristics of what should be the
truly collegiate sport —amateur American football.
