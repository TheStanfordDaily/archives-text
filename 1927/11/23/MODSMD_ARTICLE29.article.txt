The Grandmothers, by Glenway Wes-j
cott. Harpers. 1927.
This Harper prize novel appears to
my attention and as I recall it is far
the best written of any of the past
Harper prize novels, and it is at the
same time the least appealing to the
general public. Glenway Wescott, the ;
author, is a name very few have heard '
and inevitably his name will be
known to thousands. It will be inter
esting to see just what such a prize
and fame will do for such a writer
as Crjenway Wescott, who is, even in
this book, still a writer for the few, j
while his booh pmy well appeal to the
many.
The picture of pioneer Wisconsin
Is drawn in the details of fact. There ,
is something strange about "The
Grandmothers" that you don't realize j
until after you have finished it and
begin thinking about it as a whole.
There is no psychologizing about it.
More power to it. It is the history of
a plain midwestern family of farmers.
This "family portrait" as he very ac
curately calls it, is, in its complete
effect, a novel; for it has become
recognized by now that the fiction
side may lay aside conventional
drama, and try to create the spirit
of an age—as for instance, "The For
syth e Saga."
Glenway Wescott has taken the
"Tower" family and by making, as it |
were, the old family album into a
series of character sketches and
stories, has reproduced average rural
life in midwestern America from the
days before the Civil War up to now.
With what imaginative vigor he has
done it, with what an eye for the es
sential characteristics of our grand
mothers and grandmothers, our great
uncles and aunts —I can only leave
for the reader the rest —for the book
deserves to be read by all to whom
America's past—and future —mean
anything.
It is in characterization and the ,

achievement of a definite atmosphere
that the book excels. It is not the
great American novel because I feel
that the great American novel must
be one of great climaxes. But Glen
way Wescott may live to write the
great American novel. He has the
imagination, the poetic slant on char
acter, the ability to tell a story, and
many of the requisites that mark a
genius in fiction.
As a novel "The Grandmothers"
breaks every rule of technique ever
made. It is just different from any
novel that has ever been written.
There is a future in this young man.
Let such a fundamentally creative
mind as Glenway Wescott's take on a
forthright dramatic fire, and there is
no telling how far he will go.—E.L.S.

1925, and since then none has been
held. The practice has died out of
existance.

It is in characterization and the ,

achievement of a definite atmosphere
that the book excels. It is not the
great American novel because I feel
that the great American novel must
be one of great climaxes. But Glen

great American novel. He has the
imagination, the poetic slant on char
acter, the ability to tell a story, and
many of the requisites that mark a
genius in fiction.
As a novel "The Grandmothers"
breaks every rule of technique ever

Let such a fundamentally creative

forthright dramatic fire, and there is
no telling how far he will go.—E.L.S.

Question: How are Encina sponsors
chosen, and how are they paid?
Answer by Deon George B. Culver:
A list of names, selected by the Dean
]of Men, is submitted to President
Wilbur, who chooses the ones for the
position. No applications are made,
and it is considered a great honor to
jbe appointed. Sponsors do not pay
room rent.
Question: Will the all-University
masque ball be given this year? If
not, v/hy not? If so, what date will it
be given, and by whom will it be
sponsored?
Answer by Murray Draper: The last
masque carnival was held in spring,
1925, and since then none has been
held. The practice has died out of
existance.
The Grandmothers, by Glenway Wes-j
cott. Harpers. 1927.
This Harper prize novel appears to
my attention and as I recall it is far
the best written of any of the past
Harper prize novels, and it is at the
same time the least appealing to the
general public. Glenway Wescott, the ;
author, is a name very few have heard '
and inevitably his name will be
known to thousands. It will be inter
esting to see just what such a prize
and fame will do for such a writer
as Crjenway Wescott, who is, even in
this book, still a writer for the few, j
while his booh pmy well appeal to the
many.
The picture of pioneer Wisconsin
Is drawn in the details of fact. There ,
is something strange about "The
Grandmothers" that you don't realize j
until after you have finished it and
begin thinking about it as a whole.
There is no psychologizing about it.
More power to it. It is the history of
a plain midwestern family of farmers.
This "family portrait" as he very ac
curately calls it, is, in its complete
effect, a novel; for it has become
recognized by now that the fiction
side may lay aside conventional
drama, and try to create the spirit
of an age—as for instance, "The For
syth e Saga."
Glenway Wescott has taken the
"Tower" family and by making, as it |
were, the old family album into a
series of character sketches and
stories, has reproduced average rural
life in midwestern America from the
days before the Civil War up to now.
With what imaginative vigor he has
done it, with what an eye for the es
sential characteristics of our grand
mothers and grandmothers, our great
uncles and aunts —I can only leave
for the reader the rest —for the book
deserves to be read by all to whom
America's past—and future —mean
anything.
