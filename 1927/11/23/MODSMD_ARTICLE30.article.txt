The Editor, Sir:
1 would like to make a few comments
concerning your editorial about the New
Year's game which appeared in your is
sue of November 22. In the first place,
your sneering tone is ill-becoming. You
speak of "Stanford's student football
players, after a season of playing for the
amateur sportsmanship of American col
lege football"—to the tune of games
with gate receipts of $500,000 and more
—"will help to advertise Southern Cali
fornia and thereby boost the price of
real estate there." You entirely forget
that practically 50 per cent of Stan
ford's student body lives in Southern
California so that it will not be the same
as sending them to a foreign land. It
is quite possible also that Stanford's
numerous alumni in Southern California
would like to see the Stanford eleven
play,
The continuously sneering tone which
you adopt toward Southern California
is worthy of small-town jealousy but is
ill-placed in a first-class newspaper. I
admit I assume that you are endeavoring
to make your paper first-class.
While you are pursuing your hyper
: critical way and dashing off snappy edi

above criticism. In the same issue is
an article on Stanford's track men at
the 1.C.4-A. last year. There are only
four mistakes. Edmonds took third, not
second, in the pole vault; Bob King tied
for second in the high jump, although
he won it two years ago; Bill Sparling
! did not place; and McKinnon took fourth
| instead of third. Ross Nichols did take
third in the high hurdles to give you
i one fact correct. By the way, both Jack
[ Dales and McGuire ran the half-mile
last year. Elsewhere in the paper you
state that Stanford played Pittsburgh in
Pasadena. That is also a mistake; it was
played at Stanford.
Hoping you will find space enough in
your precious columns to print this be

Yours respectfully,

The Editor, Sir:
I was surprised to hear that there is
criticism of the proposed New Year's
Day game in Pasadena.
Surely those who attended last year's
game would be able to convince skeptics
that it is all for the best. Why, the Stan
ford rooting section alone was well worth
the price of admission. What a colorful
spectacle! And never were stunts exe
cuted with greater neatness and preci
sion.
The six-year-old boy who sat in front
of me did his card tricks like a veteran,
although I DID wish he would sit down
now and then. It was bothersome enough

having the elderly lady behind me shell
peanuts down my neck, without this
needed inconvenience. But then, as I say,
it was well worth it.
I never saw such admirable display of
the true Stanford spirit as was evinced
by the gentleman of eighty or so who
sat beside me. Barring some trifling dif
ficulty with his false teeth, which, inse
curely fastened, would threaten to fall
out when he rendered the "Who-o-o—
rah !" he functioned nobly throughout.
A gay touch was added by the family
of ten or so who sat two rows ahead,
and who did more than their share in
contributing to the volume of our cheer
ing. They kept time with the rooting
mighty well, too, considering the fact
that they yelled exclusively in Portu
guese.
I forgot to mention that a Stanford
man sat to my left. We shook hands
warmly. It was the beginning of a Beau
tiful Friendship.
The Stanford section would not have
been so uniformly excellent, I am sure,
had it not been for the precaution of
having tickets validated outside the gates, i
Arriving half an hour early for the
game, I missed most of the first half,
but was really not angry. Validating was
too much fun. You would shove and
push and yell in the gay crowd, much as
one does at Caberia on Saturday nights,
and then when you got to the box office
you would find youself in the A-G line
when your name began with R. Back to
the foot of another line, and once more
the jolly push! It was a regular picnic. I
As for the teams, they performed very j
creditably on that beautiful emerald field, j
a gem in the midst of the California!
foothills, reeking with midwinter bios-!
soms and real estate concerns. The men, I
fresh from three and a half months' J
training, were right on their toes and
very much interested in the contest.
All in all it was a gala event. I am
surprised that there is criticism of the
proposed New Year's Day game in
Pasadena. '28. I
