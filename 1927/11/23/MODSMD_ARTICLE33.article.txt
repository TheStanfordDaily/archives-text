EAST VS. WEST

More than any other force, more
than any other ten forces all compact,
has the East-West game succeeded
brilliantly In reducing further the
taste, the sense, and the general in
terest of the sports known as ama
teur football. Like a thundering flood
of dollars and cents, the flapdoodle
of a big advertisement for "the sunny
skies of California (Pasadena)" has
swept before us, carrying before it
what seeds of perception were sprout
ing, however faintly, among lots of
the people.
During the Stanford-Alabama game,
a certain radio announcer hired to
announce the game, cheapened the
national taste of football to a point
where cheapness can seem to go no
further. One hears "gaze upon this
great spectacle here —oh those beau
tiful homes and hills in the distance"
and the one wonders whether this
was a football game or a real estate
deal.
The simple truth of the matter is
that the Tournament of Roses com
mittee have already got their hands
around football's windpipe and the
annual New Year's game is begin
ning clearly to show the effects of it.
And then, there comes to one at this
moment of writing a feeling for the
treatment of the football team last
year .Here was a great team, sacrific
ing their Christmas dinner with their
relatives to get in condition for an
exorbitant windpipe production that
was called an East-West game.
It is a rare man who will not con
fess that the players 011 the Stanford
team were treated like two-year-olds
in regard to expense money for their
stay in Pasadena. Who was responsi
ble, we do not know. Picture a team
giving up the pleasures of a Christ
mas eve at home, and the days of rest
and joy for the sake of commercial
ism. The money-makers negotiate
their rendezvous on the night boats
or in Catalina, the football players
night after night return home tired
from practice, only to be notified that 1
they are not even allowed a ten-cent
phone call to their mother.

around and can't stand it any lunger

can't stand the continuation of tre- 1
mendous exercise and needs a little
recreation comes to find that his !
whole expense money runs up to a
few measly dollar bills —with tears
given on the parting of them by the
money-mongers. What can a football

player do? Should he stand such ab
surd treatment when he not only sac
rifices his vacation but risks his
bones for the glory of the potential
dollar? The straight of the whole
matter is that during the training of
the team for the Alabama game, the
1 men were not given enough money
' for a country chicken to scratch for.
By way of contrast it might be said
that the members of the Alabama
team were each given a hundred dol
lar football present 011 Christmas day.

money to a player, but we do advo
cate the spirit of the thing, which
may be expressed in an entirely dif
ferent way.
This, then, is the situation at the
moment of writing. And at the mo
ment of writing, one thing seems
clear. And this one thing—if we may
make a prediction—is this: if the
football players can sacrifice their
whole vacation, can't the backers of
this big deal treat the players like
human beings rather than complain
because one of them hangs up a ten
cent phone call from his room?
The point is: give some men a pad
of paper, eight or nine sharp pencils,
a handful of thin cigars—all of which
are in their means—and they do not
care a tinker's damn whether the
team sleeps on the floor or in beds —
their whole ambition lies in figuring
out how they can cut expenses so
that the deluge of gold rolls into their
fund. —E L.S.
