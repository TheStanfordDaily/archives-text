# MISS NICHOLSON, PILCHER OFFER APPEALING NUMBERS
## 
### 
Sincerity and simplicity in presen
tation characterized the program
given in the Little Theatre last night
by Marian Nicholson, violinist, and
William Pilcher, tenor, with Margo
Hughes at the piano.
Pilcher's English group, with "The
Wanderer's Song," "Long Ago in
Alcala," and "Call Me No More" were
particularly well received. The tenor
has a pleasing concert voice, clear
in tone and well controlled, for which
these were excellent vehicles. "Aime
rnoi," with its obvious and appealing
melody, was convincingly done.
Violinist Scores
In a group of selections light but
well-chosen, Marion Nicholson showed
her ability as a violinist, giving sensi
tive, restrained interpretations. Use

: of the mute, an ddouble stops marked
the delicate "Songs My Mother
i Taught Me." "Hejre Kati" by Hubay
was in a very definite vein, with con
trasts in mood from sandante to vi
; vace movements, and melody repeti
tions in major and minor keys.
Massenet's "Elegy" was the final
I number, a duet between Miss Nichol
i son and Pilcher, and was executed
with feeling and sincerity. Both were
j generous with their encores.
Pianist Contributes Much
Margo Hughes is a careful and
| skillful accompanist, and contributed
j largely to the success of both voice
and violin numbers. Her work in the
Mozart-Auer "Gavotte," and in Miss
Nicholson's Debussy selection, was
especially finished.
