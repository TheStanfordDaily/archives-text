# WOMEN'S INTERHOUSE BASKETBALL PROGRAM DEMANDED-BUNTSNG
## Suggest Planning Schedule Similar to Elimination Tennis Tourney 
### 
"At present, demand is being made
for a series of interhouse basketball
games, for which there is to be no
practice," announces Helen Masters
Bunting, director of Roble Gymna
sium.
"It has been suggested that these
games might be planned much like
an elimination tennis tournament. In
this case half of the houses would
play -only once during the season, ana
tow more than two or three times.
!t i.s not likely that this could take
the place of regular interclass play
and carry the same athletic awards.
The interclass program would prob
ably ho expected to go on as before.
Programs Conflict
"There might be a conflict here
which would mean a sacrifice on the
part of the girl who is already in
terested in basketball and playing on
her class team. Either she might play
on both teams and perhaps be forced
to play two games in one day, or she
might give up her interclass play for
the sake of playing for her house,
and with this lose the chance of win
ning more points for her numeral or
letter.
Awards Recommended
"The fairest way to give interhouse
play a firm enough basis for it to re
main in later years would be to give
awards in the same way as in inter
class competition, with the same plan
of practice and play in earning them.
"If social contact is the main pur
pose in view, there is more in the
present program, when players from
all houses may meet and play to
gether on teams of their own classes
lor two days out of every week in the
quarter. The women who take advan
tage of this are the ones who are
really interested in the sport.
Health Important Fact
"My only purpose in bringing up
these points is to make sure that the
â€¢women thoroughly understand the
situation. If they present a program
which is safeguarded from the stand
point of health and which they are
practically unanimous in believing
will be for the best interests of the
whole athletic program in the long
run, the Department of Physical Edu
cation for women will be ready to help
them make such a program a suc
cess," concluded Miss Bunting.
