# Humorous Side Of Sports Makes Cartooning Fun, Says Feg Murray
## 
### 
"If you are interested in sports,
you get to see all the big events; and
if you like to draw, it's fun to put
down your impressions in drawings,"
said Feg Murray to the Graphic Art
department as he explained his pro
fession an dhobby to them Monday
afternoon. "Then, too, there is a hu
morous side to sport cartooning, and
it is a pleasure to do the humorous
side as well as the serious in a busi
ness."
The name "Feg Murray" is familiar
to Daily readers as the originator of
the sport cartoons which bear his
name and appear in the Daily each
day. He continued: "There are so
many angles to the cartooning busi
ness that it is intensely interesting."
Exhibits Samples
Examples of each stage of the pro
cess of a "Murraymento" are exhib
ited at the Graphic Art department,
and Murray used these drawings in
his talk yesterday. He first explained
the four stages which are necessary
before a cartoon can appear in a local
newspaper.
The drawing is first made on ross
board or croquil paper. A steel en
graving is made from this, and a
matrix from the steel engraving.
These mats are sent to the news
papers with a "Murraymento," which
is a large sheet on which are six car
toons and stories. From the matrix
the individual newspaper makes its
engravings and prints its cartoons.
They are mailed for a week's issues
in advance, and drawn two weeks in
advance, as it takes that long to
finish the engraving, printing, mat
making, and mailing.
Composition Stressed
The importance of composition was
stressed by the cartoonist in speak
ing of the drawings. "It is better to
have a center and make all other
things subordinate to it. It is neces
sary to decide whether to draw in
light and shade or color, and also to
leave space around a cartoon. Life
drawing is most important as it is
the foundation of all art work."
In speaking of caricature he said
that it was extremely interesting
work, and that his first attempt to
draw a man smiling had looked like
a grinning skull. He emphasized the
importance of knowifig how colors
turn cut in newspaper print, as draw
ings are apt to be ruined by a gray
background which turns out black.
Process Explained
The Bend 6 process is a form of en
graving handy for cartoonists. A light
shade of color is applied to a draw
ing and the number of the "Bend<ยง"
is placed at the side so in printing the
right shade of gray or biack is used.
Feg Murray graduated from Stan
ford in 191G. He majored in Graphic
Art, under Professor A .13. Clark, and
according to the cartoonist Mr.
Clark's Art 6 class has influenced all
his work.
Murray is visiting his father, Pro
fessor A. T. Murray, head of the
Classical Literature department, in
his home in Palo Alto.
