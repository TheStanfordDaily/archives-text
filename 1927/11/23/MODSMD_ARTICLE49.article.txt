# INDEPENDENT STUDY PLAN ATTRACTS FEW STANFORD STUDENTS
## System Is Much Like That Used at Swarthmore, European Schools 
### Albert Denney 
"It is inconceivable that so few stu
dents are interested in taking full com
mand of their time, and working inde
pendently," declares Professor Lewis
Madison Tcrman, member of the Com
mittee on Independent Study, and origi
nator of the plan at Stanford.
He is also head of the Psychology
Department.
Follows Oxford Plan
"This independent study plan has many
things in common with the Oxford sys
tem and many other European modes of
education, and it is almost identical with
the plan now in use at Swarthmore. At
Svvarthmore nearly all the students are
working under it.
"The independent study plan is a move
ment by educators to get away from the
formal lecture system, which is simply
the transmission of learning, to induce
the student to learn for himself," says
Professor Albert Guerard, also a mem
ber of the Committee on Independent
Study.
Devise Plans for Student
"This plan is for students who believe
that they are not getting all that they
should out of the University, for under
the plan the amount of education de
rived from the University depends en
tirely upon the student himself," said
Professor Ernest Gale Martin of the
committee.
This plan was organized at Stanford
almost two years ago and at no time
have there been more than a half dozen
students taking advantage of it. Profes
sor Guerard declares that there should
have been more exceptional students in
terested in it, and that more worthy
students are welcome, but he also gives
the warning that with more students
working under the plan the committee
becomes more particular in accepting ap
plicants.
Professor Guerard advises any upper
classmen expecting to register for work
under the Independent Study Plan to
complete all arrangements for such reg
istration before the end of this quarter
if he wants to take advantage of the
plan at the beginning of the next quar
ter, so that the major departments and
the committee will have time to act upon
the application.
Good Students May Enroll
Excerpts from the bulletin on the in
dependent. plan of study state, "Any stu
dent with exceptional qualifications may
enroll under the Independent Study Plan
with the consent of the major department
and approval of the committee on inde
pendent study, at the beginning of his
junior year or at the beginning or any
quarter after that."
Under the plan the student with his
special advisor, usually a member of his
major department, outlines a program
more comprehensive and more intensive
than that of the average student. Not
only is the student working under the
independent study plan freed from the
usual obligations of attending classes,
but his program also calls for more self
direction and demands a higher type of
thinking than that of most students.

"It is inconceivable that so few stu
dents are interested in taking full com
mand of their time, and working inde
pendently," declares Professor Lewis
Madison Tcrman, member of the Com
mittee on Independent Study, and origi
nator of the plan at Stanford.
He is also head of the Psychology
Department.
Follows Oxford Plan
"This independent study plan has many
things in common with the Oxford sys
tem and many other European modes of
education, and it is almost identical with
the plan now in use at Swarthmore. At
Svvarthmore nearly all the students are
working under it.
"The independent study plan is a move
ment by educators to get away from the
formal lecture system, which is simply
the transmission of learning, to induce
the student to learn for himself," says
Professor Albert Guerard, also a mem
ber of the Committee on Independent
Study.
Devise Plans for Student
"This plan is for students who believe
that they are not getting all that they
should out of the University, for under
the plan the amount of education de
rived from the University depends en
tirely upon the student himself," said
Professor Ernest Gale Martin of the
committee.
This plan was organized at Stanford
almost two years ago and at no time
have there been more than a half dozen
students taking advantage of it. Profes
sor Guerard declares that there should
have been more exceptional students in
terested in it, and that more worthy
students are welcome, but he also gives
the warning that with more students
working under the plan the committee
becomes more particular in accepting ap
plicants.
Professor Guerard advises any upper
classmen expecting to register for work
under the Independent Study Plan to
complete all arrangements for such reg
istration before the end of this quarter
if he wants to take advantage of the
plan at the beginning of the next quar
ter, so that the major departments and
the committee will have time to act upon
the application.
Good Students May Enroll
Excerpts from the bulletin on the in
dependent. plan of study state, "Any stu
dent with exceptional qualifications may
enroll under the Independent Study Plan
with the consent of the major department
and approval of the committee on inde
pendent study, at the beginning of his
junior year or at the beginning or any
quarter after that."
Under the plan the student with his
special advisor, usually a member of his
major department, outlines a program
more comprehensive and more intensive
than that of the average student. Not
only is the student working under the
independent study plan freed from the
usual obligations of attending classes,
but his program also calls for more self
direction and demands a higher type of
thinking than that of most students.
