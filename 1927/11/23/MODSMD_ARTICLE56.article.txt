### 
Copies of "L'Avare," a French play
by Moliere, edited with introduction,
notes, program of work, and vocabu
lary by Professor Frederick Ander
son of the Stanford Romanic Lang
uages department, have just been re
ceived. The book was published by
Ginn and Co., which operates publish
ing houses in several cities of the
United States.
It was intended that this volume be
used as a text in certain French
classes here, but because of the late
date at which copies have been re
ceived it will not be used until the
winter quarter.
