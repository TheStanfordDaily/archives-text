# 1928 CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENCY ONE OE PERSONALITIES-LEVIT
## 
### 
"The 1928 Presidential Campaign will
be largely a campaign of personalities
rather than a campaign of issues," de
clared Bert W. Levit, San Francisco at
torney and Stanford graduate, in his
talk before the Euphronia Debating So
ciety last evening on "The Issues and
Candidates of the 1928 Presidential Elec
tion."
"Big business will line up either with
Dawes or Hughes, the farmers will back
Lowden, wet Republicans will support
Longworth, and Hoover will be the popu
lar candidate. Smith and Richie are the
outstanding Democratic possibilities and
they are directly opposed in ideas. Smith
represents the modern machine Demo
crat while Ritchie is an irreproachable
Jeffersonian Democrat."
Levit reviewed the records of the dif
ferent candidates and their various
changes for nomination. He typified
Hoover as "a man who always has been
called upon to fill a big job but whom
the politicians did not favor.
"I think the people's attitude was ex
pressed by Chester Rowell when he said,
'Harding' got us back on the track of
normalcy, Coolidge got the machine
going, and now we want to go some
place.' "
