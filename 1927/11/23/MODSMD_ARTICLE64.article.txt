## 
### 
Gene Tunney, champion heavy
weight boxer of the world, in a letter
to Harry Maloney, Stanford boxing
coach, announces his intention of
awarding gold medals to winners of'
the University boxing tournament to I
be held here during the spring quar-1
ter.
Tunney expressed his high regard
for tho sportsmanship and cleanliness
of college boxing as compared to that
in the professional field. He said, "It |
will give me great pleasure to have i
the privilege of donating the seven |
medals you speak of to tho winners
of the boxing championships of Stan-'
ford. 1 think the thing you are doing !
for the boys in getting boxing the
recognition you have gotten it is
something that the University should
appreciate.
"College boxing and professional j
boxing are two entirely different j
things. It is true they are related, but.
one of the relatives has, unfortunate- i
ly, degenerated. This degeneracy has !
followed the elimination of sports-'
manship. The public at large is direct-!
ly responsible for this condition, for '
evidently the public admire more the i
killer instinct which, in your and my I
language is unsportsmanship, than |
they do real, clean, palpable sports- j
manship. Sportsmanship, Harry, is tho 1
thing that will make boxing in your j
[University successful. Development '
of sportsmanship is the greatest vir
tue man can have."
