GENEVA, Nov. 27. â€”International
complications which caused talk of
war in Europe over the week-end are
being brought to Geneva for solution.
Two important meetings to be held
at the League of Nations seat, the
preparatory Disarmament Commission
Conference Wednesday and the
League Council session a week hence,
will either iron out or further en
tangle the new difficulties.
Soviet Delegation Present
A Soviet delegation, closely guarded
to prevent attacks upon it, has come
to make its first real stand in inter
national diplomacy since the Bolshe
vik revolution ,ten years ago. It will
take part in the disarmament confer
ence and discussion of the Polish-
Lithuania situation which caused a
flare-up in Europe last week.
Added to the "war cloud" talk of
David Lloyd George, Great Britain's
war-time Prime Minister; Senator
Henri de Jouvenal, of France; Signor
Nitt, former Italian Premier, now ex
iled; and Lord Rothermere, powerful
English nwspaper owner, were a
series of remarkable devlopmnts, all
presaging difficulty at the Geneva
meetings and making war a vivid pos
sibility.
Rumor Lithuanian Overthrow
Simultaneously came reports of un
usual activity in Vilna, Kovno, capital
of Lithuania, and Warsaw. One said
the Lithuanian government had been
overthrown, but (his was entirely
without confirmation.
Another war scare came when the
announcement of the France-Jugo-
Slavia "Friendship Treaty" was an
swered by the action of Italy in mak
ing a treaty with Albania, which
strengthens Italy's power of the Medi
terranean.
