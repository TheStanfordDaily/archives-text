# W.A.A. Leader Says Women Need Outside Competition In Sports
## 
### 
"Nothing can create a real interest
in women's athletics on the campus
las long as we have no intercollegiate
; competition," declares Barbara Fen
wick, president of W.A.A.
"As long as our program is local
i and concerns only the few who ac
tually take part in the iuterclass
| games we will not have a vital or
ganization. The campus as a whole
jiias no interest in our activities be
cause we have nothing to show for
them.
"Since the sentiment of the women
is strongly for intercollegiate games
jit might seem that we could change
| the situation at once. But there is
;a recommendation of our national so
! ciety that there be none, with the
I provision that if a section wants such
i competition all the colleges concerned
i may have it if they agree on wanting
ito play each other. At present we
|are the only ones in the sport-triangle
| of California, Mills, and Stanford who
; take this stand.
"Until the other two decide that
J they want intercollegiate sports we
are unable to act. We might play va
; rious teachers' colleges, but the loca
j tion of our two traditional rivals and
i their stronger reputation make them
i the ideal opponents.
"We have tried the Play Day idea,
| but so far it has failed in its original
j purpose of making lasting social con
tacts between women of the uni
versities. This year it will be on the
j Stanford campus and we are trying
jto see that the result will justify
| the time and effort that will be spent.
: At best it can never fill the gap made
iby the lack of intercollegiate sport.
Interhouse competition might help to
| stimulate campus interest, but if it
i became keenly competitive its use-
J fulness would be gone.
"Our equipment is decidedly inade
quate and we can scarcely hope for
any improvement as long as we do no
more than we do now. All we can
j hope for is a change of policy on
'the part of Mills and California."
