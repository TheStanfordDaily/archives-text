# RADIO PRIMARILY FOR ENTERTAINMENT SAYS STANFORD PROFESSOR
## 
### 
"Radio is primarily to entertain, and
the educational side of it is as yet
secondary," declared Professor Fred
erick Terman of the Electrical Engi
neering department.
"As a means of education, it can
not he termed a failure, for that is
not its essential function. Many sta
tions have educational programs, but
these are popularized. They are for
the most part, of advertising, not of
educational value. The cause of radio
as a means of education at present
is pseudo-education and that which
borders on the line of quackery.
"One service rendered to education
hy radio is the scientific information
broadcast hy the Department of Ag
riculture for farmers."
