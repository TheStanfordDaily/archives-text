# CLASS OF 1930 TO GIVE FARCE ONE WEEK LATE
## "Expressing Willie" Full of Humorous Situations, Good Repartee PLAY WELL BALANCED Paul Speegle Cast in Lead as Willie Smith, Wealthy Manufacturer 
### Herbert Wenig 
Campus theatregoers will be treated
to a comedy based on a typical Ameri
can situation and full of good quips
and humorous situations when the
sophomore play, "Expressing Willie,"
is presented in the Assembly Hall on
December 10. The play itself is well
balanced, there being at least three
good feminine and masculine parts.
The plot revolves around Willie
Smith, an ordinary American who has
made his money in the manufacture
of tooth paste. Willie, played by Paul
Speegle, endeavoring to make an im
pression with newly-acquired wealth,
falls in with a group of artists, typical
inhabitants of the Bohemias of our
large cities. The idea of the story
then is told in the title as this artful
crowd strives to have Willie "express"
himself, his true nature, their at
tempts providing a series of laugh
producing episodes.
Willie's mother, Mrs. Smith, a very
sharp, domineering type of woman
easily perceives the shallowness of
Willie's friends whose real chief de
sire is to have him express himself in
dollars and cents.
Taliaferro, the artist, is in contrast
to Willie. He is a finer type than his
companions but rather extreme, prid
ing himself on the fact that he at
tempts to express the truth as he
sees it. For this reason he is con
sidered eccentric and at times runs
rough-shod over others' feelings. This
role will require ability in order to
portray it to advantage.
Rehearsals of the cast were held all
last week and concentrated ones will
be in order until December 10.
