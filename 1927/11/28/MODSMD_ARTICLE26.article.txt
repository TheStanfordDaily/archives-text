# The
						"Battle of Culture"

Now, with the retiring of football from the nation's sport pages, come
other interests with their efforts to monopolize general attention some
what after the manner of the gridiron. The most unusual of these is a
proposal by the Harvard Student Council of a "Battle of Culture"
between Yale and Harvard. Briefly, the plan is as follows: Each college
will select a team of ten men, who will take identical examinations, the
winning college to be determined by the collective average of each team.
In addition to gold medals, money will be given to the winning side; it is
suggested that this be used in purchasing books for the college.
It is further suggested that the contest be extended to cover the
entire field of learning, with the team consising of picked men in every
"event": Literature, the Classics, English, French, Spanish, German,
Economics, Philosophy, the Fine Arts, and the like.
Disregarding the humorous angles to such a proposal, there are
several serious objections to the possible success of the plan. To begin
with, such an affair would not be a "battle of culture," but a contest
between "grade-getters" for marks. Marks on examination papers are
not, to our mind, indicative of the culture possessed by the writer of the
paper. Then, too, there is the possibility that if such a contest should
go into general practice, the results might lead to the creations of false
impressions as to the standards of learning at the respective colleges.
No, the application of competitive methods cannot be made success
fully to fit learning and culture as intercollegiate activities.
