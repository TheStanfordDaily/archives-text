# "The Honor System Is-"
## 
### 
The honor system, observance of which marks a gentleman, appar
ently was not thought of as extending to the process of applying for
Big Game tickets. Jake Irwin, head of the ticket department of the
Board of Athletic Control, declares that there were 500 attempts by men
students to infract the Board's regulations governing the procuring of
seats. Attempts were made to apply under both alumni and student
classifications, to obtain another person's tickets by signing his name to
the application blank, and to evade the rules by other devices.
When one-fifth of the male student body tries shadowy methods of
obtaining something coveted, it is time to point out that the honor
system, which is after all only a gentlemen's agreement, applies not only
to blue books, but to personal conduct at any time on the campus, per
haps even in parties of six. Some infractions of the rules were due to
ignorance but others palpably were not so.
