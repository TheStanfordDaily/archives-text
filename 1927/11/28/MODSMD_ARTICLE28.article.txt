Following is a resolution passed by the Board of Athletic Control at
a meeting last week:
"It was voted that the Secretary he instructed to express to the
General Manager and his staff of assistants the appreciation of the
Board of the splendid handling of the Stanford-California game on
November 19. The sale of tickets, the ushering, policing, the man
agement of the concessions, and the arrangement of facilities set
a new standard for thoroughness and efficiency. The Board realizes
that this was the result of careful planning and foresight on the part
of the heads of the various departments, as well as the faithful
co-operation of all the students employed on the day of the game."
The Board is right; Big Game day is not only a big day for the
football players.
