# And Then Our A Little SALLY---

### 
When there are only three days be- j
tween the Big Game and Thanksgiv
ing vacation, it really is awfully hard ;
to settle down and study for examina- j
tions. I mean, when a girl is sensitive, I
her nerves are put on edge by the
week-end, and it naturally takes a few
days to get quiet again.
So I just can't understand why pro
fessors have to give us examinations
during this time. I thought that they
were supposed to let the students
have tests at the times when they
felt best and could do the best work.
I mean, college is for the students. 1
At least, that is what education
courses tell us.

[ But professors are really the most
amazing people. One minute you think
you know just what to say and do to
please them; and the next thing you
know, you are told to write a term
i paper.
I mean, after all, why waste your
time, when they really don't seem to
: understand what you want.
I guess, however, that it does help
I a lot to go and see professors in their
1 offices. Personal contact might mean
something, particularly when you
simply don't feel as though you could
possibly take an examination and do
it justice until after Thanksgiving.
