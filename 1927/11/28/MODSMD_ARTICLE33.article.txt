"Literary Blasphemies," by Ernest
Boyd; Harper's, 1927.
Approaching this hook in definite
anticipation of disliking it, we were
surprised to find that, although epiite
destructive, it has also constructive
elements. Ernest Boyd attempts to
take some of the so-called classical
English and American writers off
their pedestals, and to put some of
them on new pedestals. His idea is to
attack the question of their merits on
the basis of an unbiased reader's im
pressions, that is, of a reader who
has not back of him an education in
the old manner of regarding them.
Boyd starts with Shakespeare. Na
turally, after reading the publisher's
notices —which, by the way, is a weak
ness we have when we start a new
book —one expects Will to be hauled
off and buried. Not so; he is, in the
publisher's phrase, "debunked." Cast
ing aside all the old comment on the
playwright, Boyd says that Shakes
peare is splendid for himself, but that
editors, actors, and annotators have
spoiled him by rewriting his plays
until they are unrecognizable, and by
burying the real Shakespeare under
a mass of irrelevent comment and
erudite explanation. "Poor Will," how
ever, emerges from Boyd's essay still
a powerful force in English literature.
Milton is no good at all, if we are
to take Boyd seriously. The man was
inconsistent, pedantic, and politically
undecided. As a poet, he had in him
too much of the Puritan, and he pla
garized upon Sedulius for his "Para
dise Lost." Of this poem Boyd says,
"Adam is obviously too respectable an
English bourgeois to be the hero of
an epic, and thus we come to the

.supreme irony of 'Paradise Lost,' to
wit, that Lucifer is the iinest cliarac
' ter in it."
Jonathan Swift is Boyd's hero. The
I chapter is devoted to showing that
Swift was too great for posterity; that
he seared the complacent English so
! much that now his works are not
available in a form fit for adults to
read. Most of his works are little
i known, and what we have are so
I expurgated as to be good only for
Christmas gifts to children.
On Byron and Poe the critic says
much the same thing: there has been
i too much fuss about their personal
lives, and too little emphasis on their
actual work. Byron, he says, has live f d
j in spite of it and of the obvious fact
■ that he does not fit into the orthodox
; idea of the classics. Poe, on the other
I hand, has outlived the fame he would
; have had if people had let his private
j life alone.
Dickens suffers in this book the
same criticism that everyone has for
him now-a-days: he is incapable of
true realism. James was a deracine
whose whole life was artificial, and
who clouded very simple meanings by
the use of too elaborate phraseology.
Thomas Hardy, for whom Boyd has
an almost equal measure of praise
and deprecation, closes the list of
authors discussed in the book.
The publisher's note states that
Boyds does not want to be taken too
seriously. Maybe not, but we suspect
him of one of two motives: he either
wants to start a good fight, or to make
people consider more carefully the
"standard authors," and develop a
clearer idea of their just status in
literature. —A-A.
