The Editor, Sir:
Not having noticed anything in the
"Daily" since the Big Game in refer
ence to the band, I suggest that while
we are cheering the team and throw
ing boquets at the Rally Committee,
Board of Athletic Control, and traffic
managers, why not give a huzzah or
two for the showing made by our
hand at the game?
First, let us give a six for the per
son or persons who thought up the
clever formations and drills. The en
trance of the band was particularly
good, something entirely new and
very effective, and whoever conceived
that idea deserves a lot of credit.
Then several rahs should be do
nated to both the drum-majors in the
big white shakos. Twirling those
batons isn't as easy as they made it
100k —try it yourself sometime —and
both of them must have spent a good
deal of time this quarter out in the
back yard winding those things around
their fingers. They added immensely
to the effectiveness of the band.
And then a three or four or some
thing for the quality of the music
played. The Stanford band always
plays well and it lived up to its repu
tation Saturday.
And finally a skyrocket for the hun
dred-odd students who compose the
band itself. Performing the drills, per
haps not faultlessly, but exceptionally
well withal, they certainly gained for
themselves a deal of well-earned glory
and, by the impressiveness of their
appearance, put the name of Stanford
several notches higher in the estima
tion of thousands.

The Editor, Sir:
This is a sequel to A 1 Master's ex
planation of the women's rooter ticket
mix-up at the Big Game.
I applied, in the regular manner, for i
a ticket in the women's rooting sec
tion for the Big Game, and in spite of ;
this and my obviously feminine name !
I was issued a ticket in R.R. 52. As I
was reasonably sure that this was in
the men's rooting section, I went back
and asked at the ticket window but |
was told that this was surely a j
women's ticket. Then when I ap
peared at the stadium, the ushers j
were doubtful about letting me in. I
know two other women rooters to j
whom the same thing happened and i
none of us was an import trying to |
get in on a man's ticket. It would
have been rather tragic if they had
refused us admittance. So, if the -
Board of Athletic Control is going to j
take any such drastic measures as
refusing admittance to women hold
ing men's tickets, it had better take !
a little more care to whom it issues J
men's tickets. I am sure that the !
Board of Athletic Control was not
aware it was issuing men's tickets to |
women but that some worker in the j
department slipped up. I hope that j

! calling attention to it in this manner
| will avoid any future difficulty in the
matter. Sincerely, Eleanor Nichols.

; The Editor, Sir:
As the result of a recent automobile
accident a freshman woman is in the
hospital with a deep gash in her back,
a few broken bones, and is facing the
prospect of spending the next six
weeks in bed. Besides the pain and
expense she has suffered, she has lost
her first quarter in the University.
Why is she there? Because arrival
at Roble Hall ever so few seconds
after 1:30 o'clock at night meant a
j LOCKOUT. A lockout meant punish
j ment, and to an incomer particularly,
lit carried a certain stigma of disgrace.
So the proverbial life and limb
were risked, quite literally, that Stan
ford women's elevent commandment
might not be violated, that the pen
alty might be avoided, and that a girl
should be inside a certain door by a
given second.
For this is the law by which the
Stanford women govern themselves in
their so careful pursuit of their con
stitutional right while on the Farm.
"Die luft der freinheir weht" . . . .
But perhaps the draft is too strong,
as yet, for members of the 500!
Ideally, if I may be so broad-minded,
the regulations by which A.W.S. gov
erns its members are supposed to
inculcate respect for law, to serve
as a measure of protection against
adverse criticism from the outside as
well as against the occasional poorer
judgment of individuals, and to en
courage common sense, aye, wisdom
iin making choices.
Actually, respect can never be ac
! corded law which is felt to be mis
j taken in principle, and to operate un-
I fairly. When considered as a device
•for protection, our rules are liable to
| test by comparison of the moral (or
whatever) danger or loss consequent
to remaining out a minute past the
hour so carefully chosen, with the ac
tual and measurable consequences of
such an accident as the one in ques
tion.

Then about the "good judgment" we
are expected to absorb, and for which
the cues are so carefully handed us.
College life, especially at such a
unique and superior institution as
Stanford, is expected to turn out the
more or less finished product—the
Individual, fitted to cope with Life.
So they bring us in at 10:30 or 1:30
that we may grow strong and wise in
making the right choice, in achieving
that most-important asset-of-all which
college can give, the ability to think
and decide for one's self.
There is an old saying about mus
cles and no exercise; but we, the
Associated Women of Stanford Uni
versity, have no need to heed any
thing so old and trite. At any rate we
choose to disregard it. —'29.

As the result of a recent automobile
accident a freshman woman is in the
hospital with a deep gash in her back,
a few broken bones, and is facing the
prospect of spending the next six
weeks in bed. Besides the pain and
expense she has suffered, she has lost
her first quarter in the University.
Why is she there? Because arrival
at Roble Hall ever so few seconds
after 1:30 o'clock at night meant a
j LOCKOUT. A lockout meant punish
j ment, and to an incomer particularly,
lit carried a certain stigma of disgrace.
So the proverbial life and limb
were risked, quite literally, that Stan
ford women's elevent commandment
might not be violated, that the pen
alty might be avoided, and that a girl
should be inside a certain door by a
given second.
For this is the law by which the
Stanford women govern themselves in
their so careful pursuit of their con
stitutional right while on the Farm.

judgment of individuals, and to en
courage common sense, aye, wisdom
iin making choices.
Actually, respect can never be ac

j taken in principle, and to operate un-
I fairly. When considered as a device
•for protection, our rules are liable to

whatever) danger or loss consequent
to remaining out a minute past the
hour so carefully chosen, with the ac
tual and measurable consequences of
such an accident as the one in ques

Then about the "good judgment" we
are expected to absorb, and for which
the cues are so carefully handed us.
College life, especially at such a
unique and superior institution as
Stanford, is expected to turn out the
more or less finished product—the
Individual, fitted to cope with Life.
So they bring us in at 10:30 or 1:30
that we may grow strong and wise in
making the right choice, in achieving
that most-important asset-of-all which
college can give, the ability to think
and decide for one's self.

Not having noticed anything in the

we are cheering the team and throw

Board of Athletic Control, and traffic
managers, why not give a huzzah or
two for the showing made by our
hand at the game?
First, let us give a six for the per
son or persons who thought up the
clever formations and drills. The en
trance of the band was particularly
good, something entirely new and
very effective, and whoever conceived
that idea deserves a lot of credit.
Then several rahs should be do
nated to both the drum-majors in the
big white shakos. Twirling those
batons isn't as easy as they made it
100k —try it yourself sometime —and
both of them must have spent a good
deal of time this quarter out in the
back yard winding those things around
their fingers. They added immensely
to the effectiveness of the band.
And then a three or four or some
thing for the quality of the music
played. The Stanford band always
plays well and it lived up to its repu
tation Saturday.
And finally a skyrocket for the hun
dred-odd students who compose the

The Editor, Sir:
Not having noticed anything in the
"Daily" since the Big Game in refer
ence to the band, I suggest that while
we are cheering the team and throw
ing boquets at the Rally Committee,
Board of Athletic Control, and traffic
managers, why not give a huzzah or
two for the showing made by our
hand at the game?
First, let us give a six for the per
son or persons who thought up the
clever formations and drills. The en
trance of the band was particularly
good, something entirely new and
very effective, and whoever conceived
that idea deserves a lot of credit.
Then several rahs should be do
nated to both the drum-majors in the
big white shakos. Twirling those
batons isn't as easy as they made it
100k —try it yourself sometime —and
both of them must have spent a good
deal of time this quarter out in the
back yard winding those things around
their fingers. They added immensely
to the effectiveness of the band.
And then a three or four or some
thing for the quality of the music
played. The Stanford band always
plays well and it lived up to its repu
tation Saturday.
And finally a skyrocket for the hun
dred-odd students who compose the
band itself. Performing the drills, per
haps not faultlessly, but exceptionally
well withal, they certainly gained for
themselves a deal of well-earned glory
and, by the impressiveness of their
appearance, put the name of Stanford
several notches higher in the estima
tion of thousands.

This is a sequel to A 1 Master's ex
planation of the women's rooter ticket
mix-up at the Big Game.
I applied, in the regular manner, for i
a ticket in the women's rooting sec
tion for the Big Game, and in spite of ;
this and my obviously feminine name !
I was issued a ticket in R.R. 52. As I
was reasonably sure that this was in
the men's rooting section, I went back
and asked at the ticket window but |
was told that this was surely a j
women's ticket. Then when I ap
peared at the stadium, the ushers j
were doubtful about letting me in. I
know two other women rooters to j
whom the same thing happened and i
none of us was an import trying to |
get in on a man's ticket. It would
have been rather tragic if they had
refused us admittance. So, if the -
Board of Athletic Control is going to j
take any such drastic measures as
refusing admittance to women hold
ing men's tickets, it had better take !
a little more care to whom it issues J
men's tickets. I am sure that the !
Board of Athletic Control was not
aware it was issuing men's tickets to |
women but that some worker in the j
department slipped up. I hope that j

! calling attention to it in this manner
| will avoid any future difficulty in the
matter. Sincerely, Eleanor Nichols.

As the result of a recent automobile
accident a freshman woman is in the
hospital with a deep gash in her back,
a few broken bones, and is facing the
prospect of spending the next six
weeks in bed. Besides the pain and
expense she has suffered, she has lost
her first quarter in the University.
Why is she there? Because arrival
at Roble Hall ever so few seconds
after 1:30 o'clock at night meant a
j LOCKOUT. A lockout meant punish
j ment, and to an incomer particularly,
lit carried a certain stigma of disgrace.
So the proverbial life and limb
were risked, quite literally, that Stan

might not be violated, that the pen
alty might be avoided, and that a girl
should be inside a certain door by a
