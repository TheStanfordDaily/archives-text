THE SMOKY MENACE
Pittsburgh Panthers are looming as
formidable opponents in the New
Year's game. They trounced Penn
State on Thanksgiving Day to finish
the 1927 season with a record marred
only by a tie with Washington and
Jefferson. Pop Warner watched the
game and afterward said things about
the Pitt team which indicate that a
certain red-shirted football squad will
have two weeks of hard work during
the holidays. Gibby Welch, the Pitts
burgh captain, is of ail-American cali
ber, Pop declared, and a man to be
watched.
Warner in his interview re
vealed some interesting things
about the status of the Tourna
ment of Roses game. The invad
ing team, he said, has an untold
psychological advantage, because
the men feel that they are highly
honored to be the picked eleven,
and playing away from home,
with the knowledge that Eastern
prestige depends on them, enter
the game with an enthusiasm
that a team like Stanford's, to
which the New Year's affairs is
an old story, lacks.
However, the Cardinal this year

will not play the listless game it
did against Alabama last season,
for a record of one defeat and one
tie in post-season games played
in Pasadena since 1924 is one
which would bear no little im
provement.

Pat Frayne, author of "Razzherries j
and Resin," the San Francisco Call's !
daily piece de resistance, sneers at
Stanford as the representative of the
West in the New Year's Day classic.
St. Mary's, victor over the Cardinals
and over Santa Clara, which latter
also defeated the Cardinals, should
have been picked, he contends.
Can it be that Mr. Frayne was
disappointed in the number of Big
Game tickets he got?

TROJANS' BALL AND CHAIN
Few strong teams in the history of
football have had such an unfortunate
number of one-point defeats as the j
U.S.C. elevens of 192G and 1927. Fail- |
ure to kick goals after touchdowns 1
lost U.S.C. the Stanford and Notre
Dame games last year, the scores of 1
each being 13-12, and now the Irish '
win again by the same margin. A
kicked goal would have won the Tro
jan-Stanford game of last month for
the Southerners. Too bad a team as
good as U.S.C.'s should have to drag
the ball and chain of bad luck in its
crucial games.

Still, Stanford hopes the Tro
jans will be dragging ail the balls
and chains in Folsom prison next
Saturday when they meet Wash
ington, for a Husky victory would
give the Cards clear title to the
conference championship, which
at least would take the sting from
the bitter words of our severe
critics.
