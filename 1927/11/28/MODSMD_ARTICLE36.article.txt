# FAMOUS INDIAN ATHLETES

Lo, the Poor Indian! Where would
we be without his contribution to
American sports lore? Any Ail-Ameri
can team ought really to be chosen
from a list of native Indian players,
instead of from the Oberlanders and
Olsens and Weinsteins who compose
such a big part of most all-star selec
tions. For it is in these true Ameri
cans that we find personified the love
of action, combined with trickery,
skill, and daring, that adds so much
color and picturesqueness to sports.
"Vanishing All-Americans," these
great Redmen, and the country at

large was the loser when the Govern- [
ment Indian school at Carlisle was
closed. Haskell carries on to some
extent, but Haskell Indians know how
to sleep in beds, unlike the giant
guard, Red water; and the players
from the Institute at Lawrence, Kan
sas, are not inspired by the fierce
zeal that made Bemus Pierce forget
that he was out of the game and
tackle an "enemy" as he ran by where
he sat on the sidelines.
"Big Bill" Edwards tells an amus
ing story of Bemus Pierce in the Car
lisle-Brown game, held in New York
City about 1906. Hawley Pierce,

Bemus' brother, complained to him
that one of the Brownians had been
slugging him, but that he didn't know
which one it was. "Now keep your
eyes open and find out who it was,"
Bemus advised him. "Show him to
me, and after the game I'll take care
of him properly." As Bemus' "little"
brother weighed only 210 pounds, it
seemed that assistance was not
needed. In another game the big
guard endured a lot of foul work from
an opponent, until, after warning the
man and being hit again, Bemus
knocked him flat with a terrible
punch and remarked, "White man

slug me ten times, Indian hit pale
face once —we're quits!" And they
were, at that!
Baseball has given us Sockalexis, j
"Chief" Meyers, "Chief" Bender, and
Yellowhorse; track records were set
by Thorpe, Patasoni, Tewanima, and
others; but the American Indian has
done his best athletic work on the
gridiron, and a pity it is that there
aren't more like "Indian" " Johnson,
Mount Pleasant, Pete Houser, Jim
Thorpe, Bemus Pierce, Brawny
Wheelock, Thaddeus Redwater, Ex
endine, Metoxen, Guyon, and Charley
Dillon!

me, and after the game I'll take care
of him properly." As Bemus' "little"
brother weighed only 210 pounds, it
seemed that assistance was not
needed. In another game the big
guard endured a lot of foul work from
an opponent, until, after warning the
man and being hit again, Bemus
knocked him flat with a terrible
punch and remarked, "White man

slug me ten times, Indian hit pale
face once —we're quits!" And they
were, at that!
Baseball has given us Sockalexis, j
"Chief" Meyers, "Chief" Bender, and
Yellowhorse; track records were set
by Thorpe, Patasoni, Tewanima, and
others; but the American Indian has
done his best athletic work on the
gridiron, and a pity it is that there
aren't more like "Indian" " Johnson,
Mount Pleasant, Pete Houser, Jim
Thorpe, Bemus Pierce, Brawny
Wheelock, Thaddeus Redwater, Ex
endine, Metoxen, Guyon, and Charley
Dillon!

Lo, the Poor Indian! Where would
we be without his contribution to
American sports lore? Any Ail-Ameri
can team ought really to be chosen
from a list of native Indian players,
instead of from the Oberlanders and
Olsens and Weinsteins who compose
such a big part of most all-star selec
tions. For it is in these true Ameri
cans that we find personified the love
of action, combined with trickery,
skill, and daring, that adds so much
color and picturesqueness to sports.
"Vanishing All-Americans," these
great Redmen, and the country at

large was the loser when the Govern- [
ment Indian school at Carlisle was
closed. Haskell carries on to some
extent, but Haskell Indians know how
to sleep in beds, unlike the giant
guard, Red water; and the players
from the Institute at Lawrence, Kan
sas, are not inspired by the fierce
zeal that made Bemus Pierce forget
that he was out of the game and
tackle an "enemy" as he ran by where
he sat on the sidelines.
"Big Bill" Edwards tells an amus
ing story of Bemus Pierce in the Car
lisle-Brown game, held in New York
City about 1906. Hawley Pierce,

Bemus' brother, complained to him
that one of the Brownians had been
slugging him, but that he didn't know
which one it was. "Now keep your
eyes open and find out who it was,"
Bemus advised him. "Show him to
me, and after the game I'll take care
of him properly." As Bemus' "little"
