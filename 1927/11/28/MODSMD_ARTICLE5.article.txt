# Dr. Ting Fang Lew Will Talk On Present Day Movements In China
## 
### 
Dr. Timothy Ting Fang Lew, dean
of the School of Religion, Yenching
University, Peking, China, will dis
cuss phases of old and new China at
7:30 o'clock tonight in the Little
Theatre. He will also give the regu
lar Tuesday evening lecture.
Having come directly from England,
where he has been giving a series of
lectures, Dr. Lew will be on the Pa
cific Coast for a few weeks lecturing
before university students at coast
colleges.
His object in coming to the differ
ent institutions is to interpret in lec
tures and informal discussions pres
ent day movements in thought and
speech of his people and the literary,
social, and political changes that are
making out of Old China a New China.
"There are many reasons why
American college men and women
should study China, trying to gain an
intelligent understanding of her prob
lems," writes Dr. Lew. He enumer
ates some of the outstanding reasons
for this.
"American college men and women
should know about China as part of
the world of which America is a part.
Not only is the world small through
American eiTort, but the world has
brought China and America together.
Then, too, the peoples of the two
countries have common possessions,
in a desire for progress, enduring
trust in democratic principles, and
rich natural resources."
Dr. Lew cites her persistent expe
riment in democracy as the greatest
contribution America has made to the
world.
