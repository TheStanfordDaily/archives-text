# INSTITUTE SUGGESTS MEANS OF FOSTERING RACE UNDERSTANDING
## 
### 
Introducing in university depart
ments of education the study of how
to eradicate race prejulice among
children through influence of the
teachers was advocated by students
at the Northern California Student
Institute of Pacific Relations which
convened at Montezuma Mountain
School during the Thanksgiving holi
days.
To foster race toleration among
students it was suggested that teach
ers make a more conscious effort to
create sympathy and understanding
between different races and that text
books contain facts and literature per
taining to the Orient as well as to
America.
One section of the Institute ex
pressed the opinion that present na
turalization laws are incomplete and
obsolete and should be based upon
the personal characteristics of the
citizenship applicants without racial
discrimination. Touching upon the
question of intermarriage between
Orientals and Americans, Japanese
representatives pointed out that it is
social equality in restaurants, shops,
and human contacts, not intermar
riage, that is desired.
Present chaos in China and its
devastation was declared by a Chi
nese student to be more terrible than
that of either the Civil War or the
French Revolution.
Sixty students attended, represent
ing six colleges. Stanford representa
tives included: Robert E. Cecil, Yoseb
Chu, Harriet M. Cogswell, B .F. Cul
ver, Maxine A. Cushing, Barbara Dew
laney, Thomas E. Drake, James Flem

Hardy, Kazuo Kwai, F. C. Kung,
Alexei Maraduelin, Yale Maxon,
Shigeaki Nishimoto, Dan T. Smith,
