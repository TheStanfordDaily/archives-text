Black with Color
The new mode freqnently uses
black with color, especially in
frocks of black chiffon. The color
may vary from beige to orange,
the effect varying accordingly from
soft to vivid.
If the effect is soft, the costume
can be smartly completed with
112 colorful slippers. If the frock in
troduces a vivid color, the slippers
might be black â€”that the color be
not overdone.
Slippers in black are featured in
a number of materials that your
choice may be exactly right.
