## Five Vote Unanimously; Two Stand Solidly Against Proposed Series PLAY TO BE INFORMAL Provisions Made for Three Leagues of Six Teams; Use Point System 
### 
Eight of the twelve women's living
■groups 011 the campus stand in favor of
intramural athletics, according to the
vote taken in house meetings last night.
Of these, five were unanimously in favor
of the proposed basketball series, and two
solidly against it.
W. A. A. issued a statement concern
ing the conditions of play, which brought
out the fact that the program will be in
formal, games being played at night in
the gymnasium, and that each player
must have Dr. Mosher's consent to take
part.
League and percentage system of play
as opposed to the tournament plan was
advocated by W. A. A. and accepted by
all houses in favor of the games. This
means that the ten houses with six teams
from Roble and two from Madrono will
lie divided into three leagues of six teams
each, which will play according to the
point system themselves in five weeks of
games, and in the sixth week the win
ners of the Leagues will play for the
championship.
This will make it possible for every
team to play five games, one each week
during the period of competition, making
47 games in all. Under the tournament
or elimination system only the winner
would play live games, with a total of 17
•games played.
Results of the favorable vote, house
by house, are: Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Gamma Phi Beta, Delta Delta Delta, Sig
ma Kappa, and Madrono, unanimous;
Kappa Alpha Theta, 22-2; Chi Omega,
17-2. Roble had not concluded taking the
vote last night and will continue today;
so far the results are also favorable.
Delta Gamma, and Alpha Phi were
unanimously against the measure; Alpha
Pi stood 14-3 against it, and Pi
Beta Phi, 13-2.
Before such a system may be tried out,
the W. A. A. Board will pass on the re
sults of the vote, and after their decision
the Women's Athletic Advisory Board
will add their sanction or disapproval,
with due consideration to the sentiment
of the women.
