# BY-LAWS COMMITTEE APPROVES RULES FOR GROUP SOCIAL EVENTS
## 
### 
With the exception of allowing one
1 o'clock dance each quarter, instead
of only one a year, to every campus
organization, the social regulations
discussed last week were approved
by the By-Laws Revision Committee
at its meeting last night.
No changes were made in the Fi
nance By-Laws.
At the next meeting on December
5 disciplinary and election by-laws
will be discussed.
Eleanor Davidson was appointed by
George Ellsworth, chairman of the
committee, to procure some flowers
for Anne Hartwell, who is returning
to the campus today.
