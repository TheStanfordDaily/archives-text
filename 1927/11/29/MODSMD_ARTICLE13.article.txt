# COTILLION BID SALE CONTINUES; HELP IN DECORATION NEEDED
## 
### 
Bid sale for the Sophomore Cotillion
I will continue this afternoon, the tick
| ets being available to all students in
the Old Union from 1 to 5 o'clock.
Work on arrangements for the
! dance is reaching final stages. Deco
rating will begin as soon as the
: Pavilion is vacated by the basketball
squad. Those in charge ask that a
| large number of the sophomores turn
jout to assist.
According to the plans already for
; initiated the decoration scheme will
be elaborate. A tall lattice, laced with
' greenery, will extend around the en
i tire floor which is to represent an old
fashioned formal garden. On one side
I will be a platform built to accommo
date the orchestra. From it tall, white
pillars will extend toward the ceiling
| so that the effect will be that of the
I veranda of an old Southern mansion
iof ante bellum variety.
