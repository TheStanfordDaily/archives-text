Stanford's varsity basketball sched
ule calls for nineteen games this sea
son, including nine conference con
tests and one game with Waseda Uni
versity, Japan. In addition negotia
tions are under way with Southern
California athletic clubs for tilts to
be played there during Christmas
vacation.
U.C.L.A. Added
With the addition this year of
U.C.L.A. in the North Coast division
of the Pacific Coast Conference, the
Cardinals will have one more team to
compete with for first-place honors.
Two of the three games with the
Bruins are to be held at Stanford.
The first game will be held at 8
o'clock tomorrow night when the San
Jose Teachers come up for an infor
mal practice. Besides being the first
opponent that the Cardinals will face,
the game is booked as important by
both the players and the coaches as
there will probably be another cut
sometime this week. Consequently
the boys are expected to be on their
toes. ,

At present there are twenty-two
men on the squad. All of them will
see action tomorrow night with the
exception of Bryant, who is out for
three weeks nursing a sprained ankle.
The men are: Biaggini, McCandless,
