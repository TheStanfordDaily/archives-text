We college students aren't going to the clogs after all, and, further
more, we aren't responsible for the disregard of law or the high tension
under which we all live. The generation which graduated between 1900
and 1910 is at fault, and it is refusing to recognize its responsibility in the
matter.
This is the conclusion of Helen Taft Manning in an article entitled
"Is Youth Rebellious?" in the November issue of McCall's magazine. She
declares that undergraduates reflect rather than create the modern tend
ency to frank speech and franker criticism, and that they are, for the most
part, bewildered and troubled over the lack of definite standards of right
and wrong which they find on every side, and want guidance and more
restrictions rather than more freedom.
Miss Manning substantiates this conclusion by recalling the sentiment
of the convention for fourteen college newspapers recently held at Am
herst College. This was to the effect that it is from the older members of
the family or the community that the college men, and often the women,
learn to drink, and that it is from the alumni rather than from the under
graduate that conies the deplorable demand for a totally exaggerated at
tention to athletics. She believes that the college student of today, far
from being rebellious, is hopelessly conservative, and that he is not trying
to work out a new philosophy of life nor to upset old creeds, contrary to
general belief.
It's refreshing to find a new angle on the motives underlying the ac
tivities of the much-maligned "Younger Generation," especially when
they arc so plausible. We're inclined to believe that Miss Manning must
fall in that category herself.
