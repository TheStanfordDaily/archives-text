# "Six Days Shalt Thou Labor"

There will be more Saturday courses next quarter than heretofore,
according to an announcement from the Registrar's Office. The pressure
of numbers, with a consequent need for more class-rooms in which to
conduct the classes has brought about this change. Saturday courses at
present are confined to laboratory periods but now lecture courses will
break into the week-end.
Naturally, it is to be expected that there will be a conscientious and
careful avoidance of the scheduling of such.courses unless they happen to
be required ones. The week-end of freedom from classwork will become
a thing of the past for those who do sign up for Saturday classes. The
old school is changing.
