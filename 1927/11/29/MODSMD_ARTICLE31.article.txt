# The 						Bummer
## 
### 
Witness the bummer. He borrows your pen to write with and bor
rows your eraser to correct a mistake. Sometimes he gives you your pen
back; sometimes it slips his mind. His intentions are good, but lie never
seems to have anything of his own.
If you offer him a cigarette, he takes it. If you don't, he demands
one, and then request? a match for a light. It is not once a week or occa
sionally that he is out of smokes, but always. There is no getting around
it, his ways arc simply taking.
He bums everything from rides to schoolbooks. As an appropriator of
necessary trifles, he has no equal. The world is his, and when he doesn't
possess what lie wants, which is always, he merely borrows it from the
nearest unfortunate. If you try to turn the tables, it doesn't work; he
either hasn't what you want or lias some reason of tremendous importance
for retaining it.
Some neighborhoods have been ruined by a family of bummers. They
borrow your garden implements, your dishes, your kitchen utensils, some
sugar, some eggs, or even money to pay the milkman. Unless you get
obstreperous and demand your possessions back with blood in your eye,
you arc lucky to see them again. But if you want eggs or a spade, they
are SO sorry but they are out of eggs and never had a spade.
Some day, a bummer is going to ask us for a cigarette. With much
gusto, we shall present him with one—loaded with dynamite and strych
nine.—The Minnesota Daily.

STAFF MEETING today at the usual time and place.
