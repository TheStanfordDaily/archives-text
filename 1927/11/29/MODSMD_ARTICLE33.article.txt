The Editor, Sir:
Now that (as Chappie would say)
rooters' tickets for the Pasadena game
will soon be on sale, students who are
not going to the game will begin to
receive requests for their rooters'
ticket privileges, for the benefit of the
cousins and uncles of other students.
Granted that this game may be
nothing but a financial proposition for
the 8.A.C., we as students ought to
do what we can to preserve at least
the appearance of an intercollegiate
contest. And one of the most helpful
things we can do is to refuse to put
rooters' tickets into general circula
tion.
If the students who pass their
rooters' tickets on to others were to
attend one of these Pasadena games,
they would realize that they make
Stanford appear ridiculous. Last year
I thoughtlessly gave up my rooter's
ticket, as did many others, But I
chanced to attend the game anyway,
and when I saw and heard the Stan
ford rooting section (so-called) I felt
that I had played a dirty trick on
Stanford. The section was thickly
planted with old men and grammar
school boys—many of whom seemed
to know scarcely enough to hold up a
rooter's card, and none of whom knew
anything about the Stanford songs
and yells. If I've ever felt sorry for
anyone, it was for the Stanford yell
leaders who were trying to get some
yells out of that motley crew. And I
suddenly? realized that my rooter's
ticket had probably admitted to the
rooting section some prep-school in
fant or some doddering grandpa, who
was giving the team about as much
support as a wax dummy. Whereupon
I swore that never again would I
oblige by handing over my rooter's
ticket.
Better a rooting section made up of
twenty Stanford men of this genera
tion, who know the songs and yells,
than one made up of two hundred
more of their friends and relatives.
How about it, Mr. Cass? If anyone
asks me for my rooter's ticket this
year, let him watch out!
—NEVER AGAIN.
