### Vern Cordry 
DRIVIN' NORTH
Sing a song of twenty bucks,
A county motor cop,
Five and forty miles per hour,
And he made us stop.
When his siren opened,
I stopped the ancient "Cad."
Now won't that be a tidy sum
To "borrow" from my dad?
♦ * *
CABBAGES OPINION COLUMN
The Editor, Sir:
How about that New Year's Game?
Can an honest, self-respectin' scalper
I come right out in the open and take
his profit down south?
—Oswald, '29, '30, or maybe '31.
♦ * *
BfG GAME NIGHT
I celebrated in Frisco,
Now friends, here is the "joke"—
I'm eating at the One Arm Lunch,
That party has me "broke."
* * *
Tick, Tock!
Merrily ringing,
Buzzing so gleefully;
Noisily clinking,
Rejoicing so happily.
Pick it up gently,
Toss it a block;
A soul lost forever —
A dead alarm clock.
"Crom," '31.
♦ * *
God help the men who bet at all,
God help the U.C. betters!
Many a dollar has changed hands,
The Blue and Gold's our debtors.
* * *
MY ROOMMATE SAID
In reference to the ticket, "Gyp" of
Stanford students, "X" seems to mark
the spot where the crime was com
mitted. —Sarah Bellum.
* * *
YOUR MONEY'S WORTH
When you pay a counterfeit half
dollar for one of those upstairs seats
in the Assembly that face backwards.
"Crom," '31.
♦ * *
HOMESICK
(This heartrending little poem was
carved on a slab of rancid butter in
Encina Commons during the holidays.
■ —Ed.)
, I longed to get away,
This world I longed to roam,
But now the holidays are here—
My Gosh! Why ain't I home?
* * *
I "What a Whale of a Difference a
i Few Minutes Make."
And now the women claim that
there would be no more punctured
i tires, empty gas tanks, or stalled
motors if the week-end lockout were
lengthened thirty minutes!

DRIVIN' NORTH
Sing a song of twenty bucks,
A county motor cop,
Five and forty miles per hour,
And he made us stop.
When his siren opened,
I stopped the ancient "Cad."
Now won't that be a tidy sum
To "borrow" from my dad?

CABBAGES OPINION COLUMN
The Editor, Sir:
How about that New Year's Game?
Can an honest, self-respectin' scalper
I come right out in the open and take
his profit down south?
—Oswald, '29, '30, or maybe '31.

BfG GAME NIGHT
I celebrated in Frisco,
Now friends, here is the "joke"—
I'm eating at the One Arm Lunch,
That party has me "broke."
* * *
Tick, Tock!
Merrily ringing,
Buzzing so gleefully;
Noisily clinking,
Rejoicing so happily.
Pick it up gently,
Toss it a block;
A soul lost forever —
A dead alarm clock.
"Crom," '31.

God help the men who bet at all,
God help the U.C. betters!
Many a dollar has changed hands,
The Blue and Gold's our debtors.

MY ROOMMATE SAID
In reference to the ticket, "Gyp" of
Stanford students, "X" seems to mark
the spot where the crime was com

YOUR MONEY'S WORTH
When you pay a counterfeit half
dollar for one of those upstairs seats
in the Assembly that face backwards.

HOMESICK
(This heartrending little poem was
carved on a slab of rancid butter in
Encina Commons during the holidays.
■ —Ed.)
, I longed to get away,
This world I longed to roam,
But now the holidays are here—
My Gosh! Why ain't I home?
