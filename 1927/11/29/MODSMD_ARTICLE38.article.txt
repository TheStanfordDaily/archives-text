The year's athletic program is in
fairly full swing these days, with
football and basketball practice on in
earnest and track, tennis, and base
ball aspirants working out two or
three times a week to keep in trim..
Coach Harry Wolter had his
baseball charges out yesterday in
an attempt to instill in them
some of the principles of the na
tional pastime. The practice well
nigh broke up, however, when the
men started to have fun at the
expense of Doug Lewis, pitcher
and one of the alleged partici
pants in the turkey-borrowing
prank which a number of mem
bers of Beta Theta Pi were last
week charged by police with at
tempting to carry out.
Lewis was honored by his team
mates with a specially composed
"gobble, gobble, gobble" yell and
otherwise ragged for his fowl
tactics.

Intramural basketball soon will be '
upon us, entries in the annual tourna- '
ment for the Hastings Trophy cup, ;
now held by Sigma Chi, having al- j
ready been called for.
Every year all the eating clubs, fra- [
ternities, Encina and independent
clubs form teams, and in addition free
lance players organize fives. One of
these unsired squads last year won
the championship of its league.
The time is at hand, reader, to be
in your shirt and shorts tossing the
ball through the hoop in preparation
for the season.
