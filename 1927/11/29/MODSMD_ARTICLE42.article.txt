"I believe that the students of the
/world will have the greatest effect
on the promotion of international
brotherhood than any other single
factor," declared Ruhi Effendi some
years ago. Tomorrow evening at 7:30
o'clock this same young Persian will
speak in the Little Theatre with the
dual purpose of carrying out his
dream of old, namely the promotion
of international understanding among
students; and to explain to his audi
ence the principles and fundamentals
of the Bahai movement.
