# RECENT OUTLAY NOT TO ENLARGE SIZE OF NAVY, CLAIMS NILES

"Secretary Wilbur's recent approval
of a $7,600,000 outlay for the imme
diate construction of naval aircraft
and aviation auxiliaries, is not an at
tempt to enlarge the aviation service,
but is only for the replacement of
present obsolete equipment in accord
ance with the 'five-year plan,'" said
Albert S. Niles, Jr., Professor of Aero
nautic Engineering, in a recent inter
view.
"The Aviation Corps, which is now
a branch of the navy, is not up to
peace-time standard in comparison to
other branches of service," he said.
"The science of flying is advancing
so rapidly that it takes but a short
time before air machines become out
of date. The average life of a plane
in active service is three years. The
navy is working with the idea of re
placing them that often on a 33 per
cent replacement basis.
"Tho Navy Department's order,
which is the largest order for aircraft
ever made during peace-time by the
United States Navy, is evidence that
aviation is gradually becoming a more
important branch of the battle fleet,"
Professor Niles said. "A large number
of the planes to be constructed, hav
ing a cruising range of several hun
dred miles, are to be used entirely
for reconnaissance. They will be sta
tioned on fleet carriers and will be
used to bring information to the fleet
concerning the position of the enemy."
