# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Who were Notre Dame's greatest
ball-carriers? Why is it that such a
small university can produce so many
star backfield men, and so many win
ning football teams year after year?
"Hew to the line," you may say,
let the Gipps fall where tbey may."
But no, the backfield stars from Notre
Dame at least can stand all the pub
licity they can get, since the late
Walter Camp "chose" to honor only
two of them in thirty-six years with
positions on his first Ail-American
teams.
It was the playing of "Red" Salmon
that first attracted the eye of the
"Father of American Football" to the
Hoosier school as far back as 1902,
but he did not deign to put that pile
driving line-smasher on his first team.
Lou Salmon nearly beat Yost's "Point
a-minute" team single-handed, and he
ranked with the best punters of his
day, as well as starring on the de
fense.
"Red" Miller was Notre Dame's next
great player. His off-tackle slashes
beat Michigan in 1909, and next to
George Gipp, he was Notre Dame's
greatest football player. Gipp, who
died at the end of the 1920 season
before he was chosen All-American
fullback, could do everything on the
football field well, and ranked only a
shade below Jim Thorpe as the per
fect player.
Charles Dorais, who, with Rockne,

put the forward pass on the map, was
a perfect field general as well as a
great all-around player. "The Four
Horsemen" were great because their
styles blended perfectly; they were
an ideal combination on the field.
Christy Flanagan, the flashy halfback
of 1925, 1926, and 1927, is possibly the
greatest Irish ball-carrier since the
"Four Horsemen," and he owes his
success to speed, his brains, and the
help of ten well-coached teammates.
In a recent issue of a weekly maga
zine, Coach Rockne explained that
Notre Dame is always rich in football
material, and that, being an isolated
boarding-school, there are no outside
distractions for the boys as there are
at larger and more centrally located
' institutions. Intramural games and
; intense rivalry between the twelve
halls is a great help in developing
players, and the coach can pick his
team from a squad of about two hun-
I dred.

shade below Jim Thorpe as the per
fect player.
Charles Dorais, who, with Rockne,

put the forward pass on the map, was
a perfect field general as well as a
great all-around player. "The Four
Horsemen" were great because their
styles blended perfectly; they were
an ideal combination on the field.
Christy Flanagan, the flashy halfback
of 1925, 1926, and 1927, is possibly the
greatest Irish ball-carrier since the
"Four Horsemen," and he owes his
success to speed, his brains, and the
help of ten well-coached teammates.
In a recent issue of a weekly maga
zine, Coach Rockne explained that
Notre Dame is always rich in football
material, and that, being an isolated
boarding-school, there are no outside
distractions for the boys as there are
at larger and more centrally located
' institutions. Intramural games and
; intense rivalry between the twelve
halls is a great help in developing
players, and the coach can pick his
team from a squad of about two hun-
I dred.


Where Stars Grow
Who were Notre Dame's greatest
ball-carriers? Why is it that such a
small university can produce so many
star backfield men, and so many win
ning football teams year after year?
"Hew to the line," you may say,
let the Gipps fall where tbey may."
But no, the backfield stars from Notre
Dame at least can stand all the pub
licity they can get, since the late
Walter Camp "chose" to honor only
two of them in thirty-six years with
positions on his first Ail-American
teams.
It was the playing of "Red" Salmon
that first attracted the eye of the
"Father of American Football" to the
Hoosier school as far back as 1902,
but he did not deign to put that pile
driving line-smasher on his first team.
Lou Salmon nearly beat Yost's "Point
a-minute" team single-handed, and he
ranked with the best punters of his
day, as well as starring on the de
fense.
"Red" Miller was Notre Dame's next
great player. His off-tackle slashes
beat Michigan in 1909, and next to
George Gipp, he was Notre Dame's
greatest football player. Gipp, who
died at the end of the 1920 season
before he was chosen All-American
fullback, could do everything on the
football field well, and ranked only a
shade below Jim Thorpe as the per
fect player.
