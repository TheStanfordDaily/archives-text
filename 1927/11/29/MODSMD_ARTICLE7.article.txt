Birds' nests form part of the col

others are shown. One oriole nest, the
gift of Professor John O. Snyder, is
cleverly hidden in gray Spanish moss
and oak leaves. Properly constructed
bird-houses are included: one speci

housed a bluebird family during the
summer.
Plaster paris forms of wild animal
tracks are part of the display, and
include those of the raccoon, skunk,
opossum, wild cat, and doer. Blue jay
and quail tracks are also shown.
This display is intended to foster
interest in the conservation of wild
life, particularly of birds and flowers,
and is part of the work of the League.
