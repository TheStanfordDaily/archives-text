# Dr. Lew Explains Cause of China's Internal Dissent
## 
### 
"China is like an old colonial house;
in its five thousand years of existence it
has developed set customs, point of view
and altitude that are the treasures of the
country, but which have developed into
a burden under the pressure of modern
progress." This is one of the chief
causes of China's troubles as outlined by
Dr. Timothy Ting Fang Lew, dean of
the School of Religion, Yenching Uni
versity, Peking, China, in a lecture last
night in the Little Theatre in which he
attempted to answer the question, "What
is wrong with China?"
"Other causes for the present condi
tion of China arc her attempt to demo
cratize herself, her attempt to unify her
self, and the unequal treaties she has
made with foreign nations.
"Out of all these causes Chinese Na
tionalism has evolved. China has only
herself to blame for the fact that the
country is completely taken up with
spheres of foreign influence, but she is
determined to right her wrongs. She will
never solve her problems, however, until
all unequal treaties have been rescinded."
His final lecture will be given tomor
row afternoon at 4:15 in Room 50.
