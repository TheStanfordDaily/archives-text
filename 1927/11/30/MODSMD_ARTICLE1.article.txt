# VARSITY SQUAD TO SCRIMMAGE WITH SAN JOSE
## Basketball Team Will Play State Teachers' Cage Five Tonight CLARK OUT FOR CENTER Six Members of Last Year's Freshman Quintet Bid For Positions 
### 
Husky Hunt's varsity basketball
squad will be put under close obser
vation when it works out against the
San Jose Teachers in practice scrim
mage at 8 o'clock tonight in the
Pavilion.
This will be the first outside com
petition for Stanford this season and
a great deal depends on how the
players act under fire as there will
probably be another cut this week.
Also it will give the coaches a chance
to see how their instructions are tak
ing hold and enable them to get the
facts on the quality of the men.
Six members of last year's fresh
man team are making strong bids for
varsity positions. Berg, 1930 captain,
shows the same flashes of speed and
heady floor work as he did last year.
Thompson and Hare have improved
at guard position. Stewart and Roth
ert have consistently played varsity
form during the practice sessions.
Rothert and Uobson, last year's guards,
are working together as guards in a
style that will be hard to equal.
Clark, member of the varsity squad
in 1925 who was injured last year, is
trying out for center and guard posi
tions. Elliot, transfer from the New
Mexico Military Institute, is fighting
it out with Clark and McCandless for
center. Olson, transfer from Modesto
Junior College, looks like a possibility
for forward material, which Hunt is
lacking. Cook, although small, is one
of the smoothest players out and will
make a strong bid for forward.
The men who made the varsity last
year and who are now out are Biag
gini, McCandless, Vincenti, Christ,
and Bryant who is out with a sprained
ankle.
