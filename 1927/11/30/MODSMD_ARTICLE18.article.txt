When the debaters from Cambridge
University speak in the Assembly
Hall this Friday evening the Stan
ford audience will be able to under
stand why debating plays such an
important part in English college life.
The unconventional manner and the
whole-heartedness with which the
Englishman enters into the discussion
is an indication of the real joy he
takes in this intellectual activity. To
be president of either the Oxford or
the Cambridge Union Society is eas
ily comparable to the honor in this
country of making the ail-American
football team.

Debates Begin Early

Organized debating at Oxford and
Cambridge first arose in the decade
following the Napoleonic wars. At
that time public disputation necessi
tated the censure of authority. The
university faculty at Cambridge pro
ceeded to confine all resolutions
strictly to questions of past history,
in an endeavor to avoid argument
upon contemporary policies or the
rhetorical diatribes against public
men.
Forbidden, for instance, to discuss
the vital question of the Reform Bill,
involving the issue of democratic
versus oligarchic government, the de
baters would take an academic his
torical motion, as perhaps the relative
merits of the governments of Athens
and Sparta, under whose cloak by
carefully veiled phrases and indirect
references, many a shrewd hit could
be delivered by both Whig and Tory
against the prominent statesmen and
problems of the day. Thus the English
debater was full of guile, deceit, and
reckless humor born of illegality.
Debate for Recreation
These characteristics in some
measure survived, although any re
strictions upon the issues to be dis
cussed have long since been removed.
Today the debate is still a lively re
creation, in which Cambridge men
take part every Tuesday evening dur
ing the college session. The resolution
is usually political, but literary sub
jects and the lighter problems of
science and philosophy are sometimes
discussed in a jocular vein.
Thus Oxford and Cambridge men
for over one hundred years have de
veloped debating as an art which de
pends upon clear thinking and quick
wits. On Friday the audience will see
and hear the English style ably repre
sented as all members of the Cam
bridge team are prominently con
nected with the Union Society, two
of the men having served as presi
dent of the organization.
