## 
### 
"At least half of the students in
France are living below the poverty
line which is $36 per month in Paris,"
said Roy Lee, secretary of the Inter
national Student Service in a speech
before Senior Y.W.C.A. Cabinet last
night. Lee described the appalling
condition of students in Germany,
France, and Austria due to the eco
nomic depression after the war, and
of the help that the International Stu
dent Service had given by reducing
the cost of living to almost nothing.
Lee stressed the point that this is
not charity, but that the American
students as well as others have "a
responsibility which they can't thrust
off even if they want to." The Ameri
can quota for this year is $12,000, and
the Stanford share of this is $150.
In order to raise this fund, the
Y.W.C.A. is giving a bridge tea in
the Women's Clubhouse Saturday
afternoon from 3 to 5 o'clock. Tickets
are 50 cents, and may be obtained
from Sylva Weaver.
