# COACH WARNER RETURNS TODAY FROM CHICAGO
## All-American Grid Eleven Selected by 'Pop', Rice, Knute Rockne CARDS POINT TO PITT Stanford Squad in Loosening Up Process, Hard Work Will Come Later 
### Milton Silverman 
After giving the Pittsburgh Pan
thers the "once over" and enjoying
himself at the expense of Notre Dame
and U.S.C., Coach Pop Warner will
reach the campus this afternoon.
Pop, during his rush trip to the
East, also found time to get together
with Knute Rockne of Notre Dame
and Grantland Rice, of the Chicago
Tribune, in turning out the official
All-American eleven for 1927.
Cards Resume Training
Meanwhile the Redshirts have
brought their brief vacation to an end,
and have resumed preparations for a
hunting trip to Pasadena on a search
for Panther pelts. Light workouts
have been in order for the past two
days, and the Stanford team is begin
ning to chase up and down the field
with some of its old-time zest. The
recreation will stand them in good
stead, for Pop will probably adminis
ter plenty of punishment on the
charging machine and the tackling
dummies until the men go South the
week after finals.
Although a first-string backfield of
Murphy, Hoffman, Wilton, and Sims
was doing the work behind Captain
McCreery and his line, Assistant
Coaches Thornhill, Winterburn, and
Dietz have been occupied more in
getting muscles loosened and mem
ories refreshed than in starting the
regular reception in honor of the
Panthers.
Sideline critics, also loosening up
muscles, predict that the aggregation
which started against the Bears will
not only start against the Pitt eleven,
but will play most of the game. War
ner, however, delights in putting
these little rumors aside, and in
coaching Stanford the way he thinks
Stanford ought to be coached.
