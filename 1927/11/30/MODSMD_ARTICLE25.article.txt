# The
						Situation
## 
### 
About this time of the year, practically every college editor and many
sports columnists are asking themselves whether they should dust off an
other editorial on the end of the football season and the beginning of
basketball's reign in the limelight of publicity. We spent the time in two
classes yesterday morning puzzling over that question.
Consider, for a moment, Stanford's position in basketball. Each year,
with depressing regularity, California always seems to have the edge on
the Cardinals at the beginning of the season, and by the end of the season
the Bears have definitely proved the existence of that edge by winning the
annual series. As a consequence, Stanford students in general now re
gard basketball in a far less favorable light than football, which has each
year monopolized attention for the three months preceding.
This year, Coach Husky Hunt has five lettermen returning: Bryant,
Christ, Biaggini, McCandless, and Vincenti. California lists an array of
players somewhat more impressive than that of which the Cardinals can
boast. A goodly number of its Coast title holders of last year are back in
uniform once more.
The situation in basketball at present is comparable to those "dark
ages" in football when the Bears turned out their now historic wonder
teams. Pop Warner pulled the Cardinals out of their rut in football—
can Husky Hunt do the same in basketball? Here's hoping that he will!
