# Favorable Voting

The Daily congratulates the women of Stanford 011 their favorable
vote on the question of intramural basketball for the "500." Many other
co-educational institutions carry on such a program, and it is logical that
Stanford women should uphold the University's reputation of sponsoring
any progressive movement, and follow suit.
Before the vote was taken, W. A. A.'s statement concerning the con
ditions of play which must be followed was presented. The women's
sanction of the proposed basketball series, therefore, necessarily includes
their approval of W. A. A.'s restrictions on play.
W. A. A. must pass on the program, which, in turn, must be approved
by the Women's Athletic Advisory Board before it can be put into effect.
The women have shown their co-operation by voting in favor of the
percentage system of play recommended by W. A. A. as opposed to the
alternative tournament plan. This indicates their willingness to work with
the Board. The Board now has the task of working with the women to
devise a feasible plan which will make the intramural program a success.
We are convinced that co-operation between the women and their official
athletic representatives will bring about the desired result.
