# University "Movies‚Äù
## 
### 
Another union of two supposedly opposing forces in present-day edu
cation was affected recently at Harvard when a contract between the
university and a moving picture concern was drawn up providing for the
assistance of visual education through the moving pictures. Yale Uni
versity has had a similar contract for some time and the "movies," in a
limited way, now have the approbation of two of the best known univer
sities in the country.
These two contracts for showing educational pictures to college stu
dents cannot be considered in any way as endorsement of "movies" in
general. The colleges have simply admitted the adaptability of moving
pictures for certain purposes in educational processes.
