## 
### 
"The French Academy" is the sub
ject of a lecture in French by Pro
fessor Joseph which will be
given this afternoon at 4:15 o'clock
in the Little Theatre under the auspi
ces of the Stanford French Club.
Professor Bedi6r, a world-famed
scholar, is a member of the French
Academy, and is lecturing at the Uni
versity of California at present. The
French Academy contains but forty
members, called the forty immortals,
who have achieved signal success in
some field of intellectual endeavor.
Few persons have been honored with
membership in this body, and this
lecture affords Stanford students an
excellent opportunity of learning
about it.
