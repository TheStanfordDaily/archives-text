Blind dates are really the most
fascinating things I have ever dis
covered on the campus. I mean, good ;
ones really are discoveries. The other i
night 1 went with one, and I was so
excited before he came. I could hardly :
wait to find out what he was going ,
to be like.
And he really wasn't blind at all, j
except that he wore the funniest j
glasses. And we had a nice time, after .
all. We found out the most amazing j
things about each other.
Blind dates are good for social pur j
poses. I mean they help the bashful !
people get acquainted. And sometimes ;
those combinations really end up in
something.
Of course there are two kinds.
Those who are perfectly darling, but j
never come back. And those who are
not so darling, and just lning on i
until a girl has to do something dras-'
tic like lying to get away from them, j
Once a blind date gave the nicest
compliment. He said that when he
got bored with things, lie always got;
a blind so he could have a laugh. 1
really think that every one's big aim j
in life ought to be to bring happiness |
to others. And if a blind date will do I
that, why I'm perfectly willing, Ii
mean to say, I really do like to go
out with nice people.
