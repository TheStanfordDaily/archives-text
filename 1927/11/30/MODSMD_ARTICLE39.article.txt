# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Beards were common affairs in
sports back in the days just before
the "gay nineties," and the earliest
baseball and football players often
played the game while hiding their
handsome features behind a luxuriant
growth of whiskers, but of late the
hanging gardens and verdant spinach
have almost entirely disappeared from
the faces of those who cavort on the
diamonds, gridirons, courts, links, and
other athletic fields.
Whereas a chess master may still
conceal a Christmas necktie beneath
a lovely bit of chin mattress, it would
cause quite a riot if Babe Ruth or
Jack Dempsey were to go into action
with a flowing beard. Red Grange
would never have made half the hit
he did if he had been able to tuck the
ball away under a nice set of his own
pink whiskers, while many of Big

Bill Tilden's best shots would have
been completely spoiled had he been
handicapped by long strands of his
chin foliage flowing in the breeze like
a ballet dancer's veil.
It has been done, however, but
luckily, aside from the famous House
of David baseball team, few athletes
have dared present themselves in ac
tion in public with any such a crop of
alfalfa as that sported by W. G. Grace,
England's noted cricketer, now dead.
Grace shares with the phenomenal
Jack Hobbs the highest place on Mt.
Olympus for batting in runs in the
jolly old game of cricket. His record
of 12G "centuries," which Hobbs broke
a couple of years ago, as well as his
dominating personality, earned him
an endearing place in the hearts of
the English fans that time will never
efface. His records and his extraordi
nary genius have left an enduring
stamp on Britain's sports history.
