# LEW SKETCHES POLITICAL PROGRAM OF SUN YAT-SEN; SHOWS CHINA'S PROGRESS
## 
### 
"It is a people's fundamental right I
| to have a good government: the kind i
it can possess, control, and enjoy,"
1 Dr. Timothy Ting Fang Lew gave as j
| part of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's political
program for China. Dr. Lew is dean
! of the School of Religion, Yenching
I University, Peking, China, and in his
; lecture last night outlined the chief
; aims of Dr. Sun's policy, and the
problems facing his country in the (
; realization of this leader's aims.
This program, which is "almost a :
political Bible," emphasizes the im
j portance of government aid in China's
j pressing problems in providing ade
-1 quate food, clothing, and shelter for
! her immense and needy population, as
well as political guidance.
Need Education
Another great need is for the edu
cation of the masses, that they may
; intelligently govern themselves," Dr.
Lew declares. Teachers will be sent

I into the districts to train them for
i self-government. When the districts
are ready, they will elect their own
official representatives. When over
half the provinces are thus prepared,
a national constitution will be worked
out, a president elected, and the party
or military government, which is only
to tide over the difficult period, will
go out of existence.
People Progressing
"In spite of the monumental nature
j of this work, the people are progres
sing with a new spirit. They look to
the other nations of the world for co
operation and support, and are edu
cating their own peoples for this re
sponsibility. The children and coolies
are being taught to think in politiral
veins an dthe women too, are taking
as important a part as the men."
Dr. Lew will conclude his lectures
this afternoon in the Geology build
ing at 3:20 o'clock.
