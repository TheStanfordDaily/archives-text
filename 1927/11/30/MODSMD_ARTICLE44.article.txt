# PROFESSOR TOWNLEY STATES COAST REGION IN DANGER OF QUAKES
## 
### 
"All the Coast range from Oregon
to the Isthmus is more or less sub
ject to earthquakes," said Professor
Sidney D. Townley of the mathe
matics department, in discussing the
recent earthquakes in the vicinity of
San Luis Obispo. Professor Townley
is a member of the Seismological So
ciety of America.
"Earthquakes occur more frequent
ly," he explained, "where you have a
great difference in altitude between
a mountain range and the adjacent
j sea. For instance there have been
many earthquakes in Japan. Off the
west coast of Japan the sea is very
[deep. All along the Pacific coast there
lis this difference in altitude, although
jit is more pronounced in South Amer
; ir-a and severer earthquakes occur
there.
j "As to the recent disturbances in
j the San Luis Obispo region, that lo
i cality is getting its share now. For
! years there had been no severe
j shocks in Santa Barbara until 1925.
! Back in 1812 and 1557, southern Cali-
I

fornia had last been severely shaken.
"Although nobody knows the ulti
mate cause of earthquakes," Townley
continued, "one theory Is that where
there are mountains and an adjacent
sea, the rivers are constantly bringing
earth down and depositing it 011 the
floor of the ocean, and this calls for
readjustment. This readjustment
takes place in an earthquake. The
fact that the center of recent quakes
was at sea, strengthens this theory."
