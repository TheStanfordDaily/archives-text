# "EXPRESSING WILLIE" DEMANDS CLEAR-CUT DISTINCTION IN TYPES
## 
### 
"Expressing Willie," the sophomore
i farce to be given December 10', pre
! sents a difficult problem in clean-cut
distinctions of parts. Although the
i types called for are not peculiar, they
demand very definite characteriza
■ tions. The unusually well-balanced
| cast is one of the interesting features
| of the play.
j Miss Anna May Price expressed
j herself as satisfied with the work
J upon the play yesterday."The cast
has made an excellent start," she
■ said. "While materially somewhat in-
I experienced, all the members of the
: cast are given intelligent readings,
and promise of an interesting per
formance. They have started working
j excellently, and the Thanksgiving va-
I cation was used to a decided advan
tage."
1 Intensive work in individual re
hearsals as well as general rehearsal
!is planned for the next week. The
j construction of the play divides the
i responsibility among all members of
j the cast, and throughout the play
there are a number of subtle points
of comedy that demand careful atten
tion.
Contrary to the statement in yes
! terday's paper, the seat sale for "Ex
j pressing Willie" will be held tomor
! row instead of yesterday.
