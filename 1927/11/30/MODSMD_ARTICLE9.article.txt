# MUST RETURN SENIOR PROOFS TODAYâ€”LEWIS
## 
### 
All seniors who have not yet turned
in their choice of proofs for the Quad
should do so today, announces Mac-
Boyle Lewis, manager. If they fail to
make their decisions, the photogra
pher will select the one to be printed.

A representative of the photogra
pher will be in the Trophy Room of
the Old Union today, and will leave
the campus this evening. This is the
last chance given seniors for choos
ing the picture to appear in the Quad.
