# SPARTANS WIN PRACTICE TILT AGAINST CARDS
## Score Not Officially Kept in Workout; Will Not Count as Game BERG, COOK ARE STARS Clark – Biaggini – Thompson Combination Shows Power, Speed 
### Merle Emry 
San Jose Teachers took advantage of
what appeared to be stage fright on
Stanford's part last night and turned the
basketball scrimmage into a miniature
Chicago riot.
Much to the happiness of the some two
hundred Cardinal rooters, no official
score was announced, as the whole af
fair was a work-out between the two
teams. But there is no doubt in the
minds of those who witnessed the con
test as to which side snatchcd the lead,
kept adding to it, and finished far ahead.
Stanford was nearly frozen out by the
Spartans.
New System Tried
There is a great deal that can be com
mented on besides the outcome. In the
iirst place, it was clearly demonstrated
that the Cardinals are trying out a new
•.system of which elasticity is the basic
principle. Naturally this depends on
quick pivoting and accurate dribbling,
and Coach Hunt's men demonstrated that
they have grasped these two fundamen
tals. No Stanford crowd in reccnt years
has seen as nice work as was performed
by the Cardinals in these departments of
the game last night.
It was also brought out that there are
potential possibilities in developing a
strong team from the ability and tight
shown. However faulty the Cards were
in executing some plays, no one can ac
cuse them of being insincere. In addition,
there are many combinations of players
that can lie worked up effectively, though
it may take time and experiment to find
•out which ones are the best.
The five men starting were Clark and
Berg, forwards, McCandless, center, and
Biaggini and Dobson, guards. The ball
was in their territory most of the first
quarter. Dobson and Biaggini worked
the guard position in a fair manner. A
entirely new set was sent in at the be- I
ginning (if the second period, Stewart j
and Cook, forwards; Elliott, center, and!
Thompson and Rothert, guards. Stanford,
with this combination, held the Spartans i
better than with the first one, although
both sets were unable to hold the ball, to i
pass, and to cover the floor.
After the start of the second half,'
Cook replaced Clark and Elliott took [
McCandless' position, leaving Rothert
and Thompson as guards. It was here
that the main discovery of the evening
was made—the smooth functioning of j
the Berg-Cook pair as forwards. These j
two men of about the same height, the I
smallest on the squad, worked together
like veterans. Biaggini substituted for
Rothert as this period ncared its close.
Clark Finisnes
With Berg and Cook as forwards and
Thompson and Biaggini as guards, Coach I
Hunt kept working out McCandless and J
Clark at center. Clark finally stayed and!
this combination finished the game, scor-1
ing more than any five used previously. ]
On the Teachers' side, the heavy work
was done by Maloney, forward, who shot
most of the baskets, and by Kerchen,
guard, who was the mainstay of the de
fense. The starting line-up was Hawley
and Maloney, forwards; Lenstead, center, i
and Countryman and Kerchen, guards.

principle. Naturally this depends on
quick pivoting and accurate dribbling,
and Coach Hunt's men demonstrated that
they have grasped these two fundamen
tals. No Stanford crowd in reccnt years
has seen as nice work as was performed
by the Cardinals in these departments of
the game last night.
It was also brought out that there are
potential possibilities in developing a
strong team from the ability and tight
shown. However faulty the Cards were
in executing some plays, no one can ac
cuse them of being insincere. In addition,
there are many combinations of players
that can lie worked up effectively, though
it may take time and experiment to find
•out which ones are the best.
The five men starting were Clark and
Berg, forwards, McCandless, center, and
Biaggini and Dobson, guards. The ball
was in their territory most of the first
quarter. Dobson and Biaggini worked
the guard position in a fair manner. A
entirely new set was sent in at the be- I
ginning (if the second period, Stewart j
and Cook, forwards; Elliott, center, and!
Thompson and Rothert, guards. Stanford,
with this combination, held the Spartans i
better than with the first one, although
both sets were unable to hold the ball, to i
pass, and to cover the floor.
After the start of the second half,'
Cook replaced Clark and Elliott took [
McCandless' position, leaving Rothert
and Thompson as guards. It was here
that the main discovery of the evening
was made—the smooth functioning of j
the Berg-Cook pair as forwards. These j
two men of about the same height, the I
smallest on the squad, worked together
like veterans. Biaggini substituted for
Rothert as this period ncared its close.
Clark Finisnes
With Berg and Cook as forwards and
Thompson and Biaggini as guards, Coach I
Hunt kept working out McCandless and J
Clark at center. Clark finally stayed and!
this combination finished the game, scor-1
ing more than any five used previously. ]
On the Teachers' side, the heavy work
was done by Maloney, forward, who shot
most of the baskets, and by Kerchen,
guard, who was the mainstay of the de
fense. The starting line-up was Hawley
and Maloney, forwards; Lenstead, center, i
and Countryman and Kerchen, guards.
San Jose Teachers took advantage of
what appeared to be stage fright on
Stanford's part last night and turned the
basketball scrimmage into a miniature
Chicago riot.
Much to the happiness of the some two
hundred Cardinal rooters, no official
score was announced, as the whole af
fair was a work-out between the two
teams. But there is no doubt in the
minds of those who witnessed the con
test as to which side snatchcd the lead,
kept adding to it, and finished far ahead.
Stanford was nearly frozen out by the
Spartans.
New System Tried
There is a great deal that can be com
mented on besides the outcome. In the
iirst place, it was clearly demonstrated
that the Cardinals are trying out a new
•.system of which elasticity is the basic
principle. Naturally this depends on
quick pivoting and accurate dribbling,
