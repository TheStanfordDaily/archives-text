# SCHEDULE SALE OF SEATS TODAY FOR SOPHOMORE FARCE
## 
### 
Scat sale for the Sophomore play will
take place today at 1 o'clock in front of
the Women's Clubhouse. Tickets will
also be on sale at Cranclall's Bookstore;
in Palo Alto.
Work is progressing rapidly on the
play, and intensive practices are planned
for the next week and a half. Emphasis
is being laid on individual comedy work,
since here lies the strength and distinc
tion of the play.
The work of the entire cast is to help
Willie "express himself" after Willie's
father has massed up a respectable for
tune as reward for his efforts in the
toothpaste industry. Minnie, the small
town-sweetheart, is the one who is most
successful, finally.
