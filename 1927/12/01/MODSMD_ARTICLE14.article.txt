# Bedier Describes French Academy Origin and Work
## 
### 
"A l'lmmortalitd" â€”to immortality,
is the motto of the French Academy
which Professor Joseph 13edi6r, one
of its members, described in a lecture
under the auspices of the Stanford
French Club yesterday. This Academy
is as wealthy as the richest of our
universities because it is maintained
by the confidence of the people. It
maintains this confidence by welcom
ing talent, by answering public opin
ion, and by remaining faithful to the
conservation of genius.
The main work of the French
Academy is the compilation of a dic
tionary. Next year it will publish its
eighth edition, a dictionary of usage,
giving different uses and shades of
meaning of each word.
"The Academy has always been
ridiculed. It has been the object of
many malicious epigrams, but the in
stitution has been none the less
exalted by those who have experi
enced the great triumph of being
elected members of it," stated Mon
sieur Bedi6r.
Founded by Richelieu
Two-thirds of the 550 people who
have belonged to this body have been
men of letters purely, the rest having
distinguished themselves in other
fields. The Academy realized that a
purely literary Institution easily
tends towards pedanticism. It has
been reproached for having refused
admittance to men who have really
been renowned.
In 1630 a group of young men in
terested in literary questions began
the Academy informally. Almost all
of them were frequenters of the Hotel
de Rambouillet and other salons
in Paris. Cardinal Richelieu heard of
their meetings and offered his official
protection to the group. The aim of
the Academy as suggested by Riche
lieu, was to set the standards of the
French languages and literature, to
publish a dictionary of standard form,
and to judge the merits of current
literature. But it never judged any
work but the "Cid."
In 1672 the Academy was given the
patronage of Louis XIV who gave its
members a new consciousness of their
role in the literature of the epoch.
Every Thursday the academicians
meet. They are men of many different
opinions, but great unity is mani
fested. All but the three directors are
seated around a table with notebooks
containing columns of words to be
discussed before them. They discuss
what is to be included in the diction
ary. The Academy has the work of
distributing literary prizes in fields
of novels, poetry, drama, etc. The
officers are a perpetual secretary and
two other officers who are replaced
every three months.
