## FROM UNITED PRESS PENITENTIARY RAGING WITH SNITCH RUMOR; CONVICTS ARE BITTER 
### (By United Press 
FOLSOM PRISON, Nov. 30—Low,
ominous grumblings, menacing
threats, discontent, restlessness, hat-1
red —all these permeated the tense at
mosphere of Folsom Prison tonight.
The grapevine, passed from cell to :
cell with that unbelievable speed I
found only in prisons, and known only
to convicts, flashed out a message, the I
bitterest, most disgusting, most hated j
a "con" ever receives—somebody is !
going to snitch.
News Follows Inquest
The news spread shortly after the ;
coroner's inquest in the bullet-riddled
library at which six convicts were [
held to answer for the murder of
Guard Ray Singleton during the at- I
tempted prison break Thanksgiving
Day when 13 men were killed and a ;
score of others wounded.

Officials would not confirm the ru
mor but the "cons" had it and in their
own code they believed it and hated
it; and the slumbering embers of dis
content were fanned anew.
According to the grapevine mes
sage, James Gleason, one of six who
generaled the riots, has promised to
plead guilty to a murder charge to
morrow, turn State's evidence, and
receive a sentence 110 greater than
that which he is now serving, five
years to life. .
