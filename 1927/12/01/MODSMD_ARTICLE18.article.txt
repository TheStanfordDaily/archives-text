MILWAUKEE, Wis., Nov. 30.—
(LP.) —"Of the six hundred thousand
young men now in college," declared Dr.
Albert C. Fox, S.J., president of Mar
quette University here, recently, "it
would possibly have been better if nearly
one hundred thousand of them never had
gone. This does not mean that a boy
who plans to enter the business world
should not go to college if he is willing
to study. But if he has been dazzled by
the glamor of college life or merely
drawn in by the almost irresistable drift
of our time, it is better that lie go to
Work."
