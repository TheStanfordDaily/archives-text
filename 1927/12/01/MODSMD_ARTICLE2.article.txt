Loyalty to the freshman class and
the determination to do liis share, in
the building of the bonfire directly
resulted in an acute case of appendi
citis for Hilton O. Johnson, member
of the class of 1931. Johnson was
operated 011 in the Palo Alto Hospital
over the past week-end, but is re
covering quickly.
Johnson had been suffering from
slight attacks of appendicitis for some
time and in this condition spent sev
eral hours of strenuous work on the
annual pyre. This directly brought
on the final attack. He was taken to
the hospital Thanksgiving day.
