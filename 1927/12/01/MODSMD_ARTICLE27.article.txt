The Daily takes this opportunity to publish a letter which was re
ceived recently from Harry Maloney, Director of Minor Sports and a
keen and interested observer of Stanford students, Harry Maloney has
suggested a rather unique plan which; so fhf fls Nvd have been able to
ascertain, has no counterpart ill &iiy other tiiiiVersity. He has taken the
campus living group situatitiii as the basis of a means of determining
that abstract thing cftilfcd "student opinion." Student opinion, as things
are at present, has little opportunity to be expressed in any concrete way.
Maloney's suggestion, then, seeks to provide a means by which stu
dent opinioVi may be heard. The administration itself has no adequate
means of determining what the students' stand is on certain measures
(the Lower Division question, for example). Is the implication, then, that
student opinion stands for nothing?
The Daily invites comment upon Malotley's suggestion. Following
is his letter;
The Editor, Sir:
Anyone following the forum column of the "Stanford Daily"
would no doubt arrive at the conclusion that Student opinion as
relating to Student relationship is very widely (scattered. There does
not seem to he any medium for gathering and analyzing student
opinion in matters of interest to the tnen\bers of the Stanford family
group as a whole. Especially is this true in matters of student
interest. True we have small groups, such as the Student Council,
Student Executive Committee, and we might add the Board of
Athletic Control. The writer feels, however, that none of these
groups adequately cover the field of student thought or opinion.
I should like to offer the following as a suggested scheme to
correct this situation in a measure:
(1) Either an official or unofficial organization to be known as
the "Committee on Student Relationship," or some similar name.
(2) Purpose: To gather student opinion on matters of interest
to both Stanford and the student body in general.
(3) Organization: One student and one alternate elected an
nually by each fraternity, sorority, and living group (i.e., eating clubs
and halls) on the Campus, such students to represent their group
on the Committee on Student Relationship.
(4) Officers: Such a committee might be presided over by the
President of the Student Body, or the Committee could elect its
own presiding officer.
There is nothing so effective as a frank round-table discussion
to bring to the surface the underlying causes of student unrest. A
committee of the whole in place of a committee of the few would
assist in threshing out problems and ascertaining just what the
students in general think of matters that are constantly under dis
cussion, whether in an academic or athletic sense. A true opinio?i
of a majority will sometimes forestall the criticisms of a minority.
For example:
(1) Automobile problem on the Campus.
(2) Honor system.
(3) Advisability of post-season football games.
(4) Ticket scalping.
(5) Lower Division (changes).
(G) Chaperons at student dances.
(7) Closer union between the honor societies on the Campus.
(8) Additional athletic facilities, such as handball courts,
the proposed Stanford Golf Course, etc.
(9; Prospects of a new gymnasium for our women students.
(10) Is the sponsor system effective?
These are a few important matters that come to my mind at
this time.
Such an organization as the one suggested could well serve in
an unofficial capacity, just as the Institute of Pacific Relations re
cently held in Honolulu, of which President Wilbur is the presiding
officer, is strictly unofficial. And no one can foretell the sound in
fluence that that organization is likely to have on future international
relationships. Student problems at Stanford do not extend so far
afield, hence we should be able to unravel many of them by mutual
family discussions.
Although the organization suggested might well serve in an
unofficial way, it goes without saying that any opinion of a construc
tive nature voiced by such a body would not only carry weight, but
undoubtedly would warrant a hearing from the officials concerned.
HARRY MALONEY.
