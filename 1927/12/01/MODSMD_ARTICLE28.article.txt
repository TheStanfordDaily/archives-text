At the regular meeting of the Executive Committee Tuesday night
a resolution was passed saying that Stanford would not send a representa
tive of the A.S.S.U. to a meeting of the National Student Federation of
America at its annual meeting this December. The meeting is planned
for the middle of the month and is to he held at Lincoln, Nebraska. The
probable expenses of a delegate had been placed on the budget.
Stanford, then, has stepped backward into the easy field of provin
cialism by its refusal to participate this year in the meeting of the one
organization which allows representatives' of student government in col
leges throughout the country to meet. In stating the reason for the res
olution the Executive Committee wording is that "no problem is to be

presented that is of particular interest to Stanford and that this conven
tion comes during 1 final's week."
Stanford is not such a smug place of perfection that it has no prob
lems worthy of discussion with representatives of other colleges. It is
in the informal discussion where the chief worth of conventions such as
this are to be found. Consider Harry Maloney's suggestion as stated
above. AYhat are other colleges doing along this line?
And as to the fact that the convention comes during 1 finals week:
there are such things as leaves of absence, as many an athlete knows.
