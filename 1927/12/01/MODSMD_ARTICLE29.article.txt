# "Just An Old-Fashioned Garden"
## 
### 
The sophomores' week-end has had one unfortunate set-back due to
the fact that the date of the play was moved ahead to December 10. A
conflict with the scheduling of "The Great Necker" by a Palo Alto theatre
necessitated the change. However, the Sophomore Cotillion will be held
tomorrow evening in the pavilion.
For their motif in the Cotillion the sophomores have selected the col
orful scenery of an old-fashioned garden. The effect should be some
thing pleasingly new in decorative schemes for campus affairs.
