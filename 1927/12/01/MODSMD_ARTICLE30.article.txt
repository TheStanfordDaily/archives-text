The Editor, Sir:
Although I suppose the silence con
cerning Monday's Campus Opinion on
the subject of lock-outs may be taken as
an indication that A.W.S. considers it
beneath its notice, the answer is simple
enough. Whatever the merits or faults
of the lock-out system, I can't say that
I think this accident is a valid argument
against it. Regrettable as the accident
was, if it occurred as the result of speed
ing to avoid a lock-out, it merely dem
onstrates the advisability of the four
some involved in it having started home
a trifle sooner. After all, they did know
beforehand just when the lock-out hour
Was.
Sincerely,
A Grad—not so old.
The Editor, Sir:
The library of even Stanford, refuge
of the mighty in mind, fast becomes a
museum of both inconsistancy and inade
quacy. Although the curious sexual re
lations which Miss Tamar Cauldwcll en
joyed with her oddly passionate family,
are allowed to circulate freely from stu
dent to student, the scientific discussions
011 the subject, by Havelock Ellis, remain
locked in some mighty vault beneath the
gimlet eye of a kind and sympathetic and
paternal guardian.
Moreover, why are not the works of
Upton Sinclair placed in our library?
Sinclair's "The Jungle" and "Oil!" are
already acclaimcd two of America's
greatest novels, in a literature which is
far too barren; but evidently the librari
ans resent the fact that Sinclair still con
siders it noble to write for a cause he
deems worthy. Longfellow and other
plagiarists dwell in state in the library,
but the vital, blood-red works of Sin
clair know no place in the building.
If the students were allowed to read
and digest more healthy, meaty books,
rather than to attempt existence on the
fizzenless fiction of the "Perennial Bach
elor" type, it is just barely possible that
their thinking would be both augmented
and superbiated, despite the novelty.
