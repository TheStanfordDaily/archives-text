# Prohibit Oxford Freshmen From Owning Motor Cars
## 
### 
English universities are much more
strict than those in America regard
in gthe owning of automobiles by stu
dents, it is shown by a recent survey.
At Oxford, freshmen are forbidden
to own cars, and men of other classes
may do so only by obtaining a spe
cial permit or license from college
officials. Cars must be kept in special
garagaes, and must bear standardized
lights to show collegiate ownership.
Cars may be hired, but only for one
hour at a time, and can only be oper
ated within a five-mile radius of the
college.
