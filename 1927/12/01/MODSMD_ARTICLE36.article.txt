# CONGRESS PROBABLY WILL REDUCE TAXES $250,000,000-CRUM
## Payments on Public Debt Greater Than Sinking Fund Requires 
### Margaret Mudgett 
Tax reduction and the direction in
which it will take place are the two
major problems confronting the Ways
and Means Committee of the House of
Representatives, according to Professor
William Leonard Crum of the Graduate
School of Business.
' "Amount of reduction is predicated on
three considerations," he declared, "esti
mate of revenues, estimate of expendi
tures, and the policy with respect to the
reduction of debt.
Forecasting Is Problem
"The first consideration is a problem
of forecasting, but it is more complicated
than are most problems of its kind. One
reason for this is that our tax system
has been changed so frequently that we
have no long records of the past to go
by, and also the fluxicating business situ
ation increases the difficulty. Another
difficulty is connected with the fact that
non-current sources of revenues, such
as the sale of capital assets, is included
in the government estimate."
"If Congress would let us alone," says
Professor Crum, "it would be possible
for the Treasury Department to estimate
with a high degree of probability the ex
penditures for the next year. Our trou
ble is that we have a Congress on our
hands that is always legislating new ex
penditures. It is at present interested in
Hood control, and coupled with this is
the desire to give assistance to Chicago
and other similarly located cities in
bringing export facilities to their door
by opening the Great Lakes and the St.
Lawrence River to ocean vessels. Farm
relief is another thing that can be ex
pected. Military expenditures are quite
likely to be increased.
Public Debt Geat
"Our public debt is now about eighteen
billion dollars. A Sinking Fund Law
was passed after the War providing for a
sinking fund that will within approxi
mately thirty years extinguish the debt.
We now pay in connection with this debt
almost three-fourths of a billion dollars
per year interest and one-third billion per
year to the sinking fund.
"The actual reductions in the debt have
been vastly greater than the sinking fund
requires. Seven billion have been paid,
while only two billion were required. The
excess reduction has been made chiefly
from our tremendous Treasury surplus.
Many people, including representatives
of the United States Chamber of Com
merce, are opposed to the policy of re
ducing the debt beyond the requirements
of the sinking fund.
"As to the amount of reduction, Mr.
Mellon has recommended 225 millions as
an upper limit, and has stated that he
fears anything beyond that will result
in a deficit in 1928-29. The Ways and
Means Committee of the House calls
for a cut of 235 to 255 million dollars.
The Senate probably wants a much larg
er cut.
Congress to Cut Tax
"When the Senate and House confer
for final revision, it is probable that the
total cut will be from 250 to 300 millions.
"In speaking of taxes which are to be
cut, those will doubtless be cut where
the biggest political effect will be felt.

Thus corporation taxes will come in for
the greatest consideration. At present,
the tax is a flat rate of 13.5 per cent. Mr.
Mellon advises reducing it to 12 per cent
and allowing certain small corporations
to report as partnerships. The Commit
tee recommends 11.5 per cent. One per
cent reduction is estimated to cut $90,-
000,000 from the federal revenue."
Other Cuts Considered
A cut in the various nuisance taxes,
principally the automobile tax, will also
be considered. Tariff reductions will not
feature in the cut, Crum stated.
■Professor Crum concluded by saying
that in practically all instances Secre
tary Mellon and the House Committee
have disagreed as to the amounts of re
duction advisable, and yet the total re
duction now proposed by the Committee
appears to be acceptable to the Treasury.

Public Debt Geat
"Our public debt is now about eighteen
billion dollars. A Sinking Fund Law
was passed after the War providing for a
sinking fund that will within approxi
mately thirty years extinguish the debt.
We now pay in connection with this debt
almost three-fourths of a billion dollars
per year interest and one-third billion per
year to the sinking fund.
"The actual reductions in the debt have
been vastly greater than the sinking fund
requires. Seven billion have been paid,
while only two billion were required. The
excess reduction has been made chiefly
from our tremendous Treasury surplus.
Many people, including representatives
of the United States Chamber of Com
merce, are opposed to the policy of re
ducing the debt beyond the requirements
of the sinking fund.
"As to the amount of reduction, Mr.
Mellon has recommended 225 millions as
an upper limit, and has stated that he
fears anything beyond that will result
in a deficit in 1928-29. The Ways and
Means Committee of the House calls
for a cut of 235 to 255 million dollars.
The Senate probably wants a much larg
er cut.
Congress to Cut Tax
"When the Senate and House confer
for final revision, it is probable that the
total cut will be from 250 to 300 millions.
"In speaking of taxes which are to be
cut, those will doubtless be cut where
the biggest political effect will be felt.

Thus corporation taxes will come in for
the greatest consideration. At present,
the tax is a flat rate of 13.5 per cent. Mr.
Mellon advises reducing it to 12 per cent
and allowing certain small corporations
to report as partnerships. The Commit
tee recommends 11.5 per cent. One per
cent reduction is estimated to cut $90,-
000,000 from the federal revenue."
Other Cuts Considered
A cut in the various nuisance taxes,
principally the automobile tax, will also
be considered. Tariff reductions will not
feature in the cut, Crum stated.
■Professor Crum concluded by saying
that in practically all instances Secre
tary Mellon and the House Committee
have disagreed as to the amounts of re
duction advisable, and yet the total re
duction now proposed by the Committee
appears to be acceptable to the Treasury.
Tax reduction and the direction in
which it will take place are the two
major problems confronting the Ways
and Means Committee of the House of
Representatives, according to Professor
William Leonard Crum of the Graduate
School of Business.
' "Amount of reduction is predicated on
three considerations," he declared, "esti
mate of revenues, estimate of expendi
tures, and the policy with respect to the
reduction of debt.
Forecasting Is Problem
"The first consideration is a problem
of forecasting, but it is more complicated
than are most problems of its kind. One
reason for this is that our tax system
has been changed so frequently that we
have no long records of the past to go
by, and also the fluxicating business situ
ation increases the difficulty. Another
difficulty is connected with the fact that
non-current sources of revenues, such
as the sale of capital assets, is included
in the government estimate."
"If Congress would let us alone," says
Professor Crum, "it would be possible
for the Treasury Department to estimate
with a high degree of probability the ex
penditures for the next year. Our trou
ble is that we have a Congress on our
hands that is always legislating new ex
penditures. It is at present interested in
Hood control, and coupled with this is
the desire to give assistance to Chicago
and other similarly located cities in
bringing export facilities to their door
by opening the Great Lakes and the St.
Lawrence River to ocean vessels. Farm
relief is another thing that can be ex
pected. Military expenditures are quite
likely to be increased.
