A slip of paper masquerading as a
check and bearing what John Hanson
of the Buckhorn Billiard Parlor in
Palo Alto confidently believed to be
"Pop" Warner's signature, furnished

The "check," made to Carl Swen
son, had no bank title at the top and
the words "Liberty Bank" in the
lower left-hand corner crossed out.
Swenson's address was given as 220
Madrono avenue, but no such num

Hanson said he accepted the paper
