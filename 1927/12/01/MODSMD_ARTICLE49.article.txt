## PRICE RETURNS FROM EASTERN SCOOTING TRIP Pennsylvania Quakers Meet California December 31 At U.C. Stadium PENN USES AERIAL GAME Fifteen Passes Completed in Cornell Game Making 339 Yards Gain 
### 
Nibs Price, University of California
football coach, will return Sunday from
an excursion cast to scout the Univcr
6ity of Pennsylvania Quakers, opponents
of the Bears in a post-season game on
December 31, and his head will probably
|>e busy with plans for stopping Penn's
now famous aerial attack.
This-attack was unleashed for the first
time when the Quakers met Cornell on
Thanksgiving Day, and went over the
Ithacan's heads for a 35 to 0 victory.
I'rice watched them throw fifteen com
pleted forward passes for an average
gain of 23 yards, and a total advance of
some 339 yards, probably a record for
the 1927 season.
Penn's veteran halfback, Paul Murphy,
;was on the tossing end of a majority of
the passes, while Johnny Schober, rated
as one of the East's smartest field gen
erals, was the receiver. It is this com
bination that the Bears will have to
watch.
Penn, like California, was seriously
liandicapped earlier in the season by in
juries, but by the time of the game with
Harvard, that jinx had been overcome.
Using a hitherto undiscovered offensive
power, the Quakers humbled Harvard,
Columbia, and Cornell in a row.
With the experience gained in these
games, and the opportunity of added
practice after the western trip, the Penn
sylvania team will probably be one of
the strongest invading teams that ever
came out of the east.
Word received from Philadelphia yes
terday said that Coach Lou Young and
his squad would leave there on Decem
ber 17, and arrive in Berkeley on De
cember 21. The Quakers, following the
lead of several other teams which have
made a western trek, will content them
selves with blackboard talks while en
route. When they came to Berkeley in
1925, practice sessions were held in Chi
cago, Omaha, and Ogden, but Young
feels that in coming West two weeks be
fore the game, he has allowed plenty of
time for both practice and conditioning.
