"A good scout." That's what they j
say about Cliff Herd, senior member,
in point of service, of the coaching
staff of the University of Southern
California. And Cliff Herd is not only
a "good scout" in the vernacular of
the street, but also, as official scout
for the Trojans, lie is rated as one
of the smartest gridiron men in the
Far West.
Cliff Herd has had an interesting
career, and his athletic achievements
would fill a book, but limited space
will only permit the chronicling of a
few of them. In 1908, young Mr. Herd
entered Throop Academy, at Pasa
dena, California. When he left there
three years later, he had won fifteen
letters, in five different sports. The
scene now shifts to Phillips-Exeter
Academy, New Hampshire. Here Cliff
played football for two years. In track
he won the shot-put in the Harvard
and Yale interscholastics, and, in
1912, won the national interscholastic
tennis championship. He thus became
one of the two "three-E" men in Exe
ter's history.
In 1913, our hero entered Cornell,
where he played on the freshman
football team under A1 Sharpe. He
next won the tennis championship of
Cornell. Returning to California he

took up the study of voice, seriously.
You might say that where he had pre
viously "volleyed" on the tennis
courts, he now "thundered" in the
singing class.
At any rate, after a little coaching
at Throop, more voice study in New
York, and a session in the Navy dur
ing the war, Cliff Herd went to U.S.C.
as coach of the freshman team. In
three years his teams lost only two
games, and now, as Howard Jones'
assistant and official scout, be has
succeeded in putting a lot of Herd
in the "Thundering Herd" of Southern
California.
