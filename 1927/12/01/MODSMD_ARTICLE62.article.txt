"It is useless to expect the League
of Nations to function truly well when
there is no spirit of internationalism
and brotherhood behind the move
ment," declared Rulii Effendi last
night when speaking on the "Bahai
Movement."
"All races and humanity are the
same the world over, and any distinc
tions that have arisen are purely
products of the brain of man," the
speaker continued. "The Bahai Move
ment is not restricted only to topics
pf religion but is also deeply inter
ested in international problems and
relations. To this end it advocates an
international language, world court,
unity of mankind, and universal edu
cation.
"Mankind interprets religion in ma
terial forms. In the beginning reli
gions have a great spiritual impetus
but as time passes they gradually be
come rigid and fall into definite cere
monies and dogma." Bahai believes
that religion must be the aim and
guiding force of society and not .the
drag that it is now, and that the
spiritual force and simplicity that was
present in the beginning is needed
again.
"All religions are fundamentally
alike and to be a member of the
Buhai religion one must accept all of
the prophets pf the world. There will
be no world peace until the conflict
ing friction causing multiplicity of
sects is eliminated,"
