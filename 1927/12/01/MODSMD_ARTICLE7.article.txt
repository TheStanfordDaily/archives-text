## 
### 
"China has sought aid from Russia
because other nations have treated
ifer unfairly." This was the opinion
expressed by Dr. Timothy Ting Fang
Lew, dean of the School of Religion,
Yenching University, Peking, China,
in a lecture yesterday afternoon. The
subject for his talk was "Is China
Going Red?"
"We need encouragement from
modern nations, especially from
America. China is seeking some solu
tion for her political, social, and eco
nomic problems. If no other country
comes to her aid she may be forced
to return to Russian influence again.
"The chief problems confronting
China are those of economic imperial
ism, labor conditions, the farmer
problem, unemployment, and the rise
of the capitalist class.
"With the rise of the modern fac
tories in China the price of living in
China has increased out of all pro
portion to the rise in wages, and child
and women labor has been intro
duced."
