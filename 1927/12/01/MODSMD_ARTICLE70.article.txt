## 
### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.—Republi
can leaders are in the midst of a series
of conferences and negotiations over the
cases of Senators-Elect Smith of Illinois
and Vare of Pennsylvania, both Repub
licans, in the hope of agreeing upon some
procedure which will not hopelessly tie
up the Senate in the busy opening days
of the new Congress.
Advance rumblings indicate the fight

will be a bitter one, highly surcharged
with political aspects.
The first phase of the fight will be over
the swearing in of the two Senators-
Elect. It is predicted that when they
stand up to take their oaths at the open
ing of the session a motion will be made
to withhold their swearing in until after
their case has been reported out by a
Senate Committee, probably the Commit
tee on Privileges and Elections.
