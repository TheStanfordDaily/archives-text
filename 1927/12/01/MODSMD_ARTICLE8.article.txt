# Zoologists See Collection Of Rare Shells at Meeting
## 
### 
A collection of shells, among the
rarest known to scientists, was ex
hibited at a meeting of the Stanford
Zoology Club last night by Mrs. Ida
Shepherd Oldroyd. These shells were
originally of a scarce salt water va
riety which became adapted to a
fresh water existence, hence their
scarcity.
