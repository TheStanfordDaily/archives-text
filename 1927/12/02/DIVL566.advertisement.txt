When Xerxes wept
THE great Persian ruler gazed from a hill
top upon his vast army of a million men.
It was the largest army that had ever existed.
And he turned away with tears in his eyes
because in a hundred years all trace of it
would be gone. That army was a symbol of
power, destructive and transient.
Today in one machine, now being built in the
General Electric shops, there is combined
the muscular energy of two million men. This
bine vT.th great machine, a steam turbine, is also a
ooo"horse porPvTb'; symbol of power—a new power that is con
installed in the new station structive and permanent.
