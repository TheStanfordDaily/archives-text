# EXPECT MURAL TRACK RECORDS TO FALL TODAY
## Moonlight Relays Feature of Preliminaries; Hables Individual Star DISCUS MARK IS BROKEN Finals Start at 3 O'clock; Sprinters Should Turn In Fast Races 
### 
One record was broken in the tflals
of the fall intramural track meet yes
terday and six move may go by the
boards in the finals, which start at
3 o'clock today. The 100 and 220*
dashes, the relay, and the two-mile
are nearly sure to fall today, and the
quarter and high jump will come
close.
Stewart Way, El Campo, tossed the
discus more than 137 feet, bettering
by three feet the record set by Krenz
last year. Vincent, Delta Tau, is lead
ing the high jump with five feet nine
inches, which is slightly less than the
record.
Les Hables, Breakers, turned in the
star performance of the day, qualify
ing in the 100, 220, and 440 yard runs,
and running a fast lap on the relay
team. Either Hables or Doe, Breakers,
is expected to break both dash rec
ords, as each has turned in far better
times than these this year.
The feature of the day was the
moonlit relay heats, in which Theta
Chi, Delta Tau, Breakers, and Encina
3W qualified. The Encina team turned
in the best time, 140 1-5, which is
just one-fifth of a second more than
the record.
No startling track times were
made yesterday, but some fast
races should be turned in today. No
team has any great edge because the
men qualifying are spread among a
great many organizations. A couple
of firsts and a few seconds will make
any team a contender for points,
which will count toward the annual
intramural trophy.
