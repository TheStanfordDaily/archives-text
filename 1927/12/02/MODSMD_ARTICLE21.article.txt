# W.M. DAVIS SHOWS EARTH'S ROTATION BY MEANS OF PENDULUM
## 
### 
Professor W. M. Davis, lecturer in
Physiography, exhibited a Foucault
pendulum and explained its demonstra
tion of the rotation of the earth yes
terday afternoon in the first-floor hall
of the Geology building.
The defective force of the earth's
rotation thus illustrated is of import
ance in determining the curvature of
ocean currents and the oblique flow
of the winds. It is thought to be ef
fective in causing lateral erosion by
certain rivers and in deviating can
non balls and rifle bullets from the
line of aim.
was made by measuring the angle
will be made by measuring the angle
of deflection of the pendulum's swing
in a given measure of time, such as
three or four minutes.
