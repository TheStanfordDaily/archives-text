# SCHEDULE FRESHMAN SCRIMMAGE AGAINST VARSITY HOOP SQUAD
## 
### 
With the playing of its second inter
class game against the juniors last night,
the freshman basketball team is rapidly
rounding into good early season form
and beginning to show a semblance of
real teamwork, as a result of which they
will be scrimmaged against the varsity
this afternoon at 4 o'clock in the Palo
Alto High School court.
Assistant Coach "Muggs" Mitchell is
devoting most of the practice periods
to the development of a good defensive,
since it is still early in the season and
the players are not well enough acquaint
ed with each other to learn many offen
sive plays.
