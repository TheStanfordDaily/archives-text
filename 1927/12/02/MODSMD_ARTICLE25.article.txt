# SPEED LIMIT ON CAMPUS IS CUT DOWN FROM FORTY TO TWENTY MILES PER HOUR
## Mountain View Judge Points Out State Law Applies To University 
### Calvin Wood 
I'orty miles per hour is not permis
sible on campus roads, Judge E. L. Max
well of Mountain View lias found. In a
case of speed law violation tried Novem
ber 2.3 the court ruled that the forty
mile limit announced as applying on
Palm Drive, when campus traffic regu
lation was recently taken over by the
Men's Council, cannot be upheld, as con
trary to a state law.
When asked yesterday about the deci
jsion, bred Frehe, foreman of outside
i properties and ex-officio bead of campus
traffic regulation, declared that signs stat
ing the speed limit as twenty miles per
hour soon will be installed along local
roads.
Fred Wool, chairman of the Men's
Council, agreed that the more liberal rate
first determined upon could not be up
held by the Council, and it is expected
traffiic violations under the new rule are
to be watched in the same manner as
the Council previously announced it
i would prosecute violations.
The clause in the state law which ne
cessitates the change states the low speed
limit as applying to business districts and
the grounds of state institutions. Judge
Maxwell ruled that Stanford is a state
institution, since it is regulated by the
state.
Officer N. Lardner entered charges in
the Mountain View court against John
H. Neikirk for having gone forty miles
an hour in a fifteen-mile zone. Neikirk,
! appearing in court November 17, pled not
guilty. In the trial of the case, Niekirk
did not deny having traveled forty miles
an hour in the fifteen-mile zone, but did
j argue that the campus was not a re
stricted speed limit district. He was fined
I by the court and the fine was suspended.
