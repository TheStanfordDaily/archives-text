To "go down" to Oxford or Cambridge is to commence a university
education par excellence. Not an American college freshman but envies
the crop of British youths who each year enter the two leading univer
sities of England. Remote as Californians are from these centers of
learning, they have come, through the influence of literature and reputa
tion, to know and love their ivied halls. Without question there are many
here who are better acquainted with the literary and scientific achieve
ments of Oxford and Cambridge than with those of, say, Princeton or
Johns Hopkins.
England, indeed, is no "foreign" nation. Our debt to her thought and
knowledge, of both the present and the past, (we will argue that later,
Mr. Thompson) still makes us dependent upon the mother land.
We prefer to think of the Cambridge debaters, Messrs. M. A. B.
King-Hamilton, H. L. Elvin, and H. M. Foot, as emissaries or ambassa
dors rather than as educational products on exhibition before us. Stan
ford remembers the stimulating effect resulting from the appearance here
two years ago of Woodruff, Mac Donald and Hollis of Oxford. While
our present visitors would probably not take kindly to the statement that
we know Cambridge best through the Oxonians, still it is to be admitted
that we will flock to the debate tonight with relish for it whetted by the
recollection of the memorable Stanford-Oxford argument on prohibition.
When the hecklers take the platform tonight, there will be represented
three lawyers, one student of history, a Socialist, and a student of the
classics, and there also will be four athletes in the company, the three
Englishmen and John Truman. Elvin won the half-mile last year against
Oxford and ran that race in the Oxford and Cambridge vs. Yale and
Harvard meet. King-Hamilton plays football, hockey, and cricket, and
Foot is an oarsman. All-around development like this is seldom shown
by American debaters, and it is only Johnny Truman's work in the two
mile which Stanford has to match against such distinguished records.
Debating, however, is the first love of all the men; so be prepared to
expect an altogether brilliant clash of wit, logic, and fact. They carry
the British flag on an altogether welcome mission.
