Stanford's women have demonstrated that they do not possess the
provincialism of which we spoke yesterday in connection with the Ex
ecutive Committee's decision not to send a delegate to the meeting of the
National Student Federation of America. The A.W.S. is planning def
initely to send a representative despite the fact that there will be no
A.S.S.U. delegate at the Lincoln convention.
This means that there will he no STANFORD delegate present, but
one representing only the five hundred women of the University.
