The Editor, Sir:
Now that it has been definitely de
cided to pay—pardon me—I tnean play
for the Tournament of Roses, may I
make the suggestion to the student execu
tive committee that it pass all necessary
legislation that would he required to give
the football men participating in the New
Year's game a block "S."
May I also add that this block "S" be
of the same design—with one exception—
as that provided for senior managers.
The senior managers receive a block
"S" with a bar below it; my suggestion
is that the bar, instead of being below in
an horizontal plane, be through in a ver
tical plane.
Respectfully yours,
FRANK SAULIERE, '29.
