The Editor, Sir:
Iti Thursday's Campus Opinion, some
Grad has attempted to assign the cause
of the regrettable accident on the Wood
side road to the failure of the party 10
start home soon enough. Evidently the
said Grad is merely trusting to his own
past experience. As a matter of fact, the
foursome did start early enough, but the
automobile wheels became imbedded in

mud. Of course, the lock-out system re
j fuses to accept any excuse whatsoever,
so this would not have been a legitimate
reason for tardiness; hence the speed
which caused the accident. I would sug
gest that on future occasions the Grad
know what lie is talking about or keep
quiet.
Sincerely,
ONE WHO KNOWS.
| (Editor's note; IL is understood that
j when any legitimate excuse is given, such
as that noted above, no punishment will
be meted out for the lock-out.)
