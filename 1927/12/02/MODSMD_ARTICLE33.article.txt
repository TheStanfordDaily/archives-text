The Editor, Sir:
Common courtesy, we hope, is not one
of the traditions disappearing from the
| campus. Yet judging by the courtesy ac
j corded two visiting lecturers this past
week, one would say that it is. In fact,
these two men are due a very sincere
I apology.
I Their lectures were scheduled for 7:30,
| and they began promptly. However, stu
dents and off-campus visitors continued
to arrive at intervals of five and ten min
utes throughout the evening, even up to
j the conclusion of the lectures.
! Everyone knows that the floor of the
Little Theatre where the lectures were
held creaks abominably. The noise of
late comers often interrupted the speaker.
Would it not be more in keeping with
Stanford ideals of courtesy to prevent
this, even if it were necessary to lock the
doors at the beginning ?
A STUDENT.
