WHY MEN LEAVE HOME, at
the President.
THE MYSTERY SHIP, at the
Alcazar.
Of the two plays presented by Henry
Duffy at the President and the Alcazar,
the reviewer has nothing but words of
highest praise. "Why Men Leave Home"
is in its fourth week. "The Mystery
Ship" goes into its third week. There
is nothing to be added in regard to these
two shows, aside from the fact that they
are in for a long run. The audiences
continue to show their appreciation of
the Henry Duffy productions, and Avery
Hopwood's farcc, "Why Men Leave
Home," qualifies as one of the best com
edies presented in San Francisco for a
long while.
* * *
The musical comedy success "Hit the
Deck" at the Lurie is a splendid demon
stration by the Navy. It is based on naut

ical sccnes, and as such, does its share
for the promotion of water locomotion.
The show provides the setting for cos
tumes that are unique and lavish, and
the production promises to be one of the
outstanding musical comedies. "Hit the
Dcek" won a great reputation on Broad
way, and its several popular melodies
have leaped into favor. Among those are
"Hallelujah," a haunting Negro "spir
itual," and an irresistible composition en
titled "Sometimes I'm Happy."
* * *
Light opera being the offspring of
grand opera, it follows in its parent's
footsteps. The statement is inspired by
the music in "Blossom Time," which is
returning to San Francisco next week
for the fourth time. Much that is char
acteristic of contemporaneous good mu
sic finds a reflection—a rather dim one,
but still a reflection—in the score of this
admirable musical success. There is a
thoroughly interesting, melodious score.
There is a close cogency between music
and dramatic action. There are no "hits"
at all. There is, instead, a cohesive story
told dramatically and convincingly by
both word and melody.

Light opera being the offspring of
grand opera, it follows in its parent's
footsteps. The statement is inspired by
the music in "Blossom Time," which is
returning to San Francisco next week
for the fourth time. Much that is char
acteristic of contemporaneous good mu
sic finds a reflection—a rather dim one,
but still a reflection—in the score of this
admirable musical success. There is a
thoroughly interesting, melodious score.
There is a close cogency between music
and dramatic action. There are no "hits"
at all. There is, instead, a cohesive story
told dramatically and convincingly by
both word and melody.
