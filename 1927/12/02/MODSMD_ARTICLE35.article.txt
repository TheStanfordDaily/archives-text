Campus lectures are on such a variety
of things that it really is awfully hard
for a girl to try to keep up with them.
But the other night I simply couldn't re
sist going to hear Ruhi Effendi. I mean
he had such an interesting name.
And I actually enjoyed the lecture.
There were so many diverting influences,
like people coming in all the time, hours
after he started to speak. And it was
such fun, trying to guess which hoard
would creak first. I mean the floor of
the Little Theatre makes more noise.
There was the quaintest lady there who
sat near me. She brought a little girl
with her, and they both sat all through
the lecture knitting white socks. I rather
like the click, click of knitting needles.
And then there was the cutest little kit
ten that mewed all the time. I know it
must have been terribly hungry.
But the thing that impressed rac was
how considerate Mr. Effendi was of the
people coming in late. I mean, he stopped
and waited for them to get seated, and
then he continued with his lecture.
There was one thing that was said that
really impressed me as having something
to do with college students. Individual
investigation. 1 mean, that is what we
have to do to get our work after we hear
some of the lectures that professors give
us.
I mean it would help a lot if the pro
fessors would not follow so closely all
the principles of that idea, even if it is
good for religion. But I really did gel
a lot of nice ideas from the lecture.
