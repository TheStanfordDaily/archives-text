# FLYER VOTED MONEY TO BUILD VERTICALLY ASCENDING AEROPLANE
## 
### 
A twenty-four-year old pilot has been
j voted $75,000 by the Curtis Airplane
Company to build a revolutionary type of
! air machine which rises and descends
' vertically.
I Professor Elliott G. Reid of the Aero
j nautics Department recently received a
j full description of the new machine from
! its inventor with whom he attended the
University of Michigan.
"M. B. Bleecker, the inventor of the
new design, claims to have conceived the
j idea of the vertically rising machine
| while still an undergraduate at Michigan,
| and to have taken his idea to engineers
of the Curtis Company in whose labora
tories he has been working out his de
sign. Model tests conducted there have
indicated that the machine will be a suc
cess," Reid says.
Low Speed
"Though these tests have demonstrated
that the maximum speed of the machine
will not be more than fifty or sixty miles
per hour, it has nevertheless great possi
bilities both as a military machine for
observation and photography, and as a
conveyance for passengers and mail be
tween outlying fields and the heart of
the city.
"The machine has an overhead propel
ler which provides the main lifting pow
er. In case the engines stop, this lifting
propellor becomes a windmill, and with
its blades properly adjusted by the pilot,
the wind will rotate it so that it will
have a parachute effect sufficiently great
to reduce the rate of descent within safe
limits.
"Bleecker's invention has accomplished
the hitherto unsurmounted obstacle in
the science of perpendicular flight. Its
body will not have the tendency to rotate
as the Helicopter and other such ma
chines do. It involves the basic principles
of both the Helicopter and the. Auto-
Gyro, but differs from both in that its
motors are on the edge of the main pro
peller blades. These small motors op
erate auxiliary propellers which rotate
the large lifting propeller."
