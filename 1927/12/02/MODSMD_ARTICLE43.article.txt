## THE
						COLISEUM GAME 
### 
The eyes of the West will focus
upon the Los Angeles Coliseum tomor
row, for there the Washington Hus
kies and the U.S.C. Trojans will light
the final Coast Conference battle of
the season, and U.S.C. will attempt to
retain its place at the head of the
rating, where it stands with Stanford
and Idaho in a triple tie.
Not only the West's optics, but
the attention of the nations as
well will follow tomorrow's game,
because U.S C. has just returned
from the Notre Dame fracas,
where a number of all-American
records were made, including
those of attendance and hard
luck. The latter has been dogging
the Trojans all season. It would
be to Stanford's advantage if the
Lady again were deaf to the peti
tions of Los Angeles tomorrow,
for a win by Washington would
leave only Stanford and Idaho
tied for the title.

Tickets for the game virtually are
all gone. Which means just another
sell-out for the Coliseum. This stadium
has been one of the most successful
on the Coast this year; contrast the
heavy duty it has done with the easy
season the Stanford stadium has had.
One sell-out and nothing even ap
proximating this again induces that
"lean and hungry look" on the coun
tenance of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.

BASKETBALL SITUATION
The defeat of the basketball
five at the hands of San Jose
State is sweetened by the news
that the team is changing its style
of play. Pivoting and accurate
dribbling are fundamentals that
the team has grasped, and a five
that can accomplish those actions
with facility and speed can make
any game exciting.

STRAINED MUSCLES
It was thoughtless of the Intra
mural Committee to schedule the
track meet for the week-end on
which the Cotillion holds sway.
It bodes ill for the usual graceful
execution of such dances as the
blackbottom and the Kinkajou
which distinguishes Stanford par
ties that the male element should
have to strain the essential leg
muscles in a last mad spurt for
the honor of the house.
If your partner crumples over
with a charley horse on the floor
tonight, we can assure you the
meet will have been the cause.
The Daily is unable to confirm
the rumor that Wallace Denny
has been secured by the Cotillion
committee to attend the dance in
order to care for cases of sudden
crippling.
