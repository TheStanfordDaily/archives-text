"Students in Russian schools are rep
resented almost equally with the faculty,"
said Mrs. E. S. Anderson in a talk on

Clubhouse yesterday. "In discipline, ad

ter they play an important part. There
are three types of students: those who
are paid as representatives of an indus
trial union, those who are unpaid but
pay no tuition, and those who pay a tui
tion in proportion to their income.
"There is no social dancing in Russia,"
the speaker continued. "It is considered
a holdover from the bourgeoise and is
thought to keep the minds of the workers
off the work of the day."
