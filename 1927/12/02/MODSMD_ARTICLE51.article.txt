# SPORTS OF 1927
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Walkers have done their bit in the I
history of the world, and there have
been many famous Walkers in sports
—not counting sleep-walkers and jay
walkers —and one of the clan, James
J. Walker, is now Mayor of New
York City. "Hizzoner," when in the ■
New York State Senate, fathered the
present boxing law, and incidentally
gave to the Empire State the chance
to enjoy Sunday baseball.
Mickey Walker, formerly world's
welterweight champion and at pres
ent the middleweight king, is the most
famous of the athletic Walkers. It
seems only a little while ago that they
were talking of matching Mickey
with Benny Leonard, then lightweight
titleholder, and now here he is knock- j
ing out ex-light-heavyweight champ- i
ion Mike McTigue and making threat- I
ening gestures at Gene Tunney!
You have, of course, heard how the
Walker Cup, donated by George Her
bert Walker, and competed for by the
very best "gentleman amateurs" of
England and America. Curt Walker 1
is an outfielder for the Cincinnati

Reds, and two or three years ago the
Giants tried out an outfielder named
Frank Walker, who was labelled
"baseball's champion business man"
because he had sold himself to John
McGraw and pocketed the purchase
price.
Cyril Walker jumped into fame with
a bang in 1924 by winning the na
tional open golf championship from
a Mr. Jones, of whom you've heard.
But Cyril fell by the wayside the fol
lowing year. Then there is "Goat"
Walker, shown above, and Archie
Walker, a welterweight contender.
