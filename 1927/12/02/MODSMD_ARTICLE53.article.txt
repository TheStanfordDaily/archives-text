# HUNT PUTS VARSITY CAGE MEN THROUGH INTENSIVE WORKOUT TO CORRECT FAULTS
## Work on Floor, Passing Are Stressed; Olsen, Berg Used at Forward

Coach Husky Hunt drove his varsity
basketball players through two hours of
intensive scrimmage yesterday afternoon,
partly for the purpose of correcting some
of the errors in the Teachers' game and
partly to emphasize once more some of
the finer points that they forgot to use
against the Spartans.
Floor work and passing, the outstand
ing faults in the disaster Wednesday
night, were repeatedly stressed. Often
the play was haulted to retrace a bad or
inaccurate pass, and it had to be mas
tered correctly before scrimmage could j
continue.
i 1 here was no bunching of men on of
fensive plays as was seen in the San Jose
j contest. Each man covered his zone in
j enemy territory and did not run back
to leave the player with the ball to care
for himself. Bucket shots and follow-up
shots were practiced; try for goal shots
were arched higher, and better results
' were obtained.
Olsen, forward and transfer from Mo
desto Junior College, was shifted to play
opposite of Berg. Both of these men ex
celled other forward sets. They arc little
I and lithe and they play fast basketball.
With Clark as center, Berg and Olsen,
forwards, Rothert and Simkins, guards,
a combination was developed that over
whelmed its practice opponents. Wheth
er this set can remain ahead of them is
| only guess work, but regardless, they still
lack the punch that would have saved
the Cardinals from the Teachers.
