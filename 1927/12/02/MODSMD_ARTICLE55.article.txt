# WASHINGTON OUT TO BEAT TROJANS
## HUSKY PACK IN FIGHTING MOOD FOR U.S.C. TILT Struggle for Supremacy Will Rest Between Purple Backfield, Drury 
### Milton Silverman 
Coach Enoch Bagshaw and his howl
ing pack of Huskies will invade Troy
tomorrow, and the few Stanford fans
in the Los Angeles Coliseum will bo
lending their cheers to the Northern
ers. A Husky victory tomorrow will
not give the Cardinals a clear title
to the conference championship, but
it will considerably clarify claims to
the title.
S.C., having played Notre Dame
last week and lost with what is termed
bad grace, will not have its full
strength to heat off the Purplo and
Gold. These Huskies, when on a south
ern trek, are hard to beat, and they
will be fighting just as hard as they
did against Stanford.
Trojans Face Strong Backs
Southern California will see for the
first time the Carroll-Wilson-Tesreau
combination in action, and also, what
a three-man backfield can do against
a one-man team.
Captain Drury and Edelson will
once more be called upon to do the
honors for the Trojans, and if they
run up more than a one-touchdown
victory against the Huskies, not only
Washington, but Stanford, will be
both surprised and disappointed.
After defeating California, ranking
just below the Huskies, by one touch
down, and Oregon, tied for last in
the conference, by the same score,
Washington will be anxious to take
its grievances out on somebody.
