## 
### 
The Palo Alto section of the Na
tional Tuberculosis Association has
obtained permission this year from
the Santa Clara County Tuberculosis
Board to devote seventy-five per cent
of the proceeds from the student sale
of Christmas seals to a fund for
building an infirmary for convalescent
students.
There has been recently a move
ment on foot for such a building
where Stanford men and women could
receive proper food and rest without
having to go to the hospital. It has
been suggested that the money made
from the sale of the tuberculosis
stamps could well be used for this
purpose, as preservation of general
health tends to prevent tuberculosis.
