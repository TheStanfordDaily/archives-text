# "GREAT NECKER" STAR DECLARES AMERICAN THEATRE PATRONS LACK AESTHETIC TASTE; DRAMATIC FIELD FOUND TOO COMMERCIAL
##

Discarding his theatrical role of mirth
maker, Taylor Holmes, star of "The
Great Necker," the comedy which will
play in Palo Alto tomorrow, expressed
his views on the appreciation of art as
applied to the American theatre patron
in an interview yesterday via long dis
tance telephone.
"College students should get infused
with the idea that art must not be sacri
ficed for the dollar," lie began. "The 100
per cent Americanism which means 'dol
lars first' is a discredit to our country.
"The average American citizen has a
very poor judgment and appreciation of
aesthetic values. This is attested to by
the fact that most art movements are
supported by private subsidies and not
by the public. Nowhere is this lack of
appreciation more apparent than in the
theatrical field. The theatre is full of
superficialities to attract the mobs. Three

or four changes 111 scenery are necessary
to hold the attention and interest of the
audience."
Holmes offered as a contrast to this
the Russian Drama, which he holds is
vastly superior to our own.
"They use but a single scene in many
| instances and gain their effects by acs
l thctic expression. The aesthetic charac
ter of Europeans is probably inherent.
' In an Eastern art gallery I noticed twen-
I ty foreigners to one American."
His contention is that because this
! country does not want great plays, pro
j ducers must resort to comedy and rapid
tire action with a "laugh a line" to at
! tract a paying house. He places some of
i the blame for the backward condition of
j the theatre on the producers, however, by
' saying that it is because they are after
! the box office that art takes the back
i door.
