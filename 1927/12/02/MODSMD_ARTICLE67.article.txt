# French Puppets Perform At University of Montana
## 
### 
Guignol, a French puppet sho\y, made
its first appearance on the Montana cam
pus recently. The dolls used were hand
carved in Lyons, where the French pup
pet theatre originated, and brought back
last summer from France by Mrs. L. G.
Arnoldson, mother of Astrid Arnoldson,
history graduate of the class of 1927 at
Stanford.
Lyons is the possessor of a little the
atre dedicated entirely to the presenta
tion of puppet plays. The dolls represent
the working-men of Lyons, especially the
silk-weavers and the small craftsmen.
