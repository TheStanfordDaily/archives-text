CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. I.— (1.P.)
—Another Big Three athletic break may
he expccted after a prank played here
last week. Yale students are suspected
of being the perpetrators.
Not long before the day of the an
nual Harvard-Yale game, a huge mud
turtle was seen, its back painted with the
Harvard crimson, slowly wending its
way toward the Harvard stadium. Har
vard sophomores captured him, and he
was given to the zoo.
