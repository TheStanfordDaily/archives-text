That "bald realism" is what present
day American novelists are most inter
ested in when they produce fiction is the
opinion of Gertrude Atherton, interna
tionally known author, as stated by her
in an interview given the Daily recently.
That this bald realism is essentially that
found among the proletariat, and that
writers do not recognize their creative
product as art, are facts that she de
plores in the current literary trend of
America.
"Since the war, romance has been
scorned by most of the novelists of
America. Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair,
and Theodore Dreiser exemplify in their
work this American tendency toward
sordid realism in the literature of today.
"Main Street" Misleading
"What Lewis says of the small town
in "Main Street" is not entirely true. I
fiave made a study of conditions in the
email towns of the country, and 1 have
found that there is, in each of these com
munities, an intellectual group, which de
mands that it receive the best reviews,
and the best books that arc published
j&nywhere in the country.
"Since few of these realistic authors
(ever met a gentleman, they can hardly
portray one. Many of them have strug
gled hard against circumstances which
;would have tended to keep them from
attaining eminence, and I admire them
(or having achieved such positions as
they have, but they write always of the
worst that there is in the group which
they know most intimately, the prole
tariat.
Sinclair Offends Her
"For instance, the life of Upton Sin
clair may be taken as a case in point.
Incidentally, the biography that Floyd
Dell has written of him is the best work

| he has done. It gives a very vivid picture
' of Sinclair. Of course, Sinclair was
abominably treated. His rich relatives
' should have settled an income on him,
i but they did not offer to do so at the
right time; he had to suffer in poverty.
As a result, his sympathy is entirely with
' the proletariat. It is natural that he
| should feel an affinity for the class with
which he had to suffer throughout his
j boyhood and youth. A short time ago,
| Sinclair wrote me. he thought I was the
i most bourgeois of all writers. Although
j I like him personally, I find that he of
fends me quite suddenly when I try to
read what he has written.
"Dreiser has a sort of Rodin power,
j but while there is something symmetrical
| in all that Rodin has done, there is noth
j ing balanced in what Dreiser does.
Dreiser deserves a great deal of credit
; for what lie has accomplished, but 1 dis
like him."
