# BRITISH JOURNALIST TELLS OF PROGRESS ACHIEVED BY LEAGUE
## Organization Responsible for Attainment of Better European Harmony 
### G. N 
J. Alfred Spender, noted Brit
ish journalist, will speak at the
University Assembly to be held
this morning at 9 o'clock. All
classes for this hour are dis
missed.

"Let's find seats. We ought to be com
fortable. The lobby's crowded, but we
ought to find two seats together." J. Al
fred Spender, the noted British journal
ist who will address the student body
at an assembly here this morning at 9
o'clock, was speaking to the Daily re
porter at the Hotel St. Francis, San
Francisco. He had consented to a short
interview, a few minutes before leaving
to meet a dinner engagement.
"There are still enormous difficulties
in Europe. International affairs there
are very much complicated. However, I
think still that the League of Nations has
| made progress toward the achievement
i of better understandings among the na
| tions of the Continent, and of the
j world."
{ "Do you think the United States ought
j to join the League?" Spender was asked.
America and League
l "That must be left to America to de
; cide. It is apparent that America has
! enormous interests in Europe; it must be
interested because it is the greatest cred
itor, even if there were no other reasons.
Participation of the United States in the
League would simply be a recognition of
I one of the organs through which Euro-
I pean policy is crystallized. Even though
| the United States doesn't enter the
i League, there will be some adjustment;
] the reciprocity of interests, existing be
tween the politics of Europe and of
} America, will be recognized.
"On the whole, I should say that the
United States has been very helpful, al
though it has not been a member of the
League," Spender added.
Quizzed on Marriage
j "Are you inclined to comment on
j Lindsay's companionate marriage idea, or
| do you wish to say anything concerning
I modern fiction ?" Spender was at one
I time a member of a Royal commission
! which investigated marriage and divorce
| laws for the British government; also, he
i is the author of a volume dealing with
"modern fiction."
"The essence of all marriage is that it
should be essentially a permanent re
lationship; only when divorce will re
! 'ieve very real grievances should resort
' be made to it.
"i think it is all wrong to start two
young people on marriage which is ex
j perimental.
