The 7 Wonders
of the World
THE Seven Wonders of the Ancient
World were single monuments, M
glorifying one individual or at most a
Statue tf Zeus by Phidias, at Olympic
small group of people. Masterpieces of
their kind, they yet had no influence on
the life of the race which created them,
Ttmple tf Diana it Ephan*
and they benefited nobody. m

old and the new civilization. The Seven
Wonders of the Modern World are the
inventions which have been of the greatest
benefit to the greatest number of people.

to all. The Otis Elevator would surely be
included as one of the Seven Wonders of
the Modern World on all lists whether em- "" " w
anating from Grecce, Egypt or Turkey; |
Lima in Peru, Shanghai in China or Holly
wood, California. It is an international Jl|
convenience, dedicated not to one person JW

or even to one race, but to the comfort ot TT
any people whose buildings aspire towards
the sky. Pharts tr Lighthouse tf. l.'i.xjnjria
