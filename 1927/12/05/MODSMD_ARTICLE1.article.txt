# THOUSAND HEAR ARGUMENTS ON EASIER DIVORCE
## Humor, Brilliant Repartee Is Shown in Debate on Modern Problem CARDS USE EASY STYLE Cambridge Speakers Wittier Than Stanford Men; Make Hit With Audience 
### Herbert Wenig 
Behind the humor and brilliant and
lightning-like repartee of the speak
ers, the problem presented to the
audience of more than 1000 that at
tended the Cambridge-Stanford debate
in the Assembly Hall last Friday was,
"Resolved, That N this house regrets
the tendencies toward easier divorce."
Should the tendency toward easier
divorce be condemned as endanger
ing the sanctity of marriage, the wel
fare of the child, and the interests of
society or should such tendencies be
approved as strengthening the nobil
ity of marriage, helping to remove the
child from an antagonistic atmos
phere, and as restoring the happiness
of the individual?
Vote on Question
The vote was on the merits of the
question, not on the ability of the
speakers. Although only a part of
the audience expressed an opinion
the vote stood, for the resolution 200,
against the resolution 241, in doubt
86.
The debate was the most interest
ing and entertaining heard at Stan
ford for some time. The Cambridge
men were sparkling, and by their in
formal yet lively style they immedi
ately gained contact with the audi
ence. The experience they had re
ceived in the Cambridge Union
showed in their ability to adapt
themselves almost spontaneously
to the arguments of the opposi
tion. An example of this is the fash
ion in which Hugh Mackintosh Foot
•of the negative disposed of John Tru
man's speech by informing him that
""those things which were true" in his
speech "were not new and those
things that were new were not true."
Cards Use Easy Style
The Cardinal speakers used an in
formal and easy style which was un
like the bombastic and forceful style
which the English speakers had en
countered in most of the teams they
have met on their tour of the country.
The Stanford speeches were more
definite, beter organized and more to
the point than those of the Cambridge
debaters but when it came to humor,
inuendo, and quick repartee for the
Stanford men it was like the moon
trying to shine while the sun was out.
To emphasize the friendly spirit of
the meeting and to eliminate the con
test spirit the speakers were juggled
for the occasion. The affirmative was
supported by two Stanford men, John
Truman and Fred Coinbellack, and
one Cambridge speaker, M. A. B.
King-Hamilton; the negative wa? up
held by Hugh Mackintosh Foot and
Herbert Lionel Elvin for Cambridge,
and George Crocker for Stanford.

Behind the humor and brilliant and
lightning-like repartee of the speak
ers, the problem presented to the
audience of more than 1000 that at
tended the Cambridge-Stanford debate
in the Assembly Hall last Friday was,
"Resolved, That N this house regrets
the tendencies toward easier divorce."
Should the tendency toward easier
divorce be condemned as endanger
ing the sanctity of marriage, the wel
fare of the child, and the interests of
society or should such tendencies be
approved as strengthening the nobil
ity of marriage, helping to remove the
child from an antagonistic atmos
phere, and as restoring the happiness
of the individual?
Vote on Question
The vote was on the merits of the
question, not on the ability of the
speakers. Although only a part of
the audience expressed an opinion
the vote stood, for the resolution 200,
against the resolution 241, in doubt
86.
The debate was the most interest
ing and entertaining heard at Stan
ford for some time. The Cambridge
men were sparkling, and by their in
formal yet lively style they immedi
ately gained contact with the audi
ence. The experience they had re
ceived in the Cambridge Union
showed in their ability to adapt
themselves almost spontaneously
to the arguments of the opposi
tion. An example of this is the fash
ion in which Hugh Mackintosh Foot
•of the negative disposed of John Tru
man's speech by informing him that
""those things which were true" in his
speech "were not new and those
things that were new were not true."
Cards Use Easy Style
The Cardinal speakers used an in
formal and easy style which was un
like the bombastic and forceful style
which the English speakers had en
countered in most of the teams they
have met on their tour of the country.
The Stanford speeches were more
definite, beter organized and more to
the point than those of the Cambridge
debaters but when it came to humor,
inuendo, and quick repartee for the
Stanford men it was like the moon
trying to shine while the sun was out.
To emphasize the friendly spirit of
the meeting and to eliminate the con
test spirit the speakers were juggled
for the occasion. The affirmative was
supported by two Stanford men, John
Truman and Fred Coinbellack, and
one Cambridge speaker, M. A. B.
King-Hamilton; the negative wa? up
held by Hugh Mackintosh Foot and
Herbert Lionel Elvin for Cambridge,
and George Crocker for Stanford.
