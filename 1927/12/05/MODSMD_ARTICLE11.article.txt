# COAST WILL STAGE OLYMPIC TRIALS IN SWIMMING, DIVING
## P.A.A. Also Awarded Senior, Six Junior Championship Events by A.A U. 
### 
"Olympic diving tryouts, the senior
national outdoor swimming cham
pionship meet, and six junior national
championship events were the prizes
awarded to the Pacific Amateur As
sociation, of which Stanford is a mem
ber," announced Ernst M. Brandsten,
Stanford swimming and diving coach,
and newly appointed coach of the
American Olympic diving team, in
summarizing the results of the A.A.U.
convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, from
which he returned last week.
The diving contest will he held in
Fleishhacker Pool, San Prancisco, on
June 7, 8, 9, and 10 in connection with
the outdoor national swimming meet.
It will probably be the biggest event
of its kind ever held in the West.
Furthermore, all of the titleholders
live here. With Pete Desjardins, '31,
A1 White, '25, Dave Fall, '27, Guertin
Carroll, and Mike Riley on the Pacific
Coast, it will practically be a closed
meet for the local mermen.
The 400-yard relay race, the 3-foot
and the 10-foot outdoor springboard
events, which are all junior national
championship events awarded the
P.A.A. district, will probably be held
in Encina Pool, depending on how
the proposition can be financed. The
other junior national championships
awarded the P.A.A. are the one-mile
outdoor race, the high diving contest,
and the 880-yard relay. Searsville
Lake is the logical place for these.
There will be no national intercol
legiate water polo meet, but the swim
ming races will be held at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. The Quakers
are constructing a new natato
rium, but if it is not completed in
| time, the Navy will conduct the meet
at Annapolis.
A matter of considerable interest
I to Stanford was the announcement of
the indoor national championship of
; 11)28 in swimming, diving, and polo to
: be held April 4, 5, 6, and 7 at the Illi
nois Athletic Club, the Chicago Ath
letic Association, and the Lakeshore
Athletic Club, all of Chicago.
Water polo there will be the official
Olympic tryout. The winning team
goes intact to Amsterdam, and Brand
. sten emphasized, "from other teams
placing in the contest will be chosen
I substitutes, to accompany the teani
and furnish scrimmage. All clubs and
i universities present will have the op
i portunity to have their men selected.
Iteggie Harrison and Kryne Vanden
Akker have a chance of seeing Hol
land this summer. They are players
| of caliber who should get in as polo
! subs."

"Olympic diving tryouts, the senior
national outdoor swimming cham
pionship meet, and six junior national
championship events were the prizes
awarded to the Pacific Amateur As
sociation, of which Stanford is a mem
ber," announced Ernst M. Brandsten,
Stanford swimming and diving coach,
and newly appointed coach of the
American Olympic diving team, in
summarizing the results of the A.A.U.
convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, from
which he returned last week.
The diving contest will he held in
Fleishhacker Pool, San Prancisco, on
June 7, 8, 9, and 10 in connection with
the outdoor national swimming meet.
It will probably be the biggest event
of its kind ever held in the West.
Furthermore, all of the titleholders
live here. With Pete Desjardins, '31,
A1 White, '25, Dave Fall, '27, Guertin
Carroll, and Mike Riley on the Pacific
Coast, it will practically be a closed
meet for the local mermen.
The 400-yard relay race, the 3-foot
and the 10-foot outdoor springboard
events, which are all junior national
championship events awarded the
P.A.A. district, will probably be held
in Encina Pool, depending on how
the proposition can be financed. The
other junior national championships
awarded the P.A.A. are the one-mile
outdoor race, the high diving contest,
and the 880-yard relay. Searsville
Lake is the logical place for these.
There will be no national intercol
legiate water polo meet, but the swim
ming races will be held at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. The Quakers
are constructing a new natato
rium, but if it is not completed in
| time, the Navy will conduct the meet
at Annapolis.

the indoor national championship of

: be held April 4, 5, 6, and 7 at the Illi
nois Athletic Club, the Chicago Ath
