# COAST WILL STAGE OLYMPIC TRIALS IN SWIMMING, DIVING
## P.A.A. Also Awarded Senior, Six Junior Championship Events by A.A U.

"Olympic diving tryouts, the senior
national outdoor swimming cham
pionship meet, and six junior national
championship events were the prizes
awarded to the Pacific Amateur As
sociation, of which Stanford is a mem
ber," announced Ernst M. Brandsten,
Stanford swimming and diving coach,
and newly appointed coach of the
American Olympic diving team, in
summarizing the results of the A.A.U.
convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, from
which he returned last week.
The diving contest will he held in
Fleishhacker Pool, San Prancisco, on
June 7, 8, 9, and 10 in connection with
the outdoor national swimming meet.
It will probably be the biggest event
of its kind ever held in the West.
Furthermore, all of the titleholders
live here. With Pete Desjardins, '31,
A1 White, '25, Dave Fall, '27, Guertin
Carroll, and Mike Riley on the Pacific
Coast, it will practically be a closed
meet for the local mermen.
The 400-yard relay race, the 3-foot
and the 10-foot outdoor springboard
events, which are all junior national
championship events awarded the
P.A.A. district, will probably be held
in Encina Pool, depending on how
the proposition can be financed. The
other junior national championships
awarded the P.A.A. are the one-mile
outdoor race, the high diving contest,
and the 880-yard relay. Searsville
Lake is the logical place for these.
There will be no national intercol
legiate water polo meet, but the swim
ming races will be held at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania. The Quakers
