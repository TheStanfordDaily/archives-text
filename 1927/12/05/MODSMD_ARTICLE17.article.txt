LOS ANGELES, Dec. 4â€”Three
forest fires and a "Santa Ana" spread
ruin and caused one death in southern
California Sunday. The fires all were
reported still out of control tonight.
The "Santa Ana" had blown itself
out but only after it heavily damaged

the walnut and peach trees and the
orange crop throughout the Santa Ana
Valley.
Los Angeles was coated with a
thick layer of dust as a result of the
storm.
Of the fires, the one raging a few
miles north of here in Tuna and
Tujunga canyons, was considered the
most dangerous. Fear was expressed
| that sections of Glendale would be
burned.
Headed for the Santa Ana water
,shed and the Rincon canyon and
' fanned by the "Santa Ana" another
blaze had burned a score of moun
! tain cabins and 5,000 acres of rich
timber near San Bernardino.
A third fire was burning near Es-
I condido.
