# CONGRESS TO CONVENE AMIDST ATMOSPHERE HEAVY WITH POLITICS
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The Sev
entieth Congress of the United States
convenes at noon Monday in an at
mosphere heavily laden with politics.
Tlie legislative calendar will be un
usually heavy with tax reduction,
flood relief, power control, cruiser
building, and farm relief in preferred
positions.
But as the Congress goes about the
j complicated business of harmonizing
| widely divergent views of these im
! portant matters, oil members will at
the same time be keenly conscious
! that another presidential year has ar
rived and that next fall all members
of tho House and one-third of tho
j Senate is to be elccted —all of which
j adds many other potential sources of
i controversy.
