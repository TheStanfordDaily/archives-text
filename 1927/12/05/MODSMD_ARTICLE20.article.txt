# HABLES, GOODEN STAR US BREAKERS WIN FALL INTRAMURAL TRACK MEET
## Freshman Flash High Point Scorer; Gooden, Austin Tie for Second EIGHT RECORDS BROKEN First-Year Men Make Good Showing; Take First in Seven Events 
### Jack Hodges 
Taking six first places and collect
ing a few scattered points in other
events, Breakers Club, winners of the
annual intramural trophy for the past
I two years, added another victory to
i their string when they won the fall
intramural track meet. Encina 3W
| took second with 15 points, while En-
Icina 2W, El Toro, and Phi Kappa Psi
were in a triple tie for third place
with 11 points. Breakers got 15 points,
j Encina 3W 10, and the others, 3, to
|ward the annual intramural trophy,
i A word must be said about one Les
iHables, Breakers, a freshman from
King City, who, outside of being high
point man of the meet with a total of
Jl5 points, ran a ten flat century,
I which is no mean mark at this time
of the year. Not content with setting
a new low mark in the hundred, he
j came back to do the same thing in
! the quarter mile, running it in 52 2-5.
IHe then loafed through the furlong
jto win at 23 flat, and saved himself
for his crowning effort of the day—
j making up 20 yards in the final lap
of a 220 relay. This remarkable feat
j made it possible for Breakers to
break the relay record.
Gooden, Austin Tie
Gooden, Breakers, and Austin,
E2W, tied for second place scoring
honors with ten points each, and also
lowered one record apiece. Gooden
j ran a pretty mile in 4.42, but made
his best showing in the 880, which he
'Avon in 2 minutes 5 and 4-5 seconds,
bettering the old record by more than
a second. Austin broke the high jump
record at 5 feet 9 5-8 inches and ran
'the high hurdles in 17 1-5 seconds,
'taking first.
In all, eight marks went by the
I boards in Friday's meet. Beside the
I relay and the four broken by Hables,
Gooden, and Austin, Loofbourow, Se
quoia, recently of cross-country fame,
knocked 15 seconds off the two-mile
record, running it in 10.21, which, ac
cording to Pacific Coast standards, is
not at all had. Stew Way, El Campo,
bettered the discus record set by
Krenz last year, with a throw of 137
feet 5 inches. Mainwaring, Indepen
-1 dent, decided the pole vault record
had stood too long, so he proceeded
to set a new one of 11 feet 8V& inches.
Freshmen Strong
Seven out of fourteen first places
were won by first-year men and it was
an Encina team which pushed Break
jers in the relay. In the century, the
| men placing were all freshmen, and
| a look over the records of the meet
jwill show a sprinkling of Encina men
throughout all events.
Besides the record breakers, there
are men in other events who must
not be cheated out of their share of
the glory. One of these is Harper, a
freshman from Bakersfield, competing
for El Toro, who tossed the javelin
167 feet. McDermott, who placed sec
l ond to Hables in the hundred, held
sway in the broad jump, which he
i won at 21 feet 7 ! /i inches. He is also
I a first-year man. Nelson, Phi Psi, got
first in the shot with a put of 39
feet 6 7-8 inches.

Taking six first places and collect

events, Breakers Club, winners of the
annual intramural trophy for the past
I two years, added another victory to
i their string when they won the fall
intramural track meet. Encina 3W
| took second with 15 points, while En-
Icina 2W, El Toro, and Phi Kappa Psi
were in a triple tie for third place
with 11 points. Breakers got 15 points,
j Encina 3W 10, and the others, 3, to
|ward the annual intramural trophy,
i A word must be said about one Les
iHables, Breakers, a freshman from
King City, who, outside of being high
point man of the meet with a total of
Jl5 points, ran a ten flat century,
I which is no mean mark at this time
of the year. Not content with setting
a new low mark in the hundred, he
j came back to do the same thing in
! the quarter mile, running it in 52 2-5.
IHe then loafed through the furlong
jto win at 23 flat, and saved himself
for his crowning effort of the day—
j making up 20 yards in the final lap
of a 220 relay. This remarkable feat
j made it possible for Breakers to
break the relay record.
Gooden, Austin Tie
Gooden, Breakers, and Austin,
E2W, tied for second place scoring
honors with ten points each, and also
lowered one record apiece. Gooden
j ran a pretty mile in 4.42, but made
his best showing in the 880, which he
'Avon in 2 minutes 5 and 4-5 seconds,
bettering the old record by more than
a second. Austin broke the high jump
record at 5 feet 9 5-8 inches and ran
'the high hurdles in 17 1-5 seconds,
'taking first.
In all, eight marks went by the
I boards in Friday's meet. Beside the
I relay and the four broken by Hables,
Gooden, and Austin, Loofbourow, Se
quoia, recently of cross-country fame,
knocked 15 seconds off the two-mile
record, running it in 10.21, which, ac
cording to Pacific Coast standards, is
not at all had. Stew Way, El Campo,
bettered the discus record set by
Krenz last year, with a throw of 137
feet 5 inches. Mainwaring, Indepen
-1 dent, decided the pole vault record
had stood too long, so he proceeded
to set a new one of 11 feet 8V& inches.
Freshmen Strong
Seven out of fourteen first places
were won by first-year men and it was
an Encina team which pushed Break
jers in the relay. In the century, the
| men placing were all freshmen, and
| a look over the records of the meet
jwill show a sprinkling of Encina men
throughout all events.
Besides the record breakers, there
are men in other events who must
not be cheated out of their share of
the glory. One of these is Harper, a
freshman from Bakersfield, competing
for El Toro, who tossed the javelin
167 feet. McDermott, who placed sec
l ond to Hables in the hundred, held
sway in the broad jump, which he
i won at 21 feet 7 ! /i inches. He is also
I a first-year man. Nelson, Phi Psi, got
first in the shot with a put of 39
feet 6 7-8 inches.

quoia, recently of cross-country fame,
knocked 15 seconds off the two-mile
record, running it in 10.21, which, ac
cording to Pacific Coast standards, is
not at all had. Stew Way, El Campo,
bettered the discus record set by
Krenz last year, with a throw of 137
feet 5 inches. Mainwaring, Indepen
-1 dent, decided the pole vault record
had stood too long, so he proceeded
to set a new one of 11 feet 8V& inches.
Freshmen Strong
Seven out of fourteen first places
were won by first-year men and it was
an Encina team which pushed Break
jers in the relay. In the century, the
| men placing were all freshmen, and
| a look over the records of the meet
jwill show a sprinkling of Encina men
throughout all events.
Besides the record breakers, there
are men in other events who must
not be cheated out of their share of
the glory. One of these is Harper, a
freshman from Bakersfield, competing
for El Toro, who tossed the javelin
167 feet. McDermott, who placed sec
l ond to Hables in the hundred, held
sway in the broad jump, which he
i won at 21 feet 7 ! /i inches. He is also
I a first-year man. Nelson, Phi Psi, got
first in the shot with a put of 39
feet 6 7-8 inches.

Taking six first places and collect
ing a few scattered points in other
events, Breakers Club, winners of the
annual intramural trophy for the past
I two years, added another victory to
i their string when they won the fall
intramural track meet. Encina 3W
| took second with 15 points, while En-
Icina 2W, El Toro, and Phi Kappa Psi
were in a triple tie for third place
with 11 points. Breakers got 15 points,
j Encina 3W 10, and the others, 3, to
|ward the annual intramural trophy,
i A word must be said about one Les
iHables, Breakers, a freshman from
King City, who, outside of being high
point man of the meet with a total of
Jl5 points, ran a ten flat century,
I which is no mean mark at this time
of the year. Not content with setting
a new low mark in the hundred, he
j came back to do the same thing in
! the quarter mile, running it in 52 2-5.
IHe then loafed through the furlong
jto win at 23 flat, and saved himself
for his crowning effort of the day—
j making up 20 yards in the final lap
of a 220 relay. This remarkable feat
j made it possible for Breakers to
break the relay record.
Gooden, Austin Tie
Gooden, Breakers, and Austin,
E2W, tied for second place scoring
honors with ten points each, and also
lowered one record apiece. Gooden
j ran a pretty mile in 4.42, but made
his best showing in the 880, which he
'Avon in 2 minutes 5 and 4-5 seconds,
bettering the old record by more than
a second. Austin broke the high jump
record at 5 feet 9 5-8 inches and ran
'the high hurdles in 17 1-5 seconds,
'taking first.
In all, eight marks went by the
I boards in Friday's meet. Beside the
I relay and the four broken by Hables,
Gooden, and Austin, Loofbourow, Se
quoia, recently of cross-country fame,
knocked 15 seconds off the two-mile
record, running it in 10.21, which, ac
cording to Pacific Coast standards, is
not at all had. Stew Way, El Campo,
bettered the discus record set by
Krenz last year, with a throw of 137
feet 5 inches. Mainwaring, Indepen
-1 dent, decided the pole vault record
had stood too long, so he proceeded
to set a new one of 11 feet 8V& inches.
Freshmen Strong
Seven out of fourteen first places
were won by first-year men and it was
an Encina team which pushed Break
jers in the relay. In the century, the
| men placing were all freshmen, and
| a look over the records of the meet
jwill show a sprinkling of Encina men
throughout all events.
Besides the record breakers, there
are men in other events who must
not be cheated out of their share of
the glory. One of these is Harper, a
freshman from Bakersfield, competing
for El Toro, who tossed the javelin
167 feet. McDermott, who placed sec
l ond to Hables in the hundred, held
sway in the broad jump, which he
i won at 21 feet 7 ! /i inches. He is also
I a first-year man. Nelson, Phi Psi, got
first in the shot with a put of 39
feet 6 7-8 inches.
