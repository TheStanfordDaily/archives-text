# JOURNALIST THANKS UNITED STATES FOR LEAGUE OF NATIONS
## Declares Americans Bound To Consider Affairs Of Europeans 
### 
"The League of Nations is the
American foundling which you left on
the doorstep of Europe," said J. Al
fred Spender, widely recognized Brit
ish journalist, in his Assembly ad
dress last Friday. "We in Europe are
trying to bring it up wisely and dis
creetly. We don't want to force your
hands, but we still hope you may
some day be proud of it and acknowl
edge your parentage.
"America conferred a great boon
on Europe when she got the League
and the Covenant into the Treaty of
Versailles. We think and hope it will
prove a way to prevent the disasters
of previous years when the policy of
Europe was based on the irreconcil
able feud between France and Ger
many. Now, with Germany in the
League, the point has almost been
reached where France and Germany
are reconciled. We must prevent at
all costs another division of Europe
into armed camps. Our main hope for
this is the League of Nations, and
we remain grateful to America for it."
Spender characterized the League
as an international clearing house en
abling statesmen to come together,
discuss problems, and bring to each
other's attention points of danger. He
scored the unpreparedness of the
world "not in armaments; it is too
much prepared in that respect, but it
is mentally and intellectually unpre
pared. It has the habit of ignoring
the dangerous things just outside the
vision that cause difficulty in bringing
about the peace that results from
foresight.
"America,"he said, "seems far away
from European struggles. Yet you
have learned that no remoteness can
save you from playing your part.
Everyone is bound to consider the af
fairs of the world as his own affairs."
