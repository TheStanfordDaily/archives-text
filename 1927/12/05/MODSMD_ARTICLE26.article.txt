# The 						Red Tape of the Law
## 
### 
P L. MAXWELL, Justice of the Peace at Mountain View, threw a
bombshell into the automobile situation on the campus when he
ruled in a speeding case brought before him that Stanford is a state
institution and is thereby subject to the California State Motor Vehicle
Act. Under this interpretation Stanford is subject to the same restric
tions as apply to a "business district" which is legally defined as follows:
"All roads and highways within the grounds of a state university, or
state, county, or municipal institution shall be deemed to be within a
business district for the purposes of this Act." (Section 114a of the
Statutes and Amendments to the Codes of California for 1927.)
In Section 113, subdivision 5, occurs the statement that speed is to be
limited to "15 miles per hour in a business district as defined herein."
Thus, with the exception of the county road running from May field to
the bridge over San Francisquito Creek, the limit upon automobiles on
the campus roads is 15 miles per hour under Judge Maxwell's interpreta
tion.
JUDGE MAXWELL'S statement in regard to this matter is as follows:
"I shall fine any cases of speeding on the Stanford campus which are
properly proved when brought to my court according to the law as
stated in the Motor Vehicle Act of the Statutes and Amendments to the
Codes of California 1927, Sections 113 and 114, where the speed limit is
set at 15 miles per hour for a 'business district' and wherein 'business
district' is defined as applying to 'state university, or state, county, or
municipal institution.' In my estimation, the law-makers meant any
university when they drew up this law. If the campus roads are private
roads there is no speed limit set by state law. Unless the wording of
Section 114 applies to Stanford University there is no provision in the
law governing the Stanford campus."
Judge Maxwell has already ruled that Stanford does come under the
state law in the case of Neikirk vs. The People, yet he admits the
possibility of error through his last two sentences stated above. In other
words, our county judge apparently leaped before lie looked.
There is one loophole through which Judge Maxwell can slip in
standing by his decision and that is found in the General Laws of
California, 1923, Part I, Title 379, Motor Vehicles, Act 5128, Title I
Definition of Terms, paragraph 21: "The term 'public highway' shall
apply to and include driveways upon the grounds of universities, colleges,
schools, and institutions. The term 'public highway' shall not be deemed
to include private driveways, roads, or places used by the owner, his
guests, and those having business with the owner, and not intended to
be otherwise used, or otherwise used by the general public." The thing
that may have to be cleared up, then, is whether or not roads on the
campus are "public highways."
questioned about his opinion of Judge Maxwell's designation of
Stanford as a state institution, Dean Marion Rice Kirkwood of the
Law School, said, "So far as Section 114 of the Motor Vehicle Act is
concerned, it seems clear to me that Stanford University cannot be
properly classed as a 'state university, or state, county, or municipal
institution.' "
Now if no other case is brought up and is carried to a higher court
where Maxwell's decision may be reversed, it is our opinion that his
decisions will pass into the limbo of quaint old rulings which are not
enforced strictly to the letter.

standing by his decision and that is found in the General Laws of
California, 1923, Part I, Title 379, Motor Vehicles, Act 5128, Title I
Definition of Terms, paragraph 21: "The term 'public highway' shall
apply to and include driveways upon the grounds of universities, colleges,
schools, and institutions. The term 'public highway' shall not be deemed
to include private driveways, roads, or places used by the owner, his
guests, and those having business with the owner, and not intended to
be otherwise used, or otherwise used by the general public." The thing
that may have to be cleared up, then, is whether or not roads on the
campus are "public highways."
questioned about his opinion of Judge Maxwell's designation of
Stanford as a state institution, Dean Marion Rice Kirkwood of the
Law School, said, "So far as Section 114 of the Motor Vehicle Act is
concerned, it seems clear to me that Stanford University cannot be
properly classed as a 'state university, or state, county, or municipal
institution.' "
Now if no other case is brought up and is carried to a higher court
where Maxwell's decision may be reversed, it is our opinion that his
decisions will pass into the limbo of quaint old rulings which are not
enforced strictly to the letter.
P L. MAXWELL, Justice of the Peace at Mountain View, threw a
bombshell into the automobile situation on the campus when he
ruled in a speeding case brought before him that Stanford is a state
institution and is thereby subject to the California State Motor Vehicle
Act. Under this interpretation Stanford is subject to the same restric
tions as apply to a "business district" which is legally defined as follows:
"All roads and highways within the grounds of a state university, or
state, county, or municipal institution shall be deemed to be within a
business district for the purposes of this Act." (Section 114a of the
Statutes and Amendments to the Codes of California for 1927.)
In Section 113, subdivision 5, occurs the statement that speed is to be
limited to "15 miles per hour in a business district as defined herein."
Thus, with the exception of the county road running from May field to
the bridge over San Francisquito Creek, the limit upon automobiles on
the campus roads is 15 miles per hour under Judge Maxwell's interpreta
tion.
JUDGE MAXWELL'S statement in regard to this matter is as follows:
"I shall fine any cases of speeding on the Stanford campus which are
properly proved when brought to my court according to the law as
stated in the Motor Vehicle Act of the Statutes and Amendments to the
Codes of California 1927, Sections 113 and 114, where the speed limit is
set at 15 miles per hour for a 'business district' and wherein 'business
district' is defined as applying to 'state university, or state, county, or
municipal institution.' In my estimation, the law-makers meant any
university when they drew up this law. If the campus roads are private
roads there is no speed limit set by state law. Unless the wording of
Section 114 applies to Stanford University there is no provision in the
law governing the Stanford campus."
Judge Maxwell has already ruled that Stanford does come under the
state law in the case of Neikirk vs. The People, yet he admits the
possibility of error through his last two sentences stated above. In other
words, our county judge apparently leaped before lie looked.
There is one loophole through which Judge Maxwell can slip in
standing by his decision and that is found in the General Laws of
California, 1923, Part I, Title 379, Motor Vehicles, Act 5128, Title I
Definition of Terms, paragraph 21: "The term 'public highway' shall
