A desirable effect of debates is that they should set those who hear ■
them to thinking, pondering; and that result the Cambridge-Stanford j
clash upon the divorce evil apparently had. Occasionally, over the week
end, you would hear related, even in the babel of talk about all-American
teams and the Cotillion, one of the quips the Englishmen had let fall or
the problem itself discussed.
Divorce of course does not exist as a very real concept in the college
student's mind. The first question most of us must now face is that of
who mto marry. Ten years from now we shall be readier to consider
how often and under what circumstances to snip matrimony's sacred
bonds.
Nevertheless, though youth may be heedless of the question, none
who heard George Crocker's argument against the resolution Friday
night could but give a thought to the case for easier divorce. The speech
was the highlight of the debate from its serious side.

The Britishers took their heckling lightly. They seasoned their argument
highly with wit, and it was easily to be seen that their greatest pleasure
was in taking cracks at one another in a way which seemed almost rude
to those who have been nourished on the "honorable and worthy op
ponets" style of debating.
Certainly the visitors' humor was irresistible. King-llamilton's dry
remark that boot's speech was undoubtedly sound, but "had withal
rather a hollow sound," is an example of what the evening brought
forth. Oxford and Cambridge debate teams always will be welcome here
—they make listening to intellectual things such a pleasure.
