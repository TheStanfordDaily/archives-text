THE JEST, at the Community Play
house, San Francisco.
For those theatregoers who had
tired of mystery plays, musical shows,
and domestic comedies with which our
stage is surfeited today, the Players'
Guild of San Francisco has presented
"The Jest" by Sen Benelli, a contem
porary Italian playwright. It is one
of the most excellent written in recent
years. The merits of the play proved
so great, that it was held over for an
extra two weeks' performance, ending
its run last Saturday night.
"The Jest" is a Florentine tragedy
taking place in the time of Lorenzo
the Magnificent. William Rainey, who
has acted with the Players' Guild for
almost ten years, plays the role of
Gianetto, the cowardly young artist
who seeks revenge against Neri, the
goldier, by means of a jest. However,
fate steps in, and the jest ends in bit
ter tragedy. Rainey acts with all the
abandon, the passionate feeling, yet
delicate grace of the fifteenth century
Florentine youth. His voice is clear,
beautifully modulated and melodious.
His slim figure and lithe body fit him
well for the part which John Barry
more played in New York.
Neri, done by Cameron Prud'homme,
forms a striking contrast to Gianetto.
This broad-chested, deep-voiced sol
dier struts across the stage, swearing,
bullying, and making love by turn.
Prud'homme swings into his part with
a heartiness and swagger that corres
ponds well with his brawn and mus

cle. His acting is convincing and car
ries with it the sympathies of the au
dience.
Doris Canney does well as Ginerva,
the calculating, fickle concubine of
Neri. Although her acting lacks the
polish and experience of Rainey and
Prud'homme, nevertheless it is ade
quate and does not detract from the
intensity of the drama. May Nannery
plays the role of Cintia, Ginerva's per
fidious companion, with good under
standing of her part. The character
of the Doctor portrayed by Ronald
Telfer is ably handled. Telfer's
cracked falsetto adds an atmosphere
of ghostliness to the gloom of the
dungeon in which Gianetto has had
Neri imprisoned.
Fay Wynne and Elsa Heymann,
,who play the parts of Lucrezia and
Fiametta, respectively, are well chos
en for the roles of the women who
have been dragged down by the lusts
of Neri. Miss Heymann acts especi
ally well as the blind wretch who,
also, thirsts for revenge because of
her former lover's wrongs. Frances
Shean as Lizabetta is not very con
vincing. The character of Torna
quincy, enacted by Frederick Smith,
is the only role which is not so well
handled. Ben Legere, who took the
role of the hunchback, Fazio, carries
out his part adequately as the faithful
servant of Gianetto.
The play as it is unfolded is intense,
and dramatic. It leaves one in a daze.
