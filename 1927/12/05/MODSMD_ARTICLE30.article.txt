The Editor, Sir:
Unlearned Frosh that I am, may I
presume? And presuming, may I criti
cize the "augmented and superbiated"
wisdom of Mr. Marshall Kirby, a plus
46 Soph, as exploited in Thursday
morning's issue? After criticizing, it
is sometimes apt to leave suggestions.
It affords the original protagonist re
partee!
If the literature Mr. Upton Sinclair
contributes to is far too barren, praise
be! Though it is not my purpose to
dispel your particular illusions (per
sonally, Longfellow is distasteful to
me, also) is the library to be criti
cized and. villified for not possessing
these "more healthy, meaty books"
when, as you admit, Stanford students
go there only to expound the latest
biological complications? They could
not comprehend an artist, Mr. Kirby.
First, they should read such intro
ductory books as may be procured
from the library this very morning:
Sumner and Keller's "Science of So
ciety" and Roback's "Psychology of
Character" —worthy exponents of this
week's acquisitions. Is it not a boon
that Stanford librarians —though they
may be human and even biological—
deem it more worthy to stimulate
than educate and try and create such
a "thing" as "augmented and super
biated" thinking? Ah, I fear that Mr.
Sinclair will someday be relegated as
Anne Sewell and her "Black Beauty."
Why? Art is an instrument to en
large our experience by introducing
us to the inner life of others. Only
the sham is snapped with a camera,
only the author is subjected to circu
lation. In the case of "Oil," you may
secure the gist of his thesis in one
short paragraph of an "Examiner"
article some weeks back. If this does
not suffice, there are the legal docu
ments in Boston, and if you decide
to remain at Stanford, borrow the j
book from a down-town circulating
library for a nickle a day. They
charge prices on such books.
