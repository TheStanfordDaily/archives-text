THE THREE SOLOMONS
After reading the Sunday sport
pages, we have come to the conclu
sion that what this country needs
i most is an ail-American team of ex
-1 perts to pick one all-American team
j of football players. Warner, Rockne,
and Jones, representing the West,
; Middlewest, and East, seem to be
j better qualified to choose it than
j Grantland Rice, who is obliged to rely
Ion the hearsay reputations of West
| ern athletes.
Biff Hoffman is the third best full
back and Seraphim Post the third best
| guard in the country, Warner,
Rockne, and Jones decided. Well, if
you lean back in your chair and think
lit over, none of the Stanford first-
I string regulars is very much inferior
to either Biff or Post. Which is tanta
mount to boasting that, man for man,
the Cards are about as good as the
ail-American third team.

FRESHMAN TRACK HOPES
At last Stanford is to have some
sprinters.
' The intramural track meet last Fri
day showed this. Les Ilables, a fresh
man running under the Breakers'
colors, turned in the following per
formances: ten fiat in the 100; 23 flat
in the 220; 52 2-5 in the quarter; and
the recovery of a twenty-yard lead
to win the relay.
McDermott, also a freshman,
broad-jumped 21 feet 7 1-4 inches
and finished second in the 100
about two yards behind Hables.
All men who placed in this race
were freshmen.
Harper, freshman, launched the
javelin for a 167-foot voyage, and
Dyer made a time of 26 2-5 in the
low hurdles.
Ultra-modernism is a vague term
â€”"full of sound and fury, signifying
nothing." Even the Greeks had red
blood.
Sincerely,
HENRY RAMSEY.
