The Sophomore Cotillion last week
end was the most thrilling thing. 1
mean, I had a perfectly wonderful
time because it was so different from
other dances.
The decorations were so cute. And
the sky looked like sky when you got
up above and looked at it from an
angle. I mean, it was very different.
But do you know, I never really
thought that the roughs would be so
interested in a singer as they were
Friday night. Why they were actually
rude, they yelled so loud. But it really
was nice, the way someone turned
on the lights so every one could see
whom every one else was with.
I think there are really a lot of
nice looking men that go to cotillions
and things, but the funniest part is
that I can never find thbm again on
Quad.
There were a great many nice look
ing imports, too. 1 mean, there really
were some awfully pretty evening
gowns. Honestly, I wouldn't want to
be an import, unless I couldn't get to
a dance any other way. They always
seem to try so hard to have a good
time, especially in a place where they
don't know any one.
Of course, near the end people
started iu wake up a bit, and we
played Thundering Herd. It was loads
of fun, because the basketball floor
sort of helps you jump along.
