# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Among the great guards in football
history the names of Heffellinger and
Hare come first, followed in close
order by DeWitt, of Princeton;
Spears, of Dartmouth; Glass, of Yale;
Grimm, of Washington; Overall, of
California; and Pierce, of Carlisle.
Homeric players, all of these, with
speed and brains as well as brawn,
who could carry the ball if need be
and boot a mean punt or field-goal.
The two H's, Heffelfinger, of Yale,
and Hare, of Penn, played in another
century and with more neolithic ag
gressiveness than any two, or even
three, of the present day guards. Yet
when big Pudge Heffelfinger, who was
on Walter Camp's first three All-
American teams, came back to help
coach the Yale team when he was
nearly fifty years old, he easily demon
strated his superior strength and
speed over every man on the team.
Truxton Hare entered Penn in 1897,
'98, '99, and 1900. He was built like a
Greek god, and could plow through
the line like an angered buffalo on
the guard's back play. Hare was very
fast on his feet and took great delight
in smearing plays around the ends.
"Fat" Spears, who has had such
success as a football coach, first at
Dartmouth, then at West Virginia,
and more recently at Minnesota, was
a roly-poly youngster of great strength
who proved to be the greatest guard
Dartmouth ever had. "Fat" was All-
American in 1915.
John DeWitt is one of Princeton's
greatest football heroes, and rightly

so. He never failed to deliver in a
pinch, and nothing ever got by him
in the shape of a loose ball. He was
a splendid kicker, as well as lineman,
and Yale and Cornell still remember
his fifty-yard field-goals from place
ment in Noverber, 1902. He won the
Yale game the following year with a
42-yard effort. Walter Camp honored
DeWitt in 1902 and 1903.
