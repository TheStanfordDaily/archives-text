# GETTING HUSKIES ON RUN EARLY IN GAME MEANS WIN-WARNER

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 3—(Special)
—Pop Warner, who was in Los An
geles today to watch the Trojans play
the Huskies, declared after the 33-13
rout that "getting Washington on the
run early means the game."
Coach Howard Jones' Trojans crash
ed their way to their 33-13 victory.
The Huskies got a bad break when
Tesreau was hurt; that with U.S.C.'s
two touchdowns in the first quarter
on long runs completely demoralized
them by half time. U.S.C. was play
ing little better than it did against
Stanford, with only the natural im
provement of time.
The greatest thrill of the afternoon
came not at a moment when the ball
was in play but, strangely enough,
during time out, when Coach Jones
took Morley Drury, wearer of all-
American laurels, from the lineup in
the final quarter. The entire stands
rose and gave Drury a rousing ova
tion, roaring admiration of his bril
liant season.
Tesreau, the tough giant of the
Washington lumber camps, was put
out of the game on the opening play,
his knee being hurt. Bagshaw's men
lost their morale immediately.
