# Miss Price Casts Claire Pierce In 1930 Farce Role
## 
### Hallie Keating 
Claire Pierce will take the place of
Eda Lord as Frances Sylvester in the
sophomore farce, "Expressing Willie,"
to be presented Friday night, an
nounced Miss Anna May Price, di
rector, Saturday. Miss Lord has with
drawn from the cast because of ill
ness.
The role of Frances is one of the
major parts of the play, portraying a
pseudo-sophistocate. Miss Pierce was
one of the best alternatives for the
part of Frances in the original try
outs. The late change in the cast may
bring complications, but as work has
been well under way on the produc
tion for the rest of the cast, no seri
ous difficulties are anticipated. Inten
sive rehearsals are planned for tlTis
week.
Sets are almost completed for the
production. Les Kiler is planning an
interesting innovation in stage effects,
involving difficult technical experi
ments. One of the largest sets used
in a campus production will character
ize the home of Willie Smith, the mil
lionaire toothpaste manufacturer. The
second set, a small bedroom scene,
will be set up within the large set to
facilitate change of scenes, and lack
of waits.
The spirit of the comedy will be
considered in the decorations of the
sets throughout.
