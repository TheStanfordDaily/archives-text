VrCTOR HUGO'S
Immortal Classic
"LES MISERABLES"
A fitting successor to "The
Hunchback of Notre Dame"
The bitter struggle between
Jean Valjean and Javert
graphically told upon the
screen as Victor Hugo
would have it told.
Filmed in France and breathes
the very spirit of France of the
days of Hugo's great hero.
