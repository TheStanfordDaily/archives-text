# WARNER PLANS AERIAL ATTACK FOR PANTHERS
## ”War in the Air" Foreseen As Pittsburgh Rates Overhead Offense USUAL PLAYS WONT GO New Suits Are Practically Assured; Color Is Not Yet Fixed Upon 
### Milton Silverman 
First scrimmage yesterday in pre
paration for the New Year's
game inaugurated a new style o£ at
tack for Stanford. Coach Warner has
always been feeding trick plays to
the varsity, but those he administered
yesterday were something out of the
ordinary.
The Panthers are famed for the
diversity and accuracy of their pass
ing. The Cardinals are preparing an
aerial attack that will probably make
the odds even on overhead warfare.
Easterners Powerful
Regular power plays will have little
effect on the Pitt team. Not only are
the Easterners powerful on offense,
but they have one of the strongest
defensive systems in the country.
Their regular formation is either a
six- or seven-man line, with a second
fine of three men backing up the for-,
ward wall.
Stanford's best chance to get
through both these barricades will be
to go through neither but around or
over both. End runs, reverses, end
around plays, and a deadly passing
attack will be the Cards' implements
to annihilate the Panthers' reputation
•of defense strength.
New Suits Possible
New suits for the game have been
virtually promised the Stanford team,
since thirty-three men have submit
ted to the tape measure. Whether the
eleven will once more take the sym
bols of their former name, whether
they will retain their new title of
Whiteshirts, or whether they will
blaze forth in some mauve and light
is a question for the benefit
of the psychologists.
