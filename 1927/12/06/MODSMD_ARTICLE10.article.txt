### 
With the addition of four new mem
bers, filling minor roles, to the cast
of "Expressing Willie," the production

mores are cast as footmen, butler,
and maid. Marianna Evans will play

Douglas Gregg, Simpson; and William
S. Greene, Gordon. •
Work on the sets for the play have
almost neared completion. Los Kiler
will present an interesting innovation
in the way of stage technique with
this play. The first set is probably
one of the largest that has yet been
used in a legitimate dramatic produc
tion on the campus. The second set,
a small one, and contrasting with the
effect of the first, will be set up with
in the large set itself.
Scene Shifting Facilitated
Long waits in changing scenes will
be obviated in this way, and it will be
possible to construct the large set on
a bigger scale. This first scene, laid
in the living room of Willie Smith,
the big toothpaste manufacturer, is
narried out in an "overdone Italian"
manner. As the character of the set
is esesntial to the characterization of
the play, the ambitious spirit of the
nouveau-riche hero will be followed
in the interpretation of the decora
tions of the room.
Series of Arches Used
A series of arches will help give the
effect of spaciousness and depth to
the room. The furniture used in this
scene will be placed and planned
carefully to add to the general tone.
The second set, a small bedroom
scene, will contrast the effect of the
first. Although the general tone of
ornateness will be followed, the
scene will be executed in as simple a
manner possible. The stage proper
ties used have also been planned care
fully to maintain the spirit of the
farce.
