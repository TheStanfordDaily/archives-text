## ‘COLORADO CANYON’ LECTURE TOPIC OF DR. DAVIS TONIGHT TALK IS NON-TECHNICAL Visiting Professor Will Tell of Geological Value of Enormous Chasm 
### 
"Lessons of the Colorado Canyon" will
j be discussed by Dr. William Morris Da
| vis, lecturer on physiography geology, and
I professor emeritus of Geology in Har
vard, in the Little Theatre at 7 :30 o'clock
tonight.
In a non-technical way the lecture will
show the value of the Grand Canyon as
a teacher of geological history with spe
jcial emphasis on the revelation it gives
of the endless continuity of geological
| time.
Dr. Davis says,"The visitor at first
is overwhelmed with the idea that so
enormous a canyon can be the work of
slowly acting processes; but before leav
ing the canyon he ought to learn that the
