### 
GENEVA, Dec. s.—Great Britain j
and Russia exchanged views on their
. diplomatic relations through their ac-j
i credited representatives today but

for agreement.
The conference between the suave !
Sir Austen Chamberlain, British For
eign Secretary, and the stocky Maxim '
Litvinoff, Soviet Assistant. Foreign '
Commissar who has dominated the
Geneva stage for a week, was the |

grand finale of a score of diplomatic [
meetings. It completely overshadowed j
the 48th session of the League of
Nations council which opened today.

ence, that Litvinoff had remained in
Geneva a day too long. He had cap
tured world interest with his com-;
plete disarmament program, his dec- i
laration that a bigger war was inevi- j
table, and his willingness to sign non
aggression compacts with all nations, !
but he was defeated at diplomacy by j
the astute and adroit Chamberlain. |
