# THREE OUTSIDE MEETS LISTED FOR TRACKMEN
## U.S.C., California Only Two Collegiate Opponents On Track Schedule FACE U.C. AT STANFORD Plan Four-Cornered Contest With L.A.A.C., Olympic Club, H.A.C. 
### 
Varsity track men will have only
three outside meets during the 1928
season, according to the track sched
ule announced yesterday by Dink
Templeton. These, with the interclass
competition, will he the only regular
contests of the year.
Only two intercollegiate meets are
included in the schedule, those with
U.S.C. and California. The U.S.C.
event, which will take place at Los
Angeles, will be held March 31. The
Big Meet is planned for April 21 at
Stanford. These are definitely sched
uled.
Plans are being laid for a four-cor
nered meet with the Olympic Club,
the Los Angeles Athletic Club, and
the Hollywood Athletic Club, to be
held on March 10 at Stanford, the
Cardinals not to compete against the
other three teams as a combined
squad, but each club to run up a
separate score.
Another change has been made in
that the interclass event and the
Irish Marathon will be run off the
same day, February 25. This will aid
in shortening the track season.
The reason given by Templeton for
not having more dual meets was that
they would make the season too long
and the track men would be too tired
for the Olympic tryouts next summer.
He pointed out that the club meets,
although providing strong competi
tion, are not of particular interest.
The four-cornered meet will provide
much' stronger competition, and will
give Stanford trackmen an opportun
ity to rest between contests.
