# The
						"Gentleman's Grade"

As the time for finals draws near it is only fitting that some observa
tion should be made of the popular belief that "the students who make
the highest grades are not so apt to win promotion and success in later
life as their wiser comrades who refuse to spend more time in study than
is necessary to make reasonably fair grades, and are thereby enabled to
participate more vigorously in the social and athletic activities of the
campus." The argument cited is listed as a popular fallacy in "Your Big
gest Job, School or Business," by Henry Louis Smith.
Smith goes on to point out that out of 7,979 graduates from Harvard,
ale, Princeton, Amherst, and Brown, 348 were differentiated from their
classmates by their very high grades. Of this select group 131 rated
space in "Who's Who," which lists only 1-55 of 1 per cent of the total
population of the United States. Mr. Smith's conclusion is worded thusly,
"The man who graduates with high scholastic honors, instead of being
unfitted for success by his extra 'booklearning' is about seven times as
likely to become a distinguished man as the 'all-round' men who received
diplomas with him."
Mr. Smith, it is seen, counts success achieved when one is mentioned
in \\ bo's \\ ho." 1 here are few who will argue with him on this score,
although it has been done and with some reason. However, Mr. Smith's
argument is of interest in another way, namely that of judicious choice
of rhetoric in speaking of mathematical findings.
He doesn't mention the fact that the use of his term "high grades"
implies relative standing with the other classmates. The 348 students
out of 7,979 constitute 4 per cent of the total, into which limited group
aspirants for "Who's Who" must fall (or rather "climb") before the laws
of chance swing their way 7 to 1 compared with the other 7,631 graduates.
Even after getting into this select group (the chances being 4 out of 100)
the student still has another mathematical barrier to hurdle and that is
that a little less than half of the selected group makes "Who's Who."
In conclusion, then, if you will get into this 4 per cent group (with
which future statisticians will calculate) you will possess a 20 to 1 better
chance than the average college student of becoming a "distinguished
man."
Mr. Smith's findings may be more satisfactorily summarized by the
statement that, judging from grades, it seems that the better the grades,
the more chance one has to become a "distinguished man." Educators,
then, have but to instill the urge in their students to become "distinguished
men" and afterwards point significantly to Mr. Smith's conclusion.
