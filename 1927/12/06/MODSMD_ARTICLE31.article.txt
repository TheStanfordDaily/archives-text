Published as it is in one of the intellectual centers of the nation—there
are those who say that that phrase is a synonym for "universities"—the
Stanford Daily during the past quarter has made an effort to supply
its readers with authoritative statements on matters of general interest
from those members of the faculty who are especially interested and
qualified to comment.

A list of the topics and the faculty to whom the Daily is
indebted shows the scope of the material covered during the past quarter.
College publications have one advantage over the metropolitan press,
namely that they are each in a position readily to secure authoritative
views from university professors.

G. Reid, of Aeronautics, on "Vertically Ascending Aero
planes"; W. L. Crum, Professor in the Graduate School of Business, on "Tax
"Reduction"; s. I). Townley, Seismologist and Professor in the Mathematics
Department, on "Earthquakes Near San Luis Obispo"; A. S. Niles, Professor
of Aeronautics, on "Government Aviation Expenditures"; L. M. Terman,
Professor of Psychology, on "Independent Study Plan"; W. J. Cook, Pro

Jordan on "Why War Should Be Abolished"; E. K. Strong, Professor of
Graduate School, on "Students and Jobs"; O. S. Johnson, Instructor of
Chinese Language, on "China's Need to Settle Her Own Problems"; P. A.
Martin, Professor of History, on "Mexican Election Troubles"; President Ray
Lyman Wilbur on "Lower Division Elimination."
Other items of general interest include A1 Masters' views on "How
Elimination of the Lower Division May Affect Stanford Athletics"; A. P.
Giannini President of Bancitaly, on "College Men in Banking"; Admiral
Thomas Washington on "Peace-Time Benefits of the Navy"; Babe Ruth on
"College Men in Professional Baseball"; Judge Ben Lindsey on "Freedom
of the Modern Youth"; Postmaster W. C. Werry on "Air Mail"; Mae Murray
on "My Career"; Taylor Holmes on "Art in the American Theatre"; and
