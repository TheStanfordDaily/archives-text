The Editor, Sir:
I take this means of taking exception
to a statement attributed to Gertrude Ath
erton, reputed internationally known au
thor, in an interview given the Daily and
published 011 page six, column one of last
Friday's Daily (December 3).
Before attempting to go further, how
ever, perhaps it would be better to agree
upon the meaning of certain terms in
question in order to avoid any misunder
standing. Let us take the word "gentle
man" and "proletariat." The word "gen
tleman" in its modern sense, signifies a
man of refined manners and fine feelings,
considerate, well-bred. This is, in sub
stance, the meaning given in Webster's
New International Dictionary, and I pre
sume that this authority is acceptable to
all of us.
The word "proletariat" has certain ob
solete and special applications, but, taking
again the authority mentioned aboe, its
modern sense denotes the wage-earning
class.
Being agreed as to what the terms in
question signify, let us proceed with the
statement in controversy. Speaking of
Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair, and Theo
dore Dreiser, (and I am not attempting to
defend them), she says in part, "Since
few of these realistic authors ever met
a gentleman, they can hardly portray one
. . . , they write always of the groups
they know most intimately, the prole
tariat."
Now, what I should like to know is
this: Is there a definite line of demarca
tion between a gentleman and a member
of the proletariat? Gertrude Atherton
certainly, to my mind, seems to think this
so, and it is upon this point that I take
exception to her. I contend that a person
may be a member of the proletariat group
and still be a gentleman. I consider my
self a member of the proletariat class—
and I am not ashamed of it either—and 1
also consider myself a gentleman. I chal
lenge anyone to draw the line between
gentleman and the proletariat. It seems
as foolish to say so as it is to say that
certain attributes, such as intelligence,
tastes, etc., are found in certain classes,
races, nations, etfc.
No doubt many will snicker at the idea
of a "nobody" taking exception to a na
tionally known author, but nevertheless
her statement got under my skin and at
least I'll feel at ease with myself for hav
ing expressed my view on the matter —
which after all is the essential thing.
Chalking one up for the common people,
I am,
Sincerely yours,

and still be a gentleman. I consider my
self a member of the proletariat class—
and I am not ashamed of it either—and 1
also consider myself a gentleman. I chal
lenge anyone to draw the line between
gentleman and the proletariat. It seems
as foolish to say so as it is to say that
certain attributes, such as intelligence,
tastes, etc., are found in certain classes,
races, nations, etfc.
No doubt many will snicker at the idea
of a "nobody" taking exception to a na
tionally known author, but nevertheless
her statement got under my skin and at
least I'll feel at ease with myself for hav
ing expressed my view on the matter —
which after all is the essential thing.

The Editor, Sir:
I take this means of taking exception
to a statement attributed to Gertrude Ath
erton, reputed internationally known au
thor, in an interview given the Daily and
published 011 page six, column one of last
Friday's Daily (December 3).
Before attempting to go further, how
ever, perhaps it would be better to agree
upon the meaning of certain terms in
question in order to avoid any misunder
standing. Let us take the word "gentle
man" and "proletariat." The word "gen
tleman" in its modern sense, signifies a
man of refined manners and fine feelings,
considerate, well-bred. This is, in sub
stance, the meaning given in Webster's
New International Dictionary, and I pre
sume that this authority is acceptable to
all of us.
The word "proletariat" has certain ob
solete and special applications, but, taking
again the authority mentioned aboe, its
modern sense denotes the wage-earning
class.
Being agreed as to what the terms in
question signify, let us proceed with the
statement in controversy. Speaking of
Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair, and Theo
dore Dreiser, (and I am not attempting to
defend them), she says in part, "Since
few of these realistic authors ever met
a gentleman, they can hardly portray one
. . . , they write always of the groups
they know most intimately, the prole
tariat."
Now, what I should like to know is
this: Is there a definite line of demarca
tion between a gentleman and a member
of the proletariat? Gertrude Atherton
certainly, to my mind, seems to think this
so, and it is upon this point that I take
exception to her. I contend that a person
may be a member of the proletariat group
and still be a gentleman. I consider my
self a member of the proletariat class—
and I am not ashamed of it either—and 1
also consider myself a gentleman. I chal
lenge anyone to draw the line between
gentleman and the proletariat. It seems
as foolish to say so as it is to say that
certain attributes, such as intelligence,
tastes, etc., are found in certain classes,
races, nations, etfc.
