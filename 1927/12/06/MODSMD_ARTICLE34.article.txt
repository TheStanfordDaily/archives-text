The Editor, Sir:
In regard to several of the services that
have been held in the Memorial Chapel
this quarter, the writer takes this oppor
tunity to express his opinion.
I always thought that the Memorial
chapel was non-sectarian and non-denom
inational in its character and services.
But it seems that on at least four occa
sions, when I have attended the chapel,
how many more I am not able to say,
there were very orthodox representatives
of the Episcopalian church.
The writer does not have any objec
tions to Episcopalian beliefs or bishops,
but the Anglican and English influence
is sufficient, to my mind, in the person of
the regular chaplain without bringing in
outsiders of the same denomination.
I do not believe that Chicago, Stanford
University, or the United States is going
to be captured by King George, but I
wonder if it would in any serious way
harm the morals or religious feelings of
Stanford students if some more represen
tative American Protestant could speak,
just once in a while.
Certainly such large denominations
as the Presbyterian, Congregationalists,
Methodist and Baptists have representa
tives among Stanford students that
should be recognized. So, the writer sug
gests very humbly if there might not pos
sibly be â€¢ some chance for a regular
Protestant minister to occupy the pulpit
in place of the he-skirted and backward-
CoH&red priests.
