COTILLION DITTIES
Plunk a tune
For Ike McGold,
At the Soph Cotillion
He passed out cold!
Self preservation's
A law of the race.
An import scratched
Our Johnny's face.
Here's to the girls,
Of dear old Mills.
They drink by pints,
And not by gills!

MY ROOMMATE SAID
A "Cit" prof asked my roommate
for a definition of Progress. My room
mate said, "Progress is when fewer
people die of more diseases less
often."

Archie Twilsbury read the Phi
Bete list and was filled with righteous
anger. Breaking down our locked door
with an axe, he placed this scorching
(for Archie) verse on the deftk. Mean
ing to pound the desk with his fist he
unfortunately chose the one that still
held the axe. The sharp blade cut the
poem in twain, buried itself in the
desk, the handle quivering. Archie
was so embarrassed at his mistake
that he dashed off to his room, sob
bing the while —-
"Phi Beta Kappa chose 13,
I looked there for my name.
Somehow they passed me up again.
Now that's a dirty shame!"

AN ENCINA MAN AT HOME
At dinner, in front, of his startled
relatives, he scooped off a half-dish
of potatoes and then said, "Hey,
there; save me some of that gravy,
I know it isn't worth a damn but I
gotta flavor these spuds.
"Crom," '31.

No, Oswald, in spite of the current
rumor, mint juleps were NOT served
on the porch of the "old Southern
Mansion" at the Cotillion. Why did
you think that automobiles were
parked so close to the Pavilion?

FER FAME AN' FORTUNE
I'm going to be a hero
When I grow up it's plain.
I'll shoot a fellow every day
Then prove that I'm insane.
I'll get my picture in the news
By robbin' a bank or two;
And if perhaps this doesn't work
Lucky Strikes, I'll depend on you!
"Crom," '31.

Martha Marshmallow, that tittering
"aht" major who speaks of Green
wich Village as Mecca, messed up a
trail to an ant hill with the following
surprising results —or is it surprising?
What blind fools
Are ants and men!
Erase the trail
Where once they trod —
Few then are they
Who can again
Take up their trail
Unfaltering.
