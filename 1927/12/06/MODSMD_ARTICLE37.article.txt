# STUDENTS RELIGIOUS, DECLARES DEAN OF VICTORIA CATHEDRAL
## Partial Inspiration Received From Sources Outside Christian Church 
### Sylva Weaver 
"Students are more religious than they
think," said the Very Reverend Cecil
Quaintain, Dean of the Cathedral in Vic
toria, British Columbia, in an interview
yesterday morning.
"Man is an incurably religious animal.
Students are not devoid of religion, but
they have a religious sense that is receiv
ing a partial inspiration from outside
sources. In the rush of university life the
religious element is sometimes crowded
out, but often the most skeptical of stu
dents is truly religious.
"The young people of today are puz
zled by the many divisions among the
Christian churches. There is a religious
reformation going on at the present time
which is not nearly as dramatic as the
Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth
century, but which will be widespread in
its effects. The divisions in Christianity
will remain for a long time yet, as one
cannot expect to remove distinctions and
differences which have existed for cen
turies in a day or a generation.
"The Lausanne Conference last year
was a milestone along the road of unity
for the Christian churches, and although
no direct practical steps were taken, it
resulted in a better understanding and a
better spirit among the churchmen of
many nations."
Returning to the question of religion
among students, Dean Quaintain said that
students are getting religion from beauty
and philosophy but that it is much better
to get it from the church. "Nothing can
compensate for the lack of common wor
ship in the church. Just as one gets tired
of living around in hotels and seeks a
permanent home, so one needs a spiritual
home, and the church is the only place
that satisfactorily fulfills the need."
Dean Quaintain is holding morning
chapel today and tomorrow of this week
at 7:50 o'clock in the Stanford Memorial
Church.
