# Deadline Set For Plot Summaries Of Junior Opera
## 
### 
Deadline for turning in Junior
Opera plot summaries lias been set
for January 9, the first Monday of
Winter Quarter, announces Hal
Boomer, chairman of the Junior Play
committee.
No dialogue is required with these
summaries, since their chief purpose
is to furnish the play committee with
details and information concerning
the type of material that is being
worked on for the final opera books.
The date of deadline for the com
pleted books will be announced later.
Prize Offered
The customary prize of fifty dollars
for the winning play will be offered
this year. Collaboration is encour
aged, according to Boomer. "Any kind
of plot, dealing with anything frpm a
mystery to a costume play, is ac
ceptable," he announced. "However, a
subject that lends itself to good com
edy and dialogue is preferred."
Since the discontinuance of the for
mer annual Ram's Head show, the
Junior Opera is the only opportunity
for student dramatists, authors, and
embryo playwrights to test their abil
ity. All students with literary ten
dencies are encouraged to work on
plot summaries. These manuscripts
should be sent to Hal Boomer, Alpha
Tau Omega, in duplicate, with the
name of the author on each sheet.
The play committee will follow a :
new method for consideration of com-1
peting manuscripts this year. The
plots will be discussed fully in com
mittee meetings, and will also be
considered separately by each mem-;
her of the committee. These first I
drafts will be considered with view of |
revision, and authors are urged not |
to hesitate to send in their plots |
which have not been fully worked
out.
Committee Will Co-operate
This method of consideration of
manuscript will prevent needless ex- j
penditure of time upon subject mat
ter that is impractical or inappropri- j
ate for the Opera. Every opportunity I
for co-operation with students submit-!
ting work is the aim of the commit-j
tee in charge this year.
Announcements concerning submis
sion of musical scores will be made
later in the quarter. Other members
of the play committee are Charles
Moore, Kenneth Lloyd, Kathleen
Fitz, and Chesterlyn Thomas. Manu
scripts may be given to any of these
members before January ninth.

Junior Opera is the only opportunity
for student dramatists, authors, and
embryo playwrights to test their abil
ity. All students with literary ten
dencies are encouraged to work on
plot summaries. These manuscripts
should be sent to Hal Boomer, Alpha
Tau Omega, in duplicate, with the
name of the author on each sheet.
The play committee will follow a :
new method for consideration of com-1
peting manuscripts this year. The
plots will be discussed fully in com
mittee meetings, and will also be
considered separately by each mem-;
her of the committee. These first I
drafts will be considered with view of |
revision, and authors are urged not |
to hesitate to send in their plots |
which have not been fully worked
out.
Committee Will Co-operate
This method of consideration of
manuscript will prevent needless ex- j
penditure of time upon subject mat
ter that is impractical or inappropri- j
ate for the Opera. Every opportunity I
for co-operation with students submit-!
ting work is the aim of the commit-j
tee in charge this year.
Announcements concerning submis
sion of musical scores will be made
later in the quarter. Other members
of the play committee are Charles
Moore, Kenneth Lloyd, Kathleen
Fitz, and Chesterlyn Thomas. Manu
scripts may be given to any of these
members before January ninth.
