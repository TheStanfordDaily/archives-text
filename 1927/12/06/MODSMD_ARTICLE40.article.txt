# CONGRESS ORGANIZES; MEMBERSHIP QUESTION OCCUPIES LIMELIGHT
## Leaders Attempt to Keep Machinery Running Minus Friction 
### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—The new
Congress organized for business to
day in an atmosphere of tense excite
ment over the question of barring
newly elected members.
Aftr hearing the President's annual
message tomorrow, the Senate will
consider whether it will seat Senators-
Elect Smith of Illinois and Vare of
Pennsylvania, who agreed to stand
aside today and permit routine for
malities incident to the opening of
Congress to go on without pressing
their claims for admitance.
In the House Nicholas Longworth
of Ohio was re-elected speaker.
Leaders Seek to Soothe
Although there was a sharp air of
political tension about the Capitol as
members gathered, it was apparent
that Republican leaders on both sides
were seeking to smooth feelings and
keep affairs on an even keel. This was
demonstrated In the Senate hy the
successful efforts of Senator Curtis,
majority leader, in persuading Smith
and Vare to stand aside while the
Senate perfected its organization, and
in obtaining the unanimous consent
of all Senators to this program. On
the House side this was evidenced in
the fact that the Wisconsin insurgents
were persuaded for the first time in
years to vote for the regular Repub
lican candidate for speaker, and in
Longworth's address naming the Pro
gressive leaders and complimenting
them in highest terms.
Galleries Are Packed
Galleries of both Houses were
jammed, society leaders of Washing
ton eagerly accepting a chance to sit
on the gallery steps in order to see
Washington's big annual show. For
mer Senators and Congressmen
swarmed in on the floor, shaking
hands with their old colleagues and
doubtless thinking back on their own
former days of glory.
