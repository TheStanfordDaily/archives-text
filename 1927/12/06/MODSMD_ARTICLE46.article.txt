# CORPORATIONS WANT BRIGHT YOUNG MEN IN INDUSTRY-OLDER
## Colleges Can Develop Man, Can't Make Him Over, Says "Call" Editor 
### Gunnar Norberg 
"There has never been such a striving
after talent as there is now. In industry,
corporations of all kinds are looking for
bright young men," said h remont Older,
president and editor of the San I'rancisco
| Call.
However, lie had been asked his opin
ion of the chances that a college man
might have in journalism, in the news
paper game, if lie should choose that as
the career in which he would anticipate
spending the greater part of his time be
tween graduation from an institution of
the "higher learning" and that more re
mote instant, the one of his demise.
"The question, then, is simply this:
how much of this 'talent' is coming out
of the colleges; how many bright young
men issue forth 'from the universities?
What has been your experience?" lie was
asked.
"The fellow who comes out of the uni
versity will do splendidly, if he has it in
him. Colleges can develop what's in him,
but they can't make him over. They can't
take the dullness out of him, nor can they
do much with his inhibitions.
"For the capable man, there has never
been so many opportunities as at present."
Mr. Older referred specifically to Stan
ford men.
i"I have known a good many fellows
out of Stanford who have succeeded in
'journalism. For instance, Robert Dutlus,i
I Bruce Blevin, the Irwin boys, and many J
j others could be named in the list."
"What sort of college course do you
think a prospective journalist ought to
| take ?
"I don't feel inclined to speak of what
the content of the college curriculum of
la future newspaper man should or should
not be, but I think that most of the col
lege graduates in journalism whom I
know have specialized in English; they
have kept in touch with literature.
"Marshall, come here. What courses
have our college men taken while they
were at Stanford and the University of
California?"
'Oh, I don't know exactly," answered
j Marshal.
"Well, what did you study?" Mr. Older
I was a little impatient, either with Mar
; shall or with the inquisitiveness of the
DAILY'S reporter.
"Oh, English, philosophy, history: a
! lot of things." Marshall knew in a gen
jeral way what he had studied.
! It might be rational to infer that in
i Mr. Older's opinion, as in the case of
j other men "who have arrived," it is not
' what courses an individual has taken
while he was yet an undergraduate, but
the way he applies himself in the work
he chooses as his life work that deter-
I mines his ultimate success or failure.
