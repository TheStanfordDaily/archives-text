### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
There were tw r o games in the recent
football season that were as alike as
two peas, as far as the closing mo
ments w r ent, and, in case that the
interesting similarity has gone un
noticed, please let me retell what hap
pened. One of the games was played
in the stadium at Palo Alto on Octo
ber 15, between Stanford University
and the University of Southern Cali
fornia, and the other at Cartier Field,
South Bend, Ind., on November 5, be
tween Notre Dame and Minnesota.
The fact that both games ended in
tie scores is nothing unusual, but
when you discover that in each con
test the tie was brought about in the
final minute of play by a successful
pass thrown by a big fullback who
was noted for his ability to plow
through the line like a dreadnaught,
why it begins to look like a coinci

| dence. And when you note that both
!of these giant line-crushers who
saved their team from defeat with a
few seconds to go are named Herb,
why the thing begins to get serious!
Herb Joesting, the famous batter
ing-ram of Minnesota, is well known
| to every football fan. Herb Fleish
hacker, who understudies "Biff" Hoff
man as fullback at Stanford, is not so
well known, but may be before next
season is over. Anyway, both Herbs
hit the line with tremendous force,
and Fleishhacker, though not as fast
as Joesting, weighs close to 215
pounds and is just as deadly as a
touchdown threat, when a few yards
! are needed and the regulars on both
sides are tiring, as the famous Min
nesota Nordic.
In the Stanford-U.S.C. game, Pop
j Warner stuck in his Herb with only

a couple of minutes to play. The big
fellow rammed his way through the
line on seven consecutive plays and
then caught the Trojans completely
by surprise by throwing a little south
paw pass to Vincenti, the end, who
scored the tying points. In the Minne
sota-Notre Dame game, the Gophers
got the ball on a last-minute fumble
by the Irish, and Joesting shot a pass
to Walsh, who caught it just over the
goal line for a touchdown.

South Bend, Ind., on November 5, be
tween Notre Dame and Minnesota.
The fact that both games ended in
tie scores is nothing unusual, but
when you discover that in each con
test the tie was brought about in the
final minute of play by a successful
pass thrown by a big fullback who
was noted for his ability to plow
through the line like a dreadnaught,
why it begins to look like a coinci

| dence. And when you note that both
!of these giant line-crushers who
saved their team from defeat with a
few seconds to go are named Herb,
why the thing begins to get serious!
Herb Joesting, the famous batter
ing-ram of Minnesota, is well known
| to every football fan. Herb Fleish
hacker, who understudies "Biff" Hoff
man as fullback at Stanford, is not so
well known, but may be before next
season is over. Anyway, both Herbs
hit the line with tremendous force,
and Fleishhacker, though not as fast
as Joesting, weighs close to 215
pounds and is just as deadly as a
touchdown threat, when a few yards
! are needed and the regulars on both
sides are tiring, as the famous Min
nesota Nordic.
In the Stanford-U.S.C. game, Pop
j Warner stuck in his Herb with only

a couple of minutes to play. The big
fellow rammed his way through the
line on seven consecutive plays and
then caught the Trojans completely
by surprise by throwing a little south
paw pass to Vincenti, the end, who
scored the tying points. In the Minne
sota-Notre Dame game, the Gophers
got the ball on a last-minute fumble
by the Irish, and Joesting shot a pass
to Walsh, who caught it just over the
goal line for a touchdown.
