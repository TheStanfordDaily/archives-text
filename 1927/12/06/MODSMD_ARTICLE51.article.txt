# VARSITY FIVE MEETS "GOLDS" SATURDAY IN SEASON'S FIRST TILT
## Hunt Stresses Passing Work, Basket-Shooting During Week's Practice 
### Merle Emry 
Believe it or not, Stanford's first
basketball game of the season will be
Saturday night against the San Jose
Golds at San Jose, according to Coach
Husky Hunt, the Board of Athletic
Control, and the Faculty Athletic
Committee.
Ever since the practice scrimmage
with the Teachers College team a lit
tle over a week ago, Hunt has been
stressing work 011 passing and bas
ket-shooting in his afternoon
with the varsity. Since October 1,
when they started practice, the play
ers had been taught to pass, but
against the Spartans they were care
less and often gave the ball to a San
Jose man. The other cardinal error
was poor basket-shooting.
Passing Practiced
This week Husky is trying to instill
the principles of good passing into his
men so that they will act a little dif
ferent under fire. Three methods were
used in yesterday's workout.
Different combinations of players
were sent through a five-man defense,
the system of goal guarding that
practically all Pacific Coast schools
use. Each man had to be accurate or
another one was substituted, and
there was much substituting. The old
game of "keep-away" was started be
tween two different teams and much
competition was shown during the
elimination of squads that could not
bang on to the ball. Lastly, there was
straight man-to-man passing, which
should make excellent "daily dozens"
to try in the morning before a final.
Shooting Inaccurate
The Cardinals are still weak on hit
ting the basket from the floor. Follow
up shots have been -the easiest for
last year's freshmen to make. Stew
art, Hare, and Simkins show more
ability in this line than the older
varsity men.
Berg, Cook, and Bowers were the
only men that were able to find the
basket from field shots yesterday
afternoon. It is not that Stanford is
lacking opportunity to try for basket
shots as was shown in the San Jose
practice and scrimmage since then,
but that the players are unable to get
their sights adjusted and find the net.
Their offense is strong but their
shooting is poor. If two or three ex
perts could be developed along this
line of shooting before the conference
games start it is predicted that Stan
ford would have a much better chance
to come out at the head.

basketball game of the season will be
Saturday night against the San Jose
Golds at San Jose, according to Coach
Husky Hunt, the Board of Athletic
Control, and the Faculty Athletic
Committee.
Ever since the practice scrimmage
with the Teachers College team a lit
tle over a week ago, Hunt has been
stressing work 011 passing and bas
ket-shooting in his afternoon
with the varsity. Since October 1,
when they started practice, the play
ers had been taught to pass, but
against the Spartans they were care
less and often gave the ball to a San
Jose man. The other cardinal error
was poor basket-shooting.
Passing Practiced
This week Husky is trying to instill
the principles of good passing into his
men so that they will act a little dif
ferent under fire. Three methods were
used in yesterday's workout.
Different combinations of players
were sent through a five-man defense,
the system of goal guarding that
practically all Pacific Coast schools
use. Each man had to be accurate or
another one was substituted, and
there was much substituting. The old
game of "keep-away" was started be
tween two different teams and much
competition was shown during the
elimination of squads that could not
bang on to the ball. Lastly, there was
straight man-to-man passing, which
should make excellent "daily dozens"
to try in the morning before a final.
Shooting Inaccurate
The Cardinals are still weak on hit
ting the basket from the floor. Follow
up shots have been -the easiest for
last year's freshmen to make. Stew
art, Hare, and Simkins show more
ability in this line than the older
varsity men.
Berg, Cook, and Bowers were the
only men that were able to find the
basket from field shots yesterday
afternoon. It is not that Stanford is
lacking opportunity to try for basket
shots as was shown in the San Jose
practice and scrimmage since then,
but that the players are unable to get
their sights adjusted and find the net.
Their offense is strong but their
shooting is poor. If two or three ex
perts could be developed along this
line of shooting before the conference
games start it is predicted that Stan
ford would have a much better chance
to come out at the head.
