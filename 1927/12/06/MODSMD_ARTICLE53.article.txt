# SUCCESSFUL SEASON FORECAST FOR BABE BASKETBALL QUINTET
## Mears, Loomis Showing Up Well at Center; Many Out for Forward 
### 
Hopes for a highly successful freshman
basketball season are increasing daily as
more and more teamwork and individual
ability is being displayed by the members
of the squad, despite the fact that sev
eral of the most promising were on the
yearling football team and have not yet
had time to reach their top form.
Assistant Coach "Muggs" Mitchell is
very enthusiastic over the team's chances,
and states that the 1931 material is the
best he has seen in several years. Up to
this time the babes have played two in
tcrclass games and have held one scrim
mage with the varsity, in each of which
they have exhibited a fast, smooth brand
of basketball.
James Mears has been showing up well
at center, but will have to do plenty of
improving if he does not wish to share
his position with Loomis, a smaller but
steady player. The forward berths are
being hotly contested between several
candidates, each of whom plays a fast,
heady game. Probably the two outstand
ing of these are Hawkins and Fawcett,
closely followed by Freeman, Cook and
Jouj on-Roche. Tampcke and Reynolds
have the guard positions pretty well to
themselves; although Roberts and East
man are two other candidates that have
played well in the practice scrimmages.
Mears and Fawcett, as center and for
ward respectively 011 the Hollywood Ath
letic Club team, played in the A.A.U.
last season; while Tampcke was a mem
ber of the Galileo High School team
which defeated the freshman here last
year.
Most of the practice sessions to date
have been devoted to the building up of a
strong defense, but at the end of the
quarter the coaches plan to cut the squad
to about twenty men, which will enable
them to spend more time on the working
out of offensive plays, and individual in
struction.
