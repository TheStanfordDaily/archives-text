Roughs should be treated as such, is
the opinion of the Men's Glee Club, which
will sponsor the Winter Registration
dance on January 6.
Parties of one will not be admitted to
the floor of the Women's Clubhouse
where the dance is to be held, according
to Thomas Peterson, chairman of the glee
club committee arranging for the affair,
but will be obliged to climb to the win
dows and sit on the sills thereof in order
to see the dance.
"Roughs have usurped all of the seats
and most of the floor space at recent
clubhouse dances," Peterson declares," so
at the Registration dance the tradition of
keeping them in the background will be
revived."
Brooks - Worthington orchestra will
provide music for the hop, admission to
which will be $1.00.
