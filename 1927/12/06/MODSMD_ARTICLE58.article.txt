j home Thursday night, was large
ly due to the efforts of the Stanford
Y.M.C.A., according to Lawrence F.
Schmitt, Director of New Student
Activities of the local "Y."
I "It has been felt for some time that
' the new students, and especially the
j transfers who are mostly upper divi
j sion men, and who are supposed to
I be the campus leaders, should know
more about the story of the TJniver-
