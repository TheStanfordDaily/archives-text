# WARNER, PUPIL WILL MEET IN FIFTH CONTEST
## Honors Even Between Pop, Sutherland With Two Victories Each ODDS FAVOR PANTHERS Pittsburgh Has Strong Line; Welsh, Booth Star in Backfield Play 
### 
By Milton Silverman
Four times have Pop Warner and
Jock Sutherland sent their teams
against each other. Twice the old
master has taken the honors and j
twice they have gone to his young j
disciple. But consistently Warner's !
Pittsburgh elevens and Sutherland's
West Virginia Mountaineers have
been the class of the East.
Now the two meet once more and,
barring a tie, will settle once for all
the question of supremacy. Suther- j
land is favored to win.
Welch All-American
Only Cibby Welch, halfback extra
ordinary, is given outright All-Ameri- ;
can honors, but three others are !
awarded high places or honorable
mention for the team. Leading the
list is Donchess, ranked fourth among
the ends, and bowing only to Ooster- !
baan, Nash, and Born.

It was line play that featured the
"victories of the Panthers during the :
1927 season. Roberts has been named j
not only the biggest guard on the j
team, but one of the best linemen i
since the days of Thornhill. Roberts
and Post, rated nearly on a par, will !
have an opportunity to stage a battle ]
de luxe at Pasadena.
Backfield Powerful
Pittsburgh's real strength becomes
overwhelming in the backfield; with !
AVelch and Booth carrying the ball be- ■
bind a powerful line, the chances of
the Panthers seem to crush those of
Stanford.
Captain Welch has been a star for \
Ihree seasons. This year a wet, slip-!
pery field checked him against Wash- |
ington and Jefferson, but under nor
mal conditions* he stands out among I
tlie elect of America.
Termed the Morley Drury of the j
East, he has ranked high throughout j
his playing career, but not till this,
his last year, did he qualify for the j
mythical All-American team. But he ;
qualified so decidedly that there is j
scarcely an all-star team in the coun- 112
try that does not contain his name.
Booth, Pitt fullback, finished thej
regular season by running riot j
through the strong Penn State outfit, j
His ability on power plays makes him
almost as formidable as Bifl' Hoffman, !
but he will have to give a most un- j
usual exhibition to outplay the Stan-1
ford star.

By Milton Silverman
Four times have Pop Warner and
Jock Sutherland sent their teams
against each other. Twice the old
master has taken the honors and j
twice they have gone to his young j
disciple. But consistently Warner's !
Pittsburgh elevens and Sutherland's
West Virginia Mountaineers have
been the class of the East.
Now the two meet once more and,
barring a tie, will settle once for all
the question of supremacy. Suther- j
land is favored to win.
Welch All-American
Only Cibby Welch, halfback extra
ordinary, is given outright All-Ameri- ;
can honors, but three others are !
awarded high places or honorable
mention for the team. Leading the
list is Donchess, ranked fourth among
the ends, and bowing only to Ooster- !
baan, Nash, and Born.

It was line play that featured the
"victories of the Panthers during the :
1927 season. Roberts has been named j
not only the biggest guard on the j
team, but one of the best linemen i
since the days of Thornhill. Roberts
and Post, rated nearly on a par, will !
have an opportunity to stage a battle ]
de luxe at Pasadena.
Backfield Powerful
Pittsburgh's real strength becomes
overwhelming in the backfield; with !
AVelch and Booth carrying the ball be- ■
bind a powerful line, the chances of
the Panthers seem to crush those of
Stanford.
Captain Welch has been a star for \
Ihree seasons. This year a wet, slip-!
pery field checked him against Wash- |
ington and Jefferson, but under nor
mal conditions* he stands out among I
tlie elect of America.
