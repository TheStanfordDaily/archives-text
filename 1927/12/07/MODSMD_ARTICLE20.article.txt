WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. â€”Legisla-
tion for farm relief and flood control,
and to increase U.S. Naval strength
was recommended today by President
Coolidge in his message to the Seven
tieth Congress.
Creation of a Federal board or com
mission, operating with a revolving
fund financed at first by the govern
ment and probably later by private
banks, to help with marketing and to
encourage the co-operative movement
was the plan set forth for farm re
lief.
States Should Help Flood Control
Flood control legislation should be
confined mainly to the Lower Missis
| sippi river, and part of any cost in
curred should be borne by persons
immediately benefitted, the message
said. The national government, he
made clear, could not stand the entire
cost. Raising and strengthening dikes,
and building spillways were favored.
The president advised a consider-
J able building program for naval de
| fense including aircraft, submarines,
I and more cruisers. He said success or
I failure of any foreign armament con
; ference does not affect this program.
More Government Economy
I Through the message, Mr. Coolidge
! stressed the need for continued gov
ernmental economy, remindfng Con
gress that the national debt is still
about $26,G00,000,000', and that the
country's obligation to war veterans
and their dependents is large.
"It is gratifying to report," said the
! message, "that for the fourth consecu
i tive year the state of the union in
| general is good. We are at peace. The
| country as a whole has a prosperity
inever exceeded."
