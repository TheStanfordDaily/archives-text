# EX COMMITTEE PLANS TO SEND DELEGATE EAST
## Van Amringe to Represent A.S.S.U. at Federation Convention REVERSE FORMER STAND Eleanor Davidson Chosen as Delegate of A.W.S. to Student Meeting 
### 
Reconsidering its decision of last
week, the Ex Committee voted yes
terday to send an official Stanford
delegate to the National Student Fed
eration of America convention at Lin
coln, Nebraska, December 15, 16, and
17. John Van Amringe, vice-president
of the A.S.S.U., was chosen for the
representative, as Murray Draper,
student body president, will be un
able to attend because of the conflict
with finals week.
With Eleanor Davidson, president
of the A.W.S., already chosen as a
delegate by the A.W.S., Stanford will
have two representatives at Lincoln.
Causes of the reversal of its stand
by the Ex Committee were, first, an
explanation of the question to be con
sidered at the convention,"The Part
of the Student in the Community,"
that put it in a more desirable light,
and second, a more definite statement
by Stanley Weigel, last year's dele
gate, of what he brought back from
last year's meeting, and of what he
believed could be gained by participa
tion this year. Provision for the ex
penses of a delegate had already
been made on the budget.
The National Student Federation
was declared by Weigel to be the
only college association in the United
States which is truly national in
scope. It was organized in 1925, in
the interest of furthering world peace
through a student movement, and
considered the World Court at its
first annual meeting. Last year its
purpose was altered to allow discus
sion of more national problems, and
prohibition was the subject. Stanford
was represented both years.
