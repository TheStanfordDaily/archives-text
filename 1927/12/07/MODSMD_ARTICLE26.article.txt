# The 						Path of Duty

Too much confusion is resulting from the conflicting views on
what are actually the rules for traffic regulation and speeding 011 the
campus. The Councils, granted the power to try all student offenders,
have thus far taken no official action to clear up the situation. Since
student control of the automobile problem rests in their hands it is
obviously the duty of these organizations to state clearly what are
the speed laws for the Stanford campus.
The Daily has made every possible effort to determine the laws
governing the situation and the best results obtainable are hopelessly
scrambled by conflicting views of various authorities. According to
traffic officers, no instructions have been received by them to report
student offenders to the Councils. In the present difficulties no official
action has been taken by the Men's Council.
So far as is ascertainable now, the Councils will "enforce the
state law." They have, however, taken 110 official step to clarify for
the students exactly what constitutes that law. The duty before the
Councils seems to us as being quite clear.
