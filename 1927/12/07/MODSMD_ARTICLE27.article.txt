# Conceived in Error

### 
The Mountain View decision as to the speed limit on the campus is
considered by practically everyone locally as an error. Basing - their
action probably on information of Judge Maxwell's decision, San Jose
officials have instructed campus cops to hold campus traffic to 20 miles
per hour. This step, so far as can he determined, was taken despite the
fact that Maxwell's decision was based on a law requiring a speed of
15 miles per hour for "business districts" which he held the campus to be.
Discounting* a possible 10-mile leeway generally allowed in such cases,
30 miles per hour is the top-notch speed for Palm Drive. This excludes,
of course, all regulations for intersections and passing.
Further complications are added by others' interpretations. For
example, Comptroller Roth believes that the Mountain View decision
"rests upon a clear misapprehension" and that the campus highways
come under the State Highway Act within the special provision includ
ing "universities." This means that the top speed for Palm Drive may
be considered as 40 miles per hour with certain exceptions with a 15-mile
limit for intersections and 20 miles for residence sections.
This, then, constitutes the muddle into which the campus automobile
situation has been thrown. Not even the Men's Council can get the
campus out of this tangle; it remains for a reversal of Judge Maxwell's
decision and action from San Jose in accordance with the reversal.
