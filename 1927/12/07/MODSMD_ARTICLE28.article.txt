# "Negligibles"

Adverse criticism of the educational methods which prevail in
American colleges and universities has rained hot and heavy for the
past several years, but it has had to do almost exclusively with the
handling of the undergraduate. We had always supposed that graduate
students were a higher order of beings, scholars intent on the pursuit
of learning, and, as such, above suspicion. Now along comes Dean
Woodbridge of Columbia with the statement that between two-thirds
and three-quarters of the graduate students of Columbia University are
rated as "negligibles" so far as scholarship is concerned.
From the graduate students arc recruited the teachers who must fill
the increased demand resulting from the spread of education. It is,
therefore, of the highest importance that the graduate schools turn out
scholars capable of educating the youth of tlie country and extending
the boundaries of human knowledge. Dean Woodbridge finds that "our
graduate schools have become something like super-colleges, places in
which students resort to continue or supplement their education. Dis
interested learning, strictly professional interest, or clear utilitarian
advantage are not the basal motives which actuate the majority of
graduate students. It is something more subtle, something like the belief
that more education will do something for them personally, make them
happier or socially more prominent."
So many graduate students are not scholars at all, but seekers after
social prominence! If Dean Woodbridge is right, another of our ideals
is sadly shattered. â€”The Cornell Daily Sun.
