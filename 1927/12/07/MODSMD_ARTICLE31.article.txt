a lie Editor, Sir:
I am always delighted when stu
dents manifest intelligent interest in
the Memorial Church. Mr. Neal is
quite right in expressing his opinion.
But he must be patient. He writes
about one term. The non-sectarian
character of the Church, as expressed
in the variety of its preaching, must
not be judged by short periods. The
President's Reports include the names
and denominations of special preach
ers for the last ten years. Why not
look these over?
The preaching appointments for
the current academic year are al
ready made, and Mr. Neal will find
comfort if lie attends church regu
larly. He will hear a Russian Ortho
dox Bishop January 8; Dr. McCall
(Congregationalist), January 15; Rev.
Lloyd Douglass (Congregationalist),
January 29; Dr. Soares (Baptist),
February 5; Dr. Guthrie (Presbyte
rian), February 19; Dr. Duton (Uni
tarian), March 4; Rev. Lynn White
(Presbyterian), March 11; a Metho
dist Bishop, April 22 and 29; Dr. Pat
ton of Chicago (Congregationalist),
May 13 and 20; Dr. Sibley (Presby
terian), May 27; Dr. Selater (Presby
terian), June 10 and 17; Dr. Hunter
(Presbyterian), June 24; Dr. Patton
(Congregationalist), three Sundays in
July; Dr. McCartney (Presbyterian),
July 29; Dr. Gilkey of Chicago (Bap
tist), three Sundays in August.
The presence of three Episcopalians
this term is coincidence, not design,
and considering the fact that we have
over four hundred Episcopalian stu
dents, I do not feel that the propor
tion —looking over the whole year—is
extravagant. But our Episcopalian
visitors do not wear skirts —the Vest
ments worn are Cassock and Surplice.
Why? Perhaps because the Psalmist
says:"The Lord delighteth not in any
man's legs." I myself do not care 'to
criticize the clothes our guests wear.
True, the "dog collar" is a bit odd,
but it is part of a uniform and not
intended to frighten the children.
Yours faithfully,
DR. CHARLES GARDNER,
Chaplain.
