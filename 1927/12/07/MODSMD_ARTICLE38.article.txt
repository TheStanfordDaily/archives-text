### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.—(P.1.P.)—
Findings by Dr. Grace Fernald, Asso
ciate Professor of Psychology at
U.C.L.A., and Dr. Helen Keller, in the
problem of "word blindness" will be
published in book form soon. "Word
blindness" is a strange mental com
plex which makes it impossible for
the victim to recognize or learn the
printed word.
Supposedly abnormal children have
been the subjects of the labors and
struggles of Dr. Fernald and Dr. Kel
ler for ten years. Countless tests have
been taken this ten-year period.
