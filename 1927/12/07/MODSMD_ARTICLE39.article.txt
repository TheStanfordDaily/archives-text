# Women Lose Places Unless They Register January 3
## 
### 
Women students are reminded that
they must register on registration
day or forfeit their places in the Uni
versity, announced Dean Yost. In
case they are delayed at home or on
the way, they must phone or wire
their excuses to the registrar not
later than January 3. This rule has
been in effect each quarter and has
no connection with the Pasadena
game.
