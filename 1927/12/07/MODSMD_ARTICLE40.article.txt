Describing in a non-technical way the
formation and geographical history of the j
earth's surface, Dr. William Morris Da- 1
vis, physiographic geologist, and profes- [
sor emeritus of Geology at Harvard, lec-;
turcd last night in the Little Theatre on I
the "Lessons of the Colorado Canyon."
Using the Colorado Canyon to ilhjs- j
trate a cross-section view of the earth's I
surface, Dr. Davis said, "It is enormous-1
ly beyond expectation and far beyond de- j
scription, and was formed by hundreds i
of thousands of year's erosion. This
process will undoubtedly continue until
the canyon is more than fifty miles wide
instead of eight or ten miles wide, as it
is now. Hence, we should not speak of
the Canyon as an accomplishment, hut
only as the first step toward an accom
plishment."
