# VARSITY CAGERS WIN FROM 1931 TEAM IN CLOSE PRACTICE TILT
## Reynolds, Tampcke Show Up Winners' Scoring Power In 19 to 15 Game 
### Merle Emry 
Stanford's varsity basketball team
scrimmaged against a bigger, and al
most better, freshman squad yester
day afternoon and was lucky to leave
the workout with a 1!) to 15 victory.
This might indicate one of two
things: either the freshmen have a
powerful team, or the varsity had an
off day. But when the freshmen have
one of the strongest teams entering
Stanford for some time, and the var
sity play 3 poor ball in addition, the
result never looks so good for the
latter.
Reynolds and Tampcke, 1931
guards, were the thorns in the way
of the varsity scoring machine. They
nabbed the ball while the first-string
men hesitated, and had an easy time
in getting it off the backboard when
their opponents forgot to follow-up.
Joujon-Roche, freshman forward,
played a deceptive game, making eight
points for the underclassmen.
As soon as Reynolds and Tampcke
were taken out and Roberts and East
man substituted for 1931, Hunt's var
sity started to make up a ten-point
lead. Olsen made one tally for the
varsity and then another combination
was sent in to take the place of Berg
and Olsen, forwards, Clark, center,
and Simkins and Rothert, guards.
Cook and Stewart, forwards, Mc-
Candless, center, and Dobson and
Biaggini, guards, saved the reputa
tion for the first-string men by estab
lishing a two-point lead. Dobson
showed true varsity form and counted
for three baskets. Bowers, forward,
and Elliot, center, went in later and
raised the score to 19 where it stood
at the end of the workout.
Hunt's men passed better than they
have been doing but threw away the
ball fifteen different times, half of
which were bad passes and the other
half of which the babes took away
from them. In addition the upperclass
men had more opportunities to score
than the yearlings, but failed to make
the majority of their shots count. The
freshmen were accurate and passed
up but few chances to sink the ball.
