# CARDINAL TRIO WILL PLAY ENTRE-ACT FOR "EXPRESSING WILLIE"
## 
### 
One of the features of the perform
ance of "Expressing Willie," the
sophomore farce, to be given Satur
day night, will be the incidental music
by the Cardinal Trio. This will be
the first play of the year for which
entre-act music has been arranged
by Dramatic Council.
The Cardinal trio is a student trio,
and has played for other campus oc
casions during the past year, but this
will bo their first appearance in con
nection with a dramatic production.
Frances Sanford, musical director of
the Dance Drama last year, is the
pianist; Elwyn Bugge, violinist; and
Frank Cople, cellist. Selections from
the "Mikado" and "Bohemian Girl"
will be part of their program.
"Expressing Willie" is to be the
last dramatic production of the year,
and the last campus event of any
magnitude. Work on the play itself
has almost neared completion, and
although the change of cast at the
beginning of the week made extra
difficulties owing to the pressure of
time on the new members, there is
little work left to be done.
Since the action of the play, and
comedy opportunities, are equally di
vided among the major roles of the
play, there will be no one particularly
starring part. The cast includes some
excellent parts for characterization.
"Expressing Willie" is in the true
sense a farce, however, and not a bur
lesque.
