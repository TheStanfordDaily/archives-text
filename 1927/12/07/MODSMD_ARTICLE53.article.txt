# STOREY STOPS RUMOR OF WEIGHT ATHLETICS
## 
### 
Rumors that weight basketball
would be reinstituted in the Univer
sity this year were quieted by state
ments made last night by Dr. Thomas
Storey, director of physical education,
and Charles Davis, director of intra
mural athletics, in which it was made
clear that until a convenient time for
holding practice has been found, no
weight athletics will be undertaken.
