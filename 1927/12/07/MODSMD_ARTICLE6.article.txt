# POP WARNER, OWENS, MASTERS, LEAVE FOR CONFERENCE MEETING
## 
### 
Alfred R. Masters, General Manager
of the Board of Athletic Control, Wil
liam B. Owens, faculty representative,
and Glenn S. Warner, director of foot
ball, left yesterday for Portland, Ore
gon, where they will attend a meet
ing of the Pacific Coast Conference,
to be held there today, tomorrow, and j
Friday. They are expected to return .
to the campus Monday.
Among the problems to be settled
is the arranging of the football sched- j
ule for 1928. There will be some |
change, due to the fact that U.C.L.A. i
Will enter the Conference January 1.
The Shrine committee will probably
appear to make an appeal which, if
it goes through, will make more men
eligible to appear in the annual East-'
West classic played at Kezar Stadium \
during the Christmas holidays. The
present ruling prohibits men from
playing who have not completed their
football careers.
