# DOLE FLYER SAYS AVIATOR NEEDS COLLEGE EDUCATION
## 
### Robert Speers 
"A college education is absolutely
essential for a successful flyer," be
lieves Lieutenant Norman A. Goddard,
Dole flight pilot, who was 011 the !
campus yesterday.
"The industry is crying aloud for j
experienced men," he said, and point- i
ed out that college graduates can 1
learn to fly more quickly than the j
average candidate. Flying is scien-1
tific and education helps, he declared.
Trained Men Desired
111 speaking of openings for univer
sity-trained men in the field of avia
tion, Lieutenant Goddard showed that
engineers, draftsmen, and salesmen j
are only a few of the professions I
which can find a place in the industry.
"It takes twelve men on the ground
to keep one ship in the air."
Ocean Hops to Be Facts
Transatlantic flights will become a
practical fact within the next two or
three years, according to Lieutenant
Goddard. And the menace of enemy
planes in time of war has not been
over-empliasized, he says.
By citing some of his actual ex-!
periences he demonstrated that pres- j
ent anti-aircraft defense is not ef- j
fective. Every living thing in San j
Francisco could be put out of ex- j
istence by airplanes flying so high !
over the city that they would be out <
of reach of defense guns and even !
out of sight of land observers.
U.S. Behind in Aviation
The United States is just as far
behind the world in avitation as agi
tators believe, he said. There are less
than 1000 trained pilots in the coun
try today.
Lieutenant Goddard is a graduate
of the Dartmouth Naval College, Eng
land, and was a flyer during the late
war. He taught aviators for four
years in the U.S. Naval Reserve unit ;
at San Diego.
His ship, the El Encanto, with his
navigator at the controls, cracked in
taking off from Oakland on the Dole
flight to Honolulu last summer.
