# DARING REPORTERS TEST SPEED LAW; BEAT TOONERVILLE

"It can be done!"
This was the challenging mes
sage brought back early this
morning by two daring Daily re
porters who last night endured
one of the greatest tests of self
control possible.
Every foot cf the way from the
P.O. to Palo Alto the intrepid re
porters kept within the new cam
pus speed limit! They drove 20
miles an hour the length of Palm
Drive and slowed down to 15 at
all intersections.
Then, weak and tearful from
the contest they returned. The
Daily, as a result of their unique
experiment, is enabled to an
nounce :
"If you drive from the P.O. to
Paly in less than five minutes
and two seconds you break the
law."
To make the trip during the
day when the chains are up and
it is necessary to go around by
Encina the fastest possible legal
time is six minutes and thirty
three seconds.
This applies twenty-four hours
a day.
Conditions might be worse,
however, the Daily reporters
mused. In a late-model high-power
car with four-wheel brakes, good
acceleration and good luck it is
possible legally to get to Palo
Alto in a minute and a half less
time than on the trolley.
"It can be done!"
