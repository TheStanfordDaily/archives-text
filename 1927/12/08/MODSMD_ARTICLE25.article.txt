# KANSAS CITY SELECTED AS LOCATION OF G.O.P. MEET
## Hoover's Chances Brighten As San Francisco Bid Is Rejected CAMPAIGN BEGINS SOON Friends Believe Secretary May Still Continue In Cabinet Post (Special to the Stanford Daily From the United Press) 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. —With the
choice of Kansas City as the center
of the Republican Party Convention
activities next June 12, by the G.O.P.
National Committee here today, the
chances of Secretary of Commerce
Herbert Hoover's for the party presi
dential nomination loomed brighter,
according to political observers. Kan
sas City won the convention after
twenty ballots had been taken.
While no formal declaration has
been made by Hoover some of his
friends now expect that his intention
to campaign for the Executive's of
fice will be announced early in Janu
ary.
These friends, who include such
men as Secretary of Interior Work,
Senator Couzens of Michigan, Nation
al Committeeman W. H. Crocker of
San Francisco, and other prominent
men in key political positions, be
lieve that it will not be necessary for
Hoover to resign his cabinet position
when his candidacy is announced.
Conditions that may arise, however,
that will make this a more desirable
course. Through friends a great deal
of underground support has been
lined up.
Vice-Chairman Charles D. Hilles,
who consistently voted for San Fran
cisco as the city, declared his inten
tion of supporting Charles E. Hughes
for the Republican nomination if San
Francisco had been chosen. This ac
tion showed the attitude of the dele
gates against the selection of a west
ern city and a western candidate.
San Francisco was the closest con
tender and for many ballots the race
was close until the twentieth count
showed that Kansas City had won:
Kansas City, 58; San Francisco, 39;
Detroit, 4; Chicago, 1. If the Detroit
delegates had switched their vote at
the last balloting San Francisco would
have probably received the conven
tion.
