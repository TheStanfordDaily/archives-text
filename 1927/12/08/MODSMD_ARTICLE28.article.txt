# Matters of Opinion

To the long list of bickerings between athletic departments and college
publications is now added another tilt with the Cornell campus as the battle
ground. The editor of the Cornell Daily Sun which, we venture to remark,
is ace high among college newspapers, recently insinuated that Pennsyl
vania had used "unfair tactics" in its Thanksgiving Day game with Cor
nell. (Penn crushed Dobie's team 35-0.)
Similar jousts between athletic departments and publications are easy
to recall: the Harvard-Princeton fiasco; another occurred several years
ago at the University of lowa. The Daily lowan, not getting what it
termed co-operation between the athletic department and its reporters,
banned news of football for two weeks at the height of the season. At
tendance at two games fell off almost fifty per cent and the athletic de
partment was glad to talk things over. Last spring, the Daily, incensed
at an incident in the U.S.C.-Cardinal track meet, suggested severance of
athletics between the institutions. A storm of criticism broke about the
editor's head.
The number of such "attacks" cannot be said to be due to a natural
aversion of these two branches of-activity for each other. We heard it said
recentlp that a rather high official in the Department of Physical Educa
tion "couldn't understand why the Daily didn't like him." Such an ex
pression explains some of the reasons underlying these tilts we're dis
cussing. It is no more a question of liking an official than it is of whether
the editor of a college publication likes cream in his coffee.
The whole matter hinges on opinion of policies and actionsâ€”not of
persons. If he thought "unfair tactics" were used in the Penn-Cornell
game, the editor of the Sun has a perfect right to say that he thought so.
Gil Dobie immediately telegraphed Penn saying that in his "opinion it was
a hard, clean game," and that the editorial was repudiated by the athletic
department. That's Gil's opinion; the editor of the Sun has his opinion.
Nevertheless, we wouldn't be surprised if the editor of the Sun is at present
as welcome around the athletic department offices as Emma Goldberg was
to the United States.
