We were glad to see that the Executive Committee "reconsidered" its
motion of last week and decided to send a delegate to the National Students'
Federation Convention in Lincoln, Nebraska, this month. Stanford will
now be fully represented, the vice-president of the A.S.S.U., and a woman,
the president of A.W.S.
Properly instructed to bring back full reports, the trip of these two
delegates should prove of worth to student government and the student
body in general. The Daily believes that, had not Stanford been repre
sented, the University would have been the loserâ€”now it will be the gainer.
