The AUTOMOBILE PROBELM on the campus brings to memory
something that happened in May, 1925. An indignant person wrote to
President Wilbur a rather classical letter which resulted in much student
joviality, as John Held, Jr., would say. We quote an excerpt:
"If opulent college students are permitted to bring their death-dealing ma
chines to the University, tax them for the payment of police protection to the
community which tolerates their presence. A student rich enough to afford a
personal car should think nothing of paying fifty dollars a month for the priv
ilege of keeping such a luxury in a place consecrated to plain living and high
thinking."
