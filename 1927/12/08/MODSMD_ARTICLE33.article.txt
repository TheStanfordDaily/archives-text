"SEVENTH HEAVEN" at the Pan-!
tages.
This picture is produced on a scope .
equal to "What Price Glory" and !
should be considered as one of the
best, if not the best of the screen
offerings of the year.
This film does not stress realism — |
or rather it does, but goes beyond i
realism. It is the strangest mixture
of high romance and idyllic romance
against the tawdry background that
the screen has witnessed. The stage i
play was classed as a superfine melo-;
drama, but the screen version under j
the deft direction of Frank Borzage, \
lias become an inspired thing. It pre
sents two comparative youngsters,
Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor,,
in the roles of Chico and Diane, and I
many cities have been sounding great
praises of these two newly made j
screen stars.
There have seldom been such love j
scenes on the screen as those of

Diane and Chico. They are exalting
in their beauty. Chico, the sewer rut,
who knows himself to be "a very re
markable fellow," teaches the cowed
and lifeless little Diane to "look up at
tiie stars and not down." Through the
unusual humor that has been inter
jected into the characterizations and
the poetic flights that mark the love
passages, "Seventh Heaven" weaves
a spell that endures long after you
have left the theatre. The spectator
who watches the acting of Mis 3 Gay
nor and Mr. Farrell will find himself
close to a theatregoer's seventh
heaven.
Lest you fear that we are a little
soft-hearted in looking at the love af
fairs of Diane and Chico, we will men
tion that there are some highly in
tense scenes of action in the picture.
Pictures of action at the front —taxi-
cabs rushing to the rescue of the re
treating-French army and the stand
against the German horde make plen
ty of excitcment for the excited.
