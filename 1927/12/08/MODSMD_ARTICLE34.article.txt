# AND Then Our Little SALLY---
## 
### 
There are two very unique institu
tions* on the campus. I mean, they
might just as well be called institu
tions, because everyone thinks they
are. The Roost, and the Cellar.
The Roost, I guess, was originally
meant for men only. That is, when a
girl goes in there now, they all look
at her so strangely. It really is quite
a brave effort to go in for a doughnut
and a cup of coffee, when you know
that there will be mobs and mobs of
unshaven men doing the same thing.
But the Cellar simply refuses to
open before twelve o'clock. And it
always stays closed on Sundays. It
seems to me that they could make a
lot of money on that day, especially
in the evening. I mean the food at
Sunday night suppers is usually ter
rible.
But I love to go to the Cellar in
the afternoon. It is such a nice place
to rest while waiting to get anything
to eat. This is not an advertisement.
But do you see something funny
about the combinations put in the
sandwiches that they have? I mean I
would hesitate before I order.
Stanford —Egg salad and ham.
Encina —Baked ham and tomatoes.
Roble —Egg salad and ham salad.
Varsity—Pimento cheese and ham.
And the Co-ed —Peanut butter and
pimento cheese.
