# SPORTS OF 1927

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
It is a well-known fact that many
Notre Dame football stars go into
coaching after they have left the
famous South Bend institution. Char
ley Crowley, at Columbia; Jimmy
Phelan, at Purdue; Harry Stuhldre
her, at Villanova; Elmer Layden at
Columbia (Iowa); Charles Dorais at
Detroit; and many others teach the
gridiron game as they learned it and
played it at the little Hoosier school.
Out in California, one "Slip" Madi
gan, who is proud to have gone to
Notre Dame as a student, and Adam
Walsh, the greatest center Rocltne
ever had, coach at two small Catholic
universities —Madigan at St. Mary's
in Oakland, and Walsh at Santa
Clara, just outside of San Jose. Both
institutions have produced many
famous athletes; especially has St.
Mary's given baseball stars to the;
big leagues. But it has always been ;
the ambition of both schools to get;
the scalp of Stanford University and j
the University of California in a foot
ball game, and not until this fall did
both St. Mary's and Santa Clara sue-;
ceed in beating one of the state's 1
"Big Three" (U.S.C. is the third uni
versity) in one and the same season. :
This year, however, came the mil- j
lenium, and both Madigan and Walsh
were rewarded by seeing their teams
turn in surprising games and down
"Pop" Warner's red shirts 16 to 0 I
and 13 to G respectively. It must be |

said in favor of Stanford that Coach
Warner and Captain Hal McCreery
were absent when Santa Clara beat
the Cardinals; otherwise, the result
might have been different.
The splendid all-around playing of
Captain Larry Bettencourt of St.
Mary's was one of the features of
(lie Pacific Coast's grid season. The
big Portuguese center of the "Gallop
ing Gaels" was all over the field on
defense, blocking punts, intercepting
passes, and stopping running plays.
He even carried the ball and threw
passes occasionally on offense, and in
the Stanford game scored his tenth
touchdown since he first played for
St. Mary's in 1924.

gridiron game as they learned it and
played it at the little Hoosier school.
Out in California, one "Slip" Madi
gan, who is proud to have gone to
Notre Dame as a student, and Adam
Walsh, the greatest center Rocltne
ever had, coach at two small Catholic
universities —Madigan at St. Mary's
in Oakland, and Walsh at Santa
Clara, just outside of San Jose. Both
institutions have produced many
famous athletes; especially has St.
Mary's given baseball stars to the;
big leagues. But it has always been ;
the ambition of both schools to get;
the scalp of Stanford University and j
the University of California in a foot
ball game, and not until this fall did
both St. Mary's and Santa Clara sue-;
ceed in beating one of the state's 1
"Big Three" (U.S.C. is the third uni
versity) in one and the same season. :
This year, however, came the mil- j
lenium, and both Madigan and Walsh
were rewarded by seeing their teams
turn in surprising games and down
"Pop" Warner's red shirts 16 to 0 I
and 13 to G respectively. It must be |

said in favor of Stanford that Coach
Warner and Captain Hal McCreery
were absent when Santa Clara beat
the Cardinals; otherwise, the result
might have been different.
The splendid all-around playing of
Captain Larry Bettencourt of St.
Mary's was one of the features of
(lie Pacific Coast's grid season. The
big Portuguese center of the "Gallop
ing Gaels" was all over the field on
defense, blocking punts, intercepting
passes, and stopping running plays.
He even carried the ball and threw
passes occasionally on offense, and in
the Stanford game scored his tenth
touchdown since he first played for
St. Mary's in 1924.
