LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7â€”Twelve
male jurors, attempting to determine
whether 38 members of the east of
"Hot Mamas" presented an obscene
production, had not reached a verdict
late today.
They were given the case shortly
before noon and following spirited
arguments by the defense, which con
tended the burlesque presented "art
for art's sake," and the prosecution
which declared it the "world's most
putrid exhibition."
