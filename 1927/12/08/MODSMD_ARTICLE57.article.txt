# HUNT PREDICTS GOOD YEAR FOR FRESHMAN BASKETBALL QUINTET
## 
### 
"It will take an exceptionally good
basketball team to defeat this year's
freshman cagers," said Coach Husky
Hunt in commenting on the babe
quintet's prospects yesterday."The
1931 players are as big and experi
enced as any freshman team that
Stanford has had in years, and if it
wasn't for the fear of some of the
foremost members flunking out, I
could predict still greater success."
Hunt and Assistant Coach Muggs
Mitchell are schooling the babes in
the same style of defense as that
used by the varsity, but a few dif
ferences are noticeable in the of
fensive style, since the large size of
the freshmen does not necessitate a
strict short-pass system.
The squad at present, as announced
by Mitchell, is comprised of J. Cook,
Eastman, Fawcett, Freeman, Gatzert,
Hawkins, Joujon-lloche, Loomis, Mof
fat, Mears, Reynolds, Roberts, G.
Smith, and Tampcke, This is not
final, however, as new prospects may
be discovered by the beginning of
the winter quarter, when the remain
der of the squad will be definitely
dropped.
From now until that time only light
workouts will be held, so that the
players can devote more time to the
preparation for finals. The first game
of the season will be played against
the College of Pacific freshmen on
January 6, and the following night
they will face the Oakland Company,
California Grays.
