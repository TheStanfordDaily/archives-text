# FIRE DAMAGES HOME OF PROFESSOR PRICE
## 
### 
Fire broke out at 7:45 o'clock yes
terday morning in the home of George
C. Price, professor emeritus of zo
ology. No great damage was reported.
Energetic students on their way
to 8 o'clock classes helped to carry
out furniture, and the fire department
soon had the blaze under control. The
cause was due to papers and rubbish
in the basement which were too near
the furnace and ignited, causing a
great amount of smoke.
