# HUNT CUTS CAGE SQUAD DOWN TO SIXTEEN MEN
## Hold Workouts to Prepare For San Jose Golds Saturday Night 
### Merle Emry 
Coach Husky Hunt took another
definite step 111 preparing for confer
ence basketball when he cut the var
sity squad down to sixteen men last
night. While one or two men more
may be dropped this group will repre
sent the Cardinals during the season.
Practice last night was with this
smaller group and it went off better
than any have so far. The squad was
of a more workable size and the spirit
of the men was higher than seen in
previous scrimmages. If the players
show the same brand of floor-work
in the game with the San Jose Golds
Saturday night the result should be
in their favor.
Hunt put into play two teams of
opposite types. It was a quintet that
dribbles constantly versus a group
that passes accurately and consist
ently. Needless to say the one using
the passing system walked away from
its opponents.
With such men as Stark and Mc-
Donald playing for the Golds it was
hopeful to see the work of Bowers
and Richards at forward. These men
will make a pair to interchange with
(he Berg-Cook forward combination.
Stark, it will be remembered, was
the mainstay of the College of Pacific
team that passed Stanford up so
badly last year. 1-Ie is playing center
on the Gold team and is said to be
as deadly a basket-shooter as he was
when he played for Pacific.
The roster at present contains the
following: Berg, Bowers, Bryant,
Cook, Olsen, Richards, Stewart, and
Vincenti, forwards; Biaggini, Dobson,
Thompson, Rothert, and Simkins,
guards; and Clark, McCandless, and
Elliot, centers.
