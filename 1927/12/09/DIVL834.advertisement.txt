A few years ago a very
precious cargo of pipes
sailed from England for the
United States . . . Ben ,
Wades from the famed old
manufactory of the Ben
Wade family in Yorkshire.
Since 1860 Ben Wade
pipes had been made for the
gentlemen of England.
Maybe things move fas
ter in America, but it took
only three years for the Ben
Wade to become a favorite
here among fine pipes. May
be the pipe itself had some
thing to do with that . . . the
beauty of the graining, the
lasting glow of the finish,
the sweetness in smoking,
the smart, traditionally cor
rect designs . . . but the fact
remains that no rack of
good pipes is quite complete
without one.
A particularly fine col
lection invites you to our
establishment.
