Bell and Spigot Joint
'T'HE Bell and Spigot Joint for Cast Iron
Pipe adopted over one hundred years
ago, is the preferred joint today.
It is tight, flexible, easily made and non*
corrodible—there are no bolts to rust out
—it makes changes of alignment or inser
tion of special fittings a simple matter—it
can be taken apart and the pipe used over
again, without any injury—it is not subject
to damage in transit—in fact, it embodies
practically all of the desirable qualities in
an underground joint.
