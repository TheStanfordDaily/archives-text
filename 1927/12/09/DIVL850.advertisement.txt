You, too, will find that LUCKY
STRIKES give the greatest pleasure—
Mild and Mellow, the finest cigarettes
you ever smoked. Made of the choicest
tobaccos, properly aged and blended with
great skill, and there is an extra process
—"IT'S TOASTED" —no harshness, not
a bit of bite.

my throat or caused the slightest cough.
I'tn going to stick with Luckies. ,112
