# CARDINALS TO MEET BRUIN CAGE MEN IN INITIAL P.C.C. GAME
## Dopesters Figure California Will Win Conference Pennant Again 
### 
With Stanford's first conference
basketball game scheduled for Janu
ary 13 with the U.C.L.A. Bruins, pre
dictions are now being made as to
the relative strength of the various
contending teams.
California is preparing to defend
the Pacific Coast title it has held for
the past four years. Nibs Price has a
wealth of material left over from last
year's squad. .Headed hv Captain Jim
Dougery, twelve last year's varsity
men are out for practice at the pres
ent time. In addition four members of
last year's freshman championship
squad are retained on the varsity
roster after a cut announced recently
by Price.
The personnel or the veterans on
the squad includes: Captain Jim Dou
gery, Ralph Dougery, Eisan, Corbin,
Dean, Ruoker, Tripp, Peterson, Greg
ory, Fletcher, and Bradley. With such
a start as this it appears as if Cali
fornia has the decided edge on the
other conference teams.
Trojans started out the season with
fair prospects but a number of in
juries to last year's men leaves only
one able to be out, Jack Bruner, cap
tain. Lewis, regular guard from last
year, sprained his ankle which will
keep him out of the majority of
games. Schultz, forward, was elimi
nated last week when he injured liis
knee, and it is probable that Jess
Uibbs, center veteran, will not be
able to stnnd the pace due to shin
splints which he received in football.
This leaves Coach Leo Calland in a
hole as to having a supply of experi
enced players on hand. He lias ten
freshmen coming up which may be
developed into varsity calibre. At any
rate tlie Trojans do not look as strong
as they did last year.
