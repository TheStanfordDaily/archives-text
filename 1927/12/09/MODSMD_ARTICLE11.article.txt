# Mills College Women Attack Unjust Laws In Debate With Euphronia
## 
### 
Considering the gamut of law breaking
from picking the neighbors flowers to
disobeying the Comstock Law, the de
baters from Mills College and the repre
sentatives of Euphronia held a lively dis
cussion on the question, "Resolved, that
it is right to break unjust laws," last
night in the Old Union.
When three Mills speakers, completely
dispelling one's idea of women debaters,
set out to show three mere men the er
! ror of their ways there is little doubt
of the outcome. At least in such a discus
sion there was no question as to who
had the last word.
Wagner d'Allessio, Lewis Bacr, and
John Cranston defended the affirmative
for Euphronia, while the women from
Oakland supported the negative. Robert
Littler, former varsity debater and act
ing instructor of public speaking, pre
sided.
The first speaker for Euphronia, d'Al
lesio, opened the discussion by submit
ting the points that breaking unjust laws j
often leads to their repeal, that history
substantiated the first point, and that as
justice is the purpose of law, the disobey
ing of unjust laws with justice as an end
was justifiable. Dorothy O'Farrcll re
plied for Mills that justice was not the
sole purpose of law, that the criterion
of law was its efficiency in maintaining
the social order.
Lewis Baer continued for the local so- j
ciety showing that the other means of
dealing with unjust laws were ineffec
tual. Bertha Schwabacher, a very easy
and attractive speaker, claimed that the
judgment of the unjustice of law was a
matter of individual opinion and that
consequently the breaking of unfair laws
by individual methods could only lead to
a chaotic condition.
John Cranston's speech brought out
the idea that there were greater evils in
obeying unjust laws than disregarding
them, as in the observance justice was
defeated. Putting it concisely, it is a
case of legalized injustice versus illegal
justice. The third speaker for Mills,
Jennie-Belle Willmott, showed that there
were many other effectual methods of
obtaining justice than the means pro-1
posed by the affirmative.
Following the debate an informal dis
cussion of the subject was held with
Robert Littler, chairman, exerting his
efforts to hold in check the enthusiasm
of the Mills debaters in answering their
questioners.
