CINCINNATI, 0., Dec. 8â€” Clarence
Darrow became a character witness
| ior George Remus today. Violation of
I the prohibition law, the Chicago at
| torney said, would not affect his opin
! ion of a man's reputation, and so he
i had no hesitancy about testifying in
I favor of the nation's best-known boot
j legger.
Darrow's advent came at a time
j when ihe defense had heard bad
news. The State had served notice it
: was prepared to refute with hand-
I writing of Mrs. Imogene Remus the
story told by Harry Truesdale that
the had offered $10,000 for the slaying
of her husband. Remus contends he
killed her while transitorily insane.
