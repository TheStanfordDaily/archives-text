biological, and social sciences.

Gift to Be Matched
The General Education Board's gift
is to be matched by a similar amount
from other donors, resulting in a total

trustee of the University, at yester
day's board meeting, made the first
gift of $50,000 in this direction, and
President Wilbur announces that an
other $100,000 has been assured from
another source.
The third gift is $170,000 from the
Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial
for research work in the social sci

contained in President Wilbur's an
nual report for the year ended last
August, which will come from the
University Press in a few days. It has
not been made public before.
May Increase Amount
This grant extends over a period
of five years, and there is a possi
bility of an additional $80,000 if equal
funds are obtained by the University
from other sources, which would
bring the total of the Memorial gift
up to $250,000.
A special committee of the faculty
has already made awards for the cur
rent year's allotment, amounting to a
total of $46,450, to seventeen members of
the faculty of the School of Social Sci
ences to aid them in studies they have
undertaken in their fields. The commit
tee, consisting of Professors Murray S.
Wildman, head of the school, Lewis M.
Terman of the psychology department,
Payson J. Treat of the history depart
ment, and Henry W. Stuart of the phi
liosophy department, has distributed the
funds now available to the following
men:
