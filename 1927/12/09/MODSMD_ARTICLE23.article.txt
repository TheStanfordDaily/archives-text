# Don't Worry; We'll Win

It can be safely predicted that in one way, at least, Stanford stands to
win in the Pittsburgh game at Pasadena. That golden victory, of course,
will be a good substantial sum of money in the common form of a "check
made payable to Stanford University." Incidentally, for those who may be
interested in the "game for the game's sake," the betting odds in Los An
geles are reported to favor the Panthers almost 3 to 1.
The total rooters' ticket sale today and yesterday totalled S5O. How
many of these tickets will go to outsiders is, of course, a figure that cannot
be determined. But nevertheless there will be in the neighborhood of
eight hundred or more persons in what might be laughingly called the
"Stanford rooting section." The Rally Committee will do what it can to
make this resemble a REAL STANFORD ROOTING SECTION.
Now, it might be well to rehearse for the beenfit of those students who
may have a strong desire to see that game what the rules of another little
game will be. We refer to the coming winter sport of Catching the Regis
trar. The Registrar's Office will be kept open until 9 o'clock Tuesday
(January 3) evening. Students who lile their study cards, properly signed,
on or before December 20. may register after usual office hours and up to
9 o'clock of that Tuesday evening. Others must obtain their registration
books on that day and. having done so in the usual hours, may file those
before 9 o'clock. Women are warned by Dean Yost of the existing rule
that they must register on January 3 or forfeit their places in the Uni
versity.
Thus far. we have outlined the minimum that students need know be
fore making plans to attend Stanford's "shame game." We hope Stanford
wins from Pittsburgh—it would be such a feather in our cap, we mean it
actually would be. Of course, Stanford stands to win something anyway,
but it would be so nice to win the game, too.
