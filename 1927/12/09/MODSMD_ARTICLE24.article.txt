# Stanford's First U.S. President?
## 
### 
Yesterday's United Press dispatches were of particular interest to
Stanford people in general because of the increased prominence which
Herbert Hoover, Stanford '95, is assuming in the speculation upon the
Republican candidate for president in 1928. The selection of Kansas City
for the convention site of the G.O.P. is said by many political observers
to better Hoover's chances.
The Republican indecision over selecting a convention city resulted in
the longest deadlock in the history of the party in voting on such a ques
tion. Before President Coolidge's Black Hills' announcement, San Fran
cisco might have received the honor, but three days ago Chairman William
11. Butler of the Republican National Committee stated that he favored
Kansas City. The "Heart of America," as that city terms itself, is located
in the center of the farm belt and the farmers arc the chief disgruntled
factors with which the Republican politicians will have to deal.
There is, we believe, a good chance if the party leaders take Coolidge
at his word in the advice he gave to pursue the "serious task of selecting
another candidate" that Hoover will be selected. But consider Coolidge's
statement made Tuesday in explanation of his famous ten-word sentence
beginning "I do not choose—." Tuesday, he requested that his "decision be
respected." What was his decision?
But leaving aside the political dialectics, Hoover's election as President
of the United States would be a wonderful thing for this thirty-six-year
old university. For those who have the interests of the University first
in their hearts, such a thing would be well worth working for. But let
them not be blinded by the fact that he is a Stanford man. Let them make
sure first, in cool judgment, whether or not he is the man for the job (as
suming he is nominated), and then, if the decision is in. the affirmative,
work all the harder for him because lie is a Stanford man.
