To date, the Men's Council has made no statement clarifying the auto
mobile regulations on the campus. They will "enforce the law" and yet ap

of a satisfactory solution to campus auto problems that Judge Maxwell
threw the monkey wrench into the situation. The misfortune of it all is
no excuse for lack of clarification. Even an official statement saying that
"We don't know" would be something.
