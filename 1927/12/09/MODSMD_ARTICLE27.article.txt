"Genius and Character," by Emil Lud
wig. Harcourt, Brace & Co.
Here in this latest translation of a
work of Ludwig, as nowhere else, dues
the genius of Ludwig, himself, become
apparent in the delineation of character
and manifestation of genius whicli are I
expressed with great intuitive understand
ing. Unlike orthodox biographers who
have for centuries written down only a
historical sequence of events from the
lives of those who have interested them;
unlike even Rupert Hughes who has at
tempted recently to interpret the life of
an eminent man in its so-called lowest
terms, Ludwig writes of the people whom |
he considers truly great in a unique way
by drawing sympathetic literary portraits 1
of their physical appearances at the J
several periods of their lives.
Especially is this true in the case of |
Rembrandt, the peasant painter who was '
no less than a genius. Rembrandt made
several portraitures of himself, at the :
several distinct periods of his life. It is 1
from a study of these that Ludwig out- 1
lines the ebb and flow of the life of this
man who was sometimes as prosperous
as a prince and at others as poor as a I
peasant.

Balzac, the prolific French novelist,
who has been perhaps more misunder
stood than any other figure in any litera
ture at any age, is accurately drawn.
Neither are his faults magnified, nor his
virtues neglected. Balzac is explained
in such terms as make his life inevitably
I such as it was, because Balzac existed as
he did in a certain rather unfortunate
environment, with a certain immense
capacity for work and with a certain
genius for the portrayal of a great variety
of characters.
Woodrow Wilson, the pacific Ameri
can genius, is probably the only other
.individual whom it is necessary to con
! sider in the galaxity of preeminent per
sons that Ludwig writes of as no one
j since Plutarch has. Wilson is seen as a
J lean, haggard man, whose mission has
! failed. He has failed to create such a
j league for lite preservation of world
peace as he had wished for so long to
create. His mental vigor and physical
strength have been spent. His life draws
|to a close. He has lived .magnificently,
but at the moment, it appears to him
that he has lived in vain. So Ludwig
speaks of the American "statesman, who
i compassed at once, success and failure.
