B-R-R-R-R-R-R!
(A Hymn of Hate)
Editor print
My dismal note.
Some lowbrow stole
My sheepskin coat!
Clio.—B-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!
How can I go
To my 8 o'clock?
My shivering knees
AVill loudly knock.
Clio.—B-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!

CABBAGES OPINION COLUMN
The Editor, Sir:
1 am worried! How fast can I drive
on the campus? The Mt. View judge
says 15 miles per hour, Fred Prehe
sets 20 as the limit, the campus cop
enforces 30, and Mr. Roth says 40!
What shall 1 do? —junk my car for a
scooter?
Help little,
Pola Doakes.

with flying colors —there ain't no jus
tice. —Li'l Archie, '2 ( J.
