I have just discovered that the
best thing to do is to leave all
your studying until just before
finals. I mean, by that time you
sort of know what the general
idea of a course is, and then it is
really easier to study for it.
But it has been more fun than
ever to go to the library. There
are so many new people who come
in now. I think, sometimes,
though, that they all don't look
as happy as they should. After
all, this is a lovely college.
Of course, the professors aren't
like they were at first. ( mean
they have changed their attitudes
so much. I don't know just how
to say it, but you know what I
mean.
Finals must be loads of fun. I
am rather looking forward to
next week-end. I mean, you never
know what is going to happen. I
wish I knew what a boy was talk
ing about the other day when he
said he guessed he wouid take
out a leave.
It seems so silly to do a thing
like that now, just before finals.
1 have made a firm resolution
not to stay up late at night. Be
cause you never really learn any
thing then, and you might as well
get the sleep.
