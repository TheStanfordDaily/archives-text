# Promising Groups of New Actors To Appear in "Expressing Willie"
## Sophomore Women to Make Debut in Tomorrow Night's Farce 
### 
A promising group of new stars is
lined up for the performance tomor
row night of "Expressing Willie."
While a few of the members of the
cast have appeared in previous cam
pus productions, the feminine mem
bers will make their debut. The sopho
more farce holds a unique position in
campus dramatics, since it is the com
ing-out party for the women who are
debarred from dramatics by freshman
regulations, and this farce includes
an exceptionally promising group.
Paul Speegle, as Willie Smith, the
big toothpaste manufacturer, has the
lead. He is well-suited to the part,
and is given some excellent comedy
opportunities. Speegle will be remem
bered for his part as the stuttering j
bell-hop in last year's junior opera, i
one of the most popular roles of the
play. As Willie Smith he character-'
izes an able young man with inco- j
herent ideas of social ambitions, at
the mercy and under the influence of i
a group of pseudo-sopliisticates.
Rhodes Has Ingenue Role
Patricia Rhodes, as the sweet young '
thing from the country, finally wins ;
our hero from the hands of the sophis
ticates, and is well cast for the role
that brings the necessary sunshine!
into the end of the play.
Edith Jayne, as the mother of AVi 1- !
lie Smith, has the difficult problem ;
of characterization of an older wo- :
man. This is the type of part that j
many of the popular campus stars |
have begun their work here with, and ;
though presenting difficulties, prob
ably will be one of the most interest
ing in the play to watch.
Helen Thompson Shines
Helen Thompson, as Dolly, has
been doing excellent work in rehears
al, and should be pleasing in the ac-;
tual performance, Claire Pierce, as;
the vampire, or villainess of the
farce, is forking under the handicap
of a last-minute change in the cast,
but is well chosen.
Stan Mullin, as Taliferro, will have
an entirely different role from those
in which he has hitherto appeared. !
His part of artist is in direct contrast'
to that of Willie Smith. He has the i
difficult task of portraying an eccen- j
trie artist, with finer sensibilities, j
but an artist that is in no sense a !
burlesque part.
