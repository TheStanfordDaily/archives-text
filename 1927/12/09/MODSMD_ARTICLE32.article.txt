The Editor, Sir:
It seems that the Stanford football
team is being professionalized and so is
the rooting section—and by the Univer
sity authorities themselves. I would not
have believed it possible, myself, had 1
not been informed of the fact that it
will cost me two dollars to register after
9 o'clock Tuesday night.
This merely means that the Univer
sity authorities either do not want me to
see Stanford lick Pittsburgh—or else
that they are taking advantage of the
fact that there is a football game in
Pasadena on January 2 to make a thou
sand dollars or so extra. They aren't
really professionalizing the football team.
But they are professionalizing the root
ing section.
But the game is going to be played,
and 1 am going to be among a thousand
other Stanford men and women who wi\
have to pay pretty high prices for our
rooters' seats.
The initial cost of a seat in the root
ing section is $1.50. Then comes the blow
—$2.00 more for late registration, un
! less one can cover the 500 miles frgm
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena back to Stan
ford University between 6 o'clock Mon
day evening and 9 o'clock Tuesday eve
ning.
Figure the percentage—over a thou
sand rooters or more expect to attend the
game. Suppose half of them leave right*
after the game on a mad dash for home.
The women especially must make haste,
or they will lose their places as registered
students.
Five hundred times $2.00 ought to
bring in a $1,000. I suppose that the Uni- j
versity authorities could not rest con- j
tent with letting the Board of Athletic;
Control use the football team to gather
approximately a $50,000 profit on the I
game, and decided that they would get'
their cut by professionalizing the rooters j
to the tune of $2.00 a head.
Can't we have a little justice?
A ROOTER.
