"What did she study?" Joseph
Henry Jackson, editor of the Sunset
Magazine asked this question over
Ihe phone in his office in San Fran
cisco. "Oh yes, English courses . . .
an English major . . . yes." Jackson
smiled, giving the Daily's reporter a
significant glance. "Have her come
around," he added.
Mr. Jackson had been telling of
the great number of college gradu
ates, especially women, who come to
him daily asking for jobs. These wo
men have been English majors who
knew nothing of typewriting or oft
shorthand accomplishments useful to
candidates for a position in the edi
torial department of a magazine. On
the telephone, lie had just been talk
ing about a friend of his wife and a
graduate of Cornell.
"Most everyone who comes into
editorial work on a magazine is a
college graduate. We have here only
one who is not, said Jackson, who is
himself a Lafayette man.
Editing Experience Best
"However, the experience that a
person gets in editing a college peri
odical is usually better than that ac
quired by the one who has merely
contributed, well for instance, poetry,
even though all the cousins and aunts
of the undergraduate poet have pro
nounced his verse excellent. God
knows, I have written enough poetry
myself, but I want people whom I
employ to be practical first of all."
"What do you think the prospective
editorial worker on a magazine should
study while he is yet an undergradu
ate?" Jackson was asked.
"Obviously he should have a sound
background in English. Economics,
history, well, almost anything he
studies, should help him later. While
I was in college, I believe that I got
most from a course in current events

| which was given by men from several
universities. Probably history has
j been modernized every where now; I
don't know." Jackson, himself, looks
| hardly more than thirty. It can not
I be very long since he was in college.
"A college education is perfect pre
paration for any career, I think. I
don't see why the college man should
j not have an edge on those who have
not been to college. Especially, have
I found that training in til business
end of college publications is valu
; able after graduation.
"The kind of college graduates who
are literary only, literary with a cap
; ital 'L,' are not likely to make a suc
; cess of magazine work unless that
are to some degree practical," Jack
j son said.

"The kind of college graduates who
are literary only, literary with a cap

are to some degree practical," Jack
j son said.
"What did she study?" Joseph
Henry Jackson, editor of the Sunset
Magazine asked this question over
Ihe phone in his office in San Fran
cisco. "Oh yes, English courses . . .
an English major . . . yes." Jackson
smiled, giving the Daily's reporter a
significant glance. "Have her come
around," he added.
Mr. Jackson had been telling of
the great number of college gradu
ates, especially women, who come to
him daily asking for jobs. These wo
men have been English majors who
knew nothing of typewriting or oft
shorthand accomplishments useful to
candidates for a position in the edi
torial department of a magazine. On
the telephone, lie had just been talk
ing about a friend of his wife and a
graduate of Cornell.
"Most everyone who comes into
editorial work on a magazine is a
college graduate. We have here only
one who is not, said Jackson, who is
himself a Lafayette man.
Editing Experience Best
"However, the experience that a
person gets in editing a college peri
odical is usually better than that ac
quired by the one who has merely
contributed, well for instance, poetry,
even though all the cousins and aunts
of the undergraduate poet have pro
nounced his verse excellent. God
knows, I have written enough poetry
myself, but I want people whom I
employ to be practical first of all."
"What do you think the prospective
editorial worker on a magazine should
study while he is yet an undergradu
ate?" Jackson was asked.
"Obviously he should have a sound
background in English. Economics,
history, well, almost anything he
studies, should help him later. While
I was in college, I believe that I got
most from a course in current events

| which was given by men from several
universities. Probably history has
j been modernized every where now; I
don't know." Jackson, himself, looks
| hardly more than thirty. It can not
I be very long since he was in college.
"A college education is perfect pre
paration for any career, I think. I
don't see why the college man should
j not have an edge on those who have
not been to college. Especially, have
