# Cornell Freshmen Enjoy Hot Time at Hades Party
## 
### 
Cornell freshmen were the guests last
Monday night of the sophomores at the
annual Hades party. The freshmen un
derwent various ordeals of initiation.
This year's party represented symboli
cally the abolition of the spirit of un
friendliness which is always prevalent
between the entering and the sophomore
classes.
