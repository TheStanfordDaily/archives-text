# ANNOUNCE WESTERN EUROPE TOUR UNDER DIRECTION OF BRAND
## Stanford History Professor To Personally Conduct Summer Travel 
### 
A personally conducted tour of
Western Europe, primarily for Stan
ford* students and their friends, is
being organized for next summer by
Professor Carl P. Brand of the His
tory department. The itinerary will
include France, Switzerland, the
Illiinelands, Italy, the Lowlands, and
England. More than two months will
be devoted to the trip, so that the
party may cover the schedule in an
unhurried manner.
"It is especially valuable to visit
Europe at this time," declared Pro
fessor Brand, "as we may see the
various nations in the process of re
construction after the Great War."
Brand will personally conduct the
tour. He is familiar with the con
tinent as he recently spent several
years there.
One of the features of the trip will
be a steamer ride down the Rhine.
According to Brand, this is the only
way to see the rugged beauty of the
country. The party will also visit the
Olympic Games in Amsterdam. Sev
eral days have been given over for
attending these international con
tests.
