# ART GALLERY PLACES COLLECTION OF COLOR PRINTS ON EXHIBITION
## 
### 
An exhibition of color prints by Pedro
J. Lemos, Director of the Stanford Mu
seum and Art Gallery, has been opened
in one of the exhibition rooms of the
Gallery.
The prints are produced by aquatint
etchings, a method used largely in Eu
rope by artists for securing color etch
ings. In addition to these, Lemos has
included twenty color block prints, made
after the Japanese method. This process
is one which he has adapted, simplified
and introduced to the art and public
schools throughout America. Instead of
a printing press the print is produced by
the use of a burnisher made from a
bamboo leaf.
Etching and color printing has been
a subject of special art interest to Lemos
for twenty years. Beside receiving the
Honorable Mention for his prints at the
Panama Pacific Exposition and the Gold
Medal at the 1917 California State Ex
position, Lemos has exhibited his prints
in the prominent eastern galleries, and
he is a member of all the leading etch
ers' societies.
A case in the center of the exhibition
space at the art gallery contains a group
of materials showing tools and plates and
blocks, illustrating the progressive stages
of the art of color print making.
The collection of prints is scheduled
to be on display for two weeks. The gal
lery is open every day from 10 until 5
o'clock, and admission is free to the pub
lic.
