# Library Ink Bills Run High 40 Gallons Used Per Year Would Send Ford 800 Miles

If ink were gasoline, the amount of
ink used in the library each year would
be more than enough for a Ford to run
eight hundred miles on, for according to
the authorities in the bookstore, forty
gallons a year is furnished by them for
the library.
At this rate, 240 gallons has been used
in the past six years since the installation
of the four inkwells in the library, and
4,000 gallons would be used in one hun
dred years.
Years ago the community inkwell was
installed in the bookstore for the useof
the entire campus, but this was removed
at the occurrence of various and sundry
inky battles in the store. The custom
of carrying ink bottles around for per
sonal use then arose, and because of this
custom, many ink bottles were left about
on the library tables and desks and
periodically whole bottles of ink were
unavoidably sylashed about on the library
lloors. Out of self-protection or per
haps generosity, the librarian had the
present inkwells installed in the new
library building six years ago.
