# AFRICAN COLLECTION SHIPPED TO MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
## 
### 
Fletcher Walker, Jr., '26, and his
j brother, Kenneth, two Stanford students
hunting in Africa, are sending to Stan
ford a consignment of specimens for the
| Natural History Museum, according to
la letter received from them recently by
i President Wilbur. The consignment will
! reach here some time in January.
The hunters collected fur the Univer
j sity six groups of animals, including
Grant gazelles, Thompson gazelles, great
er kudu, lesser kudu, and one Gerenuck
antelope. In addition, skulls of the ele
phant, rihnoceros, hippopotomas, wart
j hog, baboon, wildebeest, lion, cheetah,
and jackal were collected and will be
j forwarded to Stanford.
In 1925 the Natural History Museum
collections became so extensive that they
i were brought under curatorial care and
I transferred from the zoology building,
Jordan Hall, to the west wing of the
Art Museum where, together with the
botanical collections, they are now housed
under fireproof protection.
In speaking of the consignment being
sent the University by the Walkers, Dr.
John O. Snyder, professor of zoology,
says, "This collection will be a valuable
addition to our Natural History Mu
seum. We have nothing like the mate
rial collected by the Walkers, and the
specimens will, no doubt, in time be
mounted and placed on exhibition.
"1 he University is interested not only
in the protection of present collections
but in their steady growth. Our inten
tion is to build up a museum of investi
gation where material of valuable nature
may be preserved. It is our intention
to assemble display collections which will
be open to the public. These displays
are expected to furnish material for reg
ular class demonstrations."
