# HERE'S ADVICE FOR CAMPUS MOTORISTS!
## 
### 
Obey all signs! But, if you are
arrested while driving on the
campus, demand that you be
tried before Judge Charles of Palo
Alto.
That constitutes the best advice
which the Daily can give to stu
dent auto drivers. No statement
has been made by the Men's
Council and the Daily is offering
this as the best rule of conduct at
the present time.
So far as can be learned at
present, the following is the situa
tion in regard to the automobile
regulation difficulty:
1. That Neikirk was arrested
and tried for passing an intersec
tion above the permissible speed.
Judge Maxwell's decision, then,
in regard to the speed for Palm
Drive, exclusive of intersections,
is obiter dicta and has no bear
ing upon what is the speed limit
for the campus.
2. The old regulations, as were
posted at the Administration
Building, are the ones to follow
except where they conflict with
the new signs posted on the cam
pus. In case of conflict follow the
signs.
3. Unless there is some con
tract, implied or expressed, with
the students, the Councils have
r.o right to try and fine viola
tions. This has not been estab
lished as yet, and the Daily
recommends that anyone arrested
on the campus demand to go be
fore Judge Charles of Palo Alto.
(This is a right given by the Cali
fornia State Motor Vehicle Act.)
