# Four Big Ten Schools to Use Two-Team Football
## 
### 
Universities of Wisconsin, lowa, and j
Illinois have decided to join Michigan in
trying out the innovation of two-team
football. In the 1928 season, each insti
tution will put two varsities on the field
to compete with the two that each other
college supplies.
Illinois and lowa will use second teams
only when the regular elevens arc play
ing away from home. Roth Michigan
and Wisconsin have planned double-!
headers on their own grounds.
