# FLOOD CONTROL IS TOPIC OF LECTURE
## 
### 
To control the disastrous floods of the
J Mississippi river and to prevent the
j gradual lowering of the Great Lakes are
j the two big problems facing the engi
j neers of the country, according to Dr.
| William Morris Davis, who lectured yes
terday on"The Physiographic Bases of!
the Regulation of the Mississippi River
and the Great Lakes."
j Dr. Davis explained the habits of the
j big river, showing how it tends con
j stautly to cut its channel in wider and
j wider curves until the ends of the horse
| shoes approach each other so closely
j that they coalesce, forming a new course,
j Since in flood times the levees on the
I bends do not hold so well as those on
I the straighter parts, the lecturer pointed
(out the advantages of deliberately
straightening a river's channel as has
been done successfully with the Rhine.
| He pointed out, however, that "to make
I a mistake with the Mississippi might be
! very disastrous."
Since lowering of six inches in the
(level of the Great Lakes is reported to
| mean a money loss of $6,000,00U yearly
|to shippers, Dr. Davis showed the eco
nomic importance of regulating the water
(supply. Besides affording transportation,
the lakes are looked to for water power,
drinking water, and in the case of Chi
cago, water for a drainage canal.
A system of dams and locks is the!
solution proposed by engineers who, by'
closing the out-flow of Lake Erie, for l
example, six hours each night believe j
they can counteract evaporation suffi
ciently not only to maintain the present j
volume of water, but gradually to build
up to the former level. Wing dams to |
spread out the flow of Niagara falls, re-j
suiting in an improved, scenic effect as |
well as in furnishing a greater supply!
of water power is also under considera- j
tion, says Dr. Davis, who characterized I
the plans as "ingenious and daring," I
