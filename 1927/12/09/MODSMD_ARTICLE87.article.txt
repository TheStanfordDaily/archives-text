# McGILL DAILY TAKES OVER DATING BUREAU
## 
### 
The McGill Daily has recently in
augurated a rather novel dating bu
reau for the use of undergraduates
finding their evenings hanging heavy
on their hands. Gentlemen and co-eds
desiring dates inform the Daily of
this fact by letter; the Daily assigns
odd numbers to the men, even to the
women; shuffles them up, and prints
the results as "assignments" every
morning: "No. 29 meet No. 14," No.
31 meet No. 10," etc.
