His report of what happens "when
coaches get together" follows:
Pour of the country's most success
ful football (touches got together re
cently unci among other subjects dis
cussed was: "The Greatest Player I
Ever Coached."
When 1 tell you that the coaches
wero K n ute Rockne, Tad and Howard
Jones, and "Pop" Warner, and you
stop to consider the mighty men in
moleskin who have played under
these football emperors, you will ap
preciate what it means to have such
first-hand judgment on such a subject.
JONES NAMES CALDWELL
First of all, Tad Jones' choice
may surprise you, although it did
n't surprise me. The Yale coach
named Bruce Caldwell.
"Just about as great a back as
1 ever saw or heard of," said Tad,
referring to the youngster who
was rendered ineligible just be
fore the major games of his last
season.
Kicker, passer, ball carrier,
blocker, and tackier, Caldwell
could do just about everything in
as clean cut fashion, with more
drive and energy and accuracy,
than any back of the year.
If I were selecting an All-Amer
ica eleven based upon my own
opinion, Bruce Caldwell would be
first choice.
Well, after Tad Jones had surprised
everyone by naming Caldwell, it was
generally expected that "Pop" War
ner would name Jim Thorpe, the
mighty Indian.
NEVERS ECLIPSES THORPE
Rut "Pop" said, no, that Ernie
Nevers, now a professional, was a
more valuable football player than
Thorpe.
"If Thorpe had possessed
Nevers' temperament, he might
have been the greater, but Jim
j was lazy. He wasn't trying all the
time. Ernie was, and Ernie could
do just about anything with a
football when he tried." Warner
said he rated Nevers as the great
; est back of all time, certainly the
\ superior of Drury, this year's Pa
cific Coast star.
Drury, naturally, was Howard
Jones' choice. The Southern Califor
nia captain did not set the stands on
fire with his performance in the Notre
Dame game. He kicked well, alternat
ing with Jess Hibbs, who is real All-
American, passed and started like a i
streak of lightning from punt forma
tion. But he did not seem at home on
the slippery field, he fumbled a couple
of times, and he missed the kick
which would have meant at least a
tie for the Trojans.

Ever Coached."
When 1 tell you that the coaches
wero K n ute Rockne, Tad and Howard
Jones, and "Pop" Warner, and you
stop to consider the mighty men in
moleskin who have played under
these football emperors, you will ap
preciate what it means to have such
first-hand judgment on such a subject.
JONES NAMES CALDWELL
First of all, Tad Jones' choice
may surprise you, although it did
n't surprise me. The Yale coach
named Bruce Caldwell.
"Just about as great a back as
1 ever saw or heard of," said Tad,
referring to the youngster who
was rendered ineligible just be
fore the major games of his last
season.
Kicker, passer, ball carrier,
blocker, and tackier, Caldwell
could do just about everything in
as clean cut fashion, with more
drive and energy and accuracy,
than any back of the year.
If I were selecting an All-Amer
ica eleven based upon my own
opinion, Bruce Caldwell would be
first choice.
Well, after Tad Jones had surprised
everyone by naming Caldwell, it was
generally expected that "Pop" War
ner would name Jim Thorpe, the
mighty Indian.
NEVERS ECLIPSES THORPE
Rut "Pop" said, no, that Ernie
Nevers, now a professional, was a
more valuable football player than
Thorpe.
"If Thorpe had possessed
Nevers' temperament, he might
have been the greater, but Jim
j was lazy. He wasn't trying all the
time. Ernie was, and Ernie could
do just about anything with a
football when he tried." Warner
said he rated Nevers as the great
; est back of all time, certainly the
\ superior of Drury, this year's Pa
cific Coast star.
Drury, naturally, was Howard
Jones' choice. The Southern Califor
nia captain did not set the stands on
fire with his performance in the Notre
Dame game. He kicked well, alternat
ing with Jess Hibbs, who is real All-
American, passed and started like a i
streak of lightning from punt forma
tion. But he did not seem at home on
the slippery field, he fumbled a couple
of times, and he missed the kick
which would have meant at least a
tie for the Trojans.
