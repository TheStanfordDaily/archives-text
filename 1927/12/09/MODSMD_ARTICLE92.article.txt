Stanford's varsity basketball squad
will invade the south during Christmas
vacation, playing games with the Hol
lywood Athletic Club and San Bernar
dino Junior College. Tentative arrange
ments are being made to engage another
contest.
The Hollywood Athletic Club is re
ported to have a stronger team than the
one last year that defeated the Cardinals
24 to 18. Little is known about the
strength of the San Bernardino players.
The schedule calls for the Hollywood
game on December 28 and the junior col
lege contest on December 30.
Disband Before Christmas
The team will disband after playing
the Y.M.I, quintet in San Francisco, De
cember 22, and will meet again in the
south for the Hollywood game. Hunt's
men will play their remaining engage
ment with the San Jose Teachers' College
Tuesday night. Both games are to be
played in San Jose.
A team composed entirely of men who
have not played Varsity basketball bc
bore will start Stanford's first practice
game of the season against the San Jose
Y.M.C.A. Golds at San Jose tonight.
Golds Are Good
The San Jose Golds are men who play
basketball for the love of the sport.
Their ability at floorwork and basket
shooting cannot be rated too highly, ac
cording to varsity players who have
watched them in action. Stark, College
of Pacific star who was seen playing
against Stanford last year, is forward
for the San Jose team. Others who will
start are McDonald, center; Reed and
Meredith, guards; and Reordan, who will
play opposite Stark at forward.
The contest tomorrow night is called
for 8:15 o'clock in the San Jose High
School gymnasium.
