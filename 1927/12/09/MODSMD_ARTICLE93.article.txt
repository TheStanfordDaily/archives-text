# Graduation Will Make Inroads On P.C.C. Grid Teams
## 
### 
Graduation again will make its an
nual severe inroads on the teams of the
Pacific Coast Conference. Of these, the
northern colleges, especially W.S.C., will
be bit the hardest.
The Cougars lost eight three-year reg
ulars, including the dynamic Captain
"Butch" Meeker. At the start of the 1927
season, the Cougars, with their large
supply of veterans, were given the odds
to win the coast title, but they Hopped
early in the race.
Ole Robbins, All-Conference end, will
lead the list of men to drop from the
Oregon State squad. Logan, Badley, and
Luby are other who played their last
game under the Orange.
Ten Huskies Through
Ten Huskies would up their collegiate
careers last Saturday, after twice mak
ing a bid to repeat their title-winning
year. Two ends, two centers, two guards,
a tackle, and three backs are in the lot.
Captain Pat Wilson, former All-Coast
tackle, and Bill Wright, mentioned for
Ail-American honors at guard, will leave
big gaps in Bagshaw's team. Bonamy
and Lauzon, the two regular centers,
Schuh and Douglas, regular ends, Shaw,
another regular guard, and Cook, drop
kick artist and substitute fullback, com
plete the - list.
Trojans Lose Heavily
The Trojans lose more stellar regu
lars than any other California team, al
though the value of the graduating Cards
and Bears is considerable.
Morley Drury, undeniably All-Ameri
can, Schcving, a regular tackle, Elliott,
substitute quarter, Moser, understudy to
Jesse Hibbs, and Max Thomas, utility
backfield, have completed their football
at Southern California.
