Football and golf do mix! Even |
though it would be hard to find two
games more unlike, there is some
thing about the Scotch pastime that
attracts the football player in later
life. Especially is this true of the
coach, and it is safe to say that
seventy-five per cent of the gridiron
mentors of the country play golf.
Out on the Pacific Coast, it is no
uncommon thing for Howard Jones,
of the University of Southern Cali
fornia; "Nibs" Price, of California;!
and "Pop" Warner, of Stanford, to |
play a round together while talking!
over next season's football plans, and |
the victories and defeats of the past, j
"Pop" Warner, especially, has gone t
into this golf business heavily. Al-;
ways of an analytical and inventive'

| turn of mind, it was no wonder that
he soon had designed some novel
clubs of his own, and turned out sev
eral of the models by hand.
Warner's theories on club design
ing are sound, if unorthodox. He has
made and uses a driver of stream
line design, carved out of a beech
bed-post. The club head is about six
inches long with the grain of the
wood at right angles to the face. The
shaft is set in line with the center of
; the club-head, and, although there is
| an unusually large hitting surface, the
! the frictional resistance is reduced
! much as possible elsewhere. The ex
| tra length puts the weight in the back
jof the club-head more in a straight
; line behind the ball, no matter wheth
i er it is struck in the center of the

lace or not.
And don't think for a minute that
Pop can't use this trick weapon of
bis. A few years ago he read that
Tad Jones had made a hole-in-one
shot. "Humph!" he snorted, took out
his torpedo-shaped driver, and swung
with all his might and main, putting
all of his 240 pounds into the foil
throughâ€”and slipped and fell! The
ball sailed 330' yards down the fair
way, but "Pop" was lame for a week!
