# 35,000 Pasadena Game Tickets Go To Public
## Box, Cheap Seats Are Taken By Preferred Groups 
### 
PASADENA, Dec. 8. —(Special) —
Thirty-five thousand tickets for the
Pittsburgh-Stanford football game in
the Rose Bowl, January 2, have been
put on sale to the general public. No
pasteboards are being sold across the
counter, but application blanks are
available to all.
Half of the seats in the stadium —
approximately 35,000i —have been ap
plied for by alumni of the two uni
versities and those on the Tourna
ment of Roses mailing list. Practi
cally all the box seats and the $3
scats are gone, leaving mostly $5
tickets.
Indications point to the fact that
the entire stadium will be sold out
within the next week or ten days,
and possibly sooner, since the Pan
ther-Cardinal battle has attracted
nation-wide attention. The general
public will have a better chance at
the tickets this year than last, as the
final day of preference is December
12. After that date, all applications
received will be treated alike. Last
year, preferred classes were given
until December 22 to file their appli
cations.
