DOSIii BOW L, PASADENA, Jan. 2. —Stanford University, displaying a more
versatile attack, eked out a 7 to G victory over the University of Pitts
burgh in the annual Tournament of Roses contest here today.
It was a victory for Western football over Eastern; it was a triumph of
teacher over student; it was an exciting, freakish affair with the result in
doubt until the final whistle blew.
Withal it was played in the picturesque tradition of the annual East-West
New ear s game with a crowd of 65,000 roasting under a hot southern
California sun.
Individual honors went to Hoffman and Wilton of Stanford. Gibby
Welch, the Panther Ail-American back, played as well as any for the
visitors and his main support came from Booth and Hagan. Hoffman

* converted after Stanford's touch
down and Booth failed after
Pitt's, this marking the margin
of the victory.
Pitt scored first in the third quar
ter when the white helmeted Jimmy
Hagan scooped up a Stanford fumble
and dashed twenty yards to a touch
down. Booth's attempt at goal was
blocked.
Stanford scored its points in the
same quarter. After carrying the ball
the length of the field to within two
yards of the goal line, Sims fumbled,
but the ball was bounced to Wilton,
who carried it five yards to a touch
down.
Kick Means Victory
Hoffman's conversion kick carried
true and meant victory for Stanford
and Coach Pop Warner over Pitt and
Jock Sutherland. "Jock" learned his
football from Warner when the latter
was head mentor at Pitt.
The game was filled with the plays
that made the Warner system known
the country over. In the main, Stan
ford used the double and triple passes
and reverses with more effect than
Pitt. Stanford once resorted to the
"Statue of Liberty" play and often
called a guard around end.
Pitts' Attack Weak
For the most part Pitt's attack
seemed weak. Welch occasionally
broke loose for a ten- or fifteen-yard
gain and Booth did most of the gain
ing on Pitt's best offensive gesture.
More than three quarters of tha
game found the ball in Pitt territory.
Hagan and Hoffman supplied
the crowd with one of the best
punting duels of the season. Both
averaged over 50 yards in send
ing long spirals down the field.
Hoffman did most of the ball
toting for Stanford in addition to
caring for the punting and pass
ing. It was Wilton's fumble which
gave Pitta chance to score but
he later made this up by scoring
himself.
Tricky Dick Hyland, Stanford's
open field runner, played only a short
time during the first half.
Both teams resorted to numerous
passes with only mediocre success.
Neither team was able to register
during the first half although Stanford
showed to a distinct advantage.
Once in the first and again in
the second quarter the Cardinals,
with Hoffman bearing the brunt
of the attack, carried the ball to
the shadow of the goal line.
Pitt stiffened in each instance
and Hagan's beautiful spirals
pushed Stanford back to midfield.
Although both teams tried nu
merous passes only a few were
completed and these had little
effect on the general ground gain
ing.
Pitt's entire attack during this
period consisted of two spectacu
lar dashes by the versatile Welch.
The play was almost entirely in
Pitt territory, the Panthers having
(he ball only once on Stanford ground,
and on that occasion could get no
further than the forty-five-yard line.
Punts Spectacular
Pitt received the kick-off and after
three ineffective attempts to gain,
