DOSIii BOW L, PASADENA, Jan. 2. —Stanford University, displaying a more
versatile attack, eked out a 7 to G victory over the University of Pitts
burgh in the annual Tournament of Roses contest here today.
It was a victory for Western football over Eastern; it was a triumph of
teacher over student; it was an exciting, freakish affair with the result in
doubt until the final whistle blew.
Withal it was played in the picturesque tradition of the annual East-West
New ear s game with a crowd of 65,000 roasting under a hot southern
California sun.
Individual honors went to Hoffman and Wilton of Stanford. Gibby
Welch, the Panther Ail-American back, played as well as any for the
visitors and his main support came from Booth and Hagan. Hoffman

* converted after Stanford's touch
down and Booth failed after
Pitt's, this marking the margin
of the victory.
Pitt scored first in the third quar
ter when the white helmeted Jimmy
Hagan scooped up a Stanford fumble
and dashed twenty yards to a touch
down. Booth's attempt at goal was
blocked.
Stanford scored its points in the
same quarter. After carrying the ball
the length of the field to within two
yards of the goal line, Sims fumbled,
but the ball was bounced to Wilton,
who carried it five yards to a touch
down.
Kick Means Victory
Hoffman's conversion kick carried
true and meant victory for Stanford
and Coach Pop Warner over Pitt and
Jock Sutherland. "Jock" learned his
football from Warner when the latter
was head mentor at Pitt.
The game was filled with the plays
that made the Warner system known
the country over. In the main, Stan
ford used the double and triple passes
and reverses with more effect than
Pitt. Stanford once resorted to the
"Statue of Liberty" play and often
called a guard around end.
Pitts' Attack Weak
For the most part Pitt's attack
seemed weak. Welch occasionally
broke loose for a ten- or fifteen-yard
gain and Booth did most of the gain
ing on Pitt's best offensive gesture.
More than three quarters of tha
game found the ball in Pitt territory.
Hagan and Hoffman supplied
the crowd with one of the best
punting duels of the season. Both
averaged over 50 yards in send
ing long spirals down the field.
Hoffman did most of the ball
toting for Stanford in addition to
caring for the punting and pass
ing. It was Wilton's fumble which
gave Pitta chance to score but
he later made this up by scoring
himself.
Tricky Dick Hyland, Stanford's
open field runner, played only a short
time during the first half.
Both teams resorted to numerous
passes with only mediocre success.
Neither team was able to register
during the first half although Stanford
showed to a distinct advantage.
Once in the first and again in
the second quarter the Cardinals,
with Hoffman bearing the brunt
of the attack, carried the ball to
the shadow of the goal line.
Pitt stiffened in each instance
and Hagan's beautiful spirals
pushed Stanford back to midfield.
Although both teams tried nu
merous passes only a few were
completed and these had little
effect on the general ground gain
ing.
Pitt's entire attack during this
period consisted of two spectacu
lar dashes by the versatile Welch.
The play was almost entirely in
Pitt territory, the Panthers having
(he ball only once on Stanford ground,
and on that occasion could get no
further than the forty-five-yard line.
Punts Spectacular
Pitt received the kick-off and after
three ineffective attempts to gain,
Hagan punted. It was the first of a
series of long kicks that Hagan was
to get off during the afternoon. The
ball carried fully fifty yards.
After another exchange of
punts, Stanford, with Hoffman
and Hyland carrying the ball,
took the pigskin from the fifty- to
the twenty-five-yard line. Hoffman
made it first down on the fifteen
yard line and then added six
more to the nine-yard line. Pitt
tightened here, however, and the
ball went to Pitt after Hoffman,
Hyland, and Hill had failed to
move it an inch closer to the goal.
When Stanford next obtained pos
session of the ball, it turned to long
passes, Hoffman doing the hurling.
These fell in unoccupied territory, or
were knocked down by Welch. Welch

intercepted one of
the long heaves on
his own tliirty-six
yard line just as
the quarter ended.
Up until that time,
it was the deepest
point in which
Pitt had posses
sion of the ball.
Welch opened
the second quar
ter by running his
own right end for

sixteen yards. Several more plays ad
vanced the ball to the forty-flve-yard
line, Pitt's foremost position since
the start of the game, but here a pass
hurled by Welch was intercepted by
Murphy of Stanford, who returned
from the forty-nine- to the forty-yard
line.
This led to Stanford's second
determined effort to score. Hoff
man dashed seventeen yards to a
first down on the twenty-seven
yard line and Wilton then made
it first down on the seventeen
yard line in two off-tackle
smashes.
Hoffman made four and another
four to the eight-yard line and made
another first down on the six-yard
line. Wilton traveled right end to the
two-yard line. Hoffman attempted to
carry the ball over left guard but was
thrown for a loss and the ball went
to the Panthers.
The ball changed hands often dur
ing the final minutes of the half but
neither team gained much ground.
Apparently refreshed by the rest at
half time, Pitt opened the third quar
ter with its most sustained attack of
the game. With Booth doing most of
the work, the ball was taken to the
twenty-yard line. The Pitt fullback
was stopped there and a pass thrown
by Welch was grounded across the
goal line.
On the next play, Wilton fum
bled a pass from center and the
speedy Jimmy Hagan scooped it
up and ran 20 yards to a touch
down, with the first score of the
game. Booth failed to convert
when Heinecke blocked the kick.
A few minutes later Stanford
took the lead when Hoffman con
verted after Wilton's score.
The play on which Wilton
crossed the goal line must be
rated as one of the freaks of the
season.
With the ball on the Pitt three
yard line, Wilton passed to Sims,
who caught the pigskin and after
running two yards, fumbled. The
ball bounced clear of the pile-up
of players, and to a corner of the

field where Wilton took it on a
high bound and scooted five yards
to a touchdown.
Stanford took the ball from one
goal line to the other in making this
score. The march started when Mur
phy returned Booth's kick-off to the
thirty-five-yard line. Biff Hoffman
dropped back and sent a forty-yard
pass into the arms of Worden, plac
ing the ball on the Pitt thirty-yard
line. Hoffman made it first down on
the twenty-yard line by crashing
through left guard. Wilton, Post, and
Hoffman combined to carry the ball
to the two-yard line, where Wilton
stepped in to score.
The quarter ended immediately
afterward.
Stanford threatened once again
in the final period when Post, on
a guard around end play ran
thirty yards to the Pitt thirty-one
yard line. This run by the big
Stanford linesman was the long
est of the game.
An orgy of passing in the final min
utes failed to give much aid to Pitt.
Stanford's superiority perhaps was
shown best in the first-down tabula
tion. The big Red team made the
necessary ten yards on fourteen oc
casions. Pitt made only seven. Stan
ford registered five first downs in the
first quarter, three in the second, four
in the third, and two in the last.
Pitt's first downs were concen
trated in the third period when it
totalled four. Two came in the first
and one in the second and none in
the last period.
Pitt gained a total of one hundred
and forty-three yards from scrimmage,
while Stanford made two hundred and
forty-one yards.
Stanford, with Hoffman usually
back in punt formation, attempted
twelve passes. Four of these were
completed and netted sixty-five yards.
Pitt tried to pass on fourteen occa
sions but completed only three for a
total of twenty-six yards.
A hot sun poured down on the
players and the 65,000 spectators
throughout the game. Press box deni
zens worked without coats or vests.
This heat seemed to affect the
play of the Easterners, more ac
customed to rainy and cold foot
ball days. The Panthers seemed
to wilt a few minutes after the
beginning of each period. In the
final quarter none of the Pitt

men could get down under the
long, high kicks of Hagan and it
gave Stanford's safety man ample
opportunity to nestle the ball and
start back up the field.

DOSIii BOW L, PASADENA, Jan. 2. —Stanford University, displaying a more
versatile attack, eked out a 7 to G victory over the University of Pitts
burgh in the annual Tournament of Roses contest here today.
It was a victory for Western football over Eastern; it was a triumph of
teacher over student; it was an exciting, freakish affair with the result in
doubt until the final whistle blew.
Withal it was played in the picturesque tradition of the annual East-West
New ear s game with a crowd of 65,000 roasting under a hot southern
California sun.
Individual honors went to Hoffman and Wilton of Stanford. Gibby
Welch, the Panther Ail-American back, played as well as any for the
visitors and his main support came from Booth and Hagan. Hoffman

* converted after Stanford's touch
down and Booth failed after
Pitt's, this marking the margin
of the victory.
Pitt scored first in the third quar
ter when the white helmeted Jimmy
Hagan scooped up a Stanford fumble
and dashed twenty yards to a touch
down. Booth's attempt at goal was
blocked.
Stanford scored its points in the
same quarter. After carrying the ball
the length of the field to within two
yards of the goal line, Sims fumbled,
but the ball was bounced to Wilton,
who carried it five yards to a touch
down.
Kick Means Victory
Hoffman's conversion kick carried
true and meant victory for Stanford
and Coach Pop Warner over Pitt and
Jock Sutherland. "Jock" learned his
football from Warner when the latter
was head mentor at Pitt.
The game was filled with the plays
that made the Warner system known
the country over. In the main, Stan
ford used the double and triple passes
and reverses with more effect than
Pitt. Stanford once resorted to the
"Statue of Liberty" play and often
called a guard around end.
Pitts' Attack Weak
For the most part Pitt's attack
seemed weak. Welch occasionally
broke loose for a ten- or fifteen-yard
gain and Booth did most of the gain
ing on Pitt's best offensive gesture.
More than three quarters of tha
game found the ball in Pitt territory.
Hagan and Hoffman supplied
the crowd with one of the best
punting duels of the season. Both
averaged over 50 yards in send
ing long spirals down the field.
Hoffman did most of the ball
toting for Stanford in addition to
caring for the punting and pass
ing. It was Wilton's fumble which
gave Pitta chance to score but
he later made this up by scoring
himself.
Tricky Dick Hyland, Stanford's
open field runner, played only a short
time during the first half.
Both teams resorted to numerous
passes with only mediocre success.
Neither team was able to register
during the first half although Stanford
showed to a distinct advantage.
Once in the first and again in
the second quarter the Cardinals,
with Hoffman bearing the brunt
of the attack, carried the ball to
the shadow of the goal line.
Pitt stiffened in each instance
and Hagan's beautiful spirals
pushed Stanford back to midfield.
Although both teams tried nu
merous passes only a few were
completed and these had little
effect on the general ground gain
ing.
Pitt's entire attack during this
period consisted of two spectacu
lar dashes by the versatile Welch.
The play was almost entirely in
Pitt territory, the Panthers having
(he ball only once on Stanford ground,
and on that occasion could get no
further than the forty-five-yard line.
Punts Spectacular
Pitt received the kick-off and after
three ineffective attempts to gain,
Hagan punted. It was the first of a
series of long kicks that Hagan was
to get off during the afternoon. The
ball carried fully fifty yards.
After another exchange of
punts, Stanford, with Hoffman
and Hyland carrying the ball,
took the pigskin from the fifty- to
the twenty-five-yard line. Hoffman
made it first down on the fifteen
yard line and then added six
more to the nine-yard line. Pitt
tightened here, however, and the
ball went to Pitt after Hoffman,
Hyland, and Hill had failed to
move it an inch closer to the goal.
When Stanford next obtained pos
session of the ball, it turned to long
passes, Hoffman doing the hurling.
These fell in unoccupied territory, or
were knocked down by Welch. Welch

intercepted one of
the long heaves on
his own tliirty-six
yard line just as
the quarter ended.
Up until that time,
it was the deepest
point in which
Pitt had posses
sion of the ball.
Welch opened
the second quar
ter by running his
own right end for

sixteen yards. Several more plays ad
vanced the ball to the forty-flve-yard
line, Pitt's foremost position since
the start of the game, but here a pass
hurled by Welch was intercepted by
Murphy of Stanford, who returned
from the forty-nine- to the forty-yard
line.
This led to Stanford's second
determined effort to score. Hoff
man dashed seventeen yards to a
first down on the twenty-seven
yard line and Wilton then made
it first down on the seventeen
yard line in two off-tackle
smashes.
Hoffman made four and another
four to the eight-yard line and made
another first down on the six-yard
line. Wilton traveled right end to the
two-yard line. Hoffman attempted to
carry the ball over left guard but was
thrown for a loss and the ball went
to the Panthers.
The ball changed hands often dur
ing the final minutes of the half but
neither team gained much ground.
Apparently refreshed by the rest at
half time, Pitt opened the third quar
ter with its most sustained attack of
the game. With Booth doing most of
the work, the ball was taken to the
twenty-yard line. The Pitt fullback
was stopped there and a pass thrown
by Welch was grounded across the
goal line.
On the next play, Wilton fum
bled a pass from center and the
speedy Jimmy Hagan scooped it
up and ran 20 yards to a touch
down, with the first score of the
game. Booth failed to convert
when Heinecke blocked the kick.
A few minutes later Stanford
took the lead when Hoffman con
verted after Wilton's score.
The play on which Wilton
crossed the goal line must be
rated as one of the freaks of the
season.
With the ball on the Pitt three
yard line, Wilton passed to Sims,
who caught the pigskin and after
running two yards, fumbled. The
ball bounced clear of the pile-up
of players, and to a corner of the

field where Wilton took it on a
high bound and scooted five yards
to a touchdown.
Stanford took the ball from one
goal line to the other in making this
score. The march started when Mur
phy returned Booth's kick-off to the
thirty-five-yard line. Biff Hoffman
dropped back and sent a forty-yard
pass into the arms of Worden, plac
ing the ball on the Pitt thirty-yard
line. Hoffman made it first down on
the twenty-yard line by crashing
through left guard. Wilton, Post, and
Hoffman combined to carry the ball
to the two-yard line, where Wilton
stepped in to score.
The quarter ended immediately
afterward.
Stanford threatened once again
in the final period when Post, on
a guard around end play ran
thirty yards to the Pitt thirty-one
yard line. This run by the big
Stanford linesman was the long
est of the game.
An orgy of passing in the final min
utes failed to give much aid to Pitt.
Stanford's superiority perhaps was
shown best in the first-down tabula
tion. The big Red team made the
necessary ten yards on fourteen oc
casions. Pitt made only seven. Stan
ford registered five first downs in the
first quarter, three in the second, four
in the third, and two in the last.
Pitt's first downs were concen
trated in the third period when it
totalled four. Two came in the first
and one in the second and none in
the last period.
Pitt gained a total of one hundred
and forty-three yards from scrimmage,
while Stanford made two hundred and
forty-one yards.
Stanford, with Hoffman usually
back in punt formation, attempted
twelve passes. Four of these were
completed and netted sixty-five yards.
Pitt tried to pass on fourteen occa
sions but completed only three for a
total of twenty-six yards.
A hot sun poured down on the
players and the 65,000 spectators
throughout the game. Press box deni
zens worked without coats or vests.
This heat seemed to affect the
play of the Easterners, more ac
customed to rainy and cold foot
ball days. The Panthers seemed
to wilt a few minutes after the
beginning of each period. In the
final quarter none of the Pitt

men could get down under the
long, high kicks of Hagan and it
gave Stanford's safety man ample
opportunity to nestle the ball and
start back up the field.

DOSIii BOW L, PASADENA, Jan. 2. —Stanford University, displaying a more
versatile attack, eked out a 7 to G victory over the University of Pitts
burgh in the annual Tournament of Roses contest here today.
It was a victory for Western football over Eastern; it was a triumph of
teacher over student; it was an exciting, freakish affair with the result in
doubt until the final whistle blew.
Withal it was played in the picturesque tradition of the annual East-West
New ear s game with a crowd of 65,000 roasting under a hot southern
California sun.
Individual honors went to Hoffman and Wilton of Stanford. Gibby
Welch, the Panther Ail-American back, played as well as any for the
visitors and his main support came from Booth and Hagan. Hoffman

* converted after Stanford's touch
down and Booth failed after
Pitt's, this marking the margin
of the victory.
Pitt scored first in the third quar
ter when the white helmeted Jimmy
Hagan scooped up a Stanford fumble
and dashed twenty yards to a touch
down. Booth's attempt at goal was
blocked.
Stanford scored its points in the
same quarter. After carrying the ball
the length of the field to within two
yards of the goal line, Sims fumbled,
but the ball was bounced to Wilton,
who carried it five yards to a touch
down.
Kick Means Victory
Hoffman's conversion kick carried
true and meant victory for Stanford
and Coach Pop Warner over Pitt and
Jock Sutherland. "Jock" learned his
football from Warner when the latter
was head mentor at Pitt.
The game was filled with the plays
that made the Warner system known
the country over. In the main, Stan
ford used the double and triple passes
and reverses with more effect than
Pitt. Stanford once resorted to the
"Statue of Liberty" play and often
called a guard around end.
Pitts' Attack Weak
For the most part Pitt's attack
seemed weak. Welch occasionally
broke loose for a ten- or fifteen-yard
gain and Booth did most of the gain
ing on Pitt's best offensive gesture.
More than three quarters of tha
game found the ball in Pitt territory.
Hagan and Hoffman supplied
the crowd with one of the best
punting duels of the season. Both
averaged over 50 yards in send
ing long spirals down the field.
Hoffman did most of the ball
toting for Stanford in addition to
caring for the punting and pass
ing. It was Wilton's fumble which
gave Pitta chance to score but
he later made this up by scoring
himself.
Tricky Dick Hyland, Stanford's
open field runner, played only a short
time during the first half.
Both teams resorted to numerous
passes with only mediocre success.
Neither team was able to register
during the first half although Stanford
showed to a distinct advantage.
Once in the first and again in
the second quarter the Cardinals,
with Hoffman bearing the brunt
of the attack, carried the ball to
the shadow of the goal line.
Pitt stiffened in each instance
and Hagan's beautiful spirals
pushed Stanford back to midfield.
Although both teams tried nu
merous passes only a few were
completed and these had little
effect on the general ground gain
ing.
Pitt's entire attack during this
period consisted of two spectacu
lar dashes by the versatile Welch.
The play was almost entirely in
Pitt territory, the Panthers having
(he ball only once on Stanford ground,
and on that occasion could get no
further than the forty-five-yard line.
Punts Spectacular
Pitt received the kick-off and after
three ineffective attempts to gain,
Hagan punted. It was the first of a
series of long kicks that Hagan was
to get off during the afternoon. The
ball carried fully fifty yards.
After another exchange of
punts, Stanford, with Hoffman
and Hyland carrying the ball,
took the pigskin from the fifty- to
the twenty-five-yard line. Hoffman
made it first down on the fifteen
yard line and then added six
more to the nine-yard line. Pitt
tightened here, however, and the
ball went to Pitt after Hoffman,
Hyland, and Hill had failed to
move it an inch closer to the goal.
When Stanford next obtained pos
session of the ball, it turned to long
passes, Hoffman doing the hurling.
These fell in unoccupied territory, or
were knocked down by Welch. Welch

intercepted one of
the long heaves on
his own tliirty-six
yard line just as
the quarter ended.
Up until that time,
it was the deepest
point in which
Pitt had posses
sion of the ball.
Welch opened
the second quar
ter by running his
own right end for

sixteen yards. Several more plays ad
vanced the ball to the forty-flve-yard
line, Pitt's foremost position since
the start of the game, but here a pass
hurled by Welch was intercepted by
Murphy of Stanford, who returned
from the forty-nine- to the forty-yard
line.
This led to Stanford's second
determined effort to score. Hoff
man dashed seventeen yards to a
first down on the twenty-seven
yard line and Wilton then made
it first down on the seventeen
yard line in two off-tackle
smashes.
Hoffman made four and another
four to the eight-yard line and made
another first down on the six-yard
line. Wilton traveled right end to the
two-yard line. Hoffman attempted to
carry the ball over left guard but was
thrown for a loss and the ball went
to the Panthers.
The ball changed hands often dur
ing the final minutes of the half but
neither team gained much ground.
Apparently refreshed by the rest at
half time, Pitt opened the third quar
ter with its most sustained attack of
the game. With Booth doing most of
the work, the ball was taken to the
twenty-yard line. The Pitt fullback
was stopped there and a pass thrown
by Welch was grounded across the
goal line.
On the next play, Wilton fum
bled a pass from center and the
speedy Jimmy Hagan scooped it
up and ran 20 yards to a touch
down, with the first score of the
game. Booth failed to convert
when Heinecke blocked the kick.
A few minutes later Stanford
took the lead when Hoffman con
verted after Wilton's score.
The play on which Wilton
crossed the goal line must be
rated as one of the freaks of the
season.
With the ball on the Pitt three
yard line, Wilton passed to Sims,
who caught the pigskin and after
running two yards, fumbled. The
ball bounced clear of the pile-up
of players, and to a corner of the

field where Wilton took it on a
high bound and scooted five yards
to a touchdown.
Stanford took the ball from one
goal line to the other in making this
score. The march started when Mur
phy returned Booth's kick-off to the
thirty-five-yard line. Biff Hoffman
dropped back and sent a forty-yard
pass into the arms of Worden, plac
ing the ball on the Pitt thirty-yard
line. Hoffman made it first down on
the twenty-yard line by crashing
through left guard. Wilton, Post, and
Hoffman combined to carry the ball
to the two-yard line, where Wilton
stepped in to score.
The quarter ended immediately
afterward.
Stanford threatened once again
in the final period when Post, on
a guard around end play ran
thirty yards to the Pitt thirty-one
yard line. This run by the big
Stanford linesman was the long
est of the game.
An orgy of passing in the final min
utes failed to give much aid to Pitt.
Stanford's superiority perhaps was
shown best in the first-down tabula
tion. The big Red team made the
necessary ten yards on fourteen oc
casions. Pitt made only seven. Stan
ford registered five first downs in the
first quarter, three in the second, four
in the third, and two in the last.
Pitt's first downs were concen
trated in the third period when it
totalled four. Two came in the first
and one in the second and none in
the last period.
Pitt gained a total of one hundred
and forty-three yards from scrimmage,
while Stanford made two hundred and
forty-one yards.
Stanford, with Hoffman usually
back in punt formation, attempted
twelve passes. Four of these were
completed and netted sixty-five yards.
Pitt tried to pass on fourteen occa
sions but completed only three for a
total of twenty-six yards.
A hot sun poured down on the
players and the 65,000 spectators
throughout the game. Press box deni
zens worked without coats or vests.
This heat seemed to affect the
play of the Easterners, more ac
customed to rainy and cold foot
ball days. The Panthers seemed
to wilt a few minutes after the
beginning of each period. In the
final quarter none of the Pitt

men could get down under the
long, high kicks of Hagan and it
gave Stanford's safety man ample
opportunity to nestle the ball and
start back up the field.

DOSIii BOW L, PASADENA, Jan. 2. —Stanford University, displaying a more
versatile attack, eked out a 7 to G victory over the University of Pitts
burgh in the annual Tournament of Roses contest here today.
It was a victory for Western football over Eastern; it was a triumph of
teacher over student; it was an exciting, freakish affair with the result in
doubt until the final whistle blew.
Withal it was played in the picturesque tradition of the annual East-West
New ear s game with a crowd of 65,000 roasting under a hot southern
California sun.
Individual honors went to Hoffman and Wilton of Stanford. Gibby
Welch, the Panther Ail-American back, played as well as any for the
visitors and his main support came from Booth and Hagan. Hoffman

* converted after Stanford's touch
down and Booth failed after
Pitt's, this marking the margin
of the victory.
Pitt scored first in the third quar
ter when the white helmeted Jimmy
Hagan scooped up a Stanford fumble
and dashed twenty yards to a touch
down. Booth's attempt at goal was
blocked.
Stanford scored its points in the
same quarter. After carrying the ball
the length of the field to within two
yards of the goal line, Sims fumbled,
but the ball was bounced to Wilton,
who carried it five yards to a touch
down.
Kick Means Victory
Hoffman's conversion kick carried
true and meant victory for Stanford
and Coach Pop Warner over Pitt and
Jock Sutherland. "Jock" learned his
football from Warner when the latter
was head mentor at Pitt.
The game was filled with the plays
that made the Warner system known
the country over. In the main, Stan
ford used the double and triple passes
and reverses with more effect than
Pitt. Stanford once resorted to the
"Statue of Liberty" play and often
called a guard around end.
Pitts' Attack Weak
For the most part Pitt's attack
seemed weak. Welch occasionally
broke loose for a ten- or fifteen-yard
gain and Booth did most of the gain
ing on Pitt's best offensive gesture.
More than three quarters of tha
game found the ball in Pitt territory.
Hagan and Hoffman supplied
the crowd with one of the best
punting duels of the season. Both
averaged over 50 yards in send
ing long spirals down the field.
Hoffman did most of the ball
toting for Stanford in addition to
caring for the punting and pass
ing. It was Wilton's fumble which
gave Pitta chance to score but
he later made this up by scoring
himself.
Tricky Dick Hyland, Stanford's
open field runner, played only a short
time during the first half.
Both teams resorted to numerous
passes with only mediocre success.
Neither team was able to register
during the first half although Stanford
showed to a distinct advantage.
Once in the first and again in
the second quarter the Cardinals,
with Hoffman bearing the brunt
of the attack, carried the ball to
the shadow of the goal line.
Pitt stiffened in each instance
and Hagan's beautiful spirals
pushed Stanford back to midfield.
Although both teams tried nu
merous passes only a few were
completed and these had little
effect on the general ground gain
ing.
Pitt's entire attack during this
period consisted of two spectacu
lar dashes by the versatile Welch.
The play was almost entirely in
Pitt territory, the Panthers having
(he ball only once on Stanford ground,
and on that occasion could get no
further than the forty-five-yard line.
Punts Spectacular
Pitt received the kick-off and after
three ineffective attempts to gain,
Hagan punted. It was the first of a
series of long kicks that Hagan was
to get off during the afternoon. The
ball carried fully fifty yards.
After another exchange of
punts, Stanford, with Hoffman
and Hyland carrying the ball,
took the pigskin from the fifty- to
the twenty-five-yard line. Hoffman
made it first down on the fifteen
yard line and then added six
more to the nine-yard line. Pitt
tightened here, however, and the
ball went to Pitt after Hoffman,
Hyland, and Hill had failed to
move it an inch closer to the goal.
When Stanford next obtained pos
session of the ball, it turned to long
passes, Hoffman doing the hurling.
These fell in unoccupied territory, or
were knocked down by Welch. Welch

intercepted one of
the long heaves on
his own tliirty-six
yard line just as
the quarter ended.
Up until that time,
it was the deepest
point in which
Pitt had posses
sion of the ball.
Welch opened
the second quar
ter by running his
own right end for

sixteen yards. Several more plays ad
vanced the ball to the forty-flve-yard
line, Pitt's foremost position since
the start of the game, but here a pass
hurled by Welch was intercepted by
Murphy of Stanford, who returned
from the forty-nine- to the forty-yard
line.
This led to Stanford's second
determined effort to score. Hoff
man dashed seventeen yards to a
first down on the twenty-seven
yard line and Wilton then made
it first down on the seventeen
yard line in two off-tackle
smashes.
Hoffman made four and another
four to the eight-yard line and made
another first down on the six-yard
line. Wilton traveled right end to the
two-yard line. Hoffman attempted to
carry the ball over left guard but was
thrown for a loss and the ball went
to the Panthers.
The ball changed hands often dur
ing the final minutes of the half but
neither team gained much ground.
Apparently refreshed by the rest at
half time, Pitt opened the third quar
ter with its most sustained attack of
the game. With Booth doing most of
the work, the ball was taken to the
twenty-yard line. The Pitt fullback
was stopped there and a pass thrown
by Welch was grounded across the
goal line.
On the next play, Wilton fum
bled a pass from center and the
speedy Jimmy Hagan scooped it
up and ran 20 yards to a touch
down, with the first score of the
game. Booth failed to convert
when Heinecke blocked the kick.
A few minutes later Stanford
took the lead when Hoffman con
verted after Wilton's score.
The play on which Wilton
crossed the goal line must be
rated as one of the freaks of the
season.
With the ball on the Pitt three
yard line, Wilton passed to Sims,
who caught the pigskin and after
running two yards, fumbled. The
ball bounced clear of the pile-up
of players, and to a corner of the

field where Wilton took it on a
high bound and scooted five yards
to a touchdown.
Stanford took the ball from one
goal line to the other in making this
score. The march started when Mur
phy returned Booth's kick-off to the
thirty-five-yard line. Biff Hoffman
dropped back and sent a forty-yard
pass into the arms of Worden, plac
ing the ball on the Pitt thirty-yard
line. Hoffman made it first down on
the twenty-yard line by crashing
through left guard. Wilton, Post, and
Hoffman combined to carry the ball
to the two-yard line, where Wilton
stepped in to score.
The quarter ended immediately
afterward.
Stanford threatened once again
in the final period when Post, on
a guard around end play ran
thirty yards to the Pitt thirty-one
yard line. This run by the big
Stanford linesman was the long
est of the game.
An orgy of passing in the final min
utes failed to give much aid to Pitt.
Stanford's superiority perhaps was
shown best in the first-down tabula
tion. The big Red team made the
necessary ten yards on fourteen oc
casions. Pitt made only seven. Stan
ford registered five first downs in the
first quarter, three in the second, four
in the third, and two in the last.
Pitt's first downs were concen
trated in the third period when it
totalled four. Two came in the first
and one in the second and none in
the last period.
Pitt gained a total of one hundred
and forty-three yards from scrimmage,
while Stanford made two hundred and
forty-one yards.
Stanford, with Hoffman usually
back in punt formation, attempted
twelve passes. Four of these were
completed and netted sixty-five yards.
Pitt tried to pass on fourteen occa
sions but completed only three for a
total of twenty-six yards.
A hot sun poured down on the
players and the 65,000 spectators
throughout the game. Press box deni
zens worked without coats or vests.
This heat seemed to affect the
play of the Easterners, more ac
customed to rainy and cold foot
ball days. The Panthers seemed
to wilt a few minutes after the
beginning of each period. In the
final quarter none of the Pitt

men could get down under the
long, high kicks of Hagan and it
gave Stanford's safety man ample
opportunity to nestle the ball and
start back up the field.

DOSIii BOW L, PASADENA, Jan. 2. —Stanford University, displaying a more
versatile attack, eked out a 7 to G victory over the University of Pitts
burgh in the annual Tournament of Roses contest here today.
It was a victory for Western football over Eastern; it was a triumph of
teacher over student; it was an exciting, freakish affair with the result in
doubt until the final whistle blew.
Withal it was played in the picturesque tradition of the annual East-West
New ear s game with a crowd of 65,000 roasting under a hot southern
California sun.
Individual honors went to Hoffman and Wilton of Stanford. Gibby
Welch, the Panther Ail-American back, played as well as any for the
visitors and his main support came from Booth and Hagan. Hoffman

* converted after Stanford's touch
down and Booth failed after
Pitt's, this marking the margin
of the victory.
Pitt scored first in the third quar
ter when the white helmeted Jimmy
Hagan scooped up a Stanford fumble
and dashed twenty yards to a touch
down. Booth's attempt at goal was
blocked.
Stanford scored its points in the
same quarter. After carrying the ball
the length of the field to within two
yards of the goal line, Sims fumbled,
but the ball was bounced to Wilton,
who carried it five yards to a touch
down.
Kick Means Victory
Hoffman's conversion kick carried
true and meant victory for Stanford
and Coach Pop Warner over Pitt and
Jock Sutherland. "Jock" learned his
football from Warner when the latter
was head mentor at Pitt.
The game was filled with the plays
that made the Warner system known
the country over. In the main, Stan
ford used the double and triple passes
and reverses with more effect than
Pitt. Stanford once resorted to the
"Statue of Liberty" play and often
called a guard around end.
Pitts' Attack Weak
For the most part Pitt's attack
seemed weak. Welch occasionally
broke loose for a ten- or fifteen-yard
gain and Booth did most of the gain
ing on Pitt's best offensive gesture.
More than three quarters of tha
game found the ball in Pitt territory.
Hagan and Hoffman supplied
the crowd with one of the best
punting duels of the season. Both
averaged over 50 yards in send
ing long spirals down the field.
Hoffman did most of the ball
toting for Stanford in addition to
caring for the punting and pass
ing. It was Wilton's fumble which
gave Pitta chance to score but
he later made this up by scoring
himself.
Tricky Dick Hyland, Stanford's
open field runner, played only a short
time during the first half.
Both teams resorted to numerous
passes with only mediocre success.
Neither team was able to register
during the first half although Stanford
showed to a distinct advantage.
Once in the first and again in
the second quarter the Cardinals,
with Hoffman bearing the brunt
of the attack, carried the ball to
the shadow of the goal line.
Pitt stiffened in each instance
and Hagan's beautiful spirals
pushed Stanford back to midfield.
Although both teams tried nu
merous passes only a few were
completed and these had little
effect on the general ground gain
ing.
Pitt's entire attack during this
period consisted of two spectacu
lar dashes by the versatile Welch.
The play was almost entirely in
Pitt territory, the Panthers having
(he ball only once on Stanford ground,
and on that occasion could get no
further than the forty-five-yard line.
Punts Spectacular
Pitt received the kick-off and after
three ineffective attempts to gain,
Hagan punted. It was the first of a
series of long kicks that Hagan was
to get off during the afternoon. The
ball carried fully fifty yards.
After another exchange of
punts, Stanford, with Hoffman
and Hyland carrying the ball,
took the pigskin from the fifty- to
the twenty-five-yard line. Hoffman
made it first down on the fifteen
yard line and then added six
more to the nine-yard line. Pitt
tightened here, however, and the
ball went to Pitt after Hoffman,
Hyland, and Hill had failed to
move it an inch closer to the goal.
When Stanford next obtained pos
session of the ball, it turned to long
passes, Hoffman doing the hurling.
These fell in unoccupied territory, or
were knocked down by Welch. Welch

intercepted one of
the long heaves on
his own tliirty-six
yard line just as
the quarter ended.
Up until that time,
it was the deepest
point in which
Pitt had posses
sion of the ball.
Welch opened
the second quar
ter by running his
own right end for

sixteen yards. Several more plays ad
vanced the ball to the forty-flve-yard
line, Pitt's foremost position since
the start of the game, but here a pass
hurled by Welch was intercepted by
Murphy of Stanford, who returned
from the forty-nine- to the forty-yard
line.
This led to Stanford's second
determined effort to score. Hoff
man dashed seventeen yards to a
first down on the twenty-seven
yard line and Wilton then made
it first down on the seventeen
yard line in two off-tackle
smashes.
Hoffman made four and another
four to the eight-yard line and made
another first down on the six-yard
line. Wilton traveled right end to the
two-yard line. Hoffman attempted to
carry the ball over left guard but was
thrown for a loss and the ball went
to the Panthers.
The ball changed hands often dur
ing the final minutes of the half but
neither team gained much ground.
Apparently refreshed by the rest at
half time, Pitt opened the third quar
ter with its most sustained attack of
the game. With Booth doing most of
the work, the ball was taken to the
twenty-yard line. The Pitt fullback
was stopped there and a pass thrown
by Welch was grounded across the
goal line.
On the next play, Wilton fum
bled a pass from center and the
speedy Jimmy Hagan scooped it
up and ran 20 yards to a touch
down, with the first score of the
game. Booth failed to convert
when Heinecke blocked the kick.
A few minutes later Stanford
took the lead when Hoffman con
verted after Wilton's score.
The play on which Wilton
crossed the goal line must be
rated as one of the freaks of the
season.
With the ball on the Pitt three
yard line, Wilton passed to Sims,
who caught the pigskin and after
running two yards, fumbled. The
ball bounced clear of the pile-up
of players, and to a corner of the

field where Wilton took it on a
high bound and scooted five yards
to a touchdown.
Stanford took the ball from one
goal line to the other in making this
score. The march started when Mur
phy returned Booth's kick-off to the
thirty-five-yard line. Biff Hoffman
dropped back and sent a forty-yard
pass into the arms of Worden, plac
ing the ball on the Pitt thirty-yard
line. Hoffman made it first down on
the twenty-yard line by crashing
through left guard. Wilton, Post, and
Hoffman combined to carry the ball
to the two-yard line, where Wilton
stepped in to score.
The quarter ended immediately
afterward.
Stanford threatened once again
in the final period when Post, on
a guard around end play ran
thirty yards to the Pitt thirty-one
yard line. This run by the big
Stanford linesman was the long
est of the game.
An orgy of passing in the final min
utes failed to give much aid to Pitt.
Stanford's superiority perhaps was
shown best in the first-down tabula
tion. The big Red team made the
necessary ten yards on fourteen oc
casions. Pitt made only seven. Stan
ford registered five first downs in the
first quarter, three in the second, four
in the third, and two in the last.
Pitt's first downs were concen
trated in the third period when it
totalled four. Two came in the first
and one in the second and none in
the last period.
Pitt gained a total of one hundred
and forty-three yards from scrimmage,
while Stanford made two hundred and
forty-one yards.
Stanford, with Hoffman usually
back in punt formation, attempted
twelve passes. Four of these were
completed and netted sixty-five yards.
Pitt tried to pass on fourteen occa
sions but completed only three for a
total of twenty-six yards.
A hot sun poured down on the
players and the 65,000 spectators
throughout the game. Press box deni
zens worked without coats or vests.
This heat seemed to affect the
play of the Easterners, more ac
customed to rainy and cold foot
ball days. The Panthers seemed
to wilt a few minutes after the
beginning of each period. In the
final quarter none of the Pitt

men could get down under the
long, high kicks of Hagan and it
gave Stanford's safety man ample
opportunity to nestle the ball and
start back up the field.

United Press Staff Correspondent j
DOSIii BOW L, PASADENA, Jan. 2. —Stanford University, displaying a more
versatile attack, eked out a 7 to G victory over the University of Pitts
burgh in the annual Tournament of Roses contest here today.
It was a victory for Western football over Eastern; it was a triumph of
teacher over student; it was an exciting, freakish affair with the result in
doubt until the final whistle blew.
Withal it was played in the picturesque tradition of the annual East-West
New ear s game with a crowd of 65,000 roasting under a hot southern
California sun.
Individual honors went to Hoffman and Wilton of Stanford. Gibby
Welch, the Panther Ail-American back, played as well as any for the
visitors and his main support came from Booth and Hagan. Hoffman

* converted after Stanford's touch
down and Booth failed after
Pitt's, this marking the margin
of the victory.
Pitt scored first in the third quar
ter when the white helmeted Jimmy
Hagan scooped up a Stanford fumble
and dashed twenty yards to a touch
down. Booth's attempt at goal was
blocked.
Stanford scored its points in the
same quarter. After carrying the ball
the length of the field to within two
yards of the goal line, Sims fumbled,
but the ball was bounced to Wilton,
who carried it five yards to a touch
down.
Kick Means Victory
Hoffman's conversion kick carried
true and meant victory for Stanford
and Coach Pop Warner over Pitt and
Jock Sutherland. "Jock" learned his
football from Warner when the latter
was head mentor at Pitt.
The game was filled with the plays
that made the Warner system known
the country over. In the main, Stan
ford used the double and triple passes
and reverses with more effect than
Pitt. Stanford once resorted to the
"Statue of Liberty" play and often
called a guard around end.
Pitts' Attack Weak
For the most part Pitt's attack
seemed weak. Welch occasionally
broke loose for a ten- or fifteen-yard
gain and Booth did most of the gain
ing on Pitt's best offensive gesture.
More than three quarters of tha
game found the ball in Pitt territory.
Hagan and Hoffman supplied
the crowd with one of the best
punting duels of the season. Both
averaged over 50 yards in send
ing long spirals down the field.
Hoffman did most of the ball
toting for Stanford in addition to
caring for the punting and pass
ing. It was Wilton's fumble which
gave Pitta chance to score but
he later made this up by scoring
himself.
Tricky Dick Hyland, Stanford's
open field runner, played only a short
time during the first half.
Both teams resorted to numerous
passes with only mediocre success.
Neither team was able to register
during the first half although Stanford
showed to a distinct advantage.
Once in the first and again in
the second quarter the Cardinals,
with Hoffman bearing the brunt
of the attack, carried the ball to
the shadow of the goal line.
Pitt stiffened in each instance
and Hagan's beautiful spirals
pushed Stanford back to midfield.
Although both teams tried nu
merous passes only a few were
completed and these had little
effect on the general ground gain
ing.
Pitt's entire attack during this
period consisted of two spectacu
lar dashes by the versatile Welch.
The play was almost entirely in
Pitt territory, the Panthers having
(he ball only once on Stanford ground,
and on that occasion could get no
further than the forty-five-yard line.
Punts Spectacular
Pitt received the kick-off and after
three ineffective attempts to gain,
Hagan punted. It was the first of a
series of long kicks that Hagan was
to get off during the afternoon. The
ball carried fully fifty yards.
After another exchange of
punts, Stanford, with Hoffman
and Hyland carrying the ball,
took the pigskin from the fifty- to
the twenty-five-yard line. Hoffman
made it first down on the fifteen
yard line and then added six
more to the nine-yard line. Pitt
tightened here, however, and the
ball went to Pitt after Hoffman,
Hyland, and Hill had failed to
move it an inch closer to the goal.
When Stanford next obtained pos
session of the ball, it turned to long
passes, Hoffman doing the hurling.
These fell in unoccupied territory, or
were knocked down by Welch. Welch

intercepted one of
the long heaves on
his own tliirty-six
yard line just as
the quarter ended.
Up until that time,
it was the deepest
point in which
Pitt had posses
sion of the ball.
Welch opened
the second quar
ter by running his
own right end for

sixteen yards. Several more plays ad
vanced the ball to the forty-flve-yard
line, Pitt's foremost position since
the start of the game, but here a pass
hurled by Welch was intercepted by
Murphy of Stanford, who returned
from the forty-nine- to the forty-yard
line.
This led to Stanford's second
determined effort to score. Hoff
man dashed seventeen yards to a
first down on the twenty-seven
yard line and Wilton then made
it first down on the seventeen
yard line in two off-tackle
smashes.
Hoffman made four and another
four to the eight-yard line and made
another first down on the six-yard
line. Wilton traveled right end to the
two-yard line. Hoffman attempted to
carry the ball over left guard but was
thrown for a loss and the ball went
to the Panthers.
The ball changed hands often dur
ing the final minutes of the half but
neither team gained much ground.
Apparently refreshed by the rest at
half time, Pitt opened the third quar
ter with its most sustained attack of
the game. With Booth doing most of
the work, the ball was taken to the
twenty-yard line. The Pitt fullback
was stopped there and a pass thrown
by Welch was grounded across the
goal line.
On the next play, Wilton fum
bled a pass from center and the
speedy Jimmy Hagan scooped it
up and ran 20 yards to a touch
down, with the first score of the
game. Booth failed to convert
when Heinecke blocked the kick.
A few minutes later Stanford
took the lead when Hoffman con
verted after Wilton's score.
The play on which Wilton
crossed the goal line must be
rated as one of the freaks of the
season.
With the ball on the Pitt three
yard line, Wilton passed to Sims,
who caught the pigskin and after
running two yards, fumbled. The
ball bounced clear of the pile-up
of players, and to a corner of the

field where Wilton took it on a
high bound and scooted five yards
to a touchdown.
Stanford took the ball from one
goal line to the other in making this
score. The march started when Mur
phy returned Booth's kick-off to the
thirty-five-yard line. Biff Hoffman
dropped back and sent a forty-yard
pass into the arms of Worden, plac
ing the ball on the Pitt thirty-yard
line. Hoffman made it first down on
the twenty-yard line by crashing
through left guard. Wilton, Post, and
Hoffman combined to carry the ball
to the two-yard line, where Wilton
stepped in to score.
The quarter ended immediately
afterward.
Stanford threatened once again
in the final period when Post, on
a guard around end play ran
thirty yards to the Pitt thirty-one
yard line. This run by the big
Stanford linesman was the long
est of the game.
An orgy of passing in the final min
utes failed to give much aid to Pitt.
Stanford's superiority perhaps was
shown best in the first-down tabula
tion. The big Red team made the
necessary ten yards on fourteen oc
casions. Pitt made only seven. Stan
ford registered five first downs in the
first quarter, three in the second, four
in the third, and two in the last.
Pitt's first downs were concen
trated in the third period when it
totalled four. Two came in the first
and one in the second and none in
the last period.
Pitt gained a total of one hundred
and forty-three yards from scrimmage,
while Stanford made two hundred and
forty-one yards.
Stanford, with Hoffman usually
back in punt formation, attempted
twelve passes. Four of these were
completed and netted sixty-five yards.
Pitt tried to pass on fourteen occa
sions but completed only three for a
total of twenty-six yards.
A hot sun poured down on the
players and the 65,000 spectators
throughout the game. Press box deni
zens worked without coats or vests.
This heat seemed to affect the
play of the Easterners, more ac
customed to rainy and cold foot
ball days. The Panthers seemed
to wilt a few minutes after the
beginning of each period. In the
final quarter none of the Pitt

men could get down under the
long, high kicks of Hagan and it
gave Stanford's safety man ample
opportunity to nestle the ball and
start back up the field.
