## 
### 
Displaying their best form of the
season, the University of California
eleven defeated Andy Kerr's Pennsyl
vania team in the California Memorial
Stadium last Saturday by the decisive
score of 27 to 13. The small crowd
that attended the game was treated
to the most spectacular contest waged
in the bay district this season.
Before the game a tribute was paid
to the memory of Andy Smith, late
California coach, and a memorial
bench was unveiled.
Coach "Nibs" Price used offensive
tactics from the beginning of the
contest, and except for the second
quarter, the Bears were complete
masters of the field. After a California
touchdown In the first period, Penn
came back with two tallies in the
second to end the half 13-7 in their
favor.
Using a maximum of deception
plays California started scoring again
in the third quarter when a double
pass, Clymer to Perrin to Eisan, fol
lowed by a 34-yard run by the latter,
tied the score 13-13. The offensive
drive of the Bears from this point
proved to be too much for the be
fuddled Easterners.
Beginning the fourth quarter, Mar
cus went 55 yards through right
tackle for a touchdown on the first
play. California gained some yards
on an interchange of punts, then
Phillips of the Bears intercepted
Murphy's pass and was downed on
Penn's 22-yard line. Marcus fumbled
a pass which gave Penn the ball on
her own 10'-yard line. Penn took to
the air, but Eisan intercepted Sho
ber's pass.
Unexpected plays, furnishing many
thrills, finally found the Californians
on the 1-yard line. Pennsylvania held
Marcus twice, but on his third at
tempt Marcus circled right end for
the last touchdown. California con
verted. The ball was deep in Penn
territory for the remainder of the
game.
