# In the Wake of the News
## 
### 
During the past several weeks public attention has been centered
upon several events of importance which have given rise to an increase
in discussion of several controversial questions. The Hickman case, for
example, at first silenced temporarily the advocates of abolition of the
death penalty. Now that the first shock of the crime has worn away one
hears again from those who believe that the death penalty is "barbarous''
and that "it does not work satisfactorily.''
The indications that the insanity defense will be used in this case
brings another question of public concern into the limelight. The pre
sumption that in time science will learn to cure insanity, couplcd with
the attitude tha persons are "forced into crime," forms the chief strength
of the arguments of those who compare what they delight to term "legal
murder." Yet we continue to believe with those who maintain that there
have been, are, and will continue to be, cases which merit the death
penalty for protection of society and punishment for society's portection
and punishment. The suggestion, too, tha at national police force be in
stituted is well worth considering. Crime is no longer local.
Consider the discussion which the S-4 submarine disaster has raised.
Its effects have perhaps been more varied than any similar peacetime
disaster in the branches of the service. Some extremists have urged that
the submarine be made an outlawed weapon of warfare (fancy that!).
To silence that argument a couple of years ago some seventy Japanese
sailors, imprisoned in one of Japan's submarines in a collision similar
to the S-4 disaster, tapped out the request that their deaths, which
they knew would be certain, have no effect in retarding the progress of
the navy along the line of developing the modern submarine.
Perhaps the most constructive suggestion offered to the Navy officials
is that United States submarines be henceforth equipped with large rings
along the sides to facilitate quick raising of a disabled sub-surface boat.
This device was proved practical some time ago when a German U-boat,
rammed while at Kiel, was raised in short order.
The close of the year 1927 brought more to the public than the
Christmas holidays!
