victory came as an upset to predictions, betting odds, and ''dope" in

I tow much money Stanford will receive from the game is not known
but it can be safely said that two good football teams through their
playing yeserday afternoon added materially to the finances of their
respective institutions. Of such stuff is present-day football made —vic-
tories, losses, and checks.
