Curran: "Balieff's Chauve-Souris."
This is undoubtedly one of the best
shows that has come to San Francisco
for some time, and better tiian may
be expected will come for some time 1
in the future. From every angle—dra
matic, technical, musical —it is so far
above the average that you are at loss
for comparatives. There are twenty
one acts on the program, but they are j
run through with such alacrity that;
you are anxious for more, and you,
leave the theatre babbling incoherent i
superlatives—all quite inadequate. In
fact you run out of adjectives and
explanations by the third act.
The program is arranged with an
eye to variety of effect, and is emi-!
nently successful in this way. From
the lyrical beauty of such dances as j
the Watteau fan, and the porcelain
figurines, to the broad humor of the
Sultana's abduction or "Surgery," the |
gamut of effects is run. It is interest-;
ing to notice how many of the skits
of the Chauve-Souris have been fur-1
nishing the ideas for college stunts j

for some years, as, for example, the
replicas of "Where is my Meyer," on
our own campus.
"The Parade of the Wooden Sol
diers" is the only number encored
on the program, so it is wise to save
your applause for it. The act quite
lives up to its reputation, and the
droll little soldiers are irresistible. By
the way, the program has been shifted
out of the order on the printed pro
grams, so do not be alarmed if this
feature is not presented in the order
scheduled.
Aside from such well-known fa
vorites as "Katinka," and the "Abduc
tion from Seragalia," the "Song of
the Black Hussars" is one of the most
beautiful numbers on the program.
But it is as hard to pick out the best
act on the program as to find aiKextra
Big Game ticket three hours before
the game. The Curran is advertising
the Chauve-Souris for only three
weeks, so a word to the wise should
be sufficient. Line forming at the box
office now! —H.J.K.

of the Chauve-Souris have been fur-1
nishing the ideas for college stunts j

for some years, as, for example, the
replicas of "Where is my Meyer," on
our own campus.
"The Parade of the Wooden Sol
diers" is the only number encored
on the program, so it is wise to save
your applause for it. The act quite
lives up to its reputation, and the
droll little soldiers are irresistible. By
the way, the program has been shifted
out of the order on the printed pro
grams, so do not be alarmed if this
feature is not presented in the order
scheduled.
Aside from such well-known fa
vorites as "Katinka," and the "Abduc
tion from Seragalia," the "Song of
the Black Hussars" is one of the most
beautiful numbers on the program.
But it is as hard to pick out the best
act on the program as to find aiKextra
Big Game ticket three hours before
the game. The Curran is advertising
the Chauve-Souris for only three
weeks, so a word to the wise should
be sufficient. Line forming at the box
office now! —H.J.K.
Curran: "Balieff's Chauve-Souris."
This is undoubtedly one of the best
shows that has come to San Francisco
for some time, and better tiian may
be expected will come for some time 1
in the future. From every angle—dra
matic, technical, musical —it is so far
above the average that you are at loss
for comparatives. There are twenty
one acts on the program, but they are j
run through with such alacrity that;
you are anxious for more, and you,
leave the theatre babbling incoherent i
superlatives—all quite inadequate. In
fact you run out of adjectives and
explanations by the third act.
The program is arranged with an
eye to variety of effect, and is emi-!
nently successful in this way. From
the lyrical beauty of such dances as j
the Watteau fan, and the porcelain
figurines, to the broad humor of the
Sultana's abduction or "Surgery," the |
gamut of effects is run. It is interest-;
ing to notice how many of the skits
of the Chauve-Souris have been fur-1
nishing the ideas for college stunts j

for some years, as, for example, the
replicas of "Where is my Meyer," on
our own campus.
