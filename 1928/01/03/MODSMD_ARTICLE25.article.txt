(This is one of a scries of features about col
legions in the motion picture industry. Material
obtained for the Stanford Daily.)
Away from bourgeoisie Hollywood,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is easily distin
guished as the most important studio
in Culver City. "More stars than there
are in heaven," the publicity depart
ment shrieks. Many of the "ne plus
ultra" do emote here, although not
truly as many as you can see on the
milky way.
Just recall "Ben Hur," "The Big
Parade," Flesh and the Devil." Then
think of Norma Shearer, John Gilbert,
Ramon Novarro, Lillian Gish, Marion
Davies, Lon Chaney, Conrad Nagel,
Eleanor Boardman, Antonio Moreno,
Joan Crawford —but there, that's
enough for a sample. Now you see
why M.-G.-M. has a lot worth paying
a visit?
College Men Rate
I wouldn't boast for anything, but
in all fairness it does seem that col
lege graduates rank ace-high here.
Behind the megaphones are the men
who make a film good or bad. Uphold
ing this company's high average are
John Robertson, of Western Univer
sity; Clarence Brown, of the Univer
sity of Tennessee; Robert Z. Leon
ard, of the University of Colorado;
John McCarthy, of St. Ignatius Col
lege (San Francisco); William Nigh,
of the University of California; Ed
ward Sedgwick, of St. Mary's Univer
sity (Texas); and Victor Seastrom of
Upsala University (Sweden). Rex
Ingram, who produced "The Four
Horsemen" and many other great
dramas since then, is a Yale man.
He prefers to work in Europe, and
hence does all of his work in France.
Education Invaluable
"College is more than worth-while,
it is invaluable for a movie career,"
Clarence Brown told me one day.(He
directed "Flesh and the Devil" and
has just completed another big spe
cial, "The Trail of '98.")
It was as an engineer that Brown
became interested in pictures. "I be
lieve that my course at the University
of Tennessee helps me to think logi
cally in many a tough problem of film
narration. Of course, I don't use en
gineering to make pictures, but the
discipline of having mastered the
facts of science is a mental governor
of the brain." University critics take
notice!
Many of the stars on this lot are
collegians. Four are ex-Englishmen—
Ralph Forbes, from Denstone College;
George K. Arthur, from Rugby Col
lege; Huntley Gordon, from Bannister
Court School, all in England proper;
and Lew Cody, who took an M.D. de
gree at McGill College, in Canada.
Lars Hanson attended the Royal
Dramatic School in Sweden, Maurice
Kains comes from Pennsylvania
State .Edward Connelly and Tim Mc-
Coy both were students in Chicago,
the former at the Jesuit College and
McCoy at St. Ignatius College.
Gilbert Prep Student
The two leading sheiks of the lot,
John Gilbert and William Haines, only
got as near to college as prep schools.
Gilbert went to Hitchcock Military j
Academy in San Rafael, while Bill
presumably studied at Staunton Mili- j
tary Academy in Viginia. Perhaps ;
they learned about women there —you j
know these prep school boys!

Because Conrad Nagel served as ]
the actors' spokesman and saved the j
stellar salaries when the big cuts j
were threatened recently, all the play
ers idolize him. His bachelor of ora
tory degree from Highland Park Col
lege, Des Moines, may have helped
him frame the eloquent and winning
arguments.
Nagel assured me that he would 1
not trade a college education for any- j
thing else in life, "because it fur-j
nishes a set of mental calisthenics j
that builds up mentality, and because j
it stores away a fund of knowledge j
to be drawn in many an emergency."
Gish Attended Ursuline
Very few actresses have gone to
college, but 1 found four at this studio
who did. Lillian Gish attended Ursu
line Seminary in Massillon, Ohio, Dor
othy Sebastian hails from the Univer-1
sity of Alabama, Gwen Lee from j
Brownell Hall, Omaha. Aileen Pringlo
the only honest-to-Astor society lady
to succeed as a movie queen, received
her chic at the Sacred Heart in Paris.
Albert Lewin, of Kansas and Colum
bia universities, and Waldemar Young !
from our own Stanford, are outstand- j
ing in the M.-G.-M. scenario depart- j
ment. Young has written such hits |
as Mary Pickford's "Dorothy Vernon j
of Haddon Hall" and Lon Chaney's |
"The Road to Mandalay," "The Un-1
known," and"The Hypnotist."
Young Is Stanford Man
When 1 questioned him as to the !
value of his college work. Young said,
"I shall always feel that I owe a lot j
to my course at Stanford. In the first j
place, it introduced me to literature, I
the tool of the writers' craft. Aside

from that the mental discipline fits
any man better for his calling. A col- j
lege education is every day becoming j
more and more invaluable in every
line of human endeavor."
M.-G.-M. was filming its big college ,
picture—the only one on this season's
schedule —"The Fair Co-ed" when I
was 'nosing around' the lot. I think it's
the cleverest of its kind since "Brown
of Harvard." Marion Davies is the
star, Pomona College the background,
and Johnny Mack Brown, All-Ameri- j

Mayer Tells Policy
If you want to know Metro-Goldwyn- j
Mayer's policy toward collegians, hark
to what Louis B. Mayer, vice-president
in charge of production, said when I ;
crashed his office for an interview for
the Daily.
"The value of the college-trained ;
man or woman in the picture indus
try is every day becoming more ap- j
predated. The action of the Academy j
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences I
in recognizing and co-operating with
the motion picture courses at Colum-!
bia and Harvard shows plainly the j
full recognition of the value to us of ;
trained college workers.
"This industry, like any other great |
industry, welcomes such workers, !
whether as actors, scenarists, writers, I
or technicians.
College Men Run F. 8.0.
Whisking from one of the very
largest to one of the smaller produc
ing companies, I found that college
graduates were in control at the Film
Booking Offices place of business.
This organization has few stars and
directors under regular contract, pre
ferring to borrow them for single pic
tures from the bigger companies. But
their executives and writers are alum- j
ni of our best universities, and it is
due to their efforts that F. 8.0. is
going forward so rapidly.
Joseph P. Kennedy, the president, |
was a member of the class of 1912 at
Harvard. William Leßaron, vice-presi
dent in charge of production, entered 1
the University of Chicago but gradu-1
ated from New York University in
'04. John Stuart Twist, head of the
reading department, received his di

ploma from the University of Chi- j
cago in 1921. Jack Votion, casting di- j
rector, completed his work at the Uni-!
versity of Brussels the same year.
In the scenario department I met
Joseph Jefferson O'Neill, formerly of ■
(he New York World, and an alumnus j
of St. Joseph's College in Philadel- j

writer, was a member of the class of;
'23 at the University of California. j

Joseph Sill, Jr., who left the Quad !

enormous salary for his services in
"One Minute to Play." With these I
two college pictures to its credit,!

College Men Run F. 8.0.
Whisking from one of the very
largest to one of the smaller produc
ing companies, I found that college
graduates were in control at the Film
Booking Offices place of business.
This organization has few stars and
directors under regular contract, pre
ferring to borrow them for single pic
tures from the bigger companies. But
their executives and writers are alum- j
ni of our best universities, and it is
due to their efforts that F. 8.0. is
going forward so rapidly.

Joseph Sill, Jr., who left the Quad !
as a junior in '25, is one of F.8.0.'s

Away from bourgeoisie Hollywood,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is easily distin

in Culver City. "More stars than there

ment shrieks. Many of the "ne plus

truly as many as you can see on the
milky way.
Just recall "Ben Hur," "The Big

think of Norma Shearer, John Gilbert,
Ramon Novarro, Lillian Gish, Marion
Davies, Lon Chaney, Conrad Nagel,
Eleanor Boardman, Antonio Moreno,
Joan Crawford —but there, that's
enough for a sample. Now you see
why M.-G.-M. has a lot worth paying

College Men Rate
I wouldn't boast for anything, but
in all fairness it does seem that col
lege graduates rank ace-high here.
Behind the megaphones are the men
who make a film good or bad. Uphold
ing this company's high average are
John Robertson, of Western Univer
sity; Clarence Brown, of the Univer
sity of Tennessee; Robert Z. Leon
ard, of the University of Colorado;
John McCarthy, of St. Ignatius Col
lege (San Francisco); William Nigh,
of the University of California; Ed
ward Sedgwick, of St. Mary's Univer
sity (Texas); and Victor Seastrom of
Upsala University (Sweden). Rex
Ingram, who produced "The Four
Horsemen" and many other great
dramas since then, is a Yale man.
He prefers to work in Europe, and
hence does all of his work in France.
Education Invaluable
"College is more than worth-while,
it is invaluable for a movie career,"
Clarence Brown told me one day.(He
directed "Flesh and the Devil" and
has just completed another big spe
cial, "The Trail of '98.")
It was as an engineer that Brown
became interested in pictures. "I be
lieve that my course at the University
of Tennessee helps me to think logi
cally in many a tough problem of film
narration. Of course, I don't use en
gineering to make pictures, but the
discipline of having mastered the
facts of science is a mental governor
of the brain." University critics take
notice!
Many of the stars on this lot are
collegians. Four are ex-Englishmen—
Ralph Forbes, from Denstone College;
George K. Arthur, from Rugby Col
lege; Huntley Gordon, from Bannister
Court School, all in England proper;
and Lew Cody, who took an M.D. de
gree at McGill College, in Canada.
Lars Hanson attended the Royal
Dramatic School in Sweden, Maurice
Kains comes from Pennsylvania

Coy both were students in Chicago,
the former at the Jesuit College and

Gilbert went to Hitchcock Military j

they learned about women there —you j

Because Conrad Nagel served as ]
the actors' spokesman and saved the j
stellar salaries when the big cuts j
were threatened recently, all the play
ers idolize him. His bachelor of ora
tory degree from Highland Park Col
lege, Des Moines, may have helped
him frame the eloquent and winning
arguments.
Nagel assured me that he would 1
not trade a college education for any- j
thing else in life, "because it fur-j
nishes a set of mental calisthenics j
that builds up mentality, and because j
it stores away a fund of knowledge j
to be drawn in many an emergency."
Gish Attended Ursuline
Very few actresses have gone to
college, but 1 found four at this studio
who did. Lillian Gish attended Ursu

othy Sebastian hails from the Univer-1
sity of Alabama, Gwen Lee from j
Brownell Hall, Omaha. Aileen Pringlo
the only honest-to-Astor society lady
to succeed as a movie queen, received
her chic at the Sacred Heart in Paris.
Albert Lewin, of Kansas and Colum
bia universities, and Waldemar Young !
from our own Stanford, are outstand- j
ing in the M.-G.-M. scenario depart- j
ment. Young has written such hits |
as Mary Pickford's "Dorothy Vernon j
of Haddon Hall" and Lon Chaney's |
"The Road to Mandalay," "The Un-1
known," and"The Hypnotist."
Young Is Stanford Man
When 1 questioned him as to the !
value of his college work. Young said,
"I shall always feel that I owe a lot j
to my course at Stanford. In the first j
place, it introduced me to literature, I
the tool of the writers' craft. Aside

from that the mental discipline fits
any man better for his calling. A col- j

College Men Run F. 8.0.
Whisking from one of the very

This organization has few stars and

their executives and writers are alum- j
ni of our best universities, and it is
due to their efforts that F. 8.0. is

Joseph Sill, Jr., who left the Quad !
as a junior in '25, is one of F.8.0.'s

College Men Rate
I wouldn't boast for anything, but
in all fairness it does seem that col
lege graduates rank ace-high here.
Behind the megaphones are the men
who make a film good or bad. Uphold
ing this company's high average are
John Robertson, of Western Univer
sity; Clarence Brown, of the Univer
sity of Tennessee; Robert Z. Leon
ard, of the University of Colorado;
John McCarthy, of St. Ignatius Col
lege (San Francisco); William Nigh,
of the University of California; Ed
ward Sedgwick, of St. Mary's Univer
sity (Texas); and Victor Seastrom of
Upsala University (Sweden). Rex
Ingram, who produced "The Four
Horsemen" and many other great
dramas since then, is a Yale man.
He prefers to work in Europe, and
hence does all of his work in France.
Education Invaluable
"College is more than worth-while,
it is invaluable for a movie career,"
Clarence Brown told me one day.(He
directed "Flesh and the Devil" and
has just completed another big spe
cial, "The Trail of '98.")
It was as an engineer that Brown
became interested in pictures. "I be
lieve that my course at the University
of Tennessee helps me to think logi
cally in many a tough problem of film
narration. Of course, I don't use en
gineering to make pictures, but the
discipline of having mastered the
facts of science is a mental governor
of the brain." University critics take
notice!
Many of the stars on this lot are
collegians. Four are ex-Englishmen—
Ralph Forbes, from Denstone College;
George K. Arthur, from Rugby Col
lege; Huntley Gordon, from Bannister
Court School, all in England proper;
and Lew Cody, who took an M.D. de
gree at McGill College, in Canada.

Dramatic School in Sweden, Maurice
Kains comes from Pennsylvania

Coy both were students in Chicago,
the former at the Jesuit College and
McCoy at St. Ignatius College.

Gilbert went to Hitchcock Military j

they learned about women there —you j
know these prep school boys!

Because Conrad Nagel served as ]
the actors' spokesman and saved the j
stellar salaries when the big cuts j
were threatened recently, all the play
ers idolize him. His bachelor of ora

Education Invaluable
"College is more than worth-while,
it is invaluable for a movie career,"
Clarence Brown told me one day.(He
directed "Flesh and the Devil" and
has just completed another big spe
cial, "The Trail of '98.")
It was as an engineer that Brown
became interested in pictures. "I be
lieve that my course at the University
of Tennessee helps me to think logi
cally in many a tough problem of film
narration. Of course, I don't use en
gineering to make pictures, but the
discipline of having mastered the
facts of science is a mental governor
of the brain." University critics take
notice!
Many of the stars on this lot are
collegians. Four are ex-Englishmen—
Ralph Forbes, from Denstone College;
George K. Arthur, from Rugby Col

Court School, all in England proper;
and Lew Cody, who took an M.D. de
gree at McGill College, in Canada.

Coy both were students in Chicago,

Gilbert Prep Student
The two leading sheiks of the lot,
John Gilbert and William Haines, only

Gilbert went to Hitchcock Military j

presumably studied at Staunton Mili- j

they learned about women there —you j

Because Conrad Nagel served as ]
the actors' spokesman and saved the j
stellar salaries when the big cuts j
were threatened recently, all the play
ers idolize him. His bachelor of ora
tory degree from Highland Park Col

Nagel assured me that he would 1
not trade a college education for any- j

College Men Run F. 8.0.
Whisking from one of the very

graduates were in control at the Film
Booking Offices place of business.
This organization has few stars and

their executives and writers are alum- j
ni of our best universities, and it is
due to their efforts that F. 8.0. is

Sill Publicity Writer
Joseph Sill, Jr., who left the Quad !
as a junior in '25, is one of F.8.0.'s
publicity writers.
This was the organization that j
starred Clara Bow in "The Plastic

enormous salary for his services in
"One Minute to Play." With these I

(This is one of a scries of features about col
legions in the motion picture industry. Material
obtained for the Stanford Daily.)
Away from bourgeoisie Hollywood,
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is easily distin
guished as the most important studio
in Culver City. "More stars than there
are in heaven," the publicity depart
ment shrieks. Many of the "ne plus
ultra" do emote here, although not
truly as many as you can see on the
milky way.
Just recall "Ben Hur," "The Big
Parade," Flesh and the Devil." Then
think of Norma Shearer, John Gilbert,
Ramon Novarro, Lillian Gish, Marion
Davies, Lon Chaney, Conrad Nagel,
Eleanor Boardman, Antonio Moreno,
Joan Crawford —but there, that's
enough for a sample. Now you see
why M.-G.-M. has a lot worth paying
a visit?
College Men Rate
I wouldn't boast for anything, but
in all fairness it does seem that col
lege graduates rank ace-high here.
Behind the megaphones are the men
who make a film good or bad. Uphold
ing this company's high average are
John Robertson, of Western Univer
sity; Clarence Brown, of the Univer
sity of Tennessee; Robert Z. Leon
ard, of the University of Colorado;
John McCarthy, of St. Ignatius Col
lege (San Francisco); William Nigh,
of the University of California; Ed
ward Sedgwick, of St. Mary's Univer
sity (Texas); and Victor Seastrom of
Upsala University (Sweden). Rex
Ingram, who produced "The Four
Horsemen" and many other great
dramas since then, is a Yale man.
He prefers to work in Europe, and
hence does all of his work in France.
Education Invaluable
"College is more than worth-while,
it is invaluable for a movie career,"
Clarence Brown told me one day.(He
directed "Flesh and the Devil" and
has just completed another big spe
cial, "The Trail of '98.")
It was as an engineer that Brown
became interested in pictures. "I be
lieve that my course at the University
of Tennessee helps me to think logi
cally in many a tough problem of film
narration. Of course, I don't use en
gineering to make pictures, but the
discipline of having mastered the
facts of science is a mental governor
of the brain." University critics take
notice!
Many of the stars on this lot are
collegians. Four are ex-Englishmen—
Ralph Forbes, from Denstone College;
George K. Arthur, from Rugby Col
lege; Huntley Gordon, from Bannister
Court School, all in England proper;
and Lew Cody, who took an M.D. de
gree at McGill College, in Canada.
Lars Hanson attended the Royal
Dramatic School in Sweden, Maurice
Kains comes from Pennsylvania
State .Edward Connelly and Tim Mc-
Coy both were students in Chicago,
the former at the Jesuit College and
McCoy at St. Ignatius College.
Gilbert Prep Student
The two leading sheiks of the lot,
John Gilbert and William Haines, only
got as near to college as prep schools.
Gilbert went to Hitchcock Military j
Academy in San Rafael, while Bill
presumably studied at Staunton Mili- j
tary Academy in Viginia. Perhaps ;
they learned about women there —you j
know these prep school boys!

Because Conrad Nagel served as ]
the actors' spokesman and saved the j
stellar salaries when the big cuts j
were threatened recently, all the play
ers idolize him. His bachelor of ora
tory degree from Highland Park Col
lege, Des Moines, may have helped
him frame the eloquent and winning
arguments.
Nagel assured me that he would 1
not trade a college education for any- j
thing else in life, "because it fur-j
nishes a set of mental calisthenics j
that builds up mentality, and because j
it stores away a fund of knowledge j
to be drawn in many an emergency."
Gish Attended Ursuline
Very few actresses have gone to
college, but 1 found four at this studio
who did. Lillian Gish attended Ursu
line Seminary in Massillon, Ohio, Dor
othy Sebastian hails from the Univer-1
sity of Alabama, Gwen Lee from j
Brownell Hall, Omaha. Aileen Pringlo
the only honest-to-Astor society lady
to succeed as a movie queen, received
her chic at the Sacred Heart in Paris.
Albert Lewin, of Kansas and Colum
bia universities, and Waldemar Young !
from our own Stanford, are outstand- j
ing in the M.-G.-M. scenario depart- j
ment. Young has written such hits |
as Mary Pickford's "Dorothy Vernon j
of Haddon Hall" and Lon Chaney's |
"The Road to Mandalay," "The Un-1
known," and"The Hypnotist."
Young Is Stanford Man
When 1 questioned him as to the !
value of his college work. Young said,
"I shall always feel that I owe a lot j
to my course at Stanford. In the first j
place, it introduced me to literature, I
the tool of the writers' craft. Aside

from that the mental discipline fits
any man better for his calling. A col- j
lege education is every day becoming j
more and more invaluable in every
line of human endeavor."
M.-G.-M. was filming its big college ,
picture—the only one on this season's
schedule —"The Fair Co-ed" when I
was 'nosing around' the lot. I think it's
the cleverest of its kind since "Brown
of Harvard." Marion Davies is the
star, Pomona College the background,
and Johnny Mack Brown, All-Ameri- j
DAILY REPORTER CRASHES—TWo j
can football star from the University
of Alabama, is the hero. There are
dozens of comical gags and the titles
are a scream. You haven't given the i
movies a fair chance if you pass this
by.
Mayer Tells Policy
If you want to know Metro-Goldwyn- j
Mayer's policy toward collegians, hark
to what Louis B. Mayer, vice-president
in charge of production, said when I ;
crashed his office for an interview for
the Daily.
"The value of the college-trained ;
man or woman in the picture indus
try is every day becoming more ap- j
predated. The action of the Academy j
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences I
in recognizing and co-operating with
the motion picture courses at Colum-!
bia and Harvard shows plainly the j
full recognition of the value to us of ;
trained college workers.
"This industry, like any other great |
industry, welcomes such workers, !
whether as actors, scenarists, writers, I
or technicians.
College Men Run F. 8.0.
Whisking from one of the very
largest to one of the smaller produc
ing companies, I found that college
graduates were in control at the Film
Booking Offices place of business.
This organization has few stars and
directors under regular contract, pre
ferring to borrow them for single pic
tures from the bigger companies. But
their executives and writers are alum- j
ni of our best universities, and it is
due to their efforts that F. 8.0. is
going forward so rapidly.
