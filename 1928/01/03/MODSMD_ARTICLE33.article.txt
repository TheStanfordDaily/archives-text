# JACK KEOUGH PRAISES WARNER'S TEAM IN INTERVIEW FOR DAILY
## Big Game Keeps Fine Spirit Alive Between U.C., Cards, Says Radio Man 
### Elsa Krotozyner 
"They're lining up now —all right,
they're ready—the ball's snapped—
he's got it! He's away! There he goes
around left end —ten yards, fifteen
yards, TWENTY yards! He's down on
the twenty-three-yard line. A beauti
ful play!" Coast football and radio
fans have all become familiar with
the voice of Jack Keough, sports an
nouncer of KPO. Keough has broad
cast more than twenty-five grid games
since he began in the fall of 1926, and
it was he who told all about the Cali
fornia-Penn tilt over the microphone
Saturday.
"Pop Warner's teams are the hard
est for which to broadcast, because
the number of reverse plays makes
it difficult to follow the ball," Keough
said the other day in the KPO studio.
He is a tali, dark-haired young man
with an exceptionally pleasing per
sonality. "On the other hand," he con
tinued, "U.S.C. has the easiest team,
because usually one man car
ries the ball, and that man is the
quarterback."
Keough was originally a reporter
for the San Francisco "Chronicle" and
the Oakland "Tribune," covering gen
eral assignments and police station
happenings. About three and a half
years ago he started with KPO as tl;e
"Big Brother" of the Children's Hour,
and two seasons ago he began broad
casting the college football games
and the Coast League baseball con
tests.
Big Game Wonderful
"I think the Big Game is a wonder
ful thing," Keough said. "It keeps
alive a fine spirit between California
and Stanford that is far-reaching in
its effect. Every year alumni from all
over the country come back to the
game, and those that can't, listen to
the radio broadcast. I've received let
ters all the way from Alaska to Pearl
Harbor, Honolulu, from alumni who
have appreciated the broadcast.
"The Big Game is one of the great
est spectacles in the country. The
Notre Dame-U.S.C. contest couldn't
compare with it. Although there were
more than 120,000 people at the Sol
diers Field stadium, there was not
the spirit that is manifested at the
annual Stanford-California affair. The
stunts were also inferior to those dis
played in the Western classic."
Keough, who broadcast the Notre
Dame-U.S.C. tilt on December 3 is
the first sports announcer who has
ever traveled East to broadcast a
football game.
Praises Pop Warner
Keough had only words of praise
for Pop Warner. "I think he is one
of the outstanding coaches in Amer
ica. It was one of the best things that
was ever done for Stanford when
Warner came out here. He's an excel
lent football coach, and just as excel
lent a leader of young men. As for
the players, I have come to know a
number of them personally, and
they're a bunch of fine young fellow^.
"The 1928 season will be the big
gest and most closely contested that
the Coast has known. It will draw the
greatest crowds, and the greatest box
office receipts. Stanford will have
another strong team. California will
be stronger than this last season, and
U.S.C. and Washington will be good,
as usual." Keough would predict no
1928 Conference winner, but he re
marked, "It's always a good bet to
bet with Pop Warner."

yards, TWENTY yards! He's down on
the twenty-three-yard line. A beauti
ful play!" Coast football and radio
fans have all become familiar with
the voice of Jack Keough, sports an
nouncer of KPO. Keough has broad
cast more than twenty-five grid games
since he began in the fall of 1926, and
it was he who told all about the Cali
fornia-Penn tilt over the microphone
Saturday.
"Pop Warner's teams are the hard
est for which to broadcast, because
the number of reverse plays makes
it difficult to follow the ball," Keough
said the other day in the KPO studio.
He is a tali, dark-haired young man
with an exceptionally pleasing per
sonality. "On the other hand," he con
tinued, "U.S.C. has the easiest team,
because usually one man car
ries the ball, and that man is the
quarterback."
Keough was originally a reporter
for the San Francisco "Chronicle" and
the Oakland "Tribune," covering gen
eral assignments and police station
happenings. About three and a half
years ago he started with KPO as tl;e
"Big Brother" of the Children's Hour,
and two seasons ago he began broad
casting the college football games
and the Coast League baseball con
tests.
Big Game Wonderful
"I think the Big Game is a wonder
ful thing," Keough said. "It keeps
alive a fine spirit between California
and Stanford that is far-reaching in
its effect. Every year alumni from all
over the country come back to the
game, and those that can't, listen to
the radio broadcast. I've received let
ters all the way from Alaska to Pearl
Harbor, Honolulu, from alumni who
have appreciated the broadcast.
"The Big Game is one of the great
est spectacles in the country. The
Notre Dame-U.S.C. contest couldn't
compare with it. Although there were
more than 120,000 people at the Sol
diers Field stadium, there was not
the spirit that is manifested at the
annual Stanford-California affair. The
stunts were also inferior to those dis
played in the Western classic."
Keough, who broadcast the Notre
Dame-U.S.C. tilt on December 3 is
the first sports announcer who has
ever traveled East to broadcast a
football game.
Praises Pop Warner
Keough had only words of praise
for Pop Warner. "I think he is one
of the outstanding coaches in Amer
ica. It was one of the best things that
was ever done for Stanford when
Warner came out here. He's an excel
lent football coach, and just as excel
lent a leader of young men. As for
the players, I have come to know a
number of them personally, and
they're a bunch of fine young fellow^.
"The 1928 season will be the big
gest and most closely contested that
the Coast has known. It will draw the
greatest crowds, and the greatest box
office receipts. Stanford will have
another strong team. California will
be stronger than this last season, and
U.S.C. and Washington will be good,
as usual." Keough would predict no
1928 Conference winner, but he re
marked, "It's always a good bet to
bet with Pop Warner."
"They're lining up now —all right,
they're ready—the ball's snapped—
he's got it! He's away! There he goes
