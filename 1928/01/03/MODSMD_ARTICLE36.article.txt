# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Drop in at the ice rink in Madison
Square Garden, New York, any morn-:
ing, and you will find an attractive ,
girl practicing the intricate "rifs" and i
"roffs" and "ribs" and "robs" that go j
to make up the difficult figures pe-;
culiar to fancy skating. The graceful
young lady is Miss Beatrix Loughran,
of New York City (no relation to
Tommy) and the reason that she i
spends so much time —and money too !
—in practicing and making perfect *
the rhythmic pirouetting, looping, and
circling that makes this sport one of
the most graceful and artistic of all. '
indoors or out, is that she will again
represent her country in the skating
events at the Olympic games in
Chamonix.
Practice makes perfect, and Miss
Loughran is a firm believer in pre
paredness. Just because she went to
Europe in 1924 as a member of Uncle
Sam's troupe of trained athletes, and j
placed second in the women's figure
skating championships, does not mean
that she is attempting to rest on her j
laurels. Not Miss Loughran. A Mrs. 1
H. Szabo-Plank, of Austria, defeated
her in 1924, and Beatrix wants to
make sure that her own name is at ]
the top when the returns for the 192S j
winter sports are in.
Ice helped to make Red Grange
famous, but the "Red Rover" neverj
worked so long or learned to control
his balance on his feet half as well 1

as Beatrix Loughran can. She'll "cut
a lot of ice" in the coming interna
tional competition, if you ask me, and
no queen of the steel blades was ever
more modest, or more deserving of
success.
