mittee during the coming year. The
national officers for the coming year
are as follows: President, Edward
Miller, Washington and Lee; Vice-
President, Martha Biehle, Vassar;
Treasurer, Willard Rippon, University
of Ohio.
Following are statements of the
Stanford delegates concerning
the convention:
By Eleanor Davidson
"The Federation faced a difficult
situation as the president had been
forced to resign on account of ill
health and the vice-president, Marvin
Breckenridge, had only just returned
from Europe. Consequently the con
vention lacked organization, but in
spite of that and the short time in
which it had to work, something defi
nite was accomplished. There can be
no question of the need for the Feder
ation to anyone who has seen the
real interest of every student there
in the common problems of student
government.
"To secure stability for the or
ganization and adequate planning for
future conventions, provision has been
made in the budget for a stenographer
for the president for the next six
months, and then, if the finances are
adequate, the establishment of a cen
tral office in New York and a per
manent secretary. The fourth annual
convention will be held at the Uni
versity of Missouri next December,
and will be a four- instead of a three
day convention.
"The Federation hopes to unite stu
dent thinkers for action on national
affairs, and also to foster interest in
students of other countries. The
American Union is now a member of
the International Confederation of
Students, to which the Student Unions
of twenty-nine other countries be
long."
By John Van Amringe
"Individual delegates were im
pressed by the 1926 conference, but
not much of this enthusiasm sifted
down to the average student of the
campus. We earnestly hope to com
municate it to him this yearâ€”but
should it extend only to the executive
committees or councils who might
act in the light of data Ave bring back
in regard to honor systems and spon
sors, the student body would still get
its 'money's worth.'
"The Federation deals with the ma
terial and intellectual problems of
students, developing machinery for
attaining practical improvement.
Cheaper textbooks, the students' right
to vote, student government, effective
ness of honor systems, betterment of
campus social conditions, and public
careers for men of higher education
are a few local objectives. Difficulties
of organization which occupied con
siderable attention have now been
surmounted, in this, the third year of
the Federation; and its influence will
be felt more and more, with its execu
tive committee, covering the country,
at work throughout the year.
Promote World Peace
"Besides local problems, the Feder
ation has an international scope in
helping to promote world peace. As a
member of the Confederacion Inter
nationale Etudiantes it has set in mo
tion practical machinery facilitating
foreign travel for American students
(conducted through Europe by lead
ing European university men) without
profit or commercial features by hav
ing obtained reduced rates from rail
ways, hotels, etc., visas without
charge, and hospitality of European
students and of eminent men, for fur
thering the international goodwill of
the rising generation and the preven
tion of future wars." European travel
will be feasible even for some stu
dents who are financially 'low.'
"Stanford has been able to con
tribute much to the convention; and
to bring back a stimulus, viewpoints,
and ideas, which, at this time espe
cially, in view of recent wholesale
violations of the honor system, should
be most valuable."
