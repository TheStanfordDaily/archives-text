## College, City Characteristics Shown in Performance Of Rooting Section 
### TEMPLETON PECK 
(Special to Stanford Daily)
PASADENA, Jan. 2.—Stanford root
ing section stunts, due to the efforts
of the Rally Committee, worked in
well with the Tournament of Roses
theme and college and city character
istics. The first stunt shown by the
Stanford rooting section was the dis
play of the lettering, "Happy New
Year, Pitts."
Next was shown "T of R," similar
to that used last year in the Stanford-
Alabama game. This was followed by
the picturization of Pittsburgh smoke
stacks belching forth clouds of black
smoke. Significant of Stanford's grid
victories during the past season was
the gradual covering up of the letters
"0.A.C., U.S.C., 0., W., C., Pitt," with
the cardinal color. This gave way to
a large "S."
As for the contest itself, spectators
seemed to indicate that they felt the
refereeing was too meticulous. Both
teams fought well and the Cards re
gained their prestige, lost as a result
of the St. Mary's and Santa Clara
games.
A correct version of Stanford's
touchdown in the second quarter
is as follows: Lewis replaced
Murphy with instructions. It was
fourth down and 2 yards to the
goal line. Wilton, receiving the
ball from center, passed to Sims
who fumbled on the one-yard line.
Pittsburgh accidentally kicked
the ball behind the Stanford line
of scrimmage when Wilton scoop
ed it up and, juggling and finger
ing the pigskin, ran wide around
right end to cross the goal line
near the corner of the field. Hoff
man converted for the winning
point.
