WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.—( U.P.) —
Serious embarrassment faces the
United States at the impending Pan-
American Congress in Havana ten
days hence as a result of the Nica
ragua explosion.
While President Coolidge is open
ing the conference in person and de
livering an address designed to allay
Latin-American distrust of the "Colos
sus of the North," the Navy will be
sending 1000 American marines to
Nicaragua to exterminate Sandino
and his rebels who have killed six
American marines and wounded twen
ty-eight in the last four days.
Congress Will Be Interested
Congress, which returns from a
holiday recess Wednesday, will be
keenly interested in the Nicaraguan
affair but because of the danger of
further embarrassing the American
delegation to the Havana Congress,
debate may be held down. Chairman
Borah of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, is in favor of such dis
cretion. Even Senator Shipstead,
leader of the movement for a thorough
investigation of American diplomacy
in Latin-America, favors waiting until
after the conference much as he dis
approves what the United States is
doing in Nicaragua.
