PASADENA, Jan. 3.—( U.P.) —
Frank Wilton, hero of the Pitts
burgh-Stanford Rose Bowl foot- j
ball contest here Monday, had re
covered sufficiently from back in
juries to travel north with his
teammates. Injuries were sus
tained in making the Cardinal
touchdown.
Led by "Biff" Hoffman, its newly- j
elected captain, a victorious Stanford
varsity will return to the campus from !
Pasadena this morning. A few of the |
Redsliirts, the vanguard of the rest
of (he squad, arrived late last night, j
while others will probably remain in ;
the South for a few days.
But with training rules to be for
gotten for many months to come, the I
Cards can take a well-earned rest, |
knowing that several, at least, have
made a start for 1928 All-American
honors.
Hoffman Great Player
First of all, there is Hoffman, who'
will make a fitting successor to Cap
tain Hal McCreery. In spite of the
fact that his kicking average was a
mere fifty yards, that he played a

. great defensive game, and that his
| passes were knocked down only by
1 the efforts of Welch himself, his total
|of eighty-one yards gained through
I the best defensive team in the East
| alone labels him as the West's great
j est candidate for national honors.
Then there is Frank Wilton, who
i carried the ball eleven times, mostly
| through the line, for an average of
| five yards each, and a touchdown for
j good measure. His yardage was
, beaten only by "Dynamite" Post, who
I chalked up an average of nine yards
i for each of the four times a guard
around play was called.
Hyland Ends Career
Dick Hyland finished his football
l career at Stanford in a blaze of glory.
; With Hoffman, he lead the first two
| advances on the Pitt goal.
Playing against a line of near All-
Americans, the Stanford forward
wall performed nobly. Captain Mc
| Creery outplayed Cutler throughout
I (he game. When it came to (he
1 tackles, Pitt had a certain Mr. Kern
who rather messed up but
little Walt Heinecke took his place
and ran this Ail-American quite
ragged.
