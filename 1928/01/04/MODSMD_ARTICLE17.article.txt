With football gone but not forgot
ten, Stanford will next turn its inter
est to basketball when the Cardinal
varsity opens the season here Friday
and Saturday nights, playing consecu
tively the College of Pacific team and
the Fresno State Teachers.
All in all Coach Hunt's men broke
even in their holiday engagements.
Though they lost two contests and
won one when they invaded the South
land, they defeated the Y.M.I, quintet
in San Francisco which evens up
their standing. In addition the Cardi
nals beat, both the San Jose Golds
and the San Jose Teachers College
since the last issue of the Stanford
Daily was published, December 9, last
quarter.
Defeat Y.M.I. Team
Starting their vacation contests
with a 27 to 26 victory over the Y.M.I,
team, the varsity journeyed to Los
Angeles to be beaten 26 to 14 by the
Los Angeles Athletic Club. According
to Coach Husky Hunt, the Stanford
team looked the worst in that game.
The Cardinals were unable to find the
basket and they played slovenly ball.
Hollywood's Athletic Club proved
too much for Stanford and took the
second game of the trip, tallying 30
points to the Cards' 14. In the opinion
of the coaches, the Hollywood team
was the best that the Cardinals have
met in some years.
Richards Stars
In the last game, December 30,
against the San Bernardino Teachers,
Stanford tightened up and took the
game 28 to 19. It was in this contest
that Richards showed up as the star
forward on the varsity. The curly
headed blond handled the ball in beau
tiful fashion and counted for the ma
jority of baskets.
In addition to Richards, Cook and
Bowers competed strongly for the
other forward position. These three
men are the most reliable shots Hunt
has on his team. They are all handi
capped by being short, but have an
over amount of speed and accuracy
to compensate for it.
