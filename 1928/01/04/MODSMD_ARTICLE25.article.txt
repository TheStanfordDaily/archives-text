# So the Students May Know
## 
### 
Rumors, wild, ugly, and ofttimes unfounded on fact, mark the con
versation of students returning to the campus for registration. The sus
pension of the charter of one of the fraternities, together with numerous
removals of students for various causes, gives rise to unpleasant talk.
Unpleasant because of the nature of the subject-matter—but withal the
talk is a healthy sign that students are concerning themselves will prob
lems of college not mentioned in the textbooks.
1 he Honor System and student government are going through pe
riods of crises. Unquestionably there were a number of violations of the
Honor System during examinations last quarter. Whether or not they
were wholesale violations (through obtaining of examination papers be
fore examination time) are matters of fact yet to be determined. The
Men's Council meets Thursday and it is probable that it will take action
on some of these cases then.
Figures on the number of students removed during the past quarter
for drinking and other evidences of "conduct unbecoming Stanford stu
dents are not yet obtainable. The Daily will make every effort to obtain
these figures for the students. Rumors place the number anywhere from
twenty-five to sixty. This uncertainty itself does great harm by under
mining that morale necessary for proper maintenance of student concern
in the Honor System and student government.
We have said that these two institutions are passing through crises.
These reasons are obscure but the effects apparently have manifested
themselves through "conduct unbecoming" in more ways than one. In
vestigations of the working of the Honor System will do no good. The
report would probably give it (in generalization) a clean bill of health and
the matter would end—until the next examinations. It is the student body
attitude that counts and this must be brought into line soon. One way of
doing this, we believe, is through the proper publication of FACTS.
