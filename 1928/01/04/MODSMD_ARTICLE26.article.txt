# Captain Hoffman

### 
The election of "Biff" Hoffman to captaincy of the 1928 varsity is
welcome news of the deserving man receiving what is perhaps the chief
athletic honor in the University. His election at the end of the season
instead of next fall is a far better thing for Stanford football than the
continuance of the practice of deferring the election of captain.
On the other hand, at the present time Stanford's basketball, baseball,
and tennis teams are without leaders and their seasons will soon be upon
us. The track team did the wise thing last spring by electing its captain
(Bud Spencer) at the close of the season. Two years ago in a student
body election the students voted down the proposal to abolish captains.
Despite this the practice of deferring elections came into existence.
Stanford has done enough dallying with experiments in this matter.
Let all teams elect their captains at the traditional time—the close of the
season. The teammates of Hoffman and Spencer are to be congratulated
both upon their selections for leaders and the times of electing the
captains.
