Tf the Glee Club's announcement that roughs will not be admitted to
the Registration Dance Friday night is merely a "clever" bit of publicity
no harm may come of the matter. However, if roughs are to be excluded
from a campus dance it means that another of Stanford's few remaining
traditions has been broken. Some slight justification for the attempted
exclusion may be found in the fact that of late roughs have been crowd
ing the dance floors and thereby causing considerable confusion to the
paying customers.
This matter, however, can be handled in far better ways than by ex
cluding roughs. The thing is unprecedented; we advise the roughs to go
and not to crowd the floor.
