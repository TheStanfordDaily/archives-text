THE SUBSTITUTE
It fell to a substitute tackle to turn
the tide definitely to Stanford's side
in Monday's game with Pittsburgh.
Walt Heinecke, the Santa Ana sopho
more, deserves all the credit the
newspapers gave him and more for
spotting the triple reverse and down
ing Hagan in the third quarter nine
yards behind the line of scrimmage
and for blocking the attempted con
version of goal.
Hal Davis, varsity tennis coach
and mentor of the Gray football
squad, thinks Heinecke will be
ail-American in his senior year.
Pop Warner, according to Davis,
said early this season that Hein
ecke would have made all-coast
center this season had he played
regularly at that position. He is
a versatile youth, having played |
back.

WEATHER—WONDERFUL
Sunny southern California's snow
capped mountains may have looked \
down upon the great East-West
classic in cold and brilliant majesty,
as Graham McNamee, the radio an- j
nouncer who intermittently reported j
the game Monday, enthusiastically
said, but the fact was that inside the j
Rose Bowl, that "diadem" set within
the Arroyo Seco, it was ungodly hot.
McCreery, Freeman, and Sellman
wilted in the third quarter, and Pop
had to take Freeman out, but Mc-1
Creery and Sellman recouped after i
the Stanford touchdown and played
with vim and vigor again.
The Pitt players, who looked
like giant wasps in their black
striped yellow sweaters and white
headgear, limped from the field
exhausted when they were taken
from the game, but to their credit
it should be said they played like
devils whenever Stanford got
within threatening distance of j
the goal.
$$ $ $
The flagrance of the Rose Bowl
game as an out-and-out advertising
scheme again was apparent when for
the second year McNamee used the
microphone to broadcast the beauties
of the scene of which the bowl is a
part, invariably slighting the report j
of the game as it progressed. Fans j
listening in over the radio were said j
to have been left in complete ignor- j
ance of all but the most obvious de
tails of the play, and it is said that |
the radio reporter was completely
faulty in describing the spectacular !
play which resulted in the Stanford l
touchdown.
To be an innocent party to the
broadcasting of ballyhoo is surely
an ignominous position in which
to find a team of a self-respecting
university. Pittsburgh, we are
sure, was as outraged as Stanford
supporters were, and that the
public is tiring of hearing in a
football game broadcast what
should properly be set forth in
an advertising circular is perhaps
best evidenced by the presence
of the 10,000 empty seats in the
stadium.
VICTIMS
Many fans wondered why Robesky
left the field in the second quarter.
The announcer declared he was sent ;
off for roughness, but it was ex
plained later that his arm was hurt.
Spud Harder was smashed in the
nose and yesterday was in Pasadena
under a nurse's care. The early-season
injury to his jaw left him particularly j
susceptible to hard shocks. Johnny'
Preston also was put out of the game I
with a head injury.

of the game as it progressed. Fans j
listening in over the radio were said j
to have been left in complete ignor- j
ance of all but the most obvious de
tails of the play, and it is said that |
the radio reporter was completely
faulty in describing the spectacular !
play which resulted in the Stanford l
touchdown.
To be an innocent party to the
broadcasting of ballyhoo is surely
an ignominous position in which
to find a team of a self-respecting
university. Pittsburgh, we are
sure, was as outraged as Stanford
supporters were, and that the
public is tiring of hearing in a
football game broadcast what
should properly be set forth in
an advertising circular is perhaps
best evidenced by the presence
of the 10,000 empty seats in the
stadium.
VICTIMS
Many fans wondered why Robesky
left the field in the second quarter.
The announcer declared he was sent ;
off for roughness, but it was ex
plained later that his arm was hurt.
Spud Harder was smashed in the
nose and yesterday was in Pasadena
under a nurse's care. The early-season
injury to his jaw left him particularly j
susceptible to hard shocks. Johnny'
Preston also was put out of the game I
with a head injury.
—Templeton Peck.
THE SUBSTITUTE
It fell to a substitute tackle to turn
the tide definitely to Stanford's side
in Monday's game with Pittsburgh.
Walt Heinecke, the Santa Ana sopho
more, deserves all the credit the
newspapers gave him and more for
spotting the triple reverse and down
ing Hagan in the third quarter nine
yards behind the line of scrimmage
and for blocking the attempted con
version of goal.
Hal Davis, varsity tennis coach
and mentor of the Gray football
squad, thinks Heinecke will be
ail-American in his senior year.
Pop Warner, according to Davis,
said early this season that Hein
ecke would have made all-coast
center this season had he played
regularly at that position. He is
a versatile youth, having played |
back.

Sunny southern California's snow

down upon the great East-West
classic in cold and brilliant majesty,
as Graham McNamee, the radio an- j
nouncer who intermittently reported j
the game Monday, enthusiastically
said, but the fact was that inside the j
Rose Bowl, that "diadem" set within
the Arroyo Seco, it was ungodly hot.
McCreery, Freeman, and Sellman
wilted in the third quarter, and Pop
had to take Freeman out, but Mc-1
Creery and Sellman recouped after i
the Stanford touchdown and played
with vim and vigor again.
The Pitt players, who looked
like giant wasps in their black
striped yellow sweaters and white
headgear, limped from the field
exhausted when they were taken
from the game, but to their credit
it should be said they played like
devils whenever Stanford got
within threatening distance of j
the goal.

The flagrance of the Rose Bowl
