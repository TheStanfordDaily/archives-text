# JANUARY CHAPARRAL HAS NEW FEATURES; SALE STARTS FRIDAY
## 
### 
The January issue of Chaparral,
which will be on sale Friday, contains
several new features of general cam
pus appeal, and in addition, is guar
anteed by the editor to contain only
new jokes. "The number is not a spe
cialty one," said Winston Norman,
editor. "It is merely intended to prove
that you don't need an excuse to be
silly."
"Married at Last, or Better Late
than Never," is a story by Helen Stan
ford, of "passion in the days follow
ing the Civil War that will quicken
the blood and keep readers awake
nights." This is one of the first short
stories published by the Old Boy for
some time. The style and technique
of the story is entirely new and dif
ferent, and is a notable departure.
In keeping with the first of the
quarter, Herbert Reynolds has a page
of useful ornamental examples of
classroom work, under the title
"Philosophy Notes." Ted Krough ap
pears in this issue also, with a nine
reel tragedy, entitled "Keeping that
New Year's Resolution," filmed espe
cially for Chaparral with pencil and
brush.
The cover design is by Hardie
Gramatky, titled "Unusual Weather."
Quad sale will begin at 8 o'clock Fri
day.
