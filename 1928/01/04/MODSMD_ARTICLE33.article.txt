MADISON, Wis.— (I.P.)—'The edi
tors of the Wisconsin Literary Maga
zine were given the privilege of tear
ing from the binding of each number
of the last issue one page, because
that page had on it a satire on Sher
wood Anderson which the faculty cen
sors believed was an insult to the
well-known author.
The story which offended the cen
sors, according to the Daily Cardinal,
was an introspective study of the
thoughts of the author while buying
and eating some fish of common color
and unmistakable deadness.
