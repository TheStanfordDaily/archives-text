# HULME LEAVES FOR NINE MONTHS' TOUR OF EUROPE, AFRICA
## Will Study Life of Sozzini, Italian Liberalist of Sixteenth Century 
### 
Professor Edward Maslin Hulme of i
the Stanford History department left
December 26 for a nine months' trip
to Italy, Sicily, and Africa. Hulme will
spend part of his time in study, re
turning to Stanford next October.
While in Italy he will study the life
and thought of Lelio Sozzini, a liberal
Italian thinker of the sixteenth cen
tury. Lelio was born in Siena, where
some of his letters are still to be
found. He fled over the Alps seeking
a place where religious tolerance pre
vailed. There is very little about him !
in books printed in English; and there 1
is nothing adtequate in any language. |
His thought has been very influential !
in modern life.
Hulme begins travel in Naples from
where he goes south to Sorrento,;
Salerno, and other places on the!
Italian coast; then he will cross to j
Sicily, going from there to Tunis, Al- :
giers, and Morocco, and then back to
Naples. Hulme will go into the heel
of Italy to Lecce, where there is an j
abundance of Baroque architecture.
He will stop in Rome for a short !
while, and then go inland to Umbria j
and Tuscany for a visit to many of
the little towns. His longest stay will i
be in Siena. Stopping at several 1
places in the plain of Lombardy, he j
will make his way to Venice, where j
he is to read in the State archives
now kept in the Church of the Frari.
From Venice Professor Hulme will
cross the Brenner Pass to Vienna,
Budapest, Bucharest, Prague, and
Cracow. In this old capitol of Poland
are several letters of Lelio Sozzini.
Going back through Germany to
Bruges, another quiet medieval town, j
down the Rhone to the towns of
Provence, the land of the trouba- '
dours, into Spain and Portugal, Pro
fessor Hulme will stop in France. His |
last visits will be to Rouen and Mont |
Saint Michel.
