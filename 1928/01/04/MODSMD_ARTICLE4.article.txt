# DEFINITE WORD OF HOOVER'S CANDIDACY MAY COME SOON
## Friends Deny Secretary May Quit Cabinet Post if He Enters Race 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3.—( U.P.) —
Although no definite information has
come from Herbert Hoover himself
there is a strong impression in Wash
ington that some statement bearing
on his presidential plans may be
forthcoming early in the new year.
. This may take the form of a letter
I from friends, or a statement by them,
and possibly a reply by Hoover. His
closest friends, however, deny that he
intends to quit the cabinet.
Hoover Forces Grow
Meanwhile, the Hoover forces are
growing although many still feel that
Vice-President Dawes may figure
strongly in the convention should
Hoover and Lowden become dead
locked for any considerable number
of ballots.
The latest addition to the Hoover
strength comes from New Jersey
where Senator Edge has declared him
self strong for the Secretary of Com
merce. New Jersey has presidential
j primaries but it is not likely that
j Edge would have made a declaration
j this early had he not canvassed the
j situation very thoroughly.
Greatest interest lies in the atti
j tude Secretary of the Treasury Mellon
i will take. Hoover has much strength
i in the Coolidge cabinet and among
Coolidge organization leaders. Even
! in Mellon's own department his un
der-secretary and right-hand man,
Ogden Mills of New York, has de
clared for Hoover.
Hilles Uncertain
In addition to Mellon, New York
: offers another important uncertain
i spot on the Hoover map. Charles D.
Hilles, national committeeman and re
garded as the political representative
of some Wall Street sentiment, has
refused to declare for Hoover. He was
for Hughes and now is talking about
a "Back to Coolidge Movement"
j while waiting for developments which
j will enable him to take a more defi
nite position.
The remaining weak spot for
j Hoover is in the farm belt where his
alleged part in controlling wheat
prices during the war is being dis
cussed. Harry Garfield, president of
Williams College, War-Time Fuel Ad
ministrator and a member of the
Wheat Price Committee during the
war some time ago made a detailed
statement of the episode completely
clearing Hoover for any responsibility
in it.
