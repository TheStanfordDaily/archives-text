# STANFORD'S 1928 FOOTBALL CAPTAIN
## 
### 
By M. M. S.
Hoffman firmly established himself in
the select group of great American full
backs that includes Ernie Nevers and
Herb Joesting last Monday at the Rose
Bowl with his passing, punting, and
deadly line smashing.
McCreery and Hyland finished their
football at Stanford by helping to de
molish any chances of the Panthers. The
former Card captain was a strong unit in
the center of the line, while "Tricky
Dick" nearly outshone the highly .touted
Pitt captain. Coach Warner handed
Pittsburgh a surprise to the tune of some
thirty-odd yards when big Seraphim Post
demonstrated to its full advantage the
old guard-around play.
Starting at left end, Johnny Preston
was given a tough dose of Pitt football
when he was first bounced out of bounds,
and then knocked cold by Welch. For

I
over a month. "Tiny" Sellman swallowed
gobs of newspaper sarcasm, but Monday
he gave the scribes ample delight when
he saw personally that Guarino and F"ox
of Pitt were carried off the field. Don

Robesky made a good running mate for
Post until he added a little color to the
game by being expelled from the game
for any one of a number of reasons.
Many grandstand coaches were of the
opinion that gigantic Herb Fleishhacker
should have been drafted when Stanford
had the ball, last down, and one to go.
Warner, nevertheless, kept his big full
back on the bench, and let Hoffman do
the work.
