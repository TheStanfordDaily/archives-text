# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
It is quite natural that hockey, one
of the fastest and most exhilirating
of sports, should attract the attention
of the gridiron heroes once the pig
skin season has ended. Many a foot
hall star lias jumped from moleskins
into th? well-upholstered clothing af
fected by the puck-chasers and car
ried on with scarcely a hreatliing j
spell. The famous Hobey Baker, of
Princeton, was the greatest combina
tion of speed, brains, and skill that
ever shot the puck into the net and
booted the pigskin between the cross
bars.
Right now, on the Dartmouth
hockey team are at least four mem
bers of the Big Green eleven that J
made life so miserable for all its op
ponents except Yale during the 1927
season. Myles Lane, leading scorer in
the East on the gridiron, has just
made a hasty return trip from the
Pacific Coast where he played on the
Eastern All-Star team in the benefit
Christmas Day game. The reason for
Myles' haste was that, as captain of
the Dartmouth hockey team, he had j
to keep a little date with McGill Uni-,
versity on the ice tonight.
In the Dartmouth sextet you will |
see the familiar faces of Eddie Arm
strong, erstwhile right tackle on Jess
Hawley's eleven; H. M. Sherman, a '
former guard, now the goalie; and
E. J. Jeremiah, a halfback who subbed
for the famous A1 Marsters and who

plays right wing when wearing skates.
Many opposing linemen thought he
wore wings while playing halfback
last fall.
Bob McPhail, the ex-football cap
tain, also plays hockey in a Nick
Altrock-Al Schacht sort of way, and
Hardy, another football hero who
graduated last spring, was also a star
at the ice game.
