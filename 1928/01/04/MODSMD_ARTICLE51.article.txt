# MANAGERIAL TRYOUTS FOR STANFORD DAILY TO BEGIN THURSDAY
## 
### 
Managerial tryouts for the Stanford
Daily will be held the first two weeks
of the present quarter, giving an op
portunity for interested students to
learn the work of the advertising de
partment and to compete for salaried

! positions, stated Claude C. Conn, busi- '
j ness manager, yesterday.
The first meeting will be lieli
Thursday at 1 o'clock in the business
i office of the Stanford Daily. For two
I weeks the tryoutees will aid the ad
! vertising managers with office work,
after which period appointments will
be made to a number of staff posi
; tions. It is to be emphasized that '
when the two weeks' trial period is
over, new workers will be on a par i

with those who started in the autumn
quarter.
Staff work consists of collecting
' advertising copy, returning cuts, so
liciting small Arms for advertise
ments, and a certain amount of mer- i
| cliandising work, such as conducting!
advertising surveys for local and na
tional business houses.
New and old members of the staff j
will compete until the end of the year
I for three well-paid advertising posi- j

tions, open to juniors only, covering
I the Palo Alto, San Francisco, and for
j eign advertising fields.
A large turnout is urged, as there
! is work enough for a number of try
| outees.
