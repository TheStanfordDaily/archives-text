# APPOINT M'DOWELL NATIONAL EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEMBER
## 
### 
J. E. McDowell, academic secretary
and alumni secretary, has been ap
pointed Committee Chairman of N.E.A.
relations, in order that a closer con
nection between Stanford University
and the National Education Associa
tion may be made, according to word
received recently from the N.E.A.
This is in accordance with a request
recently sent out by J. W. Crabtree,
secretary of the national organization,
that every college and university in
the United States appoint a repre
sentative to the association.
According to Crabtree, more than
half of the colleges and universities
have already complied with the re
quest. McDowell, as chairman, will
be informed as to the policies of the
Association, and will, in turn, call the
attention of the faculty to important
matters.
The plan for furthering closer re
lations between colleges and the
N.E.A. is being undertaken, because,
according to Crabtree, the college is
at present the weakest link in the
organized profession. He said that
college professors have always been
devoted and loyal to their technical
groups, but they have not, as a rule,
been greatly interested in problems
relating to the larger fraternal wel
fare. Crabtree gives this as one of the
reasons why colleges have been so
slow in readjusting salaries to meet
increased costs and new conditions.
