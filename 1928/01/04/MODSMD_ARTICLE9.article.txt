# PITTSBURGH VARSITY MAY BE VISITORS AT STANFORD THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Possibility that Coach Jock Suther
land's Pittsburgh team will visit the
Stanford campus was foreseen yester
day when it was learned that the
Panthers will be guests of the Stan
ford Club of San Francisco Thursday
noon at a luncheon in their honor in
the Concert Room of the Palace Hotel.
Because of the absence from the
campus yesterday of virtually all the
officials of the Board of Athletic Con-;
trol, it could not be determined when j
the Pittsburgh men could be expected I
here if they do find it possible to j
come to the campus. '
However, it was thought that they j
would arrive tomorrow or on Thurs-'
day after the Stanford Club luncheon. !
