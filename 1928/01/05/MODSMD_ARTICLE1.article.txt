# FRESHMEN WIN FROM VARSITY CAGE PLAYERS
## Babe Hoopsters Outclass Husky Hunt's Veterans In Practice lilt SNYDER, TAMPCKE STAR First Team Forgets Plays in Wild Attempts to Stop Freshmen 
### Merle Emry 
In a free-for-all scrimmage practice
yesterday afternoon five freshman
basketball players twice walked over
the select of the Stanford varsity.
The first time the score was 7 to 2 in
i'avor of the beginners; the second
contest ended in a 19 to 7 score in
their favor.
Led by Snyder and Fawcett, for
wards, and with able support from
Tampeke and Reynolds, guards, the
freshmen, with Hawkins at center,
soon took measure of the first-string
men by running up a three-point lead.
They were exhibiting first-class bas
ketball and had run the score up to
seven when Hunt called them off and
sent in two other teams for scrim
mage work.
Freshmen Show Well
After a sufficient rest period, Hunt
put in yesterday's first-string varsity
men again: Richards and Bryant, for
wards; Clark, center; and Dobson
and Thompson, guards. These men
were pitted for the second time
against the freshmen mentioned
above. Bowers was substituted for
Bryant at forward but that combina
tion failed to stop the determined
babes from scoring.
Most of the freshman shots were
made from the corner. Snyder to
Fawcett and back to Snyder, who
dropped the ball in the hoop, was the
scoring combination. When the var
sity men did have a chance to shoot
they failed to hit the basket.
Varsity Defense Good
The defense of the varsity showed
more reserve than did its offense. The
first-string men forgot their plays;
Ihey forgot to follow up the basket
shots; and they forgot to get in their
playing zones on offense. Coach Hunt
was on the sideline barking himself
hoarse, telling them to rush in on the
offense.
There was an ominous atmosphere
hanging over the Pavilion when the
afternoon's work was stopped. Those
twenty or twenty-five spectators that
saw the scrimmage noticed it and
tried to figure it out. One solution
that was offered was to the effect that
there would be some heavy talking
done by Husky Hunt in the dressing
room or at least before Friday night's
engagement. What might be said was
left to the imagination.

their favor.
Led by Snyder and Fawcett, for
wards, and with able support from
Tampeke and Reynolds, guards, the
freshmen, with Hawkins at center,
soon took measure of the first-string
men by running up a three-point lead.
They were exhibiting first-class bas
ketball and had run the score up to
seven when Hunt called them off and
sent in two other teams for scrim
mage work.
Freshmen Show Well
After a sufficient rest period, Hunt
put in yesterday's first-string varsity
men again: Richards and Bryant, for
wards; Clark, center; and Dobson
and Thompson, guards. These men
were pitted for the second time
against the freshmen mentioned
above. Bowers was substituted for
Bryant at forward but that combina
tion failed to stop the determined
babes from scoring.
Most of the freshman shots were
made from the corner. Snyder to
Fawcett and back to Snyder, who
dropped the ball in the hoop, was the
scoring combination. When the var
sity men did have a chance to shoot
they failed to hit the basket.
Varsity Defense Good
The defense of the varsity showed
more reserve than did its offense. The
first-string men forgot their plays;
Ihey forgot to follow up the basket
shots; and they forgot to get in their
playing zones on offense. Coach Hunt
was on the sideline barking himself
hoarse, telling them to rush in on the
offense.
There was an ominous atmosphere
hanging over the Pavilion when the
afternoon's work was stopped. Those
twenty or twenty-five spectators that
saw the scrimmage noticed it and
tried to figure it out. One solution
that was offered was to the effect that
there would be some heavy talking
done by Husky Hunt in the dressing
room or at least before Friday night's
engagement. What might be said was
left to the imagination.
