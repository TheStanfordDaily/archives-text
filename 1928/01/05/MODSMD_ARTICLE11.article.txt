# SUNKEN SUBMARINE SURRENDERS BODIES OF ILL-FATED CREW
## Divers Penetrate S-4’s Hull Submerged in Hundred Feet of Water 
### 
PROVINCETOWN, Mass., Jan. 4.—
The sunken submarine S-4, lying un
der more than 100 feet of water off
here, began late today to give up its
dead.
Divers, after more than two weeks
of intermittent work, succeeded in
penetrating the hull and brought to
the surface the bodies of three of the
forty men who perished when the S-4
was rammed and sunk by the coast
guard destroyer Spaulding on Dec. 17.
The three bodies already recovered
were found in the engine room com
partment—the first compartment to
be entered.
Attached to a single line, the bodies
were drawn up through the hatch and
placed in a small boat which had
brought stretchers to the scene from
the mother ship Bushnell.
