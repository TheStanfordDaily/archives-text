# SMITH TOUCHES ON NATIONAL QUESTIONS IN ALBANY MESSAGE
## 
### 
ALBANY, N.Y., Jan. 4—(U.P.)—AI
Smith has turned to the homespun
philosophy of Abe Lincoln to fashion
a political creed at a time when he is
being widely discussed as Democratic
presidential timber.
Governor Smith today delivered his
annual message to the legislature of
New York —a message built on his be
lief in a government "of the people,
by the people, and for the people."
This, with a few modern digs at an
issue Lincoln never faced —Prohibi-
tion.
But around Lincolnian principles,
Smith has outlined his national stand,
clearly in preparation for his coming
fight for the Democratic nomination
for president.
The 40,000-word message, the long
est ever written by a New York gov
ernor, touched not only on state, but
important national issues, which
surely will confront every aspirant
for the party's choice.
"Make the people the government"
was his basic theme, expressed as fol
lows :
"The Old World" concept of govern
ment was that the people existed for
the government. The underlying
theory of American democracy is that
the Government exists for the people,
and the Government which is closest
to them and most responsive to the
demands upon it, economically and
efficiently managed, is the best form
of government."
On this basis, Smith took up pro
hibition without referring to the right
or the wrong of the law.
