ST. PAUL, Minn., Jan. 4.—( U.P.) —
Prohibition enforcement during the
year just closed had made one of the
most remarkable gains in the history
of the law, Andrew J. Volstead, father
of the Eighteenth Amendment, de
clared today.
Breaking a silence of three months,
Volstead granted an interview in
which he summed up the effects of
prohibition and expressed his hopes
for the future of the law.
Enforcement is more effective, for
gradually people are becoming less
interested in wet propaganda and are
coming to a better understanding of
the law itself, he said.
Asked if the Eighteenth Amend
ment ever would be repealed, the
Amendment's father said: "I am not
worried about the repeal of the law."
Turning to the question of wet
propaganda, he declared that people
are becoming less interested in the
opponents of prohibition.
"This is becoming more evident
since those who are opposed to pro
hibition have nothing to offer as a
modification or substitute for the
present law," he said. "They frankly
demand repeal, not only of the law,
but of the entire Amendment. People
are not deceived by this sort of talk.
They know that repeal of the law
would mean a return of the corner
saloon," Volstead said.
