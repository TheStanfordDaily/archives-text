# EARLY COMING OF SPRING IS SEEN IN LAGUNITA UPRISING
## 
### 
A cool breeze . . . dipping wil
lows . . . silhouetted against a
silvery moon ... a gliding canoe
. . . quiet strumming of a
uke . . . and . . .
It won't be long now â€”Lagunita
is half full!
Some say that the early flood
is due to the excess of cold water
thrown on the blighted hopes of
the"on pro" army. The more
logical insist that it is thanks to
the new flume system from
Searsville. But who cares or why
so, as long as the lake is assured?
Days of boating, swimming,
canoe queening ahead . . .
And freshmen! Keep both
hands on the paddle!
