# YEARLING BASKETBALL TEAM SCORES WIN IN BATTLE WITH VARSITY
## Squad in Perfect Condition For Tilt With College Of Pacific Friday 
### 
When the freshman basketball team
again decisively defeated the varsity
cagers in a practice scrimmage yes
terday afternoon despite the latter's
Southern California tour and their
own lack of practice, the Cardinal
babes' prospects for a record season
and a victory in their initial game
against the College of Pacific fresh
men next Friday night rose consider
ably.
With the exception of Jim Mears,
'first-string center, who has been laid
up with an injured ankle and will not
be able to play for at least a week,
the squad is in perfect condition, and
has been strengthened with the addi
tion of five new players. Two of these,
Snyder, a forward, and Hepp, a guard,
are of first-string calibre. Snyder, al
though small, plays a wonderful floor
game and misses only a small per
cent of his shots; while Hepp comes
as near to being an "offensive guard"
as possible, playing well down in the
opponents' territory a good part of the
time, but still covering a section under
his own goal.
Mitchell Changes Lineup
Assistant Coach "Muggs" Mitchell
has been working Hawkins out at
center in place of Mears and has
placed Snyder at forward. The prob
able starting lineup for Friday night's
game is Fawcett and Snyder, for- j
wards, Hawkins, center, and Tampcke
and Reynolds, guards.
Joujon-Roche has been playing an
increasingly fast game at forward and i
is almost certain to see action, either
in that position or at center. Free
man, Cook, and Moffatt are three j
other promising forwards whose pres- j
ence makes the forward berths still j
uncertain.
Guards Work Well
Tampcke and Reynolds have the
guard positions pretty well to them
selves, working together so smoothly
that it was all the varsity forwards
could do to get within shooting dis
tance of the babes' goal in yesterday's
scrimmage while this pair was in the
game.
The average size of the freshman
players, as big as it was before, re
ceived a tremendous boost yesterday
when Ehrhorn, a six-foot-five-inch
guard, reported for practice. The new
member of the squad stands well
above all of his teammates and is as
muscular as lie is tall.

are of first-string calibre. Snyder, al
though small, plays a wonderful floor
game and misses only a small per
cent of his shots; while Hepp comes
as near to being an "offensive guard"
as possible, playing well down in the
opponents' territory a good part of the
time, but still covering a section under
his own goal.
Mitchell Changes Lineup
Assistant Coach "Muggs" Mitchell
has been working Hawkins out at
center in place of Mears and has
placed Snyder at forward. The prob
able starting lineup for Friday night's
game is Fawcett and Snyder, for- j
wards, Hawkins, center, and Tampcke
and Reynolds, guards.
Joujon-Roche has been playing an
increasingly fast game at forward and i
is almost certain to see action, either
in that position or at center. Free
man, Cook, and Moffatt are three j
other promising forwards whose pres- j
ence makes the forward berths still j
uncertain.
Guards Work Well
Tampcke and Reynolds have the
guard positions pretty well to them
selves, working together so smoothly
that it was all the varsity forwards
could do to get within shooting dis
tance of the babes' goal in yesterday's
scrimmage while this pair was in the
game.
The average size of the freshman
players, as big as it was before, re
ceived a tremendous boost yesterday
when Ehrhorn, a six-foot-five-inch
guard, reported for practice. The new
member of the squad stands well
above all of his teammates and is as
muscular as lie is tall.
When the freshman basketball team
again decisively defeated the varsity
cagers in a practice scrimmage yes
terday afternoon despite the latter's
Southern California tour and their
own lack of practice, the Cardinal
babes' prospects for a record season
and a victory in their initial game
against the College of Pacific fresh
men next Friday night rose consider
ably.
With the exception of Jim Mears,
'first-string center, who has been laid
up with an injured ankle and will not
be able to play for at least a week,
the squad is in perfect condition, and
has been strengthened with the addi
tion of five new players. Two of these,
Snyder, a forward, and Hepp, a guard,
are of first-string calibre. Snyder, al
though small, plays a wonderful floor
game and misses only a small per
cent of his shots; while Hepp comes
as near to being an "offensive guard"
as possible, playing well down in the
opponents' territory a good part of the
time, but still covering a section under
his own goal.
