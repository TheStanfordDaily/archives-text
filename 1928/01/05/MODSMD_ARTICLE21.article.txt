# ADDITIONAL TIME FOR REGISTRATION PROVES AID TO LATE COMERS
## 
### 
Over 175 students were saved from I
. the payment of a $2 late registration
j fine because of extension of the clos
ing time of the Registrar's office from
5 until o'clock yesterday. The Regis
i trar's office, which was at first, frankly
j dubious at the necessity of maintain
' ing the late hours, now feels amply
! repaid for their accommodation.
There was some misunderstanding
i about the ruling that only students j
who had their study lists approved
during the pre-registration period
were eligible for the after-liour en
rolling. According to Registrar J. P.
Mitchell, several such cases appeared
but had to pay the usual line.
