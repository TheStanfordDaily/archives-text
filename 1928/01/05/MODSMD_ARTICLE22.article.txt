# HICKMAN AGAIN SHOWS AS FOX WITH SLY PLEA
## Killer Regains Confidence; Displays Flashes of Indifference MAY CHEAT GALLOWS A.S. Keyes Asserts Complete Evidence Sufficient to Hang Murderer 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 4.— (U.P.) —
He was "The Fox, very cunning and
sly, you know," when he kidnapped,
murdered, and mutilated Marion Par
ker and wrote ransom letters to her
father.
Legal circles were convinced to
night that William Edward Hickman
was again "The Fox" as he pleaded
"not guilty by reason of insanity"
when lie answered the indictments
charging him with the hideous crimes.
For in so doing Hickman admitted
the commission of the deeds but he
found a possible escape from the gal
lows and he picked a loophole in Cali
fornia law which may gain him free
dom.
The opinion that Hickman had
picked his best possible defense and
one that might set him on the street
within a year was advanced by Attor
ney S. S. Hahn in conjunction with
several Los Angeles Superior Court
judges.
Should Hickman be able to con
vince a jury that he was insane at
the time he abducted the 12-year-old
girl and cut her body to pieces he
would be committed to a state asylum
for the criminally defective. A year
later if he could prove to the satisfac
tion of the court he had regained his
sanity he would be liable to dismissal
from the institution.
State prosecutors evidenced little
interest in the new development, Dis
trict Attorney Keyes asserting the
case was complete against Hickman
and that he would surely hang.
