# Bill Brogan Drops In
## 
### 
Bill Brogan, who used to be known as the last survivor of the clan
of Stanford roughs in the "good old days," dropped into the office yes
terday. Bill hadn't been on the campus since the spring of 1924, when
Don Liebendorfer was editor of the Daily. For the past three years he's
been working at a mining camp in Northern California, and, as he puts
it, he's "been sorta out of touch with the Farm."
"Me kid brother," complained Bill, "wrote me about this Registration
Dance where the roughs are going to get the cold shoulder. What's the
old place coming to ? \\ hen the old gang was around here they wouldn't
have stood for anything like that. My Gawd, is the Farm gettin' to be
nothing but a country club for queeners and golf knicker boys? Aren't
there any more roughs around ?"
We assured him that some still remained and suggested that he visit
the Engineering Corner or the Law Steps.
Said Bill, taking our tin of tobacco ami starting for the door, "Just
the same, the kid brother and 1 are going to rough it to that dance. You
can put that in your pipe and smoke it."
