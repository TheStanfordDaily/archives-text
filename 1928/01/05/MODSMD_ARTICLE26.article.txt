On page 1 will be found a letter from the office of the District At
torney for Santa Clara County which we trust will clarify the automo
bile situation on the campus. It is the opinion of that office that forty
miles per hour is permissible for Palm Drive which is regarded as a
"public highway. At all intersections the 15 miles per hour rule must
be observed.
Judge Maxwell's decision of a couple of months ago may be regarded
as without effect. However, as is pointed out in the letter from Assistant
District Attorney C. C. Cottrell, a test case would be necessary to legally
establish the opinions cited. So far as the incident may concern the aver
age student now, the matter may be regarded as closed.
