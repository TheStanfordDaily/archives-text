RUMORS, RUMORS!
"A certain student, who must have
signed the pledge in his registration
book with his Angers crossed, took
advantage of his foresight and pro
cured copies of those examinations.
Being commercially minded as well
as ingenious, he allowed such people
who felt the need of a little intensive
preparation for the final to see the
papers upon the payment of a small
fee. As a result the class average was
96.32, and several uninformed Phi
Betes like me got D's.
"The guys in that course knew too
well what was comin' up on the final.
The prof must have been surprised
after figuring on flunking the class.
—and saw the clown exhuming
pertinent information from a notebook
during the examination."
Think nothing of all this. We are
merely repeating a few of the multi
tudinous rumors which have been
going the rounds on the campus since
the end of last quarter. There are a
lot more, but to state them would cor
rupt the freshmen, who must be kept
ignorant of such student activities as
long as possible.
In the face of so many rumors, one
would almost be inclined to think
there were some honor system viola

tions around December 16. There
were.
As we are at heart Puritans, such a
situation peeves us. While we can
| sympathize with (but not exonerate)
! the poor bozos who are on the verge
| of flunking out and need to have a
' little accurate information convenient
j ly at hand in order to stay in school,
.we are thoroughly against anyone
; with better than a good strong D— in
, a course who employs deception. The
I reason for being perturbed at such
j methods are purely materialistic. Af
-1 ter several members of a class have
held a seminar on one of the Quad
j benches and come fack to their quiz
full of enthusiasm and enlightenment
the class average automatically goes
up. When the class average goes up,
| someone gets slickered. When one
; does get slickered, he feels disgusted.
1 And he might be us.
Sometimes, when we see extensive
quotations from various sources crude
ly apparent on examination papers,
; we long for the old days, when, as old
grads tell us, one had to show con
| siderable finesse to write a good paper
synthetically.
But why think about the good old
days—they may come back, if the
1 Honor System breaks down. —F.M.

1 Honor System breaks down. —F.M.
RUMORS, RUMORS!
"A certain student, who must have
signed the pledge in his registration
book with his Angers crossed, took
advantage of his foresight and pro
cured copies of those examinations.
Being commercially minded as well
as ingenious, he allowed such people
who felt the need of a little intensive
preparation for the final to see the
papers upon the payment of a small
fee. As a result the class average was
96.32, and several uninformed Phi
Betes like me got D's.
"The guys in that course knew too
well what was comin' up on the final.
The prof must have been surprised
after figuring on flunking the class.
—and saw the clown exhuming
pertinent information from a notebook
during the examination."
Think nothing of all this. We are
merely repeating a few of the multi
tudinous rumors which have been
going the rounds on the campus since
the end of last quarter. There are a
lot more, but to state them would cor
rupt the freshmen, who must be kept
ignorant of such student activities as
long as possible.
In the face of so many rumors, one
would almost be inclined to think
there were some honor system viola

tions around December 16. There
were.
As we are at heart Puritans, such a
situation peeves us. While we can

up. When the class average goes up,

Sometimes, when we see extensive
quotations from various sources crude

synthetically.
But why think about the good old
days—they may come back, if the
