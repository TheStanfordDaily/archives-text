''The Lordly Ones," by B. H. Lehman.
Harper & Bros., New York. 1927.
As Gertrude Atherton has said of
this second novel of Professor Leh
man, "it required tremendous courage
to make your heroine a woman of
sixty," and she adds that "you got
away with it."
Kate Willow, whose years approach
three score, and Roger Morley, the
forty-seven-year-old college president,
are presumably the principal charac
ters, whose actions, the author de
fines and describes. But. the grandson
|of Kate, a young instructor, and the
| daughter of Roger, an undergraduate
at the college over which Roger pre
sides, give to the novel something of
the spirit of youth. The love story of
these two young people, although it
is subordinate to that concerning the
ambiguous amorous relations of Roger
and Kate, is probably of more inter
est, having more naive appeal than
that of the older persons.
Often in the course of the narrative,
Lehman shows an extraordinary ap
preciation of metaphorical figures
that are unique. Roger is thinking of
his loved one, and thus "filled his j
whole firmament as angelic presences I

| fill the heaven about Raphael's Ma
donna in Dresden."
The novel is easy to read. There is
little that is complex or enigmatically
' subtle. Since it concerns college stu
dents as well as the more austere per
. son of the president of an institution
iof the so-called higher learning, those
! who are now undergraduates would
be quite likely to appreciate the vol
ume. It is to a degree aphrodisiac.
