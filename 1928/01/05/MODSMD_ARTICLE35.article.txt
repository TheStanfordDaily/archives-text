# Adoption of Galoshes to Speed Up Basketball Men
## 
### 
DELAWARE, 0., Jan. 4.— (U.P.)—
Galoshes are in vogue this winter at
Ohio Wesleyan University—as far as
the basketball team is concerned.
Coach Ray Detrick, basketball men- j
tor, insists that his men wear the
ungainly "mud guards" during tlie day
for more than one reason.
Detrick, who has turned out several
Ohio Conference championship teams,
says the galoshes not only protect the
wearers from colds, but make the
players faster on the floor.
His theory is that after wearing the
heavy overshoes for some time, the
change to light basketball shoes
makes their feet feel lighter and en
hances their footwork. *
