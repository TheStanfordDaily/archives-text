# SCREEN'S MOST PERFECT LOVER IS INTERVIEWED LEW CODY SAYS "MAKE PERSONAL APPEARANCES" STAR FINISHES THREE MONTHS' TOUR OF COUNTRY
## 
### Ben Maddox, Jr 
Lew Cody thinks movie stars should
make personal appearance tours eyery
two or three years to make new
friends and greet old ones. He is
headlining the hill at the San Fran
cisco Orpheum this week, and the
box office man says all the flappers
in the city are storming the theatre.
Read on and I'll tell you what the
screen's most sophisticated lover told
me last night in a hackstage "in the
flesh" interview. Lew speaks with
ease and very unaffectedly, both of
which qualities are rare among pic
ture people. Most film stars, you
know, should he seen but never, never
heard!

"Movie stars ought to get about and
meet the public face to face. I have
just completed a three months' vaude
ville tour which took me through all
the large Eastern cities and as far
west as Kansas City. San Francisco
and Los Angeles are the only places
I am playing in the West."
Lew had such a bad cold and hoarse
voice that he had to shorten his net
last night to a mere "Hello." "But
the audience was wonderful," he ex
plained in a near-whisper. "Though
they had paid their money for a full
length act they understood I couldn't
go through with it tonight." •
Although scarcely able to talk, he

did outline his immediate plans. "I've
given up the idea of producing my
own films and I've re-signed a long
term contract with Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer. As soon as I finish my act
next week I will start on a new pic
ture. What it will be I don't know.
"I3ut I want to go on playing in the
movies—as long as they like me!"
Made Marriage Farces
Before leaving the studios for this
stage tour, Lew was making a series
of marriage farces in which he co
starred with Aileen Pringle, a San
Francisco girl. This team proved so
popular that it is possible M.-G.-M.
will use them together again. Lew
once upon a time played villains. Now
that theatregoers no longer demand
sheikish heroes he, along with
Adolphe Menjou, is being widely ad
vertised as a "perfect lover."
Lew is a college man, too. He
graduated from McGill University, in
Canada, as a doctor. But the theatre
had a much greater allure for him
than a hospital!
In private life —if a movie star is
ever permitted one —he is the hus
band of Mabel Normand, one of the
best-known screen comediennes. She
did not accompany him on his vaude
ville tour.
Even if he is a "perfect lover" you'd
like him—because off-screen he does
n't act like one!

Made Marriage Farces
Before leaving the studios for this
stage tour, Lew was making a series
of marriage farces in which he co
starred with Aileen Pringle, a San
Francisco girl. This team proved so
popular that it is possible M.-G.-M.
will use them together again. Lew
once upon a time played villains. Now
that theatregoers no longer demand
sheikish heroes he, along with
Adolphe Menjou, is being widely ad
vertised as a "perfect lover."
Lew is a college man, too. He
graduated from McGill University, in
Canada, as a doctor. But the theatre
had a much greater allure for him
than a hospital!
In private life —if a movie star is
ever permitted one —he is the hus
band of Mabel Normand, one of the
best-known screen comediennes. She
did not accompany him on his vaude
ville tour.
Even if he is a "perfect lover" you'd
like him—because off-screen he does
n't act like one!
Lew Cody thinks movie stars should
make personal appearance tours eyery
two or three years to make new
friends and greet old ones. He is
headlining the hill at the San Fran
cisco Orpheum this week, and the
box office man says all the flappers
in the city are storming the theatre.
Read on and I'll tell you what the
screen's most sophisticated lover told
me last night in a hackstage "in the
flesh" interview. Lew speaks with
ease and very unaffectedly, both of
which qualities are rare among pic
ture people. Most film stars, you
know, should he seen but never, never
heard!

"Movie stars ought to get about and
meet the public face to face. I have
just completed a three months' vaude
ville tour which took me through all
the large Eastern cities and as far
west as Kansas City. San Francisco
and Los Angeles are the only places
I am playing in the West."
Lew had such a bad cold and hoarse
voice that he had to shorten his net
last night to a mere "Hello." "But
the audience was wonderful," he ex
plained in a near-whisper. "Though
they had paid their money for a full
length act they understood I couldn't
go through with it tonight." •
Although scarcely able to talk, he

did outline his immediate plans. "I've
given up the idea of producing my
own films and I've re-signed a long
term contract with Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer. As soon as I finish my act
next week I will start on a new pic
ture. What it will be I don't know.
