# Santa Clara County Attorney's Office Holds Forty-Mile Speed Limit for Cars on Palm Drive
## 
### 
Summary of the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Of
fice opinions:
1. Stanford is not a "business
district" (op state university)
and hence the 20 mile per hour
limit should not apply.
2. Palm Drive is a "public
highway" and the speed of 40
miles per hour is permissible
except at intersections.

Following is the opinion of the of
fice of District Attorney of Santa
Clara County located at San Jose of
the automobile situation on the cam
pus. The Daily has obtained this opin
ion through the efforts of C. C. Cott
rell, assistant district attorney, in
order that the students may have an
authoritative clarification of the diffi
culties:
The Editor,
The Stanford Daily
Dear Sir:
You have requested that this office
give you an opinion relative to speed
laws on the Stanford Campus. It
seems that there has been some con
fusion relative to the speed laws ap
plying to the roads on the Campus
and particularly to the speed laws ap
plicable to Palm Drive and similar
roads upon the Campus. A final set :
tlement of any honest dispute can

j only come from the Court through a
i test case but it is hoped that this
! letter may throw some light upon the
i subject and avoid the necessity of a
I test case.
Not State University
In the first place it seems necessary
j to clarify matters with reference to
Section 114(a) of the Motor Vehicle
Act. This section in part reads as fol
lows: "All roads and highways within
the grounds of a state university or
state, county or municipal institution
shall be deemed to be within a busi
ness district for the purposes of this
act." Stanford in our opinion is not
I a state university and, therefore,
! speeds prescribed for a "business dis
trict" as defined in the Motor Vehicle
Act, do not apply to roads upon the
Stanford Campus.
The next consideration is to deter
mine what speed laws, if any, govern
the roads mentioned. This is best de
termined by answering the following
question: Are the roads on the Stan
i/ford Campus "private roads" or "Pub
lic highways"? If we find that they
ore "private roads" then the Motor
Vehicle Act does not apply and the
speed permitted on the Campus is a
problem for the University authori
ties. If the roads in question are "pub
lic highways" then the Motor Vehicle
Act does apply and fixes the speeds
j permitted at certain places thereon.
Drive Is Public Road
It is the opinion of this office that
' the roads such as Palm Drive are
| "public highways" within the mean
i ing of the Motor Vehicle Act. In ar-
