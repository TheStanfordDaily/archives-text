# Santa Clara County Attorney's Office Holds Forty-Mile Speed Limit for Cars on Palm Drive
## 
### 
Summary of the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Of
fice opinions:
1. Stanford is not a "business
district" (op state university)
and hence the 20 mile per hour
limit should not apply.
2. Palm Drive is a "public
highway" and the speed of 40
miles per hour is permissible
except at intersections.

Following is the opinion of the of
fice of District Attorney of Santa
Clara County located at San Jose of
the automobile situation on the cam
pus. The Daily has obtained this opin
ion through the efforts of C. C. Cott
rell, assistant district attorney, in
order that the students may have an
authoritative clarification of the diffi
culties:
The Editor,
The Stanford Daily
Dear Sir:
You have requested that this office
give you an opinion relative to speed
laws on the Stanford Campus. It
seems that there has been some con
fusion relative to the speed laws ap
plying to the roads on the Campus
and particularly to the speed laws ap
plicable to Palm Drive and similar
roads upon the Campus. A final set :
tlement of any honest dispute can

j only come from the Court through a
i test case but it is hoped that this
! letter may throw some light upon the
i subject and avoid the necessity of a
I test case.
Not State University
In the first place it seems necessary
j to clarify matters with reference to
Section 114(a) of the Motor Vehicle
Act. This section in part reads as fol
lows: "All roads and highways within
the grounds of a state university or
state, county or municipal institution
shall be deemed to be within a busi
ness district for the purposes of this
act." Stanford in our opinion is not
I a state university and, therefore,
! speeds prescribed for a "business dis
trict" as defined in the Motor Vehicle
Act, do not apply to roads upon the
Stanford Campus.
The next consideration is to deter
mine what speed laws, if any, govern
the roads mentioned. This is best de
termined by answering the following
question: Are the roads on the Stan
i/ford Campus "private roads" or "Pub
lic highways"? If we find that they
ore "private roads" then the Motor
Vehicle Act does not apply and the
speed permitted on the Campus is a
problem for the University authori
ties. If the roads in question are "pub
lic highways" then the Motor Vehicle
Act does apply and fixes the speeds
j permitted at certain places thereon.
Drive Is Public Road
It is the opinion of this office that
' the roads such as Palm Drive are
| "public highways" within the mean
i ing of the Motor Vehicle Act. In ar-
riving at this conclusion we have con
sidered the two definitions therein
given defining "private roadways" and
"public highways." Section 22 of the
Motor Vehicle Act defines a "private
load way" as follows: "Every private
road, driveway or place used by the
owner, his guests and those having
business with the owner and not in
tended to lie otherwise used, or other
wise used by the general public.'"
Section 21 of the same Act defines a
"public highway" as follows: ". . .
The term "public highway" shall ap
ply to and include driveways upon the
grounds of universities, colleges,
schools and institutions. The term
"public highway" shall not be deemed
to include private driveways, roads or
places used by the owner, his guests
and those having business with the
owner, and not intended to be other
wise used, or otherwise used by the
general public."
Roads Chained One Oay
From the above two definitions and
the nature of the use of the roads in
question it would take a peculiar
twist of the reasoning power to say
that the roads are "private roads or
driveways" within the meaning of the
Motor Vehicle Act. The roads in ques
tion are held out to the public gen
erally for use except for one day each
year when the roads are chained to
prevent any adverse rights by usage
from attaching to the Campus roads.
This fact does not in our opinion
prevent the roads from being "public
highways" within the meaning of the
Motor Vehicle Act during the time
that they are held out to the public
generally for use.
Our conclusion being that the roads
herein mentioned are "public high
ways" within the meaning of the Mo
tor Vehicle Act it follows that the
speed permissable on the roads re
ferred to is forty miles per hour ex
cept at intersections where the speed
limit is fifteen miles per hour.
We trust that the above is helpful
in clearing away any confusion on the
question of speed. We have not
touched upon the question of speed in
and about the university buildings and
dwellings for we understand that
there is no dispute over speed in these
sections of the campus.
