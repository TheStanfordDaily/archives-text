# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Cleveland, the team that finished a
close second in 1926 and a poor sixth
in 1927, seems to have acquired such j
a preponderance of baseball brains |
in the acquisition of Billy Evans as
general manager and Roger Peckin
paugh as manager that it is hard to
see how they will not be "master
minded" right into a pennant without
the athletes themselves doing any
thinking or worrying, or both.
And think what a loss to the staff
of American League umpires and the
Amalgamated Association of Short
stops of the world! Billy Evans, who
had umped fearlessly arid well for
more than twenty years, gone from
the fold to "supervise" a second-divi
sion team, and Roger Peckinpaugh,
who had short-stopped ever since
Pecks have had paughs, will either
warm the bench or play second base.
Funny thing, but the Sage of Woos- i
