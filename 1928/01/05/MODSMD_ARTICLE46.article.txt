WASHINGTON, Jan. 4—A state
ment of prospects requires a short
catalogue of the economic forces
which dominate the business situa
tion at our entry into the new year.
The more general of these forces,
•of course, include the credit situation,
the degree of accumulated stocks of
tfoods or speculation in them, the size
of the crops, the rate of wages, the
outlook in labor relations and employ
ment, the prospects of foreign trade,
and to these also need be added the
particular forces in motion in the dif
ferent major industries.
Low Rate Credit
Upon these points it may be said
that there is an ample supply of
credits at low rates; the somewhat
larger stock of goods which were ac
cumulated during the summer are be
ing reduced; there is no consequen
tial speculation in commodities; the
crops have been abundant; wages are
at a high level; we are recovering
from some partial unemployment, es
pecially in the automobile industry.
There is peace in most sections of
the labor world except bituminous
coal; there is more peace in the inter
national world than at any time since
the war; the foreign world is recover
ing its economic strength and buying
power, therefore our foreign trade is
steadily increasing. The phenomena
usually accredited as premonitory of
a slump are, therefore, absent.
Production Great
Despite decreasing prices, produc
tion and consumption of manufactured
commodities have been maintained at
a high level, as shown by car loadings
of class of goods, which have been
aoout equal to those of last year.
As to particular industries, agricul
ture, textiles, bituminous coal, and
some Tr.r!.al3 —still lag behind the
others. The contracts let for future
execution in the construction indus
tries are at. as high level as at this
time a year ago.
Taken in a broad sense, we enter
the new year with the forces of sta
bility dominant in the business world.
