Herbert Hoover, '95, will announce
his candidacy for the Republican
nomination for president of the Uni
ted States at the earliest opportune
moment, in the opinion of William H.
Crocker, National Republican Com
mitteeman from California and presi
dent of the Crocker First National
Bank in San Francisco.
"Although Hoover has, I believe,
not formally announced that he would
be a candidate for president, I feel
lie is in reality a candidate. We pre
sume that when the right time comes
he will make a public announcement
to that effect," said Crocker, speak
iug for himself and J. B. Lanfield,
who accompanied him on his Eastern
trip a short time ago when the con
vention city for the Republican Na
tional Convention was chosen.
Hoover Feeling Strong
"I am, of course, for Mr. Hoover for
president and I sincerely hope that
he will secure the Republican nomina
tion at the convention next June,"
Crocker continued.
"While I was in the East, I heard a
great deal of talk for Hoover. Person
ally, I am for him without reserva
tion. From observations I have made
during my Eastern trip, I believe that
Hoover is today the strongest tenta
tive candidate in the field.
"I think that the New York state
delegation to the convention will go
uninstructed and further it is my
opinion that a great many of its mem
bers will cast their votes for Hoover.
In the absence of Hughes 01* native
sons, I feel that Hoover will get most
of the New York vote."
Crocker was asked why he consid
ered Hoover the man most nearly
fitted for the Presidency of the United
States.
"He is the one man in the field,

who by his experience and his occu
pancy of a cabinet post under Cool
idge, is most qualified to carry on the
policies which have been so satisfac
tory to all parties during the incum
bent administration of President
Coolidge.
"Not only can we assume that
Hoover will do as Coolidge has done,
merely because Hoover has, generally
speaking, such ideas as has Coolidge,
but we must also realize that Hoover
has had a very important part in the
whole policy of Coolidge, as Secretary
of Commerce in the latter'-* cabinet,
lie is even now an integral and es
sential part of present Coolidge man
agcraent. Consequently, he *s the best
man for the job that Coolidge now
fills so well," Lanfield added, supple
menting Crocker's statement.

ted States at the earliest opportune
moment, in the opinion of William H.
Crocker, National Republican Com
mitteeman from California and presi
dent of the Crocker First National
Bank in San Francisco.
"Although Hoover has, I believe,
not formally announced that he would
be a candidate for president, I feel
lie is in reality a candidate. We pre
sume that when the right time comes
he will make a public announcement
to that effect," said Crocker, speak
iug for himself and J. B. Lanfield,
who accompanied him on his Eastern
trip a short time ago when the con
vention city for the Republican Na
tional Convention was chosen.
Hoover Feeling Strong
"I am, of course, for Mr. Hoover for
president and I sincerely hope that
he will secure the Republican nomina
tion at the convention next June,"
Crocker continued.
"While I was in the East, I heard a
great deal of talk for Hoover. Person
ally, I am for him without reserva
tion. From observations I have made
during my Eastern trip, I believe that
Hoover is today the strongest tenta
tive candidate in the field.
"I think that the New York state
delegation to the convention will go
uninstructed and further it is my
opinion that a great many of its mem
bers will cast their votes for Hoover.
In the absence of Hughes 01* native
sons, I feel that Hoover will get most
of the New York vote."
Crocker was asked why he consid
ered Hoover the man most nearly
fitted for the Presidency of the United
States.
"He is the one man in the field,

who by his experience and his occu
pancy of a cabinet post under Cool
idge, is most qualified to carry on the
policies which have been so satisfac
tory to all parties during the incum
bent administration of President
Coolidge.
"Not only can we assume that
Hoover will do as Coolidge has done,
merely because Hoover has, generally
speaking, such ideas as has Coolidge,
but we must also realize that Hoover
has had a very important part in the
whole policy of Coolidge, as Secretary
of Commerce in the latter'-* cabinet,
lie is even now an integral and es
sential part of present Coolidge man
agcraent. Consequently, he *s the best
man for the job that Coolidge now
fills so well," Lanfield added, supple
menting Crocker's statement.
