# FINISH PRELIMINARY WORK ON SERIES OF MURAL HOOP GAMES
## Davis Needs More Officials, Students Qualified for Refereeing Posts 
### 
With only four days before the
start of the annual intramural basket
ball tournament, preliminary prepara
tions for the series have been practi
cally completed by Charles W. Davis,
director of intramural athletics, and
the intramural committee.
Davis now needs only a sufficient
number of officials to insure adequate
refereeing. He has asked that any
men in the University, especially ex
perienced upper division students, who
are interested in acting as referees,
should speak to him before the end
of the week.
Several Strong Teams
Although it is impossible to weigh
the chances of any of the teams until
the strength of Encina and independ
ent quintets has been determined, sev
eral groups are putting into the field
teams which will undoubtedly make
strong bids for the title.
The Breakers and Sigma Chi have
excellent chances to meet again in the
finals, although each has lost a star
performer of last year to the varsity.
Sigma Chi will probably find most of
its trouble at the hands of the Chi
Psi's, while the Alpha Delt's may
upset the Breakers.
Kappa Alpha, El Cuadro, and Phi
Delta Theta may so tie each other up
that a weaker team can run off with
the League I honors. The same is
almost true in League IV, where the
Betas and the Dekes will have to
fight out the title.
S.A.E.'s Are Threat
A great race is promised between
the Indians and S.A.E. The fraternity,
always producing a strong team, has
already won the championship once,
while the Indians were one of the
most powerful teams entered in 1927.
Los Arcos, if it can cope with the
proverbial strength of the Encina
Basement, has a good chance to grab
the honors in League VII, since the
other teams at the present time lp
pear of equal strength.
League V has all the makings of a
close race, since Zeta Psi, the favo
rites, will receive all kinds of competi
tion from El Campo and Delta Chi.
A rather similar deadlock may occur
in League VIII, where A.K.L. can look
for trouble to Phi Sigma Kappa and
Phi Kappa Sigma.
With such unknowns as the Fight
ing Phi Betes and the Business Men,
League IX remains a dense puzzle.
Sigma Nu is strong, but so is El
Tigre, while Kappa Sigma is not much
behind.

the League I honors. The same is
almost true in League IV, where the
Betas and the Dekes will have to
fight out the title.
S.A.E.'s Are Threat
A great race is promised between
the Indians and S.A.E. The fraternity,
always producing a strong team, has
already won the championship once,
while the Indians were one of the
most powerful teams entered in 1927.
Los Arcos, if it can cope with the
proverbial strength of the Encina
Basement, has a good chance to grab
the honors in League VII, since the
other teams at the present time lp
pear of equal strength.
League V has all the makings of a
close race, since Zeta Psi, the favo
rites, will receive all kinds of competi
tion from El Campo and Delta Chi.
A rather similar deadlock may occur
in League VIII, where A.K.L. can look
for trouble to Phi Sigma Kappa and
Phi Kappa Sigma.
With such unknowns as the Fight
ing Phi Betes and the Business Men,
League IX remains a dense puzzle.
Sigma Nu is strong, but so is El
Tigre, while Kappa Sigma is not much
behind.
With only four days before the
start of the annual intramural basket
ball tournament, preliminary prepara
tions for the series have been practi
cally completed by Charles W. Davis,
director of intramural athletics, and
the intramural committee.
Davis now needs only a sufficient
number of officials to insure adequate
refereeing. He has asked that any
men in the University, especially ex
perienced upper division students, who
are interested in acting as referees,
should speak to him before the end
of the week.
Several Strong Teams
Although it is impossible to weigh
the chances of any of the teams until
the strength of Encina and independ
ent quintets has been determined, sev
eral groups are putting into the field
teams which will undoubtedly make
strong bids for the title.
The Breakers and Sigma Chi have
excellent chances to meet again in the
finals, although each has lost a star
performer of last year to the varsity.
Sigma Chi will probably find most of
its trouble at the hands of the Chi
Psi's, while the Alpha Delt's may
upset the Breakers.
Kappa Alpha, El Cuadro, and Phi
Delta Theta may so tie each other up
that a weaker team can run off with
the League I honors. The same is
almost true in League IV, where the
Betas and the Dekes will have to
fight out the title.
