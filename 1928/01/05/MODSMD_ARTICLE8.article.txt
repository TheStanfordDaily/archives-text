# MANAGERIAL TRYOUTS FOR STANFORD DAILY TO CONTINUE TODAY
## 
### 
Sophomore tryoutees for managerial
positions on the Stanford Daily are
requested by Claude C. Conn, business
manager, to be present, at the meet
ing which will be held in the Daily
office at 1 o'clock today. Both men
and women who are interested in
learning the work of the advertising
department are urged to try out for a
position on the staff, many of which
are salaried. Women who are not able
to report at this time because of
rushing activities may come at 2
o'clock.
During the first two weeks of this
quarter the tryoutees will aid the ad
vertising managers with office work,
after which period appointments will
be made to a number of staff posi
tions. The staff work consists of col
lecting advertising copy, returning
cuts, soliciting small firms for adver
tising, and a certain amount of mer
chandising work.
According to Conn an associate
managership is now open to senior
women who have worked on the staff
in their sophomore year and held a
junior position in the junior year. The
holder of this position will have
charge of all accounting and mer
chandising work.
