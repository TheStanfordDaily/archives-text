j Dear Sirs:
I am a prodigal son.
I began pipe-smoking with Edge- !
! worth. But after a while I began to
wander, trying other tobaccos, experi- j
menting to see if there were any better j
tobacco for the pipe.
I have tried most of the best known !
brands and a number of the more ob- |
scure, both imported and domestic, |
but they didn't suit.
So now I have returned —I am using •
Edgeworth again, satisfied that no j
better tobacco is made.
"And the prodigal son partook of !
the fatted calf"; I bought a new pipe j
I when I returned to Edgeworth. j
With many thanks for my cool, mel- j
low, sweet smokes, I am,
Very truly yours,
"H. D."
Edgeworth
