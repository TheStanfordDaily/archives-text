# COOPERATIVE BUYING PLAN ADOPTED BY HOUSES, CLUB
## Thirty-Three Living Groups Enter Association to Purchase Supplies PRICE SAVING FORESEEN El Campo Only Eating Club To Join; Comptroller to Aid in Organization 
### 
Plans for co-operative marketing
among the various living groups were
completed last night in the Kappa
Sigma house at a committee meeting
of the Students Co-operative Purchas
ing Association.
The meeting was attended by El
liott H. Ayres, manager of the asso
ciation, and representatives of the
different organizations, which at the
present time include all the sororities,
twenty-two fraternities, and the El
Campo Club. Bi-weekly orders for pro
visions were placed with Chairman
David S. Adams, and problems of buy
ing, storing, and distributing the prod
ucts were discussed.
Quantity buying resulting in dis
count of bills for food and general
provisions is the aim of the associa
tion. Several attempts for the inaugu
ration of such an arrangement have
been made at times during the past
fifteen years, but all have failed, due
to lack of continued co-operation be
tween its members. The present plan
was first organized during the autumn
quarter by Comptroller A. E. Roth
and different groups that favored such
a plan.
"It is hoped," according to Comp
troller Roth, "that the arrangement
will not only result in a considerable
saving to the fraternities, sororites,
and clubs, but will insure them of a
better quality of product. Incidentally,
it is also hoped that it may result in
a more systematic handling of the
business affairs of the different units.
Comptroller to Aid
"The Comptroller's office stands
ready at any time to assist in organ
izing a system of bookkeeping and
management to be followed by the
individual houses, in an effort to pre
vent the difficulties that arise from
change of management. Somewhat j
similar schemes of purchasing have
been successfully conducted at other
universities, and there is no reason
why it should not work out at Stan
ford if all the units will co-operate
as they have indicated they will."
Under the present arrangement, the I
University guarantees prompt pay-!
ment for supplies and actually makes (
the purchases, securing for the indi- j
vidual units the advantages which j
some with quantity purchasing. A de- 1
posit of $250 is required from the 1
groups by the University as a partial j
guarantee that accounts will be paid '
on time. Above this, a $10 fee is re- 1
quired for the purchasing of operat- j
ing equipment. Expenses of operation I
will be handled by a slight "markup"
on the prices of goods. All profits
are to be distributed to the members
of the association in proportion to
the gross amount purchased and will
be credited to their accounts at the
beginning of the autumn quarter.
Until the association becomes es
tablished, no perishable goods such!
as meats and vegetables can be pur
chased under this plan. Orders are 1
to be received by the manager on the J
fourth and eighteenth of each month, i
and goods will be delivered by the
association on or before the tenth or
twenty-fifth of each month. Monthly'
statements will be sent to each house
manager with a penalty of five per j
cent if payment of the bill is delin-1
quent.

tween its members. The present plan
was first organized during the autumn
quarter by Comptroller A. E. Roth
and different groups that favored such
a plan.
"It is hoped," according to Comp
troller Roth, "that the arrangement
will not only result in a considerable
saving to the fraternities, sororites,
and clubs, but will insure them of a
better quality of product. Incidentally,
it is also hoped that it may result in
a more systematic handling of the
business affairs of the different units.
Comptroller to Aid
"The Comptroller's office stands
ready at any time to assist in organ
izing a system of bookkeeping and
management to be followed by the
individual houses, in an effort to pre
vent the difficulties that arise from
change of management. Somewhat j
similar schemes of purchasing have
been successfully conducted at other
universities, and there is no reason
why it should not work out at Stan
ford if all the units will co-operate
as they have indicated they will."
Under the present arrangement, the I
University guarantees prompt pay-!
ment for supplies and actually makes (
the purchases, securing for the indi- j
vidual units the advantages which j
some with quantity purchasing. A de- 1
posit of $250 is required from the 1
groups by the University as a partial j
guarantee that accounts will be paid '
on time. Above this, a $10 fee is re- 1
quired for the purchasing of operat- j
ing equipment. Expenses of operation I
will be handled by a slight "markup"
on the prices of goods. All profits
are to be distributed to the members
of the association in proportion to
the gross amount purchased and will
be credited to their accounts at the
beginning of the autumn quarter.
Until the association becomes es
tablished, no perishable goods such!
as meats and vegetables can be pur
chased under this plan. Orders are 1
to be received by the manager on the J
fourth and eighteenth of each month, i
and goods will be delivered by the
association on or before the tenth or
twenty-fifth of each month. Monthly'
statements will be sent to each house
manager with a penalty of five per j
cent if payment of the bill is delin-1
quent.
Plans for co-operative marketing
among the various living groups were
completed last night in the Kappa
Sigma house at a committee meeting
of the Students Co-operative Purchas
ing Association.
The meeting was attended by El
liott H. Ayres, manager of the asso
ciation, and representatives of the
different organizations, which at the
present time include all the sororities,
twenty-two fraternities, and the El
Campo Club. Bi-weekly orders for pro
visions were placed with Chairman
David S. Adams, and problems of buy
ing, storing, and distributing the prod
ucts were discussed.
Quantity buying resulting in dis
count of bills for food and general
provisions is the aim of the associa
tion. Several attempts for the inaugu
ration of such an arrangement have
been made at times during the past
fifteen years, but all have failed, due
to lack of continued co-operation be
tween its members. The present plan
was first organized during the autumn
quarter by Comptroller A. E. Roth
and different groups that favored such
a plan.
