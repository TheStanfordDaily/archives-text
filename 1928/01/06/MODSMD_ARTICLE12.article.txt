# GIBBY WELCH SAYS CARDS COULD BEAT YALEELEVEN
## Pitt Captain Tells How Much Impressed He Was With Football Varsity PRAISES "BIFF" HOFFMAN Likes Stanford Men Because They Aren't High-Hat; Admires Pop Warner 
### Milton Silverman 
He wears dark clothes, subdued
scarf, and a tie that insistently slips
way over on his collar. He is built,
they say, from the ground up. He is
small, quiet, and polite. He gets the
front seat in the bus. He plays foot
ball. They call him "Gibby" Welch.
"And Stanford," says the famous
Pittsburgh leader, "could play Yale
three days in a row and beat 'em
every time. They're the fastest team

we've met this
year; they could
play every team in
the East — Army,
Dartmouth, and
W. & J., included
—and give 'em a
considerable run
for their money."
Likes Stanford
Ask him what
he thinks of the
campus. "It's even
as good as we've

all heard." Stanford is a marvelous
place, he proclaims, and Donchess,
Kern, and Booth, fellow stars, nod
their heads in distinct approval.
"What I like about your campus is
its beautiful background, and all that,
of course; but what I like best are
your Stanford men—not a single one
of them high-hat. And that's some
thing!"
The team? Welch says that at


G. Welch
Pasadena, the Panthers were out
played man for man. Every minute
of the game, the Redshirts were put
ling up the old Warner courage and
light that has become traditional at
Pitt.
"I don't know what the other fel
lows think," continues the All-Ameri
can, "but the Stanford bunch certain
ly treated me fine. You know, Los
Angeles gave us a very cordial re
ception, but there are an awful lot
of bow-wows down there that are try
ing to sell southern California at the
price of the game. At that, they have
quite a bit to sell!
"We're leaving San Francisco for
Pittsburgh tonight—have to get back
to the books—and we'll tell the folks
back there—oh, plenty of things. The
first thing will be that Stanford has
one of the fastest, cleanest, hard
fighting teams in America."
Pays Hoffman Tribute
Then he starts on Hoffman. "You're
certainly going to have a great cap
tain next year. Without a doubt, he'll
go along with the United States team
to the Olpmpics at Amsterdam. As to
next season's All-American, there's
only one fullback, Howell of Nebras
ka, who has any chance at all to beat
him out."
But he's just as enthusiastic about
Hal McCreery, "He's a great leader,
and a great fighter. It was a real
pleasure to be able to meet and play
against him and Hoffman."
"Pop" Dean of Coaches
"You've got some mighty nice
coaches. I knew 'Chuck' Winterburn
back home; he's a fraternity brother
of mine. Warner, though, is the grand
old dean of them all. He's a character

at Pittsburgh. Every one who ever
knew him loves Pop—all the fellows
at Carlisle and at Pitt. I don't know
him very well, but I can see why the
fellows like him as they do.
"Leaving us? Well, I hope I'll see
you here again sometime. I might
have a chance to play with the Olym
pic Club later on. So good luck to
you till then!"
