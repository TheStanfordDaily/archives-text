# ANNUAL CONFERENCE AT ASILOMAR MOST SUCCESSFUL â€“ DRAKE
## 
### 
"One of the most successful student
conferences ever held," was the
opinion of Thomas Drake, president
of the Stanford Y.M.C.A., when dis
cussing the recent Asilomar Inter
collegiate Conference. "Stanford was
especially well represented with a
group of twenty-two men and played
a dominating role in the affairs of the
convention.
"Such outstanding men as Dr.
Kirby Page, author and lecturer, J.
Stitt Wilson, former Socialist mayor
of Berkeley, and Dr. C. H. Robertson,
scientist and educator from China,
held forth daily in the assembly hall
with general discussion of student
problems. Later such leaders as Dr.
C. E. Rugh of the University of Cali
fornia, and Dr. William Kirk of
Pomona College, stimulated further
research in small group forums.
