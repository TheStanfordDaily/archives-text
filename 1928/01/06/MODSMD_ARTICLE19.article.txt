# WOMEN'S PLAN FOR MURAL BASKETBALL IS ABANDONED
## 
### 
Decision to abandon the plan of in-1
tramural basketball for women has
been made by the W.A.A. board, it
was announced yesterday. The board
based its decision on the fact that (he
woman student body is too small to
make such a plan feasible, that the
women entered in interclass competi- i
lion would be the same ones to par
ticipate in intramural games, and that ;
there was little genuine interest at !
the bottom of the plan.
"The board was at first greatly en
thused over the question of intra- j

| mural sports for women," said Ches
terlyn Thomas, W.A.A. president,
"but when we had considered the dif
ficulties involved in having regular
games at night we felt that it would
be wisest and best to drop the ques
tion. If every bouse were obliged to
i enter a team, some members might
be forced to play against their will,
thus defeating the entire purpose of
t lie plan. I feel confident that when
I (he women stop to consider the prob
lem they will agree with our deci*
i sion."
