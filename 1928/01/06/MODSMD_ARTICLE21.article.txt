# LATE ARRIVALS SEND REGISTRATION FIGURE SOARING FOR RECORD
## 
### 
Enrollment figures for this quarter
had last night exceeded all previous
records for a winter quarter. At the
I end of the third day of registration,
3191 had completed enrollment, as
! compared with 3122 at the same time
last winter quarter. Approximately
fifty more are expected to register
; within the week.
Registration for the first two days
of the quarter lagged behind former
' figures somewhat, on account of the
I considerable number who returned to
! the campus late after the Pittsburgh
| Stanford game at Pasadena. It is esti-
I mated that about 335 are registering
! late this year.
The registration of this quarter has
taken the usual winter quarter slump
and is about 150 less than the fall
; quarter registration of 3358.
