Student-body cards will be
valid for the basketball games
against College of Pacific tonight
and Fresno State Teachers -to
morrow night. Both varsity
games are scheduled for 8 o'clock.
Faculty Athletic tickets can be
renewed at the new business of
fice of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
Victory hopes of the Cardinals
took a decided drop yesterday when
it was announced that John McCand
less, first-string center, is temporar
ily disqualified from play tonight
when Stanford meets College of Pa
cific in the opening game of the sea
son. McCandless will he ineligible to
play until he gets his scholastic
standing straightened out.
Followed by the College of Pacific
contest, Stanford will take on the
Fresno State Teachers tomorrow
night. A strenuous week-end for any
basketball team, and more so when
it is rated as under-dog in both
games.
Cards Won Last Year
Last year the College of Pacific men
lost to the Cardinals by a 23 to 15
score. This season Swede Rigliter's
players have been given the decided
edge, mainly because they put up a
hard fight against the Trojans in pre
season games, losing to the South
erners by close scores, 25 to 17 and
29 to 25.
Hunt's guards will have their hands
full in trying to stop the long passes
and fast rushes of Heath and Mc-
Arthur, Pacific forwards. In addition,
the opponents of the Cardinals have
been trained to work against the five
man defense and as a result are ex
perts in court maneuvers. As was the
case last year they are deadly on the
long distance shots.
C. of P. Men Small
The one advantage that the Cardi
nals will have lies in the smallness
of the Pacific players. Hunt's men
will be on a par with them in speed
and size. If the Stanford men play the
game they have been taught the odds
should be even. If they show the
same snap and accuracy in shooting
they showed yesterday afternoon, the
odds should be more than even. But
as yet the Cardinals have not re
moved the doubt of being even flighty,
at least by the showing made in the
practice scrimmages and pre-season
games.
Tomorrow night's contest has been
rated by the coaches and managers
as the harder of the two. The Fresno
men come from an area where bas
ketball is the real thing and they are
out to win.
I hree men have been lost from the
team that beat Stanford 23 to 21 last
year. There are still three reliable
veterans on the squad, men that have
received the All-Far-Western Confer

ence rating. They are Ginsburg,
guard; Wilhelmsen, forward; and
Telonicker, forward. With this outlay
of stars the Teachers almost won
from the highly touted TT.S.O. quintet,
early this season, losing to the Tro
jans in a 33 to 30 game.
Facing these facts, Coach Husky
Hunt has picked out his most reliable
men to Btart in the game tonight.
They are Richards and Bowers, for
wards; Clark, center; Dobson and
Thompson, guards. If this combina
tion proves unequal to the task he
will send in Bryant and Berg, for
wards; Elliot, center; and Rothert
and Biaggini, guards.
