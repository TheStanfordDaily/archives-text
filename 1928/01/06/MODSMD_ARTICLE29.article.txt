"It's in the hands of the students whether or not they want to get a
clean diploma," said Dr. Wilbur yesterday in speaking of the recent
violations of the Honor System. "There were more violations both of
the Honor System and of the regulations concerning drinking during the
past quarter than during any other quarter in recent times," he added.
Student government, then, as the Daily pointed out Wednesday, has
reached a crisis and it is necessary for the attitude of the students to be
brought into line once more before the Honor System and student
government can continue along the even tenor of college respect which
is their due.
During the Fall Quarter, 1927. the following number of cases were
handled in the way indicated: 2 student bootleggers were expelled; 9
men in a fraternity whose lease was cancelled were denied the right to
register; of 2 violations of the Honor System, one student was denied
the right to re-register, and the other was eliminated for two quarters.
Eight other students received severe disciplinary measures for various
violations of "conduct unbecoming Stanford students." Total number of
cases, 21. A comparison of these figures with the following ones (which
are given by years) will serve to show the gravity of the situation as it
exists today:
Liquor Violations Honor System Violations
Expelled Susp ruled No. Cases Expelled Suspended No. Cases
To Aug. 1927 0 1 6 0 4 16
To Aug. 1926 0 3 4 0 0 14
To Aug. 1925 0' 2 10 0 3 15
To Aug. 1924 0 1 2 2 2 10
(Note —The majority of the cases in each of the two classes of violations
received some diacipinary action either in the form of hours added to gradua
tion or work at the Convalescent Home.)
It will be seen that the number of cases in which severe action was
taken last quarter IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF CASES
FOR ANY YEAR IN RECENT TIMES. This cannot be said to be
due to a mere tightening of University discipline as some cynics hold.
\\ e believe that it is due more to a gradual let-down in the morale of the
student body as a whole. In too many cases have breaches of the regu
lations slipped by without action. Like the proverbial snowball more
violations have come. It's in the cards that much has happened and
that more may happen unless student opinion is brought into line.

violations of "conduct unbecoming Stanford students." Total number of
cases, 21. A comparison of these figures with the following ones (which
are given by years) will serve to show the gravity of the situation as it
exists today:
Liquor Violations Honor System Violations
Expelled Susp ruled No. Cases Expelled Suspended No. Cases
To Aug. 1927 0 1 6 0 4 16
To Aug. 1926 0 3 4 0 0 14
To Aug. 1925 0' 2 10 0 3 15
To Aug. 1924 0 1 2 2 2 10
(Note —The majority of the cases in each of the two classes of violations
received some diacipinary action either in the form of hours added to gradua
tion or work at the Convalescent Home.)
It will be seen that the number of cases in which severe action was
taken last quarter IS GREATER THAN THE NUMBER OF CASES
FOR ANY YEAR IN RECENT TIMES. This cannot be said to be
due to a mere tightening of University discipline as some cynics hold.
\\ e believe that it is due more to a gradual let-down in the morale of the
student body as a whole. In too many cases have breaches of the regu
lations slipped by without action. Like the proverbial snowball more
violations have come. It's in the cards that much has happened and
that more may happen unless student opinion is brought into line.
"It's in the hands of the students whether or not they want to get a
clean diploma," said Dr. Wilbur yesterday in speaking of the recent
violations of the Honor System. "There were more violations both of
the Honor System and of the regulations concerning drinking during the
past quarter than during any other quarter in recent times," he added.
Student government, then, as the Daily pointed out Wednesday, has
reached a crisis and it is necessary for the attitude of the students to be
brought into line once more before the Honor System and student
government can continue along the even tenor of college respect which
is their due.
During the Fall Quarter, 1927. the following number of cases were
handled in the way indicated: 2 student bootleggers were expelled; 9
men in a fraternity whose lease was cancelled were denied the right to
register; of 2 violations of the Honor System, one student was denied
the right to re-register, and the other was eliminated for two quarters.
Eight other students received severe disciplinary measures for various
violations of "conduct unbecoming Stanford students." Total number of
cases, 21. A comparison of these figures with the following ones (which
are given by years) will serve to show the gravity of the situation as it
exists today:
