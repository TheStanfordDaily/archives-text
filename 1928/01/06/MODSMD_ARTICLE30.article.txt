Imperturbable Lindbergh continues to soar over the heads of the
troubled lands south of the Rio Grande. - Mien!
Meanwhile plans go ahead for the Sixth International Conference of
American States, to be held January 26 in balmy Havana, Paris of the
Caribbean and sometime depot of the rum fleet. This meeting is regarded
by Washington as highly important, and several important diplomatic
figures, including Dr. Wilbur, chosen Uv President Coolidge, will attend.
Between Lindbergh's "good-will flight" and the great stir being made
in the capital, it would seem as if the government was packing the grand
stand in an effort to enter the conference on the good side of the Latin
and South American countries. There is no denying that the international
relations involved are not all they might be. For instance, the alarm of
the South American republics over our imperialistic ways will have to
be allayed. Pillions of dollars of American money invested in these
countries make these fears rather hard to laugh off.
Cuban nationalists will be heard, too, with plans for a more complete
independence. The Dominican Republic and Haiti are in financial and
more or less political receivership of this country. Protecting the Panama
Canal has rubbed the fur of Panama the wrong way, and, egged on by
its neighbors, Panama has balked at some of the suggestions made by the
State Department. ()ur policy in Nicaragua has been in a great mess, and
no less than five different pronouncements on the situation have appeared
at the same time. And always there have'been the American Marines.
Our neighbors accuse us of using the Monroe Doctrine as a cover for
ulterior acts and motives. At the best, it tends to carry the United States
further and further into the determination of the internal policies of other
countries which are supposed to be independent and self-governing.
Apparently we have no "Latin-American Policy" or "South American
Policy," but have been playing a game of opportunism and regional
determination which, while often made with good intent, has just as
often run counter to the patriotism and national aspirations of the people
involved.
Perhaps all the cheers Lindbergh has raised in southern throats may
be badly needed iti 1 lavana during the week of January 26.
