BASKETBALL
Cardinal basketball squad f;ices a
black week-end. Both the College of
the Pacific and Fresno Slate are
doped to trounce the red five by em
phatic scores. The reason for this,
observers who have watched the team
all season say, is that the squad is
still in a fog. The men lose their
heads and forget the fundamentals
of play whenever they engage in a 1
game. For example, in the contest
during the holidays with the Holly
wood Athletic Club, the varsity used
only one of the brace of plays Coach
Husky Hunt had drilled it in, pre
sumably forgetting the rest.
Again, Bill Clark, who played
four years of basketball in high
school and has been a member
of the Stanford team for two
years, had the hard luck on the
southern journey to fall into a
shooting slump during the length
of which he shot only one bas
ket.
Wednesday the varsity tangled
with the 1931 team and was left far
behind. The big team's zone defense
work was feeble, and the babes, who
it must be admitted are superior as a
team to any basketball varsity seen
here in recent years, glided in and
around the guards at will.
HUNT NOT TO BLAME
That the team's low state is
not Coach Hunt's fault is seen
from the fact that the freshman
team, which beat the varsity,
also is coached by him. Prac
tice has been going on for the
red-jerseyed men since October
1, and as Hunt expressed it after
the freshman holocaust, it is
about time the squad was coming
to.
Fact that the team is having diffi
culty affords, an opportunity to urge
that Stanford men and women sup
port the team all the more vigorous
ly. That the squad potentially is good,
no one will deny; that hearty support
' will bring it out of the present dol
' drums is a reasonable hope.
AS FOR CALIFORNIA
California again looms as the chief
j obstacle any coast team with a yearn
ing for the coast basketball cham
pionship will have to bowl over. Nibs
Price's teams have reigned on this
[ seaboard for five years and apparent
ly will agaii).
Nibs' secret of success, it is
said, is to drill the Berkeley men
in fundamentals throughout an
arduous season of practice, to
keep them on the go every min
ute they are in their suits, to
j build lip their wind and muscle
at home, rather than on barn
storming tours, and to give then
a few simple plnys to uss the
whole season long. It's not a
"Warner system" by far, but it
brings in the results each year.

Nibs' secret of success, it is
said, is to drill the Berkeley men
in fundamentals throughout an
arduous season of practice, to
keep them on the go every min
ute they are in their suits, to
j build lip their wind and muscle
at home, rather than on barn
storming tours, and to give then
a few simple plnys to uss the
whole season long. It's not a
"Warner system" by far, but it
brings in the results each year.

BASKETBALL
Cardinal basketball squad f;ices a
black week-end. Both the College of
the Pacific and Fresno Slate are
doped to trounce the red five by em
phatic scores. The reason for this,
observers who have watched the team
all season say, is that the squad is
still in a fog. The men lose their
heads and forget the fundamentals
of play whenever they engage in a 1
game. For example, in the contest
during the holidays with the Holly
wood Athletic Club, the varsity used
only one of the brace of plays Coach
Husky Hunt had drilled it in, pre
sumably forgetting the rest.
Again, Bill Clark, who played
four years of basketball in high
school and has been a member
of the Stanford team for two
years, had the hard luck on the
southern journey to fall into a
shooting slump during the length
of which he shot only one bas
ket.
Wednesday the varsity tangled
with the 1931 team and was left far
behind. The big team's zone defense
work was feeble, and the babes, who
it must be admitted are superior as a
team to any basketball varsity seen
here in recent years, glided in and
around the guards at will.
HUNT NOT TO BLAME
That the team's low state is
not Coach Hunt's fault is seen
from the fact that the freshman
team, which beat the varsity,
also is coached by him. Prac
tice has been going on for the
red-jerseyed men since October
1, and as Hunt expressed it after
the freshman holocaust, it is
about time the squad was coming
to.
Fact that the team is having diffi
culty affords, an opportunity to urge
that Stanford men and women sup
port the team all the more vigorous
ly. That the squad potentially is good,
no one will deny; that hearty support
' will bring it out of the present dol
' drums is a reasonable hope.
AS FOR CALIFORNIA
California again looms as the chief
j obstacle any coast team with a yearn
ing for the coast basketball cham
pionship will have to bowl over. Nibs
Price's teams have reigned on this
[ seaboard for five years and apparent
