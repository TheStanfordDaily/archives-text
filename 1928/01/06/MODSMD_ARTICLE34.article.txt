THE WOMEN RUSH
Women's rushing, with its prob-;
lems of what should be worn by the ,
; sisters to impress the sophisticated !
nuggets ot' the present crop, and vice j
' versa, has been occupying the best [
! minds on the campus for the past ;
| few days to the exclusion of all other
j mental effort.
To an onlooker, the spectacle of!
] rushing and its attendant phenomena
I are highly entertaining. The partici
| pants on both sides, however, find it
| difficult to see the humor in the situ
| ation until some time after it is all
over, as everyone actively concerned (
takes the sport too seriously.
Since very little can be said pro i
! or con at this time about acquiring j
| sorority pledges without some group !
1 feeling tHat it is being discriminated j
against, we will not touch upon con- >
j troversial matters, but just tell of an j
j occurrence which enlivened a former j
! and otherwise dull rushing season,
j Here is the story of the Freshman i
[Woman that Dropped Into the House i
j for the Wrong Meal. The dear sisters,
|it seems, were beginning to break
j under the strain of being refined
I throughout rush week, and had de
cided to relieve the tension by dining
on corned beef and cabbage. When
the nugget appeared just before meal
time the diplomatic experts of the
house, demoralized by the repeated
demands for quick thinking that had
,been overwhelming them during the
| past few days, could ihink of no tact-

! ful method of sending her on her j
| way. With matters in such a state, !
, there was nothing to do but invite j
i the rushee to dine under a pledge of
j silence concerning the menu. The
' news leaked out, however, and was j
I made the most of by interested
j parties.
It is on just such small details that
I the fate of houses depends. A low-1
1 J
heeled shoe, a poorly concealed pack- j
j age of gum, or an unguarded remark.
—and the knockout has fled to sane-!
tuary in a group where more genteel '
; manners are apparent—at least dur-j
ing rushing. —F.M. j
