# "DINK" TEMPLETON IS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER PROSPECTS OF STANFORD VARSITY TRACK SQUAD; OUTLINES PLANS FOR NEXT SEASON
## Only Three Point-Scorers, Shipkey, Meeks, and Hoffman, Are Missing From the Team That Captured Title at Intercollegiates 
### JACK HODGES 
rrRACK prospects look bright for this year with a large number of returning j
lettermen and a number of men from last year's freshman team, says
Dink Templeton, track mentor. The Cards lost only three point-scorers in ,
the 1.C.4-A. last year, Shipkey, Meeks, and Hoffman.
The dash events are stronger than last year but suffered a severe blow i
when Gib Kingsbury, star sprinter of the 1930 freshman team, failed to ,
return to school. This leaves Wes Doe, who is capable of fast times in each j

event, and Johnny Lauritzen, a letter-'
man.
Spencer Getting in Form
In the quarter, Captain Bud Spencer
is the best bet as he already is in
fairly good shape. Morrison, who set
a new record in the California-Stan
ford freshman meet last year, and Bob
Syer and Jack Dales, returning letter
men, and Tom McGuire are all strong
possibilities. The SSO is the weakest
race and probably will be a big worry
to Templeton. It is possible that a
couple of the 440 men will be shifted
to the longer race as Morrison has
been working on the half-mile all
year. Gooden. miler, may also be
changed to the shorter race.
McKinnon is the strongest man in
the mile, as he took fourth in the
1.C.4-A. last year and won in every
other meet. Gooden has a strong
chance to break in this year as he
turned in a fast race in the fall intra
mural meet if he does not run the
half.
Four Two-Milers
Swain and Ranney, two lettermen,
with Coe and Loofbourow are the
possibilities in the two-mile. Loof
bourow won the two-mile in the fall
intramural with the time of 10.21.
West and Nichols, both of whom
placed in the 1.C.4-A. last year, are
the fastest men in the hurdle races.
Don Nelson, Helmke, Gilbert, and
Maddison are working out in these
events and may be varsity material.
As was the case last year. Stan
ford's real strength lies in the field
events. The loss of Hoffman will not
be a very great handicap because
Eric Krenz, who broke the shot and
discus records in the freshman meet
witli California last year and also won
the shot in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet, has been a consistent per
former in each event. Way and Fors
ter are also strong in each event.
Herb Fleislihacker can be counted on
in the shot, and Ray Tandy will be a
possibility in the discus, as he broke
