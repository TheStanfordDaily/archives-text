# HOWARD SIMON GIVES EXHIBITION IN GALLERY
## 
### 
Block prints and drawings by How- j
ard Simon are on exhibition now at
the Stanford Art Gallery. Scenes of :
San Francisco, of the East-side of
New York, and of Paris are repre
sented in the prints, which show
strongly the atmosphere of the dif- [
ferent cities. Simon's versatility is ;
evidenced by his portrayal of charac
ters and scenes with an extremely ;
delicate finish.
Charcoal portraits of many well-1
known men and women in California
by Peter Valkenburgh will go on ex
hibition next Sunday. This artist is
interested particularly in portraying ;
character in his studies, and lie will
sacrifice technique and artistic deco
rativeness for the sake of a true per
sonal characterization. The intellec
tual type of man or woman is Val
kenburgh's special interest.

King High Jump Star
Bob King is the star in the high
jump event. Wes Bryant and French,
a sophomore, are other contestants.
There is a possibility that Clarence
West will compete in this event.
Zombro and Dyer, both lettermen,
should take care of things in the
broad jump as both gave good ac
counts of themselves last year, j
Dowell, one of last year's babes, is j
another man who looks like varsity j
material. This event will also suffer '
the loss of Kingsbury.
Edmonds, Hulsman, and Mainwaf- |
ing are the Card possibilities in the
pole vault. Edmonds is the superior j
of the three having reached thirteen j
feet six inches last year.
The javelin also will be a particu
larly strong event despite the loss of i
Ted Shipkey. Tom Joaquin and Bill
Sparling have both thrown over 190
feet.
