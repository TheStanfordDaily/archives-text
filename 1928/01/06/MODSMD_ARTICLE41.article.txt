### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Today the third annual Los Angeles
open golf tournament starts, with
Tommy Armour, one of America's
"Big Three," as the center of attrac
tion. It takes a Jones, a Hagen, or an
Armour to get ttie natives really ex
cited out there, for they have such
an abundance of "home brew" that
real golf is nothing unusual. There
are Harry Cooper, winner of the first
Los Angeles open, and Willie Hunter,
the present state open champion, to
mention only two of the local celebri
ties.
But to get back to Tommy Armour,
who is really a Scotchman and tlis
present open champion of these Uni
ted States and also of those Canada.
It will be remembered that Tommy
won the U.S. title last June because
he could come from behind, because
he could play Oakmont's short holes,
and because lie is the finest iron-play
er in the game today. Folks still talk
about Tommy's final birdie 3 that tied

i Cooper in a dramatic finish (each
: golfer getting a 301 and then of how
j he went on to win the play-off, 76-79,
i after tying the score with a fifty-foot
putt-
Then, less than two months later,
' Armour went 011 to win the Canadian
! open crown, beating Mac Smith by
I one stroke with a fine score of 288.
j Again Tommy thrilled the gallery by
j his courage and his shot-making abil
ity in the face of adversity, just as,
j in spite of the loss of an eye in the
! world war, he rose from the ranks to
I a major's commission. After four
years of war, what's a little thing like
| an open golf tournament?
