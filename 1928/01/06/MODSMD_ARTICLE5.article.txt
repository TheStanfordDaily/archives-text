# Deadline For Junior Opera Plot Summaries Changed to January 13
## 
### HALLIE KEATING 
ry.HE deadline for plot summaries for the Junior Opera has been changed to
* Friday, January 13, it was announced yesterday. Manuscripts must be
in the hands of the committee by this time. They should be mailed to Hal
Boomer, Alpha Tau Omega, typewritten if possible, with the name of the
author on the sheet.
No dialogue is required at this time, and the summaries need not be long.
A brief idea of the plot is what is wanted primarily, and the manuscripts

1 should not contain unnecessary and<s
non-dramatic details. The approxi-1
mate number of the cast should be :
included, and some idea of the period |
or setting indicated.
The authors of the summaries ac- !
cepted by the committee will be
asked to submit complete first acts
by January 30. The Junior Opera !
Committee will meet within the next j
week to make plans for considering |
the plots as quickly as possible, in I
order that authors may have more j
time to work on first acts.
Music Acceptable
Music may be submitted at any I
time, but until announcement is made
of the musical director of the show. !
such contributions should be mailed j
to the office of the Dramatic Council.
The customary type of music is de
sired, varying as in past years from
waltz numbers to fox-trots. Lyric
writers are urged to begin thinking
about catch-words and song ideas, ac- j
cording to Norman Larson, dramatic j
manager. Deadline for songs and I
music will be announced at a future j
time.
As usual, a prize will be given for |
the winning opera book, although the I
amount of remuneration has not yet |
been decided definitely. Arrange-!
ments will be made for rewards for i
collaborations.
Continuity Essential
"The chief essential for these plot >
summaries," Hal Boomer, chairman of j
the Junior Opera committee, says, "is I
(hat they give a clear continuity of j
the plot. Any kind of story of any j
description, color, or servitude is ac-1
ceptable. Modern ones are particular j
ly desired, but costume plays—if they j
are good—will not be considered at !
a disadvantage. Brief summaries with
a minimum of extraneous material
are what we want."
The Junior Opera is the only op
portunity for students interested in
playwriting to demonstrate their abil
ity. It is the only completely student
produced play given on the campus,
and is one of the oldest traditions.
Last year's Junior Opera, "Wicked
William," was written by Frank !
Baker and Winston Norman, and was '
a sophisticated comedy, laid on the j
Atlantic Coast.
