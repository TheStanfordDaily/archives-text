# MACHINE GUN COMPANY ON WAY TO HELP U.S. MARINES IN NICARAGUA
## 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragaua, Jan. 5. —
(U.P.) —A machine gun company of
120 marines is en route from Mana
gua to reinforce the United States
marines concentrated at Quilali for a
smashing attack upon the Nicaraguan
revolutionists.
The advance was delayed today
pending arrival of the company,
which is proceeding cautiously
through the rebel country.
Planes Comb Mountains
Meanwhile, planes and scout pa
trols have combed the mountain area.
No large body of revolutionists, who
are commanded by General Augus
tino Sandino, has been seen.
There have been no encounters
with rebels since Sunday, Colonel
Mason Gulick, marine commander,
said today.
Revolutionists Believed at Chipote
It is believed that the entire revo
lutionist force of 1000 has been con
centrated at El Chipote, Sandino's
last stronghold, which is 18 miles
from Quilali, for a final defense.
If the marines succeed in capturing
El Chipote, which has been elabor
ately protected against attack from
infantry and the air, the rebel cause
will receive its most damaging blow
since the arrival of American troops
in March 1027.
