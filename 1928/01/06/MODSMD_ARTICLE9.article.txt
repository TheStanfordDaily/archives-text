# YEARLING CAGE SQUAD CONCLUDES WORKOUTS FOR PACIFIC CONTEST
## 
### 
Members of the freshman basket
ball squad went through a final prac
tice yesterday afternoon in prepara
tion for their debut tonight when they
clash with the College of Pacific
freshmen in the Pavilion at 7 o'clock
as a preliminary to the varsity-Tiger
game.
After a fast workout Assistant
Coach Mitchell put the babes through
a lengthy scrimmage, specializing in
defensive play and pitting the first
string regulars against a team made
up almost entirely of recently en
rolled cage aspirants.
Vance Fawcett, regular forward,
received an injury to his back during
the practice which probably will
keep him out of the game tonight. As
a result of this, Mitchell has made
a change in the starting line-up, plac
ing Freeman and Jojon-Roclie in the
forward berths instead of Fawcett
and Snyder, as previously announced,
The latter is a new man and not. yet
well acquainted with the team's style
of play.
A meeting of the squad will be held
at 4 o'clock this afternoon for the
issuing of suits. This year is the first
that the freshman players have had
suits similar to those of the varsity.
The jerseys are red with the letters
31 under a block "S."
Saturday night the team will meet
the Oakland Company, California
Grays in a second game. Little is
known of the ability of either of the
babes' first two opponents, this being
the first season that the College of
Pacific has had a freshman team.
