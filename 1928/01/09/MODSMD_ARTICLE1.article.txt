# STANFORD FIVE BREAKS EVEN IN WEEK'S GAMES
## Cards Defeat Fresno State Teachers College in Extra Period HUNT'S MEN FIGHT ODDS Pacific College Worst Tilt Observed at Pavilion In Recent Years 
### Merle Emry 
It wasn't the excellence of their
playing, but it was that brand of
tight for which Stanford teams are
famous that enabled the varsity bas
ketball players to redeem themselves
Saturday night when they downed the
Fresno State Teachers 25 to 20.
Coach Hunt's men had been bat
tling against heavy odds all evening.
Their opponents kept in the lead, they
were rated as superior, and the Cardi
nals had not recovered from the in
teriority complex of Friday night's
contest when the College of the
Pacific beat them 29 to 18. Still they
fought, and fought hard enough to tie
the game 19 to 19 at the end of the
second half.
Three Star
Vincenti, Smalling, and Berg were
the most responsible parties in win
ning the game. When Vincenti and
Smalling were sent in at the last five
minutes of play, things began to
move and they kept moving until the
Â«nd of the extra period. These men
provided the fight but it was up to
red-headed Harry Berg to furnish the
scores in that extra period.
Last year Berg was captain and
high-point man on the freshman team;
he was a sure shot. This year he lias
been off-form, at least until Saturday
night. The coaches were worried. But
when he came through with two
beautifully executed shots from diffi
cult positions, they know that he is
still reliable under fire.
Smalling made a goal which gave
the Cardinals a two-point lead, 21 to
19, and Berg made his two baskets
.shortly before the game ended.
Redshirts Score
Stanford started scoring after the
tirst few minutes of the opening of
the game by making three points.
,Fresno tied that number and Stanford
sot another basket and free throw to
make six. That was the second and
last time the Cards were ahead in
the first half, for soon after that
Telonicher and Wilhelmson, Teacher
forwards, started functioning and the
half ended 12 to 7 in Fresno's favor.
The game slowed down at the open-
ing of the second half. The Redshirts
were inaccurate in their passes and
they failed to take the opportunities
for shooting. When they did shoot
they failed to sink the ball in the
basket. This was the only time they
reached the low level of playing that
they showed the night before against
the College of Pacific team.
Teachers Play Well
The Teachers exhibited skill and
smooth playing. Their plays func
tioned without miss the majority of
times. Stanford's fight was all that
beat them.
As for the College of Pacific game
which Stanford lost 29 to 18, it was
the worst seen in the Pavilion in
many years. Hunt's men forgot every
thing. They looked like an inexperi
enced and green team, although they
have been going since October 1. This
was especially true in the second
half. The first half ended 15 to 13
in favcr of the Pacific players. In the
second period the College of Pacific
men four times used the old trick of
sucking the Cardinals out and shoot
ing from the corners, a play that is
as old to basketball as the Statue of
Liberty is to football.
