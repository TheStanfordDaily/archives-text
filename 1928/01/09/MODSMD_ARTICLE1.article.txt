# STANFORD FIVE BREAKS EVEN IN WEEK'S GAMES
## Cards Defeat Fresno State Teachers College in Extra Period HUNT'S MEN FIGHT ODDS Pacific College Worst Tilt Observed at Pavilion In Recent Years 
### Merle Emry 
It wasn't the excellence of their
playing, but it was that brand of
tight for which Stanford teams are
famous that enabled the varsity bas
ketball players to redeem themselves
Saturday night when they downed the
Fresno State Teachers 25 to 20.
Coach Hunt's men had been bat
tling against heavy odds all evening.
Their opponents kept in the lead, they
were rated as superior, and the Cardi
nals had not recovered from the in
teriority complex of Friday night's
contest when the College of the
Pacific beat them 29 to 18. Still they
fought, and fought hard enough to tie
the game 19 to 19 at the end of the
second half.
Three Star
Vincenti, Smalling, and Berg were
the most responsible parties in win
ning the game. When Vincenti and
Smalling were sent in at the last five
minutes of play, things began to
move and they kept moving until the
«nd of the extra period. These men
provided the fight but it was up to
red-headed Harry Berg to furnish the
scores in that extra period.
Last year Berg was captain and
high-point man on the freshman team;
he was a sure shot. This year he lias
been off-form, at least until Saturday
night. The coaches were worried. But
when he came through with two
beautifully executed shots from diffi
cult positions, they know that he is
still reliable under fire.
Smalling made a goal which gave
the Cardinals a two-point lead, 21 to
19, and Berg made his two baskets
.shortly before the game ended.
Redshirts Score
Stanford started scoring after the
tirst few minutes of the opening of
the game by making three points.
,Fresno tied that number and Stanford
sot another basket and free throw to
make six. That was the second and
last time the Cards were ahead in
the first half, for soon after that
Telonicher and Wilhelmson, Teacher
forwards, started functioning and the
half ended 12 to 7 in Fresno's favor.
The game slowed down at the open-
