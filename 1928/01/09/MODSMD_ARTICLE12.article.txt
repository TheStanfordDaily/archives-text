# FOURTEEN TEAMS START MURAL CAGE PLAY
## 
### Stan Mullin 
Complete schedule of this week's
games appears on page three.
First-round matches of the intra
mural basketball competition will get
under way today with seven games
on schedule.
Four of the matches will be played
in Encina Gym and only three in the
Basketball Pavilion due to varsity
cage practice. As yet the result of
any games can not be accurately fore
told, but as soon as the teams go into
action a definite idea of the relative
strength of the fives can be gained.
Last season's successful teams,
may, however, upset the dope by de
feating the living groups. Sigma Chi,
which won the championship last
year, has a good chance to come out
in the lead again. Breakers will enter
a strong team which will go against
Encina 3E today while Sigma Chi
takes on Encina lE. El Cuadro, Kappa
Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, and Chi Psi
are also favorites to cop their first
round matches.
