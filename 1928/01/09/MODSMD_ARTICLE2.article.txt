# PORTRAIT EXHIBITION OPENED AT STANFORD BY VAN VALKENBURGH
## 
### 
Peter Van Valkenburgh, whose por
trait drawings have been attracting
attention over the Bay region for the
past year, opened an exhibition in the
Stanford Art Gallery yesterday. This
Dutch artist has recently made a
series of portraits of the prominent
educators at (lie University of Cali
fornia, and he already has several
commissions to draw members of the
Stanford faculty.
Van Valkenburgh is an Oakland art
ist of Dutch ancestry. He studied with
a group of artists now famous. Van
derpool, at the Art Institute of Chi
cago, interested him in draughtsman
ship, and Chase in portraiture. For a
long time Rembrandt was his idol,
but he became interested in Holbein's
work, and has studied his methods
for years, with the result that he
takes little interest in the color prob
lem of portraiture, holding that it
would not portray any more strongly
(be authentic human being. He hopes
(o make an historic collection of por
trait heads of our most worth-while
intellectuals.
Among (hose whose portraits are
being shown from January 9 to 17
are: David P. Barrows, Benjamin I.
Wheeler, Henry Jamison, Cornelius
Bradley, Charles A. Lipman, and Gil
bert N. Lewis.
