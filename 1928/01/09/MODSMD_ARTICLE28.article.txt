Apparently it does no good for the women of the University to ex
press themselves by vote as to whether or not they desire to play inter
living group basketball. The announcement of the W.A.A. board is that
the plan, voted upon favorably by the women, is not deemed feasible
and therefore Stanford women will not have intramural basketball. When
the question was being voted upon, we were of the opinion that the women
had the utmost confidence in their board to put their expressed wish into
operation. If such was the case, that confidence was certainly misplaced
—unless there have been other factors at work to keep the board from
carrying out the wishes of the women. THE WOMEN WHO VOTED
FOR INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL HAVE SOMETHING TO
REMEMBER.
Now, here's another thing". From 1910 to 1919 fencing was a regular
part of the women's physical education schedule. In 1915 this sport
reached its peak with THREE STANFORD WOMEN winning first,
second, and third in the international competition at the Pan-American
Exposition in San Francisco. Since that time only one Stanford woman
has figured in international competition—Clarita Hunsberger, member of
the United States Olympic team in diving.
Fencing might well be taken up again. Harry Maloney -coached the
women until he went abroad with the A.E.F. On his return he found
that fencing had been discontinued. Several efiforts have been made by
interested women to re-instate the sport but they have all failed. The
reason for the failure, we think, is similar to the one which has killed the
intramural basketball program.
