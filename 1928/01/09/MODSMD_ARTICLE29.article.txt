Announcement of the establishment of the Palo Alto School of
Aviation, located on University property, comes as welcome news to
those in the University and this vicinity who may be interested in aviation.
The school will give, after February 1, an opportunity for training which
is not equaled in this locality. It is a possibility in the future that these
aviation courses may be included in the regular curriculum. Even now
the University offers several courses in this field and the addition of such
fundamental and practical training as the Palo Alto School of Aviation
will give would meet all the demands one could make of a university.
In Lieutenant Goddard the new school has a most competent instruc
tor. Possessor of the Military Cross, lie is a graduate of Dartmouth
Naval College, England. Of his fourteen years' experience in aviation
he has spent eight in instruction, four years of which he spent as an
instructor at the U.S. Naval Reserve Unit at San Diego.
Though commercial aviation has not yet been placed on a paying
basis, there is every reason to hope that the time is not far off when there
will be financial soundness in this field. Then, too, there is always the
more vital consideration of aviation in war. Stanford is building for the
future with its interest in this new School of Aviation.
