# The 						Brazen God

### 
High on a throne of tin, and laughing incontinently, sits the new god
of music, Jazz —the patron deity of America. Hymns of praise are rasped
out to him on victrolas, and worshippers throw themselves into wild
frenzies of "hot steppin' " to his honour.
He is a singularly unmysterious and democratic god, because shop
girls and mill-hands are quite as capable of comprehending him as stu
dents and professional men. ]le brings us all to the same level and
bothers our feet instead of our emotions or minds. The lyrics of Jazz,
that is, those lyrics which embody the true spirit, as "Tonight's My Night
with Baby," "Six Feet of Papa," "Shakin' the Blues Away," "Red Lips,
Kiss My Blues Away," can be written by people either slightly above, but
generally below a moron; it no longer requires a Wagner or a Beethoven
to write music. This simplifies things.
Dancing is also simplified. Gone are the days of Viennese waltzes
and French minuettes, and the tango is having a desperate struggle. A
few specimens of it are seen occasionally. All one needs to do now is
relax at the knees and agitate his feet and there you have it. Dancing is
almost a lost art; grace isn't the thing that counts but jiggling and pump
ing, and it's as ridiculous as a cubist painting.
Music has to have words, and Jazz not only has words but it has a
special vocabulary. Men are called "papas" or "Sugar-daddies," and
women are called "babies" or "red-hot mammas"; anything resembling
emotion is called "blues." The rime scheme takes care of itself. Inevitably
"cry" is followed by "sigh" or "die," there is an option here; "eyes" call
up "skies"; "blue" precedes "you," and so on.
And all the time the brazen god Jazz gurgles convulsively on his
saxophone, while his devotees twitch and twist in the dance and screech
out his melodies. The intelligent ones drink their liquor to keep from
being bored, the imbeciles drink because they're not intelligent, and others
just drink, while the band plays things about blues and lips and eyes.
