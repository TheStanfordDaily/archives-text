A SECOND COMING NEEDED
Evil days have fallen on the farm! ;
With roughs' day, sophomore disci- j
pline, the baseball light, and numer
ous other quaint customs of the for
mer age only memories in the minds ;
of aged holdovers and graduates, and ;
with cocky members of the class of
'31 smoking cigarettes in safety and j
comfort on the law steps, the situa- j
tion would be bad enough. What
makes matters worse is that no one j
thinks anything of it any more. The ;
campus seems just as constant as it'
the Union fountain was always tilled i
with recalcitrant freshmen and sopho-j
mores could debate with the inmates
of Encina without the danger of being j
soaked by a water bag.
Only the less spectacular and more !
moral aspects of the old roughs' tra-'
dition survive to make life more in
teresting to the present college gener
ation. Even these seem in a fair way
to be lost soon. The time-honored
rights of leather-jacketed and slightly!
sailed Stanford men to attend dances j
solo, applaud women wearing con- \
spicuous hats, and liven up Dramatic |
Council productions by the judicious j
use of paper aircraft are threatened

by some obscure and ominous power. ]
Not so long ago the roughs were
up in arms over the imminent loss
of their old freedom. A determined I
group of ragged men crashed the gate
of the alumni dance when the ticket
taker suggested that the payment of
twenty-five cents was a prerequisite
for admission. At the sophomore
cotillion the men were crushed and
discouraged when told that they would
have to wait until eleven o'clock bo
fore being admitted, and only staged
a couple of mild demonstrations to
show their displeasure.
It remained for the Glee Club to add '
insult to injury by announcing that !
there would be no roughs admitted to j
its registration dance. Only the de-1
termined editorial campaign of the;
Stanford Daily gained for the poor i
guys grudging permission to climb in |
the windows. Even then the Glee Club i
says that they were going to permit
them to do so anyway.
What Stanford needs, at the present
writing, is a rough messiah to come
from Sequoia, where what is left of
the tradition is carefully guarded, and
lead us out of the wilderness of golf
knockers, cleanliness, and general re
spectability. —P.M.

Not so long ago the roughs were

taker suggested that the payment of
twenty-five cents was a prerequisite
for admission. At the sophomore
cotillion the men were crushed and
discouraged when told that they would
have to wait until eleven o'clock bo
fore being admitted, and only staged
a couple of mild demonstrations to
show their displeasure.
It remained for the Glee Club to add '
insult to injury by announcing that !
there would be no roughs admitted to j

says that they were going to permit
them to do so anyway.
What Stanford needs, at the present

from Sequoia, where what is left of
the tradition is carefully guarded, and
lead us out of the wilderness of golf
knockers, cleanliness, and general re
spectability. —P.M.

of aged holdovers and graduates, and ;
with cocky members of the class of
'31 smoking cigarettes in safety and j
comfort on the law steps, the situa- j
tion would be bad enough. What
makes matters worse is that no one j
thinks anything of it any more. The ;
campus seems just as constant as it'
the Union fountain was always tilled i
with recalcitrant freshmen and sopho-j
mores could debate with the inmates
of Encina without the danger of being j
