"Not for Publication," by Clara
Sharpe Hough. The Century Co., New
York, $2.00. Granting that most of us
enjoy the vicarious thrill of reading
about millionaires or of the exciting
adventures which come to compara
tively few, here is one author who
still believes there is an appeal in
the dramatization of problems that
might come into the lives of any
modern person.
Presumably that is why Clara
Hough, in her new novel, "Not For
Publication," has chosen for her prin
cipal characters the hard-driven city
editor of a small city newspaper and
his young wife who is the type of
socially graceful, socially-minded wo
man who may be found by the dozens
at any club gathering or bridge party.
Her story is the portrayal and analy
sis of their modern matrimonial prob
lems which happen to be involved in
the swirl of her husband's devotion
to his newspaper duties.
Dave and Serena Morley's troubles
came home to face them in their
chamber and in the drawing rooms of
their friends. If Dave, the city editor,
found solace in the deep eyes of his
woman reporter, he had to follow her
to disappointment at her boarding
house door. And Serena awoke to
realization of her husband's view
point as she lunched at the farshion
ably appointed table of her school-day
friend, the smart Countess Volgel
straum.

I Mrs. Hough is fond of action in her
! stories. She is intent, too, upon creat- J
j ing flesh and blood characters. She ,
| draws upon her own keen observation j
! of a small city's society to present in
i life-like intimacy her Dave and
I Serena and their friends of Pomanset.
i "Not For Publication" as a title will \
be found to refer equally to the story :
j the city editor wouldn't suppress for j
! his wife though she swore her reputa- j
! tion was at stake, so the story the |
! city editor's wife insisted should be !
published though the Countess pro
tested as outraged hostess, and to j
the personal transgressions of the |
' city editor and his pal which, though
| they weren't published, seemed to
j travel around the community just the
! same.
