Don't you think basketball
games are just too thrilling? I
mean there is so much commo
tion and activity, like, that one
hardly knows which player to
watch. Basketball is like keep
away, only once in a while some
one would throw the ball at a
square board and give the other
side a chance at it. Sometimes
the ball would fall through a hoop
and they would stop playing.
But there was a man with a
whistle who always spoiled the
game, I mean he was perfectly
horrid. If I were playing the game
I wouldn't let a man stop my fun
by tooting on a whistle.
If it were not for his interfer
ence he would have been awfully
cute. He ran around with the rest
of the boys like he wanted to
play, but no one ever threw him
the ball. I guess they were mad
at him for stopping the game so
often.
I'm glad I went to the game
It was sort of odd, though. I mean
it was a strange coincidence that
the roughs all happened to be
cheering and clapping at some
thing just when we went in. And
my escort blushed so attractively
for some reason.
Anyway we won. But the judges
weren't sure of it and we had to
play a few extra minutes to prove
we were better.
