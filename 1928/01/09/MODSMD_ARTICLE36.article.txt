# IMPRACTICAL JOKER AROUSES WRATH OF LOCAL FIRE-EATERS
## 
### 
"There's a fire over at 218 Se
quoia," someone shouted through
the telephone at 8 o'clock last
night to Fireman E. O'Reilly.
O'Reilly aroused the other mem
bers of Chief Dugan's fire-eaters.
The phone rang again. "There's
a fire over at 218 Sequoia," some
one again shouted. While the
trucks were being made ready,
the phone rang a third time and
someone announced the fire at
218 Sequoia.
Two chemical trucks and the
hose cart dashed over to Se
quoia. After a few minutes the
trucks returned. With the ob
ject of performing a modified
Hickman, the members of the
fire station would like to know
who turned in that extra false
alarm.
