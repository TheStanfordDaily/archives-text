# FRESHMAN QUINTET SCORES DOUBLE WIN IN WEEK-END TILTS
## First-Year Team Has Strong Offensive; Airtight on Defensive 
### Whitney Wright 
Stanford University's freshman bas
ketball team got off to a flying start
in their first two games of the season
by defeating the College of Pacific
freshmen 35 to 11 Friday night, and
the Oakland Company, California
Grays, 73 to 5, Saturday night, reveal
ing an airtight defense and a remark
able amount of teamwork in both con
tests.
Hawkins, center, and Moffatt, for
ward, were the high-point men Friday
and Saturday night respectively, the
former scoring 11 and the latter 18
points. Reynolds and Tampcke, the
Cardinal babes' first-string guards,
proved faultless in their positions, as
shown by the low scores of the op
posing teams.
In the opening minutes of the first
game the team showed a small
amount of "stage fright" which soon
passed off and allowed them to settle
down to an A-l brand of basketball.
The forward combination of Haw
kins, center, and Freeman and Joujon-
Roche, forwards, started each game,
Loomis, Smith, and Moffatt being sub
stituted in the second half. Bohner,
center, and Snyder, forward, were also
given trials, in which they displayed
a very satisfactory ability, Snyder
scoring 14 points in the second game.
Hepp, Ehrhorn, and Eastman substi
tuted for Reynolds and Tampcke.
Kramarski, with 5 points, and
Grady, with 2, were the high-point
men of the opposing teams Friday
and Saturday nights, respectively.
