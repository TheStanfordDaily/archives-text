### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. S.—(U.P.) —
Governor A1 Smith will be tending his
chores in Albany as usual this week
but still he will be the dominating
presence throughout the gathering of
the national Democratic leaders here.
So far as sentiment can be judged
now, Smith is enthusiastically ac
cepted as the best possible candidate
of the large eastern states which send
the big delegation. But in the South
Smith still stands primarily for the
two things not favorably regarded
politically. If Southern leaders accept
him as is predicted by most of Smith's
friends, it will be because first they
regard him as the best vote-getter in
sight, and second because to revive
the feud of 1924 would only further
jeopardize the party's future.
