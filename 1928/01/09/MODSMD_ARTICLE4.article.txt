# PRESS CONVENTION IN IOWA CITY ATTENDED BY BUFORD O. BROWN
## Stanford Professor Returns To Campus After Ten Days' Absence 
### 
Professor Buford O. Brown of the
Stanford Journalism Division, who
returned to the campus Saturday
after attending the annual meeting of
the American Association of Journal
ism Schools and Departments held
December 28, 29, and 30 at lowa City,
lowa, commented favorably on the
meeting yesterday.
Among the matters taken up was
the proposal that membership in the
association he restricted to those col
leges and universities where instruc
tion in journalism is organized into a
school. The proposed measure was not
adopted and will be considered
again at the 1928 meeting which will
be held at the University of Michigan
at Ann Arbor. Professor Brown said
that the new proposal, if adopted,
would not have affected the Stanford
department, which, though not organ
ized as a school, is organized to con
fer degrees, which gives it almost the
same status as a school.
The officers of the association
elected at the meeting for this year
are Dean A. L. Stone of the Univer
sity of Montana, president; Alan J.
Will of Columbia University, vice
president; and John L. Blumm of the
University of Michigan, secretary
treasurer.
Professor Brown, who was gone
from the campus for about ten days,
visited several of the large universi
ties in the Middle West.
