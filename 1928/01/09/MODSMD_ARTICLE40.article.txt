# EFFORTS TO SELECT JULIAN OIL JURY FAIL
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. B—(U.P.) —
Efforts to obtain a jury to try ten de
fendants with over-issuing of nearly
5,000,000 shares of Julian Petroleum
Corporation stock and thereby caus
ing the collapse of the $100,000,000
organization, will be continued here
tomorrow.
That a jury might not be completed
before the end of this week was in
dicated in the fact that of the 120
peremptory challenges, divided equal-
Jy between the defense and the prose
cution, only eleven have been used
since the case was called last Thurs
day.
