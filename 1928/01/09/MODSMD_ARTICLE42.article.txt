# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Banny, having been banned to the
Beantown Braves for the space of one
Olympiad, is coming back to the Big
Town, this time to play for Brooklyn.
You can't say that Dave was a great
success as a manager, but, then, who
is there who could do anything with
Banny's four-year regime as Boss, the
once great Hub machine finished in
last, fifth, seventh, and seventh posi
tions. Bancroft himself batted .279
in 1924 (the year he was laid up so
much of the season), .317 in 1925,
.311 in '26, and .242 last year. But
Dave gave the leading clubs in the
league a merry time of it each season,
it seeming to be Boston's chief de
light in knocking off the pennant
contenders just when they thought
they were about to have a three- or
four-game rest with "those lowly
Braves."

Dave Bancroft should make him
self very useful in Brooklyn. Hav
ing played with all of the other East
ern clubs of the older circuit, he
naturally wanted to have a fling at
j calling Ebbets Field "home" before
he quit the so-called National Pas
time. He will be 36 years old next
; April, and has played thirteen sea
; sons under the Big Top, so there
probably isn't much good baseball
left in the old boy, but he has enough
j brains to make up for his fast aging
legs, and plenty of fight, and he
| should regain his old batting eye,
j for a time, anyway.
Dave made 39 errors in 1927, but
Wright of the Pirates made 45, and
Farrell of the Giants and Braves,
i
; 40. Anyway, what's an error to dear
old Brooklyn?
