Change in meetings was made by
the Stanford Dames at their first
meeting of the quarter last week. It
was decided that the first meeting of
each month will be a social one,
featuring bridge, sewing, and refresh
ments. The second one, which comes
on the third Thursday of each month,
will feature educational material.
