JETTA GOUDAL in
'The Forbidden Woman'
A Cecil B. De Mille picture with
Victor Varconi and
Joseph Schildkraut
The dramatic story of a woman
spy in Morocco who marries one
man only to fall in love with his
brother, who spurns her, then —•
a remarkable thrill picture of
two continents—Paris and the
arid wastes of Morocco —a
theme admirably directed and
with an amazing climax you'll
never forget.
