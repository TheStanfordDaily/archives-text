# ERNIE NEVERS SEES CARDS IN CAGE PRACTICE
## Former Stanford Mainstay Not Overly Pleased With Showing U.C.L.A. RATED STRONG Smalling at Center Proves Help to Hunt's Team; Is Accurate Shot 
### Merle Emry 
Ernie Nevers came down from the
city yesterday afternoon and in his
visit around the campus dropped in
at the Pavilion to see the Cardinal
varsity basketball squad take its first
workout in preparation for the open
ing conference games here with
U.C.L.A. Friday and Saturday nights.
The blond athlete, who was the
mainstay on several Stanford quintets
himself, made no statement regarding
liis opinion of chances for a winning
team but he looked none too pleased
as the varsity men bungled several
passes and failed to cash in on their
opportunities to score. Ernie was so
absorbed in taking in all the plays
and meeting some of the players that
he was unapproachable for question
ing on how he would rate the Stan
ford team.
After fifteen or twenty minutes of
watching the scrimmage he left for
the city again in one of those big
yellow cars, custom built, with orange
wheels and a green leather top.
Men Are Tired
What Nevers saw was a tired bunch
of men trying to learn some new for
mations to be used against the Bruins.
In addition, Coach Husky Hunt has
been trying to make his players take
it slower and sacrifice some of their
*peed for accuracy. He wants them
to feign passes and take the ball down
the floor with precision.
If the first conference game were
two weeks away instead of only four
days he believes he could accomplish
this object and get it established as
one of the definite rules for his team
to act on. As it is, time is short and
he is afraid that the first string
Cardinals will not be able to handle
some of the trick plays he plans to
give them today and tomorrow.
U.C.L.A. Rates High
U.C.L.A. is rated as having a better
team than last year's and it will be
hoove Stanford to get down to busi
ness the minute the game starts. With
the addition of Smalling at center
the team is materially strengthened.
As it was Hunt was short of center
material with the disqualification of
McCandless.
Smalling seems to be death on the
liucket shots as he counted for four
teen out of fifteen possible basekts.
The only trouble Hunt fears is that
he has not found his "basketball legs"
and is not seasoned into the sport as
he has only been out for a little over
two weeks.
A good center is theoretically rated
as being worth eight points to start
with and if Smal'ing can keep up the
standard lie set in the Fresno game,
Stanford should at least count for
four baskets against the Bruins.

days he believes he could accomplish
this object and get it established as
one of the definite rules for his team
to act on. As it is, time is short and
he is afraid that the first string
Cardinals will not be able to handle
some of the trick plays he plans to
give them today and tomorrow.
U.C.L.A. Rates High
U.C.L.A. is rated as having a better
team than last year's and it will be
hoove Stanford to get down to busi
ness the minute the game starts. With
the addition of Smalling at center
the team is materially strengthened.
As it was Hunt was short of center
material with the disqualification of
McCandless.
Smalling seems to be death on the
liucket shots as he counted for four
teen out of fifteen possible basekts.
The only trouble Hunt fears is that
he has not found his "basketball legs"
and is not seasoned into the sport as
he has only been out for a little over
two weeks.
A good center is theoretically rated
as being worth eight points to start
with and if Smal'ing can keep up the
standard lie set in the Fresno game,
Stanford should at least count for
four baskets against the Bruins.
Ernie Nevers came down from the
city yesterday afternoon and in his
visit around the campus dropped in
at the Pavilion to see the Cardinal
varsity basketball squad take its first
workout in preparation for the open
ing conference games here with
U.C.L.A. Friday and Saturday nights.
The blond athlete, who was the
mainstay on several Stanford quintets
himself, made no statement regarding
liis opinion of chances for a winning
team but he looked none too pleased
as the varsity men bungled several
passes and failed to cash in on their
opportunities to score. Ernie was so
absorbed in taking in all the plays
and meeting some of the players that
he was unapproachable for question
ing on how he would rate the Stan
ford team.
After fifteen or twenty minutes of
watching the scrimmage he left for
the city again in one of those big
yellow cars, custom built, with orange
wheels and a green leather top.
Men Are Tired
What Nevers saw was a tired bunch
of men trying to learn some new for
mations to be used against the Bruins.
In addition, Coach Husky Hunt has
been trying to make his players take
it slower and sacrifice some of their
*peed for accuracy. He wants them
to feign passes and take the ball down
the floor with precision.
