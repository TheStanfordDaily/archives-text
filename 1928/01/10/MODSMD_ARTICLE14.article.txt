# Hold Tryouts for Annual Masquers Production Today
## 
### 
Anna May Price, dramatic director,
will hold tryouts today for the Mas
quers play to be given February 10.
The tryoutees will report at 3:30 and
at 7 o'clock in the Assembly Hall for
the first elimination today. Since this
is the first play of the year there will
be no restriction upon eligibility of
(lie candidates.
The Masquers, Stanford women's
honorary dramatic society, is spon
soring tlie production which is an
nually presented during the winter
quarter. Last year's performance,
"The Swan," by the French play
wright, Franz Molnar, was one of the
most popular plays of the year.
The name of this year's play has
not as yet been announced but the
performance will probably be a light
comedy. Students who have appeared
in past productions, as well as new
talent, are urged to come out for the
tryouts by Miss Price.
