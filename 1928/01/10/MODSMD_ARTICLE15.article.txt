something novel for a concert stage, the
group of three men and three women sit
around a table and unfold their program
of old English motets, madrigals, and
folk songs. Their reputation for inimi

groups to give new students and others
an opportunity to purchase the special
tickets. They may also be obtained at
the A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union.
