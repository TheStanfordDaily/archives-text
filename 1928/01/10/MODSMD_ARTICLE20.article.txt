# COACH HUNT PRAISES ALL BABE CAGERS AS 'TRIPLE THREAT MEN'
## 
### 
"Triple-threat men, every one "
Those are the words of "Husky"
Hunt, Cardinal basketball coach, after
watching the freshman cagers in ac
tion last Friday and Saturday nights
in their first two games of the season.
"Every player on the team can
pass, dribble, and shoot with equal [
ability, keeping their opponents guess
ing with the variety of their attack,"
says Hunt. "Most of the babe cagers
possess plenty of height, and those
who do not make up for this in their
ability to get off the floor while pass
ing and shooting."
This week the freshman quintet
faces three tough teams, playing the
Armstrong College of Business Ad
ministration on Wednesday night, the
San Jose High School on Friday, and
the Piedmont High School on Satur
day.
The latter two are among the best
high school teams in this section of
the state, both being undefeated up
to this time. Very little is known of
the Armstrong College five.
Different Combinations
Assistant Coach "Muggs" Mitchell
has been working two different for
ward combinations together in the
practice sessions, using Hawkins,
center, and Freeman and Joujon-
Roche, forwards, as the first string.
Still another combination which has
not yet been tried, due to injuries to
two of the players, is Mears, center,
and Fawcett and Snyder, forwards.
Mears, one of tlie most promising
members of the squad until he injured
his ankle over a week ago, is back
in a suit. He will probably not be able i
to do much playing in this week's j
contests. Fawcett, a fast forward, is !
also back, but will be kept from active j
playing for some time.
Competition Keen
Competition for the forward berths
is still keen, due to the ability of the
candidates for these positions, Snyder
is exceptionally fast, but handicapped
by his smallness. Fawcett, Moffatt,
and Freeman possess both speed and
size. Smith, somewhat slower, is a
steady player.
Bohner, a new candidate for the
pivot position, gives plenty of promise
of developing into first-string material
before the season is over, although
his playing in Friday and Saturday
nights' games was not in a class?'with
that of his teammates.
â€¢Leon Levi, basketball manager, has
announced two changes in the team's
schedule. San Jose High School has
been substituted for Oakland High
School on January 13, and San Mateo
Junior College for Palo Alto High
School 011 February 8.
