The Bluebirds got off to a fast start
in the first intramural hoop contest
yesterday afternoon by trouncing El
Cuadro 20 to 3. After the opening
few minutes, the game was simply a
question of how many times the win
ners could hit the basket, since they
were able to shoot almost at will. El
Cuadro failed to score after the first
half. S. Nye, Bluebird forward, was
the outstanding performer of the con
test. He scored ten of his team's
points.

of GO to 0. Osmonson and Davis of

the center of the floor, none of which
found the basket, featured El Capi
tan's play.
