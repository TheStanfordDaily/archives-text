# Something Missing

It it a matter of routine that practically every history course whether
it deals with ancient Rome or modern China has for its early subject
matter a brief discussion and outline of the geography of the particular
locality under consideration. J itne and again the smatterings of geo
graphy which the student may remember from such sources will be
found valuable through enriching readings of current events or literature.
Ilaliburton's "Royal Road to Romance," Hergesheimer's "Tampico," or
Marcasson s '"Caravans of Commerce" all mean much more to the
reader who is familiar with the places mentioned. The same is true of
the news dispatches of the world, served up each morning and evening
iu the hodge-podge of what is called the American newspaper.
A diamond rush in South Africa, the 124 th anniversary of inde
pendence in Haiti, the recurring troubles in Bulgaria, and the towns and
cities of Nicaragua which are now the scenes of front page news in
papers thousands of miles awayâ€”of such stuff is geography made. To
be able to properly locate these places enriches one's understanding of the
days news. Such an ability should be part of the equipment of all college
students.
A course in geography, paying some attention to commercial con
siderations of imports, exports, and industries of the various countries
would go far in providing such knowledge. Granted that one might have
taken geography six or seven years ago in grammar school but we
question whether the memory of the various facts learned at that time
is still fresh and available.
It is our opinion that there is a sad deficiency in the University's
schedule of courses since there is 110 course listed that even approximates
the subject of geography. Several years ago a course iu Economic
Geography was given, though why it was discontinued we cannot say.
However, the suggestion of instituting a similar course seems worth
considering.
