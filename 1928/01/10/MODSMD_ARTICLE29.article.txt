### Vern Cordry "HUMOR 
Two similar words,
And not much "think,"
A little dip,
In a jug of ink.
A tortured jest,
Some hackneyed "Fun";
He did his best
Hut wrote a pun.
"Crom," '31.

HEARD AT THE BOOKSTORE
"Five dollars! Why, man, I wouldn't
have bought it hut it said 'free verse'
on the cover!"

MY ROOMMATE SAiD
My roommate studies French. Last
night he interrupted my perusal of a
magazine with this prize remark —
"There are five moods in French in
stead of four. They are the indica
tive, imperative, conditional, subjunc
tive —and passionate."
—Alviso Al, '31.
Q ♦ •
"You've never met my brother Os
wald?" inquired Archie politely as he

! pushed a. spindle-legged frosh into the
| office ahead of himself.
"I don't believe I've had that
honor," I said as I shook hands with
Oswald, whose smooth face, long,
curly hair, and pansy-blue eyes belied
the typical Tewksbury "wbo-the-hell
cares" attitude. Yes, Oswald looked
even giddier than Archie!
"It's a damn shame. A damn, dirty
shame!" yammered Oswald, getting
very red.
"That I hadn't met you before?" I
"Naw!" The bawlouts! They should
be abolished! I could run in a Quad
election on a 'No Bawlout' platform
and win! Archie said, 'You can't send
vitriol or bombs in the mail why
don't, you deliver it yourself'—so I'm
j here!"
"But I'm not!" I shouted, dashing
I for the door.
| Archie shoved me away from the
1 door just in time to miss the bull-like
charge of young Oswald, dashing out
for a breath of cool air. "Your baby
brother is a bolshevist!" I said as I
hastily locked the door.
"No," said Archie, "he, too, is wax
ing poetic. Look!"
Stuck on my file was Oswald's siz-

zling "pome"—
"I'll buy up all tlie Bawlouts
To hide what causes shame.
Who likes to see a minus sign
Tacked on his tribal name?"
