# LOS ANGELES ORCHESTRA VISITS SAN FRANCISCO IN EXCHANGE CONCERT SERIES
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Comparisons may be odious, but
there are certain occasions which
must inevitably provoke comparisons,
whose chief interest and stimulation
lie in the very fact that they offer
opportunity for such ratings. And
such an occasion was the really nota
ble series of musical events which
took place last Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday in San Francisco: the con
certs of the Los»Angeles Philharmonic
Orchestra, under its new and greater
conductor, Georg Schneevoigt.
Los Angeles music lovers, too, had
their opportunity, for at the same
time, Dr. Alfred Hertz and his men
wore in the City of Angels giving re
citals. The scheme of exchanging
these two great organizations, unques
tionably the finest orchestral groups
west of Philadelphia, was put into ef
fect this year for the first time. It
was the logical thing to do, and has
been for some time past, but finan

| cial and administrative difficulties
| (something like two times a hundred
I men going two times five hundred
! miles, with everything from piccolos
to harps and bull fiddles!) had pre
vented. But now it has Ueen success
fully done, and sets a precedent, not
j only for the two great California en
sembles, but for orchestras the coun
: try over.
Advantageous Variation
It was a very advantageous varia
tion in the annual artistic programs
! of both cities, can do nothing but pro
; mote the feeling of friendship and
! mutual respect find as for making
J either group of concert goers dis
satisfied with their own —well, human
attachments, habits, and prejudices
| being what they are, the result will
doubtless be collective sighs of
j mingled welcome and relief when the
| familiar faces and the familiar figures
| are once again on the concert plat-
j forms of the respective cities.
To begin with, Georg Schneevoigt
is a very remarkable man. In about
four months he lias so securely estab
! iished himself in the affections of the
entire Los Angeles music public that
i they fairly thank their angels for him
! at every concert —and what is more,
j they flock to hear him. He is not, in
his directing, the whole-souled, hearty,
| and straightforward stirrer of great
1 cauldrons of sound that Alfred Hertz
is; he is far more complex a poet,
and an ecstatic high priest who feels
the emotional burden of each piece
of music so keenly that, though above
! any meretricious striving for plat
form effect, he gestures, grows ex
i cited, pleads, yearns, begs, bullies,
| and weeps over his orchestra with
! such fervor and abandon that San
| Franciscans, seeing him for the first
I time, smiled. But he gets music—
| such music! —from his men, and lie
gets his interpretation.
Lacks String Section
But alas for Mr. Schneevoigt in just
one respect: he hasn't, as yet, at
least, the splendidly sonorous string
section that Hertz has built up and
kept. With a first violinist like the
redoubtable Mischel Plastro (and this
exchange has shown what a difference
a first violinist can make!) the San
Franciscans have a tremendous ad
vantage. And back of , Piastro is a
group of artists in violins and violas
and basses who have played together
for longer, and are, in general, of
technical accomplishments superior to
those who fiddle behind and beside |
the pedantic and rather negative Al
fred Megerlin, first violin of the Los
Angeles group.
But the law of compensation comes j
into play: when Schneevoigt raises j
the tip of his baton in his gesture
toward high heaven he evokes answer j
from a chorus of brasses whose mag
nificent richness and sweetness of i
tone far surpasses that of the cor-1
responding group under Hertz. Trump
ets, trombones, and tubas join with
the French horns in a way which is
positively a revelation in the south
ern organization. In the woodwind
sections Los Angeles has, in our
opinion, a slight lead, with solo oboist,
flutist, and basoonist all artists of the
first water.
