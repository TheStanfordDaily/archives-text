FANTASIA IMPROMPTU
Random Thoughts:
Wonder if they have to sign sort of
an Honor System Pledge—l promise
that contact between bloomers and
stocking tops shall be established at
all times, with half an inch overlap.
Otherwise I agree to withdraw from
the university.

Edna to Etta: Believe me, from now
on I use Destructo Washing Powder,
what I mean. Why, would you believe
it, the last time I tried Bubbles Flakes

Bloomington — Enterprising mer

THE HOOSIER HOLLA?""
j Oh, stockings up, and bloomers down
j And ever the twain shall meet
j Or a spying eye, and a muffled cry

For hours, sternly earned will go
And transgressor will go too
So see it's right and contacts tight

I Oli watch yourself and watch yourself
J If sheepskin is your goal
For if they see a bit of skin *!
And if you roll, you'll ROLL!!
