NEWCOMERS
A revived basketball varsity that
gives promise of going far and doing
much in this season's race will start
its conference schedule Friday night.
Quite appropriately, the University of .
California at Los Angeles, newest i
member of the P.C.C., is Stanford's'
opponent in two games which ought i
distinctly to enliven the week-end.
As the Bruins are for the first time J
clashing with a Redshirt team as j
members of the same athletic loop, j
Friday will be an important night for j
the U.C.L.A. five. The Rally Commit
tee doubtless will consider making a
special effort to welcome the fledg
lings in a way which will impress
them with the enthusiasm Stanford
men feel over their entry into the !
conference.

OUT OF THE RUT
Friday may we!! rnrrk the turn
ing point in basketball for Stan
ford, too. Husky Hunt's men gave
indication last Saturday night
when they defeated Fresno that j
at last they had got 1928's new
leaf turned over and were ready
to go.
Fight and dash swung the vic
tory to Stanford Saturday. Dash
is what the team has lacked all
season, but when Smalling and
Vincenti went into the game, a
different, more indomitable spirit
seized the team, the play b2came
tense, and the "S" side of the

scoreboard began to show signs
of activity.

Encomiums of Stanford athletes,
both basketball and football men,
have been littering the sport pages
of the newspapers the last few days,
but nary a word has been said about
Louis Vincenti's colossal feat of mak
ing a straight A average in law dur
ing fall quarter. At the same time he
held down a seat in the Men's Coun
cil as well as the end berth on the
football varsity. That's an all-Ameri
can accomplishment.

OFF THE DIME!
Intramural basketball is with
us. To those who don't realize
the fact it should be said that
the intramural program is one of
the popular Stanford traditions.
Freshmen often fail to appreci
ate the value of engaging in intra
mural sports. Those who do reap
a two-fold benefit — they get
needed exercise and they meet on
the basketball floor representa
tive men of the halls and the Row
in a valuable, intimate way which

is never approached during the
rushing season.
