# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Among hocky men around (he Na- i
tional Hockey League circuit, John :
Ross Roach, of the Toronto "Maple |
Leafs," is considered the best of all
the goalies. Picking one goal-minder
out of a group that includes Clint
Benedict of Montreal, Happy Holmes
of Detroit, Alex Connell of Ottawa, i
Roy Worters of Pittsburgh, and
George Hainsworth of the Canadians,
is some job, I admit, but John Ross
Roach suits me, and [ hope he suits
you. He's little, to be sure, in spite of
his bulky appearance in his clumsy
pads, but Little Johnny Roach is
there —don't you worry about his be- j
ing small.
Back in 1920, Roach joined the To- j
ronto "St. Pats," as they were then !
called, and made a hit at once. He
got his chance when another little
goal-minder, Vernon Forbes, was a
hold-out. Roach is a great skater —as
all goalies have to be —a cool, quick
thinker when two opponents are tear
ing down the ice trying to beat him
with the puck, and he has a way of

| making miraculous saves with a min
| imum of effort. Lester Patrick of the
Rangers calls him the hardest goalie
I liis team has to beat, and Lester
knows his goalies, having played the
position himself and even scored a
goal while doing it.
Too bad that Mickey Roach isn't
with the Americans now. Toronto
meets the star-spangled New York
outfit in Madison Square Garden to
night, and one of the seemingly
! fierce, though really friendly, feuds
of hockey was that between Roach
j of Toronto and Roach of New York
1 last season. They are not related, the
: two Roaches, and each used to do his
] best to take the puck away from the
! other, with a loud accompaniment of
kidding.
