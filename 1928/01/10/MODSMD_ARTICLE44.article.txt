# RETURN ENGAGEMENT WITH PITT PANTHERS IMPOSSIBLE-WARNER
## 
### 
Pop Warner put the quietus on all
talk of a return engagement with
Pittsburgh next year, when he re
marked during the week-end that
such a game was out of the question
until football teams could travel by
airplane to save time. His remark was
in answer to a statement made by
Jock Sutherland, University of Pitts
burgh coach, who expressed the de
sire to see the Cardinals and the
Panthers meet in the East next year.
Pointing out that December weath
er was exceedingly bad as far as
football is concerned, Warner said the
game would have to be played in the
West. Inasmuch as Christmas vaca
tion is the only time Stanford could
take a long trip without interfering
too much with studies, the Cards are
thus eliminated, he declared.
Warner had little to say concerning
the possibilities of Stanford engaging
in another Tournament of Roses
game, expressing doubt that they

] would play even if winners of the
Pacific Coast title.
j Coach Warner was only moderately
j enthusiastic concerning the prospects
of Stanford's having a winning eleven
next year, remarking that he expected
a good team because of such excel
| lent replacement material.
