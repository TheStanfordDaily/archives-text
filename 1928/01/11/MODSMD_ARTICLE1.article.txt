# HUNT'S NEWLY FORMED TEAM SHOWS POWER
## Cardinal Quintet Features Air-Tight Zone Defense In Fast Practice BRUINS STILL RATE ODDS U.C.L.A. to Enter Conference Basketball in Friday Night's Contest 
### Merle Emry 
Husky Hunt's newly discovered
basketball combination is fast de
veloping into a first-class team, if the
performance in yesterday's practice
can be taken as an indication of its
possible strength.
This quintet was uncovered in the
Fresno State game where it showed
fast offensive work and plenty of
fight. Hunt has kept these men play
ing together since then. They are
Berg and Vincenti, forwards; Small
ing. center; and Thompson and Roth
ert, guards.
Odds Favor Bruins
The Bruins have the odds in their
favor for winning tlie opening confer
ence game here Friday night but
Stanford's chances seem to be im
proving as practice goes on. This will
be the U.C.L.A.'s first game in the
Pacific Coast Conference and the
Bruins will be out to make a good
impression. However, they will be
forced to break through the Cardinal
five-man zone defense before they
can do a great deal of damage.
This defense work was stressed
heavily in the program of yesterday
afternoon's workout. With Rothert
and Thompson each weighing in the
neighborhood of ISS pounds, playing
the guarding positions, and Smalling,
who is a heavyweight himself, at cen
ter Stanford has material for a well
balanced zone defense system. Both
Berg and Vincenti are light and shifty
and should be able to take care of an
intruding center or forwards.
Hunt mapped out on the floor with
■chalk the zone each player was sup
posed to take care of and then pitted
this newly formed team against an
other quintet using the Bruin method
of playing, which is running in of
the center and a forward on one side
of the floor and the other forward on
the opposite side.
Show Well in Practice
Clark, center, and Bryant and Rich
ards, forwards, were delegated to do
the advancing, but they could not
reach the seventeen-foot line and
were so rushed in this territory that
they had no opportunity to shoot ac
curately. As this co-operation on the
defense might be luck, Coacli Hunt,
sent both teams to scrimmaging. The
result was the same and Hunt grinned
broadly for the first time this year,
according to the managers. In order
that his charges might not see his ap
proval too apparently he brought his
sawed-off megaphone up to his face
and called for some passing exercises.
The Cardinal mentor's system calls
for a five-man zone defense that can
break quickly enough to form a fast
offensive drive. To do this short ac
curate passes are necessary and with
two more practices available the
Cardinals should be able to brush up
in this department of the game.

fast offensive work and plenty of
fight. Hunt has kept these men play
ing together since then. They are
Berg and Vincenti, forwards; Small
ing. center; and Thompson and Roth
ert, guards.
Odds Favor Bruins
The Bruins have the odds in their
favor for winning tlie opening confer
ence game here Friday night but
Stanford's chances seem to be im
proving as practice goes on. This will
be the U.C.L.A.'s first game in the
Pacific Coast Conference and the
Bruins will be out to make a good
impression. However, they will be
forced to break through the Cardinal
five-man zone defense before they
can do a great deal of damage.
This defense work was stressed
heavily in the program of yesterday
afternoon's workout. With Rothert
and Thompson each weighing in the
neighborhood of ISS pounds, playing
the guarding positions, and Smalling,
who is a heavyweight himself, at cen
ter Stanford has material for a well
balanced zone defense system. Both
Berg and Vincenti are light and shifty
and should be able to take care of an
intruding center or forwards.
Hunt mapped out on the floor with
■chalk the zone each player was sup
posed to take care of and then pitted
this newly formed team against an
other quintet using the Bruin method
of playing, which is running in of
the center and a forward on one side
of the floor and the other forward on
the opposite side.
Show Well in Practice
Clark, center, and Bryant and Rich
ards, forwards, were delegated to do
the advancing, but they could not
reach the seventeen-foot line and
were so rushed in this territory that
they had no opportunity to shoot ac
curately. As this co-operation on the
defense might be luck, Coacli Hunt,
sent both teams to scrimmaging. The
result was the same and Hunt grinned
broadly for the first time this year,
according to the managers. In order
that his charges might not see his ap
proval too apparently he brought his
sawed-off megaphone up to his face
and called for some passing exercises.
The Cardinal mentor's system calls
for a five-man zone defense that can
break quickly enough to form a fast
offensive drive. To do this short ac
curate passes are necessary and with
two more practices available the
Cardinals should be able to brush up
in this department of the game.
Husky Hunt's newly discovered
basketball combination is fast de
veloping into a first-class team, if the
performance in yesterday's practice
can be taken as an indication of its
possible strength.
This quintet was uncovered in the
Fresno State game where it showed
fast offensive work and plenty of
fight. Hunt has kept these men play
ing together since then. They are
Berg and Vincenti, forwards; Small
ing. center; and Thompson and Roth
ert, guards.
