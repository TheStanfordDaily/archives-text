# MUDFIGHT CHANGED TO ANNUAL TIE-UP BY EX COMMITTEE
## Van Amringe Recommends More Stress on Honor System Spirit 
### 
That the A.S.S.U. by-laws be
amended to change the annual mud
fight between the sophomore and
freshman classes to a tie-up was en
acted by the Executive Committee
last night.
The first mud-figlit was contested in
19215 between the classes of 1926 and
1927. Previous to this, tie-ups and pos
ter fights had been staged. The new
ruling is a return to the tie-up of five
years ago.
Recommendations were brought be
fore the Executive Committee in re
gard to the upholding of the Honor
Spirit at Stanford by John D. Van
Amringe, in his report on the con
vention of the National Student Fed
eration last month to which he was a
delegate. Van Amringe made his
recommendations in keeping with the
work done by the national conven
tion.
His recommendations were that the
student governing bodies post quar
terly notices before finals in regard
to the honor system spirit, that spon
sors show greater activity in instilling
the spirit of the honor system in
freshmen, that professors and coaches
informally stress the elements of
honor and character to their students,
that campus publications informally
support the system, and that special
stress he made in the Frosh Bible
upon the honor system.
The major points of the honor sys
tem brought out at the convention
were: honesty in classroom and class
work, refraining from scalping tickets
to athletic games, adherence of var
sity teams to training rules, refrain
ing from passing bad checks, and in
curring bad debts, and the keeping of
any "gentleman's agreement." Per
sonal ethics are the obligation of the
individual.
Eleanor Davidson, one of the dele
gates to the convention, reported that
no satisfactory solution to the student
automobile problem has been found
in any school. Common sense in traffic
regulations seems to have been found
to he the best course, said Miss David
son.
