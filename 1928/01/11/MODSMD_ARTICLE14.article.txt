ROME, Jan. 10. â€”World-wide Chris
tian unity can be attained only when
Protestants embrace Catholicism by
rejoining the Catholic Apostolic Ro
man Church which is "the only true
Christ's church," Pope Pius XI said
today in a 5,000-word encyclical.
The pronouncement banished the
hope of many churchmen for the re
union of some forms of Protestantism
with the Roman Church. The encycli
cal was a direct answer to the Lam
bert, Malines, and Lausanne con
gresses which sought to effect church
unity.
"How can unity be maintained
when each has his own opinion?" the
Pope asked, striking at the contro
versy between modernism and funda
mentalism.
Such movements prove the dissen
sion in Protestantism, said the Pope,
as compared with the unity of doc
trine and government of the Roman
Church.
