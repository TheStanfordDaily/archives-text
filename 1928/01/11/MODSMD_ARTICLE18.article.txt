# COLLEGE EDUCATED AIREDALE, FIJI PET, DIES OF POISONING
## 
### 
"Pooch! Pooch, look at me!"
gently commanded one of a num
ber of students grouped about
an airdale who was seemingly re
covering from a sudden spasm.
But Pooch did not look. He was
dead â€”poisoned.
Pooch, the Fiji house pet and
mascot, had won a place in the
hearts of student animal lovers.
His punctual daily appearance
on the Quad has drawn comment
from his friends. Being a college
dog, he considered it no less
than his due that he should have
a college education. His daily
ejection from classrooms did not
cool his ardent desire for learn
ing. But Pooch is no more.
