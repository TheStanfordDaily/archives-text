# FRESHMEN TO MEET ARMSTRONG QUINTET FOR THIRD CONTEST
## Babes to Be Without Three First String Stars in Friday s Game 
### 
Assistant Coach Muggs Mitchell will
send his highly rated freshman bas
ketball team against the Armstrong
College of Business Administration
from Oakland in the Pavilion tomor
row night. The babes will enter their
third game of the season minus three
of their stellar performers, Tampcke,
Fawcett, and Snyder.
Tampcke, first-string guard and one
of the steadiest players on the team,
is suffering from an infection, which
will probably keep him from practice
for the rest of the week. His loss will
mean the breaking up of the Rey
nolds-Tampeke combination which
was mainly responsible for the low
scores of the opposing teams in the
first two contests.
Hepp, a substitute guard and a fast
and heady player, will start the game
in Tampcke's place alongside of Rey
nolds. Ehrhorn, another guard substi
tute, will also probably see action.
Fawcett is still awaiting the medi
cal adviser's permission to return to
practice, and it is doubtful if he will
even be in a suit tomorrow night.
Joujon-Roche, another speedy forward,
will take Fawcett's place in the start
ing line-up,
The other forward berth will be
filled by Hawkins, who previously
played center, since Mears, first-string
center who has been out of the
because of an injury to his ankle, will
return to the team tomorrow night.
The personnel of the freshman
cagers was considerably weakened
yesterday when Kenneth Snyder,
recognized as the fastest player on
the squad, left school to play on the
Hollywood Athletic Club team. Sny
der was rated as one of the best shots
on the squad and was making a
strong bid for a position on the first
team.
