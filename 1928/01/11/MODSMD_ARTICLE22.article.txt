Grief rode into the Deke camp last
night when they lost a hard-fought
contest to Theta Chi by the margin
of a goal made on a freak play in
which Wild, Deke guard, knocked the
ball into his opponents' basket. The
Phi Psi's, at the hands of the Alpha
Delt's, took the worst trouncing of
the evening, losing 32 to 11. Encina
2E forfeited to Beta Theta Pi.
Keeping the ball in their opponents'
territory, Branner Hall outplayed
Toyon to win 14 to 7. Led by Dubinski
the men from the distant hall were
never headed. Poor shooting on both
sides featured the contest.
Ending in a hotly contested game,
Theta Chi edged out Delta Kappa Ep
silon 11 to 9. Although never leading,
the Dekes came up in the last few
minutes to tie the score and then
lost by one basket. Theta Chi showed
more consistent floor work through
out the game. Green and Rcasor at
forward led the attack, Richmond's
height tapped two baskets for the
winners.
Shooting baskets from all angles,
Alpha Delta Phi trounced Phi Kappa
Psi 32 to 11. The Moore-Duckett com
bination scored well, the latter man
accounting for twelve points to share
lienors for the high-point man of the
evening. Anderson, Knox, and Mc-
Cone showed consistently for the
losers.
Delta Tau Delta had its own way
for the first half of the game with
the Theta Xi's, only to lose by the
latter's opponents' surprising rally in
the fourth period. Crary starred for
the Delts and was high point-scorer
of the game.
In a rough tussle the Encina 4-E
team came out victorious over Zeta
Psi, 15 to 12. The men from the fresh
man hall were heavily outweighed,
but obtaining the lead in the first
quarter, held their own for the re
mainder of the game.
Delta Chi won 22 to 20 over the
All-Blacks after trailing for three
quarters. Neikirk was outstanding for
the All-Blacks.
