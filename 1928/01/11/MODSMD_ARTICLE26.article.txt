# Differences of Opinion
## 
### 
In the December issue of the Illustrated Reviciv was a plea for $75,000
lo make up a deficiency in the First Million for Stanford. The Stanford
Alumni Association undertook, some months ago, to raise the $75,000.
.There is in this request for contributions what appears to us to be a very
significant sentence: "Let's not let differences of opinion on University
policies, nor even personal prejudice, mar the Stanford spirit." By mar
ring the Stanford spirit is meant the failure to contribute money for the
First Million which it is planned will be used to insure adequate salaries to
professors. There can be 110 question but that this object is a worthy one
fully deserving support of alumni and friends.
However, that phrase "differences of opinion on University policies"
seems to 11s as referring to the pro's and cons of the Lower Division ques
tion. Interpreting it as such it appears, then, that here is printed evidence
of the difficulties which are facing the University as a result of the raising
of this question. Undoubtedly there are those to whom the thought of
contributing money to the University would be unwelcome were the Lower
Division to be dropped.
For the time being the question of limitation of the Lower Division
will probably be left dormant except in discussions in alumni club lunch
eons. The action of the Board of Trustees last October in setting a limit
of 350 upon entering Lower Division students for next fall marked a par
tial victory for the forces which would limit (and perhaps abolish) the first
two years. Appended to the formal wording of the resolution was this
statement: "No determination for the elimination of the Lower Division
has been made by the Board of Trustees." Official action, then, will be
silent while conversation artists of the alumni clubs have their chance. It
is in deference to these "differences of opinion" that it is urged with what
approximates Rotarianism that Stanford spirit be not marred. It is unfor
tunate for the University that this situation comes about. Stanford is a
young university; its alumni body, therefore, does not offer as large a field
to draw upon for contributions as is the case in older universities.
However unfortunate the situation may be, the opposition factions in
alumni circles to the Lower Division proposals have firm arguments â€”ones
not necessarily based 011 the desire to keep the college as it used to be in
the "good old days."
