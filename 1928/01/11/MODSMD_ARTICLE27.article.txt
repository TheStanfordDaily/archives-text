The efforts of officialdom in its zeal to see that youth is properly taken
care of are often amusing. For example, we hear that a new regulation

parties during the college week-end functions must be submitted to the
President's office for inspection and have his approval before the invita
tions are issued." Must we entertain the notion that the inspector of the
lists will have to have a very wide acquaintance in order to make his ap
proval at all fair?
