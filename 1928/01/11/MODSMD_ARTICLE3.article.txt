# AMERICA IS ADAPTED TO INTERNATIONALISM SAYS EDGAR ROBINSON
## Professor Declares United States Is League of Nations by Self 
### 
Although European nations are ac-;
tively in favor of the League of Na-1
tions, America is more aflapted to in- j
ternationalism, according to Professor
Edgar E. Robinson, of the Stanford |
History Department, who spoke on j
"An American Looks at Europe—and
America" in the Little Theatre last
night.
Professor Robinson showed that
the United States, with its large va
riety of races and climates, is in real
ity a League of Nations in itself, i
"Naturally we pointed the way, and !
ultimately we will return," he said.
The discouragement of Englishmen !
for England's future was described by !
Robinson who cited the opinions of |
numerous British statesmen and 1
scholars, all of whom believe that the
greatness of their country is passing. !
"In France considerable attention j
is being given to the History of the j
United States," he said, but pointed ;
out the lack of knowledge of modern
American history, and the scarcity of
American books in England. English
textbooks, such as there are, he de- j
clared, place the blame for the colo- j
nial revolution not upon the colonies,
but upon the English king, his minis- :
ters, and upon the British people. I
"Films do distort American life," ■
he said, and the news Europeans re
ceive of the United States is meagre .
and often inaccurate.
Professor Robinson declared that i
Mussolini, Poincaire, Lloyd George, j
Mayor Thompson, Governor A1 Smith, !
were typical of the spirit of their \
followers, and that Woodrow Wilson
expresses the spirit of Geneva.
