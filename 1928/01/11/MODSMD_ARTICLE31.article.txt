"Adventures in Arabia," by W. B. Sea-!
brook. Harcourt, Brace, & Co.
Seabrook is not a name, so far as !
this reviewer knows, that resounds
in the annals of literature; nor is it !
inscribed in any hall of fame. It ought |
to be —for it was a gentleman of that J
name that wrote this little secret and
mystery of Arabia. Anyway his name
is suggestive of long wanderings, and
at any rate, he and Katie wandered
into the land of camels and Bedouins, i
the whirling dervishes and the goats, j
the Druses and devil-worshippers, j
Therefore make way for a joyous
book —if there are thrills in it here
and there —so much keener is the joy
that chiefly abounds.
Fully half of the book is concerned
with a fascinating account of the !
author's visit as an honored guest in
the tent of Mitkhal Pasha El Fayiz, ■
sheik of sheiks, who lives by com- 1
pelling women and Christians to till
their extensive lands and by making i
raids on the camel and goat herds of 1
the other tribes. Here the white man j
stayed day after day, drinking coffee, !
tearing his dinner with his naked
hands from the carcass of the whole j
goat or even a camel. The meat was :
roasted whole like a Thanksgiving pig 1
and brought to the dining floor whole j
on a charger ten feet long borne by a j
dozen struggling slaves. Here he J
talked religion and legend with his j
most gracious host and rode in I

grazzhu with the tribe which had
temporarily adopted him.

Now, any man, possessed with ordi
nary courage and tact, might do these
things, but few could write about
them with the lucidity and sympathy
that this man has. His story is as
vivid as a Conrad novel, yet has the
ring of authenticity and fidelity to
detailed fact which is impossible of
achievement in fiction.
He displays genius, saving the tre
mendous love story of Gutne, famed
among all the Moslems for her beauty
and power over men, for the last
among his exciting Bedouin tales. It
is as moving and powerful as the
story of Judith and Holofernes, and
lias a woman's curse in it that is as
provocative of that strange thrill of
admiring terror as that song which
Judith sang when she returned with
the bleeding head in her innocent
looking leather bag.
There will come a time, probably,
when no more hidden corners of the
earth's surface tempt the cosmically
curious. Egypt will be stripped of her
secrets, Arabia will have no more
mysteries, and few countries will have
mystic melodies for stories, and the
utimate Thule itself will be removed
from the universe to some stellar
system yet to be discovered. That will
be a pity for a book like this will no
longer be of any greater importance
than a telephone directory.—E.L.S.

brook. Harcourt, Brace, & Co.
Seabrook is not a name, so far as !
this reviewer knows, that resounds
in the annals of literature; nor is it !
inscribed in any hall of fame. It ought |
to be —for it was a gentleman of that J
name that wrote this little secret and
mystery of Arabia. Anyway his name
is suggestive of long wanderings, and
at any rate, he and Katie wandered
into the land of camels and Bedouins, i
the whirling dervishes and the goats, j
the Druses and devil-worshippers, j
Therefore make way for a joyous
book —if there are thrills in it here
and there —so much keener is the joy
that chiefly abounds.
Fully half of the book is concerned
with a fascinating account of the !
author's visit as an honored guest in
the tent of Mitkhal Pasha El Fayiz, ■
sheik of sheiks, who lives by com- 1
pelling women and Christians to till
their extensive lands and by making i
raids on the camel and goat herds of 1
the other tribes. Here the white man j
stayed day after day, drinking coffee, !
tearing his dinner with his naked
hands from the carcass of the whole j
goat or even a camel. The meat was :
roasted whole like a Thanksgiving pig 1
and brought to the dining floor whole j
on a charger ten feet long borne by a j
dozen struggling slaves. Here he J
talked religion and legend with his j
most gracious host and rode in I

grazzhu with the tribe which had
temporarily adopted him.

Now, any man, possessed with ordi
nary courage and tact, might do these
things, but few could write about
them with the lucidity and sympathy
that this man has. His story is as
vivid as a Conrad novel, yet has the
ring of authenticity and fidelity to
detailed fact which is impossible of
achievement in fiction.
He displays genius, saving the tre
mendous love story of Gutne, famed
among all the Moslems for her beauty
and power over men, for the last
among his exciting Bedouin tales. It
is as moving and powerful as the
story of Judith and Holofernes, and
lias a woman's curse in it that is as
provocative of that strange thrill of
admiring terror as that song which
Judith sang when she returned with
the bleeding head in her innocent
looking leather bag.
There will come a time, probably,
when no more hidden corners of the
earth's surface tempt the cosmically
curious. Egypt will be stripped of her
secrets, Arabia will have no more
mysteries, and few countries will have
mystic melodies for stories, and the
utimate Thule itself will be removed
from the universe to some stellar
system yet to be discovered. That will
be a pity for a book like this will no
longer be of any greater importance
than a telephone directory.—E.L.S.
