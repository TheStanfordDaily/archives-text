PETTiN' POMES
Take aim and fire
At Tommy Tryor
Stopped his car
"To fix a tire."
Southward wends
My roommate's way.
San Jose schoolmarms—
Easy prey.
A lost "date"
Is Agnes Glinn.
She signed for 1:30,
But didn't get in.

MY ROOMMATE SAID
My roommate, who is always up-to- j
date on the latest, wants to know j
where he can find a dancing teacher ;
to instruct him in the Bahai Move- -
ment! "O-meer-A," '31.
* * *
Well, "O-meer-A," '31, that's even
worse than my own roommate's con- j
ception of the Bahai Movement —he j
wanted to know if it was better than
a Waltham, or a Howard movement —
in a watch! —Ed.

AN EMBARRASSING MOMENT
An old grad returned home at a
late hour slightly "oiled." He tried to
unlock the doorbell and, not succeed
ing in this, he rang the keyhole for J
half an hour. How long this might 1
have continued no one can guess, had
not a passerby informed him that it j
was a vacant house. —"Crom," '31.

Archie took a pick-and-shovel job 1
during the Christmas holidays with
the following results:
1. Four blisters.
Archie took a pick-and-shovel job
2. Sore muscles.
3. One check —concerning which he i
wrote this touching little poem:
WAGES
"This is my first pay?
■ —For a whole week's work, you :
say?
But man, it takes just six
Like these to pay
My 'ninety-six.' "

PUBLIC SPEAKING
In lilting metre
Poets sing their strain.
In halting words
I repeat their song again.
Hesitating, tongue-tied,
Gawd! It makes me sore—
Tlemorizin' poetry
For Public Speaking 4.
