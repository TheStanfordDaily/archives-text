# STUDENT CENTER AT UNIVERSITY OF PARIS PROGRESSES RAPIDLY
## Old Latin Quarter Replaced By New International Dormitories, Union 
### 
Work on the international student
center, which is being developed in
conjunction with the University of
Paris, is progressing rapidly, accord
ing to a communication received by
John A. Sellards from the French
Committee which has been touring
the United States enlisting American
support.
Housing Inadequate
For some time housing conditions
for students in Paris have been very
poor and the Latin Quarter, the tra
ditional rendezvous, has long been
overcrowded and is now disintegrat
ing.
To ameliorate this condition the
French government, stimulated by
the offer of M. Eniile D. de la Muertbe
of ten million francs, conceived the
idea of constructing a center capable
of supporting a population of over
three thousand. The plan consists of
a separate dormitory for students of
each nationality, with a Union as a
nucleus. This building will hold gym
nasiums, auditoriums, reading rooms,
and other recreational facilities.
Some Work Completed
Already a French, a Canadian, and
a Belgian dormitory have been built
and occupied. The Argentine building
is well under way and the corner
stones of the Japanese and English
halls have been laid. Homer Gage
of Massachusetts, Chairman of the
American Committee, reports that a
total of four hundred thousand dol
lars will be needed for the American
dormitory. One hundred fifty thou
sand dollars of that amount has al
ready been pledged.
The French committee which toured
the United States was headed by Sen
ator Andre Honnorat, former Minis
ter of Public Instruction. This com
mittee visited Stanford last Decem
ber and inspected Branner and Toyon
Halls, the Union, and Encina Com
mons. According to Sellards, the men
were very favorably impressed with
the Stanford campus.
