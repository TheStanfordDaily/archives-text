# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The announcement last month that
Michigan would have two football
teams in the field during the 1928
football season, both representative
varsity elevens with one team play
ing at home and the other away
from home, each contesting eight
games, recalled the fact that it was
Dr. Clarence Cook Little, the Presi
dent of the University of Michigan,
who first suggested the plan a year
before.
Now President Little is the antithe
sis of the average conception of what
a college president looks like and acts
like. It must have been quite a shock
to many undergraduates at Michigan
when they learned, upon the appoint
ment of their new president a few
years ago, that he was once a famous
intercollegiate shotput champion. Dr.
Little is also a good mixer who makes
friends easily and keeps them, a gen
uinely simple, unaffected good fel

low whose hobby is biology and
I whose ideas on athletics actually
' heartened the followers of football
who were so used to the jibes hurled
j at their favorite sport by so many
| academicians.
Dr. Little stands well over six feet,
i has a very pleasant manner, is as
; human as they make 'em, and be
lieves that a college education should
| fit the needs of the students, not the
I successful mfddle-aged person. When
| "Pete" Little won the 1.C.4A. shot-put
I title in 1909, he dethroned W. F.
j Kreuger of Swarthmore, the winner
in 1907 and 1908. It appears that he
is going to dethrone a lot of old-fash
ioned ideas on education and athletics
too.
