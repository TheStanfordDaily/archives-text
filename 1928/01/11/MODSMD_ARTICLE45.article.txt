CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 9. —
(U.P.) —College was a grim, serious
place for the modern co-ed's pre
revolutionary prototype, documents
recently unearthed here indicate.
Rules of conduct for "young ladies
of Alt. Holyoke in the year 1784" have
been brought to light from the Har
vard University archives.
Young ladies were allowed to asso
ciate with no "gentlemen acquain
tances" unless they were "returned
missionaries or agents of benevolent
societies."
Unless prevented by "a freshet,
earthquake, or some other calamity,"
each young lady student was expected
to walk at least a mile every day.
Other rules are:
"No young lady shall become a
member of Mt. Holyoke seminary
who cannot kindle a fire, wash pota
toes, repeat the multiplication table
and at least two-thirds of the shorter
catechism.
"No young lady shall devote more
than one hour a day to miscellaneous
reading. The Atlantic Monthly,
Shakespeare, Scott's works, Robinson
Crusoe, and other immoral works are
strictly prohibited. The Boston Rec
ord, Missionary Herald, Doddridge's
Rise and Progress, and Washington's
Farewell Address are recommended
for light reading."
