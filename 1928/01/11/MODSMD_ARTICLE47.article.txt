# RICHARD M. NEUSTADT MAKES TALK BEFORE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
## 
### 
"We are slaves to advertising," de* i
; clared Richard M. Neustadt, Vice- i
: President and Managing Director of
i the Retail Merchants Association of
| San Francisco, in a lecture, "Organiza
tion by Functions to Meet Modern
; Competition," given yesterday after- i
noon before the Graduate School of
Business.
"Advertising has taken the initia- i
tive away from the retailer, forcing
him to stock up on a certain brand :
because the public demands it, he j
stated. Neustadt then gave an exam
ple of a nationally advertised product,
selling for twice as much as an un-'
advertised article of identical quality,,
and another of a famous disinfectant
| which cost two cents a bottle to pro
duce, and sold for fifty cents,
j Manufacturers try to dictate to the
I retailers, he said, by telling them
; what products they shall sell, at what
price, and the retailers have retaliated
! by forming large department stores,
I chain stores, and attempting to die-,
tate to the manufacturers. "It is the
fight of the twentieth century," he j
1 said. "The answer to it, I do not
know."
"The chain store is the natural evo- j
lution of a man running one store

I fairly well, and expanding into more
I stores, instead of adding more de
partments. To meet the combination
of the chain stores, other stores have
affiliated and combined their buying
power. All kinds of stores have added
I new lines.

"Drug stores sell everything, and
all stores sell drugs. This criss-cross
ing in sales is almost a swingback to
the old type of general store, and is a
very vital factor in competition." He j
pictured in the near future a chain of ,
department stores, of one hundred
units, doing a business of one billion
dollars a year, at lower prices, and
with greater profit than present
stores.
This lecture was the first of a

chandising" to be given by the Gradu
ate School of Business on Tuesday j
