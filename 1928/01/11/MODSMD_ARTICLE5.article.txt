# REGISTRAR REQUESTS PETITIONS FOR FINAL CHANGE OF COURSES
## 
### 
Students wishing to take less than
the minimum number of units, and
more than the maximum number, are
warned that Friday is the last day to
file petitions with the registrar to
take such special programs.
The same day is also the final time
for those who must file change of
study lists. According to Karl M.
Cowdery, Assistant Registrar, many
students see only the instructors
when changing their programs and
fail to file a notice with the registrar.
He wishes to stress the importance
of completing the last half of the
procedure.
