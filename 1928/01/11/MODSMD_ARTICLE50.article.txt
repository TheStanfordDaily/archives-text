# HELEN FERGUSON GIVES UP MOVIES FOR STAGE WELL-KNOWN SCREEN STAR NOW PLAYING IN S.F. ACTRESS TELLS REQUIREMENTS OF NEW WORK
## 
### Ben Maddox, Jr 
One of the best things about this job
of reporting for the Daily is the oppor- ,
tunity one has of meeting celebrities.
Naturally one cannot intrude upon the
' prominent merely to satisfy a rampant
I curiosity. We must ask the great one's ,
j opinion of companionate marriage, what
breakfast food he or she favors, and!
other questions of a vital and burning l
nature.
Today we'll meet a young lady who'
j answers the Stanford man's prayer. The!
j kind that you'd like to date for the'
Junior Prom. The type that would spoil
the evening for all the other fellows and
set the "500" to raging anew over the
import situation.
Is Young and Prett£
She is young, extremely pretty. Her |
j name is Helen Ferguson, and you've noj
doubt seen her a good many times in 1
the movies. Just now she is starring in
the stage play "New Brooms" at the Al-!
cazar in San Francisco.
Now when a stage lady goes Holly
wood it's nothing out of the course of j
human events. But when a moving pic-1
ture star voluntarily gives up a screen
career to make a name for herself in the j
speakies—it causes as big a thrill in a
newspaper man's heart as did the man j
j when he reversed the age-old custom and j
j bit the dog.
Miss Ferguson is a rare person. She'
J does not talk about her Art or her Duty :
j to Her Public. She failed to mention
j Judge I.indsey and absolutely neglected
; to comment on her fan mail. These are !
things the average Hollywoodess—if I|
' may coin a word—never leaves out of an '
| interview.
"I played my first stage role a year [
ago," she told me. "I had the lead in'
'Alias the Deacon' which opened the new
| Hollywood Playhouse."
Mr. Duffy, who owns a whole chain'
of theatres up and down the coast, evi- !
dently thought a five months' run in Hoi-j
j lywood for the 'Deacon spoke volumes
| for the 'beginner.' Miss Ferguson went,
'back to the movies for the summer, but
j came August and an urgent request that
j she return to the stage. She has been
j playing in the Henry Duffy theatres ever
i since—in San Francisco, Portland, and
Seattle. j

I "They put me in stock for six weeks.
It was good training, but 1 was certainly
, glad to finish that engagement!
"The stage demands not only that you
look a part but that you speak and move
like the character you are portraying. In
| the movies one has only to keep his looks
[ and do what the director says. Of course,
I I can't have a home if 1 stay with the
J stage. That's the only drawback."
Miss Ferguson lives in an apartment
! three or four blocks from the theatre, but
| she gets plenty of exercise changing cos
' tumes for her role in "New Brooms."
; On New Year's Day, when three com
! plete shows were given, she had fifteen
' changes.
To be strictly truthful, we discussed
the Card-Pitt game for the first half of
the hour we met. Miss Ferguson's hus
band is Bill Russell, well-known screen
athlete, and he had written her all about
i the Pasadena game. This was the first
; New Year's game she has missed, her en-
I gagement at the Alcazar keeping her in
the city.
Her mother is "keeping house" for her
' during the run of this play. One can
always judge the daughter by the mater,
'they say. It took only a few minutes
! conversation with Mrs. Ferguson to real
j ize why this particular daughter was so
I charming.
; Only one screen star has turned to the
stage and made a notable success —Paul-
\ ine Frederick. Keep your eye on Helen
Ferguson because I think you'll see an
j other great actress emerge from studio
land.
I She has all the essentials for a great
! stage career —youth, looks, personality,
! and ambition. Henry Duffy says she has
[ the necessary ability and lie is going to
give her every opportunity he can. She
1 lias played in three plays for him—"Alias
the Deacon," "the Alarm Clock," and
now "New Brooms."
As I was leaving she called after me,
"Tell those five hundred girls down at
Stanford they have a lucky 'break.' I
. wish I were one of them."
And don't we wish she was one of 'em,
I too!
