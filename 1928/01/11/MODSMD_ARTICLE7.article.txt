Much Work on Subject
The Stanford debaters have been
working for more than a month on
the world peace question and they
have brought together a number of
interesting, and in many cases
thought-provoking facts on both sides
of the question. "This question has
proved to be the most interesting
subject the men of the squad have
studied since the Oxford debate," de
clared Professor Emerson, debate
coach, yesterday.
On the negative team George Bodle,
a sophomore, will he heard in his
first varsity debate. He was on the
freshman team last year. Bodle is a
good speaker of the informal type.
He is able to sense a situation and
he meets it easily. Philip Cavalero, a
senior, and second member of the
negative, in contrast is a forceful
speaker and is possibly the outstand
ing speaker of the Stanford squad.
He possesses a good voice and is
careful in his presentation of ma
terial. Cavalero participated in the
California debate last quarter and also
in his junior year. He was a freshman
debater and has taken part in sev
eral squad debates.
