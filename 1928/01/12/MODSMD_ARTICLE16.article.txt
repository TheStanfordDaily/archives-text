# VARSITY GOLFERS TO PLAY IN DEL MONTE COAST TOURNAMENT
## 
### Bob Speers 
Twenty-five Stanford golfers will
leave the campus tomorrow for Del
Monte to compete in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Golf Tournament
which will take place there January
14, 15, and 16.
Eddie Meyberg, who won the title
in last year's meet, seems to have a
good chance to repeat this week-end,
but it will be no simple feat, since
competition will be keen from mem
bers of his own team and golfers from
rival schools.
Stanford's outfit seems likely to
make a strong bid for first rank in
team ratings. Last year the Cardinals
won with only nine entrants in the
field. This year, with twenty-five play
ers, including an exceptional bunch of
freshmen,- Stanford should, putting it
mildly, stand high.
Other schools, however, will make
competition uncomfortably keen. The
University of California at Los An
geles, for instance, will send a team
of thirteen men who have been prac
ticing regularly for several months.
Captain Knox and Gibson Dunlap, of
the Bruin mashie wielders, promise to
be strong contenders for individual
honors.
