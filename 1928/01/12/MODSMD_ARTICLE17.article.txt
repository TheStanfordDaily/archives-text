# CHARCOAL PORTRAITS BY VAN VALKENBURGH SHOWN IN EXHIBITION
## 
### 
In the vigorous personality of our
modern intellectuals, Peter Van Val
kenburgh, whose portraits are now on
exhibition at the Stanford Art Gal
lery, finds subjects to his liking. Dur
ing the past year he has drawn por
traits of leading scientists of the
University of California. It is his hope
to occupy his time hereafter with this
type of work.
Van Valkenburgli works in char
coal fixed on white paper. This artist
studied the head and figure under
Vanderpoel at the Art Institute of
Chicago and Francis Smith of the
Smith Academy, Chicago. A sugges
tion from Carl Beuhr led him to a
study of the working methods of the
early masters of portraiture, and he
became deeply interested in their use
of the careful drawings from life,
crayon on white paper, which pro
ceeded, and served a data for, the por
trait to be painted. These drawings,
of which the Holbein heads are the
finest examples, Van Valkenburgh
chooses as a type well adapted to
modern needs.
