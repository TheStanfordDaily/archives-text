# CHANGE NUMBERING OF HOUSES, STREET NAMES ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
A list of the new fraternity and
sorority house addresses will be
1 found on page three.
Changes in campus street names
i and numbers become effective this
morning, according to word received
I from the Comptroller's office which
has mailed official notices of the
| changes to three unit numbers and
! three campus streets will be renamed.
I The changes come as a result of the
University's desire to establish a plan
whereby the campus may be system
atically extended to cover other addi
j tions which may be made in the fu
i ture. Feeling that it would be unfair
ito require the houses to buy new
numbers, the University will purchase
and install neat bronze number plates
: which are now being manufactured.
New street signs are also being
made and will be installed in a few
days 011 the streets bearing altered
names.
1 Under the new plan, Lasuen street
will end on the Row where it forms
a junction with Mayfleld avenue, as
J the street continuing from that point
is to be known. Coronado avenue will
i extend from Reservoir Drive to Hie
east line of Coronado avenue. Cabrillo
avenue, which formerly circled the
hill, will be known as Santa Ynez
i street which extends from Alvarado
Row to Cabrillo avenue, and thence
around the hill to Gerona Road.
