# COACH WOLTER GIVES FRESHMAN BASEBALL MEN STIFF WORKOUT
## 
### 
Although the finishing touches on
the new freshman diamond will not
he completed until tomorrow, Coach
Harry Wolter managed to sandwich
the yearlings in between the various
varsity combinations and so give
them a fairly stiff workout last night.
It is still too early in the season
to buckle down to the old leather and
while most of the time is spent in
merely renewing acquaintance with
the ball, Wolter spent a considerable
portion of the practice in trying vari
ous infield combinations witli stellar
results. Every man is a veteran of
several year's prep school experience
and most of them show up well even
with only a few days' practice. Coach
Wolter is confident that he can work
up an airtight infield out of the pres
ent material.
Catcher's position will he one big
free-for-all. There are six or seven
good men all fighting for the position
and at present they all rate fairly
even. Little is known yet about the
pitchers. There is an abundance of
material on hand but whether any
of these are real hurlers or not is
still to be determined.
It is expected that the squad will
buckle down to real work tonight
when it can get on its own diamond.
There is still a month's time to whip
the outfit into a real fighting aggrega
tion before the first game which
comes February 11.
