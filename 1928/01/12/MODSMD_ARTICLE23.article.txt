El Toro 15, Japanese Club 6.
With both teams playing loose bas
ketball, the Indians defeated Encina
5E 14 to G in the first of the evening's
intramural games. From the begin
ning the contest was a dribbling bat
tle, neither faction being able to
score with much consistency. Both
outfits displayed nice passing and
floorwork, but the superior ability of
the Indians in the gentle art of hit
ting the hoop decided the game. Ray,
for the winners, was the outstanding
player with eight points to his credit.
Performing with a brand of ball
which should carry them far in intra
mural games, Encina 3W's basketeers
swamped the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
five 21 to 2. There Avas no question as
to the outcome at any stage of the
game. The freshmen were simply too
accurate for their opponents who suc
ceeded in working the ball within
scoring distance often, but lacked the
necessary basket-shooting eye.
Two fast, well-matched teams
wound up the evening's program. Se
quoia I outpointed the Cardinal Thir
ties 20 to 18 in an overtime contest
which was far from the usual loosely
played intramural game. Banks and
Cook starred for the winners, the for
mer being responsible for the decid
ing two points. Garibotto and Lowe
were the outstanding Cardinal per
formers, each accounting for four
points.
