I he action of the Executive Committee in changing the annual mud
fight to a class tie-up comes in the way of an innovation only to this college
generation. Several years ago the mud-fight was introduced to supplant
hazing which Tom Irwin, regarded in song and fable as one of Stanford's
big reform artists, held had come upon evil days. Last fall's mud-fight,
too, was a sorry exhibition, as the Daily pointed out on October 10:
"Some men were completely stripped during the course of the fighting.
. . . 1 hough almost three-quarters of an hour late in starting, the fight
dragged on indefinitely. . . . Violations of the 'rules' for the affair were as
common as burrs in the Lagunita lake bottom."
Each year the mud-fight has been losing in popularity due to the diffi
culties of securing good supervision. Now to dodge these difficulties comes
a reversion to a fight which was once deemed unsatisfactory. The present
sketchy idea of what will be the "rules" of the tie-ups seems to us as being
easier of enforcement than do those of the mud-fight. We agree with those
who hold that there should be some sort of a class contest but as yet it is
too early to say whether the change back to the tie-up will prove satis
factory.
