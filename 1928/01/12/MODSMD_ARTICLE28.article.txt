# "Your Serve!"

Tennis is once more on the scene. In the first important ranking match
of the season Alan Herrington yesterday defeated Ralph McElvenny
before a small handful of tennis enthusiasts. Stanford's tennis material
this year is, taken man for man, superior to that possessed by any college
in the country. Three varsity players were ranked in the first ten collegiate
players by the American Lawn Tennis Association at the conclusion of last
summer's play. No other college placed more than one man on the list.
And, by one of those paradoxes which sport continually furnishes, both
Herrington and McElvenny, ranked nationally fifth and eighth respec
tively, are both wary of a freshman playerâ€”Johnny Doeg, an alternate for
the United States Davis Cup team. Coach Hal Davis, one thus sees, has
an array of players of which any mentor might well be proud. For those
who like to see exhibitions of good tennis, we recommend visiting the
courts during one of the ranking varsity matches.
