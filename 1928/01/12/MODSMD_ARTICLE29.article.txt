# "The Old Order-"
## 
### 
Officially every fraternity, sorority, and private house on the campus
today acquires a new street number in accordance with a new street num
bering plan drawn up recently by A1 Roth, Comptroller of the University.
This will permit extension in a systematic manner which may occur as a
result of future additions. "Accordingly," to quote A1 Roth, "neat bronze
numbers will be purchased and installed at the University's expense."
There will be confusion, fellow students, but. to quote A1 Roth again,
"The University regrets any inconvenience which may be caused by these
changes." Thus changeth the old street order.
