"Fraternities must co-operate and I
turn violators of rushing rules in to |
the interfraternity board of control," I
said Fred E. Richman when he pre- j
sented the newly drafted rules govern- j
ing infractions of rushing agreements j
to the members of the interfraternity
council at a meeting held in the Union
last night.
The committee headed by Richman
drafted rules defining offenses and
setting penalties for each. The rules
will be voted on at house meetings
and at its next meeting the council
will vote on final adoption of them.
When the rules are accepted and
put into effect all violations will be j
reported in writing to Professor Wil-j
