Tn that mysterious way by which various items come to our attention,
the following gem found its way into our mail. For the benefit of those
who may be deceived by the opening words, this letter, we understand, was
submitted for an English theme.
Dear Ma and pa,
Guess what. Your pride and joy lias been out in the social whirl. The
other day I found some announcements in my P.O. box, four of them, beauti
fully engraved. They were from sororities, Ma, saying that they would be at
home Ibis afternoon. Gee, ma, they must ko out an awful lot to have to send
out announcements when they are going to be at home. Maybe it is because
they all live near fraternity houses. I've heard that proximity is conducive
to familiarity. Do you suppose that is so, pa?
I guess the Kirls knew I was coming because they were right there to
meet me at the door and all dressed up. I think, though that some of them
used up till thcii material in their skirts because they didn't have sleeves and
not much back either, but they wore shawls to cover this defect. They kept
slipping off one shoulder, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to
embarrass them.
They took me in the dining room and asked if I wanted tea or coffee.
I didn't want to seem partial so I said, a little of each. I guess they ran out
of coffee because I only got tea, but I didn't mention it.
It was really awfully nice Ma, with paling and flowers all around. I know
they liked me because they sat ami listened to everything I said, and thought
I had some awfully good ideas on things. I was enjoying myself a lot when
they said I'd better ko to some of the other houses because they couldn't bo
selfish and keep me all afternoon. I think that was real thoughtful, don't
you Ma? I'm going to some other houses next Sunday and when I decide
which one I want to live in I'll write and tell you about it.
Your dutiful but loving daughter,
Myrtle.
P.S.: The bed socks are just the thing. It is so cold at night.

of coffee because I only got tea, but I didn't mention it.
It was really awfully nice Ma, with paling and flowers all around. I know
they liked me because they sat ami listened to everything I said, and thought
I had some awfully good ideas on things. I was enjoying myself a lot when
they said I'd better ko to some of the other houses because they couldn't bo
selfish and keep me all afternoon. I think that was real thoughtful, don't
you Ma? I'm going to some other houses next Sunday and when I decide
which one I want to live in I'll write and tell you about it.
Your dutiful but loving daughter,
Myrtle.
P.S.: The bed socks are just the thing. It is so cold at night.
