LURIE THEATRE—LioneI Bnrrymore
in "Laugh Clown Laugh!"
Sun Francisco's first view of the
eldest of the royal stage family of
Barrymores is superbly satisfying. He
appears in an adapted Italian tragedy
based on the old, old theme of the
clown with a broken heart.* In the
handling of the theme, however, the
author, P'austo Martin, has hidden
well any suspicion of triteness and
has produced a drama of extraordi
nary charm and power.
Flilc, a clown, is afflicted with an
enternal desire to weep; Luigi, a rich
young wastrel, who has had too much
from life, has a nervous laugh which
breaks out under most irritating cir
cumstances, as, for instance, at his
aunt's funeral. The prescribed cure
for them both is Simonetta, Flik's
charming ward. Unbeknownst to him
self he has fallen in love with her,
and Luigi promptly follows suit. There
is the inevitable struggle between the
call of youth and wealth and the call
of the benevolent and broken-hearted
Flik, with the jealous strife between
the two men. The clown eventually
hides his grief in the necessary

i laughter.
Barrymore, as the grotesque clown,
| gives one of the finest emotional per
formances San Francisco lias seen in
recent years, lie is never bitter, never
loses his audience's sympathy; his
tears are restrained but infinitely
pathetic; his final laughter is tragic
j ally sincere. Throughout lie handles
i himself with magnificent ease and re
j straint.
There exists also the anomaly of a
j good supporting cast. Luigi, played
; by Edward Leiter, who appeared with
Ruth Chatterton early in the season,
j gives a splendid portrayal of the
' young wastrel. The dynamic climax
in the second act, wherein Flik be
lieves Luigi to be making impure love
ito Simonetta, is a masterpiece of
melodramatic emotion. And the sud
den return of the clown to grotesque
i caricature when he realizes his mis-
J take is terrible in poignancy.
Lolita Lee, although evidently
j young in years, gives a beautiful and
polished performance as Simonetta,
: the star at the "Paradiso" Music Hall.
: ITer voice is quite sufficient as a moti
vating force for the tragedy of the
| piece. —Robert R. Sears.

LURIE THEATRE—LioneI Bnrrymore
in "Laugh Clown Laugh!"
Sun Francisco's first view of the
eldest of the royal stage family of
Barrymores is superbly satisfying. He
appears in an adapted Italian tragedy
based on the old, old theme of the
clown with a broken heart.* In the
handling of the theme, however, the
author, P'austo Martin, has hidden
well any suspicion of triteness and
has produced a drama of extraordi
nary charm and power.
Flilc, a clown, is afflicted with an
enternal desire to weep; Luigi, a rich
young wastrel, who has had too much
from life, has a nervous laugh which
breaks out under most irritating cir
cumstances, as, for instance, at his
aunt's funeral. The prescribed cure
for them both is Simonetta, Flik's
charming ward. Unbeknownst to him
self he has fallen in love with her,
and Luigi promptly follows suit. There
is the inevitable struggle between the
call of youth and wealth and the call
of the benevolent and broken-hearted
Flik, with the jealous strife between
the two men. The clown eventually
hides his grief in the necessary

i laughter.
Barrymore, as the grotesque clown,
| gives one of the finest emotional per
formances San Francisco lias seen in
recent years, lie is never bitter, never
loses his audience's sympathy; his
tears are restrained but infinitely
pathetic; his final laughter is tragic
j ally sincere. Throughout lie handles
i himself with magnificent ease and re
j straint.
There exists also the anomaly of a
j good supporting cast. Luigi, played
; by Edward Leiter, who appeared with
Ruth Chatterton early in the season,
j gives a splendid portrayal of the
' young wastrel. The dynamic climax
in the second act, wherein Flik be
lieves Luigi to be making impure love
ito Simonetta, is a masterpiece of
