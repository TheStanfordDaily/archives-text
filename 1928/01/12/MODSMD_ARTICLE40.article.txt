# SCHOLASTIC FIGURES SHOW IMPROVEMENT OVER FALL OF 1926
## Flunk-Out Number Is Greater For Fraternity Than For Hall Men 
### 
Improvement in scholarship during
last quarter over the fall quarter a
year ago is shown by figures released
from the Registrar's office evidencing
that only 2 per cent of the registered
students were disqualified, a propor
tion representing a reduction of .53
per cent from the corresponding fig
ures in 192 G. Based on the 1927 fall
registration of 3412 the reduction
amounts to seventeen fewer "flunk
outs" than last year.
Among the men students of the
first quarter freshmen, 2.7 per cent
were dropped on account of low schol
arship records, while only .8 per cent
of the first quarter transfer students
were disqualified. Similar action was
taken in the cases of only .3 per cent
of the graduates.
In proportion to the non-fraternity
list of "flunk-outs" the fraternity
group disqualified is nearly five times
larger. Of the fraternity men 5.9 per
cent were disqualified as compared
with the 1.2 per cent of unsuccessful
non-fraternity men.
Of the two women disqualified one
was a sorority member and the other
a non-sorority woman. Neither of
these women entered Stanford on the
competitive lists.
