# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The fact that the American League
defeated the National League in four
straight games in the last world se
ries may or may not have had any
thing to do with the fact that three
new managers were appointed in the
older circuit for 1928 while there was
only one change in the victorious
league. So, while Roger Peckinpaugh
is the only new face among the A. L.
bosses, Bill McKechnie, Burt Shotten,
and Jack Slattery have appeared
among the ranks of new managers in
the John Heydler group.
Of course, Bill McKechnie is not
new as a manager. He successfully
managed the Pirates into the 1925
world's championship, and last year
acted as coach and assistant to Man
ager O'Farrell of the Cardinals, whom
he will now manage in turn.
The appointment of Burt Shotton
as manager of the Phillies was quite
a surprise, mainly because it neces
sitated the retirement of "Stuffy" Mc-
Innis. Shotton was formerly an out
fielder with the Browns and Wash
ington, and later the "Sunday man
ager" of the Cardinals under Branch
Rickey. Then he made quite a name
for himself as boss of the Syracuse
team of the International League,
which finished a close second to Buf
falo in 1927.
Mr. Jack Slattery's job in Boston
looks pretty hard. He comes to a sev
enth-place club that needs a lot of
help, and he has had nothing to do
with professional baseball for a long
time. Jack has lived in Boston nearly
all his life, and coached the leading

college teams of Massachusetts —Hai*-
; vard, Tufts, and Boston College—and
| thinks, eats, and sleeps baseball. A
former major league catcher, he spe
cialises on good pitching, and it will
, be no surprise to see the Braves show
! a decided improvement in that depart
! ment in 1928.
