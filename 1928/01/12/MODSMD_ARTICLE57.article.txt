# WOMEN'S ELIGIBILITY TO PLAY BASKETBALL EXPLAINED BY COACH
## 
### 
"Any graduate woman is eligible to
play basketball if the proposed gradu
ate team is organized," stated Miss
! Helen Masters Bunting, head coach,
i yesterday. "If enough graduates do
not sign up, however, they will play
on the senior squad, and only those
who have not had one year of gradu
ate competition will be eligible. The
, W.A.A. ruling provides only for one
i year of competition after graduation."
Because holdovers will be eligible
! either to the senior or to the graduate
team, Miss Bunting requests that all
graduate women intending to play
; basketball sign up this afternoon.
They are to report for practice at 4:05
o'clock.
