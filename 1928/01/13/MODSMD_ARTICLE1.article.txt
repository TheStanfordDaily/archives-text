El Tigre and Sigma Nu last night
played the most thrilling game thus far
in the intramural tournament, winning 21
to 20 in the third extra period. It was
a neck and neck affair from the start of
the second half. Garibotto put the game
on ice for El Tigre when he shot a free
throw in the lasi minute of play. Long
shots featured the close of the contest
with each team trying desperately for a
score.
Tight defense was too much for the
Los Arcos quintet who suffered an 8 to 3
defeat at the hands of the Fijis. The
clubmen seldom pierced the Fiji guard to
get near the basket. Hunter, Row guard,
scored a goal for his team by batting the
ball through the hoop from the toss-up.

for the fraternity men.
