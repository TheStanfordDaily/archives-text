# TEXAS CITY TAKES DEMOCRATS' MEET FROM COOL RIVALS
## DECIDE ON FIFTH BALLOT Lone Efforts of Six-Foot Orator Causes Defeat Of San Francisco 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12— A strap
ping six-footer from Texas by the
name of Jones —Big-Hearted Jesse
Jones —persuaded the Democratic Na
tional Committee today to hold its na
tional convention at Houston, Texas,
June 26.
San Francisco fought heroically but
lost on the fifth ballot, 58 to 54. De
troit, Cleveland, Chicago, and Miami
were eliminated on earlier ballots.
This action —and it is some action
when the enticements of San Fran
cisco are passed up for Texas in June
—was due to the single-handed nerve
which had made Big-Hearted Jesse
Jones, the rich man of Houston, the
angel of many banks and investment
companies, the financier of building
projects in Houston, Fort Worth, and
many other cities.
San Francisco offered climate, a
large hall, and $250,000 in cash.
Detroit offered climate, a hall of
17,000 capacity, and $125,000 cash.
Miami, Fla., offered a hall for 15,000
and $100,000 cash.
Chicago offered a large hall and
$130,000 cash.
Cleveland offered $150,000 and the
best hall in the country.
Jesse Jones, acting alone without
backing from his state in advance,
suddenly made an offer today of $200,-
000 but offered a hall seating only
C5OO, and Texas wet',trier in June.
The explanation? It's Big-Hearted
Jesse Jones.
He had an idea. It appealed to the
pride of the South, already somewhat
resentful in places over the strength
of Smith, so instantly when Jones
opened his arms and invited the party
to go to Texas, the South forgot
weather, San Francisco's larger purse,
the possibility of influencing a doubt
ful state by taking the convention
there, and voted for Houston .
