# Today Marks Deadline For Junior Opera Plot Contest, Says Boomer
## 
### 
Today is the (leadline for synopses
for the Junior Opera, to be given
j spring quarter. All students still work
| ing on their plots, or going over them,
j are urged to hand in as complete a
j summary as possible since manu
| scripts will not be accepted after
! today, Hal Boomer announced yes
j terday.
First acts will be called for with a
{deadline of January 31 from students
I submitting manuscripts, so the oppor
tunity for more complete work will be
j given the authors of summaries sub
mitted at this time. The Junior Opera
i Committee is chiefly interested in
: getting as complete conception of
, the ideas and plots available for this
' year's Opera as possible, and so a
| variety of plots are desired.
The summaries should be typed if
possible, and given to Hal Boomer,
chairman of the Junior Opera Commit
j tee, at the Alpha Tau Omega house.
■ The name of the author should be on
the manuscript itself. Although it is
! not a requisite, a tentative sketch of
i the cast and scenes of the play may
i accompany the plot.
Since the discontinuance of the
Ram's Head annual burlesque, the
Junior Opera is the only dramatic
production on the campus wholly in
the hands • of the students. This not
! only provides an opportunity for stu
| dents with playwriting ambitions, but
gives a chance for satire and bur
lesque on subjects of campus interest.
The author or authors of the win
ning opera book this year will be
' rewarded with a cash prize, as in past
j years, although the exact amount has
| not yet been decided upon. All stu
dents in the University are eligible
! to compete.
