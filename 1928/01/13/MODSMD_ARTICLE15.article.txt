## 
### 
Tom Pike, president of Encina Club,
! and Clark Cypher, head sponsor of
; Encina Hall, issued warnings at a
meeting Wednesday night in Encina
Lobby against bringing any liquor to
the Encina Formal tonight. Cypher
| cited the Men's Council ruling against
i liquor at campus dances, and stated
j that the success of the class of 1931
j and the liberties allowed it depend
i largely upon its conduct at its annual
j formal.
I Plans for the formal have been vir
i tually completed, according to Fred
| Scripps, chairman of the dance com
! mittee. He announced, however, at
j the meeting, that in order to complete
! the decorating of the lobby before
j tonight many more men will have to
I turn out to assist today.
Jack Swayie's Berkeley orchestra
j has been obtained for the event. An
intricate system of lighting, which is
j to be used at the Automobile Show
!in San Francisco this season, is a
j feature of the decorations, adding
! color to the dark drapes that cover
(he walls. The programs are of tan
snakeskin with the Stanford Seal on
them.
