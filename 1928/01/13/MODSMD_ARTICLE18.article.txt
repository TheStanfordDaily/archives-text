# TOO MANY COLLEGE PEOPLE IN AMERICA DECLARES MENCKEN

ITHACA, N.Y. — (By Cornell Daily
Sun and Intercollegiate Press) —"I
am thoroughly convinced," H. L.
Mencken told a representative of the
Cornell Daily Sun, "that too many
young Americans are now going to
college and that their presence is
greatly impeding the work of the col
leges. Certainly it should be possible
to devise some scheme to weed out
the unfit."
Mencken is essentially opposed to
the college for purposes of intellectual
education. With Nathan he holds that
its greatest benefits are social. He
did not go to college himself though
he was an excellent scholar, obtain
ing high averages in almost every
subject. He is particularly interested
in medicine and chemistry and was
graduated with honors from the Balti
more Polytechnic Institute in 1596.
There are many things about college
life, however, that interest Mencken.
Mr. Mencken remarked, "The military
training idea seems to me absurd. I
3ee no reason why the college student
should be conscripted and not the
young man outside."
Another aspect of colleges that in- !
terests Mr. Mencken is the discrepan-;
cies used between the organization 1
policies in this country and those
abroad. He seems to believe that, for j
Americans, the present system of or
ganized classes and lectures and reci
tations is better than the tutorial
system used abroad.
"The American system, it seems to !
me," he says, "is better for Americans
than the Oxford system. It is obvious

ly more in accord with the habits of
mind of our people."
Although he declares his familiarity
with college life to be slight, he says,
"Certainly the attendance of graduate ,
students at classes ought to ha op- !
tional. But I am in some doubt about
undergraduates."
Mencken's comment on fraternities
is, "Regarding fraternities, I know
nothing. It is commonly alleged that
they foster snobbery. But 1 see no ;
objection to snobbery, per se; all ra
tional men are snobs in some way or '
other. That the fraternities exalt fifth
raters and overlook men of merit may
be true, but the same accusation
might be leveled at any other human
institution."
The Mercury editor advises anyone I

attempting to start in as a writer to
have another job which will pay his
expenses while he is learning. Until
recently he advocated bootlegging as
the other job, but he now thinks there
is too much competition there.
