# DR. JOHN A. ALMACK ADVISES REGULATION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS
## 
### 
That the problem of the regulation
of private schools is rapidly becoming
an acute question, and the country as
a whole soon will have to reckon with
it, was the position taken by Dr. John
C. Alinack, of the department of edu
cation, before the Kiwanis Club of
Mountain View, yesterday.
Dr. Almack declared that many pri
vate sectarian schools are on a par
Avith any of the state institutions, but
that others have no educational stand
ards whatsoever, and exist merely to
fleece the public. "Especially notori
ous is a certain class of correspon
dence schools," he said.
Professor Almack recommended
that California and other states copy
the legislation of New York in this
respect whereby every school is re
(niired to obtain a permit before oper
ating.
