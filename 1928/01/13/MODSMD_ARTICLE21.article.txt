Hunt is starting the live men that
played fast basketball in the Fresno
State game last week and he expects
them to play the same against
U.C.L.A. This combination has been
consistently improving during the
i past week's workouts, stopping of
j fensive formations of the other var
j sity teams and showing drive and
j power on the offense.
U.C.L.A. men will be up against
the fact that they are not playing oil
their home floor, and with the dis
ability of Woodroof, the entire Bruin
system of play will be thrown off.
Their biggest chances for victory lay
in the hard driving Williams and
Ketchum pair who are rated dead
shots. In both the Hollywood and Los
Angeles Athletic Club meets, these
small forwards scored better than ten
points apiece.
Cards Outweigh Bruins
The Bruins will be further handi
capped by being outweighed, and out
reached by height. Both the Stanford
I guards, Thompson and Rothert, are
big and tall and are also fast on floor

The Los Angeles Athletic Club beat
the Bruins 2(5 to 21 and defeated the
Cardinals 26 to 14. U.C.L.A. • downed
the Hollywood Athletic Club 37 to 28,
while the Hollywood team beat Stan
ford 30 to 14. In addition the Bruins
won both contests last year by scores
| of 21 to 17 and 23 to 21.
Bill Woodroof, star center and
high-point scorer for the U.C.L.A.
Bruins, will probably not see ac
tion in tonight's and tomorrow's
games as the result of a strained
heart. Last evening's edition of
the San Francisco Bulletin re
ported that Woodroof would make
the trip but would be unable to
play.
With a good practice week behind
S them, Coach Husky Hunt's varsity
' basketball players are anxiously
j awaiting the referee's whistle starting
them off tonight in the 1928 confer
ence basketball tilt against Coach
Caddy Works' Bruins. A second game
will be played tomorrow night, both
contests starting at 8 o'clock.
The probable starting line-up for
both teams tonight is as follows:
CARDS BRUINS
Berg F Ketchum
Vincenti F Williams
Smalling C Young
Rothert G Baker
Thompson G Sunseri
Hunt is starting the live men that
played fast basketball in the Fresno
State game last week and he expects
them to play the same against
U.C.L.A. This combination has been
consistently improving during the
i past week's workouts, stopping of
j fensive formations of the other var
j sity teams and showing drive and
j power on the offense.
U.C.L.A. men will be up against
the fact that they are not playing oil
their home floor, and with the dis
ability of Woodroof, the entire Bruin
system of play will be thrown off.
Their biggest chances for victory lay
in the hard driving Williams and
Ketchum pair who are rated dead
shots. In both the Hollywood and Los
Angeles Athletic Club meets, these
small forwards scored better than ten
points apiece.
Cards Outweigh Bruins
The Bruins will be further handi
capped by being outweighed, and out
reached by height. Both the Stanford
I guards, Thompson and Rothert, are
big and tall and are also fast on floor
| work.
