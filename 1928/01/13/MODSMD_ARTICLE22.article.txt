### Herb Wenig 
After presenting a forceful and in
teresting group of arguments for and
against the proposition, "Resolved,
That the results of the Great War
have tended toward the peace of the
world," the debating teams of the
University of Southern California and
Stanford, speaking in the Assembly
Hall last night stood practically even
according to a change of opinion de
cision with a vote of fifty-nine deci
sions changed in favor of the Cardinal
speakers, and fifty-seven altered by
the arguments of the Sons of Troy.
Stanford, represented by Virgil
Whitaker, John Sobieski, and Leonard
Kirkpatrick upheld the affirmative of
the peace subject, while the Southern
California debaters, Meldrim Hurrill,
Clifford Weimer, and Stanley Hopper,
defended the negative. Professor
Ralph llaswell Lutz, associate profes
sor of history, acted as chairman.

The debate showed thorough prepa
ration on both sides with the sin
cerity of the men being particularly
impressive. The Southern California
speakers had the best of the humor
and were more definite in their rebut
tal.
The Cardinal presented the argu
ments that the results of the war had
aided in setting of instruments for
the maintenance of peace, the League
of Nations, and Locarno pacts; that
boundaries had been readjusted more
nearly on racial lines; and that the
attitude of individual's conception of
war had changed from a romantic to
a realistic one.
The Trojan representatives ad
vanced the points that the war had
produced dictatorships and increased
armaments; that the old causes of
war —existance of racial antagonisms
and use of propaganda—had been en
couraged.
