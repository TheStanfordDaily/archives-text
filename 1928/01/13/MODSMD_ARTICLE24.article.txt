# Zip! Bang! Boom!— Nicaragua!

### 
Nicaragua, incomparable playground for American diplomacy, parade
ground for American marines, and leading source of live news for the
American (and perhaps foreign) press, is once again with us. Or has it
ever been away? In any case, there are a few new wrinkles, mainly: the
Navy is hot-footing a thousand additional marines to the unhappy repub
lic, Congress has become both interested and peeved over our policies
down there, and the fighting has narrowed down to the Liberals, Conser
vatives, and marines against a renegade leader, one Sandino by name.
If Senor Sandino would kindly surrender or permit himself and his
mercenary band to be annihilated by the combined forces in the field
against him, peace would probably return to the Nicaraguans. Unfortu
nately, however, the country is exceedingly rugged and in places almost
impassafle to troops, thus permitting renegade Sandino to engage in
guerrilla warfare and also to elude successfully the regulars sent against
him. He may hang on to the fight for months, or, as the American forces
are strengthened, may realize the hopelessness of his situation and sur
render. In the meantime, the United States, having made the sad error
of becoming mixed up in the affair, must stick it out and see order
re-established.
The Liberal and Conservative parties originally at odds have aban
doned the arena and under an American mediator have come to the
following terms:
(1) General peace in time for the new crop and delivery of arms of
both parties to American custody.
(2) General amnesty and return of exiles and confiscated property.
(3) Participation in the Diaz cabinet by representatives of the
Liberals.
(4) Organization of a Nicaraguan constabulary on a non-partisan
basis commanded by American officers.
(5) Supervision of elections in 1928 and succeeding years by Ameri
cans who will have ample police power to make such supervision effective.
(6) Continuance temporarily of a sufficient force of marines to make
the foregoing effective.
Once Sandino has been eliminated and these conventions have had a
chance to become effective, most of our troubles will likely be over—at
least until there is another revolution, or coup d'etat, and by that time we
may have concluded to sit by and let our cousins to the south thoroughly
enjoy a war all by themselves.
We can find some food for argument in the last three provisions, with
Americans in charge of the constabulary and elections, and American
marines on the ground "temporarily." Parties alive to the "Colossus of
the North" idea, however, may recall that American naval officers have
almost full control of the naval policies of Peru—at the request of Peru.
A somewhat similar arrangement has been designed for the military
forces of Brazil. Americans have long officered peace forces in Haiti
and the Dominican Republic. As for supervising elections, the State De
partment is an old hand at it in Cuba, for instance. Probably this inter
ference is just as good for everybody involved, at least, for a time. We
hope, however, that whoever is in charge of the American occupation,
small as it is, will have a proper and reasonable concern for United States
interests there, always remembering that Nicaragua, after all, belongs to
the Nicaraguans.
