If this editorial were an after-dinner speech, it would be perfectly
appropriate for it to herald the official entry of the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles into the Pacific Coast Conference with such words
as: "Jt is a rare privilege at this time to welcome into our ranks that
sterling institution .. . Yet somehow the ordinary felicitations don't
fit the thought that has possession of our mind.
Wc are now witnessing, incidentally to U.C.L.A.'s union with us in
athletics, the expansion of our fellow university at its new YVestwood
home into an institution which bids fair to grow as rapidly in prestige,
value, and accomplishment as it has, since its establishment not many
years ago, in size.
A great many Stanford students, coming as they do from Southern
California, are familiar with the work and progress of U.C.L.A. and are
on friendly relations with its students. Most of us respect the parent
institution, surely—that U.C. we have been meeting every year of our
history. We have in our new rival, then, a combination of favorable
factors which allows the hope that our competition may be as keen as the
Bears have ever furnished, and conducted in a gentlemanly manner
always.
Our part today is to extend a hearty welcome to the Bruin basketball
team upon its arrival here this morning. It will go into tonight's game
with every determination to start its history as a member of the Coast
Conference with a victory. Candid judgment says it has a good chance
of doing so. Stanford spirit says it hasn't. The fact that today is Friday
the Thirteenth bodes ill for one team at least.
