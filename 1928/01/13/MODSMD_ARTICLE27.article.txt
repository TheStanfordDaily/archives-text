### 
Definite announcement that the
Carnegie Institute will assist Stan
i'ord University in defraying the cost
of publication of certain papers of the
late Professor George Hempl was an
nounced yesterday. The papers will
be published by the University, ac
tual work beginning this month.
The papers of Professor Hempl, who
was Professor of Germanic Philology
at Stanford from 1906 until the time
of his death in 1021, were not entirely
complete, and Professor Frederick
Anderson of the Romanic Languages
Department has been arranging them
for publication.
The papers to be printed are en
titled as follows: "Origin of the Euro
pean Alphabet," "Inscriptions in
Crete," "Languages of Europe: Etrus
can," and three on the "Language of
the Hittites."
Professor W. H. Davis, chairman of
the Committee on University Publica
tions, said yesterday that the papers
will be published under his supervi
sion in five separate parts, the regu
lar format for the Stanford University
Series being used. The papers will be
available in volume form after the five
parts have appeared.
Because the works of Professor
Hempl were of a philological nature,
it will be necessary to have special
matrices designed for the composing
machine, according to Davis. This, it
was stated, will take time, so that the
finished edition will probably not be
off the press before the end of this
year.
