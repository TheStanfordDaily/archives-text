# STANFORD HERO iS CHOSEN FOR PETER B. KYNE NOVEL
## Writer Visits Campus With Former Santa Fe Line Chief Engineer LAUDS "FINEST COLLEGE" Novelist Advises Would-Be Authors to Write What Editors Want 
### Carroll O'Meara 
Stanford will soon break into the
realm of popular fiction —in one of
Peter B. Kyne's novels, to be exact —
according to the popular author him
self, who visited the campus yester
day with Andrew B. Schindler, former
chief engineer of the Santa Fe Rail
road.
Both men attended Dr. H. Norin
ger's lecture on "Lightning" in the
morning and in the afternoon visited
the Ryan High Voltage Laboratory
where Dr. Harris Ryan performed a
number of interesting experiments
for a group of distinguished friends.
Emulates Baum, '93
Mr. Kyne's primary interest in the
lecture and experiments was to ob
tain information for his novel (un
named as yet) in which "the hero is
going to do what Frank G. Baum, '9S,
did; that is to invent a way of trans
mitting high voltage currents over
long distances without heavy and
wasteful losses by leakage."
Mr. Kyne is a stout, well-dressed
man of average height with a win
ning personality. His presence did not
attract any special attention on the
campus for there is nothing preten
tious about him. His friends call him
"Captain."
"Finest School"
His congenial personality encour-
aged us to get liis opinion on a few
things of interest to Stanford stu
dents and professors. The first suit
able question that came to our mind
was the usual "what do you think of
Stanford?" Here is his reply: "Lots.
Stanford University has the finest
electrical school in the world. If I had
a son I'd surely send him here. It is
an institution of desirable size. It is
sufticiently endowed, has fine profes
sors, and is well governed. Your presi
dent, Dr. Wilbur, is a most capable
educator. My opinion is that there is
no better institution of learning."
"Art Is Hokum"
"Do you think that a modern writer
can achieve success by striving for
artful work?" we asked. "If he does,"
he answered, "it will be the first
stumbling block in his way to suc
cess. This 'art* stuff is all hokum. No
two men agree on what is art. The
thing that authors have to discover is
not what is art, nor even what the
public wants, but what the editors
want.
"No, I don't know what the public
wants. If I did know I'd be making
millions selecting plays for Klaw and
Erlanger of New York.
"I don't pretend to be an artist.
My purpose is to write good, clean,
decent entertainment."
3000 Words a Day
Asked what was the system he em
ployed in the process of forming a

| story, Mr. Kyne said, "I have no sys-'
tem. I construct a series of ideas in
my mind and then put them on paper.
My output is, on the average, 3000 j
words per day. Two days are required
;to complete a short story—two or
three days to turn out an installment
of a novel."

dents and professors. The first suit
able question that came to our mind
was the usual "what do you think of
Stanford?" Here is his reply: "Lots.
Stanford University has the finest
electrical school in the world. If I had
a son I'd surely send him here. It is
an institution of desirable size. It is
sufticiently endowed, has fine profes
sors, and is well governed. Your presi
dent, Dr. Wilbur, is a most capable
educator. My opinion is that there is
no better institution of learning."
"Art Is Hokum"
"Do you think that a modern writer
can achieve success by striving for
artful work?" we asked. "If he does,"
he answered, "it will be the first
stumbling block in his way to suc
cess. This 'art* stuff is all hokum. No
two men agree on what is art. The
thing that authors have to discover is
not what is art, nor even what the
public wants, but what the editors
want.
"No, I don't know what the public
wants. If I did know I'd be making
millions selecting plays for Klaw and
Erlanger of New York.
"I don't pretend to be an artist.
My purpose is to write good, clean,
decent entertainment."
3000 Words a Day
Asked what was the system he em
ployed in the process of forming a

| story, Mr. Kyne said, "I have no sys-'
tem. I construct a series of ideas in
my mind and then put them on paper.
My output is, on the average, 3000 j
words per day. Two days are required
;to complete a short story—two or
three days to turn out an installment
of a novel."
Stanford will soon break into the
realm of popular fiction —in one of
Peter B. Kyne's novels, to be exact —
according to the popular author him
self, who visited the campus yester
day with Andrew B. Schindler, former
chief engineer of the Santa Fe Rail
road.
Both men attended Dr. H. Norin
ger's lecture on "Lightning" in the
morning and in the afternoon visited
the Ryan High Voltage Laboratory
where Dr. Harris Ryan performed a
number of interesting experiments
for a group of distinguished friends.
Emulates Baum, '93
Mr. Kyne's primary interest in the
lecture and experiments was to ob
tain information for his novel (un
named as yet) in which "the hero is
going to do what Frank G. Baum, '9S,
did; that is to invent a way of trans
mitting high voltage currents over
long distances without heavy and
wasteful losses by leakage."
Mr. Kyne is a stout, well-dressed
man of average height with a win
ning personality. His presence did not
attract any special attention on the
campus for there is nothing preten
tious about him. His friends call him
"Captain."
"Finest School"
His congenial personality encour-
aged us to get liis opinion on a few
things of interest to Stanford stu
dents and professors. The first suit

was the usual "what do you think of
