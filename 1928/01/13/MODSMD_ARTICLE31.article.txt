### 
HANOVER, N.H.—(l.P.)—That the
club system should be substituted for
the national fraternity system at Dart
mouth is the belief of The Dartmouth,
undergraduate daily, which has been
carrying on a campaign for reform in
the fraternities on the Dartmouth cam
pus. Says the Dartmouth:

"We do not think that membership i
in a national fraternity is doing any
one any harm, but we do think it is
I useless and foolish. If the fraternities
i in this college were to return their
i national charters, it would make little,
jor no, actual difference to anyone.
i There would still be the house for so
| cial purposes. There would be a party
organized at Carnival for the club.
I There would be the opportunity for
friendship, which, in the end, is all
that a fraternity can provide. It is ab
i surd to presume that any organiza
tion can guarantee friendship."
