Now that 1 have been allowed to
write about what really interests me,
the first thing of course, will be my
own daily paper. I mean, I always try
to look for things in it that will help
me along with the day. And I get
along quite well with the directions
which are really quite surprising at
times. I don't know what I would feel
like if I couldn't begin my work with
a smile.
Not that writing for the paper is
work. It honestly is loads and loads
of fun. I mean one has the right to
get in on lots of things that most
people don't hear of. I mean those
that are perfectly legitimate, because
we try to keep our paper clean and
refreshing.
And I do wish that I could have
every one over to the office some
time on a party. I mean, all the re
porters are perfectly lovely people.
They are all so serious and sincere.
1 think they really give atmosphere to
our college. You know, the atmos
phere of having a purpose in life.
One of saying something worth while
at least once a day.
Our paper is wonderful in its va
riety, too. There is a lost and found
department, and then it is quite ro
mantic in the advertising of shows.
One was "The story of a musician
who lived his own song of love."
But it is so funny when some one
gets a "drag" on what has happened
the night before. I mean, I wish every
one could hear everything that comes
in, but as I said before, we try to
' make our paper a good influence.
