# CARD BASEBALL NINE ENDS FIRST WEEK OF WINTER'S TRAINING
## 
### 
Facing one of the hardest schedules
jin years, Stanford's varsity baseball
I team has completed its first week's
practice, with only a bare survey ob
tainable of the men who will probably
be on the Cardinal nine.
Graduation has left only a slight
mark on the squad, with most of its
deletions felt in the outfield. Only
Wilton is left from last year's regu
lars; Stewart and Nissen are missing.
"Spud" Harder is working out for one
of the vacancies, while of a crew of
last year's sophomores are out for the
other.
Infield Intact
The infield is not only intact, but
] greatly reinforced. With Maguire at
first, Garibaldi at second, Busch at
short, and Harder, who may go to the
outfield, at third, the Redsliirts can
look for a flashy defense around the
bases.
If Harder vacates his sack, Captain
Bill Laird of the 1930 team will make
the strongest bid for it. Story and
Churchill can give Garibaldi a run
for second, while Osthaus may send
Maguire to the bench.
Only the loss of Captain Steve Col
j lins weakens the Card battery. Sypher
! Is still working behind the plate, but
j Coach Wolters is getting little Walt
j Heinecke ready for bad times.
As to pitchers, there are "Count"

I Sobieski, regular last year, and Doug
! Lewis, a dangerous twirler, for the
full-time jobs, Ilob Philippi and Bill
Simkins for relief. "Tiny" Taylor, for
merly of Wisconsin, stands out as
varsity material, although he is in
eligible this year.
