### 
OSSINING, N.Y., Jan. 12.—( U.P.) —
Ruth Snyder and Ileniy Judd Gray
were put to death in the electric chair
early tonight. When Mrs. Snyder was
fastened in the chair she cried,
"Father forgive them, for they know
not what they do." She repeated this
three times. Then there was a pause,
and the woman who had been Mrs.
Snyder was pronounced dead at
11:07 p.m.
One minute later Gray entered the
chamber and at 11:14 was pronounced
dead. To the horror of the spectators
at 11:12 a.m. a small curl of smoke
wreathed toward the ceiling from
Gray's right temple.
Ringing down the curtain on the
most sensational criminal case since
the trial of Harry K. Thaw, the battle
to save Ruth Snyder and Henry Judd
dray from electrocution failed short
ly before 5 p.m. Justice Levy of the
supreme court rescinded the stay of
execution which he had granted Wed
nesday so that Ruth Snyder could ap
pear as witness in a suit involving
disposal of her husband's $95,000 in
surance policy.
