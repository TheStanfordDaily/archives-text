PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 12.— (U.P.)
—Spray-covered as their prows broke
through heavy, wind-swept seas, three
vessels were hurrying tonight to the
assistance of the steam freighter
Griffco and 23 members of its crew
whose fate has been made a mystery
by the long silence of their radio
operator.
After sending calls for help for
nearly an hour late Wednesday night,
the Griffco's operator suddenly stop
ped without giving his position or a
hint of the plight of his ship.
The steamer Aorangi and the coast
guard cutters Haida and Snohomish
are aiming at a scientifically desig

Flattery where they expect to find
the Griffco some time tomorrow, pro
viding the ship is still floating. The
