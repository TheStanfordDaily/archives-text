# PENNSYLVANIA GIVEN N.C.A. SWIMMING MEET; CARDS MAY COMPETE
## Brandsten Announces Dates For Meets With Bear Varsity Squads 
### 
Pennsylvania has been awarded
the National Collegiate Associa
tion swimming meet, according to
advices received here Wednes
day.
Coach Ernst Brandsten was
notified of the choice by F. W.
Leuhring, chairman of the N.C.A.
swimming committee, and is hold
ing the possibility of Stanford's
entry under consideration.
The University of Pennsylvania
pool is said to be one of the larg
est and best opened recently in
the country.
Varsity and freshman water polo
teams will fight it out with the Golden
Bears here at Encina Pool on Febru
ary 25, and the swimming teams will
have their yearly contest on March 10
in the Athens Club pool at Oakland,
announces Swimming Coach Brand
sten.
Card swimmers are limbering up
for an exhibition in the San Jose
Y.M.C.A. pool on January 29, where
they will try to break several Coast
sprint records for 60-foot swimming
tanks, now held by the University of
Oregon.
Times for "short-course" sprint rec
ords are faster than for a "long
course," due to a greater number of
turns which the swimmers make. The
100-foot Encina Pool belongs to the
latter class, but despite this fact, the
local mermen have bettered the Web
foots' records by safe margins more
than once. After their defeat last year
at the hands of the Cardinal team,
little trouble is anticipated in knock
ing off several records at San Jose.
Water polo practice is hitting a hot
pace, with the freshman guards stav
ing off a creditable number of goals
by the varsity forwards. Milton Burns,
freshman swimmer, water polo player,
and diver, whom Coach Brandsten
called the most promising breast
stroke material in school, suffered a
broken nose from polo scrimmage
this week, and will be kept out of
the water by his injury for at least a
week.
Interclass swimming is set for Feb
ruary 3.
