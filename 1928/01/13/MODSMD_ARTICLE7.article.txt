# BABE FIVE TO MEET STRONG OPPONENTS TONIGHT, SATURDAY
## Piedmont, San Jose Pick of High School Quintets In California 
### 
Stanford University's babe'quintet
faces two of the strongest high school
basketball teams of the state when
they clash with the Piedmont High
and San Jose High eagers on Friday
and Saturday nights respectively at
7 o'clock in the Stanford Pavilion as
preliminaries to the Varsity-U.C.L.A.
games.
Assistant Coach "Muggs" Mitchell
is not taking either game lightly, par
ticularly after the poor showing of
many of the first-string players
against Armstrong College Wednes
day evening. The probable starting
line-up for the first game has been an
nounced as follows: Hawkins, center;
Freeman and Joujon-Rorhe, forwards;
Reynolds and Tampeke, guards.
Mears, Moffatt, Smith, and Hepp will
also be given a chance to play. The
line-up for the second night's game
will depend solely on the showing of
the individual players against Pied
mont.
Vance Fawcett may not be allowed
to see action in either game, on ac
count of lailing to pass a recent medi
cal examination; while Bonner, a
promising center, has been definitely
dropped from the squad for the same
reason.
Mitchell has declared himself dis
satisfied with the team's playing dur
ing the past week, particularly with
that of the forwards, who have been
depending too much on the big guards
for the defensive work. If this is re
peated, he plans to make several
changes in the first-string personnel.
Both the Piedmont and San Jose
teams have been undefeated up to
this time. The Piedmont captain, Don
Bell, is considered one of the best
guards in the A.C.AJj.; while two of
his teammates, Collins and Cowing,
are also of championship calibre. The
strength of the San Jo3e team lies in
their size and speed, many of the
players being over 6 feet.
