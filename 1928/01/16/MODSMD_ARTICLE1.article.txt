HAVANA, Cuba, Jan. 15. —President
Calvin Coolidge came into Havana
this afternoon over a rose-strewn
pathway, straight into the hearts of
cheering thousands.
The warmth of the Latin welcome
■would have turned the head of a
Caesar, and must have cheered the
heart of a democratic president.
Warm Welcome
Havana burst into an acclaim such
as it has never given a visitor before,
a welcome so warm and so spontane
ous that it amazed itself. Cheers,
sirens, smiles marked the triumphal
pathway of the President, Mrs. Cool
idge, and members of the American
delegation, which includes President
and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wilbur of Le
land Stanford University of Califor
nia, to the sixth Pan-American Con
ference, as the battleship Texas came
up the beautiful Havana Bay and put
the party ashore.
Rivals U.S. Spirit
It was a welcome no United States
city could have given any president,
because to the fire of greeting was
added the spontaneity and tempera
ment of Latin hospitality. Lovely wo
men strewed roses before the presi
dential car in which President Cool
idge rode beside President Machado.
Soldiers, stiffly at attention, lined the
procession route which led through
narrow streets until it burst out upon
the wide Malacon —Havana's riverside
drive —and wound up before the pal
ace, fronted with gaily uniformed cav
alry around the palm square.
