# Set January 31 As Deadline For Opera First Acts
## 
### 
First acts will be called for by the
Junior Opera Committee from the
authors of the synopses that seem to
offer the best possibilities for pro
duction, with the deadline January
31. Announcement of the authors of
the summaries under consideration
will be made at the end of this week.
A number of manuscripts were re
ceived, and are now being worked on
by the committee, both as a group and
individually. The most suitable will
be voted on by the committee as a
whole. This method of elimination of
some of the prospective authors, or
tryoutee plan, is being followed in
order to save unnecessary labor on
opera books that are not desirable,
instead of the procedure, as in past
years, of calling for complete books.
The subject matter of the plots
varies to a great degree, but the ma
jority are modern. A few costume
plays are suggested, as well as orien
tal ones. The settings of the plays
show the greatest variation and in
clude everything from South Sea
Island beaches to Wall Street bond
exchanges.
"As a whole, the synopses we re
ceived were better than we expected.
All of them have possibilities for
clever specialty acts. Some had tech
nical difficulties in productions, such
as shipwrecks with our hero swim
ming to the shore, but ths majority
of them promise excellent possibili
ties," is the comment of Hal Boomer,
chairman of the committee.
