# ANONYMOUS JOKER CUTS LIGHT WIRES AT ENCINA FORMAL
## 
### 
There is on the campus a per
son who not only believes Friday
the thirteenth is unlucky, hut
will also go so far as to wilfully
make it an unlucky clay for four
hundred others. This proved to
he the case Friday night at the
Encina Formal when, soon after
midnight, all lights in the lobby
were completely shut off.
It was discovered that a person
besides being unable to find the
dances on his program, was also
totally at a loss as to whom he
was dancing with. No matter
how successful a dance is, it can
hardly proceed with no light on
the subject, so of necessity many
a member of Encina Club walked
out, the loser of about five
dances.
The wires were found to have
been cut some place between the
source of current in the base
ment and the lobby. No trace of
the guilty person has been dis
covered.
