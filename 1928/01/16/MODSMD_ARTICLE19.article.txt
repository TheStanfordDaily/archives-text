# CARDS WILL TAKE ON SEALS FOR SEASON'S FIRST BASEBALL TILT
## Cliff Ireland III; Can Not Bring Team Down For Traditional Game 
### Herb Wenig 
Cliff Ireland, veteran of the dia
mond, because of illness will not be
able to bring his Independents here
to play the varsity baseball nine in
the traditional first game of the sea
son. From time immemorial, the
horsehide comedian with his semi
pro team from San Francisco has,
been initiating Cardinal nines every
season.
The Kenealey Seals, another semi
pro club of the Bay city, will take
over Ireland's job this year when they
meet Stanford on January 2S, in the
Initial game of the season. The Seals
rate right alongside of the Independ
ents who defeated Stanford last year.
Among other practice games sched
uled is one with the Athens Club
team of Oakland on February 4.
Coach Harry Wolters has a wealth
of talent on the pitching staff. "Count"
Sobieski heads the list. Last season
in the California series he pitched
the longest game of the year, sixteen
innings. Bob Philippi, after some tun
ing, ought to have a good season.
Then there are Kerns and Lewis now
running about par, and Simkins who
has plenty of speed and is developing
more finish in his delivery.
At the receiving end Cook Cypher
is going strong as one of the best
cacthers seen here in some time. Pax
ton, a transfer, is doing well at this
position and will also be useful as a
pinch-hitter.
At first base, competition is present
aplenty. Maguire, a regular of 1925
is being pushed to the limit by Ost
haus who has been away from the
diamond for two years. It was Ost
haus who was the hitting sensation
of the Stanford-Pittsburgh game
when the Pirates were in training at
Stockton in 1925.
Looking over the rest of the infield
with "Pooch" Garibaldi at second, Bill
Laird and Adams out for third sack,
and Jim Busch and Tito Bianchi, '30,
competing for shortstop, it appears
that Stanford will have a very good
defensive club. The hitting depart
ment is the one that needs to be
strengthened.
