# BRUINS DEFEAT CARDINAL FIVE IN TWO DAMES
## U.C.L.A. Rally in First Tilt Nets 29 to 22 Victory Over Stanford SOUTHERNERS CLEVER New Conference Team Wins Second Contest From Varsity 28-22 
### Merle Emry 
U.C.L.A. celebrated its admission
into Pacific Coast Conference basket
hall by winning both contests of the
two-game series from Stanford. Fri
day night the Bruins took a 29 to 22
victory, and Saturday night scored
one point less, totalling 28 to the
Cardinals' 22.
Although the Stanford scores for
(he two games were the same, it was
a different looking basketball team
that started the game Saturday than
that which played the night before.
Up to within two minutes of the close
of the first half the Cardinals out
played the Bruins at the latter's own
game. With short, accurate passes,
smooth floorwork, and a fighting
spirit that could not be denied, Hunt's
men opened the scoring and main
tained the lead until the lanky Wood
roof, supposedly Injured Bruin cen
ter, started counting field shots from
the Stanford seventeen-foot line. He
made four such baskets in the period.
Half time ended with the score read
ing 16 to 14 in favor of U.C.L.A.
Bruins Rally
At the opening of the second half,
the Bruins came back and showed
their superiority. The Cardinals, tired
from the stiff pace of the first half,
wilted under the cool and fast play
ing of Woodroof and Ketchum who
eluded the Stanford forwards and got
inside the five-man zone to score.
Rothert and Thompson, Stanford
guards, played a creditable game but
; failed to get the ball off the back-
I board as quickly as they had been J
i doing in the first half. The Bruins
j scored four field goals in this period
: as compared with two baskets the
! Cardinals shot.
Eighteen Fouls Called
Both teams were playing rough and i
I fighting hard. Altogether eighteen 1
fouls were called on both sides during j
this half, ten made by U.C.L.A. men, |
and the remainder belonging to the
i Cardinals.
Richards Sent In
Hunt sent Clark in for Smalling,
j center, and Richards for Berg at for- i
j ward but the Bruin scoring machine
| kept on functioning. Previously, Hunt j
| had placed Rothert to jump at center !
j for Smalling and then to drop back
to his position as running guard. This
j aided somewhat as Rothert jumped
i higher and gave Woodroof more com
petition on tip-off plays.
Friday night the Cardinals lost an
almost cinched victory when the
j Bruins staked a come-back in the last !
! four minutes of play and took the j
! game 29 to 22.
Neck-to-Neck Race
Up to that final rally of the Bruins j
! it was a nip-and-tuck affair since the j
! start of the second half. Led by Vin-1
j centi and Berg, Stanford established j
' a three-point lead, making the score
| 19 to 16.
Three successful free throws made
I by Ketchum, Woodroof, and Sunseri
| brought the score to a 19 to 19 tie. |
i Ketchum scored a field goal which ;
I was followed by a basket for Stan- j
! ford made by Richards, who substi- !
tuted for Vincenti. From this point j
on, the Bruins forged steadily forward
and the Cardinals grew lax in their
guarding, especially of Ketchum, who
I counted for two baskets in rapid sue- '
| cession.
j The first half of the contest ended
! 14 to 13 in favor of U.C.L.A. It was ;
| featured by the one-arm shooting of !
Williams who made four baskets in j
| running directly underneath the Card- j
j inal goal, making a sun-fish turn and :
! hooking the ball in the basket over 1
| his shoulder.

U.C.L.A. celebrated its admission
into Pacific Coast Conference basket
hall by winning both contests of the
two-game series from Stanford. Fri
day night the Bruins took a 29 to 22
victory, and Saturday night scored
one point less, totalling 28 to the
Cardinals' 22.
Although the Stanford scores for
(he two games were the same, it was
a different looking basketball team
that started the game Saturday than
that which played the night before.
Up to within two minutes of the close
of the first half the Cardinals out
played the Bruins at the latter's own
game. With short, accurate passes,
smooth floorwork, and a fighting
spirit that could not be denied, Hunt's
men opened the scoring and main
tained the lead until the lanky Wood
roof, supposedly Injured Bruin cen
ter, started counting field shots from
the Stanford seventeen-foot line. He
made four such baskets in the period.
Half time ended with the score read
ing 16 to 14 in favor of U.C.L.A.
Bruins Rally
At the opening of the second half,
the Bruins came back and showed
their superiority. The Cardinals, tired
from the stiff pace of the first half,
wilted under the cool and fast play
ing of Woodroof and Ketchum who
eluded the Stanford forwards and got
inside the five-man zone to score.
Rothert and Thompson, Stanford
guards, played a creditable game but
; failed to get the ball off the back-
I board as quickly as they had been J
i doing in the first half. The Bruins
j scored four field goals in this period
: as compared with two baskets the
! Cardinals shot.
Eighteen Fouls Called
Both teams were playing rough and i
I fighting hard. Altogether eighteen 1
fouls were called on both sides during j
this half, ten made by U.C.L.A. men, |
and the remainder belonging to the
i Cardinals.
Richards Sent In
Hunt sent Clark in for Smalling,
j center, and Richards for Berg at for- i
j ward but the Bruin scoring machine
| kept on functioning. Previously, Hunt j
| had placed Rothert to jump at center !
j for Smalling and then to drop back
to his position as running guard. This
j aided somewhat as Rothert jumped
i higher and gave Woodroof more com
petition on tip-off plays.

almost cinched victory when the

(he two games were the same, it was
a different looking basketball team
that started the game Saturday than
that which played the night before.
Up to within two minutes of the close
of the first half the Cardinals out
played the Bruins at the latter's own
game. With short, accurate passes,
smooth floorwork, and a fighting
spirit that could not be denied, Hunt's
men opened the scoring and main
tained the lead until the lanky Wood
roof, supposedly Injured Bruin cen
ter, started counting field shots from
the Stanford seventeen-foot line. He
made four such baskets in the period.
Half time ended with the score read
ing 16 to 14 in favor of U.C.L.A.
Bruins Rally
At the opening of the second half,
the Bruins came back and showed
their superiority. The Cardinals, tired
from the stiff pace of the first half,
wilted under the cool and fast play
ing of Woodroof and Ketchum who
eluded the Stanford forwards and got
inside the five-man zone to score.
Rothert and Thompson, Stanford
guards, played a creditable game but
; failed to get the ball off the back-
I board as quickly as they had been J
i doing in the first half. The Bruins
j scored four field goals in this period
: as compared with two baskets the
! Cardinals shot.
Eighteen Fouls Called
Both teams were playing rough and i
I fighting hard. Altogether eighteen 1
fouls were called on both sides during j
this half, ten made by U.C.L.A. men, |
and the remainder belonging to the
i Cardinals.
Richards Sent In
Hunt sent Clark in for Smalling,
j center, and Richards for Berg at for- i
j ward but the Bruin scoring machine
| kept on functioning. Previously, Hunt j
| had placed Rothert to jump at center !
j for Smalling and then to drop back
to his position as running guard. This
j aided somewhat as Rothert jumped
i higher and gave Woodroof more com
petition on tip-off plays.
Friday night the Cardinals lost an
almost cinched victory when the
j Bruins staked a come-back in the last !
! four minutes of play and took the j
! game 29 to 22.
Neck-to-Neck Race
Up to that final rally of the Bruins j
! it was a nip-and-tuck affair since the j
! start of the second half. Led by Vin-1
j centi and Berg, Stanford established j
' a three-point lead, making the score
| 19 to 16.
Three successful free throws made
I by Ketchum, Woodroof, and Sunseri
| brought the score to a 19 to 19 tie. |
i Ketchum scored a field goal which ;
I was followed by a basket for Stan- j
! ford made by Richards, who substi- !
tuted for Vincenti. From this point j
on, the Bruins forged steadily forward
and the Cardinals grew lax in their
guarding, especially of Ketchum, who
I counted for two baskets in rapid sue- '
| cession.
j The first half of the contest ended
! 14 to 13 in favor of U.C.L.A. It was ;
