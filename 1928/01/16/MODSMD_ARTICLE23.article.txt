# FRESHMAN BASEBALL PROSPECTS STRONG SAYS COACH WOLTER
## 
### 
"They look like the makings of a
real ball club," said Coach Harry Wol
ter when reviewing the possibilities
of his freshman baseball squad. Wol
ter says the turnout has been the
largest since he has been coaching
Stanford teams, and includes a large
percentage of experienced players.
After only one week of practice the
1931 men are tossing the ball around
with remarkable accuracy.
Work has finally been completed on
the frosh diamond and the yearlings
had one workout there last week.
They spent most of it trying out vari
ous combinations of infielders. Pros
pects are very bright for an airtight
infield. There are plenty of good
catchers fighting for the first-string
position.
However, little is known as yet
about the far garden men and the
pitchers. There are a string of men
reporting for outfield positions but
none have shone particularly. With
seven or eight pitchers on the string,
it looks as though Wolter ought to be
able to develop a real hurler or two.
The squad has a little more than
three weeks to whip themselves into
shape for their first game, which is
set for February 11. The schedule this
season contains games with the Cali
fornia frosh, Saint Mary's frosh, the
San Mateo Junior College, and a num
ber of high schools.
