Elsewhere in this issue of the Daily will be found an account of a
meeting held yesterday morning between certain representatives from
IJ.C.L.A. and several prominent Stanford students. The scheme sug
gested by the visitors is that of an international union of students to
further better understanding between nations. The method by which
this is to be obtained is indeterminate but, to quote from the tentative
outline of organization, "it is suggested (the italics were in the document)
that the organizations (in the various colleges) promote the cause by
means of luncheons, social meetings, lectures, open forums, international
news in the college newspaper, attractive bulletins, personal contact with
foreign students, excursions to foreign lands, correspondence, moving
pictures, 'International Days,' etc."
To achieve this seemingly new work which, it is hoped, would have
such a profound influence in international circles, it is necessary to have
money. We quote again: "It is suggested that we ask three hundred
graduates to lend us $1,000 each." Hah, we read some more: "The
co-operation of all college newspapers is absolutely essential (not our
italics) to this plan" of promoting international understanding.
It is our opinion that this scheme would not help to produce what it
hopes for—a better understanding between nations. The mechanics such
as are suggested for developing student interest in other nations are
present en practically every college in the United States. At Stanford we
have such clubs as the Cosmopolitan Club, we have lecturers from foreign
countries, our student body includes people from many parts of the
globe—Siberia, Holland, Scotland, Switzerland, Korea, China, Japan,
Mexico, Peru, Russia, Bolivia, the Canal Zone, Germany, India, and
Australia. Such Utopian schemes as these which hope that college
students will some day stop foreign wars—while they are college students
—are ceasing to be even a novelt yany more.
