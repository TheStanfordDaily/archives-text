The adjustment between college and high school has always been one
of the problems with which educators concern themselves. More press
ing than to the educator is this same problem to the student who himself
must make the adjustment. At the University of Buffalo an experiment
was recently made along this line. Thirty-two high school students from
the lower two-fifths of their classes were given four weeks of training
preparatory to the college course of instruction. Training was given in
note taking, rapid reading, assimilating material, and memorizing—all
being facultees which the successful college student must possess. Of
these apparently inferior students so trained seventy-five per cent were
reported as successful in college.
While from the standpoint of solving the educators' and students'
worries of making the transition successfully, the experiment offers an
indication of what constitutes one of the chief weaknesses in college
itself. Consider the nature of these special courses: rapid reading and
memorizing. In other words, these high school students have been taught
to do what every college student must know how to do —cram. Skim
ming through a volume of outside reading for one course, ditto three
more for another, and memorizinz definitions, facts, dates, quotations, in
a rushing hurry ; do these and you can pass the majority of college
courses. It is chiefly on those rare occasions when one finds a professor
who can pass on a certain "contagion of enthusiasm" that concern for
these matters of rote becomes secondary.
1 hit then, it is much easier to find ways to make satisfactory adjust
ment from high school to college than it is to develop and provide the
instructor ideal.
