. And if you miss Yeliudi, who
will play twice in San Francisco —I
will never forgive you, not even on
my death-bed. I'd flunk G% examina
tions to hear him —and you must do
the same." So writes a friend, ex of
Stanford, now living in New York.
An undemonstrative person, one not
given to superlatives—except as a
humorous device, But he takes the
better part of a substantial letter to
tell just how impressed and moved
he was on hearing one of the two
concerts in which ten-year-old Yehudi
Menuliin of San Francisco fairly
swept New York audiences and crit
ics "off their feet" in the time-hon
ored press agents' phrase.
Those who have already heard him
play here with the orchestra or with
his teacher, the former first violinist
of the San Francisco Symphony, will
not wonder that he should have had
phenomenal success in both Paris and
New York, for they know the child's
almost incredible technical and ar
tistic achievements are sober facts, and
that he is healthy and normal —more
normal than many of the so-called
"grown-ups" among the virtuosi.
But what is puzzling — and yet
somehow enlightening—is the way in
which this yellow-haired child meets,
not only the most exacting demands
of intricate fingering, double string
ing and all the rest of the purely
technical considerations, but puts into
his playing all that is variously called
feeling, sympathy, poetic fervor,
depth, and so on. In other words, all
the fine import behind expression
which is supposed to come only to
those who have "lived and suffered"
o" "lived and loved" or most often
"loved and suffered." Oh. the time
honored plot of the artist whose play-

I ing, from mere technical correctness,
is broadened and deepened and wid
! ened until it has become real Art—
• all because lie has loved and lost, or
won! The conception hack of this and
| its ilk has been tacitly assumed and
accepted as gospel by the reading
and play-going public for so long that
lit comes with somewhat of a shock
I to find that there may he nothing in
: it after all.
In fact, the whole case of Yehudi
; give 3 one to think, and think, and
I think. For he is ten years old, plays
the violin because he loves it, reads
real hooks (not Rover Boys, Frank
Merriwell, etc.) because he likes
J them and understands them, is sturdy
1 physically and has a most charming
| manner, is imaginative and mentally
[ adventurous, and finally is one of the
half dozen greatest fiddlers in the
country today, regardless of age.
New York is pretty hard-boiled,
' musically speaking. It has to be just
| to survive under the annual burden
I of "geniuses" and "phenomenal sen
i sations" from abroad and from the
I homeland who annually descend upon
jit to make their debuts. And New
| York is sophisticated enough not to
fall for the "child wonder" business.
| But the Menuhin child, who enjoys
j playing his encores, and is neither
J bored nor frightened by great audi
! ences, does not need to have allow
; ances made for him; he is an artist,
| and plays his Each Chaconnes and
Beethoven Concertos like a master,
i And he's more of a real child than
| thousands among the painful crop
| whose chief interests are how soon
j they can get into long trousers, and
how many movies and chocolate bars
j they can absorb. Like most geniuses,
| Yehudi calls for a revaluation of
| some long accepted values.

. And if you miss Yeliudi, who
will play twice in San Francisco —I

he was on hearing one of the two

Those who have already heard him
play here with the orchestra or with
his teacher, the former first violinist
of the San Francisco Symphony, will
not wonder that he should have had
phenomenal success in both Paris and
New York, for they know the child's
almost incredible technical and ar

that he is healthy and normal —more
normal than many of the so-called
"grown-ups" among the virtuosi.
But what is puzzling — and yet
somehow enlightening—is the way in
which this yellow-haired child meets,
not only the most exacting demands
of intricate fingering, double string

technical considerations, but puts into
his playing all that is variously called
feeling, sympathy, poetic fervor,
depth, and so on. In other words, all
