# CAMPUS OPINION

I The Editor, Sir:
The Executive Committee, after re
ceiving with favor the recommenda
tion of our representatives to the Na
tional Student Federation as regards
I the instilling of the honor system in
all fields of endeavor, turns right
around and legislates that the annual
mud-fight shall be superceded by a
tie-up. This is done, primarily, be
j cause of the inability to enforce
i "rules." "Violations of the 'rules',"
J we are told, "were as common as the
| burrs in the Lagunita lake bottom."
Instead of providing for better en
j forcemeat of the rules, and attempt
ing to inculcate and promulgate the
! spirit of the "honor system" in the
i mud-fight, they admit that it is im
possible to get the students to obey
the rules of sair sport (iindeed, it
; can be called such) and believe that
by changing tlie nature of the "fight"!
| that they have by one stroke of the '
| pen, so to speak, eradicated all fiie
i evils (I'm glad to see they admi't |
| there are some evils) that prevailed j
1 in the mud-fight. Are we to believe |
| that no violations and better enforce-!
ment will result? If a person does not
j obey the rules of one game, will he
i obey those of another? If Stanford
; men do not learn to play the game
here will they follow the rules of the
great game of Life? I fear that there
will be no Executive Committee to
I change the rules to suit those who j
I cannot conform to the existing ones. !
Following the same line of argu
ment, the Executive Committee would
probably argue that since it is so
difficult to secure ample supervision !
1 of the Volstead Act that, instead of
concentrating on the enforcing of the j
rules (the law), should be changed to
j permit everyone to drink as this
would be much easier to enforce.
Perhaps there are some who at-!
tended the Stanford-Cambridge dei
bate on the question, "Resolved, That
this house regrets the tendencies to-j

| ward easier divorce." These persons
! will recall that since their existed
j many possibilities for misunderstand
ings that easier divorce should bo
made possible, whilst the affirmative
team maintained (and won) that not j
1 easier divorce should be advocated — j
but rather that a concentration to I
! eradicate the evils that caused di
i vorce should ensue.
The Executive Committee is argu
j ing somewhat along the lines of the
■ negative team —they arc concentrat
ing on the wrong remedy. This same
| line of argument is used at the so
| called disarmament conferences. In
i stead of doing away with tbe funda
! mental cam-as of war —intense na
tionalism, yellow press, the mental j
attitude of the peoples—they merely
ngre. l to go at each other with gases
in future wars —whereas in the past
: they only fought with liquid fire.
They, too, change a few "rules,"
but the fundamental causes still re
j main.
What's more, I believe that the tie-
I up will be much rougher. More slug
j ging and dragging of persons will
I ensue; thereby giving to those who
oppose this sort of entertainment the
opportunity of striking a death-blow
at all class contests.
