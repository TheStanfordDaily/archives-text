# AND Then Our Little SALLY

### 
Of course, sines today is silence
day, I shall not be able to say
very much about anything; I
mean, about anything of import
ance. And in order to be on the
safe side, well . . . did you realize
that last Friday was the thir
teenth?
And I really had the most won
derful time, my professors were
so darling. I really didn't feel well
enough to take my examination,
and v/hen 112 went in to say how
sorry and how disappointed ! was,
why everything was perfectly all
right. And make-ups really are
much nicer. They give one an op
portunity to really think about a
subject, the rooms are so quiet.
I thought I'd die, though, when
I actually sat right across from
the professor on the train going
up to the city. I guess he didn't
fee! well enough to stay during
the examination either.
There was the nicest young
man on the train with me, too.
He got quite friendly, and I really
enjoyed his conversation. He had
such interesting ideas about
co-eds.
He said that they all had minds
of their own and were so capable
at judging the consequences of an
action beforehand. I mean, he
seemed to think that they could
get along quite well in the world.
He is going to write a book some
day and wants me to pose for the
illustrations. I'm simply thrilled
to death.
And I am going to have tea
with him some afternoon v/hen
we can really consider what kind
of poses he wants. So thirteen is
really a very lucky number. It
all depends on the way one looks
at things.
