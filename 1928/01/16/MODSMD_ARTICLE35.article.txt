Kappa Sigma 10, Fighting Phi
Betes 9
Encina 2W 16, Business Men 11
Finishing the first round in the in
tramural basketball series, the Kappa
Sig and Encina 2W quintets ran up
victories over their opponents in Fri
day's games.
Hubler, flashy Kappa Sig forward,
led the fraternity team in scoring,
chalking up six points. At the end of
the first half, the eventual winners
had a three-point lead, but stood in
a fair way to lose it before the last
gun.
With ten seconds to play, the Kappa
Sigs, leading by a lone point, were
called for a foul. The Phi Bete, in
stead of trying for the basket, slam
med the ball against the backboard,
caught it as it dropped back, and this
time tossed it in the hoop. The shot,
however, was considered illegal by
the referee, and the game was given
to the Kappa Sigs.
Encina 2W, with the accurate shoot
ing of Mann and Wolf, found little
trouble in taking a listless 1G to 11
victory from the Business Men. The
first half saw the freshmen trailing
at the end of a 5 to 3 score, but in
the last period, they opened up a new
attack and literally swept the Busi
ness Men from the floor.
The schedule for this week's games
will be found on page 3.
