# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Here are two young ladies whose
ages total two or three years less
than thirty, and yet who are already
looked upon as fine prospects for
t T ncle Sam's Olympic team next July.
Lisa Lindstrom and Eleanor Holm,
both of the Women's Swimming As
sociation of New York, are justly ac
claimed not only as the rising young
stars of the mermaids of the day, but
also as two of the greatest swimmers
for their age that ever thrashed the
six-beat crawl-stroke.
To get down to facts, little Miss
Lindstrom has swum 200 yards free
style in 2:32 1-5 and 100 yards back
stroke in 1:13, while little Miss Holm
last year broke the world's record for
the 300-yard medley race, reducing
the time from 4:47 3-5 to 4:25. They
are considered better swimmers at
their ages than Gertrude Ederle was !
at 15—a statement that will probably ;
mean more to the average sport fan
than cold figures.
It is hard to say just what these 1
two misses will specialize in, as they
are both so versatile, Eleanor Holm,
naturally, stars in the breast-stroke, i
back-stroke, and crawl, as these are
the three types used in the medley
swim. In the women's national senior
outdoor championships held at Massa- j
pequa, N.Y., July, Miss Lind-'
strom finished third in the 880-yard j
free style, fourth in the 220-yard back
stroke, third in the one mile free

style, and swam a lap on the winning
U.S.A. relay team, while Miss Holm
was second in the 300-meter medley
and third in the 220-yard breast
stroke.
They can well smile over their rec
ords, this Mona Lisa of ours and this
little Holm girl!
