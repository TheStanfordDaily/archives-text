# FIRST YEAR CAGERS SCORE DOUBLE WIN IN WEEK-END TILTS
## Defeat Piedmont High 17-14 Friday; Down San Jose Basketball Men 
### 
Coach Howard "Muggs" Mitchell's
freshman basketball team emerged
from their two week-end tilts with
their record still unmarred by de- 1
feat, when they downed the Piedmont
High School cagers 17 to 14 in a slow
game Friday night and the San Jose
High five 41 to 15 Saturday night.
Mike Reynolds, first string guard,
took high-point honors in both con- j
tests and displayed a faultless brand
of basketball in bis defense position. \
During the closing minutes of the
second game, when he had scored but
one tally, Reynolds was shifted to the
pivot position, where he proved his
versatility by sinking five field goals j
and one free throw in quick succes- i
sion.
In the Piedmont High game the i
babes were slow to get started and at j
no time were they in what could be
classed top form. The first quarter!
ended with the score at 6-all, but;
during the remainder of the game the i
defense tightened and the Piedmont j
forwards had to be content with ;
shots from near the center of the !
floor. The freshman offense seemed I
to be having a great deal of trouble ;
in dropping their shots through the j
hoop even from close distances.
In the Saturday night contest the
babes jumped into an early lead which j
they held throughout the remainder |
of the time, showing a marked im
provement in every department of the ;
game.
