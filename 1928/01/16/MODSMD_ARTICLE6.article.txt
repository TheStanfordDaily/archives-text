# MALONEY CALLS FOR MORE BOXERS; GIVES MEN FIRST WORKOUT

"We want a varsity boxing squad |
of thirty-five to forty men this year,"
Coach Harry Maloney said yesterday.
"Twenty-four men are now signed up,
but we ought to have a lot of fellows
trying for each weight. No University
sport ranks higher both in the opinion j
of students and in that of outsiders j
in boxing. Stanford men have kept it |
on a high level, and we shall continue '
to emphasize the importance of j
sportsmanship and friendliness in all
bouts."
The first day's training for the var
sity was last Friday, the men being
given a workout jumping rope, shadow j
boxing, and sparring. Regularly at 5
o'clock every week afternoon the j
varsity will go through its schedule
in the Encina boxing room.
"Any man who can box at all should
enter the novice tournament next
month. No varsity members will com- I
pete. Last year several winners in j
the novice bouts placed in the Univer
sity championship matches held the
following month," stated Maloney.
Myron Schall and Fidel La√üarba
will assist in training the varsity. A
tournament with the University of
California may be arranged this year,
Maloney thinks.
