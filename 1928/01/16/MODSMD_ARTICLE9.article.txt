# STANFORD STUDENTS HEAR PLAN TO START INTERNATIONAL GROUP
## 
### 
Discussion of a proposed plan to
start an international organization for
the solving of international problems
was heard by a representative com
mittee of Stanford students yesterday
morning. The proposed plan was ex
plained by a committee from U.C.L.A.
consisting of Griselda Kuhlman, vice
president of Associated Students at
U.C.L.A.; Arthur White, U.C.L.A.
varsity debater; and William Forbes,
director of the U.C.L.A. news bureau.
The Stanford committee will hold
another meeting and present the plan
to the Executive Committee at its
next meeting to take action on it.
The Stanford committee was com
posed of Robert E. Littler, debating
coach, who has been interested in in
ternational work; Eleanor Davidson,
president of the A.W.S.; Fred Wool,
chairman of the Men's Council; Rob
ert Cecil, student manager; Leonard
Wilbur, who has taken an active in
terest in international problems; and
Murray Draper, president of the
A.S.S.U.
To Start in West
To start with a California organiza
tion, with the possible inclusion of
the University of Hawaii, and expand
throughout the world as fast as was
possible was the plan presented. A
school would not need to create a
new organization, but its member
ship could be advanced by any or
ganization interested in international
work. The U.C.L.A. delegates pre
sented this plan to Mills College Sat
urday and will present it at the Uni
versity of California today.
Financing of the proposed organiza
tion is provided from four possible
sources: American universities, for
eign universities, alumni, and other
sources. Each individual who joined
a member unit in any university
would pay one dollar a year. As the
interest is increased in foreign coun
tries, they would be asked to pay as
much as each country might decide.
The largest part of the funds
should be raised, according to one
suggestion, by asking 300 graduates
to lend $1000 apiece. Interest on this
would give sufficient money to start
the organization and to give prizes
for contests, which are considered
advantageous in creating interest and
enthusiasm.
If, at the end of three years, the
organization was unsuccessful, the
money would be returned without in
terest to the donors. If it was suc
cessful, the .organization might ask to
retain the money.

director of the U.C.L.A. news bureau.
The Stanford committee will hold
another meeting and present the plan
to the Executive Committee at its
next meeting to take action on it.
The Stanford committee was com
posed of Robert E. Littler, debating
coach, who has been interested in in
ternational work; Eleanor Davidson,
president of the A.W.S.; Fred Wool,
chairman of the Men's Council; Rob
ert Cecil, student manager; Leonard
Wilbur, who has taken an active in
terest in international problems; and
Murray Draper, president of the
A.S.S.U.
To Start in West
To start with a California organiza
tion, with the possible inclusion of
the University of Hawaii, and expand
throughout the world as fast as was
possible was the plan presented. A
school would not need to create a
new organization, but its member
ship could be advanced by any or
ganization interested in international
work. The U.C.L.A. delegates pre
sented this plan to Mills College Sat
urday and will present it at the Uni
versity of California today.
Financing of the proposed organiza
tion is provided from four possible
sources: American universities, for
eign universities, alumni, and other
sources. Each individual who joined
a member unit in any university
would pay one dollar a year. As the
interest is increased in foreign coun
tries, they would be asked to pay as
much as each country might decide.
The largest part of the funds
should be raised, according to one
suggestion, by asking 300 graduates
to lend $1000 apiece. Interest on this
would give sufficient money to start
the organization and to give prizes
for contests, which are considered
advantageous in creating interest and
enthusiasm.
If, at the end of three years, the
organization was unsuccessful, the
money would be returned without in
terest to the donors. If it was suc
cessful, the .organization might ask to
retain the money.
Discussion of a proposed plan to
start an international organization for
the solving of international problems
was heard by a representative com
mittee of Stanford students yesterday
morning. The proposed plan was ex
plained by a committee from U.C.L.A.
consisting of Griselda Kuhlman, vice
president of Associated Students at
U.C.L.A.; Arthur White, U.C.L.A.
varsity debater; and William Forbes,
director of the U.C.L.A. news bureau.
