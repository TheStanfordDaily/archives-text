(United Press Correspondent
HAVANA, Jan. 18. —Presidents of
two American republics, the United
States and Cuba, preached good will
and the solidarity of the western
world today at the opening of the
Sixth Pan-American Conference. The
twenty-one republics of the Americas
were fully represented for the first
time.
Greeted with a tumult of applause
in the National Theater of Havana,
President Calvin Coolidge urged
maintenance of the ideals of the west
ern world and warned that only the
Americas themselves must discharge
that duty.
President Gerardo Machado of
Cuba, opening the conference with a
short inaugural address, joined in the
plea for good will, saying that "the
nations here represented, though
politically separated, should be united
in the common name of America."
Will Draft States
The conference now has settled
down to work. Tuesday, at 11 a.m., all
delegation presidents will meet at the
University of Havana to draft com
mittee slates and decide, if possible,
the number of committees to be desig
nated to handle the work of the con
ference together with tentative allo
cation of portions of the agenda.
Had any American regarded with
qualms the reception which President
Coolidge and the American delegation
were to receive here, he was assured
Sunday by the 'tumultuous greeting
of the President upon his arrival that
Cuba was friendly.
And today he was more than doubly
assured. There were 7,000 persons in
t lie National Theater, banked row on
row, gallery on gallery, twice inter
rupting his address to applaud.
President Coolidge preached the
Golen Rule, peace and democracy for
the western world. He gave what was
generally regarded as a new vitality
to the Monroe Doctrine and Machado's
speech was interpreted as having en
dorsed that doctrine.
In less than an hour, President
Coolidge had laid before the Americas
his dictum that the American repub
lics must join together to work out
"their own destiny in their own way,"
and President Machado had declared
that "nothing nor no one can now
oppose the tide that impels the des
tinies of the western hemisphere to
ward its definite brotherhood under
the shelter of the juridicial standards
(hat are indispensable for the main
tenance of peace."
Distinctly, Pan-Americanism, mean
ing the good will of the Americas,
had triumphed. At the same time, he
declared that the policies he outlined
involved "no antagonism toward any
other section of the world or any
other organization."
The good will expressed and mani
fested at the conference augured well
for western solidarity, without out
side interference.
"The whole atmosphere of the con
ference," said the President, "is ani
mated with the spirit of democracy
and good will. All nations here stand
on an exact footing of equality, the
smallest and the weakest speaks here
with the same authority as the largest
and the most powerful."
The Nicaraguan situation was not
touched in cither address, as J'resi
dent Machado hopes that it shall not
be discusser! in the entire six or
eight weeks of the conference whose
agenda includes an ambitious pro
gram of law codification and political
understanding.

States and Cuba, preached good will
and the solidarity of the western
world today at the opening of the
Sixth Pan-American Conference. The
twenty-one republics of the Americas
were fully represented for the first
time.
Greeted with a tumult of applause
in the National Theater of Havana,
President Calvin Coolidge urged
maintenance of the ideals of the west
ern world and warned that only the
Americas themselves must discharge
that duty.
President Gerardo Machado of
Cuba, opening the conference with a
short inaugural address, joined in the
plea for good will, saying that "the
nations here represented, though
politically separated, should be united
in the common name of America."

The conference now has settled
down to work. Tuesday, at 11 a.m., all
delegation presidents will meet at the
University of Havana to draft com
mittee slates and decide, if possible,
the number of committees to be desig
nated to handle the work of the con
ference together with tentative allo
cation of portions of the agenda.
Had any American regarded with
qualms the reception which President
Coolidge and the American delegation
were to receive here, he was assured
Sunday by the 'tumultuous greeting
of the President upon his arrival that
Cuba was friendly.
And today he was more than doubly
assured. There were 7,000 persons in
t lie National Theater, banked row on
row, gallery on gallery, twice inter
rupting his address to applaud.
President Coolidge preached the
Golen Rule, peace and democracy for
the western world. He gave what was
generally regarded as a new vitality
to the Monroe Doctrine and Machado's
speech was interpreted as having en
dorsed that doctrine.
In less than an hour, President
Coolidge had laid before the Americas
his dictum that the American repub
lics must join together to work out
"their own destiny in their own way,"
and President Machado had declared
that "nothing nor no one can now
oppose the tide that impels the des
tinies of the western hemisphere to
ward its definite brotherhood under
the shelter of the juridicial standards
(hat are indispensable for the main
tenance of peace."
Distinctly, Pan-Americanism, mean
ing the good will of the Americas,
had triumphed. At the same time, he
declared that the policies he outlined
involved "no antagonism toward any
other section of the world or any
other organization."
The good will expressed and mani
fested at the conference augured well
for western solidarity, without out
side interference.
"The whole atmosphere of the con
ference," said the President, "is ani
mated with the spirit of democracy
and good will. All nations here stand
on an exact footing of equality, the
smallest and the weakest speaks here
with the same authority as the largest
and the most powerful."
The Nicaraguan situation was not
touched in cither address, as J'resi
dent Machado hopes that it shall not
be discusser! in the entire six or
eight weeks of the conference whose
agenda includes an ambitious pro
gram of law codification and political
understanding.
