# MASQUERS PLAY IS MODERN THREE-ACT COMEDY OF MADRID
## "The Romantic Young Lady" Was Produced in New York Last Year 
### 
"The Romantic Young Lady," by
G. Martinez Sierra, will be the Mas
quers play, to be produced on Febru
ary 10. The play itself is a modern
three-act comedy, with the scene laid
in Madrid. The translation is by
Helen and Harley Granville-Barker,
of the Granville-Barker family, promi
nent in the English dramatic world.
The play was first produced in the
Teatro Eslava of Madrid in 1918, in
London in 1920, and was given in
New York last year. It is one of a
group of Spanish plays that have been
presented during the past year in the
East, and that have been exciting a
great deal of interest.
Is Light Comedy
The production of a translation for
this year's Masquers play follows the
precedent of the choice of Franz
Molner's "Swan" last winter, which
was one of the high-lights of the cam
pus dramatic season. The play itself
is a light whimsical comedy, simple in
plot. It was introduced to New York
in connection with the recent interest
in translations, which was led by the
Theater Guild. This movement in
search of good drama was world-wide,
and it is due to this that the recent
drawing upon the modern European
field of plays of contemporary life has
been so successful.
The center of interest of the play is
a young Spanish girl, who is typically
modern, in the Spanish and European
sense, which is a new type of heroine
for campus dramatics. The subject
matter and the type of play makes it
an interesting variation in the pro
gram for the year, contrasting both
with the Sword and Sandals play and
the sophomore comedy.
Eleven in Cast
The cast of the play includes eleven
characters of decided variation, and
will provide opportunity for good
characterization work on the parts of
some members of the cast. Tryouts
for the play called out a large group
of men and women, both of new talent
and students who have appeared on
the campus stage before. Definite an
nouncement of the cast will be made
within the next few days.

New York last year. It is one of a
group of Spanish plays that have been
presented during the past year in the
East, and that have been exciting a
great deal of interest.
Is Light Comedy
The production of a translation for
this year's Masquers play follows the
precedent of the choice of Franz
Molner's "Swan" last winter, which
was one of the high-lights of the cam
pus dramatic season. The play itself
is a light whimsical comedy, simple in
plot. It was introduced to New York
in connection with the recent interest
in translations, which was led by the
Theater Guild. This movement in
search of good drama was world-wide,
and it is due to this that the recent
drawing upon the modern European
field of plays of contemporary life has
been so successful.
The center of interest of the play is
a young Spanish girl, who is typically
modern, in the Spanish and European
sense, which is a new type of heroine
for campus dramatics. The subject
matter and the type of play makes it
an interesting variation in the pro
gram for the year, contrasting both
with the Sword and Sandals play and
the sophomore comedy.
Eleven in Cast
The cast of the play includes eleven
characters of decided variation, and
will provide opportunity for good
characterization work on the parts of
some members of the cast. Tryouts
for the play called out a large group
of men and women, both of new talent
and students who have appeared on
the campus stage before. Definite an
nouncement of the cast will be made
within the next few days.
