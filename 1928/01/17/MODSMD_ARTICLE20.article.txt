I Kappa Sigma nosed out El Tigre
in a fast battle which was the most
| outstanding game of yesterday's play.
I The final score was 22 to 17. The
game was hard and rough, with both
: sides guarding excellently. Both
| teams were forced to resort to long
! shots due to their inability to pene
i trate the opposing defense. Mann for
Kappa Sigma was high-point man,
! scoring 13 of his team's total points.
In a game that tightened up during
| (lie last quarter, the Sigma Nu five
barely defeated the Business Men 20
■ to 17. The game was hard-fought from
| beginning to end, although the Busi
; ness Men got off to a slow start. In
; the final period they tightened but
were nosed out in the final minutes.

i bination of Saunders and Geen for
the Phi Kap's was too much for their

points to his credit. The stellar guard
i ing of Dinsmore was another factor
j contributing to the victory.
