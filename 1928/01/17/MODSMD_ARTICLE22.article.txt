# SANTA CLARA FIVE TO PLAY CARD QUINTET IN NEXT GAME
## Powerful, Tricky Aggregation Expected in Broncos; Goff Is Dead Shot CONTEST IS TOMORROW New Stanford Combination Promises to Withstand Opponents' Threat 
### Merle Emry 
Preparing for another contest
against the Bruins in their home lair
Saturday, the Cardinals will take on
the Santa Clara Broncs in a mid-week
basketball game at the Pavilion to
morrow night.
Little is known regarding the
strength of the Broncos except that
they walked over the San Jose Golds
4S to IS, the same team that Stanford
won from with only a ten-point mar
gin. However, the Santa Clara players
received a set-back Saturday when
the Y.M.I, beat them 4 Oto 29. The
Cardinals won from Y.M.I, by the
close score of 27 to 26.
Drones Tricky
According fo Husky Hunt, who saw
the Broncs in action against the San
Jose Golds, they have a powerful and
tricky aggregation, with plenty of
sharp-shooters included. Goff, for
ward, alone made nine field goals in
the Y.M.I, contest.
All in all, it ought to be an interest
ing evening for both parties con
cerned and the spectators, since
neither Ihe Cardinals nor the Broncs
have forgotten what happened in the
Stanford stadium one cloudy day last
fall when football was in vogue. Stan
ford has something to avenge while
Santa Clara will be out en masse,
hoping to crash through with another
victory.
New Combinations Tried
With both tomorrow night's and
Saturday night's games in view,
Husky Hunt shifted his players
around in the work-out period yester
day afternoon. Various combinations
were tried out by the Cardinal coach
for the purpose of finding one that can
stand the test of the Bronc and
U.C.L.A. games.
Big Harlow Rothert was worked out
at center with Berg and Richards at
the forward positions, and Vincenti
falling back to running guard with
Thompson. This quintet played a
somewhat better brand of ball against
the undefeated freshman cagers.
Whether this combination will start
depends on their action in scrimmage
this afternoon.
Vincenti Fast
Vincenti as running guard is fast
and puts up a fighting game while
Rothert at center gives that position
the strength it needed. Both Richards
and Berg worked well together in
the U.C.L.A. game and it is just a
matter of time until they begin to
count their attempts as completed
field goals. At present, however, both
of them are in a slump in regards to
basket shooting.
