It is along about this time of the year that various senior classes of the
colleges throughout the country begin to consider plans for raising endow
ment funds or rather, in general, sums of money for their respective alma
maters. At a class meeting to be held one week from today, Stanford's
Class of 1928 will discuss this very matter. Since matters like these strike
the rather sensitive part of the average student—his pocketbook—there are
several considerations of these endowment fund plans that are worthy of
comment.
In general it is found that the endowment plan of handling money
through contributions works more satisfactorily (i.e., more money is
raised) than does the insurance scheme. Briefly, this plan provides for an
annual pledge of any sum from all such present undergraduates as may
care to contribute. Thus, if you feel that you can contribute $5 annually
to a fund of this sort, you sign a pledge and contribute the money for the
rest of your normal existence. It's all very simple. In the case of the
Class of 1927, which was the first one to adopt this plan, no stipulation was
made as to what purpose the money would be used for, but rather it was
left to the "discretion of the University." The Class of 1927 received
pledges totaling $780 for one year, and it is reasonably expected that this
sum will constitute an annual addition to the income of the University for
some years to come.
If the Class of 1928 does favor the adoption of a plan of this sort
(which, in all probability, it will) the class would do well to emphasize the
stipulation that all of these contributions are purely voluntary. No such
ideas as not having one's name on the class roll if one does not contribute
should be countenanced for a moment. (What difference would it make
anyway?) "High pressure" campaigns are all right, but in cases of this
sort affecting the pocketbooks, the emphasis should be upon the "purely
voluntary" nature of the contributions.
It is, of course, a matter of common knowledge that the payment of
one's tuition is far from enough to cover the actual cost of an education
here. Roughly, the tuition fees cover approximately but a third of the
cost. Any contributions one may make, then, simply help to reduce the
implied obligation to the University. Then, too, there is the sentimental
argument. . . .
The benefits to the University from having additional funds upon
which it can draw would include, of course, the increased freedom to
embark upon its program for the future. 1 112 every class from '94 to '27 had
paid $780 annually the income of the University from this source last year
alone would have been $26,520. The total amount of money that would
have been available had every class contributed this sum would reach
$468,140, not counting interest. The only catch is that the Class of 1927
was the first to use this endowment plan.

left to the "discretion of the University." The Class of 1927 received
pledges totaling $780 for one year, and it is reasonably expected that this
sum will constitute an annual addition to the income of the University for
some years to come.
If the Class of 1928 does favor the adoption of a plan of this sort
(which, in all probability, it will) the class would do well to emphasize the
stipulation that all of these contributions are purely voluntary. No such
ideas as not having one's name on the class roll if one does not contribute
should be countenanced for a moment. (What difference would it make
anyway?) "High pressure" campaigns are all right, but in cases of this
sort affecting the pocketbooks, the emphasis should be upon the "purely
voluntary" nature of the contributions.
It is, of course, a matter of common knowledge that the payment of
one's tuition is far from enough to cover the actual cost of an education
here. Roughly, the tuition fees cover approximately but a third of the
cost. Any contributions one may make, then, simply help to reduce the
implied obligation to the University. Then, too, there is the sentimental
argument. . . .
The benefits to the University from having additional funds upon
which it can draw would include, of course, the increased freedom to
embark upon its program for the future. 1 112 every class from '94 to '27 had
paid $780 annually the income of the University from this source last year
alone would have been $26,520. The total amount of money that would
have been available had every class contributed this sum would reach
$468,140, not counting interest. The only catch is that the Class of 1927
was the first to use this endowment plan.
It is along about this time of the year that various senior classes of the
colleges throughout the country begin to consider plans for raising endow
ment funds or rather, in general, sums of money for their respective alma
maters. At a class meeting to be held one week from today, Stanford's
Class of 1928 will discuss this very matter. Since matters like these strike
the rather sensitive part of the average student—his pocketbook—there are
several considerations of these endowment fund plans that are worthy of
comment.
In general it is found that the endowment plan of handling money
through contributions works more satisfactorily (i.e., more money is
raised) than does the insurance scheme. Briefly, this plan provides for an
annual pledge of any sum from all such present undergraduates as may
care to contribute. Thus, if you feel that you can contribute $5 annually
to a fund of this sort, you sign a pledge and contribute the money for the
rest of your normal existence. It's all very simple. In the case of the
Class of 1927, which was the first one to adopt this plan, no stipulation was
made as to what purpose the money would be used for, but rather it was
left to the "discretion of the University." The Class of 1927 received
pledges totaling $780 for one year, and it is reasonably expected that this
sum will constitute an annual addition to the income of the University for
