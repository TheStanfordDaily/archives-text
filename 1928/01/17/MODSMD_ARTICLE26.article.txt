Under the Bull Session column, elsewhere on this page, will be found
today an article on the legal ramifications of the Hickman case. The
author, who, for the present, will remain incognito, has discussed the
possible results of the Hickman defense under the California Penal Code.
Today's article has been gone over by several members of the Law De
partment and in point of exposition may be regarded as authoritative.
The Daily will run two such articles per week. The next one will
deal with the recent encyclical of Pope Pius XI and its meaning. Most
of us don't know what an "encyclical'' is, let alone the possible meaning
of one. In the words of the circulation-chasing newspaper: "Watch for
it."
