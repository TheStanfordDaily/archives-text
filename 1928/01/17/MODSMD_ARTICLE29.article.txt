IT SEEMS TO ME—

Although the ease of William Ed
ward Hickman has been given more
than a sensible share of publicity,
and has become a point of avoidance
among thinking persons, there are a
few legal angles to the present trial
that are worthy of analysis and con
sideration.
Under the common law rule, and
the California Codo, prior to the 1927
amendments to the latter, a man
charged with murder had two plea 3,
"guilty," and "not guilty." In case
the latter plea were used, the defend
ant could avail himself of all the de
fenses that he had, and if insanity
were pleaded, there was an interrup
tion in the trial until the question of
his sanity was decided. If he were :
found sane, the trial proceeded on
the question of his guilt. If he were
found insane, it required a separate
procedure to send him into an asylum
for the criminally insane. Frequently,
that procedure was not urged and
followed, and the criminal was prac
tically free to go his way, and society
ran the hazard, yes, the menace, of a
repetition of the same or a worse act
at the hand of one that had been re
leased.
The last session of the California
Legislature amended the Penal Code,
sections 1016, 1020, 1026, 1026a so that
the plea of insanity was a separate
defense. The accused may plead "not
guilty," and in such event he is con
clusively presumed to be sane, and
may avail himself of ANY defense
other than insanity. If he pleads "not
guilty by reason of insanity," he ad
mits the commission of the offense
charged, but alleges his non-culpabil
ity due to insanity at the time of the
commission of the act.
Hickman's counsel has entered the
latter plea to the murder of Marion

Parker in their effort to stave off the
noose, and this is the first case in
California to come to trial under that
new plea. For that reason the case is
of more than morbid interest. The re
sult reached by the court in this case
will have a far-reaching effect in re
gard to similar pleas and cases that
will arise subsequently.
There are two possible results
under the code as amended. If the
issue of insanity is raised by that
plea, the defendant is tried on that
question alone. Dy rule of the plea he
has admitted the act charged against
him, so a finding that he is sane is a
finding of guilt, and is a conviction
of tlio crime, and the court may sen
tence him to death or life imprison
ment.
If the jury finding is that the de
fendant was insane at the time of
the commission of the offense he ad
mits, it is MANDATORY that the
court direct that the accused be con
fined to a state asylum—unless it
shall apepar that the defendant has
since recovered his sanity. But —
Here is the joker: After spending
one year in such asylum the criminal
may apply to the court for a hearing
and release on the basis that he has
recovered his sanity. If this can be
proved, he is released, and is again
free to prey on the society that has
left him a gaping avenue of escape.
He may not be tried again for the
same crime by the rule of immunity
from double jeopardy.
A cosmic tragedy, properly labeled
"A Travesty on Justice" would be the
result if the alienists for the Hickman
defense can convince the jury that he
is insane.
May the proverbially "blind" Jus
tice remove the bandage from her
gray eyes, and SEE that right is done,
and that the accounts of society are
balanced.

ment.
If the jury finding is that the de
fendant was insane at the time of
the commission of the offense he ad
mits, it is MANDATORY that the
court direct that the accused be con
fined to a state asylum—unless it
shall apepar that the defendant has
since recovered his sanity. But —
Here is the joker: After spending
one year in such asylum the criminal
may apply to the court for a hearing
and release on the basis that he has
recovered his sanity. If this can be
proved, he is released, and is again
free to prey on the society that has
left him a gaping avenue of escape.
He may not be tried again for the
same crime by the rule of immunity
from double jeopardy.
A cosmic tragedy, properly labeled
"A Travesty on Justice" would be the
result if the alienists for the Hickman
defense can convince the jury that he
is insane.
May the proverbially "blind" Jus
tice remove the bandage from her
gray eyes, and SEE that right is done,
and that the accounts of society are
balanced.
IT SEEMS TO ME—

Although the ease of William Ed
ward Hickman has been given more
than a sensible share of publicity,
and has become a point of avoidance
among thinking persons, there are a
few legal angles to the present trial
that are worthy of analysis and con
sideration.
Under the common law rule, and
the California Codo, prior to the 1927
amendments to the latter, a man
charged with murder had two plea 3,
"guilty," and "not guilty." In case
the latter plea were used, the defend
ant could avail himself of all the de
fenses that he had, and if insanity
were pleaded, there was an interrup
tion in the trial until the question of
his sanity was decided. If he were :
found sane, the trial proceeded on
the question of his guilt. If he were
found insane, it required a separate
procedure to send him into an asylum
for the criminally insane. Frequently,
that procedure was not urged and
followed, and the criminal was prac
tically free to go his way, and society
ran the hazard, yes, the menace, of a
repetition of the same or a worse act
at the hand of one that had been re
leased.
The last session of the California
Legislature amended the Penal Code,
sections 1016, 1020, 1026, 1026a so that
the plea of insanity was a separate
defense. The accused may plead "not
guilty," and in such event he is con
clusively presumed to be sane, and
may avail himself of ANY defense
other than insanity. If he pleads "not
guilty by reason of insanity," he ad
mits the commission of the offense
charged, but alleges his non-culpabil
ity due to insanity at the time of the
commission of the act.
Hickman's counsel has entered the
latter plea to the murder of Marion

Parker in their effort to stave off the
noose, and this is the first case in
California to come to trial under that
new plea. For that reason the case is
of more than morbid interest. The re
sult reached by the court in this case
will have a far-reaching effect in re
gard to similar pleas and cases that
will arise subsequently.
There are two possible results
under the code as amended. If the
issue of insanity is raised by that
plea, the defendant is tried on that
question alone. Dy rule of the plea he
has admitted the act charged against
him, so a finding that he is sane is a
finding of guilt, and is a conviction
of tlio crime, and the court may sen
tence him to death or life imprison
ment.
If the jury finding is that the de
fendant was insane at the time of
the commission of the offense he ad
