# RICHARD W. HUSBAND MAKES EXPERIMENTS WITH RATS IN MAZE
## 
### 
In a maze experiment that he has
been working 011 this year, Richard
Husband, graduate student in psych
cobtained results which prove
that the unreasoning learning ability
of rats is far inferior to that of a
rational human being. While the rat
learns by the trial and error method,
r nd his progress is slow and even,
human beings bring their intelligence
to the solution of the problem, with
the result that when they have sud
denly understood it their progress
chart takes an immediate leap.
The maze used for the rats was an
enclosure which leads, by a compli
cated route, with many blind alleys,
to a food-box. The rat has to be
fasted before starting its run in the
maze, since it falls asleep if it has
eaten. When it finally reaches the
food it eats heartily, and for this rea
son can not be tested more than once
a day. In the maze the rat snifs about
and explores every pasage and blind
alley at least once, finally discovering
the food. On the next trial he pro
ceeds as before, with a little more
speed, and on each successive attempt
goes less deeply into the blind alleys,
finally ignoring them entirely.
When he approaches a turn, his
course turns so as to prepare for it,

j thus it is his muscle sense rather
I than his sense of sight which guides
j him. When he can run directly from
i the entrance of the goal he has mas
i tered the maze. This learning process
I requires but little intelligence; for
J angleworms have "learned" tricks.
The maze used for the humans was
| a board with the maze superimposed
jon it which the subjected tried to
! trace with his fingers, his eyes being
i blindfolded. He could have as many
j as twenty trials in succession, and in
| this respect had an advantage over
the rats.
