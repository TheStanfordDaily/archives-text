"ROUGHING IT"

I roughed
The Freshman Dance
I yelled
A hearty welcome
To every couple
At the door.
The dancers
Seemed to enjoy
Our fun. But
A big guy,
With a dirty tone
In his voice
Said, "Gwan home!"
So cordially
That I left —
Saying things
In return,
As to where
That student cop
Would nicely burn.
* * *
AT THE SHOW
Man with "Date": "Have you two
together?"
Usher: "Nothing but single seats, ,
sir. And the singles are all apart."

ENCINA NURSERY RIME
Hey-diddle-diddle, a dining room rid
dle,
A Frosh ran away with a knife.
A sponsor was quick to see the rash
trick
And he paid for the crime with his
life!

"I did a "Little Eva Across the ■
Ice" in back of the Libe this morn- J
ing," remarked Little Oswald, blow-1
ing on his fingers to restore circula
tion. "Someone ought to write a dirty
poem about that mudhole so that the
University would get ashamed of the i
pig-sty effect and haul some gravel

in. I tried to write it but for once
the metre don't quite 'pan out'."
"For once?" I insinuated.
Oswald flushed uncomfortably.
"Well, someone has to say something
about it. I've been slushing through
that mud for weeks. Listen —
It hasn't rained
For a long, long time
But the Libe Parking Space
Is a sea of slime.
When I step in the slush —

rime)
