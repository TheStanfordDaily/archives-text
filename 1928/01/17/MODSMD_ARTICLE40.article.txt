# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The saying that "Too many cooks
spoil the broth" does not apply in
hockey, it seems, as Bill Cook and
his younger brother Bun have been,
and are, two of the mainstays of the
New York Rangers, the team that
finished the 1926-1927 season at the
top of the American group of the Na
tional Hockey League. There are no
more delightful players to watch than
these two Cook boys—for both are
fine-looking, stalwart, steel-muscled,
nervy cyclones, who swoop up and
down the ice armed with their hick
ory sticks and dare a thousand deaths
an evening for the sake of dear Old
Colonel Hammond, the Rangers'
Prexy.
But this is about Bill Cook, the
elder brother, who was christened
"William O." soon after he was born
on October 9, 1898, in Brantford, On
tario. Bill's dad and uncle both hav
ing been famous hockey and lacrosse
players, it is quite natural that the
youngster should prove adept at the
game. It wasn't long before he bename
a "Conquering William" of the steel
blades, and in 1925 he found himself
leading scorer of the Western league
with 42 points to his credit.
In 1926 Bill was at the top again
with 46 points, so that when he was
purchased with brother Bun (the two

are inseparable) by Colonel Ham
mond for $15,000 from Saskatoon, it
was no surprise when he finished his
first season in the N.H.L. as its lead
ing point-getter. Bill's 37 markers in
the 1926-27 season were accounted for
by 33 goals and 4 assists, putting him
one ahead of Dick Irvin, of Chicago.
