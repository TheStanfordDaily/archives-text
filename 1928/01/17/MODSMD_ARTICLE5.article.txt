# FRESHMAN CAGEMEN PREPARE FOR THREE CONTESTS THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Members of the freshman basket
ball squad were put through a con
centrated practice yesterday after
noon by Coach "Muggs" Mitchell in
preparation for the three tough games
which they must play this week
against the Santa Clara freshmen,
Galileo High School, and Pacific Grove
High School on Wednesday, Friday,
and Saturday nights respectively.
The Santa Clara five is considered
the best team that has faced the
Cardinal babes this year, having al
ready earned an enviable reputation
for its speed and unusually effective
offense. If the Stanford players come
off victorious in their game with the
Irish, they should have no trouble in
repeating against Galileo High School
Friday night, the Santa Clara fresh
men having already defeated this
team.
The coaches are drilling the squad
in a new type of defense, similar to
that used by the U.C.L.A. varsity. A
new first-string combination is also
being worked together, consisting of
Mears, center, Moffatt and Joujon-
Roche, forwards, and Reynolds and
Tampcke, guards.
Vance Fawcett, stellar forward, has
been forced to discontinue practice
for a few days, according to orders
received from the medical advisor's
office; while Freeman is suffering
from a broken finger and will be un
able to play for some time.
Mitchell also plans to use another
combination when a faster offense is
needed. This consists of Reynolds,
center, Joujon-Roche and Hawkins,
forwards, and Hepp and Tampcke,
guards.
