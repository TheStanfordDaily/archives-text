"They're skating on Lagunita . . .
Steam pipes tire frozen in Blank
: Hall . . . Coldest ever in California
I. . . frozen ears ..." Thusly ran the
; rumors on the campus yesterday
1 morning among students.
I To clear up the matter, the Daily
: conducted an investigation which re
vealed the following facts: Local
1 weather bureaus report that the mini-
I mum temperature yesterday was 27
degrees, the lowest the mercury has
j dropped in many seasons at Stanford.
No frozen pipes or other damage was
reported to the Corporation office.
The lake was. partially frozen, but as
i for the skating . . . well!
