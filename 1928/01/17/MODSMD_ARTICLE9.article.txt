# GLEE CLUB TRYOUTS FOR NOVELTY SKITS WILL BE THURSDAY
## 
### 
Tryouts for stunt men will be held
by the Stanford Glee Club between
3:30 and 4:30 o'clock Thursday in the
basement of the Engineering building.
Novelty skits are desired by the or
ganization, and one need not be a
singer to join. The addition of acts to
the singing program marks a change
in Glee Club policy. Hereafter novelty
men will be taken on the annual
spring tour of the south and will be
used on all regular club programs.
Last night a Glee Club quartet pre
sented a short program at the or
ganization meeting of the San Jose
Ad Club. Adelburt Culling, Arthur
Holmes, Ralph Wallace, and Homer
Barker, under the direction of S. Al
bert Kullman, were the members who
sang in San Jose.
