Dusty Rhodes' Free Throw—
or Fame for a Day
Titey didn't expect him to make a point. But
lie made a free throw. And that free throw was
the cause of their winning the game. The crowd
went wild and more girls wanted to put their arms
around Dusty's neck than he could accommodate.
Fame!
And after the game Dusty had a few team
mates around to his rooms. He served them
"Canada Dry." It made a big hit—even bigger
than winning the basketball game. More fame!
This ginger ale has a delightful flavor . . .
tang to it . . . dryness . . . sparkle. It has a
subtle gingery flavor because it is made from pure
Jamaica ginger. It contains no capsicum (red
pepper), and nola bene it blends well with other
beverages.
