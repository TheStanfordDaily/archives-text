# FRENCH PUPPETS AMUSE AUDIENCE BY COMIC ANTICS
## Polichinelle Takes Part in "A Barrel o' Trouble," "Red Riding Hood" 
### Margaret Cummings 
The stage is a black curtained booth,
and on it Polichinelle, immortal French
marionette, plays his parts. Last night in
the Perry Dilly puppet show in the Little
Theatre, he appeared in "A Barrel O'
Trouble." The barrel was more properly
of buttermilk, which Polichinelle pro
posed to drink "all by himself," quite
selfishly. But he would not pay for it,
and in the end the devil came for him and
his barrel.
Red Riding Hood Given
'In this and the three-act version of
"Red Riding Hood and the Wolf," which
was given, the delighted audience of chil
dren took part, answering the questions
of Polichinelle, and of the Wolf. This
factor, says Grace Stearns Dilly and
Grace Wickham, who operate their make
believe characters so skilfully, is the big
gest joy of the performance.
Their characters, grotesque figures of
wood, carved by Perry Dilly, are moved
by the hands of the operators rather than
by strings. Skillftil work makes the fig
ures seem extremely agile, and their an
tics are amusing. The lines in the second
and longer play are particularly goodâ€”
it is quite a sophisticated Red Riding
Hood who meets the Wolf in the woods.
Marionettes Talk
Eeach marionette has his individual and
quite fitting voice. It is hard to believe,
until one goes backstage and sees the two
women at work in their tiny booth, that
only two people are talking: two people
who enjoy their work and believe sin
cerely in the importance of Polichinelle
and his little companions.
