"During Grant's second term—an ad
ministration which was notable for its
corruption—a respectable number of men
in both houses were open to bribery,"
said Judge H. J. Ralston, internationally
known lawyer and arbitration expert,
who addressed Pi Sigma Alpha, political
science society, last night. "This smirch
had an influence even up until 1884 when
Blaine ran for President."
