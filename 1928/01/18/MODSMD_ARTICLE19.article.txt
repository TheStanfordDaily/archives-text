# FRESHMAN CAGERS TO FACE SANTA CLARA IN PRELIMINARY TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated freshman bas
ketball team will have a hard evening
ahead of them when they go into ac
tion at 7 o'clock tonight against the
Santa Clara University babes. This is
their sixth game of the season and is
a preliminary to the varsity-Santa
Clara contest.
The Santa Clara cagers are prob
ably the fastest aggregation that flip
freshmen have yet had to face; con
sequently the coaches have been drill
ing the members of the squad in a
new type of offensive play with which
they hope to penetrate the visitors'
defense. This play, which is similar
to that of U.C.L.A., will also be used
by the varsity.
The starting line-up for the Cardi
nal team has been announced as fol
lows: Mears, center; Moffatt and
Joujon-Roche, forwards; Reynolds
and Tampcke, guards.
If this line-up proves unsatisfactory,
several important changes are to be
made in the first-string personnel.
Reynolds, whose ability to play in al
most any position, came to light last
Saturday night when he was substi
tuted for Mears at center and sank
four baskets in quick succession to
take high-point honors, will be per
manently shifted to that position.
Hawkins, a substitute center, will
take Reynolds' place at guard, where
he played in the pre-season games,
while Hepp will be given a chance at
forward, since his size is too much
of a handicap in the guard position
which he has been filling up to this
time. Loomis, another substitute cen
ter, will also be shifted to forward,
where he should see more action
than he has in the previous games.
Friday night the babes will clash
with Galileo High School's unlimited
team and the following night with the
Pacific Grove cagers.
