—A somewhat seasick President of the
United States set foot 011 home soil this
afternoon, returning on the Cruiser Mem
phis from Cuba's marvelous reception to
him at the opening of the sixth Pan-
American conference, which is still in
session.
Mr. Coolidge, tired by the endless
round of activity in Havana, was forced
to retire during the forenoon on his trip
across to Key West. A ground swell at
the outset of the journey from Havana
disturbed the President and left him a
little seasick.
As a result, he abandoned his plans to
address the crew of the Cruiser Memphis
and gave the assignment to Secretary of
the Navy Wilbur.
Mrs. Coolidge, smiling and gracious,
Qompanied the Secretary as he expressed
to the crew appreciation of the ship's
courtesies.
Referring incidentally to the S-4 disas
ter, the Secretary commented:
"Some of the people ashore do not
seem to realize that we arc mourning for
our brothers whom we have lost."
Sailors stood at attention as Mrs. Cool
idge appeared aft, and saluted forward
after the speech.
