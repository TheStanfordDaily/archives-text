# PRACTICE PREPARATORY TO BRONCO GAME UNINSPIRING
## Changed Line-up Will Meet Santa Clara Tonight in Pavilion Game ROTHERT TO PLAY PIVOT Vincenti, Thompson Counted On to Stop Offense Of Opponents 
### Merle Emry 
"The poorer the dress-rehearsal,
the better the play."
If the old adage holds true, Stan
ford should have great success
against Santa Clara when the two
basketball teams tangle at 8 o'clock
tonight in the Pavilion, for the Cardi
nals had anything but an inspirational
practice yesterday afternoon.
Coach Husky Hunt has been delv
ing in his varsity material the past
week for a new combination that he
can try against the Bruins at U.C.L.A.
Saturday night. Despite the general
poor showing in yesterday's work-out,
he plans to start a new line-up to face
the Drones. Probable line-ups of both
teams are:
Stanford — Santa Clara—
Berg F Sherman
Richards F Goff
Rothert C Connolly
Vincenti G Barsi
Thompson G Maroney
Cards Need Tall Center
Hunt has seen the Broncs play and
figures he needs a tall center to jump
opposite Connolly, who is around six
feet three or four and the mainstay
in directing tip-off plays. For this pur
pose he has moved Rothert up to
center.
The guarding positions were
strengthened by placing Vincenti at
running guard to work with Thomp
son, who has shown consistency so
far. Berg and Thompson, the two red
heads on the squad, have plenty of
fight, and Vincenti should do his share
to pep things up against the fast
moving Santa Clara offense.
Visitor Sure Shot
Careful guarding will be needed
against Goff, a sure passer and a dead
shot. The Broncs are noted for their
ability to break from defensive for
mation into offensive in double time.
They have several trick plays they
use in getting into enemy territory in
a hurry.
In case the starting combination
does not come up to expectations,
Hunt will probably send in either
Cook or Bryant at one forward posi
tion and Smalling at the other, Clark
at center, and Simkins and Biaggini
as guards.

the better the play."
