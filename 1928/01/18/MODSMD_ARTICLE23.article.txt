# PETE DESJARDINS, '31, TO REPRESENT CARDS IN A.A.U. DIVING MEET
## 
### 
Pete Desjardins, '31, will represent
Stanford in the A.A.U. diving meet to be
held in Chicago April 4, 5, and 6. He
will defend his title there as national
diving champion for the third successive
time.
The diminutive freshman wonder, who
comes from Coral Gables, Florida, has
for three years been the best in the Uni
ted States at the low and high spring
board events, plain and fancy high plat
form diving, and is both indoor and out
door champion.
Desjardins took second place in the last
Olympic games, and will probably go to
Amsterdam this coming summer to take
a fling at the world championship. Ed
Throndsen and Walter Mills should have
a good chance in the national intercol
legiate contest, but Desjardins is ineli
gible for the varsity team until his second
year in school. However, lie will go to
the A.A.U. meet at Chicago whether or
not the team goes East. Colbath of
Northwestern University is one of the
chief contenders for this title.
