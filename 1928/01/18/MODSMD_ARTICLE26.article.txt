# Golf on Sunday
## 
### 
Much has been made of the fact that thirty-three men from Stanford
entered the Pacific Coast golf tournament at Del Monte last week-end.
By contrast with other colleges the showing was remarkable, for the
largest group that any other institution sent was a team of ten men.
Then, too, the fact that seven of Stanford's men qualified in the cham
pionship 2 ight of sixteen speaks well for the all-round quality of playing
by the Cardinals. And, to cap the climax, two Stanford men were
elected officers of the association: Ilerb Fleishhacker, president, and
Eldridge Coombs, secretary.
Perhaps some qualification may be necessary in terming the thirty
three as "Stanford golfers" for all of them paid their own expenses on
the trip. The reason, given by General Manager A1 Masters, for the
fact that the expenses were not defrayed, as are expenses of football
teams, is that the University ruling against athletic contests on Sunday
would have prevented the payment of any of the expenses. It is said,
however, that next year the tournament will not be held over a week-end
and on a Sunday. If this prediction proves true, Stanford will have a
golf team to represent it—one whose expenses will be paid. Masters has
expressed himself as being willing to send perhaps a five-man team if the
play were not on Sunday.
There is an interest in golf as a sport here at Stanford. For the past
several months we have been hearing occasional references to tentative
golf courses, if not 011 the University campus, at some place near enough
to enable students to play often. These stories in themselves have helped
to build up the interest but they in themselves were not strong enough to
cause thirty-three men to pay their expenses at the Del Monte tourney.
If some Eastern potentate with millions of good coins available were to
offer the campus anything in this line, we'd choose a golf course as the
first item. Does everybody agree?
