# Curiosity Provoking

It is of interest to note that Kirby Page, who will speak here next week,
cancelled his series of lectures which lie planned to deliver before Oregon
State College recently. The reason for the cancellation is said to have
been due to the "hostile attitude which President W. J. Kerr of that
institution displayed toward him." The subject matter of Page's lectures
was expected to have been denunciatory of compulsory military training.
Speaking of the cancellation, Page says, "Although he did not flatly
refuse me the right to speak, President Kerr referred to me as a radical
Socialist and seemed very nervous about the consequences if I were
allowed to deliver my lectures."
Page was not banned from Oregon but nevertheless the effect of his
cancellation with statements like these is similar to a prohibition of his
appearance. It arouses interest in those who learn of the incident, but
the publicity accorded to Page for this cancellation is not as great as if
he had been actually barred. At any rate, we look forward with curiosity
to the speaker's appearance here next Tuesday evening which will be
under the auspices of the University Committee on Public Exercises.
