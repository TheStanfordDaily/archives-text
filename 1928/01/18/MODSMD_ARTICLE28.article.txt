# And Then Our Little SALLY---

Well, I really was surprised when |
the man I met on the train called 1
me up. I was so flattered to think
that he would remember my telephone
number. 1 mean, he asked me so
casually.
And I never had such a fascinating :
time. His studio was perfectly ador- ;
able, and he said that I could see all
of it next time I came to tea. It really ;
was the strangest coincidence to find '
out that he used to be a professor on
this very campus. But he had to move
to the city and be an artist, author,
or something because the weather i
was too hot for him down here.
He seemed to think that fogs were
much more appropriate for his back
ground. He told me some of the most I
Interesting things about teaching col- j
lege students.
The best way to get on with them
is to find out about their life and
interests. The personal touch always
oeems to help.

And another way is to keep up per
sonal contact while in class. It really J
is true, too; because I have a profes
sor now who always makes the most I
amazing remarks at the nicest times.
I mean about how becoming my hair- '
cut is, or what a brilliant color your
dress is. Of course, things like that
always make one feel more at home
with a professor.
Why one day an instructor told me j
that he liked my lipstick, so I told
him that I would always use that
color whenever I was in his class.
I really think that professors
should always try to be interested in !
other things besides only the material 1
they can teach in a classroom. I
mean, they could tell us some very
amusing things that occur just before !
or after class, and possibly outside, j
At least, he seemed to know all about
everything except ... I mean he :
really used to be a good collego pro
fessor.
