A WORD FOR THE FRESHMEN
"Well," said Husky Hunt after Mon
day night's basketball practice, dur
ing which the freshman team scrim
maged the varsity, "perhaps if the
first string in its full strength had
been in against the frosh, the varsity
might have won."
A freshman squad that consist
ently beat the varsity—rara avis
among the fauna of the farm.
The speed and ability of this
year's yearling team gives pleas
ure to those who are wondering
what year the Cardinals are going
to startle the conference and put
out a five which will look top
notch. If the 1931 hoopsters don't
become scholastically mired or
too well impressed with their own
play, they ought to be able next
year to help Coach Hunt lift
Stanford, basketball out of the
rut.

SANTA CLARA TONIGHT
Tonight the Santa Clara freshman
and varsity teams will drop in after
supper for games in the Pavilion.
These will be two of the best exhibi
tions of basketball that will be seen
on the Stanford court this season.
Santa Clara's squad practiced all last
fall and as a consequence has team
work perfected so well that it now
looms, in Husky Hunt's estimation, as
one of the two best teams in the
state, St. Ignatius College of San
Francisco being the other.
* * *
TROJAN STRENGTH
U.S.C., among the conference
teams, is said to be good this
year. The Cards meet the Trojans
here in the first game of their
series on February 4. The South
erners have made approximately
a 40-point average in their games
so far this season and are a ram
pant five.
At present, it looks as if our
chances of beating California are
more nearly even than was sup
posed two weeks ago, following
its defeats by U.S.C. and St. Igna
tius. It is pleasant to come to the
conclusion that the Bears are at
last beatable.

TROJAN STRENGTH
U.S.C., among the conference
teams, is said to be good this
year. The Cards meet the Trojans
here in the first game of their
series on February 4. The South
erners have made approximately
a 40-point average in their games
so far this season and are a ram
pant five.
At present, it looks as if our
chances of beating California are
more nearly even than was sup
posed two weeks ago, following
its defeats by U.S.C. and St. Igna
tius. It is pleasant to come to the
conclusion that the Bears are at
last beatable.
