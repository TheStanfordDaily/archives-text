Introducing Emma Fervor to
Our Readers
"Is it safe to talk confidentially
over the telephone?" shouted Archie
at the top of his voice.
"Stand back about two feet, or
pianissimo that Torovoce," I directed.
"You're disturbing the whole office
force."
"I've picked up an authoress to
write for you. Met her up in Frisco
last night. Now guess how I met her!"
"You helped her pick out a book
at Paul Elder's."
."Don't be mid-Victorian, simple one.
Here's how! I was going along a
dark street when a snappy looking
gal gave me the glad eye. Well, you
know how I am —always looking for
a story and poetry matenial. I picked
her up and we started on a "tall"
party. Imagine my embarrassment
when she told me that she was Emma
Fervor, an authoress looking for story
material."
"I wouldn't say 'embarrassment,'
Archie. You mean disappointment."
"In a literary sense, yes. She would
have made a good story. She's a very
interesting person."
"You mentioned a story ?"
"I'll say so! I told her that you'd
publish it if only to please me. You've
GOT to put it into print! That prom
ise set me right with her."

HELPFUL HINTS TO CLUBS
Cabbages offers the following meth
od for securing the maximum attend
ance at a meeting:
1. Announce that the "Quad" pic
ture will be taken at that
time.
a. This assures a crowd.
2. Stand with levelled gun beside
the photographer.
3. Now that you have the "drop"
on them herd the members
into a room with barred win
dows.
4. Lock the door.
5. Proceed according to Robert's
"Rules of Order."

And that is how we happen to be
printing Emma Fervor's rapid, breath
taking, six-buckets-of-blood, paean of
passion called, "The Nest, a Vest,
and You."
THE NEST, A VEST, AND YOU
By Emma Fervor
Kicking aside the dead bodies that

obstructed his path, young Roger
Coxcomb made his way up the creak
ing ladder to the place where Sally
Watercolor lay bound and gagged
against the wall. In her eyes was an
expression of thankfulness amounting
almost to hypnosis, yet she seemed to
be trying to tell Rogers something
that she could not express. He rubbed
her lips with cool water, and she
spoke with more clearness. "Roger,
my hero, look quickly in the clothes
closet and bring me what you find
there. Oh, hurry! hurry!"
Roger turned like a shot and
yanked open the door of the closet.
"Well I'll be the second sun of a left
handed outfielder!" he said, standing
aghast.

What did Roger Coxcomb find in
the closet? And what made him refer
to his heredity in* no mild manner?
And why did he stand aghast when
there are so many more comfortable

ways of standing? Follow Emma Fer
vor's high powered "drammer." It's
absolutely true to life. The "heavy"
does NOT attempt to saw up the hero
in the Big Scene. He does NOT tie
him to the train tracks five minutes
before the fast mail comes rolling
along at a hundred and twenty miles
an hour. He but that is antici
pating. Watch for later installments.
