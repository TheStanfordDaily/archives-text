# CARDINAL BASEBALL VARSITY WILL PLAY NINETEEN CONTESTS
## Battle With Kenealy Seals On January 28 Opens 1928 Season 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball nine will
have a busy season according to the full
schedule announced yesterday. A total of
nineteen games is planned in all, three
practice games, fifteen conference tilts,
and a tentative contest with the Univer
sity of Keio, Japan.
in the first of the three practice en
gagements the Kenealy Seals will stage
the opening act of the 1928 season Janu
ary 28, on the local field. For the next
two Saturday afternoons, February 4 and
11, the Cardinals will entertain the Ath
ens Athletic Club of Oakland, and the
Olympic Club here.
St. Mary's Strong
The first game of the California Inter
collegiate Baseball Conference is set for
February 16 with Santa Clara 011 the
Brotics' home lot. This will be followed
by two more games with Santa Clara,
and a three-game series with St. Mary's.
Santa Clara, at present, is an uncertain
quantity, but St. Mary's, who captured
the conference honors last year, has the
team which the Cardinals will have to
bowl over if they have any claims on the
conference title.
On March 10, Coach H&rry Wolter
will take his ball players to Los Angeles
to play two games with both U.C.L.A.
and Southern California. Since the
Bruins' elevation to conference standing
at the first of the year, enthusiasm has
been high at the southern school. Noth
ing would seem better to the heart of
the Bruins than a baseball victory, as
well as a basketball victory over Stan
ford.
The three-game series with California
starts April 7. The first two tilts will
be played at Berkeley, with the final
scheduled for the home diamond.
