LONDON, Jan. 16.— (U.P.)— Charges
of too much entertainment and not
enough work were made against Oxford
University students by Canon Chatterton
Richards in an address at Durham.
The canon, formerly a professor at
Oxford, lias just been appointed profes
sor of Greek and classical literature at
Durham University.
He said he bad seen so many interest
ing things announced for term time at
Oxford that he wondered how under
graduates could get any work done.
These entertainments included concerts,
dramatic performances, political meet
ings, lectures on all kinds of subjects, and
an extraordinary variety of athletic con
tests.
