# BUDGETING IS TOPIC OF LECTURE BEFORE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
## 
### 
"We hear merchants tell of the good
old days when they made a net profit of
ten or twenty per cent. A store that
makes a profit of four or five per cent is
now regarded as successful," said Murray
Whittemore, of the White House, of
San Francisco, in a lecture on "Budget
ting" under the auspices of the Graduate
School of Business yesterday afternoon.
The lecture was the second of a series of
ten to be given this quarter by prominent
San Francisco business men.
Capital Earning Less
"Capital is earning far less than five
or ten years ago. The only way to make
money with reduced profits and increased
expenses is by a strict control of ex
penses. This is done by means of the
budget. Given an even break with good
merchandising and sales promotion, you
can forecast your expenses to within one
half of one per cent.
"The budget should not be built down
from an arbitrarily set expense for the
year, but should be built up from the
smallest account by a committee." He
gave the divisions from which a budget
should be built up as follows: salaries,
rentals, advertising, taxes, interest, sup
plies, service (lights and power), travel
ing, communication, repairs, insurance,
depreciation, professional services, and
miscellaneous.
Managers Restricted
The chief effect of a budget, according
to Whittemore, is 011 the department
managers, who are restricted to a certain
sum for expenses, regardless of the fact
that they may have no active interest in
the business. This tends to check any
extravagance on their part. In the White
House, the result of this is exactly as if
it were his own money, because he is
given a bonus for reduced expenses in
his department.
