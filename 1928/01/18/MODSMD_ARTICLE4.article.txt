## U.S. INTERVENTION IN NICARAGUA IS GROSS CRIME SAYS WHEELER Flays State Department, Kellogg, Coolidge; Calls Bankers Backers 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 17.—( U.P.) —
American Marines, like ancient Ro
man cohorts, are overrunning Nicara
gua while American airplanes are
bombing noncombatants, including
women and children, in the interests
of a group of New York bankers, Sen
ator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana
charged tonight in a vitriolic speech
before the Economic Club of New
York.
Serving the purposes of the small
banking group, "to all intents and
purposes, President Coolidge and
Secretary of State Kellogg are wag
ing an undeclared war against the
people of the little Republic of Nica
ragua," Wheeler said.
"No person of sound judgment," he
said, "can review the utterances and
activities of our State Department and
the President in recent dealings with
our Southern neighbors without com
ing to the conclusion that moral
chaos reigns in the department and
moral confusion in the White House."
The serious charges, comparable in
vehemence with those with which the
Montanan blew the lid off of Teapot
Dome, appalled even his listeners at
the Astor Hotel, who had expected
an explosion.
"Our State Department," W r heeler
said, "throwing American honor to
the dogs, recognized Adolfo Diaz as
President of Nicaragua. To do this,
it had to violate the spirit and letter
of the treaty which it had sponsored
and the constitution it had sponsored.
"When it failed to get away with
the raw deal it undertook to put
over, it began rushing warships and
marines and bombing planes to the
little country.
"Our airplanes have been used to
drop bombs upon non-combatants,
men, women, and children; our boys
in the Marines have been killed in
battle upon foreign soil without war
being declared," charged Wheeler.
