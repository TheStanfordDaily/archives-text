# SPORTS OF 1928

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '10 
This "Bounding Beauty," whom
you see shooting at you from the
Stars and Stripes, is famous through
out the length and breadth of the
land as a Chautauqua lecturer, maga
zine and newspaper writer, and movie
actor. Not being content with such
fame, the gentleman in question will
try desperately to gain an even more
prominent position in the spotlight of
publicity by trying out for the United
States Olympic team, wishing to
match his speed with the greatest
runners of the world who will meet
in friendly (?) rivalry in the stadium
at Amsterdam next July and August.
"Alia!" you snicker, "a movie actor,
a magazine fiction writer, and a Chau
tauqua lecturer, and he thinks he can
make the Olympic team!" But pause,
brethren and sistren, before you chor

tie too loudly, because this same
actor-author-lecturer has a very fine
chance of making the trip to Holland
next summer, and not at his own ex
pense, either. For Charles W. Pad
dock is a most remarkable athlete,
and neither years, cheers, nor beers
seem to dull the keen edge of his
speed, nor lessen his stamina.
Back in 1919 young Mr. Paddock
startled the athletic world by winning
both sprint races at the Interallied
games in Paris. Since then he has
competed in two Olympics, sprinted
his way around the world with Loren
Murcliison as a partner, won five na
tional championships, and has broken
between thirty and forty world's
sprinting records, including the stand
ard mark of 9 and 3-sths for 100
yards. Also, it might be added, he

had a row with the A.A.U. and an
nounced his engagement to Bebe |
Daniels!
