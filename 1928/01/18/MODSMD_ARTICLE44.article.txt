# CONSTRUCTION WORK ON AVIATION SCHOOL WILL BEGIN AT ONCE
## Hauling Material to Site; Institution Will Open On February 1 
### 
Materials were being hauled onto
the premises at the corner of El
Camino Real and Stanford avenue
yesterday, and construction work on
the buildings of the Palo Alto School
of Aviation will commence immedi
ately. The institution will be ready for
operation by the first week in Febru
ary, according to Lieutenant Norman
A. Goddard, head of the propect.
Approximately 100 applications have
been received, he said. Of these only
about thirty will be accepted this
quarter for the reason that the cus
tomary three months' work of each
term will have to be put into two
months, and a small group will make
this easier to accomplish than the
usual group of fifty students, which
will be admitted in the future. After
the first term the course will be
made to approximate the quarters at
Stanford.

The three Waco planes, to be used
for actual flying at first, will be on
hand when instruction begins. The El
Encanto, used by Goddard in the Dole
flight to Hawaii last summer, was
flown from Los Angeles last week,
and is at Mills field. The other two
ships are now in the south, and will

be brought here in the near future.
Fifteen hours of actual time in the
air will be required of each student
who successfully completes the
course.
