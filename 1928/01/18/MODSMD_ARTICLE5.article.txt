WASHINGTON, Jaij. 17.â€”The Sen
ate is expected to vote tomorrow 011 Sen
ate Resolution No. 1, by Norris of Ne
braska, to declare vacant the seat of
Senator-elect Frank L. Smith of Illinois
because of the expenditure of $458,782 in
his campaign.
General opinion in Washington tonight
was that the resolution would carry and
that Illinois would be short one senator
at Washington.
Questions Arise
Many constitutional arguments have
been made and it is still a question as to
what will happen if Smith insists on
pressing his fight further. For instance,
can Smith reclaim his certificate of elec
tion, deposited with the Senate when the
Senate convened last month, and present
it again at the next session of Congress?
Can the Governor of Illinois revoke that
certificate against Smith's opposition and
appoint a successor? What if Smith
should run for re-election and win?
Would the Senate, having once declared
him guilty of a practice contrary to sound
public policy, consider one exclusion suf
ficient vindication and accept him upon a
future appearance assuming he observed
the proprieties in his campaign for re
election ?
