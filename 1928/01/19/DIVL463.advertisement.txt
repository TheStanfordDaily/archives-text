Being
Well
Dressed
Isn't
Expensive!
Good taste does not
require an extrava
gant outlay ... but
it does require con
siderable care in
selection.
In the Phelps-
Terkel shop you
will find clothes
that are smart but
not extreme, ser
viceable but not
drab, and original
but not outre.
Our prices are in
variably less than
you would pay
elsewhere for
clothes and acces
sories of equal
quality.
