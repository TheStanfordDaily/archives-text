# SANTA CLARA FIVE WINS BY ONE POINT IN SPEEDY GAME
## Defeat Is Second Received at Hands of Saints During 1927-1928 BOTH SIDES SHOW FIGHT Rally by Husky Hunt's Men Fails to Tie Score In Last Half 
### Merle Emry 
Taking its second consecutive athletic
victory from Stanford, the Santa Clara
Broncs last night won a rough and tum
ble basketball game by the close score of
21 to 20.
With the game seemingly on ice for
Santa Clara and the score 20 to 14 in
the last five minutes, the Cardinals came
back with a rally and fought their way
within one point of tieing the final score.
It was the determination and fight of the
Cardinals plus the freshness of their re
serves that enabled them to come within
striking distance of victory.
Hunt Uses Subs
Late in the second half Hunt started
his string of substitutes. Smalling was
sent in for Rothert at center and Rich
ards for Berg at forward. Richards
made good a free throw which counted
fifteen for Stanford as against the twen
ty-one points for Santa Clara. Cook was
substituted for Clark at forward. The
Broncs started stalling and holding the
ball in their backcourt, but the fast
rushes of the Cardinal forwards spoiled
their game. Cook was fouled in execut
ing a side-line shot and made good his
free throw to bring Stanford's score up
to twenty. The bell rang a few seconds
later, ending the game.
First Half Close
During the first half the score was a
close race with each side alternating the
lead from the tie of two all. The Brones
showed their ability in breaking into a
fast offense, using the "112" formation.
The close guarding of Gough, star high
point man for the Broncs on the part of
the Cardinals was all that kept the score
so even.
In this period it was a zone defense
system pitted against the five-man de
fense style of the Cardinals rather than
between two offensive teams.
Stanford's inaccurate passing lost the
ball repeatedly to Santa Clara. Both
Vincenti and Rothert were high point
men of this half, each making a basket
and two free throws. Half time ended
with the score 10 to 8 in favor of the
Broncs.
At the beginning of the second period,
the Santa Clara trick formations began
to function. A scries of reverse plays
that worked with clock-like smoothness
gave the Broncs a well-earned margin.
The Cardinals were unable to get the
bail off tiie backboard and failed to fol
low through with their basket shots, due
to the height of the Santa Clara players.
Gough, Bronc forward, was high point
man of the evening, counting for three
baskets and two free shots. Vincenti and
Rothert shared honors for the Cardinals
with fouc points apiece.

Taking its second consecutive athletic
victory from Stanford, the Santa Clara
Broncs last night won a rough and tum
ble basketball game by the close score of
21 to 20.
With the game seemingly on ice for
Santa Clara and the score 20 to 14 in
the last five minutes, the Cardinals came
back with a rally and fought their way
within one point of tieing the final score.
It was the determination and fight of the
Cardinals plus the freshness of their re
serves that enabled them to come within
striking distance of victory.
Hunt Uses Subs
Late in the second half Hunt started
his string of substitutes. Smalling was
sent in for Rothert at center and Rich
ards for Berg at forward. Richards
made good a free throw which counted
fifteen for Stanford as against the twen
ty-one points for Santa Clara. Cook was
substituted for Clark at forward. The
Broncs started stalling and holding the
ball in their backcourt, but the fast
rushes of the Cardinal forwards spoiled
their game. Cook was fouled in execut
ing a side-line shot and made good his
free throw to bring Stanford's score up
to twenty. The bell rang a few seconds
later, ending the game.
First Half Close
During the first half the score was a
close race with each side alternating the
lead from the tie of two all. The Brones
showed their ability in breaking into a
fast offense, using the "112" formation.
The close guarding of Gough, star high
point man for the Broncs on the part of
the Cardinals was all that kept the score
so even.
In this period it was a zone defense
system pitted against the five-man de
fense style of the Cardinals rather than
between two offensive teams.
Stanford's inaccurate passing lost the
ball repeatedly to Santa Clara. Both
Vincenti and Rothert were high point
men of this half, each making a basket
and two free throws. Half time ended
with the score 10 to 8 in favor of the
Broncs.
At the beginning of the second period,
the Santa Clara trick formations began
to function. A scries of reverse plays
that worked with clock-like smoothness
gave the Broncs a well-earned margin.
The Cardinals were unable to get the
bail off tiie backboard and failed to fol
low through with their basket shots, due
to the height of the Santa Clara players.
Gough, Bronc forward, was high point
man of the evening, counting for three
baskets and two free shots. Vincenti and
Rothert shared honors for the Cardinals
with fouc points apiece.
