# HIGH CHURCH DEFEAT SEEN IN REVEALING SECRET TEXT
## Malines Conversations May Mean Further English Protestant Trend

LONDON, Jan. 18.—'The text of the
famous Malines conversations between
Roman Catholic dignitaries and High
Churchmen of the Church of England,
looking to reunion of the English Church
with Rome, was made public tonight after
Ix-ing kept secret for five years.
The text revealed for the first time
that the Anglo-Catholics had acknowl
edged the supremacy of the Pope and
that they had agreed that "In the com
munion the body and blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ are verily given, taken, and
received by the faithful. By consecration
the bread and wine becomes the body and
blood of Christ."
The reaction to the 15,000-word docu
ment, printed in both French and English
probably will be:
I—Further trend of England toward
Protestantism. The Papal Encyclical pub
lished last week which said that the only
way to world-wide Christian unity is for
dissidents to return to Rome, and the
action of Parliament December 15 in de
feating the revised prayer book measure
which made communion services more
ritualistic and more like the Catholic
service, indicated the swing of the great
English masses toward Protestantism.
2—Defeat of the revised prayer book
if and when it is again submitted to
Parliament.
3— Possible withdrawal from the
Church of England of the Iligh Church
or Anglo-Catholic faction.
4—Possible—but not probable—break
between the English church and state.
