# FRESHMAN BASEBALL FIRST-STRING LINE-UP DECIDED BY WOLTER
## 
### 
Upon completion of a stiff workout
| last night covering practically every
: department of baseball, Coach Harry
; Wolter formulated a tentative first
! string lineup for the freshman base
ball squad. Although this squad will
in all probability be more or less
j final, cuts will not be made for some
i time.
Competition has been keenest
j among the infield men. A young south
! paw named Cook has been stopping
{them high and low around the first
! sack and is Wolter's first choice for
| that position. Rounding out the re
i mainder of the diamond are Magee at
■ second, Johnson at short, and Goodell
! at the third counter.
Out of the usual flock of outfield
' aspirants, Hunken, Allen, and Teague
! at left, center, and right fields, respec
! tively, seem to be a little above the
J rest. Teague is also a good first-base
! man and bats left-handed.
The fight for catcher's position has
| pretty well narrowed down to Hardy,
; Fessio, and Oswald. These men are
all running fairly equal. Hardy is a
better slugger than the other two.
Likewise the pitching honors are
well divided between Rickelfs, Storey,
and Tickner. Storey has been show-
I ing lots of smoke while Ilicklefs has
i considerably less behind the ball but
! is showing more control. Tickner also
I needs to develop more speed. Ricklefs,
| another left-handed batter, is hitting
them out into the far pasture spaces
j with pleasing regularity.
