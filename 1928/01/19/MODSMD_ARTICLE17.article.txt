# STANFORD FRESHMEN DEFEAT SANTA CLARA IN SLOW GAME 22-10
## 
### 
Stanford University's freshman basket
ball team added another victory to its
already enviable record last night by de
feating the Santa Clara University babes
22 to 10 in a preliminary to the varsity-
S.C. game. The entire contest was fea
tured by poor shooting and good defen
sive work on both sides, Mears of Stan
ford taking high point honors with 7
tallies to his credit.
The game was comparatively slow, the
forwards being unable to .penetrate the
opposing defense and the majority of
points for both teams being made by free
throws. The score at half time was 9 to
3 in the Stanford babes' favor.
Reynolds and Mears were the individ
ual stars for the Cardinal team, Rey
nolds breaking up a great number of the
Santa Clarans' passes and getting the ball
out from under his own goal with plenty
of speed. Mears' playing showed a great
deal of improvement over that of the
last two games, despite the fact that his
injured ankles are still troubling him,
his passing and shooting being unusually
accurate.
Moffatt, Tampcke, and Joujon-Roche
also played well, each accounting for a
good share of Stanford's points. Man
well and Murray were the outstanding
players for Santa Clara, scoring four
points each.
