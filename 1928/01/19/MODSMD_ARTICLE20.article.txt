## 
### 
Alpha Delta Phi 33, Encina 3E 21
Theta Xi 20, Delta Kappa Epsilon 12
Beta Theta Pi 24, Theta Chi 11
Phi Kappa Psi 16, Toyon 8
Toyon and Delta Kappa Epsilon
each suffered their second defeat, and
Alpha Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi, and
Theta Xi each won their second vic
tory last night in the Intramural Bas
ketball Tournament.
Alpha Delta Phi put a well-drilled
team on the court which took Encina
3E down to the tune of 33-21. Marsh,
freshman forward, was the strength
of the Encina quintet, scoring a ma
jority of their 21 points. Moore
Dunkett were outstanding players on
the Alpha Delt team, both men play
ing good offensive games.
Holding a substantial lead over the
Dekes throughout the entire game, the
Theta quintet returned home with a
20-12 victory for which they can give
thanks to both Anderson and Kennedy
who sunk most of their goals in addi
tions to playing an excellent defensive
game. Richards and Adams shone for
the Dekes. The losers experienced no
difficulty in approaching their oppon
ents' basket, but were unable to score
often, although they had a lot of
chances.
A good Toyon passing combination
was not sufficient to better the Phi
Psi's third-period scoring which net
ted them a IG-8 victory. Toyon's of
fensive strength seemed to succumb
simultaneously with the Row men's
unexpected forward spurt at the start
of the second half. The game was a
ten-man contest with no individual
player outstanding.
The Betas, who profited by an En
cina forfeit last week, were given
their first chance last night in actual
competition and won over Theta Chi
24-11. The Bears' attack was centered
around Smith, who was the leading
scorer of the game.
scorer of the game. Richman, Theta
Chi's star forward, was not at his
best, playing under the handicap of
an injury received in a game last
week.
