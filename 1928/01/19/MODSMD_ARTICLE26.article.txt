Ihe situation in regard to the A.S.S.U. concert series is becoming
acute- I his year, the second in which the A.S.S.U. has sponsored a
series, sees the A.S.S.U. faced by the possibility of going some $1,500 in
debt by virtue of the programs offered. The programs offered during the
present year constitute attractions which in point of musical criticism can
be listed among the best in the United States. Claudio Muzio and Ignaz
Friedman have already appeared, while for future events Benianimo
Gigli, the "Six English Singers," and the Symphony Orchestra have
been listed. Despite this array of names, the series is in a bad way
financially.
There are several reasons why this is the case: in the first place, the
A.S.S.U. concert series runs in competition with the Peninsula concert
series. Both of these efforts to sponsor musical events in this community
draw upon the same classes of people and the saturation point for ticket
sales has been practically reached. Secondly, by comparison with last
year, the A.S.S.U. series may be said to be holding its own, but naturally
the current programs lack that newness of the "first time" and, hence,
lose out in appeal. The acuteness of the situation becomes apparent when
it is known that there were 500 less season tickets sold this year than last.
Since it appears that this situation will prevail next year as well, some
careful consideration should be given to the matter when it is discussed
whether or not Stanford should attempt to give another concert series.
A personal canvass of the student body has been made this year, and
every effort has been made by the management to eradicate the possibility
of going into debt to the extent of $1,500. Their efforts, however, could
not cope with what are the underlying reasons for the apparent lack of
interest in the seriesâ€”competition and worn-off novelty.
