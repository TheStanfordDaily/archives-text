# The
						Stanford Man
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan today observes his seventy-seventh birthday.
His influence upon the University itself has been entwined with the
institution since its founding. As its lirst president, until he became
Chancellor Emeritus in 1916, he was more than a guide, more than a
leader, to Stanford during its early days. Now, a dozen years after his
retirement from the presidency, his impress upon the life and thought of
those who pride themselves in being "Stanford men and women" of
today is almost as deep as it was upon those students and professors of
the first years.
What concerns Dr. Jordan concerns Stanford —and the the interests
of Dr. Jordan are many and varied. What concerns Stanford concerns
Dr. Jordan —this is as true today as it was in 1891. The two are insepa
rable for they have literally grown together. His the personality that
binds together Stanford people of the past and of the present. He is the
Stanford man.
