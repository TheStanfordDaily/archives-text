"Well, Mr. Cabbages, I'm not such a
•dumb sock after all!" announced
Archie triumphantly as he planted his
chilblains on our sputtering radiator.
"I know how to pick 'em!"
"Referring to Miss Fervor?"
"Ye-ah! Everybody's talking about
Emmy's new story we're serializing. I
call her "Emmy" now —you know us
literary people work fast." Archie
settled down in his chair, musing
about our new-found literary jewel.
"Are you going to rest on your
laurels —or will you contribute some
more of that rare verse from time to
time?"
"Why should I tax my brain when
we have Emmy Fervor? Just lamp
this torrid love sketch I got in the
mail this morning—
"May I print a kiss on your lips,
I asked;
She nodded her sweet permission,
So we went to press, and I rather
guess,
We printed a large edition."
That's just a hangover from the big
muggin' marathon we staged the other
night. Some honey!"

THE NEST, A VEST, AND YOU
By Emma Fervor
(Installment Two)
The girl's eyes were shining like
stars as she watched her Adonis gaz
ing into the gloomy interior of the
closet.
"Is he a man or a god?" she
breathed tremulously within her heart
of hearts. But her doubts were soon
changed to worshipful certainty when
Roger turned quickly toward her,
bearing in his arms with consum
mate awkwardness a small infant of
two years yelling like an accordion
in a hurricane and eagerly massaging
Roger's large manly ears.
"Crines," ha gritted out, all un
manned, "I would rather go through
liellfire than handle one of these
things!!"
His hand flew to his gun as a curi
ous woodpecker grinned in at him
through the window. "Shades of Audu
bon!" he muttered, crossing himself
as was his custom on such occasions.
Sally approached him and laid a timid
hand upon his shoulder.
It was almost dark now. At any
moment a more sinister sound might
be heard than the gentle tinkle of the
goldfish in the rainbarrel, or the
s':cry tittering of the ground squir
rels in the eaves of the house.
Suddenly that fatal sound came!
There was a step on the ladder —

Wuxtra! Fervor Scores Hit! Wuxtra!
"Well, Mr. Cabbages, I'm not such a
•dumb sock after all!" announced
Archie triumphantly as he planted his
chilblains on our sputtering radiator.
"I know how to pick 'em!"
"Referring to Miss Fervor?"
"Ye-ah! Everybody's talking about
Emmy's new story we're serializing. I
call her "Emmy" now —you know us
literary people work fast." Archie
settled down in his chair, musing
about our new-found literary jewel.
"Are you going to rest on your
laurels —or will you contribute some
more of that rare verse from time to
time?"
"Why should I tax my brain when
we have Emmy Fervor? Just lamp
this torrid love sketch I got in the
mail this morning—
"May I print a kiss on your lips,
I asked;
She nodded her sweet permission,
So we went to press, and I rather
guess,
We printed a large edition."
That's just a hangover from the big
muggin' marathon we staged the other
night. Some honey!"

THE NEST, A VEST, AND YOU

(Installment Two)
The girl's eyes were shining like
stars as she watched her Adonis gaz
ing into the gloomy interior of the
closet.
"Is he a man or a god?" she
breathed tremulously within her heart
of hearts. But her doubts were soon
changed to worshipful certainty when
Roger turned quickly toward her,
bearing in his arms with consum
mate awkwardness a small infant of
two years yelling like an accordion
in a hurricane and eagerly massaging
Roger's large manly ears.
"Crines," ha gritted out, all un
manned, "I would rather go through
liellfire than handle one of these
things!!"
His hand flew to his gun as a curi
ous woodpecker grinned in at him
through the window. "Shades of Audu
bon!" he muttered, crossing himself
as was his custom on such occasions.
Sally approached him and laid a timid
hand upon his shoulder.
It was almost dark now. At any
moment a more sinister sound might
be heard than the gentle tinkle of the
goldfish in the rainbarrel, or the
s':cry tittering of the ground squir
rels in the eaves of the house.
Suddenly that fatal sound came!
There was a step on the ladder —
