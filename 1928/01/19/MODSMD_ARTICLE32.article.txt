"ADAM AND EVE," Though He
Knew Better," by John Erskine.
Bobhs-Merril I.
There is a legend of vague origin,
which does not appear in Holy Writ,
that Adam had a first love, Lilith by
name, before he knew Eve. Mr. John
Erskine had availed himself of
Lilith's name and fame, such as it is,
to make her the most intriguing angle
of a triangle which seems to have
originated with our first parents: the
attraction which seems to reside for
a man in more than one woman—
and all the consequent woe that there
by encumbers the earth. Adam, Mr.
Erskine deftly implies, finally went
over to Eve "though he knew better,"
and thus brought about the fall of
man from that high estate of inno
cence and happiness which is sup
posed to have been his birthright.
With Lilith, Adam has shown the
bliss of such a state. With Eve he
awoke to realities as we know them
today.
In the very last sentence Adam,
who has been a general ignoramus
throughout the book, has the nerve
to say, "After all, it is a man's world."
Lilith was gone, and there is no rec
ord that Eve laughed, but the hills of
eternity must have rocked with mirth
— as you are likely to do when
you read this new book written by
John Erskine.
Mr. Erskine's theme is logically de
veloped. Adam appears suddenly on
the scene after a brief prologue and
begins to get acquainted with the ani
mals. Presently he comes upon Lilith,
who takes him under her wing and
teaches him various things, especially
certain secrets of Nature that have
been a closed book to him. She ap
pears to be, if you ask a serious in
terpretation, a personification of the
romance and beauty of Nature —the
perfect woman, if you like.
With her Adam experiences the
bliss of perfect companionship, undis
turbed by ideals and ethical aspira
tions. Then, as they are observing a
cow and her new calf, and discussing
the idea of maternity, Eve appears
suddenly behind them. The fall of
man dates from that moment. Lilith

has foreseen it and makes no fuss.
Eve makes plenty from that time until
the end of the book. She proves to be ;
intensely human, and is the most con-'
vincing figure in the story. Up to
all the old tricks that all women
know and that every man must suf
fer, she soon has Adam bound hand
and foot.
Their fate was in them and Lilith
became a sweet memory. Or perhaps
Eve invented the story that she |
turned into a demon. It should be read j
largely by women —and without doubt
will be. It has a lesson for all women
—and wives in particular: how to be
less like Eve and more like Lilith.

In the very last sentence Adam,
who has been a general ignoramus
throughout the book, has the nerve
to say, "After all, it is a man's world."
Lilith was gone, and there is no rec
ord that Eve laughed, but the hills of
eternity must have rocked with mirth
— as you are likely to do when
you read this new book written by
John Erskine.
Mr. Erskine's theme is logically de
veloped. Adam appears suddenly on
the scene after a brief prologue and
begins to get acquainted with the ani
mals. Presently he comes upon Lilith,
who takes him under her wing and
teaches him various things, especially
certain secrets of Nature that have
been a closed book to him. She ap
pears to be, if you ask a serious in
terpretation, a personification of the
romance and beauty of Nature —the
perfect woman, if you like.
With her Adam experiences the
bliss of perfect companionship, undis
turbed by ideals and ethical aspira
tions. Then, as they are observing a
cow and her new calf, and discussing
the idea of maternity, Eve appears
suddenly behind them. The fall of
man dates from that moment. Lilith

has foreseen it and makes no fuss.
Eve makes plenty from that time until
the end of the book. She proves to be ;
intensely human, and is the most con-'
vincing figure in the story. Up to
all the old tricks that all women
know and that every man must suf
fer, she soon has Adam bound hand
and foot.
Their fate was in them and Lilith
became a sweet memory. Or perhaps
Eve invented the story that she |
turned into a demon. It should be read j
largely by women —and without doubt
will be. It has a lesson for all women
—and wives in particular: how to be
less like Eve and more like Lilith.

"ADAM AND EVE," Though He
Knew Better," by John Erskine.
Bobhs-Merril I.
There is a legend of vague origin,
which does not appear in Holy Writ,
that Adam had a first love, Lilith by
name, before he knew Eve. Mr. John
Erskine had availed himself of
Lilith's name and fame, such as it is,
to make her the most intriguing angle
of a triangle which seems to have
originated with our first parents: the
attraction which seems to reside for
a man in more than one woman—
and all the consequent woe that there
by encumbers the earth. Adam, Mr.
Erskine deftly implies, finally went
over to Eve "though he knew better,"
and thus brought about the fall of
man from that high estate of inno
cence and happiness which is sup
posed to have been his birthright.
With Lilith, Adam has shown the
bliss of such a state. With Eve he
awoke to realities as we know them
today.
In the very last sentence Adam,
who has been a general ignoramus
throughout the book, has the nerve
to say, "After all, it is a man's world."
Lilith was gone, and there is no rec
ord that Eve laughed, but the hills of
