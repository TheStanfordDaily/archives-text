BERKELEY, Jan. 18. — (U.P.) —
Through education alone can demo
cracy and efficiency, two favorite be
liefs of Americans, be reconciled, in
the opinion of Professor Raymond G.
Gettell of the department of political
science at the University of Cali
fornia.
Addressing the Teachers Institute
in Oakland, he said: "Americans be
lieve emphatically in both efficiency
and democracy. Yet these are diamet
rically opposed. Democracy involves
the participation in the government
affairs in the hands of experts."
Woman suffrage and increased use
of the referendum were cited by Pro
lessor Gettell as examples of the
movement in the United States to
ward greater democracy, while city
managers, civil service examinations,
and the short ballot are instances of
a movement toward efficiency in gov
ernment.
However, Professor Gettell saw a
solution of the dilemma through in
creasing the knowledge of the people
as a whole concerning governmental
functions and duties.
