# Opera Committee Selects Synopses With Possibilities
## 
### 
Three synopses were chosen yes
terday from the manuscripts submit
ted to the Junior Opera committee,
as offering the best potential oppor
tunities for production. All of them
are collaborations. The authors are
Sallie Kinsman and Beverly Mac-
Anear, Herbert Reynolds and Jack
Shoup, Clarence Botitell and Melvin
Jones.
They are requested to submit full
finished first acts of their operas by
January 30, with accompanying
sketches of the rest of the play.
These first acts must also include
stage directions, suggestions for spe
cialty numbers, and indications of
chorus numbers. The final choice of
the winner of this year's junior opera
script and prize will be made from
these three first acts.
An unusually large number of sum
maries were received by the opera
committee this year, many of which
contained excellent plot suggestions
but were impossible to produce be
cause of technical details. One par
ticular synopsis that received favor
able comment from the committee
was a Chinese play. This was pre
cluded in the final elimination be
cause it departed too far from the
idea of a musical comedy, and had
more the quality of an operetta. "This
Chinese play was so lovely that we
regretted having to cut it in the final
list, but it presented difficulties too
large to overcome for a campus pro
duction," Hal Boomer, chairman, com
mented.
Eliminated manuscripts may be
called for by their authors in the
Green Room. The three pairs of colla
borators are asked to see Boomer per
sonally for the return of thei r
synopses.
