# NEW SUITS VARY COATS FROM SHORT TO LONG PRINTED SILKS BRIGHTEN THE FASHION WORLD TOPAZ JEWELRY, BEIGES INVADE EVENING MODE
## 
### Lady Vee 
Despite the low tendencies of the
thermometer and the probability of
many more rainy days to come,
Spring will out. Two harbingers have
already put in unmistakable appear
ances —Lagunita and the printed
silks in the shop windows.
For printed silks there is assured
a very colorful career this spring;
and the more diminutive the design
the more assured the career. After
several seasons of the large and very
flowery prints, the designers have
come back to the smaller and more
geometrical variety. Besides afford
ing a change from the old order, they
lend themselves readily to combina
tion with plain fabrics in the jackets
and coftß that are to be so much in
vogue. The ensemble of printed dress
and plain coat is already appearing at
the resorts, which guarantees their
chic for the rest of the world all
spring and summer.
The new coats have free range as
far as length is concerned —the new
seven-eighths length being as smart
as the accepted cardigan hip depth.
Many of them are fashioned of flam
ingo, a soft woolen fabric, and take
such spring colors as yellows, soft
greens, and light blues. Unlike the
short jackets, however, the longer
ones have much more freedom about
the shoulders, being roomy and loose
fitting.
A new phase of the evening mode is
seen in the unusual use of the beiges.
Beige satin has leapt into first rank

next to black, for striking smartness.
With it is worn the newly popular
topaz jewelry. This combination is an
unexpectedly good one, even when
worn by the in-between type that is
neither blonde nor brunette. For
whereas the "yellowy person"—dull
brown hair and nondescript skin—
must shy from the beiges in the day
time, at night a beige satin, with
topaz jewelry—and the proper rouge
and lip-stick! — gives her a real dis
tinction and creates a very satisfac
tory background for whatever is her
distinguishing feature, be it eyes or
smile.
The spring suit is already appear
ing in the Paris salons, and bids fair
to find more wearers this year than
last, due probably to the accepted
popularity of the cardigan jacket and
tweedy materials. The suits this year,
however, are distinguished by the
fact that when the coat is removed
there remains, not a skirt and sepa
rate blouse, but a dress that is quite
acceptable without tlio coat —having
a light-colored top and a bottom sec
tion of the coat material, a two-piece
dress in one. Some of the suits
lengthen the coat to the seven-eighths
length and thus make the dress seem
all the more dress-like.
The corduroy we mentioned last
fall as making its debut in the sports
world seems to have survived, and
though it is not causing a furore or
ousting the tweeds, it is still being
used for the suits and ensembles that
grace the spectators' stands.

a very colorful career this spring;
and the more diminutive the design
the more assured the career. After
several seasons of the large and very
flowery prints, the designers have
come back to the smaller and more
geometrical variety. Besides afford
ing a change from the old order, they
lend themselves readily to combina
tion with plain fabrics in the jackets
and coftß that are to be so much in
vogue. The ensemble of printed dress
and plain coat is already appearing at
the resorts, which guarantees their
chic for the rest of the world all
spring and summer.
The new coats have free range as
far as length is concerned —the new
seven-eighths length being as smart
as the accepted cardigan hip depth.
Many of them are fashioned of flam
ingo, a soft woolen fabric, and take
such spring colors as yellows, soft
greens, and light blues. Unlike the
short jackets, however, the longer
ones have much more freedom about
the shoulders, being roomy and loose
fitting.
A new phase of the evening mode is
seen in the unusual use of the beiges.
Beige satin has leapt into first rank

next to black, for striking smartness.
With it is worn the newly popular
topaz jewelry. This combination is an
unexpectedly good one, even when
worn by the in-between type that is
neither blonde nor brunette. For
whereas the "yellowy person"—dull
brown hair and nondescript skin—
must shy from the beiges in the day
time, at night a beige satin, with
topaz jewelry—and the proper rouge
and lip-stick! — gives her a real dis
tinction and creates a very satisfac
tory background for whatever is her
distinguishing feature, be it eyes or
smile.
The spring suit is already appear
ing in the Paris salons, and bids fair
to find more wearers this year than
last, due probably to the accepted
popularity of the cardigan jacket and
tweedy materials. The suits this year,
however, are distinguished by the
fact that when the coat is removed
there remains, not a skirt and sepa
rate blouse, but a dress that is quite
acceptable without tlio coat —having
a light-colored top and a bottom sec
tion of the coat material, a two-piece
dress in one. Some of the suits
lengthen the coat to the seven-eighths
length and thus make the dress seem
all the more dress-like.
The corduroy we mentioned last
fall as making its debut in the sports
world seems to have survived, and
though it is not causing a furore or
ousting the tweeds, it is still being
used for the suits and ensembles that
grace the spectators' stands.
Despite the low tendencies of the
thermometer and the probability of
many more rainy days to come,
Spring will out. Two harbingers have
already put in unmistakable appear
ances —Lagunita and the printed
silks in the shop windows.
For printed silks there is assured
a very colorful career this spring;
and the more diminutive the design
the more assured the career. After
