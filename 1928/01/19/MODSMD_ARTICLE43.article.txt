## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â€”Congress
will be asked to appropriate funds to
purchase a minimum of 300 new navy
airplane if the proposed five-year con
struction program is adopted, it was
learned today at the Navy Department.
This would more than double the pres
ent aircraft strength of America's battle
fleet.
In addition, if Congress approves the
program recommended by Secretary of
the Navy Wilbur, the navy personnel will
have to be increased by approximately
30,000 men, or one-third the present
strength.
