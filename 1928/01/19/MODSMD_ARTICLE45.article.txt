# OLD BOY SEEKS HELP IN POLITICAL NUMBER
## 
### 
Short epigrams, pointed comment
on politics, and miscellaneous jokes
are wanted by the Old Boy, and will
be continued to be wanted until Janu
ary 20, the deadline for contributions
for the Political Number of Chaparral.
The Chappies are anticipating con
ventions, so contributors should have
plenty of fresh ideas ready for this
opening of the fray.
The Old Boy is immersed in work
on his platform, but is anxious for
support not only in literary copy, but
art work, and cover designs. "This
time we will run wild," he announces.
"Especially we want to give Mr. Wil
liam Randolph Hearst a kick in the
trousers â€”not to speak of the possi
bilities of the Nicaraguan question,
the Mexican 'peril,' A1 Smith and
Tammany, San Francisco politics, the
coming Presidential scramble, and
any gents who buy their way into
office."
A prize contest is announced by the
Chaparral staff in connection with the
coming number. A prize of $2 will be
given to any student or faculty mem
ber who can ask a question about
United States politics which the staff
and Old Boy cannot answer. All
queries should be mailed to the Puzzle
Editor, Chaparral, Box 15.
