# SPORTS OF 1923
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"Consider the Montreal Maroons,"
etc., etc. —who are, if you ask me, a
pretty snappy outfit, and easily com
parable to Alonzo Stagg's Maroons
and the Fordliam Maroons. Pretty
tough eggs, these goal-sniping, hard
skating Canadians, who battle the
New York Americans in a National
Hockey League game in New York
tonight. Look 'em over, and you'll see
class sticking out all over 'em.
There's Clint Benedict as goal
minder, first of all. Clint is still one
of the best in the business, although
he has undoubtedly slipped from the
heights he used to occupy.
In front of Benedict are Dutton and
Munroe, a fine pair of defense players.
Bruce Munro is a veritable stone wall
on defense, using his stocky build to
great advantage in body checking.
"Red" Dutton is also a handy man to
have around —very fast, big, and ag
gressive.
Next comes the forward half of the

j team, and what a wow it is! There's
Nelson Stewart at center, chosen as
the most valuable player in the
league in 1926. Always a high scorer,
one of the biggest men in the league,
| and clever as they make 'em. The
j other two "S's" up front are Siebert
. and Smith. "Babe" Siebert, the left
I wing, is chunky and powerful, and
I skates around the Montreal forum
' twice carrying the puck within six
feet of him in seventeen seconds.
I That shows how slow that baby is!
j "Hooley" Smith was with the Ottawa
champions of 1923, and is usually
mentioned when All-Star teams are
being picked.
