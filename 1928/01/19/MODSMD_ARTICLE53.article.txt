# LARGE GROUP HEARS JORDAN CONFERENCES EACH THURSDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
During the past year Dr. David
Htarr Jordan has continued his Thurs
day evening conferences regularly,
covering many varied fields and
events. The conferences have been
well attended by students and visi
tors who frequently crowded into the
Jiving room GO or 70 strong.
Early Incidents Told
Dr. Jordan has related interesting
incidents from his earlier life when
he had thrilling escapes in the early
Mexican troubles, and when he risked
his life to climb the famous Matter
horn. He has discussed events that
came in the more mature period of
his life when he became a leading
educator and President of Stanford.
He has given his ideas of future de
velopments in education as well as
the early history of Stanford, its
ideals, and backers.
At a number of conferences Dr.
Jordan conducted open forum discus
sions on current topics, entitled "How
it looks to me." He gave his personal
opinion on all subjects presented to
him for discussion.
Religions to Evolution
Other conferences have dealt with
subjects ranging from religion to evo
lution. He has spoken upon science,
history, political science, and wars in
general.
With the exception of the month
of November these discussions have
been given regularly throughout the
school year. They are the only re
maining contact between the chan
cellor emeritus and the students of
the University. He discontinued con
ducting classes several years ago and
except for occasional speeches before
clubs and groups, his conferences
have been the only means of getting
into touch with the personality that
led Stanford for so long.
