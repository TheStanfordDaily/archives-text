ing tlie idea that a student gets more
knowledge out of a so-called "bull
session" than many formal lectures!
or classroom recitations, James W.
Armstrong, dean of men at Northwest-;
ern University, is an advocate of in i
formalism in education.
Dean Armstrong voiced his opinion j
at a recent fraternity luncheon. When
questioned further he explained that'
when a group of students get together j
for a talk-fest, they reveal their hopes, j
their likes, their scepticisms, contri-1
bute their own ideas, and listen to j
others in a discussion. Then, he said,
a student really gathers material that
has been dormant in his mind and
marshalls it up into opinions and atti-;
tudes of his own.
He went on to explain that a "bull
session" is not a "smut session." |
Only when a man takes part in a
session with the wrong attitude of
mind, according to the dean, does he
fail to get material value from the
talk-fest.
