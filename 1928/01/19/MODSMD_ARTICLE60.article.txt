# Chancellor Emeritus Will Spend Quiet Birthday With His Friends
## 
### Margaret Cummings 
She met me at the door, the lady
whose charm and gracious dignity
have won her a place in general es
teem next to that occupied by her
famous husband. Dr. Jordan, she said,
was busy; and I could hear the sound
of voices in the living room where
Dr. S. O. Levinson was discussing bis
new book, "The Outlawry of War,"
with the chancellor emeritus.
Then she spoke about the "simple,
evening party" which will celebrate
Dr. Jordan's seventy-fifth birthday.
From 7:30 to 9 he will have gathered
about him, very informally, the mem
bers oÂ£ his most immediate family,
and some few of his closest friends.
These will be from among the "old
guard," professors who have served
here since the beginning, working
along with him as mentor and friend,
who have watched and contributed
to the growth of the University al
most as much as has Stanford's
"Grand Old Man."
This year, in consideration of Dr.
Jordan's strength, the group of
friends who will share a part of his
birthday with him is smaller than is
customary. Mrs. Nathaniel Gardner
of Berkeley, Mrs. Knight Starr Jor
dan of San Francisco, and Mrs. Eric
Jordan will be with Dr. and Mrs.
Jordan. No ostentation of any sort is
included in the day's plans.
And that was all. As I thanked her

and reminded her of the general and
sincere "best wishes" for the chan- !
cellor emeritus' birthday she smiled
with pride, and assured me of her
husband's gratitude.
