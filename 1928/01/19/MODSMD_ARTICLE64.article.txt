## 
### 
John Dock, freshman tennis ace,
was given eighth place in an unoffi
cial national ranking published in the

It would not be surprising, accord
' ing to the Chronicle article, to see
tlie "first ten" fashioned somewhat
along the following order. 1. Tilden,
2. Alonso, 3. Hunter, 4. Lott, 5. Hen
nessey, 6. White, 7. Johnston, 8. Doug,
i 9. Van Ryn, 10. Jones.
