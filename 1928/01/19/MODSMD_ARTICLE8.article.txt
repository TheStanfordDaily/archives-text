# STRANGE SIGHT ON PALM DRIVE MAKES NATIVES SEEK ALIBI
## 
### 
Native sons are now busy with
the task of explaining a strange
phenomena noticed by many yes
terday noon on the Stanford
campus, when many a tropic
palm cast its gracious shade on
puddles of honest-to-gosh ice.
Student complaints about the
cold have been justified by the
figures. It has been cold. In the
words of "Little Sally," "I mean
it actually has."
The mercury took a record dip
to twenty-five degrees yesterday
morning, furnishing the sort of
weather which is not broadcast
with radio reports of games in
sunny California.
