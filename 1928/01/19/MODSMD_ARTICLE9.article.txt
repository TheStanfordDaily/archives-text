# AL SMITH FAVORITE OF DEMOCRATS SAYS PROFESSOR ROBINSON
## Strength of Leader Shown By Choice of Houston For Convention 
### 
A1 Smith's strength as a favorite j
for the Democratic party's candidate
for the presidency is shown by the
party leader's choice of Houston, ,
Texas, as the city for the 1928 con
vention, according to Professor Edgar
E. Robinson, Director of Citizenship
at Stanford, and an authority on party
politics.
"The selection of Houston," Pro
fessor Robinson says, "is an iiulica--
tion that a considerable number of the '
Democratic party leaders are even
now prepared to accept the nomina
tion of Governor A1 Smith. From !
their point of view, his nomination at
a convention held in the South will
weaken tiie argument that Smith is :
not a popular candidate in that sec
tion which usually goes Democratic
in the elections.
"It must be remembered that, al
though the Democratic party has usu-1
ally succeeded in carrying only the j
South, two-thirds of its ,voting !
strength has been in the North and |
West. With a certainty of the elec-j
toral votes of the South, Governor j
Smith has to win his election in the ;
populous areas in the East and Middle j
West.
