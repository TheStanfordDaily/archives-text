Gentlemen;
I am a veteran of the Edgeworth
army, still in active service.
1 make this claim, challenging all
comer.*, to have smoked Edgeworth
and nothing else but Edgeworth (when
it was possible to get it) for a longer
period than any other person within
the scope of your territory.
I have smoked Edgeworth for
twenty-one years and will soon start
on the twenty-second.
I'll admit to having tried other
brands, including so-termed high-class,
high-priced blends and mixtures,
enough to appreciate and satisfy my
self of the superiority of Edgeworth.
In all these years 1 have never had
one can of Edgeworth that varied in
flavor or otherwise.
Yours very truly,
