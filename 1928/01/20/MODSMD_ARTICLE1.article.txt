# THIRTEEN MEN TO LEAVE FOR THIRD BATTLE WITH U.C.L.A.
## Hunt Is Trying for Scheme To Get Forwards Past Opponents' Line BRUINS FAVORED TO WIN Cardinals Stage Comeback By Defeating Freshmen In Scrimmage 16-3 
### 
Husky Hunt and thirteen varsity bas
ketball players with their manager will
board the Lark tonight for Los Angeles
where they will be the guests of U.C.L.A.
in a third conference battle tomorrow
night.
The personnel of the squad that will
make the trip includes: Harry Berg,
Fred Bowers, Dowl Richards, Stan Cook,
Wes Bryant, and Bill Clark, forwards;
Harlow Rothert and Chuck Smalling,
centers; Louis Vincenti, Bill Simkins,
George Dobson, Albert Biaggini, and Red
Thompson, guards. Because of the illness
of Leon Levi, varsity basketball mana
ger, Major Godsol, junior manager, will
accompany the team.
Freshmen Swamped
Bound to take vengeance on somebody,
the same quintet that finished the Santa
Clara game for the Cardinals came back
and defeated the unsuspecting freshmen
16 to 3 in a scrimmage yesterday after
noon. The freshmen were swamped by
the fast rushes of the varsity men who
forced their way for field shots and were
unable to come through with their usual
guarding strength. All in all they looked
ragged in their first defeat of the year.
Hunt is trying to find some scheme for
getting his forwards past the front de
fense line of the opposing side. It was
for this reason that Rothert was moved
to center and Clark put in as forward
with Vincenti in the guarding position.
Probable Line-up Given
Judging from the performance shown
in yesterday's practice, Richards and
Cook, forwards, Smalling, centcr, Sim
kins and Biaggini, guards, will probably
start. This same combination finished the
Santa Clara game.
The Bruins arc the favorites to win.
They won both games against the Cardi
nals last week and they will be on their
home floor which gives them a larger
handicap. The Cardinals have improved,
especially on their defensive formation,
Hunt believes, and as for the outcome of
the game, all he would say was, "We'll
see. It all depends.
