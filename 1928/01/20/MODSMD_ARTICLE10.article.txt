# SERVICES TO CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARY OF CHAPEL
## CHURCH FOUNDED IN 1903 Building Erected in Memory Of Leland Stanford, and As Work of Love 
### Sylva Weaver 
Twenty-five years ago this Sunday
the Stanford Memorial Church was
dedicated by Mrs. Leland Stonford
"to the glory of God and in loving
memory of her husband Leland Stan
ford." For a quarter of a century the
church has been the spiritual center
of the University. This anniversary of
the first dedication of January 25,
1903, will be held Sunday with an ap
propriate service.
It is a coincidence that Jane
Lathrop Stanford was born 100 years
ago on August 28, 1898, in Albany,
N.Y. At the age of twenty-two she
was married to Leland Stanford and
the pair journeyed west to Wisconsin.
Here the University's founder felt the
attraction of the Far West and de
termined to move on to California.
The Stanfords first lived in Sacra
mento, where Mr. Stanford became
governor of the state during Lincoln's
administration.
Leland Stanford, Jr., died in 18S3,
and grief filled the hearts of the par
ents. Governor Stanford said that he
once awakened after a troubled night
with these words on his lips: "The
children of California shall be my
children."
Mrs. Stanford Took Up Burden
The University was founded in IS9I
and the building and the work of de
velopment went on. When Governor
Stanford died in June of 1893 Jane
Lathrop Stanford was left the burden
of completing the University and
managing the vast interests involved
in the endowment of the estate.
The story of Mrs. Stanford's life
after her husband's death is the story
of the University. She lived and la
bored and suffered and would have
died for it.
Mrs. Stanford once said that while
"her heart was in the University her
soul was in the Church," and she be-
lieved that it would fill the spiritual
need on the campus that nothing else
could fill. Her loyalty to her husband
and his work, and her charity, so
unostentatious and all-embracing,
were rooted in her piety. She was a
godly woman. Her religion was no
mere Sunday profession. It was the
breath of her life.
Church Symbol of Her Devotion
The opening services of the church
were held January 25, 1903. While the
University stands as a memorial to
Leland Stanford, Jr., the church was
built as the symbol of a woman's
devotion.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, on the oc
casion of the twentieth anniversary
of the founding of the Memorial
Church, said: "The Stanford Me
morial Church has been open to Stan
ford men and women and to the world
outside as well for twenty varied
years. It has taught a lesson of beauty
and devotion. It has kept to the
front the fundamentals of religion,
the love of God and man. It has ex
alted Truth and Kindliness. Pure re
ligion and undefiled is the definition
of human brotherhood. The basis of
religion is 'no dead fact stranded on
the shore of the oblivious years,' but
a present living way of life. The foun
dation is in the very nature of men
and in our relations one to another.
For Love is Heaven's very atmos
phere."
