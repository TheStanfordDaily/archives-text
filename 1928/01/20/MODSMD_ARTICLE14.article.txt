mer Stanford freshman sprinter,
who is now running for the Olympic
club, on the Stanford oval at 4
o'clock this afternoon.
Peltzer has covered the distance
in 48:1, and Spencer ran a 47:4
quarter last year. Hables will make
both turn in good times to beat him,

Peltzer, it is said, is suffering
from lack of condition because of
attending banquets and losing sleep.
However, he ran a 52 flat quarter
on a slow track at California, last
Tuesday.
