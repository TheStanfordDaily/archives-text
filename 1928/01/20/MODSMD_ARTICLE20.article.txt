# "Landscape Architecture" Newest, Most Elaborate Volume Of Press
## 
### 
"I think it's beautiful."
Stephen Child, author of "Landscape
Architecture," the most elaborate volume
ever published by the University Press,
was referring to the landscaping at Stan
ford.
"Stanford's problem is in the future,"
he said, speaking of the time when the
large acreage of the campus will, as he
predicts, be filled with homes.
Should Draw Up Regional Plan
A vast regional plan must be made,
Mr. Child declared, to provide for parks
and village business centers, so that the
increased population of the future will
not overcrowd this locality, and so that
the standard of architecture and land
scaping set by the University as it is
may be followed.
"I wish that I might be here more," he
said. "I shall make my home here as
soon as possible."
Mr. Child's book is a series of letters
from"The Landscape Architect" trÂ» "Mr.
A. D. Vance," who, beginning with a

, modest home for which he desires to con
| struct an attractive setting, progresses to
a point where he has a part in the zoning,
beautification, and development of a large
town. By this scheme Child covers the
various phases of landscape architecture
! from the standpoint of the layman and
; the trained member of the profession.
Famed as Landscape Architect
Mr. Child has been a landscape archi
tect for thirty years, for the most part in
California. He belongs to numerous pro
fessional societies in this country and in
Kurope. During the World War he went
to Washington and took part in govern
i mental town planning activities which
aimed at better living conditions for war
! workers. He gave advice in the building
1 of the community at Mare Island.
The gold and green medallion which
jappears on the front cover of the book
is of special interest to Stanford people
as the work of Delmar Daves, '26, well
i known while a student as a designer and
1 artist.
