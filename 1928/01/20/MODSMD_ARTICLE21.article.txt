# BABE QUINTET TO PLAY TWO HIGH SCHOOL TEAMS HERE
## Galileans of San Francisco Are Opponents in Tonight's Game FRESHMEN SHOULD WIN Mears, Moffat, Joujon Roche, Reynolds and Tampcke Are to Start 
### Whitney Wright 
While Stanford University's varsity
basketball team is absent in Southern
California this week-end, seeking re
venge against the U.C.L.A. quintet,
the undefeated freshman cagers will
take the center of the stage when
they clash with the Galileo High
School five tonight and the Pacific
Grove High School tomorrow night.
Both games will be played in the
Pavilion and will begin at 8 o'clock.
Although comparative scores point
to a Cardinal victory against the
Galileo squad tonight, the coaches are
looking for a tough tussle, since the
babes have not been playing in top
form lately and are facing a team
which rates near the top among the
high schools of the state. However,
both Piedmont High and the Santa
Clara University freshmen, teams
which fell before the Cardinal babes,
have scored victories against the San
Franciscans.
Pacific Grove Unknown Quantity
The boys from Pacific Grove are
an unknown quantity as far as play
ing ability is concerned, and this fact
makes conjecture as to the outcome
of Saturday night's game useless.
Coach "Muggs" Mitchell has an
nounced the starting line-up against
Galileo as follows: Mears, center,
Moffatt and Joujon-Roche, forwards,
Reynolds and Tampcke, guards. The
starting line-up for Saturday niglit
will depend on the play in this game.
If these men can run up a large
enough score during the first part of
