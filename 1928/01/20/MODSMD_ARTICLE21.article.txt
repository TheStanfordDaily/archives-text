# BABE QUINTET TO PLAY TWO HIGH SCHOOL TEAMS HERE
## Galileans of San Francisco Are Opponents in Tonight's Game FRESHMEN SHOULD WIN Mears, Moffat, Joujon Roche, Reynolds and Tampcke Are to Start 
### Whitney Wright 
While Stanford University's varsity
basketball team is absent in Southern
California this week-end, seeking re
venge against the U.C.L.A. quintet,
the undefeated freshman cagers will
take the center of the stage when
they clash with the Galileo High
School five tonight and the Pacific
Grove High School tomorrow night.
Both games will be played in the
Pavilion and will begin at 8 o'clock.
Although comparative scores point
to a Cardinal victory against the
Galileo squad tonight, the coaches are
looking for a tough tussle, since the
babes have not been playing in top
form lately and are facing a team
which rates near the top among the
high schools of the state. However,
both Piedmont High and the Santa
Clara University freshmen, teams
which fell before the Cardinal babes,
have scored victories against the San
Franciscans.
Pacific Grove Unknown Quantity
The boys from Pacific Grove are
an unknown quantity as far as play
ing ability is concerned, and this fact
makes conjecture as to the outcome
of Saturday night's game useless.
Coach "Muggs" Mitchell has an
nounced the starting line-up against
Galileo as follows: Mears, center,
Moffatt and Joujon-Roche, forwards,
Reynolds and Tampcke, guards. The
starting line-up for Saturday niglit
will depend on the play in this game.
If these men can run up a large
enough score during the first part of
the contest, Mitchell also plans to
give Loomis, Hepp, Hawkins, and
Ehrhorn a share of the action. Faw
cett and Freeman are still unable to
do much playing because of physical
hurts.
The Moffat, Joujon-Roche, and
Mears combination proved highly suc
cessful in its first real trial against
the Santa Clara babes Wednesday
night and if it does as well tonight,
it probably will play exclusively here
after. Mears is still a little slow to
get down the floor, but makes up for
this by his accurate passing, which
bolsters the weakest spot in the
babes' playing.
California Series Scheduled
Following is the place and date of
the annual three-game series between
the Stanford and California freshman
quintets, as announced from the of

makes conjecture as to the outcome
of Saturday night's game useless.
Coach "Muggs" Mitchell has an
nounced the starting line-up against
Galileo as follows: Mears, center,
Moffatt and Joujon-Roche, forwards,
Reynolds and Tampcke, guards. The
starting line-up for Saturday niglit
will depend on the play in this game.
If these men can run up a large
enough score during the first part of
the contest, Mitchell also plans to
give Loomis, Hepp, Hawkins, and
Ehrhorn a share of the action. Faw
cett and Freeman are still unable to
do much playing because of physical
hurts.
The Moffat, Joujon-Roche, and
Mears combination proved highly suc
cessful in its first real trial against
the Santa Clara babes Wednesday
night and if it does as well tonight,
it probably will play exclusively here
after. Mears is still a little slow to
get down the floor, but makes up for
this by his accurate passing, which
bolsters the weakest spot in the
babes' playing.
California Series Scheduled
Following is the place and date of
the annual three-game series between
the Stanford and California freshman
quintets, as announced from the of
fice of the Stanford Board of Athletic
Control late yesterday afternoon:
February 15, at Berkeley; February
22, at Stanford; February 25 (tenta
tive).
The third game will be played as a

preliminary to the varsity-California!
game at Kezar Auditorium if a third
game in their series is necessary.
Otherwise it will be played at Stan- 1
ford.
While Stanford University's varsity
basketball team is absent in Southern
California this week-end, seeking re
venge against the U.C.L.A. quintet,
the undefeated freshman cagers will
take the center of the stage when
they clash with the Galileo High
School five tonight and the Pacific
Grove High School tomorrow night.
Both games will be played in the
Pavilion and will begin at 8 o'clock.
Although comparative scores point
to a Cardinal victory against the
Galileo squad tonight, the coaches are
looking for a tough tussle, since the
babes have not been playing in top
form lately and are facing a team
which rates near the top among the
high schools of the state. However,
both Piedmont High and the Santa
Clara University freshmen, teams
which fell before the Cardinal babes,
have scored victories against the San
Franciscans.
Pacific Grove Unknown Quantity
The boys from Pacific Grove are
an unknown quantity as far as play
ing ability is concerned, and this fact
makes conjecture as to the outcome
of Saturday night's game useless.
