That the old foible of "collegiate dirt" has not lost reader appeal in
the eyes of city editors was made apparent in an edition of a San Fran
cisco paper yesterday. A full summary of what was termed the "newest
college talk jargon," as the 1928 collegian s slang was termed, formed the
basis of what someone evidently thought would be a good, readable, true
story. Taste these tidbits and decide for yourself: "I'm going to snag me
a good Indian, drag her to a brawl in my hearse 'cause I sure like toting
a torrid mama and hoofing a hug with her to tight music If you
would be ultra-modern you go 'sissy-kissing,' you do not neck You
call an uncouth fellow a 'Seth.' .... If you meet a girl you don't like,
refer to her as a 'hard-nosed cookie'."
Now, have you ever heard of any of these phrases, let alone use
them? No? Well, it makes a better story to say that you, as a college
student, do use them.
Ihe article says further: "And one intrepid Stanford student even
dared to say that there had been a tremendous decrease in the art of
slinging pert phrases." Because a phone call from San Francisco to
Palo Alto 1074 Wednesday afternoon was one of the means by which
"material" was obtained for this story, we are inclined to think that the
"decrease" mentioned was the "straight stuff," the "dope" if you will,
and that other gibberish cannot be truthfully called "collegiate slang."
