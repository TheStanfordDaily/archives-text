# Lots of Heaven
## 
### 
Directly above the campus one can see on almost any night stars,
planets, and heavens in general without end. That is, all of this can be
seen with the naked eye, but to see it with a telescope you must go else
where. Stanford has the telescope—two of them, in fact—but no place
to mount it!
The demand for an observatory of some sort to be established on the
campus is long-standing. Classes in astronomy are a regular part of the
curriculum and are attended by seventy to a hundred students each
quarter they arc given, in spite of the fact that this work is seriousl)
handicapped by the lack of facilities for observations of even the mos.
basic nature.
The Mathematics department has two telescopes, a 5-inch refractor
and a 6-inch reffector, which can be used if a suitable building can be had
in which to mount them. An observatory which will provide space fo;
one mounting can be built for less than $2,000. A more satisfactory ar
rangement, with space for two or three mountings and a classroom, will
reach $20,000 or over.
Manifestly the University can hardly be expected to expend the
larger sum. The best hope here is from a private donation or fron.
increased endowment funds. The construction of a smaller structure,
however, would entail no great outlay, and should be done without
greatly embarrassing the budget, llence, we suggest: That, first, a care
ful census be made of the chances of securing a large observatory via
the endowment method, if these chances appear to be too remote, let,
secondly, provision for the smaller building be made from the regular
funds without delay.
