"PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, Jan.
19. — (I.P.) —Philip Brasher, *06, civil
engineer, has invented a compressed
air breakwater which has been tested
and proven a success.
Perforated pipes are laid along the |
shore beneath the surface of the'
water. Compressed air, forced from'
the shore through pipes, rises in bub- j
bles to the surface and causes the
waves to break.
"The areas protected by these pipes I
are as calm as the waters of a harbor
shielded by a reef over which the
seas break," Brasher declares.
