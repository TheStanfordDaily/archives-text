IT SEEMS TO ME—
That the recent encyclical of Pope j
Pius XI is one of the most reactionary |
documents and statements of religious i
policy of the last century. It may be
recalled that an "encyclical" is a cir
cular, or open letter, published by the
Pope, regarding affairs and policies <
of the Catholic Church. This particu- j
lar document was issued by the j
pontiff at Rome in response to the !
present movement toward some pos
sible mutual understanding and unity
among the Christian churches of the [
world. The declared stand of the Catli-1
olic Church has banished forever such J
a possibility.
It declares, in substance, that any ;
compromise is impossible. Unity, j
based on mutual understanding, can '
be achieved ONLY when the "dis-1
senters," as all non-Catliolic Chris
tians are called, are ready to give up
any personal convictions in the mat
ter of religion. The Catholic Church
is to be recognized as the One Church, !
and the religious interpretations of
the Pope as the ONLY interpreta
tions that are true; others are not (
based on the REAL religion as it was
given to the Catholic Church alone —
at the time of St. Peter.
Such interpretations and dogmas
must be accepted in toto, without
question, and the supremacy of the !
Pope as the Prince of God, and his !
infallibility are all clearly defined.
Such unquestioning acceptance is a
condition requisite to unity of any
kind, and all "dissenters" must re
turn to the submission of the Roman
pontiff, and his divinely construed
doctrines.
An encyclical such as this, in our
day and age, seems the quintessence
of intolerance in a world which has
struggled more than four hundred
years for the right to interpret God
in the manner that each member of j
society chooses. The old Latin maxim i

of "de gustibus non disputantum est"
is, and has been, one of universal ap
plication since man first began to do
liis own thinking—instead of having
it done by proxy. The right of a man
to follow the dictates of his own rea
son and conscience in the selection of
a faith which answers his personal
needs has become axiomatic; so, in
this era, when universal emancipa
tion in thought, and unity in the
fundamental conceptions of good are
sought, it is a "bolt from the blue" to
have an encyclical such as this cast
in the teeth of the world.
It denies the right to question ac
cepted beliefs, and points the ONE
route to heaven—whatever that may
be —as passing through the Catholic
Church, and by way of its dogmas. It
denies the truth or potency of any
other faiths or beliefs. Such a sweep
ing generalization smacks of the days
before Luther and Calvin, and recalls
the burning of Savonarola and Bruno
for their impertainence in daring to
think for themselves —and let anyone
KNOW about it.
All this seems quite contrary to
the present desire for harmony and
brotherhood, and to the encourage
ment of the search for Good and
Truth —WHEREVER they may be
found.
It seems to me that Harry Romaina
has struck close to the heart of truth
where he says in "Ad Coelum,"
At the Muezzin's call for prayer,
The kneeling faithful thronged the
snuare.
And on Pushkara's lofty height
The dark priest chanted Brahma's
might.
An old Franciscan told his beads;
While to the synagogue there came
A Jew, to praise Jehova's name.
And the One great God looked down
and smiled,
And counted each His loving child;
For Turk and Brahmin, monk and
Jew
Had reached Him through the gods
they knew.

years for the right to interpret God
in the manner that each member of j
society chooses. The old Latin maxim i

of "de gustibus non disputantum est"
is, and has been, one of universal ap
plication since man first began to do
liis own thinking—instead of having
it done by proxy. The right of a man
to follow the dictates of his own rea
son and conscience in the selection of
a faith which answers his personal
needs has become axiomatic; so, in
this era, when universal emancipa
tion in thought, and unity in the
fundamental conceptions of good are
sought, it is a "bolt from the blue" to
have an encyclical such as this cast
in the teeth of the world.
It denies the right to question ac
cepted beliefs, and points the ONE
route to heaven—whatever that may
be —as passing through the Catholic
Church, and by way of its dogmas. It
denies the truth or potency of any
other faiths or beliefs. Such a sweep
ing generalization smacks of the days
before Luther and Calvin, and recalls
the burning of Savonarola and Bruno
for their impertainence in daring to
think for themselves —and let anyone
KNOW about it.
All this seems quite contrary to
the present desire for harmony and
brotherhood, and to the encourage
ment of the search for Good and
Truth —WHEREVER they may be
found.
It seems to me that Harry Romaina
has struck close to the heart of truth
where he says in "Ad Coelum,"
At the Muezzin's call for prayer,
The kneeling faithful thronged the
snuare.
And on Pushkara's lofty height
The dark priest chanted Brahma's
might.
An old Franciscan told his beads;
While to the synagogue there came
A Jew, to praise Jehova's name.
And the One great God looked down
and smiled,
And counted each His loving child;
For Turk and Brahmin, monk and
Jew
Had reached Him through the gods
they knew.
IT SEEMS TO ME—
That the recent encyclical of Pope j
Pius XI is one of the most reactionary |
documents and statements of religious i
policy of the last century. It may be
recalled that an "encyclical" is a cir
cular, or open letter, published by the
Pope, regarding affairs and policies <
of the Catholic Church. This particu- j
lar document was issued by the j
pontiff at Rome in response to the !
present movement toward some pos
sible mutual understanding and unity
among the Christian churches of the [
world. The declared stand of the Catli-1
olic Church has banished forever such J
a possibility.
It declares, in substance, that any ;
compromise is impossible. Unity, j
based on mutual understanding, can '
be achieved ONLY when the "dis-1
senters," as all non-Catliolic Chris
tians are called, are ready to give up
any personal convictions in the mat
ter of religion. The Catholic Church
is to be recognized as the One Church, !
and the religious interpretations of
the Pope as the ONLY interpreta
tions that are true; others are not (
based on the REAL religion as it was
given to the Catholic Church alone —
at the time of St. Peter.
Such interpretations and dogmas
must be accepted in toto, without
question, and the supremacy of the !
Pope as the Prince of God, and his !
infallibility are all clearly defined.
Such unquestioning acceptance is a
condition requisite to unity of any
kind, and all "dissenters" must re
turn to the submission of the Roman
pontiff, and his divinely construed
doctrines.
An encyclical such as this, in our
day and age, seems the quintessence
of intolerance in a world which has
struggled more than four hundred
years for the right to interpret God
in the manner that each member of j
society chooses. The old Latin maxim i
