(Installment Three)
A door creaked ominously. "Quick,
Sally, Die papers."
"What papers?"
"Any papers," said Roger annoyed.
"I won't play if we can't have papers."
Roger stalked stiF'y into the closet
When he came out his jaw was firmly
set. In his arms he carried a strong
box, which he set down upon the
table with such force that the top
flow open.
Sally gave a tintinnabulating laugh.
"Ah. Pandora's box!" she twittered j
gaily. Roger frowned darkly. "Thij is ;
no time for mirth, woman," ho |
crunched out, examining the papers I
\vhich spewed forth from the box.
"My Gawd, Sally, the papers are j
written in invisible ink and Mike the j
Mutt may be upon us any minute." j
Roger and Sally turned instinctively i
toward the door.
Framed in the dark mouth of the [
trapdoor were the blasted features of \
Mike the Mutt. Roger's lips curled in |
answer to the sneering challenge of
the Mutt's eyes. Sally clutched her
throat in dismay, stifling the half
formed cry in her soft, round throat.
Catlike, Mike the Mutt leaped into
the room brandishing a hugo razor.
From among the silent dead at
Roger's feet there was a stir. A
slight figure rose wearily, holding
aloft something that made the Mutt
stop short
