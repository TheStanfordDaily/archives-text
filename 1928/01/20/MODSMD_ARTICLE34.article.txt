People judge people by the
things they do, I mean one's ex
periences count a lot. A boy told
me the other day the way the
roughs on the campus got the low
down on a girl is to watch what
she does when she feels everyone
looking at her. But I told him he
should say high-up, and no nice
girl would put herself in a posi
tion where everyone would be
looking at her.
That is to say, we girls do like
notoriety but not reputations.
And I really think that a girl who
can't be known for what she
stands for is not worth knowing
at all.
Whenever I get serious-minded,
which is quite often, because that
is a college ideal, 112 always think
of the poor little girls who can't
go to college to get cultured.
I think that this campus offers
so many opportunities for a girl
to grow. The conditions are so
healthful, and the competition is
so small, it really is wonderful, !
mean it actually is.
And one of the most impressive
things to me is the way the cam
pus men allow the girls to do just
what they like. That is, they
never interfere by wasting time
with them. And wasting time is
the bane of a university, because
it accomplishes so much in the
wrong direction, if you know what
I mean.
