# POINCARE'S STRENGTH PROVED ONCE AGAIN BY DEPUTIES' VOTE
## Solons Provide for One Year Of Military Service in Army Compromise 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 19.â€”Premier Raymond
Poincare's strength lias been put to its
second test within a week, and for the
second time he has shown himself power
ful enough to resist efforts to overthrow
him.
He went to the Chamber of Deputies
today for a vote of confidence 011 the
question of one-year military service,
which threatened to bring about his resig
nation. The deputies, however, voted 332
to 181 for the one-year rule.
The government's victory on a ques
tion which is dangerous, especially in
view of the forthcoming general elections,
was the result of a compromise reached
Wednesday night when Poincare and
Minister of War Paul Painleve appeared
before the Army Commission and worked
out a plan whereby the one-year military
service rule would become effective 111
1930, "if military conditions make it ne
cessary."
Further Confidence Votes
Before the day was over, the Chamber
gave Poincare three more votes of confi
dence by defeating Socialist and Commun
ist amendments to the military servicc
program.
A week ago Poincare appeared before
the deputies and demanded the arrest of
five Communist members of Parliament
who had been charged with subversive
activities. The Premier won by a close
vote.
