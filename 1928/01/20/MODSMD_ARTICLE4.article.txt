Delta Chi's cagers staged a last minute
rally, in the first of last night's intramural
basketball games played at Encina Gym,
to beat Zeta Psi 15 to 6. Until the final
few moments of the last quarter the
score stood six all. Neither faction had
been able to sink shots with any accuracy,
keeping the ball near the center of the
floor most of the time. The Delta Chis,
however, rallied against the Zetes' play,
and slipped through enough field goals to
comfortably cinch the game. Paxton was
the mainstay for the winners, and Sibbct
stood out for the Zetes.
Encina 412 beat El Campo Club 12 to 4.
The contest very nearly copped first place
as being the dullest on record with the

the second half. Worsley starred for the
freshmen by scoring six points. Holt was
the big man of El Campo's organization.
The Japanese Club five fell before the
All Black squad 19 to 6 in a game which
was not as one sided as the score indi
cates. The winners led at the half by six
points. Nourse of the All Blacks headed
his team's scorers by registering 6 points.
Murata was star of the contest by mak
ing all his team's tallies with beautiful
shots from difficult angles.
In the first and fastest game in the
Pavilion, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon hoops
ters downed the Encina 5 basketeers by
a 16-11 score. I'igelow starred, tallying
the most buckets for the fraternity five.
Sequoia I defeated Encina 3W by a 21-
16 count. The freshmen made a valiant
attempt at the lead in the finish of the
game, but the Sequoia men maintained
their margin. Eberhart starred for the
losers.
