# SPORTS OF 1928

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Add the name of Steve Hamas to
the long list of versatile athletes —a
list that includes Jim Thorpe, Ernie
Nevers, Sam White, Eric Pedley,
Hobey Baker, Devereux Milburn, For
rester Clark, and many others.
Hamas is a junior at Penn State Col
lege, and believe me, he is the most
lion-like of any of the Nittany Lions.
Fullback on the varsity eleven, for
ward on the basketball team, and
heavyweight boxing champion of his
alma mater. Also, he dabbles in base
ball, lacrosse, and track, or what have
you? That's Steve Hamas of Penn
State, and for all I know, he may be
a chess champion and a golfer of
parts as well.
See what Steve did in football last
season? Specializing as a line-crack
ing fullback, he fooled Chick Mee
han's New York University Violets by
passing and later running 46 yards
around their right end. On October 15
lie scored the first touchdown that the
Lions had made against Penn since

1923. While not as spectacular as his
captain, Roepke, he fitted well into
I Coach Bezdek's backfield of Lundgren,
Roepke, and Wolff, and was a consist
ent ground-gainer in nearly every
game.
Steve's brother Mike was a member
of the first Passaic, N.J., high school
"wonder team" when their long win
ning streak in basketball was started.
Steve went to East Rutherford, N.J.,
before entering State College. There
are three more brothers in the Hamas
family, John, George, and Andy, and
; the five boys form a very fraternal
| court team which lias held the ama
j teur championship of their section of
j New Jersey.
