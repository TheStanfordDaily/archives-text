# ART GALLERY SHOWS TWO EXHIBITIONS OF CARMEL LANDSCAPES
## 
### 
Two new exhibitions will be pre
sented in the Stanford Art Gallery
Sunday. The first is an exhibition of
paintings by M. De Neale Morgan of
the wind-swept California skies and
seas so well known to those who are
acquainted with Carmel landscapes.
The second exhibition is the showing
of two artists' work, E. Grace Ward,
and Edith Ward Hunt. All three of
these artists are at present living at
Carmel so their work reflects the
solemn grandeur and splendid
strength of the Monterey coast.
De Neale Morgan is one of the
very best painters of Carmel. Her
canvases are mostly landscapes and
are broadly expressive of California
scenes.
Pedro Lemos, director of the Stan
ford Art Gallery, says of her work:
"Painted broadly, still faithful in
value and color with a vigor and spar
kle, Miss Morgan's pictures delight
both the artist and the layman."
Eleanor Taylor Houghton, in the
Overland Monthly, says: "Many peo
ple paint Carmel each to his or her
own way. No one has achieved more
individuality of interpretation than
De Neale Morgan has. She is pre
eminently decorative and her can
vasses have unmistakable depth and
perspective."
The other two artists include water
colors, oils, charcoals, and wall hang
ings in their exhibition. One of the
women, E. Grace Ward, is a Stanford
graduate of the class of 1902. She was
a Graphic Art major while she at
tended the University.
