# REVISED CAMPUS MAP APPEARS IN BAWLOUT FOR WINTER QUARTER
## 
### 
A revised edition of the map of
the campus and adjacent territory,
which appears in official publications
of the University, came out for the
first time in the new "Bawlout." This
is the first revision since 1923. The
work of re-checking was done by the
Engineering Department.
The chief change is the location of
several new streets in the faculty dis
trict behind the reservoir hill. The
new Physical Education building i's
shown for the first, time, as well as
the Ryan Laboratory.
Street car tracks on University
avenue and Waverley street and from
the Bookstore to the old Roble sta
tion were the only marks eliminated.
