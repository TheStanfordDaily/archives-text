# PAGE TO LECTURE ON FOREIGN POLICY IN TALK TOMORROW
## Authority Says Sovereignty Idea Is Chief Barrier To World Peace 
### 
"The chief barrier to peace is the
idea of sovereignty. Nations today in
sist on this doctrine and the people
believe in its maintenance because
national sovereignty seems to be the
only way to secure justice."
Such is the declaration made by
Kirby Page, who will lecture in the
Assembly Hall at 7:30 o'clock tomor
row evening, when he spoke here two
years ago.
Page, who is editor of "The World
Tomorrow," and a promoter of inter
national peace, declares, "In order to
realize world peace we must widen
the area of good will so that law and
orderly government may transcend
national boundaries and include all
humanity.'"
He believes it is essential to edu
cate the public to believe that inter
national agreements can be enforced
and to create public opinion which
will lead to agencies for justice.
At present Page is giving a series
of lectures on the coast before several
university audiences. He will speak
on"A Constructive Foreign Policy"
tomorrow night.
