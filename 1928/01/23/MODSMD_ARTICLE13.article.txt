# CARDINAL RELAY TEAM SETS NEW RECORD IN PRACTICE SWIM RACE
## 
### 
Two relay teams will carry Stan
ford's colors to the national intercol
legiate and the Olympic Games swim
ming meets, is the prediction based
on the times released yesterday by
Coach Ernst Brandsten.
Racing in the slow Encina pool,
and with only early season form, Har
rison, Driggs, and Ophuls have un
officially clipped 4-5 of a second from
the national intercollegiate 300-yard
medley record of 3:24 4-5.
The Cardinal four-man relay team
—Harrison, Van den Akker, Bramel,
and Driggs—has been clocked at 3:50
flat for 400 yards. This time, consider
ably better than any obtained in years
by Stanford teams, is bound to im»
prove as the season progresses,
Brandsten claims, and will probably
result in one more title for a Stanford
team.
