# Wilbur Reaches End Of Twelfth Year In Position
## 
### Calvin Wood 
Outstanding in the growth of the
University during the past twelve
years, since the inauguration of Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur as president, is
the position Stanford has taken na
tionally. Recognition of this is evi
denced by the increasing number of
gifts received for the endowment and
development of the University. Yes
terday marked the twelfth anniver
sary of President Wilbur's taking of
fice.
Among the larger gifts to the in
stitution are the $700,000 given by the
Carnegie corporation, the $300,000
given by the Board of Education, the
sums given by various electrical and
power manufacturing companies to
ward the establishment of the Ryan
Electrical Laboratory, and the $195,-
000 given to establish the Daniel Gug
genheim Experimental Laboratory of
Aerodynamic and Aeronautic Engi
neering.
Stanford has seen change in the
construction of many new buildings,
the establishment of new entrance
and scholarship requirements, the re
organization of undergraduate instruc
tion, increase in enrollment, adoption
of the honor system, creation of the
four quarter system, and the installa
tion of new departments.
In the last twelve years the Li
brary, the Art Gallery, Roble, Toyon,
and Branner halls, homes for Dr. Jor
dan and President Wilbur, the Sta
dium, the Convalescent Home, the
Ryan and the Guggenheim Labora
tories, the Hopkins Marine Station at
Pacific Grove, the Stanford Hospital
•in Snn Francisco and the Stanford
School of Nursing have all been made
a part of the University.
Of especial note is the Hoover War
Library. There is but one other such
institution in existence. Constant ad
ditions have been made to the li-
Jibraries of the various schools and
departments.
Of recent date is the adoption of
the Independent Study Plan.
Another innovation is further limi
tation and perhaps abolition of the
Lower Division. By the Board of Trus
tees resolution last October the num
ber of entering new students in the
first two years has been limited to
350, though no further statement was
made at that time of total abolition.

ber of entering new students in the
first two years has been limited to
350, though no further statement was
made at that time of total abolition.
Outstanding in the growth of the
University during the past twelve
years, since the inauguration of Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur as president, is
the position Stanford has taken na
tionally. Recognition of this is evi
denced by the increasing number of
gifts received for the endowment and
development of the University. Yes
terday marked the twelfth anniver
sary of President Wilbur's taking of
fice.
Among the larger gifts to the in
stitution are the $700,000 given by the
Carnegie corporation, the $300,000
given by the Board of Education, the
sums given by various electrical and
power manufacturing companies to
ward the establishment of the Ryan
Electrical Laboratory, and the $195,-
000 given to establish the Daniel Gug
genheim Experimental Laboratory of
Aerodynamic and Aeronautic Engi
neering.
Stanford has seen change in the
construction of many new buildings,
the establishment of new entrance
and scholarship requirements, the re
organization of undergraduate instruc
tion, increase in enrollment, adoption
of the honor system, creation of the
four quarter system, and the installa
tion of new departments.
In the last twelve years the Li
brary, the Art Gallery, Roble, Toyon,
and Branner halls, homes for Dr. Jor
dan and President Wilbur, the Sta
dium, the Convalescent Home, the
Ryan and the Guggenheim Labora
tories, the Hopkins Marine Station at
Pacific Grove, the Stanford Hospital
•in Snn Francisco and the Stanford
School of Nursing have all been made
a part of the University.
Of especial note is the Hoover War
Library. There is but one other such
institution in existence. Constant ad
ditions have been made to the li-
Jibraries of the various schools and
departments.
Of recent date is the adoption of
the Independent Study Plan.
Another innovation is further limi
tation and perhaps abolition of the
Lower Division. By the Board of Trus
tees resolution last October the num
ber of entering new students in the
first two years has been limited to
350, though no further statement was
made at that time of total abolition.
