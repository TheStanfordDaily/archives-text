# FIRST ROUND MURAL TENNIS MATCH PLAY TO START TOMORROW
## 
### 
First-round matches in the intra
mural tennis tournament will be
played tomorrow afternoon on the old
and new men's courts. The schedule
is posted on the Encina gym bulletin
board today.
There are about twenty-five teams
entered in the play, which will be run
off on Tuesday and Thursday after
noons and on Saturday by arrange
ment. Each team, consisting of two
men, will play two singles and one
doubles.
The winners of the matches will
progress to the semi-finals in which
the remaining four teams will play
for the first four places. The losers
of the first-round matches will not be
entirely eliminated, however. A tour
nament has been arranged in which
they will play for fifth place which
will count one point toward the year's
intramural championship.
All matches are scheduled so that
the tournament will be over within
two weeks if the weather is favorable.
If rain necessitates the calling off of
the matches for the day they will be
run off on the following day.
