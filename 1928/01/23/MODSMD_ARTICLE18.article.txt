LOS ANGELES, Jan. 21.—Display
ing a whirlwind attack in the last
half, the Cardinal basketball team
wiped out an eleven-point lead the
Bruins had run up during the first
half, and defeated Caddy Work's
cagers 34 to 27 here tonight.
At half time the U.C.L.A. team led
the Redshirts 24 to 13, which looked
like a safe margin over the Cardinals,
whom they defeated twice on the
Stanford court. At the start of the
second half, Coach Hunt sent in the
combination which had given Santa
Clara such a close race in the last
few minutes of play—Smalling at cen
ter with Cook and Richards at for
wards. *
This combination proceeded to out
play and outshoot the Southern stars,
and much to the surprise of everyone,
were leading 26 to 25 before the end
of the half. While the Bruin cagers
were recovering from their surprise,
the Cards scored six more point? to
give them a safe lead. In the last
three minutes of play Work's men
staged a short rally when Ketchum
shot a field goal, which accounted for
two of the three points the Bruins
scored in this half, as against twenty
for the Cardinals.
Smalling was star scorer in this
half, sinking five field goals for a
total of ten points. Richards and Cook
had an equal share in the victory,
feeding Smalling and scoring seven
