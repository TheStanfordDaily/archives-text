# DR. GARDNER GIVES SUMMARY OF WORK OF CAMPUS CHAPEL
## 
### 
Summarizing the work of the Stan
ford Memorial Church for the past
quarter of a century, Dr. D. Charles
Gardner said yesterday in his twenty
fifth anniversary sermon, "We have
done nothing daring, spectacular, or
sensational. We have started no cru
sades. We have not even ventured a
revival, though many need conver
sion. What have we done? We have
done day by day an honest day's
work; we have based our work on
simple methods; we have not mechan
ized the Church by elaborate organiza
tion; we have taught the truths of
religion and morality faithfully and
fearlessly; we have tried to adminis
ter not only to the pious, but also to
the lonely, the sick, the shameful, and
the sad."
Dr. Gardner also touched on the
many questions that present them
selves to students in their search for
a philosophy of life. "All these ques
tions need answer, and our University
life will never be complete until we
have a School of Religion to match
our Scientific Schools, our Law
School, our School of Engineering."
Tribute to Dr. David Starr Jordan
was paid. "His serene faith in days
of turmoil and tempest, his loyal de
votion, never failed. He may have felt
critical about things, but he never
interfered. His theology may be
poetry, but it is steeped in love. A
pillar of the Church, his gracious life
and constant presence at our services
have ben a godly example."
