# JULIA NORTH TO PLAY ROLE OF VAMPIRE IN MASQUERS OFFERING
## Mullin Has Part of Mario; All But One of Cast Are Selected 
### 
Julia North will play the part of
Amalia, in the "Romantic Young
Lady," the Masquers play, on Febru
ary 10, making another addition to
the list of familiar names of this cast.
She has played in a number of foot
ball shows, the part of the mother in
"The Goose Hangs High," the French
maid in "Wicked William," and the
role of Melissa in "Princess Ida."
Amalia is the "vampire" role in the
"Romantic Young Lady," providing
a contrast to Rosario, the romantic
young lady herself.
Paul Pfaff is one of the new un
familiar actors in the cast. Pi'aff is a
new student, a transfer from San
Diego State College, and has had a
variety of experience. At San Diego
he played a number of widely differ
ing parts, such as Captain Bluntichli
in "Arms and the Man," the popular
Shaw play, Jim, in "Little Journey,"
Gringane in "The Ballad Monger,"
Aguecheek in "Twelfth Night," and
the tramp in "Shake, Bo."
Mario, played by Stanley Mullin, is
another part with a familiar star.
Mullin was in the cast of "John Fer
guson," in the last Football Gaieties,
and appeared as Taliaferro in "Ex
pressing Willie," the sophomore com
edy.
With the exception of one minor
part, the cast has now been filled. Re
hearsals have begun, and the first
shaping-up of the play is under way.
"The Romantic Young Lady" offers
some interesting possibilities in the
technical production, since although
the setting is Spanish, it is thoroughly
modern.
