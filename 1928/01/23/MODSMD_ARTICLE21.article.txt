# LOS ARCOS CAGE FIVE FALLS BEFORE SPEED OF ALPHA TAU OMEGA
## 
### 
Alpha Tau Omega 17, Los Arcos 10
Phi Gamma Delta 16, Junipero
Serra 2
Alpha Tau Omega's cagers came
through in the last half to beat Los
Arcos Club 17 to 10 in the first of
the intramural games played at En
cina Gym on Friday afternoon. The
score stood at five-all at half time,
neither team being able to play much
more than keep-away. The fraternity
men, however, developed speed and
a dead-eye accuracy in the last two
periods, and won comfortably. Jost
did nice work for the A.T.O.'s, and
Creveling was outstanding on the Los
Arcos five.
In the second tilt, Phi Gamma
Delta took a 16 to 2 victory over the
Junipero Serra five. Nearly white
washing the losers, the fraternity
team swept them from the floor in
the first half. It was not till nearly
the end of the game that the Junipero
men could score.
Klotz, flashy forward, led the win
ners in scoring, making ten of their
points. Downing and Hunter came
close behind in breaking through the
weak Junipero defense.
