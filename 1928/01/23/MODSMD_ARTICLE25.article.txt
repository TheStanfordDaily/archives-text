# A 						Dozen Years

Yesterday marked the twelfth anniversary of Ray Lyman Wilbur's
taking- office as President of Stanford University. In the span of years
since his assumption of the title Stanford has steadily forged ahead on a
program ambitious in its scope and its aim. Due recognition of the
University's progress has been accorded by gifts totalling millions from
Foundations and interested individuals. The construction of many Uni
versity buildings has marked the time since January 22, 1916.
To the students here today it is hard to visualize the evidences of
expansion and growth that have been brought forth in these twelve years.
The Library, Art Gallery, Roble, Brainier, and Toyon halls, the Ryan and
Guggenheim Laboratories, and the President's home have all been erected
in this period. Much of this growth has been due to the University itself,
receiving benefits from those interested in the institution for itself. The
proper direction and guidance of those benefits, however, is due to the able
hand of Stanford's chief executive.
Along- certain lines the future promises a smooth and continued
progress of the University's growth. The addition of increased educa
tional facilities, the development of special schools and buildings are
things ahead. In fact, a concrete program for expansion has already
been outlined (Illustrated Review, December, 1927) which needs a sum
in the neighborhood of eighty millions or more for its fulfillment. The
next twelve years will see Stanford moving ahead in as rapid a manner as
it has in the past dozen years.
