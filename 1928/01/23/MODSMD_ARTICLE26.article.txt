Dr. Teltzer, the German runner, was here and is gone. lie proved
himself an attractive guest and conducted himself as a champion while he
was at Stanford.
As one talked to him after lie had raced against—and lost to —Captain
Bud Spencer and watched his undeniably handsome countenance light up
as with effort he comprehended an English phrase, the thought struck
one forcibly that not long ago Stanford men were engaged in the wrong
kind of competition with men like Dr. Peltzer.
Since this summer's Olympic Games will be the first since the War
that Germany has been allowed to participate in, Dr. Peltzer's significant
visit here makes us hope the more fervently that there won't be another
occasion again to interrupt the wholesome sort of strife the Olympics
provide every four years to offset the lust for conflict in battle.
