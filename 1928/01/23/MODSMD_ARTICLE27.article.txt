# Subtracting Salt Water

Tonight, fresh from the victory over U.C.L.A., Stanford's basketball
team meets Waseda University in one of those international tilts which
characterize athletic competition on the Coast. Coast athletes, be they
of the Japanese or American shorelines, are wont to follow the Navy's
slogan of seeing the world. Stanford teams have traveled to Japan, China,
and Australia. California teams, too, have crossed the western pond with
pleasing regularity. Japan reciprocates once more this evening.
If a McGill-Princeton ice hockey game merits being called an "inter
national tilt" back East, what would tonight's Stanford-Waseda game be
called ?
