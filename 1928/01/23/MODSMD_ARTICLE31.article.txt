"I WONDER WHAT'S BECOME
OF SALLY?"
The Sally case continues to be one
of the seven wonders of San Fran- !
cisco.
Lights np, please, the morons have |
the center of the stage.
At the risk of permanent contami
nation we would make a few reflec
tions. The first tear falls for the press, !
which, reeling in the sensational orgy,
has gone clear out of its head. The
trash written, printed, and eaten alive
by a morbid public, establishes what
we can almost believe to be a new
low level in journalism. Witness:
"A hush came to the courtroom as
Sally covered her face with her slen
der hands, a diamond glittering upon
one of them, and sobbed: 'It's a lie!
It's a lie.!
"Writing roughly and quickly, one
would say that Sally shrieked or
moaned, or sobbed. But writing sensi
tively and slowly, one might go so
far as to dig up Browning, the place
where Andrea Del Sarto speaks of
his beautiful wife's
'Perfect brow,
And perfect eyes, and more than per- [
feet mouth,
And the low voice my soul hears, as
a bird
The fowler's pipe, and follows to the
snare.'
"Well, YOU (sic) know, a fellow
hates to hear a kid cry that way."
MANY INTERVIEWS
And on and on. The fair Sally is '
interviewed on religion, sociology, and
what not. Her every expression is
carefully photographed and repro-1
duced in lurid pink. When all pos- \
sible is obtained from Sally, the sob- J
story writers bring in the relatives.
Again we are indebted to the inimi
table press:
"Behold the mother!
"People ask: 'What is the mother

I of Sally Whitcomb like? Didn't she
know her daughter was flitting about
nights in a cafe-ridden maze, drink
! inq, dancing, flirting to the fill of her
ardent gay temperament?"'
And again:
"'l'll fix any one that tries to tam
per with my daughter's name!' she
vows, wildly."
There is still one phase, more hope
less still. As usual, the courtroom has
been besieged by mobs of spectators.
Order has been maintained with dif
ficulty and a great many have been
; turned away unable to find even
standing room. We shed a second
j tear. ,
HOLD YOUR SEAT
"The court is crowded with women,
many of whom bring their lunches
I and cling to their seats during the
full day's session." Picture one of
; this specie of moron fighting and el
j bowing for a place in line, and once
| in the courtroom fiercely holding onto
her chair. She is bent forward, tense
and eager to catch each word, each
I sordid detail. As no honor exists
I among seat-snatchers, she brings her
j lunch —and clings to the free seat in
| the great free show provided by the
I great freedom-loving state. Picture
! her munching soggy sandwiches and
j biting at sour Ynckles, leaving the
i crumbs, the ends of the pickles, and
I the paper on the floor. She does like
wise in the park. Both are free.
Sally, whatever your waywardness,
i real or alleged (We seek to pass no
judgment here), your soul is pale and
wistful in comparison to these street
| sweepers of life. Anyhow, Sally, at
1 least you have the courage to live,
■ while they, without the virility or
J ability to have adventures of their
; own, must compensate, live vicari
ously by crowding in to stare at you.
A tliird tear and a question: Which
way, civilization, backward or for
i ward? —Jack Springer.

"Behold the mother!
"People ask: 'What is the mother

I of Sally Whitcomb like? Didn't she
know her daughter was flitting about
nights in a cafe-ridden maze, drink
! inq, dancing, flirting to the fill of her
ardent gay temperament?"'
And again:
"'l'll fix any one that tries to tam
per with my daughter's name!' she
vows, wildly."
There is still one phase, more hope
less still. As usual, the courtroom has
been besieged by mobs of spectators.
Order has been maintained with dif
ficulty and a great many have been
; turned away unable to find even
standing room. We shed a second
j tear. ,
HOLD YOUR SEAT
"The court is crowded with women,
many of whom bring their lunches
I and cling to their seats during the
full day's session." Picture one of
; this specie of moron fighting and el
j bowing for a place in line, and once
| in the courtroom fiercely holding onto
her chair. She is bent forward, tense
and eager to catch each word, each
I sordid detail. As no honor exists
I among seat-snatchers, she brings her
j lunch —and clings to the free seat in
| the great free show provided by the
I great freedom-loving state. Picture
! her munching soggy sandwiches and
j biting at sour Ynckles, leaving the
i crumbs, the ends of the pickles, and
I the paper on the floor. She does like
wise in the park. Both are free.
Sally, whatever your waywardness,
i real or alleged (We seek to pass no
judgment here), your soul is pale and
wistful in comparison to these street
| sweepers of life. Anyhow, Sally, at
1 least you have the courage to live,
■ while they, without the virility or
J ability to have adventures of their
; own, must compensate, live vicari
ously by crowding in to stare at you.

way, civilization, backward or for

"I WONDER WHAT'S BECOME
OF SALLY?"
The Sally case continues to be one
of the seven wonders of San Fran- !
cisco.
Lights np, please, the morons have |
the center of the stage.
At the risk of permanent contami
nation we would make a few reflec
tions. The first tear falls for the press, !
which, reeling in the sensational orgy,
has gone clear out of its head. The
trash written, printed, and eaten alive
by a morbid public, establishes what
we can almost believe to be a new
low level in journalism. Witness:
"A hush came to the courtroom as
Sally covered her face with her slen
der hands, a diamond glittering upon
one of them, and sobbed: 'It's a lie!
It's a lie.!
"Writing roughly and quickly, one
would say that Sally shrieked or
moaned, or sobbed. But writing sensi
tively and slowly, one might go so
far as to dig up Browning, the place
where Andrea Del Sarto speaks of
his beautiful wife's
'Perfect brow,
And perfect eyes, and more than per- [
feet mouth,
And the low voice my soul hears, as
a bird
The fowler's pipe, and follows to the
snare.'
"Well, YOU (sic) know, a fellow
hates to hear a kid cry that way."
MANY INTERVIEWS
And on and on. The fair Sally is '
interviewed on religion, sociology, and
what not. Her every expression is
carefully photographed and repro-1
duced in lurid pink. When all pos- \
