# "BROADWAY"

,
In the completest sense, "Broad- j
way" is a great dramatic production,
every element in it is a true quality
of the theatre, a blaring, variegated
processional of Broadway life, push
ing impatiently through a private
room in the Paradise Night Club. !
How it moves! How many conflicting
destinies upset its mad rhythm!
When the cabaret "funny man"
changes his costume between appear
ances on the dancing floor and reveals j
the tattered condition of his dress j
shirt, we see for a fleeting moment!
■the reverse side of this glittering, be-'
J spangled life and understand some-!
thing of its flimsy quality. When;
one cabaret girl threatens to knock
off her partner's "block" or to knock
out her symmetrical "store teeth,"
j that incongruity also illuminates as
much as it amuses.
And Steve Crandall, the king boot
legger, the murderer, the seducer,
I fairly crackles with circumspection
from the beginning. The cast of
"Broadway" includes one disgruntled
cabaret manager, the vacant minded,
loud mouthed "hoofer," seven ill
tempered cabaret girls, an obese sing
er long past her prime, a slippery
mouthed waiter, a laconical police de- j
tective, and several gunmen and gan
sters.
All through the play, while the mur- j
derer of "Scar" Edwards is watching
his chances with the police and amus
ing himself with the cabaret ingenue, j
the entertainers rush on and off,
changing their costumes, jostling one!
another, wrangling and shouting in
sults as a matter of course. Outside
on tho cabaret floor, where the band
is accenting the atavistic tempo of
jazz music, there may be laughter and

amusement; but behind the closed
doors of the dressing rooms, where
the entertainers drop their profes
sional masks, a nervous, exhausted
contention keeps every one on edge.
In the last act, while the gunman lies
dead in the adjoining room, his career
thus definitely concluded, the "hoofer"
is brandishing about a vaudeville of
fer. And thus good fortune treads on
the heels of murder while the pace of
"Broadway" never falters. Regarded
objectively, it is romantic no less than
grim. Using the theatre as an instru
ment of expression, stimulating the
ear as well as the eye, the directors
thus create drama in the full meaning
of the word. And "Broadway" exhili
rates as only the theatre can in its
most vivid moments.
