# "THE COCONUTS"
## 
### 
New York's favorite quartet—the
inimitable Croucho, Harpo, Chico, and
Zeppo Marx —are showing San Fran
cisco the kind of a musical comedy
Broadway likes. They don't trouble
with much of a plot, but you overlook
the fragility of the story because the
stars themselves are so clever. Irving
Berlin wrote the music for the show,
some of the hits being "Why Do I
Want to Know Why?" "In a Bunga
low," and "Lucky Boy."
There are many pretty girls, a nura

ber of strikingly handsome sets, and
smart specialty artists to pacify the
audience when the Marx Brothers are
off-stage for a moment's rest. When
they're on it's just like a Sennett com-!
edy. Slapstick every moment, wise- 1
cracks galore.
Grouclio is Mr. Schlemmer, Florida
hotel proprietor and would-be real es
tate salesman. He wears a Chester;
Conklin mustache, huge rimmed glas-'
ses, and acts crazier than anyone
you've ever seen. Harpo, the red-wig
ged Silent Sam, says not one work
during the whole play. But his hilar
ious pantomiming provokes at least |
half of all the laughs. He surprises
by suddenly turning serious in one \
act and playing his harp very beauti
fully.
Chico is vulgarly comic as Willie
the Wop, and Zeppo appears more
serious than his three brothers as the
hotel clerk.
"The Coconuts" is one of the best
musical comedies of its type—the
kind where it all depends on the stars. !
You can depend on the four Marx;
Brothers to clown and caper to your j
heart's content.
