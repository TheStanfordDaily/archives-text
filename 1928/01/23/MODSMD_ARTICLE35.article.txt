MISSED IT
It is just our luck to have the
Stanford basketball varsity perform
as brilliantly as it did last Saturday
night against U.C.L.A. when it was
450 miles away from the Farm. Led i
by Chuck Smalling, who has recently [
looked as if he never would get his ;
shooting eye, the squad made twenty-'
one points during the hectic second
half against three for the Bruins to
close Ihe game in one of those Stan- \
ford Finishes you hear about at every
rally, but rarely see.
Apparently Husky Hunt started
Berg and Vincenti at forward
Saturday night, Clark at center,
and Rothert and Thompson at
guard. That all goes to show that
you can't tell what Husky will do
with a lineup. Last week it looked
as if Rothert would be the center I
from now on; and Smalling was
on the bench. But Smalling goes j
in for Clark in the second half
and steals the game away from
under the very noses of Jack
Ketchum and Woodroof of the
Southern team.
If Smalling can only hold his shoot
ing streak, Stanford may have a
chance this week against St. Ignatius
and the Olympic Club. The Cards are
favored to beat Waseda tonight.
Famous Last Words: Well, I
wonder how California is coming
along in its campaign for its fifth
consecutive basketball champion
ship?

ONE ON THE B.A.C.
The track team rather put one over
on the Board of Athletic Control last
Friday afternoon in the weekly
practice track meet on the old oval.
A number of the men upset calcula
tions and did feats which aren't
usually done until mid-season, when
the Board's ticket-selling machinery |

is in full motion. Zombro's 23 feet 9
inches in the broad jump, Edmonds'
13 feet in the pole vault, Krenz's 4G
feet 10 in the shot put and 144 feet 4
in the discus, Spencer's 50 1-5 in the
quarter, and Sparling's 185 feet 3 in
the javelin were phenomenal for
January.

Grantland Rice's moving pic
ture syndicate took shots of Spar
ling, Nichols, Lauritzen, and
Zombro last Saturday for the
Sportlight features. Sparling
combed his hair three times be
fore each appearance in front of
the lens, and Lauritzen, running
the hundred, almost lost his step
when one of his black locks fell
down over his forehead.
"I thought this was going to be
fun, but it's work," he finally
gasped, as he finished the race for
the fourth time, so that the
camera could get him from all
the desired angles.
