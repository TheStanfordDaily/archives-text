# INTELLIGENCE IS REAL ASSET OF JAPANESE; BELIEF OF ICHIHASHI

"Because of inadequate natural re
sources, Japan's only real asset is in
the intelligence of the people, and the
development of this intelligence is the
main aim of the government and the
people," declared Yamato Icliihashi,
Associate Professor of Japanese His
tory, before members of Encina Club
last evening. Professor Ichihashi
spoke to the Club under the auspices
of the Prosh "Y."
He added, "The Japanese stu
dent who completes his education in
America is at a decided disadvantage
when he returns to Japan, not because
of the quality of his education but
because of the prejudice or bias felt
against him. The home-product is fa
vored over the imported one, at least
until the latter has proven his worth."
