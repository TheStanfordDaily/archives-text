# VAN DUSEN STATES PEOPLE DO NOT LINK THOUGHTS, ACTIONS
## 
### 
"The trouble today is not in the
realm of thinking," declared Henry
Pitt Van Pusen at a Stanford Y.M.C.A.
and Y.W.C.A. luncheon yesterday."It
is in the fact that there is no connec
tion between the thinking we do with
our minds and the living we do with
our lives."
Van Dusen said that three things
dominate the thinking of the college
student: the scientific attitude, the
fact that everything must establish its
position in his conviction, and that
he does not link his thinking up with
his action. He is an expert in analy
sis, criticism, and description, but is
poverty-stricken when it comes to ap
preciation of beauty, friendship, or
worth.
