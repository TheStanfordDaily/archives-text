# EXPECT DISMISSAL OF JULIAN PETE CHARGES
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22.—(U.P.)—
Ruling on motion to dismiss indict
ments against three of the ten de
fendants in the Julian Petroleum Cor
poration case is expected to be hand
,ed down tomorrow as the trial goes
into its third week.
Dismissal was asked on grounds
jthat the District Attorney's office did
not have sufficient evidence to link
the trio with the $5,000,000-share
over-issue which brought about the
failure of the oil corporation.
