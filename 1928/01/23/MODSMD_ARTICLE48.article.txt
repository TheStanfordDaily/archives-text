# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The startling early-season performan
ces of Lloyd Hahn, America's premier
middle-distance runner, have given rise
to the hope that in the stout-hearted Ne
braskan this country has found a real
threat to Europe's superiority in the 800-
and 1500-meter races. Hahn has beaten
Wide, and Wide has beaten Nurmi. And
from the looks of things, Hahn stands a
fine chance of beating Douglas Lowe, of
England, the present Olympic 800-meter
champion, and Dr. Peltzer, the German,
who, in beating Lowe, set a world's rec
ord for 800 yards in 1926.
Lloyd Hahn competed in the 1924
Olympics at Paris, placing sixth in the
1500 meters, the race in which Paavo
Nurmi established a new Olympic record
of three minutes, fifty-three and six
tenths seconds. The phlegmatic Hahn
is out for a double win in his two favor
ite events, which correspond to our half
mile and mile distances. A. G. Hill, of
England, came out of obscurity in 1920
and won both the 800 and 1500 meter
races at Antwerp, but there were no
Lowes or Nurmis for him to beat in
either race. After seeing Hahn defeat
Wide last winter in that 4:12 1-5 mile,
easily one of the most exciting races I

have ever seen, I have a good hunch that
what Mel Sheppard did in 1908 and what
Hill did in 1920, Hahn can do in 1928.
Lloyd's feat of running an indoor half
mile in 1 minute 54 4-5 seconds in his
first race of the season, and after a lay
off of nearly ten months, speaks well of
the natural ability of the "Cornhusker
Comet," as well as of the astuteness of
Jack Ryder, his coach, who changed him
from a sprinter to a distance runner sev
eral yearS ago.

what Mel Sheppard did in 1908 and what
Hill did in 1920, Hahn can do in 1928.
Lloyd's feat of running an indoor half
mile in 1 minute 54 4-5 seconds in his
first race of the season, and after a lay
off of nearly ten months, speaks well of
the natural ability of the "Cornhusker
Comet," as well as of the astuteness of
Jack Ryder, his coach, who changed him
from a sprinter to a distance runner sev
eral yearS ago.
