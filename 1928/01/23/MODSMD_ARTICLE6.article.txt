# STANFORD FRESHMEN DOWN PACIEIC GROVE, GALILEO CAGE TEAMS
## Jim Mears, Yearling Center, Is High-Point Man in Both Victories 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team advanced two steps nearer the
end of their schedule during the
week-end with their record still un
marred by defeat, scoring a victory
over Galileo High School by a score
of 17 to 10 Friday night and another
over Pacific Grove High 34 to 19 Sat
urday night.
In neither game did the bab6s dis
play the form and speed that was so
clearly noticeable in their early-sea
son contests, passing inaccurately
and playing a slower game than the
members of both opposing teams. Jim
Mears, freshman center, was high
point man of both contests with 7
points against Galileo and 9 against
Pacific Grove.
In Friday night's game the Cardi
nals' lead over their opponents was
never great enough to permit the use
of many substitutes, as a result of
which Hawkins was the only second
string player to see action. Reynolds
and Tampcke, although facing a par
ticularly strong offense, played their
usual steady game in the defense
positions. Paige, with 4 points, was
high-point man for Galileo.
The first half of the Pacific Grove
game was fairly close, ending at 16
to 9 in the babes' favor. In the second
period, .however ,the Cardinal quintet
came to life and ran away from
their lighter opponents. In this con
test, Hepp, a former guard who was
recently shifted to the forward posi
tion, started with Moffatt instead of
Joujon-Roche in that position.
This week the freshmen will clash
with three more high-school quintets.
These are Stockton High School,
Wednesday night, Berkeley High, Fri
day, and Santa Cruz High, Saturday.
