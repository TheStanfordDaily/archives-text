# CARDINAL TRACKMEN MAKE HIGH RECORDS IN PRACTICE CONTEST
## Spencer Defeats Peltzer in Record Time; Edmonds Vaults 13 Feet 
### 
Cardinal trackmen set up records
that were little less than startling for
this time of the year in the regular
weekly meet last Friday. These rec
ords indicate that Coach Templeton
has a capable man to fill every gap
left by graduation last year.
Captain Bud Spencer raced through
the 440 to beat Dr. Otto Peltzer, fam
ous German runner, in the fast time
of 50 1-5 seconds. This is a sensa
tional time for early season, and in
dicates that the Stanford captain
should have another banner year.
Krenz Shows Ability
Eric Krenz showed that he will
fill the vacancy left by Biff Hoffman
in a capable manner. He tossed the
discus 144 feet 4 inches and put the
shot 46 feet 10 inches. The Stockton
giant is a consistent performer and
always proves strongest in competi
tion.
A1 Forster, Stewart Way, and Herb
Fleishhacker, are three shot-ptters
that are not far behind Krenz and will
push him in every meet. Forster is
the best possibility of the three at
present.
Broad Jumpers Strong
Stanford will have another strong
trio of broad jumpers. Fred Zombro
made a sensational jump of 23 feet
9 inches, being followed by Kim Dyer,
22 feet 5 inches, and John Lauritzen,
21 feet 11 inches.
Bill Sparling's throw of 185 feet 3
inches in the javelin was outstanding
for this time of year. Goodcell fol
lowed with 172 feet. With Tom Joe
qin, who has thrown over 200 feet in
competition, the Cardinal spear
tossers will collect points against any
team.
Edmonds Sensational
Ward Edmonds, who topped 13 feet
6 inches last year, proved that he is
in good condition by vaulting 13 feet.
Hulsman and Mainwaring both topped
11 feet 6 inches.
Don Nelson, liurler, proved that he
is varsity material by winning the
low hurdles in 25:4. Nichols won the
highs in 15:2. Lauritzen took a first
in the hundred at 10:1.

9 inches, being followed by Kim Dyer,
22 feet 5 inches, and John Lauritzen,
21 feet 11 inches.
Bill Sparling's throw of 185 feet 3
inches in the javelin was outstanding
for this time of year. Goodcell fol
lowed with 172 feet. With Tom Joe
qin, who has thrown over 200 feet in
competition, the Cardinal spear
tossers will collect points against any
team.
Edmonds Sensational
Ward Edmonds, who topped 13 feet
6 inches last year, proved that he is
in good condition by vaulting 13 feet.
Hulsman and Mainwaring both topped
11 feet 6 inches.
Don Nelson, liurler, proved that he
is varsity material by winning the
low hurdles in 25:4. Nichols won the
highs in 15:2. Lauritzen took a first
in the hundred at 10:1.
Cardinal trackmen set up records
that were little less than startling for
this time of the year in the regular
weekly meet last Friday. These rec
ords indicate that Coach Templeton
has a capable man to fill every gap
left by graduation last year.
Captain Bud Spencer raced through
the 440 to beat Dr. Otto Peltzer, fam
ous German runner, in the fast time
of 50 1-5 seconds. This is a sensa
tional time for early season, and in
dicates that the Stanford captain
should have another banner year.
Krenz Shows Ability
Eric Krenz showed that he will
fill the vacancy left by Biff Hoffman
in a capable manner. He tossed the
discus 144 feet 4 inches and put the
shot 46 feet 10 inches. The Stockton
giant is a consistent performer and
always proves strongest in competi
tion.
A1 Forster, Stewart Way, and Herb
Fleishhacker, are three shot-ptters
that are not far behind Krenz and will
push him in every meet. Forster is
the best possibility of the three at
present.
Broad Jumpers Strong
Stanford will have another strong
trio of broad jumpers. Fred Zombro
made a sensational jump of 23 feet
9 inches, being followed by Kim Dyer,
22 feet 5 inches, and John Lauritzen,
21 feet 11 inches.
Bill Sparling's throw of 185 feet 3
