(FINDS REWARD IN THE
'Bond Business
IN deciding upon a business to follow, college men are likely
to be unduly influenced by their observations of the suc
cess —or lack of success —of others, particularly acquaint
ances, in various lines.
But that is not a sound method of deciding for or against a
line of business to follow. Instead, study the nature of the
business, its relative importance in the economic structure,
and its requirements. Then consider how it fits your own in
clinations and abilities.
1 The right man, with the right house, can always do well in
the bond business. But it is as important that the bond house 9
should discriminate in the selection of men as that men
should choose carefully the house they work for. Both lose
by experimenting.
Each new man added to our staff is chosen carefully and is
then helped over the critical period of beginning, by full-time
instruction in our training school. This makes him competent
to satisfy a clientele on a service basis, promotes his worth to
the house, and develops his own earning power more quickly.
Our booklet " The Bond Business as an Occupationfor
College Men" -will tell you many things you loill ivant
to know about tbe bond butinett. Askfor pamphlet po-i
