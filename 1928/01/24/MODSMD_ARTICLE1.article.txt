Phi Gamma Delta, El Toro, the In
dians, and Delta Chi each romped
home yesterday with their third suc
cessive victory, while the Cardinal
Thirties and Los Arcos ssffered their
third successive defeat in the Intra
mural Basketball Tournament. Larger
crowds are turning out to witness the
contests as the quintets approach
mid-season form, competition grows
hotter and interest grows keener.
The smoothest played game thus
far in the tourney was the game last
night between Phi Gamma Delta and
Alpha Tau Omega. With the score
tied 5 to 5 at the start of the second
half, the Fijis opened a fast passing
attack which netted them a 14-9 vie- -
.tory. Both houses put well-drilled
teams on the court which showed the
result of practice, working with a
minimum of the stumbling and fum
bling which marred the early intra
mural games of the season. Klotz and
Downing, Fiji forwards, performed
like veterans. Klotz was the outstand
ing player of the contest. Alpha Tau
Omega played more of a defensive
game in the last quarter with the de
fense centered around Staley who
starred for the A.T.O.'s throughout
the whole fray.
Delta Chi Wins
Delta Chi led Encina 4E through
four quarters to win 13-3. Wild pass
ing and shooting, especially on the
part of the freshmen, featured the
game. Players on both teams fired a
volley of shots at the basket in the
third and fourth quarters from the
center of the floor, but comparatively
few of the shots resulted in scores.
McAdoo, Delta Chi forward, starred
for the Rowmen on the defensive in
addition to sinking three pretty goals.
In a hard game featured by close
guarding on both sides the Indians
fought their way to a 24 to 6 victory
over the Sigma Alpha Epsilon quintet.
Each team presented a strong de
fense but the Indians overcame their
opponents' protection with a brand of
basketball that promises to carry
them beyond their own league. Guth
rie, towering center for the winners,
was high-point man with 10 counts to
his credit.
Third Sequoia Victory
Making half of his team's scores,
Smith led the Sequoia I team to its
third victory in League VI by defeat
ing the Encina 5 team 32 to 6. The Se
quoia team, playing a superior brand
of ball, kept the ball in their posses
sion most of the time and were suc
cessful in a large percentage of their
shots. The Encina team played hard,
but were unable to hold the ball in
their possession, or resist the smash
ing attack of their opponents.
Taking a lead of 8 points before
their opponents were able to reach
the basket, the All Blacks increased
their lead and won over the El Campo
squad 23 to 4. The El Campo team
played a hard, fighting brand of bas-
ketball, but were unable to withstand
the fast attack, or break through the
| strong defense, of the All Black quin
i tet: The winners were led in the scor
ing by Niekirk who scored 6 of his
team's points.

Krause Scores
In a game that was fast during the
first half, El Toro downed Los Arcos
by a score of 20 to 3. The El Toro
men handled the ball well and fed it
to Krause, their star forward, from
all positions. He was high-point man,
scoring 13 of his team's total points.
The Los Arcos squad had difficulty in
getting the ball through their op
ponents' strong defense, and were
successful in making only one basket.
The Cardinal Thirties forfeited the
first game scheduled for the afternoon
