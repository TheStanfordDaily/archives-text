# PAGE SPEAKS TONIGHT UPON CONSTRUCTIVE WORLD POLICY
## WANTS WAR OUTLAWED Authority Says We Can Think Way to International Peace, Amity 
### 
"If we want to, we can think our {
way out of war; but it takes more
courage than to go into the trenches,"
declared Kirby Page before an Oregon
audience. Page will lecture on"A Con- j
structive Foreign Policy" in the As- |
sembly Hall at 7:30 o'clock tonight. !
Asserting that less than one-half of :
one per cent of the people want war, j
he pointed out that we continue to
wage an average of one war in this
world to every two and a half years.
These do not just happen, he says, i
but result from a clash of ideas and j
emotions.
Page called attention to the fact i
that these clashes come about through
the inevitable results of the world's j
current conceptions of national inter- ■
ests, national sovereignty, the old I
duelling conception of national honor, |
and the common conception of nation- j
al patriotism.
The lecturer, who is editor of "The
World Tomorrow," and an author, |
educator, and publisher, believes that
destruction of the war system may be
fostered through the outlawry of war,
which has the effect of taking war
and war methods out of international
lav/ through treaties.
Page will be guest at a dinner to be j
given tonight at 5:30 o'clock in the :
special dining room in the New Union j
by the Committee on the Stanford
Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A.
Tickets for the dinner are on sale ,
