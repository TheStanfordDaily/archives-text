# EVILS OF DRINK HIT BY PADLOCKED SIGN ON ROUGHS' CORNER
## 
### 
Shed a tear for the.days of beer
Ye erstwhile roughs of '99â€”
Remember the Engineering
corner, for many years rendez
vous of the traditional Stanford
rough, the "Son of a Gambolier"?
That was in the days when
roughs were rough and preferred
their foaming beer in quart
steins.
Today on the identical corner,
padlocked in a glass case, a sign
sneers at tradition. Flaunting its
message in six-inch letters it
dogmatically asserts to the sons
of these same roughs: "PROHI
BITION is the best METHOD
of dealing with the LIQUOII
PROBLEM"!
The W.C.T.U. will never know
everything that has been said
about that sign it posted there.
