# SAULIERE APPOINTED TO ANNAPOLIS, WEST POINT; REFUSES BOTH
## Youngest Veteran of World War Prefers to Study Law at Stanford 
### Calvin Wood 
Word was sent to Frank Sauliere,
a junior at Stanford, recently tliat
he had been appointed to the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point.
Sauliere refused the appointment. In
1925, before entering Stanford, he
had been appointed to the U.S. Naval
Academy at Annapolis, which appoint
ment he also refused.
Such action, it is believed, is unique.
Few decline appointments to either
academy, and still fewer decline ap
pointments to both. Sauliere saw
active service in the World War. In
1917 he went to Bordeaux, France,
with the ISth United States Engi
neers at the age of twelve as official
interpreter for the unit. He served
011 the battle front. For distinguished
service he was recommended by Sen
ator James D. Phelan for a suitable
decoration. He is the youngest mem
ber of the American Legion and of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and is
at present a second lieutenant of the
Infantry in the Organized Reserves.
Sauliere's decision is the result of
his personal desire to enter law, with
special emphasis on the international
phase of law. He believes that time
spent studying the theory of killing
men is 110 means to establishing
world peace.
It has been Sauliere's choice to
work his way through Stanford in
order to study along the lines of his
convictions, rather than accept gratis
the education offered him at institu
tions to which it is considered by
others an honor to be appointed.
