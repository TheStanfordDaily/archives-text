# Presentation Of Israel In Egypt Scores Success

Stanford's Memorial Church commem
orated its twenty-fifth anniversary last
night with an excellent presentation of a
work of superlative dignity and ear
nestness. Handel's oratorio "Israel in
Egypt." The combined choir of the Tem
ple Emanu-el of San Francisco and the
Stanford Oratorio choir proved highly
adequate in strength and solidity of tone
for the great choral passages, which were,
all in all, the most memorable parts of the
oratorio. All of the six solo artists per
formed their exacting parts with spirit
and finish.
An orchestra selected from members
of the San Francisco Symphony blended
its tone with that of the organ, played on
this occasion by Wallace Sabin, Warren
D. Allen acting ac conductor. A Con
certo for Organ and Orchestra by Handel
was with great discernment played be
fore the oratorio and served as a prelude
to saturate the listeners with the spirit of
classicism, and of Handel's classicism in
particular.
The descriptive quality of the music be
came apparent immediately when, in the
first chorus, the singing of the word
"sigh" was" accompanied by a correspond
ing sound from the orchestra. The ora
torio sets to a series of choruses the Bib
lical story of the oppression of the chil
dren of Israel by the Egyptians, the vari
ous plagues sent by the Lord, and the
escape of the chosen people through the
Red Sea.
The idea of a chorus, organ, and or
chestra engaged in performing music lit
erally suggestive of plagues of frogs, lice,
and flies has, to the modern taste, some
thing of the ludicrous, but the general
elevated and earnest tone of the
whole work precluded any such effect.
Handel used thonies closely sugges
tive of the sense of the words that
were to accompany them long before
Richard Wagner wrote liis music
dramas, if this work is any indica
tion. When the Lord ordained so that
"fire mingled with the hail and ran
along the ground," fire does run along
the ground in a most convincing way.
.When a thick darkness descends the
tone of the music is heavy and im
penetrable; the gloom is unmistak
able.
And so when the children of Israel
exult and praise Heaven the chorus
bursts into magnificent paens.
The very repetitious and re-repeti
tious nature of the classical music
fitted nobly with the Biblical text and
produced effects of dignity and majes
ty through its sheer weight.
