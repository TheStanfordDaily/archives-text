# WASEDA FIVE BEATEN 52-12 BY STANFORD IN SLOW TILT
## Cardinals Score Thirty-Four Points in Second Half In Decisive Win JAPANESE PASS WELL Varsity Prepares for Game With St. Ignatius Team For Next Contest 
### Merle Emery 
Stanford's winning streak continued
last night when the Cardinal basketball
team took a decisive victory over the
Waseda Japanese quintet in a listless
game whose final score was 52 to 12 in
favor of Hunt's men.
The game afforded a work-out for the
Cardinals preparatory to meeting St. Ig
natius tomorrow night. The Gray l-'og
men are rated as one of the strongest
teams on the Coast as the result of their
recent victories over California and Fres
no State.
Hunt started the same combination
that pulled the surprise victory over the
Bruins last Saturday and kept it in for
the majority of the lirst period. After
some minutes of milling around, the
Cardinals got down to business and the
managers started to work with the add
ing machine. Cook opened the scoring
with a basket.
Smalling Shows
Smalling, who made five baskets in
the Cardinals' match with the Bruins,
almost equa'ed his record with four field
shots, and Richards counted for a basket,
followed by another one made by Cook.
Rothert and Cook made four free throws
each.
The Stanford reserves were sent in
with four minutes to play. Berg and Bry
ant, forwards; Clark, center; and Vin
centi and Biaggini, guards. This team
was unable to score and the half ended
18 to 0, the Cardinals leading.
The Japanese players, wearing their
highly Americanized colors, maroon and
white, could have taught Stanford some
thing in the way of passing in this pe
riod. Their exchange of the ball was
accurate and smoothly executed, and they
rarely missed hooking a pass, though
their smallness of stature handicapped
them. The tallest man on the team Haya
I Kawa, measures five feet and some eight
or nine inches in height.
The Cardinals continued to walk stead
ily away from Waseda in the second
half, while the Japanese made 12 points.
Hunt sent in a string of substitutes that
added more to the Cardinal score. Bow
ers, forward, shared honors with Bryant
for high point man, each counting for
twelve points in this half.
Suzuki and Tomita shared individual
i honors for Waseda, each making four
I points.
Japanese List Games
The Japanese players have six more
games scheduled to play in the United
States before they leave for Waseda,
February 8. They will meet University
of Nevada, Oregon Teachers' College,
University of Washington, University of
Oregon, and two local Seattle teams.

Smalling Shows
Smalling, who made five baskets in
the Cardinals' match with the Bruins,
almost equa'ed his record with four field
shots, and Richards counted for a basket,
followed by another one made by Cook.
Rothert and Cook made four free throws
each.
The Stanford reserves were sent in
with four minutes to play. Berg and Bry
ant, forwards; Clark, center; and Vin
centi and Biaggini, guards. This team
was unable to score and the half ended
18 to 0, the Cardinals leading.
The Japanese players, wearing their
highly Americanized colors, maroon and
white, could have taught Stanford some
thing in the way of passing in this pe
riod. Their exchange of the ball was
accurate and smoothly executed, and they
rarely missed hooking a pass, though
their smallness of stature handicapped
them. The tallest man on the team Haya
I Kawa, measures five feet and some eight
or nine inches in height.
The Cardinals continued to walk stead
ily away from Waseda in the second
half, while the Japanese made 12 points.
Hunt sent in a string of substitutes that
added more to the Cardinal score. Bow
ers, forward, shared honors with Bryant
for high point man, each counting for
twelve points in this half.
Suzuki and Tomita shared individual
i honors for Waseda, each making four
I points.
