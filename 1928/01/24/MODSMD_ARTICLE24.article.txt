# CARDS MEET ATHENS CLUB IN DUAL WATER CONTEST FEBRUARY 3
## 
### 
February 3 has been announced as
the date for the Athens Club swim
ming and water polo meet, which will
be held in the Athens pool at Oak
land.
This meet will be dual, with all the
short-distance races included. Athens
has a powerful swimming team, with
the same men playing polo. Stanford
is as strong as any outfit on the
Coast, so Coach Ernst Brandsten pre
dicts a hot contest in both sports.
The Cardinal diving team has re
cently exceeded all expectations by
producing two additional men whom
the coach has named as Olympic
Games prospects. Ed Throndson and
Bert Marsh have shown such unusual
improvement in the last week that a
trip to Amsterdam is looming strong
ly. "Whitey" Burns, the freshman
diving, water polo, and back-stroke
wonder, turned out again yesterday.
He suffered a broken nose in water
polo practice a week ago.
