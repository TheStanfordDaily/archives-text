TIIE circulation of a petition to amend the football Block "S" awards
section in the by-laws of the A.S.S.U. Constitution conies as an expres
sion of belief among the members of the football team and interested
students that there is room for improvement in this matter of awards.
In the first place, it must be understood that the A.S.S.U. has no set of
by-laws in force. The old ones were swept away by the adoption of the
new constitution last spring, and student officers have merely been acting
in accordance with these old ones until a new set of revised ones is
formally adopted. A By-laws Revision Committee, selected last fall, has
been revising the old ones into a more intelligible form, and the result of
their efforts, already drawn up, will be presented for adoption at the
regular winter elections 011 February 14.
Under the old by-laws only one football player may be awarded a
Block "S" upon the proper recommendations. As a consequence of this,
when three men were recommended last week (Morley, Fleishhacker, and
Klabau), only one received the award. In the eyes of a large portion of
the football team all three of these men should have received their awards
and, to prevent possible recurrence of this circumstance in the future, a
petition lias been drawn up, with the assistance of General Manager A1
Masters, providing for a change in the awards system. Some sixty-three
names have been signed to the petition.
fOI is the wording of this petition which will be presented
to the Executive Committee for consideration tonight:
"We, tlie undersigned students of Stanford University, do peti
tion that a general election of the A.S.S.U. be held to vote 011 the
following measures:
"I. That Section 2, paragraph A, be amended to read, 'A Block
"S" shall be awarded in football to (1) Any man who has played ten
minutes of the Stanford-California football game; or (2) Any man
who has played fifteen minutes in a post-season or intersectional
game; or (3) Any man who has played not less than ten minutes in
two conference football games other than the California game, and
whose total playing time in conference games shall amount to sixty
minutes. A maximum of three men may be granted a Block "S" in
football whose exceptional work during the season &ives them the
recommendation of the captain and the coach of football, the general
manager, and the Executive Committee.
" '11. That the above rules shall be retroactive for the football
season of 1927.'"
DRIEFLY, the changes which this would bring about, were it to be
adopted arc: (1) That the proper recommendation of three men
would entitle them to their Block "S" awards; (2) That playing fifteen
minutes in a post-season or intersectional game would be sufficient to
entitle a man to a Block "S." Specifically, because of the second clause
making this petition retroactive, this would mean the awarding of letters
to Fleishhacker, Klabau, and Worden (who played a full second half in
the Pittsburgh game).
If this petition is acted upon favorably by the Executive Committee
tonight, it may be sent to the By-laws Revision Committee for insertion
in its work, or it may be added as a separate amendment and voted upon
in the general winter quarter elections.
We favor the adoption of the amendment as being an expression of
what the football team thinks desirable. Furthermore, it is, after all, a
matter for the coach of an athletic team to determine with greater free
dom whether men who perhaps miss the required playing time by one
or two minutes should receive letters.
