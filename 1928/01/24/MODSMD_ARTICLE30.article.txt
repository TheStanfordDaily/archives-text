The Editor, Sir:
There is, at present, in the Depart
ment of Physical Education for Wo
men at Stanford, a rule which states
that every woman niu.st enroll for at
least one quarter's work in competi
tive sports. This rule was, no doubt,
invented with the best of motives.
Perhaps its originator had in mind
(he fact that certain women needed
the training given in competitive
spirit, independence and poise, or
other noble qualities of ideal woman
hood.
However, it is obvious and inevi
table that such a rule, blindly en
forced with no regard to proper aims
or possible consequences, will defeat
its own purpose. It is almost a truism
to state that teachers and directors
of physical education should remem
ber that the aim of, in fact, the ex
cuse for, physical education is to de
velop physical efficiency. Neverthe
less, this axiom seems to be entirely
overlooked or ignored by certain
teachers (at Stanford) who perhaps
think that their salary is just compen
sation only for the rigid enforcing
of rules.
Participation in any strenuous
sport requires that the participant
be in good physical condition if he
(or she) is to derive any benefit from
such sport. The importance of this
fact cannot be over-emphasized, espe
cially as regards women's athletics.
Strenuous exercise for the person
who is not properly trained, and
whose muscles are not sufficiently
hardened, is not only non-beneficial,
it is decidedly harmful physically and
mentally. It defeats all the aims and
purposes of physical education; it is
worse than no exercise at all!
Women should not be allowed,
much less required, to participate in
sports for which they are not proper
ly prepared. Girls whose muscles are
soft, or who are in any way subject
(o severe physical strain, should be
advised as to proper methods to
gradually develop physical endurance,
and tliey should be allowed to com
pete in "strenuous games only after
being properly developed.
It is hardly a recommendation to
have it said that the Department of
Physical Education for Women at
Stanford defeats its aim by straining
and breaking down the physical ef
ficiency of its pupils.
Sincerely, A.R.
The Editor, Sir:
Did it occur to anyone else that
the writer of last Friday's Bull Ses
sion waxed a little intolerant in his
denunciation of intolerance?
All human organizations are reluc
tant to change; particularly so are
religious organizations. Each religious
group believes that its dogmas are
true (no thinking person today be
lieves that the Catholic Church is
the only church that has dogmas—all
churches have them; it is conflicts
of dogmas that divided Portestantism
into its hundreds of sects) and hence
conflicting dogmas of other religious
groups must be false. There is no
conceivable excuse for the existance
of a church that does not feel that its
doctrines are somehow superior to
those of other churches. There is no
"inferiority complex" among churches.
Now any compromise requires
change; it requires conscious, specific,
and willed change. And a compromise
requires a particular, unpleasant kind
of change, for a compromise is a con
tract, which satisfies no party to it.
It is stupid to think that the Catho
lic Church is the only church that
dislikes compromise. The great Evan

gelical Protestant churches of this
country were divided by the Civil
War; and they still remain divided
because of that reluctance to com pro- j
mise, though the political and social
peace after that war was settled over ;
a half century ago. In defense of '
these churches it may be said that
the political organization of the North J
and South would not compromise j
either —they fought the greatest civil!
war that the world has seen to de- j
termine whose will should dominate. ]
And is the present-day "war" between 1
the Fundamentalists and the Modern- j
ists in most of the Protestant groups !
in keeping with "the present desire
for harmony"? Desire by whom?;
Where?
Consider the difficulties of compro
mise. If the Catholic Church today '
were to make such changes as would
cause the Anglo-Catholic to return to
Home, would the Low-Church group
of the Anglican Church be satisfied?!
Hardly. One can almost imagine more
"anti-papist" riots.
But why in the name of Charity
should there be any ill-feeling be
tween individuals on account of re- j
ligious doctrines? Happily each indi- 1
vidual may consult his conscience, or
his Bible, or the Pope, or all three,
to aid him in his own moral and re
ligious guidance.
