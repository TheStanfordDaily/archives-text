IT SEEMS TO ME—
That Charles Lindbergh, of whom
one might aptly say, "On that name |
no eulogy is expected," has given us {
more to think about than the mere j
fact of his incomparable tlights in the
face of tremendous odds and world
skepticism.
He has been the toast of presidents, j
kings, diplomats, and Will Rogers,
and yet he is, we feel with relish, the j
epitome of Americanism. He embodies
in one man the finest of our tradi-j
tion and ideals, and all that we secret
ly feel that we ARE personally, or
that we want to be. He is the fulfill
ment of our suppressed desires to
DO, and BE something, and therein
lies the secret of our feeling that he
is very much in the heart of each
of us.
It is questionable if there lives an
American who does not feel that if
he but had the chance that he, too,
could do deeds of greatness, and re
tain his modesty, stability, and single
ness of purpose—and yet continue to
he a "regular fellow." We like to
feel that we could all be "Lindys,"
if we but had the opportunity; that
wherever Lindbergh goes the typical
American (if such a species of homo
sapiens has yet been classified —much
, less captured) is being represented.
1 Yet, on closer analysis, we may be
I shocked to learn that our idol is not
the prototype of Mr. Average Ameri
can, but an anomaly.
Lindbergh is blessed with tact and
far-sightedness. He is big enough to
j realize that men and nations can
i come the nearer to achieving their
] own ultimate good and progress when
they are not interfered with, and are
allowed to live in the manner they
believe best. His wisdom is shown by
| his more or less tacit "laissez-faire"
attitude toward the customs, ideals,
and habits of his host countries.
Quite the antithesis of Mr. Average
j American!
Were the latter to find himself so

swiftly carried to the dizzy heights
of popularity, lie would soon discover 1
himself autographing prepared testi- !
monials as to the pleasure or efficacy
; of yeast, raisins, cigarettes, or patent
medicines. The siren lure of the dol
lar would usually result in the capi
talization of his name or act. It re
i quires sterling character, and sincer
ity, to realize, and act upon the knowl
-1 edge, that there IS something beyond
and larger than money; namely —
INTEGRITY, and its attendant un
willingness to merchandise a name.
It is now a bromidiom to say that
Lindbergh has done more, in his own
! iiuiet way, to foster good-will toward
i America than the combined diplo
matic forces organized for that pur
j pose; but that statement is just as
j true as it is trite, and that is saying
' much —but not too much. He has
I ceased to be an individual to our
; neighbors, whether they be across the
i sea, or terrestrially south of us, and
l has become a symbolan Ideal: "Amer-
I ica."
To Europe and Central America,
I who have caricatured "Uncle Sam" as
| a Shylock in long pants, with the
t all-too-familiar "three ball" symbol as
i a national crest, "Lindbergh" has be
| come "Uncle Sam" personified.
So, "Skoal" to Lindbergh, our mer
-1 ited pride, who makes us all just a
| bit more thoughtful because we real
! ize in him the fullest expression of
ourselves —as we would LIKE to be.
