# BABE QUINTET SHOWS SLUMP; HUNT BLAMES EXCESSIVE WORKOUTS
## California Freshmen Have Dangerous Reputation; Individuals Star 
### 
In the belief of "Husky" Hunt, Stan
ford University's basketball coach,
the undefeated freshman cage quintet
is undergoing a decided slump which
will have to bn overcome if tlioy hope
to down the California babes in their
annual three-game series starting
February 15.
Hunt attributes the let-down to an
overdose of hard practicing and a lack
of close competition in their regular
games, which has made the members
of the team grow careless in their
passing and shooting and slower in
their floorwork. As a result he plans
to hold only light practices for a week
or so and to work the babes against
the varsity whenever possible, in the
hope that their former speed and ac
curacy will return.
U.C. Babes Speedy
The California freshmen have al
ready earned a reputation for the
ability of the individual members of
the team, but a definite first-string
line-up has not yet been worked to
gether. Some of the best high school
players of the state in recent years
are included in its personnel.
This week Stanford will play three
more games, the first of which will
be against Stockton High School on
Wednesday night. Very little is known
about this outfit, but Stockton is
known for its fast cage teams and
this one may prove no exception. Fri
day night the babes will clash with
the Berkeley High School five and oil
Saturday night with Santa Cruz High.
The latter is not considered very
formidable, but the Berkeleyites
should be able to put up a good fight.
Line-up Not Definite
The starting line-up for Wednes
day night's game is not yet definite
since Hepp, a recent transfer from
guard, has been giving the first-string
forwards plenty of competition lately
and may begin the game in the place
of Moffatt or Joujon-Roche. Mears,
Reynolds, and Tampcke are certain
to start.
Following is the schedule of games
remaining to be played:
Feb. I—St. Mary's Freshmen.
Feb. 3 —Richmond Union High.
Feb. 4 —Santa Barbara State Teach
ers College. ,
Feb. B—San Mateo Junior College.
Feb. 15— U.C. Freshmen.
Feb. 22 —U.C. Freshmen.
Feb. 25 —U.C. Freshmen.
