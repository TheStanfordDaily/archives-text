# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Once more a famous Coast Leaguer
comes up to the majors for another try,
and those who know the ways of big
league baseball look at each other know
ingly and inquire, "Ah, but will lie make
the grade?" For Lefty O'Doul, like many
others from the Coast, has been pro
moted again to the ultimate goal of all
minor leaguers, and it will be very inter
esting to see whether or not he sticks.
I can't help but be reminded of the case
of Paul Strand, who went to the Athletics
in the spring of 1924 with a reputation
even greater than that of O'Doul's today.
Strand, who had been up before, like
O'Doul, as a pitcher, was purchased by
Connie Mack for $50,000 on the basis of
his sensational playing with the Salt Lake
club of the Pacific Coast League, the
same circuit from which O'Doul now
comes to the Giants. Paul had made 325
hits in the long 1923 Coast season, hit 43
home runs, and batted .394! But he
proved a dismal flop as an outfielder for
Philadelphia, and Connie soon had to let
him go.
Now this does not mean that there
fore four years later another P.C.L. phe
nom will be a bust in his come-back at
tempt in the major leagues. Not by a
jugful! Any more than the fact that be
cause Brooklyn won a pennant in 1916
and 1920, and almost won it again in
1924, it will land on or near the top in
1928. This doesn't happen to be Lefty
O'Doul's second shot at the majors, eith
er. After failing as a Yankee pitcher in

1919, he had a trial with the Red Sox
in 1923 and with the Cubs in the spring
of 1926.


Up for Another Trial
