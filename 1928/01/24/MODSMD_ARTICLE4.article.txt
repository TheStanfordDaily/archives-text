# FRENCH PROFESSOR'S BOOK DESCRIBES STANFORD ROUGH
## 
### 
During the summer quarter, 1926,
Professor Jean-Marie Carr6 of the
University of Lyons, France, held a
chair in the Romance Languages De

was incidental to a tour he made of

as distinguished European travelers
upon their return home from America
usually do, a volume of impressions
of the United States and Canada. A
copy of this new book has just been
received by Professor William L.
Schwartz, of the French department.
The "Images" open with a pano

is losing ground in the United States

to cure its "growing pains" and to
build up what is better than an em
pire—a civilization.

pay their board or school expenses by
taking jobs in the university, which
they get from an official employment
office.
"They are glad to become tutors,
typists, secretaries, or cashiers, hut
