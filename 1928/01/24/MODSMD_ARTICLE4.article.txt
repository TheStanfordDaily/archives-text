# FRENCH PROFESSOR'S BOOK DESCRIBES STANFORD ROUGH
## 
### 
During the summer quarter, 1926,
Professor Jean-Marie Carr6 of the
University of Lyons, France, held a
chair in the Romance Languages De
partment here. His stay at Stanford
was incidental to a tour he made of
this country, and he has now isstted,
as distinguished European travelers
upon their return home from America
usually do, a volume of impressions
of the United States and Canada. A
copy of this new book has just been
received by Professor William L.
Schwartz, of the French department.
The "Images" open with a pano
rama, in which the author gives his
reasons for believing that Idealism
is losing ground in the United States
and appeals to the elite of America
to cure its "growing pains" and to
build up what is better than an em
pire—a civilization.

Descriptions of Stanford
There follow descriptions, illus
trated by woodcuts by Philippe Bur
not, of New York, Canada, Florida,
Niagara, Mount Vernon, "From the
Colorado to the Pacific," Yosemite,
San Francisco, Stanford University,
and the Santa Clara Valley.
Professor Carr6 has devoted a page
or two to a classic description of the
Stanford rough. The translation, pre
pared by Professor Schwartz, follows:
"During these receptions, the wait
ing is done by students. It is not sur
prising to see, beside girls in low
necked dinner gowns, their male
classmates wearing white jackets and
passing around refreshments. There
is no false sense of shame. Nearly
half the men earn their living and
pay their board or school expenses by
taking jobs in the university, which
they get from an official employment
office.
"They are glad to become tutors,
typists, secretaries, or cashiers, hut
do not hesitate to act as chauffeurs,
cooks, gardeners, carpenters, painters,
household, servants, etc. You see them
watering the gardens of their profes
sors and clearing away the tables in
the Stanford Union dining room.
"Besides, there is a striking con
trast between the smart dress of the
women and the affected and free and
easy negligee of the young men. The,
latter affect (and this is a widespread
attitude) the ungainly gait of the
cowboys or ranchers of the Far Wpst.
"Their" bohemianism does not eA
press itself in long hair, a flowing tie
and a soft felt hat, but in a very
scanty costume, trousers shaped like
the feet of an elephant of undyed or
grey striped corduroy, spotted as
much as you like with gasoline or
grease and falling too low over huge
sport shoes, a shirt with a negligee
collar left flauntingly unbuttoned and
with sleeves rolled up beyond the
elbow, a leather belt with a metal
buckle —and that is all. Add to this
huge tortoise-shell glasses on boyish
faces, and you will have the profile
of the Stanford graduate student.
Cars Prevalent

"On account of the distances, they
do not think it fitting to go on foot
| from the postoffice to the Registrar's
J office, to the history department or
the medical buildings, and almost all
j of them have cars. However, they take
I groat care to choose those which are
: as broken-down and worn as possible.
| They have a preference for disem
j bowled upholstery, nicked and scarred
| bodies, and some may be seen driving
: about perched on a bare frame.
"This is an indispensable accessory
jof student life. In the evening the
j wide concrete highways of the Santa
Clara Valley are furrowed by count
less autos. These are the students
leaving ... in search of adventure,
or those who, squeezed in between
the steering-wheel and their co-ed
classmates, bring it along with them."
