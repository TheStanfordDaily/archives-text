"Spencer is a fine runner; I would like
to meet him again," said Dr. Otto Pelt
zer, holder of the world's record in the
half-mile and 1,000 meter, after his de
feat by Bud Spencer, captain and star
440-yard man of the Cardinal track var
sity. "I could run faster if I were in
better condition, but Spencer could prob
ably run faster too."
Dr. Peltzer explained that he did not
believe that he would be permitted to run
in this country so he has not kept in
strict training. lie received permission
from the German board a short time ago,
but is still waiting for action by the
A.A.U. It is thought possible that the
A.A.U. will refuse to grant this permis
sion.
Dr. Peltzer left the campus for Los
Angeles during the week-end where he
will be the guest of the Los Angeles
Athletic Club. From there he will go to
Chicago, and then to New York, sailing
from there February 21.
"I would like to run in this country.
The people have been very nice to me and
wish to see me run. I would like to sat
isfy them. If I compete in the East I
will run the mile and two mile as I can
do better in those distances," said the
famous German runner.
