"There is no more wonderful thing,
nothing to make life more worth liv
ing, than to find something new,"
said Neil E. Gordon, professor of
chemistry in the University of Mary
land, in a lecture, "Chemistry in Eu
rope," under the auspices of Phi
Lambda Upsilon, honorary chemistry
fraternity, in the Chemistry building
yesterday afternoon. Despite his work
as editor of the Journal of the Ameri
can Chemical Society, Professor Gor
don finds time to engage in research,
he told his listeners.
He illustrated this lecture of his re
cent European travels with slides
showing educational institutions and
chemistry laboratories in Europe.
The European lecture rooms, he said,
have straight benches instead of
chairs, making them less suitable for
sleeping than those in America. In
Italy, chemical research is carried on
by order of Mussolini, who appreci
ates its importance in the progress of
a nation.
