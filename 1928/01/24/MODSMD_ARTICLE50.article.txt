# SANTA CLARA BLAMES STUDENT SUICIDES ON WORLDLY PLEASURES
## 
### 
SANTA CLARA, Jan. 23.â€”Material
ism and over-indulgence in worldly plea
sures are blamed by Santa Clara students
for the prevalence of student suicide.
Next in responsibility, they believe, is the
lack of religion. These are the facts
gleaned from a questionnaire circulated
among the students of the university here
last week.
Twenty-five per cent of those ques
tioned ascribed student suicides to irre
ligion, 22 per cent to a false philosophy,
and 49 per cent to materialism and world
ly pleasures. Four per cent declined to
give answers.
Here are some of the answers given:
"Who wouldn't commit suicide after
studying the so-called philosophers who
are so popular today?"
"Because someone tells the prospective
suicide, 'Cheer up, kid. There ain't no
God'."
"Pernicious philosophy which denies
the existence of a hell and of a heaven.
If there is no master of life and death,
why live and be bored to death?"
