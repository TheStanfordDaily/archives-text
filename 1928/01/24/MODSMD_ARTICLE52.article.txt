# U.C.L.A. Has Kleptomaniacs Fraternity Men Offenders Hostelries Lose Silverware
## 
### 
Fraternity men at U.C.L.A. are klepto
maniacs, if the sudden disappearance of
furnishings from the Girard Country
Club at a recent class dance can be taken
to mean anything.
The repeated occurance of "prank"
stealing of this nature has led the welfare
board to search many fraternity and
sorority houses. Enough valuable silver
ware was found in the Greek letter
houses to start a good-sized hotel.
