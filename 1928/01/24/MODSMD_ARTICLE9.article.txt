# L.H. MEANS TO TALK ON TESTING COURSES OF GENERAL ELECTRIC
## 
### 
An illustrated lecture on the test
ing course of the General Electric
Company will be given today at 11
o'clock in Room 253 by L. H. Means
of the industrial service department
of the General Electric Company of
Schenectady, New York. The lecture
is primarily intended for students of
mechanical and electrical engineering,
but all interested engineering stu
dents are invited to attend.
Following the lecture, Means will
hold a series of appointments with
students who are interested in taking
the course at Schenectady. Many
Stanford students have in the past
taken advantage of this testing course
which is regarded as an excellent way
of obtaining practical experience as
well as of meeting with men from
other universities and learning their
points of view. Approximately 500
men are selected annually from 100
universities in the United States to
take the General Electric Company's
course.
