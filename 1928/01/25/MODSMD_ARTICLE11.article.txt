## Pre-Convention Presidential Campaign Inaugurated By Close Friends 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.—( U.P.)
—Friends of Herbert Hoover said
today the movement to line up
Republican Convention delegates
for him in New York State was
started with their approval but
without Hoover's formal consent.
They admitted that New York
political Iqaders conferred with
Hoover here last Friday, but in
dicated the Secretary was not
ready to make any statement at
this time.
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.—The first
definite move to line up New York in
behalf of Herbert Hoover for Presi
dent began today.
Three New York political leaders,
two of them Influential in the metro
politan area and the other in up-state
districts, announced that after a con
ference in Washington they had been
chosen to start a pre-convention cam
paign in this state.
Richard W. Lawrence, former
Bronx county chairman, will muster
candidates for Hoover in Manhattan
and the Bronx; Meier Steinbrink will
have charge of the campaign in Brook"
lyn, and Representative William H.
Hill of Binghamton will canvass the
up-state territory.
In beginning their campaign for
delegates, the leaders said they did
not intend to start any insurgent
movement within the Republican state
organization, which is seeking to send
an uninstructed delegation to the
Kansas City convention.
For the present, Lawrence said,
there is no intention of opening a
Hoover headquarters here. The pre
convention campaign managers, he
said, were selected merely to give
direction and order to Hoover senti
ment.
All of the men issued statements
reflecting their belief that the Secre
tary of Commerce in view of the re
cent withdrawal of President Coolidge
and Charles E. Hughes, was the out
standing candidate in the field.
"Hoover undoubtedly can carry
New York against any Democratic
candidate ,even including Governor
Smith," Steinbrink said.
