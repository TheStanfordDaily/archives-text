# CAUTION MOTORISTS TO CHANGE 1927 LICENSES
## 
### 
All students owning automobiles
should be sure that their cars have
1928 licenses before midnight next
Tuesday, says Comptroller A. E. Roth.
Failure to have new plates will result
in doubling the fees, and confiscation
of vehicles bearing 1927 licenses. Stor
age for automobiles will be charged,
and cars will not be released until
new numbers have been received by
the owners.
Applications should be sent to Sac
ramento immediately, with fee and
white certificate and correct address.
If a change of ownership has occurred,
the pink slip should be enclosed with
new owner's name.
