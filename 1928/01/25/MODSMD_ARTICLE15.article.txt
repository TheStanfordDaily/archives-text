# FRESHMAN BASEBALL PROSPECTS BRIGHT AS OPENING GAME NEARS
## 
### 
With practice last night and the
night before cancelled because of a
miuldy field, Stanford's freshman
baseball squad has less than three
weeks' time to whip itself into shape
for its first game. Work up to this
time lias been fundamental but tech
nical instruction is to start as soon
as the diamond dries.
Coach Harry Wolter pushed the
babes to top speed last week, with
the result that practically every mem
ber of the squad had sore muscles in
his throwing arm. Hitting practice
and base running will take up much
of the squad's time this week.
New Pitcher Good
The babes' already bright prospects
have been bolstered somewhat with
new material on the pitching staff.
Gillette, a newcomer, has been show
ing fine control with considerable
speed. His best ball is a neat curve
which he has down to perfection. At
the present time he looks better than
any of the other hurlers.
Several new infielders have been
reporting for practice during the last
few days. Heading this list is Hedge,
a second sacker, who looks as if he
were a real ball player. The infield
is composed of some very pretty play
ers.
Averaging up the team on the whole
it is a very well balanced affair ex
cept for the hitting. Unless Wolter
can develop several good sluggers
pretty soon, the offensive department
will be weak. Most of the men are
right handed batters, and Wolter is
trying to make southpaw polers out
of two or three of them.
Reports that are coming from the
California Babe camp indicate that
the Bear cubs are going to have a
strong squad and that the Cards must
go top speed to get in form to meet
them. The California series will not
be played until April.
