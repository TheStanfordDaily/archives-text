# YEARLING CAGE SOUAD WILL PLAY STOCKTON UNDEFEATED QUINTET
## 
### 
Two undefeated basketball teams
will match speed and skill in the
Stanford Pavilion tonight when the
Cardinal babes clash with the Stock
ton High School unlimited quintet in
their ninth game of the season. The
contest will begin at 7 o'clock and
will be played as a preliminary to the
varsity-St. Ignatius event.
Stockton is known for its fast for
wards, playing a five-man offense, and
should be able to give the Cardinal
guards a busy evening. Dinkle, guard,
is considered one of the steadiest men
on the team.
The starting line-up for the fresh
men has been announced as follows:
Mears, center; Hawkins and Moffatt,
forwards; Reynolds and Tampcke,
guards. In a workout yesterday after
noon this combination was found to
he the smoothest working of the lot,
passing accurately and getting down
the floor with plenty of speed.
Jim Mears, babe center, has been
making a splendid comeback since
injuring his ankle several weeks ago,
"taking high-point honors in the past
three games.
