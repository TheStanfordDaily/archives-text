# CARDINALS SET FOR GRAY FOG GAME TONIGHT
## Stanford's Ability Will Be Tested in St. Ignatius Basketball Tilt HUNT STRESSES PASSING Rothert to Play at Center; Second Team to Start Cage Encounter 
### Merle Emry 
Husky Hunt's varsity basketball
players will be given a stiff examina
tion in all phases of playing the court
game when they go up against the
St. Ignatius team at 8 o'clock tonight
in the Pavilion.
With two recent victories to their
credit, the Cardinals have a brighter
outlook for the outcome of tonight's
tilt. On the other side of the story
the Gray Fog team caught the Bears
napping ami afforded ample competi
tion for Fresno State and St. Mary's
in later games, though the latter
were winners by one point. It will test
the mettle of the Stanford men to be
able to come out with the long end
of the score on their side, as both
teams are well-matched.
General Workout Held
Hunt gave his charges a general
workout in yesterday's practice,
stressing long and short passes. He
put them through several exercises
on pivoting and basket-shooting, espe
cially on sucker shots which the
Cardinals missed so often in the
Waseda game.
Knowing the power of the Maloney-
Bareilles forward combination of the
Gray Fog team, the Stanford players
were given a talking-toon the advan
tages of the zone defense system and
how it should be played.
Maloney ran wild in the St. Mary's
contest and scored seven baskets
from all angles of the floor. In the
game .these forwards tal
lied twenty-four points of the total
score of thirty. Ferrick at center i3
Quick on the tip-off and valuable in
feeding the ball to the forwards.
Rothert Plays Center
The regular first-string team will
not start the game, but will probably
see most of the action later on. Roth
ert has been moved up to center on
the tip-off and falls back to guard on
the rest of the plays, except when
Vincenti is in at this position.
Cook and Richards, forwards;
Smalling, center; and Rothert and
Thompson, guards, have carried the
brunt of the attack of Stanford's last
three games, and will probably be
called on for action tonight after the
starting team has set the ball rolling.
The line-up for both teams follows:
Stanford St. Ignatius
Berg F Maloney
Clark F Bareilles
Rothert C Ferrick
Thompson G Patridge
Vincenti G Cameron

Vincenti G Cameron
Husky Hunt's varsity basketball
players will be given a stiff examina
tion in all phases of playing the court
game when they go up against the
St. Ignatius team at 8 o'clock tonight
in the Pavilion.
With two recent victories to their
credit, the Cardinals have a brighter
outlook for the outcome of tonight's
tilt. On the other side of the story
the Gray Fog team caught the Bears
napping ami afforded ample competi
tion for Fresno State and St. Mary's
in later games, though the latter
were winners by one point. It will test
the mettle of the Stanford men to be
able to come out with the long end
of the score on their side, as both
teams are well-matched.
General Workout Held
Hunt gave his charges a general
workout in yesterday's practice,
stressing long and short passes. He
put them through several exercises
on pivoting and basket-shooting, espe
cially on sucker shots which the
Cardinals missed so often in the
Waseda game.
Knowing the power of the Maloney-
Bareilles forward combination of the
Gray Fog team, the Stanford players
were given a talking-toon the advan
tages of the zone defense system and
how it should be played.
Maloney ran wild in the St. Mary's
contest and scored seven baskets
from all angles of the floor. In the
game .these forwards tal
lied twenty-four points of the total
score of thirty. Ferrick at center i3
Quick on the tip-off and valuable in
feeding the ball to the forwards.
Rothert Plays Center
The regular first-string team will
not start the game, but will probably
see most of the action later on. Roth
ert has been moved up to center on
the tip-off and falls back to guard on
the rest of the plays, except when
Vincenti is in at this position.
Cook and Richards, forwards;
Smalling, center; and Rothert and
Thompson, guards, have carried the
brunt of the attack of Stanford's last
three games, and will probably be
called on for action tonight after the
starting team has set the ball rolling.
The line-up for both teams follows:
Stanford St. Ignatius
Berg F Maloney
Clark F Bareilles
Rothert C Ferrick
Thompson G Patridge
