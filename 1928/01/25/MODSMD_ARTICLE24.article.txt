# A 						Cabinet Post

Discussion of a Secretary of Education is marking the preliminary
talk before nomination of the candidates for the presidency. That this
proposal may be seriously considered by one or both of the parties looms
as a probability. Speaking in the House of Representatives last month,
Daniel A. Reed of New York made some illuminating remarks on the
subject. He charged the present Bureau of Education with being inade
quate, although helpful. He added, "Great surveys in the field of education
now are being conducted here, there, and everywhere. All these investi
gations, while of varying importance, contain something of value to teach
ers in every section of the country, but at present means is lacking for their
co-ordination and dissemination."
Mr. Reed further contends that, instead of hindering the work of the
states and local communities, the leadership of the department of education
by a cabinet member would not only add prestige to the department but
would also greatly stimulate national interest in education. Such interest,
he pointed out, is a matter of immediate concern as shown by the records
made during the World War, showing that many of the drafted men were
unable to read a newspaper intelligently or to write a letter in English.
Secretary of Commerce Hoover, too, recognizes the influence of pres
ent-day changes in the economic system upon education, for, as he said last
year, "A century of scientific discovery has . . . necessitated a high degree
of specialization, more education, and skill." Hoover, however, has not
expressed himself particularly upon the question of having a cabinet secre
tary of education such as is urged by Representative Reed. Reed's point,
to us, seems as being well taken, ile likens the argument to that which
preceded the establishment <&* the Department of Agriculture. It is inter
esting to predict, too, that at some time in the future a similar argument
may be waged on the question of a national police force.
