In yesterday's editorial regarding the petition for the change in the
awarding of football Block "S" letters, we stated that this petition was
intended to amend the By-Laws, when, as a matter of fact, this petition,
if passed at the student body election, will amend the A.S.S.U. constitution.
As we learned from the Executive Committee last night, this petition is
designed to a fleet Article VI, Section 2, paragraph (a), subdivision (2).
But, as we did not learn from the Executive Committee, it also would
affect Article VI, Section 4, which deals with "exceptional awards." This
paragraph reads as follows: "One man in each major and minor sport
whose exceptional work during the season gives him the unanimous vote
of the captain and coach of that sport, the general manager, and the Execu
tive Committee, shall be granted the award of that sport."
The motion passed by the Executive Committee last night on this mat
ter reads as follows: "M.S.C. That subject to checking by the secretary,
the petition proposing a constitutional amendment presented to the Execu
tive Committeee be submitted to campus (i.e., general student body) vote
at the February election." Now, by Article XV, Section 1, two-thirds of
the votes cast on the proposed amendment will be required for its adoption.
