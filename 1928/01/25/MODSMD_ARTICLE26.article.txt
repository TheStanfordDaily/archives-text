Something giving Stanford good cause to pat itself on the back was
brought to our attention recently. The following note speaks for itself as
well as for Stanford:
Friend Hunt:
Just a note. ... I want to tell you that everywhere we hear of tin:
courteous treatment accorded basketball officials by Stanford coaches, play
ers, and student managers. It is certainly gratifying to know such sports
manship exists, particularly as we frequently hear reports exactly opposite as
regards the treatment of officials at some of the oilier schools.
Yours,
CHET GRIMMETT,
Secretary-Treasurer of Northern California
Coaches and Officials Basketball Association.
