Here's a problem—whether to dis
cuss the San Francisco concert of
Yehudi Menuliin, as the performance
of a spectacular and almost miracu
lous child prodigy, or to criticize it
as the offering of a violin artist who
happens incidentally to have just ar
rived at the age of eleven years. The
same problem was present in the
minds of most of the audience as they
sat listening to a program of the most
difficult selections in violin literature.
The incongruity of it, this stout,
sturdy-legged child with his black vel
vet breeches and white silk blouse,
playing Bach, and Mozart, and Chaus
son with a wholly deceptive ease and
the utmost impassivity of face, look
ing up after the completion of some
breath-taking finale to acknowledge
the applause with the awkward and
jerky nods of a well-bred and some
what embarrassed child.
The very strangeness of the situa
tion, coupled with the tremendous
size of the Municipal Auditorium,
created a situation which seems to
have prevented the San Francisco
audience from any wild display of
enthusiasm such as Yehudi seems to
have received in his Parisian and
Manhattan appearances, even though
he is San Francisco's native son, and
in every sense a conquering hero re
turning. True, he did play some five
encores, but there was lacking the
spontaneous fervor of applause that
might have been expected.
So much for the audience. Yehudi
himself came up to expectations, or
rather to predictions, as far as his
technique was concerned. He has a
beautifully rich and smooth tone, and
as for fingering—nothing seemed even
difficult for him. He never lost the

main thread of melody in the mazes
of decorative figures. His double stop
ping was a joy to hear. And always
the sense of complete absorption in
what he was doing. Once he got the
neckpiece adjusted under his chubby
chin, lie was oblivious of everything
outside his playing. Even at the last
when there was a general stampede
of the insatiables who must see the
prodigy at the closest possible range
he played on above the mass of cran
ing necks and gaping faces as though
he were practicing at home alone.
Truly a self-contained and unselfcon
scfous performer.
This same unawareness toward
r.heer effect takes the form in his
playing of a slight lack of dramatic
and arresting contrasts. Or is it sim
ply the absence of the melodramatic
lo which our grown-up virtuosos have
accustomed us? At any rate, it is a
lack in the boy's playing which will
undoubtedly disappear as he grows
older.
The program selected was built en
tirely too much around the idea of
showing a complete mastery of tech
nique in all its phases, and a mar
velously accurate memory, and too
little opportunity was given for play
ing of the simpler or more emotional
things, those which can show "inter
pretation" and "feeling" as far as the
great mass of listeners are concerned.
Only the richly mystical Chausson
"Poeme" and, somewhat lighter, an
encore, the New World Symphony
"Largo" responded to this latter need.
And in them Yehudi showed evidence
of a truly deep understanding, and a
very decided conception of his own
as to what the music should mean.

and arresting contrasts. Or is it sim
ply the absence of the melodramatic
lo which our grown-up virtuosos have
accustomed us? At any rate, it is a
lack in the boy's playing which will
undoubtedly disappear as he grows
older.
The program selected was built en
tirely too much around the idea of
showing a complete mastery of tech
nique in all its phases, and a mar
velously accurate memory, and too
little opportunity was given for play
ing of the simpler or more emotional
things, those which can show "inter
pretation" and "feeling" as far as the
great mass of listeners are concerned.
Only the richly mystical Chausson
"Poeme" and, somewhat lighter, an
encore, the New World Symphony
"Largo" responded to this latter need.

of a truly deep understanding, and a
very decided conception of his own
as to what the music should mean.

Here's a problem—whether to dis
cuss the San Francisco concert of
Yehudi Menuliin, as the performance
of a spectacular and almost miracu
lous child prodigy, or to criticize it
as the offering of a violin artist who
happens incidentally to have just ar
rived at the age of eleven years. The
same problem was present in the
minds of most of the audience as they
sat listening to a program of the most
difficult selections in violin literature.
The incongruity of it, this stout,
sturdy-legged child with his black vel
vet breeches and white silk blouse,
playing Bach, and Mozart, and Chaus
son with a wholly deceptive ease and
the utmost impassivity of face, look
ing up after the completion of some
breath-taking finale to acknowledge
the applause with the awkward and
jerky nods of a well-bred and some
what embarrassed child.
The very strangeness of the situa
tion, coupled with the tremendous
size of the Municipal Auditorium,
created a situation which seems to
have prevented the San Francisco
audience from any wild display of
enthusiasm such as Yehudi seems to
have received in his Parisian and
Manhattan appearances, even though
he is San Francisco's native son, and
in every sense a conquering hero re
turning. True, he did play some five
encores, but there was lacking the
spontaneous fervor of applause that
might have been expected.
So much for the audience. Yehudi
himself came up to expectations, or
rather to predictions, as far as his
technique was concerned. He has a
beautifully rich and smooth tone, and
as for fingering—nothing seemed even
difficult for him. He never lost the

main thread of melody in the mazes
of decorative figures. His double stop
ping was a joy to hear. And always
the sense of complete absorption in
what he was doing. Once he got the
neckpiece adjusted under his chubby
chin, lie was oblivious of everything
outside his playing. Even at the last
when there was a general stampede
of the insatiables who must see the
prodigy at the closest possible range
he played on above the mass of cran
ing necks and gaping faces as though
he were practicing at home alone.
Truly a self-contained and unselfcon
scfous performer.
This same unawareness toward
r.heer effect takes the form in his
playing of a slight lack of dramatic
and arresting contrasts. Or is it sim
ply the absence of the melodramatic
lo which our grown-up virtuosos have
accustomed us? At any rate, it is a

undoubtedly disappear as he grows
