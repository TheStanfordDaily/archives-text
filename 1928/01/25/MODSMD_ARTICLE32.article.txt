Do you realize that I have not been .
able to or rather allowed to say a j
word for three days and a half. Why
I never knew what agony and torture
meant before. I mean just because
some kind person had to go and give
my name to another person who j
didn't appreciate it, I had to be quiet. '
That is to say some very pious
person thought that I should either
change my name, or wait until the
trial was over. I was never so hurt j
iu my liio. .Cut 1 suppose it is the load '
that ail college girls have to carry, ;
you know, that of being misunder
stood most of the time.
It really is amazing to me, too, how j
Utile college men know about life. It j
does seem that an education should j
teach them more than it appears on 1
the surface to do. I mean, after all, I
every man should learn what a girl i
want 3 and when she wants it.
But to go back to that trial. It is
awfully embarrassing to have one's
name treated in such a fashion. Why
nowadays it is an insult to offer to
buy a paper for a girl.
And if you really think that I j
should change my name, only for a '
few montli3 of course, why I'll do the j
best I can. I mean, it would be nice I
if someone would help me out; I j
mean, I might like Sophisticated Sue j
for a name. I think it might do a lot !
for my column, because all college !
people like to think and read sophisti- |
cated things, too.
