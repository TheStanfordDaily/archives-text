Hundreds of readers, still bleary-eyed,
sought page two of the Daily yesterday
morning to read the further adventures
of Sally Watercolor and her miglity
muscled hee-ro, Roger Coxcomb. Cab
bages wishes to apologize for not making
an appcarance. Emma Fervor was not to
be found before the paper went to press.
Yesterday she strolled into our officc,
coiled up in the easier chair, lighted a
cigarette, and sighed. "What a week- j
end!" she said, stifling a yawn. "I went'
down to San Jose and posed as a State I
Teachers' College woman to get 'atmos
phere' for a new novel."
"And the results?"
"Enough dirt to get a dozen Stanford
men kicked out of this educational mill," !
she replied. "It's all going into a big ex
pose of college life and will probably ap- [
pear serially in the Hearst papers. Can
you think of a good title for it?"
"No, but perhaps 'Weenie* Norman
will lend you that title lie used in 'Chap
pie' last fall—'Those Who Wrestle by
Night'."
"That title is too limited for this orgy
of sin! This mud is going to be smeared
on with a scoop shovel —and now man
child, I'm going home to get a little
'shut-eye practice.' This atmosphere hunt
ing is STRENUOUS! Here's the fourth
installment of 'THE NFST, A VEST, I
AND YOU."
