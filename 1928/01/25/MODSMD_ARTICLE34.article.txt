INSTALLMENT FOUR
Mike the Mutt snarled in impotent
wrath, for from the pile of dead arose
the figure of Nellie the Souse, the Mutt's
late accomplice in the dim underworld of
evil and forgotten men. In her hand Nel
lie held a firm brown strop. She pointed
to the razor which the Mutt was bran
dishing only a few inches above Roger's

white collar.
"Your razor's dull, Mutt," she knifed
qut with a gasp of pain.
"Zounds!" he hoarsed out, "and well
may it be." He approached Nellie to
strop the razor. With a sudden move
ment she whipped out of somewhere a
shiny automatic. She pointed it at the
Mutt. There was a dull report, and six
feet of dust lay on the rough boards.
Nellie turned rapidly glazing eyes upon
Roger's cleancut, boyish features. She
stretched out her emaciatcd arms in a last
futile gesture of desire. "It is all over,
my own Roger! You never knew how I
cared for you."
Sally put her arms possessively around
Roger's neck. "This doesn't have to be a
triangle, does it, dear?" She put her lips
up to him like soft petals giving thanks
for the sunshine.
Roger tried to free himself from her
embrace, but she oidy tightened it spas
modically. Roger's thoughts were of poor
Nellie, who lay dead like a painted rag
doll in a heap. Her poor scarlet cheeks,
they had once blushed at thought of him,
unworthy Coxcomb!
Suddenly he clutched his breast pocket
in rage ....
