For A.R.'s edification the Stanford
gymnasium regulations are these:
(1) Instead of a quarter's work in
a competitive sport the department
requires a quarter's work in an out
door sport. (Is it possible that Archery
during fall or winter quarter is too
strenuous for "girls whose muscles
are soft, or who are in any war sub
ject to severe physical strain?")
(2) The Department of Physical
Education for Women at Stanford
does not "defeat its aim by straining
and breaking down the physical effi
ciency of its pupils." Before any wo
man is permitted to take part in any
sport requiring undue activity she
must pass a physical examination by
Dr. Mosher, Medical Advisor for wo
men, before she is permitted to en
gage in that sport. It is an adequate
precaution that no woman will be
permitted to exercise in a way which
"defeats all the aims and purpose s of
physical education."
I would advise A.R. to look before
she leaps, especially on the athletic
field. —M.A.C.
