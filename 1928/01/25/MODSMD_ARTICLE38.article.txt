HAVANA, Jan. 24.— (U.P.)—United
States proposals intended chiefly to
safeguard the Panama Canal defenses
met unexpected opposition today at
the sixth Pan-American Conference.
Dr. Enrique Olaya Herrera, Presi
dent of the Colombian delegation and
his country's minister to Washington,
said the proposals were modeled after
post-war treaties when "military psy
chology prevailed."
He feared the request that an exist
ing commercial treaty be altered so
that any two Pan-American countries,
for military reason could prohibit
flights over a given spot, might be
construed as permitting military alli
ances between neighboring states of
the Western Hemisphere.
