# FINAL DEADLINE SET BY QUAD STAFF FOR INDIVIDUAL PICTURES
## 
### 
Remaining individual photographs
for the Quad will be taken in the
Women's Clubhouse on February 1
and 2. This will be the last visit of
the photographer to the campus, and
students are urged to be prompt at
the appointments. Should the time
appointed by the Quad office be in
convenient, individuals are asked to
specify a time when they can appear.
Seniors who have bought their
books will be given preference, but
those who do not intend to buy the
yearbook may have their picture and
record in the book upon payment of
$1.50, according to Mac Lewis, man
ager.
Those wishing to have their pic
tures retaken should notify the Quad
editorial office in order that they may
be fitted into the schedule. Otherwise
the staff will choose the print to ap
pear in the Quad from the photogra
pher's negatives, he stated. After
February 1 the senior section of the
Quad will close, as all pictures will
be arranged and mounted on panels.
