# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
In these days when news is scarce be
tween the end of the football season and
the beginning of baseball, it seems quite
fitting and proper to reminisce on events
of the past, and even to fill the air with
silly debates on such momentous questions
as "If a man raced a horse over a short
sprint distance, which would win."
Back in 1922 some enterprising gentle
man, seeking something new to attract
the thrill-loving public to the annual
Syracuse Fair, hit upon the novel idea of
a race between a horse and a man. For
the man, they naturally chose Allan
Woodring, then a student at the local
university and famous as the conquerer
of Charlie Paddock at the 1920 Olym
pics, and as intercollegiate 220-yard
champion in 1921. For Allan's four
footed opponent they chose a Canadian
horse named, strangely, Yankee Lad. The

distance decided on was 70 yards, as it
was figured out that the horse would
just about catch tip with the human at
that distance, and they figured correctly.
The enterprising jockey who rode Yan
kee Lad decided not to let Woodring get
too big a handicap at the start of the
race, so he trained his mount to start
with a pistol, figuring that he would need
I a fast getaway to catch the fleet Syracuse
runner at 70 yards. So horse and rider
practiced standing on the starting line
with all four feet, rearing up and turning
! and dashing off madly as the gun went
| off.
In the presence of 20,000 spectators,
j our two-footed hero was nearly crippled
j for life by one of Yankee Lad's practice
| starts. Woodring finally won in 7 1-5
j seconds, receiving a fine bag of oats as a
• prize.
