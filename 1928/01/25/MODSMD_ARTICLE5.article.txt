# Page Dubs War As "Frankenstein;" Advocates Adequate Peace Policy
## 
### 
"Frankenstein" is the epithet ap
plied to war by Kirby Page, editor of
"The World Tomorrow," and widely
conversant with contemporary affairs,
in his address last night in the As
sembly Hall as he discussed "A Con
structive Foreign Policy." "We have
created this monster, and it is our
duty to destroy it."
Outlawry of War Stressed
In presenting the outlines of a pro
gram which would work toward this
objective, Page stressed three im
portant divisions: the outlawry of
war by treaty, the building up of an
adequate "peace system," and the
working out of a satisfactory program
of enforcement.
Outlawry is significant in view of
the profound difference it would make
in the psychology of the people, be
lieves Page. With war de-legalized,
the pacifist would become the patriot

and it would be criminal for a nation
to enter war. The peace system he
advocates would include several
bodies, such as the League of Nations,
treaties like (he Locarno pacts, and
more regional organizations such as
the Pan-American Union.
Advocates Disarmament
To support the program of enforce
ment Page would rely upon three
sanctions: diplomatic, economic, and
moral pressure. To these points he
adds patience as a requisite to suc
cess. Disarmament, and disentangling
ourselves from an imperialistic policy
by withdrawing from the Philippines,
are other measures the speaker con
siders essential to the attainment of
world peace.
At a dinner arranged for him earlier
in the evening in the New Union by
the Stanford Committee of the
Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A., Page spoke
on his personal prejudices to war.
