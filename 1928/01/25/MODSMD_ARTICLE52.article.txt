WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.—(U.P.)—
Senator Tom Heflin of Alabama told |
the Senate today that some news- '
papers are deliberately misquoting his ;
anti-Catholic speeches. He threatened \
that action would be taken against
newspaper correspondents unless the j
alleged misrepresentations stop.
Heflin read an article in the Wash
ington News, a Scripps-Howard news-1
paper.
"Tliis is part of the propaganda of
the Roman Catholic political ma
chine," he said. "The Washington
News said I challenged the Democrats
to rebuke me and said I would quit
the party if they did and that millions
would quit with me.
"This is not true. I challenged the
New York World to have such action
taken because it said in an editorial
that it was not satisfied with what
the Democratic Caucus did after my
controversy with Senator Robinson."
