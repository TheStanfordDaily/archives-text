Yesterday's mural basketball games
were featured by a brilliant display
of near-cliampionsliip form. Five of
the seven games were very closely
contested, two going into extra
periods before the winners could be
determined. The teams showed an
improvement over last week's form
and are assuming true mid-season con
dition.
Making four points to their oppon
ents' one in the second extra, period
the Sigma Nu five fought their way
through the best game of the day to
an 18 to 15 victory over the strong
Kappa Sigma outfit. Smashing
through a defense that had been too
much for them for three quarters, the
Kappa Sigma quintet came from be
hind in the last minutes with three
shots by C. Mann to tie the score and
force the game into an extra period.
In a fray that was anyone's till the
last minute, the Encina 2W team
downed the El Tigre squad 19 to 14.
The teams were well matched and
fought a close game from start to
finish.
In another contest that was close,
both teams showed excellent floor
work and clever dribbling when the
Fighting Phi Betes defeated the Busi
ness Men 16 to 15. The defenses of
both were weak but the scoring was
kept down by inaccuracy in shooting.
The Encina 1W five, which took a
long lead over the Phi Kappa Sigma
team in the first quarter of their
game, weakened considerably in the
