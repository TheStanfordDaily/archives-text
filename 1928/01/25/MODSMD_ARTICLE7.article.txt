### 
Action upon the proposed Endow
ment Fund for the graduating class
was deferred at the meeting of the
senior class held yesterday afternoon.
As a quorum was not present a sug
gestion was proposed that the ac
ceptance or rejection of the plan be
postponed until the next meeting.
Harry Call, appointed to investigate
the Endowment plan used last year
by the Class of 1927, reported that
the insurance plan for raising funds
is unfavorably regarded by Univer
sity authorities and, as a consequence,
the senior class would do best to con
sider the Endowment Plan.
The proposed plan, as described by
Call, provides for the voluntary sign
ing of pledges by graduating members
of the class to pay a Bmall sum an
nually to the fund. Last year's class
left the disposal of this fund to the
"discretion of the University," though,
as Call pointed out, the 1928 fund may
ho used for any purpose at the choice
of the class.
Class dues wore set at two dollars
by a motion on the part of the treas
urer, Henry Keyes. Collection of these
dues will begin soon.
