# VARSITY BALL SOUAD TO ENCOUNTER SEALS IN PRACTICE CONTEST
## 
### 
With the first game of the season
scheduled Saturday afternoon against
the Kenealey Seals of San Francisco,
Stanford's baseball squad is fast
rounding into shape. The Seals, a
semi-pro outfit playing in this region,
should offer plenty of competition, as
they are now practically tied for first
place in the Bay City semi-pro league.
A visit to practice shows that this
year's Stanford squad will be, in the
words of Coach Harry Wolters, "the
best defensive team Stanford has had
since 1922." The infield, composed of
practically veteran material, has
been playing air-tight ball in the
work-outs.
As a result of graduation Wolters
had to fill two of the garden jobs. Ho
has picked some fast material in
Frank Wilton, Bob Sims, and little
Jack Levin. Wilton is a regular from
last year.
The work with the willow is still
uncertain and Stanford fans will get
a line on the team's offensive ability
in the game with the Seals on Satur
day. Sobieski will probably get the
first call for mound duty. Wolters will
also give Doug Lewis and possibly
Bob Philippi a try at the pitching.
