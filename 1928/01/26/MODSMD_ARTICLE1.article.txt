# STANFORD MAY USE TWO GRID TEAM SYSTEM
## Coach Warner Is Considering Adoption of Variation Of Big Ten Plan CHANGE NOT DEFINITE Cardinal Mentor Points Out Possible Advantages Of Innovation

The Pacific Coast version of the Big
Ten two-team rage exploded yesterday
afternoon in the midst of an unsuspect
ing football populace. According to an
nouncements broadcast all over America,
Coach Pop Warner will prepare two
Stanford varsities for 1928 football com
petition.
Warner, however, when interviewed
last night, was quick to disclai many defi
nite plans. He was perfectly willing to
admit that lie had the change under con
sideration, but as far as any final deci
sions are concerned—football is eight
months away.
Unlike Big Ten Plan
The Stanford coach made clear that
he did not approve in any way of the
system being installed in the Middle
West, whereby two teams would repre
sent a university, each playing a game
every Saturday, one on the campus and
one away from home. Warner would
have two teams, but only one would
meet an opponent.
If the present plan is carried out, at
the start of the season, one eleven, Team
A, would lie formed mostly of seniors—
men who are playing their last year of
collegiate football. Another eleven, Team
B, would consist primarily of sopho
mores and juniors. If the occasion arises,
Warner would shift men from one team
to another. *
Teams Nearly Equal
Under the prevalent system, an ordi
nary conference opponent feels naturally
slighted in playing what is termed a
"second team." On the other hand, there
can be not the faintest possibility for in
sult in sending a B team on the field,
since the name of the team has abso
lutely no significance as to its power.
By the end of the season, after much
shifting and rearranging, either one or
the other of the two teams will have
demonstrated its superiority, and, says
Warner, will be chosen to play in the
iinal game of the year. But as to the
rumor that the A and B elevens will
play on strictly alternate Saturdays—the
Stanford mentor says such a procedure
would be foolish.
Many Lettermen Left
The principal advantage would consist
in having an experienced team, composed
mostly of lettermen, that would not suf
fer by graduation.
Objections raised are that attendance
and finances would suffer bccause of the
inferior drawing power of a B team, and
that conference relationships might be
severely disrupted. But as Warner point
ed out, both A and B elevens would be
of practically the same caliber. And then
as to what other college teams might do,
Warner merely remarked, "I don't care."
