# HARD BASEBALL TILT PROMISED CARDINALS BY KENEALEY SEALS
## 
### 
Competition aplenty will face Stan
ford's varsity baseballers this Satur
day afternoon wlien they meet the
Kenealey Seals of San Francisco in
the first, game of the season. Two San
Francisco Seal players, two Western
Leaguers, and other seasoned players
of experience will furnish Stanford
fans with some A No. 1 baseball. As
a club the Kenealey Seals are first
raters, being tied for first place in the
Bay City winter league.
Hutchison, who chucked against the
Cardinals with Cliff Ireland's Inde
pendents last year, will face the Stan
ford batters again. About his ability,
it will be remembered that he allowed
the Cardinal batsmen but two hits.
Maloney at second base and Hand
ley at Shortstop have both had their
signatures on Western League sta
tionery. Johnson, center field, and
Schinski, left field, are now with the
San Francisco Seals. Schinski was
formerly with Logan of the Utah-
Idaho League.
With Broadnerkle, catcher; Best,
first base; Devereaux, third base; and
Bailey, right field, completing the
line-up, it is evident that the Cardinal
outfit will be put to a real test. Last
year Cliff Ireland's Independents took
the measure of the local liorsehiders
in good fashion. From the showing at
practice the outlook is a little
brighter.
