## 
### 
"Pop" Warner declared yester
day that he is in favor of the
proposed amendment to the stu
dent body constitution which
will allow the football coach to
recommend three players, other
than those who have gained their
letters by playing the required
time in the specified games, for
football block "S" letters at the
end of each season.
Warner stated that he is in
favor of the proposed amend
ment because in some years
exigencies arise that make it un
fair for only one man to be eligi
ble to a block letter upon recom
mendation by the coach and
graduate manager. This, he be
lieves, will give the coach more
latitude. Probably three men will
not always be recommended for
letters, according to "Pop."
