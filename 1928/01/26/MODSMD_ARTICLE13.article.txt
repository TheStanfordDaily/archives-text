# FRESHMAN FIVE WINS CLOSE CONTEST FROM FAST TARZAN TEAM
## Stockton Quint Best Coached, Speediest Squad Babes Have Encountered 
### 
Stanford University's dreams of an
undefeated freshman basketball team
swayed and all but tottered last night
when the babes narrowly escaped a drub
bing at the hands of the Stockton Higli
School quintet, nosing their opponents
out only in the last few minutes of play
to win 28 to 21.
The Tarzan five was the speediest and
best coached of all those that have faced
the Cardinal freshmen this year, passing,
dribbling, and pivoting their way through
the Stanford defense during the entire
game. Garrigan, a Stockton forward and
the smallest player on cither team, was
the individual star of the contest, taking
high point honors with 9 tallies to his
credit.
Babes Get Good Start
The babes got away to a good start
in the first quarter when a pass the en
tire length of the floor from Reynolds
to Moffat gave the latter a chance at
[an easy shot from under the Stockton
goal. The period ended 6 to 1 in the
freshmen's favor. Jn the first of the
second quarter the Stocktonites tightened
up and tied the score at 6-6; however, the
babes were able to score three more bas
kets before the end of the half to their
opponents' one.
The third quarter was a repetition of
the second, the visitors quickly ticing the
score again, this time at 12-12, and the
Stanfordites forging ahead to finish the
quarter with a two-point lead* 18-16.
the middle of the last period the high
school men evened the score for the third
time at 20-20. For the moment a Stan
ford defeat seemed imminent, but a last
minute scoring streak on the part of the
freshmen disheartened their opponents
and allowed them to pile up a lead of
7 points before the end of the game.
Mears, Hawkins Star
Mears and Hawkins played well for
Stanford, scoring 7 and 6 points re
spectively. Hawkins was probably the
steadier of the two, doing equally well
both on offense and defense; while
Mears' shooting was more accurate than
that of his teammates.
Reynolds and Tampcke had a great
deal of trouble keeping between the
shifty Stockton forwards and the basket,
allowing several sucker shots. Reynolds
aiso played in the pivot position during
a small part of the contest, Mears going
to forward and Hawkins to guard.
Following is a summary of the game:
Stanford Position Stockton
Mears (7) C Roberts (1)
Hawkins (6) F Todrcsic (1)

out only in the last few minutes of play
to win 28 to 21.
The Tarzan five was the speediest and
best coached of all those that have faced
the Cardinal freshmen this year, passing,
dribbling, and pivoting their way through
the Stanford defense during the entire
game. Garrigan, a Stockton forward and
the smallest player on cither team, was
the individual star of the contest, taking
high point honors with 9 tallies to his
credit.
Babes Get Good Start
The babes got away to a good start
in the first quarter when a pass the en
tire length of the floor from Reynolds
to Moffat gave the latter a chance at
[an easy shot from under the Stockton
goal. The period ended 6 to 1 in the
freshmen's favor. Jn the first of the
second quarter the Stocktonites tightened
up and tied the score at 6-6; however, the
babes were able to score three more bas
kets before the end of the half to their
opponents' one.
The third quarter was a repetition of
the second, the visitors quickly ticing the
score again, this time at 12-12, and the
Stanfordites forging ahead to finish the
quarter with a two-point lead* 18-16.
the middle of the last period the high
school men evened the score for the third
time at 20-20. For the moment a Stan
ford defeat seemed imminent, but a last
minute scoring streak on the part of the
freshmen disheartened their opponents
and allowed them to pile up a lead of
7 points before the end of the game.
Mears, Hawkins Star
Mears and Hawkins played well for
Stanford, scoring 7 and 6 points re
spectively. Hawkins was probably the
steadier of the two, doing equally well
both on offense and defense; while
Mears' shooting was more accurate than
that of his teammates.
Reynolds and Tampcke had a great
deal of trouble keeping between the
shifty Stockton forwards and the basket,
allowing several sucker shots. Reynolds
aiso played in the pivot position during
a small part of the contest, Mears going
to forward and Hawkins to guard.
Following is a summary of the game:
Stanford Position Stockton

Hawkins (6) F Todrcsic (1)

Stanford University's dreams of an
undefeated freshman basketball team

when the babes narrowly escaped a drub

to win 28 to 21.
