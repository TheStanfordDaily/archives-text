sented. As a result of yesterday's and
Tuesday's preliminaries, four men are
left in each weight. Drawings will be
held today to determine how the four
pair off. Fourteen semi-finals will de
cide which two men finish in the
seven final bouts.

former amateur middleweight cham
pion of Australia, will alternate as
referee. Both are well-known to Stan
ford. Jake Irwin, three years middle
weight champion of Stanford, and
Myron Sprague will officiate as
judges.
Four preliminaries yesterday fin
ished the elimination for tonight's
matches. Kenaston won from De-
Lucchi in the lightheavyweight class.
In the middleweights, Mendenhall lost
to McNamara in a slow bout. The
freshman president decisively won
after battling to a draw with the same
adversary in the Tuesday prelimi
naries.
Frost, showing fast floorwork and
using a steady attack of punches to
the head, outclassed Malcolm, welter
weight. The latter spurted in the
third round, but lost to the more ag
gressive Frost. Sands was given a
decision in the second round over
King, also welterweights.
