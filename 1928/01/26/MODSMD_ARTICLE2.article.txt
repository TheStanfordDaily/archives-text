Phi Delta Theta and Kappa Alpha
still maintain their one thousand per
cent averages in the Intramural Bas
ketball Tournament after the third
round games played yesterday. The
Bluebirds, 1927 intramural cham
pions and considered favorites to re
peat, met their first defeat by a mar- i
gin of a single point.
Kappa Alpha's fight earned for them
a 12-11 victory in a hotly contested
game with the Bluebirds. The losers
started like a whirlwind and had nine
points to their credit when the half
was called. At the opening of the
third period, Kappa Alpha unleashed
a steady scoring attack which netted
them five additional points and vic
tory as they held their opponents
down to one goal. Both teams were
well-drilled and played gracefully,
despite the fact that the referee was
compelled to call a number of person
al fouls at the start of the contest
for roughness on the part of over
enthusiastic players. Kirk, Kappa
Alpha's star, playing with an injury
received in the early minutes of play,
gave spectators a display of game
ness and fight in addition to sharing
scoring honors with his teammate,
Pease. Klabau, husky center, and Far
mer shone for the Bluebirds.
Chi Psi defeated Encina IE by a
21-6 score in a clean, fast game. With
the freshmen only one point behind
Chi Psi in the third quarter, the row j
men were forced to open their op
ponents' defense and shoot more ac- j
curately to gain a lead. The rally i
that followed wilted the hall men. !
King, center for Chi Psi, scored 13
points. Thomas was outstanding in
the Encina line-up.
Encina 4W entered a sloppy team
that took a 29-fi drubbing from El
Cuadro. The offensive strength of El
Cuadro was greatly buoyed up by the
Encina team's weakness in defense.
The winners employed an effective
bounce-pass that had the green fresh
man quintet completely baffled. West
smith, lean and rangy center, scored
.16 points for the clubmen, but did
not outplay his teammate Churchill.
Four of the freshmen's six points
were scored by free throws after
fouls.

Kappa Alpha's fight earned for them
a 12-11 victory in a hotly contested
game with the Bluebirds. The losers
started like a whirlwind and had nine
points to their credit when the half
was called. At the opening of the
third period, Kappa Alpha unleashed
a steady scoring attack which netted
them five additional points and vic
tory as they held their opponents
down to one goal. Both teams were
well-drilled and played gracefully,
despite the fact that the referee was
compelled to call a number of person
al fouls at the start of the contest
for roughness on the part of over
enthusiastic players. Kirk, Kappa
Alpha's star, playing with an injury
received in the early minutes of play,
gave spectators a display of game
ness and fight in addition to sharing
scoring honors with his teammate,
Pease. Klabau, husky center, and Far
mer shone for the Bluebirds.
Chi Psi defeated Encina IE by a
21-6 score in a clean, fast game. With
the freshmen only one point behind
Chi Psi in the third quarter, the row j
men were forced to open their op
ponents' defense and shoot more ac- j
curately to gain a lead. The rally i
that followed wilted the hall men. !
King, center for Chi Psi, scored 13
points. Thomas was outstanding in
the Encina line-up.
Encina 4W entered a sloppy team
that took a 29-fi drubbing from El
Cuadro. The offensive strength of El
Cuadro was greatly buoyed up by the
Encina team's weakness in defense.
The winners employed an effective
bounce-pass that had the green fresh
man quintet completely baffled. West
smith, lean and rangy center, scored
.16 points for the clubmen, but did
not outplay his teammate Churchill.
Four of the freshmen's six points
were scored by free throws after
fouls.
