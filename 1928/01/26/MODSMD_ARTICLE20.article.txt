! Cook, Richards, and in'the second half,
1 Berg feeding the ball to him. The Car
! dinal guards, Rothert and Thompson, in
an air-tight defense game, stole plenty
lof plunder from the St. Ignatius for
wards. This pair grabbed the ball off of
the backboard as soon as it had re
bounded and passed it out of danger to
the fast-moving Stanford forwards.
Maloney and Bareilles, star forwards
of the .Gray Fog team, were always dan
gerous and caused much excitement
among the 4,000 fans when they tried
their long-distance shots near the close
of the game. Maloney as high-point man
1 for the opposition with eight points.
Stanford Starts Slow
Hunt's men had a hard time to get
! going when the game opened, and the
S leading side changed six times during
i the first half. Smalling made three bas
| kcts from sucker shots, the rest of the
Cardinals' tallies resulting from four
successful free throws. There were sev
enteen fouls called in this half of the
game, and Richards was sent out on four
personals.

the backboard as soon as it had re
bounded and passed it out of danger to
the fast-moving Stanford forwards.

of the .Gray Fog team, were always dan
gerous and caused much excitement

of the game. Maloney as high-point man
1 for the opposition with eight points.
