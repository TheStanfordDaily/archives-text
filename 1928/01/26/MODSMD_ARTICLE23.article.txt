# Plainly Stated
## 
### 
Yesterday the Men's Council issued a formal statement relative to the
automobile control regulations in force on the campus. The Daily takes
great pleasure in publishing this statement and appending once more the
full set of regulations and fines. It will be seen that the Daily and the
Council have been working towards the same end in attempting to clarify
matters for the students. If, as the Council says, the opinions which the
Daily has obtained have caused confusion, we regret the matter ex
ceedingly.
"Now that student control of traffic problems has been put in operation
for a tentative period of trial, it seems good policy to again publish the
regulations which have been adopted.
"This seems especially necessary since the Stanford Daily assumed the
burden of obtaining interpretations, which is commendable, thus confusing
certain statements of the Council concerning traffic laws. For the benefit
of those students who may be interested the Council is reprinting the regula
tions adopted which are in accord with the State laws, and would advise
those further interested to consult for opinions the members of the Council.
"It is to be noted that until a test case is made no statement is issued
by the Council as to its exact limits of authority, but that all fines and
penalties are made as an option, the student having the choice of abiding by
the regulations of University authorities or withdrawing registration and
being tried by state courts in accordance with his rights of due process.
"That speeding is the greatest evil which the regulations are intended
to curb will be seen by the penalties regarding it. Fifteen mile zones now
include stop sign intersections
"The above statement is given wtih the greatest respect for the Stanford
Daily and its value to the Campus."
Particular attention is directed to the statement above that "fifteen
mile zones now include stop sign intersections." The Daily, since the
Men's Council has declared its stand on the matter of automobile regula
tions, now supports their enforcement as they are stated by the Men's
Council.
