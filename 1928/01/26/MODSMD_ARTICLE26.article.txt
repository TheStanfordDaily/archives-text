IN DEFENSE OF TIRED SPiNES
For four years we have patiently
suffered —anil for many times v four
years others have suffered —the in
comprehensible seating afforded by
the buildings of the Inner Quadrangle.
Long ago grown weary of spending
(he lecture periods making vain ef
forts to be comfortable, we would
prefer to suffer no longer, and so re
spectfully hope that funds to re
place the ancient hard benches, with
their gingerbread ironwork and unre
lenting backs reminiscent of the days
of 1890, with modern, comfortable
chairs be forthcoming in the near
future.

This request is not at all unreason
able. We can cheerfully put up with
an assembly hall which does justice
to a third-rate high school, because
new halls cost thousands of dollars,
but the amount needed to do away
with these antiques and purchase new
equipment would be reasonably mod
est.
It is with much pleasure that we
learn from Mr. Roth that funds will
be available beginning probably next
year for replacement purposes. If
nothing arises to sidetrack this cause,
the freshman class can look forward
to a comfortable senior year.
