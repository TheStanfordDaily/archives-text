TRANSITION by Will Durant; Simon
& Schuster.
This book cannot be called a liter
ary gem, but it can be honored as a
poem of life from a man who has
plumbed the depths of existence by
merging his own struggling soul with
that great pulsating ocean of souls
called humanity.
Will Durant has found that life's
music is a paean, not a dirge. He is
essentially a philosopher of hope, of
refounded hope, as he explains in his
final chapter. His hopefulness is that
of youth.
"Transition" is not a chronicle of
extraordinary experiences, though
many are unusual. All are probed,
assimilated, drained of their vigor,
and quickly applied to subsequent ac
tions with fine persistency and exem
plary devotion to the author's highest
ideals.
The greater portion of Dr. Durant's
mental autobiography discusses Amer
ica: the America of boundless physi
cal energy and potential spiritual
power. Readers of every shade of
political opinion will find his views to
be those of the true patrio. "Transi
tion" here reflects capacity to view
and estimate factors in national
growth free from regional racial or
personal prejudice. In his experiences
the author finds no cause for sorrow
or dismal forebodings. He turns to the
most elemental and natural human
acts as holding in themselves assur
ance of present as well as future hap
piness.
Will Durant is known as a philoso
pher. He is great as a philosopher be
cause he is great in his own right as
a human being. He knows men and
he knows himself. It is this supreme
knowledge which enables him to per
ceive and portray for us "the passion
of life for growth and greatness, the
drama of everlasting creation."

Rupert Hughes has written "George
Washington" by William Morrow &
Co., and in the first paragraph we see
an answer to some of the criticisms
of his first book on"the father of our
country." "It is the most tragic of
farces that so many Americans should
insist that Washington could not tell
a lie."
There is much justice in Mr.
Hughes' sharp observation, for it is
to be feared that his critics, in gen

eral, know much less about Washing
ton than he does. Much of their re
sentment appears to he based largely
on hearsay and an uninstructed chau
vinism rather than on a careful study
of his work.
Whoever reads this book will know
why Washington was great. He will
see the man in consecutive action, not
at isolated moments of dramatic
splendor. Mr. Hughes is to be con
gratulated on a complete picture—
and the reader who is not satisfied
with his own lazy impressions will
it. —E.L.S.
