I feel so much better this morn
ing, really I do. And do you know
why? It is because I don't have
to change my name. It will be so
much nicer if I can just say
things I really feel like. I mean,
without putting anything down
that is too collegiate.
A professor told me that Stan
ford was the least collegiate uni
versity that he knew about. And
I think that he is just about right.
Because one never sees those ter
ribly striped blazers and plus
fours that are so advertised for
colleges in the magazines.
And the co-eds really aren't ex
actly co-eds; that is, they don't
seem to be. Of course, I can't say
what they are except by the way
they act on the Quad and in gym
classes.
And surely the interests of this
campus are far above the colle
giate ones. I mean, here we seri
ously experiment and discuss the
important questions of the day.
Like prohibition, and marriage,
and government, and all sorts of
systems.
I find it perfectly fascinating to
watch all these experiments and
things. I mean, every intellectual
girl wants to see and try every
thing once so that she will be able
to know what everything is all
about. That is, no serious-minded
young person likes to be told that
she is mistaken about anything.
And if I had more inches I
would tell you just exactly how
I feel about women's rights and
equality, etc., but I guess that
will have to wait until some other
day.
