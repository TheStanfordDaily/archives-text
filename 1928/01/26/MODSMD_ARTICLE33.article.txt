NEW YORK, Jan. 25—U.P.)—A
mighty gale came out of the West
today, smashed New York with a 70-
mile momentum, injured scores of
persons, and left a wide swath of
debris and disorder in its wake.
The storm played devastating tricks
with harbor shipping at times. The
winds sent spray 30 feet high on the
Battery sea wall.
Many are known to have been in
jured. Fear exists for the lives of at
least eight, believed buried in the
ruins of an eleven-story factory
wrecked by the collapse of a 75,000-
gallon water tank, which plunged
through the roof, bringing down tons
of machinery.
