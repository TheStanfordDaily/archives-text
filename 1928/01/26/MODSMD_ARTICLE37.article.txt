# NEAR EAST COLLEGES INFLUENCE ON WORLD PEACE, AVERS FISHER
## Object Is to Give Students Education on Style of Western World 
### Elsa Krotozyner 
"One of the greatest influences of
the colleges in Constantinople is their
effect upon international goodwill and
peace." This is the conclusion of
Edgar J. Fisher, Dean of Robert Col
lege in Constantinople, who is now
Avith the Stanford History department.
Robert College is an American in
stitution located about six miles out
side of the city of Constantinople,
overlooking the Bosporus at its nar
rowest point. It was founded in 1863
by Christopher Rhinelander Robert,
an American philanthropist. The col
lege is under a private board of trus
tees, and is operated very much like
the universities over here, explains
Professor Fisher.
Object Told
"The general object of the college
is to give young men of that part of
the world a liberal education on the
style of the western world. There are
usually about twenty to twenty-five
different nationalities represented at
this school, and at present the Turks
have the greatest number.
"In connection with the college is
the Academy, whose work is to pre
pare the student for his studies and
to teach him English, for all the in
struction is carried on in this lan
guage. There are about 750 students
now enrolled at the College, Academy,
and the Engineering School.
"Great emphasis is laid upon ath
letics. Robert College has had much
influence in this line on other institu
tions throughout the Balkans. Basket
ball, track, and association football
are the main sports. The forms of
competition are chiefly interclass,
rather than intercollegiate. This af
fords the chance for a greater number
of students to compete."
No Fraternities
There are no fraternities or the
usual American club systems in Con
stantinople, according to Dr. Fisher.
The students live in dormitories.
"About half of our students are board
ers at the college. The rest are known
as 'Externs.' The only types of or
ganizations that the eastern students
have are literary societies, dramatic
clubs, and debating societies. They
are particularly keen for dramatics."
Fisher says that a number of young
teachers go out each year from the
United States to instruct at Con
stantinople. "At present," he states,
"there are teachers from many col
leges in America. Princeton leads in
number, and there are representa
tives from Dartmouth, the University
of Washington, and others. However,
nobody should go to the East who
does not intend to stay," he concluded.
"There is a saying that 'People who
drink the waters of the Bosporus will
never be content anywhere else.' The
East has a charm and a fascination
about it that draws men back."
