DESTRUCTIVE DESIGNS
Ernie Brandsten makes no bones
about the fact that his swimmers are
out to smash the short course swim
ming records of the Pacific Coast Con
ference now claimed by the Univer
sity of Oregon when they jump into
the San Jose Y.M.C.A. tank this eve
ning. The Oregon Webfooters have a
60-foot tank and have set their marks
in it, while the Cards practice and
compete in 100-foot tanks, so that
their times are considered to be in
different classes. Stanford holds all
the P.C.C. long course records, and
the abilities of Captain Van Den
Akker's fellow natators give rise to
the possibility that the Cardinals will
return from San Jose with a flock of
new honors.
* * *
Reg Harrison and Vanden
Akker are to enter the 40-yard
and the 100-yard free-style to set
the records; Driggs will enter the
back-strokeßramel the 220 free
style; Cundall, Ophuls, West, and
Littlefield the 200-yard breast
stroke; Bramel and Kincaid the
440; and Harrison, VandenAkker,
Driggs, and Bramel the 160-yard
relay.
* * *
Harrison, Driggs, Bramel, and
Throndson are all expected by
Brandsten to place in the Nation
al Intercollegiate swimming meet
at the University of Pennsylvania
in March. They are the class of
a strong Stanford team.
* • *
POLO TEAM IS STRONG
Ernie's water polo squad is good
again this year, also. Led by Captain
Cal Strong, who is shooting in prac
tice with bullet-like speed, the team
is considered able to give even the
Olympic Club seven a run for honors.
Maltby, Burns, Vanden Akker, and
Strong are the four veterans return
ing to the squad, while Harrison,
Throndson, Bramel, and Driggs are
the new stars.

news bulletin concerning (he Bear
swimming team:

440; and Harrison, VandenAkker,
Driggs, and Bramel the 160-yard
relay.

Harrison, Driggs, Bramel, and
Throndson are all expected by
Brandsten to place in the Nation
al Intercollegiate swimming meet
at the University of Pennsylvania
in March. They are the class of
a strong Stanford team.

POLO TEAM IS STRONG
Ernie's water polo squad is good
again this year, also. Led by Captain
Cal Strong, who is shooting in prac
tice with bullet-like speed, the team
is considered able to give even the
Olympic Club seven a run for honors.
Maltby, Burns, Vanden Akker, and
Strong are the four veterans return
ing to the squad, while Harrison,
Throndson, Bramel, and Driggs are
the new stars.

HUMOROUS NOTE
This is to laugh: Item from
University of California sport
news bulletin concerning (he Bear
swimming team:
"The Bears are conceded an
excellent chance of downing the
Stanford team, victor over Cali
fornia for several consecutive
seasons."
—Templeton Peck.
DESTRUCTIVE DESIGNS
Ernie Brandsten makes no bones
about the fact that his swimmers are
out to smash the short course swim
ming records of the Pacific Coast Con
ference now claimed by the Univer
sity of Oregon when they jump into
the San Jose Y.M.C.A. tank this eve
ning. The Oregon Webfooters have a
60-foot tank and have set their marks
in it, while the Cards practice and
compete in 100-foot tanks, so that
their times are considered to be in
different classes. Stanford holds all
the P.C.C. long course records, and
the abilities of Captain Van Den
Akker's fellow natators give rise to
the possibility that the Cardinals will
return from San Jose with a flock of
new honors.

Reg Harrison and Vanden
Akker are to enter the 40-yard
and the 100-yard free-style to set
the records; Driggs will enter the
back-strokeßramel the 220 free
style; Cundall, Ophuls, West, and
Littlefield the 200-yard breast
stroke; Bramel and Kincaid the
440; and Harrison, VandenAkker,
Driggs, and Bramel the 160-yard
relay.
