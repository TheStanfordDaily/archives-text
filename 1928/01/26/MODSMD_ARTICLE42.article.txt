# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The man behind the huge annual in
door atldctic carnival known as the Mill
rose Games, in which so many world's
records have been set, is quite naturally
an athlete himself and a man whose ath
letic career has been so wide and varied
as to make him invaluable in arranging
the biggest indoor track meet of each
season.
John G. Anderson, who, as chairman
of the athletic committee of the Millrose
Athletic Association, has attended to all
the details and scouted the country for
the best track and field talent available
for the club's annual games, which will
be held in Madison Square Garden on
February 2, has an enviable athletic rec
ord in four sports. At Amherst, he was
a member of the cross-country and base
ball teams and captain of the basketball
team, but it is in gold that the name of

Anderson is so well known in England,
France, and America, bccause of the fact
that he has been a tournament player for
a quarter of a century and has amassed
the prodigious total of nearly 400 first
prizes, including more than 50 recognized
championships.
Back in 1903 Mr. Anderson first at
tracted notice by winning the Western
Massachusetts golf title. In 1911 he was
a finalist in the French amateur tourna
ment, and in 1913 and 1915 he reached
the last round in the United States ama
teur. In 1924 and 1926 lie won the French
amateur championship. Included among
his other honors are those of being chos
en on the Leslie Cup team for twenty-one
years, and representing the United States
against Canada in 1918 and 1919.
There's very little this man Anderson
doesn't know about golf—or putting on
indoor track meets.
