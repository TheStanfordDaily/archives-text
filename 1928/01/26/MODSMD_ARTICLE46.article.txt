# VARSITY FRESHMAN MERMEN WILL MAKE RECORD TRY TONIGHT
## 
### 
Seven Stanford varsity swimmers
and a team of five freshman paddlers
will enter the water of the San Jose
Y.M.O.A. pool at 7:80 o'clock this eve
ning in an attempt to smash the
dozen Pacific Coast Conference rec
ords held by Oregon colleges for 60-
foot tanks.
All the present short course rec
ords are held by mermen from either
University of Oregon or Oregon State
College. The Cardinal team has not
made any championship attempts in
the shorter pool, due to the lack of
them in this part of the state. Coach
Ernst Brandsten is willing to say
that his charges are due to break
several of these marks.
Harrison and Vanden Akker of the
varsity will try for the 40-yard free
style—time, 19.8, held by Oregon
State. The same men will swim the
100-yard free-style—time 57 flat, also
held by Oregon. Driggs will try for the
220 free-style record of 2:40.4, held by
0.5.C., and Bramel will go after the
440-yard free-style mark of G:O7, held
by the same outfit.
The 150-yard back-stroke of 2:05.4,
held by the University of Oregon, is
to be threatened by Driggs, and the
220-yard breast-stroke record, time
2:57, held by the Webfoot team, will
be attempted by Ophuls, West, and
Cundall.
Pete Desjardins, Sandy Smith,
"Whitey" Burns, Walter Brown, and
another man not yet chosen, will en
deavor to break live freshman rec
ords.
Dave Fall, Ed Throndson, Walter
Mills, and Bert Marsh will give a div
ing exhibition. Only two of them will
represent the varsity, as Fall is a
graduate, and Marsh a freshman.
Cars will leave the postoffice at
6:30 o'clock this evening.
