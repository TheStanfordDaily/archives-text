Harvard University — (P.1,P.) —
A group of English university stu
dents touring the United States have
condemned "cutting in at dances" as
this country's greatest vice.
"It's dashed bad stuff," they de
clared to a reporter from the Harvard
Crimson. "You would get chucked out
of an English dance for such a steal.
Why can't you rush a real stunner for
a minute without getting broken up
by some lad. It's a regular scrim!
And I say, if you aren't careful do
you know, you might trot away the
whole night with one partner. On and
off schedule is our ticket. Lots better."
