HAVANA, Jan. 25.—(U.P.)—Ani
mated by the "purest cordiality,"
Mexico launched a campaign today to
lessen the now dominant influence of
the United States in Pan-American af
fairs and to make the Pan-American
union the symbol of perfect demo
cracy.
Salvador Urbina, Mexican Delegate
to the Sixth Pan-American Confer
ence, said the twenty-one American
Republics in the Union all should be
on an equal plane. His proposal to
change the Union's organization met
with little favor.
