# John Henry Nash, Famed Printer, States California Typographers Rank Among Foremost In World
## 
### 
"California printers rank among the
finest In the world today," declared
John Henry Nash, noted typographer,
in his talk at the open meeting of the
English Club last night in the Wo- ;
men's Clubhouse. "They are conscious- j
ly seeking beauty, and uniting this '
purpose with the same strength I
shown in the architecture of the J
West."
Nash stated that printing is the one
art which was born complete; every
other has gone through amateur
stages, but there have been no radi
cal developments in the art of print
ing. He showed a page from Guten
berg's Bible, the first book ever
printed, which is still perfect and
beautiful. This Bible, incidentally,
was printed on a made-over wine- |
press.
Nicholas Jensen, born in the early
fifteenth century, has had more in- !
fluence than any other man on mod
ern typography, said Nash.'He printed
what many consider the most beauti- j
ful book in the world, and the first
divorced from the pen effect of the !
scribes. Jensen placed fine spacing
over accurate spelling in his books, !
and dropped letters when they spoiled
the symmetry.
Among the valuable books in the
collection that Nash brought with him j
to the meeting was a volume printed j
by Radolt at about the same time
with the original leather-covered oak
binding. Nash mentioned the work of
Zaner, the first to print woodblocks
in with the type, which was a real
innovation.
For over a hundred years from the
middle of the eighteenth century till
the time of William Morris, there was
no good work in typography, declared
Nash. Morris had the idea he wanted
his own books printed differently, and
so started his own press, which be
gan a renaissance in the art of print
ing. He copied Jensen's type forms, ;
and soon after Cobden-Sanderson, in
the Doves Press whose great Bible is ;
;
in the Bender Collection of the Uni- J
versity Library, also copied Jensen's
forms with beautiful results.
Nash explained that he himself was 1
not a quantity printer; his work is I
done in small editions which he takes
plenty of time to finish. Much of the j
actual handwork in typesetting is
done by Nash; it is his custom to
put in eight hours a day at work in
his press. Neither he nor his em
ployes work overtime, as do other !
famous printing houses, and today j
his work is internationally famous,
though he has never advertised.
I
A prize for the best printing in the I
world has been awarded for the last !
two years. Both of his subjects were j
four-color half-tones, in which he likes |
to experiment. The effect he obtains I
is totally unlike that of ordinary |
printing through screens; the two j
examples he brought to the Club re-!
sembled oil paintings.
