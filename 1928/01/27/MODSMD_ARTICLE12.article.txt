# Cardinals Face Winged '0' Five Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
With its stock taking a sudden
boom on the basketball market be
cause of three successive victories,
Stanford will play its fourth game
within one week's time against the
Olympic Club tomorrow night in the
Pavilion. The Cards have no tilt
scheduled for tonight.
The Olympians have a basketball
team they are planning to put up as
a championship contender at the Na
tional A.A.U. tournament in Kansas
City this March, and are leaving no
stone unturned to be able to enter
their men with the strongest possible
record behind them. The Tulsa Eagles,
the Hillyards, and the University of
Nevada are the only fives to have
beaten the Winged "O" to date.
Of special interest to Stanford is
that the Olympic star player, Nip
Mcl-lose, will be fighting against his
Alma Mater when he takes his for
ward position tomorrow night. Nip
was on the Cardinal varsity squad in
1923 and 1924 and captained it the
last year he was here. Critics say he
is in better form than he was in col
lege days. Even the all-American de
fense system of the Hillyards, na
tional champs, was unable to keep
him in the background when it came
to dropping shou- in the bucket.
Minor on Par With McHose
On a par with the former Stanford
star is Gene Minor, who provides the
second half of the noted Minor-Mc-
Hose scoring combination. Dixon,
guard, has been responsible for giving
this pair the ball for its shooting
orgies.
Coach Husky Hunt probably will
start the five men that have figured
outstandingly in the last three games.
None of them has had previous var
sity experience, but they are shaping
up to look like veterans, at least by
the account they gave of themselves
in Wednesday night's game.
Card Guards Burly
Besides the Berg-to-Cook and Cook
to-Smalling combinations, Rothert and
Thompson, members of last year's
freshman team, spoiled the evening
for Malonay and Bareilles with their
crack basket-shooting. Both of the
Cardinal guards are of the football
type and generally got the ball off of
the backboard when they went after
it.
The probable starting line-ups are:
Stanford: Richards, 112; Cook, 112;
Smalling, c; Rothert, g; Thompson, g.
Olympic Club: McHose, 112; Minor, 112;
Morrisey, c; Toso, g; Dixon, g.
