### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26.— (U.P.)—
The dull task of selecting a jury capa
ble of deckling whether he was in
sane when he abducted, murdered,
and mutilated Marion Parker occu
pied the entire second session of the
trial of William Edward Hickman.
And the rale of progress indicated
the same procedure—tiresome repeti
tion of questions by defense and from
prospective jurors annoying answers
differing only in grammatical errors
—would continue through tomorrow
and maybe the middle of noxt week.
When court adjourned tonight
twelve temporary veniremen were in
the box but neither defense nor prose
cution had exercised any of their per
emptory challenges.
