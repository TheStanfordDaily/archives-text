# FRESHMAN BASEBALL SQUAD DISPLAYS SNAP AFTER SHORT LET-UP
## 
### 
Snappy playing on the part of Stan
ford's freshman baseball squad was
shown last night in practice in spite
of a four-night let-up because of a
muddy field. Infield practice was just
as speedy and accurate as it has al
ways been and the yearling batting
is improving remarkably. Coach
Harry Wolter is of the opinion that
this year's squad is far above the
average freshman aggregation.
A game with the Palo Alto town
team is being negotiated by Manager
Earl Harris. If the game is scheduled
it will be played next Wednesday
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock. This will
be the first opportunity for fans to
see the much-touted babe squad in
action.
Ralph Cook, the first baseman, is
showing up well. His work around
his sack is perfect and he 4s develop
ing into a hard-driving batter. Hunk
en, regular left fielder, is also a heavy
hitter. It is around these two men
that Wolter expects to build his of
fensive unit. "Spud" Hardy, diminu
tive catcher, is another slugger.
