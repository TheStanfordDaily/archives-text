NEW YORK, Jan. 26.— (U.P.)—< Ger- j
many, barred from the Olympic Games j
for the past fiften yeaVs, today was re- j
vealed as constituting the greatest threat |
to the athletic supremacy of the United j
Sates at Amsterdam in 1928.
The Germans will enter the largest
squad of any of the competing nations.
Weight of numbers will not carry off
first honors in an Olympiad, but it is an
indication that the once terrifying "thor
oughness" of Germany is being applied to
the quest of Olympic glory.
The United States usually enters the |
largest teams and carries off most of the
honors. Germany was prevented from
participating in the Seventh Olympiad at
Antwerp and in the Eighth at Paris, but 1
this year is sending a team of 282 ath
letes to Amsterdam.
In the Olympic winter sports at St.
Moritz, the Germans and French have
entered for the most events, with the
United States and Austria second.
German athletic authorities modestly
have set their caps at winning second
place at Amsterdam. Conceding the su- j
premacy of the athletes within the past i
year indicates that the former enemy na- j
tion will be a most formidable conten-1
der.
