Near the completion of the third i
round of the intramural basketball ;
tournament the Bull Pen and the j
Breakers teams in defeating Delta j
Upsilon and Phi Kappa Psi respec
tively showed form that will take |
them far in the race for the champion
ship.
With Kelly and Davis, forwards
for the Bull Pen, sinking buckets al- ;
most uncannily and tying for scoring
honors with 10 points each, the Bull j
Pen had little trouble in walking |
away with the less-experienced Delta j
Upsilon team, 34 to 6.
The Breakers quintet in a fast and
furious game trounced the Phi Kappa
Psi men to the tune of 28 to 13. While I
the losers put up a good fight all the
way, the Breakers' superior teamwork
could not be checked. Carlsmith,
Breakers, with seven free throws and
a field basket, was high-point man.
The fighting Theta Delta Chi five
defeated the Alpha Sigma Phi bas
keteers 16 to 11. The Theta Delta Chi
team overcame a six-point lead
chalked up by Ferguson of the losing
side and led after the first half to the
end of the game.

often attained by mid-season enabled
Encina 3E players to down Branner
Club 19 to 8.
The Toyon five played and defeated
the Alpha Delt team Wednesday in a
game which was scheduled for yes
terday. Zacches and Dutton were the
main factors in the hall's 10-7 win,
while Evans, star Alpha Delt guard,
was the class of the opposition.
The Delta Tau Delta five downed
the Theta Chi quintet in a fast game
to the tune of 18 to 10. The game was
fast and hard, both teams showing
an improvement in form over last j
week. Crary, Delt forward, was the (
outstanding star of the game with
eight points to his credit.

feated Delta Kappa Epsilon 9 to 7.
