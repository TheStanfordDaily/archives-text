### 
More than one thousand boxing
fans saw Dan Frost win the welter
weight medal in the novice boxing
tournament held in the Pavilion last
night. Frost won by a judges' deci
sion after three rounds of gruelling
and close mixing with A1 Doerr.
Frost landed sharp uppers in the
first round which gave him a shade
in that period. The second round was
featured by Doerr's wild overhanded
haymakers which slowed Frost con
siderably when they connected. Doerr
had his opponent slightly groggy for
a few seconds in the third and final
round and appeared (o be supporting
hini in clinches. It was a delicate de
cision for the judges to make.
Jack Kenaston and Fred La Marsna,
light-heavyweights, staged a thrilling
match for the fans. The former out
pointed and outpunched his opponent

times. The match started with slug
ging on the part of both contestants,
but developed into a swift and well
fought go after a few seconds.

puncher, took the decision from
Homer Toberman in the middle
weight. Toberman was the favorite to
take the match and remained favorite
until the last when Gage landed sev
eral right-hand blows after feinting
with his left. Toberman had the reach
on his opponent and appeared to be
the more polished boxer, but the ham
mering he took in the third round
made his strategy almost useless.
John Hromadka, a hard-hitting
lightweight, won a technical knock
out in the second period of his match
with Kenneth Jenkins. There was
more wrestling than boxing in the
first round, but in the second,
Hromadka opened up and weakened
his man with body punches.
In the featherweight class Paul
Maurer, after winning his semi-final
bout, entered the ring to meet a fresh
opponent and used his last ounce of

Crumly ir\ the final heavyweight mix
up and won in the second round with

sion after three rounds of gruelling
and close mixing with A1 Doerr.

first round which gave him a shade
in that period. The second round was

haymakers which slowed Frost con
siderably when they connected. Doerr

puncher, took the decision from

the more polished boxer, but the ham
mering he took in the third round
made his strategy almost useless.

his man with body punches.
