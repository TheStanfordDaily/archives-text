# FROST BEATS DOERR IN HARD BOUT BEFORE THOUSAND FANS
## Kenaston Drops La Marsna Three Times to Win in Light-Heavy Tilt TWO KNOCKOUTS SCORED Hromadka Takes Lightweight Title by Technical K.O. In Second Round 
### 
More than one thousand boxing
fans saw Dan Frost win the welter
weight medal in the novice boxing
tournament held in the Pavilion last
night. Frost won by a judges' deci
sion after three rounds of gruelling
and close mixing with A1 Doerr.
Frost landed sharp uppers in the
first round which gave him a shade
in that period. The second round was
featured by Doerr's wild overhanded
haymakers which slowed Frost con
siderably when they connected. Doerr
had his opponent slightly groggy for
a few seconds in the third and final
round and appeared (o be supporting
hini in clinches. It was a delicate de
cision for the judges to make.
Jack Kenaston and Fred La Marsna,
light-heavyweights, staged a thrilling
match for the fans. The former out
pointed and outpunched his opponent
to win after dropping La Marsna three
times. The match started with slug
ging on the part of both contestants,
but developed into a swift and well
fought go after a few seconds.
Walker Gage, a slow, smashing
puncher, took the decision from
Homer Toberman in the middle
weight. Toberman was the favorite to
take the match and remained favorite
until the last when Gage landed sev
eral right-hand blows after feinting
with his left. Toberman had the reach
on his opponent and appeared to be
the more polished boxer, but the ham
mering he took in the third round
made his strategy almost useless.
John Hromadka, a hard-hitting
lightweight, won a technical knock
out in the second period of his match
with Kenneth Jenkins. There was
more wrestling than boxing in the
first round, but in the second,
Hromadka opened up and weakened
his man with body punches.
In the featherweight class Paul
Maurer, after winning his semi-final
bout, entered the ring to meet a fresh
opponent and used his last ounce of
energy to win the decision from Harry
Taslijian who profited by a forfeit
earlier in the evening.
Phil Smith rushed into Harold
Crumly ir\ the final heavyweight mix
up and won in the second round with
a technical knockout.
John Sano won the bantamweight
medal from Hugh Israel with a cooler
and more scientific attack.
Fidel La Barba, former flyweight
champion of the world, and Peter
Flanagan, former Australian middle
weight champion, alternated as
referees. Jake Irwin and Myron
Sprague judged the bouts.
Semi-final results of the fights yes
terday were as follows:
Bantamweight: Hugh Israel won
from Ben Anderson, Sano from
Shreve.
