# So Much Piffle?

With the publicity given to the suggestion that "Pop" Warner may
use the "two-team" plan for Stanford's football operations next autumn,
one is inclined to wonder whether there is not more smoke than fire to
it all. Warner, in his circumspect way, disclaims any definite plans.
Furthermore, Stanford's coach expresses himself as being more in
favor of a somewhat more conservative "two-team" plan than is pro
posed in middle western universities. If many more qualifications are
made in the advance publicity given to this scheme, Stanford's "new
policy" will be more plainly disclosed as nothing but hot air.
Wle learn from sports writers that there will be changes of men from
the A to the 1> team, not in any sense of promotion or demotion of course,
but merely so that one team will finally be determined upon as the
strongest one possible for the final game of the season. Was not this
jthe process in use during the past football season? During the past
season or two Stanford has occasionally put on the field what grandstand
critics have called a "sophomore backfield." Yet these same sophomore
backs have worked in with the vague thing called the "varsity" and have
done quite well.
The chief fact that lends color to the present talk of "two-team"
plans is that the Cardinals will have a great deal of material on the
practice field next autumn and the best development of this, it is said,
will come through some modified acceptance of the "two-team" plan.
Stanford will not have a double schedule; the "tentative A and B" teams
will not play on alternate Saturdays; men may change from one of these
teams to the otherâ€”this much we know. Since the rules only permit
eleven players 011 the field at once, how, we ask you, can Stanford have
two teams any more than it did during the past season?
