There died in Lynchburg, Virginia, the other clay Mr. W. D. Diuguid,
a man who, more than any hero of Foe, was dogged into his grave by an
obsession. That fact that his name was a palindrome, that is, read the
same backward as forward, changed the life of Mr. Diuguid. For Palin
dromes, like Mary's lamb, followed him where'er he went, and since his
only fortune was a modest undertaking business, that was not far. The
only women who ever meant anything in his life were named Anna,
Meem, and Hannah. It is therefore easy to understand why Mr. Diuguid
early gave up the fight, embraced his cross, and began actually to look for
palindromes. His residence and office addresses both were number Gl6.
his telephone 11 and 333, his lodge membership card 313, and his motor
license 67,076.
It is wholly accountable that his favorite show was "Bab"; such a
man could never violate his art by going to sec Kin Tin Tin. I lis friends
began to telephone him palindromes; he needed a telephone eyeopener
to bring him out of the thesaurus hangover from the night before. But
Mr. Diuguid triumphed even in death, lingering until the eleventh hour
of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of his 77th year. It is proof
of our perverted sense of values that a life so dedicated should win only
a posthumous notoriety on the front page of the New York Times.
