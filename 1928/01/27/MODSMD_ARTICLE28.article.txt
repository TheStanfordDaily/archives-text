: LINA, Jan. 2G. â€”According to Dean
; Baker of the University of South
Carolina, the first fraternities were
formed in Athens, Greece, about the
year 220 A.D. They existed from the
time of Alexander until the fall of the
, Roman Empire. These brotherhoods
had as members students of the in
stitutions of learning of that time.
There was intense rivalry among
them. They had their rushes and
pledges practically as their survivors
do today.
The next groups, now called fra
ternities, came into being in medieval
times, about the year 1210 A.D. They
I were at the seats of learning such as
! Paris, Oxford, Prague, Leipzig, and
| others. They went under the name of
nations. The students of one language
or country banded together in a na
tion. Some of the nations were more
of a political-social character while
others were of an ethical-intellectual
nature.
