IT SEEMS TO ME—
That the itinerant clergyman, Dr.
I til Landrith, has gone a long way to
prove to the laity that the brother
hood of the ordained has a modern
sense of humor.
Dr. Landrith is the creator of the
much-heralded "courtship booths"
that have been recently introduced in
some Eastern churches. The plan is
to provide the amorously inclined
youth of the congregation with suit
able atmosphere wherein the tender
flower of courtship may blossom. The
booths have glass doors, but the pur
pose of this was not explained by the
inventor.
At first glance, the humorous as
pects of the innovation seem to leave
it devoid of any element of serious
ness —save for the few who might
care to contemplate the relative de
sirability and efficacy of the booths—
and the fireside bench, the moonlit
garden, as well as the well-parked car
—for promoting the affaires de coeur
of Young America.
Yet, on second consideration, the
innovation has a deeper significance.
It expresses the church's competitive
attitude toward the encroaching social
attractions that are offered outside
its pale. In an effort to cope with this
situation it has entered the field of
competition by providing amateur
theatricals, motion pictures, and

dances for its members —but the
scheme has met with but indifferent
success.
Institutions that provide such di
version professionally are too well or
ganized and equipped for that sole
purpose to be annoyed by the minor
efforts of the church in that direc
tion. To compete with such a spe
cialized agency it unavoidably ne
glects, in some measure, its funda
mental functions.
Broadly speaking, the church has
NO competition. It is both a means
and an end unto itself, and has a dual
aspect. It must be a source of spiritual
inspiration and yet be flexible enough
to meet the needs of a society ever
in a state of flux. It must be immuta
ble in that the source itself should
never fail, and always provide a chan
nel through which spiritual needs may
be expressed. If the church realizes
its full potentiality, those who come
in contact with it will seek and enjoy
only the good wherever it may be
found.
It seems to me that it has a noble,
but monumental, task in adequately
fulfilling these functions, and if it
does, there will be neither time nor
desire to compete with interests en
tirely outside its fundamental pur
pose.
Let the world compete with itself;
competition is no game for a church
to enter.

efforts of the church in that direc
tion. To compete with such a spe
cialized agency it unavoidably ne
glects, in some measure, its funda
mental functions.
Broadly speaking, the church has
NO competition. It is both a means
and an end unto itself, and has a dual
aspect. It must be a source of spiritual
inspiration and yet be flexible enough
to meet the needs of a society ever
in a state of flux. It must be immuta
ble in that the source itself should
never fail, and always provide a chan
nel through which spiritual needs may
be expressed. If the church realizes
its full potentiality, those who come
in contact with it will seek and enjoy
only the good wherever it may be
found.
It seems to me that it has a noble,
but monumental, task in adequately
fulfilling these functions, and if it
does, there will be neither time nor
desire to compete with interests en
tirely outside its fundamental pur
pose.
Let the world compete with itself;
competition is no game for a church
to enter.
IT SEEMS TO ME—
That the itinerant clergyman, Dr.
I til Landrith, has gone a long way to
prove to the laity that the brother
hood of the ordained has a modern
sense of humor.
Dr. Landrith is the creator of the
much-heralded "courtship booths"
that have been recently introduced in
some Eastern churches. The plan is
to provide the amorously inclined
youth of the congregation with suit
able atmosphere wherein the tender
flower of courtship may blossom. The
booths have glass doors, but the pur
pose of this was not explained by the
inventor.
At first glance, the humorous as
pects of the innovation seem to leave
it devoid of any element of serious
ness —save for the few who might
care to contemplate the relative de
sirability and efficacy of the booths—
and the fireside bench, the moonlit
garden, as well as the well-parked car
—for promoting the affaires de coeur
of Young America.
Yet, on second consideration, the
innovation has a deeper significance.
It expresses the church's competitive
attitude toward the encroaching social
attractions that are offered outside
its pale. In an effort to cope with this
situation it has entered the field of
competition by providing amateur
theatricals, motion pictures, and

dances for its members —but the
scheme has met with but indifferent
success.
Institutions that provide such di
version professionally are too well or
ganized and equipped for that sole
purpose to be annoyed by the minor
efforts of the church in that direc
tion. To compete with such a spe
cialized agency it unavoidably ne
glects, in some measure, its funda
mental functions.
