Through the cool darkness came
the silver notes of a bugle. It was
the call to arms! Roger stiffened to
attention. Visions crowded into his
mind, visions of blinking grey dawns,
dull-brown dusks that never ended,
and bronze bolts of destruction falling
from the crimson sky. In his ears the
tones of the bugle echoed and re
echoed.
Would he, the heir of all the Cox
combs, fail to go to the v defense of
his country, the country for which
six Coxcombs had wept over the most
virile onions ever tackled by a K.P.?
With astonishment Roger looked at
the dead at his feet. One by one they
were stirring from their eternal sleep,
rubbing their hollow eyes, sitting up
on elbows sharp as knife-blades.
Even Nellie sat up, her cheeks flam
ing with the same joy that was run
ning through his own veins in rivulets
of liquid fire.
Only Sally lay bound against the
wall, a pitiful figure of dejection. With
an impetuous gesture of repentance,
Roger turned to her. In a moment she
was free.
"It was only to test your love,
dearest," Roger murmured soothingly.
"I forgive you, Roger. There was
never anyone else. It had to be you."
She slid into his arms with a little
sigh of happiness.
Roger carried her down the rickety
ladder. Nellie and the erstwhile dead
followed, swaying in cadence and
gently humming the chorus of "When
The War Drums Beat No Longer." On
(hey passed, through the ranks of sol
diers at attention, past the groat flag
with its gleaming stars outlined
against the sky. As they passed, a
weeping mother stretched out her
arms to them in an agony of longing.
Then, just as the bugle's last note
died away, the man and girl, with
weaving figures of the dead a mystic
(rain behind them, passed over the
brow of the hill into the golden bowl
of the moon.â€”Finis.
