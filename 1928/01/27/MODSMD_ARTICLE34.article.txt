The right of every girl to do as
she pleases is certainly a good
one, because it really is the more
subtle sex which starts the most
radical things. I mean, just think
what has happened in the last
week.
The girls are asserting their in
dependence of something else
now. And I really believe that it
is going to be wonderful when
every one has a bicycle. Just
think of the time saved in walk
ing, I mean to classes.
And in such cases as this, short
skirts are going to be more in
vogue, because they are more
comfortable. And every girl tries
to dress for the greatest comfort.
That is, unless she will admit her
ulterior motive.
But I am wondering what the
college professors will say now
about vehicles. With automobiles
on a fast decline. I can't see what
they can object to in nice little
red and yellow bicycles for the
girls and boys. Maybe a law will
be passed telling them not to
ride two on one.
I simply can't wait until I cafl
go whizzing around the Quad in
the morning. I just adore the
cold breeze in my face, don't
you? And the new tandems are
going to be perfectly marvelous.
The only thing that worries me
is what the girls will do for
skinned noses and knees. Be
cause, after all, one has to be
come used to riding a bicycle.
