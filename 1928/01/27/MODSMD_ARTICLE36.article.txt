The Editor, Sir:
Why not make three (3) distinct
, amendments to be voted on sepa
j rately regarding the awarding of a
1 block "S"? There may be many who
favor giving men who play 15 min
utes in a post-season or intersectional
game a block "S," but who do not
wish to have the number of eligible
I receivers of "exceptional awards"
raised from one (1) to three (), or
who do not wish to have the rules be
retroactive.
Why not vote on three separate
measures, to wit:
(1) That any man who has played
fifteen (15) minutes in a post-season
or interseetional game shall be given
a block "S."
(2) That a maximum of three men
be granted a block "S" in football
whose exceptional work during the
season gives them the recommenda
tion of the captain and the football
coach, the General Manager, and the
Executive Committee.
(3) That the above shall be retro
active for the football season of 1927.
