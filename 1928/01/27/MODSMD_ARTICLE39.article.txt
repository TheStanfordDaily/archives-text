# DR. MAHR UNCOVERS BRAUNFEL'S TRAGEDY, HIDDEN FOR YEARS
## First Trace of Play Found Here; Scarch Ended in Frankfort Library 
### 
Through the efforts of I)r. August
Carl Mahr, professor of German at
Stanford, a tragedy written by Lud
wig Braunfels in 1841 has been un
covered in the Municipal Library of
Frankfort, Germany. The play, enti
tled "Agnes," was first staged in that
city. After its initial appearance the
drama disappeared.
Dr. Mahr first found a trace of the
play in the Stanford library, and,
after further searching, it was re
vealed that the only exist ing copy was
in the Municipal Library of Frank
fort-on-the-Main.
Based on this play, Dr. Mahr wrote
a thirty-page article which was pub
lished by the 1927 Yearbook of Freies
Deutsches Hochstift, Frankfort-on-the-
Main, Goethehaus. This yearbook is
issued by the museum in connection
with Goethe's birthplace.
Many of the stage details and such
others as could not be furnished at
Stanford were worked out by Dr.
Mahr in the summer of 1926 in Ger
many. The publishers of the yearbook
have agreed to make a reprint of the
play as prepared by Dr. Mahr. This
will soon be off the press; the print
ing expense is to be equally borne
by Stanford and the Goethe Museum.
The play itself reflects the political
sentiment of the period around 1840,
when there was a feeling opposed to
the reactionary tendencies of Metter
nich and related spirits. Feeling was
especially strong against Frederick
William 111 of Prussia.
Dr. Mahr is very interested in
drama and play criticism. At the pres
ent time he is completing a work of
this nature which will soon be pub
lished.
