# Construction of Masquers' Sets Now Under Way
## 
### 
Work on the sets for "The Roman
tic Young Lady," the Masquers play,
to be given February 10, is well under
way, and will probably be completed
by the middle of next week. The play
calls for two changes of sets, the
third act being laid in the same room
as the first.
The sets themselves will be carried
out in a simple manner. The first, the
living room of a house in Madrid, will
be done as though it were lived in
by a modern Spanish family, but was
an old house. An effect of thick plas
tered walls, and beamed ceiling is
being tried for.
Employ European Touch
The second act, laid in the studio of
the popular Spanish novelist, will be
done in much the same tone, although
a wrought-iron balcony will provide
contrast with the first. The doors for
this play will provide some interest,
since the attempt is being made to
imitate the typical carved Spanish
doors and panels.
In building the sets, Les Kiler, tech
nical director, is emphasizing the
European touch, rather than the
Americanized and California concep
tion of Spanish architecture. There
will be none of the balconied, over
draped sets that are usually associ
ated with Spanish style.
Work on the play itself is progress
ing rapidly. Most of the rehearsing
so far has been on individual work
and short" scenes, but the first full
rehearsal probably will be called at
the beginning of next week.
