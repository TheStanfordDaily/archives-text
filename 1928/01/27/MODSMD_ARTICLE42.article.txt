OREGON STATE COLLEGE, Jan.
26. — (P.1.P.) — Whistling popular
tunes to call a friend has gained wide
popularity on the northern campus
among the fairer sex. Each group of
girls has its particular whistle con
sidered "private property" of that
group. Some of the whistles used by
the co-eds are the tunes "Sweet
Child, You're Driving Me Wild" and
"Remember the Night." Whistling is
used to the largest extent on the cam
pus or in the halls where friends may
live the length of the halls from each
other.
