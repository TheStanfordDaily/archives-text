# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The new president of the American
League is a pretty busy man and, I imag
ine, gets busier as the opening ol* the
baseball season draws nearer. As busi
ness manager and traveling secretary of
the Cleveland club in the old days, Mr.
Barnard was so busy that lie never saw
a baseball game for years. It is said of
him that he wouldn't even leave his work
in the club offices to go down stairs to
see Addie Joss and Ed Walsh pitch the
famous game in which the Cleveland
hurler did not allow a man to reach first
base. He also missed the world series
games in which Cleveland played Brook
lyn in 1920.
As president of the Cleveland club,
Barnard left a fine record of achievement
and he was the logical man to succeed
Ban Johnson. Mr. Barnard.is supposed

to be getting $40,000 annually for three
years, which he is no doubt worth, in
view of his background of a quarter of
a century of work in baseball.
Ernest S. Barnard knows the national
pastime from all its angles, business, pol
itical, athletic, social, and whatever other
angles the jolly old game has. When
coming into office he indicated that he
would carry on the policies of Ban John
son, but probably did not mean to include
in that pledge an anual row with Judge
Landis.
Football was Barnard's first love, and
he organized Otterbcin College's first
football team and later became a success
ful coach. Above you see hint telephon
ing to the Gods of Sport, putting in an
; order for a busy, happy season in 1928,
; with no rain on holidays, or conferences
under the bleachers!
