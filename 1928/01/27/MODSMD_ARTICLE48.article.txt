# PROFESSOR H.D. GRAY DISCUSSES PROSPECTS OF UNIVERSITY TOURS
## 
### 
"The fact that a college cruise has
been advertised recently to take place
next year has led to some confusion
in the minds of a number of Stanford
students who are interested in the
possibility of going," declared Henry
David Gray, Professor of English, yes
terday. "Last year the steamship
Ryndam sailed with a faculty and
student body around the world, and
the trip was reported by various stu
dents who went 011 it as a great suc
cess.
"Organizers of a trip for the pres
ent year tried to get up parties for
two such cruises, one to be co-educa
tional. The rivalry between the two
boats, the Ryndam and the Aurania,
which were managed by different or
ganizations, became so keen that both
cruises were finally abandoned."
Professor Gray and Professor Lee
Emerson Bassett were to have been
on the Aurania faculty, and both have
been invited to go next year. "A de
termined effort is being made to make
up the list of students early, probably
as soon as next month, so that the
trip can be guaranteed and plans
made accordingly," Professor Gray
said.
"It is sincerely to be hoped," Pro
fessor Gray said, "that the rival com
panies will not again cause abandon
ment of both cruises, for the idea of
sailing around the world and seeing
the most interesting sights under the
direction of experts, at the same time
receiving full credit for a year of
college work, is one that naturally
would appeal to almost any student
who has the price."
