WHITMAN COLLEGE, Walla Walla,
Jan. 26. —(P.l.P.) —This school has re
verted to the original plan of two
semesters in a college year, which
was abandoned during the war. At
that time the government in estab
lishing the training corps required
them to adopt the three-term plan. A
majority of the American colleges
have gone back to the two-term plan.
Stanford University remains one of
the leading institutions with the quar
ter system. Out of 656 institutions
only 73 use the three-term plan at
present.
