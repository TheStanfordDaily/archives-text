UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Jan. 26. —(P.I.P.) —Age is no handicap |
in the pursuit of an education and J
students of 50 years of age learn as!
rapidly and easily as those of 25, ac-1
cording to the results of experiments
at Columbia University described by
James C. Egbert, of the University of
California.
"Lack of opportunity and of the de
sire to learn explain the generally ac
cepted theory that adults can learn
only with great difficulty," states the
report. "By increasing the opportunity
we shall increase the desire, and the
extension division is evidently suc
cessful in supplying the opportunity."
Last year sixteen students enrolled
in the uyiversity were over 70 years
of age, and 87 confessed to over GO
birthdays. Many housewives physi
cians, and lawyers were also enrolled
in the institution.
