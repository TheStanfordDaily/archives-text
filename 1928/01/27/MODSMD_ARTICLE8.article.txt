If you were a negro in search
of a Sunday ilinuer, would you
begin your hunt on the Stanford
Quad? If you were an opossum
would you seek an engineering
degree?
"No!" you answer.
But again the rule is proven
by the exception. If aforemen
tioned negro had had his opos
sum dogs with him yesterday
morning he might have been able
to out-calculate and out-figure a
'possum that was inclined to
ward the study of engineering.
•Lacking a negro and dogs in
the little drama enacted yester
day morning, several rough and
ready engineers substituted in
the capture of one very small

Whether the engineers have
no taste for 'possum meat, or
whether they have very kind
hearts under their rough outer
skins, they turned their unusual
visitor loose after much fun-mak
