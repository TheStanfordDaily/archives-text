# CARD NINE WILL GET SEASON'S FIRST TEST AGAINST SEMI-PROS
## Kenealy Seals Meet Wolter's Aspiring Team Tomorrow On Varsity Lot 
### 
Has Stanford a real ball club
this season? The answer probably will
be given tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
o'clock when the Cardinals meet the
Kenealy Seals of San Francisco on
the varsity diamond in the first game
of the year. The line-up that Coach
Harry Walters has cbosen looked
good yesterday after a fast, snappy
workout. The local baseballers will
have to be on their toes if they want
to show that they have a real claim
to pennant honors.
The Kenealy Seals, a semi-pro club
of the Bay city, and a collection of
players of first-class ability are now
tied for the initial place in the winter
league.
Instead of "Count" Sobieski work
ing tomorrow, Jean Kern, Bob Philip
pi, and Mike Reynolds will be as
signed to mound duty. Cook Sypher
will be behind the bat with Paxton
ready for relief. The regular infield
line-up of Maguire, first; Garibaldi,
second; Laird, third; and Bush, short,
will be used. Wolter's new gardeners,
Jack Levin and Bob Sims, will see
action. Frank Wilton, regular, will
play center field.
There should be no worry about
Stanford as a defensive club but the
hitting is the one sore spot. The
team is waiting to get a line on itself
in the Seal game but will have a
tough afternoon with Hutchinson
facing it.
