# REPRESENTATIVE TO OPPOSE ANY TARIFF REVISION
## Tilson, Republican House Leader, Wants Change After Election TRY CALLED FOOLHARDY Statement Made to Stop Coalition Between Two Party Sections 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29â€”A formal
statement flatly opposing tariff re
vision prior to the presidential elec
tion but suggesting that it will be
welcome later was issued tonight by
Representative Tilson of Connecticut,
official Republican leader of the
House. It was designed to check
growing pressure, from a coalition of
Democrats and Western Republicans
for immediate reduction of certain
high schedules in the Fordney-Mc-
Cumber Act.
"To attempt a tariff revision now,
only four months before the first of
the great national conventions, would
in all probability mean the beginning
of a task that could not be completed
before the presidential election," Til
son said, "what would be the effect
industrially or politically of carrying
on a tariff revision and a presidential
campaign simultaneously no one
would be foolhardy enough to attempt
to prophesy.
"Changes in conditions of produc
tion at home and abroad have oc
curred since the last tariff revision in
1922 that doubtless call for certain
readjustments of rates in the next
revision, but a partial revision of any
one schedule is impracticable under
existing conditions. It may be safely
taken for granted, however, that all
who believe in protection as a prin
ciple will favor such readjustment of
rates in due time as will accord with
changed conditions, so that whether
it be the products of our basic indus
try, agriculture, or some other prod
aict of American labor they shall be
reasonably and adequately protected
in competition with the products of
foreign labor," was Tilson's state
ment.
