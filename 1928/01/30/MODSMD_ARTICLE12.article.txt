# OLYMPIC CAGERS SCORE VICTORY OVER CARDS
## 
### 
Displaying a whirlwind attack in
the last half, the Olympic Club cagers
romped through the Cardinal five for
a 42-27 victory last Saturday night.
The Cards held their own during the
first half, which ended 16-14 in favor
of the club team, when Morrissey
looped one through the basket as the
gong sounded.
Gine Miner and Nip McHose, for
mer Stanford captain, who form the
famous McHose-Miner combination,
have added another partner by the
name of Morrissey, and these three
exhibited some of the cleverest bas
ketball that has been seen on the
Stanford court this year.
With eight field goals and three
free throws, a total of nineteen points,
Miner was the individual star and
high-point man of the contest. McHose
and Morrissey were tied for scoring
honors with five field goals each.
Dixon was a tower of strength on the
Olympic Club defense.
Smalling was high-point man for
the Cards with two field goals and
three free throws, making seven
points. Cook, Rothert, and Berg were
tied for second scoring honors with
six points each.
Stanford cagers looked as well as
they did in their victory over St. Igna
tius, but were simply no match in the
last half for the Winged "O" basket
shooters, who were nearly a cinch to
score every time they had the ball.

Stanford court this year.
With eight field goals and three
free throws, a total of nineteen points,
Miner was the individual star and
high-point man of the contest. McHose
and Morrissey were tied for scoring
honors with five field goals each.
Dixon was a tower of strength on the
Olympic Club defense.
Smalling was high-point man for
the Cards with two field goals and
three free throws, making seven
points. Cook, Rothert, and Berg were
tied for second scoring honors with
six points each.
Stanford cagers looked as well as
they did in their victory over St. Igna
tius, but were simply no match in the
last half for the Winged "O" basket
shooters, who were nearly a cinch to
score every time they had the ball.

Displaying a whirlwind attack in
the last half, the Olympic Club cagers
romped through the Cardinal five for
a 42-27 victory last Saturday night.
The Cards held their own during the
first half, which ended 16-14 in favor
of the club team, when Morrissey
looped one through the basket as the
gong sounded.
Gine Miner and Nip McHose, for
mer Stanford captain, who form the
famous McHose-Miner combination,
have added another partner by the
name of Morrissey, and these three
exhibited some of the cleverest bas
ketball that has been seen on the
Stanford court this year.
