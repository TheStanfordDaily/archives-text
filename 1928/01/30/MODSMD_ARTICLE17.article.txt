# Author Claims College Education Requisite To Travel Appreciation
## 
### Carroll O'Meara 
"A college education is indispens
able to full appreciation of world j
travel." That is the opinion expressed'
in an interview Saturday by Richard
Halliburton, famed young adventurer
and author of the "Royal Road to
Romance."
"To the uninformed, Greece is but
a desert; Seville, Athens, and Cal
cutta are merely old cities. For the
one who has studied history and
literature, and who has read Homer
and other classics, these cities have
an especial charm," he says.
Memory Remarkable
Halliburton is a Princeton gradu
ate. Virile, temperamental, witty,
poetic, and handsome, he is all of
the romanic character that he has;
been portrayed to be. He speaks rap- J
idly and has a remarkable memory J
for names and dates. Without a sec- j
ond's hesitation he fires back answers I
to questions put to him.
Here's the way he tells what start-;
ed him on his adventure tour. "Since j
a kid I had always harbored a long-1
ing to climb the perilous Matterhorn,
swim the historic Hellespont, and
run the Marathon. After finishing col
lege I resolved to do all oi these j

things so I could die happy. I wanted
the romantic; to realize my youth
while I had it."
Of all the countries Halliburton has
roamed through, he likes India best
because it is the most colorful and
provides the most opportunities for
adventure. Rupert Brooke is his fa
vorite poet. "Brooke is the century's
greatest poet," he says. "His is the
kind of poetry I could understand and
respond to. I used to carry a small
volume of his poems in my pocket
when attending college, and would re
fer to it when in the mood. I'm writ
ing his biography now.
"To what do I attribute my success
as the author of a 'best seller'? Luck!
No starvation, no garrets; just wrote
my first book and it took. It has
brought in a million dollars. My only
preparation came from majoring in
English at Princeton. And, oh yes, I
was editor of the 'Daily Prince
tonian,'" he added with a smile.
Asked what were his plans for the
future, Halliburton replied, "I'm not
going to do any more travelling for
fear it might grow uninteresting to
me. I'm just going to devote the re
mainder of my life to biographical
work and writing poetry."
