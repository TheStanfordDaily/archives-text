# CARDINAL SWIMMERS PRACTICE FOR MEET WITH WINGED ACORN
## Athens Club Mentor Former Coach of Two Men on Stanford Varsity 
### 
Cardinal mermen will start practic
ing this afternoon for the Athens
Club meet on February 3. Coach Ernst
Brandsten will put the swimmers,
divers, and water-poloists through a
stiff work-out every day, as the
Winged-Acorn men form a stronger
team than any collegiate aggregation
on the Coast.
A1 Kallunki, swimming coach at
the Athens Club, has a special inter
est in this meet since several of his
former pupils will perform under
Cardinal colors. Ogden Driggs, back
stroke swimmer and holder of the
220-yard free-style record, and Wil
liam Cundall, breast-stroke champion,
are ex-prodigies of Kallunki.
A1 White and Dave Fall, first and
second Olympic diving champions of
1924, will reverse the situation by
competing for Athens and against
their alma mater next Friday. Thrond
son and Mills will have to outdo
themselves to take any points in the
springboard events against the two
champions and Pinkston, another
Athens expert.
Reggie Harrison and Kryne Vanden
Akker are the flashing dash men who
should take points in the 40- and
100-yard swims without fail. The for
mer came within a second of breaking
the century mark at San Jose last
Friday, and in the faster Athens pool
he ought to show his heels to anyone
on the Coast. Vanden Akker clipped
2-5 of a second off the 40-yard dash
record at San Jose, and will have an
easy time next Friday.
