# A 						Faerie Tale
## 
### 
It may be recalled that a .couple of weeks ago, a committee from
U.C.L.A. visited the campus with a plan for promoting international
action through intercollegiate circles. This was the plan that called for
loans of one thousand dollars from three hundred alumni. We now learn
from the chairman that we had a "misconception" of the plan; that it
should be made clear to us, and to all others, that "this plan is far bigger
than the work being done on each campus. By co-operation and competi
tion it enlivens work already being done, and it goes much further in its
intercollegiate syndicated news service, and in its joint intercollegiate
action for civic, national, and international service."
Here is an example of the publicity which it is believed would 1 be
satisfactory for this plan. In an open letter to Sir James Barrie we
read: "In 1922, in an address before the students of St. Andrews, you
had the courage to dare the students of the world to demand a partnership
in international afifairs. Sir James, we accept your challenge and present
our plan for international service. We believe that we are 'equal to our
job" but we are out for facts, and not until our plan is well under way
shall we be able to tell you to a certainty. In the meantime, we realize
that you may feel a great responsibility for us and that deferred pride
may be somewhat outweighed by present anxiety. But we are hoping
that you will give a full rein to your belief in the faeries—take a chance
—and honor us by becoming our First Senior Partner."
By such means of awakening to consciousness the international mind
of the students it is hoped that the success of this plan would be assured.
No, we never did believe in faeries.
