That there is no cause for worry over the slight epidemic of infantile
paralysis on the campus becomes apparent when one considers the ade
quate facilities available here for checking any further spread of the
disease. Authorities now are concerned with locating the possible source
for the five cases reported over the week-end and, as these investigations
have not yet brought satisfactory evidence to light, they are asking that
several precautionary measures be taken. Cancellation of a women's house
at Asilomar for next week-end and of several social functions are
deemed sufficient for the present.
I 1 or the time being, it is also requested that the women of the Univer
sity remain on the campus until the possibility of recurrence of the disease
has passed away. This is also asked because Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
Dr. W. H. Brown, and Dr. Russell Lee of Palo Alto are equipped for
immediate action in event of another case appearing. Dr. Brown in
particular has had much experience in dealing with this disease for he
was in Massachusetts some years ago when an epidemic of 1500 cases
swept the state. Authorities now have a sufficient supply of the necessary
serum to deal with any other cases that might arise.
There is, then, nothing to worry about.
