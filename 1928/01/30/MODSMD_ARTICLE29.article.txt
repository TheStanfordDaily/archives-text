THREE GROANS AND TWO
CHEERS
We don't want to be czar to a tyr-1
anny of trifles, but there are a few |
things of minor importance around
here which deserve a howl.
First Howl
Against using the Law steps as a
I salesroom for Ford automobiles.
J Three months ago it might have been
I possible to get the Assembly Hall for
a demonstration, but now the great'
secret is no longer a secret and sales-,
men have no right or excuse for im
posing their product upon our peace
j and tolerance. Take it away, please.
Second Howl
Made for the freshmen and against 1
j the campus railroad. Why do the
train crews insist on spotting freight:
cars across the path between Encina
and the Engineering corner? A sim
ple turn of the hand and the two
freight carriers are uncoupled; a turn !
of the wrist and the engine pulls one '
of the cars away just ten feet —and |
lo! the poor freshmen pass and re
l pass in peace and not in the mud. [
Pull them apart, please.
Third Howl
This is for a little thoughtfulness
in dismissing the gym classes, par
ticularly the class just before lunch.
First, a few facts which nobody can 1

| dispute. That the Gym is a long way
j from some of the other places on the
j campus; that it takes quite a little
| time to shower and dress after a
I class; that the manufacturers of gym
I .suits do not provide watch pockets.
| As it is now, the end of the hour rolls
around with everybody merrily play
■ ing away. By the time one is aware
1 that it is time to go he is usually late
| for what happens next. And paying
' for lunches which you miss is annoy
j ing. Send somebody around to an
nounce the quitting time, please.
First Cheer
For the girls who are having so
much fun in being funny on these
bicycles. While carefully refraining
from discussion on the economic val
! ue of the fad or from venturing to
. say how long it all will last, we will
I soy that it takes a lot of something
like courage to start anything new
I around this place. Everybody's all
primed to laugh, you know.
We can't resist printing a remark
made by one of our jovial friends
[ when he saw a flock of girls pedaling
j along: "Well, I guess I'll go home and
get my kiddie car."
Second Cheer
To the gardener and his worthy as
sistants for making flowers bloom
I in the great open space on the Quad.

and the Engineering corner? A sim
ple turn of the hand and the two
freight carriers are uncoupled; a turn !
of the wrist and the engine pulls one '
of the cars away just ten feet —and |
lo! the poor freshmen pass and re
l pass in peace and not in the mud. [
Pull them apart, please.
Third Howl
This is for a little thoughtfulness
in dismissing the gym classes, par
ticularly the class just before lunch.
First, a few facts which nobody can 1

| dispute. That the Gym is a long way
j from some of the other places on the
j campus; that it takes quite a little
| time to shower and dress after a
I class; that the manufacturers of gym
I .suits do not provide watch pockets.
| As it is now, the end of the hour rolls
around with everybody merrily play
■ ing away. By the time one is aware
1 that it is time to go he is usually late
| for what happens next. And paying
' for lunches which you miss is annoy
j ing. Send somebody around to an
nounce the quitting time, please.
First Cheer
For the girls who are having so
much fun in being funny on these
bicycles. While carefully refraining
from discussion on the economic val
! ue of the fad or from venturing to
. say how long it all will last, we will
I soy that it takes a lot of something
like courage to start anything new
I around this place. Everybody's all
primed to laugh, you know.
We can't resist printing a remark
made by one of our jovial friends
[ when he saw a flock of girls pedaling
j along: "Well, I guess I'll go home and
get my kiddie car."
Second Cheer
To the gardener and his worthy as
sistants for making flowers bloom
I in the great open space on the Quad.
THREE GROANS AND TWO
CHEERS
We don't want to be czar to a tyr-1
anny of trifles, but there are a few |
things of minor importance around
here which deserve a howl.
First Howl
Against using the Law steps as a
I salesroom for Ford automobiles.
J Three months ago it might have been
I possible to get the Assembly Hall for
a demonstration, but now the great'
secret is no longer a secret and sales-,
men have no right or excuse for im
posing their product upon our peace
j and tolerance. Take it away, please.
Second Howl
Made for the freshmen and against 1
j the campus railroad. Why do the
train crews insist on spotting freight:
cars across the path between Encina
and the Engineering corner? A sim
ple turn of the hand and the two
freight carriers are uncoupled; a turn !
of the wrist and the engine pulls one '
of the cars away just ten feet —and |
lo! the poor freshmen pass and re
l pass in peace and not in the mud. [
