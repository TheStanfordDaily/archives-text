"Claire Ambler," by Booth Tarking
ton. Doubleday, Doran & Co. 1928.
Tarkington's new books are always
interesting, and nearly always extra
ordinarily amusing. This book is not
so much the latter, unfortunately, as
the former, and will not appeal to the
same class of readers that generally
form Mr. Tarkington's most enthusi
astic patrons. There is, however, the
unmistakable Tarkington flavor —that
like Worcestershire sauce, or pepper
beans, is impossible to mistake.
"Claire Ambler" is almost like a
j second volume to "The Plutocrat,"
his book before last. It deals this
time with a young lady of the twen
tieth century, instead of a young man,
but it is equally delightful, equally
true, and contains the same amount
of charming cruelty that Booth Tar
kington excels in.
"The book is divided into the three
sections of this young girl's life —or
rather the most prominent periods:
"The birth of thought," occurring at
the age of eighteen, "Raona," the Eu
ropean experience, around twenty,
and "twenty-five." Tremendous ep
ochs these three, and quite well
drawn.
Besides the interest in the heroine
herself, there are a few incidents scat
tered through the volume that give
the reader "comedy relief." The first
section will interest the people who
like the Penrod sort of thing best;
the second section, the readers who
liked "The Gentleman from Indiana";
and the third is designed for the taste
of "The Magnificent Ambersons" fol
lowers.
We would recommend "Claire Am
bler" as the sort of book every young
boy should know. It serves admir
ably for a handbook on a certain va
riety of feminine psychology, and by
reading this many valuable points
ought to be gained. For instance, see
page 237, and you will learn that "A
girl of eighteen can't take you seri

ously, can't take anything seriously,
except herself; she can't think of
anything except herself. .... She
wants to have everybody in love with
her that she can possibly get into
that condition . . . it's only another
way of adoring herself." Valuable in
formation in this pseudo-spring
weather, you see.

riety of feminine psychology, and by
reading this many valuable points
ought to be gained. For instance, see
page 237, and you will learn that "A
girl of eighteen can't take you seri

ously, can't take anything seriously,
except herself; she can't think of
anything except herself. .... She
wants to have everybody in love with
her that she can possibly get into
that condition . . . it's only another
way of adoring herself." Valuable in
formation in this pseudo-spring

"Claire Ambler," by Booth Tarking
ton. Doubleday, Doran & Co. 1928.
Tarkington's new books are always
interesting, and nearly always extra
ordinarily amusing. This book is not
so much the latter, unfortunately, as
the former, and will not appeal to the
same class of readers that generally
form Mr. Tarkington's most enthusi
astic patrons. There is, however, the
unmistakable Tarkington flavor —that
like Worcestershire sauce, or pepper
beans, is impossible to mistake.
"Claire Ambler" is almost like a
j second volume to "The Plutocrat,"
his book before last. It deals this
time with a young lady of the twen
tieth century, instead of a young man,
but it is equally delightful, equally
true, and contains the same amount
of charming cruelty that Booth Tar
kington excels in.
"The book is divided into the three
sections of this young girl's life —or
rather the most prominent periods:
"The birth of thought," occurring at
the age of eighteen, "Raona," the Eu
ropean experience, around twenty,
and "twenty-five." Tremendous ep
ochs these three, and quite well
drawn.
Besides the interest in the heroine
herself, there are a few incidents scat
tered through the volume that give
the reader "comedy relief." The first
section will interest the people who
like the Penrod sort of thing best;
the second section, the readers who
liked "The Gentleman from Indiana";
and the third is designed for the taste
of "The Magnificent Ambersons" fol
lowers.
We would recommend "Claire Am
bler" as the sort of book every young
boy should know. It serves admir
ably for a handbook on a certain va
riety of feminine psychology, and by
reading this many valuable points
ought to be gained. For instance, see
page 237, and you will learn that "A
girl of eighteen can't take you seri

ously, can't take anything seriously,
