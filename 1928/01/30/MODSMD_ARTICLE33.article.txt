I think it is perfectly outra
geous for any man to call a wo
man a rib. I mean, it isn't very
flattering. But of course, no one
understands the real meaning
anyway; though, in this day and
age, one has to stand for almost
anything. After all, equal rights,
equal implications.
It seems to me that there cer
tainly is a lot of useless talk
about girls going into business.
Just why, please, shouldn't a nice
looking girl do her best to get
along in the world?
I mean, every contact one
makes helps a great deal in ac
complishing the things that one
wants. If a girl has influential
friends in business they do come
in handy now and then.
And as for taking the men's
jobs. Why, who wants to do the
work that men do anyway? 1
think business helps to keep a
girl's mind occupied with import
ant things. You never can tell
what will happen when people
don't have anything in particular
to think about. That is just why
I came to college, to bs c.ire
I should have something to think
about, besides the awful things
one reads in the papers.
And I have found that books
really can be interesting, even
when they don't have pictures and
diagrams for explanations.
But I still believe that girls
have the same right to be in col
lege to get the benefits of books
as the boys have.
