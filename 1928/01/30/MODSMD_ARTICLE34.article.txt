# DATE OF INTERCLASS SWIMMING PUT OFF BY COACH BRANDSTEN
## 
### 
Interclass swimming will be post
poned from February 3 to February
10, announces Ernst Brandsten, Swim
ming Director. The change was neces
sary because of the scheduling of a
meet with the Athens Club of Oak
land for the night of the third.
Coach Brandsten predicts that the
sophomores will win this year's inter
class swimfest. "At present," he de
clared. "the second-year men appear
strongest. However, the frosh squad
have been showing fine form and
stand a good chance of winning
themselves."
With seven points, the freshmen
are now leading the interclass race.
The juniors are second with only one
point less.
Charles Davis, Director of Inter
class Sports, announced last night
that baseball practice would start im
mediately after February 22.
