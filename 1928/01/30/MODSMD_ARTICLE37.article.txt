# Advance Deadline For First Acts of Opera
## 
### 
Deadline for the first acts of Junior
Opera has been advanced to February
5. This change was made because of
the short time between the deadline
for summaries, January IG, and the
original deadline for acts today.
Three sets of collaborators are now

competing for the Opera Prize, oil
themes widely varying. Announce
ment of winners will be made next
week.
