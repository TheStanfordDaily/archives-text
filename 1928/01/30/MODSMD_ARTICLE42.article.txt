# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The time was the second of July,
1927, the place, the athletic field at
Lincoln, Nebraska, and it was a Gib
son boy instead of a Gibson girl who
completed the combination, a combi
nation that produced a new world's
record for the edification of the Gov
ernor of Nebraska and 12,000 other
spectators. Coming from behind with
a rush in the last few yards of the
race, Johnny Gibson, of Bloomfield,
N.J., defeated the defending cham
pion, F. Morgan Taylor, by one yard,
and established a new world's rec
ord of 52 3-5 seconds for the 440-vard
three-foot hurdle event. The fact that
Taylor had defeated Gibson in 1926,
and that in turning the tables on his
conqueror of the year before, the New
Jersey Flyer had broken the National
A.A.U. record of 54 5-10 held by the
former champion, made the victory
all the sweeter for Johnny Gibson.

I wonder how many college men
can go out and run a quarter of a
mile in 52 3-5 seconds, let alone try
ing to jump over ten hurdles three
feet high during the course of the

race! I know from experience that
those hurdles seem higher and high
er, and the distance between them
seems longer and longer as the race
gets under way. Gibson's new rec
ord is one of the most remarkable on
the books.
Johnny, while a night student at
Fordham, competed in the Penn Re
lays in 1927 and defeated the fa
mous Lord Burghley of England. The
fact that Gibson was not a bona fide
student meant nothing to Lord Burgh
ley, who is as fine a sportsman as
ever laced on a spiked shoe. It will
be very Interesting when the two
meet again in the 400-meter hurdle
race at Amsterdam next July.
