# AUTO SHOW CROWDS ATTRACTED BY NEW MODELS ON DISPLAY
## 
### 
Crowds have packed the Civic Audi- ,
torium in San Francisco to see dis
plays of the Twelfth Annual Pacific ;
Coast Automobile Show which is
being given under the auspices of the
Motor Car Dealers' Association.
The show opened January 28, and
will run until February 4. All the new
models of automobiles are on display, |

as well as a truck exhibition, an ac-1
cessory display, and an exhibition of 1
motorboats.
Six models of the new Ford are at
tracting as much attention as any
other car. This is the first opportunity
the public has had to give Uncle
Henry's brainchild a close scrutiny.
A notable feature among the cars
on display is the practically uniform
adoption of four-wheel brakes as
standard equipment and motors guar
anteed to do from sixty to one hun
dred miles an hour. Colors have left
the drab tones for more riotous com- ;

binations or all hues, and instrument i
boards include features formerly
found only on cars of special design.
All who are unable to attend the !
automobile show may see the same
models on display in Palo Alto, as
the local dealers have the same de
signs.
