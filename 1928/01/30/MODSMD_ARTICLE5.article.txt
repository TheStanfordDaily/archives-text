SHOP generally repair? Yes, yes, I

Mr. Editor, it was THE NEW
WORLD, I think, because almost
nothing else were around in that
ocean. Moreover, poor schoolboy can
not comprehend sense from other
guesses. I like THE WORN WELD,
WHEN OR DWELT, HOT LEWD
WREN, and all the very same others.
Very much, thank you.
After emerging from behind a pile
of correct answers to the recent
hidden-word contest conducted by the
Stanford Daily, the Contest Editor de
clared the winners to be: first prize
of five dollars, Ken Ferguson; second
prize, three dollars, George G. Bruntz;
and third prize, one dollar, Perce
Barrows. Winners were selected on
the originality shown in the accom
panying letters. Prizes will be de
livered Wednesday afternoon in the
business department of the Stanford
Daily office.
The correct solution of the puzzle is
that Columbus saw "THE NEW
WORLD" through his telescope. The
first prize answer is published below.
Second prize was awarded to a versi
fied answer, and third to a highly im
probable, though humorous, account
of the events leading to the discovery
of America.
Here is the winner:
Mr. Daily Stanford
Mr. Contest Manager
Venerable Sirs:

juncture. If honorable weak-end bags,

FURNITURE CO. and McCLATCH IE
very bad cold in head should SMITH

ANDERSON'S for this very useless

UNION there is strength.
Your humble and obedient servant,
Ken Ferguson.

terious objective of honorable tele
