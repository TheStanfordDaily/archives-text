# PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CHINA MAKING STEPS FORWARD-I. HUANG
## Schools Adopted 6-3-3 Plan In 1924; Political Strife Shows Expansion 
### 
"With the introduction of the 6-3-3
system into the elementary and sec
ondary schools of China in 1924, a
great forward step in public educa
tion in that country was taken; and
now Chinese schools from the kinder
garten through the university are of
the modern type," declared I. Huang,
a graduate of Tsing Hua College and
former secretary of the Stanford
Chinese Club, who is doing graduate
work in psychology at Stanford.
"The 6-3-3 system as being carried
out in the Chinese schools," he con
tinued, "is much similar to the plan
adopted in the American schools a
number ,of years ago. The first six
years in the Chinese system corres
pond to the six years of work given in
American grammar schools; the next
three parallel the three years of study
in the American junior high schools;
and the last three are much like the
three which American students spend
in high school."
Have Usual Activities
When asked if there are extra-cur
ricular interschool activities in China,
Huang replied, "Why, yes, we have
both athletic and scholastic intercol
legiate competition. Each university
has its soccer, basketball, baseball,
and tennis teams, as well as teams
for the minor sports. Debating has
attracted much interest among uni
versity students, and debates are
given in both Chinese and English"!
Huang said that in Chinese univer
sities as in most American institu
tions the students live in dormitories.
Co-education is found in nearly all of
the Chinese universities.
Education Widely Sought
"Educational expansion in China,"
Huang concluded, "is at present very
slow because of the revolutions and
political disturbances going on there.
However, the pressure for wider edu
cational opportunities is great, and
there are many more persons want
ing to go to college than the facilities
permit. With the restoration of politi
cal stability to the country, the prob
lem will be solved in part by an edu
cational expansion movement which
will go far toward providing the op
portunity for a university education
to anyone desiring it and qualified
tor it."

work in psychology at Stanford.
"The 6-3-3 system as being carried
out in the Chinese schools," he con
tinued, "is much similar to the plan
adopted in the American schools a
number ,of years ago. The first six
years in the Chinese system corres
pond to the six years of work given in
American grammar schools; the next
three parallel the three years of study
in the American junior high schools;
and the last three are much like the
three which American students spend
in high school."
Have Usual Activities
When asked if there are extra-cur
ricular interschool activities in China,
Huang replied, "Why, yes, we have
both athletic and scholastic intercol
legiate competition. Each university
has its soccer, basketball, baseball,
and tennis teams, as well as teams
for the minor sports. Debating has
attracted much interest among uni
versity students, and debates are
given in both Chinese and English"!
Huang said that in Chinese univer
sities as in most American institu
tions the students live in dormitories.
Co-education is found in nearly all of
the Chinese universities.
Education Widely Sought
"Educational expansion in China,"
Huang concluded, "is at present very
slow because of the revolutions and
political disturbances going on there.
However, the pressure for wider edu
cational opportunities is great, and
there are many more persons want
ing to go to college than the facilities
permit. With the restoration of politi
cal stability to the country, the prob
lem will be solved in part by an edu
cational expansion movement which
will go far toward providing the op
portunity for a university education
to anyone desiring it and qualified
tor it."
