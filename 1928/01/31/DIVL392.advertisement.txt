Buy beauty
for your rooms —
not just "shades"
Since weil-chosen lamp-shades
give rooms an atmosphere of quiet
beauty and restfulness, isn't it ob
vious that a similar atmosphere can
be created by toning and mellowing
sunlight?
The new Columbia tone-color
window shades give your rooms just
this feeling of restful quiet. They
suffuse the light with their own deli
cate colors, toning down glare,
lending warmth to a light that is
pale and thin. And how your rooms
gain beauty in this mellow radiance!
Give your home the decorative
value of these new
