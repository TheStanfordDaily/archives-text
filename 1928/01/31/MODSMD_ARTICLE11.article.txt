I NORMAN, Okla., Jan. 30.—(1.P.)— j
1 Finding themselves unable to make tele- j
j phone connections with one of the soro
: rity houses during the rush hour so that
they might talk to their feminine favor
j ites, two University of Oklahoma stu
dents have installed a private telephone
instrument in the room of one of the
girls. The telephone is for the exclusive
use of the two couples, who won't lie
thwarted from now on, they say, by the
operator's exasperating "Line's busy."
