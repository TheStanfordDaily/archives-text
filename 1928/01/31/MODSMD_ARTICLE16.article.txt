# Coolidge Warns Congress Not To Decrease Taxes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 30. —
(U.P.) —A strong warning to Congress
I that it must not molest the balanced bud
get by excessive tax reduction which
would reduce receipts below expenditures
was voiced tonight by President Coolidge
in addressing the business organization of
the government on budget policies.
Coolidge has insisted that a reduction
of $225,000,000 is all that can be made
safely this year. But the House raised
this to $290,000,000. The hill is now pend
ing in the Senate Finance Committee,
where Democrats are trying to make still
greater reductions.
Utters No Threats
While President Coolidge never utters
veto threats concerning pending legisla
tion, his words were so emphatic as to
lead many of his hearers to believe that
he might not hesitate to kill any tax bill
which goes too far beyond what he thinks
is a safe reduction.
"I have expressed myself in favor of
further moderate tax reduction," the
President said. "I have indicated the
maximum reduction we can now afford.
There was no partisan thought in that
recommendation. I hope there will be
none in its final consideration by Con
gress."
The President pointed out that it is
much easier to borrow money than to
pay it, that in two years from 1917 to 1919
the national debt jumped from $1,250,000,-
000 to $26,000,000,000 but that it has taken
more than eight years of heroic economy
to reduce this debt by $8,500,000,000.
Since the war began the government
has spent $8,500,000,000' on interest alone.
The annual interest charge has been re
duced by $1,000,000 a day from the peak.
This represents 200,000 men working at $5
a day.
"All of this labor has been released for
productive employment for the good of all
the people," the President continued.
"What a saving of human energy!"

the government on budget policies.
Coolidge has insisted that a reduction
of $225,000,000 is all that can be made
safely this year. But the House raised
this to $290,000,000. The hill is now pend
ing in the Senate Finance Committee,
where Democrats are trying to make still
greater reductions.
Utters No Threats
While President Coolidge never utters
veto threats concerning pending legisla
tion, his words were so emphatic as to
lead many of his hearers to believe that
he might not hesitate to kill any tax bill
which goes too far beyond what he thinks
is a safe reduction.
"I have expressed myself in favor of
further moderate tax reduction," the
President said. "I have indicated the
maximum reduction we can now afford.
There was no partisan thought in that
recommendation. I hope there will be
none in its final consideration by Con
gress."
The President pointed out that it is
much easier to borrow money than to
pay it, that in two years from 1917 to 1919
the national debt jumped from $1,250,000,-
000 to $26,000,000,000 but that it has taken
more than eight years of heroic economy
to reduce this debt by $8,500,000,000.
Since the war began the government
has spent $8,500,000,000' on interest alone.
The annual interest charge has been re
duced by $1,000,000 a day from the peak.
This represents 200,000 men working at $5
a day.
"All of this labor has been released for
productive employment for the good of all
the people," the President continued.
"What a saving of human energy!"
