# On Activities
## 
### 
From Rochester College's director of statistics comes the statement
that "experiences derived from participation in student activities are con
sidered least valuable by alumni." What a shock to future bond salesmen
who by being on this or that committee and being the "proud possessors"
of a block football "X" learn that the contacts they made in such activi
ties have gone for naught!
However, before swallowing this statement it might be well to con
sider one or two things about college activities. In the first place, the num
ber of students who actually engage in activities demanding more than the
loan of their names to committee lists is relatively small compared with
the enrollment of a college. Such a fact becomes apparent when a yearbook
with the senior records appears. Furthermore, a tabulation of the names
of students who break into the news columns of college dailies would of
necessity show that a comparatively small group of students ever do any
thing worthy of recognition as legitimate activity news. We venture to
guess that less than one-fifth of a student body may be considered as
activity members.
Consider, now, this Rochester College tabulation compiled from replies
to interrogations sent out to the alumni of that institution. Roughly, four
fifths of those who received questionnaires did not know from experience
whether "participation in student activities" was valuable.
We learn, further, from this report that "training in methods dealing
with facts and problems was placed first" in the list of valuable hold-overs
from a college education. Even if this questionnaire had been limited only
to former activity students, there would still be an inconsistency present.
If certain types of activities do not give practical experience—more so
than many college courses—then the statement would be worth consid
ering.
To be specific: is it not practical experience to conduct a meeting of the
student government's highest committee? Is it not worth-while experience
to be on that committee itself? Is it not practical experience to have to
sell advertising for student publications, or to write for publications?
vSo long as college activities in any way parallel the problems of outside
life they justify their existence and their lure for some of the students.
