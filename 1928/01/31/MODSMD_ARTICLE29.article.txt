# Roll Your Own!

Stanford women are greatly to be commended for their recent athletic
endeavors. Roller skating and bicycling are considered by authorities on
physical education to be highly beneficial, both mentally and physically;
mentally, because of the exhiliration afforded; physically, because of the
exercise and the tonic it offers for the nervous system. Such a tonic
hardly seems necessary in the present case, but all activities on the part
of the women for their own physical good are to be encouraged.
Rumors are creeping about that the women are using these modes of
conveyance merely to cause a stir in the languid Stanford student body,
but this cannot be so. Haven't they suffered lockouts, parties of six, and
billowing bloomers, all for the sake of modesty? Surely, they cannot be
accused of seeking publicity, not to say notoriety, by such frivolous means
as riding bicycles and rolling on skates. It's just natural that they would
like to ride bicycles.
