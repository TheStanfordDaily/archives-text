### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30— (U.P.)—
Twenty-six naval vessels searched
the "Graveyard of the Deep" off Cape
I Hatteras, North Carolina, tonight for
the missing submarine S-3, sister ship
of the ill-fated S-4. The S-3 has 37
men and four officers on board.
No word has been received from the
submarine since sunset Saturday, |
when a blinding snowstorm drove it
from the other ships of the control
force en route from Hampton Roads j
to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Radio calls sent out to the S-3 have j
gone unanswered. *
Navy officials here do not believe
the S-3 has sunk and attribute her I
silence to damaged radio equipment :
or engine trouble.
"There is no cause for grave con- i
i
cern until Wednesday night when the
control force would have reached
Guantanamo Bay," Admiral Hughes, I
Chief of Naval Operations, said.
"It is not unusual for a submarine
to lose communication," he explained, i
"The S-3 may have sustained a dam
pened radio set or her masts may
have been washed away in the
storm."
However, radio men in the Navy
Department pointed out that it was
Unusual for a vessel to remain out of
communication for such a long period
of time. In addition it was reported ■
that calm weather followed the storm
an dit would have been possible for !
the S-3 to have repaired aerials, if
they were damaged.
"If it collided with another ship,
we would have heard of it from the !
surface vessel," he said.
However, the Admiral pointed out
(hat if the S-3 had gone down it would
be impossible to salvage it as the
water in this section is more than
two miles deep.
