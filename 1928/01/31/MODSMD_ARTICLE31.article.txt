"Cabbages and Things" did not ap
pear yesterday morning because the
editor was helping Emma Fervor read
several baskets of "fan mail." "THE
NEST. A VEST, ANI) YOU" certainly
scored a heavy success, if one may
judge from the letters. Here are a
few of the comments —
"It is a delightful satire on the
melodrama. 1 sincerely enjoyed it."
"I admire Miss Fervor's bizarre j
word effects."
" —easily the 'maddest' bit of writ
ing of (he year."
" —delighted with the Emma Fervor
serial. What else has she written?"
"Offer Miss Fervor any amount to j
continue. We all enjoyed her story."
We are delighted to inform our
readers that Miss Fervor will con
tinue to contribute, and is even now
working on a new masterpiece.

We still have room to publish a
quaint little poem which Archie j
found engraved on a cuff of the shirt I
that he lent to his roommate. We'd
like to know this "tiger-woman" ;
A LOVER'S LAMENT
Your eyes were shadows pierced with
fire, your hair, a midnight hue;
Your body's warm impress
Stole through your filmy dress,
And I was mad in love with you.
A plaintive melody of song then
thrilled my heart like wine,
And in the rainbow light
We danced half through the night,,
While lost in dreams I wished you
mine.
Your dazzling beauty, like a diamond,
took me off my guard,
And made me fall for you,
But like a diamond, too,
Your beauty proved as cold and hard.
At last I've learned, my gilded moth, 1
that I am not your flame;
The kind of love you sought
I've never been taught,
And so you think I'm pretty tame.
