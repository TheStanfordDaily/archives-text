The Editor, Sir:
I have just finished reading this j
morning's Bull Session. What he said
is good enough, but what he said,
good as it is, wasn't enough.
It may be appreciated by OUR Ford
Salesman to know that he lost one
perfectly good sale just becauso he |
used the wrong salesroom. We won't
tell you to your face and we will ride
in your machine, but you know now,
that inside of us we are all thinking
that you are doing something that
you shouldn't even if it is not a tra
dition. The Quad is rather sacred to
us all.
Here are a few more things. This i
morning as we wore going to our \
ten o'clocks the postoffice Ford I>e-j
livery Wagon drove right across the J
inner quad from the Education Build-j
ing, across the front of the Memorial j
Church, to the Mathematics Building, !
rounded the corner, and then drove I
back down the middle of the side- |
walk. Isn't he breaking the tradition |
by driving along the roads that lead
in and out of the arches between the
Quads and disturbing the professors
without driving right across the heart
of the Quad? In the good old days a
bicycle couldn't be ridden on the
Quad, and it, at least, didn't make
any noise.
Secondly, Stanford may have a few
people that find that it is hard for
them to walk. Woudn't it be nicer if
they parked their cars as close to
the Quad as they could without being j
on it. Is it absolutely necessary that!
they drive up in behind the English !
Building and disturb everybody with
the noisy transmission of their Ford
Roadsters? Would it make any dif-1
ference if they ran their cars into
the parking place in front of the Eng- i
lish Corner? It is just as close to 214. j
The last thing of all is this, and
probably it is the most important. In
the daytime there seems to be sev
eral people who are so lazy that in .

order to get to the Quad from the
Halls, it is necessary for them to
drive their ears over and park under
the large oaks to the sides and front
of the Library. Tho Oaks are
there for their looks, and the Library
is so arranged that it fits in magnifi
cently with them. Surely no architect
figured on automobiles in his plans.

Leave them at the sides, it won't hurt
you, we won't have to dodge them,
and they won't disfigure it.

rounded the corner, and then drove I
back down the middle of the side- |
walk. Isn't he breaking the tradition |
by driving along the roads that lead
in and out of the arches between the
Quads and disturbing the professors
without driving right across the heart
of the Quad? In the good old days a
bicycle couldn't be ridden on the
Quad, and it, at least, didn't make
any noise.
Secondly, Stanford may have a few
people that find that it is hard for
them to walk. Woudn't it be nicer if
they parked their cars as close to
the Quad as they could without being j
on it. Is it absolutely necessary that!
they drive up in behind the English !
Building and disturb everybody with
the noisy transmission of their Ford
Roadsters? Would it make any dif-1
ference if they ran their cars into
the parking place in front of the Eng- i
lish Corner? It is just as close to 214. j
The last thing of all is this, and
probably it is the most important. In
the daytime there seems to be sev
eral people who are so lazy that in .

order to get to the Quad from the
Halls, it is necessary for them to
drive their ears over and park under
the large oaks to the sides and front
of the Library. Tho Oaks are
there for their looks, and the Library
is so arranged that it fits in magnifi
cently with them. Surely no architect
figured on automobiles in his plans.

Leave them at the sides, it won't hurt
you, we won't have to dodge them,
and they won't disfigure it.

The Editor, Sir:
I have just finished reading this j
morning's Bull Session. What he said
is good enough, but what he said,
good as it is, wasn't enough.
It may be appreciated by OUR Ford
Salesman to know that he lost one
perfectly good sale just becauso he |
used the wrong salesroom. We won't
tell you to your face and we will ride
in your machine, but you know now,
that inside of us we are all thinking
that you are doing something that
you shouldn't even if it is not a tra
dition. The Quad is rather sacred to
us all.
Here are a few more things. This i
morning as we wore going to our \
ten o'clocks the postoffice Ford I>e-j
livery Wagon drove right across the J
inner quad from the Education Build-j
ing, across the front of the Memorial j
Church, to the Mathematics Building, !
rounded the corner, and then drove I
back down the middle of the side- |
walk. Isn't he breaking the tradition |
