# BOOKSTORE REVEALS CHANGES IN STUDENTS READING PREFERENCES
## College Humor Sales Have Increased; No Call for "Confessions" Type 
### Fred Cromwell 
Certain reactionary preferences have
taken root among the Stanford stu- j
dents concerning their reading mat-;
ter. It is with a slight reticence that
the following revealing statements ,
are made comparing Bookstore maga-!
zine sales at the present time with 1
those of a year ago.
College, Humor has increased its;
sale from twelve to thirty copies a
month; Saturday Evening Post has (
jumped up 25 per cent; Judge and
Life have practically doubled the
number sold, while Red Book and
radio magazines, which were not even
carried a year ago, are now found on j
the list. Cosmopolitan shows no ;
change with twenty copies per month; j
Colliers has soared up to fifty-three j
monthly. The market slump, which !
was predicted here for these maga- j
zines last year, seems to have ended.
Eight "highbrow" magazines, such j
as Harpers and Atlantic Monthly,
make a weak rebuttal to the above, |
with an aggregate monthly sale of J
twenty-five copies—a decrease of;
twelve from last year. It is presumed
"that there is still about a score of folk
who like to have a carefully dusted
magazine, with an aristocratic name,
somewhere in the room for atmos
phere. And then there are always
visitors, you know!
The American Magazine has drop
ped from ten to six copies—perhaps
ambition has decreased just as stu-1
*lent suicide has increased. American
Mercury is still holding its own at
six copies. Eight habitations are |
blessed every month with Good!
Housekeeping. Ladies Home Journal .
has dropped to ten sales; no doubt j
there are ladies who do not buy it, i
though.
To the credit of higher education, it j
is found that Detective, Western,,
Love Stories, and other fairy tales
usually decay untouched on the rack.
There are a few exceptions—perhaps
when someone wishes to commemo
rate the happy times when he used 1
to sneak to the hay-loft to enjoy his
"thriller."
A few Scientific and Style maga
zines and two Author's Journals are
also sold. Chaparral and fun-books of
other schools sell readily.

Certain reactionary preferences have
taken root among the Stanford stu- j
dents concerning their reading mat-;
ter. It is with a slight reticence that
the following revealing statements ,
are made comparing Bookstore maga-!
zine sales at the present time with 1
those of a year ago.
College, Humor has increased its;
sale from twelve to thirty copies a
month; Saturday Evening Post has (
jumped up 25 per cent; Judge and
Life have practically doubled the
number sold, while Red Book and
radio magazines, which were not even
carried a year ago, are now found on j
the list. Cosmopolitan shows no ;
change with twenty copies per month; j
Colliers has soared up to fifty-three j
monthly. The market slump, which !
was predicted here for these maga- j
zines last year, seems to have ended.
Eight "highbrow" magazines, such j
as Harpers and Atlantic Monthly,
make a weak rebuttal to the above, |
with an aggregate monthly sale of J
twenty-five copies—a decrease of;
twelve from last year. It is presumed
"that there is still about a score of folk
who like to have a carefully dusted
magazine, with an aristocratic name,
somewhere in the room for atmos
phere. And then there are always
visitors, you know!
The American Magazine has drop
ped from ten to six copies—perhaps
ambition has decreased just as stu-1
*lent suicide has increased. American
Mercury is still holding its own at
six copies. Eight habitations are |
blessed every month with Good!
Housekeeping. Ladies Home Journal .
has dropped to ten sales; no doubt j
there are ladies who do not buy it, i
though.
To the credit of higher education, it j
is found that Detective, Western,,
Love Stories, and other fairy tales
usually decay untouched on the rack.
There are a few exceptions—perhaps
when someone wishes to commemo
rate the happy times when he used 1
to sneak to the hay-loft to enjoy his
"thriller."

zines and two Author's Journals are
