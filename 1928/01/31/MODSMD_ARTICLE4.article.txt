# STANFORD SWIMMERS WILL TRY TO BREAK WORLD RELAY RECORD
## 
### 
A team of four Stanford swimmers
will attempt to shatter the world's inter
collegiate breaststroke record for the ttOO
vard relay race, in which each man swims
200 yards of the distance. This endeavor
to set a world record will be a feature of
the interclass swimming meet which has
been postponed from February 10 to an
indefinite date on account of the paralysis
epidemic.
The present record time is 11 minutes
and 24 4-5 seconds. Coach Ernst Brand
sten estimates that his pupils are good
for 11:20, figuring on a basis of indi
vidual records. Cundall, West, Ophuls,
Littlefield, and Milton Burns are re
quested to report to Coach Brandsten to
day, as the team will be selected among
these five. Burns, a freshman, is allowed
to officially partake in this intercollegiate
event, the usual varsity eligibility rule
being abridged after one quarter's work.
Stanford's diving artists, including
Dave Fall, second Olympic champion in
the high fancy dive, and Pete Desjardins,
holder of the same record for the spring
board, will also give an exhibition. This
display of aerial tactics will be an inter
esting treat, as the local divers are the
best in intercollegiate circles.
