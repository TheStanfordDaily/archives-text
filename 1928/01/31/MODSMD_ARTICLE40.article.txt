# INFANTILE PARALYSIS SITUATION NO CAUSE FOR ANXIETY-STOREY
## All Cases of Disease Have Been Quarantined at Isolation Hospital 
### 
The infantile paralysis situation on the
campus should be no cause for anxiety,
according to Dr. Thomas A. Storey, al
though every precaution is being taken to
safeguard the students from a possible,
though wholly unexpected spread of the
[disease and to be especially careful to
avoid even the appearance of carelessness
with regard to persons outside the cam
pus.
There are seven cases in the isolation
hospital, all women students and all prac
tically well. The residents of Roble Hall,
where all the eases except one originated,
are being carefully watched, and there
arc no indications of further contacts.
Apparently all those who contracted the
disease gained it from the same source
and at the same time.
Close Swimming Pools
To prevent a possible spreading of the
disease, the swimming pools have been
closed temporarily and all physical edu
cation classcs will stress outdoor work,
and games in which there is close personal
contact will be avoided.
Intramural and interclass games will
be disturbed as little as possible. Some
contests like basketball and wrestling may
j be postponed, or the contestants carefully
examined before they enter the compe
tition.
Practice teachers from the University
to the Palo Alto High School will drop
their visits to the school until it is cer
tain that all danger of the spread of the
disease is past.
There will be no interruption or sus
pension of such meetings as the Tuesday
evening lectures, designed for the Stan
jford community.
Campus Safest Place
The Stanford campus is about the saf
est place there is for anybody who fears
infantile paralysis, Dr. Story says, since
the watch for further outbreaks is so
constant. None of the cases that have de
veloped is serious. He has urged the
residents of Roble not to go home, es
pecially if there are children in their
families, since there is slight chance that
men and women of the age of college
students will become seriously ill with in
fantile paralysis, which is especially of
danger to children. But since the dis
ease is spread through respiratory excre
tions it has been deemed wise to stop for
the time being games in which the con
testants are likely to breathe heavily and
tluis endanger each other if any of them
has caught the germ. As a matter of pub
lic decency and to avoid the least cause
for criticism from the outside the effort is
being made to keep Stanford people for
the next two or three weeks as much to
themselves as possible.
