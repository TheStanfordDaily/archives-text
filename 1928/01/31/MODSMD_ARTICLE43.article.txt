# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
It seems that the custom of "fear
ing Purdue" among the Big Ten is not
confined entirely to football. For in
basketball the Boilermakers of Lafay
ette have made a better record since
the war than any other Western Con
ference university. In the nine years
from 1919 to 1927, inclusive, the little
institution made famous by Elmer
Oliphant and other heroes of the
gridiron has won sixty-six cage games
while losing only thirty-five. When
you lead schools like Illinois and
Michigan in any sport, you have ac
complished something to be proud of,
and to Coach Lambert goes most of
the credit for the Engineers' remark
able success.
Ward ("Skeet") Lambert went to
Purdue as basketball coach in 1919.
After one poor year, in which the
Boilermakers finished in a tie for sev
enth place, he began to produce con
sistently good teams. Purdue was
second in 1920, tied for first in 1921,
won in 1922, tied for fourth in 1923
and 1924, finished fourth in '25, tied
for first in 1926, and tied for second
last year. In eight straight years, .583
was their lowest percentage.
Last year, with their 1926 co-cham
pionship team much disrupted by
graduation, Purdue made an excellent
showing, ranking third on offense in
the Conference and uncovering a
young sophomore named Cummins
who proved to be the high-point man
of the year for the league. This tall
Boilermaker, who proved himself to
be one of the best centers in the Big
Ten, led the Conference on free

throws with forty-three, and shot
forty baskets during play. He should
be even better before the current
'pason ends, as he is clever and
tricky at passing and shooting from
inder the basket.
