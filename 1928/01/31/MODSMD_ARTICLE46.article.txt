THE BLOCK "S" PROBLEM
Proposed amendment is now before
the executive committee to change
the student body constitutional provi
sion governing the awarding of foot
ball letters so that three men, in
stead of one, may at the discretion
of the coach and the Ex Committee
be granted unearned letters at the
end of the season.
We don't contemplate discussing
this broad subject now, except inso
far as it generally pertains to the
wearing of Block "S" awards.
Where are all the block "S's"
our hard-working Ex Committee
has been passing out? Rarely,
even on these cold wintry days,
does one see the beloved Sigma
on the Quad had but one block
letter to show, and it was a small,
modest one at that.
Not many years ago, the custom
used to obtain of observing every
Wednesday as "Wear Your Block 'S'
Day,"and all the possessors of blocks
would trot to the Quad nattily arrayed
in the red or white sweater with the
"S" in full view.
The thing is especially ludicrous in
the face of the fact that men work
harder and are ready to sacrifice
more to win their "S's" than to gain
a Ph.D. Varsity sports almost might
be said to suffer from the single
mindedness with which the men fight
for their letters to the detriment
oftentimes of their team.
Let's have Block "S" Wednesday
again to counteract such sophistica
tion.

"It seems to me," said one of

hte sharp-tongued critics of ths
basketball team yesterday, "that
it isn't logical to postpone the
game with St. Mary's for the
benefit of the Stanford varsity.
It's paralyzed already."

THE BLOCK "S" PROBLEM
Proposed amendment is now before
the executive committee to change
the student body constitutional provi
sion governing the awarding of foot
ball letters so that three men, in
stead of one, may at the discretion
of the coach and the Ex Committee
be granted unearned letters at the
end of the season.
We don't contemplate discussing
this broad subject now, except inso
far as it generally pertains to the
wearing of Block "S" awards.
Where are all the block "S's"
our hard-working Ex Committee
has been passing out? Rarely,
even on these cold wintry days,
does one see the beloved Sigma
on the Quad had but one block
letter to show, and it was a small,
modest one at that.
Not many years ago, the custom
used to obtain of observing every
Wednesday as "Wear Your Block 'S'
Day,"and all the possessors of blocks
would trot to the Quad nattily arrayed
in the red or white sweater with the
"S" in full view.
The thing is especially ludicrous in
the face of the fact that men work
harder and are ready to sacrifice
more to win their "S's" than to gain
a Ph.D. Varsity sports almost might
be said to suffer from the single
mindedness with which the men fight
for their letters to the detriment
oftentimes of their team.
Let's have Block "S" Wednesday
again to counteract such sophistica
tion.

"It seems to me," said one of

hte sharp-tongued critics of ths
basketball team yesterday, "that
it isn't logical to postpone the
game with St. Mary's for the
benefit of the Stanford varsity.
It's paralyzed already."
