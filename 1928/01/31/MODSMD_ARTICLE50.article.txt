# CONSERVATISM OF COLLEGIANS IS DISCOVERED GREEN HATS, LONG TOPCOATS FROWNED UPON ROLL COLLARS WILL APPEAR ON SPRING SUITS
## 
### Beau Peep 
The College Man, that epitome of
American masculinity, is Conserva
tive! This surprising piece of news is
the scoop of none other than the
fashion department, and was discov-:
ered in the process of finding out
what the smart collegian is wearing 1
this spring.
When the green hat first put in its
appearance in the men's shop win
dows, the world said, "Ah! What a
coup for the college man! Just the
tiling!" But the college man failed
the hatmakers, and politely but firm
ly eschewed their green products. It
was found that the ultimate con
sumers were the so-called conserva
tive and stable "regular trade."
Evening Garb Conservative
In the field of evening garb, too,
the college man has shown his under- i
lying conservatism in flat-footedly re- j
turning to the natural shoulder line j
and leaving the ultra-square shoulder
in the lurch. The very box-like cut of
the evening jackets of the past have
found disfavor among college men.
Overcoats this year are exception
ally long, and tend toward the fitted
lines. But again—the college man,
especially of the western universities,
refuse to wear them either as long or
as fitted as the rest of the smart ]
world is doing. They will be conserva- j
tive!
Suit. Jackets Change
Suit jackets for this spring are i
showing the soft roll front which has '
been popular in the East but is just
now becoming widespread in the
West. There is a distinct trend to
ward the more fitted line, accentuat
ing the general wedge shape sug
gested by broad shoulders and tight
fitting hips. Tliis replaces the more

squarish outline of the suit jackets |
of the past.
Paris tweeds and Shetlands hold j
first place among that widespread j
college fabric, the Tweeds; and the I
old accepted Oxford grey is being re- ;
placed by the new Oxford blue, a i
blue of modest greyish cast. Statistics
show that the Young America in the
universities are three to one heavier
on the tweeds than on all other
cloths.
Snap Brim Keeps Place
Hats continue to be narrowly I
brimmed, and though the majority of
men wear them rolled, the snapped
brim keeps its place among many !
smart Americans. (A pressing word !
is urging to be typed on the onesHon j
of brims and faces. Men having wide

faces and thick necks should spurn
the rolled brim with all the visor they
can muster. It is the snapped brim
for them!)
After a retirement of several years,
the derby is returning to favor, and
college men are tentatively trying
them out. Although some men are
wont to say they simply can't wear
a derby, it is an absolute fact that
there is a derby made for every head
in the country. There are many
| shapes to this species of hat as to
| any other and it is merely a matter
of finding the one that suits the par
ticular head and face in question. It
is rather an art, however; and verily,
many a good face has gone wrong
beneath the wrong derby.

The stripes that have so long held
the stage on masculine shirt fronts
are giving way to small checks and
plain colors. Spring is specializing in
white backgrounds with tiny checks
of browns and blacks and blues.
These are especially good in the bow
tie variety.
Shirts are distinguishing thein
| selves this season by very long collar
tabs, an item which immediately calls
j the collar pin into service, to sup
press their uppish tendencies. A new
! feature, too, is the basket weave that
fashions them (it is cool, men, and
doesn't muss easily!)
Spring Sweaters Plain
And now one last token of the col
lege man's innate conservatism. It is

I practically impossible to sell him a!
sweater with anything hut a crew 1
I neck! He sticks to the crew neck |
jthrough thick and thin; and all the
sweater manufacturers have to vend
j their V-necks and square necks to
| the rest of the world.
The sweaters for Spring show them
; selves mostly in plain colors, and in
j very spring colors, at that —yellows
I and light blues and such.
