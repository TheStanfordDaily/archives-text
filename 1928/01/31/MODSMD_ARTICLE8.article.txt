# GEOLOGY STUDENTS MAY TURN LEARNING TO PROFITABLE GAIN
## 
### 
Graduate students of geology at
Stanford University will in the future
have an opportunity to turn their
j study in the problems of research in
connection with petroleum production
into profitable gain financially as well
' as otherwise.
In a recent letter to Professor C.
Volman of the Stanford Geology de
-1 partment the Oil Field Engineering
at Los Angeles has stated that it is
j very much interested in such prob
: lems and will be glad to publish any
! worthwhile articles in connection
i with research in that line.
The publishers have asked Profes-
I sor Tolman to call this fact to the
i attention of all graduate students and
j also to the fact that a reasonable
price—about $10 a page—will be paid
j for all articles accepted and pub
lished.
