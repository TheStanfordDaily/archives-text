Members of the acquatic teams were
allowed by Dr. Story to practice in En
cina Pool yesterday only after examina
tion for symptoms of paralysis. Thirty
men passed the thermometer test, and
Coach Ernst Brandsten put the breast
stroke swimmers through a stiff work
out in preparation for the attempt to
break the world's 800-yard relay record.
