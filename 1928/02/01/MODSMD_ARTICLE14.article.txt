# Ship Bill Passes Senate When 19 Republicans Join Democratic Vote
## President Coolidge, Chamber Of Commerce of U.S., Opposed to Policy DOUBT STAND OF HOUSE Solution of Marine Problem Proposed by Hurley of Shipping Board 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.—( U.P.) —
The Jones Ship Bill, intended to pre
vent sale of the Government Mer
chant Marine, passed the Senate to
day. The vote was 53 to 31 with 19
Republicans joining the bulk of the
Democratic side.
This was reaffirmation of the policy
begun in war-time and now opposed
by those seeking to take the Govern
ment out of business.
The policy laid down in the bill is
opposed by President Coolidge and
the United States Chamber of Com
merce. There is doubt whether the
House will approve it.
CHICAGO, Jan. 31. —Solution of the
American Merchant Marine problem
by private ownership of ships and by
a governmental survey to determine
advisability of Federal regulation of
intercoastal shipping rates was pro
posed to President Coolidge by Ed
ward N. Hurley of Chicago.
Hurley was chairman of the U.S.
Shipping Board and head of the
Emergency Fleet Corporation during
part of the Wilson Administration.
The financial loss resulting from
operations of the Shipping Board and
Fleet Corporation, Hurley said,
demonstrated the Government's in
ability to operate ships successfully.
Not only do American ships fail to
pay expenses in the bitterly contested
foreign shipping business, Hurley
said, but the American bottoms in
intercoastal business. Where there is
no foreign competition, also are un
able to show a pi-ofit.
