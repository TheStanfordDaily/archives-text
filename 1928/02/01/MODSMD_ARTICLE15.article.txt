# PASADENA COMMUNITY PLAYERS TO PRESENT SHAW FARCE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Presenting a problem which is as
timely now as when he wrote the
play, George Bernard Shaw's "Getting
Married" will be given tonight by the
Pasadena Community Players in the
Palo Alto High School. The Pasadena
Players are here as guests of the
local Pemlragon Players.
The play itself is in the form of
unbroken dialogue, and the interval
imposed in the production is purely
arbitrary, having been allowed for the
audience's convenience only. Sets and
staging have been particularly suc
cessful, and received high commenda
tion, as well as the play itself in its
recent presentation in San Francisco.
Tomorrow night the Players will
give Witter Bynner's highly modern
and sophisticated comedy, "Cake, An
Indulgence." This is a satirical treat
ment of the modern woman, spoiled
and hard to please, who wants to
"have her cake and eat it, too."
