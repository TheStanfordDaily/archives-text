# W.C.T.U. Head Says Dry Congressmen Are Vital For Prohibition
## Candidates for Presidency Should Reveal Stand Before Campaign 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 31.—( U.P.)— IThor
oughly "dry" Congressmen and State
Legislators are vital to the Prohibi
tion movement as well as executive
officers who sympathize with the Vol
stead Act, Mrs. Ella A. Boole, Nation
al President of the W.C.T.U., warned
members of the organization in an
address tonight.
Discusses Situation
Mrs. Boole discussed efforts of the
association against the prohibition
amendment, and similar organiza
tions, to elect legislators favoring re
peal or modification of national and
enforcement codes. Her address was
made at a "campaign conference" of
W.C.T.U. leaders which opened here
Tuesday.
"The tenure of office of every dry
Congressman regardless of party is
challenged by a demand that the Vol
stead Act be repealed," Mrs. Boole
said.
Earlier in the day, the W.C.T.U.
President spoke before the conference
on presidential possibilities, asserting
that all of them should be made to
state their attitude on prohibition be
fore the campaign.
She said Vice-President Charles G.
Dawes has never clarified his posi
tion on Prohibition. Other "possibili
ties" were classified by Mrs. Boole
as follows:
Satisfactory to Prohibitionists:
Frank O. Lowden, Rep.; Herbert
Hoover, Rep.; William E. Borah,
Rep.; Frank B. Ellis, Rep.; Charles
Curtis, Rep.; Cordell Hull, Dem.; E.
T. Meredith, Dem.
Unsatisfactory to Prohibitionists:
Alfred E. Smith, Dem.; Nicholas
Longworth, Rep.; Albert E. Ritchie,
Dem.; James A. Reid, Dem.; James
E. Wadsworth, Rep.
