## 
### 
With all of their immediate outside
games cancelled, because of the
poliomyelitis precaution, the fresh
man baseball team will meet the var
sity squad today at 4 o'clock on the
varsity diamond. Coach Harry Wolter
feels that the yearlings have reached
a stage in practice where only a game
can show the relative strength and
weaknesses of the squad.
It is expected that the varsity will
win by a fairly comfortable margin.
Both squads are strong on defense
but very weak when it comes to bat
ting. There are several good pitchers
on the varsity staff that should give
(he freshman batmen trouble. Little
is known of the babe cliuckers other
than that they are the weakest de
partment of the entire squad. Wolter
will probably start Don Story on the
mound for the freshmen with Rick
lefs and Gillett in reserve.
