"Poliomyelitis Situation January
31, 1928.
"There are now eight cases in the
Isolation Hospital; the last case was
admitted Monday evening. All these

is uncomfortable; and not one has
suffered paralysis. This is apparently

No Cause for Alarm
"Students who feel unwell are ad

service of the University or go to the
physician of their choice more
promptly. There is no occasion for
hysterical alarm, but there is reason
for intelligent personal hygiene and
for a decent regard for the anxieties
of off-campus people who do not know
that Stanford is employing modern
