WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.— (U.P.) —
America's greatest investment in Nica
ragua was made after hostilities had
started and with the full knowledge of
the State Departmen, Representative
Combs, Missouri Democrat, 28 years old
and the youngest member, told the House
in his maiden speech.
The investment, Combs explained, was
a loan made by the Guaranty Trust Com
pany of New York against he resources
of Nicaragua. Another loan, which will
further oppress the people, is in process
of formation, he added.
Combs said no American lives or prop
erty had been endangered prior to the
time of the Trust Company loan and that
the American Marines are in Nicaragua
in direct violation of the spirit of the
Monroe Doctrine.
