More discussion and excitement over the cases of infantile paralysis
on the campus seems to prevail in communities outside of this locality
than is the case here. Though publicity, in the majority of cases, has
been justifiably small, it has attracted the attention of parents of students
now in the University, and as a result, telegrams and inquiries have been
coming in to the authorities. It is only to be expected that this would
be the case.
Some students, acting chiefly on the requests of their parents, have
been taking out leaves of absence and immediately departing for home.
The wisdom of this course of action may be justly questioned (despite the
views of today's Campus Opinion writer) because authorities here have
at hand the necessary means for dealing with any new attacks. It is
significant, as Dr. Storey points out, that none of these cases has suffered
paralysis and that the serum treatment available is remarkably effective.
Students may rest assured that the University authorities are using
every precaution, outside of a thoroughgoing quarantine, to check further
spread of the disease. A complete investigation of the possible sources
of the polyomyelitis is being conducted. More than this the University
need not do unless many more cases should appear.
