That "scientific method" of which the courses in citizenship hear so
much has been applied in investigations of the examination system and
the results have done anything but put the system in a favorable light.
Professor Giles M. Ruch of the University of California recently found
111 an experiment with 115 teachers that the markings for the same
history examination paper ranged from 85 to 25 per cent of perfect.
Taking algebra as an example of the exact sciences, Professor Ruch
found that the marks recorded by the 115 teachers for the same paper
varied from 28 to 92 per cent.
Examinations have always been a fertile subject for discussion, both
by those who generally get low grades and by those who invariably get
high grades. Extensions of student arguments on this topic generally
lead to a remark like, "Well, marks don't mean anything anyway. Let's
go to a show." Justification for the students' attitude towards marks is
given by Professor Ruch's investigations but not for shirking study simply
because the examination system can be shown to be wrong.
