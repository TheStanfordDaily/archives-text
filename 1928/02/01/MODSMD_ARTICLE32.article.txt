Three interesting news items concerning a figure whose name is well
known on this campus have come from southern California. Morley
Drury, of U.S.C. football fame, has been named manager of the varsity
baseball team there for the coming season. Next, we learn that the
U.S.C. baseball team will take a two months' tour of Japan this spring.
And, lastly, a contributor sent us a clipping from a southern California
newspaper which told of a "surprise banquet, given by his friends at the
Pacific Coast Club," at which Morley Drury was presented with "a gift
of $1,000 in gold as a token of esteem from his many admirers."
