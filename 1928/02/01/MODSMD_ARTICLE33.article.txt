# RYAN EXPERIMENTING WITH POWER LOSSES
## 
### 
I)r. Harris J. Ryan, director of
Ryan High Voltage Laboratory, is
conducting extensive experimentation
With electrical charges ranging from
220,000 to 880,000 volts in an effort
to determine accurately the charac
ter of power losses in long distance
transmission. Equipment for a series
of tests to be conducted is now being !
assembled.
It is hoped that the results of the
tests will ascertain the voltages
which can be transmitted over given
distances with a minimum of loss
from leakage. Those voltages which
are found to be most economical will
be employed by the power transmis
sion companies of the Pacific Coast. \
