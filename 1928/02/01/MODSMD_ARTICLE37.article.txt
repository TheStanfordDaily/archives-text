Red Sky at Morning. By Margaret
Kennedy. (New York: Doubleday
Page and Company, 1927.)
Taking an engaging title that re
veals the whole temper of the novel,
Margaret Kennedy develops a theme
of fatality in which she shows that
heredity will always come out. It is
one more story of "the sins of the
father."
One knows from the start that
William and Emily, the twin children
of Norman Crowne (a talented Eng
lish poet who was suspected of mur
der) will be crippled forever by the
reputation of their father. "The
Crowne scandal" is a threatening
black cloud that never moves from
its position directly over their heads.
To make their situation more tragic,
the twins are highly imaginative and
"different" from other children. Their
individuality is shown when William
says to his prosaic cousin, Trevor:
"Once there were people who
thought tilt! SUII went, round the earth,
They were people like you. And then
there were other people who thought
the earth went round the sun. They
were people like us. They were
right."
We are not surprised when Emily
later tries to escape the stigma of
being "the daughter of Norman
Crowne" by marrying the most re
spectable, staid, and petrified rector
that she can find. Perhaps we can
excuse her purposeful loss of identity
and her willingness to give up a
promising literary career in order to
become a housewife, completely ab

sorbed in mere existence. But we do
rebel when Emily Crowne, the plian
tastic girl who wrote verses about
witches and tombstones, takes up
knitting!
Now that Emily's identity has been
swept away, we are ready- for the
author to turn to William and to
annihilate him also. Since we have
been told from the start that he can't
help following in his father's foot
steps, we are prepared for the climax.
In fact, its path is so carefully paved
that it loses much of its £clat.
All the time we feel that Margaret,
Kennedy is interested in her charac
ters in an intellectual, rather than an
emotional, way. They are the tools
that she needs in order to work out
her theme; never are they real peo
ple. They are moved about like pup
pets, obedient to the author's will.
We admire her cleverness in han
dling them; but we wish she would
let them run loose occasionally. We
should like them better if they could
be themselves.
Though "Red Sky at Morning" is
often compared to another recent
English book of the younger genera
tion, "Dusty Answer," the two are
quite different. Rosamond Lehmann's
book is allowed to tell itself. Margaret
Ivenendy's is carefully balanced, defi
nitely willed. Consequently, while
"Dusty Answer" is so subjective as
to be almost an autobiography, "Red
Sky at Morning" could by no stretch
of the imagination be regarded as a
true life story.
