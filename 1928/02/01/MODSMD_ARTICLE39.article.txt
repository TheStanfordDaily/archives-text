The Editor, Sir:
I wish to take exception to an edi
torial in the Stanford Daily which
told about the epidemic of infantile
paralysis, with the calm assurance
that there "is nothing to worry
about."
Anyone that is familiar at all with
the workings of this dread disease
knows the rapid and devastating way
in which it spreads. The germs are
especially liable to attack, and to be
spread from, the membranes of the
nose and mouth. Thus sneezing,
coughing, and the very air that a
diseased person exhales, is sufficient
to spread the disease germs.
The terrible results of the 1916 epi
demics and the great number of per
manently crippled and deformed peo
ple that it left in its track, is assur
ance enough that there is cause to
worry!
It seems that if the living groups
that have been exposed, even slightly,
to any contagion of the disease,
should undergo, drastic supervision
and quarantine for a few days. Is it

not better for a small number of stu
dents to miss two or three days'
classes than to allow this malignant
disease to spread?
There are all kinds of rumors about
the number of cases and the serious
ness of them, on the campus, and it
is only right to ask that the proper
authorities take strict and more dras
tic measures to protect the health of
Stanford students and the community
at large! â€”R. W. Neal.
(Editor's Note: Readers' attention
is called to the official statement by
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Public Health
Officer of the campus. We are in
clined to trust Dr. Storey's judgment
of the necessary and adequate meas
-1 ures for protecting the "health of
Stanford students.")
