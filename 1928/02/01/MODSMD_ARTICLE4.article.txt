# "Songs By American Women" Win Praise On Well Chosen Program
## Soprano Shows Spirit, Great Appreciation in Wide Range of Songs Ethelynde Smith's Linguistic Powers Great; Sings in Six Languages 
### 
Singing easily and with spirit, Ethe
lynde Smith, soprano, presented a taste
fully grouped program last night in the
Little Theatre The songs covered a wide
range of mood and subject, affording
the artist opportunity for versatile inter
pretations.
Of the six groups, "Songs by Ameri
can Women" is most worth mention.
The lirst, a Chinese song picture, has a
distinctly oriental flavor; and this was
followed by Lois Mills' popular poem,
"Treasure," set to feeling and adequate
music. "Mornin' on Ze Bayou," also of
this series, differed from the subtler tone
of the others, and appealed with its
strong rhythm and musical variety.
Miss Smith sang in six languages.
One piece was an ancient Buddhist chant,
and had no accompaniment beyond a
gong, which sounded, marking the beats
of the song. A Cuban-Spanish air, "Tu
Espcra," was well received, and in sing
ing it Miss Smith emphasized the spirited
and typically Spanish rhythm and the
long phrases which mark this country's
music.
"Spring Song of the Robin Woman"
is taken from the American Indian opera
"Shanewis," written by Charles W. Cad
man. The singer seemed very sensitive
to the lilting, vivacious spirit of the
piece, and conveyed the mood of the
music strongly by her interpretation. One
particularly delightful selection from the
songs of youth group was "There Are
Fairies at the Bottom of Our Garden,"
in which the small singer is herself the
fairy queen.
