# JAPANESE OF SECOND GENERATION IN GREAT DIFFICULTY-ICHIHASHI
## Become Americans Mentally; Retain Physical Traits Of Own Race 
### Alice Ingraham 
"Members of the second feneration
of American-born Japanese find them
selves in great difficulty," stated Pro
fessor Yamato Ichihashi in discus
sing the problems of Japanese in this
country. "American employers do not
care to employ them, and Japanese
enterprisers are not in the position
to absorb all the second generation
into their service, so the only other
opening is in Japan, and there they
don't want them."
As reason for this Ichihashi says
that schools in Japan fit students for
life in their own country, while
American-born Japanese, although re
taining the characteristics of their
race physically, become full-fledged
Americans mentally.
Carries on Study
Professor Ichihashi has been carry
ing on the study of the Japanese
problem in America, and especially
in California under the Stanford
Fund for research work in the social
sciences. He wrote his doctor's thesis
on this subject, worked for the United
States government from 1908 to 1910
in research on the Japanese problem,
and has been carrying on this study
ever since. He expects to bring his
thesis up to date, and have it printed.
He is investigating conditions in the
Japanese homes, the kind of training
given to the children, and is particu
larly interested in the religious in
struction.
"Immediate solution of the problem
of the American-born Japanese is not
at hand," said Ichihashi. "All I have
to ask of them is to be patient. Time
will probably take care of it." He
gives them the following advise:
first, to scatter instead of staying in
one place, and to take a job wherever
they can find one; second, to estab
lish harmony between their parents
and themselves; third, to understand
Japan and things Japanese, since this
will help them in their associations
with Americans because the interest
in things Japanese is growing. Ichi
hashi advises them to learn the
Japanese language if possible. "In in
tellectual work I think it is a neces
sity."
Living Standards Same
Going into another aspect of the
problem, Ichihashi declared that
there is no such thing as an oriental
standard of living. He showed that
there are as many different standards
and just as high standards in the
Orient as there are in the United
States. "I think we are growing out
of that kind of thinking as far as the
intelligent classes are considered, but
in politics it is the same as of old,"
he says.
One problem that Ichihashi is in
vestigating is found in the four places
in California that have segregation
schools. He has covered three, get
ting interviews with authorities in
these schools, and will have an Ameri
can cover the American schools in
these same cities

with Americans because the interest
in things Japanese is growing. Ichi
hashi advises them to learn the
Japanese language if possible. "In in
tellectual work I think it is a neces
sity."
Living Standards Same
Going into another aspect of the
problem, Ichihashi declared that
there is no such thing as an oriental
standard of living. He showed that
there are as many different standards
and just as high standards in the
Orient as there are in the United
States. "I think we are growing out
of that kind of thinking as far as the
intelligent classes are considered, but
in politics it is the same as of old,"
he says.
One problem that Ichihashi is in
vestigating is found in the four places
in California that have segregation
schools. He has covered three, get
ting interviews with authorities in
these schools, and will have an Ameri
can cover the American schools in
these same cities
"Members of the second feneration
of American-born Japanese find them
selves in great difficulty," stated Pro
fessor Yamato Ichihashi in discus
sing the problems of Japanese in this
country. "American employers do not
care to employ them, and Japanese
enterprisers are not in the position
to absorb all the second generation
into their service, so the only other
opening is in Japan, and there they
don't want them."
As reason for this Ichihashi says
that schools in Japan fit students for
life in their own country, while
American-born Japanese, although re
taining the characteristics of their
race physically, become full-fledged
Americans mentally.
Carries on Study
Professor Ichihashi has been carry
ing on the study of the Japanese
problem in America, and especially
in California under the Stanford
Fund for research work in the social
sciences. He wrote his doctor's thesis
on this subject, worked for the United
States government from 1908 to 1910
in research on the Japanese problem,
and has been carrying on this study
ever since. He expects to bring his
thesis up to date, and have it printed.
He is investigating conditions in the
Japanese homes, the kind of training
given to the children, and is particu
larly interested in the religious in
struction.
"Immediate solution of the problem
of the American-born Japanese is not
at hand," said Ichihashi. "All I have
to ask of them is to be patient. Time
will probably take care of it." He
gives them the following advise:
first, to scatter instead of staying in
one place, and to take a job wherever
they can find one; second, to estab
lish harmony between their parents
and themselves; third, to understand
Japan and things Japanese, since this
will help them in their associations
with Americans because the interest
in things Japanese is growing. Ichi
hashi advises them to learn the
