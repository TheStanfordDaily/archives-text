# HENRY GRAY FINISHES SHAKESPEARIAN BOOK BEGUN BY NEWCOMER
## 
### 
Professor Henry David Gray of the
English Department has completed a
book on Shakespeare which was start
ed by the late Professor Alonso G.
Newcomer, former head of the De
partment.
"My personal regard for him was
so great," Professor Gray said, "that
it seemed wrong to allow so much
careful work, on which he had spent
so many years, to be lost. The idea
is a valuable one and Professor New
comer's addition will make a valuable
contribution to Shakespearian schol
arship."
Professor Newcomer came to the
University two years after it was
founded and remained here until his
death in 1913. During his last years
he became so absorbed in the study
of Shakespeare that he devoted all
his time to it.
According to Professor Newcom
er's theory, the way to understand
Shakespeare is by noting parallels in
other plays, thus making Shakespeare
explain itself. It was his intention to
edit all of Shakespeare's plays, print
ing the text on the left-hand page
and parallels from other plays on the
right-hand page, with extensive notes
at the bottom of both.
He began his work with "Much
Ado About Nothing," but left it un
finished at the time of his death.
Professor Gray and the late Pro
fessor Raymond Macdonald Alden
examined the manuscript, which was
in great confusion, with the idea of
putting it into shape. The task
seemed hopeless and the project was
abandoned.
Professor Gray recently made a re
examination of this mass of material,
has put it into shape, and has added
material of his own for the closing
scenes of the play.
