# NEW YORK NO LONGER CENTER OF BUYING IN NATION â€“ CONNALLY

"New York is losing out as the buy
ing center of the United States," said
Raymond P. Connally, of the Em
porium, in a lecture, "Organization of
the Retail Department Store," before
the Graduate School of Business yes
terday afternoon. "Three years ago
we could buy practically nothing out
of Chicago. Now we can buy out of
Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, and
other cities."
Connally explained the organization
of a retail department store. At the
head of the organization are the
owners and stockholders. Next comes
the board of directors, and under him
the general manager. Under the gen
eral manager are the comptroller, the
superintendent, the publicity man
ager, and the merchandise manager.
Under the last are the buyers for the
various departments.
He told of visiting one of the larg
est Canadian department stores.
Their viewpoint was very different
from the American. To them this sys
tem seemed very modern and too
complicated. To them all personality
is taken out and system substituted.
The Canadian system is to depend on
the head of each department to have
sufficient personality and business
ability to run his department as an
independent business, with the buyers
under his supervision.
