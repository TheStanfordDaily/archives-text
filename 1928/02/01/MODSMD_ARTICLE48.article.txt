# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Baltimore has other champions he
sides Joe Dundee. Yes, indeed! Mr.
George A. Nelson, a short, stocky in
dividual, who spends much of his time
batting a little ball around in a four
walled court, is King over a much ;
larger domain in sports than Mr. Dun
dee. For every welterweight boxer j
there are many handball players, and j
George A. Nelson is Grand High Po
tentate of all the handball players of
the country, which is saying quite a
mouthful.
For four straight years the Pacific i
Coast ruled the roost in A.A.U. four- \
wall handball. "Red" Murray of San 1
Francisco won in 1923, and then May- |
nard Laswell of Los Angeles won for '
three years in succession, not defend
ing his title in 1927. George Nelson
arrived on the scene in Detroit last
March, carrying the honor of being
runner-up in the Y.M.C.A. tournament,
but was hardly looked upon as the
man who would stop the Far West's
annual march to victory. However, it
was soon a matter of history that the (
ninth annual senior championship was
won by a Mr. Nelson of Baltimore,
and in acquiring the title he waded
through a field of sixty-six players
without losing a single game, and
topped off his week's work with a j
startling 21-9, 21-4 defeat of Frank :

Burke of San Francisco.
Nelson's deceptive twisting service
and his tricky "hop" ball, which he
delivers with equal ease from either
hand, will make him the favorite in
the 1928 tournament, which takes
place next month in Cleveland.
Like his fellow city-ite, Joe Dundee,
Nelson came to grief when he went
out to the Coast in 1927. Four of the
five ranking players in the Los An
geles Athletic Club found Nelson
'"easy meat" for them when they got
him in their big courts, and George
left town sadder but wiser.
