# UNIVERSITY EDUCATION IS USEFUL IN MOTION PICTURES-RICHARDSON
## 
### 
"A college education is a good thing
in the directing end of the motion
picture business. Men need technical
and engineering training to design
and build sets." These are the con
clusions drawn by Baury B. Richard
son, junior in the Stanford Engineer
ing School, who plays the part of
Cadet Lieutenant Stephens in the
motion picture, "West Point," coming
to the New Stanford Theatre, today.
Richardson went East with William
Haines, the hero of the play, and Ed
ward Sedgewick, the director, to be
gin work at West Point. His duty
was to show Ilaines how to act the
part of a West Point plebe.
"The picture is the real thing," de
clared Richardson. "The cadets were
used in the parades. Pictures of the
real Army-Navy game are shown.
Richardson arranged all the scenes
at the Point. After returning to the
Coast he dressed the sets just as they
had been in the East. "I had a chance
to see every angle in the business,"
he declared. "I would like to get into
picture work again."
