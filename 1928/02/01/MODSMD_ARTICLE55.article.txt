## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO, Jan. 31.
— (P.I.P.) —Action allowing dates at
basketball games held in the gymna
sium was taken by the"I" club at
its initiation meeting held last week.
The custom of no-dates at athletic
events has been traditional at Idaho,
and for many years officially enforced
by the"I" club, composed of men
winning athletic awards. Dates are
not encouraged, however, by the new
rule.
As it worked out, men students, un
fortunate enough to sit next to girls
were assumed to have a date and
were taken out of the crowd and
paddled. The executive board passed
favorably on the change early last
fall, but this announcement is the
first to the student body.
