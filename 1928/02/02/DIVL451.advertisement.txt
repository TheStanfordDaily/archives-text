YEARS ago, P. A. showed a clean pair of heels *
to the field of smokiiig-tobaccos. It has main
tained its lead ever since putting more distance
behind it every year. There must be a reason
why P. A. is the world's largest-selling brand.
There is! Open a tidy red tin and get a full
breath of that class-by-itself fragrance. Then 1
tamp a load into the bowl of your pipe and ||BJ||HU|l||||i|
light up. The first pull tells you why more men ; \ ji
smoke P. A. than any other brand. Cool and j j L I
smooth and mellow and mild —not for one | \ fPM I
pipe-load, but always. Try this long-burning j ' |
tobacco, Fellows. You'll say so! ■j|
