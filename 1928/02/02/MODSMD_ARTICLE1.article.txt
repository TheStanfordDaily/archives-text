WASHINGTON, Feb. I.—(U.P.) —
Demanding action on his resolution

conditions in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and
West Virginia coal fields, Senator
Hiram Johnson, of California, told
the Senate today bituminous coal
strikers in those fields have been pre
vented by court injunction from sing
ing "Onward Christian Soldiers."
Johnson recited sensational charges
of cruelty, brutality, and evictions
against union mine workers in fields
in the three states, and he was backed
xip by Senator David A. Reed, Penn
sylvania Republican, who said he
agreed with Johnson that a thorough
and fair investigation should be made.
Reed declared he would vote for
Johnson's resolution.
"There is intense suffering in union
and non-union districts among both
operators and miners," Reed said.
■"With the present price of coal it is
practically impossible for either miner
•or operators to exist."
