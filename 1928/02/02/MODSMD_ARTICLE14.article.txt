# LITERARY MAGAZINE COPY DEADLINE SET BY MARGARET OLSEN
## 
### 
Deadline for contributions to the
Stanford Literary Magazine has been
set for Monday, February G, according
to Margaret Olsen, editor. Short
stories, poems, and essays will be
considered.
In addition to the usual length
short stories, very brief sketches of
from 500 to 1000 words in length are
desired. "Stories of college life and
full of youthful enthusiasm are what
we want," said Miss Olsen. "Short
stories should have a strong plot with
a surprise ending, and essays should
be of a light and humorous nature."
Contributions will be received in
the office of the Literary Magazine,
Box 27, or in care of Margaret Olsen,
Box 1826, Stanford.
