# DR. THEODORE SOARES TO CONDUCT STUDENT FORUM HERE SUNDAY
## 
### 
Dr. Theodore Soares or Chicago
will conduct the second Student
Forum being held this quarter under
the auspices of the Stanford Fellow
ship following his sermon in the Me
morial Church next Sunday morning.
The first of the series of forums
was held last Sunday under the lead
ership of Dr. Lloyd Douglas of Los
Angeles following his sermon. More
than one hundred and fifty persons
remained to hear Dr. Douglas answer
questions and enlarge upon certain
points brought up in his sermon.
He was asked, among other things,
what the church is doing to bring the
Bible to young people today. He re
plied that lie is not sure he would
favor the bringing of the Bible to
young people without a definite ef
fort to give it proper interpretation,
rather than having them read it and
interpret it by themselves.
