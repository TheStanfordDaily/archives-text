# UNIVERSITY MAKES STAUNCH FRIEND IN ORIENTAL STUDENT
## 
### 
Stanford University has one
staunch friend in the Orient, ac
cording to a postcard received
yesterday by Murray Draper,
president A.S.S.U., from Masado
Yada, Japanese student who was
sent a picture album of the cam
pus in answer to a ietter from
him asking for pictures because
that was his hobby and because
he thought that was the best
way to study English.
The postcard is as follows:
Dear Mr. Murray Draper, I am
in receipt of your favor and the
beautiful pictures. How gladly I
am! To my regret, I can not
find any words to express tit my
heartfelt thanks.
Yours truly,
Masao Yada.
