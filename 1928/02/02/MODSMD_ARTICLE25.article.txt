Assurance that the Bcniamino Gigli re

Thursday was given by Gertrude Baker,
manager of the A.S.S.U. series, in an in
terview yesterday afternoon. "According
to all present indications Gigli will sing
in the Pavilion on February 9," said Miss
Baker. "It is likely that provision will be

cert, so that we will rely entirely on the
campus for our audience. Otherwise plans
are unchanged."
With every indication that classes will
continue as usual next week, there is no
reason to revoke plans for the concert.
"The Gigli concert is one of the biggest
events on our series this year, and we
would be very sorry not to present it,"
said Miss Baker.
