In the first match of yesterday's com
petition El Tigre defeated the Japanese
Club in a close game. With the single sets
even Barton and Weymouth, El Tigre
tennis men, came back in the final match
to defeat the Japanese in the doubles play.
Through an error it was announced that
I beta Xi defeated Bratiner. It was cor

are that Brainier Club defeated Theta Xi '
in two straight sets, 6-0. 6-3 and 6-4, 6-3. j
Instead of a double default Encina 2E
