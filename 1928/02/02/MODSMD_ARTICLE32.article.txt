LOS ANGELES, Feb. 1.—(U.P.) —
Jack Dempsey gave newspapermen
another uncomfortable day and re
tired tonight apparently with no defi
nite idea of what he is going to do
or why.
In the most outstanding Dempsey
fashion he reversed his stand several
times finally concluding with one of
bis famous "no decision" statements.
"I'm not interested in a fight in
June because I'm not sure my eyes
will stand it,"the ex-champion said.
"I may never fight again; I can't tell
just now.
"No, I haven't definitely retired. I
don't know what I'm going to do.
I may fight in September but I won't
fight in June."
