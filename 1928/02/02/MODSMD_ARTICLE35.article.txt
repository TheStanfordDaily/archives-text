litis on the campus, and the condition of
the eight students at the isolation hospital
who have had slight attacks of the dis
ease is reported as clinically well, accord
ing to I)r. Thomas A. Storey, Public
Health Officer of the University.
Few changes in the regular pro
gram of the University are contem
plated, according to late reports.
Varsity swimming and basketball prac
tice have been carried 011 with close ex
amination of the men before taking part
in the sports. The health authorities have
thought it best to continue training with
vigilant watch over the men rather than
allow them to break their training.
The Gigli concert and lectures and gath
erings of a similar nature will be held
as scheduled. Off-campus people know the
condition on the campus and come on to
it at their own will. Jt is not dangerous
for them to do so, in the opinion of Dr.
Storey. However, he wants them to know
the situation before coming.
The following letter is issued by Dr.
Storey:
"Health Report, February 1, 1928.
"No new cases of poliomyelitis since
Monday evening. The eight patients re
ported yesterday continue to be clinically
well—llo temperature, 110 discomfort, and

a total of four cases of measles this quar
ter. The two preceding cases were dis
