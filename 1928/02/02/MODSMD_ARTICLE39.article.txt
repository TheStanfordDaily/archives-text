# Do It!

This is the time of the year when one sees advertisements of tours
around the world, of trips to the Mediterranean or to Hawaii or "Far
Cathay." And a common topic of conversation among the students now
is the question of where to go this summerâ€”if not where to go, then
where one would like to go. All sorts of schemes are considered, seriously
at the time, only to be dropped when the time comes for carrying out a
plan like bicycling through Europe only to be forgotten by June.
To discuss the benefits of travel would be to utter platitudes. The chief
thing which we would suggest now is to "obey that impulse," outline your
scheme for traveling this summer, and plan definitely on following the
latter half of the Navy's slogan by seeing the world.
