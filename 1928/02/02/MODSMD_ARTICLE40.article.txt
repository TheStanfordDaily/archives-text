The Daily Calif ornian has taken in its Book Review column a rather
double-barrelled crack at both Stanford and California campi. Speaking
of the Stanford Literary Magazine the writer says"it is so sterile, so
'correct,' and so devoid of vigorous writing that you jump from one story
to an equally dull poem." Then, as if to mitigate the charges, the writer
wonders whether his "standards and hopes are too high to appreciate what
is being done. But we should talk when on our campusâ€”." California,
you see, has no literary magazine.
