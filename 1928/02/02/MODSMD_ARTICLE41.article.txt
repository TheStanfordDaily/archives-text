"Are They the Same at Home?" Being
a Series of Bouquets Diffidently
Distributed. By Beverley Nichols.
(George H. Doran Company.)
This is a series of sketches, vary
ing from almost blatant journalese,
to impressionistic reflections. Osten
sibly, the sketches are "the slight im
pressions, tossed off in my spare time,
of Those Who Have Honoured Me
with their Friendship," and almost
ostentatiously the list includes the
majority of the celebrities and satel
lites of contemporary England.
It makes, however, an interesting
book —in spots. We recommend for
the casual reader, the following sys
tem: read the table of contents first,
and check the who-you-know-s. Con
sult your friend for the who-you
ought-to-know-s. Then read from each
list alternatively. For instance, if you
have read "The Vortex," your first
choice should be Noel Coward, or a
Slave to Virtue; followed by Lord

Benners, a Rococo Byron; supple
mented by Aldous Huxley, or a Very
Cold Young Man; and Lenglen, or
Much Ado About Nothing, and so on.
When you are well on your way down
the list, you will have a second-hand
knowledge that should prove valuable
to daze your acquaintances, of all the
people you probably never will know,
or want to know.
Aside from this interest, though, it
is quite a charming book. The form
is interesting. We wish devoutly
Nichols would come to America and
give us such a series. Perhaps Amer
icans don't lend themselves to similar
treatment —or perhaps we have been
so overfed with the dyspeptic ravings
of movie publicity "artistes," labeled
interviews of the anemic stars, that
no capable writer wants to tackle
such a job here. At any rate, there is
no adequate prototype of Beverley
Nichols' book in the United States,
and the only remedy is to read HIS
book. —H.J.K.
