A MAN STANDS UP
Montana's outspoken senator, Bur
ton K. Wheeler, showed during the
course of the Teapot Dome investiga
tions that he knew how to use fight
ing words. In a New York Economics
Club speech, he stood on his feet and
made some vigorous and unequivocal
remarks which should command at
least temporary attention, if only be
cause they may well be the clear and
coherent —if somewhat extreme —ex-
pression of vague, disorganized
doubts and suspicions which have
been gathering in the minds of citi
zens all over the country.
Admitted there is an interested
motive lies behind such a speech. In
the year 1928 political gestures will
be executed in view to their effect on
the coming election. And Burton K.
Wheeler who some may remember
was Bob LaFollette's partner in the
glorious forlorn hope back in 1924, is
no friend to the administration or
to the "group of New York bankers"
he finds at the bottom of the Nica
raguan invasion. But regardless of
ulterior motives, the fact is that
Wheeler's speech reads very convinc
ingly and seems to account for many
things that badly need an accounting.
It has a consistency that is lacking in
the overt acts or the statements of
the State Department.
The full context of Wheeler's
speech reached readers of the news
papers which had already been criti
cizing the American Nicaraguan
policy; the papers backing the admin
istration probably omitted it from the
day's news or ran a mangled version.
So the net effect is probably slight.
But "a word fitly spoken" gives an
aesthetic pleasure especially when
one feels inclined to agree.
Something Rotten in Nicaragua
Now the truth seems to be that this
whole Nicaraguan business reeks to
high heaven and all the perfumes of
Pan-American Conference bushwah
and hokum cannot fumigate it. The
Marines are "fighting the biggest bat
tle since the world war." Airplanes
are bombing away merrily and more
are being rushed to the scene. Last
July our brave sky fighters found that
these Nicaraguan "bandits," as they
were thon called, were so cowardly
and simple that they knew neither
how to fight off aerial bombs or how
to avoid being killed by them. So
this time a good job is going to be
done. And not so very long ago there
was righteous indignation expressed
in this country at the reports of how

Riff women, children, and non-com
batants, fled screaming in agonies of
fear from the French bombing planes
which blew them to bits. Well, it
seems that we are being tarred with
the same sort of a brush,
General Sandino is not a bandit, he
is a rebel if you will —better, a leader
of active opposition, one who refused
to be brought docilely into line by the
efforts of the Coolidge emissary,
Henry L. Stimson. And his men aren't
ruffians or cutthroats, they are politi
cal idealists and they are being re
placed as they are bombed off by
new volunteers, of the same beliefs.
Of course, it can't go on long; the
supply of rebels is limited and planes
are deadly enemies. —Herb. Klein.
