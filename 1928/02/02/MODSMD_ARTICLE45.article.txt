# CABBAGES and THINGS

### Vern Cordry 
Keep up the good work! We are
putting out the column today almost
wholly with "contribs" found in our
postoffice box yesterday afternoon.
We'd like to make a Hall of Fame
for the wise-cracks of professors
which are given at certain places in
their courses year after year. Send
'em in! The address is Box 1029, Cam
pus.

Cabbages OpOinion Column
The Editor, Sir:
I am real Chinese sheik. I have 1
sad but souldful story to relate. One !
evening I went to see two almond- i
eyed sisters, Lai and Sui. lieing a
fast-worker, I asked which would let
me kiss her good-night. Lai left the
room in disgust. Suicide.

The appearance of "Beau Peep,"'
the male Beau Brummel mentor plus
the continued clothes articles for wo
men by "Lady Vee" has forced "Cab- i
bages" to search the land over for a
stylish man-about-town to write a
fashion feature for us. We take great
pleasure in presenting "Lord 8.V.D." j

FASHIONS AND WHATNOT
By Lord B.V.D.
Really, I don't just know how to j
begin on this delicate subject, for, 1
you know, fashions for men DO
change so. And it just slays me, j
really, I mean, it bothers me to see i
the dear chaps so out of the mode,!
and you know, proud of it, too.
Take, as an example, red flan
nel underwear. Among the best
people, flannels, striking
combinations (for men, I mean)
and unique design in those filmy,
oh-so-personal knick-knacks is 1
the latest, fastidious one having
gone so far afield as to have them
in stripes and plaids, not to men
tion red, white, and blue effects
for the warmer summer days,
particularly in July—a rather
quaint patriotic note, don't you j
think?
And rolled stockings, or rather, j
"socks," as the initiated call the pic- 1
tuergque half-hose worn by the up-j
and-coming college man beneath his;
down-and-out corduroys—these are in j
best taste only when they resemble i
the last stand of a wrinkled sausage !
in devastating weather. Ah! It fairly ,
repels me!

the dear chaps so out of the mode,!
and you know, proud of it, too.
Take, as an example, red flan
nel underwear. Among the best
people, flannels, striking
combinations (for men, I mean)
and unique design in those filmy,
oh-so-personal knick-knacks is 1
the latest, fastidious one having
gone so far afield as to have them
in stripes and plaids, not to men
tion red, white, and blue effects
for the warmer summer days,
particularly in July—a rather
quaint patriotic note, don't you j
think?
And rolled stockings, or rather, j
"socks," as the initiated call the pic- 1
tuergque half-hose worn by the up-j
and-coming college man beneath his;
down-and-out corduroys—these are in j
best taste only when they resemble i
the last stand of a wrinkled sausage !
in devastating weather. Ah! It fairly ,
repels me!
(more anon)
Keep up the good work! We are
putting out the column today almost
wholly with "contribs" found in our
postoffice box yesterday afternoon.
We'd like to make a Hall of Fame
for the wise-cracks of professors
which are given at certain places in
their courses year after year. Send
'em in! The address is Box 1029, Cam

sad but souldful story to relate. One !
evening I went to see two almond- i

room in disgust. Suicide.

fashion feature for us. We take great
pleasure in presenting "Lord 8.V.D." j
