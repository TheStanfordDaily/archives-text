The Editor, Sir:
Tish and Bosh! "A senior" 'con
demns the parking of cars beside the
Library. Is not the same base defile
ment of Stanford's aesthetical beauty
carried on by those who park in front
of the Administration Building? Per
haps "A senior" parks his car "a la
Houdini," or does he advocate in
clined boards on the Art Gallery
steps so that lonely building could
usefully be dedicated to motorists'
peace of mind. It should hold those
cars that contaminate the Library
and "out of sight is out of mind."
As for Uncle Sam's poor little Liz
bothering our professors, I should
think that anything diverting them
for a few minutes from, say Educa
tion majors, would be welcome. Imag
ine the first staccato warblings of
Old Liz—the professor lifting his j
weary head —a childish gleam of anti
cipated pleasure glowing in his eyes,
while he awaits the man in blue.
Could you have the heart to take
THIS from our beloved profs?
But maybe, Mr. Senior, you haven't"
a car! Neither have I, but when old
Fords go way DOWN, you and I will
purchase ours. We too will bitterly
anathemize the lack of parking facili
ties, being only too glad to find sanc
tuary close by the side of old "Libe."
—Careless Carlos.
