The Editor, Sir:
Apparently, Dr. Storey is sadly in
need of a thoroughly competent as
sistant, and of equally competent ad
vice. We were completely convinced
of this necessity after reading R. W.
Neal's article in "Campus Opinion"
of Wednesday's Daily. We are equal
ly convinced that R. W. Neal is just
the person for the difficult task of
aiding the campus authorities. He is
possessed with that exquisite tem
perament that dominates the mob
when someone cries "Fire!"; that
stampedes the herd when a holt of
lightning flashes; that tramples wo
men and children in the mad rush
for the theatre's exists when a tiny
wisp of smoke curls up from beneath
the asbestos curtain that has been
rung down upon the stage.
After reading his article we were
all completely and pleasurably reas
sured; it was indeed a great factor
in soothing the fears of those who
were inclined to be a bit hysterical;
we were all glad to know just how
serious the situation is.
Few of us had sufficient intelli
gence to comprehend the magnitude
of the prevalent disease. We thought
that poliomyelitis was a brand of hic
coughs and of equal gravity. We were
glad to learn of the "terrible results
of the 1916 epidemics" and of the
"workings of this dread disease" to
gether with a citation of the "great
number of permanently crippled and
deformed people" left in the track of
this "malignant disease."
So encouraging; so reassuring! A
great help in curtailing "the devas
tating way in which it spreads"! A
great help in calming the minds of
any community! In order to prevent
the spread of an epidemic always
arouse the fears of the population
(to a state of hysteria, if possible)
by vivid accounts of past plagues and
future terrible possibilities. It all
helps; it makes people immune, if
they don't collapse out of sheer
fright.
Neal's information and suggestions
were interesting reading. We suggest
that he refriberate them for further
reference. He may need them later.
But just at present most of us are
content to rely on the skill and judg
ment of Dr. Storey and his colleagues.
No doubt they do know something
about the situation and what should
be done about it. Their rule of pre
caution and optimism seems to be
quite a good one —much better than
pessimistic hysteria, don't you think?
We are doubly reassured: if the
authorities fail us R. W. Neal can
take charge.
So why worry? —Creagh, '27.

gence to comprehend the magnitude
of the prevalent disease. We thought
that poliomyelitis was a brand of hic
coughs and of equal gravity. We were
glad to learn of the "terrible results
of the 1916 epidemics" and of the
"workings of this dread disease" to
gether with a citation of the "great
number of permanently crippled and
deformed people" left in the track of
this "malignant disease."
So encouraging; so reassuring! A
great help in curtailing "the devas
tating way in which it spreads"! A
great help in calming the minds of
any community! In order to prevent
the spread of an epidemic always
arouse the fears of the population
(to a state of hysteria, if possible)
by vivid accounts of past plagues and
future terrible possibilities. It all
helps; it makes people immune, if
they don't collapse out of sheer
fright.
Neal's information and suggestions
were interesting reading. We suggest
that he refriberate them for further
reference. He may need them later.
But just at present most of us are
content to rely on the skill and judg
ment of Dr. Storey and his colleagues.
No doubt they do know something
about the situation and what should
be done about it. Their rule of pre
caution and optimism seems to be
quite a good one —much better than
pessimistic hysteria, don't you think?
We are doubly reassured: if the
authorities fail us R. W. Neal can
take charge.
So why worry? —Creagh, '27.
The Editor, Sir:
Apparently, Dr. Storey is sadly in
need of a thoroughly competent as
sistant, and of equally competent ad
vice. We were completely convinced
of this necessity after reading R. W.
Neal's article in "Campus Opinion"
of Wednesday's Daily. We are equal
ly convinced that R. W. Neal is just
the person for the difficult task of
aiding the campus authorities. He is
possessed with that exquisite tem
perament that dominates the mob
when someone cries "Fire!"; that
stampedes the herd when a holt of
lightning flashes; that tramples wo
men and children in the mad rush
for the theatre's exists when a tiny
wisp of smoke curls up from beneath
the asbestos curtain that has been
rung down upon the stage.
After reading his article we were
all completely and pleasurably reas
sured; it was indeed a great factor
in soothing the fears of those who
were inclined to be a bit hysterical;
we were all glad to know just how
serious the situation is.

gence to comprehend the magnitude
