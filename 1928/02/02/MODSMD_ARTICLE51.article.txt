# PORTRAITS ARE MOST DRAMATIC FORMS OF ART, CLAIMS PAINTER
## Van Valkenburgh States He Has No Idea of Purpose In Modern Cubism 
### Sylva Weaver 
"Cubism? I haven't the slightest
idea what it is driving at," said Peter
Van Valkenburgh, the Oakland artist
whose portraits of many intellectual
men of this age were recently ex
hibited at the Stanford Art Gallery.
"Modern art is trying to break in new
ground," he admitted, but refused to
comment further on the trend of this
radical artistic: development.
Is Oakland Artist
Van Valkenburgh is an Oakland
artist of Dutch ancestry. He is pri
marily interested in portraiture.
"Painting portraits is the most dra
matic form of artistic work," he de
clared. "Every one is so different, and
a continual variety of people cornes
before me. I never study the indi
viduals I portray but depend entirely
on intuition. Some portraits are ex
tremely difficult while others can
easily be finished in three sittings of
two hours each. It is particularly in
teresting to picture the intellectual
types.
"Holbein is the greatest man in my
line. This Dutch artist probably made
little drawings, tracing them on can
vas, and then painted them. It is
curious that most people believe that
Holbein did all his drawings in red
chalk. As a matter of fact, the best
copies of his works were made by a
firm in Munich which used red ink in
the printing.
Cut Paper Animals
Speaking of his youth he said, "As
a child my mother used to put me
in the wood-box, so that I would not
cut papers over the room in the forms
of animals and people. Then I began
to draw pictures in the fly-leaves of
all the books we had. I was in full
enthusiasm for art until I entered
art school in Chicago. Spontaneity is
often crushed out of art students by
the visions of the famous masters
until the students give up in despair.
You're in luck if you can get your
enthusiasm back after your period of
training.
"The greatest mistake most por.
trait artists make is that they try to
show what a wonderful picture they
can make instead of realizing that the
individual before them is the all
important thing," he concluded.
Made Thirty-Four Pictures
Van Valkenburgh has recently
made thirty-four portraits of members
of the faculty at the University of
California. These pictures were on
exhibition here and can be seen now
by inquiring at the desk at the Art
Gallery.
It is the hope of the artist to con
tinue his studies of the intellectual
types at Stanford. He has finished a
portrait of Douglas Houghton Camp
bell, emeritus professor of botany,
and is now working on a character
study of Professor George James
Peirce.
