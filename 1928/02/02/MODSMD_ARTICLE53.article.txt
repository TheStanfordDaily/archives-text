The common conception of an
Alderman is a fat, pudgy individual,
who smokes big cigars and wears a
derby hat. The idea of such an Alder
man winning a 100-yard dash is way
beyond the realms of possibility. But
there is one Alderman who can do
just that and more too. Tonight, with
many fat, pompous Aldermen sitting
in the box seats of Madison Square
Garden in New York, Frederick P.
Alderman of Michigan State Univer
sity, will give an exhibition of his
speed in the annual Milllrose Athletic
Carnival.
Last May, before the 1.C.4.A. games
at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, track
sharps, who make a practice of dop
ing out the meet in advance, failed
to place young Alderman high up in
the quarter-mile run, but figured that
he might do well in the sprints, as
reports had come out of Michigan
of this athlete's extraordinary fleet
ness of foot. There were rumors,
even, that he had run 100 yards in
9 3-sths seconds and 220 yards in
20 1-2. (Those times were credited to
Alderman in the Michigan State In
tercollegiates on May 31.) So when
the "Wolverine Express" won the
1.C.4.A. 440-yard title in the fast time

jof 48 3-10ths second, finishing ahead
of such sterling quarter milers as
Ross, of Yale; Barbuti and Cook, of
Syracuse; Swope of Dartmouth; and
Broda, of Brown, it created no end of
surprise.
To cap this off, Alderman won both
the 100 and 200 in the National Col
legiate meet in Chicago a week or so
later, running the 100 in 9 9-10ths and
the 220 in 21 l-10th. What this re
markable runner does against Bow
man and other Eastern sprinters to
night should have an important bear
j ing on the coming Olympics. All
j foreign runners, including the Scan
j dir.avian, please notice!

The common conception of an
Alderman is a fat, pudgy individual,
who smokes big cigars and wears a
derby hat. The idea of such an Alder
man winning a 100-yard dash is way
beyond the realms of possibility. But
there is one Alderman who can do
just that and more too. Tonight, with
many fat, pompous Aldermen sitting
in the box seats of Madison Square
Garden in New York, Frederick P.
Alderman of Michigan State Univer
sity, will give an exhibition of his
speed in the annual Milllrose Athletic
Carnival.
Last May, before the 1.C.4.A. games
at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, track
sharps, who make a practice of dop
ing out the meet in advance, failed
to place young Alderman high up in
the quarter-mile run, but figured that
he might do well in the sprints, as
reports had come out of Michigan
of this athlete's extraordinary fleet
ness of foot. There were rumors,
even, that he had run 100 yards in
9 3-sths seconds and 220 yards in
20 1-2. (Those times were credited to
Alderman in the Michigan State In
tercollegiates on May 31.) So when
the "Wolverine Express" won the
1.C.4.A. 440-yard title in the fast time

jof 48 3-10ths second, finishing ahead
of such sterling quarter milers as
Ross, of Yale; Barbuti and Cook, of
Syracuse; Swope of Dartmouth; and
Broda, of Brown, it created no end of
surprise.
To cap this off, Alderman won both
the 100 and 200 in the National Col
legiate meet in Chicago a week or so
later, running the 100 in 9 9-10ths and
the 220 in 21 l-10th. What this re
markable runner does against Bow
man and other Eastern sprinters to
night should have an important bear
j ing on the coming Olympics. All
