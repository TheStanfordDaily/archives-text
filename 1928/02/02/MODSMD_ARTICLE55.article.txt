# GENERAL BACKGROUND IS BEST PREPARATION FOR FOREIGN SERVICE
## 
### 
Economics, political science, his
tory, and law, besides a good deal of
work in languages, will give the best
background for work in the foreign
service, in the opinion of Professor
Graham H. Stuart. The English be
lieve in getting a general foundation
in college, while Americans try to
specialize. The former type of educa
tion is better as preparation for the
foreign service.
For men, foreign commerce, news
paper work, diplomatic or consular
service offer great opportunities. Po
sitions in this type of work for women
are found, as secretaries or clerks of
consuls, ambassadors, and commer
cial corporations. Also, almost every
national organization has an interna
tional division or bureau, of which
women as a rule are in charge. This
type of work takes a broad knowl
edge, and ability.
Asked as to whether there is much
chance for Americans on the League
of Nations, Professor Stuart said that
at present there are more of them
working on the League than of any
other nationality. There are Ameri
cans on practically every branch of
the secretariat, but most of them
started when t'he League opened. It
is very difficult for an American to
get a position with the Leasue at
present.
The work of the League is becom
ing largely a routine matter now, and
important problems can be settled in
about one-third the time that earlier
problems took, according to Stuart.
