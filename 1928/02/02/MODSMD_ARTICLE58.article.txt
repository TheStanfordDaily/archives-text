# GOLDEN CURLS, BABY FROCKS IDENTIFY DUNCANS INTERVIEW BECOMES CONTEST IN ENDURANCE SERIES OF PICTURES PLANNED FOR NEXT SPRING
## 
### Ben Maddox, Jr 
One final roar from the big organ, the
familiar strains of "Remembering" shad
ow into expectant stillness. Impressively
the great red velvet curtains roll apart to
reveal an empty stage. A moment's wait
—then out they come bounding. Two
little girls with long golden curls, baby
doll dresses, white socks, patent leather
pumps, one angelic looking, the other imp
ish. They giggle, they coo. The audience
claps madly.
It's Topsy and Eva once again.
Say that they repeat themselves, that
they are an institution—these Duncan
Sisters. But admit that once you've seen
them you always come back for more.
They are inimitably original and supreme
in the realm of "cuteness." They star in
musical comedy, on the screen, in vaude
ville. They make Victor records, enter
tain over the radio. And being gifted mu
sicians they write many of the songs they
sing.
Still the Same
Topsy was as mischievous as ever, Eva
as sweet when they were making d per
sonal appearance a week ago at the Pan
tages. I interviewed them—that is, after
three attempts. It developed into an en
durance contest, because the Duncans
have so many friends, and each feels duty
bound to call upon the girls when they are
in town.
The second time I went up to sec them
a lady with a four-year-old daughter beat
me to the dressing-rooms. A case of
women and children first, since the little
dear had sent Topsy a box of candy up
over the footlights and her mama thought
Rosetta should respond with a personal
thank-you.
Eva (she's Vivian) did most of the
talking for the family.
To Make More Pictures
"Yes, we are going to make more pic
tures. As soon as we definitely sign in
Hollywood we will start on 'Tempest and
Sunshine.' Then we'll make 'Christopher
and Columbus' and 'Hansel and Gretel'—
all of them this spring."
"When are you going to appear in a
new musical comedy?" I asked. Having
seen 'Topsy and Eva' numerous times, I
was hoping for a new play.
"Next fall. It will be "The Heavenly
Twins' and, though we'll probably open
it in New York, we'll certainly play it out
here."
When I asked if she was married—
you'll recall considerable front-page pub
licity when Eva announced her engage
ment to Nils Asther, Hollywood actor,
and Topsy said she would make it a
double wedding—Eva chuckled with child
ish glee and crooned, "I should say not —
aren't you glad ?"

Well, I said that much could be said on
both sides—not knowing just what Emily
I Post would advise in the face of such a
: query.
, It seems that both engagements have
: been broken. The girls have been appear
; ing in person in a special prologue to
j their picture "Topsy and Eva" throughout
I the country, and then decided to vaude
ville back to Hollywood and turn out
some more movies. They are immensely
popular in the film colony, and as Los
Angeles is their home town they are look
ing forward to a joyful spring. It was
just ten years ago last December that they
j quit Poly High in Los Angeles to go on
j the stage.
In person they are very good-looking,
dynamic in personality. They are always
working—last month they made a new
record for Victor—"Baby Eeet Go Pitter
Patter 'Cross My Heart." They want to
please their public—perhaps that's why
the theater men call them the Prima Don
nas of the Box Office!

I Post would advise in the face of such a
: query.
, It seems that both engagements have
: been broken. The girls have been appear
; ing in person in a special prologue to
j their picture "Topsy and Eva" throughout
I the country, and then decided to vaude
ville back to Hollywood and turn out
some more movies. They are immensely
popular in the film colony, and as Los
Angeles is their home town they are look
ing forward to a joyful spring. It was
just ten years ago last December that they
j quit Poly High in Los Angeles to go on
j the stage.
In person they are very good-looking,
dynamic in personality. They are always
working—last month they made a new
record for Victor—"Baby Eeet Go Pitter
Patter 'Cross My Heart." They want to
please their public—perhaps that's why
the theater men call them the Prima Don
nas of the Box Office!
One final roar from the big organ, the
familiar strains of "Remembering" shad
ow into expectant stillness. Impressively
the great red velvet curtains roll apart to
reveal an empty stage. A moment's wait
—then out they come bounding. Two
little girls with long golden curls, baby
doll dresses, white socks, patent leather
pumps, one angelic looking, the other imp
ish. They giggle, they coo. The audience
claps madly.
It's Topsy and Eva once again.
Say that they repeat themselves, that
they are an institution—these Duncan
Sisters. But admit that once you've seen
them you always come back for more.
They are inimitably original and supreme
in the realm of "cuteness." They star in
musical comedy, on the screen, in vaude
ville. They make Victor records, enter
tain over the radio. And being gifted mu
sicians they write many of the songs they
sing.
Still the Same
Topsy was as mischievous as ever, Eva
as sweet when they were making d per
sonal appearance a week ago at the Pan
tages. I interviewed them—that is, after
three attempts. It developed into an en
durance contest, because the Duncans
have so many friends, and each feels duty
bound to call upon the girls when they are
in town.
The second time I went up to sec them
a lady with a four-year-old daughter beat
me to the dressing-rooms. A case of
women and children first, since the little
dear had sent Topsy a box of candy up
over the footlights and her mama thought
Rosetta should respond with a personal
thank-you.
Eva (she's Vivian) did most of the
talking for the family.
To Make More Pictures
"Yes, we are going to make more pic
tures. As soon as we definitely sign in
Hollywood we will start on 'Tempest and
Sunshine.' Then we'll make 'Christopher
and Columbus' and 'Hansel and Gretel'—
all of them this spring."
"When are you going to appear in a
new musical comedy?" I asked. Having
seen 'Topsy and Eva' numerous times, I
was hoping for a new play.
"Next fall. It will be "The Heavenly
Twins' and, though we'll probably open
it in New York, we'll certainly play it out
here."
When I asked if she was married—
you'll recall considerable front-page pub
licity when Eva announced her engage
ment to Nils Asther, Hollywood actor,
and Topsy said she would make it a
double wedding—Eva chuckled with child
ish glee and crooned, "I should say not —
aren't you glad ?"

Well, I said that much could be said on
both sides—not knowing just what Emily
