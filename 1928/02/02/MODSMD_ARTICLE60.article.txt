A newspaper clipping sent to the
Daily by Francis W. Mosher, a for
mer student and now engaged in I
newspaper work in Australia, gives
a colorful picture of certain Austra
lian opinion regarding this country.
A returned traveler found that "the
white people in America are slowly
but surely descending to the level of
the negroes, and the blacks are climb
ing to the level of the whites."
"College boys and girls," he said,
"are mad with a craze for speed, jazz j
parties, ball games, and illicit drink
ing. The most terrible aspect of the
country is the enormous amount of j
crime. Many hold-ups are attributed j
to youths less than twenty-one, and [
many young people die after drinking I
bad liquor."
