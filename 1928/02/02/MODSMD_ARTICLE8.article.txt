# HISTORY, PROSPECTS OF CARDINAL TENNIS TEAMS ARE PRAISED
## 
### 
Tennis at Stanford received a boost in
the January issue of the Tennis Review.
Besides a story giving the past history of
tennis on the campus and the present pros
pects, there were pictures of John Doeg,
freshman net star, and the new tennis
courts.
Prospects of Stanford having a winning
varsity in 1928 are bright, says the Re
view. Three returning lettermen, McEl
venny, Herrington, and Wheatley, with
Driscoll, Castellanos, Thomas, and Hall,
give Coach Hal Davis a wealth of strong
material.
The Review also discusses freshman
tennis, saying that the outlook is good
with Doeg, Weesner, Easton, and Ste
phens registered at Stanford.
An outline of Cardinal tennis history
from the time that it was a tradition to
lose the annual contest against California
until 1926, when the Cards returned with
a three to two victory, and 1927, when
they returned with a four to one victory,
was given.
The article pointed out that Stanford
now has thirty courts, more than twenty
of these being in good condition. Even
with this large number of courts, the net
classes are overcrowded, with courts in
use all of the time.
