### 
PARIS, Feb. 2—(U.P.)—France's
two most distinguished diplomats —
Premier Raymond Poincare and For
eign Minister Aristide Brland —spoke
to the French Parliament today on
two of the most important questions
confronting the nation.
In the Chamber of Deputies, Poin
care delivered his long-awaited fin
ance speech, re-affirming that France
has "no intention" of repudiating her
war debts.
Simultaneously, in the Senate, the
venerable Briand answered Foreign
Minister Gustav Stresemann of Ger
many who this week demanded
French evacuation of the Rhineland,
by saying that Germany had obliga
tions to meet before this could be
accomplished.
Poincare, tired by the jeers of com
munists and their obstructionist tac
tics, did not complete his speech,
leaving the balance for Friday.
Briand, upon the conclusion of his
address, received the hearty applause
of the Senate and its unanimous vote
of confidence.
"I have not ratified the debt ac
cords," Poincare said, "because I don't
know how to pay for G2 years.
"But I have no intention of repudi
ating the debts. We have already ar
ranged to pay the greater part of the
charges on foreign debts for 1928 and
1929. The reserves of the Bank of
France are so strong that, barring
sudden financial madness, we are pro
tected in case of accident. The prin
ciples I have followed must be con
tinued."
