## 
### 
FALL RIVER, Mass., Feb. 2.—( U.P.)
—Fanned by a gale, flames swept
through the heart of this Mill City
tonight, leaving a trail of destruction
which was estimated at upwards of
$2,500,000.
Starting in the Pocasset Mills, near
the waterfront, the fire gained rapid
headway in the mill's inflammable
contents before it was discovered. By
the time firemen reached the scene,
the factory was enveloped and a high
wind was scattering sparks far and
wide.
Because of the direction of the
wind, the entire southern section of
the city was endangered.
