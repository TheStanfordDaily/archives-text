## 
### 
The Five Hundred will reign
supreme on the Farm for the
next few weeks, or at least par
tially so, for all competition from
Mills College has been removed
for the present. Mills women
have been asked by the college
physician not to visit the Stan
ford campus and to have as lit
tle contact with Stanford men
as possible until the infantile
paralysis epidemic has "blown
over."
On being questioned by tele
phone yesterday, the Mills phy
sician stated that this is not a
quarantine but merely a request
made by the health department
there.
Apparently fearing that even
infantile paralysis couldn't keep
Stanford men away from Mills,
authorities have called off dances
planned for next week at Mills.
