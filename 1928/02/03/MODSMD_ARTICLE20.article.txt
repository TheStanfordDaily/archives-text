# LATIN GROUP AGREES TO U.S. INTERVENTION

### 
HAVANA, Feb. 2.—( U.P.) — The
United States won its biggest point
today at the Sixth Pan-American Con
ference when an official report to the
international law committee made a
concession to her views on interven
tion by one nation in another's af
fairs.
The report on the law of interven
tion, feared for months as a possible
source of embarrassment to the
United States because of her Nica
raguan policy, accepts the contention
long supported by the United States
that states have duties and obliga
tions as well as rights.
Presented by Victor Maurtua of
Peru, the report says that nations,
although secure in principle against
foreign intervention or control, must
not harm or violate the rights of
other states.
