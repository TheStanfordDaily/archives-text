# INFANTILE PARALYSIS IS ON WANE; DR. STOREY ISSUES RULES TO CHECK DISEASE
## Eight Patients in Isolation Hospital Continue to Be Clinically Well Fifty-One Men Seek Medical Advisor; All Are Discharged 
### 
Dr. Storey last night recom
mended that students remain on
the campus over the week-end to
prevent the possibility of trans
mitting poliomyelitis to their
families or other people through
social gatherings.
No new cases of infantile paralysis
have been reported since Monday
evening. The eight cases confined in
the Isolation Hospital continue to bo
clinically well. Fifty-one men were
examined yesterday at the offices of
the Medical Advisor of Men; none
was found in need of medical atten
tion. In the following letter issued by
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Public Health
Officer of the University, hygienic
precautions against taking the disease
are given.
Dr. Storey's Report
No new cases of poliomyelitis have
developed since Monday evening,
January 30. All cases —eight in num
ber —continue to be clinically well.
Not one has any temperature, discom
fort, or paralysis.
The two cases of measles reported
yesterday are comfortable and only
mildly sick.
Fifty-one men reported voluntarily
for examination and advice in the
offices of the Medical Adviser of Men
today between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. No
one was found in need of special
medical treatment.
Suggestions: The germs of polio
meylitis, like those of a number of
other diseases, are found in the secre
tions from the nose, throat, and
mouth, and in the discharges from
the intestinal canal of the individual
who is sick with the disease. One may
become infected with these germs if
they enter his mouth or nose. These
facts justify the following advice:
Always wash your hands thorough
ly before eating, before handling
food, and before any manual atten
tion to your face, nose, lips, mouth, or
teeth.
Avoid Contacts
Always wash your hand thoroughly
before and after finger contacts with
other people or animals, particularly
while they are sick.
Coughing, sneezing, loud talking,
and forceful breathing discharge
showers of fine droplets of moisture
from the nose or mouth. Therefore,
don't cough or sneeze or otherwise
spray your respiratory excretions into
the air that is about to be inhaled by
your companions.
Avoid intimate association with peo
ple who are careless of their cough
ings, sneezings, and other respiratory
sprays.
Dances Inadvisable
These statements exp.ain the *'n
advisability of receptions or dances,
or of swimming classes, basketball,
or wrestling if any of the participants

' are sick or about to be sick. They!
I explain the danger of the common
towel used by a basketball team or a
, football team; the risk of smoking
I another man's pipe; the hazard of
kissing, especially of kissing and
caressing little children; the menace
j of finger-nail biting; the reasons for i
1 paper cups, the water-wagon for the |
I football team, Miss Handy's live
! steam dishwashing machines; and
I various other of our common de-;
i fenses.
That Parents May Know
The anxieties of uninformed parents
; and friends make it wise to send
them daily accurate news of the situ
ation so that they need no longer (
worry. The bulletins published daily
in this paper are convincing factual
evidence that the Stanford campus is
as safe as any other community in
j California.
The nervousness of the general pub
j lie, ignorant of the dependability of
I the men and women of the Stanford
student body, and uninformed as to
i the organization and methods adopted
here for safeguarding campus health,
makes it important that we give as
little opportunity as possible for mis
[ interpretation. Therefore, it is urged

that, for the time being, students re
main on the campus as much as pos
sible, keep away from social gather
ings in neighboring towns; omit
week-end trips home; and avoid all
appearance of being careless of other
people's health.
THOMAS A. STOREY, M.D.
