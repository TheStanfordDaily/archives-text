# Cause for Nausea
## 
### 
We thought that tiie Sally case set a new low mark in journalism. We
were wrong, or too hasty—the Hickman trial had yet to start.
The Sally business was just low comedy: human antics of a most com
mon sort which at times got so asinine as to he almost funny. But this
Hickman trial, barely under way, has produced something far worse.
Wednesday in the courtroom saw the first public appearance of the full
details of the crime. They were so utterly sickening that our sympathy
goes out to the legal officials who were forced to listen to the evidence.
Here, if ever, the press had a chance to use a little discrimination. The
afternoon papers, keeping abreast of the trial in each succeeding edition,
fairly shouted the revelations. At about 8:30 o'clock on Wednesday night
some twenty sheets of wire news came into the Daily office, eleven pages
of which were given over to a gruesome recital of the murder as brought
out in the day's proceedings. The San Francisco morning papers carried
the full account.
It is hard to imagine anybody but a slaughterhouse employee or a
police reporter reading the story clear through without suffering nausea.
The sex morbidity exhibited in the Sally debacle is fairly easy to under
stand, regrettable as it may be, but somehow we can't believe there is any
thing which even approaches a demand for bloody details of a murder, at
least on the part of the populace which is able to read.
We must conclude, then, that the press is clear in the wrong in sending
out such stuff. A certain amount of crime news is justified in order that
the public may not be lulled into a false sense of security, but when long
stretches of a murderer killing his victim or the last lewd detail of a drink
ing party in a hotel room are recounted in print the press can't escape a
charge of willful degradation of the public.
What's the price? The normal, intelligent person turns the page in
contempt; the less intelligent person reads a part or all of what is printed
about the scandal or murder and becomes still less intelligent; the low, de
praved, or borderline insane person reads it all and becomes a greater
menace to society. Even before Hickman had been brought to trial his
murder had been duplicated by a fiend in Michigan who stated when
caught that his mind had been led to dwell upon the crime by stories pub
lished about Hickman in Los Angeles.
Surely it is a sad state of affairs after almost 3000 years of civilization.

mon sort which at times got so asinine as to he almost funny. But this
Hickman trial, barely under way, has produced something far worse.
Wednesday in the courtroom saw the first public appearance of the full
details of the crime. They were so utterly sickening that our sympathy
goes out to the legal officials who were forced to listen to the evidence.
Here, if ever, the press had a chance to use a little discrimination. The
afternoon papers, keeping abreast of the trial in each succeeding edition,
fairly shouted the revelations. At about 8:30 o'clock on Wednesday night
some twenty sheets of wire news came into the Daily office, eleven pages
of which were given over to a gruesome recital of the murder as brought
out in the day's proceedings. The San Francisco morning papers carried
the full account.
It is hard to imagine anybody but a slaughterhouse employee or a
police reporter reading the story clear through without suffering nausea.
The sex morbidity exhibited in the Sally debacle is fairly easy to under
stand, regrettable as it may be, but somehow we can't believe there is any
thing which even approaches a demand for bloody details of a murder, at
least on the part of the populace which is able to read.
We must conclude, then, that the press is clear in the wrong in sending
out such stuff. A certain amount of crime news is justified in order that
the public may not be lulled into a false sense of security, but when long
stretches of a murderer killing his victim or the last lewd detail of a drink
ing party in a hotel room are recounted in print the press can't escape a
charge of willful degradation of the public.
What's the price? The normal, intelligent person turns the page in
contempt; the less intelligent person reads a part or all of what is printed
about the scandal or murder and becomes still less intelligent; the low, de
praved, or borderline insane person reads it all and becomes a greater
menace to society. Even before Hickman had been brought to trial his
murder had been duplicated by a fiend in Michigan who stated when
caught that his mind had been led to dwell upon the crime by stories pub
lished about Hickman in Los Angeles.
Surely it is a sad state of affairs after almost 3000 years of civilization.
We thought that tiie Sally case set a new low mark in journalism. We
were wrong, or too hasty—the Hickman trial had yet to start.
The Sally business was just low comedy: human antics of a most com
mon sort which at times got so asinine as to he almost funny. But this
Hickman trial, barely under way, has produced something far worse.
