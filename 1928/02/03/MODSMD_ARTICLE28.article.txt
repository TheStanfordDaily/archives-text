Election time is drawing near qnce more.
Nominations for several A.S.S.U. offices and all class offices (except
that of treasurer) will open Monday. Attention is called by the Election
Board to the rules covering nominations, a summary of which is given on
page 1 of today's Daily. The regular mid-year elections will be held on
Tuesday, February 14 (which, by the way, is St. Valentine's Day).
There is little that one can say about student elections without treading
on toes which are not as sensitive as they should be. Perhaps, however, as
a training school for American politics of the present day, the methods of
student politicians are justifiable.
