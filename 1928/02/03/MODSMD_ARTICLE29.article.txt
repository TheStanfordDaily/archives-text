Question —Could you please tell
me why the University makes
public every student's scholastic
average in the bawl-out? Does
any other university make schol
astic averages public?
Answer by J. Pearce Mitchell, Regis
trar —"Scholastic standings are pub
lished, first, to inform the student as
to his exact status here, and to pre
vent misunderstanding between him
and the office on the matter of cred
its; and second, to locate errors In
the University's record after posting
the bawl-out proofs and to prevent,
them from accumulating in our rec
ords."
"There are some other schools
■which make grades public, although
1 cannot say how many."
