## 
### 
Emil Ludwig says that his next
book will be the biography of an
American politician, no longer living.
He has selected the man but will
: withhold his name until later. He says
( that Thomas Edison, although a
| "groat scientist," is not typical enough
of the American people to suit the
j purposes of my book."
