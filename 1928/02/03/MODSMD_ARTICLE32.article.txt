AFTER DINNER DITTIES
Union —
Pretty good food —
It all tastes nice,
But what hurts most
Is the hellish price.
Encina—
Pretty good food-
It has been worse,
But plainness now
Is its greatest curse.
The Cellar
Pretty good food—
But not enough.
The waitresses embarrass
A Stanford Rough.
Home—
Darn good food —
Home's like heaven.
When I get home,
I eat for seven!

CABBAGES TO HAVE LOVE-LORN
COLUMN
Cabbages notes with alarm that
some Senior writes answers to love
letters in a city newspaper (consult
yesterday's editorials). We have se
cured Emma Forvor to take charge
of this feature. It will be called "Cry
on Emma's Shoulder." If you don't
think that you can sell your sins to
"True Confessions," mail them to us.
Emma will try to get you "on the
boat" again.—Ed.

"My roommate has to square him
self," announced Archie, as he en
tered the office yesterday afternoon.
"What happened?"
"That poem, 'A Lover's Lament,'
got my roommate in bad. That wasn't
to be printed."
So that is why we are printing the
following poem. It is our opinion that
anyone who must apologize for any
thing should stick to good old-fash
ioned prose:
AN APOLOGY
If I have caused you any pain
By writing this short ditty,
I promise henceforth to refrain
From trying to be witty.
These lir.e3 were written to inform,
And never to offend you;
Remember, if I make you storm,
I never did intend to.
Just whom "Lover's Lament" was by,
I'll tell, if you won't quote it.
Because it gripes my soul to lie,
I must confess L wrote it. —N.S.

These lir.e3 were written to inform,
And never to offend you;
Remember, if I make you storm,
I never did intend to.
Just whom "Lover's Lament" was by,
I'll tell, if you won't quote it.
Because it gripes my soul to lie,
I must confess L wrote it. —N.S.
