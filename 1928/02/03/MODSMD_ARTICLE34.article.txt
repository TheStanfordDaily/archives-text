IT SEEMS TO ME—
It was either Aesop, Socrates, or
perhaps Will ltogers who pertinently
remarked, "It's a funny world." One
is moved to believe that there is more
truth than triteness in that remark
when he reads "The President's
Daughter," a book that was published
last fall, and has since gone into
several editions.
Herein, one Nan Britton devotes
some four hundred styleless pages
(with illustrations) to informing the
world, in her own simple way, that
our deceased President, Warren G.
Harding, was tlio father of her ille
gitimate child, Elizabeth Ann Brit
ton. Not content with casting this
allegation in the face of society, she
proceeds, with nauseating frankness,
to "tell the whole story." She relates
the unhappy married life of Harding,
and how he found his longsought love
and beauty in this girl twenty years
his junior. Apologetically, Miss Brit
ton fails to recall certan names and
places that are pertinent, but with
accuracy and great detail she relates
incidents that are relevent.
The purpose of the publication of
the story is explained to be two-fold.
In the first place it is an economic
necessity for the support of Elizabeth
Ann. Secondly, it is a plea for the
"Unmarried mothers of the World."
Harding's family refused to recognize
Ann Britton, or to support the child,
so the story was offered for publica
tion and refused. The next move was
to organize the "Elizabeth Ann
Guild." Ostensibly, this was a founda
tion for the care and support of ille
gitimate children and their mothers,
but its main activity was the publica
tion of Ann Britton's story.
The truth or falsity of her state
ments is really immaterial. If they
are false, the story is blasphemous,
and society would be justified in con
demning and ostracizing her.
If her story is true, and she is
capable of the love and sincerity she
expresses, it is difficult to understand
how such a sacred, personal matter
could be given to a scandal-consuming
public—after her lover had been
called to the grave.
If the daughter in question IS the
child of Warren Harding, it would
seem that pride and loyalty would

make Elizabeth Ann a bond of undy
ing faith between Nan Britton and
Warren Harding, and not the basis
of linking the name of a President
with adultery.
For unmarried mothers generally,
society feels pity and sympathy, but
on those who capitalize their love
and deeds, neither should be wasted.
Yes, it is a funny world.
