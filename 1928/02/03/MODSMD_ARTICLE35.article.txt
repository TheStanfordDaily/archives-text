Gentlemen:
Recently i stopped ir> a little village
that consisted of about nine houses
and a small hotel, which I entered.
A little old man wearing a skull cap
was seated in a rocking-chair smoking
an enormous pipe. I had come to buy
a can of Edgeworth, but when I caught
a whiff of the tobacco he was smoking
I changed my mind. The aroma of
that tobacco was so delightful that I
made up my mind right then and there
that I wanted some of the same brand,
regardless of the cost.
I began with: "I beg your pardon,
sir, but 1 came in to buy a can of to
bacco, and I would like the same brand
you are smoking if you don't mind
telling me." He looked at me for a
mooient, grasped his pipe with one
hand and said: "I'm smoking Edge
worth. Would you like some?"
Of course I did, and I secured a
supply from the old fellow. The joke,
of course, was on me, but I went on
my way rejoicing.
Yours very truly,
Dr. John R. Koch
