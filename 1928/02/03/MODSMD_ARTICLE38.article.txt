# STEWART REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN OIL SCANDAL INQUIRY

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2—(U.P.) —
Unless Colonel Robert W. Stewart,
Chairman of the Board of the Stand
ard Oil Company of Indiana, tells the
Senate Teapot Dome Committee to
morrow whether he knows who got
any of the Continental Trading Corn
pan profits, part of which were traced
to Albert B. Fall, and whether he has
discussed the bond transactions with
Harry F. Sinclair, contempt proceed
ings will be started, Senator Thomas
Walsh of Montana said today.
Walsh wrestled with Stewart on the
stand but was unable to get any in
formation from him about questions
going to the heart of the money trans
actions which took place about the
time Fall and Sinclair closed the Tea
pot Dome deal. The famous Sena
torial inquisitor finally gave up and
Senator Nye of North Dakota, chair
man of the committee, a young man
in his early thirties who was called
from the desk of his country weekly
a few years ago to serve in the Sen
ate, modestly put two or three ques
tions.
"Did you discuss these bond trans
actions with Harry F. Sinclair or did
he discuss them with you?" Nye
asked, driving straight at the ques
tion which Walsh had omitted to put
directly.
"I don't think this line of interro
gation is relevant, material, or com
petent and I must respectfully decline
to answer," Stewart said.
