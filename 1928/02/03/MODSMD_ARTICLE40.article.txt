## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Feb. 1. — (P.I.P.) —The rule making it
a custom for University of California
professors to leave their classrooms
during examination periods was re
pealed yesterday.
Instead, under the announcement
made by President W. W. Campbell,
head of the Academic Senate at the
University, the individual professor
may remain during the examination
if he prefers. The choice, and the re
sponsibility, will be his.
Although students styled the move
as a death blow to the honor system,
university officials denied that it was
in any way derogatory to the student
honor.
President Campbell, in his report,
declared that the repeal of the rule
restored the precise conditions of
student self-government that were ef
fective until 1921. The rule, as it was,
made it difficult to apply remedial
action where it was most needed, he
said, accentuated failures, and caused
adverse criticism.
