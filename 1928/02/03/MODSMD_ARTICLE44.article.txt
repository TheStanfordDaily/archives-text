LOS ANGELES, Feb. 2— (P.I.P.)— j
Leo Calland's University of Southern
California basketball team, well on its
road to the first Pacific Coast Confer
ence title Trojan hoopsters ever won,
sustained a tough blow when Captain
Jack Bruner, center, leading point
getter on the Coast and regarded as a I

"cinch" bet for all-Conference honors,
was last week laid low by tonsilitis.
Calland fears that Bruner will be out
for the remainder of the season.
