The jumping pit on the women's
athletic field is being put into shapp
so that Marion Holley, '30, can prac
tice the running high jump in pre
paration for the Olympic Games this
summer. Miss Ilolley took second
place in this event at the women's
national track meet held at Eureka
in September. At the same meet she
broke the world's record in the liop
skip-and-jump, clearing 36 feet 2 and
7-8 inches.
Last year Miss Holley was a mem
ber of the Stanford women's all-star
hockey and basketball teams, as well
as being far ahead of her competitors
on track and field.
