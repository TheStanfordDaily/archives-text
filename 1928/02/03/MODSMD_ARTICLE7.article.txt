MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,
N.Y., Feb. 2. —Dr. Otto Peltzer, of
Germany, holder of the world's record
for the half-mile, provided a dramatic
climax to the historic Millrose A.A.
games in the Madison Square Garden
tonight by spurting from behind to
win the special invitational 1000-yard
run, feature event of an evening of
stirring performances by the pick of
American track and field athletes.
The German champion ran around
the field of nine middle-distance run
ners to follow in the foosteps of
Paavo Nurmi and score a smashing
triumph in his first American event.
Pressed by Ray Dodge
Dr. Peltzer was driven to the pace
by Ray Dodge, of the Illinois Athletic
Club, and had to extend himself to
win. J. L. Robinson, of the University
of Virginia, was third, hopelessly
outdistanced.
The time, 2:18 3-5, was far behind
the world mark for 1000 yards held by
Lloyd Hahn of the Boston A.A. at
2:12 4-5. It was a very creditable
performance when it was considered
that the German was making his first
start in a race on a board track.
Hahn Easy Winner
Lloyd Hahn won an easy victory in
the Wanamaker Mile, by the time of
4:18 3-5. A1 Miller, former Harvard
runner, and now of the Boston A.A.,
won the invitational scratch sprint
series, taking both the 40- and 50-
yard dashes.
The pole vault was disappointing
as far as performances went. Paul
Harrington of the Illinois Athletic
Club and B. Burlinger of the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania tied at 13 feet
for first place.
In the international 3000-meter
walk, Arthur T. Schwab of Berlin fin
ished second to Harry Hinkle of the
N.Y.A.C. The time was 12:59 flat.
