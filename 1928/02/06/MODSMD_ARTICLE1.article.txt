HAVANA, Feb. s.—The Sixth Pan
-American Conference has fully dem
onstrated that Latin America is unal
terably opposed to the principle of
intervention.
The Conference Committee on Pub
lic International Law has resolved
itself into a forum with practically
only two sides —Latin America against
the United States, the latter drawing
qualified support from Cuba and ac
tive assistance from Nicaragua and
Peru.
Lauded by Charles B. Hughes and
praised by the United States delega
tion, the report of Victor Maurtua of
Peru, virtually recognizing the right
of intervention has been sent to a
sub-committee loaded with more op
probrium than ever before has been
heaped upon an official project of a
Pan-American gathering.
Saturday was the worst day the
United States delegation to the Con
ference has yet experienced. It
brought abandonment of the East
Andean Pan-American Railway route
favored by United States engineers;
it saw defeat of the United States' ef
fort to obtain immediate considera
tion of trade-mark protection; and,
most important of all, it saw a hard
attack upon the most vital issue of
the Conference —intervention —which
Hughes had supported in committee
meetings.
Whatever the outcome of the pres
ent crisis, be it the downfall of Pan-
Americanism which is, at present,
largely of North American conception
or the birth of a new inter-American
confraternity resulting from compro
mise—which seems virtually impos
sible at this time —this Conference
will go down in history as having
given the United States an oppor
tunity to learn what are the unvar
nished views of Latin America on in
tervention.
