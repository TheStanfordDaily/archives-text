# STAY ON CAMPUS IS REQUEST OF DR. STOREY
## 
### 
Anxious parents have communi
cated with the University asking that
their sons and daughters come home
because of the poliomyelitis epidemic.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Public Health
Officer of the University, warns
strongly against students taking this
action.
In support of his admonition, he
presents the following reasons for
students to remain on the campus
and not go home.
(1) It is possible even though it is
not probable that a student on re
turning home may develop poliomye
litis and thus expose his family,
friends, and community to infection.
(2) Stanford is as safe as any place
and safer than most places in Cali
fornia. The measures adopted here
for the prevention, early detection,
immediate isolation and effective
treatment of campus cases of conta
gious disease are far superior to those
furnished in any ordinary home and
much better than can be found in
most communities.
(3) The probability of being ex
posed to poliomyelitis by careless
people and by people who do not be
lieve in disease is far greater off the
campus than on the campus.
(4) The high average of intelli
gence and the dominating spirit of
fair play characteristic of a university
campus community- have made it
much easier for us to carry out our
voluntary self-imposed program of de
fense than is possible in any general
community.
(5) The organization and regula
tions that we have set up for our pro
tection have been fully approved by
the state department of health and
by other public health authorities and
we are advised by all these that stu
dents should not leave the University.

by other public health authorities and
we are advised by all these that stu
dents should not leave the University.
