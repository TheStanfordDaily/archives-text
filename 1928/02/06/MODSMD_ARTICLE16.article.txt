# SCHEDULE OF MURAL TENNIS TOURNAMENT PLAY-OFFS CHANGED
## 
### 
Changes in the schedule for intra- j
mural tennis, which will prolong the .
competition a week, were announced !
yesterday by C. W. Davis. This move j
was the result of the rain over the
week-end which delayed all matches.
Three matches in the consolation
tournament were the only matches j
played.
Davis announced last night that I
the matches this week must be played j
at their arranged time as the new j
schedule can not be delayed. If any j
of the arranged times are not agree
able the teams must notify him at
once. Changes in time can be made
only through his office; failure to do j
this will mean default.
In the matches over the week-end ;
Chi Psi defeated Encina 3W in two
straight matches, Union defeated |
Kappa Alpha, and El Toro won by a |
default in the consolation tournament. '
Matches in the consolation tourna- i
ment will be played today, Wednes- j
day, and Friday. All the matches in |
the first two rounds are to be played
by next Saturday when third-round
competition will begin. There will be
a schedule arranged for this week.
The schedule for tomorrow's
matches at 1 o'clock follow. The ab
breviations are NTC —New Tennis j
