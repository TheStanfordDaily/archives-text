### 
CHICAGO, Feb. 5— (U.P.)—Prohi
bition agents descended on twelve of
the largest and most popular cabarets
in Chicago early today and obtained
evidence with which they hope to
close $3,000,000 worth of property for
a year.
The night clubs raided comprised
practically all of the well-known caba
rets in Chicago. At least half of them
have been running entirely unmo
lested for several years.
Most of the liquor was taken from
patrons, but waiters and managers
were also found with liquor on their
persons and a few of the places had
liquor hidden in the kitchens.
