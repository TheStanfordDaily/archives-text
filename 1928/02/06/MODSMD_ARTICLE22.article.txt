# "FRANCE AND WORLD PEACE" TO BE TOPIC FOR JOFFRE DEBATE
## 
### 
"France and World Peace" is the
general subject selected by California
for the Joffre debate with Stanford to
be held daring the spring quarter at
Berkeley. As California will be the
home school, Stanford had the privi
lege of suggesting the topics from
which the Bears made their choice.
Last year "France and Italy" was the
general topic studied.
Stanford's representatives, Philip
Cavalero, Robert Hume, and Herbert
Wenig, recently chosen at tryouts,
will begin work on the question im
mediately. Because of the fact that a
specific subject is selected just one
hour before the debate, an intensive
and wide study covering all phases
of the general topic will be made. The
Cardinal speakers are requested to
meet Professor Emerson this after
noon at 3 o'clock in Room 2038.
