While Stanford's athletic program at present is at a standstill, there
is now a considerable discussion of the place or places at which the
Stanford-California basketball series should be played. General Manager
Masters yesterday intimated that there was a strong possibility that all of
the series might be played at the Kezar Court in San Francisco. The
l'aculty Athletic Committee will probably decide on this matter tonight.
The original schedule called for one game at Stanford 011 February 18,
one at the Oakland Auditorium 011 February 25, and the final game, if
necessary, was planned for the Kezar Pavilion. Complications arose
when it was learned that the Oakland Auditorium will be used for a horse
show from February 18 to 25 and, hence, could not be secured for the
second tilt.
Now it is suggested, since California cannot play in ''home territory,"
that the entire series be scheduled at Kezar. Harmon Gym, on the
California campus, has a smaller seating capacity than either the Stanford
Pavilion or Kezar (which has the largest). As a solution to the problem
it is now suggested that all three of the games be played at Kezar. By
this arrangement, too, neither team would have the "advantage" of playing
on a "home court." California, we take it, would much prefer to see this
scheme adopted.
In fairness to the Stanford students, since Blue and Gold fans must
cross the bay in either case, we think that the best course which can be
adopted is to play the first game of the series in the Stanford Pavilion
where it was originally scheduled, and play the next one (or two) at
Kezar. Then, at least, one of the games can be in a place where the
students of both universities would not be inconvenienced.
