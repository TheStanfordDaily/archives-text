# STUDENTS IN COLLEGE CONSCIOUS OF LIMITS, ADVANTAGES-SOARES
## 
### 
"I think when we are in college we
are quite as conscious oÂ£ our limita
tions as we are of our opportunities,"
said Reverend Theodore G. Soares of
Chicago in his sermon at the Memor
ial Church yesterday. "Here you are
with nothing to do but learn the
meaning of life. You ought to enjoy
your opportunities," he advised. "The
chain of routine seems to hold you
back."
He told of the great work which
Paul accomplished while chained to
a Roman soldier; he called Paul the
"messenger in chains." We all ought
to be this, according to Soares.
"There is no revelation of character
so significant as what we do under
our limitations," he said.
After the sermon a forum was held
in which Dr. Soares answered various
questions concerning religion and the
youth of today. Next Sunday Rever
end Edward L. Parsons, Bishop of
California, will give the sermon.
Morning chapel will be at 7:50 o'clock
every day.
