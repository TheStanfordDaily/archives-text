"Goat Song," Player's Guild, San
Francisco, by Franz Werfel (Ruth
Langener, translator).
Costumed like a pageant, and at j
times staged almost like a tableau, j
the "Goat Song" goes on for five acts j
with an almost incredible increase of!
dramatic tensity. There are weak mo-1
ments occasionally, that you attri
bute to the translator, but they do
not materially interrupt the fine
movement of the play itself.
It is a difficult play, indeed, but
extraordinarily well produced. Regi
nald Travers, the director, should be ,
congratulated 011 his fine handling of
it. The handicap is, of course, with !
the theme and the audience. You have
three methods of procedure in your j
reactions: one, if you are very clever,
you understand it; two, if you are
agile, but not clever, you may inter- j
pret it for yourself; and lastly, if you 1
are honest, admit, "It's beautiful, but
I don't quite get it." We recommend i
the second way of telling your friends
about it.
The first act is a little unfortunate 1
in being too ostensibly, ostentatiously,
and oppressively drama! ic for com- j
fort, and leaves you apprehensive of i
what is to come. Babka, the old ser
vant (who, incidentally is very well
done indeed by Elsa Heyman), is more
like a German Mammy Peasant than |
necessary, first shot, and the tempo j
of the rich man of the village and his j
wife, as they disclose their evil secret j
confidentially to the audience, is al
most ludicrous.
However, with the second act and
a better mob than is often seen, the
play swings into stride, and there
upon increases with every speech,
gesture, and incident, to a climax of
appalling terror and beauty. The
third act, with the frenzied hungry
army of gypsies, their weird litany,
and astounding sacrifice, is tremen- J
dous. With the inadequate supply of I
adjectives of honor in the English J
language, it is impossible to give any
conception of it.
"Goat Song," whether it drives you j
into a defense reaction of blatant low- j
browism or not, leaves you a little ,
"fey," with weird dreams. It will play
two weeks longer, and not only be- j
cause of its high merit, but because !
it is decidedly a subject for contro-1
versy, we recommend it whole-heart- j
edly. —H.J.K. j

"Lazarus Laughed," by Eugene O'-
Neill. Boni & Liveright, New York, i
Now coines Eugene O'Neill with a !
play that dramatizes, so it seems to
me, the fundamental thesis of modern
metaphysical idealism. This is not to
say that O'Neill, greatest of American
dramatists, had any particular cult or
religion in mind when he wrote the
play; but the fact remains that his
Lazarus, throughout the scenes, and
particularly at the spectacular catas
trophe, "demonstrates" the victory of
life over death and the grave.
Brought back from death by Christ,
he strives to teach men by his "eter
nal laughter" that death is but a
transient phenomenon, a meaningless
organic gesture—and as O'Neill pre
sents him neither the slurs of his kin
dred, the soldiery of Rome, nor the
cruel might of Tiberius are able to
prevail against him. He fades from
earth in a ripple of laughter, con
scious to the end of that immortality
which his first death had taught him.
The appeal of "Lazarus Laughed"
will depend largely on the reader —or
the spectator, if it is produced. O'-
Neill's achievement in this play, from
any point of view, however, must be
regarded as a great one. He perhaps
alone of living dramatists could have
done it. The action progresses in
complete harmony with the majestic
theme. The figure of Lazarus him
self carries that supernatural convic
tion, that emphasis beyond tho hu
man, only to be found in Holy Writ
or the writings of the great epic.
It is an interesting commentary on
genius that Eugene O'Neill has so
easily turned from a fundamental pes
simism of such a play as "Marco
i" ■

i Millions" to scale the heights of op
timism in this one.

According to the quaint notions of
modern psychology, "The Wayward
Man" by St. John Ervine, published
! by Macmillan, is an excellent study
j of complexes, mainly of the "inferi
ority" type. A simpler viewpoint of
j this book is to regard it as a study of
| a man beset by relatives.
"Darkie" Dunwoody is not an ordi
! nary character and Mr. Ervine main
| tains his distinctiveness through a
| maze of meticulously detailed events.
It is a series of maternal prohibitions
' followed through years, then dropped
when he seeks the freedom of the
, sea, only to return again more inten
sified when he comes back to Belfast
after years spent on the ocean.

The first act is a little unfortunate 1
in being too ostensibly, ostentatiously,
and oppressively drama! ic for com- j
fort, and leaves you apprehensive of i
what is to come. Babka, the old ser
vant (who, incidentally is very well
done indeed by Elsa Heyman), is more
like a German Mammy Peasant than |
necessary, first shot, and the tempo j
of the rich man of the village and his j
wife, as they disclose their evil secret j
confidentially to the audience, is al
most ludicrous.
However, with the second act and
a better mob than is often seen, the
play swings into stride, and there
upon increases with every speech,
gesture, and incident, to a climax of
appalling terror and beauty. The
third act, with the frenzied hungry
army of gypsies, their weird litany,
and astounding sacrifice, is tremen- J
dous. With the inadequate supply of I
adjectives of honor in the English J
language, it is impossible to give any
conception of it.
"Goat Song," whether it drives you j
into a defense reaction of blatant low- j
browism or not, leaves you a little ,
"fey," with weird dreams. It will play
two weeks longer, and not only be- j

it is decidedly a subject for contro-1

"Lazarus Laughed," by Eugene O'-
Neill. Boni & Liveright, New York, i
Now coines Eugene O'Neill with a !
play that dramatizes, so it seems to
me, the fundamental thesis of modern
metaphysical idealism. This is not to
say that O'Neill, greatest of American
dramatists, had any particular cult or
religion in mind when he wrote the
play; but the fact remains that his
Lazarus, throughout the scenes, and
particularly at the spectacular catas
trophe, "demonstrates" the victory of
life over death and the grave.
Brought back from death by Christ,
he strives to teach men by his "eter
nal laughter" that death is but a
transient phenomenon, a meaningless
organic gesture—and as O'Neill pre
sents him neither the slurs of his kin
dred, the soldiery of Rome, nor the
cruel might of Tiberius are able to
prevail against him. He fades from
earth in a ripple of laughter, con
scious to the end of that immortality
which his first death had taught him.
The appeal of "Lazarus Laughed"
will depend largely on the reader —or
the spectator, if it is produced. O'-
Neill's achievement in this play, from
any point of view, however, must be
regarded as a great one. He perhaps
alone of living dramatists could have
done it. The action progresses in
complete harmony with the majestic
theme. The figure of Lazarus him
self carries that supernatural convic
tion, that emphasis beyond tho hu
man, only to be found in Holy Writ
or the writings of the great epic.
It is an interesting commentary on
genius that Eugene O'Neill has so
easily turned from a fundamental pes
simism of such a play as "Marco
i" ■

i Millions" to scale the heights of op
timism in this one.

According to the quaint notions of
modern psychology, "The Wayward
Man" by St. John Ervine, published
! by Macmillan, is an excellent study
j of complexes, mainly of the "inferi

j this book is to regard it as a study of
| a man beset by relatives.
"Darkie" Dunwoody is not an ordi
! nary character and Mr. Ervine main

It is a series of maternal prohibitions

"Goat Song," Player's Guild, San

Langener, translator).
Costumed like a pageant, and at j
times staged almost like a tableau, j
the "Goat Song" goes on for five acts j
with an almost incredible increase of!
dramatic tensity. There are weak mo-1
ments occasionally, that you attri
bute to the translator, but they do
not materially interrupt the fine
movement of the play itself.
It is a difficult play, indeed, but
extraordinarily well produced. Regi
nald Travers, the director, should be ,
congratulated 011 his fine handling of
it. The handicap is, of course, with !
the theme and the audience. You have
three methods of procedure in your j
reactions: one, if you are very clever,
you understand it; two, if you are
agile, but not clever, you may inter- j
pret it for yourself; and lastly, if you 1
are honest, admit, "It's beautiful, but
I don't quite get it." We recommend i

"Lazarus Laughed," by Eugene O'-
Neill. Boni & Liveright, New York, i
Now coines Eugene O'Neill with a !
play that dramatizes, so it seems to
me, the fundamental thesis of modern
metaphysical idealism. This is not to
say that O'Neill, greatest of American
dramatists, had any particular cult or
religion in mind when he wrote the
play; but the fact remains that his
Lazarus, throughout the scenes, and
particularly at the spectacular catas
trophe, "demonstrates" the victory of
life over death and the grave.
Brought back from death by Christ,
he strives to teach men by his "eter
nal laughter" that death is but a
transient phenomenon, a meaningless
organic gesture—and as O'Neill pre
sents him neither the slurs of his kin
dred, the soldiery of Rome, nor the
cruel might of Tiberius are able to
prevail against him. He fades from
earth in a ripple of laughter, con
scious to the end of that immortality
which his first death had taught him.
The appeal of "Lazarus Laughed"
will depend largely on the reader —or
the spectator, if it is produced. O'-
Neill's achievement in this play, from
any point of view, however, must be
regarded as a great one. He perhaps
alone of living dramatists could have
done it. The action progresses in
complete harmony with the majestic
theme. The figure of Lazarus him
self carries that supernatural convic
tion, that emphasis beyond tho hu
man, only to be found in Holy Writ
or the writings of the great epic.
It is an interesting commentary on
genius that Eugene O'Neill has so
easily turned from a fundamental pes
simism of such a play as "Marco
i" ■

i Millions" to scale the heights of op
timism in this one.

According to the quaint notions of
modern psychology, "The Wayward
Man" by St. John Ervine, published
! by Macmillan, is an excellent study
j of complexes, mainly of the "inferi
ority" type. A simpler viewpoint of
j this book is to regard it as a study of
| a man beset by relatives.
"Darkie" Dunwoody is not an ordi
! nary character and Mr. Ervine main
| tains his distinctiveness through a
| maze of meticulously detailed events.
It is a series of maternal prohibitions
' followed through years, then dropped
when he seeks the freedom of the
, sea, only to return again more inten
sified when he comes back to Belfast
after years spent on the ocean.

"Goat Song," Player's Guild, San
Francisco, by Franz Werfel (Ruth
Langener, translator).
Costumed like a pageant, and at j
times staged almost like a tableau, j
the "Goat Song" goes on for five acts j
with an almost incredible increase of!
dramatic tensity. There are weak mo-1
ments occasionally, that you attri
bute to the translator, but they do
not materially interrupt the fine
movement of the play itself.
It is a difficult play, indeed, but
extraordinarily well produced. Regi
nald Travers, the director, should be ,
congratulated 011 his fine handling of
it. The handicap is, of course, with !
the theme and the audience. You have
three methods of procedure in your j
reactions: one, if you are very clever,
you understand it; two, if you are
agile, but not clever, you may inter- j
pret it for yourself; and lastly, if you 1
are honest, admit, "It's beautiful, but
I don't quite get it." We recommend i
the second way of telling your friends
about it.
The first act is a little unfortunate 1
in being too ostensibly, ostentatiously,
and oppressively drama! ic for com- j
fort, and leaves you apprehensive of i
what is to come. Babka, the old ser
vant (who, incidentally is very well
done indeed by Elsa Heyman), is more
like a German Mammy Peasant than |
necessary, first shot, and the tempo j
of the rich man of the village and his j
wife, as they disclose their evil secret j
confidentially to the audience, is al
most ludicrous.
However, with the second act and
a better mob than is often seen, the
play swings into stride, and there
upon increases with every speech,
gesture, and incident, to a climax of
appalling terror and beauty. The
third act, with the frenzied hungry
army of gypsies, their weird litany,
and astounding sacrifice, is tremen- J
dous. With the inadequate supply of I
adjectives of honor in the English J
language, it is impossible to give any
conception of it.
