The Editor, Sir:
I have just finished reading
Creagh's peroration of R. W. Neal's
article that appeared in this column
some few days ago. Mr. Neal suffers
from the same affliction as I, that is,
we both try to write convincingly
without knowing how to express our
selves. Mr. Creagli seems to suffer
just the opposite.
Neal wandered off into a maze of
Inspiring phrases and adjectives that
destroyed the force of any message
that he might have had to convey to
a snickering student body, Mr. Creagli
among others. His exaggeration of
the severity of this poliomyelitis epi
demic is a bit absurd of course, but
one might well stop and consider that
Neal might be partially right, and
that there was some need for a little
personal care. No doubt this was
Neal's idea until he flung all restraint
to the winds and gave his imagina
tion free play.
Mr. Creagh will ferment a snappy
comeback to this note. It is expected
of him. He is the type that gazes
fondly down the mouth of the can
non, all the while assuring others
that there isn't the slightest danger
in doing such a clownish trick, until
the projectile and he both start on a
long, long voyage at practically the
same time. Let us hope that he will
spare the Daily readers from other
lightning-like lashes of his all-com
prehending intellect and wit.
Personally I have never seen either
of the two individuals mentioned
here, but Creagh's narrowminded ridi
cule of a sincere and justifiable con
cern for the good of the University is
worthy of comment.
