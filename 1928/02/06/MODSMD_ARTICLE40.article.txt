# DATE FOR MASQUERS FLAY TO BE CHOSEN BY DRAMATIC HEADS
## Postponement of English Club Production Until Spring Quarter Considered 
### 
Arrangements for the postponed
staging of "The Romantic Young
Lady" will be made this afternoon at
a meeting of the Dramatic Council.
Selection of February 24 or a date
about tliat time will probably be made
for the Masquers play which previous
ly was scheduled for this Friday eve
ning.
Because of the proximity of this
date to the English Club play on
March 2, and on account of the lack
of time for ticket arrangements, and
the detailed work in the staging of
Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," indi
cations are that it will be postponed
until the spring quarter.
Rehearsals for "The Romantic
Young Lady" are progressing smooth
ly. Scrip books have been laid aside
and the varying incidents of the play
will be knit together in rehearsals
during the week. A rehearsal will be
held tonight at 7:15 o'clock in the
Assembly IJall where the setting for
the first act has been built.
