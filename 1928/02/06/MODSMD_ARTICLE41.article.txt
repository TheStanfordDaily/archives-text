"No entirely satisfactory methods
have yet been devised for predicting
with certainty the mental diseases of
the adolescent period," Professor E.
K. Strong of the Psychology depart
ment told members of the Addison
Avenue Parent-Teachers Association
Friday night in an address on "Some
Recent Movements in Child Study."
Professor Strong believes, how
ever, that if children are studied all
through their lives and records kept,
it should be possible to trace back
and understand the symptoms leading
to the development of any abnor
mality.
This angle of approach to these
problems is part of a very recent
movement, he said. Methods origi
nating with Binet have since been
modified and perfected by other psy
chologists and educators.
