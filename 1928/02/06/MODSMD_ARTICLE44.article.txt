# COACH CLAIMS CARD DIVERS FORM TEAM UNEQUALLED IN U.S.
## 
### 
"Stanford's divers form a combina
tion of six which is unequalled in
this country," said Coach Ernst
Brandsten last week when asked to
state just how the Cardinal team
stands in national circles.
Brandsten, as coach of the Ameri
can Olympic diving team which will
go to Amsterdam next summer, an
nounced that Bert Marsh, a freshman
who is getting his first year of instruc
tion, is showing remarkable talent.
He has mastered all the dives from a
one-and-a-half gainer to a two-and-a
half front flip, and is very possibly
of championship class.
The "unequalled combination" con
sists of Marsh, Kenney, Desjardins,
Throndson, Mills, and Fall. Desjardins
and Fall are Olympic champions of
proven ability, and Mills and Kenney
are old hands at the game, who can
achieve first-rate form at any time
by a little hard work. Throndson is a
sophomore who, like Marsh, is still
coming into his own, and will improve
with experience in competition.
Desjardins, three-time national
champion, has just recovered from a
shin-splint which has cramped his
style for more than a month. The
diminutive freshman has limited his
practice to standing dives, but Brand
sten now feels that he can do them
all without injury.
