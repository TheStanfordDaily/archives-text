# Autopsy to Be Performed On Chicago Banker's Son
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5.—(U.P.)—
Autopsy will be performed here to
morrow over the body of Darby Day,
Jr., son of the millionaire Chicago
banker and insurance company execu
tive, who died Saturday under an
anesthetic at the Mary T. Martin Hos
pital in Santa Monica. Death occurred
while physicians were preparing to
operate on him for an abdominal ab
cess.
Young Day gained considerable
mention three years ago when his
young wife, Bernice Day, threw acid
in his face. Subsequently she served
a prison term for the act and Day
received a divorce.
Death probably was due to heart
disease accentuated by the anes
thetic, physicians said.
