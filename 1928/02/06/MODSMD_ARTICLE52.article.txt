# SPORTS OF 1928

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
A flash of steel blades —a figure,
flying down the frozen Burface of the j
rink —a bit of clever skating and stick ,
handling that gets him by the defense,
a feint as though to shoot to one cor-.
ner of the goal, and smash! Howie!
Morenz has hurtled the puck into the '
other side of the net for a goal, and
now goes skating gracefully amidst i
the applause of the multitude.
What a streak of lightening he is
on the ice! Skates like a thunder
boldt launched by Zenus, and strikes
twice as accurately, and more nearly
in the same place! In the All-Star
team for 1926-'27 selected by the man- 1
agers of the ten National Hockey ,
League clubs, Morenz received eight
votes for center, more than any other
player at any position. Combined
with Joliat and Gagne, he forms an
almost unbeatable combination, the
greatest front line in hockey today—
or any day, for that matter. Howie
Morenz, however, is the main cog in
this remarkable triumvirate, the j
brightest star of the fast-flying Ca-i

nadians of Montreal.
Being unanimously chosen as the j
greatest offensive threat in the N H L. i
is no slight honor, yet fe\£ would,
have any other cnoice than huwie i
this season, because of his scintillat- j
ing work. He never seems to tire or j
slow up, he shoots without getting '
set, and is almost as valuable on de- !
fense, being a star at poke and sweep
checking, and all the other intrica
cies of this exciting game.
