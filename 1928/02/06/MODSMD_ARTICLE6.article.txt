# CARDINAL BASEBALL MEN PREPARING FOR SANTA CLARA GAME
## Coach Wolter Concentrating On Batting Practice; Defense Strong 
### 
With the cancellation of the Olym
pic Club game slated for this Satur
day because of the paralysis epidemic
Stanford's varsity baseball squad will
have no opportunity to perfect its
machine with outside competition he
force the opening tilt of the California
Intercollegiate Easeball Association
with Santa Clara on February 18.
There is little doubt but that the date
with the Broncos will be kept provid
ing there are 110 new cases of paraly
sis.
The freshman game with Polytech
nic High School of San Francisco
dated for the local diamond on the
same week-end has also been called
off. This being the first yearling game
of the season was to have given
Coach Wolter a line 011 the 1931 men.
It is quite probable that the engage
ment with San Mateo Junior College
on February 18 will be kept.
For the next two weeks Wolter,
profiting by the lessons learned in the
Kenealy Seal encounter, will devote
his time to developing the batting eye
of his varsity men. Stanford's defen
sive work this season should keep
their opponents' tallies down to a
minimum. But the best pitcher in the
world can only keep the score tied
and intensive batting price will be
the order of the day in anticipation
of the Santa Clara game. Rain halted
practice most of last week.
