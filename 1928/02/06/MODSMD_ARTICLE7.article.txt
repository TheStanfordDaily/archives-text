LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5— (U.P.)—
Governor A1 Smith of New York may
not enter the coming presidential race
despite the agitation in his favor and
the general opinion that be will be a
candidate, John F. Hylan, former
mayor of New York, said tonight.
Hylan based his opinion not on the
opposition of McAdoo and certain
leaders of the "Solid South" but
rather on the belief that Smith can
make a stronger race four years
hence.
"Many Democratic leaders are of
the opinion that Smith will be almost
certain of election in 1932 if he with
holds his candidacy from the 1928
race," Hylan said. "And Smith is
under considerable pressure to with
draw until after the coming election."
