# WILL NOT RESUME MURAL GAMES AS RUMORED
## 
### 
Basketball and other intramural
activities will not be resumed to
day, as was previously intimated
by Charles W. Davis, director of
intramural sports. Play was dis
continued last Tuesday because
of the infantile paralysis situa
tion.
The schedule of the various
sports will be rearranged before
play is resumed. Only twelve
teams remain undefeated among
the fifty-one contestants in the
basketball tournament. Tennis
and handball (on a four-walled
court) are the only intramural
sports which are being continued.
Other intramural sports, golf,
handball, track, and cross-coun
try, have been completed.
