### 
j PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 6.—
1 (U.P.) —Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh
| neared the end of his good will trail to
day, flying 160 miles fom Santo Domingo
j to Haiti, to be entliusiastically greeted by
! silk-hatted officials, American Marines,
i and superstitious natives from the wild
interior.
j On Wednesday he leaves for his final
! destination, Havana and the Pan Anieri
j can Conference, ending a circuitous flight
i of several thousand miles which began in
i Washington and has taken him to Mexico,
Central America, South America, and
the Caribbean Islands.
j Fully 100,000 persons joined in tumul
! tous greetings of Lindbergh as his plane
! landed on Bourne Field—named after an
American marine—and as he headed the
parade to the home of American High
1 Commissioner Russell.
! The Order of Merit, never before
'■ awarded to a white man, will be given to
j Lindbergh by President Borno. It is the
! highest honor Haiti can give.
It took Lindbergh almost three hours to
fly here, but he took a northerly rounda
bout route from Santo Domingo, instead
i of the 160-mile airline route.
.
Another 160 miles of airline stretches
between Haiti and Cuba. But Lindbergh
is expected to skirt the northern end of
i Cuba and follow the coast to Havana, a
; distance of about 720 miles.
