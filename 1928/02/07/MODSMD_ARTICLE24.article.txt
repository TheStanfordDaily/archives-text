I . '
The revised regulations for Stan tori
, women were passed at meetings of the
| women in their living groups last night,
j and will go into effect immediately,
j Women's Conference and Council have
I been studying conditions on the campus
j this year, and have formulated the new
i rules.
The principal changes which have been
I made in the rules are:
I. Sophomore, junior, and senior wom
en may have 1 :30 leave on Friday and
Saturday nights by signing name and
destinations. Formerly 1 :30 leave was
allowed only for 1 o'clock dances, or for
the theatre or dancing in San Francisco
or San Jose. Freshmen women may have
1:30 leave in these latter instances, and
may sign out for 11:30 for movies in
Palo Alto.
11. Men may stay in the women's halls
and houses until 1 :30 o'clock on Friday
and Saturday nights. Formerly they had
to leave at 11:30 p.m.
111. A woman may enter any men's
living group providing another woman is
present. According to the old rules, a
chaperon had to be present.
IV. Freshmen women may motor after
dark in parties of four or more. For
merly they could not do so except as
means of conveyance between their homes
and the campus, or Palo Alto and the
campus, unless chaperoned by a senior
woman.
It will be considered as against the
spirit of the rules for a woman to stay
over night in Palo Alto or San Francisco
in order to evade the 1 :30 regulation.
'1 he wording of the rules in some cases
has been changed to make their meaning
more clear, and a few regulations which
were considered unnecessary have been
dropped. This revision was started last
spring, and Conference and Council have
been working constantly in changing them.
