# The 						Rules of the Game
## 
### 
The result of last spring's agitation over the women's lockout rules is
presented in this issue of the Daily. This revised code, accepted last
night by votes taken in the various women's living groups, shows through
four major changes evidence of an increase in liberality. As the rules
no wstand, it may be safely said that they are among the most liberal in
the universities and colleges of the country.
The chief changes may be listed as: I. Women may have unrestricted
1 :30 leave 011 Friday and Saturday nights upon signing names and desti
nations in the registration book at the various living groups. On other
nights they must secure permission from the Women's Council. 11. Men
may stay in women's living groups until 1 :30 on Friday and Saturday
nights. IH. Freshmen women may motor after dark in groups of four
or more. IV. Two or more Stanford women may now enter a men's living
group.
Upon comparison with the former rules it will be seen that the changes
in the new code are not of far-reaching consequence. The changes were
as great as Conference could make at this time. The act of a member of
Women's Council granting permission to an applicant for late leave is in
the great majority of cases merely a gesture because of the freedom with
which the leaves are granted. For week-ends now, 1 :30 leave is auto
matic and unrestricted. This rule has cleared away several old regulations
about "second shows in Palo Alto" and other cases, and is a simplification
as well as an increase in liberality.
Change number II varies its importance in direct proportion with the
number of men who may care to play bridge, listen to a victrola, or engage
in some other social occupation in a women's living group. Change num
ber 111 has stated the number of freshman women who may motor after
dark without a chaperone as required before. The efifect of this upon
Stanford women will not be noticeable—a generalization which may be
made o fall the changes. Change number IV shows possibilities of infor
mal bridge games between men and women in men's living groups.
Save for rewording and clarification, these changes constitute the bulk
of the revision of the regulations for the women of Stanford University.
Now this set of rules (remember that it is liberal compared with other
colleges and universities) is the result of a great deal of work on the part
of the members of Women's Council, Conference, and Dean Alary Yost
who represented the University's concern in the matter. Any regulations
are subject to criticism, either because of too much liberality or because of
too much stringency. And, aside from criticism, account must be taken
of social conditions, possible in 2 uence upon health, what the majority of
the women want, and what the University authorities think should be the
regulations. Wasn't it Tacitus who first remarked that it was a "very
hard undertaking to attempt to please everyone" ?

made o fall the changes. Change number IV shows possibilities of infor
mal bridge games between men and women in men's living groups.
Save for rewording and clarification, these changes constitute the bulk
of the revision of the regulations for the women of Stanford University.
Now this set of rules (remember that it is liberal compared with other
colleges and universities) is the result of a great deal of work on the part
of the members of Women's Council, Conference, and Dean Alary Yost
who represented the University's concern in the matter. Any regulations
are subject to criticism, either because of too much liberality or because of
too much stringency. And, aside from criticism, account must be taken
of social conditions, possible in 2 uence upon health, what the majority of
the women want, and what the University authorities think should be the
regulations. Wasn't it Tacitus who first remarked that it was a "very
hard undertaking to attempt to please everyone" ?
The result of last spring's agitation over the women's lockout rules is
presented in this issue of the Daily. This revised code, accepted last
night by votes taken in the various women's living groups, shows through
four major changes evidence of an increase in liberality. As the rules
no wstand, it may be safely said that they are among the most liberal in
the universities and colleges of the country.
The chief changes may be listed as: I. Women may have unrestricted
1 :30 leave 011 Friday and Saturday nights upon signing names and desti
nations in the registration book at the various living groups. On other
nights they must secure permission from the Women's Council. 11. Men
may stay in women's living groups until 1 :30 on Friday and Saturday
nights. IH. Freshmen women may motor after dark in groups of four
or more. IV. Two or more Stanford women may now enter a men's living
group.
Upon comparison with the former rules it will be seen that the changes
in the new code are not of far-reaching consequence. The changes were
as great as Conference could make at this time. The act of a member of
Women's Council granting permission to an applicant for late leave is in
the great majority of cases merely a gesture because of the freedom with
which the leaves are granted. For week-ends now, 1 :30 leave is auto
matic and unrestricted. This rule has cleared away several old regulations
about "second shows in Palo Alto" and other cases, and is a simplification
as well as an increase in liberality.
Change number II varies its importance in direct proportion with the
number of men who may care to play bridge, listen to a victrola, or engage
in some other social occupation in a women's living group. Change num
ber 111 has stated the number of freshman women who may motor after
dark without a chaperone as required before. The efifect of this upon
Stanford women will not be noticeable—a generalization which may be
made o fall the changes. Change number IV shows possibilities of infor
mal bridge games between men and women in men's living groups.
