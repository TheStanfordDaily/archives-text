Maryland was recently the scene
of another "trick" marriage. To make
it a bit more unconventional, the par
ticipants labeled it a "partnership
marriage," and were careful to an
nounce it was NOT a companionate
relationship, though it has all the
trademarks of the latter.
It may be justly referred to as a
"trick" marriage, because the proce
dure was a little in "advance" of
what we generally consider the cus
tomary way to celebrate such an
event. The wedding was held in the
cellar of the bridegroom's fraternity
house —the groom had sentimental
reasons, no doubt. Fraternity broth
ers, dressed as blushing bridesmaids,
harmonized with a jazz band that
played during the ceremony. The
name of the selection, however, was
not mentioned, and it will be left to
the imagination of the reader to con
jure up an appropriate melody.
The couple stated that they regard
ed a marriage ceremony unnecessary,
but had one —to be conventional. The
ring, however, was omitted, and that
revered and classic pledge, "till death
do us part," was changed to mean
"till love dies," and each assumed the
burden of self-support; thus, they
were married.
The foregoing will no doubt lead
most of us to unpack and dust off our
ideas of the marriage relationship,
and see if they are in good working
order. We find that the companionate

marrage has become enough of an
issue to merit our consideration and
frank discussion regardless of wheth
er or not we agree with its premises.
We observe that there is something
wrong in the present scheme of social
relationships, and some room for im
provement in our marital theories
and practice. After due deliberation
we may arrive at the conclusion that
there is something to be said for cer
tain reform in the conventional mar
riage and its attendant responsibili
ties. However, it seems to me that
most of us are a bit loathe to admit
Lhat a "burlesque" marriage is a wise
start for such a career. True, after
looking at some brides and grooms,
we may be forced to admit that mar
riage has its humorous aspect, but
that is beside the point.
The apparent weakness of such a
"partnership marriage" lies in the
fact that inexperienced youth may
mistake a hasty quarrel as the "swan
song" of love, and, recalling the tacit
understanding that the relationship is
to last "only so long as love lives,"
beat a hasty retreat to an attorney.
Our little romance takes a hurried
trip from cellar to divorce court, and
the"I told you so's" chant their aria
of gloom.
The rest of us go about our busi
ness, tend to our own petty troubles,
and wonder just what WILL be the
final outcome of a "jazz wedding."

issue to merit our consideration and
frank discussion regardless of wheth

We observe that there is something
wrong in the present scheme of social
relationships, and some room for im
provement in our marital theories
and practice. After due deliberation
we may arrive at the conclusion that
there is something to be said for cer
tain reform in the conventional mar
riage and its attendant responsibili
ties. However, it seems to me that
most of us are a bit loathe to admit
Lhat a "burlesque" marriage is a wise
start for such a career. True, after
looking at some brides and grooms,
we may be forced to admit that mar
riage has its humorous aspect, but
that is beside the point.
The apparent weakness of such a
"partnership marriage" lies in the
fact that inexperienced youth may
mistake a hasty quarrel as the "swan
song" of love, and, recalling the tacit
understanding that the relationship is
to last "only so long as love lives,"
beat a hasty retreat to an attorney.
Our little romance takes a hurried
trip from cellar to divorce court, and
the"I told you so's" chant their aria
of gloom.
The rest of us go about our busi

final outcome of a "jazz wedding."

Maryland was recently the scene
of another "trick" marriage. To make
it a bit more unconventional, the par
ticipants labeled it a "partnership
marriage," and were careful to an
nounce it was NOT a companionate
relationship, though it has all the
trademarks of the latter.
It may be justly referred to as a
"trick" marriage, because the proce
dure was a little in "advance" of
what we generally consider the cus
tomary way to celebrate such an
event. The wedding was held in the
cellar of the bridegroom's fraternity
house —the groom had sentimental
reasons, no doubt. Fraternity broth
ers, dressed as blushing bridesmaids,
harmonized with a jazz band that
played during the ceremony. The
name of the selection, however, was
not mentioned, and it will be left to
the imagination of the reader to con
jure up an appropriate melody.
The couple stated that they regard
ed a marriage ceremony unnecessary,
but had one —to be conventional. The
ring, however, was omitted, and that
revered and classic pledge, "till death
do us part," was changed to mean
"till love dies," and each assumed the
burden of self-support; thus, they
were married.
The foregoing will no doubt lead
most of us to unpack and dust off our
ideas of the marriage relationship,
and see if they are in good working
order. We find that the companionate

marrage has become enough of an
issue to merit our consideration and
frank discussion regardless of wheth
er or not we agree with its premises.
