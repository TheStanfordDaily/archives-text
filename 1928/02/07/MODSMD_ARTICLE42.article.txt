Now that spring fever has set in
and a party of six is no longer re
quired to go walking in the hills, I'm
sure that we will be able to get more
healthful exercise than ever before.
It is very important, too, that college
students get their exercise, because
as we all know health is very neces
sary to getting one's way.
Walking is really one of the best
forms of work, the only trouble being
that one can not get very far away
from the campus. That is, one can't
go very far when the time is so short.
But the lake is beautiful, even now.
And last night I went canoeing in the
moonlight. That really is very good
for one, you know, getting the night
air.
When the water stops being so
muddy, I'm going to swim, too. Not
at night, of course, but in the morn
ing when I have time to cut classes.
Because I really think it is bad for
one to stay cooped up all the time
when one is in college. And I believe
the professors enjoy a cut now and
then, too. After all, I suppose they
are very human when they want to
be. I mean when they have an in
centive.
Of course most of the girls need
exercise quite badly. I mean, I had
rather walk home and have some
candy, than not to have any candy
at all.
And this campus is very good for
walking. That is, one can walk, and
walk, but you never get any place,
except of course, when you have to
go home. Why it takes me so long to
walk from one class to another, that
I really don't have much time to get
acquainted with my professors.
