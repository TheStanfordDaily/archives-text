The Editor, Sir:
I was sitting in my room calmly
smoking, and enjoying a qniet Satur
day night's relaxation, when suddenly
rocks numbers one, two, and three,
respectively, sailed into my window.
Rock No. 1 hit the far wall with a
dull thud, and I did not so much as
look up. Rock No. 2 was more effec
tive and it came upon its destructive
course, struck the window, and a
shower of glass fell over the window
sill, floor, and bed. Rock No. 3 put
; another good pane wrong, and only
the curtain kept me from getting an
eye full of glass.
Now doesn't that smack of indeli
|cacy! It is a small matter in itself,
but there's a mountain of principle
i involved. Of course an eye, a tooth,
; cuts from sharp edges of glass, or the
j destruction of University property
I are small items, but the dog throws
! rocks from a hiding-place—possibly
: a darkened room above —and goes to
the depths for using low tactics. He
leaves you powerless against him be
| cause he won't come forward and
; meet whatever trend the action may
j take that is excited by his crime.
A joke is a joke and a pane is a
pane until the rock makes connec
; tions, then it's a pain. Some of these
funsters should be sent home to their
' mothers—they're beginning to smell.
At any rate if they DO know better,
it's the old streak that is all yellow
and a yard wide.
I overheard a fellow yesterday giv
ing another the razz about throwing
things through windows. He remarked
in all seriousness, "Boy that just

missed me or I'd be cold this minute."
He meant that, too.
Some day, when someone is laid
out, someone else will be sorry, but
they've already had their fling then.
Until that time these rocks will con
tinue to get bigger and bigger.
