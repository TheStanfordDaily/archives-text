The Editor, Sir:
it is with some hesitation that I ex
press my opinion on the matter of award
ing letters to football men. This hesita
tion, kindly understand, is not caused by
any lack of courage on my part to stand
by my convictions, but rather by the
dread that my fellow students will think
that I am attempting to monopolize this
column. On the other hand, however,
when I look through the Dailies and find
that 110 person has expressed him
self on the matter of awards (the sug
gestion in the Campus Opinion of Jan
uary 27 that three distinct amendments be
voted 011 separately, beipg the contribu
tion of the writer) since January 24, I
don't believe that anyone can justly con
tend that I am attempting to monopolize
the Campus Opinion column.
We were informed in the editorial of
January 24 entitled "Three Felt Letters"
that "In the eyes of a large portion of
the football team all three of these men
(speaking of the three in question) should
have received their awards, and that to
prevent possible recurrence of this cir
cumstance in the future, a petition has
been drawn up providing for a change in
the awards system."
But will this petition, if adopted, pre
vent a "possible recurrence of this cir
cumstance"? I beg to differ (nothing
unusual from that fellow, many will say).
The petitioners, finding that the giving of
"exceptional awards" is limited to one (1)
person, are merely asking to have this
number increased to three (.3). And why
three? Because there happen to be three
men to whom they wish to give these
"exceptional awards." There is 110 doubt
in the opinion of the writer that the
number might have been six, twelve, or
any other number were there that many
seekers of "exceptional awards." But to
get back to the question. What if the
petition were passed and that next year
there are four (4) men who "in the eyes
of a large portion of the football team"
seem worthy of receiving an award?
Would not the same situation—a condition
which this petition is purported to alle
viate—exist? Might not another petition
be presented to have the number of "eligi
bles" raised to four? Improbale, you say?
Possibly so; but what's to prevent it?
Having once established a precedent,
who's going to stop anyone from attempt
ing to change the rules? If it was done
for John Smith, why can't it be done for
John Doe? Smith is 110 beter than Doc.
If this petition is—as alleged in the
editorial—to prevent "possible recurrence
of this circumstance," why, I ask, is it
provided that "the above rules shall be
retroactive for the football season of
1927"? A retroactive law, as I understand
it, is a law passed expressly to effect acts
done prior to the passing of the law. This
retroactive provision clearly demonstrates,
I believe, that there is no ground for the
assertion that the petition is presented "to
prevent possible recurrence of this cir
cumstance in the future." If the peti
tioners are really motivated by a sense of
fair play toward posterity, why the retro
active clause ?
