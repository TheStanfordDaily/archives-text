# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
When Owner Phil Ball and Man
ager Dan Howley traded Rice, Gallo
way, and Vangilder to Detroit for Lu
Blue and Heinie Manush, they gained
in quality for what they lost in quan
tity. On second thought, they received
quite some quantity too, as Henry ;
Emmett Manush weighs about 190
pounds and stands 6 feet 1 inch in
height, and Lu Blue isn't exactly tiny, !
either. '
Heinie Manush, at the age of twen
ty-five, won the batting championship
of the American League in 1926.
What's more, he topped all National
League batsmen as well. His mark of
.377 went into the record books to j
stay, and nothing that he or anybody |
else can do will ever change it. But ;
then look what happened! In 1927 he j
fell to a paltry .299, the second time j
since he came up to the majors that j
he had fallen below the .300 mark.
Then he was traded to the lowly 1
Browns. It will be very interesting to
see what he does in his new environ-,
ment in 1928, as a change of scenery ;
often works wonders with a ball
player.
It may be that Manush was batting
above his true form in 1926. But he 1
declared his success that year was i
due to the fact that he acquired con-;
fidence, and that 1926 was the first
season in which he was allowed to ,
hit against all kinds of pitching. He !
was quoted as saying: "A theory has i

developed in major league baseball
that left-handed batters are to be
benched when left-handed pitchers
are on the slab. But I feel that a
left-handed hitter, who's naturally a
good hitter, will fare better, in the
long run, if they'll let him stay in
there and face the pitchers just as
they come."


Will He Come Back?
