# TEN THOUSAND FOR RATS BUT NOT ONE CENT FOR SEQUOIA
## 
### 
Within a few weeks, animals
used 111 experimental work by
the Medical and Psychology de
partment, will move into their
new hostelry near the Museum,
a $10,000 stucco structure which
is expected to be one of the
world's most elaborate animal
homes, and is rumored to sur
pass even Sequoia Hall in ele
gance and equipment.
Everything but private bath
rooms will be included in this
Animal Waldorf for the conven
ience and comfort of its occu
pants. Privacy will be one of
the features of the building and
will be embodied in individual
rooms for those of the hotel's
patrons who don't get along well
together. To better protect the
health of its guests, the hotel
will be electrically heated.
