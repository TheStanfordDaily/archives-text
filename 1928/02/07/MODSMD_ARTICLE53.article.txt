Gentlemen:
I've done a lot of pipe smoking.
There's hardly a brand or a blend that
I haven't tried out at some time or
other.
But speaking of smoking tobacco
that brings real enjoyment, and never
changes, I want to say that there is
just 0r..? tobacco that —>c — 1
enjoyment in my pipe—Edgewortli.
I have used Edgeworth Ready
Rubbed and Plug Slice for over five
years, in all climates and under all
conditions, and I find it always the
same. It is always mellow and moist,
and its genuine flavor lasts. There is
no bite or parch in Edgeworth, and the
quality, whether you buy it in small
or large quantities, is always perfect.
Thanks to the manufacturers for
their wonderful product, and I hope
that Edgeworth can always be obtain
able by the undersigned.
