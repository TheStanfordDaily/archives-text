TODAY'S TEASER
| Until yesterday we thought the Law
of Agency was the hardest mass of words
, we had ever been called upon to get a
' meaning from, but it must now be ac
| knowledged that in drawing up involved
; rules the football rules committee has
; outstripped all the learned judges who
ever sat upon the bench.
Imagine being a referee of a big game
■ with a howling mob in the stadium clam
oring for a decision upon a play. Further
j imagine having to decide that play ac-
I cording to the following rule (carried in
your mind) : "On any such (lateral) pass
other than a pass from the snapper-back
which is clearly thrown a distance of
approximately two yards through the air
and is not merely handed to or toward an
other player, the ball, if it hits the ground,
I is a free ball, but is dead at point of
recovery, counting a down if recovered
by the passing side."
From having to be a football referee,
good Lord deliver us.
* * *
WHAT THE ABOVE MEANS
The new lateral pass rule in ef
fect allows recovery by the de
fense of a fumbled lateral pass,
the ball being dead, however, at
the point of recovery. This
change, it is to be observed, is a
compromise between the old rule,
that a pass blocked behind the
line of scrimmage could be re
covered and advanced, and last
year's regulation, that when a
lateral pass is fumbled the ball is
dead and belongs to the passing
side.
* * *
Tennis players, a survey conducted for
the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching shows, averaged
13.69 points higher in intelligence tests
than football men. Followers of the court
game were highest of seven groups ex
amined, with 87.16 points. Gridmeti were
lowest with 73.47. Non-athletes were
next to lowest with 79.01.
A fair inference to be drawn from
these facts is not that college football j
players are essentially dumber than tennis i
players or than members of other ath- i
lctic groups, but rather that their grades,
suffer from the intense distractions that j
complicate study during the hectic foot- i
ball season.
Probably Launcelot himself found it
difficult to keep up his study of the Code
of Ethics of the Round Table during the
time he was on his quests.

; outstripped all the learned judges who
ever sat upon the bench.
Imagine being a referee of a big game
■ with a howling mob in the stadium clam
oring for a decision upon a play. Further
j imagine having to decide that play ac-
I cording to the following rule (carried in
your mind) : "On any such (lateral) pass
other than a pass from the snapper-back
which is clearly thrown a distance of
approximately two yards through the air
and is not merely handed to or toward an
other player, the ball, if it hits the ground,
I is a free ball, but is dead at point of
recovery, counting a down if recovered
by the passing side."
From having to be a football referee,
good Lord deliver us.

WHAT THE ABOVE MEANS
The new lateral pass rule in ef
fect allows recovery by the de
fense of a fumbled lateral pass,
the ball being dead, however, at
the point of recovery. This
change, it is to be observed, is a
compromise between the old rule,
that a pass blocked behind the
line of scrimmage could be re
covered and advanced, and last
year's regulation, that when a
lateral pass is fumbled the ball is
dead and belongs to the passing
side.

Tennis players, a survey conducted for
the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching shows, averaged
13.69 points higher in intelligence tests
than football men. Followers of the court
game were highest of seven groups ex
amined, with 87.16 points. Gridmeti were
lowest with 73.47. Non-athletes were
next to lowest with 79.01.
A fair inference to be drawn from
these facts is not that college football j
players are essentially dumber than tennis i
players or than members of other ath- i
lctic groups, but rather that their grades,
suffer from the intense distractions that j
complicate study during the hectic foot- i
ball season.
Probably Launcelot himself found it
difficult to keep up his study of the Code
of Ethics of the Round Table during the
time he was on his quests.
