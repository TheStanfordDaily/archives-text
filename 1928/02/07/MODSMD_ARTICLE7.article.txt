# VARSITY BASKETBALL TEAM DOWNS BABES IN SCRIMMAGE GAME
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity and freshman
basketball teams opened a second
week under quarantine yesterday af
ternoon by a lively scrimmage under
the close surveillance of the coaches,
from which the former emerged vic
torious only after the babes had
pushed them to their limit by a burst
of fast and heady fioorwork.
Both teams showed an improve
ment over last week's playing, which
somewhat allayed the fears of many
of the teams' followers who expected
a let-down as a result of the postpone
ment of their games. The varsity's
teamwork was slightly upset by the
continual substituting of combina
tions and individuals, but the passing
and shooting was unusually accurate.
The yearling cagers were repre
sented by two teams, both of which
furnished the varsity plenty of oppo
sition.
