# CARDS WILL MEET TROJAN QUINTET IN SOUTH NEXT WEEK
## U.C. SERIES DATES SET Contests Will Be Called Off If New Paralysis Cases Are Discovered 
### 
Preparations were completed last
night to send Stanford's varsity bas
ketball team to Los Angeles where
they will meet the U.S.C. Trojans
next Monday and Tuesday in the first
two games of a planned three-game
series.
In a long-distf.nce telephone con
versation yesterday, Graduate Man
ager A1 Masters and the Southern
California manager arranged the final
details of the contests. Only a dis
covery of more infantile paralysis
cases on the campus will cause the
trip to be abandoned.
Examination Required
Before leaving on Sunday, each
member of the Cardinal team will be
given a personal examination by Doc
tor Storey.
Two other games were also an
nounced —the first of the annual Stan.
ford-California series—to be played in
Kezar Pavilion. The dates given were
February 24 and 25, although the de
cision is not entirely definite.
In preparation for the U.S.C.
games, Coach Hunt put the team
through a tough scrimmage practice
yesterday afternoon, stressing offen
sive play and fioorwork. Two new
combinations were tried out, with
Smalling, Richards, Berg, Thompson,
and Rotliert taking the fioor against
Bryant, Cook, Bowers, Dobson, and
Biaggini.
The latter combination looked par
ticularly effective on the defense,
breaking up their opponents' plays
before they were well started.
Clark, Vincenti Play
Clark and Vincenti were both given
a chance to play, Clark substituting
for Bowers and Vincenti for Cook.
Smalling showed up well at center
during the entire scrimmage.
The Bryant, Biaggini, and Cook
combination exhibited plenty of speed
in taking the ball down the floor, de
spite the fact that they were faced
by Hunt's favorite pair of guards,
Rotliert and Thompson.
Rothert and Thompson suceceded
in picking the ball off the backboard
on nearly every occasion and allowed
their opponents very few sucker
shots. This afternoon the varsity will
scrimmage with the freshman quin
tet.
