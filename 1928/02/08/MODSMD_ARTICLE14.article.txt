# VARSITY NINE ROUTS FRESHMAN TEAMS IN LAST THREE INNINGS
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball squad
strengthened with varsity pitchers
held the varsity 1-0 for six innings of
good ball, but in the next three let
down, and the varsity took away a
6-0 score. It was hardly a regular
game as Coach Wolter used practi
cally every man on both teams in
order to remove the kinks of a week's
lay-off due to the recent rain.
The enforced vacation helped the
rhuckers but the rain evidently
blurred the batting eye of the varsity.
"Samson" Taylor, "Count" Sobieslci,
Bob Philippi, and Chuck Hanna each
got a chance to throw for the varsity
team. Philippi, who has been promis
ing for two years, should see action
this season, judging from his show
ing thus far. Doug Lewis, Rudy Riese,
and Bill Simkins worked out on the
mound for the varsity.
The 1931 squad is rounding into a
representative ball club but a few
good pitchers are needed to give it an
effective punch. The frosh will get a
real test against San Mateo Junior
College on February 18.
