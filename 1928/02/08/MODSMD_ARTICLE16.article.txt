# Chaney Tells Of Third Expedition Into Gobi Desert
## Explorers Find Fossils of Prehistoric Forms in Central Mongolia 
### 
Reaching back into the story of life
upon earth some 25,000,000 years, the
Third Asiatic Expedition of the Amer
ican Museum of Natural History
found in central Mongolia fossils of
reptile, plant, and even mammal
forms which had existed in these
early periods.
Dr. Ralph W. Chaney of the Car
negie Institute, a paleobotanist on the
expedition, told of the findings and
experiences of his party while in the
Gobi desert of Mongolia. He illus
trated his talk with slides and motion
pictures taken on the trip.
Show Dinosaur Eggs
Eggs and skulls of the ancient dino
saur were shown, along with fossils
of other prehistoric forms. Skulls of
the earliest mammals, no longer than
a human thumb-nail, were contrasted
with the skull of a carnivore twice
the size of the largest animal of pres
ent times. Four leg bones of a rhino
ceros of the period, each as long and
much heavier than a.man's body, were
discovered on the trip.
Modern Animals Pictured
Present forms of life were pictured,
too, such as the wild ass, a, pictur
esque animal which seems to have
trained itself to exist in this arid
country without more water than it
gets from the vegetation which forms
its food. Sand grouse here have feet
padded much like a flamel's, enabling
them to run over the sand easily.
Much of the traveling was done in
motor cars, in spite of the complete
absence of roads throughout most of
the country.
