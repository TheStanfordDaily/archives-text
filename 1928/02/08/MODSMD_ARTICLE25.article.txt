# SENIOR MERMEN FACE SERIOUS COMPETITION IN INTERCLASS MEET
## 
### 
For the first time in many years,
the senior swimming team is threat
ened with defeat in the interclasg
meet which is to be held February
15, 16, and 17, if thft paralysis quaran
tine regulations are removed as is
now expected.
The sophomores have a team which
is as strong as the senior defenders,
and a little better balanced, although
the latter group includes graduates
and holdovers. It looks as though the
juniors will be candidates for the
cellar league, with only three prob
able place-takers.
Vanden Akker, sprint and relay
star, and Fall, Olympic diving cham
pion, are the seniors' chief hopes. It
is easily possible that the freshmen,
with Desjardins and Mnrsh diving,
and Burns in the breaststroke, may
beat out the seniors for second place.
First heats will be run off in the
50-, 100-, and 220-yard freestyle races,
100-yard backstroke, 100-yard breast
stroke, and relay and diving, on Feb
ruary 15 and 16. All finals except the
breaststroke will be on the last day,
in order to leave the sailorstyle swim
mers fresh for an attempt to break
the world breaststroke 880-yard relay
record.
All contestants must sign up on the
entry sheet which is posted at Encina
Pool.
