# The 						S-4 Business

One may, in these days of the machine, easily fall victim to a certain
form of mental fatigue, wherein, without particular thought, large organi
zations are considered as being necessarily efficient. We are indebted to
the Independent for the information that such may not always be the case,
particularly when large organizations are a part of the government.
The hull of the submarine S-4, still manned and officered by its crew
of dead heroes, lies already half-forgotten by a busy public in 105 feet of
water off the shores of Cape Cod. The ramming of the submersible by
the Coast Guard destroyer Paulding, the discovery that six men remained
alive, the long salvage operations, and the final sad failure to rescue the
men are well enough known. For the last, we heard that the weather was
mainly to blame. But Frank Green, a reporter for the Boston Evening
Transcript and one of the men who watched first-hand the grim opera
tions off the tip of Cape Cod, raises a word of doubt. Writing in the Inde
pendent he charges the Navy Department with many blunders, saying:
"The Navy failed to rescue the imprisoned men because of a number
of circumstances, some of them unavoidable, no doubt. But there were
blunders connected with the work of salvage, blunders of which the public
should know. 1 am not concerned here in discussing the possibility that
safety devices installed upon the submarine previous to the accident might
have assisted in raising her, nor in the chance that there was a failure
aboard the submarine to take advantage of the listening devices which
might have warned her of the presence of a ship in her vicinity. 1 am
concerned solely with what happened after the craft sank to the ocean's
floor off Provincetown."
The S-4 was rammed and sunk on Saturday afternoon, December 17.
By Sunday afternoon, states Mr. Green, a salvage fleet had been assem
bled. and late the same afternoon divers learned there was life aboard and
attached an air hose to the ballast tanks of the submarine. On Monday,
the Falcon, the oiie boat fully equipped for diving and salvage operations,
steamed in to the Charlestown Navy Yard carrying an injured diver. No
(living was done that day or next. Although the sea flattened for a time
on Tuesday, the Falcon again ran into the harbor on an official errand.
Wednesday was spent searching for the submarine, its position having
been lost, Wednesday night, the hull once again located, divers were able
to attach an air line into the torpedo room. The men were dead.
Now to list some of the blunders recited by Mr. Green,
\\ hen the sunken craft was first located only an ordinary line was
ordered attached. This broke. Divers state that had a steel cable been
used operations could have been carried on despite rough waters. Thus,
it would have been possible to have made the air connection Sunday night,
probably saving the lives of the suffocating mou. Also, on Wednesday
when diving conditions were suitable, many valuable hours were spent in
dragging and sounding for the submarine, which had been lost when the
connecting line parted.
Pontoons are an absolute necessity in raising a submarine. Despite
the fact that Provincetown has for years been a submarine testing point,
and despite the lesson apparent in the S-51 disaster, the nearest pontoons
were at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Some fast boats are berthed there, but
instead of placing the unwieldy barrels of wood and steel on the decks of
such vessels and speeding them to Provincetown, the Navy Department
ordered them towed through Long Island Sound and the Cape Cod Canal
at the rate of four miles an hour ! Privately owned craft used in the opera
tions were not ordered out of New York until Monday morning.
These are only a few facts. Others, like Green's statement that the
small boats used by the press made their usual trips to the scene of the
disaster on the days when the Navy announced through the Associated
Press that it had to withdraw its boats on account of rough weather, must
be omitted in this brief summary.
It is easy to see from this account that a wide open field of criticism
exists. Government boners and political footballing usually result in
nothing more harmless than the loss, waste, or misdirection of a few
millions of dollars, and hence can be dismissed with the cynical laugh one
reserves for such weaknesses in our democratic system. Hut this stupidity
and inefficiency when carried over to a disaster is a different matter.
A harsher note comes in our cynical laugh.
In all the sad reflections this brings to mind there is but out with the
least coloring of cheer : that those sleeping in the S-4 far below the surface
will never know what they might have been spared. Which, perhaps, is
well.

attached an air hose to the ballast tanks of the submarine. On Monday,
the Falcon, the oiie boat fully equipped for diving and salvage operations,
steamed in to the Charlestown Navy Yard carrying an injured diver. No
(living was done that day or next. Although the sea flattened for a time
on Tuesday, the Falcon again ran into the harbor on an official errand.
Wednesday was spent searching for the submarine, its position having
been lost, Wednesday night, the hull once again located, divers were able
to attach an air line into the torpedo room. The men were dead.
Now to list some of the blunders recited by Mr. Green,
\\ hen the sunken craft was first located only an ordinary line was
ordered attached. This broke. Divers state that had a steel cable been
used operations could have been carried on despite rough waters. Thus,
it would have been possible to have made the air connection Sunday night,
probably saving the lives of the suffocating mou. Also, on Wednesday
when diving conditions were suitable, many valuable hours were spent in
dragging and sounding for the submarine, which had been lost when the
connecting line parted.
Pontoons are an absolute necessity in raising a submarine. Despite
the fact that Provincetown has for years been a submarine testing point,
and despite the lesson apparent in the S-51 disaster, the nearest pontoons
were at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Some fast boats are berthed there, but
instead of placing the unwieldy barrels of wood and steel on the decks of
such vessels and speeding them to Provincetown, the Navy Department
ordered them towed through Long Island Sound and the Cape Cod Canal
at the rate of four miles an hour ! Privately owned craft used in the opera
tions were not ordered out of New York until Monday morning.
These are only a few facts. Others, like Green's statement that the
small boats used by the press made their usual trips to the scene of the
disaster on the days when the Navy announced through the Associated
Press that it had to withdraw its boats on account of rough weather, must
be omitted in this brief summary.
It is easy to see from this account that a wide open field of criticism
exists. Government boners and political footballing usually result in
nothing more harmless than the loss, waste, or misdirection of a few
millions of dollars, and hence can be dismissed with the cynical laugh one
reserves for such weaknesses in our democratic system. Hut this stupidity
and inefficiency when carried over to a disaster is a different matter.
A harsher note comes in our cynical laugh.
In all the sad reflections this brings to mind there is but out with the
least coloring of cheer : that those sleeping in the S-4 far below the surface
will never know what they might have been spared. Which, perhaps, is
well.
One may, in these days of the machine, easily fall victim to a certain
form of mental fatigue, wherein, without particular thought, large organi
zations are considered as being necessarily efficient. We are indebted to
the Independent for the information that such may not always be the case,
particularly when large organizations are a part of the government.
The hull of the submarine S-4, still manned and officered by its crew
of dead heroes, lies already half-forgotten by a busy public in 105 feet of
water off the shores of Cape Cod. The ramming of the submersible by
the Coast Guard destroyer Paulding, the discovery that six men remained
alive, the long salvage operations, and the final sad failure to rescue the
men are well enough known. For the last, we heard that the weather was
mainly to blame. But Frank Green, a reporter for the Boston Evening
Transcript and one of the men who watched first-hand the grim opera
tions off the tip of Cape Cod, raises a word of doubt. Writing in the Inde
pendent he charges the Navy Department with many blunders, saying:
"The Navy failed to rescue the imprisoned men because of a number
of circumstances, some of them unavoidable, no doubt. But there were
blunders connected with the work of salvage, blunders of which the public
should know. 1 am not concerned here in discussing the possibility that
safety devices installed upon the submarine previous to the accident might
have assisted in raising her, nor in the chance that there was a failure
aboard the submarine to take advantage of the listening devices which
might have warned her of the presence of a ship in her vicinity. 1 am
concerned solely with what happened after the craft sank to the ocean's
floor off Provincetown."

Press that it had to withdraw its boats on account of rough weather, must
be omitted in this brief summary.
It is easy to see from this account that a wide open field of criticism
exists. Government boners and political footballing usually result in
nothing more harmless than the loss, waste, or misdirection of a few
millions of dollars, and hence can be dismissed with the cynical laugh one
reserves for such weaknesses in our democratic system. Hut this stupidity
and inefficiency when carried over to a disaster is a different matter.
A harsher note comes in our cynical laugh.
In all the sad reflections this brings to mind there is but out with the
least coloring of cheer : that those sleeping in the S-4 far below the surface
will never know what they might have been spared. Which, perhaps, is
well.
One may, in these days of the machine, easily fall victim to a certain
form of mental fatigue, wherein, without particular thought, large organi
zations are considered as being necessarily efficient. We are indebted to
the Independent for the information that such may not always be the case,
particularly when large organizations are a part of the government.
The hull of the submarine S-4, still manned and officered by its crew
of dead heroes, lies already half-forgotten by a busy public in 105 feet of
water off the shores of Cape Cod. The ramming of the submersible by
the Coast Guard destroyer Paulding, the discovery that six men remained
alive, the long salvage operations, and the final sad failure to rescue the
men are well enough known. For the last, we heard that the weather was
mainly to blame. But Frank Green, a reporter for the Boston Evening
Transcript and one of the men who watched first-hand the grim opera
tions off the tip of Cape Cod, raises a word of doubt. Writing in the Inde
pendent he charges the Navy Department with many blunders, saying:
"The Navy failed to rescue the imprisoned men because of a number
of circumstances, some of them unavoidable, no doubt. But there were
blunders connected with the work of salvage, blunders of which the public
should know. 1 am not concerned here in discussing the possibility that
safety devices installed upon the submarine previous to the accident might
have assisted in raising her, nor in the chance that there was a failure
aboard the submarine to take advantage of the listening devices which
might have warned her of the presence of a ship in her vicinity. 1 am
concerned solely with what happened after the craft sank to the ocean's
floor off Provincetown."
The S-4 was rammed and sunk on Saturday afternoon, December 17.
By Sunday afternoon, states Mr. Green, a salvage fleet had been assem
bled. and late the same afternoon divers learned there was life aboard and
attached an air hose to the ballast tanks of the submarine. On Monday,
the Falcon, the oiie boat fully equipped for diving and salvage operations,
steamed in to the Charlestown Navy Yard carrying an injured diver. No
(living was done that day or next. Although the sea flattened for a time
on Tuesday, the Falcon again ran into the harbor on an official errand.
Wednesday was spent searching for the submarine, its position having
been lost, Wednesday night, the hull once again located, divers were able
to attach an air line into the torpedo room. The men were dead.
Now to list some of the blunders recited by Mr. Green,
\\ hen the sunken craft was first located only an ordinary line was
ordered attached. This broke. Divers state that had a steel cable been
used operations could have been carried on despite rough waters. Thus,
it would have been possible to have made the air connection Sunday night,
probably saving the lives of the suffocating mou. Also, on Wednesday
when diving conditions were suitable, many valuable hours were spent in
dragging and sounding for the submarine, which had been lost when the
connecting line parted.
Pontoons are an absolute necessity in raising a submarine. Despite
the fact that Provincetown has for years been a submarine testing point,
and despite the lesson apparent in the S-51 disaster, the nearest pontoons
were at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Some fast boats are berthed there, but
instead of placing the unwieldy barrels of wood and steel on the decks of
such vessels and speeding them to Provincetown, the Navy Department
ordered them towed through Long Island Sound and the Cape Cod Canal
at the rate of four miles an hour ! Privately owned craft used in the opera
tions were not ordered out of New York until Monday morning.
These are only a few facts. Others, like Green's statement that the
small boats used by the press made their usual trips to the scene of the
disaster on the days when the Navy announced through the Associated
Press that it had to withdraw its boats on account of rough weather, must
be omitted in this brief summary.
It is easy to see from this account that a wide open field of criticism
