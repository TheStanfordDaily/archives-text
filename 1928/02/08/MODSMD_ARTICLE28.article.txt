Two men were nominated yesterday by the staff of the Stanford
Daily for the office of editor-in-chief for the second term. A general
student body vote on Tuesday, February 14. will be necessary to select
the editor. The two men nominated are Frank Baker, managing editor,
and Cal Behle, associate editor. In the staff balloting Baker polled 45
votes and 1 iehle 26y 2 . One-third of the total votes cast in the staff election
is sufficient to nominate a man for a general student body election.
The periods of service of these two men may be summarized as
follows: Behle was appointed to the staff in January 1925, and Maker in
May 1925. Maker was promoted to night editor in September l'J2(>, and
I iehle in November Moth were promoted to their present respective
positions of managing and associate editor last October.
While the capability of the student body as a whole to select the right
man of the two is questionable, this is the way by which provision is made
for electing the editor of the Daily when the staff voting results as it
did yesterday. This is, incidentally, the first time since May 1925 that a
Daily election has gone to the Quad.
