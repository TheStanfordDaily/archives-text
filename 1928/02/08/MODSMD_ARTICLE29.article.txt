Beniamino Gigli, liis stage presence |
and his singing, were among the rea
sons for the well-rounded success of
San Francisco's third Municipal Sym
phony Concert presented last Monday
night in the Civic Auditorium. Other
reasons were the program chosen —
of a list of compositions that are
popular without being banal —and the
usual excellent performance of Dr.
Hertz and his men.
In spite of stray echoes of sound
drifting about the spaciousness of the
'hall, Gigli's voice rang out with the
sweetness for which it has been 1
noted. There is a freshness and ap
parent lack of affectation about his
manner that makes one forget the
previous hundreds of times he must
have sung the same songs and ac- ■
knowledged similar outbursts of ap- j
plause.
He had sung almost a full program
by the time the concert was over, I
what with three operatic numbers on j
the program and as many encores.
"Rudopho's Narrative" from "La j

| Boheme" was the number which ex
hibited the unparalleled smoothness
and grace of Gigli's voice. It is the
sort of melodious, slightly pathetic
thing that seems to have been written
expressly for him. "On with the
Show" from "Pagliacci" had a thrill
ing finish. But Gigli rallied sufficient
ly to respond to Dr. Hertz's sugges
j tion that he do it all over again with
i a typically Italian shrug. "Woman Is
Fickle" from "Rigoletto" and one of
the darkly sinister arias from "Car
; men" were two other numbers on
i which the tenor scored.
He can best be summarized by say
ing that lie is primarily a singer and
not an actor. With the brief excep
tion of the Pagliacci ending, the melo
dic rather than the emotional content
!of the particular song was always
| uppermost. When he is free from all
. handicaps of poor acoustics as he will
i be in the Stanford Pavilion tomorrow
j night, the full richness of his tones
J should become apparent instead of
j only detectable.

"Rudopho's Narrative" from "La j

| Boheme" was the number which ex
hibited the unparalleled smoothness
and grace of Gigli's voice. It is the
sort of melodious, slightly pathetic
thing that seems to have been written
expressly for him. "On with the
Show" from "Pagliacci" had a thrill
ing finish. But Gigli rallied sufficient
ly to respond to Dr. Hertz's sugges
j tion that he do it all over again with
i a typically Italian shrug. "Woman Is
Fickle" from "Rigoletto" and one of
the darkly sinister arias from "Car
; men" were two other numbers on
i which the tenor scored.
He can best be summarized by say
ing that lie is primarily a singer and
not an actor. With the brief excep
tion of the Pagliacci ending, the melo
dic rather than the emotional content
!of the particular song was always
| uppermost. When he is free from all
. handicaps of poor acoustics as he will
i be in the Stanford Pavilion tomorrow
j night, the full richness of his tones
J should become apparent instead of
j only detectable.
