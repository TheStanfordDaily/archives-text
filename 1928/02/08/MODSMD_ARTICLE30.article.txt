Although I am old enough to be
in college, I can't vote except on
very particular occasions, like
electing the next editor of our
Daily.
You know, I never had such an
exciting time before. I mean in
an office. And I felt really quite
important. That is to say, every
one talked to me seriously. And a
girl enjoys being serious now and
then, you know, even if the boys
don't.
I mean, lines and hooks and
that sort of thing are all right in
their place, but once in awhile
when one is in college, one really
means what one says.
New office-holders are so im
pressed with the importance of
everything, »that one can't but
help being interested in what can
didates plan for the future.
I do hope that the new editor
doesn't forget. I mean his re
sponsibility, because the voters
won't. Why one of them ran and
ran with only one minute to go
in order'to get his vote in.
And, of course, everything
around was very secret and
seehied like real politics. Of
course we were impatient. But
we all couldn't agree, and I really
do think it is more democratic
when you all are allowed to vote.
And the spirit will be fine, too.
For everyone always turns out to
vote on Quad elections. We are
noted for that wonderful spirit of
co-operation in all of our elec
tions.
