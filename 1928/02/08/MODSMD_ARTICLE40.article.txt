# SPORTS OF 1928

Pity the poor country that hasn't ]
got a Martin or two waiting around to
compete in the coming Olympics
A Martin is a two legged animal who
runs the half-mile in near record j
time, and it is quite within the realms j
of possibility that members of the ,
clan will finish first, second and third |
in the 800-meter run at Amsterdam [
next July, Peltzer, Lowe, and Hahn
to the contrary notwithstanding.
In 1924, at Paris, P. Martin of Switz
erland beat all the best American j
half-milers, including Enck, Richard- j
son, Dodge, and Watters, to finish a
good second to Douglas Lowe, of
Great Britian, who won in one min- ;
ute, fifty-two and four-tenths seconds.
The Swiss Martin engaged in a stir- |
ring duel with the French Martin i

(Sera) in 1927, the former winning
in 1. 53, which is fast time for 800
meters in any language. He has a
victory over the famous German Dr.
Otto Peltzer to his credit, and is
being trained by Poulenard, French
400-:neter champion in 1913.
Our own Alva Martin, who starred
for Northwestern University in 1926,
and later for the Chicago Athletic
Association, chooses decidedly to run
in 1928, and should be very much in
the running. He won the National
Collegiate half-mile in the startling
time of 1..51 7-10, but on remeasure
ment the track was found to be short.
Later in the year lie won the Ama
teur Athletic Union title in 1.53 3-5.
breaking the national record of 1.54
established in 1916 by Don Scott.
