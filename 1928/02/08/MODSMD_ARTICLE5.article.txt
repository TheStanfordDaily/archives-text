# MAY RESUME NORMAL UNIVERSITY SCHEDULE NEXT MONDAY-STOREY
## State Health Commissioner Authorizes Move; Facts On Disease Given 
### 
After consultation with the repre
sentative of the State Commissioner
of Health, Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Uni
versity Health Officer, is authorized
to announce that the normal Univer
sity program may be resumed Mon
day, February 13, provided no new
cases of poliomyelitis arise mean
while.
In commenting on the poliomyelitis
situation, Dr. Storey said, "Some
earnest people are finding fault with
us for not having placed Stanford
under strict quarantine; some others
are indifferent to the more scientific
restrictions that we have imposed re
garding them as necessary."
"Careless neglect of reasonable pre
cautions at such a time as this, espe
cially neglect of the safety of others,
is a worse menace than unreasoning
fear. Real quarantine would be irra
tional, intolerable, and probably im
possible. Neglect of appropriate scien
tific precautions until the end of our
period of self-imposed restrictions is
inexcusable.
"The fact that next Monday may
release us from our self-imposed
program of defense is no excuse for
ignoring our obligations prior to that
date," declared Dr. Storey.
The history of poliomyelitis is a
history of a disease that is often fatal,
frequently causes paralysis, but more
often leaves no paralysis, and much
more frequently appears as a mild
inconsequential infection. The State
Department of Health estimates that
for every case of severe poliomyelitis
there are probably fifteen mild cases
that may not be recognized. The se
vere infections in the great majority
of cases terminate in paralysis or
death. These facts and the following
figures from the State Department of
Health establish the wisdom of cau
tion and the folly of carelessness. Up
to December 1, 1927 (no figures avail
able for December):
Age Deaths Cases Per Cent
UncPer 1 year 17 35 48.57
1 to 4 years 39 344 11.34
5 to 9 years 42 356 14.61

cases of poliomyelitis arise mean
while.
In commenting on the poliomyelitis
situation, Dr. Storey said, "Some
earnest people are finding fault with
us for not having placed Stanford
under strict quarantine; some others
are indifferent to the more scientific
restrictions that we have imposed re
garding them as necessary."
"Careless neglect of reasonable pre
cautions at such a time as this, espe
cially neglect of the safety of others,
is a worse menace than unreasoning
fear. Real quarantine would be irra
tional, intolerable, and probably im
possible. Neglect of appropriate scien
tific precautions until the end of our
period of self-imposed restrictions is
inexcusable.
"The fact that next Monday may
release us from our self-imposed
program of defense is no excuse for
ignoring our obligations prior to that
date," declared Dr. Storey.
The history of poliomyelitis is a
history of a disease that is often fatal,
frequently causes paralysis, but more
often leaves no paralysis, and much
more frequently appears as a mild
inconsequential infection. The State
Department of Health estimates that
for every case of severe poliomyelitis
there are probably fifteen mild cases
that may not be recognized. The se
vere infections in the great majority
of cases terminate in paralysis or
death. These facts and the following
figures from the State Department of
Health establish the wisdom of cau
tion and the folly of carelessness. Up
to December 1, 1927 (no figures avail
able for December):
Age Deaths Cases Per Cent
UncPer 1 year 17 35 48.57
1 to 4 years 39 344 11.34
5 to 9 years 42 356 14.61
10 to 14 years 40 227 17.62
15 to 19 years 19 113 16.81
Over 20 years 33 108 30.55
After consultation with the repre
sentative of the State Commissioner
of Health, Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Uni
versity Health Officer, is authorized
to announce that the normal Univer
sity program may be resumed Mon
day, February 13, provided no new
cases of poliomyelitis arise mean
while.
