# Amendment Is Proposed To Award Circle "S" For All Minor Sports
## Will Abolish Second Class Awards; On Ballot at Next Election 
### 
An amendment providing for the
abolition of the second-class minor
sports award and using in its place
the regulation cix-cle "S," now given
only for first-class minor sports, was
approved by the Ex Committee at its
meeting last night, and will appear
on the ballots in the A.S.S.U. election
on February 14.
Four sports, gymnastics, polo, fenc
ing, and golf are listed as second
class minor sports under the present
athletic by-laws. The amendment, if
passed, will place these four in the
class of swimming, boxing, and soc
cer. In place of the circle German "S"
will be awarded the regulation circle
block "S."
Nominations were declared open for
the office of treasurer of the senior
class and for a short-term position in
the Men's. Council. Resignations of
Henry Keyes and Charles Dickenson,
respectively, have created vacancies
in the offices which normally are
filled for a period of one year.
