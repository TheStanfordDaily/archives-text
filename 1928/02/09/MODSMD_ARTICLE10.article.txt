# FLYING WORK BEGINS FOR STUDENT AIRMEN AT AVIATION SCHOOL
## 
### 
"Gas on; are you ready? Contact!"
And the first student was off for his
flying instruction from Lieutenant
Norman A. Goddard at the Palo Alto
Airport.
Eight men have passed the required
State medical examination, and start
ed actual flying yesterday. Technical
classes are held in the evening.
There are now two new Waco
planes for student .instruction at the
Palo Alto School of Aviation, and five
more are to be delivered within 90
days. The Waco is a small plane with
double controls, powered by a 90-
horsepower Curtiss OX-5 motor.
"The field is still pretty soft," said
Goddard, "but we are rolling it into
condition with a tractor and it will
have an excellent surface when it
dries out." The hangar, with a class
room and two workshops in the back,
is finished, but construction on the
administration building will not be
completed until the end of the week.
A Ford airplane, one of the small
machines designed from an economi
cal standpoint to meet the general
public's demand for a low-priced prod
uct, will be on display at the field
next week.
