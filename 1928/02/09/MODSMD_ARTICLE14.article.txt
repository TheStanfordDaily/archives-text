# HUNT'S MEN STAGE FAST PRACTICE TILT WITH BABE CAGERS
## Varsity Team to Play U.S.C.; Freshmen Meet Bear Cubs Wednesday 
### Whitney Wright 
With only two practices remaining
until the Stanford basketball varsity
battles U.S.C., and with the Babe-
California game impending Wednes
day, Hunt's charges staged a fast
scrimmage with Mitchell's freshmen
yesterday afternoon. Some last-min
ute yearling substitutions gave the
varsity a narrow victory.
Teams Show Fjeht
Each team showed plenty of fight,
which resulted in an unusually large
number of fouls on both sides, and
both played well in every department
of the game considering their inac
tion during the past two weeks.
The Smalling, Cook, and Bowers
varsity combination looked the best
of those that Coach Hunt put on the
floor; although Vincenti and Rich
ards were not far behind Cook and
Bowers in filling the forward berths
effectively. A third combination of
Berg, Bryant, and Clark also saw ac
tion, but wa3 unable to hold its
own against the babes as well as the
other combinations.
Rothert, Thompson Steady
Rothert and Thompson played in
the defense positions, picking the
ball off the backboard and keeping
the freshman forward wall from
carrying the ball too far into the
varsity territory. As a result of their
good showing lately, these two
guards will probably be present in the
starting line-up when the Cardinal
cagers face the U.S.C. quintet.
The freshman line-up during the
greater part of the game was Mears,
center, Fawcett and Hawkins, for
wards, Reynolds and Tampcke guards.
Fawcett Individual Star
Fawcett was probably the indi
vidual star, giving an exhibition of
floorwork that has seldom been
equalled in any scrimmage this sea
son. Mears succeeded in getting the
tip-off most of thei game, which gave
his teammates a fast start. His shoot
ing was also unusually accurate.
The good showing of both teams
increased the coaches' hopes for vic
tories in games scheduled for next
week. The freshmen will play their
first contest with California Wednes
day at Berkeley.
Stanford's final standing in the
Pacific Coast Conference, southern
section, depends largely on the out
come of the U.S.C. games, since a
win will put the Cardinal team back
in the running for first place honors,
now usurped by the U.S.C. cagers.
