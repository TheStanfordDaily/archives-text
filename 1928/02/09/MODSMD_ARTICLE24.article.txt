# INELIGIBILITY OF TWO HURTS PROSPECTS OF BABE BASEBALL TEAM
## 
### 
Freshman baseball prospects were
both dimmed and brightened last
night when it was announced that
eligibility rules had forced Goodell
and Cook, first string third and first
basemen, respectively, to be ruled
out for at least the remainder of the
quarter and perhaps for the whole
season.
The outlook brightened when the
onlookers witnessed the stellar work
of Don Story, yearling pitcher. The
team has two other pitchers, Ricklefs
and Gillette.
While the loss of Goodell and Cook
will be severely felt by the squad, the
yearlings have a wealth of good in
field material. Chuck Teague will
take Cook's former position. He is one
of the best batters on the squad and
also handles himself nicely around
the first sack. Norman Hedge will be
the new third-baseman.
Vernon Bowles has landed Teague's
old position in right field. He is
speedy and accurate at fielding
grounders and a fair hitter.
Coach Harry Wolter led the men
in a rigid batting and infield prac
tice last night in preparation for a
game with the strong San Mateo
Junior College nine which iS sched
uled for a week from Saturday. The
freshihen still need a great deal of
practice in hitting.
