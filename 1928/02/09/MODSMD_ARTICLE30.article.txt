From the proposed amendment to make all minor sport awards the
first class circle block "S," it seems that an interested group is figuring
on the ease with which submitted petitions may be voted into effect in a
general student body election to change the Stanford scheme of awards.
The announcement of this new petition makes it the second proposed
amendment pertaining to athletic awards, the first one being concerned
with recommendations for football letters for "exceptional work," and
changes in playing time requirements of post-season games. Both will be
voted upon next Tuesday.
This second proposed amendment to the A.S.S.U. constitution would
place gymnastics, polo, fencing, and golf on a parity in awards with swim
ming, boxing, and soccer. It has been argued that its adoption would
increase the amount of competition in minor sports by virtue of the asser
tion that more men, anxious to secure a circle block "S," would come out
for sports which may be said now to be very minor. Naturally, those who
are engaged in these sports would like to see the amendment pass even as
those who participate in swimming, boxing, and soccer would not like to
see it pass.
The issue that has been raised should, however, be placed on such a
question that the University students as a whole should take interest in it
quite different from that of those who expect or hope to receive awards in
the now second class minor sports. With this in mind backers of the pro
posed amendment say that it will increase competition in their sports. A
nice little argument that doesn't mean anything.
Consider the sports which would be raised (in classification) by adop
tion of this amendment: gymnastics, polo, fencing, and golf. These sports
represent, collectively, an approach to the Htimate minimum in drawing
power either of competitors or spectators . Their publicity is practically
nil as a consequence. Polo is the only one of the group which may be
considered as bringing publicity. The basis of the argument, however,
should not rest on publicity, but on interest. Publicity comes when there
is interest. Golf, on the other hand, has here both interest and publicity
(not to be compared, of course, with that accorded swimming) but Stan
ford's representation in golf has been made, it must be said, with little
help from the authorities. The argument, of course, is that we do not
have the facilities. The first sport which deserves consideration of being
placed in the first classification of minor sports should unquestionably be
golf, but the time is not yet ripe for that.
The question of awards is at any time an argument-provoking one. In
the last analysis any system of athletic awards may be shown to be foolish,
but, as we see it, the present classification of minor sports into first and
second classes is satisfactory and deserving of student support by snowing
under the proposed amendment with "nays."
