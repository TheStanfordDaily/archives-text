Word comes from the A.S.S.U. Concert Series manager that there
has been a heavy sale of tickets for the Gigli recital tonight. In spite of
all the handicaps that have existed to discourage all lbut purely campus
attendance, it is likely that there will be practically a full Pavilion. And
that without the use of any Palo Alto or Peninsula advertising—for it was
believed that, in view of the poliomyelitis scare, the only thing to do was
to refrain from specifically inviting the friends of the University who
have in the past formed a substantial proportion of the Pavilion audiences.
The name of Gigli is one of the greatest magnets on the concert and
operatic stage of today. It is revealing no secrets to say that his is the most
expensive single event of the Stanford Scries, and from the first was
expected to be the most brilliant. It seemed at first a grave misfortune
that it should be scheduled at the time when there would be so much of
uncertainty. There was some consideration of calling the concert off
simply as a financial safety measure. But it was finally decided to hold on
if only for the honor of the Series, and the last few days have shown that
a brilliant reputation will draw in spite of all difficulties.
Gigli has the rare quality of attracting thousands of admirers wher
ever lie sings. When his press agents advertise him as the most popular
operatic tenor in the world, they arc—strangely enough for the breed!—
telling no more than the truth. In 1920 when Gatti-Casazza, impresario
of the Metropolitan Opera Company, engaged Gigli, that singer was al
ready the reigning favorite in the greater opera houses of Italy and South
America, but he was only a name in this country. Within a few months he
had firmly established himself, and the unexpected illness of Caruso caused
a large portion of the burden of the season to fall on his shoulders.
Since that time lie has reigned almost unchallenged in opera. More
lately he has started concert tours and immensely increased the circle of
his admirers. lie can fill almost any hall in the country. Some ten thou
.sand packed into that great section of outdoors, the San Francisco Civic
Auditorium, last Monday and held Gigli for encore after encore when he
>vas soloist with the orchestra conducted by Dr. Alfred Hertz.

that it should be scheduled at the time when there would be so much of
uncertainty. There was some consideration of calling the concert off
simply as a financial safety measure. But it was finally decided to hold on
if only for the honor of the Series, and the last few days have shown that
a brilliant reputation will draw in spite of all difficulties.
Gigli has the rare quality of attracting thousands of admirers wher
ever lie sings. When his press agents advertise him as the most popular
operatic tenor in the world, they arc—strangely enough for the breed!—
telling no more than the truth. In 1920 when Gatti-Casazza, impresario
of the Metropolitan Opera Company, engaged Gigli, that singer was al
ready the reigning favorite in the greater opera houses of Italy and South
America, but he was only a name in this country. Within a few months he
had firmly established himself, and the unexpected illness of Caruso caused
a large portion of the burden of the season to fall on his shoulders.
Since that time lie has reigned almost unchallenged in opera. More
lately he has started concert tours and immensely increased the circle of
his admirers. lie can fill almost any hall in the country. Some ten thou
.sand packed into that great section of outdoors, the San Francisco Civic
Auditorium, last Monday and held Gigli for encore after encore when he
>vas soloist with the orchestra conducted by Dr. Alfred Hertz.
