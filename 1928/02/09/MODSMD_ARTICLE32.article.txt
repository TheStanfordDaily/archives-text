The Editor, Sir:
The Executive Committee should
provide that the proposed amend
ments regarding the "exceptional
awards" be voted on separately. If
this is not done —or cannot be done
—the whole proposition should be
voted down! Another election can
then be held to vote separately on
the measures as follows (this merely
being a suggestion):
1. Any man who plays 15 minutes
in a post-season or intersectional
game shall be given a block "S."
2. The above rule shall be retro
active for the football season of 1927.
3. A maximum of three men may
be granted a block "S" in football
whose exceptional work, etc., etc.
4. The above rule shall be retroac
tive for the football season of 1927.
Could not the petitioners withdraw
their "3 in 1" proposition or empower
the Executive Committee to reward
it along the lines suggested above?
May we be assuming too much if
we interpret the "good faith" of the
petitioners according to whether or
not they are willing to have their
measures presented separately?
-F.RS, '29.

The Editor, Sir:
It is indeed gratifying to see that
the students have at last taken an
interest in the awarding of minor
sports emblems. Under present con
ditions, to admit participation in a
minor sport is to admit a certain de
gree of inferiority (at least inferior
ity in the ability of bringing in cash
returns. I dare say that is the main
differentiation between major and
minor sports).
There are not two classes of major
sports, why two classes of minor?
"The purpose and aim of minor
sports is to furnish an opportunity
for a large number of students to
participate in athletic competition
both within and without the Univer
sity; to assist a student in finding
himself in an athletic sense, by en
couraging him to become a vital part
of Stanford's athletic policy, 'Ath
letics for all'." Why not encourage
the student by giving him an award
worthy of his efforts?
According to the "exceptional
awards" amendment coming up for
election, it appears that the major
sport cohorts are not merely playing
for the love of the game, they 3eem
to want some more encouragement.
Why not give minor sports a little
encouragement—that is, if the Stan
ford policy is really, "Athletics for
all." —Amour propre.

The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps someone will tell me why
we carefully print our names in our
textbooks as soon as we buy them.
At present it seems to be only a
means of entertainment to those of
us who actually do hope to have lost
books returned to the owner.
During my few quarters on the
campus I have lost two textbooks in
rooms in the Quad. Returning to the
spot the following day did no good,
they had disappeared and the regular
lost and found department has never
received them, nor I. Apparently peo
ple do not think that a person's name
on the inside of a cover has anything
to do with a desire to retain the pos
session. Unless a book is left near
the Engineering Corner, it is gone
forever.
How about a little co-operation in
helping the owner, instead of helping
oneself to stray books. —J.S.M.

Now that the Women's Council has
decided upon the regulations for the
protection of our revered intellectual
feminine pulchritude, and the bicycles
and skates are still holding forth;
may I ask why they need any pro
tection?
Certainly these bespectacled, un
shorn, book-laden, youthful intelligen
cia who creak and clatter to class
like rusty-jointed nymphs on rustier
steeds, need no protection, unless it
is from each other. I mean there
should be some traffic regulations.
Well! that reminds me of Our Sally.
If they were all like our Sally, or
better (because I mean they could
be better), then they should have a
right to protection. But, as 1 should
have mentioned, or rather asked, will
(lie sidewalks stand up under this
punishment? No! not. of the bicycles
—of the skates? Well anyway, now
that the women are protected, who
will protect us men? I mean who
wants a woman running or skating
all over him?
With apologies to "Our Sally."

The Editor, Sir:
It is indeed gratifying to see that
the students have at last taken an
interest in the awarding of minor
sports emblems. Under present con
ditions, to admit participation in a
minor sport is to admit a certain de
gree of inferiority (at least inferior
ity in the ability of bringing in cash
returns. I dare say that is the main
differentiation between major and
minor sports).
There are not two classes of major
sports, why two classes of minor?
"The purpose and aim of minor
sports is to furnish an opportunity
for a large number of students to
participate in athletic competition
both within and without the Univer
sity; to assist a student in finding
himself in an athletic sense, by en
couraging him to become a vital part
of Stanford's athletic policy, 'Ath
letics for all'." Why not encourage
the student by giving him an award
worthy of his efforts?
According to the "exceptional
awards" amendment coming up for
election, it appears that the major
sport cohorts are not merely playing
for the love of the game, they 3eem
to want some more encouragement.

Perhaps someone will tell me why
we carefully print our names in our
textbooks as soon as we buy them.
At present it seems to be only a
means of entertainment to those of
us who actually do hope to have lost
books returned to the owner.
During my few quarters on the
campus I have lost two textbooks in
rooms in the Quad. Returning to the
spot the following day did no good,
they had disappeared and the regular
lost and found department has never
received them, nor I. Apparently peo
ple do not think that a person's name
on the inside of a cover has anything
to do with a desire to retain the pos
session. Unless a book is left near
the Engineering Corner, it is gone
forever.
How about a little co-operation in
helping the owner, instead of helping
oneself to stray books. —J.S.M.

Now that the Women's Council has
decided upon the regulations for the
protection of our revered intellectual
feminine pulchritude, and the bicycles
and skates are still holding forth;
may I ask why they need any pro
tection?
Certainly these bespectacled, un
shorn, book-laden, youthful intelligen
cia who creak and clatter to class
like rusty-jointed nymphs on rustier
steeds, need no protection, unless it
is from each other. I mean there
should be some traffic regulations.
Well! that reminds me of Our Sally.

better (because I mean they could
be better), then they should have a

Could not the petitioners withdraw
their "3 in 1" proposition or empower
the Executive Committee to reward
it along the lines suggested above?
May we be assuming too much if
we interpret the "good faith" of the
petitioners according to whether or
not they are willing to have their
measures presented separately?

The Editor, Sir:
It is indeed gratifying to see that
the students have at last taken an
interest in the awarding of minor
sports emblems. Under present con
ditions, to admit participation in a
minor sport is to admit a certain de
gree of inferiority (at least inferior
ity in the ability of bringing in cash
returns. I dare say that is the main
differentiation between major and
minor sports).
There are not two classes of major
sports, why two classes of minor?
"The purpose and aim of minor
sports is to furnish an opportunity
for a large number of students to
participate in athletic competition
both within and without the Univer
sity; to assist a student in finding
himself in an athletic sense, by en
couraging him to become a vital part
of Stanford's athletic policy, 'Ath
letics for all'." Why not encourage
the student by giving him an award
worthy of his efforts?
According to the "exceptional
awards" amendment coming up for
election, it appears that the major
sport cohorts are not merely playing
for the love of the game, they 3eem
to want some more encouragement.
Why not give minor sports a little
encouragement—that is, if the Stan
ford policy is really, "Athletics for
all." —Amour propre.

The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps someone will tell me why
we carefully print our names in our
textbooks as soon as we buy them.
At present it seems to be only a
means of entertainment to those of
us who actually do hope to have lost
books returned to the owner.
During my few quarters on the
campus I have lost two textbooks in
rooms in the Quad. Returning to the
spot the following day did no good,
they had disappeared and the regular
lost and found department has never
received them, nor I. Apparently peo
ple do not think that a person's name
on the inside of a cover has anything
to do with a desire to retain the pos
session. Unless a book is left near
the Engineering Corner, it is gone
forever.
How about a little co-operation in
helping the owner, instead of helping
oneself to stray books. —J.S.M.

Now that the Women's Council has
decided upon the regulations for the
protection of our revered intellectual
feminine pulchritude, and the bicycles
and skates are still holding forth;
may I ask why they need any pro
tection?
Certainly these bespectacled, un
shorn, book-laden, youthful intelligen
cia who creak and clatter to class
like rusty-jointed nymphs on rustier
steeds, need no protection, unless it
is from each other. I mean there
should be some traffic regulations.
Well! that reminds me of Our Sally.
If they were all like our Sally, or
better (because I mean they could
be better), then they should have a
right to protection. But, as 1 should
have mentioned, or rather asked, will
(lie sidewalks stand up under this
punishment? No! not. of the bicycles
—of the skates? Well anyway, now
that the women are protected, who
will protect us men? I mean who
wants a woman running or skating
all over him?
With apologies to "Our Sally."

The Editor, Sir:
The Executive Committee should
provide that the proposed amend
ments regarding the "exceptional
awards" be voted on separately. If
this is not done —or cannot be done
—the whole proposition should be
voted down! Another election can
then be held to vote separately on
the measures as follows (this merely
being a suggestion):
1. Any man who plays 15 minutes
in a post-season or intersectional
game shall be given a block "S."
2. The above rule shall be retro
active for the football season of 1927.
3. A maximum of three men may
be granted a block "S" in football
whose exceptional work, etc., etc.
4. The above rule shall be retroac
tive for the football season of 1927.
