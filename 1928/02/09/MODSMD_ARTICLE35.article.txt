THE HONOR SYSTEM
"Now that the mid-terms are almost j
here, we ought to have some poetry
on the subject." Emma, Archie, and
Oswald agreed.
"Why not stress the Honor System
In order to keep the class averages
low?" asked Archie.
"Good idea! I'll take the writer of
the best poem to a show."
Each grabbed a pencil and started i
furiously to write, cross out, and re- \
write. "You ought to leave the room!" j
growled Archie peevishly. "How can I
I write anything with you sitting'
there?"
"We've written the poems!" came
Emma's throaty contralto. I re-entered
to find the three manuscripts folded
neatly on the desk:
Archie
Our honest profs
Are up to wily art.
They make us sit
One seat apart.
Emma
In our honor code
No student cheats.
The profs make us sit
In alternate seats.
Oswald
There was a young man from L.A.
Who peeked in an ex (so they
say).
Men's Council got wise, they
laughed at his lies,
And sent him back home to L.A.
"There's a striking similarity of
ideas in these three poems." The
darkening flush creeping across
Archie's scowling face made me has
ten to add — "er —merely coincidental
of course!"
"Say, if you're insinuating that
I," he muttered in righteous j
anger.
"The Honor System is an institu- j
tion in this University!" cut in
Emma, drawing up frigidly.
"Coincidence, my eye!" growled
Archie, "if this little seating precau
tion that Stanford profs take hasn't
gripped you—you're even 'dumber'
than I thought you were."
"Which show haven't any of you
seen?"

MY ROOMMATE SAID
My best beau (since Saturday) told
me about his roommate, who is
Scotch. The boy friend, not being able
to find his shirt any place, asked
"Scotchy" if he had returned the shirt
borrowed the day before. Upon being
answered in the affirmative, he con
tinued his search, but to no avail.

Finally he said, "Say! Are you sure
that you returned my shirt?"
"Scotchy" said, "Shirt?" I put it in
your laundry."
—Which Hazel, '28.

I trust that I'm not overbowled,
muttered the mahogany ball as it
gave the pins a tumble.

Just remember that "Cabbages and
Things" is looking for good jokes,
light poetry, clever sketches of less
than 100 words, etc. Mail contribs to
"Cabbages and Things," care Stanford
Daily.

We'll wind up today with a sizzling
repartee from she who got slapped
by "A Lover's Lament," and only
mildly mollified by "An Apology,"
which appeared in this column last
week. Speaking of pyrotechnics!
MY ANSWER
Why did you apologize,
It thrilled me to the core,
And though I do so sympathize,
Can't I ask for more?
Perhaps you didn't mean it,
But why did you put it so?
It's hard for me to do it,
But I really must say "No."
I've thought it out, the whole thing,
Don't put on me the blame,
For when you've gone away in Spring
You'll not think of me the same.
I'm sorry if I seemed cold,
That hadn't been my plan,
But you should have been told —
iuu see —i love another man!
—"The Tiger Woman!"
