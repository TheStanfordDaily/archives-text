### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"Better Eliminate than Never,"
quoth George L. "Tex" Rickard, as he
stalked (i.e. "cauli," meaning "stalk")
across the horizon, sowing wild cauli
flower seeds in the well-furrowed
fiields of heavy- weight contenders.
"I'll make two grow where only one
grew before," added the great farmer,
as he dished out another flock of em
bryo brassica oleracea bolrytis!
Tex has cultivated, raised, and
exhibited such famous specimens
as William Harrison Dempsey and
James Joseph Tunney, and now has
fond hopes of being able to develop
one of the present crop to the proper
size, puality, and beauty so that he
can put it on exhibition and charge
big money at the gate.
You will notice that certain of the
cauliflowers shown in the illustration
have undergone what is known as
"elimination" in best fistic circles. But
that is just where Tex's greatness as
a cauliflower grower comes in. He
never seems to be discouraged, goes

right on planting, irrigating, and elim
inating, and soon he has a prize
beauty all ready for the big show.
What matters it 1 if Delaney was
eliminated by Maloney, or that Shar
key and Heeney eliminated each
other, or that Dempsey is fast wither
ing away and is no longer palatable?
Tex will make the public believe they
are world beaters. Some cauliflower,
like Knute Hanson, George Godfrey,
and Paulino are absent from Tex's
patch just at present. But don't worry
—when he wants them, they'll be
back in the fold, ready to blossom at
his magic touch. No matter where he
is, in Goldfield, or in the cauliflower
field, you've got to hand it to Tex. He
certainly knows his groceries!
