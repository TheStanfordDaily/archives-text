# FOOTBALL GAME WITH NEBRASKA NEXT FALL SCHEDULED BY ARMY

### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 8— (U.P.)—West
Point authorities have scheduled a
football game to be held on Novem
ber 24 with the Nebraska Cornhus
kers, showing definitely that the
Army-Navy controversy is to be kept
alive. The game is to be played in
the small Army stadium.
Army men maintain that West
Point has shown a proper indifference
(o commercialism and to the loss of
the Navy game, by arranging to play
Nebraska at the Point. They feel that
the Army has shown the Navy a
nicely calculated preference for a
football game, rather than a spec
tacle.
Navy men assert that the Army is
like the fox in the grape arbor. Los
ing out in the race for the obvious
opponent—Princeton—the Army, they
say, is sulking.
