# DOCTORS STUDY POLIOMYELITIS IN EXPERIMENTS
## E.W. Schultz, Professor of Bacteriology, Dr. Lee In Investigation Monkeys, at $20 Apiece, Are Used for Obtaining Anti-Virus Bodies 
### 
With the hope of producing a po
tent vaccine against polomyelitis and
of discovering methods to prevent the
disease, Dr. Edwin W. Schultz, pro
fessor of Bacteriology and Experi
mental Pathology, and Dr. Russell
V. A. Lee of Palo Alto are undertak
ing a study of the poliomyelitis virus.
Since monkeys are the only animals
convenient for experimentation which
are capable of developing a typical
case of the disease, they will be used
as subjects.
To help bear the heavy expenses
in carrying on research of this type
the Poliomyelitis Research Fund has
been established, to be used in pur
chasing monkeys and otherwise as
sisting in the work.
"There is at present a small amount
-of money in the fund," said Dr. Lee,
and it is hoped that future donations,
which may be made through the
Comptroller's office, will enable the
work to proceed. Monkeys cost ap
proximately $20 apiece, and a hundred
or more will be required."
Potent Serum Needed
Dr. Schultz stressed the desirabil
ity of producing a potent serum.
"The anti-virus bodies in a human
convalescent," he said, "are not equal
to those that can be obtained from a
monkey who has had the disease a
number of times and has finally de
veloped a strong degree of immunity.
"We must devise some way of giv
ing the virus which will be effective
without being dangerous. Sometimes
when a virus is killed to render it
safe it loses its immunity-producing
powers.
Detection of Virus Difficult
"The detection of the presence of
the poliomyelitis virus in an appar
ently healthy carrier is very difficult,"
said Dr. Schultz. "We can't grow it
in any artificial media, for it won't
propogate that way. Nor can it be
visibly detected, for it is a filterable,
ultra-microscopic virus. In size it re
sembles that of smallpox and hydro
phobia. It collects and grows in the
naso-pharyngeal passage, incubating
on the soft mucous there.
"The only way we can detect the
virus in a healthy carrier is to make
a washing of the nose and throat and
inject this into a monkey, which will
soon develop poliomyelitis if the
washing contained the virus."
Brain, Spinal Cord Affected
Describing the nature of polio
myelitis, Dr. Schultz said that the in
fection was primarily one of the an
terior portion of the spinal cord,
which controls the nerves of the
body, and the base of the brain,
which controls those of the face, the
full technical name of infantile para
lysis being "anteriod poliomyelitis."
After penetrating the tissues of the
nasal passage the virus becomes lo
calized in the spinal cord, and the
nuclei which control the motor func
tions of the body become infected and
may be destroyed. A nerve cell that
is destroyed never regenerates. The
apparent recovery is due to the fact
that the inflamation of the affected
cells spreads to those nearby, wh'ch
latter, after the infection lias ceased,
resume their normal function.
"The crucial thing to know," said

Dr. Schultz, "is that the virus is
spread by contact with early or con-i
valescent cases and by people who j
have come in contact with carriers.
It is carried by moisture of the nose
and throat."
