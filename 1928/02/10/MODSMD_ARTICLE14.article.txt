# VARSITY CAGE SQUAD WILL LEAVE SUNDAY FOR TROJAN GAMES
## Vincenti, Richards May Play Forward Positions in Tilts With U.S.C. 
### 
The pick of Stanford's varsity bas
ketball squad will board the Lark
when it pulls into the Palo Alto sta
tion Sunday evening, en route to Los
Angeles where they will battle with
the U.S.C. five Monday and Tuesday
nights for a chance at Pacific Coast
Conference, southern section, first
place honors, now held by that team.
The probable starting line-up for
the Cardinals has been announced as
follows: Smalling, center, Richards
and Vincenti, forwards, Thompson
and Ilothert, guards.
This combination has been showing
up well in practice lately, and, judg
ing by the speed and smoothness
which it displayed against the fresh
men in the last scrimmage, should be
able to hold their own against the
Southern California players, particu
larly as Jack Primer, captain and star
center of the U.S.C. quintet, may be
kept from the game because of ill
ness.
The Cook-Powers forward combina
tion probably will be given a chance
to see action during the evening, al
though their size will be a consider
able handicap against their larger
opponents. Pryant, Dobson, and Piag
gini were also named by Hunt as
likely to play.
In a practice scrimmage yesterday,
in which the varsity and freshman
teams alternated in attempting to
penetrate each other's defense for
close shots, Rothert, and Thompson,
first-string varsity guards, played an
airtight brand of basketball. If this
pair is up to top form Monday and
Tuesday, the U.S.C. forwards will
have a very difficult time in getting
close enough to the basket for sucker
shots at the best.
Ernie Nevers, former Stanford ath
letic star and professional football
player, who was a visitor on the cam
pus yesterday, donned a suit and
joined the varsity in a short work-out.
