lecturer in history, is the Chief of
American Relief Administration and

Committee for the Relief of Bel
gium, two organizations which were
active in Europe during the war. Pro
fessor Fisher is also the author of
"The Famine in Soviet Russia," which
was published last sprin, and banned

Government.
"America and the New Poland"
deals with the restoration of Polish
independence, particularly during the
years 1914 to 1923.
"It should be of particular interest
to Stanford," said Fisher, "because of
the part which Herbert Hoover nlayed
as head of the American Relief Ad
ministration in bringing aid to the
Polish nation in the first years of
its independence."
