# HUNT PREDICTS CARD FRESHMAN VICTORY OVER U.C. QUINTET
## 
### 
Despite the fact that Stanford's fresh
man basketball team lias been compara
tively inactive during the past two weeks
and will be playing on the home court of
their opponents, "Husky" Hunt, Stanford
cage mentor, looks for a Cardinal victory
when the babes clash with the California
freshman quintet at Berkeley next Wed
nesday night in the first of a three-game
series.
Hunt expressed this hope after seeing
the Blue and Gold cagers in action last
Tuesday night against the Galileo High
School five. Although the Bear freshmen
won by a 21-17 score, their opponents
were not far behind in playing ability
and threatened to take the lead in the
scoring more than once. The Stanford
babes defeated the Galileo squad 17 to 10
early in the season.
