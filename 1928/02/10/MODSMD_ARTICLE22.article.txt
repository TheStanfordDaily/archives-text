# Beniamino Gigli Sways Crowd At Concert With Intimate Delivery
## Operatic Arias Show Full Beauty of Great Tenor's Voice 
### Hubert Gagos 
Beniamino Gigli, Italian tenor, endeared
himself to the capacity crowd that at
tended his concert in the Stanford Pa
vilion last night. Singing with full, round
tones throughout the entire register, he
swayed his hearers by his intimate style
of deliver)'.
Gigli is as good a showman as he is a
singerâ€”and that statement is not meant
to deprecate his vocal abilities. For he
demonstrated himself to be a master of
the operatic aria. The popular aria from
Verdi's "La Forza del Destino," for the
opening selection, and from Bizet's "The
Pearl Fishers," for the last program num
ber, were very well done. "Woman is
Fickle" from "Rigoletto," and"The Pro
logue" from "Pagliacci" were given ova
tions.
Gigli smiled, frowned, and winked at
his audience; and his audience responded
to his mood. His contact was established
from his entrance smile and held through
out.
To attempt a criticism of Gigli's vocal
art would be futile. Suffice it to say that
he was at all times in control of his flex
ible voice and used it to best advantage.
Miss Frieda Williams, soprano, as
sisted on the program.
