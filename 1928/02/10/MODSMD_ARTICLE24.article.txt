WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. 9. —
(U.P.) —Secretary of Commerce Hoover
and Senator Willis of Ohio have been
asked by Senator Borah to declare them
selves fully on the prohibition issue.
Borah, who recently set out to question
all Republican presidential candidates on
prohibition, first wrote Senator Curtis of
Kansas and received a bone-dry reply.
Willis is supported by the Anti-Saloon
League. Hoover also is on record as say
ing that the prosperity of the country has
been due in part to prohibition, and the
Anti-Saloon League regards him as a dry.
However, because he has been an execu
tive in a department not concerned with
prohibition, he has had little occasion to
discuss it in detail and his reply to Borah
is awaited with interest by politicians.
