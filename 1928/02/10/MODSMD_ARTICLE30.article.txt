With every probability that normalcy will reign once more on the
campus Monday, provided that no more cases of poliomyelitis develop,
students are warned once more to observe the recommendation that they
remain on the campus over the week-end. Each student, says Dr. Storey,
must regard himself as a possible contact source of the disease. Only
by this way can the recommended regulations for the "self-imposed
quarantine" be properly observed.
Two developments of interest in this line have occurred. Washington
State College has been placed in quarantine following the finding of
several cases of infantile paralysis among both the students of the college
and the townspeople of Pullman. One death has been reported. It can
be seen from this that the situation at Stanford does not even approach
the gravity of the difficulties there. Continued favorable reports of
Stanford's eight cases are reassuring.
At this peculiarly opportune time, two announcements in particular
come as welcome news. The establishment of a research fund to enable
Dr. Edwin W. Schultz, Professor of Bacteriology and Experimental
Pathology, and Dr. Russell V. A. Lee, of Palo Alto, is reported fully
in this issue of the Daily. Contributions from those who have shown
considerable interest in the University's present cases would be more
than welcome. The University of California recently was the recipient
of a $5,000 gift for the study of infantile paralysis. It can be seen from
these facts that civic interest in "polio" is being aroused.
