AT IT AGAIN
The varsity basketball team will l
take up again next Monday night its
campaign for the conference cham
pionship.
Please don't blink your eyes. Stan
ford has just about as good a chance 1
to bring the gonfalon to our Pavilion
as U.S.C., California, or U.C.L.A. have
to theirs. The conference standings,
it will be noted, are now as follows:
Won Lost Pet.
U.S.C. 2 1 .666
U.C.L.A 3 2 .600
California 2 3 .400
Stanford 1 2 .333
If Hunt's proteges win two of
the three Trojan series games,
and California defeats the Bruins
in the final game of their series
tomorrow night, then Stanford
will go against U.C.L.A., each
team with a standing of .500.
We'd rather like to see things
happen that way.
It appears that Captain Jack
Bruner, star Trojan center, may
be out of Monday's and Tuesday's
games on account of illness. This
is a tough break for U.S.C., but it
will make things much easier for
Chuck Smalling and the rest of
the Redshirts.

SIMON-PURITY
An article by John It. Tunis in the j
February Harpers, entitled "The j
Lawn Tennis Industry," says dire j
things about the simon pure state of
this sport, which is declared to be
the lowest of the low among amateur
sports.
The leading players (not alone
Tilden) devote all their time to
tennis, and through the publicity
received from it are able to make
fat salaries at jobs upon which
they expend little or no work.
And the same soft thing is worked
by the United States Lawn Ten
nis Association officials, Tunis
says.
This is a gloomy picture, and it
seems as if the author is merely an
other of those grandstand tennis!

players who are rabid on the subject
of amateurism in tennis. If John Doeg
is able to sell five times as much
insurance when he starts to earn a
living because of his being a tennis
player of international note, why
shouldn't he be entitled to five times
the salary that another Stanford man
would at first earn, the latter's name
not being known outside of the pages
of the Quad?
