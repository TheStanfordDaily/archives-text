# COMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is quite evident from the way
Frank Sauliere wrote his article about
football awards that he doesn't under
stand the situation. I would like,
therefore, to take a few lines of The
Daily (if you will permit) to try to
explain the matter. Frank's greatest
fear is that the situation will not be
solved permanently by adopting the
new rules, but a little explanation
should clear the matter. The idea of
allowing tha coach, captain, etc., to
recommend three men for awards is
only partly due to the results of last
fall. As a matter of fact, there were
twice that many who deserved their
awards but did not earn (?) them.
Ted Klabau would have earned a
letter had he not been removed from
a game because of injuries. Why
shouldn't he receive a letter?
Dick Worden, who, after a late
start because of injuries, stepped in
ahead of men who had been regulars
earlier in the season and played a
splendid game in the last half against
Pittsburgh, deserves a letter. I think
this is quite evident, inasmuch as
Worden played a major part in our
victory at Pasadena.
Tom Driscoll, by hard work, fought
his way from the Grays to the varsity
squad and got the "call" over more
experienced men in the Pittsburgh
game. If determination and improve
ment count for anything why should-1
n't Driscoll be awarded a letter?
"Chuck" Smalling would have made
a letter if he had played either tackle
or fullback constantly, but he was
held in reserve for both positions and,
as a result, didn't have time to quali
fy for a Block "S." If self-sacrifice
means anything why shouldn't Small
ing be entitled to a letter?
Herb Fleishhacker's work against
such a team as U.S.C. is enough to ;
qualify him for a letter. His playing
in that game was what gave Stanford
a tie with the Trojans and retained
for the Cardinals the conference
championship.
"Viv" Morley lacked a few minutes' |
conference playing time, but he re-!
ceived the award allowed by the I
present rules. He justly deserved it.
I believe it may be seen that all six ,
of these men were entitled to their 1
awards last fall, but there must be
some restrictions. It is for that rea
ron that we (those of us who were
interested enough to formulate the
petition) decided that three was
about the proper number to be
granted letters on recommendation.
Frank also infers that the petition
was not "prompted by a sense of fair
play," but that is the prime purpose
of the petition. Under the existing
rules for awards no such a thing as
"fair play" is possible. We are ac
cused of not acting in a spirit of
"fair play" for wishing to see awards j
go to those who deserve them. That !
may be so, but if it is, my idea of
"fair play" isn't what it should be. !
The retroactive clause is only of
secondary importance, but a little ex
planation of it may be of some good.
Having taken it for granted that the
men named above are entitled to
their awards, why not let them have
them ?
The principal circumstances which
caused the petition to be circulated at.
this time occurred last fall, and it
was for that reason that the retro
active clause was put in.
As far as I know, the men who
would be recommended if the new
rule should be adopted have not as
yet been selected. It all depends on
who the coach, captain, etc., think
should receive them.
Sincerely, MIKE MURPHY, '28.
Tlie Editor, Sir:
On the ballot at the coming student

body election will appear an amend
ment to the constitution which, if
passed, will place gymnastics, polo,
fencing, and golf on the same basis
as swimming, boxing, and soccer. In
[ the interest of Stanford champions it
is hoped that the amendment will
! meet defeat.
! The worth of any award lies in the
difficulty with which it must be ob-
I tained. An individual or a team must
! prove its qualities before it should be
granted its reward for its accomplish
j ments. And tlio award should cor
respond to the accomplishment.
Casting aside for the moment our
likes or dislikes as regards any par
ticular sport, let us look impartially
at the accomplishments of the teams
listed under the head of secondary
minor sports. With one exception
these teams have accomplished noth
ing in the line of bringing home cham
pionships. They have never merited
national recognition. They have never
garnered a Pacific Coast champion
ship, polo, I believe, excepted. A good
part of these teams as yet ha 3 scarce
ly earned local recognition. In other
words the circle German "S" has
been in keeping with their accom
plishments.
Consider now the first-class minor
sport teams. To be sure soccer has
never earned national publicity; nei
ther has boxing, but both have turned
out some winning teams. On second
thought, I believe that Stanford has
turned out intercollegiate boxiug
champions; certainly Stanford boxers
have made names for themselves in
Pacific Coast competition. Stanford's
fame in the world of competition has
never been more consistently upheld
than by its swimming and diving
teams, major sports notwithstanding.
Stanford divers are and have been
international champions; they have
competed for America at the Olym
pics, and have brought home victories.
The national springboard and plat
form champion is a Stanford man and
those holding the titles before him
have been Stanford men. Stanford
swimmers have been nationally
known; some of their records stand
unbeaten; only last week six varsity
records in Pacific Coast Conference
intercollegiate competition were
broken by Cardinal swimmers. And
when it comes to water polo Stan
ford is again right near the top.
In the light of these considerations
it seems that there is quite a gap
between a swimming team that
gathers championships and a fencing
team that doesn't. And yet it is pro
posed to give them both the same
award, to put them both on an equal
footing, to give the team members
the same circle "S."
An athlete's letter means a whole
lot to him. He's got something that
everyone else can't get. If everyone
had blocks, their value would be
nothing. If everyone got blocks their
value would be lessened to winners
in major sports. It follows that if
every minor sport is entitled to circle
blocks their value will depreciate in
the eyes of first-class minor sport
teams. If this is not a logical conclu
sion why not grant the block "S" to
every team from golf to football?
When golf and fencing and gymnas
tics have made names for themselves
then will be the time to raise the
standard of their award.-* Until they
do accomplish something their status
should remain as it is. That is only
fair to those teams that have really

established themselves as behig cf
championship calibre.

and not otherwise. —Creagh, '27.
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial "Nay, Nay!" in yes
terday's paper tends to distort the
facts of the case. It would lead one
(and I suppose that was your inten
tion) to believe that there is a con
centrated opposition on the part of
first-class minor sport men to defeat
this worthy measure. Quoting your
editorial: "Naturally, those who are
engaged in these sports would like to
see the amendment pass even as
those who participate in swimming,
boxing, and soccer would not like
to see it pass."
By what right, may I ask, do you
conclude such a proposition? If you
will but take the pains to read the
petition, you will not find one single
signature of a man engaged in the
sports affected. What's more, you will
find there the names of wearers of
the circle block "S."
May I also call your attention to the
fact that the Circle "S" Society is
taking the proposal under advise
ment, since many of its members fa
vor it. Another thing; if you will in
terview the Minor Sports department
perhaps they can enlighten you as to
its stand on the matter.
The Editor, Sir:
Although it is apparent you did not
intend to help the cause of the sec
ond class minor sports in yesterday's
editorial, you nevertheless did so!
Your editorial reads in part: "Con
sider the sports which would be
raised (in classification) by adoption
of this amendment: gymnastics, polo,
fencing, golf. These sports represent,
collectively, an approach to the ulti
mate minimum in drawing power
either of competitors or spectators."
May I call your attention to the fact
that one of the sports mentioned
above, and which you do not believe
worthy of a circle block "S" receives
now a circle block "S." Which goes to
prove one of the contentions of the
advocates of the circle block "S" for
all minor sports, namely, that it is
difficult to determine just where to
draw the line between first and sec
ond class minor sports. Yes, polo is
that sport receiving a circle block "S."

[ the interest of Stanford champions it
is hoped that the amendment will
! meet defeat.
! The worth of any award lies in the
difficulty with which it must be ob-
I tained. An individual or a team must
! prove its qualities before it should be
granted its reward for its accomplish
j ments. And tlio award should cor
respond to the accomplishment.
Casting aside for the moment our
likes or dislikes as regards any par
ticular sport, let us look impartially
at the accomplishments of the teams
listed under the head of secondary
minor sports. With one exception
these teams have accomplished noth
ing in the line of bringing home cham
pionships. They have never merited
national recognition. They have never
garnered a Pacific Coast champion
ship, polo, I believe, excepted. A good
part of these teams as yet ha 3 scarce
ly earned local recognition. In other
words the circle German "S" has
been in keeping with their accom
plishments.
Consider now the first-class minor
sport teams. To be sure soccer has
never earned national publicity; nei
ther has boxing, but both have turned
out some winning teams. On second
thought, I believe that Stanford has
turned out intercollegiate boxiug
champions; certainly Stanford boxers
have made names for themselves in
Pacific Coast competition. Stanford's
fame in the world of competition has
never been more consistently upheld
than by its swimming and diving
teams, major sports notwithstanding.
Stanford divers are and have been
international champions; they have
competed for America at the Olym
pics, and have brought home victories.
The national springboard and plat
form champion is a Stanford man and
those holding the titles before him
have been Stanford men. Stanford
swimmers have been nationally
known; some of their records stand
unbeaten; only last week six varsity
records in Pacific Coast Conference
intercollegiate competition were
broken by Cardinal swimmers. And
when it comes to water polo Stan
ford is again right near the top.
In the light of these considerations
it seems that there is quite a gap
between a swimming team that
gathers championships and a fencing
team that doesn't. And yet it is pro
posed to give them both the same
award, to put them both on an equal
footing, to give the team members
the same circle "S."
An athlete's letter means a whole
lot to him. He's got something that
everyone else can't get. If everyone
had blocks, their value would be
nothing. If everyone got blocks their
value would be lessened to winners
in major sports. It follows that if
every minor sport is entitled to circle
blocks their value will depreciate in
the eyes of first-class minor sport
teams. If this is not a logical conclu
sion why not grant the block "S" to
every team from golf to football?
When golf and fencing and gymnas
tics have made names for themselves
then will be the time to raise the
standard of their award.-* Until they
do accomplish something their status
should remain as it is. That is only
fair to those teams that have really

established themselves as behig cf
championship calibre.

The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial "Nay, Nay!" in yes
terday's paper tends to distort the
facts of the case. It would lead one
(and I suppose that was your inten
tion) to believe that there is a con
centrated opposition on the part of
first-class minor sport men to defeat
this worthy measure. Quoting your
editorial: "Naturally, those who are
engaged in these sports would like to
see the amendment pass even as
those who participate in swimming,
boxing, and soccer would not like
to see it pass."
By what right, may I ask, do you
conclude such a proposition? If you
will but take the pains to read the
petition, you will not find one single
signature of a man engaged in the
sports affected. What's more, you will
find there the names of wearers of
the circle block "S."
May I also call your attention to the
fact that the Circle "S" Society is
taking the proposal under advise
ment, since many of its members fa
vor it. Another thing; if you will in
terview the Minor Sports department
perhaps they can enlighten you as to
its stand on the matter.
The Editor, Sir:
Although it is apparent you did not
intend to help the cause of the sec
ond class minor sports in yesterday's
editorial, you nevertheless did so!
Your editorial reads in part: "Con
sider the sports which would be
raised (in classification) by adoption
of this amendment: gymnastics, polo,
fencing, golf. These sports represent,
collectively, an approach to the ulti
mate minimum in drawing power
either of competitors or spectators."
May I call your attention to the fact
that one of the sports mentioned
above, and which you do not believe
worthy of a circle block "S" receives
now a circle block "S." Which goes to
prove one of the contentions of the
advocates of the circle block "S" for
all minor sports, namely, that it is
difficult to determine just where to
draw the line between first and sec
ond class minor sports. Yes, polo is
that sport receiving a circle block "S."

The Editor, Sir:
It is quite evident from the way
Frank Sauliere wrote his article about
football awards that he doesn't under
stand the situation. I would like,
therefore, to take a few lines of The
Daily (if you will permit) to try to
explain the matter. Frank's greatest
fear is that the situation will not be
solved permanently by adopting the
new rules, but a little explanation
should clear the matter. The idea of
allowing tha coach, captain, etc., to
recommend three men for awards is
only partly due to the results of last
fall. As a matter of fact, there were
twice that many who deserved their
awards but did not earn (?) them.
Ted Klabau would have earned a
letter had he not been removed from
a game because of injuries. Why
shouldn't he receive a letter?
Dick Worden, who, after a late
start because of injuries, stepped in
ahead of men who had been regulars
earlier in the season and played a
splendid game in the last half against
Pittsburgh, deserves a letter. I think
this is quite evident, inasmuch as
Worden played a major part in our
victory at Pasadena.
Tom Driscoll, by hard work, fought
his way from the Grays to the varsity
squad and got the "call" over more
experienced men in the Pittsburgh
game. If determination and improve
ment count for anything why should-1
n't Driscoll be awarded a letter?
"Chuck" Smalling would have made
a letter if he had played either tackle
or fullback constantly, but he was
held in reserve for both positions and,
as a result, didn't have time to quali
fy for a Block "S." If self-sacrifice
means anything why shouldn't Small
ing be entitled to a letter?
Herb Fleishhacker's work against
such a team as U.S.C. is enough to ;
qualify him for a letter. His playing
in that game was what gave Stanford
a tie with the Trojans and retained
for the Cardinals the conference
championship.
"Viv" Morley lacked a few minutes' |
conference playing time, but he re-!
ceived the award allowed by the I
present rules. He justly deserved it.
I believe it may be seen that all six ,
of these men were entitled to their 1
awards last fall, but there must be
some restrictions. It is for that rea
ron that we (those of us who were
interested enough to formulate the
petition) decided that three was
about the proper number to be
granted letters on recommendation.
Frank also infers that the petition
was not "prompted by a sense of fair
play," but that is the prime purpose
of the petition. Under the existing
rules for awards no such a thing as
"fair play" is possible. We are ac
cused of not acting in a spirit of
"fair play" for wishing to see awards j
go to those who deserve them. That !
may be so, but if it is, my idea of
"fair play" isn't what it should be. !
The retroactive clause is only of
secondary importance, but a little ex
planation of it may be of some good.
Having taken it for granted that the
men named above are entitled to
their awards, why not let them have
them ?
The principal circumstances which
caused the petition to be circulated at.
this time occurred last fall, and it
was for that reason that the retro
active clause was put in.
As far as I know, the men who
would be recommended if the new
rule should be adopted have not as
yet been selected. It all depends on
who the coach, captain, etc., think
should receive them.
Sincerely, MIKE MURPHY, '28.

signature of a man engaged in the
sports affected. What's more, you will
find there the names of wearers of
the circle block "S."
May I also call your attention to the
fact that the Circle "S" Society is
taking the proposal under advise
ment, since many of its members fa
vor it. Another thing; if you will in
terview the Minor Sports department
perhaps they can enlighten you as to
its stand on the matter.
The Editor, Sir:
Although it is apparent you did not
intend to help the cause of the sec
ond class minor sports in yesterday's
editorial, you nevertheless did so!
Your editorial reads in part: "Con
sider the sports which would be
raised (in classification) by adoption
of this amendment: gymnastics, polo,
fencing, golf. These sports represent,
collectively, an approach to the ulti
mate minimum in drawing power
either of competitors or spectators."
May I call your attention to the fact
that one of the sports mentioned
above, and which you do not believe
worthy of a circle block "S" receives
now a circle block "S." Which goes to
prove one of the contentions of the
advocates of the circle block "S" for
all minor sports, namely, that it is
difficult to determine just where to
draw the line between first and sec
ond class minor sports. Yes, polo is
that sport receiving a circle block "S."

The Editor, Sir:
It is quite evident from the way
Frank Sauliere wrote his article about
football awards that he doesn't under
stand the situation. I would like,
therefore, to take a few lines of The
Daily (if you will permit) to try to
explain the matter. Frank's greatest
fear is that the situation will not be
solved permanently by adopting the
new rules, but a little explanation
should clear the matter. The idea of
allowing tha coach, captain, etc., to
recommend three men for awards is
only partly due to the results of last
fall. As a matter of fact, there were
twice that many who deserved their
awards but did not earn (?) them.
Ted Klabau would have earned a
letter had he not been removed from
a game because of injuries. Why
shouldn't he receive a letter?
Dick Worden, who, after a late
start because of injuries, stepped in
ahead of men who had been regulars
earlier in the season and played a
splendid game in the last half against
Pittsburgh, deserves a letter. I think
this is quite evident, inasmuch as
Worden played a major part in our
victory at Pasadena.
Tom Driscoll, by hard work, fought
his way from the Grays to the varsity
squad and got the "call" over more
experienced men in the Pittsburgh
game. If determination and improve
ment count for anything why should-1
n't Driscoll be awarded a letter?
"Chuck" Smalling would have made
a letter if he had played either tackle
or fullback constantly, but he was
held in reserve for both positions and,
as a result, didn't have time to quali
fy for a Block "S." If self-sacrifice
means anything why shouldn't Small
ing be entitled to a letter?
Herb Fleishhacker's work against
such a team as U.S.C. is enough to ;
qualify him for a letter. His playing
in that game was what gave Stanford
a tie with the Trojans and retained
for the Cardinals the conference
championship.
"Viv" Morley lacked a few minutes' |
conference playing time, but he re-!
ceived the award allowed by the I
present rules. He justly deserved it.
I believe it may be seen that all six ,
of these men were entitled to their 1
awards last fall, but there must be
some restrictions. It is for that rea
ron that we (those of us who were
interested enough to formulate the
petition) decided that three was
about the proper number to be
granted letters on recommendation.
Frank also infers that the petition
was not "prompted by a sense of fair
play," but that is the prime purpose
of the petition. Under the existing
rules for awards no such a thing as
"fair play" is possible. We are ac
cused of not acting in a spirit of
"fair play" for wishing to see awards j
go to those who deserve them. That !
may be so, but if it is, my idea of
"fair play" isn't what it should be. !
The retroactive clause is only of
secondary importance, but a little ex
planation of it may be of some good.
Having taken it for granted that the
men named above are entitled to
their awards, why not let them have
them ?
The principal circumstances which
caused the petition to be circulated at.
this time occurred last fall, and it
was for that reason that the retro
active clause was put in.
As far as I know, the men who
would be recommended if the new
rule should be adopted have not as
yet been selected. It all depends on
who the coach, captain, etc., think
should receive them.
Sincerely, MIKE MURPHY, '28.
Tlie Editor, Sir:
On the ballot at the coming student

body election will appear an amend
ment to the constitution which, if
passed, will place gymnastics, polo,
fencing, and golf on the same basis
as swimming, boxing, and soccer. In
[ the interest of Stanford champions it
is hoped that the amendment will
! meet defeat.
! The worth of any award lies in the
difficulty with which it must be ob-
I tained. An individual or a team must
! prove its qualities before it should be
granted its reward for its accomplish
j ments. And tlio award should cor
respond to the accomplishment.
Casting aside for the moment our
likes or dislikes as regards any par
ticular sport, let us look impartially
at the accomplishments of the teams
listed under the head of secondary
minor sports. With one exception
these teams have accomplished noth
ing in the line of bringing home cham
pionships. They have never merited
national recognition. They have never
garnered a Pacific Coast champion
ship, polo, I believe, excepted. A good
part of these teams as yet ha 3 scarce
ly earned local recognition. In other
words the circle German "S" has
been in keeping with their accom
plishments.
Consider now the first-class minor
sport teams. To be sure soccer has
never earned national publicity; nei
ther has boxing, but both have turned
out some winning teams. On second
thought, I believe that Stanford has
turned out intercollegiate boxiug
champions; certainly Stanford boxers
have made names for themselves in
Pacific Coast competition. Stanford's
fame in the world of competition has
never been more consistently upheld
than by its swimming and diving
teams, major sports notwithstanding.
Stanford divers are and have been
international champions; they have
competed for America at the Olym
pics, and have brought home victories.
The national springboard and plat
form champion is a Stanford man and
those holding the titles before him
have been Stanford men. Stanford
swimmers have been nationally
known; some of their records stand
unbeaten; only last week six varsity
records in Pacific Coast Conference
intercollegiate competition were
broken by Cardinal swimmers. And
when it comes to water polo Stan
ford is again right near the top.
In the light of these considerations
it seems that there is quite a gap
between a swimming team that
gathers championships and a fencing
team that doesn't. And yet it is pro
posed to give them both the same
award, to put them both on an equal
footing, to give the team members
the same circle "S."
An athlete's letter means a whole
lot to him. He's got something that
everyone else can't get. If everyone
had blocks, their value would be
nothing. If everyone got blocks their
value would be lessened to winners
in major sports. It follows that if
every minor sport is entitled to circle
blocks their value will depreciate in
the eyes of first-class minor sport
teams. If this is not a logical conclu
sion why not grant the block "S" to
every team from golf to football?
When golf and fencing and gymnas
tics have made names for themselves
then will be the time to raise the
standard of their award.-* Until they
do accomplish something their status
should remain as it is. That is only
fair to those teams that have really

established themselves as behig cf
championship calibre.

and not otherwise. —Creagh, '27.
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial "Nay, Nay!" in yes
terday's paper tends to distort the
facts of the case. It would lead one
(and I suppose that was your inten
tion) to believe that there is a con
centrated opposition on the part of
first-class minor sport men to defeat
this worthy measure. Quoting your
editorial: "Naturally, those who are
engaged in these sports would like to
see the amendment pass even as
those who participate in swimming,
boxing, and soccer would not like
to see it pass."
By what right, may I ask, do you
conclude such a proposition? If you
will but take the pains to read the
petition, you will not find one single
signature of a man engaged in the
sports affected. What's more, you will
find there the names of wearers of

awards last fall, but there must be
some restrictions. It is for that rea
ron that we (those of us who were
interested enough to formulate the
petition) decided that three was
about the proper number to be
granted letters on recommendation.
Frank also infers that the petition
was not "prompted by a sense of fair
play," but that is the prime purpose
of the petition. Under the existing
rules for awards no such a thing as
"fair play" is possible. We are ac
cused of not acting in a spirit of
"fair play" for wishing to see awards j
go to those who deserve them. That !
may be so, but if it is, my idea of
"fair play" isn't what it should be. !
The retroactive clause is only of
secondary importance, but a little ex
planation of it may be of some good.
Having taken it for granted that the
men named above are entitled to
their awards, why not let them have
them ?
The principal circumstances which
caused the petition to be circulated at.
this time occurred last fall, and it
was for that reason that the retro
active clause was put in.
As far as I know, the men who
would be recommended if the new
rule should be adopted have not as
yet been selected. It all depends on
who the coach, captain, etc., think
should receive them.

Tlie Editor, Sir:
On the ballot at the coming student

body election will appear an amend
ment to the constitution which, if
passed, will place gymnastics, polo,
fencing, and golf on the same basis
as swimming, boxing, and soccer. In
[ the interest of Stanford champions it
is hoped that the amendment will
! meet defeat.
! The worth of any award lies in the
difficulty with which it must be ob-
I tained. An individual or a team must
! prove its qualities before it should be
granted its reward for its accomplish
j ments. And tlio award should cor
respond to the accomplishment.
Casting aside for the moment our
likes or dislikes as regards any par
ticular sport, let us look impartially
at the accomplishments of the teams
listed under the head of secondary
minor sports. With one exception
these teams have accomplished noth
ing in the line of bringing home cham
pionships. They have never merited
national recognition. They have never
garnered a Pacific Coast champion
ship, polo, I believe, excepted. A good
part of these teams as yet ha 3 scarce
ly earned local recognition. In other
words the circle German "S" has
been in keeping with their accom
plishments.
Consider now the first-class minor
sport teams. To be sure soccer has
never earned national publicity; nei
ther has boxing, but both have turned
out some winning teams. On second
thought, I believe that Stanford has
turned out intercollegiate boxiug
champions; certainly Stanford boxers
have made names for themselves in
Pacific Coast competition. Stanford's
fame in the world of competition has
never been more consistently upheld
than by its swimming and diving
teams, major sports notwithstanding.
Stanford divers are and have been
international champions; they have
competed for America at the Olym
pics, and have brought home victories.
The national springboard and plat
form champion is a Stanford man and
those holding the titles before him
have been Stanford men. Stanford
swimmers have been nationally
known; some of their records stand
unbeaten; only last week six varsity
records in Pacific Coast Conference
intercollegiate competition were
broken by Cardinal swimmers. And
when it comes to water polo Stan
ford is again right near the top.
In the light of these considerations
it seems that there is quite a gap
between a swimming team that
gathers championships and a fencing
team that doesn't. And yet it is pro
posed to give them both the same
award, to put them both on an equal
footing, to give the team members
the same circle "S."
An athlete's letter means a whole
lot to him. He's got something that
everyone else can't get. If everyone
had blocks, their value would be
nothing. If everyone got blocks their
value would be lessened to winners
in major sports. It follows that if
every minor sport is entitled to circle
blocks their value will depreciate in
the eyes of first-class minor sport
teams. If this is not a logical conclu
sion why not grant the block "S" to
every team from golf to football?
When golf and fencing and gymnas
tics have made names for themselves
then will be the time to raise the
standard of their award.-* Until they
do accomplish something their status
should remain as it is. That is only
fair to those teams that have really

established themselves as behig cf
championship calibre.

and not otherwise. —Creagh, '27.
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial "Nay, Nay!" in yes
terday's paper tends to distort the
facts of the case. It would lead one
(and I suppose that was your inten
tion) to believe that there is a con
centrated opposition on the part of
first-class minor sport men to defeat
this worthy measure. Quoting your
editorial: "Naturally, those who are
engaged in these sports would like to
see the amendment pass even as
those who participate in swimming,
boxing, and soccer would not like
to see it pass."
By what right, may I ask, do you
conclude such a proposition? If you
will but take the pains to read the
petition, you will not find one single
signature of a man engaged in the
sports affected. What's more, you will
find there the names of wearers of
the circle block "S."
May I also call your attention to the
fact that the Circle "S" Society is
taking the proposal under advise
ment, since many of its members fa
vor it. Another thing; if you will in
terview the Minor Sports department
perhaps they can enlighten you as to
its stand on the matter.
The Editor, Sir:
Although it is apparent you did not
intend to help the cause of the sec
ond class minor sports in yesterday's
editorial, you nevertheless did so!
Your editorial reads in part: "Con
sider the sports which would be
raised (in classification) by adoption
of this amendment: gymnastics, polo,
fencing, golf. These sports represent,
collectively, an approach to the ulti
mate minimum in drawing power
either of competitors or spectators."
May I call your attention to the fact
that one of the sports mentioned
above, and which you do not believe
worthy of a circle block "S" receives
now a circle block "S." Which goes to
prove one of the contentions of the
advocates of the circle block "S" for
all minor sports, namely, that it is
difficult to determine just where to
draw the line between first and sec
ond class minor sports. Yes, polo is
that sport receiving a circle block "S."

The Editor, Sir:
It is quite evident from the way
Frank Sauliere wrote his article about
football awards that he doesn't under
stand the situation. I would like,
therefore, to take a few lines of The
Daily (if you will permit) to try to
explain the matter. Frank's greatest
fear is that the situation will not be
solved permanently by adopting the
new rules, but a little explanation
should clear the matter. The idea of
allowing tha coach, captain, etc., to
recommend three men for awards is
only partly due to the results of last
fall. As a matter of fact, there were
twice that many who deserved their
awards but did not earn (?) them.
Ted Klabau would have earned a
letter had he not been removed from
a game because of injuries. Why
shouldn't he receive a letter?
Dick Worden, who, after a late
start because of injuries, stepped in
ahead of men who had been regulars
earlier in the season and played a
splendid game in the last half against
Pittsburgh, deserves a letter. I think
this is quite evident, inasmuch as
Worden played a major part in our
victory at Pasadena.
Tom Driscoll, by hard work, fought
his way from the Grays to the varsity
squad and got the "call" over more
experienced men in the Pittsburgh
game. If determination and improve
ment count for anything why should-1
n't Driscoll be awarded a letter?
"Chuck" Smalling would have made
a letter if he had played either tackle
or fullback constantly, but he was
held in reserve for both positions and,
as a result, didn't have time to quali
fy for a Block "S." If self-sacrifice
means anything why shouldn't Small
ing be entitled to a letter?
Herb Fleishhacker's work against
such a team as U.S.C. is enough to ;
qualify him for a letter. His playing
in that game was what gave Stanford
a tie with the Trojans and retained
for the Cardinals the conference
championship.
"Viv" Morley lacked a few minutes' |
conference playing time, but he re-!
ceived the award allowed by the I
present rules. He justly deserved it.
I believe it may be seen that all six ,
of these men were entitled to their 1
awards last fall, but there must be
some restrictions. It is for that rea
ron that we (those of us who were
interested enough to formulate the
petition) decided that three was

footing, to give the team members
the same circle "S."
An athlete's letter means a whole
lot to him. He's got something that
everyone else can't get. If everyone
had blocks, their value would be
nothing. If everyone got blocks their
value would be lessened to winners
in major sports. It follows that if
every minor sport is entitled to circle
blocks their value will depreciate in
the eyes of first-class minor sport
teams. If this is not a logical conclu
sion why not grant the block "S" to
every team from golf to football?
When golf and fencing and gymnas
tics have made names for themselves
then will be the time to raise the
standard of their award.-* Until they
do accomplish something their status
should remain as it is. That is only
fair to those teams that have really

established themselves as behig cf
championship calibre.

The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial "Nay, Nay!" in yes
terday's paper tends to distort the
facts of the case. It would lead one
(and I suppose that was your inten
tion) to believe that there is a con
centrated opposition on the part of
first-class minor sport men to defeat
this worthy measure. Quoting your
editorial: "Naturally, those who are
engaged in these sports would like to
see the amendment pass even as
those who participate in swimming,
boxing, and soccer would not like
to see it pass."
By what right, may I ask, do you
conclude such a proposition? If you
will but take the pains to read the
petition, you will not find one single
signature of a man engaged in the
sports affected. What's more, you will
find there the names of wearers of
the circle block "S."
May I also call your attention to the
fact that the Circle "S" Society is
taking the proposal under advise
ment, since many of its members fa
vor it. Another thing; if you will in
terview the Minor Sports department
perhaps they can enlighten you as to
its stand on the matter.
The Editor, Sir:
Although it is apparent you did not
intend to help the cause of the sec
ond class minor sports in yesterday's
editorial, you nevertheless did so!
Your editorial reads in part: "Con
sider the sports which would be
raised (in classification) by adoption
of this amendment: gymnastics, polo,
fencing, golf. These sports represent,
collectively, an approach to the ulti
mate minimum in drawing power
either of competitors or spectators."
May I call your attention to the fact
that one of the sports mentioned
above, and which you do not believe
worthy of a circle block "S" receives
now a circle block "S." Which goes to
prove one of the contentions of the
advocates of the circle block "S" for
all minor sports, namely, that it is
difficult to determine just where to
draw the line between first and sec
ond class minor sports. Yes, polo is
that sport receiving a circle block "S."

The Editor, Sir:
It is quite evident from the way
Frank Sauliere wrote his article about
football awards that he doesn't under
stand the situation. I would like,
therefore, to take a few lines of The
Daily (if you will permit) to try to
explain the matter. Frank's greatest
fear is that the situation will not be
solved permanently by adopting the
new rules, but a little explanation
should clear the matter. The idea of
allowing tha coach, captain, etc., to
recommend three men for awards is
only partly due to the results of last
fall. As a matter of fact, there were
twice that many who deserved their
awards but did not earn (?) them.
Ted Klabau would have earned a
letter had he not been removed from
a game because of injuries. Why
shouldn't he receive a letter?
Dick Worden, who, after a late
start because of injuries, stepped in
ahead of men who had been regulars
earlier in the season and played a
splendid game in the last half against
Pittsburgh, deserves a letter. I think
this is quite evident, inasmuch as
Worden played a major part in our
victory at Pasadena.
Tom Driscoll, by hard work, fought
his way from the Grays to the varsity
squad and got the "call" over more
experienced men in the Pittsburgh
game. If determination and improve
ment count for anything why should-1
n't Driscoll be awarded a letter?
"Chuck" Smalling would have made
a letter if he had played either tackle
or fullback constantly, but he was
held in reserve for both positions and,
as a result, didn't have time to quali
fy for a Block "S." If self-sacrifice
means anything why shouldn't Small
ing be entitled to a letter?
Herb Fleishhacker's work against
such a team as U.S.C. is enough to ;
qualify him for a letter. His playing
in that game was what gave Stanford
a tie with the Trojans and retained
for the Cardinals the conference
championship.
"Viv" Morley lacked a few minutes' |
conference playing time, but he re-!
ceived the award allowed by the I
present rules. He justly deserved it.
I believe it may be seen that all six ,
of these men were entitled to their 1
awards last fall, but there must be
some restrictions. It is for that rea
ron that we (those of us who were
interested enough to formulate the
petition) decided that three was
about the proper number to be
granted letters on recommendation.
Frank also infers that the petition
was not "prompted by a sense of fair
play," but that is the prime purpose
of the petition. Under the existing
rules for awards no such a thing as
"fair play" is possible. We are ac
cused of not acting in a spirit of
"fair play" for wishing to see awards j
go to those who deserve them. That !
may be so, but if it is, my idea of
"fair play" isn't what it should be. !
The retroactive clause is only of
secondary importance, but a little ex
planation of it may be of some good.
Having taken it for granted that the
men named above are entitled to
their awards, why not let them have
them ?
The principal circumstances which
caused the petition to be circulated at.
this time occurred last fall, and it
was for that reason that the retro
active clause was put in.
As far as I know, the men who
would be recommended if the new
rule should be adopted have not as
yet been selected. It all depends on
who the coach, captain, etc., think
should receive them.
Sincerely, MIKE MURPHY, '28.
Tlie Editor, Sir:
On the ballot at the coming student

body election will appear an amend
ment to the constitution which, if
passed, will place gymnastics, polo,
fencing, and golf on the same basis
as swimming, boxing, and soccer. In
[ the interest of Stanford champions it
is hoped that the amendment will
! meet defeat.
! The worth of any award lies in the
difficulty with which it must be ob-
I tained. An individual or a team must
! prove its qualities before it should be
granted its reward for its accomplish
j ments. And tlio award should cor
respond to the accomplishment.
Casting aside for the moment our
likes or dislikes as regards any par
ticular sport, let us look impartially
at the accomplishments of the teams
listed under the head of secondary
minor sports. With one exception
these teams have accomplished noth
ing in the line of bringing home cham
pionships. They have never merited
national recognition. They have never
garnered a Pacific Coast champion
ship, polo, I believe, excepted. A good
part of these teams as yet ha 3 scarce
ly earned local recognition. In other
words the circle German "S" has
been in keeping with their accom
plishments.
Consider now the first-class minor
sport teams. To be sure soccer has
never earned national publicity; nei
ther has boxing, but both have turned
out some winning teams. On second
thought, I believe that Stanford has
turned out intercollegiate boxiug
champions; certainly Stanford boxers
have made names for themselves in
Pacific Coast competition. Stanford's
fame in the world of competition has
never been more consistently upheld
than by its swimming and diving
teams, major sports notwithstanding.
Stanford divers are and have been
international champions; they have
competed for America at the Olym
pics, and have brought home victories.
The national springboard and plat
form champion is a Stanford man and
those holding the titles before him
have been Stanford men. Stanford
swimmers have been nationally
known; some of their records stand
unbeaten; only last week six varsity
records in Pacific Coast Conference
intercollegiate competition were
broken by Cardinal swimmers. And
when it comes to water polo Stan
ford is again right near the top.
In the light of these considerations
it seems that there is quite a gap
between a swimming team that
gathers championships and a fencing
team that doesn't. And yet it is pro
posed to give them both the same
award, to put them both on an equal
footing, to give the team members
the same circle "S."
An athlete's letter means a whole
lot to him. He's got something that
everyone else can't get. If everyone

sion why not grant the block "S" to
