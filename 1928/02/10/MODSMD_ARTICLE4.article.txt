# Doeg, Ray Casey Trim Varsity Duo By 6-4, 6-4, 7-5
## 
### 
Capitalizing on their mighty ser
vices, John Doeg and Ray Casey de
feated Ralph McElvenny and Alan
Herrington, ranking varsity doubles
team, three straight sets in an exhibi
tion match played yesterday on the
new Stanford courts. The scores were
6-4, G-4, 7-5.
During the first set Herrington car
ried the burden of play for his team
mate, McElvenny, who had difficulty
forming his shots. McElvenny im
proved as the games passed, holding
up his part well in the second and
third sets.
The play from first to last was
dominated by the remarkable serving
of Doeg and Casey. Both large, pow
erful men, they smashed over clean
aces or unreturnable shots seemingly
at will. It took a set for Casey to get
his fast ones started, but Doeg kept
the crowd aglee from the first with
cannonball shots which were too fast
to return.
The Stanford pair had a chance to
win a set when they led 5-3 in the
final set. Casey and Doeg had other
intentions and won four straight
games for the match.
Hal Davis, tennis coach, plans
weekly practice matches with outside
competition, especially in doubles, to
prepare his charges for the California
meet on April 21, and the Pacific
Coast Conference in May.
