EUGENE, Ore., Feb. 9.—(P.1.P.)—
Wet Republicans voting for Hoover
and dry Democrats for A1 Smith; wet
Democrats for McAdoo and dry Re
publicans for almost anybody; these
were a few of the paradoxes of a
straw ballot just concluded on the
University of Oregon campus.
Some wore not satisfied with the
list of candidates submitted for their
vote and added their own choice,
among others, Will Rogers and Leon
Trotsky.
