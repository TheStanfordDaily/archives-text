## 
### 
"There are just as many serious- 1
minded young people today as ever," j
said Bishop E. L. Parsons, who will
preach in the Memorial Church Sun
day, in a recent address at the Philo- j
sophieal Union of the University of
California at Los Angeles.
The much-abused youth of today'
has a strong and consistent defender
in Bishop Parsons.
"Young people are quick to detect
shams. They are full of questions. :
The Church often treats these young
people badly. It gives them 'stones
for bread.' It gives them ancient j
phrases for vital truths. It gives them j
authority instead of inspiration and i
guidance. It gives them rebukes in- \
stead of sympathy. I venture to sug-!
gest that the best thing we can do is j
to stop worrying about the younger |
generation and worry a little more
about ourselves.
The program for Sunday is as fol-!
lows:
11 a.m. —Divine Worship and Sermon.
Preacher, Rt. Rev. Edward L. Parsons, I
Bishop of California.
Anthems:
Blessed Is He Who Cometh..Gounod j
Paul F. Brainerd tenor soloist
