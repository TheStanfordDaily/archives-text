### 
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. 9.—(U.P.)—
Attempts to reconcile differences concern
ing the principle of intervention were
made today in the Sixth Pan-American
Conference sub-committce handling the
subject. Five members of the committee
favored the proposals of Ricardo Beeche,
secretary of state of Sosta Rica, while
Argentine and Salvador voted against the
proposals.
The insistence of Honorio Pueyrredon,
president of the Argentine delegation,
that reduction of trade barriers and tar
iffs be included in the preamble of the
draft of the conference, resulted in the
failure of the committee on this subject
to agree.
