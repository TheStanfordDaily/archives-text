# WILLIAM HICKMAN IS FOUND SANE BY LOS ANGELES JURY
## Murderer Appears Saturday Morning for Sentence Before Trabucco 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9.—(U.P.)—
William Edward Hickman was sane when
he kidnapped and murdered twelve-year
; old Marion Parker, a jury decided here
| late today.
The four women and eight male mem-
I hers of the panel reached this unanimous
j verdict after only forty-two minutes of
! deliberation and on one ballot.
Hickman will appear before Judge J. J.
| Trabucco Saturday morning for sentence.
! The Mariposa jurist has the alternative
of sending him to death on the gallows
or to imprison him for life.
In the event that Judge Trabucco sen
tences Hickman to hang, the state will
jnot try "The Fox" for the slaying of Ivy
! Toms, District Attorney Asa Keyes stated
I last night. "If Hickman is given a life
i sentence," said Keyes, "we will require
{him to go to trial."
i If Judge Trabucco deems the extreme
! penalty necessary, Hickman will hang
at San Quentin within ninety days.
After Judge Trabucco set Saturday
morning, February 11, as the date of
i sentence, Hickman's attorney, Jerome
I Walsh, said that he would enter a formal
motion for a retrial at that time.
