WASHINGTON, Feb. 12â€” Secre
tary of Commerce Hoover Rave his
friends formal permission tonight to
enter his name in the Ohio Presiden
tial Primary.
He explained, however, that he
would make no active personal cam
paign for the Republican presidential
nomination and that his case is en
tirely in (lie hands of his friends.
Limits Money Expenditure
Expenditure of money in his be
half must be strictly limited and rigid
ly accounted for, Hoover declared.
He set forth his position in a letter
to Colonel Thad H. Brown, Columbus,
Ohio, chairman of the Hoover forces
in that state.
Hoover's letter definitely puts him
in the Republican race as a receptive
candidate.
Upholds Republican Party
He pledged himself, should "the
greatest trust which can be given by
our people" come to him, that he
would consider it his duty to carry
forward the principles of the Repub
lican Party and the objectives of
President Coolidge.
Hoover said he would be glad to
serve the American people through
the Republican Party in any way that
he could.
Not to Resign Office
He said the obligation as Secretary
of Commerce precluded his entering
upon a personal campaign, indicating
that he would remain in the cabinet
through the pre-convention contest.
Senator Willis was much incensed
that Hoover should consider going
into his state and issued a statement
warning him that the fight would be
no "powder puff and kid glove" affair.
The fact is that enemies of Hoover
were encouraging favorite sons in
every state where there was a figure
who by the remotest possibility could
be considered of presidential size.
Hoover's friends were faced with the
prospect of being completely encir
cled by hostile favorite sons who,
should they be able to prevent any
candidate from receiving a majority
of the convention would be able to
force a deadlock so that convention
leaders would assemble in a hotel
room and pick the nominee as they
picked Harding in 1920.
Prominent in the Hoover fight in
Ohio will be Colonel Thad Brown,
chairman of the Ohio Hoover commit
tee; Walter F. Brown, of Toledo, now
Assistant Secretary of Commerce;
and Representative Theodore H. Bur
ton, of Cleveland. Walter and Thad
Brown went to Cleveland last night
to make arrangements for launching
the fight in the primaries to be held
April 24.
