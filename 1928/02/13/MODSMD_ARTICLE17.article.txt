# DR. EDGAR J. FISHER TO TALK ON TURKEY AT TUESDAY LECTURE
## Speaker Is Dean of Robert College, Resident of Constantinople 
### 
"Turkey in Transition" will be the
| subject of a talk by Dr. Edgar J.
j Fisher, visiting professor of history,
I tomorrow night in the Little Theatre
| at 7:30 o'clock. Dr. Fisher is an au
j tliority on the Near Eastern situation,
j having been in Constantinople since
| 1913. He is Denn of Robert Colleges
; there, and an instructor in history.
The nationalist movement which
has revivified Turkey since the Arm
istice will be Dr. Fisher's field in this
| lecture. This is the movement headed
! by Mustaplia Kemal which is seeking
to make a unified nation of Turkey,
regarded before the great war as "the
sick man of Europe."
Social and economic problems will
be considered as well as the political
situation. Turkey is in the main an
| agricultural country, and her land is
i as fertile as any in the world. The
considerable mineral resources are
for the most part undeveloped, al
though this is the land from which
the fabled Croesus drew his wealth.
Dr. Fisher is a graduate of Roches
iter University, and took his graduate
! work and doctor's degree at Colum
bia. Going to Turkey shortly before
the outbreak of the war, he was in
Constantinople during the conflict,
and has since seen at first hand the
emergence of Turkey as a real politi
cal unit during the years succeeding.
He has also had a most important
share in furthering the growth and
importance of the Robert College.
