# CARDINAL FIVE TO PLAY U.S.C. TEAM TONIGHT
## Entire Squad Makes Trip to Los Angeles for Tilt With Trojans VINCENTI WILL START Victories in South Would Increase Card Chances For Pennant 
### Whitney Wright 
Fifteen determined young men,
composing the traveling unit of the
varsity basketball team, will enter
the U.S.C. Pavilion tonight anxious
for the referee's whistle to start the
first of a proposed three-game series
with the southern varsity.
Their grim determination is war
ranted by the importance of the con
test, since the defeat of U.C.L.A. at
the hands of California Friday in
creases Stanford's chances for a vic
tory in the southern section of the
Pacific Coast Conference.
Leave on Lark
The following members of the team
left on the Lark at 8:30 o'clock last
night: Berg, Biaggini, Bryant, Bow
ers, Cook. Clark. Dobson, Eliot, Olsen,
Rothert, Smalling, Stuart, Thompson,
and Vincenti.
Saturday the squad went through
a light work-out in preparation for the
Southern California games, going
over its plays once more and receiv
ing final instructions from the coach.
Friday night they witnessed the
California-TJ.C.L.A. tilt in Berkeley.
Richards Will Start
Stanford's starting line-up against
U.S.C. tonight has been announced
by Coach Husky Hunt as follows:
Smalling, center, Vincenti and Rich
ards, forwards, Thompson and Roth
ert, guards. Rothert will jump cen
ter, Smalling falling back until play
has started.
If this combination is unable to
ring up some early scores against the
Trojan five. Coach Hunt plans to shift
the forward wall around considerably.
Cook, Bowers, Berg, and Clark are
all capable of filling the forward
berths, while Bryant is a likely cen
ter if Smalling's performance is not
satisfactory.
Guards Show Ability
Dobson and Biaggini, although not
as good as Thompson and Rothert in
the defensive work, are fast on the
offensive and play well with any for
ward combination. They stand a good
chance of seeing action if the regular
forwards have trouble in penetrating
their opponents' defense.
