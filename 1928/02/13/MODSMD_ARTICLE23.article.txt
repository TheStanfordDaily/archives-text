# The
						Control of Women
## 
### 
Asurvey of the social regulations in force at thirty of the best-known
universities in the United States shows that Stanford women have a set
of the most liberal rules in the country. The University of California is
the only college where the university authorities allow two o'clock leave.
At the Southern Branch of the University of California, living - groups
are permitted to formulate their own rules, subject to the approval of the
administration, and two o'clock leave is allowable by certain living groups
for some week-end nights. The only administrative restriction is that
men callers must be out of the living group by 10:30 on .week nights and
11 :00 on week-end nights.
Closing hours for the living groups at the thirty colleges surveyed
vary from 8 o'clock to 10:30, with 10:00 o'clock proving to be the most
popular time. Oberlin College has an 8 o'clock week night deadline,
while Louisiana State and the University of Texas have the most
liberal —11 o'clock. The western colleges find the 10 o'clock rule the
most popular, 0.5.C., Colorado, Nevada, and Washington State observing
it. Idaho enforces a 9:45 lockout rule, and at U.S.C. we find it is 9:30,
while Washington provides a 10:15 limit.
The greatest diversity in the rules at most colleges exists in the dif
ference of treatment of freshman and upperclass women. At Washington
State College the freshmen lead a sheltered life, being forced to stay in
their living groups every week night after 7:30. In Montana, they are
allowed no dates on week nights, while Cornell's women's self-governing
group requires sophomore and freshman women to be in by 8 o'clock.
Seniors have more liberal privileges at most of the universities.
Stanford's "parties of less than six" phrasing has been hooted at in
the past, but Florida State College for Women requires a party of ten
for a long hike. Our new rule for parties of four on the highway after
dark, provided the women are freshmen, is exceeded by the University of
Tennessee's regulation that "no less than two couples may go boating,
driving, or dining in a public place."
Michigan's rules resemble those in force at Stanford more than the
regulations at any other college. They are identical with our old rules,
except that 12 :30 o'clock is the limit for Saturday night leave.
Smoking is permitted only at Bryn Mawr under certain conditions. In
the regulations of the other colleges, it is either ignored or prohibited.
So, after all, the Stanford women aren't as hemmed in as they might be.
