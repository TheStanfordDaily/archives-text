Among' the observations presented at the recent semi-centennial cele
bration of the Yale Daily News was the statement that the past fifty years
have witnessed a "waning belief in the validity of learning, and the
snbmergence of individualism in the American university." In that
period of time which dates back to years before Stanford University was
founded, a comparison of differences between the college of today and
that of '78 shows that there have been distinct changes in the attitude of
undergraduates toward learning in the nature of the learning desired and
in the ardor with which it is sought.
Among the alumni commentaries was Arthur Twining Hadley, '76,
president emeritus of Yale, who said that there was less organized rivalry
in his days "when the competition for honors in writing was at its height."
In those days, too, as Chief Justice William Howard Taft, '78, pointed
out, the valedictorian and the salutatorian were the campus "big men."
Those days have long since gone by ; the athlete, the committee hound,
the dramatic "star," and the peanut politician now hold the attraction.
Learning, too, is valued on the dollar and cents scale. Even the restric
tion of the Lower Division at Stanford is heralded as a "great step in
education" because it would afford more thorough training in special
fields. What would this training be for, other than to enable one to earn
more money after one leaves Stanford?
This swing toward utilitarianism applied to the colleges has not yet
reached its highest point, as is shown by the increasing number of courses
in special applied fields that are being offered. If nothing else, the Daily
Newsf semi-centennial has afforded educators something to think about
before they plan future curricula.
