(Editor's Note —Campus Opin
ion writers are hereby warned
that no communication to the edi
tor will be printed tomorrow
morning that exceeds 200 words
in length. Signatures must ac
company the communication, al
though the name will be withheld
if so desired. Furthermore, only
one communication from one
writer will be accepted! not two
or three under different noms des
plumes of the same writer. The
usual discretion of "general inter
est to the campus" will be ob
served.
The Editor, Sir:
In response to "Bud's" masterfully
expressed opinion of the Stanford co
ed, one of the "rusty jointed nymphs,
bespectacled, unshorn, and hook
laden," would like to make herself
heard. Since he has so ably expressed
himself about the "youthful intelli
gentsia," perhaps he might like to
know just how one of these looks
upon that unshorn, bespectacled, dir
ty-trousered, open-collared Son of the
Stanford Red. At least he gives the
cycle enthusiast credit for being a
member of that select group of the
intelligentsia, a class beyond the
power of appreciation of the "rough."
"Bud" is evidently quite opposed to
the idea of cycling. Perhaps this
might be attributed to the masculine
aversion to the emancipation of the
"weaker sex." It is not emancipation
we want, but exercise, and a practi
cal means of conveyance.
Speaking of "rusty steeds," what
about those "rambling wrecks of pov
erty" that nearly knock us off our
bicycles? Of course, "Bud," we can't
all be millionaires and ride in Fords.
And then it is much more satisfactory
to cycle home than to walk.
A RUSTY NYMPH.
The Editor, Sir:
Yes, it is really deplorable the rut
into which Professor Allen, the uni
versity organist, has fallen, and we
should be deeply indebted to Sturgis
Riddle and John M. Cooper for di
recting our attention to same. These
gentlemen are evidently musical crit
ics of the first water and as such
should be easily able to obtain posi
tions on the large metropolitan dai
lies. One is deeply grieved to say the
least, to learn that their 'musical ear
has been dulled and their patience
exhausted" by four consecutive
months of attending the recitals.
Compulsory recital attendance has
not been announced as yet.
False hopes were once raised in
their breasts by the rendering of
"Deep River" and Dvorak's "Largo,"
but were dispelled by the heedless
and carelessly picked programs of
Professor Allen. These gentlemen
mentioned greatly enjoying in the Pa
lace of the Legion of Honor, a pro
gram by Uda Waldrop, so if I may
be so bold, that place would afford an
excellent opportunity for hearing
one's favorite programs.
The Editor, Sir:
Now that our worthy Campus
Health Officers have been panned and
knocked from all angles, the writer
wishes to give them a word or two of
the praise that they so justly deserve
in regard to our so-called "epidemic"
of Poliomyelitis.
Every bit of advice given us has
been sound and sensible. The public
knows that everything possible has
been clone to prevent the spread of
this dreadful disease. The State
Health Officer has commended high
ly the precautions taken by our
learned physicians, and we should
feel very proud (and thankful) that
the Medical Staff is composed of such
men as Dr. Storey, Dr. Brown, and
the others who are helping to take
care of the disease.
We can look the world straight in
the face and say, Stanford is the Uni
versity "THAT KNOWS HOW" (with
apologies to the Mayor of S.F.)
—G. D. H„ '31.
The Editor, Sir:
A reply to Tuesday morning's ama
teurish musical criticism. The "under
signed STURGIS G. RIDDLE and
JOHN M. COOPER" undoubtedly had
ample reason for signing their names
in capital letters, but as I am unable
to discover their names among the
wearers of our block "S," I presume
they got theirs elsewhere.
It seems that these two very con
ceited frosh have set themselves up
as musical critics for the campus, if
not for music in general.
During my occasional visits to our
chapel, I have been enthralled by the
superb music and the artistic sur
roundings. All my friends who have
visited Stanford are unanimous in de
claring our chapel and wonderful
music their most prized recollections
of their visits.
However, these two cock-sure and
prepossessing contributors, having
nothing better to do, endeavor to con-

vince us that their taste excells that
of the majority who attend our organ
recitals, and that therefore Professor
Alien should play less classical music
and more popular tunes.
It is singularly odd that no one else
has objected to his choice of selec
tions. Professor Allen has devoted his
life to a study of music and he should
know what is proper for church. But
evidently his years of study have been
in vain, for these dear frosh have
kindly informed us that his taste is
too high-brow, to say the least.
—A Satisfied Soph.
The Editor, Sir:
The nicety with which some mem
bers of our community control them
selves so as to avoid infringing on
one last Stanford tradition brings to
mind the childish riddle: "When is a
boat not a boat?" An altogether de
sirable tradition had been established
that there shall be no smoking on
the Quad. But the effect of tobacco
seems to be to sharpen the wits of
those who aim to be nonchalant, and
they make two queries: "Am I smok
ing when merely holding a lighted
cigarette?" and "Am Ion the Quad
when standing on the edge, or sitting
on the edge with my legs hanging
over?" It is certainly evident that an
increasing number is adhering to
this ragged edge policy, especially in
the vicinity of the Law Steps. The
lawyers ought to know better, but
some of them are the kind of fellows
who will defend future Hickmans by
quibbling over technicalities, and
they are justified in smoking on the
Quad, or saying that merely standing
edge is not standing on the Quad,
on the Quad. The person who makes
such fine calculations has not become
imbued with the true Stanford spirit
and seems to me to be worse than
one who deliberately stands ON the
Quad to smoke: in the latter case
many people would think him a
stranger (or a J. C. transfer or latest
edition frosh) and forgive him for
his ignorance. A.S.F., '27.
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Murphy, in Friday's Campus
Opinion states in part, "Having taken
for granted that the men named
above (he names 6) are entitled to
their awards, why not give them to
them?"
This is a perfectly plausible con
tention. Yet the very plan he pro
poses will not give the six men their
awards, since only three will receive
awards.
Mr. Sauliere, we believe, is not
necessarily opposed to giving the men
their letters. He maintains, and we
agree with him, that changing the
number from one to three will not
relieve the situation.
Mr. Murphy's communication, in
fact, proves Mr. Sauliere's contention,
for Mr. Murphy says why shouldn't
the six men he mentions be entitled
to an award, and yet his plan pro
vides for three only. What about the
three who are left out? Would it not
be unfair for them not to be given
their awards if they are entitled to
them?
We agree with Frank that this
amendment should be voted down,
and that a more desirable plan be
presented to the students. Could not
the president of the Student Body
appoint a committee to investigate
the matter and present a plan for the
approval or rejection by the stu
dents? —1927.
The Editor, Sir:
Mike Murphy's communication rais
es the question of why shouldn't de
termination and self-improvement be
entitled to a letter. The answer is
simple. Because, according to the
present constitution, it is not deter-

initiation or self-improvement that
merits a block "S," it is actual play- 1
ing time in conference games. If one
were given a block "S" for determina-;
tion, I too would be prompted to go !
out for football. Mike mentions self-,
sacrifice as follows, "if self-sacrifice
means anything why should it not be \
entitled to a letter?" Self-sacrifice
(whatever that is in football) does
not merit a block "S" according to ;
the constitution. Allowing for the
sake of argument that self-sacrifice
should merit a block, the case he
cites could in no sense of the word
be regarded to be self-sacrifice. He
states so and so would have made a
letter IP he had not been held in
reserve. Is that self-sacrifice?
The statement is made that it is
not known who would be selected if
the plan were adopted. May I refer
the reader to the editorial of Janu
ary 24th entitled "Three Felt Let
ters," which reads in part, "Specifi
cally, because of the second clause
making this petition retroactive, this
would mean the awarding of letters
to Fleishhacker, Klabau, and Wor
den." —W.D.1,., '27.
The Editor, Sir:
