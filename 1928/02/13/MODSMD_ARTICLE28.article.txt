### 
I have never seen so nniny gooi
looking machines on the campus be
fore. Not that that promises auy
-1 thing, but a girl always has hopes I
; mean, one should notice every thing
; that goes on, because that is the way
to learn things.
Just the other day, I saw some
I students going into the cutest little
i bungalow back of Roble bridge. 1
i didn't realize that a little cottage
could be so interes.ing.
That is, 1 know that one ehould be
I able to study everything to a much
better advantage a*vay from the cam
pus, don't you? I mean, one can con
centrate to more purpose.

Of course, it must be awfully hard
to keep things goiig right. I mean, to
keep everything from goin;; wrong.
Because it really is difficult for some
yoi ie to be quiet
However, I really do think :hat it
is very nice for thn students to have
the chance to know something about
farm life. Of course, cities are lovely,
hut it helps to fret back to nature
n. wand then, if jou kno.v what I
mean.
Just imagine what fun one could
have if one had a little house back
out in the hills to study in. I'm sure
we girls would get a lot more done,
I mean scholastically. And if 1 ever
have one, I'm going to ask every one
to come and see me some time. Don't
you think parties are lovely when
they are given in the country away
from the college atmosphere and con
straint?
