# LAGUNITA'S WATER DOES NOT DAMPEN ROMANCE FOR GIRL
## 
### 
Lagunita's icy waters initiated
two canoeists late Saturday af
ternoon when the couple were
capsized near the west bank of
the big pond in the first canoe
upset of the season. The man
and woman occupants swam to
shore without difficulty. But that
is not all â€”
Two former passengers of the
ill-fated canoe had been left on
a float near the center of the
lake, and were marooned there
as a result of the accident. Oc
cupants of a second canoe that
had assisted in retrieving the
capsized boat paddled to the
rescue of the scantily clad pair
who were suffering exposure to
the cold and successfully trans
ported them to the boathouse.
"Romance is not at all damp
ened by lake water," according
to the woman in the case.
