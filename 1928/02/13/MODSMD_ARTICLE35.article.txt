# Airplane Propeller Kicks, Breaks Mechanic's Arm
## 
### 
Cecil Guttridge, head mechanic of
the Palo Alto Airport, suffered a
broken arm Saturday afternoon when
the propeller of the plane which he
was starting kicked over.
The accident was caused by some
small children playing around the
machines, who had turned on the con
tact switch. Guttridge narrowly es
caped serious injury, as he was turn
ing over the propeller for compres
sion, and not on his guard against the
motor starting.
