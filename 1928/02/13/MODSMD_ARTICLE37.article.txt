Friday's issue of the Daily con
tained a story concerning a new
psychology test that has been devised
to determine the legibility of Chinese
type. Siegen K. Chou, the deviser of
the test, states that its object is the
solution of the problem of the relative
legibility of Chinese characters as
they appear to Chinese and to for
eigners ignorant of the language. This
is only possible in the Chinese lan
guage because the symbolic pattern
and architecture of the individual
character may be viewed purely from
the artistic standpoint aside from the
meaning it conveys.
