# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Out of the ashes of the war, and
as sort of an emissary of good will,
has come Dr. Otto Peltzer, phoenix
like, to help heal the breach between
two great athletic nations. That the
Herr Dr. will be more than a threat
to our middle-distance runners at the
Amsterdam Olympics is taken for
granted. No more versatile or accom
plished foot-racer has appeared on the
sports horizon since Paavo Nurmi
swept across the Olympics at Paris
in 1924 like a modern Winged Mer
cury.
Dr. Peltzer, by his quiet manner,
fine personality, and splendid sports
manship, has done a lot to cement
the old-time friendship between Ger
many and America. Even those mem
bers of the A.E.F., who, like this
writer, appreciated the fact that the
Heinies were good runners in Octo
ber and November, 1918, will give
credit to a man who can run 500
meters in 1.03 6-10, a half mile in
1.51 3-5, 1000 meters in 2.25 4-5, and
1500 meters in 3.51. Peltzer is also
a quarter-mile hurdler, and has done
the 400-meter obstacle race in .54 4-5.
Otto Peltzer is entirely a post-war

athlete. He is about 28 years old, and
began to take his athletics seriously
eight years ago. He was Baltic cham
pion in 400 and 1500 meters in 1920.
Two years later he had broken the
German 500 meter record and won his
first national championship, doing
4.03 8-10 for 1500 meters. In 1925, his
speed increased and he beat Paulen
of Holland at 800 meters in 1.52 8-10.
Nineteen twenty-six was his big year,
the year in which he broke the
world's records for 500 meters (at
Budapest), 800 meters and half mile
(at London), and 1500 meters at Ber
lin. In the latter race he defeated
Nurmi.
They call him Otto the Bizarre in
Berlin. Maybe we'll find out why this
summer.
