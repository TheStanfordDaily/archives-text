## Asks That Scores Be Sent To Boomer; Deadline Set on March 10 
### 
First call for music and lyrics for
the Junior Opera has been announced
by Ted Duncan, musical director.
Scores are to be sent to Hal Boomer,
junior opera chairman, at the Alpha
Tau Omega house. If students want
help with their ideas, or wish to learn
more about the requirements of the
Opera, they are asked to consult
Duncan.
All types of songs are wanted, from
foxtrots and waltz numbers, to char
acter songs. Theme motifs are par
ticularly desired, ranging from the
villain's characterization on. These
songs need not be completed, or writ
ten out, and students may try them
over with an accompanist.
Lyrics are also wanted, although no
particular type can be called for until
decision is made regarding the opera
book. Lyric writers are asked to be
gin thinking up refrains, and to get
in touch with Boomer.
A tentative deadline for music has
been set for March 10, but contribu
tors are urged to get their work in
as early as possible.
Ted Duncan has had an unusual
amount of experience with this work
on the campus. He wrote the vampire
song, the overture, and the theme
song for the Opera two years ago,
"Ride a Cock Horse"; several songs
for last year's Opera, "Wicked Wil
liam"; and has composed a Stanford
football song.
A few songs have already come in,
and they promise well, says Duncan.
Larry Staley, who wrote several num
bers for the Gaieties this autumn, has
also written some good numbers. Few
lyrics have been received as yet, but
with the decision regarding the win
ner of the Opera, which will be made
toward the end of this week, this
work will progress more rapidly.
