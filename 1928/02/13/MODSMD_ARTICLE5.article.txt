# ARRIVAL OF 'FLIVVER' PLANE IN PALO ALTO SCHEDULED SATURDAY
## 
### 
The much-lieard-of and little-seen
"flivver" plane manufactured by
Henry Ford, which is to visit the
Palo Alto Airport next week, will
probably fly up from Texas next Sat
urday, according to information re
ceived by Lieutenant Norman God
dard.
Ford's latest product to put the
"Average Man" in the air is a very
small machine with one wing of full
cantilever type slung underneath the
body, and powered by a twocylinder
motor of economical running cost.
In addition to the present single
runway, a taxiing runway has been
dragged and rolled paralleling the
highway to connect the first one with
a second stretch at the other side
of the field.
