### 
Two amendments to the A.S.S.IJ.
constitution, six A.S.S.U. offices, class
offices, and tha editorship of the
Stanford Daily will be voted on at
the regular mid-year election tomor
row.
The polls will be open from 8:30
o'clock in the morning to 2 o'clock in
the afternoon. Women will vote near
the Classical Lit steps; men near
the Law Steps.
Ballots must be filled out as di
rected or they will be discarded. Each
year a large number of ballots is
destroyed because the voters have
failed to comply with the directions
given.
The following directions will ap
pear on the ballots:
(1) Do not fold your ballot.
(2) This ballot shall be void unless
marked in ink.
(3) Any mark or marks on any part
or parts of this ballot, except
the intended X, makes the
whole ballot void. If you do
make such marks, return your
ballot to the desk and obtain a
new one.
Robert Reed declined to run for
the office of member of the Men's
Council, and Paul Forknr the office
of treasurer of the class of 1928. Sev
eral nominees attempted to withdraw
Saturday but were unable due to the
fact that the ballots had already been
printed.
There are two amendments to be
voted on: one revises the circle "S"
award, the other revises the block
"S" award. Two long term members
of the Men's Council will be elected
and one short term member.
The list of candidates running for
office and offices to be filled will be
found elsewhere in this issue.
