# ELECTIONS AT ENCINA CLUB WILL CONTINUE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Voting for Encina Club officers will
lie continued Wednesday night in the
Encina Lobby from 6:45 to 7:30
o'clock because many Encina Club
members were unable to vote
Friday night due to off campus busi
ness or ignorance of the election.
One hundred and forty-six members
have voted, and these ballots will be
in the hands of Clark Cypher, head
sponsor, until after Wednesday night
when the entire number of ballots
will be counted.
Fred Hawkins and Bill Best, who
were nominated for the offices of
vice president and secretary respec
tively, have withdrawn their names
from the ballot because they are
members of the Election Committee.
Only one candidate was nominated
for each position on the House Com
mittee.
