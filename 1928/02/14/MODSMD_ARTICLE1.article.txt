# CARDS LOSE FIRST GAME TO U.S.C. BY 34-23 COUNT
## Dowl Richards, Berg Show As High-Point Men for Cardinal Five BRUNER SOUTHERN STAR Poor Shooting Contributes To Stanford Defeat; Trojans Faster 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 13.— (U.P.)—
University of Southern California
strengthened its leadership in Coast
Conference basketball, southern divi
sion, by defeating Stanford here to
night in the first of a two-game series,
34 to 23.
Superior all-around playing on the
part of the Trojans, coupled with the
inability of the Stanford players to
find the basket, decided the contest.
Featuring a close passing game, the
Trojans took a lead at the outset, and
maintained it throughout. As in ear
lier games, Captain Jack Bruner, Tro
jan skipper, was the chief man in the
attack, ol' the Southerners, He was
leading scorer with eleven points.
Jess Mortensen and Lowry McCas
lin, forwards, gave able support, how-*
ever, and together accounted for
seventeen Southern California points.
Playing on a strange court may
have thrown Stanford's players off
their game, as Louis Yincenti, star
forward, and Richards, usually lead
ers in the scoring of the Cardinals,
were able to gather only one basket
between them.
The customary second period rally
of Stanford, which carried it through
to a victory over U.C.L.A. on the last
southern invasion, also was lacking.
The score at half time was 18 to 12.
And during the first period, Southern
California maintained a varying ad
vantage of from 2 to 8 points.
Tightening of defenses of both
teams featured the playing in the
second half, with Southern California
finding its basket with more fre
quency in long shots than did Stan
ford.
Dowl Richards and "Red" Berg led
their teammates in scoring, with five
points each. Richards' total included
five free throws. Five minutes before
the game ended, Coach Leo Calland
sent in the Trojan second-string line
up, which continued to hold the Cardi
nal in check.
The Trojan pavilion proved inade
quate to house the throngs attend
ing the game; it was estimated that
more than a thousand were turned
away. About 2200 saw the contest.

attack, ol' the Southerners, He was
leading scorer with eleven points.
Jess Mortensen and Lowry McCas
lin, forwards, gave able support, how-*
ever, and together accounted for
seventeen Southern California points.
Playing on a strange court may
have thrown Stanford's players off
their game, as Louis Yincenti, star
forward, and Richards, usually lead
ers in the scoring of the Cardinals,
were able to gather only one basket
between them.
The customary second period rally
of Stanford, which carried it through
to a victory over U.C.L.A. on the last
southern invasion, also was lacking.
The score at half time was 18 to 12.
And during the first period, Southern
California maintained a varying ad
vantage of from 2 to 8 points.
Tightening of defenses of both
teams featured the playing in the
second half, with Southern California
finding its basket with more fre
quency in long shots than did Stan
ford.
Dowl Richards and "Red" Berg led
their teammates in scoring, with five
points each. Richards' total included
five free throws. Five minutes before
the game ended, Coach Leo Calland
sent in the Trojan second-string line
up, which continued to hold the Cardi
nal in check.
The Trojan pavilion proved inade
quate to house the throngs attend
ing the game; it was estimated that
more than a thousand were turned
away. About 2200 saw the contest.
