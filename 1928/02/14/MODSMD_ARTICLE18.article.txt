# PRO ARTE QUARTET WILL GIVE RECITAL OF STRING MUSIC HERE
## Ensemble of Belgian Artists Will Present Program Of Modern Works 
### 
I
A program of string music by modern
and classical composers will be presented
by the Pro Arte Quartet in the Stanford
Assembly Hall Thursday night under the
auspices of the Peninsula Musical Asso
ciation. i his will be the second program
given here this season.
The quartet is composed of four young
Belgians who have played together since
their days as fellow pupils in the Brus
sels Conservatory of Music. Temporarily
disbanded by the war, the young men re
united on their return from service and
spent three years in daily practice to
gether.
Today the ensemble holds a position in
the musical spotlight as the finest cham
ber music organization in the world. The
musicians have practiced with a view to
ward ensemble playing and have become
so proficient together that one is scarcely
conscious of four instruments producing
sound. The effect is rather that of one
great voice, so carefully are the instru
ments blended. Only one appearance was
made in San Francisco on the present
tour of the Pro Arte String Quartet.
