### 
When Stanford's baseball squad trav
els to Santa Clara Saturday to play the
initial game of the California Intercol
legiate Baseball Conference they will be
met by a determined, well-coached bunch
of Broncos. Despite the fact that gradu
ation took a heavy toll of last year's vet
erans, the Santa Clara club is fast round
ing into a fighting aggregation under the
capable tutelage of Justin Fitzgerald.
Fitz, as he is called on the Santa Clara
lot, has the ability to substitute fight for
experience in bis men. Before becoming
coach he, was a sensational outfielder of
the San Francisco Seals and the Sacra
mento Senators, and had also worn a New-
York Yankee uniform.
Santa Clara strength is found on the
mound. Guido Simoni and Johnny Casa
nova are left over from the pitching staff
which last year helped Santa Clara annex
second place in the Conference. But
Stanford is equally powerful in this de
partment and Saturday's game will de
velop into a pitchers' battle if Harry
Wolters elects to put "Count" Sobieski
in the box to offset Simoni.
Clever path work made the Broncs a
distinctive club last season. Fitzgerald
has his men watch every opportunity to
grab extra bases. In two starts with Sam
Crawford's Trojans last year the Bron
cos stole seventeen stcks.
