# HUSKIES PREPARE FOR LAST TRIP OF SEASON
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Feb. 13— (P.l.P.)—With
their championship hopes at stake,
the conference-leading University of
Washington Huskies leave here on
Thursday on their final road trip of
the season that will include hard bat
tles at Pullman, Moscow, Misscula,
and Walla Walla.
All four of these quintets were de
feated by the Huskies here, but
Coach Hec Edmundson's basketeers
will experience greater difficulty in
taming them on their own floors.
Especially are Idaho and Whitman
feared after the terrific struggles they
gave Washington earlier in the sea
son.
