# Volume 72 in Retrospect

### 
VOLUME 72 of the Stanford Daily closes with this morning's issue.
Tomorrow a new editor, elected by the student body for the first time
since 1925, will assume office and direct the policies and management of
what is perhaps one of the most powerful and important positions in
student body affairs. The difference between Volume 72 and Volume 73
will depend upon the man whom the student body chooses to have as»
editor of the Daily.
In the news column of the Daily, there has been an unusual number
of events recorded which are out of the ordinary run of things. Pertinent
to the University itself was the announcement last October of the restric
tion of entering students in the Lower Division to a 350 limit for next
year. That announcement, coming from the Board of Trustees, marked
the culmination of a great deal of discussion last year on the subject of the
junior colleges and transfers from them to Stanford. Though the wis
dom of further restrictions seems dubious at the best, the chances are
unfortunately that that course of action may be further pursued. The
chief hope of the opponents lies with those in the alumni body who hold
similar views.
More recently has come the announcement of the establishment of the
Palo Alto School of Aviation. This may in time assume great proportions
iu the University as a whole. Advances along other educational lines have
come with steady and gratifying regularity. Even Saturday classes have
some arguments in their favor.
IN STUDENT circles, one thing of importance is the present use of the
new A.S.S.U. constitution, which was drawn up last year with an eye
to "revision." llow closely the "revisers" have followed that policy and
in what points important changes were made, are matters which are now
of great concern to student office holders. The new set of By-Laws, for
mulated also with an eye to revision, has been in use now for a week. That
these rules and regulations covering student conduct which have been
brought up-to-date are not deemed immune to changes is evidenced by the
fact that there are two proposed amendments before the student body
today for acceptance or rejection. Both concern debatable questions of
athletic awards —always sensitive subjects in popular discusion
Volume 72 of the Daily recorded some months ago Stanford's leap
into commercialism of athletics via the Pittsburgh game at Pasadena. It
has recorded the opening of the new office building of the Department
of Physical Education for Men. The warranted belief that the money
used for that building could have been put in better channels will persist
in the minds of many for some time to come.
Of immediate concern to many students has been the introduction of
student control of automobiles. The Daily urged efficiency in this control
as a duty of student councils. A new set of women's regulations, passed
upon last week, was another event recorded by Volume 72.
Paramount among the events of this winter is the poliomyelitis "epi
demic" which forced a pause in many student activities for some weeks. In
addition to practically halting the basketball team's efforts, an unexpected
stop was placed on dramatic productions. The chief harm to the Uni
versity has come principally through the undesirable publicity given the
cases.
YWO changes have marked the Daily itself during the course of Vol
ume 72. One was the resumption of United Press service covering
world and national events. The other came with the efforts on the part
of the staff to secure interviews and other worth-while stories from well
known figures outside the college walls. There has also been an effort
to secure from the faculty statements on questions of national or inter
national concern.
In a sense, then, the Daily has come to regard Stanford University
as being but one of its news sources, albeit the chief one. Parallel with
this change of view is the entrance of one of Stanford's sons, Herbert
Iloover, into the field of national politics. It is safe to say that, as a con
sequence, the students as a whole are more concerned with this field than
ever before, and the Daily is now seeking to supply the students with
news of the developments in this field as in others.
During the past three years, the changes that have marked the Daily
have all been made with the plan of increasing the worth of the paper to
the students. Prom a six-column afternoon paper it has changed to a
seven-column morning paper carrying wire news. The future will un
doubtedly sec more improvements. To develop the present facilities to
their greatest extent has been the aim of the staff during the past four
months.

YWO changes have marked the Daily itself during the course of Vol
ume 72. One was the resumption of United Press service covering
world and national events. The other came with the efforts on the part
of the staff to secure interviews and other worth-while stories from well
known figures outside the college walls. There has also been an effort
to secure from the faculty statements on questions of national or inter
national concern.
In a sense, then, the Daily has come to regard Stanford University
as being but one of its news sources, albeit the chief one. Parallel with
this change of view is the entrance of one of Stanford's sons, Herbert
Iloover, into the field of national politics. It is safe to say that, as a con
sequence, the students as a whole are more concerned with this field than
ever before, and the Daily is now seeking to supply the students with
news of the developments in this field as in others.
During the past three years, the changes that have marked the Daily
have all been made with the plan of increasing the worth of the paper to
the students. Prom a six-column afternoon paper it has changed to a
seven-column morning paper carrying wire news. The future will un
doubtedly sec more improvements. To develop the present facilities to
their greatest extent has been the aim of the staff during the past four
months.
VOLUME 72 of the Stanford Daily closes with this morning's issue.
Tomorrow a new editor, elected by the student body for the first time
since 1925, will assume office and direct the policies and management of
what is perhaps one of the most powerful and important positions in
student body affairs. The difference between Volume 72 and Volume 73
will depend upon the man whom the student body chooses to have as»
editor of the Daily.
In the news column of the Daily, there has been an unusual number
of events recorded which are out of the ordinary run of things. Pertinent
to the University itself was the announcement last October of the restric
tion of entering students in the Lower Division to a 350 limit for next
year. That announcement, coming from the Board of Trustees, marked
the culmination of a great deal of discussion last year on the subject of the
junior colleges and transfers from them to Stanford. Though the wis
dom of further restrictions seems dubious at the best, the chances are
unfortunately that that course of action may be further pursued. The
chief hope of the opponents lies with those in the alumni body who hold
similar views.
More recently has come the announcement of the establishment of the
Palo Alto School of Aviation. This may in time assume great proportions
iu the University as a whole. Advances along other educational lines have
come with steady and gratifying regularity. Even Saturday classes have
some arguments in their favor.
IN STUDENT circles, one thing of importance is the present use of the
new A.S.S.U. constitution, which was drawn up last year with an eye
to "revision." llow closely the "revisers" have followed that policy and
in what points important changes were made, are matters which are now
of great concern to student office holders. The new set of By-Laws, for
mulated also with an eye to revision, has been in use now for a week. That
these rules and regulations covering student conduct which have been
brought up-to-date are not deemed immune to changes is evidenced by the
fact that there are two proposed amendments before the student body
today for acceptance or rejection. Both concern debatable questions of
athletic awards —always sensitive subjects in popular discusion
Volume 72 of the Daily recorded some months ago Stanford's leap
into commercialism of athletics via the Pittsburgh game at Pasadena. It
has recorded the opening of the new office building of the Department
of Physical Education for Men. The warranted belief that the money
used for that building could have been put in better channels will persist
in the minds of many for some time to come.
Of immediate concern to many students has been the introduction of
student control of automobiles. The Daily urged efficiency in this control
as a duty of student councils. A new set of women's regulations, passed
upon last week, was another event recorded by Volume 72.
Paramount among the events of this winter is the poliomyelitis "epi
demic" which forced a pause in many student activities for some weeks. In
addition to practically halting the basketball team's efforts, an unexpected
stop was placed on dramatic productions. The chief harm to the Uni
versity has come principally through the undesirable publicity given the

mulated also with an eye to revision, has been in use now for a week. That
these rules and regulations covering student conduct which have been
brought up-to-date are not deemed immune to changes is evidenced by the
fact that there are two proposed amendments before the student body
today for acceptance or rejection. Both concern debatable questions of
athletic awards —always sensitive subjects in popular discusion
Volume 72 of the Daily recorded some months ago Stanford's leap
into commercialism of athletics via the Pittsburgh game at Pasadena. It
has recorded the opening of the new office building of the Department
of Physical Education for Men. The warranted belief that the money
used for that building could have been put in better channels will persist
in the minds of many for some time to come.
Of immediate concern to many students has been the introduction of
student control of automobiles. The Daily urged efficiency in this control
as a duty of student councils. A new set of women's regulations, passed
upon last week, was another event recorded by Volume 72.
Paramount among the events of this winter is the poliomyelitis "epi
demic" which forced a pause in many student activities for some weeks. In
addition to practically halting the basketball team's efforts, an unexpected
stop was placed on dramatic productions. The chief harm to the Uni
versity has come principally through the undesirable publicity given the
cases.
YWO changes have marked the Daily itself during the course of Vol
ume 72. One was the resumption of United Press service covering
world and national events. The other came with the efforts on the part
of the staff to secure interviews and other worth-while stories from well
known figures outside the college walls. There has also been an effort
to secure from the faculty statements on questions of national or inter
national concern.
In a sense, then, the Daily has come to regard Stanford University
as being but one of its news sources, albeit the chief one. Parallel with
this change of view is the entrance of one of Stanford's sons, Herbert
Iloover, into the field of national politics. It is safe to say that, as a con
sequence, the students as a whole are more concerned with this field than
ever before, and the Daily is now seeking to supply the students with
news of the developments in this field as in others.
During the past three years, the changes that have marked the Daily
have all been made with the plan of increasing the worth of the paper to
the students. Prom a six-column afternoon paper it has changed to a
seven-column morning paper carrying wire news. The future will un
doubtedly sec more improvements. To develop the present facilities to
their greatest extent has been the aim of the staff during the past four
months.
