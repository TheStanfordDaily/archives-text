# COMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
An event happened this morning
which we think worthy of the atten
tion of The Stanford Daily.
On leaving the postoffice this morn
ing we were accosted by a middle
aged man in a much-used sedan. He
was plainly puzzled and beckoned as
he slowed down his car. Than, as he
opened the window he asked, "I've
just come from Palo Alto; how can I
get to Mayfleld?"
Taking him for an old grad who
had lost his way in memory of the
old days, we promptly directed him
and turned to go. But he still had
that perplexed, unsatisfied look of the
man who finds that his favorite boot
legger has been closed out. He looked
doubtfully at us and asked again,
"Say, what is this institution, any
way?"
We were much chagrined and told
him quietly, "Why, this is Stanford
University," and our spines stiffened,
just a bit.
He didn't seem a bit awed and at
tempted to justify his questioning by
replying, "I saw your sign," he point
ed upward, "The Romantic Young
Lady," "and I thought that I was per
haps in the outskirts of Los Angeles
and that this was a moving picture
studio."
Sincerely,
Charles H. Binkley.

The Editor, Sir:
Several of us have noticed that a
certain well-known football player
whose term of office on the Executive
Committee expires now, is again run
ning for another year term.
Is it not contrary to the democratic
spirit prevailing at Stanford? Are
there not other fellows equally capa
ble —not on the football team, it is
true —of holding down the job? How
about giving someone else a chancc?
Let's have some rotation Jn office —
there are other men worthy of con
sideration.

The Editor, Sir:
It is a question whether the juris
diction of the sponsors extends to the
ground in front of and around Encina
Hall. Lately, there has been a great
deal of disturbance through songs
and yelling in front of the Hall. Most
of the language used is of an obscene
sort and this fact makes the disturb
ance that much more unwanted.
It seems that the sponsors should
put an end to this sort of thing if
their jurisdiction extends to that area.
If it doesn't, some provision should
be made to stop the trouble.
Sincerely, A Fifth-Floor Man.

The Editor, Sir:
In view of the several brickbats
which we have received in the Cam
pus Opinion column of the Daily, we
take this opportunity of clearing up
a misunderstanding. We wish to make
it clear to the unknown gentlemen
whose letters appeared in the Mon
day issue that we are neither "Edi
tors of Metropolitan Dailies" nor
musical critics of the first, second,
third, or fourth water. We are merely
presuming "frosh" as the "Satisfied
Soph" condescendingly dubs us, who
dare to express an appreciation not
only of the heavier classics but of
the lighter compositions as well.
We fail to trace the connection be
tween holding a block "S" and being
a music lover, neither do we feel

worthy of being called "conceited"
and "presupposing" when we express
a sincere opinion. Furthermore, we
disclaim any responsibility for the
type used in setting up our signa
tures.
Recently, we had a personal inter
view with Professor Allen in which
he very courteously explained his
musical policy. Although it is not
fully in accord with whatever uncul
tured tastes we may possess, we bow
before "Professor Allen's lifetime de
votion to the study of music, and his
knowledge of what is proper for a
church."

The Editor, Sir:
In response to "A Rusty Nymph's"
note, I have a few words of advice to
give, and my sermon is "Be as con
siderate of others as you would have
them be of you."
It is not the emancipation of the
weaker sex that we have an adver
sion to, but rather to the way it is
obtained by our fair ones. In the
"gay nineties" when cycling was
done, a proper costume was worn and
not a flimsy knee-high dress. There
fore, I wonder if the Rusty Nymph
realizes that if the proper cycling
costume was worn that the danger
from"the rambling wrecks of pover
ty" would be greatly reduced, as then
the owners' eyes could remain on the
road unheralded by the call of "back
to nature."
—Owner of a rambling wreck.

The Editor, Sir:
After reading the two articles in
yesterday's Campus Oupinion regard
ing the new football award plan I be
lieve that a little more explanation
of the matter is necessary.
The article signed "1927" states
that the message I prepared would
take care of only three after I had
named at least six who earned their
letters. This is quite true, but, as I
stated before, there must be a fixed
number of men eligible for awards
on recommendation and that is why
three was the number on which we
decided.
The fact that a revision of the
] amendment in question allows only
i three men letters shows that it was
i drawn up to be permanent and not
J for one special occasion.
The article written by W.D.L., '27,
I claims that the reason for not award
j ing letters to the men .1 mentioned
last week was simple, and refers to
the present constitution. Well, it is
quite a simple answer all right and
tells exactly the reason for wanting
the constitution changed.
It is true that actual playing time
is what counts for a letter, but is a
second or third team man who plays
the required amount of time against
a weak conference team any more en
titled to a letter than a man who
plays half of a "tough" game, such as
the Pittsburgh game?
W.D.L., '27, claims that there was
no spirit of self-sacrifice shown when
a certain member of the squad al
lowed himself to be held in reserve;
but those of us who know the facts
of the case have a different opinion
of the matter. When a man sacrifices
his chances to play in order to bol
ster the reserve power of the team,
that is self-sacrifice as we know the
112 term in football.
The matter rests in the hands of
the students. If they feel it is plausi-

Lie to pass the amendment they will
do so, if not similar conditions prob
ably will arise in the future and the
subject will have to be brought up
again.
Sincerely, Mike Murphy, *28.

The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the article of Creagh,
'27, I would like to inform him of the
Stanford golf teams' impressive rec
ord for the last two years.
Captain Meyberg won the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate gold tournament
from a picked field of the best college
golfers on the Coast. Eddie and Doug
White placed high up in the national
intercollegiates in '27.
Larry Staley placed third in the
San Diego open from a field of the
nation's leading professionals and
amateurs, including such as Yon Elm
during the last Christmas holidays.
Both varsity and frosh teams have
defeated California the last two sea
sons with decisive victories.
Stanford was represented by 33
men last month in the Pacific Coast
intercollegiate placing 8 out of 16 in
the first flight. Our force was greater
than all other combined,
proving that great interest is being
shown.
Stanford golfers have denied them
selves certain pleasures to pay for
their golf as representatives of the
school as example, the total expense
paid by them at the Del Monte tour
nament was $1,130.20, while U.S.C.
paid $500, the expenses of a six-man
team. Also, Meybefrg, White, and
Staley paid their expenses to these
major tournaments. Doesn't the golf
squad deserve more recognition?
Stanford is the only large college in
the country that doesn't!!

The Editor, Sir:
We have been reading the several
letters in "Campus Opinion" on the
proposal to modify the present rules
for awarding letters. It appears to us
that the arguments, as presented, j
have centered around technicalities, j
and have, therefore, obscured the j
main issue.
In Tuesday's election it will be de- j
termined whether the three men in
question will be awarded the letters j
which they undoubtedly deserve, and '
whether the rules governing awards j
will be modified to prevent there- i
currence of such a circumstance.
If there is any doubt as to whether j
these men actually merit the awards, i
we would like to point out the fact
that "Pop" Warner recommended

that the awards be made, and the men
on the football squad started the pe
tition to amend the rules governing
such cases. Warner and the varsity,
due to daily association with these
men on the football field, are well
qualified to judge their merit. Some
weight, certainly, should be given to
| the fact that they have given their
hearty approval.

siderate of others as you would have
them be of you."
It is not the emancipation of the
weaker sex that we have an adver
sion to, but rather to the way it is
obtained by our fair ones. In the
"gay nineties" when cycling was
done, a proper costume was worn and
not a flimsy knee-high dress. There
fore, I wonder if the Rusty Nymph
realizes that if the proper cycling
costume was worn that the danger
from"the rambling wrecks of pover
ty" would be greatly reduced, as then
the owners' eyes could remain on the
road unheralded by the call of "back
to nature."
—Owner of a rambling wreck.

The Editor, Sir:
After reading the two articles in
yesterday's Campus Oupinion regard
ing the new football award plan I be
lieve that a little more explanation
of the matter is necessary.
The article signed "1927" states
that the message I prepared would
take care of only three after I had
named at least six who earned their
letters. This is quite true, but, as I
stated before, there must be a fixed
number of men eligible for awards
on recommendation and that is why
three was the number on which we
decided.
The fact that a revision of the
] amendment in question allows only
i three men letters shows that it was
i drawn up to be permanent and not
J for one special occasion.
The article written by W.D.L., '27,
I claims that the reason for not award
j ing letters to the men .1 mentioned
last week was simple, and refers to
the present constitution. Well, it is
quite a simple answer all right and
tells exactly the reason for wanting
the constitution changed.
It is true that actual playing time
is what counts for a letter, but is a
second or third team man who plays
the required amount of time against
a weak conference team any more en
titled to a letter than a man who
plays half of a "tough" game, such as
the Pittsburgh game?
W.D.L., '27, claims that there was
no spirit of self-sacrifice shown when
a certain member of the squad al
lowed himself to be held in reserve;
but those of us who know the facts
of the case have a different opinion
of the matter. When a man sacrifices
his chances to play in order to bol
ster the reserve power of the team,
that is self-sacrifice as we know the
112 term in football.
The matter rests in the hands of
the students. If they feel it is plausi-

Lie to pass the amendment they will
do so, if not similar conditions prob
ably will arise in the future and the
subject will have to be brought up
again.

The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the article of Creagh,
'27, I would like to inform him of the
Stanford golf teams' impressive rec
ord for the last two years.
Captain Meyberg won the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate gold tournament
from a picked field of the best college
golfers on the Coast. Eddie and Doug
White placed high up in the national
intercollegiates in '27.
Larry Staley placed third in the
San Diego open from a field of the
nation's leading professionals and
amateurs, including such as Yon Elm
during the last Christmas holidays.
Both varsity and frosh teams have
defeated California the last two sea
sons with decisive victories.
Stanford was represented by 33
men last month in the Pacific Coast
intercollegiate placing 8 out of 16 in
the first flight. Our force was greater
than all other combined,
proving that great interest is being
shown.
Stanford golfers have denied them
selves certain pleasures to pay for
their golf as representatives of the
school as example, the total expense
paid by them at the Del Monte tour
nament was $1,130.20, while U.S.C.
paid $500, the expenses of a six-man
team. Also, Meybefrg, White, and
Staley paid their expenses to these
major tournaments. Doesn't the golf
squad deserve more recognition?
Stanford is the only large college in
the country that doesn't!!

The Editor, Sir:
We have been reading the several
letters in "Campus Opinion" on the
proposal to modify the present rules
for awarding letters. It appears to us
that the arguments, as presented, j
have centered around technicalities, j
and have, therefore, obscured the j
main issue.
In Tuesday's election it will be de- j
termined whether the three men in
question will be awarded the letters j
which they undoubtedly deserve, and '
whether the rules governing awards j
will be modified to prevent there- i
currence of such a circumstance.
If there is any doubt as to whether j
these men actually merit the awards, i
we would like to point out the fact
that "Pop" Warner recommended

that the awards be made, and the men
on the football squad started the pe
tition to amend the rules governing
such cases. Warner and the varsity,
due to daily association with these
men on the football field, are well
qualified to judge their merit. Some
weight, certainly, should be given to
| the fact that they have given their
hearty approval.

The Editor, Sir:
An event happened this morning
which we think worthy of the atten
tion of The Stanford Daily.
On leaving the postoffice this morn
ing we were accosted by a middle
aged man in a much-used sedan. He
was plainly puzzled and beckoned as
he slowed down his car. Than, as he
opened the window he asked, "I've
just come from Palo Alto; how can I
get to Mayfleld?"
Taking him for an old grad who
had lost his way in memory of the
old days, we promptly directed him
and turned to go. But he still had
that perplexed, unsatisfied look of the
man who finds that his favorite boot
legger has been closed out. He looked
doubtfully at us and asked again,
"Say, what is this institution, any
way?"
We were much chagrined and told
him quietly, "Why, this is Stanford
University," and our spines stiffened,
just a bit.
He didn't seem a bit awed and at
tempted to justify his questioning by
replying, "I saw your sign," he point
ed upward, "The Romantic Young
Lady," "and I thought that I was per
haps in the outskirts of Los Angeles
and that this was a moving picture
studio."

Several of us have noticed that a
certain well-known football player
whose term of office on the Executive
Committee expires now, is again run
ning for another year term.
Is it not contrary to the democratic
spirit prevailing at Stanford? Are
there not other fellows equally capa
ble —not on the football team, it is
true —of holding down the job? How
about giving someone else a chancc?
Let's have some rotation Jn office —
there are other men worthy of con
sideration.

The Editor, Sir:
It is a question whether the juris
diction of the sponsors extends to the
ground in front of and around Encina
Hall. Lately, there has been a great
deal of disturbance through songs
and yelling in front of the Hall. Most
of the language used is of an obscene
sort and this fact makes the disturb
ance that much more unwanted.
It seems that the sponsors should
put an end to this sort of thing if
their jurisdiction extends to that area.
If it doesn't, some provision should
be made to stop the trouble.
Sincerely, A Fifth-Floor Man.

The Editor, Sir:
In view of the several brickbats
which we have received in the Cam
pus Opinion column of the Daily, we
take this opportunity of clearing up
a misunderstanding. We wish to make
it clear to the unknown gentlemen
whose letters appeared in the Mon
day issue that we are neither "Edi
tors of Metropolitan Dailies" nor
musical critics of the first, second,
third, or fourth water. We are merely
presuming "frosh" as the "Satisfied
Soph" condescendingly dubs us, who
dare to express an appreciation not
only of the heavier classics but of
the lighter compositions as well.
We fail to trace the connection be
tween holding a block "S" and being
a music lover, neither do we feel

worthy of being called "conceited"
and "presupposing" when we express
a sincere opinion. Furthermore, we
disclaim any responsibility for the
type used in setting up our signa
tures.
Recently, we had a personal inter
view with Professor Allen in which
he very courteously explained his
musical policy. Although it is not
fully in accord with whatever uncul
tured tastes we may possess, we bow
before "Professor Allen's lifetime de
votion to the study of music, and his
knowledge of what is proper for a
church."

The Editor, Sir:
We have been reading the several
letters in "Campus Opinion" on the
proposal to modify the present rules
for awarding letters. It appears to us
that the arguments, as presented, j
have centered around technicalities, j
and have, therefore, obscured the j
main issue.
In Tuesday's election it will be de- j
termined whether the three men in
question will be awarded the letters j
which they undoubtedly deserve, and '
whether the rules governing awards j
will be modified to prevent there- i
currence of such a circumstance.
If there is any doubt as to whether j
these men actually merit the awards, i
we would like to point out the fact
that "Pop" Warner recommended

that the awards be made, and the men
on the football squad started the pe
tition to amend the rules governing
such cases. Warner and the varsity,
due to daily association with these
men on the football field, are well
qualified to judge their merit. Some
weight, certainly, should be given to
| the fact that they have given their
hearty approval.

An event happened this morning
which we think worthy of the atten
tion of The Stanford Daily.
On leaving the postoffice this morn
ing we were accosted by a middle
aged man in a much-used sedan. He
was plainly puzzled and beckoned as
he slowed down his car. Than, as he
opened the window he asked, "I've
just come from Palo Alto; how can I
get to Mayfleld?"
Taking him for an old grad who
had lost his way in memory of the
old days, we promptly directed him
and turned to go. But he still had
that perplexed, unsatisfied look of the
man who finds that his favorite boot
legger has been closed out. He looked
doubtfully at us and asked again,
"Say, what is this institution, any
way?"
We were much chagrined and told
him quietly, "Why, this is Stanford
University," and our spines stiffened,
just a bit.
He didn't seem a bit awed and at
tempted to justify his questioning by
replying, "I saw your sign," he point
ed upward, "The Romantic Young
Lady," "and I thought that I was per
haps in the outskirts of Los Angeles
and that this was a moving picture
studio."

Several of us have noticed that a

Is it not contrary to the democratic

there not other fellows equally capa

about giving someone else a chancc?
Let's have some rotation Jn office —

It is a question whether the juris
diction of the sponsors extends to the
ground in front of and around Encina
Hall. Lately, there has been a great
deal of disturbance through songs
and yelling in front of the Hall. Most
of the language used is of an obscene
sort and this fact makes the disturb
ance that much more unwanted.
It seems that the sponsors should
put an end to this sort of thing if
their jurisdiction extends to that area.
If it doesn't, some provision should
be made to stop the trouble.

The Editor, Sir:
In view of the several brickbats
which we have received in the Cam
pus Opinion column of the Daily, we
take this opportunity of clearing up
a misunderstanding. We wish to make
it clear to the unknown gentlemen
whose letters appeared in the Mon
day issue that we are neither "Edi
tors of Metropolitan Dailies" nor
musical critics of the first, second,
third, or fourth water. We are merely
presuming "frosh" as the "Satisfied
Soph" condescendingly dubs us, who
dare to express an appreciation not
only of the heavier classics but of
the lighter compositions as well.
We fail to trace the connection be
tween holding a block "S" and being
a music lover, neither do we feel

worthy of being called "conceited"
and "presupposing" when we express
a sincere opinion. Furthermore, we
disclaim any responsibility for the
type used in setting up our signa
tures.
Recently, we had a personal inter
view with Professor Allen in which
he very courteously explained his
musical policy. Although it is not
fully in accord with whatever uncul
tured tastes we may possess, we bow
before "Professor Allen's lifetime de
votion to the study of music, and his
knowledge of what is proper for a
church."

The Editor, Sir:
In response to "A Rusty Nymph's"
note, I have a few words of advice to
give, and my sermon is "Be as con
siderate of others as you would have
them be of you."
It is not the emancipation of the
weaker sex that we have an adver
sion to, but rather to the way it is
obtained by our fair ones. In the
"gay nineties" when cycling was
done, a proper costume was worn and
not a flimsy knee-high dress. There
fore, I wonder if the Rusty Nymph
realizes that if the proper cycling
costume was worn that the danger
from"the rambling wrecks of pover
ty" would be greatly reduced, as then
the owners' eyes could remain on the
road unheralded by the call of "back
to nature."
—Owner of a rambling wreck.

The Editor, Sir:
After reading the two articles in
yesterday's Campus Oupinion regard
ing the new football award plan I be
lieve that a little more explanation
of the matter is necessary.
The article signed "1927" states
that the message I prepared would
take care of only three after I had
named at least six who earned their
letters. This is quite true, but, as I
stated before, there must be a fixed
number of men eligible for awards
on recommendation and that is why
three was the number on which we
decided.
The fact that a revision of the
] amendment in question allows only
i three men letters shows that it was
i drawn up to be permanent and not
J for one special occasion.
The article written by W.D.L., '27,
I claims that the reason for not award
j ing letters to the men .1 mentioned
last week was simple, and refers to
the present constitution. Well, it is
quite a simple answer all right and
tells exactly the reason for wanting
the constitution changed.
It is true that actual playing time
is what counts for a letter, but is a
second or third team man who plays
the required amount of time against
a weak conference team any more en
titled to a letter than a man who
plays half of a "tough" game, such as
the Pittsburgh game?
W.D.L., '27, claims that there was
no spirit of self-sacrifice shown when
a certain member of the squad al
lowed himself to be held in reserve;
but those of us who know the facts
of the case have a different opinion
of the matter. When a man sacrifices
his chances to play in order to bol
ster the reserve power of the team,
that is self-sacrifice as we know the
112 term in football.
The matter rests in the hands of
the students. If they feel it is plausi-

Lie to pass the amendment they will
do so, if not similar conditions prob
ably will arise in the future and the
subject will have to be brought up
again.

The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the article of Creagh,
'27, I would like to inform him of the
Stanford golf teams' impressive rec
ord for the last two years.
Captain Meyberg won the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate gold tournament
from a picked field of the best college
golfers on the Coast. Eddie and Doug
White placed high up in the national
intercollegiates in '27.
Larry Staley placed third in the
San Diego open from a field of the
nation's leading professionals and
amateurs, including such as Yon Elm
during the last Christmas holidays.
Both varsity and frosh teams have
defeated California the last two sea
sons with decisive victories.
Stanford was represented by 33
men last month in the Pacific Coast
intercollegiate placing 8 out of 16 in
the first flight. Our force was greater
than all other combined,
proving that great interest is being
shown.
Stanford golfers have denied them
selves certain pleasures to pay for
their golf as representatives of the
school as example, the total expense
paid by them at the Del Monte tour
nament was $1,130.20, while U.S.C.
paid $500, the expenses of a six-man
team. Also, Meybefrg, White, and
Staley paid their expenses to these

The Editor, Sir:
In view of the several brickbats
which we have received in the Cam
pus Opinion column of the Daily, we
take this opportunity of clearing up
a misunderstanding. We wish to make
it clear to the unknown gentlemen
whose letters appeared in the Mon
day issue that we are neither "Edi
tors of Metropolitan Dailies" nor
musical critics of the first, second,
third, or fourth water. We are merely
presuming "frosh" as the "Satisfied
Soph" condescendingly dubs us, who
dare to express an appreciation not
only of the heavier classics but of
the lighter compositions as well.
We fail to trace the connection be
tween holding a block "S" and being
a music lover, neither do we feel

worthy of being called "conceited"
and "presupposing" when we express
a sincere opinion. Furthermore, we
disclaim any responsibility for the
type used in setting up our signa
tures.
Recently, we had a personal inter
view with Professor Allen in which
he very courteously explained his
musical policy. Although it is not
fully in accord with whatever uncul
tured tastes we may possess, we bow
before "Professor Allen's lifetime de
votion to the study of music, and his
knowledge of what is proper for a
church."

The Editor, Sir:
In response to "A Rusty Nymph's"
note, I have a few words of advice to
give, and my sermon is "Be as con
siderate of others as you would have
them be of you."
It is not the emancipation of the
weaker sex that we have an adver
sion to, but rather to the way it is
obtained by our fair ones. In the
"gay nineties" when cycling was
done, a proper costume was worn and
not a flimsy knee-high dress. There
fore, I wonder if the Rusty Nymph
realizes that if the proper cycling
costume was worn that the danger
from"the rambling wrecks of pover
ty" would be greatly reduced, as then
the owners' eyes could remain on the
road unheralded by the call of "back
to nature."
—Owner of a rambling wreck.

The Editor, Sir:
After reading the two articles in
yesterday's Campus Oupinion regard
ing the new football award plan I be
lieve that a little more explanation
of the matter is necessary.
The article signed "1927" states
that the message I prepared would
take care of only three after I had
named at least six who earned their
letters. This is quite true, but, as I
stated before, there must be a fixed
number of men eligible for awards
on recommendation and that is why
three was the number on which we
decided.
The fact that a revision of the
] amendment in question allows only
i three men letters shows that it was
i drawn up to be permanent and not
J for one special occasion.
The article written by W.D.L., '27,
I claims that the reason for not award
j ing letters to the men .1 mentioned
last week was simple, and refers to
the present constitution. Well, it is
quite a simple answer all right and
tells exactly the reason for wanting
the constitution changed.
It is true that actual playing time
is what counts for a letter, but is a
second or third team man who plays
the required amount of time against
a weak conference team any more en
titled to a letter than a man who
plays half of a "tough" game, such as
the Pittsburgh game?
W.D.L., '27, claims that there was
no spirit of self-sacrifice shown when
a certain member of the squad al
lowed himself to be held in reserve;
but those of us who know the facts
of the case have a different opinion
of the matter. When a man sacrifices
his chances to play in order to bol
ster the reserve power of the team,
that is self-sacrifice as we know the
112 term in football.
The matter rests in the hands of
the students. If they feel it is plausi-

Lie to pass the amendment they will
do so, if not similar conditions prob
ably will arise in the future and the
subject will have to be brought up
again.

The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the article of Creagh,
'27, I would like to inform him of the
Stanford golf teams' impressive rec
ord for the last two years.
Captain Meyberg won the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate gold tournament
from a picked field of the best college
golfers on the Coast. Eddie and Doug
White placed high up in the national
intercollegiates in '27.
Larry Staley placed third in the
San Diego open from a field of the
nation's leading professionals and
amateurs, including such as Yon Elm
during the last Christmas holidays.
Both varsity and frosh teams have
defeated California the last two sea
sons with decisive victories.
Stanford was represented by 33
men last month in the Pacific Coast
intercollegiate placing 8 out of 16 in
the first flight. Our force was greater
than all other combined,
proving that great interest is being
shown.
Stanford golfers have denied them
selves certain pleasures to pay for
their golf as representatives of the
school as example, the total expense
paid by them at the Del Monte tour
nament was $1,130.20, while U.S.C.
paid $500, the expenses of a six-man
team. Also, Meybefrg, White, and
Staley paid their expenses to these
major tournaments. Doesn't the golf
squad deserve more recognition?
Stanford is the only large college in
the country that doesn't!!

The Editor, Sir:
We have been reading the several
letters in "Campus Opinion" on the
proposal to modify the present rules
for awarding letters. It appears to us
that the arguments, as presented, j
have centered around technicalities, j
and have, therefore, obscured the j
main issue.
In Tuesday's election it will be de- j
termined whether the three men in
question will be awarded the letters j
which they undoubtedly deserve, and '
whether the rules governing awards j
will be modified to prevent there- i
currence of such a circumstance.
If there is any doubt as to whether j
these men actually merit the awards, i
we would like to point out the fact
that "Pop" Warner recommended

that the awards be made, and the men
on the football squad started the pe
tition to amend the rules governing
such cases. Warner and the varsity,
due to daily association with these
men on the football field, are well
qualified to judge their merit. Some
weight, certainly, should be given to
| the fact that they have given their
hearty approval.

The Editor, Sir:
An event happened this morning
which we think worthy of the atten
tion of The Stanford Daily.
On leaving the postoffice this morn
ing we were accosted by a middle
aged man in a much-used sedan. He
was plainly puzzled and beckoned as
he slowed down his car. Than, as he
opened the window he asked, "I've
just come from Palo Alto; how can I
get to Mayfleld?"
Taking him for an old grad who
had lost his way in memory of the
old days, we promptly directed him
and turned to go. But he still had
that perplexed, unsatisfied look of the
man who finds that his favorite boot
legger has been closed out. He looked
doubtfully at us and asked again,
"Say, what is this institution, any
way?"
We were much chagrined and told
him quietly, "Why, this is Stanford
University," and our spines stiffened,
just a bit.
He didn't seem a bit awed and at
tempted to justify his questioning by
replying, "I saw your sign," he point
ed upward, "The Romantic Young
Lady," "and I thought that I was per
haps in the outskirts of Los Angeles
and that this was a moving picture
studio."

Is it not contrary to the democratic

It is a question whether the juris
diction of the sponsors extends to the
ground in front of and around Encina
Hall. Lately, there has been a great
deal of disturbance through songs
and yelling in front of the Hall. Most
of the language used is of an obscene
sort and this fact makes the disturb
ance that much more unwanted.
It seems that the sponsors should
put an end to this sort of thing if
their jurisdiction extends to that area.
If it doesn't, some provision should
be made to stop the trouble.

The Editor, Sir:
In reply to the article of Creagh,
'27, I would like to inform him of the
Stanford golf teams' impressive rec
ord for the last two years.
Captain Meyberg won the Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate gold tournament
from a picked field of the best college
golfers on the Coast. Eddie and Doug
White placed high up in the national
intercollegiates in '27.
Larry Staley placed third in the
San Diego open from a field of the
nation's leading professionals and
amateurs, including such as Yon Elm
during the last Christmas holidays.
Both varsity and frosh teams have
defeated California the last two sea
sons with decisive victories.
Stanford was represented by 33
men last month in the Pacific Coast
intercollegiate placing 8 out of 16 in
the first flight. Our force was greater
than all other combined,
proving that great interest is being
shown.
Stanford golfers have denied them
selves certain pleasures to pay for
their golf as representatives of the
school as example, the total expense
paid by them at the Del Monte tour
nament was $1,130.20, while U.S.C.
paid $500, the expenses of a six-man
team. Also, Meybefrg, White, and
Staley paid their expenses to these
major tournaments. Doesn't the golf
squad deserve more recognition?
Stanford is the only large college in
the country that doesn't!!

The Editor, Sir:
We have been reading the several
letters in "Campus Opinion" on the
proposal to modify the present rules
for awarding letters. It appears to us
that the arguments, as presented, j
have centered around technicalities, j
and have, therefore, obscured the j
main issue.
In Tuesday's election it will be de- j
termined whether the three men in
question will be awarded the letters j
which they undoubtedly deserve, and '
whether the rules governing awards j
will be modified to prevent there- i
currence of such a circumstance.
If there is any doubt as to whether j
these men actually merit the awards, i
we would like to point out the fact
that "Pop" Warner recommended

that the awards be made, and the men
on the football squad started the pe
tition to amend the rules governing
such cases. Warner and the varsity,
due to daily association with these
men on the football field, are well
qualified to judge their merit. Some
weight, certainly, should be given to
| the fact that they have given their
hearty approval.

The Editor, Sir:
An event happened this morning
which we think worthy of the atten
tion of The Stanford Daily.
On leaving the postoffice this morn
ing we were accosted by a middle
aged man in a much-used sedan. He
was plainly puzzled and beckoned as
he slowed down his car. Than, as he
opened the window he asked, "I've
just come from Palo Alto; how can I
get to Mayfleld?"
Taking him for an old grad who
had lost his way in memory of the
old days, we promptly directed him
and turned to go. But he still had
that perplexed, unsatisfied look of the
man who finds that his favorite boot
legger has been closed out. He looked
doubtfully at us and asked again,
"Say, what is this institution, any
way?"
We were much chagrined and told
him quietly, "Why, this is Stanford
University," and our spines stiffened,
just a bit.
He didn't seem a bit awed and at
tempted to justify his questioning by
replying, "I saw your sign," he point
ed upward, "The Romantic Young
Lady," "and I thought that I was per
haps in the outskirts of Los Angeles
and that this was a moving picture
studio."
Sincerely,
Charles H. Binkley.

Several of us have noticed that a
certain well-known football player
whose term of office on the Executive
Committee expires now, is again run
ning for another year term.
Is it not contrary to the democratic
spirit prevailing at Stanford? Are
there not other fellows equally capa
ble —not on the football team, it is
true —of holding down the job? How
about giving someone else a chancc?
Let's have some rotation Jn office —
there are other men worthy of con
sideration.

The Editor, Sir:
It is a question whether the juris
diction of the sponsors extends to the
ground in front of and around Encina
Hall. Lately, there has been a great
deal of disturbance through songs
and yelling in front of the Hall. Most
of the language used is of an obscene
sort and this fact makes the disturb
ance that much more unwanted.
It seems that the sponsors should
put an end to this sort of thing if
their jurisdiction extends to that area.
If it doesn't, some provision should
be made to stop the trouble.
Sincerely, A Fifth-Floor Man.

The Editor, Sir:
In view of the several brickbats
which we have received in the Cam
pus Opinion column of the Daily, we
take this opportunity of clearing up
a misunderstanding. We wish to make
it clear to the unknown gentlemen
whose letters appeared in the Mon
day issue that we are neither "Edi
tors of Metropolitan Dailies" nor
musical critics of the first, second,
third, or fourth water. We are merely
presuming "frosh" as the "Satisfied
Soph" condescendingly dubs us, who
dare to express an appreciation not
only of the heavier classics but of
the lighter compositions as well.
We fail to trace the connection be
tween holding a block "S" and being
a music lover, neither do we feel

worthy of being called "conceited"
and "presupposing" when we express
a sincere opinion. Furthermore, we
disclaim any responsibility for the
type used in setting up our signa
tures.
Recently, we had a personal inter
view with Professor Allen in which
he very courteously explained his
musical policy. Although it is not
fully in accord with whatever uncul
tured tastes we may possess, we bow
before "Professor Allen's lifetime de
votion to the study of music, and his
knowledge of what is proper for a
church."

The Editor, Sir:
In response to "A Rusty Nymph's"
note, I have a few words of advice to
give, and my sermon is "Be as con
siderate of others as you would have
them be of you."
It is not the emancipation of the
weaker sex that we have an adver
sion to, but rather to the way it is
obtained by our fair ones. In the
"gay nineties" when cycling was
done, a proper costume was worn and
not a flimsy knee-high dress. There
fore, I wonder if the Rusty Nymph
realizes that if the proper cycling
costume was worn that the danger
from"the rambling wrecks of pover
ty" would be greatly reduced, as then
the owners' eyes could remain on the
road unheralded by the call of "back
to nature."
—Owner of a rambling wreck.

The Editor, Sir:
After reading the two articles in
yesterday's Campus Oupinion regard
ing the new football award plan I be
lieve that a little more explanation
of the matter is necessary.
The article signed "1927" states
that the message I prepared would
take care of only three after I had
named at least six who earned their
letters. This is quite true, but, as I
stated before, there must be a fixed
number of men eligible for awards
on recommendation and that is why
three was the number on which we
decided.
The fact that a revision of the
] amendment in question allows only
i three men letters shows that it was
i drawn up to be permanent and not
J for one special occasion.
The article written by W.D.L., '27,
I claims that the reason for not award
j ing letters to the men .1 mentioned
last week was simple, and refers to
the present constitution. Well, it is
quite a simple answer all right and
tells exactly the reason for wanting
the constitution changed.
It is true that actual playing time
is what counts for a letter, but is a
second or third team man who plays
the required amount of time against
a weak conference team any more en
titled to a letter than a man who
plays half of a "tough" game, such as
the Pittsburgh game?
W.D.L., '27, claims that there was
no spirit of self-sacrifice shown when
a certain member of the squad al
lowed himself to be held in reserve;
but those of us who know the facts
of the case have a different opinion
of the matter. When a man sacrifices
his chances to play in order to bol
ster the reserve power of the team,
that is self-sacrifice as we know the
112 term in football.
The matter rests in the hands of
the students. If they feel it is plausi-

Lie to pass the amendment they will
do so, if not similar conditions prob
ably will arise in the future and the
subject will have to be brought up
again.
