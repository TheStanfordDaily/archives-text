# SPORTS OF 1928

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"Happy Valentines's Greetings, my
dear Gawge! Let me geeve you this
hand embroidered sock on the jaw
as token of my affection." Thanks,"
Mistah Paulino. And heah am a lil*
gift fo' you all. A purty lace-covered
punch on the nose, and ah hopes you
you likes it."
Thus do two warriors of the ring
exchange the merry compliments of
the season, seeming to forget that St.
Valentine himself had a heart. I fear
'twill be no lovefest when Paulino
Uzcudun, the woodchopper of the
Pyrenees, swaps hooks and upper
cuts with George Godfrey, the Black
Shadow of Lieperville, in their much
advertised bout in Los Angeles. . It
seems that the good natives out there
are having a little elimination tour
nament all of their own, using what
has been given the gate by Tex

j Rickard as material. Perhaps (and
j why not?) the winner of this fero
cious brawl will meet long Knute
Hanson, who, like Yon Cassius
(another Scandinavian, no doubt)
j has a clean and hungry look.
But to get back to Uzzie and
George. Paulino is the most colorful
fighter to be seen in America since
Luis Firpo's day. Since coming to
these United States, the Bounding
Basque has won five fights, three of
them by knock-outs, has fought one
draw, and lost two bouts, one on
an invisible foul. George Godfrey
showed himself to be a much im
proved fighter in 1927, winning some
i thing like a dozen fights by knock
outs. Numbered among his oppon
ents were Jimmy Maloney aiid Monte
I Munn. Yet Godfrey is fast and a
! smooth boxer. Personally, I think
' it looks bad for the Basque.


White vs. Black
