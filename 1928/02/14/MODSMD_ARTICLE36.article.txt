## 
### 
"There are forces ceaselessly work
ing today to shackle again the human
race to the superstitions of the Mid
dle Ages," said Dr. Edgar L. Gilcreest
of the Union of California Medical
Schools in a lecture Friday night at
Lane Hall, Stanford Medical School,
in San Francisco.
Dr. Gilcreest declared that many
persons are now confused by contra
dictory claims of various religious
and cult healers against the state
ments of college-trained physicians
regarding disease and its cure.
