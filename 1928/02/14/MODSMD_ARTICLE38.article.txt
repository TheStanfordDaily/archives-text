HARVARD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 13.—
(I.P.) —American college students be
gin active life work entirely too late,
believes Dr. A. Lawrence Lowell,
president of Harvard University.
"American secondary schools," he
declared in his annual report to Har
vard board of overseers, "do not com
plete the secondary teaching that
ought to be done at the age our young
men come to college. The result is
that with the preparation now re
quired for professional and business
life —much longer than it was former
ly —the young man does not begin
his active career until a later age
than is wise.
"An artisan at the age of 20 may
be earning as large an income, and
be as well able to support a family,
as he ever will be; but his contem
porary who is looking forward to the
bar or to medicine, for example, is
only half way through college at the
time. The ordinary age of entering
an American college is over 18, so
that if the young man completes his
four years before beginning his pro
fessional studies, he is over 22 at
graduation."
President Lowell does not believe
that sending a boy to college at the
age of 17 places him at a disadvan
tage socially and athletically. He says
to wait a year after high school
graduation before entering college is
a mistake.
