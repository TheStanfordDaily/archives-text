## 
### 
« WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. 13. —
| (U.P.) —The Senate fight to investigate
public utilities throughout the country
opened today with two unexpected devel
opments.
: First, Senator Walsh of Massachusetts,
who is urging the inquiry, struck at the
power lobby which is here trying to pre
] vent the Senate from investigating. He
j proposed an amendment to the Senate
I rules to require all lobbyists to register
iwith the secertary of the Senate and name
■ their employers and the legislation they
are interested in. Walsh does not question
the right of interests to hire lobbyists.
All he seeks is to bring them out into the
j open so that their connections will be
| public. He charges that the most power
! ful lobby in many years is at work here
: to prevent the Senate from investigating
the power industry. He will attempt to
.have his proposal to register lobbyists
considered tomorrow.
Dawes Embarrassed
Second, Vice-President Dawes, who
! would be directed to appoint an investi
gating committee of live senators should
: the Walsh resolution be adopted, an
j nounced that should this resolution be
j approved lie would decline to appoint the
, committee because he is interested in cer
| tain public utilities which would be in
| vestigated.
These two developments give some hint
|of the intensity of this fight over the
I public utility industry. The Senate was in
a serious mood as debate on the proposal
; began today. Senators were not indulging
in their usual pleasantries.
Faces wore a worried look, for the pub->
lie utility industry is mobilized full |
strength to block this investigation. Its j
| power reaches down into the local elec-!
:trie light plants in the smallest cities. The!
j senators saw startling evidence of the!
j power of the public utility kings in the i
j recent cage of Frank L. Smith of Illinois j
who, while chairman of the Illinois Pub-|
, lie Utility Commission, received more J
'than $200,000 from Samuel Insull for his'
| senatorial campaign.
