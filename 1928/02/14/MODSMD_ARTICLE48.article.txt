The worst thing in the world to try]
to find is a good pipe tobacco that is,
well within the reach of everybody,!
and at the same time does not taste]
like it had just come out of the cabbage]
patch. d
I have been smoking a pipe for two
years and have just this month started
to smoke a real smoke, Edgeworth. If
at first you don't succeed, try, try
again. Believe me, I tried for two years,
but finally success is more than mine.
I have just been looking around,
and have found to my delight that I
can get Edgeworth practically any
where. I even found it out at the lake
near Dallas where I go fishing. Oh boy,
what a combination—a perfect day, a
can of good tobacco, and your pipe.
I always thought these ad letters
were the bunk, but this time I know
somebody is wrong and that is me.
