"Hail! Hail!
The Gang's All
Here!"
Whether it is a football game or an exam
knocked for a loop, there is always some joyous
occasion for "Canada Dry." Then whoop her
up with a light-fingered jazz-artist on the ukulele
and "Hail, Hail! The Gang's All Here!" in
close harmony.
"Canada Dry" has a delightful flavor . . . tang
to it . . . dryness . . . sparkle. It contains no
capsicum (red pepper). And because it contains
only pure Jamaica ginger to give it that mild, subtle *
taste, it blends well with other beverages.
