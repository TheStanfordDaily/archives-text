# TURKEY WANTS TO BE WESTERN POWER IN ASIA
## Change in Relationship of East, West Foreseen, Dr. Fisher Says KEMALISTS LEAD MOVE Polygamy And Other Eastern Customs Dropped as Advance Made 
### 
"Turkey wants to be a western power
in Asia, not an Asiatic power in Europe.
If she can accomplish this it may change
the relationship between the East and the
West."
This is Turkey's attitude in attempting
to establish herself under the Kcmalist
regime, says Dr. Edgar J. Fisher, visiting
professor of history from Constantinople,
who spoke last night in the Little The
atre.

"Turkey has not a responsible consti
tutional form of government in the west
ern sense of the ternr; but the fuller lib
erties of such a regime must come.
Led by the Kcmalist nationalists, the
new Turkey is initiating reforms and
imitating western progress, says Dr. Fish
er. Since the war the state is much more
homogeneous and is becoming more and
more unified.
Polygamy Abolished
Polygamy has been abolished, women
are allowed to appear on the street with
out veils, and the fez, characteristic head
gear for so long, has been abandoned as
a symbol of Turkey's separation from the
West.
Dr. Fisher scored the "holier than
thou" attitude of the United States to
ward Turkey in refusing treaty relations
with the Kemalist government. We are
very ungenerous in such a stand, he be
lieves.
