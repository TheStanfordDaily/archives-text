insufficiency of the ballots for the class positions. Only two elections resulted
in yesterday's voting: George Ellsworth to the position of treasurer of the
senior class, and Norman McLeod to the presidency of the freshman class.
The vote for Amendment Number 1 was 9GI in favor and 217 against; for

the necessary two-thirds for adoption.

cast: 1012 men, 274 women voting.
