# CAST HAS PROFITED IN POSTPONEMENT OF PLAY, STATES PRICE
## 
### 
"The postponement of the 'Roman- I
tic Young Lady' has been of profit !
rather than a disadvantage," Miss |
Anna May Price said yesterday."The j
added time gave us a greater oppor- j
tunity to work on small details with !
individual members of the cast than
the original date did."
"The Romantic Young Lady" is of
simple light plot and depends more j
for the appeal of the dialogue and the j
characters than upon a complex !
theme. The contrast of feminine'
psychology is one of the points of ;
interest with this comedy. Rosario,'
played by Kathleen Fitz, is a roman- j
tic young soul who is very anxious
to be a wage-earner, and do as she !
wishes. She is envious of the free
dom enjoyed by her brothers, and!
believes she could have more power j
if she were "independent." This is
contrasted by the philosophy of Dona
Barbarlta, played by Janet Harris,
who believes a woman who knows
how to faint at the proper moment
lias more power than five salaried j
women.
Rosario is more of an ingenue part ;
than Kathleen Fitz has appeared in
here before, and should prove an in- j
teresting contrast to her previous j
work. The part is a rather difficult i
one, and the combination of charac
teristics requires subtle distinctions.
Seat sale for this play, which will j
be given on February 24, will be held !
tomorrow at 1 o'clock, outside thej
Union. Tickets may also be secured j
at Crandall's Bookstore, in Palo Alto. ;
at this time.
