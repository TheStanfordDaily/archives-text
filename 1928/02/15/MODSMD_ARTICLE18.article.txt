## 
### 
Individual stars mean little in mak
ing a successful business, according
to Miss Mary Ennis, of the City of
Paris Dry Goods Company, in San
Francisco, who lectured before the
Graduate School of Business yester
day. She compared a business firm
to a football team, pointing out that
it is the person who co-operates,
rather than the person who tries to
shine, that means most in the long
run. "If you can be so much a part
of the business that you are the busi
ness itself, you are a success," she
said.
Miss Ennis emphasized the human
appeal in business. "I don't think a
dollar means anything in business, or
in sales promotion. If you have the
thing the people want, they will pay
the price."
