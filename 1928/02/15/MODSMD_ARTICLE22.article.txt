# Court Procedure
## 
### 
Hamlet must have had American criminal procedure in mind when he
discouragingly remarked, "There's the respect that makes calamity of
so long life, . . . for who would bear . . . the oppressor's wrong . . . the
law's delay . .
With less bitterness, perhaps, but with equal keenness and sincerity, we
all feel the present-day curse of "the law's delay." We are moved to the
realization that there is something organically wrong with our attitude
toward the criminal population, and with the administration of justice in
dealing with it. We are conscious of the fact that there does exist a better
and more efficient method of legal procedure in the criminal trials, but as
yet we have not achieved it.
We think of England as having a procedural system far superior to
ours. It has. The truth of this is apparent when we consider that the
American Bar Association has made a thorough survey of English pro
cedural methods, and several legislative changes, based on these reports,
have been made in this country.
However, we have a long way to go before we approach the efficiency
which exists in England. Pointing our path are certain noteworthy fea
tures practiced there:
1. The appointive system of selecting judges. By this method members
of the bench are free from political influence, and only the BEST of legal
talent is secured. An adequate salary makes the position worth while for
the competent barrister.
2. Direction and control of, as well as participation in, the trial by the
judge. He is not a mere referee for verbal battles, but he sees that cumber
some details and technicalities are waived in favor of a clear-cut determina
tion of the issues of the case, and justice is not fettered by subterfuges and
delays.
3. Definite procedure with specific and certain penalties. Death is the
reward for the sane murderer. Those criminally insane are confined in
definitely. The "cat-o'-nine-tails" is the retribution held out for those who
commit robbery with violence.
The trial is speedy and denite. Appeals for delay are not TOLER
ATED. Other appeals are granted only when real grounds are shown.
As a result, the number of appeals taken is small, while in the United States
nearly one-third of the cases tried are appealed.
4. Punishment is given less frequently than in America, but it is more
severe. The shorter prison terms are marked with the strictest of disci
pline, and the penal institutions are not rest houses for the delinquent.
The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals is final. If the holding
of the lower court is reversed, the one previously convicted is released.
However, if the appeal is allowd favorably for the defendant it usually
results in a modification of the sentence, rather than an acquittal.
5. Thoroughness, but BREVITY, in the trial. Many murder cases are
seen to completion within six weeks after the time the crime has been
committed. Thus, the murderous criminal knows in advance that his trial
and punishment are certain, and the gallows is not far from the courtroom.
Finally, the rules and procedure followed in England are old and well
established. Herein lies the ultimate solution of the problem of efficient
administration of criminal justice in the United States.
It is to be granted that progress is the result of time and conscientious
effort, and so it is futile to expect radical and immediate changes in our
present system. We must realize that English rules antedate ours by
several hundred years. It is reasonable to expect that time and thought
will elevate OUR procedure and administration of law to a height it does
not NOW enjoy.

The trial is speedy and denite. Appeals for delay are not TOLER
ATED. Other appeals are granted only when real grounds are shown.
As a result, the number of appeals taken is small, while in the United States
nearly one-third of the cases tried are appealed.
4. Punishment is given less frequently than in America, but it is more
severe. The shorter prison terms are marked with the strictest of disci
pline, and the penal institutions are not rest houses for the delinquent.
The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals is final. If the holding
of the lower court is reversed, the one previously convicted is released.
However, if the appeal is allowd favorably for the defendant it usually
results in a modification of the sentence, rather than an acquittal.
5. Thoroughness, but BREVITY, in the trial. Many murder cases are
seen to completion within six weeks after the time the crime has been
committed. Thus, the murderous criminal knows in advance that his trial
and punishment are certain, and the gallows is not far from the courtroom.
Finally, the rules and procedure followed in England are old and well
established. Herein lies the ultimate solution of the problem of efficient
administration of criminal justice in the United States.
It is to be granted that progress is the result of time and conscientious
effort, and so it is futile to expect radical and immediate changes in our
present system. We must realize that English rules antedate ours by
several hundred years. It is reasonable to expect that time and thought
will elevate OUR procedure and administration of law to a height it does
not NOW enjoy.
Hamlet must have had American criminal procedure in mind when he
discouragingly remarked, "There's the respect that makes calamity of
so long life, . . . for who would bear . . . the oppressor's wrong . . . the
law's delay . .
With less bitterness, perhaps, but with equal keenness and sincerity, we
all feel the present-day curse of "the law's delay." We are moved to the
realization that there is something organically wrong with our attitude
toward the criminal population, and with the administration of justice in
dealing with it. We are conscious of the fact that there does exist a better
and more efficient method of legal procedure in the criminal trials, but as
yet we have not achieved it.
We think of England as having a procedural system far superior to
ours. It has. The truth of this is apparent when we consider that the
American Bar Association has made a thorough survey of English pro
cedural methods, and several legislative changes, based on these reports,
have been made in this country.
However, we have a long way to go before we approach the efficiency
which exists in England. Pointing our path are certain noteworthy fea
tures practiced there:
1. The appointive system of selecting judges. By this method members
of the bench are free from political influence, and only the BEST of legal
talent is secured. An adequate salary makes the position worth while for
the competent barrister.
2. Direction and control of, as well as participation in, the trial by the
judge. He is not a mere referee for verbal battles, but he sees that cumber
some details and technicalities are waived in favor of a clear-cut determina
tion of the issues of the case, and justice is not fettered by subterfuges and
delays.
3. Definite procedure with specific and certain penalties. Death is the
reward for the sane murderer. Those criminally insane are confined in
definitely. The "cat-o'-nine-tails" is the retribution held out for those who
commit robbery with violence.
