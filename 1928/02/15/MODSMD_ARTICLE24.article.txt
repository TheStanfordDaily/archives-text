The Editor, Sir:
Permit me to make a few remarks
«
regarding the letter which appeared
last Monday morning in answer to
one previously written by Sturgis G.
Riddle and John M. Cooper. "A Satis
fied Soph" has attempted to defend
Professor Allen, but the means he
has used are very strange. At least
one-half his letter is devoted to an
attack upon the personalities of the
two above-mentioned students. He
calls them conceited, cock-sure, and
prepossessing. It is surprising that
one possessing the intelligence which
we have learned to expect in a Stan
ford student should resort to methods
so juvenile. It is even more surpris
ing that such a letter should be al
lowed to get into print. The present
writer has only a very casual ac
quaintance with one of the critics of
Professor Allen, and so it is not for

I personal reasons that he deplores the
! l'act that a student may no longer ex
-1 press an honest opinion in our school
j paper without being subjected to a
vehement attack.
In spite of the fact that Professor
i Allen has devoted his life to the
| study of music and"A Satisphied
j Soph" and his friends have been "en
thralled" by his playing, only a very
! small percentage of the students at
! tend the recitals. One of two alterna
! tives is true: either the majority of
j the students of this University have
bad taste or no taste at all for music,
|or else there is something wrong
I with Professor Allen's recitals. Can
; it be possible that Stanford students
have no idea of what constitutes
good music or no appreciation for
good music when they hear it? Per
haps students are just too lazy to
walk to the chapel, but I doubt it.
