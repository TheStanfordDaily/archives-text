### Vern Cordry 
Following an ancient custom of this
column in appearing one day late on
all news we will now reminisce about
St. Valentine's Day. Do you remember
1. The fancy Valentine box on
teacher's desk?
2. The two elegant five-cent Valen
tines —one for teacher, the other tor
the flaxen-curled nine-year-old heart
breaker across the aisle?
3. The handful of two-for-a-cent
kind for your friends, and the un
signed comic for your rival for the
aforementioned blonde type?
4. Checking up to see who sent you
Valentines in order that you can re
member or forget them next year?
5. Getting them from people you
didn't send any to —and feeling rather
warm sitting there in the same room?
—and that's enough reminiscing for
one day.

A prof gave a Valentine
In a mid-term to me.
I expected to flunk
But got a low "C."
* * *
SCOTCH VALENTINES
"Roses are red,
Violets are blue."
A pair of shears
And a pot of glue. •
Old Valentines patched,
The writing efaced —
And a new name written
Where the old one's erased.
* * *
Archie got in bad with one of liis
many loves about this time last year.

Here's the little "gate invitation" that
he received —
Rebuff.
I get your meaning!
I read between the lines.
Here's all your love notes—
A pack of Valentines.
See why I hate you?
Your every word is drool.
Weak-spined, mushy slush,
Written by a fool!
"And so I didn't enjoy Valentine's
Day that year," remarked Archie as
he showed me this hymn of hate.
* * *
ANOTHER'S VALENTINE
I never dreamed you had a lover
Who had claimed you for his own,
But I was able to discover
That you had a heart of stone.
Your smiling lips were most appealing
As they made gay repartee,
And led me 011 without revealing
How you planned to two-time me.
You knew you'd leave me broken
hearted
As you pattered off your line,
But you preferred to be hard-hearted
And another's Valentine. —N.S.
* * *
"Tiger Woman,"
Lamp the lines above.
A soft reply, you see,
Marks truest love. —Emma.

I read between the lines.
Here's all your love notes—
A pack of Valentines.
See why I hate you?
Your every word is drool.
Weak-spined, mushy slush,
Written by a fool!
"And so I didn't enjoy Valentine's
Day that year," remarked Archie as
he showed me this hymn of hate.

ANOTHER'S VALENTINE
I never dreamed you had a lover
Who had claimed you for his own,
But I was able to discover
That you had a heart of stone.
Your smiling lips were most appealing
As they made gay repartee,
And led me 011 without revealing
How you planned to two-time me.
You knew you'd leave me broken
hearted
As you pattered off your line,
But you preferred to be hard-hearted
And another's Valentine. —N.S.

"Tiger Woman,"
Lamp the lines above.
A soft reply, you see,
Marks truest love. —Emma.
Following an ancient custom of this
column in appearing one day late on
all news we will now reminisce about
St. Valentine's Day. Do you remember
1. The fancy Valentine box on
teacher's desk?
2. The two elegant five-cent Valen
tines —one for teacher, the other tor
the flaxen-curled nine-year-old heart
breaker across the aisle?
3. The handful of two-for-a-cent
kind for your friends, and the un
signed comic for your rival for the
aforementioned blonde type?
4. Checking up to see who sent you
Valentines in order that you can re
member or forget them next year?
5. Getting them from people you
didn't send any to —and feeling rather
warm sitting there in the same room?
—and that's enough reminiscing for
one day.

A prof gave a Valentine
In a mid-term to me.
I expected to flunk
But got a low "C."
* * *
SCOTCH VALENTINES
"Roses are red,
Violets are blue."
A pair of shears
And a pot of glue. •
Old Valentines patched,
The writing efaced —
And a new name written
Where the old one's erased.

Archie got in bad with one of liis
many loves about this time last year.

Here's the little "gate invitation" that
he received —
Rebuff.
I get your meaning!
I read between the lines.
