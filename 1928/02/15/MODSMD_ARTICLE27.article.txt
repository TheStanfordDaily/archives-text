NATIONAL TENNIS RENOWN
Stanford tennis players again win
national recognition. In the first ten
rankings released two Cardinal ath
letes held places. Cranston Holman,
graduate medical student, captain of
the 1927 varsity, received tenth posi
tion; John Doeg, freshman player,
rated eighth.
There was a time when tennis
at the University was poor. Then
came Phil Neer and James Davies
about seven years ago to build
for the present great teams. Neer
won the intercollegiate singles,
and paired with Davies to cop the
doubles. It was at this time that
tennis became a major sport.
Following these two came Cran
ston Holman who in one and the
same year took the national
junior championship and placed
eighth in the national ranking
list. With Holman came Lionel
Ogden, Ralph McElvenny, and
Alan Herrir.gton, who last year
formed a team considered by
Coach Hal Davis to have been the
strongest ever to bear the Cardi
nal. All but Holman got in the
first eight of the national inter
collegiate ranking, breaking all
records for the college.
Both Herrington and McElvenny
have the present season for competi
tion and stand a good chance to win
the intercollegiate doubles, if they
are sent East. And now comes John
Hope Doeg, Davis Cup alternate, for
mer national junior champion, hard
est server in the game, whose great
est achievements are yet to be made.
Stanford now enjoys a peerless
position in national intercollegiate
athletics. Tennis has contributed
more than its share of prestige to
the University.
