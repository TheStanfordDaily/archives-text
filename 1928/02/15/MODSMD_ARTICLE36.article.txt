# SPORTS OF 1928

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '10 
When Major H. O. D. Segrave i
hurtled through space over the stands
of Daytonia Beach, Fla., in his 100- !
horse power "Mystery S" last March [
29, he accomplished several things |
sportive. He broke several records, ;
tor one thingâ€”and that, of course, is ]
what he came over, and risked his ;
life, to do.
There was Sig Haugdahl's record :
of a mile in 19.97 seconds, for in-1
stance, made at the same place in
1922. Sig drove his queer-looking
bus at a rate slightly faster than 180
miles per hour. Malcolm Campbell
held the English record of 173.22 m.
p. h., and Tommy Milton was credited j
with the American mark of 156.04 ,
m. p. h.
Now comes word that Frank Lock- j
hart, youthful Los Angeles racing- j
driver, will attempt to erase Major i
Segrave's record of a mile in 17.665 j
seconds. According to T. S. An- ;
drew's 192S record book, Frank Lock- ,
hart holds all speedway records for j
automobiles regardless of class, from
one-quarter to ten miles, inclusive. ;
He set these marks on October 14 j
last at Salem, N.I I. His mile in 26.81 ,
would make his speed about 133 per j
hour if I haven't forgotten my arith- |
metic. Of course, these records were I

made on a circular track, and not
with a machine especially designed to
set a new mark.
Frank Lockhart has done better
than that, however. Last March 5
at Culver City, Cal., he drove a lap in
qualifying for a sanctioned American
Association race at the rate of 144.2
miles per hour. He drove a Miller
special faster than any other racing
car had ever traveled on any track.
But can this intrepid young Lochin
var approach Major Segrave's 203.-
7928 miles per hour
