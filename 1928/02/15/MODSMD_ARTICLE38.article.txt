# HUNKEN UNANIMOUSLY ELECTED CAPTAIN OF 1931 BASEBALL NINE
## 
### 
John W. (Hunk) Hunken, left
fielder, was unanimously chosen cap- 1
tain of. the freshman baseball team |
by his teammates yesterday after- I
noon. Hunken is a former San Fran- j
cisco Polytechnic High School star
where he played baseball all four j
years.
Hunken has been from the start of j
the season the natural leader of the J
team, and besides starring in the out- j
field, is lead-off man on the batting j
lineup.
Coach Harry Wolter led the 1931
baseball men in another strenuous
workout last night in preparation for
their opening game of the season with
San Mateo Junior College Saturday j
morning. The junior college team has
the advantage of being a veteran
squad, as most of the men are sopho
mores. Stanford's freshmen, however,
have been playing together for only
a few weeks and Coach Wolter ad
vances the opinion that the yearlings
will have to exhibit superfine team
work to win the game.
Infield practice last night, was in
accurate and slow. The throwing and
fielding improved toward the end of
the session but the usual fire and en
thusiasm of the squad was missing.
To offset this, Don Story, sensational
freshman pitcher, continued his fine
work. Captain Hunken and Allen ap
pear to be batting most consistently.
Bob Ricklefs, second string pitcher,
has been out of the game for the last
two nights with an injured eye. This
j will probably keep him from partici
! pating in Saturday's contest.
