# THE 						ELECTION FIASCO
## 
### 
Yesterday's joke of an election was clue to carelessness and failure
of the Election Board to provide sufficient ballots.
The fiasco, worse than the one of a year ago, resulted in the invali
dating of all the A.S.S.U. ballots (which contained the names of the
candidates for editorship of the Daily, Board of Athletic Control, and
Junior and Sophomore representatives on the Executive Committee);
the Men's Council ballots; and the ballots for the Classes of 1929 and
1930.
A shortage occurred in the Men's Council and the two class ballots
before the polls closed at 2 o'clock. The names of the candidates for
the two Executive Committee offices were transposed. Dean Kirkwood
of the Law School ruled that all of the ballots in these cases be declared
invalid. All of the ballots so affected were burned.
In consequence of this fiasco, the Executive Committee last night
took several steps which, it is expected, will prevent the possibility of
another miscarriage of election in this manner.
Yesterday's election should have been in the charge of Fred Wool,
who was technically the chairman of the Election Board. Wool, how
ever, was nominated to run again for Mali's Council and, as a candi
date, was disqualified to serve on the Election Board. In his stead he
appointed Robert Eraser who, after ordering the ballots at the Uni
versity Press, left for Los Angeles, leaving in his stead Dave Jacobsen
in charge.
The difficulty arose from the fact that Eraser left an erroneous
order for the ballots at the University Press. The ballots were printed
as he ordered them, and in the quantity directed. His estimates of the
numbers of ballots necessary were apparently based upon previous
quantities of ballots necessary. (The cost of printing ballots for an
election of this sort is approximately $27.)
To prevent the possibility of this happening again, the Executive
Committee last night passed several by-laws (which are given elsewhere
in this issue of the Daily) and dissolved the Election Board. It then
appointed three new members of the Board and reappointed three more.
Student government is being made more than a laughing-stock by
such exhibitions as these. By tomorrow's election and that of next
Tuesday a fair trial will be given of the new rules for the Election
Board. 1 112 all does not work out satisfactorily, another shakedown, more
severe, is warranted.
