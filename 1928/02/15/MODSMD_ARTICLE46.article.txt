Stanford's debating team will meet the
College of the Pacific speakers in a dual

"Resolved, That the results of the World
War have tended toward the peace of
the world." Arthur Angel, Paul Herbold,
and Herbert Wenig will meet the Tiger

the Stockton meeting will debate in their
trip to Southern California at the end
of the month.
