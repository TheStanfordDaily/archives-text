After a fortnight's respite from play
because of voluntary precautions taken
against the threatened poliomyelitis epi
demic the intramural basketball teams
swung again into action last night in the
fourth round of the races toward league
championships. The play of every club
was sluggish and showed poor form due
to the lack of practice and conditioning
during the last two weeks layoff.
In the fastest game of the day Sequoia
I lost to the Indians by a rally in the last
half. With the score tied at half time,
the Indians showed enough strength to
make 11 points to their opponents' 9. Pre
vious to today's contest both teams were
tied for first honors in League VI with
1 .(XX) yer cent. The game was in reality
the championship match. Starting with
an early lead Sequoia held the top until
the end of the first half when Indians
tied the score at 7 to 7.
Encina Basement Wins
In a slow, almost lifeless contest En
cina Basement walloped the Los Arcos
basketeers to the tunc of 15 to 7. During
the first half neither team seemed able to
shoot effectively but in the last half the
Encina boys found a semblance of their
shooting eyes and gradually drew far
enough ahead so that their victory was
never in doubt.
Playing raggedly but showing enough
fight to make the game exciting, the El
Toro five decisively defeated the Phi
Gamma Delta quintet. The score was 15
to 5, of which 8 of the winning points
were garnered by Krause for El Toro.
A.K.L.'s Downed
Encina 1W defeated the Alpha Kappa
Lambda quintet in a slow contest fea
tured by poor shooting. Both teams
started play with little system and ragged
passing. With the score 13 to 3 against
them at half-time the fraternity men
picked up in the final quarters putting the
score on more even terms.
Sequoia II defeated Phi Sigma Kappa
in the final game of the evening. The
first quarter was lifeless and neither team
was able to hold onto the ball after pass
ing down to their The fraternity
five took the lead in the opefling quarter
but lost in the next, not to regain it again.
The final result was 24 to 9.
