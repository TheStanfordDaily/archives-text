# COOLIDGE FUND GIVEN $5000 BY BLACKMER, OIL MAN, SAYS NYE

### 
WASHINGTON, Fob. 14.—(U.P.)—
Information has been received alleg
ing that Harry M. Blackmer, the oil
man who fled to Europe rather than
testify in the Teapot Dome trials,
gave $5,000 to the Coolidge-Dawes
campaign fund in 1924, Senator Nye,
chairman of the Teapot Dome Inves
tigating Committee, said today.
Blackmer sent the money in Sep
tember 1924, giving his address as
Denver, Colorado. He already had
gone to Europe where he has refused
to come back in response to sub
poenas for the Teapot Dome trials.
Government attorneys prosecuting
the Teapot Dome case already had
discovered the Continental Trading
Company deal in which Blackmer was
implicated at the time Blackmer sent
his contribution. The same month
that his contribution was received by
the Republicans the Government
prosecutors, Owen J. Roberts and
Atlee Pomerene, went to Canada in a
fruitless effort to compel H. S. Osier,
the head of this Continental Com
pany, to clear up the mystery about
it. The $230,500 Liberty Bonds
bought with its profits had been
traced to Albert B. Fall. Blackmer
and James E. O'Neil, another oil man
in the deal, had both fled to avoid
being questioned.
