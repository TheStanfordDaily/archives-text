# SPECIAL VOTE TO ELECT CLASS, A.S.S.U. OFFICERS SLATED TODAY
## Polls Open at Eight-Thirty, Will Close at Two In Afternoon WILL CHOOSE EDITOR Voters Will Select Three New Representatives To Men's Council 
### 
The editor of the Stanford Daily,
the member-at-large of the Board of
Athletic Control, two long term mem
bers and one short term member of
the Men's Council, and a sophomore
and a junior member of the Executive
Committee, and officers of the classes
of 1929 and 1930 will be voted on at
a special election today called by the
Executive Committee because of the
invalidation of the election to fill
those offices last Tuesday.
Errors in the A.S.S.U. ballots and
insufficiency of class ballots caused
the discounting of those cast last
Tuesday. Offices contested at last
Tuesday's election and offices con
tested in today's election will be
voted on again at a re-election next
Tuesday.
The polls will be open from 8:30
o'clock this morning until 2 o'clock
this afternoon. Returns on the elec
tion may be had by phoning the Daily
Office, Palo Alto 1074, after 5 o'clock.
Dave Jacobson, chairman of the
Election Board, warns voters to fol
low directions on the ballots explicit
ly. Despite previous warnings many
ballots were discarded at Tuesday's
election because of failure to fill them
out correctly.
The list of nominees running for
office may ho found elsewhere in this
paper.
