## Vance Fawcett Saves Day For Yearling Hoopmen By Brilliant Play CAPTAIN REYNOLDS STAR Battle Has Slow Beginning With U.C. Freshmen Scoring First 
### Whitney Wright 
BERKELEY, Fob. 15. —(Special to
Stanford Daily)— After playing a list
less, ragged game for a period and a
i half, Vance Fawcett, star Stanford
j forward, woke up in time to stave off
I defeat and eked out a 24 to 22 victory
, for Stanford.
Fawcett Plays Brilliantly
i Fawcett's brilliant defensive game,
; together with his field goal, put and
kept the Cards in the lead in the
| closing period of the game and barely
; sufficed to hold off the dazzling Cali
fornia attack led by Coffield and
Granger.
Game Starts Slowly
The game started slowly, with both
teams nervous and uncertain in their
play. California scored first, but
shortly afterward Stanford took the
lead and held it to the end of the
first period with the score 14 to 12.
Only one burst of hard fighting en
livened the first period.
Stanford Gets Lead
Stanford started the second period
by piling up a lead of seven points
before California had come to its
senses. Four baskets by the Blue and
Gold shot in quick succession sud
denly put the Bears one point ahead
of -the Cardinals. Stanford, however,
rallied in time to sink a basket and
free throw to save the game.
Mears, Hawkins Show Well
High-point men of the game were
Captain Reynolds and Vance Fawcett
of Stanford and Joe Coffield of Cali
fornia with 7 points apiece. Mears
and Hawkins both showed well. Cap
tain McCoy and Granger of the Bear
frosh were the outstanding men for
the opposition. Stanford used no sub
stitutes in the game.
