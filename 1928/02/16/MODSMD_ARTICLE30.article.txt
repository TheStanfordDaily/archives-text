# "Go Rob a Bank"
## 
### 
In case one, in a pleasant mood, should fail to remember that chivalry
in all its entirety is not abroad, let this be a word of warning. Not that
the Stanford man will not gladly climb his auto up a tree to avoid the
carefree cyclist, or tip his hat if he has one, or any of the other more
common masculine reactions to feminine proximity, but there is one more
crude lack of chivalry—and that is this everlasting petty thievery.
We know but little about conditions in the "good old days," but just
now anyone who lays aside his books on the Quad is either an optimist
or one of our better known kind of fools. They may be there when he
gets back —and then they may not, depending partly 011 the value involved.
One sunny afternoon last week a professor went into his house for a
moment, leaving behind on the running board of his automobile his well
filled brief case. The car was still there when he returned. The library,
particularly the periodical department, is constantly suffering from the
depredations of some of our oily collegiates. Magazines, certain desired
pages, and books are lifted just as if the library owed the thief an unpay
able debt.
The list can easily be extended. The Gym is a veritable fertile pasture
for the light-fingered boys. Not a few auto accessories vanish into the
night, never to return. And as for slickers—wait until it starts raining
again.
Our contempt for those who do this petty thieving is boundless. We
could respect them more if they had the nerve to rob a bank. But they
haven't: they are just low and oily enough to sneak off a book or hurry
off with a brief case left unguarded for a moment.
