# A 						Lesson
## 
### 
By virtue of an anticlimax, unparalleled in the history of the Daily,
the present management of the paper once more makes the announcement
that "Volume 72 closes with this issue." The events crowded into the two
days since that statement was first made constitute a lesson with a moral
for student politicians and officers in student government. Weakness of
organization coupled with carelessness in the Election Board brought
about thoroughgoing revisions in the personnel and regulations of that
body.
It can be definitely said that in this particular election there was no
suggestion of crookedness or "dirty politics," as is charged whenever an
irregularity of some sort occurs in the process of an election. A reform,
then, has been occasioned by events which would not embarrass the whole
of student government. Whether that reform is sufficiently stringent to
satisfy the most hardheaded critics remains to be seen. The organization
and membership of an Election Board must be capable of withstanding
the most severe inspection, or the entire fabric of student government
breaks down.
The special revote is scheduled for today, and the incident of the
"election fiasco" closes with Volume 72. Eor the good of the students as
a whole, we hope that succeeding editors of the Daily will always be the
"most hardheaded critics" of elections and election methods.
