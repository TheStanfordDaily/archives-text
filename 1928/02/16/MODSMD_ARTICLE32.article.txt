"Will you have a cigarette?" the
lovely lady asked me politely. And
then, "Goodness gracious, you're too
good! Do you mind if I smoke?" 1
didn't.
Pauline Frederick, one of the most
glamorous of Hollywood celebrities,
was giving me an interview in her
backstage dressing room prior to the
Friday evening performance of her
new play, "The Scarlet Woman."
Close-up in person, she is just what
you surmise when you see her on the
stage—very beautiful, witty, and in
telligent.
"I am giving this comedy its world
premiere here at the Geary because
I'm superstitious about the good luck
I have in San Francisco. I love it
here —it seems like a second home.
I doubt if I shall do another play this
year, for I'm going to take this on
tour.
To Revisit England
"Then next season I'm going back
to England because they were so won
derful to me over there. I won't stay,
though, for this is my native country
and naturally I'd rather play here."
During the year that has elapsed
since she appeared here last as the
sophisticated heroine of "Lady Fred
erick," she has been making a trium
phal tour of England. In London she
was accorded the biggest reception
ever given an American stage star.
This San Francisco engagement is
her first since her recent return from
Europe.
"The screen and stage are very
similar," she answered when I
brought up the acting question. "Pan
tomime is the basis of both. For pic
tures you have a camera and less
space to move around, on the stage
you have your audience —but your
facial expressions are equally import
ant for either."
Implies Acting Is Easy
Miss Frederick gracefully implied
that acting for both camera and audi
ence was quite simple. But the ease
with which she plays alternately
tragedy and comedy bespeaks much
hard work. Her voice, for instance, is
charmingly modulated —as a result of
many years' training.
"I had ten years' experience on the
stage before I went into the movies,"
she explained. "My name first went
up into electric lights in New York —
but now I'm a confirmed Coast De
fender!" (The latter title being
awarded those stars who prefer work
ing in sunny California to playing
on snowy Broadway.)
She doesn't intend to forsake the
movies entirely. She is starred in the
picture at the Orpheum this week—
"The Nest," and expects to do an

other picture this spring. Although
her home in Beverly Hills is one of
the show places of that city, she
would rather tour the country with
her plays than retire to inactive pri
vate life.
Excels in New Play
As for her new play at the Geary
Theatre —"The Scarlet Woman." It is
very much of a comedy, despite the
sensational name, and one that al
lows fullest play of Miss Frederick's
able talents. As Agatha Marley, ne
glected daughter of a famous profes
sor, she returns from a year's visit
in New York with an adopted three
months-old baby which she hopes will
relieve the loneliness of a beaux-less
house. When the village gosspis mis
interpret her move, she has a "scar
let" reputation thrust upon her. And,
incidentally, many admirers.
The cast is a fine one, Norman
Peck being particular clever as Felix,
the ambitious young druggist. If you
saw "The Great Necker" you'll recall
Hope Drown, who played the sup
posedly innocent young thing in that
epic of the modern generation. Miss
Drown is in this new play, and is as
cute as can be. Then there is Mary
Margaret Reid —the three-months-old
young lady whom Miss Frederick
calls the real star of the company.
"The Scarlet Woman" was written
by two women expressly for Miss
Frederick.
