# SPORTS OF 1928

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The title "Intercollegiate cham
pion" sometimes doesn't mean much,
because in certain cases only a small
part of the country is represented at
the meeting, games, or tournament
in question. For instance, to call the
winner of an event in the 1.C.4.A.
track meet "Intercollegiate Cham
pion" is misleading because the Mid
dle West, South, and Southwest are
not represented in the 1.C.4.A. and
the winner of an event in the Nati
onal Collegiate meet or the Missouri
Valley Conference has just as much
claim to that title as an 1.C.-4A. win
ner.
But there are certain competitions
where the collegiate champion of the
country is clearly defined. There are
the golf and tennis championships,
for instance. Watts Gunn, of Georgia
Tech, is the intercollegiate golf
champion at present. And Wilmer
Allison, of the University of Texas,
is the intercollegiate singles tennis
champion, with Van Ryn and Appell,
of Princeton, standing at the top in
doubles.
In football, baseball, boxing, and
other college sports it is practically
impossible to name a definite cham-

pion, although when one major team
remains unbeaten or untied in foot
ball it usually has the mythical hon
ors bestowed upon it. But there is
no doubt about Georgia Tech having
the best golfer in all the colleges and
universities of the country, or that
Texas has the best tennis player.
Watts Gunn, who was the hero of
the 1925 amateur championship, and
a member of the United States Wal
ker Cup team in 1926, won the quali
fying medal at Garden City last June
29 with a score of 302. He set a new
record of 69 in the final round on
July 2, and two weeks later shot a
64 to win the Georgia State amateur
championship. Just wait till he grad
uates!
