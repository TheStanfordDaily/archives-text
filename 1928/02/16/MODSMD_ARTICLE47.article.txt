# Moot Court to Question Insanity in Homicide Case
## 
### 
The most interesting Moot Court
case of the year as far as the public
is concerned will be brought up
Thursday night at 7:30 o'clock in
Room 12. The question, involving the
constitutionality of a statute which
abolishes the plea of insanity in all
homicide cases, goes to the very limit
of police power.
Call and Rathbun will represent the
respondents, Brown and Lloyd the
appellants. Dean Kirkwood of the
Law School will be the presiding
judge.

U.S.C. will have a Trojau Day at'
the eighteenth annual Orange Show I
in San Bernardino.
