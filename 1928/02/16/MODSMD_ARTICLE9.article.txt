# Guggenheim Fund Report Sees New Era For Aviation
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 15.— (U.P.) —
Airplanes which can rise abruptly
from a flying field, fly through fog or
sleet without danger, land slowly and
on small fields, and carry their pas
sengers swiftly and with the safety
of railroad travel are foreseen for the
future by the Daniel Guggenheim
Fund for the promotion of aeronau
tics.
The Fund issued its first report,
after approximately two years of
existence, today. It was signed by
Harry F. Guggenheim, president.
"The wildest dreams of the aviators
have been accomplished," it said.
"We have flown to the North Pole,
we have flown across the Atlantic
and half way across the Pacific. We
have flown at a speed of over 300
miles an hour and have remained in
the air over 51 hours at a time."
"In the spectacular there is nothing
more to be desired," it added. "We
now face a task of less dramatic,
equally exacting sort —the task of the
builder who follows the pioneer and
gives practical effect to his exploits."
Safety, according to the report, is
the prime necessity and to that end
it is offering a total of $15,000 in
prizes for aircraft making the great
est advances in the matter of safety.
Already several American and foreign
builders have entered the competi
tion.
