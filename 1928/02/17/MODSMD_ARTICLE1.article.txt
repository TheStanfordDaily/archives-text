The winning opera book is based
on the struggle of a poor but deserv
ing college boy for bis lady love's
hand. The struggle begins on a col-

lege campus, continues through a
floating university to the South Sea
Islands, and is brought to a finish on
-the floor of the New York Stock Ex
change.
No definite date has been chosen
for the Opera as yet, but it will be
given sometime during the early part
of spring quarter, following the Eng
lish Club play. The cast allows for
seven major parts, and a number of
minor ports. Three bloodthirsty pi
rates are one of the unusual provi
sions of the cast.
