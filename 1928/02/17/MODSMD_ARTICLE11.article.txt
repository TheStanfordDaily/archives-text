—Seventeen dead and thirty-eight seri
ously ill was the toll of the pneumonia
epidemic which lias been raging aboard
the Dollar liner President Cleveland,
when the vessel reached port here today
after a dramatic race against death.

Fourteen of the most serious cases
were removed to local hospitals soon
after the ship reached quarantine, and
doctors and nurses went aboard the ves
sel to relieve the heroic ship's surgeon,
Dr. George Beldcn, who has worked un
ceasingly for four days and five nights
fighting the spread of the epidemic,
which was confined largely to Filipinos

in the steerage.
Only one of the cases was definitely
diagnosed as smallpox, officials of the
company said.
The seventeen dead bad been buried at
sea before the ship reached port.
