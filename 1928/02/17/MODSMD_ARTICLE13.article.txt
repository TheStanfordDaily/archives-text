# BASKETBALL VARSITY STARTS PREPARATION FOR BEAR CONTESTS
## Hunt Puts Cards Through Stiff Scrimmage in Practice Session 
### Merle Emry 
Stanford's varsity basketball team,
which returned from IT.S.C. yesterday
morning, gave an exhibition of the
type of game it played in the first
contest against the Trojans Monday
night, in scrimmage against the fresh-

man team yesterday afternoon.
"The entire team was sure off the
night of that first game," was the com
ment of Coach Husky Hunt. "That's
just the way they played then."

Hunt plans to spend the next few
days drilling his charges on the fun
damentals of the game, passing and
shooting. He figures he has a big
chance to bring the men back to the

form they were in before they went
south. He bases his opinion mainly
on the fight and the ability the Cardi
nals showed in the second game with
U.S.C. when the latter snatched vic
tory by shooting two long shots in
the last minute of play after Stanford
had outplayed the Trojans throughout

the game

With the first contest of the annual
Big Game series scheduled for Tues
day night, the Cardinals will have to
buckle down to business right away
for Hunt counts upon California's
being much improved since it played
U.C.L.A. some two weeks ago. His
plan for workout this afternoon calls
for concentration on passing. The
Trojans made five baskets as the re
sult of poor passing on the varsity's
part and the Cardinal coach does not
propose to have that happen against
the Bears.

Rothert and Thompson played the
best game of their careers against
the' Trojans, Hunt declared, so it
looks as if these two have the guard
ing positions cinched for the first
game against California. Vincenti and
Clark gave a good account of them
selves in this same game and will
likely be included in the starting
line-up with Rothert and Thompson.
Berg and Richards have been fight
ing it out for the other forward posi
tion and Hunt's selection for that
berth will be influenced greatly by the
stuff these two men show between
now and Tuesday.
