Daily Election Unusual
The election of Baker to the Daily edi
torship resulted after an unusual turn
of events which has not happened in the
election ot the editor since the spring of
1925. Neither Baker nor Behlc gained a
two-thirds majority in the staff vote a
week ago last Tuesday; so the elcctior
went to Quad under the provisions o
A.S.S.U. By-Laws.

Baker was appointed to the. Daily s
in May 1925, was promoted to night â– 
tor in September 1926, and has scrvf
managing editor since last October,
will hold office until the closc of sp
quarter.
Of the total 1246 votes polled, 999
men's and 247 women's. There wen
less votes polled in this election thai
last Tuesday's.

No class officers were chosen yester
day, with the result that president, vice
president, and secretary of the classes of
1929 and 1930 will be chosen next Tues
day, in addition to those of 1928 and
1931 who remain from last Tuesday to
be elected.
