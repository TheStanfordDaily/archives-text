# Irish Marathon Trials to Be Continued Next Week
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Irish Marathon
teams will continue Monday and
Tuesday at 4:15 o'clock. Track man
agers will record the records of each
man. Since twenty-four men are
needed for each team, class captains
request that all men in each class
try out.
