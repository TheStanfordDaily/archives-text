"The theatre has always existed," de
clared Madame Alexandra Masurova-
George, Russian author, critic, and lec
turer, in her lecture on the "Modern The
atre" at a meeting of the Stanford Dames
in the Women's Clubhouse yesterday.
"It is our inborn capacity to perform,"
.she explained. "The child is always act
ing; the adult performs as much. His
torically it may be true that the theatre
was developed by the Greeks, but the
theatre itself has always existed.

"There are three elements of expres
sion : the mimic, elocution, and motion.
All three seem important. And yet, there
can be genuine theatrical excellence in
pantomime without the aid of elocution,
and the mimic is not essential. But there
is no theatrical performance without mo
tion. Motion is the movement of our
minds. It is the only way of bringing the
abstract to material form.
