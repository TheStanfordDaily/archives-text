Well, here we are. Today is the opening gun of a brand new volume
of the Daily. It's a pretty young infant to be looking back already, but,
unlike Topsy, it hasn't "just growed." Indirectly, it is the outcome of
generations of editors; directly, it is the product of bred Speers, editor of
Volume 72, and his cohorts.

Ever since the first quarter of his freshman year, Speers has been a
member of the Daily staff—perhaps the most active member in years.
The staff wishes him a lot of good luck, and wishes, by gosh, it could go
back to studying, too.
And thus, before we become too sentimental, we get back to the point
that the paper is under new hands. Or should we say old hands with new
titles? The new titles will all be given on Monday, but the fingers that
pounded the typewriters are continuing to pound them just the same.
As to policy it may be said: "Let well enough alone, but when things
aren't well enough—well!"

One thing that is always bothering the visored heads of America is:
"What the deuce will we write about today?" Suffice it to say that hence
forth it shall be the intention on the Daily to write editorials when edi
torials are needed, or when something is deemed worthy of notice. When
these things are absent the column under the masthead will contain news.
