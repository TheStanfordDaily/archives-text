# Say It With Ballots
## 
### 
More than twelve hundred votes were cast during yesterday's ballot
ing. In view of the recent joke the election board played, this was an
'nusually large turnout. More than one-third of the student body voted,
is hoped that as many will support their candidates in the re-vote next
lesday.
People complain about the unfitness of the average American to cast
ballot. Right here is the place to start the practice of voting intelli
itly. Weigh the merits of the various candidates, make your decision,
â€¢n VOTE.
