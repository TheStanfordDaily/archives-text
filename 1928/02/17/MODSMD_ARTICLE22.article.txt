# Rooters
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball teams play their annual duels with California
next week. The varsity will play three games at the Kezar pavilion (the
Lord only knows just why), and the freshmen will play a game here.
Hooters' tickets go on sale this morning. After tomorrow noon none will
be sold.
The basketball players have had a tough time this year because of what
is popularly termed the "Ippy Epidemic." They will be playing to a large
audience at Kezar Stadium, but how many will be Cardinal rooters?
