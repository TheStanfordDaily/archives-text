# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Why have a car that makes "65 or
better?" Why tolerate an officer who
does not know the proper names of our
sacred streets, calling University Ave
nue "Palm Drive" and calling Lasuen
Street "Truck Road"? Why can lie issue
only two tickets in one week when there
is a speeder every minute ? And why
does he boast that he caught one lad
after "laying for him for some time"?
Why not pinch a fellow at 20 per instead
of waiting to get him at 25 per? Who
says that three men on the Council con
stitute a quorum? How do you figure a
"three-fourths majority" can be obtained
from three men if only one votes—or
even if two had voted?

Why not have student cops on the
campus and get all of these speeders who
go beyond 15 miles per hour? Let's have
plenty of them on duty and if they don't
get enough revenue to pay their own
wages and start that dormitory fund go
ing by leaps and bounds, there will be
more than one fooled. 1 am for fairness
to all—nothing more, nothing less. Let
the standards be set by our superiors, but
let it be seen that all speeders are turned
in instead of only two.

I The Editor, Sir:
In reply to "A Rusty Nymph" I wish to
I admit that "of course we can't all be mil
lionaires and ride in Fords," but couldn't
t those unfortunates of the "500" get "on

the boat" and make themselves so attrac
tive that a "dirty trousered son of the
Stanford Red" driving one of those "ram
bling wrecks of poverty" might thereby
humble himself and condescend to offer
them a ride? Perhaps cycling is a means
by which they can accomplish this. Does
it develop the figure, or reduce it? If so,
may the spring showers rain bicycles.

If cycling provides such wonderful ex
ercise, I am so sorry if I was in error
by objecting to the participation of the
rusty nymphs in this activity, but don't
you think walking is excellent exercise?
What would you do if you forgot your
bicycle and carfare? Or aren't you the
type that would—not to forget—but to
walk home?

I wish to apologize further to the
youthful intelligentsia that are so very
proud of their brains. I am so sorry that
I referred to them merely as rusty jointed
nymphs. Why was I so narrow as to
confine it to their joints?
