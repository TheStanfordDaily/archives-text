## American Poet, Author of "A Rendezvous With Death," Fought in France 
### Jack W. Hardy 
"I have a rendezvous with Death
At some disputed barricade . . .
At midnight in some flaming town.
When spring trips north again this

year,
And I to my pledged word am true,
I shal lnot fail that rendezvous."
At midnight on July 4, 1916, at
Belloy-en-Santerre, Alan Seeger, the

youthful American poet of the For
eign Legion found his disputed bar
ricade and flaming town —there he
kept his rendezvous with Death.

A man who saw him fall, who
helped him to bring his stark, cold
body back to the lines, and had been
his companion in life, told the writer
this story of Alan Seeger—Seeger,
the American, who gave his life for

France.
He was born a poet. His life was
an epic poem, and death was the
climax of his unfinished symphony of

being.
The story properly begins with his
graduation from Harvard in 1910. He
then spent two restless years in New
York—searching for something he
could not find there —an opportunity
to throw himself heart and soul into
the full stream of life. The magic
Paris seemed to him to bo the place
where his fullest expression of living
could be realized. With keen anticipa
tion he left America, and never again
did he greet her shores.

Dwelt iri Latin Quarter
In Paris he lived in the Latin quar
ter. He had a room near the Mus6e
de Cluny, and here he found the life
that his soul had craved. He made
friends of those who loved and en
joyed life as he did. In this atmos
pliei'e and to these friends he could
pour out his full heart, and express
his native beauty and art, and crea
tive desire.

Soon a girl flashed across his life —
a beautiful child in whom he found
the poignant realization of Ihe deeper
life. Little is known of her except
that meeting her was the turning
point in his life. For a brief year Alan
Seeger was sublimely happy. In his
love for her he lived his remark.

"One crowded liour of glorious life
Is worth an age without a name."
His joy was too full to last. The
girl found a new interest. Alan Seeger
had lived his hour. The old places,
(he good friends, all seemed different,
strange. All life was different. He had
LIVED. For him, life had seen its
fulfillment, and now it must end. The
Great War was just beginning. France
needed volunteers, and therein he

saw an opportunity to repay his debt
to the Paris he loved —and to keep
his rendezvous.
Joined Foreign Legion
He was accepted in the Foreign
Legion. His one aim was now to die
for France, and die well. Under these
conditions, with an unwavering fatal
ism, he wrote the most poignant of

his well-known verses, "I Have a
Rendezvous With Death." Alan See
ger had gone to his self-appointed
execution.
After fi brief period of preliminary
training he went to the front and saw
active service in the trenches. He
fought with a ferocity and bitterness
that was only possiblo for a man who
knew his days were numbered and

that he was damned to die. He wanted
to die fighting—with his face toward
the enemy of his beloved France.

Died at Belloy-en-Santerre
On the night of July 4, 1916, his
detachment was ordered to take
Belloy-en-Santerre. They did, but Alan
Seeger had fallen from the enfilading
fire of six German machine guns. As
his comrades staggered past he
shouted the battle-cry of the Legion
to them.

j The dawn found Belloy-en-Santerre
i in command of the Legion—and Alan
i Seeger stark and cold. Beside him lay
| liis empty rifle. His bayonet was stuck
in the hard ground. His clothes lay
! beside his nude body. He left life as
|he had entered it —nude and with a
I smile on his parched lips.

This is the story, as told by his
comrade in arms, how Alan Seeger
had lived "one crowded hour of glori
ous life," and "had that rare privilege
of dying well."
