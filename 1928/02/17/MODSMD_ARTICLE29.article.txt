If the Union would fight the
Roost for trade in wild-eyed ad
vertising, featuring low caste
doggerel "verse" one might ex
pect something like this —
Union
You down a snail and coffee
At the Roost.
You eat a greasy doughnut,
Or a piece of soggy pie.
It's cheaper to eat there? Then
Answer me this question—
Haven't better men than you
Died of indigestion?

Roost
Eat i ere, you lowly Stanford rough,
Where does the Union get that stuff?
A sandwich in the hand
Is worth two meals waited for,
Five minutes lost at Waterloo
Cost Napoleon a war!
