# EDDIE FOY, COMEDIAN, DIES IN KANSAS CITY
## 
### 
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 16.—
(U.P.) —Eddie Foy, a trouper for more
than half a century, was on his last road
tour tonight.
Foy was going back toward Broadway,
but death had stilled the sparkling jocu
larity that carried him through his stage
career and had ended for Foy the hope
that his next trip to Broadway would be
to star in one more show before he died.
With the death in Kansas City today
of Edward Fitzgerald, a personality
known to the world as Eddie Foy, the
American stage lost one of its best known
institutions.
