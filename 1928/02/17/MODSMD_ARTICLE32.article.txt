# AND Then Our A Little SALLY ...

### 
I really do think it is wonderful
the way we have so much co
coeration on this campus. And
so much spirit. I mean, every
thing has to give way to every
thing else.

The basketball games have to
give way to the committee, and
dramatic productions wait weeks
and weeks. I am actually tired of
seeing green posters still on the
Quad. You read them over and
over, and then find that thev are
al! wrong after you have memo
rized them.

And of course we poor har
rassed girls and boys find it so
difficult to keep on adjusting our
selves to everything. Of course,
elections are interesting, and
practice does make perfect.

But I really think it was per
fectly killing when public-minded
people added names to the ballots
and voted for them. I mean, demo
cracy is everything on this cam-

pus.
Just look at the way we all look
out for the other person. Inter
esting topics come from active
people, if you know what I mean.
I wish you could have heard all
about that election. For it really
was a perfect scream the way
people stood in line and never
said a word, that is, except very

necessary ones.
It just goes to show that col
lege students really can apply
themselves when a thing has to
be done a second time. They
seem to realize that we really
do need some new officers.
