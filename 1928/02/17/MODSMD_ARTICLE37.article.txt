# VARSITY BOXING TEAM TO COMPETE AGAINST BEAR AGGIES TONIGHT
## Seven Stanford Fighters Will Travel to Davis for Initial Meet 
### 
A strong team of seven fast and hard
punching Card boxers will meet the Cali
fornia Aggies at Davis tonight in the
varsity's first tournament of the year.
Though five of these men are new on the
varsity squad, having been discovered in
the recent novice tournament, their
chances of victory were yesterday said to
be good by Harry Maloney, boxing coach,
who expects to repeat the clean sweep
over Davis last year. Ed Dillon, Jack
Kenaston, Walter Gage, Dan Frost, John
Hromadka, Bill Levit, and Hugh Israel
will represent Stanford tonight.
Ed Dillon, in the lieavyweight class, is
a last year's man and has improved 100
per cent since that time. He is reliable
and will give any college heavyweight on
the coast more than a run for his money.
Fain Will Not Box

Jack Kenaston, a light heavyweight,
will box for Stanford tonight owing to
the fact that Captain Norman Fain will
be absent. Kenaston displayed good form
in the novice tournament and showed
that he has a lot of power in either hand.
Walker Gage, winner in the middle
weight class in the novice tournament,
is a rugged, two-fisted fighter, and has
shown steady improvement since that con
test.

Dan Frost, a welterweight, proved him
self to be a willing mixer and a hard
hitter in the tournament. He hits from
most any angle with a degree of accuracy
and force that would discourage almost
any college welter's aspirations.
Novice Winner to Fight

John Hromadka will fight for Stan
ford tonight in the lightweight class. He
is also a winner in the novice tournament.
Bill Levit, a last year's man, will box
in the featherweight class. He should
give a good account of himself at Davis
tonight. Hugh Israel, a bantamweight,
is an aggressive, heady, and willing mix
er. Since his "coming forth" in the
novice tournament he has shown steady

improvement.
Homer Toberman, middleweight, and
Harry Birch, lightweight, will box in ex
hibition matches.

The Masonic Lodge will construct
a building adjoining the new U.C.L.A.

novice tournament he has shown steady

improvement.
Homer Toberman, middleweight, and
Harry Birch, lightweight, will box in ex
hibition matches.

The Masonic Lodge will construct
a building adjoining the new U.C.L.A.
campus.
A strong team of seven fast and hard
punching Card boxers will meet the Cali
fornia Aggies at Davis tonight in the
varsity's first tournament of the year.
Though five of these men are new on the
varsity squad, having been discovered in
the recent novice tournament, their
chances of victory were yesterday said to
be good by Harry Maloney, boxing coach,
who expects to repeat the clean sweep
over Davis last year. Ed Dillon, Jack
Kenaston, Walter Gage, Dan Frost, John
Hromadka, Bill Levit, and Hugh Israel
will represent Stanford tonight.
Ed Dillon, in the lieavyweight class, is
a last year's man and has improved 100
per cent since that time. He is reliable
and will give any college heavyweight on
the coast more than a run for his money.
Fain Will Not Box

Jack Kenaston, a light heavyweight,
will box for Stanford tonight owing to
the fact that Captain Norman Fain will
be absent. Kenaston displayed good form
in the novice tournament and showed
that he has a lot of power in either hand.
Walker Gage, winner in the middle
weight class in the novice tournament,
is a rugged, two-fisted fighter, and has
shown steady improvement since that con
test.

Dan Frost, a welterweight, proved him
self to be a willing mixer and a hard
hitter in the tournament. He hits from
most any angle with a degree of accuracy
and force that would discourage almost
any college welter's aspirations.
Novice Winner to Fight

John Hromadka will fight for Stan
ford tonight in the lightweight class. He
is also a winner in the novice tournament.
Bill Levit, a last year's man, will box
in the featherweight class. He should
give a good account of himself at Davis
tonight. Hugh Israel, a bantamweight,
is an aggressive, heady, and willing mix
er. Since his "coming forth" in the
novice tournament he has shown steady

improvement.
Homer Toberman, middleweight, and
Harry Birch, lightweight, will box in ex
hibition matches.

The Masonic Lodge will construct
a building adjoining the new U.C.L.A.
campus.
