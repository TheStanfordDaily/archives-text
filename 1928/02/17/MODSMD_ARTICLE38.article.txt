# SPORTS OF 1928
## Their Third Meeting 
### BY "FEG MURRAY. '16 
When Sergeant Sammy Baker of
Mitchell Field, N. Y. punched "Wild
cat" Ace Hudkins of Nebraska all
around a New York ring last June,
most folks thought that the tough
blond buzzsaw from Valparaiso was
through. Sergeant Baker easily out
boxed the Wildcat, punished him
cruelly about the face and body, and
finally won on a technical knock-out
in the seventh round.
"Yes, Ace is on the down grade,"
said the wise ones, with a shake of
the head, "and it's a pity, too, l'or he's
a game, tough fighter, who always
gave us a run for our money." They
likened Ace to battling Nelso". in
that he made up for what he lacked
in science by ever pressing forward,
shooting punches at his adversary,
and taking all that came his way
without flinching. Now this boring
in style of fighting is supposed to get
you in the end, and most of the bat
tlers who took it the way Ace has
taken it are now cutting out paper
dolls in a place where people go
when they get that way.
But not so with the Nebraska Wild
cat. A Month later he fought Sammy

Baker again, this time in Los Angeles
and won the decision after ten spec
tacular rounds in which he scored a
knockdown and had tlie local intelli
gentsia dizzy with excitement.
Now these two game lads meet in
a third encounter in New York to
night. Baker has a grand right hand
and Lon Chaney in his wildest mo
ments was never as hard-boiled a
sergeant as he is. Ace —he's the
toughest, rippin'est, tearin'est, claw
in'est man-eating wildcat in captivity,
and if he hasn't begun to slip yet —
why, watch your step, Mr. Baker,
watch your step!
