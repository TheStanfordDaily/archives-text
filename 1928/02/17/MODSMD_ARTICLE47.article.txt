SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 16.—( U.P.)
—"Arizona," said by soldiers of the 30th
Infantry to be about the orneriest and
laziest mule in existence, but beloved by
all of them because of his wound stripes
earned in the Argonnc, formed a review
ing committee of one while the full regi
ment marched in full dress before him
at the Presidio here today.
"Arizona" was combed and curried,
his hooves were gilded, and he wore his
fancy blanket with the wound stripes as
he stood on the reviewing platform and
apparently failed entirely to enjoy the
honor which was bestowed upon him.

The Oregon State Newspaper Con
'erence was recently held at the Uni
rersity of Oregon.
