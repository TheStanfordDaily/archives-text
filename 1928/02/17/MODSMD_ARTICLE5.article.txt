# FRESHMEN TO PLAY SAN MATEO JUNIOR COLLEGE TOMORROW
## 
### 
While the varsity baseball squad
travels to San Jose tomorrow morn
ing to meet the Santa Clara Broncos,
the home diamond will be defended
by the freshman team when it clash
es with the strong San Mateo Junior

College nine in the first game of its
season. The contest will start at 10:30
o'clock.

Coacli Harry Wolter was not overly
optimistic when reviewing the babes'
chances of a victory tomorrow. Most
of the men of the junior college squad
are veterans of last season and the
Stanford yearlings have been playing
together for but a short time.

The early-season weakness of the
Stanford squad in hitting seems to be
largely eliminated. Coach Wolter has
been intensively drilling his men for
the past three weeks in the offensive
department of the game and his work
is now producing pleasing results.

Stanford's defensive work is of a
first-class variety and may be able in
itself to defeat the Bulldogs. With
Don Story on the mound, and Teague,
Magee, Johnson, and Hedge covering
the infield, the Cardinals have a good
combination. Infield practice regained
its old fire last night in practice and
as a result the general accuracy of
the entire squad improved.

The Cardinal outfield positions will
be covered by Captain Huuken in left
field, Allen in center, and probably
Bowles in right. Hunken and Allen
are the two most consistent batsmen
of the squad, and with Teague, John
son, and Hardy, regular catcher, are
expected to lead the team in the of
fensive work.
There will be no admission charged
at the freshman game.
