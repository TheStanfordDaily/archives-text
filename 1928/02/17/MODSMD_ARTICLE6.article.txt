"It is power which accounts for the
United States' high wages," said C. M.
Ripley, General Electric engineer, in his
illustrated lecture "The Romance of
Power" given at the Little Theatre yes
terday afternoon before the engineering
assembly.
"The American worker is rather a di
rector of energy than a one-man unit of
power. This accounts for our country's
enviable position in industry which results
in greater buying power and permits
lower production cost. The time will
soon come when power will be universally
recognized as the foundation of pros
perity and development."
Ripley's talk was divided into a discus
sion of Great Britain's aerial supremacy
over the United States; the large margin
by which the United States surpasses Eu
rope in the use of electrical machinery
and power, including telephones and la
bor-saving devices; and a third phase, in
which he discussed America's high stand
