Intramural basketball games last
night were on a whole the fastest
since the resumption of play Tuesday
after the two weeks' lay-off. With a
little practice the league leaders can
be whipped into shape for the final
championship spurt.

In a whirlwind of a game which
could have been won by either side
until the last minutes of the third
quarter, when Davis, high-point man
of the game with six tallies, looped
two buckets in quick succession for
Kappa Alpha, giving them a three
point lead which they held to the end,
to win from Phi Delta Theta 10 to 7.
The ball was continually changing
hands, each team alternately rushing
the ball to its basket only to lose it
repeatedly because of close guarding.

Kibby, Cook Star
Kibby of Theta Delta Chi and Cook
of Encina IE with four field goals

apiece, starred in opposition to each
other. Cook's teammates gave him
the better support, however, and the
Encina quintet won from the Theta
Delta Chi men 21 to 12. In the first
minutes of the last half with three
substitutes in the game for Encina,
the Theta Delta Clii's drew up within
two points of the leaders and it
looked like a neck-and-neck race to
the finish. Cook and Storey were put
in the game again for Encina, how
ever, and they hapidly drew away
from their opponents in the last

quarter.
El Cuadro took the lead in the first
minute of play with the El Capitan
five and kept increasing it as the
game went on until at the final
whistle the less experienced Capitan
men were totally swamped by the
score of 24 to 5.

Chi Psi Defeated
After playing a nip-and-tuck even
game for the first quarter, the Bull
Pen team cut loose with several long
shots and some clever dribbling to
take the game from the Chi Psi
quintet by the comfortable margin of
29 to 14. The Bull Pen men exhibited
fine teamwork and ran away with the
game in the second half. Davis was
high-point man for the Encina aggre
gation with eleven points.

The highly touted Breakers quintet
barely nosed out a victory from
Toyon Club in a rough-and-tumble
game, which the former won by the
close count of 15 to 13. The score
stood 8 to 7 at the half in favor of
Breakers. The score stood 8 to 7 at
the half in favor of Breakers. Soon
after the opening of the second period
the Toyon squad forged into the lead.
Breakers quickly regained the fore
position when Bogue sank a long shot
from the center of the floor.
Delta Upsilon forfeited to Alpha
Sigma Phi.
Bluebirds won from Encina 4W by
default.
