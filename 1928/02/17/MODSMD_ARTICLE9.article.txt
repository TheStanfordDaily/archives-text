# STANFORD MEN, WOMEN ASKED TO AID HOOVER
## Students Qualified to Vote Are Invited to Join Campaign Club Palo Alto Citizens Organize To Further Secretary's Chances in Race 
### 
Stanford men and women who are
qualified to vote, and members of the
University community at large, are
invited to join the newly formed Palo
Alto Hoover-for-President Republican
Club which has been organized to
furthec the interests of Herbert
Hoover, '95, in the impending presi
dential nomination race.
The following statement heads the

list of members:
"As fellow townsmen of Herbert
Hoover we are flattered by the popu
lar choice of this outstanding citizen
for presidential nomination.
"As voters we will support his can
didacy because we consider him the

one man in the nation supremely
qualified for, and needed in, the office,
and because we believe he will make
a great president.

"In order to become organized to
help place him in nomination we here
by enroll for membership in the Palo
Alto Hoover-for-President Republican
Club."

Membership in the organization
may be secured by clipping an en
rollment coupon from the Palo Alto
Times and mailing it to Frank G.
Hoge, temporary secretary. No dues
or money obligationÂ® are connected
with membership.

No attempt has been made in any
way to interfere with the organiza
tion of a similar club at Stanford, but
inquiry has revealed that most of the
professors living on the campus who
are interested in the matter will af
filiate with the Palo Alto group. A
Stanford Hoover-for-President Club
would be looked upon with favor by
the downtown organization, one of its
promoters said yesterday.

Tehporary officers of the Palo Alto
club are E. D. Lakin, president;
Frank G. Hoge, secretary; Ray W.
Smith, treasurer.
