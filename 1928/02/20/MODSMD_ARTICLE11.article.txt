## 
### 
Cardinal yearling baseball men
; opened their season Saturday by tak
j ing a 5-2 victory from the San Mateo
j Junior College team. The stellar work
of Don Story, lanky babe pitcher, was
the feature of the day. He had eleven
strike-outs to his credit when the
j game was over.
San Mateo started off in the first
inning with a batting attack. Barrows,
the first, man up, lined out a single. He
was sacrificed to second. Ward hit a
| three-bagger into left field which
scored Barrows.
j This early lead was maintained for
three innings until the Stanford
freshmen, in the fourth period, scored
' four runs.
Both teams scored again before the
' game ended. Ward was responsible
! for the other San Mateo run when he
I batted out a single in the sixth in
ning to score Hurd. In the seventh,
Stanford scored once more. Hedge
was walked and Magee sacrificed him
to second hase. Hardy then made a
j two-base hit, deep into center field,
i scoring Hedge.
Chuck Teague played a fine game
at first base, as did Dykes Johnson at
short stop and Captain Hunken in
'left field. Magee, Hunken, Hardy, and
Teague were the most consistent
batters.
