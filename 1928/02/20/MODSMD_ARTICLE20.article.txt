# Cardinal Cagers Improve As Bear Games Approach
## Hunt Puts Varsity Through Stiff Scrimmage For Tomorrow's Tilt 
### Merle Emry 
Husky Hunt gave his varsity bas
ketball charges one of the hardest
workouts they have had so far this
season when he put them through
their paces Saturday afternoon in
preparation for the opening game of
the Stanford-California series tomor-1
row night.
Incidentally besides being one of
the stiffest practice sessions, it was
one of the best, according to the
Cardinal coach. The varsity apparent
ly shook off the slump it took on be- 1
fore the U.S.C. games and as a result
Stanfords' hopes for taking the Big
Game series are brighter. The Cardi-'
nals will be given a light corrective
workout in their practice this after- j
noon on passing and basket-shooting. '
Bears Have Advantage
Because of their victories in tliej
past over Stanford basketball teams
and of its winning more games this !
season than the Cardinals, the Cali- ;
fornia Bears are doped on paper to j
win the series. Comparative scores
show both teams to be about equal in
strength, with the Blue and Gold hav
ing the slight edge.
Coach Hunt's men are an unknown
quantity as was shown in the U.S.C.
games when the Cardinals took a ter- j
rific slump in the first game and came j
back to outplay the Trojans the sec-j
ond night, although they lost the con-'
test by two baskets. So predictions I
are apt to be very paradoxical when
based on comparative scores.
Guards Show Ability
In the scrimmage against the fresh
man quintet Saturday afternoon,!
Pother t and Thompson showed out as
a brilliant pair of guards. Bill Clark
was able to find the basket better |
than he has been doing for some
time. On the passing the Cardinals
showed few flaws in their ability to
execute some smooth passing work.
If they can maintain the level thov
are now on the Bears should find the
going rough tomorrow night.
