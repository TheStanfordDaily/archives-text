Some say "Yes," and some say "No," but the question keeps bobbing
up: "Do the grades a college student makes have any bearing on his
future success?" Colonel Robert I. Rees, Assistant Vice-President of the
American Telephone and Telegraph Company, is one of the "Yes" men
(this is not a pun).
Colonel Rees will talk on the subject of "The College Man in Busi
ness" tomorrow afternoon in the Little Theatre. He claims that the "A"
student in college is more apt to be the successful business man than the
"C" student. He substantiates this assertion with figures from his own
company.
Now we know that there are a lot of figures in the telephone company,
but most of the ones we have heard about have been employed to fill
holes in big switchboards. ]t should be interesting to see the ones they
employ to knock holes in the theories that have been expounded to the
effect that it is more often the average student who is the more successful.
if Colonel Rees can prove this point, professors will undoubtedly be
pleased, but the poor, deluded college youth who has gone blithely on his
way, excusing poor marks with the reflection that the grinds don't
usually amount to anything, anyway, will receive quite a blow.
