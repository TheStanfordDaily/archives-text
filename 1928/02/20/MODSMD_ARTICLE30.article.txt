# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
As I was about to onler the sacro
sanct precincts of our library ink
station the other day, I was horribly
shocked by the spectacle of two
lusty roughs throwing liquid missiles
at a harmless fly within. It seemed
to me quite brutal sport as well as a
terrible waste of pen refreshments.
1 wonder; could this be stopped,
dear editor?
A few days later, as I was again
entering this supply-room, a Stanford
Miss unceremoniously brushed me
aside, being, I suppose, in haste to
make a class. But alas! The impa
tient. maiden awkwardly lost hold of
her pen, which immediately nestled
in the opaque pool below! Lest her
piteous gaze should implore to a res
cue, which presaged disaster to my
well-washed hands, I quickly hied
myself elsewhere.
But today the most damnable fea
ture of all came to light! Before pro
ceeding to a lecture, I filled my pen
in this well decorated room; but five
minutes later, within the class room.
I found the ink quite lethargic and
wholly indisposed to stir. T shook
the pen, I cleansed its point with
motherly care, but tho fluid had the
consistency of clay and answered not

to my caresses.
After class, I returned to the li
brary and probed the contents of the
ink wells. After long investigation, it
became apparent that the fluid was a
mixture of deceased insects, tobacco
remnants, once blonde tresses, and
other unmentionable ingredients, all
slightly colored with ink.
Would it be possible, I wonder, to
have these wells divested of their
interesting mementoes, say annually,
by some faculty committee or equally
benevolent group? And at the same
time might not some strings be fas
tened to the wall so that the feminine
patrons could attach their writing in
struments there for safe-keeping?
