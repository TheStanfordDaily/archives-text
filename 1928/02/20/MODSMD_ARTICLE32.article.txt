## SPEAKING FOR THE REST OF US 
### 
One more word on companionate
marriage—and two more 011 the bat
tered cause of freedom of speech and
intellect. One reading the press of
last Friday would have learned that
Mrs. Bertrand Russell, wife of the
brilliant English philosopher, was for
bidden the use of one of the public
halls of the State of Wisconsin for a
discussion of companionate marriage.
Likewise, the University of Wiscon
sin and Union Labor had only barred
portals and stony faces to offer those
who would hear both sides. The
state's action came, we read, follow
ing vigorous protests by "prominent
clergymen and clubwomen." As usual.
On the subject of companionate
marriage itself, we choose to say little
here, only wondering, to stimulate
our own curiosity, if conditions influ
encing marriage have not changed a
lot in the last decade or so. Where
formerly marriage was economically
possible, do not present circum

! stances tend to shove the economic
deadline nearer thirty? We might
| further wonder if there has been any
| biological compensation for this
change. We can see none. Nor can
we see any compensation in the
| minds of a part of our population,
who are still back in the rural days
of "Marry early, my son, and raise a
large family to help with the chores."
But this matter of intellectual free
dom. And this matter of freedom of
speech. What about it, Wisconsin —
and America? Just because your
i churchmen and your clubwomen and
; your labor organizations conclude
that companionate marriage—or any
| other thing under the sun —is a vile
subject, something to be choked and
I suppressed, is it a vile subject and
; must it be choked and must it be
| suppressed? After all, though the
| anti-ites don't seem to know it, there
i are two sides to any question—and
| also, and this is the issue! the con
l formists and the suppressionist aren't

the only people in this realm of ours.
We don't care what anybody thinks
about this subject of companionate
: marriage, but we do defy the assumed
right of any group to block free and
j open discussion on the matter.
Assuming the dispatch to be cor
i reet, we can rather laugh at all the
j talk we heard about the University
, of Wisconsin and the new intellectual
freedom. Freedom spelled with a little
j "f." However, remembering the Lind
i say episode of last fall, we have no
reason to suspect that Mrs. Russell
would have fared any better at Stan
ford. The Committee on Public Exer
| cises, humbled by what "outsiders
! might think," would probably say,
"We would like to have Mrs. Russell,
but we don't think it best in view of
possible, etc."
We wonder if the reasoning, which
| seems to hold that the only people
who have money to donate to a uni
l versity are narrow-minded, is not
! somewhat fallacious? Surely some of
| our millionaires have escaped the
[ spell of the Middle Ages. Suppose
I that Stanford, or some other univer
| sity. should take a fearless stand for
the cause of intellectual freedom and
then stay steadfastly by the ideal, is
it unreasonable to support that ad
miration would not arise in the hearts
I of the free and the forward-looking?
And might not dollars flow into this
i new shrine to maintain and encour
; age this new and priceless thing?
We would like to see it tried. And

the first million dollars we have to
givo to the cause of education goes
to the university that tries it.
