the same tlie world over, and it is
much the same in Turkey as in the
United States," declared Dr. Edgar J.
Fisher, Dean of Robert College in
Constantinople, and acting professor
of history, before members of the
Encina Club last night, speaking un
der the auspices of the Frosh "Y."
Enlarging upon the subject of
"Youth in Turkey," he said that peo
ple in this part of the world have
little realization of the maturity of
young people in the Near East, and
of the hardships and dangers they
have been through. This has tended
to give them a more mature outlook
on life and to make them more seri
ous, giving them a real appreciation
of the spiritual things of life. Dr.
Fisher stated that this has been an
advantage in some respects but a
great disadvantage in others, since
there has been a tremendous loss of
youth as youth.
