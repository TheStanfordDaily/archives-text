# SPORTS OF 1928
## Winged Feet 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Tonight one of the most remarkable
j runners in the world makes his initial ap
pearance in an indoor meet, and under
the colors of the club he will represent
: for some time to come. Wearing the red
and white Winged Foot of the New York
Athletic Club for the first time, Roland i
Locke will be the center of attraction at
; the annual N.Y.A. Games in Madison
i Square Garden, New York, tonight.
Roland Locke, as almost everyone who
! follows sports knows, is the holder of the
j American record for 220 yards at 2UJ/'

seconds, made at Lincoln, Nebraska, on
May 1, 1926. This record, which has not
yet been accepted by the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, is faster
than the world's record of 20 4-5 held by
Charley Paddock. The I.A.A.F. does not
recognize the tenth-of-a-second timing, so
it is doubtful if Locke's record will ever
be an official world's record.
The clever sculptor of ancient Greece
who chiseled out the wonderful statue of
Mercury did not put wings on his sub
ject's sandals because he foresaw that

some day a great athletic club in the
world's metropolis would use a Winged
Foot for its emblem. No, indeed, but Ro
land Locke wearing a Winged Foot is the
height, of propriety, or something, for
Mercury was the patron god of athletes,
and, wearing his winged hat, sandals, and
carrying his "caduceus," represented
speed as he (lew about on the business of
being the herald and ambassador of his

So here's good luck to you, Locke. May
1 you have success indoors equal to your
| success outdoors. And, most of all, may
1 you continue in good health in order to
represent your Uncle Samuel at Am
sterdam in July.
