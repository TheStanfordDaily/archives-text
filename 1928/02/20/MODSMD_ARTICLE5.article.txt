# Santa Clara Nine Downs Cardinals In 6-5 Encounter
## Stanford's Failure to Play "Heads Up" Baseball Costs Game 
### Herb Wenig 
Failure to play heads-up baseball
cost Stanford its first game of the
California Intercollegiate Conference
with Santa Clara last Saturday on
Sodality field, San Jose. The score,
G-5, marked the Broncs' third major
sport victory over the Cards in 1928.
Harry Wolter's baseballers have
themselves to blame for the defeat.
It wasn't so much due to Santa
Clara's ability as to Stanford's lack
of headwork.
Stanford started the game in great
style, turning the initial inning into
an orgy of hits which brought four
runs. Laird's neat throw to first pre
vented a hit in Santa Clara's half of
the inning.
Johnny Casanova replaced S|moni
in the second and performed effec
tively for the rest of the game. The
Broncos put two runs in the second,
and in the next chapter, with the aid
of Falk, made two more to even the
score. Sobieski after the first was
nervous and failed to bear down.
In the third Sims was caught off
second, another reason for the Card,
defeat. The seventh saw Levin try
to steal a base. He started to count
his change near first and was tagged
at second.
Philippi replaced Sobieski in the
fourth but was driven off the mound
in the fifth. Doug Lewis, who re
placed Philippi, pitched good ball for
the remainder of the game.
