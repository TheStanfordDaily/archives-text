"The freshmen were lucky to win
against California last Wednesday,
but they're going to play a much bet
ter brand of basketball in the next
encounter," said Coach "Muggs" Mit
chell in reviewing the Cardinal babes'
chances for a win in the second game
of the annual California-Stanford
freshman series, which will be played
hero Wednesday night.
"With nothing to lose and every
thing to gain," declared Mitchell, "the
babes will probably play a top-notch
game, particularly as the tilt will take
place on their home court."
A victory Wednesday will give the
series to the Cards and will mean that
this year's freshman team will be the
first on record ever to have gone
through a season undefeated. In addi
tion, it will be the first to win the
California series against a team
coached by Clint Evans, present Blue
and Gold freshman cage mentor.
Since the first game Mitchell has
been concentrating practice on the
development of a fast-breaking of
fense, the department of the game in
which the babes were so noticeably
slow last week. There is also a possi
bility that Hepp wilj start the tilt in
the place of Tampcke, who has been
away from school and unable to prac
tice with the team during the past
few days.
