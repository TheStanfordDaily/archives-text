Dear Sirs:
I am a prodigal son.
I began pipe-smoking with Edge
worth. But after a while I began to
wander, trying other tobaccos, experi
menting to see if there were any better
tobacco for the pipe.
I have tried most of the best known
brands and a number of the more ob
scure, both imported and domestic,
but they didn't suit.
So now 1 have returned â€”I am using
Edge worth again, satisfied that no
better tobacco is made.
"And the prodigal son partook of
the fatted calf"; I bought a new pipe
when I returned to Edgeworth.
With many thanks for my cool, mel
low, sweet smokes, I am,
Very truly yours,
"H. D."
