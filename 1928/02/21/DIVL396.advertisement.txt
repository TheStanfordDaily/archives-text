SEEK YE NO FURTHER, DIOGENES . . .
This jobbie Diogenes was a Greek who left bis fruit stand for the commend
able purpose of questing for honesty by good old-fashioned lamp-light. And
now, loud and ever clearer, rings the cry from the housetops: "Diogenes —
throw away your lantern .. . here's an honest cigarette! Have a Camel!"
Camrls have but one raison d* etrc —to pack the smoke-spots of the ivorhl
with the "fill-fullment" every experienced smoker seeks. Fill your own
smoke-spot with a cool cloud of Camel smoke, and hear it sing out—
"Eureka!" (from the Greek, "Eureka," meaning—"Oboy, here 'tis!").
