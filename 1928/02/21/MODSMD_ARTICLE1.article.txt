# STANFORD BASKETBALL TEAM OPENS BEAR SERIES TONIGHT
## Teamwork of Cards May Prevent Starring of Corbin, Ten Eyck HUNT WILL START CLARK Redshirts Are Given Strong Chance to Win Over Blue and Gold 
### Whitney Wright 
With six years of inglorious defeat
at the hands of their traditional rivals
to live down, in but a few short min
utes of play, Stanford's varsity bas
ketball team will take the floor at 8
•o'clock tonight in Kezar Pavilion
against the highly touted California
cagers in the first tilt of the annual
Ilig Series.
Following are the probable starting
line-ups:
Stanford Position California
Vincenti F R. Dougery
Clark F Ten Eyck
Small ing C Corbin
Rothcrt G J. Dougery
Thompson G Gregory
Although odds and figures are
against them, the Cardinal five's case
is far from hopeless. During the sea
son the playing of the Rig Red Ma
chine has fitfully flashed and dimmed,
and if the Golden Rear finds itself
facing the Redshirts in one of their
•good moments, his claws will have to
be mighty sharp to down his ancient
foe.
The Cardinals' chances rest on
teamwork, with Smalling, Vincenti,
and Clark composing the forward
Avail, backed up by Rothert and
Thompson in the defensive berths.
Vincenti lias been improving in every
game, while Clark's recently opened
"shooting eye" has been the wonder
of everyone who has seen the Cards
in recent practice sessions.
