j HAVANA, Feb. 20— (U.P.) — The
Sixth Pan-American Conference was
| buried today under the roses and vio
t lets of generous speeches and kind
farewells.
Born with an expectancy of cultural
and juridicial transactions, the con
ference in the five weeks of its exist
! ence has been, in fact, the most acute
ly political and diplomatic gathering
| the American republics have ever
known.
The United States delegation has
been continually on the defensive.
All who have witnessed the tremen
dous debates on the principle of in
tervention have sensed the challenge
of the Latin peoples lo the people of
the United States and their govern
ment.
Sensing this challenge, the United
States has supported, and the Confer
j ence has approved, the holding of a
conference on arbitration and concili
ation at Washington within a year,
i Events here foreshadow world im
j portance for that conference, which
may determine once and for all
whether the moral union and solidar
ity of the American republics, a cen
; tury under cultivation, is to endure.
As the excitement of political bat
j tie subsides, tiie delegates realize that
many valuable accomplishments have
| resulted from this Sixth Conference.
Private international law has been
codified and a long start has been
| made toward codification of public
, international law. For the first time
! an agreement has been adopted for
I organization of the Pan-American
Union. Commercial avitation will be
I promoted by a new agreement, and a
great number and variety of agree
ments to promote the cultural, tech
| nical, commercial, aud sanitary colla
| boration of the twenty-one American
republics.
