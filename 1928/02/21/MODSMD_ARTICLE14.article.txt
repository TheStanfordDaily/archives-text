Robert I. Rees, assistant vice-presi
dent of the American Telephone and
Telegraph Company, at 4:15 o'clock

Correlation between scholarship and
business success will be discussed.
"Colonel Rees has recently devel
oped striking conclusions from an ex
tensive study of several thousand col

bear out in remarkable fashion the
relationship of high scholarship stand
