There has been considerable controversy in recent years over the
matter of military instruction in schools. Most of the antimilitarists have
been students in slate universities who were forced to take R.O.T.C. when
they did not want it. Along this same argument has come a report from
a staid body of the Old Dominion in Virginia, advising that state funds
be diverted from the Virginia Military Institute, because too much em
phasis is placed 011 the fundamentals of warfare and not enough on cul
tural and vocational education.
The full recommendation of this committee, which was appointed by
the state to investigate methods of improving educational facilities, advo
cates that either the Institute be taken over by private individuals or the
stress be placed on the more civilian activities, if the state continue in
control
In view of the,fact that this institution was established way back in
1839 and its traditions and influence have become so well established, it
is startling to have such a radical move suggested. But the value of the
change is in exact proportion to its radicalism.
Though it is trite to say that the environment in which young men
are brought up has a great deal to do with forming their opinions, it is
true. Thus, the less militarism is taught in schools and organized groups
throughout the world, the less tendency there will be toward militaristic
opinions. The thinking people of the younger generation today do not
want war. Hence they do not want to bother about training for war.
Discipline is aU right; it is necessary to a certain extent. But physical
doesn't always infer mental discipline. That idea went out along with the
theory in psychology of the transmission of faculties.
It is to be hoped that the recommendation of the Virginia commission
meets approval, and then that it is followed up in other states over the
country. Gradually, by education and legislation, it may be possible to
impress the professional patriots and War Department leeches that we
aren't interested in their ballyhoo.
