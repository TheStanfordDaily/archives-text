"Ya'e wants a bulldog; Columbia wants a stadium ; Princeton cries for
the municipal vote"; thus opens an editorial in the Harvard Crimson,
which continues: "Few are the colleges of today whose student news
papers are not standards of liberty and advance agents for the millennium.
Unsolicited criticism is being overdone. Whereas the'organs of under
graduate opinion were once merely antiphonal choruses of faculty senti
ments, they are now upholders of various degrees of insurgency. Give a
student editor an idea, an object which he may view with alarm, and a
typewriter, and within a week he will have raised the foundations of his
college The undergraduate press room has seen and is seeing red."
It's a mighty big relief to see a college paper that is completely satis
fied with its school; it has no kicks; it waves no flags. Yes, sir, the
Crimson Tide was a great football team.
It is hoped, however, for the Tide's sake that such sentiments as are
outlined above don't turn it into a mere Back Bay Backwash.
