Campus men really don't like intel
ligent women, so it is a difficult prob
lem for the girls here to devise means
of hiding it. I mean, of not showing
what they really think of the roughs. !
But of course, when one reads let
ters signed by Bud we realize just j
how futile all our efforts are. That is,:
one man evidently was fooled by his
latest love. I do dislike sour fruit so.
Especially when it sours where others
are forced to hear it.
I really imagine that rustiness is a
thing that the best of men rather
prefer. I mean, no one really has any
honest feeling for a well-oiled girl.
But of course, one can't please every
one, much less two men at the same j
time.
Pleasing other people is certainly 1
something that most college girls i
have to learn. That is, men never take j
a girl out unless she is a good sport,
and good-looking. I mean, they never
seem to realize that the rest of us
have thoughts and feelings, too.

; I'm afraid that Bud will have to go
I on giving vent to his ideas on paper
like he has, because I bet he could
not get a date with a campus girl
anyway.
I guess the best thing for him to
do is to go to little towns about and
get attractive girls from there who
don't have to ride or walk. And who
: are not rustic or rusty.
Perhaps that's why he doesn't like
us.
But, of course, I can't be careful
: about what I think, so I guess I had
better wait until some other time.
