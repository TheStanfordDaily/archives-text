WILL ROGERS, CONGRESSMAN
Southern California, rich in real
estate salesmen, and former lowans,
is the seat of a rumor that is rapidly
making itself felt all over the country.
It may be tersely stated that the well
known mayor of Beverly Hills, Will
Rogers, is being seriously considered
as a Congressional candidate from
California.
Will Rogers' name immediately as
sociates itself in our mind with the
"Follies," "Pep," chewing-gum, droll
humor, and pointed "wisecracks."
However, there is far more to this
ironic Oklahoma cowboy than these
incidents. Behind his naive smile and
drawling humor, lies a mind that is
capable of keen analysis and observa
tion.
Psychologists tell us that there is a
very high correlation between genu
ine humor and intelligence, and the
former requires a high degree of the
latter. If that is any real criterion
of intellectuality, the unquestioned
position of Will Rogers is obvious,
and it may be pointedly said that ad
ditional intelligence would not be
surplusage in either the Senate or the
House.
Coupled with a keen mind is the
ability to size up a situation quickly,
and point out subtle inconsistencies,
and the unnoticed stupidity of the
ultimate results. He is quick to seek
and find the major and minor ab
surdities in our personal and collec
tive conduct and attitude, and in his
inimitable way he calls our foibles
to our attention, and frequently the
truth irks.

However, he would be a dangerous
man to oppose if he were crossed in
a legislative argument. Instead of
talking a House measure to death,
he would send it to a similar fate by
laughing it into some obscure pigeon
hole. The Congressional Record
would have to move to a new printing
plant, and a paid circulation manager
would be substituted for the janitor
who now complains of bending-pains
from carrying out huge quantities of
unread copies of the Record.
Further, Will Rogers is an astute
business man, as his large personal
fortune evidences. He has so cleverly
managed his affairs that a good in
come has grown to be a snug fortune.
He would be above dependence on
moneyed interests, and would be free
to act in accordance with his honest
convictions; truly, a valuable asset
for a Congressman.
Genealogically speaking, he is an
"All-American." His ancestors were
American Indians, but the edge of a
tomahawk has given way to a still
sharper wit and power of observa
tion.
Like Socrates, he is somewhat our
national "gad-ily," and awakens us
from our smug complacency and men
tal lethargy to thought and action.
Whether he ever reaches Washington
as our legislative representative or
not, we are nationally indebted to him
for his stimulating humor, and aid in
cementing the good-will between this
country and Europe, as he did when
he went abroad as "Ambassador with
out portfolio" two years ago.
