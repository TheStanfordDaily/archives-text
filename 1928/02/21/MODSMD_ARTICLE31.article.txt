"Jalna," Mazo de la Roche. Little,
Brown & Co.
"Jalna," besides being one of the
most-talked-of books of the present
time, has a claim for recognition in
being the Atlantic Prize Novel for
last year. To most of us a book that
has won a ten thousand dollar prize
is an object of curiosity, and fortu
nately, "Jalna" fully repays with in
terest any investiment in time.
For some years now the most popu
lar theme for any self-respecting two
dollar book has been illicit love, and
the popular theme for controversy,
whether it is moral or immoral. To
our minds the dawning of such emo
tions is infinitely more appetizing, in
teresting, readable, and artistic than
the dissolving. And its relative im
morality depends entirely on the cir
cumstances of the tale, whether they
are ordinary or extraordinary.
Both of these requirements "Jalna"
passes with dim colors. It is really a
remarkably well-done book. The mor
bid, sinister atmosphere of the old
English pioneer home, with its queer
tribe of inhabitants, is done so sim
ply that you are unconscious of any
technique. Yet you have cold premoni
tory chills up and down your spine
for chapters before you sense the
real trend of the story.
When the girl Alayne enters the
strange household — the household
dominated by old Mrs. Whiteoak, in
her nineties, with her parrot "Boney,"
and the military arrogance of another
century—there is no need for Miss
de la Roche to explain her reactions.
You have been the only normal hu
man in that queer perverted atmos
phere, for the one hundred odd pages

, before the entrance of Alayne, and
j you sympathize readily with the emo
| tional gamut she is forced to run.
"Jalna" is not a pleasant book, but
it is a remarkable one, which is a
rarer virtue. Aside from the extraor
dinary atmosphere of the novel, it has
an unusually fine development of in
, tensity. The psychological aspects of
the characters are scientifically near
perfect—but, thank heaven! not ex
j plained in the curious footnote man
i
ner so many writers consider essen
tial.
j
How anyone could read it when it
appeared in serial form and stand the
j strain, we do not understand. We
; stayed up till three o'clock one night
j to finish it! —H.K.

being the Atlantic Prize Novel for
last year. To most of us a book that
has won a ten thousand dollar prize
is an object of curiosity, and fortu
nately, "Jalna" fully repays with in
terest any investiment in time.
For some years now the most popu
lar theme for any self-respecting two
dollar book has been illicit love, and
the popular theme for controversy,
whether it is moral or immoral. To
our minds the dawning of such emo
tions is infinitely more appetizing, in
teresting, readable, and artistic than
the dissolving. And its relative im
morality depends entirely on the cir
cumstances of the tale, whether they
are ordinary or extraordinary.
Both of these requirements "Jalna"
passes with dim colors. It is really a
remarkably well-done book. The mor
bid, sinister atmosphere of the old
English pioneer home, with its queer
tribe of inhabitants, is done so sim
ply that you are unconscious of any
technique. Yet you have cold premoni
tory chills up and down your spine
for chapters before you sense the
real trend of the story.
When the girl Alayne enters the
strange household — the household
dominated by old Mrs. Whiteoak, in
her nineties, with her parrot "Boney,"
and the military arrogance of another
century—there is no need for Miss
de la Roche to explain her reactions.
You have been the only normal hu
man in that queer perverted atmos
phere, for the one hundred odd pages

, before the entrance of Alayne, and
j you sympathize readily with the emo
| tional gamut she is forced to run.
"Jalna" is not a pleasant book, but
it is a remarkable one, which is a
rarer virtue. Aside from the extraor
dinary atmosphere of the novel, it has
an unusually fine development of in
, tensity. The psychological aspects of
the characters are scientifically near
perfect—but, thank heaven! not ex
j plained in the curious footnote man
i
ner so many writers consider essen
tial.

How anyone could read it when it
appeared in serial form and stand the
j strain, we do not understand. We
