# COACH WOLTER GIVES FRESHMAN BASEBALL MEN LIGHT WORKOUT
## 
### 
Freshman baseball practice last
nibht was slow and uninteresting but
can be attributed to a regular after
game let-down. Coach Harry Wolter
led the men in a light batting and
infield practice. The former was fairly
lively but the infield work was slow
and inaccurate.
The infield combination that has
been working together most of the
season, namely Teague, Magee, John
son, and Hedge, will remain un
changed as a result of its fine show
ing in the San Mateo game Saturday.
According to Wolter, this is hte best
aggregation that he has coached since
coming to Stanford.
Stanford's reputed weakness in bat
ting was dispelled Saturday. No
team that could put on a real slug
ging attack as the babes did in the
fourth inning could be declared to
have poor offensive. In that one in
ning the team batted clear through
its batting order and scored four
runs.
The yearlings will meet Lowell
High School next Saturday morning
at 10:30 o'clock on the freshman
field.
