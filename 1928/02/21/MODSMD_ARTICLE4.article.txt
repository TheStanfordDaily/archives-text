# ELECTION RESULTS WILL BE REPORTED IN BULLETIN ISSUE
## 
### 
Tonight a bulletin containing
the A.S.S.U. and class election
returns will be issued as soon
as the ballots are counted and
the election board has turned in
the totals. This special edition
of the Daily, which will contain
no other news besides election
returns, will probably be deliv
ered at the halls and houses
about 7:30 or 8 o'clock.
As tomorrow is Washington's
birthday, and the only Univer
sity holiday during winter quar
ter, no classes will be held and
no Daily will appear.
