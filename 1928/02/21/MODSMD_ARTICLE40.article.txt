## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team will again attempt to prove its
supremacy over the Cubs of the
Golden Bear, when it goes into action
against its Blue and Gold rivals in
the second game of their annual
three-game scries in the Stanford
Pavilion at 8 o'clock tomorrow night.
The Californians will enter the
fracas with the series at stake, and
will be playing on a strange floor,
already having been defeated on their
own; while the Redshirts will en
ter without the nervousness that
marred their playing in the first tilt
and with everything to gain by a win.
Coach "Muggs" Mitchell hopes by
the substitution of Hepp for Tampcke
to speed up the Cardinal offense,
since fast breaking depends almost
entirely on the guards. Hepp is a
clever player and wastes no time in
passing the ball down the floor.
A preliminary game between the
faculty and the Palo Alto Exchange
Club will be played at 7 o'clock. The
faculty line-up includes Charles
Davis and Taylor, forwards, Smith,
center, and Sprague and Hal Davis,
guards.
Following are the probable start

Stanford Position California
Fawcett F Granger
Hawkins F Pidgeon
