# SPORTS OF 1928
## Neptune's Daughter 
### BY "FEG MURRAY. '16 
Less than nineteen years ago there was
born in far-off Sweden a girl-child who
was to develop into the greatest speed
swimmer of her sex the world has ever
seen. Her father, a prominent swimming
instructor and physical culturist, deter
mined that his daughter was to be a star
athlete, and he developed her slowly and
wisely so that today she is a more ac
complished swimmer than Gertrude Ed
erle was at the same age, and has erased
all but a couple of the famous Trudie's
records from the books.
You will hear of this girl often this

year, for she will be the mainstay of the
United States women's swimming team
at Antwerp. Just at present she is com
peting in the women's senior indoor cham
pionships at Buffalo, defending her titles,
I won a year ago, at 100, 200, and 500
j yards, and the 400 yards relay. Martha
■ Oorelius, for that is the name of the
young mermaid, also holds the outdoor
| championships at 100 meters, 440 and 880
yards, and one mile, 880-yard relay and
long distance team race. (The last two
j titles, of course, she shares with her team
j mates from the Women's Swimming As

sociation of New York.) There never
was a youngster who could cut the water
as she does, or who shows the form, stam
ina, versatility, and fight that arc so well
combined in this sturdy Scandinavian
miss.
Martha surprised everyone by winning
the 400-meter free-style race at the Paris
Olympics in 1924, defeating Gertrude
Ederle. She seems a cinch to repeat at
Amsterdam this summer.
