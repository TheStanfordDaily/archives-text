# SEAT SALE CONTINUES FOR MASQUERS PLAY UNTIL LAST OF WEEK
## "Romantic Young Lady" Cast Has Been Rehearsing For Seven Weeks 
### 
Seats for "The Romantic Young j
Lady," by G. Martinez Siorra, which â– 
will be produced March 2 under the |
auspices of Masquers Society, are
still obtainable at the Dramatic j
Council office in the Old Union. They :
will continue to be available until the !
end of the week.
Rehearsal work is going on in the
play itself, in spite of the second
postponement. The play has now
been in rehearsal for seven weeks,
which raises a problem in maintain
ing the spontaneity of the simple i
comedy. To offset this difficulty, in-J
tensive work on the major parts of i
the play will be concentrated on the j
last week before the production.
With this play, Kathleen Filz will
make her appearance in a role quite
different from the ones she has ap
peared in heretofore. Although she |
has played several roles on the cam- j
pus, varying from the heroine of j
"The Rook of Charm," to feature num-1
hers in Football Gaieties, this will be !
the first truly ingenue role she has j
played.
This is contrasted by Paul Pfaff, j
who, as the Apparition, plays the
masculine The Apparition is a
prominent and successful Spanish
novelist, who is particularly popular
for his charming stories and ro
mances.
