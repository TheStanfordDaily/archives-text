# Stanford, Pacific Teams Debate On Results Of War
## 
### Hubert Gagos 
Stanford's varsity affirmative squad
| met a team of the College of the
j Pacific in the Little Theatre last
I night in a no-decision debate on the
I subject, "Resolved, That the results
jof the World War have tended to
! ward peace." At the same time a
! negative team met a College of the
Pacific affirmative team in Stockton
on the same subject.
The Stanford team contended that
the social, economic, and political re
sults of the war furthered the feeling
toward peace.
The negative team pointed out that
Fascism, Soviet Russia, and the
armed condition of France indicated
I a condition that would lead to even
tual war. It also refuted the affirma
, live argument concerning the efficacy
of the League of Nations in promot
ing world peace'. Speeches on both
sides were marked by humor and
satire. Wesley Sawyer, of the College
of the Pacific, was the ablest speaker
j on the negative side. Speaking honors
; for Stanford were well divided among
| the three debaters.
The Stanford team in the order of
| speaking was as follows: Paul Her
j bold. Arthur Angel, and Herbert
! Wenig. The Stockton team was com
| posed of Wesley Sawyer, Lucile
Threlfall, and Charles Schleicher,
j Stanford's team followed its argu
: ments to a more logical conclusion.
Professor Anthony F. Banks was
chairman of the evening.
