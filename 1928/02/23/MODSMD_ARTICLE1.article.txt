# BEARS DOWN CARDS 31-25 IN FIRST BIG SERIES GAME
## Seven-Point Lead Built Up By Stanford With Five Minutes to Play TILT LOST IN LAST HALF U.C. Turns Tide of Battle in Final Spurt With Six Additional Tallies 
### 
After outplaying California and |
leading in the scoring from the start 1
almost to the close of the game, |
Stanford lost the first contest of the
Big Series 31-25 Tuesday night when
the struggling Bear broke the Cardi
nals' strangle hold in the last two
minutes of play and crashed through 1
with six points to end a bitterly I
"waged battle.
Tradition holds that there can be j
no predictions made 011 the outcome
of a Stanford-California game and J
tradition was right for Stanford care
j
fully built up a seven-point lead with |
five minutes to go when the score
stood 23 to IG. The few Stanford
rooters in Kezar Pavilion were |
anxious for the timer's gun to give
them victory but in less than two J
minutes they saw the score tied at j
first 23 to 23 and then at 25 to 25, and
In two minutes more they saw the |
rejuvenated Bear take a lead of six
points, and when the timer's gun j
finally did sound, the score stood 31 ,
to 25 in favor of California.
The Cardinals started out with a
whirlwind attack in the first half in 1
which the Bears were outplayed on
both the defense and offence. Vincenti j i
opened the scoring on a short pass ; 1
from Smalling and this diminutive j
forward later scored eight points j:
more out of a total of the team's
fourteen. California was never ahead 11
during this half due to the inability j 1
of its players to hit the basket. The J
Stanford guards, Rothert. and Thomp- j
son, played stellar ball, as did Clark j
at the forward position. The half |
j ended with the score 14 to 11 in favor
j of the Cardinals.
Coming back in the second period
J with as stiff a pace as they set in
the first half, the Cards steadily
pulled away from the fighting Cali
fornia players. Smalling put the ball
through the hoop on an overhead
I shot, making the score 18 to 13. With
a free throw counted by Clark and a
long basket shot by Thompson fol
lowed by another basket by Vincenti,
| the Cardinals were at their peak, lead
ing by seven points. Then the sudden
California attack began, featured
j largely by the Dougery brothers and
1 Corbin, center. Berg was substituted
for Clark but Stanford was unable to
i stop the first and only spurt of super
ior basketball shown by the Bears.
Altogether the game was a fight
from the start to the finish with four
teen fouls being called on both teams,
each squad making seven. The Cardi
nals had their shooting gloves on as
evidenced* by the fact that they
missed only one of their seven
; chances for foul shots.
