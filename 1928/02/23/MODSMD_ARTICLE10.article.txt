# BABE QUINTET DEFEATED BY U.C. CAGEMEN
## Granger of California Sinks Five Field Goals During Closing Minutes 
### Whitney Wright 
After coming from behind to tie
the score at 18-18 within four minutes
of the final gun, Stanford's heretofore
undefeated freshman basketball team
went down to an inglorious defeat at
the hands of the California babes last
night to the tune of 22 to 30, when
"Swede" Granger, bear forward, drop
ped five field goals through the hoop
in quick succession to put his team
safely in the lead.
The first half was a ragged affair
featured by fouls and poor shooting.
The scoring was started about a min
ute after the opening of the game
when Burl Hawkins of Stanford tap
ped a follow-up shot through the bas
ket, which was followed by a foul
shot by Mears. The Bear babes then
began sinking goals from all angles,
until Watkins, star center, was taken
from the game on four fouls.
U.C. Leads at Half
Tampcke was substituted for Hepp
and Moffatt for Hawkins. This change
seemed to do the Cardinal yearlings
good, for they immediately began to
show signs of life and brought their
end of the scoring up, the half ending
9 to 14 in favor of the Blue and Gold,
however.
The second half began disastrously
for the Cardinals when Mears, cen
ter, was taken out on fouls. Hawkins
was substituted in his place and
Joujon-Roche in the place of Fawcett,
who seemed unable to get off his feet.
This combination put the needed
fight in the game and succeeded in
tieing the score at IS-IS.
It was at this crucial moment that
a lanky Bear forward by the name of
Granger proceeded to give the rooters
one of the prettiest exhibitions of
shooting that has been seen in the
Stanford Pavilion for some time. Five
times he tossed the ball from difficult
angles and each time it dropped
through the basket with a little flick
that spelled doom for the lagging
Cardinals. Hepp sunk a long shot for
the Stanford team, but too late to
save the day.

honors for the Stanford team. Gran

went down to an inglorious defeat at
the hands of the California babes last
night to the tune of 22 to 30, when
"Swede" Granger, bear forward, drop
ped five field goals through the hoop
in quick succession to put his team
safely in the lead.
The first half was a ragged affair
featured by fouls and poor shooting.
The scoring was started about a min
ute after the opening of the game
when Burl Hawkins of Stanford tap
ped a follow-up shot through the bas
ket, which was followed by a foul
shot by Mears. The Bear babes then
began sinking goals from all angles,
until Watkins, star center, was taken
from the game on four fouls.
U.C. Leads at Half
Tampcke was substituted for Hepp
and Moffatt for Hawkins. This change
seemed to do the Cardinal yearlings
good, for they immediately began to
show signs of life and brought their
end of the scoring up, the half ending
9 to 14 in favor of the Blue and Gold,
however.
The second half began disastrously
for the Cardinals when Mears, cen
ter, was taken out on fouls. Hawkins
was substituted in his place and
Joujon-Roche in the place of Fawcett,
who seemed unable to get off his feet.
This combination put the needed
fight in the game and succeeded in
tieing the score at IS-IS.
It was at this crucial moment that
a lanky Bear forward by the name of
Granger proceeded to give the rooters
one of the prettiest exhibitions of
shooting that has been seen in the
Stanford Pavilion for some time. Five
times he tossed the ball from difficult
angles and each time it dropped
through the basket with a little flick
that spelled doom for the lagging
Cardinals. Hepp sunk a long shot for
the Stanford team, but too late to
save the day.
Reynolds Stars
Captain Mike Reynolds stood out
among his teammates, playing a
steady, heads-up game during the en
tire contest and taking high-point
honors for the Stanford team. Gran
ger was high-point man of the eve
ning with 14 tallies to his credit.
