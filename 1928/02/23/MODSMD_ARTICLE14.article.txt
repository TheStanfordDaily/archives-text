# House-Wife Complains Of Lawlessness, Defies Ruling Herself
## 
### 
A new phase of the campus
auto situation was brought to
light this week when a campus
housewife complained to Roy
Button, Superintendent of Build
ings and Grounds, that it was raw
ineconomy for the University to
invest in arterial highway stop
signs when they were not en
forced.
The lady was so disturbed
about this lawlessness that But
ton promised her he would take
action. An officer posted at a
stop-sign recorded eleven infrac
tions of the law by the fifty-two
machines which passed.
It happened that two of these
violations were made by the lady
who complained. And although
the officer made no arrests, not
wishing to spoil the fun, Button
declares that a heavy penalty
awaits the next offender who is
caught.
