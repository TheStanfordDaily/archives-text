# STANFORD LIT TO BE SENT TO SUBSCRIBERS
## 
### 
An unusually attractive frontispiece
by Morgan Stedinan features the,
February number of the Stanford
Literary Magazine which will be sent
out to subscribers this afternoon. The
Quad sale will be held tomorrow.

Another particular feature of this
issue is an article called "These Col
lege Magazines," written by Professor
Frederick Anderson of the French
Department. In the article, which is
a criticism of the January number
of the Lit, Professor Anderson dwells
upon the faults of last month's issue,
at the same time praising its triumph
over dullness, which he says is in
itself no small achievement.
