# VARSITY NINE BEATS SAINTS AFTER GREAT RALLY 8 TO 9
## Contest Is Ragged for First Seven Innings With St. Mary's in Lead SOBIESKI KNOCKS HOMER Stanford Uses Five Pitchers During Tilt; Opponents Send in Three 
### Herbert Wenig 
What a rally!
Pacing defeat with a 5-0 score
against them, Stanford's baseballers
staged a wild rally in the eighth in
ning that drove two Saints pitchers
from the mound, brought in eight
runs, culminated in Sobicski's win
ning homer in the ninth, and beat St.
Mary's varsity 9-8 yesterday in the
first home lot game of the league sea
son.
It had been a slow, ragged game
for seven innings, with St. Mary's
having the best of the hitting and
pitching. Hamilton, Saint chucker,
maintained a baffling pace that fooled
the boys unlil they solved him in the
first of the long-to-be-remembered
eighth. The procession of men mak
ing the circuit was only rivaled by
the march of pitchers to the shower
room. Harry Wolter used five hurlers,
while Slip Madigan employed three.
From this standpoint it was indeed a
pitchers' battle.
Doug Lewis started for the Cards.
Up to the time he went out in the
fifth lie didn't walk or fan anyone.
Dondero traveled the circuit in the
second with a nice drive over left
field fence. From then on to the end
of the seventh the Saints got an
average of a hit a chapter. Hamilton
pulled himself out of several tight
places, leaving nine Cardinals on the
bags during his regime. Philippi
pitched for Stanford until the end of
the seventh, when he was relieved
by Riese.
With the clouds of defeat fast clos
ing in on the Cards Garibaldi, in the
memorable eighth, broke them with a
single to find the silver lining. Next
Sypher and Levin walked, and Gari
baldi walked in when Laird shoved
him ahead by being hit with a pitched
ball. Spud Harder knocked a hot
grounder to right, tallying Sypher
and Levin. Wilton fanned and Bush
flied to center, but Sims drove a long
one to center, bringing in Laird and
Marks, who was running for Harder.
Dana then replaced O'Keefe for St.
Mary's. It made little difference, for
Garibaldi poled a three-bagger to
score Maguire, and later Sypher
brought in Garibaldi, malting the in
ning's total 8 runs.
In the ninth, with an extra frame
in sight, "Count" Sobieski put his
weight behind one of Dana's offerings,
sending it over the left field fence.
