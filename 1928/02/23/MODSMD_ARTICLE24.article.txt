# REES GIVES TALK ON FUTURE OF COLLEGE STUDENT IN BUSINESS
## 
### 
"It is wise if possible to make your
first position permanent," said Col
onel Robert I. Rees, vice-president of
the American Telephone and Tele
graph Company, in a lecture Tuesday
on "The College Man in Business."
Colonel Rees backed his statement
with a graph showing that those men
who entered the Bell company within
two years after their graduation
made more progress in position ac
cording to salary than did those who
started more than two years after re
ceiving their degrees. "This does not
apply to changing from one company
to another, but from one occupation
to another," he added.
The practical use of a college edu
cations is shown by another of Col
onel Rees' graphs which indicate that
the college man can reach a salary of
$12,000 in nine years' less time than
the man without a college education.
