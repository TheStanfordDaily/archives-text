In reference to an editorial appearing in this column on the 21st, en
titled "Mutiny in the Ranks," the Daily received a communication em
bodying the following:
1. I wish to correct a faulty conclusion appearing in (the above
editorial). Quote, "The thinking people of the younger generation
today do not want war. Hence they do not want to bother about
training for war."
2. The Bank of Palo Alto does not want to be robbed. Hence
the Bank of Palo Alto does not want to bother about making proper
preparations to prevent being robbed.
3. Such logic is absurd. Such editorials are not only worthless,
but harmful.
4. Specifically, to whom do you refer by the expressions "pro
fessional patriots" and "War Department leeches"?"
JOHN H. BLACKBURN, II
Before answering specifically points 1. 2, 3, and 4 of Mr. Blackburn's
letter, it would be well to recall that the editorial referred to all the
younger generation, not merely Americans, that it praised the recom
mendation of a certain educational commission in Virginia which was to
the effect that the Virginia Military Institute ought to lay emphasis upon
education rather than militarism, and that its conclusion was that by edu
cation and legislation it might be possible gradually to "impress the pro
fessional patriots and War Department leeches that we aren't interested
in their ballyhoo."
Then to point No. 1: Let it be said that this is not a conclusion, worked
out by logic from a major premise; it is a fact. Witness, there are 383
Stanford students enrolled in the Military Department. Figure out your
own percentage, and then deduct the number interested only in learning
to ride horseback.
On to No. 2, of which it may be said that anybody can reduce the
best logic to an absurdity by parallels. It is a trick the ancient Greeks used
when reduced to desperation by facts they could not refute.
No. 3 : Flatterer !
And finally No. 4: These opprobrious terms apply to a great army of
individuals who earn money on lecture platforms and such by preaching
patriotism, or who solicit sentiment votes by the same method. They also
apply to those individuals who have much to gain, financially, from wars.
The point is, these people are apt to be a trifle biased in favor of their
own occupations.
It has come to the attention of the Daily that Mr. Blackburn is an
ensign in the U.S. Navy, and his father a naval officer. Perhaps this
would tend to. confirm our trite observation in the editorial in question,
that "the environment in which young men are brought up has a great deal
to do with forming their opinions . . . ."

fessional patriots and War Department leeches that we aren't interested
in their ballyhoo."
Then to point No. 1: Let it be said that this is not a conclusion, worked
out by logic from a major premise; it is a fact. Witness, there are 383
Stanford students enrolled in the Military Department. Figure out your
own percentage, and then deduct the number interested only in learning
to ride horseback.
On to No. 2, of which it may be said that anybody can reduce the
best logic to an absurdity by parallels. It is a trick the ancient Greeks used
when reduced to desperation by facts they could not refute.
No. 3 : Flatterer !
And finally No. 4: These opprobrious terms apply to a great army of
individuals who earn money on lecture platforms and such by preaching
patriotism, or who solicit sentiment votes by the same method. They also
apply to those individuals who have much to gain, financially, from wars.
The point is, these people are apt to be a trifle biased in favor of their
own occupations.
It has come to the attention of the Daily that Mr. Blackburn is an
ensign in the U.S. Navy, and his father a naval officer. Perhaps this
would tend to. confirm our trite observation in the editorial in question,
that "the environment in which young men are brought up has a great deal
to do with forming their opinions . . . ."
In reference to an editorial appearing in this column on the 21st, en
titled "Mutiny in the Ranks," the Daily received a communication em
bodying the following:
1. I wish to correct a faulty conclusion appearing in (the above
editorial). Quote, "The thinking people of the younger generation
today do not want war. Hence they do not want to bother about
training for war."
2. The Bank of Palo Alto does not want to be robbed. Hence
the Bank of Palo Alto does not want to bother about making proper
preparations to prevent being robbed.
3. Such logic is absurd. Such editorials are not only worthless,
but harmful.
4. Specifically, to whom do you refer by the expressions "pro
fessional patriots" and "War Department leeches"?"
JOHN H. BLACKBURN, II
Before answering specifically points 1. 2, 3, and 4 of Mr. Blackburn's
letter, it would be well to recall that the editorial referred to all the
younger generation, not merely Americans, that it praised the recom
mendation of a certain educational commission in Virginia which was to
the effect that the Virginia Military Institute ought to lay emphasis upon
education rather than militarism, and that its conclusion was that by edu
cation and legislation it might be possible gradually to "impress the pro
fessional patriots and War Department leeches that we aren't interested
in their ballyhoo."
