Recently the Student Council at Cornell caused considerable stir
among the students when it decided that the minutes of its meetings were
not to be published. This pronunciamento came after various questions as
to what the Council was doing. They said, "It is nobody's business."
Fortunately, students at Stanford do not need to wonder what their
Executive Committee is doing. It is the custom, strictly adhered to, that
all minutes shall be published in the Daily. Members of the student body
are welcome at any time to attend the weekly sessions.
This is as it should be. It is as valuable to the Committee, itself, as to
the students, that all of its doings be known. Often there is nothing of
a vital character to accomplish, but at other times matters of interest to
everyone are discussed and decided. If people don't like what the Com
mittee is doing, or has done, they may say so, not only through the Campus
Opinion column of the Daily, but personally to the governing group.
Men's Council and Women's Council, though their activities must
necessarily be less public because of the very personal matters they handle,
might find themselves in a more respected position if they would adopt a
more open policy. These groups control the disciplinary measures of the
men and women of the University.
Ofie of the theories of discipline is that the knowledge of what will
happen in case one does such-and-such will cause one to forbear. If this
is true, would not the Councils do more good by publishing, without names,
the pqnishments they mete out, together with the reasons therefor? This
has been done to some extent in the past, but recently such information has
lieen well-nigh impossible to obtain. The Councils might talk this over at
their next meetings.
