### 
An address recently given at Stan
ford by a distinguished scientist
brings forcibly to mind the fallacy
that seems to be so deeply ingrained
in American thinking, namely, that
because a man is outstanding in one
particular line of human endeavor, he
is thereby qualified to discuss almost
any and all other lines, and be
listened to as an oracle. There 'is
every reason, on the contrary, to as
sume that the very specialization
which has made him pre-eminent in
his chosen work will serve to make
him less able comprehensively and
completely to survey the total field of
human knowledge. Those fitted to be
critics and interpreters of life in gen
eral, the philosophers of social rela
tionship and change, pay for their
breadth of conception by a lack of
minute and particular information.
They must of necessity build from
and synthesize their ideas from the
information contributed by the ad
vance guards on many widely sepa-

rated frontiers of knowledge. Quite
naturally the explorer knows immeas
urably more at first hand about that
part of the earth's terrain which he
has discovered and mapped out than
can the geographers. But the geogra
pher may be expected to have a far
better picture of the whole.
Would it not, after all, be a men
ace if science should come to be self
conscious, to be aware of its particu
lar mission in the world, to strive to
work out a particular destiny, instead
of retaining the very characteristic
that marks it today from almost every
other field of human endeavor —its
disinterested pursuit of the facts of
the outward universe, independent of
whatever consequences may develop?
On the whole it seems best and
safest to listen to "exact" scientists
talking on what goes on inside sci
ence, and to hearken respectfully to
the words of the inexact scientists —
sociologists, social psychologists, his-
and even "humanists" on
hither we are drifting and why.
