OUTREACHED
The longer arms and the superior
height of the California guards, Greg
ory and Jim Dougery, seemed to us
to be the telling factor which finally
brought the Bears the victory in the
first game of the Big Series at Kezar
Tuesday night.
As long as Harlow Rothert and Red
Thompson were live on their feet and
able and willing to outleap, outrun,
and outfight Dougery and Gregory,
they kept the California forwards
from within good shooting distance
of the goal, and thereby allowed
Stanford to take, and remain in, the
lead. But when they weakened
through sheer fatigue at the time-out
period which preceded the Bears'
drive to the fore, it was seen that
the Cardinal colors would be forced
to dip.
Being smaller than their two
giant opponents, Rothert and
Thompson had to extend them
selves more, and in so doing tired
themselves after that
happened, the California forwards
and center shot baskets with
regularity from positions on the
court at which earlier in the
game Rothert and Thompson had
never let them arrive unguarded.

HORATIO ALGER STUFF
The rise of Rothert and Thompson
to the positions of first ; string guards
on the varsity is one of the most
astonishing things that Stanford ath
letic followers have to talk about.
Thompson played neither in high
school nor as a first-string freshman
here; Rothert did not compete in high
school. Both are good students of
the game and both played basketball
Tuesday night of which any two m<*n
of their size could afford to be proud.

There has been much comment
about Husky Hunt's inserting
Bill Clark into the line-up as Vin
centi's mate at forward. Since his
knee injury last year, Clark has
not hit his stride and has failed
all season to score with consis
tency. Nevertheless, we think
Clark's being in the line-up was
justified, for his experienced bas
ketball judgment counted for a
lot. Even a team that has ability
may well go to pieces at a critical
point in a game with California,
because of the lack of experi
enced heads to keep things going
as calmly as possible. Clark's
floor-play was valuable also, and
one must remember that every
time Vincenti or Smalling shot a
basket, someone had to pass the
ball to the shooter.

Anyhow, the Bears came within an
ace of losing the game, and if breaks
come to Stanford, the tide will turn
our way in Friday night's tilt.
