Washington is standing in the bow
of an overladen boat, thereby need
lessly obstructing the view of the

P.S.: My roommate tells me that
one of our later historians is author

so "teed up" that night that he
threatened to jump overboard when
they told him to sit down —so they
let him stand.

AND NOW WE KNOW THE
ORIGIN OP THAT OLD COMMAND,
"SIT DOWN, YOU'RE ROCKING
THE BOAT!"
