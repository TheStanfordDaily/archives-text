# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Someone who by mistake read "And
Then Our Little (?) Sally," thinking
it was "Campus Opinion" told me that
Sally had at last found sufficient
courage or oil to reply to my letter.
Yes, it is very difficult for Our
Little (?) Sally not to show how
much she thinks of the roughs, and I
knew that she was in search of a
date after I heard of her desire for a
cabin back in the hills away from
constraint and bicycles.
Well, I had a date with Sally and
is she not a typical romantic young
lady? But really this is not the rea
son there is so much smir fruit around
—the play should be very good. As I
was saying, she is so very romantic;
I mean that is why I have so much
fun giving vent to my ideas on paper.
That is, did you ever try to get a
word in edgewise?
I hope that Sally denies that I had
a date with her; I mean perhaps then
I could get a date with the puritan
istic campus girls, —"Bud."
