# IMPORTANCE OF ART DISCUSSED BY CLARK IN LECTURE TUESDAY
## 
### 
"Every educated person should con
sider where art belongs in his life,"
declared Professor Arthur B. Clark,
of the Department of Education
(Graphic Art) at a meeting of the
Mothers Club in the Women's Club
house Tuesday.
"Our department here considers
the problem of meeting the condi
tions of actual life rather than that
of making professionals," Professor
Clark continued, outlining briefly ihe
work of the different classes, and
showing examples of the type of work
accomplished. "The value lies in the
appreciation itself; it is a matter of
judgment, of perception. If you can
think straight, you can draw straight.
We teach our students to use their
minds, to get intelligence into their
work.
"Art is not the flower of civiliza
tion, any more than it is the seed.
It gives emotional and intellectual
joy; emotional feeling is its basic
quality. The idea that literature is
the end of learning is a misconcep
tion. Thoughts may be expressed in
pottery or painting as well as in
words."
