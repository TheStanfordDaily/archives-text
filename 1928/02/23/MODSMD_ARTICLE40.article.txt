Play in the intramural basketball
tournament proved slow in the few
games over the holiday. Several of
the tilts were postponed by mutual
agreement and several more were de
faulted. Cellar teams were the op
ponents in a majority of the games
and little interest was shown in these
contests.
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
sports, announced last night that
games that were postponed may be
played at 2 o'clock, 2:45 o'clock, or
3:25 o'clock tomorrow afternoon pro
vided that team managers see him
before noon today. Otherwise the
games will stand as a zero to zero
tie. *
In the lead-off game Tuesday, Theta
Xi defeated Theta Chi 24-10 in a slow
contest. The half-time score was 12-4.
All Blacks defeated Encina 4E in
a fairly fast but ragged tilt 19-12.
Worsley of Encina was high-point
man with eleven tallies to his credit.
Poor passing and shooting were fea
tures throughout the contest.
Delta Kappa Epsilon forfeited to
Encina 2E.
Indians swamped Encina 3W in the
firrt game last night by the score of
42-7. The freshmen were unable to
get near the basket and most of their
points were the results of long shots.
Allison was high tally man with 21
points to his credit.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon forfeited to
Sequoia I.
