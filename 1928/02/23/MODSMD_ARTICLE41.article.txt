# CARD MERMEN DROP EDGE TO CALIFORNIA BY LOSS OF STRONG
## 
### 
With Cal Strong, varsity water polo
captain, in the hospital because of
sinus trouble, the Cardinal polo J
team's chances against California !
Saturday take a decided drop. Ull- j
til this possible loss occurred, the j
Stanford team was given the edge
over the Bears in the contest to be i
played Saturday in Encina pool at i
2:30 o'clock.
If Strong is back in play, he and j
Harrison and Thornton will form the
backbone of the varsity team. Reggie 1
Harrison, a forward of national repu- j
tation, has played for several years
on the famous Venice team with Nor
ton Thornton, goalkeeper. Strong is
recognized as having one of the best
throwing arms on the Coast, which
he developed playing guard for sev
eral years on the Long Beach team.
Harrison is a sure goal-scorer when
he gets the ball, fed by Strong and
the rest of the team, and an unusually
strong offensive is developed. Vanden
Akker and Burns are men developed
by Brandsten into accurate forwards,
and Driggs and Maltby are also Stan
ford products of good calibre.
