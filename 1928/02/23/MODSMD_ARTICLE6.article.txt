â€¢ cal novelty of the season, the English
Singers of London will present their
unique program of Elizabethan choral
music in the Pavilion at 8:15 o'clock
tonight under the auspices of the As
sociated Students.
The finish and polish of the sex
tette and its manner of informal de
livery have earned for the organiza
tion an enviable reputation this sea
son. Tonight's appearance will be the
third made by the English Singers in
the bay region, and press reports of
the preceding recitals have been vir
tual eulogies.
The madrigals, folk-songs, ballets,
and canzonets of Old England that
the sextette sings are notable for
their directness and simplicity. No
accompaniment is used and the, keen

| sense of musical proportion and in
stinct, for the significance of polypho
j nic phrasing which keeps the essen
tial melodic fragament always in the
foreground forms one of the most
I striking and vital elements in the art
; of these singers.
Olin Downes, music critic of the
New York Times, paid the English
Singers this tribute: "A concert by
the English Singers is for the listener
j a unique and unforgettable experi
ence, a contact with a beauty that is
| rare and haunting, and interpreta
! tions that in their particular kind are
! unparalleled 011 tlie American concert
| stage."
Tickets for the concert may be ob
; tained at the box office tonight from
?1 to $2.50. Holders of season passes
! may also obtain seats at a special
! booth at the Pavilion.
