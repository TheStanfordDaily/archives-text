# BARTON W. EVERMANN SPEAKS ON ABUNDANT WEALTH OF COUNTRY
## 
### 
| "The natural resources of the
I United States are the richest and
most abundant of any couutry in the
world, but this very richness has
; made this country the most extrava
gant and short-sighted of all nations,"
said Dr. Barton W. Evermann, direc
i tor of the California Academy of
j Sciences, San Francisco, and lecturer
'of Zoology at Stanford, in a lecture
iin the Little Theatre Tuesday night
! on "Conservation of Our Natural Re
sources."
Speaking chiefly of the land re
sources, Dr. Evermann declared that
three-fifths of the primeval forests in
i the United States are now gone and
| the existing lumber is being used
three or four times as fast as it is
j being replaced. "Of the 325,000,000
| acres of cut-over timber land in our
; country, there are 80,000,000 acres on
j which there is no growth at all,"
i said the speaker, "and in order to re
store all or part of this area to its
former condition, there must be con
certed efforts of the national govern
ment, the states, and the individuals
i
i to reforest it.
Loss Has Been Disastrous
"This cutting-off has been far-reach
ing in its disastrous results; animals
are disappearing, many species hav
ing become extinct because of the
loss of their cover. Moreover, it has
effected the run-off of water, espe
cially in the Mississippi Valley.
Streams which formerly had a rela
tively even flow throughout the year,
! are now violent torrents for a short
! part of the year and the rest of the
j time are dried up or merely groups
I of stagnant pools. It is still possible
i to restore those by replanting short
[strips of land among the edges of the
i streams. Another result has been the

extermination of many species of
flora —spice brush, orchids, wild cher
ries—and different kinds of fish life."
Dr. Evermann then told of the dis
j appearing animal and bird life on
this continent and of the efforts being
j made to protect certain species.
Allied lectures on "The Resources
of the Sea" will be given by Dr. Ever
mann this and tomorrow after
j noons at 4:15 o'clock in the Little
i Theatre.
