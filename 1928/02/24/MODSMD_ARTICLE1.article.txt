# VARSITY HAS EDGE TO WIN OVER BRONCS IN BASEBALL
## Doug Lewis May Be First Stanford Hurler to Enter Box REGULARS WILL START Cards' Chances Are Boosted By Exhibition Against St. Mary's Nine 
### 
By merit of that great eighth inning
rally against the Saints last Wednesday,
the Card varsity baseball team will enter
the game against Santa Clara at 2:30
o'clock tomorrow afternoon on the home
diamond, conceded an even chance to
avenge that 6-5 defeat at the hands of
the Broncs last Saturday.
Lewis May Start
Having used all but two of his seven
pitchers in an effort to stave off the
heavy batting attack of the St. Marys
hitters, Coach Harry Wolter is unde
cided as to what hurler will start to
morrow. He said yesterday that it is
possible that Doug Lewis, who tossed
the first five innings in Wednesday's
game, may lead off.
The remainder of the Card line-up will
be the same as that which played against
St. Mary'sâ€”Sypher, catcher; Maguire,
Ist base; Garibaldi, 2nd base; Laird, 3rd
base ; Busch, shortstop ; Levin, left field ;
Wilton, center field; and Sims, right
field. Their batting order will also be
unchanged, Wilton leading off, and fol
lowed in order by Busch, Sims, Maguire,
Garibaldi, Sypher, Levin, Laird, and the
pitcher.
