# Audience Pleased With Program Of Old English Madrigals, Folk-Songs
## Unaccompanied Songs of Tudor Times Delightful In A.S.S.U. Concert Motets, Polk-Songs, Wassails Reviewed by Group Of Six Artists 
### Herb Klein 
Something new —being three hun
dred years old —and something re
freshing, because sung by artists with
j intelligence and joy in their doing it,
i was heard in the Pavilion last night
| when the group known as the English
| Singers delighted and surprised the
audience. They sang motets, madri
gals, follt-sonks, ballets, and even
Italian "street cries" set to music.
They sang unaccompanied, with a
clear freshness of tone that made
choruses seem unwieldy, and Italian
ate operatic solos saccharine and
stuffy.
Cuthbert Kelly, the moving spirit
behind the enterprise, and the very
capable bass of the ensemble he has
organized, explained to the audience
some of the facts surrounding the
original composition and performance
|of these numbers back in the days
| of good Queen Bess, when England
I was merrie and its music was, too.
It. seems that the madrigals were in
j tended for home consumption, to be
j sung around the family board after
: the last round of nuts and raisins and
j ale. Then the good host would pass
; around the part books and all would
j join in heartily.
That is why, undoubtedly, there
was so much of good cheer and
! humor, and so little affectation and
striving after meretricious effect in
j this music, written for people who
knew how to take joy in living, by
composers who loved to fuse with the
words and sense of a charming lyric,
melodies and harmonies that would
re-enforce its distinctive qualities.
We hope that Misses Mann, Carson,
find Berger, and Messrs. Stone, Note
ly, and Kelley will blend their voices
i and smile at each other and the audi
ence soon again in these parts.
