# Varsity Net Men Will Clash With Occidental Team
## McElvenny, Herrington Will Play Against Visiting Doubles Pair Gorchakoff, Third Ranking College Star, Leads Southerners 
### 
California intercollegiate tennis honors
are likely to be decided tomorrow morn
ing when Stanford's varsity net team
meets Occidental College on the campus
courts at 9:30 o'clock.
Occidental relies mostly upon the skill
ful play of Benjamin S. Gorchakoff,
twice California intercollegiate champion,
and third national ranking collegiate star.
Gorchakoff is at his best upon hard
courts. He has a fine service, good
ground strokes, and a spectacular volley
ing game. That he is in good form is
shown by his match with "Big Bill" Til
den in the fall tournament of the Los An
geles Tennis Club, in which he won one
set and carried the two losing sets to
deuce games.
Gorchakoff is well supported in dou
bles by Art Kussman, second ranking
singles player. Kussman has been known
in the past as an erratic performer, but
extensive play in the last few months has
given him enough steadiness to make him
dangerous.
The exact positions of the rest of the
visiting team are not yet decided, but
third singles and second doubles will be
taken care of by Lee Osborne, Dale Rob
inson, and Yasu Maeno.
For Stanford, Alan Herrington will
play first singles, John Wlieatley second,
and either Ralph McElvenny or Lawrence
Hall third, depending upon their match
this afternoon. McElvenny and Herring
ton will play first doubles with Wheat-
Icy and Gomcr Thomas second.
