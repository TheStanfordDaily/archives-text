### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.—( U.P.) —
The Government had a successful
day in dealing with the various rami
fications of the Teapot Dome affair.
The Senate won its court fight over
its contempt action against Robert W.
Stewart, head of the Standard Oil of
Indiana. The Senate Teapot Dome in
vestigating committee obtained tes
timony revealing that Harry M.
Blackmer, one of the ringleaders in
the Continental Trading Company
deal, got $763,000 out of the profits
and fled the country because he
feared civil action by oil companies to
recover the money. The United States
District Attorney Gordon announced
he would proceed with contempt ac
tion against the Burns detectives who
shadowed the Fall-Sinclair Teapot
Dome jury and against Edward J.
Kidwell, the juror who was alleged to
have predicted he would get a car a
block long if Sinclair was acquitted.
The Stewart case was decided in
favor of the Government when Jus
tice Jennings Bailey of the District
of Columbia Supreme Court dismissed
Stewart's habeas corpus writ and de
clared he had no right to refuse the
Senate Teapot Dome committee's
question as to whether he knew any
body who got bonds out of the Con
tinental Trading Company deal. He
took an appeal and it may be- a year
before there is a final decision.
