# REDSHIRTS TO MEET TWO BEAR TEAMS IN WATER POLO GAMES
## Blue and Gold Men Strong, Compared With Great 1921 Squads 
### 
I Stanford's varsity and freshman
water polo teams will meet squads
from the University of California to
morrow afternoon in what are ex-
I pected to be two of the best exhibi
tions ever held in the Enema pool.
For years Stanford has beaten the
Bears. This year the Californians
have a sturdy hope of at least hold
ing the Cardinals to a close score.
The Blue and Gold varsity has
; beaten the strong Alliens Club team
in three out of five matches played
this year; it is said to be one of the
; best eßar water polo teams yet pro
duced by Coach Robertson, and has
; been compared with the great Cali
fornia team of 1921.
Stanford was conceded a distinct
edge in tomorrows meet until Cal
St'rong, captain, was forced out of
competition with sinus trouble.
; Strong is back again, however, and
awaits Ernst Brandsten's decision as
i to whether or not lie will be placed
in the lineup.
Brandsten's probable varsity lineup
j is: forwards —Vanden Akker, Harri
! son, Burnsj guards—Driggs, Strong,
iMaltby; goal-keper, Thornton; substi
j tutes —Parker, Ogg, Cole.
Vanden Akker, Harrison, and Driggs
are champion swimmers; Strong and
Harrison are water polo players of
i long experience and will probably
| have a good chance to go to Amster
dam next summer on the American
i Olympic team.
Hillman is the only experienced
1 player on the freshman squad, but in
i Milton Burns, Coach Brandsten has
] developed a player of varsity caliber
who is both quick and powerful.
The probable freshman lineup is:
; forwards —Hillman, Thomas, Hunt;
j guards—Burns, Smith, Scott; goal
j keeper—Marsh; substitute —Moffatt.
