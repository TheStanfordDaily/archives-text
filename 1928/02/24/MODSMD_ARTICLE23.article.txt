# REDSHIRTS TO MEET TWO BEAR TEAMS IN WATER POLO GAMES
## Blue and Gold Men Strong, Compared With Great 1921 Squads 
### 
Stanford's varsity and freshman
water polo teams will meet squads
from the University of California to
morrow afternoon in what are ex-
I pected to be two of the best exhibi
tions ever held in the Encina pool.
For years Stanford has beaten the
Bears. This year the Californians
have a sturdy hope of at least hold
ing the Cardinals to a close score.
The Blue and Gold varsity has
beaten the strong Athens Club team
in three out of five matches played
this year; it is said to be one of the
; best eßar water polo teams yet pro
duced by Coach Robertson, and has
; been compared with the great Cali
fornia team of 1921.
Stanford was conceded a distinct
edge in tomorrows meet until Cal
Strong, captain, was forced out of
competition with sinus trouble.
Strong is back again, however, and
awaits Ernst Brandsten's decision as
to whether or not he will be placed
in the lineup.
Brandsten's probable varsity lineup
j is: forwards —Vanden Akker, Harri
son, Burnsj guards—Driggs, Strong,
iMaltby; goal-keper, Thornton; substi
tutes —Parker, Ogg, Cole.
Vanden Akker, Harrison, and Driggs
are champion swimmers; Strong and
Harrison are water polo players of
long experience and will probably
| have a good chance to go to Amster
dam next summer on the American
Olympic team.
Hillman is the only experienced
player on the freshman squad, but in
Milton Burns, Coach Brandsten has
developed a player of varsity caliber
who is both quick and powerful.
The probable freshman lineup is:
forwards —Hillman, Thomas, Hunt;
j guards—Burns, Smith, Scott; goal
keeper—Marsh; substitute —Moffatt.
