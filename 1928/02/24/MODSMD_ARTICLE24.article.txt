"As resources of the land decrease,
we shall have to go to the sea for
resources," said Dr. Barton W. Ever
j mann, director of the California
I Academy of Sciences, in a lecture in
the Little Theatre yesterday. Dr. i
Everraann has compiled a list of j
marine mammals of (he Pacific ocean '
I numbering forty-five or fifty, every
j one of which has some commercial ;
value, either now or for the future.
On this list are seven varieties of
' l Avhales, species of seals, walrus, por
j poises, sea cows which are now prac
j tically extinct, and the sea otter, the
I fur of which lias in the past been
worth $3000 each, probably the most
valuable fur in the world.
Dr. Evermann has statistics con
cerning the whales taken in at Moss
Landing on Monterey bay, which has
been closed because of scarcity of
whales. When he has studied these,
he hopes to give some definite infor
mation about their life. "The whales
! are dried of their oil, then their
' ( bones, hide, and carcass are made
-! into fertilizer and sold to the Sperry
I I Flour Company, which mixes it with
i | vegetable matter, and in turn sells
• it in Petaluma," said Dr. Evermann.
i "Fur Seals of the Pacific" will be
• i the subject of a lecture by Dr. Ever
• mann at 4:15 o'clock this afternoon
- in the Little Theatre. This talk will
be accompanied by a moving picture
of the rookeries on the Pribilof Is
lands of Alaska.
