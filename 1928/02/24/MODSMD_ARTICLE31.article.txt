Just when spring is beautifully under way and everyone has settled
down peacefully to enjoy the fruits of a flunkout average, up jumps the
devil in the guise of Fashion Week. "Iron Kellies," tight shoes, white
shirts, pongee ties, artichoke greens, "boyish silhouette at the back," full
dress suits. And they call 'em spring fashions.
The derbies do seem to be coming more into prominence hereabouts
lately. Three years ago not one was to be seen 011 the Stanford Campus.
Now there is one. But as to the new, narrow shoes —well, it seems a
shame to throw away the old tan ones that have been nurtured through
foul weather and fair until they have at last come to a comfortable old
age.
Shirts, ties (wondrous blue, green, red, and purple stripes), sox in
heavenly hues, all must go. For now it's basket weaves, solid colors,
jaunty checks, and maybe even garters. Formality is the tone. No more
snap-brim hats, no more nonchalant-negligee spirit about crowns. And
what's more, if you have a sea-green Stetson, keep it in the closet with
the other skeletons; they're now Myrtle Green (whoever she is). We
walk into a hat store: "Please, Mr. Floorwalker, could you tell me which
salesperson can show me the latest in Myrtle Greens."
Comes a cry from a Y.W.C.A. secretary that, "It's not for men that
girls dress." Of course not. Ask any costumer or designer. And about
these boyish silhouettes "at the back," let the women remember that
Cleopatra was not that kind.
The clothing and ornament manufacturers are not satisfied with mere
printed advertising. A news item informs us that The Florida Peach and
Ty Cobb have both been offered large contracts to tour the country in
what the well-dressed woman and man will wear, in order that these
United States may enjoy a sartorial renaissance. Well, they've certainly
chosen the Cream of the country —but, can you tie it?
There is always one consoling thing about fashions: they run, like
dynamos, in cycles. So, if you've got any of the old English-cut shoes
that were worn back in '20 and '21, or the sober black tie that "Uncle
John and Aunt Phoebe" sent one Christmas, or the Full "D" the folks
made you bring to college, get them out. "It won't be wrong now!"
