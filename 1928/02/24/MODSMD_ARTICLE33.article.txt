BERKELEY, Feb. 23. — (P.1.P.) —
The University of California track
and field team may change the styles
in track arguments on the Pacific
Coast when they appear in their first
meet arrayed in a new type of uni
form selected for them by their vete
ran coach, Walter Christie.
The Bears have discarded the
"stripe" jersey and will wear mono
gramed jersies of blue Italian silk.
Trunks of sateen will be of a Golden
Poppy color. Christie Bays that the
new type of uniform is much lighter
than the old. The monogram was sub
stituted for the stripe because the
latter had a tendency to tighten over
the shoulder of the runner and make
him lose his stride.
