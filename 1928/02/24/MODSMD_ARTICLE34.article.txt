# FLUKE GIVES GAME TO ILLINOIS
## 
### 
MADISON, Wis., Feb. 23,â€”(P.1.P.)
Illinois recently won a basketball
game from the Wisconsin five by a
score of 34-33 when the timekeeper's
gun failed to work at the end of the
game thus allowing an Illinois player
to sink the winning basket from the
mirldle or the floor before a new cart
ridge could be substituted.
