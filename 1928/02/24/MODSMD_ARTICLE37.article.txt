"Yes, I can teach them HOW to sing,
but I cannot give them the heart's grief—
the UNDERSTANDING to sing; that
came to me when I lost my two sons in
the war. THAT they must learn in their
OWN sorrow."
The beloved Ernestine Schumann-
Heink was allowing her questioner be
hind the scenes of her life as she replied
to the report that she was going to de
vote the rest of her life to giving free
( vocal training to those who are worthy.
Here, quite unconsciously, she told the
secret of her own beauty of voice and
character.
It is doubtful if there lives another
woman who is as genuinely and deser
vedly loved and admired as Mme. Schu
mann-Heink. She is too fine, too bound
less, for us to claim her as ours. She
belongs to the ages, as Lincoln docs, for
each, in a separate way, is universal.
For over fifty years Schumann-Heink
has been publicly before us, and her voice
has brought joy and beauty to millions.
Her gift she has dedicated to bringing
happiness to others, and one who hears
her sing cannot but feel that there is
more than music in her voice; it is a
heart expressing itself.
We frequently think of life as being a
harsh, unjust taskmaster, and that sor
row is without compensation. Yet, who
will deny that suffering, which is synony
mous with living, brings to each of ys

something that is priceless. That some
thing is a deeper understanding of life,
and with that comes kindness and sym
pathy.
In the Great War two brothers fought
against one another. One was in the
Allied army, the other in the German.
These boys were the sons of Ernestine
Schumannn-Heink, and neither ever re
turned to her. They were the price she
paid for understanding, and yet, the
mother sang and "carried-on."
In such a life we find inspiration and
stimulus for our own lives. It is com
forting to learn from her that, phoenix
like, beauty rises from the ashes of sor
row and disappointment, and that we may
mean the most in life after we emerge
from its darkest hour. LIFE, in its full
est meaning, mellows us, and transforms
the days and drops of experience into
deep, quiet pools of understanding. Thus
we are better prepared to give ourselves
to others, and, paradoxical as it seems,
wc grow in direct proportion with that
giving.
Life lias repaid Schumann-Heink with
love and beauty, and because she has
given herself to the world, both she and
the world are richer, and finer. Those
who are fortunate enough to come under
her direct influence must inevitably re
flect some of her beauty—a beauty not
lifelong, but immortal.
Truly, when her Song shall be ended,
the Melody WILL linger 011.

voting wus not bothered with; im
portant decisions were made by the
chairman without consulting other
members; furthermore, there is a
Lower Divipjon student on the Coun
cil who had not completed the re
quired 120 units when he took office.
May we be enlightened?
Did Dr. Wilbur, in adding traffic
discipline to the Men's Council, have
the desire to deprive students of the
quorum right? There are important
matters in traffic cases which demand
a quorum, especially when all campus
intersections are not marked. The
rate of speed and the proper names
of streets speeded upon are matters
too important for the chairman alone
to decide.
Until we issue an extension to
Council authority, their proceedure is
limited by the Constitution.

The Editor, Sir:
Campus opinions are very good things
and are wonderful for relieving the
mind, but discretion is the better part of
valor, and courtesy is never out of place.
People like "Bud" should realize that
the quality of gentlemanliness is unre
strained and can perhaps win further
than a crude display of childishness and
bad manners. Personal remarks are un
called for, man to man, in a newspaper
of this sort, or of any sort for that
matter, but from a man to a lady they
are unforgiveable. Nothing that Sally
said was sufficient cause for such a let
ter. Even if she concocted an essay simi
lar to "Bud's" chef d'oeuvrc, it would
have reflected to his glory if he had had
the poise and self-sufficiency to keep si
lent.

As for the date that the writer of that
letter hinted at in his veiled way, I was
at a loss to account for it from what I
know of Sally. And then the solution
of the problem came to me. It must
have been a blind one.
