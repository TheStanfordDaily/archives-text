Editor, Sir: t
How about this sale of rooters' j
tickets for the coming Stanford-Cali
fornia basketball series? We are told
that there are no more tickets of any |
kind to be had on the campus or in
Palo Alto. It might have been all right'
to send the tickets for the Tuesday J
game up to the city, but it certainly |
is stretching a point when all the ;
tickets for the whole series are sent j
up to the city at this early date. Who '
is to blame is hard to say, but there i
certainly ought to be some change '
made in the system by which the '
tickets are sold.

In the first place the sale of tickets j
does not extend over a long enough ;
period. The tickets for the series were i
only put on sale on the Friday pre- |
ceding the first game. The sale then i
only lasted until Saturday noon, and
since Saturday is not a regular school 1
day, the sale really was only for half
a day. This did not give most of the
students a chance to buy their tickets

at all, and many of those who really
wanted to go and could not see their
way free until the day before the
game, also could not get tickets. If
tickets were sold at the gate at
rooters' rates students would be able
to get their tickets at the last minute. !
These seats would not all be in one
section but at least a student would j
not be denied the right to see the |
game at a student's price. After all,
these games are primarily for the in-1
terest of the students and it certain- |
ly is unfair to ask a student to pay
the same as the general public.

There does not seem to be anybody j
or any individual who has a genuine j
interest in getting the students to j
buy tickets. There is very little ad
vance publicity and very few people.!
ever know when the tickets are put
on sale. The only medium used by'
the Graduate Manager to get in touch !
with the students is the Stanford
Daily and few signs of any sort are
posted. The Rally Committee certain- i
ly ought to have some hand in the !
sale of these tickets. It is their duty ]

to work up enthusiasm for athletic
contests and it seems as if they are
woefully lacking in their efforts if
only 145 rooters' tickets can be sold
for a three-game series. It is the
Rally Committee that should have
advertised this basketball series and
if they cannot handle this work some
other group ought to be appointed
for this purpose. —A.E.

The Editor, Sir:
Read the A.S.S.U. Constitution and j
then let's talk. "The Councils for stu- |
dent control shall have such jurisdic
tion ... as is granted by the Presi
dent of the University." Then follow j
the rules which we, the students, i
have given to the Councils. Then we :
read "Constitutional interpretation i
. . . by the Dean of the Law School." j

the Men's Council. Their acts are un
constitutional. A regular meeting was

since Saturday is not a regular school 1

a day. This did not give most of the
students a chance to buy their tickets

at all, and many of those who really

only 145 rooters' tickets can be sold

other group ought to be appointed
