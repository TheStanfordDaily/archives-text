# SPORTS OF 1928
## How He Stops 'Em 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Too bad that I cannot say that
Lome Chabot, goalie of the New
York Rangers, is a direct descendant
of Horatius, or that he fought at Ver
dun under Marshal Petain. However,
being of French is quite
natural that Lorne would adopt that
famous Verdun battle-cry, "They
Shall Not Pass," as his own, at the
same time attempting to emulate the
deeds of Petain's brave warriors in
horizon blue who held back the
hordes of the Crown Prince on that |
famous battle-field.
But to get back to Horatius. Ac-1
cording to Macaulay's poem, Horatius
had one eye and two companions in
his bloody fight on the bridge over
the Tiber. Lorne Chabot has two
good eyes and also Ching Johnson
and Leo Bourgault up in front of him
to help stem the enemy attack, but

once his opponents get by the de
fense he is the sole guardian of the
gate, and many a remarkable save he
makes as the puck comes hurtling
through the air or along the ice at
him. Tonight the Pittsburgh Pirates
will play the part of the invading
Etruscans, and all those within a
radius of twenty-five miles of Madison
Square Garden are hereby advised to
go to see the Ranger Goalie do his
stuff against the fast skating Smoky
City crew.
Lome Chabot was born in Montreal
and broke into hockey with the St.
Anne's Athletic Club in 1919. He
played with the Port Arthur, Ont.,
team in the Allen Cup series in 1925
and '26, and joined the Rangers the
latter year. Since then he has been
turning in a series of wonderful goal
guarding performances for Col. Ham
mond's outfit.
