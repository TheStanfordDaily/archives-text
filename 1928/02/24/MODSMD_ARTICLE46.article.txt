# STANFORD MAN GETS ENGINEERING POSITION FROM EAST BAY CITY
## 
### 
John O. Miller, A.B. '12 in Civil
Engineering, who was in the City-
Engineer's office at Norfolk, Va., for
several years and more recently en
gineer for the New England District

of Eastern Products Association, has
returned to California. He has just
accepted the position of Sewer Engi
neer for the City of Richmond which
is undertaking an extensive sewer
rehabilitation program.

"John O." is remembered by the
old-timers as a great runner, having
held the intercollegiate record in the
half-mile for several years. In the
days of the five-man relay he was
unofficially timed by Walt Christie in
35 seconds flat, which would have

been a world record. His specialty
was the half-mile, but he was accus
tomed to capture victories in several
distances in each track meet.
