# SHEEP, CATTLE ENDANGERING CALIFORNIA FORESTS-VESTAL
## 
### William H. Grace 
"California's forests are threatened as
much liy sheep and cattle as by fire," said
Dr. A. G. Vestal of the School of Biology
when interviewed about tree conservation
in this state.
"Most Californians are by this time
alive to the need of preventing fires.
There is now the opportunity of educat
ing the public to the value of research on
the native vegetation. We must know
more about forests, and about the rela
tion of other vegetation—chaparral and
grassland—to forest. We must find out
more about the effect of forest in modify
ing the local climate, of the effect of
grazing animals upon forest and its un
dergrowth, and how to control grazing
with least harm to vegetation. We need
to learn more about the original pasture
grasses native to California and the beau
tiful wild flowers that grew with them in
the open fields.
Investigating Situation
The Forest Service and the Bureau of
Biological Survey, the California Forest
Experiment Station and the Division of
Forestry at Berkeley, and the Division
of Ecological Research of the Carnegie
Institution, are the chief agencies mak
ing these investigations. Similar work is
being carried on here at Stanford. Three
instrument stations for measurement of
local climatic and soil conditions are in
operation on University property above
Searsville Lake, and several preserved
areas, fenced to exclude grazing animals
and thus to make apparent the effects
which they produce, are established on
the same property."
"I am informed by Dr. Herman Knochc
of San Jose, who has studied in the
Mediterranean region for many years,
that he regards that territory as the wreck
of a once well-forested country, similar
to California in soil and climate.
Weeds Ruinous
"Extensive forests of valuable timber
once covered the land bordering the
Midetcrranean Sea. It was turned into
barren expanses of treeless hills by cat
tle, sheep, and goats. The animals killed
the young trees, trampled the soil, and
carried in seeds of harmful weeds. Low
shrubs with thorns or strong-smelling

leaves that no animal will cat are almost
the only extensive vegetation in these
places today; the rainfall is less than it
was formerly; the soil over large areas
has been washed from the hill slopes,
and floods are now more frequent.
"In California, beginning with the days
of the Spanish padres, large numbers of
undesirable weeds were introduced, whose
extent and troublesomeness have stead
ily increased. The seeds of some were
brought with Spanish seed grain; others
were carried in the coats of animals.
They are a selection of the most aggres
sive weeds, in most cases the last plants
that domestic animals will eat. Many
of them have spiny seeds, which attach
themselves to animals, as burrs. These
weeds include the star thistles, fdaree,
wild oats, wild barleys, and many weedy
grasses. Several are injurious to ani
mals, their spiny seeds penetrating eyes,
nose, and mouth. Heavy overgrazing has
made these the most common plants of
the west side of the Great Valley.
California Threatened
"Anyone who doubts that California is
retrograding to a situation similar to
that of the Mediterranean region need
only look back at past conditions to dis
cover what civilization has already done.
Old timers described the Santa Clara
valley as having open forests of oak
over much of its area. Fire and indis
criminate grazing have destroyed the na
tive pastures; man himself has detroyed
much of the timber. Mercury mines
south of San Jose were intensively work
ed from 1850 until rather recently. Many
thousands of redwood and Douglas fir
t:ees were cut to supply mine timbers,
and oak was used for fuel to roast the
mercury ore. Much charcoal was for
merly used in San Francisco; more oaks
were cut down to make it.

"Such depletions in California are a
repetition of the history of the Mediter
ranean. From earliest times trees have
been cut down there in numbers, incident
to military campaigns. A forest of oak
was cut down to make the Spanish Ar
mada. Near Burgos, in northern Spain,
an extensive forest was felled because it
furnished cover for bandits on a main
highway of travel.
"Many forests arc far more valuable
growing than cut, particularly where the
precipitation is limited. In times of heavy
rainfall they serve as a sponge to re
ger of flood. In places it is likely that
gcr of floflod. In places it is likely that
forests actually cause a local increase of
precipitation. Near the coast it is easy
to observe how trees remove moisture
from the air during a fog. Some red
wood trees growing beside a road in
Mendocino county had to be cut down
Decause the water which dripped from
their branches kept the road muddy in
midsummer."

much of the timber. Mercury mines
south of San Jose were intensively work
ed from 1850 until rather recently. Many
thousands of redwood and Douglas fir
t:ees were cut to supply mine timbers,
and oak was used for fuel to roast the
mercury ore. Much charcoal was for
merly used in San Francisco; more oaks
were cut down to make it.

"Such depletions in California are a
repetition of the history of the Mediter
ranean. From earliest times trees have
been cut down there in numbers, incident
to military campaigns. A forest of oak
was cut down to make the Spanish Ar
mada. Near Burgos, in northern Spain,
an extensive forest was felled because it
furnished cover for bandits on a main
highway of travel.
"Many forests arc far more valuable
growing than cut, particularly where the
precipitation is limited. In times of heavy
rainfall they serve as a sponge to re

forests actually cause a local increase of

to observe how trees remove moisture
from the air during a fog. Some red
wood trees growing beside a road in
Mendocino county had to be cut down

"California's forests are threatened as
much liy sheep and cattle as by fire," said
Dr. A. G. Vestal of the School of Biology
when interviewed about tree conservation
in this state.
"Most Californians are by this time
alive to the need of preventing fires.
There is now the opportunity of educat
ing the public to the value of research on
the native vegetation. We must know
more about forests, and about the rela
tion of other vegetation—chaparral and
grassland—to forest. We must find out
more about the effect of forest in modify
ing the local climate, of the effect of
grazing animals upon forest and its un
dergrowth, and how to control grazing
with least harm to vegetation. We need
to learn more about the original pasture
grasses native to California and the beau
tiful wild flowers that grew with them in
the open fields.
Investigating Situation
The Forest Service and the Bureau of
Biological Survey, the California Forest
Experiment Station and the Division of
Forestry at Berkeley, and the Division
of Ecological Research of the Carnegie
Institution, are the chief agencies mak
ing these investigations. Similar work is
being carried on here at Stanford. Three
instrument stations for measurement of
local climatic and soil conditions are in
operation on University property above
Searsville Lake, and several preserved
areas, fenced to exclude grazing animals
and thus to make apparent the effects
which they produce, are established on
the same property."
"I am informed by Dr. Herman Knochc
of San Jose, who has studied in the

Weeds Ruinous
"Extensive forests of valuable timber
once covered the land bordering the
Midetcrranean Sea. It was turned into
barren expanses of treeless hills by cat
tle, sheep, and goats. The animals killed
the young trees, trampled the soil, and
carried in seeds of harmful weeds. Low
shrubs with thorns or strong-smelling

leaves that no animal will cat are almost
the only extensive vegetation in these
places today; the rainfall is less than it
was formerly; the soil over large areas
has been washed from the hill slopes,
and floods are now more frequent.
"In California, beginning with the days
of the Spanish padres, large numbers of
undesirable weeds were introduced, whose
extent and troublesomeness have stead

were carried in the coats of animals.
They are a selection of the most aggres
sive weeds, in most cases the last plants
that domestic animals will eat. Many
of them have spiny seeds, which attach
themselves to animals, as burrs. These
weeds include the star thistles, fdaree,
wild oats, wild barleys, and many weedy
grasses. Several are injurious to ani
mals, their spiny seeds penetrating eyes,
nose, and mouth. Heavy overgrazing has
made these the most common plants of
the west side of the Great Valley.
California Threatened

retrograding to a situation similar to
that of the Mediterranean region need
only look back at past conditions to dis
cover what civilization has already done.
