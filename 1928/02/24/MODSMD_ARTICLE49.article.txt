We saw what we saw Wednesday
night in the Pavilion. The freshmen,
who started the season by giving
promise of being the best freshman
basketball team Stanford ever saw,
allowed their extreme self-satisfac
tion to run away with them, and as a
result, they were most unceremoni
ously upset by California.
Now the babes are about to enter
(lie third game of the series with the
Berkeley pea-greeners in a helpless
frame of mind. They showed by their
play Wednesday that they were im
potent when behind and fighting for
the lead. California, on the other
hand, played with determination, and,
with "Swede" Granger doing the
honors, iTiit themselves in a different
class from that of the Stanford fresh
men.
What can be done t.o counteract
such cockiness as has arisen in
the attitude of the freshmen?
Muggs Mitchell and Husky Hunt,
sarcastic as they may be, can't
take their proteges off their
porch. Certain of the players con
tinue to violate training rules up
until the day of the game. That
are-we-good obsession is the hard
est thing a coach has to fight.
We are as hopeful as the next man
that the freshmen win Saturday
night. Rut we wish they would learn
what Stanford teams usually under
stand pretty well and what California
teams have learned at the expense
of bitter experience: viz., you must
enter a big game or a big series or a
big meet humbly prepared to fight
for what you expect to get.
