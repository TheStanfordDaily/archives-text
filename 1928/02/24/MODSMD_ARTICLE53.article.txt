# ANNUAL INTERCLASS TRACK, FIELD MEET IS SCHEDULED WITH MARATHON CONTEST
## 
### 
Spectators should find unusual interest
in the interclass track and field meet this
afternoon at 3 :30 o'clock, for in addition
to the regular athletic events the Quad
rangle Club has planned its annual Irish
Marathon race and several novelty fea
tures.
In the Marathon, four teams of twenty
four men each run a quarter-mile. For
the best varsity and non-varsity time
made in this race, Quadrangle Club will
donate gold medals.
Sandwiched in between the regular
track events will be the novelty races.
Planned are a backward race, a quarter
mile walk, and a one-mile bicycle race.
In this latter event women are especially
welcome to compete. Merchandise orders
will be given as prizes.
A special attraction is scheduled in a
greased-pig and fowl catching contest.
In the last two years the slippery porker
number has been short lived. Ted Ship
key, varsity football end, found pig
catching easy after tackling shifty half
backs, and on each occasion snared the
pork without difficulty.
For the present race a very wily, saga
cious, and lightning-fast pig has been
captured, and when carefully smothered

with 600YV, should be sporting game for
anyone. Several tasty live chickens also
will be loosed on the field, catchers to be
keepers.
An admission of twenty-five cents will
be charged.
