# BABE BASEBALL MEN RESTING FOR LOWELL CONTEST TOMORROW
## 
### 
A rest cure is the formula that
: Coach Harry Wolter has prescribed
: for his yearling baseball charges in
! preparation for their game with
i Lowell High School tomorrow morn
-1 ing. Last night's practice was the first
1 one since a light session Monday. The
freshmen have been working steadily
! for over a month, and to prevent a
1 possible staleness, Wolter ordered
this temporary let-up.
Don Story, star freshman pitcher,
! will not start in tomorrow's tilt.
I Coach Wolter feels that he has
! earned a rest, and also wishes to try
J the merits of the other three babe
j hurlers, Ricklefs, Gillette, and Tick
ner will probably begin the game.
Lowell lias a veteran team and will
bid strongly for San Francisco prep
i school honors. Morgenstein, short
stop, is the individual star of the
team. He is an accurate fielder and a
| heavy hitter.
The game will be played on the
â–  varsity diamond at 10:30 o'clock.
