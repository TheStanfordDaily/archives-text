### 
| The third and deciding game of the
Stanford-California freshman basketball
series will be played in Kezar Pavilion
at 6:30 o'clock Saturday night as a pre
liminary to the varsity contest.
In the belief of "Husky" Hunt, Stan
| ford cage mentor, the Cardinal babes'
chances for a win are exceedingly slim.
"If the freshmen can't beat California on
their own court and with the crowd root
ing their way," declared Hunt, "they
will have to do a considerable amount of
improving before they can come out on
the long end of the score against the
j same team on a neutral court."
What the Stanford starting line-up will
j be remains a matter of doubt because of
the poor showing of many of the first
string regulars in Wednesday night's
game. The California starting line-up
will be Watkins, center; Coflicld and
Granger, forwards; McCoy and Frede
righi, guards.
The only Cardinal player who is ccr
i tain of beginning the game is Captain
I Mike Reynolds, whose steady and accu
| rate playing was the only good feature of

j as Stanford was concerned.
