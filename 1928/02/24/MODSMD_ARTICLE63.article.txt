### 
MADISON, Wis., Feb. 23.—(1.P.)—
Four months after the opening of the
Experimental College at the University
of Wisconsin some few tentative conclu
sions about the course of study and meth
ods of teaching a "liberal education" are
beginning to emerge. But the college is
still exactly what its name implies—ex
perimental—Dr. Alexander Meiklejolm,
its chairman, told the faculty of the Col
lege of Letters and Science.
Sume of the tentative conclusions which
Dr. Meiklejolm and his staff have
reached are:
The course of study and methods of
teaching now employed are best adapted
to the average student, but not to the
superior student or to the highly special
ized student.
Although no regulations governing the
daily regime of the students—attendance
at meetings, etc.—have so far been adopt
ed, it is clear that some few must be.
The faculty generally agrees, however,
that the regulations be as few as possible;
that each student should be given a
chance to learn for himself how to ar
range his work most effectively.
