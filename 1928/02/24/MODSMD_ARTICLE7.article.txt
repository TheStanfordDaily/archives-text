Last night marked the close of j
Intramural basketball games for both
League VI and League VIII. El Toro
Club, by winning from Alpha Tau
Omega, cinched the championship of :
League VI, while Encina IW, because
of the victory Plii Sigma Kappa
banded them by virtue of a default, j
kept their slate clean to win in
League VIII. Both these teams have
home through with one thousand per
cent in their respective leagues and
will enter the race for the Intramural
Championship which begins the latter
part of next week.
In a hard-fought, closely-contested
game the El Toro Club quintet drib
bled and disputed its way to a win
over the scrappy Alpha Tau Omega
team 15 to 11. The battle was for a
league championship and it was
deemed so important to the players
of each team that on several occa
sions the referee's decisions were the
basis of heated arguments. On one
point the rule book had to be resorted !
to to satisfy both sides. Garner, with ;
7 points for El Toro, was the high-!
point man of the game.
Rawlins of Alpha Kappa Lambda |
gave his team a 6-point lead in the j
early minutes of the game with Phi
Kappa Sigma by sinking 3 buckets
in rapid-fire succession. This substan
tial lead was held throughout the
first three quarters and, despite a
final quarter rally lead by Saunders
of Phi Kappa Sigma, it proved to be
enough to win by the closest of mar
gins 12 to 10. In the closing moments
Saunders was the nucleus of a brief
but superb passing attack which net
ted Phi Kappa Sigma 6 points, bring- :
ing the score first to 12 to 8 and then
to 12 to 10
j Sequoia II won over the Chinese
Club by default while Phi Sigma
Kappa forfeited its game to En
cina IW.
