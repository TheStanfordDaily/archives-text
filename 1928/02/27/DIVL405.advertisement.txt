THE WHITE HOUSE
SAN FRANCISCO
There is a certain sympathetic accord between
early Spring days and a college campus . . .
especially ours .. . have you noticed! Per
haps it is a feeling of spontaniety in the air
... a naturalness that goes well with shaggy
oaks and scuffed lawns. Perhaps, too, certain
refreshingly new costumes recently noticed
about the campus may have something to do
with it. The White House Fashion Shops
suggest:

by the knowing co-ed . . . th Spring blouse
