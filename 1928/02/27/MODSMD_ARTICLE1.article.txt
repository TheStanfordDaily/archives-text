By virtue of its decisive victories
over Stanford Friday and Saturday
nights, California annexed its seventh
-consecutive Big Series basketball
pennant and improved its conference
standing by handing the Cardinals
three straight defeats. The scores
were 29 to 12 and 28 to 17 in favor

U.S.C. victory, that team and the
Bears would be tied for southern divi
sion honors, with a percentage of
.6G6 each.

as if the Cards were going to set as

Dougery brothers piled up a lead for
California which the Bears kept until
the end of the half, which stood 11
to 8 in their favor. All of Stanford's
