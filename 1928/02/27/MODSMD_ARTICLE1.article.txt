# CARDINAL FIVE LOSES SERIES TO CALIFORNIA
## U.C.L.A. Trounces Trojans; Bears in First Flace Of Southern P.C.C. LAST TWO GAMES DULL Conference Title Depends On U.S.C.-Card Contest Here Wednesday 
### Merle Emry 
By virtue of its decisive victories
over Stanford Friday and Saturday
nights, California annexed its seventh
-consecutive Big Series basketball
pennant and improved its conference
standing by handing the Cardinals
three straight defeats. The scores
were 29 to 12 and 28 to 17 in favor
of the Bears, Friday and Saturday
nights respectively.
California's victory against Stan
ford and U.S.C.'s defeat in two out
of three games by the U.C.L.A. Bruins
puts California in first place of the
southern division of the P.C.C. and
only a win by the Trojans bver Stan
ford here Wednesday night will
again put U.S.C. in the running for
the honors which they have so long
sought. In the event of the expected
U.S.C. victory, that team and the
Bears would be tied for southern divi
sion honors, with a percentage of
.6G6 each.
Bears Superior
After the slump shown by Stanford
in Friday night's game, the Cardinal
fans were looking for their team to
come back and take the third contest
from the Bears, but again Nibs
Price's men proved superior and the
tilt Saturday was just as rough and
â– dull as was the one that preceded it.
In the final game Saturday night,
Dobson started at center for Smalling
and for the first few minutes it looked
as if the Cards were going to set as
fast a pace as they maintained in the
first series battle. Corbin and the
Dougery brothers piled up a lead for
California which the Bears kept until
the end of the half, which stood 11
to 8 in their favor. All of Stanford's
eight points were made by free'
throws, out of the ten chances.
Stevens Stars
At the beginning of the second j
half, Richards dropped in Stanford's j
first basket of the evening and again j
it appeared as if the Cardinals had
got under way. The Bear defense I
tightened up and its offense, with J
Stevens and Tripp starring, added i
three baskets which put the game on
ice for California.
Rothert and Thompson, CardinaJ
guards, played the game of their j
lives and were the responsible parties !
j for keeping the California score!
| down to the minimum. Thompson was 1
j taken out on four personal fouls, as [
I were Corbin and J. Dougery of Cali
! fornia.
Cardinals Weak
I A complete reversal of form from ;
| that shown in the opening game of
j the series Tuesday night was suffered
J by Stanford in the second contest.
; The Bears, fighting to take the Big
Series title in two games, were an
improved aggregation that passed
faultlessly and scored at ease.
