# VARSITY, FRESHMEN WIN OVER BEARS IN WATER POLO MEET
## Cards Score on Safe Plays; Harrison, Strong Star For Cardinals 
### 
i Stanford's varsity water polo team
upheld an old tradition Saturday af
ternoon by literally swamping the
California squad, 10-0, in a game full
of thrills for the spectators. The
freshmen also beat the Blue and
Gold, handing their yearling team a
12-0 beating.
Captain Cal Strong appropriately
started things off by scoring the first
j goal. From then on, the Card mermen
scored on perfectly safe plays, by
dribbling up to the net and firing the
ball in without opposition.
Reggie Harrison was high-point
man for the varsity with four count
ers to his credit. This contest showed
him up as a player of the best inter
collegiate calibre and likely material
for the American Olympic team which
will go to Amsterdam next July,
i Vanden Akker, Burns, and Harri
son "formed a scoring combination
which the Blue and Gold guards could
not touch. Their swimming, shooting,
and strategy was the only thing which
made a very one-sided game interest
ing. Driggs, Maltby, and Strong, the
guards, and Thornton at goal, had
little chance to prove their ability, as
the ball seldom got near the Stanford
| goal.
On the freshman team, Coach Ernst
Brandsten found two hitherto un
| proven players showing up with sur
j prising skill. They were Captain
1 "Whitey" Burns, guard, and Herb
j Marsh, goalkeep. Ilillman. high-point
i man with eight goals, and Moffatt are
I experienced players who showed their
previous training and did the scoring.
; But Burns played the key position
i and made such fast breaks in turning
J that he was covering two men most
of the time.
Marsh, a diver, was recruited at the
last minute to guard the Cardinal
goal. After only a week's practice he
played a game which would have
! boosted the stock of a player of long
: standing. Thomas also proved himself
a valuable player by getting the
"kick-off" with his fast sprinting
! nearly every time.
