Human eyesight will he compared with
that of a bird by Dr. Casey Wood, Stan
ford lecturer in ornithology, when he
speaks on "Some Tropical Birds 1 Have
Known" at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow eve
ning in the Little Theatre.
"Birds exhibit practically every form
of eyesight, and not only have vision
which is quite equal to human eyesight,
but many forms that surpass our particu
lar kind of sight," Wood declares.
"One should know something about
the organization of the bird as well as
the kind of eyes he possesses," says this
specialist. This fact led Dr. Wood to
make a study of birds in their native,
normal surroundings.
During tbe past five years, Dr. Wood
has made many prolonged expeditions to
the West Indies, South America, the
South Seas, New Zealand, Australia,
the Philippine Islands, Ceylon, Kashmir,
and India, where he has been able to
study many of the native birds.
