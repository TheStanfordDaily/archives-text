### 
Despite a chilly wind and an overcast
sky, which go with unfavorable track
weather, Stanford's oval and field men
turned in some encouraging records Fri
day as the juniors decisively won the
annual interclass meet. The victors
scored 69 points against 37 by the fresh
men, 36 by the seniors, and 23 by the

Hanging an additional laurel on their
brows, the juniors also annexed the 24-
lap Irish Marathon event with Fred Zom
bro and Johnny Lauritzen saving the day
by pulling them from second to first
place. The freshman, sophomore, and
senior teams followed in order.

as far as the hurdles were concerned.

time of 24 4-5 seconds.

the bar at 6 feet 5 inches in the high

inches. Dowel 1 and Anderson both
