# JUNIORS score WIN IN ANNUAL TRACK CONTEST
## Third-Year Team Noses Out Freshmen in Annual Irish Marathon RECORDS ENCOURAGING Coe Shows Unexpected Speed In Two-Mile; King Hits 6 Feet Five Inches 
### 
Despite a chilly wind and an overcast
sky, which go with unfavorable track
weather, Stanford's oval and field men
turned in some encouraging records Fri
day as the juniors decisively won the
annual interclass meet. The victors
scored 69 points against 37 by the fresh
men, 36 by the seniors, and 23 by the
sophomores.
Hanging an additional laurel on their
brows, the juniors also annexed the 24-

bro and Johnny Lauritzen saving the day
by pulling them from second to first
place. The freshman, sophomore, and
senior teams followed in order.

contingent, surprised fans by exhibiting
an unexpected amount of power and
speed in the two-mile. Bob King cleared
the bar at 6 feet 5 inches in the high
jump for another encouraging mark, and
Maynor Shove, a freshman, clipped off
the 440 in 51 seconds flat.
Card broadjumpers easily equaled the
boast of U.S.C. coaches—that there are
four Trojans capable of making over
22 feet—when Kim Dyer, of the seniors,
going just a half inch better than Zom
bro, junior contender, hit 23 feet
inches. Dowel 1 and Anderson both
cleared 22 feet comfortably.
Weight Men Strong
Four shot-putters, Krenz, Forster,
Way, and Fleishhacker, heaved better
than 45 feet, with Krenz cinching first
by tossing 48 feet 5 inches. Krenz won
the discus at 147 feet 2 inches.
