"A student" writes to the Daily, asking that the Dean of the
Law School be asked to give a decision to the Student Body on the
question of whether or not the Men's Council can act legally
without a quorum. He also says "It certainly looks as if the
Council is trying to put something over on us."
It is very unlikely that the Council has any thought of putting
anything "over." It is, undoubtedly, doing its duties as it sees
them. However, if the charges made by C. Fred. Menke, in a
Campus Opinion last Friday, are true, the Council is in error, and
should make some affirmative move to straighten things out. The
charges were that the Council had acted unconstitutionally by not
having a quorum present, and that one of the members did not
have the units required to act officially.
The practical outcome probably would be the same whether
there were two members present, or the whole Council. But one
who is before disciplinary board likes to feel that he is having full
legal protection. If four members constitute a quorum, four mem
bers MUST be present to take legal action. If 120 units are re
quired before a student can belong to the Council, he should have
those units. It might be stated here that the man in question did
not have the necessary units when he was elected, but he did have
them when he took office.
All this is closely allied to the recent request of the Daily, that
reasons and punishments be published by the Councils, both Mens
and Women's.
These bodies are only doing themselves harm by holding up
such information, and by being lax in their procedure. They should
have a great deal of prestige and respect, and they can if their
work is clearly understood. But when doubts are raised in the
minds of the students about the legality of actions and the fairness
with which penalties are handed out, they cannot respect the
Councils.
It is up to the Men's Council to give the students a reply to
Mr. Menke's accusation, rather than have the Dean of the Law
School interpret the Constitution, the contents of which are per
fectly obvious in this particular case. It is also the duty of both
Councils to furnish information on their actions.

legal protection. If four members constitute a quorum, four mem
bers MUST be present to take legal action. If 120 units are re
quired before a student can belong to the Council, he should have
those units. It might be stated here that the man in question did
not have the necessary units when he was elected, but he did have
them when he took office.
All this is closely allied to the recent request of the Daily, that
reasons and punishments be published by the Councils, both Mens
and Women's.
These bodies are only doing themselves harm by holding up
such information, and by being lax in their procedure. They should
have a great deal of prestige and respect, and they can if their
work is clearly understood. But when doubts are raised in the
minds of the students about the legality of actions and the fairness
with which penalties are handed out, they cannot respect the
Councils.
It is up to the Men's Council to give the students a reply to
Mr. Menke's accusation, rather than have the Dean of the Law
School interpret the Constitution, the contents of which are per
fectly obvious in this particular case. It is also the duty of both
Councils to furnish information on their actions.
