# PALACE HOTEL BEGINS AUTO SHOW TOMORROW
## 
### 
San Francisco's first automobile
salon opened in the Palace Hotel
Saturday afternoon. Many novelties in
automobile accessories, bodies, uphol
stery, and the like will be introduced.
Snake-skin upholstery, an imported
innovation, is one of the things
to be featured. New methods to fold
away tops, to convert closed bodies
into open ones, adjustable seats, irri
descent colors copied from butter
flies for body finish, and new types
of windshields are other features of
the salon.
