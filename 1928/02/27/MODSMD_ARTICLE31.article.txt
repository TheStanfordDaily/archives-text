Croakless Frogs?
Whoever added a horned frog to the
contents of a Texas county courthouse
cornerstone certainly played a dirty trick
on the frog. Think of being shut up in
a whole courthouse for thirty-one years,
let alone in a courthouse cornerstone!
This veritable Rip Van Winkle among
frogs arouses our profound admiration,
living away all of those thirty-one years
sans wine, sans song, sans singer, as the
now squelched Omar would murmur.
The press reports him as being in a quite
normal condition, a few minor weak
nesses excepted. No less than 10,001) peo
ple were said to have viewed the frog in
a single day's exhibition in a drug store
window. Quite a Prince of Wales or a
Lindbergh of his kind.
We wonder if the frog is still in a
mood to croak. Perhaps he got tired
some twenty-five years ago, or mayhap

his croaks made his cars ring—providing,
of course, a frog has ears. Should this
frog croak no longer, we claim a scien
tific inspiration. Let is be the father of
a new kind of croakless frog. Then,
who knows, someday we might have a
peaceful night in the vicinity of Roble.
Somehow, somwhere we believe there
must be a joker. While not an authority
on frogs in spite of Biology lab., it all,
nevertheless, sounds fishy. More than
likely it is a classical example of broad
Texan humor belonging most properly to
legend along with horses which can be
ridden at a gallop for days at a time and
rattlesnakes which never cross horsehair
ropes
The story would sound better if some
body bad tossed in a plug of tobacco for
the frog to chew while thinking things
over lo! those many thirty-one years. —
