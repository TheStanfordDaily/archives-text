# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
It does not seem too much to add a
word to A.E.'s communication of Fri
day in regard to the recent California-
Stanford basketball series ticket
sales. Obviously, Stanford's Board of
Athletic Control was hit by the in
fantile paralysis; "we were robbed of
plenty," is the cry, consequently it is
easy to understand why Stanford ac
cepted San Francisco as the place
where the games were played. (That
was the place where the most money
could be made.) That is plain to see:
less students went to the games than
if they had played one game here, and
one in Cal. territory; consequently
the boards of California and Stanford
reaped a dollar for every 50 cent stu
dent ticket that is sold to the dear
S.F. public. Not content with that,
the Board limited the sale of tickets
here on the campus to make sure,
we presume, that too many 50 cent
tickets would not be sold. The reason
for the limited campus sale is given
that "the public is clamoring and we
know how many students are going."
(Applesauce.) One thousand seats
were empty Tuesday night; two thou
sand seats were for sale Friday; and
Saturday saw no approach to a full
house; and even then we couldn't buy
seats last week of any kind in Palo
Alto, Campus, or environs. What if
the rooters' tickets sold after the
regular sale are the best ever, we, as
students, appreciate that, but we
can't quite swallow this business of
one dollar a night, for three nights
that week, plus gas and oil or train
fare.
The B.A.C.'s side of the question
should certainly be taken into con
sideration, and we are doing that, but
in spite of even that, we fail to jus
tify this latest outrage, ragged deal,
or what have you, handed to us this
month.
We'd like know how the Board
of Athletic Control justifies this won
derful approach it has made to com
mercializing our varsity basketball
squad. Yours, "Louie, '28."

The Editor, Sir:
Arc not our traffic regulations most
inconsistent? Why "15 miles at inter
section," when at this same intersection
there is a stop sign at every side street ?
Do not these signs say "arterial"? Why,
then, do we not make it an arterial ?
Why waste perfectly good stop signs at

every small intersection when there are
none at any of the points where they are
needed most? Take, for instance, the
principal outlets from our campus, Palm
Drive and Embarcadero Street. They
cross the main highway between San
Francisco and Los Angeles, and yet we
lordly Stanford students are allowed to
speed past these intersections and proudly
say, "Stanford is a private institution.
We don't have to stop. No, we can't help
it if we delay traffic on California's
busiest highway." Have not these inter
sections caused more accidents than all ;
the other ones ever will? Are we so,
pressd for money that we (or we should
say, the Men's Council) must fine stu
dents one dollar per mile that they travel
beyond the average speed of a fast truck I
horse? If so, why fine a violator who
works, and works hard for every cent lie I
I gets, when hundreds violate our regula- j
tions daily? â€”"PLUTO."
