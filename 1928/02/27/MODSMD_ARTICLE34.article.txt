# BARTON W. EVERMANN TALKS ON FUR SEALS OF PRIBILOF ISLANDS
## 
### 
"In 1870 there were three or four mil
lion fur-bearing seals on the Pribilof
Islands of the Bering Sea, but so many
of them were killed that in 1911 there
were only 127,000," declared Dr. Barton
W. Evermann, director of the California
Academy of Science, in a lecture in the
Little Theatre Friday.
Russia, Japan, Great Britain, and the
United States agreed to prevent the kill
ing of the seals on their way southward
after the breeding period, and the number
of seals on the Pribilof Islands has in
creased to 900,000. Each country may
kill the surplus of males, which amounts
now to about 25,000 every year.
"The black hair is plucked from the
skin of the seal after it has been cured,
and a tannish brown fur is left, which is
combed, machined, and died black," said
Dr. Evermann. "Each fur must be
stamped with a government mark."
David Starr Jordan was chairman of
the International Fur Seal Commission
which gathered data valuable in the
agreement between the Pacific countries.
All fur-bearing seals were thought to be
of the same kind until Dr. Jordan dis
covered that there are three species, one
on the Pribilof Islands belonging to the
United States, the second on the Com
mander Islands, the property of Russia,
and the third on one of th Jaepanse is
lands.
