### 
What chance lias a poor, unsophisti
cated pig against 200 pounds of beef
from "Pop" Warner's Stanford varsity?
Very little, judging from the results
of the greased pig race at the Irish Mara
thon Friday when Chris Freeman, erst
while Card tackle, used his very best
form in stopping a surprised and dis
gruntled porker.
It was a scared and squealing pig
which furnished the entertainment for
the seething mob and which will provide
meat for the El Toro club larder fur
some time to come.
Three other enterprising El Toro lads
further insured good nourishment for
the clubmen by scaring three fowls in
the chicken catching contest.
Bob Eraser completely outclassed the
field in copping first in the 880-yard bi
cycle race. Paul Harlow won from Joe
Carroll by a scant margin in the 440-yard
walk and Bob Swain was victorious in
the 100-yard backward race.
Winners were rewarded by merchan
dise orders on Palo Alto stores.
