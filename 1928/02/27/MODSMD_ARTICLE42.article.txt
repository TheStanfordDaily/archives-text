Football, which, acording to many of
its critics, has developed into nothing but
a sort of Glorified Basketball of late
years, furnishes many a star to the in
door game, which follows it closely both
011 the calendar and in popularity. In
fact, the two sports often overlap to such
an extent that one or the other suffers
because the athletes cannot play both
games at once.
Take the case of the University of
California, for instance. Since January 30,
1925', the California basketball quintet
played and won thirty-eight straight bas
ketball games. Last fall came the post
season football game with the University
of Pennsylvania on December 31. Ralph
and Jim Doughery, mainstays of the cage
quintet (Jim is Captain), were thus lost
to the team because they were both mem
bers of the football leven. Nibs Price,
coaching both sports, was as busy as the
w.k. one-armed paper-hanger, and the
Bears lost two court gjtmes in succession,
to St. Ignatius and Southern California.
Other coaches double in brass as far
as the two sports go, too. Andy Kerr at
Washington and Jeffrson is another men

! tor who teaches the young hopefuls how
;to shoot forward passes and baskets.
! Among the many football heroes who
I change into basketball togs along about
the end of November is Bennie Ooster
baan, captain and Ail-American end of
the University of Michigan team. Ben
nie's height and long reach made him a
wonder at snagging passes on the grid
iron, and in the gym he is equally adept
as a forward on the five. And the
Princeton "Casaba" team boasts of two
stars who scintillated on Bill Roper's
eleven. They are Mils, the fulllback, and
Wittmer, half-back.
