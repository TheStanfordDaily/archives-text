# CARD BASEBALL NINE WINS CLOSE CONTEST FROM BRONCO SQUAD
## Spectacular Tilt Goes Extra Inning; Wilton Knocks In Winning Run 
### 
In a spectacular tilt that went an
extra inning Stanford's baseball team
evened the count against the Santa
Clara varsity by a 3-2 score last Sat
urday on the home diamond. Frank
Wilton brought in the winning tally
at the end of the tenth when, Avith
two away and the bases loaded, he
drove a hard one along the third-base
line to score Garibaldi. This was the
second of a three-game series with
the Broncs, and the Cardinal victory
makes it one up as Santa Clara took
the first encounter 6-5.
The failure of both teams to hit in
the pinches kept the score and
accounted for the extra session.
Doug Lewis, who is showing im
provement with each game, pitched
eight innings for Stanford. Gene
Kern, who relieved him in the eighth,
hurled good ball. In the ninth and
tenth innings ho fanned four men
and allowed two but a couple of
small infield hits. Johnny Casanova
went the entire distance on the
mound for Santa Clara and succeeded
on several occasions in getting him
self out of bad holes.
The Broncos collected their two
tallies in the seventh on a wild throw
by Laird. The Cards made their sec
ond run in the last half of the same
frame. Levin, who did the best hitting
of the day, was on second, and Wilton
sent him home with a lilt to center
field.
There were plenty of steals and at
tempted steals during the day. In the
fourth, Garibaldi staged a one-man
! show by tagging Leininger, going
I from second to third, and then
crossed the lot and got Axt, who was
I caught flat-footed between first and
i second on an attempted double steal.
