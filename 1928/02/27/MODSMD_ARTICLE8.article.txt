# WILL PRESENT SPANISH PLAY FRIDAY NIGHT
## Two Women Play Difficult Farts; Harris, Merner Show Up Well 
### 
Supporting Kathleen Fitz and Paul
Pfaff, leads In "The Romantic Young
Lady," Masquers play that will be
given in the Assembly Hall Friday
night, will be a well-balanced cast of
experienced players. Martinez Sierra
has created some interesting charac
ters in "The Romantic Young Lady,"
and action is well divided among
them. Women, especially, have im
portant parts.
Deserving of first mention are the
two character parts of Dona Barba
rita, a thrice-married widow played
by Janet Harris; and Maria Pepa, a
household servant played by Benetta
Merner. These difficult roles have
shown up very well at rehearsals.
Janet Harris has appeared in diverse
parts in campus plays, and has scored
an outstanding success in all of them.
Benetta Merner, a sophomore, is mak
ing her initial campus appearance,
but her performance thus far has
shown great promise.
Julia North, as Amelia, a vampire,
is also well cast. Her campus dra
matic record includes parts in "The
Goose Hangs High," "Wicked Wil
liam," and "Princess Ida."
Irene, the author's secretary, is
played by Lida Rittler, who took the
lead in the sophomore play two years
ago, "In the Next Room." Several op
portunities for comedy are given her
in the second act.
Dress rehearsal for the play will
be held tomorrow night.
