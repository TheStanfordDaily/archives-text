# DELTA GAMMA HOUSE IS SCENE OF ANNUAL DAILY STAFF BANQUET
## 
### 
Marking the first time in which
both the editorial and business staffs
of the Stanford Daily have joined in a
social function, sixty staff members
dined and danced at the annual mid
winter Staff Banquet held last Satur
day night at the Delta Gamma house.
Appropriate seasonal decorations
were carried out through garlands of
plum blossoms placed on the ban
quet tables, and in the living-room
where couples danced from 9 to 12
o'clock to the music of Jim Rae's
orchestra. As novel souvenirs, a spe
cial miniature issue of the Daily was
distributed which contained libelous
and unreliable information about all
the members of the staff.
Patrons and patronesses for the
banquet and dance were Professor
and Mrs. Everett W. Smith, Mrs.
B. O. Brown and Miss Barbara Dew
laney.
