Patsy Furniture
Imagine how attractive Patsy Furniture would look on your porch
or lawn. Patsy is made of the Golden State's most brilliant colors.
It is rigid, strong, and long-lasting.
The colorful, comfortable Patsy Outdoor Furniture is made of oak,
enameled in Chinese red, jade green, lawn green, and Delt blue,
with upholstery of oil-painted 8-oz., double-filled, army duck, in
brilliant contrasts. Patsy Furniture is SO light and easy to move
about, and SO comfortable.
