held tonight. No one will be admitted
to the Assembly Hall tonight, but
those who cannot attend the play Fri
day may see the final dress rehearsal
Thursday for 50 cents.
Miss Anna May Price, director, ex
pects a polished performance because
â– of the long t _ ne the cast has had in
which to become familiar with the
play. Many of the details of action
have been carefully perfected for the
same reason. Supporting characters,
that are important in this play, have
also benefitted 'by the extended re
hearsal period.
Amelio, Fepa, and Mario, three
brothers of Rosario (Kathleen Fitz),
occupy tiie stage a good deal of the
time during the first and third acts.
Amelio, played by Herbert Wenig, is
very much in love and spends his
time writing letters to the object of
his affections and waiting for the re
turn post. Pepa, the youngest brother,
is played by Paul Moreland. Pena is
an impetuous youth who is bent on
making a fortune and upon winning
the favor of the ladies. Stanley Mul
lin is cast as Mario, a dramatic critic
on a newspaper and the eldest
brother. The domestic life of the fam
ily furnishes some droll situations.
Two other men are in the support
ing roles: Burnell Gould as Don Juan,
a semi-comic charficter, and Louis
Petree as Guillermo, valet to the
author.
