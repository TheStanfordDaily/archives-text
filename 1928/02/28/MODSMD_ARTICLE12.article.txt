# BREAKERS WIN BY 11-10 OVER ALPHA DELTS
## WORDEN IS CLUB STAR Fl Tigre Beats Business Men Quintet 18-10 in Slow Consolation Game 
### 
Breakers 11, Alpha Delta Phi 10
El Tigre 18, Business Men 10
Breakers barely won from Alpha
Delta Phi to clinch the championship
of League 111 in the first of the spe
cial intramural basketball games
played in the Pavilion last night,
while the El Tigre five defeated the
Business Men quintet in a consola
tion match.
With the game tied at 10-all in the
last quarter, Worden of the Breakers
and high-point man of the game with
five tallies, sank a foul shot after four
similar breath-taking opportunities
which failed to affect the deadlock.
The contest was nip-and-tuck from
the very first whistle and the half
ended with the score 8 to 6 for the
Alpha Delts. The Breakers rallied in
the third quarter when Worden sank
a field bucket. Immediately the Alpha
Delts forged ahead only to be tied a
second later when Worden garnered
another bucket. The third quarter
ended at 10-10 and remained so until
the winning shot, despite the furious
playing of the Moore brothers, who
gathered in eight of the fraternity
team's ten counters.
The consolation game between the
El Tigre team and the Business Men
was slow in comparison with the first
contest. Hamilton started the scoring
for El Tigre by sinking a free throw.
The Business Men slipped ahead for
the only time during the game, when
Fuhriman garnered two points. From
this time on the outcome was never
in doubt. The redoutable Johnson,
who scored five field goals for El
Tigre, proved too much for the less
accurate Business Men forwards, and
El Tigre won 18 to 10.
