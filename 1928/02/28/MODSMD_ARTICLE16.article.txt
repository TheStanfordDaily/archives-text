# CARDINAL FRESHMAN NINE TO CLASH WITH BURLINGAME PLAYERS
## 
### 
Burlingame High School will jour
ney down the peninsula this after
noon to meet the Cardinal babes in
a baseball contest at 3:130 o'clock on
the varsity diamond. This will be the
third game for the undefeated fresh
men.
Burlingame presents formidable
opposition to the Stanford batsmen
in the form of A1 Johnson, star
pitcher. Johnson has a great deal of
speed and a fine curve ball.
Coach Wolter believes that the
yearlings have a good chance to win
the game. In practice last night they
exhibited more pep than has been
shown in a long time. The men are
constantly drilling on batting work to
improve their somewhat inconsistent
offensive.
Four new men, all members of the
1931 basketball squad, reported for
horsehide practice last night. These
players are Jim Mears, pitcher; Mike
Reynolds, outfielder; Vard Loomis,
pitcher; and Virgil Hepp, pitcher.
Mears and Reynolds give promise of
developing into heavy hitters as they
each made several long hits in their
first practice season. Mears was all
city prep school catcher in Los An
geles last season.
