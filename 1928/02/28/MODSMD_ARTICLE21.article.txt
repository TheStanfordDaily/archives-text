# STANFORD'S VARSITY NINE PRACTICES FOR GAME WITH SAINTS
## Santa Clara Drops Out of Conference; Cardinals Have Clean Slate 
### 
With the prowess of St. Mary's
baseball team well in mind, Stan
ford's varsity men are spending Mon
day and Tuesday afternoons in in
tensive practice in preparation for
their second game with the Saints
tomorrow afternoon on the home
field.
The batting eye of the Cardinals,
which has been steadily improving,
will have to be in focus if Stanford
is again to take the measure of the
Saints who possess some of the heav
iest hitters in the conference.
As Santa Clara was obliged to drop
out of the California Intercollegiate
Conference because of the time re
quired of the team in the production
of *he school's Passion Plnv, Stanford,
with the St. Mary's game to its credit,
has a clean slate. The Saints should
prove one of the strongest opponents
in the circuit.
Jack Levin and "Pooch" Garibaldi
are leading the Stanford club in hit
ting. Frank Wilton, as a result of his
many robberies in the second Santa
Clara game, is out ahead in the num
ber of bases stolen. "Count" Sobieski
will possibly be given a real oppor
tunity to prove himself for this sea
son by being started on the mound
against St. Mary's tomorrow after
noon.
