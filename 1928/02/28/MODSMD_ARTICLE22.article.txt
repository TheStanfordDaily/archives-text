# FOLIO OF STANFORD SCENES TO BE DONE BY FAMOUS ARTIST
## 
### 
Louis Orr, foremost American
etcher, luis arranged to make a folio
of etchings of Stanford University
similar to the set he recently made
for Yale University and Williams
College. Mr. Orris the only American
artist whose works are in the Louvre.
They are also represented in the per
manent collection of the Luxembourg
Galleries by thirty-three of his origi
nal drawings.
The Stanford University folio will
be patterned after Mr. Orr's famous
set of Old Paris which suggested the
Williams folio. The folio will consist
of six etchings, each approximately
eight by ten inches, with a decorative
title page and index plate, each
signed by the artist. An edition of
only 150 folios will be printed, and
when these have been made the
j plates will be destroyed, thereby en-
I hancing the value of the eachings,
I which will be sold in subscriptions at
j $100 each.
