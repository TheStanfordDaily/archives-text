Stanford's captainless varsity bas
! ketball team will be given a last
chance to prove its worth Wednesday
night when the much-delayed clash
with the U.S.C. five will be held in
the Stanford Pavilion at 8 o'clock.
The outcome of this game is im
portant since a win will put the Tro
jans in a tie with the California quin
tet for first place in the southern
division of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence, while a Cardinal victory will
cinch first place honors for the Blue
and Cold.
Although the Stanford five is con
ceded little chance against the South
ern California players, the memory of
the second game of the series in
which the victory was decided only
in the closing minutes of play would
point to a hard battle.
Coach "Husky" Hunt plans to start
Vincenti and Clark as forwards, with
Rothert and Thompson in the guar'd
berths. Either Smalling or Dobson
will hold down the pivot position.
In a scrimmage yesterday Vincenti
and Clark showed plenty of fight,
dropping shots through the hoop with
pleasing regularity and keeping the
ball moving all the time. Rothert and
Thompson proved almost impene
trable in the defense positions.
The probable starting line-up for
the U.S.C. varsity is as follows: Mor
tensen and McCaslin, forwards; Cap
tain Bruner, center; Lehners and
Lewis, guards .
