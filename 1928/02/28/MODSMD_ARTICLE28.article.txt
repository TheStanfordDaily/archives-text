# Probation Disapprobation
## 
### 
Conversations by telephone, hut nary a one on Quad. No need to cold
shoulder a man on Quad, though saying hello to him is permissible. And
after a customary greeting, what then? Why, the girl must hasten away,
lest her first greeting seem to invite further words. Her men friends may
wonder why they are avoided with such care.
She is merely a Stanford woman subjected to Social Probation.
Though we admit violations of regulations merit punishments, we can
hardly endorse some of those inflicted on the women of the University.
Punishment must bear a certain hint of dignity with adults else it loses
its value.
Cancellation of dating privileges or the imposition of added duties is
understandable, but to resort to grammar school methods can scarcely be
condoled in University circles.
