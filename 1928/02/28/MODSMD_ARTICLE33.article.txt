AN ENEMY IN THE HOUSE
If one may venture a prophecy, he
will not be too far astray when he
augurs that some day a man of keen
observation, and great intestinal forti
tude, will undertake to supplement
the ancients, and name the seven
"curses" of the world —as contrasted
with the like number of "wonders"
that antiquity knew. When this is
done, "Indifference" will be properly
placed well up on the list.
It may be uoted tliat indifference is
in no sense a modern dementia. We
may recall, with vicarious pleasure,
Anthony's apathetic attitude toward
everything— except the wiles and
smiles of the all-too-seductive Cleo
patra, of Nile house-boat fame. How
ever, here we are more concerned
with the present existence of indiffer
ence than with its relations to infi
delity, and Nile nights.
We find indifference an easy "out";
a means whereby obligations are
turned aside, and a basis for allow
ing us to later state our august "I
told you so," or, "It should have been
done the other way."
As a rule, indifference is disastrous,
but like all good rules, this one is
proved by its exceptions. Beatrice
Fairfax (or was it Hoyle?), once said
that indifference is the "cocktail" of
courtship. Yet, in most instances, it
may be more aptly called the "demi
tasse."
In those eventful years following
the pronouncement of the insinuating
"I do's," we see that all to frequently
indifference creeps in like dry-rot, and
slowly but inevitably eats out the
heart of love and romance. It results
in the neglecting of minor, but neces
sary, personal habits; in the future
to sustain a live interest and friend
ship with the other half of "we," and
in the gradual apathy of ambition.
Politically, we are a grossly indif
ferent people. The right to vote, to
select our own officials and laws, is
a thing for which our forefathers
fought—and bled; yet, the percentage
of persons who exercise that right is
appalling. We choose criticism and
condemnation in preference to parti
cipation.
The country is infested with num
berless "little Americans," who con
fine their contributions to our national
life to filling the free air with their
blue pean of disapproval and criti
cism of all that is being done by
those who have interest enough to
"do." They label themselves "con
servatives" because they are too
smug to think out a new idea, much
less to execute it.
Indifference is the mortal enemy
of progress. It is the fungus which
strangles ambition and leaves in its
stead nothing but a dry, vacuous
entity. It is the "Flying Dutchman" of

love, and the cornerstone of an in
efficient and inadequate political ad
ministration.
It is to be hoped that some day, in
some manner, the great public will
"come to life" and awake to its dor
mant potentiality. When that occurs,
all the wars and conflict, personal and
national, will be confined to litera
ture. In our search for the logical and
true route to a successful future, the
road marked "Indifference" should be
avoided like a disease —for that is
exactly what it IS.
