Dear Emma:
I have a serious problem I should
like to present. I am a clean, upright,
moral Stanford woman. I never pec,
smoke, drink, or go in parties less
than six when in the hills. I am as
good-looking, if not more so, than
most of the Stanford men. Yet I
queen a Stanford man only about
once a month, and then he belongs
to the Y.M.C.A. Can't you please tell
me what to do? I scarcely dare refer
this to Dean Yost.
Yours in great perplexity,
A Pure Roble Woman.
