# PRETTY ONE
## 
### 
Pretty one,
So full of fun,
You spoke gay and light,
Your hungry lips sought mine for love,
But only for a night.
Just like the skies
In evening's purple blue;
It thrilled you when I swore they were
The fairest pair I knew.
Burning kiss
I can't dismiss ,
From my fond memory,
And yet I never shall forget
Its hint of mystery.
Pretty thing,
Since learning all too late.
How foolishly I guesesd your years:
Sixteen for twenty-eight! â€”N.S.
