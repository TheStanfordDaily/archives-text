# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
The recently elected president of
one of the classes has announced,
with a salty tear, that he did not want
even- to run for president, but darn
it, he was just too busy to rush over
and decline the nomination. Haven't
we some medals for these public mar
tyrs?
Frederick Anderson writes in the
Literary Magazine that a certain poem
printed last month was spoiled be
cause of lack of logic. Glaciers, he in
forms me, move only three feet a day.
But I never knew that! I thought they
went about a mile a minute! I used
them in my allegory because I happen
to have climbed glaciers in both
Switzerland and Canada, and honest
ly, they were moving so fast I could
hardly keep up with them!
Last December, because a poor,
weak woman asked me to write a
book review for the "Lit," I reviewed
enthusiastically Upton Sinclair's
"Oil." It has never been printed; an
associate editor tells me that it can't
appear until a caustic review of the
same book is written to offset my
compliments. And all because Sinclair
once criticized our Alma Mater!
One thing more: won't people
please stop riding horses along the
paths siding Palm Drive?
