University athletes can get jobs
heroing the fair ladies of Hollywood
when they tire of the simple pleasures
of the Farm. May McAvoy, who has
played the charming inspiration for
nearly every great film Romeo, as
sured me of the collegians' excellent
chances. She was in the city last
week, making a personal appearance
in conjunction with the showing of
her newest picture—"The Jazz
Singer."
"Women today prefer the type of
the college athlete for the leading
men of the screen," she said, when 1
met her by appointment in the lobby
of the Palace Hotel. "The growing
interest of women in sports, due to
an increasing understanding ,of ath
letic games, is bringing this about.
Women, you know, are the largest
part of film-goers."
Is Vest-Pocket eßauty
Miss McAvoy is a vest-pocket beau
ty, being less than five feet tall. She
is demure in manner, fashionably in
conspicuous in dress.

"The college athlete has a follow
ing among men, too," she elaborated
at my request. "This fame, which is
often national, gives the athlete a
chance to step into films with a great
advantage over those who must
build up public interest. For that rea
son the athlete with acting ability is
being sought after today, and we have
several young college men in Holly
wood whose fame will be prolonged
by the success they are winning on
the screen. Their clear-cut masculin
ity and fine minds, and the habit of
concentration, is helping them to play
the game cleanly, and with assurance
of winning."
Miss McAvoy has been starred by
all of the big companies, being under
contract to Warner Bros, at present.
She made outstanding hits in Para
mount's "Sentimental Tommy," in
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayers* "Ben Hur"
and "The Fire Brigade," and in War
ner Bros.' "Lady Windermere's Fan."
She furnishes the love interest for A1
Jolson in his first moving picture,
and she will be starred soon with
Lionel Barrymore in a special Vita
phone production of the famous
"The Lion and the Mouse." This is
one of the very first films to be made
with the players speaking all the
lines. The selection of Miss McAvoy
to play opposite such an experienced
actor as Barrymore shows how highly
her ability is regarded in Hollywood.
