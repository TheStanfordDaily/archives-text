# CARD FENCING TEAM TO OPPOSE OLYMPIC SWORDSMEN TONIGHT
## Stanford Coach Has Little Hope for Victory Over Winged "O" Men . 
### 
Stanford's varsity fencing team
will make its initial appearance of
the season tonight when it meets the
Olympic Club five at 8 o'clock in En
cina Gym. "This will be the best ex
hibition of fencing," says Coach E. B.
Bugge, "that we will have here this
year." The contest is open to the
public.
Bugge has little hope that the
Cardinal foilsmen will win the meet
but feels that the tilt will do much
to whip the squad into shape for the
California contest March 10.
Herkimer Adams, Arthur Scotten,
and Orray Taft will represent Stan
ford. Two other men and an alternate
will be chosen from the following
group: Coolidge, Dutton, Hull, Kil
gore, Morris, Sauliere, and Williams.
All of these men have been doing
fine work and the final selection will
not be made until just before the con
test.
The clubmen have two fine swords
men in Ferard Leicester and J. I'.
Smith. Leicester is a former Stanford
man and was once Intercollegiate
champion. Smith is a former ama
teur champion of the Ea3t.
The Stanford-California freshman
contest that was scheduled for Friday
night has been called off since Earl
Green, first man on the Cardinal
squad, was injured in an automobile
accident over the week-end.
