# SEQUOIA TEAM TAKES ONE-POINT VICTORY IN MURAL AQUATIC MEET
## Theta Chi Swimmers Place Second as Two Records Are Shattered 
### 
Sequoia repeated its performance
of last year by winning the annual
intramural swimming contest in En
cina Pool yesterday afternoon. The
i hall men had sixteen points, which
! led their nearest competitor, the
i Theta Chi team, by only one count.
Toyon Club took third, with four
teen points, and the Alpha Delts
tied the Fijis for fourth place with
a score of eleven. Phi Psi had only
one less, Theta Xi five points, and
Chi Psi, Alpha Sigma, and Encina 3W
scored one point each.
The Theta Chi relay team won a
close race from the Alpha Delts in
the record-breaking time of 1:11 flat.
This breaks the Alpha Delts* old rec
ord by 2 1-5 seconds.
Another record fell when Webster,
swimming for the Fijis, broke Brarn
el's mark of 16 4-5 seconds in the
one-lap free style. The new time is
16 seconds flat.
Norwood, of Sequoia, won the
two-lengths backstroke race in 50 3-5
seconds, which lacks nearly two sec
onds of breaking last year's record.
In the last race of the day, Caglieri
nosed out Webster in a neck-and-neck
! contest to takÂ« first in the two-length
! free style for the Fijis. The four
i length free style was a slow race,
j with Babson, of the Theta Xi delega-
I tion, in first place, and Chichester,
I Ryan, and O'Brien following.
J The diving exhibition ranged from
i some very neat work on Miller's and
Klotz's part to a number of amusing
' antics which neither the divers nor
the judges could name. Alpha Delta,
Fiji, Theta Chi, and Encina 3W took
j the first four places, respectively.
Sequoia gets fifteen points toward
the year's intramural standing for
| winning first place, Theta Chi is
! awarded ten, Toyon five, and Alpha
Delta Phi split four counts with Phi
Gamma Delta, because of a tie. Phi
| Psi gets one point for fifth place.
All organizations entering four
( men earn three points regardless of
placing. These are: Toyon Club,
Theta Chi, Alpha Delta, Phi Psi, Se
: quoia, Fiji, Theta Xi, El Toro, S.A.E.,
