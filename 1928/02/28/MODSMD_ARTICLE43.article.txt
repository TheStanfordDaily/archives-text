# SPORTS OF 1928

You'd think that when a lame boy
shows enough grit and spirit to make
his university football team, that he'd
be content to rest on his laurels, dis
play his gold football, and let it go
at that. But not L. W. Muegge, of the
University of Illinois. He's more
ambitious, and a mere matter of a
bent leg, which must be dragged in
stead of lifted when he runs, is not
too great a handicap for him to over
come in at least one other sport.
So, when football is over, "Step
and-a-Half" Lou, as his team-mates
on the gridiron call him, went out for
the wrestling team, and, competing in
the light-heavy-weight division, won
his match against his West Virginia
rival at Morgantown on February 4.
He played right guard on Zuppke's
"Big Ten" championship eleven last
fall.

! Kelly, famous old Princeton full-back
I of more than a quarter of a century
J ago? Kelly had lost part of one of
his feet, including his toes, and wore
' a specially constructed shoe. Tra

from the football squad of another
famous university because of his dis
ability. But after entering Princeton
j he had the pleasure of demonstrating
; his worth to the team that thad scorn

Sport is full of athletes who have
succeeded in spite of handicaps that
would have broken the spirit and
crushed the ambition of the average
mortal. The lame, the halt, and the
partly blind are all the more to be
honored when they overcome these
heavy odds and compete on equal
; terms with their more lucky brothers
