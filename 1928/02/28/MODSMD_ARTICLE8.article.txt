# Republican Convention Leader Supports Hoover; States Issues
## 1928 Victory With Hoover As Leader Forecast by Prominent Jurist 
### Philip Stockton 
"Certainly, I favor Hoover's nomi
nation for President." The speaker,
Judge John T. Kean, of San Diego, is
to be one of the delegates from south
ern California to the Republican na
tional convention.
A veteran of fifty-years of the na
tion's politieal life, he has served on
j the bench of South Dakota and ha 3
! been Lieutenant Governor of that
! state. His well-known activities as the
j founder of the first Hoover-for-Presi
; dent club in the country and the
maker of the keynote speech at the
j banquet of this organization made
!my leading question a formal one
! only.
I "I anticipate Hoover's nomination,
j although an attempt will be made to
! defeat his nomination by favorite son
j delegations. The big problems facing
; the country this year are largely en
' gineering projects. Hoover is com
i mitted to a policy of government con
i trol of the storm waters of the Mis
j sissippi and resumption of the Mis
; sissippi waterway trade. The St. Law
! rence waterway project whereby
t ocean steamers can enter the Great
Lakes and dock at Chicago means
for the Midwest access to the mar
kets of the world and a partial solu
tion of farm problems.
"One of the issues of the campaign
will probably be the tariff question,
and the Democrats will seek to ex
ploit the Nicaraguan situation, which
will have ceased to be a problem long
before election day. The Democrats
will probably nominate Reed of Mis
souri. It seems to me that it would be
suicidal for them to nominate A1
Smith.
"In any case the result is almost
certain to be a sweeping Republican
victory. I believe that Hoover could
carry New York State against Smith
on the Presidential ticket. Hoover
may not split the solid south, but he
will certainly make a dent in it.
Great Interest Shown
"I spoke of vice-presidents and the
possibility of a farm bloc revolt simi
lar to that of 1924. I do not anticipate
any revolt. I do anticipate such fa
vorable legislation as will enable
farmers to get nearer the value of
'heir products than heretofore. The
Vice-Presidential nominee will prob
ably be either Dawes or Lowden.
Judging by the large advance regis
tration there will be great public in
terest shown in the coming campaign.
I believe radio will play an important
part, and we may expect a heavier
poll than rcccnt years have shown."
"Doer of Deeds"
I asked whether Hoover's residence
abroad would have any effect on his
chances. "None at all," replied the
judge. "It was only a political whis
per. Hoover's strength with the coun
try is unlike that of any other presi
dential candidate. He is a doer of
deeds."
