## 1928 Victory With Hoover As Leader Forecast by Prominent Jurist 
### Philip Stockton 
"Certainly, I favor Hoover's nomi
nation for President." The speaker,
Judge John T. Kean, of San Diego, is
to be one of the delegates from south
ern California to the Republican na
tional convention.
A veteran of fifty-years of the na
tion's politieal life, he has served on
j the bench of South Dakota and ha 3
! been Lieutenant Governor of that
! state. His well-known activities as the
j founder of the first Hoover-for-Presi
; dent club in the country and the
maker of the keynote speech at the
j banquet of this organization made
!my leading question a formal one
! only.
I "I anticipate Hoover's nomination,
j although an attempt will be made to
! defeat his nomination by favorite son
j delegations. The big problems facing
; the country this year are largely en
' gineering projects. Hoover is com
i mitted to a policy of government con
i trol of the storm waters of the Mis
j sissippi and resumption of the Mis
; sissippi waterway trade. The St. Law
! rence waterway project whereby
t ocean steamers can enter the Great
Lakes and dock at Chicago means
for the Midwest access to the mar
kets of the world and a partial solu
tion of farm problems.
