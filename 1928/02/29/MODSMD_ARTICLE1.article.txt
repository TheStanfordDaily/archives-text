# WOOL EXPLAINS REGULATION OF MEN'S COUNCIL
## Traffic Cases Tried Under Power Given to Body By Administration QUORUM IS NOT NEEDED Method of Graduated Fines Modeled on System of San Francisco 
### 
In order to clarify the matter of
jurisdiction of the Men's Council in
trying traffic violation cases and to
answer criticisms of that body ap
pearing in the Campus Opinion col
umn, Fred Wool, chairman of the
Men's Council yesterday stated the
following points:
(1) Jurisdiction of the Men's Coun
cil for trying traffic regulations
comes from the University through
the office of the Comptroller, ap
proved by President Wilbur. This
authority is in contra-distinction to
the jurisdiction for other cases
granted to the Men's Council by the
A.S.S.U. Constitution.
(2) In vesting this authority, Mr.
Roth made it clear that it was not
necessary for more than one member
to be present at the trial. The Council
was thus sitting as a police court in
these cases. However, in most cases
a quorum has been present as a mat
ter of expediency or historical acci
dent. It is not necessary for legal
jurisdiction.
(3) Further, it is not necessary for
the student to come to trial; he can
choose not to contest and pay the re
quired fine without defending him
self. Thus no quorum would be neces
sary even if it were required for such
cases.
(4) Should the student choose to
appear before the county judge for
traffic violations, he is still liable to
the Men's Council for a violation of
campus regulations in addition to the
state laws.
Wool explained that the fines and
method of dealing with violators is
closely modeled on the system used
in San Francisco and other large
cities.
