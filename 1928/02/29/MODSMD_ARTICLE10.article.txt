# U.S. WOULD INCLUDE ALL MAJOR POWERS IN ANTI-WAR TREATY

WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â€”The Unit
ed States has sent a sharp note to France,
verging at times upon the sarcastic, in
insisting upon including all other major
powers in the "Anti-War" treaty pro
posed by France, or dropping the whole
project.
France had sought to draw the United
States into an "Anti-War" treaty with
her. The United States saw in this the
equivalent of an alliance with France
which would commit this nation not to
oppose France in event of a future war
in Europe. As an alternative, Secretary
of State Kellogg proposed that the sug
gested renunciation of war be made mul
tilateral to include all of the major pow
ers including Great Britain and Ger
many.
French Foreign Minister Briand re
cently rejected this, saying that its League
of Nations membership prevented it.
Whereupon Secretary Kellogg went into
extended conference with Senator Borah,
chairman of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, whose hand is seen in the em
phatic language of tonight's note. It is
one of the most pointed diplomatic docu
ments that has come out of Secretary
Kellogg's office.
In renewing his proposal for multi
lateral treaties, Kellogg went further
than in earlier notes by proposing an un
qualified treaty "proscribing recourse to
war." The previous formula had been
for a renunciation of war as an instru
ment of national policy.
