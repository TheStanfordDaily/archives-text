# VARSITY NINE SET FOR SECOND TILT WITH ST. MARY'S
## GAME TO BEGIN AT 2:30 Wolter to Use Same Line-Up As in Initial Contest With Saint Team 
### Herb Wenig 
With the memory of last week's ex
citing 9-8 tilt between the Stanford
and St. Mary's ball teams campus
fans will go out to the Varsity field
this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock expect
ing a fast, close game when the
Cardinals and Saints come together
for the second encounter of the three
game series. Stanford took the first
game last Wednesday after a great
eighth-inning rally.

"Count" Sobieski will do the pitch
ing for Stanford. Recently he has
been doing well in practice and
ought to turn in a good game. The
same line-up that played the last
Santa Clara and St. Mary's games
will start. This means Sypher,
catcher; Maguire, first base; Gari
baldi, second base; Busch, shortstop;
Levin, left field; Wilton, center field;
and Sims, right field.
Hamilton will possibly start on the
mound for St. Mary's. He is a fast
ball chucker and succeeded in hold
ing the Cards to few bases for seven
innings.
With Dondero and Falk among his
performers, Slip Madigan is coming
here expecting this time to bat his
way to a win. Dondero, the Ruth of
the Saint squad, got two homers last
week. While Harry Wolter hasn't
such a heavy hitting team, his fast
infield cuts down the effectiveness of
the Saints' batting.
