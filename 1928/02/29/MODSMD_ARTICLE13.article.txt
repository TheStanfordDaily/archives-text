# CARD BABE TRACKMEN WILL MEET MODESTO, SAN MATEO SATURDAY
## 
### 
San Mateo and Modesto Junior Col
lege track and field team will offer the
Stanford freshman cinder path stars
their first outside competition of the
season here next Saturday in a meet
on the varsity track.
The yearlings showed better than
ordinary strength in placing second
to the juniors in the interclass meet
last Friday, and from all dope they
place the strongest freshman team in
years into competition Satu' day.
Dyer was probably the outstanding
freshman performer with a first place
in the 220- and second in the 100-yard
dash. Dyer's winning time in the fur
long was 22 1-5 seconds and he was
second by inches in a ten-second hun
dred.
Shove, who won the 440 in the fast
time of 51 seconds, will offer stiff
competition in that event; Parker,
miler, ought to show up satisfactorily
through the season if Brown, yearling
two-miler, was clocked in 10 minutes
3 seconds and will be the only Stan
ford entry in that race on Saturday.

Austin, Smith, and Watt in the hur
dles, and West and Woodyatt in the
high jump, are promising performers.
With DeGroot, star freshman pole
vaulter, laid up early in the season
with a sprained ankle, this event is
the team's weakest. Page, Brown, and
Beeman will attempt to make up for
the loss of DeGroot in the meet.
