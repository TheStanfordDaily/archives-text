# 1931 BASEBALL MEN DEFEAT BURLINGAME BY SCORE OF 7 TO 0
## 
### 
Don Story, lanky freshman pitcher, ;
covered himself with glory yesterday j
by pitching a no-hit no-run game to
take the contest for Stanford from j
the Burlingame High School ball
team by the score of 7-0. To further i
add to his laurels, he finished the j
game with seventeen strike-outs and
no walks to his credit.
The entire team played a better |
brand of baseball than it has exhibit-!
Ed in some time. The infield went
through the game without having an
error scored against it. Dykes John- :
son at shortstop and Chuck Teague ;
played well in their positions. John- \
son's fast fielding and accurate throw- :
ing kept Burlingame from making a
hit on several occasions.
Spud Hardy added additional glam- j
our to an already spectacular contest
when in the second inning he hit a
long fly into left field for a home run.
Teague scored the babes' first run in 1
the first period. Stanford made an- i
other run in the second inning when
Hardy hit his circuit clout. Teague !
again crossed home plate in the third ;
frame, as did Allen. Hunken, Allen, !
and Johnson completed the Stanford j
scoring in the fifth inning.
