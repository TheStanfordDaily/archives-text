# NEW INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS SOCIETY WILL HOLD MEETING
## 
### 
With the purpose of providing a
forum for discussion of international
affairs, a group of some thirty-five
Stanford students have formed the
International Relations Club of Stan
ford University. The club will meet
for the first time in the new Victor J.
West Memorial Library at 7 o'clock
tonight.
This organization is directly spon
sored by the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace and will be the
sixth of its kind in California. Gra
ham Stuart, Professor of Political
Science, sponsored a similar group at
the University of Wisconsin, and will
serve in the same capacity here.
The Endowment sends to the local
groups weekly pamphlets, books, and
at various occasions, speakers. To
promote the best interests of the
club, the organizing committee de
cided to restrict membership to those
invited. A committee composed of
Robert Littler, H. D. Swim, and Bar
bara Dewlaney has made the first se
lection of members.
At the first meeting tonight plans
of organization will be considered.
There will also be a short discussion
of the Caribbean interests of the
United States.
