# FIRST REHEARSAL OF DANCE DRAMA IS SET FOR THIS AFTERNOON
## 
### 
First rehearsal of the dance drama,
"Das Rheingold," on the Assembly
Hall stage, will be held this afternoon
from 1 to 6 o'clock, announces Helen
Stewart Cramer, director of the
drama.
Costumes for the drama are well
under way, and samples of each
model will be completed by tomorrow
night. Dyeing of material is nearly
finished, and each member of the cast
will be responsible for completing her
own costume. Dancing rather than
pantomime will be used to convey
ideas.
Dances themselves are completely
worked out by the classes, and the
work of smoothing and finishing the
production is all that remains. There
will be an all-day rehearsal Saturday,
and dress rehearsal Monday night for
the entire cast.
