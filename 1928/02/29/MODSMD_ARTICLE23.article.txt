"To tie or not to tie?"
This is the question that Pacific
Coast fans are trying to solve before
(he referee's whistle starts the Stan
tord-Southern California basketball
game at 8 o'clock tonight in the
Pavilion, for a victory in the right
direction will mean the crowning of
another Southern Division champion.
Both the Cards and the Bears would
profit by a win this evening, as Cali
fornia would then have the right to
go to the conference finals, and Stan
ford would bring a hectic season to a
good ending.
For those who base their prophe
cies on comparative scores, the Tro
jans have taken two previous games
from the Redshirts, 34 to 23 and 29
to 25. In the second game, however,
two last-minute baskets saved U.S.C.
from a possible defeat when Mortin
son and liruner sunk two long field
shots in rapid succession. Both teams
have been beaten twice by U.C.L.A.
Figured in this manner, neither team
has the edge.

Husky Hunt and Leo Calland will
both start their first-string line-ups
determined to finish as victors. The
Trojan varsity has had more experi
ence than has Hunt's players, but
they will be playing on a strange
floor. All in all, it should prove an
exciting evening.
The line-ups are as follows:
Stanford— U.SC. —
Vincenti F Mortenson
Clark F McCaslin
Smalling C Bruner
