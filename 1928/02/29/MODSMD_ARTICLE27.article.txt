# Don't Say "No," Say "Yes"

Once every fourth year comes February 29th, and thus every fourth
year the poor salaried folk must labor one day more for their monthly
pittance. What a lot of grief just one day makes! Just because we follow
the lead set by good old Pope Gregory back in the Nth century men find
themselves at the mercy of the predatory female even more during leap
years than during the intervening three.
Just how the custom of women's asking men for their hands in holy
matrimony started is not known, but a humorous statute in Scotland, dated
1228, reads: "It is statut and ordaint that during the rein of hir maist
blissit Megeste, for ilk yeare known as lepe yeare, ilk mayden ladye of
bothe highe and lowe estait shall hae liberie to bespeke ye man she likes,
albeit he refuses to taik hir to be his lawful wyfe, he shall be mulcted in
ye sum ane pounds or less, as his estait may be; except and awis gif he can
make it appeare he is betrothit ane ither woman he then shall be free."
That such a law should be passed by the Scots seems well-nigh a paradox,
although it may point to the fact that they are vengeful as well as canny,
for maybe all of the borough councillors were married men.
In addition to the "ane pound" mentioned in the Scotch annals several
other penalties, such as a five-pound box of candy or a silk dress, have
grown into customs.
Feeling that this leap-year custom is a menace to society, that it is
tearing up the roots of liberty and freedom upon which these United
States are formed, the Daily views with alarm, nay positive fright, the
possible degeneration and degradation its continuance will involve.
Therefore, feeling so strongly on the subject, the Daily outlines a
plan whereby the "picked" may be the "pickers." Our motto is: Get Good
from Evil. And the method is this: When a young woman asks you to
marry her, expecting that you will refuse and then calmly run down and
buy the customary box, don't say "No," say "Yes." Then, while she is
sufficiently he-muddled just reach over and unclasp her sorority pin, or
get a promise of an engagement ring.
Now, you see, you have her. After that, you will have to work out
your own destiny, for it will depend on the facts in the particular case (ask
any law professor). But, anyway, that will save the cost of the box of
candy, and perhaps put a stop to this fearful custom that is threatening our
very civilization.

pittance. What a lot of grief just one day makes! Just because we follow
the lead set by good old Pope Gregory back in the Nth century men find
themselves at the mercy of the predatory female even more during leap
years than during the intervening three.
Just how the custom of women's asking men for their hands in holy
matrimony started is not known, but a humorous statute in Scotland, dated
1228, reads: "It is statut and ordaint that during the rein of hir maist
blissit Megeste, for ilk yeare known as lepe yeare, ilk mayden ladye of
bothe highe and lowe estait shall hae liberie to bespeke ye man she likes,
albeit he refuses to taik hir to be his lawful wyfe, he shall be mulcted in
ye sum ane pounds or less, as his estait may be; except and awis gif he can
make it appeare he is betrothit ane ither woman he then shall be free."
That such a law should be passed by the Scots seems well-nigh a paradox,
although it may point to the fact that they are vengeful as well as canny,
for maybe all of the borough councillors were married men.
In addition to the "ane pound" mentioned in the Scotch annals several
other penalties, such as a five-pound box of candy or a silk dress, have
grown into customs.
Feeling that this leap-year custom is a menace to society, that it is
tearing up the roots of liberty and freedom upon which these United
States are formed, the Daily views with alarm, nay positive fright, the
possible degeneration and degradation its continuance will involve.
Therefore, feeling so strongly on the subject, the Daily outlines a
plan whereby the "picked" may be the "pickers." Our motto is: Get Good
from Evil. And the method is this: When a young woman asks you to
marry her, expecting that you will refuse and then calmly run down and
buy the customary box, don't say "No," say "Yes." Then, while she is
sufficiently he-muddled just reach over and unclasp her sorority pin, or
get a promise of an engagement ring.
Now, you see, you have her. After that, you will have to work out
your own destiny, for it will depend on the facts in the particular case (ask
any law professor). But, anyway, that will save the cost of the box of
candy, and perhaps put a stop to this fearful custom that is threatening our
very civilization.
Once every fourth year comes February 29th, and thus every fourth
year the poor salaried folk must labor one day more for their monthly
pittance. What a lot of grief just one day makes! Just because we follow
the lead set by good old Pope Gregory back in the Nth century men find
themselves at the mercy of the predatory female even more during leap
years than during the intervening three.
