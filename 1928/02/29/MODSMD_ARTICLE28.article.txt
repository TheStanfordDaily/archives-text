In today's paper Men's Council makes a reply to the recent accusation
of Fred A. Menke. It points out that in cases where there was no quorum
present, no quorum was needed. The matter of traffic rules was handled
by the Comptroller of the University, and at his request, Men's Council
agreed to take over the duties of hearing particular cases.
Thus, this work is distinctly separated from matters involving the honor
system, or violations of social regulations, these functions being delegated
to the Council by the A.S.S.U. Constitution. In no instance has the group
acted without a quorum in the latter cases.
Students can be assured that the men on the Council are not trying to
put anything over on them.
Another action taken yesterday was to inform the Daily that in the
future all cases will be made public. The names of the men involved will
not, of course, appear, but violations and penalties will be published in
the Daily after each meeting. This should help to clear up any misunder
standings that might arise or have arisen in the past.
