"MONEY WRITES," by Upton Sin
clair. A. & C. Boni. New York.
Upton Sinclair has been going
about for a generation upsetting tra
ditions —and at fifty he is still the
indomitable enemy of "privilege,"
whether that be the right to steal
millions outright—or the chance to
make a fortune out of best-sellers.
His passionate earnestness is another
American tragedy. He will not forget
the woes of the underdog, even
though that dog bite the hand that
feeds him.
Therefore let the so-called intelli
gent reader of "Money Writes," even
while he chuckles at the palpable
hits of an American Juvenal, still feel
the tremendous humanity of the man
underneath. Specifically, in this book,
he finds James Branch Cabell, Rupert
Hughes, Sinclair Lewis, and a host of
others —wanting. If anybody smells
their faults, Upton Sinclair does. At
least he sets so many of them down
on paper that some famous authors
would spend the rest of their lives
living the past down —if everybody
agreed with this most brilliant of

traducers.
Brilliant is Upton Sinclair in this
book. There are more chuckles to the
page in "Money Writes" than in all
the volumes of sophisticated humor
poured out this year. He is excruci
atingly human with it all. Upton Sin
clair, like Henry Louis Mencken, is
the enthusiast and the advocate —and
the rationalist.
But Upton Sinclair attracts you
with his appealing eyes where H. L.
Mencken is likely to repel you with
a cold glare. In this book Mr. Sinclair
accuses Mr. Mencken of being a tool
of the Demon Hum. And the maga
zine which Mencken edits conies in
for a sound lashing, therewith. Born
in the South, Upton Sinclair still re
tains the good old-fashioned notions
of sex morality and a distaste for the
days of whiskey (that is to say, good
whiskey)—in spite of the fact that
he is America's chief radical.
Anybody with an effioient sense of
humor, regardless of his opinions or
prejudices, should get the kick of his
life out of this book —unless, per
chance, his "record" appears in its
pages. —E.L.S.
