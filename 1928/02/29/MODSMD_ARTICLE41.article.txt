# SPORTS OF 1928
## He "Chews" to Run 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Fate must have something unusual i
in store tonight. The Knights of
Columbus stage'their annual indoor;
games in Madison Spuare Gardens, j
New York, and a young Hiawatha!
has come East to make his first ap-'
pearance in defense of the honors
that he won in Nebraska last July, i
Fate chose a date that occurs only
once every four years for this young
redskin's debut in the eyes of the
effete East, and combining that with j
the fact that the young brave's first j
name is Fait, you have a setting that
augurs some sort of a remarkable
performance.
Fait "Chief" Elkins, Iroquois In
dian athlete from the University of
Nebraska, will compete in the sep
tathlon, or seven-event all-around
test, at the "Casey" games. Great
interest surrounds the Chief's initial
New York appearance, as he is the
National A. A. U. decathlon title hold- I

er, and one of America's best bets to
win that event at the Amsterdam
Olympics. In winning his title at
Lincoln last July, Elkins established
a new American record of 7,574.42
points, and defeated such famous all
around athletes as Osborn, the Olym
pic champion and world's record
holder, Emerson Norton, Tony Plan
sky, Harry Frieda, Vernon Kennedy,
Penn Relay champion, and Jim
Stewart.

Besides being the greatest all
around Indian athlete since Jim
Thorpe's day, Elkins is as colorful as
they make 'em. It is a great sight to
see him prepare to vault. He wears
a skull cap, chews a bit of a cud of
plug-cut, sends out a brown stream
of tobacco juice from his mouth, and
then starts his run. I imagine that
the K. of C. management would do
well to equip the Garden arena with
cuspidors for tonight's events.
