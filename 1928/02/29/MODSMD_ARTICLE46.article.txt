"Woodward of the Sigma Nu team,

teammates, sank a neat backhand
shot under the basket to snatch vie- :
tory from defeat in the last minutes
of their game with Encina 1W in the '
first contest of the intramural basket
ball tournament. The score, 17 to 16, ;
gives indication of the closeness of'
the struggle.

three times, and the freshmen were I
ahead five times. In the third quarter j
with the score tied, Encina took ad- j
vantage of three successive foul shots j
by Beeman and slipped ahead mo- j
mentarily for the longest lead that j

game. It looked as though all chance :
of victory was lost to the Sigma Nu I
team, but they rallied at the last to
win the game.
The Indians team defeated Theta
Xi in a hard-fouglit game 30 to 22 in |
the second contest of the evening.!
Starting with a sudden rally Theta Xi
men scored eight points, all made by
Damianakes, star Theta Xi player, be-1
fore the Indians could find them
selves. The Indians quintet then woke j
up and returned the rally, bringing ■
the score to 18-14 at half-time.
Starting the second half the Indians j
put up an offense that completely i
overwhelmed the weakening frater- j

nity team. Four baskets were scored
in succession while the Theta Xi were 1
unable to Ret within scoring distance
of their opponents' goal. Close guard- '

teammates, sank a neat backhand
shot under the basket to snatch vie- :
tory from defeat in the last minutes
of their game with Encina 1W in the '
first contest of the intramural basket
ball tournament. The score, 17 to 16, ;
gives indication of the closeness of'
the struggle.
Sigma Nu led six different times j
during the contest, the score was tied j
three times, and the freshmen were I
ahead five times. In the third quarter j
with the score tied, Encina took ad- j
vantage of three successive foul shots j
by Beeman and slipped ahead mo- j
mentarily for the longest lead that j
was held by either team during the j
game. It looked as though all chance :
of victory was lost to the Sigma Nu I
team, but they rallied at the last to
win the game.
The Indians team defeated Theta
Xi in a hard-fouglit game 30 to 22 in |
the second contest of the evening.!
Starting with a sudden rally Theta Xi
men scored eight points, all made by
Damianakes, star Theta Xi player, be-1
fore the Indians could find them
selves. The Indians quintet then woke j
up and returned the rally, bringing ■
the score to 18-14 at half-time.
Starting the second half the Indians j
put up an offense that completely i
overwhelmed the weakening frater- j

nity team. Four baskets were scored
in succession while the Theta Xi were 1
unable to Ret within scoring distance
of their opponents' goal. Close guard- '
ing by the Indians spoiled every
Theta Xi threat.
