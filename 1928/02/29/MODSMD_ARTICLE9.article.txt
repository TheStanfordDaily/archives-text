# Natures Of Birds May Vary With Different Environment Says Wood
## Friendship With Feathered Creatures of Air Real Thing, Is Claimed Talk Illustrated by Colored Slides of Rare Species Found in Tropics 
### 
"Birds are indeed our feathered
brothers of the air, and their com
panionship is a genuine thing," said
Dr. Casey Wood, lecturer in orni
thology here this quarter, in an il
lustrated lecture on "Some Tropical
Birds I Have Known" in the Little
Theatre last night. As an example, he
described a friendship which once
grew up between himself and the
Curasso bird, which is about the size
of a turkey, while he was in the Fiji
Islands.

Dr. Wood declared that it is dan
gerous to introduce birds, flora, or
mammals into a strange country and
to expect them to act in the same
manner as in their former habitat.
He gave as an illustration of this the
adverse results obtained from the in
troduction of the Indian Mynah birds
into the Fiji Islands. The Tristis bird
of this species was very useful in
India as a destroyer of small harmful
animals, but when transported into
the Fijis developed into a useless
scavenger bird.

Colored slides were shown for the
many birds which the lecturer dis
cussed. Among them were views of
the Chili Pigeon, which lives on red
chili; the Nutmeg Pigeon; several
kinds of doves; (he Sun Bird; the
Drongo, or king crow; and several
kinds of parrots. Of the doves he gave
especial attention to the Golden
Doves and the Flame-Colored Doves
of the Fiji Islands. He said that the
latter, which live also in Australia,
have been called the most beautiful
birds in that continent.
The Fiji Islands ha,ve a climate
well suited to tropical growth and
abundant bird life, according to Dr.
Wood. Throughout the year it is
somewhat similar to that of Palo Alto
during the summertime. He said that
he spent the months among the vari
ous islands studying the bird life.
