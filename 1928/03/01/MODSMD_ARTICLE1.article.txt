April G when the Masque Ball planned '
by the Rally Committee for that date j
■occurs. This action of the Rally Com- J
mittee revives a tradition that was
discontinued in 1924 when the last j
ball was given.
The Masque Ball is an all-Univer-'
sity event. This year it will probably j
take the place of the costume dances |
that are usually given, such as the j
S.A.E. masquerade.
Plans for the ball which will be the I
first Friday night in spring quarter, i
•will be made tonight when the Rally'
Committee meets at 7 o'clock for that!
purpose. Many novelties and surprises'
are being arranged to make the affair J
most unique, according to Bob Fraser,
•chairman of the Rally Committee.
The Masque Ball, or some other
social function that fills its place, has!
been a tradition in the history of the i
University. In 1924 the motif used ;
was that of a playground. Huge
•chutes comprised the entrance to the ;
dance floor, and much merriment was j
-caused by the sliding and shrieking
of the feminine members of the as
semblage as they entered the ball- j
room most informally.
In earlier days a Spring Carnival
was held. Encina was the scene of
gaiety where sideshows, booths of
flowers and candy, and entertainment
of the good old days held sway. The
different living groups entered a com
petition for the best booths or amuse
ments. Relics of loving cups awarded
for prize shows can be seen in almost
any of the houses on the Row at the
present time.
The Masque Ball for Spring quar
ter will bring back the fun and jollity j
of these good old days, and will add j
to the gaiety of the nineties the in- 1
toxieating joys of the second decade
of the twentieth century.
Long live King Carnival!
