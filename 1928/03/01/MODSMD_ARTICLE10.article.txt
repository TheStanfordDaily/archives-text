# K.A.'S DOWN CLUBMEN IN ELIMINATION GAME
## 
### 
Kappa Alpha, considered one of the
best teams of the various league
leaders in the recent intramural con
test had little trouble in downing El
Toro, another league winner, 23 to 12,
in the third game of the championship
elimination play last night.
Kappa Alpha took the lead in the
first few minutes and kept increasing
their load as the game wore on. After
the exciting games Tuesday night,
this one was dull except for the
snappy play of Davis, Kappa Alpha
forward, who with 10 points was high
point man.
