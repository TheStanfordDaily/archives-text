## 
### 
That Stanford men are interested in
aeronautics is shown by the fact that nine
university students and one assistant pro
fessor are learning flying at the recently
opened Palo Alto School of Aviation.
Assistant Professor John Buckwalter,
of the aeronautics laboratory, is absorb
ing practical knowledge of the air under
the tutelage of Lieutenants Goddard and
Brown, heads of the institution.
John P. Adams, Harold Dietrich, Lloyd
Dow, Earl Green, William Hollings
worth, L. Warren Hunter, Charles Mc-
Lean, and Rufus Ranney are the students
who have enrolled.
Major Edson Mouton, inspector for
northern California of the aeronautics
branch of the Department of Commerce,
yesterday conducted a rigorous inspection
of the pilots and ships at the school.
Both were given his official approval.
This examination was voluntary on the
part of school officials, as they could oper
ate under the laws of the state of Cali
fornia without federal sanction.
Lieutenant W. H. Brown, who had not
done any flying under the department,
was given the tests required of those
seeking government licenses. Among the
difficult performances required was the
accomplishment of a dead-stick landing
from the height of 1000 feet which ne
cessitates making a 360-degree turn with
a dead motor, and landing within 300
feet of a given line on the field.
