In a close, fast ball game, St. Mary's j
varsity evened the series with Stan
ford by taking the second tilt 2-1
yesterday afternoon on the home
field. From the sixth inning on with
the score one up, it was anybody's
game.
The Cards collected their lone run |
in the fourth. Sobieski sent a hit to
center that rattled the boards and
enabled him to reach second. He went
to third on a wild pitch and came
home on Busch's grounder. Dondero
started the Saints toward their win
when in the sixth he lifted the ball
over the left center field fence. In
the next frame Bettencourt walked, ,
stole second, and was sent home for j
the winning Saint run by Ackerman,
who doubled.
Sobieski, who pitched the entire i
nine periods, started slowly and got
himself into one of those "embar
rassing situations" right in the second
inning when three men got on the j
bases with only one away. He saved
himself when he fanned the next two
batters. Awkward base-running some
what marred the tilt which otherwise 1
was another good one to see from 1
the grandstand.
