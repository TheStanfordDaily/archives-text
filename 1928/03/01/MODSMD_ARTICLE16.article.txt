# STOCK SPECULATION CALLED MENACE TO STABILITY OF NATION
## 
### 
market speculation has created a
"hazardous" situation calling for all
of the indirect pressure which the
Federal Reserve Board can exert to
check it, Dr. H. Parker Willis, one
of the drafters of the Federal Reserve
Act and a widely known banking au
thority, told the Senate Banking and
Currency Committee today. He said
frankly the situation was a "menace"
to the stability of the country.
Dr. Willis was called before the
committee to advise it regarding the
LaFollette resolution, aimed at curb
ing the unprecedented pouring of
money into stock market speculation.
Loans to brokers recently went up
to nearly $4,000,000,000 and the Fed
eral Reserve Bank raised rediscount
rates all over the country checking
this sum. But Dr. Willis told the com
mittee the situation was still serious
1 and required the utmost care in han
' dling to prevent untoward conse
j quences.
| lie urged complete revision of the
Federal Reserve Act to meet this and
other difficulties which have de
veloped since the war. lie charged
that some of its provisions are de
liberately ignored by the Board and
' declared that the way it was being
I operated now was "dangerous."
