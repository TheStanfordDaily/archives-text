# SAN MATEO, MODESTO ENCOUNTER YEARLING TRACKMEN SATURDAY
## Freshman Squad's Strength Due for Test in First Seasonal Match 
### 
Facing the San Mateo and Modesto
Junior College squads on the track at
10 o'clock Saturday morning, the 1931
track team will undertake its first compe
tition of the year and incidentally give
the campus a line on its ability, which has
been rated so high by track officials.
The showing of Hoc Dyer and Maynor
Shove makes them favorites in the 100,
20, and 440-yard sprints, while Robert
Brown, who finished right behind Henry
Coe in the meet last Friday and placed
a second with the time of 10 minutes 3
seconds, looks good for a victory in this
event. Dawson is a potential winner in
the shot put, having reached over 42 feet
in practice. A number of other men are
expected to come through in the field
events with good showings.
Allan McDermott has passed 22 feet
in the broad jump and is a first-rate
sprinter. He will run in the mile relay
with Hec Dyer, Jim Howell, and Maynor
Shove. This is a fast combination and is
expected to be a winning one.

March 10 — Oakland High Schools
(All-Stars)—Old Track.
