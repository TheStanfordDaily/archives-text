By defeating Stanford 34 to 27 in
I a closely played contest last night,
j University of Southern California
barely won the right as Southern
! Division titleholders to meet Wash
ington University for the basketball
i championship of the Pacific Coast
! Conference.
The minutes of the Pacific Coast
. Conference basketball constitution
i call for the team taking the series
between two schools to be counted as
the winners in case of a tie. This
1 automatically makes the Trojans win
ners of the Southern Division instead
of tying with California, as the latter
were beaten two out of three games
against S.C. The graduate managers
of both schools reached the above
decision yesterday afternoon.
Stanford's hard-working varsity
showed some of the best basketball
it has displayed this season and near
ly spoiled the evening for the South
erners as Coach Hunt's men four
times fought their way to tie the
score in the first half, which finally
ended 21 to 16 in favor of the Tro
i jans.
If it had not been for the sharp
shooting of Cano, versatile U.S.C. for
ward, the Cardinals might have come
out victorious, for this Trojan counted
for sixteen of his team's points. Small
ing, Card center, was high-point man
; for Stanford, making eleven tallies.
Starting out with a swift passing
and shooting attack, the Cardinals
pulled out of a hole to break into the
lead, 22 to 21, with Smalling and
Richards doing the heavy work. After
a foul shot basket by Lehners, South
! ern guard, Berg tied the score twen
ty-four all. Three baskets by Cano
put the Trojans ahead again. Stan
ford was a constant threat until the
' game ended, as the Cardinals re
doubled their efforts to score.
Rothert and Thompson played stel
| lar ball for the Redshirts. These two
sophomore guards were in practically
j every play and were going at top
notch. Smalling and Clark showed
| better than they have so far on the
! home floor.

out victorious, for this Trojan counted
for sixteen of his team's points. Small

; for Stanford, making eleven tallies.
Starting out with a swift passing
and shooting attack, the Cardinals
pulled out of a hole to break into the
lead, 22 to 21, with Smalling and
Richards doing the heavy work. After
a foul shot basket by Lehners, South
! ern guard, Berg tied the score twen
ty-four all. Three baskets by Cano
put the Trojans ahead again. Stan
ford was a constant threat until the
' game ended, as the Cardinals re
doubled their efforts to score.
Rothert and Thompson played stel
| lar ball for the Redshirts. These two
sophomore guards were in practically
j every play and were going at top
notch. Smalling and Clark showed
| better than they have so far on the
! home floor.
