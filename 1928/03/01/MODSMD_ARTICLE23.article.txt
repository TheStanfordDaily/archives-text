### 
Airplane enthusiasts will soon be given
the opportunity to observe and study a
navy pursuit plane and a power aircraft
| engine both stored upstairs in the Gug-
I genheim Laboratory. The plane, a madcl
1 TS3 navy biplane built since the war,
I has been given to the Stanford aeronau
tics school by the Naval Aircraft Factory
; of Philadelphia.
The craft has not been entirely set up |
! yet, lacking the wings and the motor. '
I When the plane is fully erected the body
i will he stripped of part of the covering j
j to allow students to study the structure '
' of a typical scout ship. The machine is
! entirely of wood.
I The biplane is an old condemned ship j

that has seen much service 111 the East.
It was given to the University on the
condition that it would not be flown.
When new, the ship was valued at ap
proximately $15,(XX). It has a twenty-five
foot wins spread and is twenty-two feet
long. This scout, according to laboratory
assistants, can obtain a speed ranging
from 10 to 130 miles an hour, depending
upon the horsepower of the motor. It
has a gas capacity of fifty gallons, the
container being located in the base of the
lower wing.
The scout motor presented with the
ship is an eight-cylinder, water-cooled
Hispano-Suiza. It is V-typc and has 150
