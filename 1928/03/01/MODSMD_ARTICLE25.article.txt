System after system is being outlined in the various schools and col
leges over the country in an attempt to find an adequate method for elimi
nating misfits. One college will let students in for a trial period and then
drop the ones not conforming to a certain grade, another adopts individual
conferences, still another intelligence tests. But most of these plans involve
negatives and overlook one important affirmative element —competition.
Recently the Committee on Methods of Selection, Retention, and
Promotion of Undrgraduates of the Association of University Professors
(whew!) proposed a competitive "policy which has a great deal of merit.
The idea is something like this: Say five hundred students were admitted
as freshmen, then the sophomore class would be limited to four hundred
fifty, the poorest fifty students being eliminated. The junior class would
be limited to three hundred fifty and the seniors to three hundred, each
time the least capable people being dropped.
The principle upon which this plan is based is theoretically sound.
Under it, students would not merely work to keep above that fatal aver
age, they would be in open competition with the others of their class. A
certain number automatically being dropped, it would behoove the indi
vidual to work more and better than his rivals. Thus, by increasing his
amount of work, a student should become more interested in it, and start
a "round-robin" with himself.
Until such a plan is tried 110 definite idea of its practicability can be
got. but it certainly would tend to place classes more on an even plane
with other college activities. Membership on a football team, a play cast,
a glee club, or a publication staff, is determined by competitive methods—
why not academic work ?
