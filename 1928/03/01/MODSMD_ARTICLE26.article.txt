Miss E. S. Kennedy, superintendent of the North London home of
Our Dumb Animal Friends' League, advocates birth control among Lon
don's dog population. The reason she gives is that fifty thousand un
wanted dogs are put to death annually in the British city. In order to

there be a tax on puppies at the age of six weeks, so people will dispose
of the dogs immediately, rather than let them grow up wanderers and
garbage-can scavengers.
garbag can scavengers.
Some such move might be started by ardent advocators of "the art of
being well born." If a tax were placed on six weeks old infants, perhaps
there wouldn't be so many ragged little street urchins grow into wealthy
bootleggers and politicians.
