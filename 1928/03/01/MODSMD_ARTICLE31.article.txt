Mme. Ernestine Schumann-Heink
came in for some very complimentary
remarks on this page lust Friday—
and she is worthy of everything that
was said of her splendid record in
song and life. More's the pity, then,
that there should be attached to her
name that old, sentimental bromide
that One's Art —or rather ART —is
deepened and broadened and widened
and generally expanded in a sort of
direct ratio to the amount of suffer
ing one has had.
In this case the idea was Mme.
Schumann-Heink, after the war,
which so tragically took away from
her two sons, she was an appreciably
greater singer than before. It seems
almost brutal to venture to cast a
doubt upon an idea so picturesque
and so time-honored! She may have
been a greater woman after this
tragic experience, but the importance
of past emotional background in art's
recreators is greatly over-stressed.
The propaganda about the Pasts of
singers, soloists, conductors, and
actors, and so on, has been exagger
ated enormously, with deplorable ef
fects on the imaginations of the pub
lic and the sob-sisters who cater to
the public love of floridness and sen
timent. If it could once be proved,
outside of a piece of fiction, that the

most devastating kind of emotion did
as much for the art of any virtuoso
or singer as would have been done by
three months under a good teacher,
or an additional hour of daily prac
tice! But it has never been demon
strated, unless tacit assumption and
constant iteration be taken as suffi
cient proof.
With "creators" —or composers,
painters, and the like —the case for
the School of Hard Knocks is strong
er. But even then growth in ability
is linked, to an immeasurably greater
extent, with the artist's experiences
in creation in his particular medium
than to the "bludgeonings of chance"
which he may have undergone. Real
creative talent has an existence
seemingly insulated from the world
outside, goes through its own cycle
of development, and thrives in the
most unexpected of places.
With performers, ability and sheer
technical facility—combined with in
telligence and imagination—are the
stuff of greatness. A second-rater
won't be raised from mediocrity by a
dozen frustrated love affairs or two
dozen family disasters. A genuine
talent can flower magnificently under
the calmest of smiling skies. Imagina
tion, not a hectic nor a tragic past,
makes a great interpreter—that and
sheer ability. —Herb. Klein.

outside of a piece of fiction, that the

most devastating kind of emotion did
as much for the art of any virtuoso
or singer as would have been done by
three months under a good teacher,
or an additional hour of daily prac
tice! But it has never been demon
strated, unless tacit assumption and
constant iteration be taken as suffi
cient proof.
With "creators" —or composers,
painters, and the like —the case for
the School of Hard Knocks is strong
er. But even then growth in ability
is linked, to an immeasurably greater
extent, with the artist's experiences
in creation in his particular medium
than to the "bludgeonings of chance"
which he may have undergone. Real
creative talent has an existence
seemingly insulated from the world
outside, goes through its own cycle
of development, and thrives in the
most unexpected of places.
With performers, ability and sheer
technical facility—combined with in
telligence and imagination—are the
stuff of greatness. A second-rater
won't be raised from mediocrity by a
dozen frustrated love affairs or two
dozen family disasters. A genuine
talent can flower magnificently under
the calmest of smiling skies. Imagina
tion, not a hectic nor a tragic past,
makes a great interpreter—that and
sheer ability. —Herb. Klein.
Mme. Ernestine Schumann-Heink
came in for some very complimentary
remarks on this page lust Friday—
and she is worthy of everything that
was said of her splendid record in
song and life. More's the pity, then,
that there should be attached to her
name that old, sentimental bromide
that One's Art —or rather ART —is
deepened and broadened and widened
and generally expanded in a sort of
direct ratio to the amount of suffer
ing one has had.
In this case the idea was Mme.
Schumann-Heink, after the war,
which so tragically took away from
her two sons, she was an appreciably
greater singer than before. It seems
almost brutal to venture to cast a
doubt upon an idea so picturesque
and so time-honored! She may have
been a greater woman after this
tragic experience, but the importance
of past emotional background in art's
recreators is greatly over-stressed.
The propaganda about the Pasts of
singers, soloists, conductors, and
actors, and so on, has been exagger
ated enormously, with deplorable ef
fects on the imaginations of the pub
lic and the sob-sisters who cater to
the public love of floridness and sen
timent. If it could once be proved,
outside of a piece of fiction, that the

most devastating kind of emotion did
as much for the art of any virtuoso
or singer as would have been done by
three months under a good teacher,
or an additional hour of daily prac
tice! But it has never been demon
