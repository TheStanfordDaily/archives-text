# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
For the reasons noted below we
consider it highly advisable —nay, 1
even a pressing necessity—that the
ownership and operation of automo
biles and other motor-driven vehicles
on the Stanford Campus be utterly |
and'entirely abolished, and it is our
very earnest wish that you will bend
the fullest support of that organ of.
the press whose destinies are in your j
hands to the speedy sublimation of
this project. Our reasons for thus
soliciting your aid are as follows:
1. In the first place, Mr. Editor, you
will be quick to realize that time is,
a purely relative matter, and if all
residents of the campus are 011 an j
equal footing in regard to the matter
of means of locomotion, not only will
no inconvenience result from the abo-1
lition of automobiles, but a greater'
campus democracy will come into
existence.
2. It is plain and apparent from the J
published statements of several of the j
high officers of the administration
that they are in favor of abolition of j
student ownership of automobiles.
Would it not be the most politic ges- j
ture possible to secure their abnega
tion of automobiles also by the com
paratively voluntary means which we
suggest? Otherwise, it is safe to as
sume that the students alone would
be deprived of their cars within a few
years. Remember Princeton!
3. The substitution of horses for
automobiles by such members of the I
student body and faculty as chose j
not to run would in the very nature :
of things result in furnishing employ
ment in varying capacities for those j
worthy but needy students who come
to college not to play, or drink gin,
or pet, but to secure an education.
4. The abolition of motor-driven
vehicles on the campus would auto- ;
matically free us from the tyranny I
and domination of the local small- j
town police officers, and would like
wise free the Mens Council from an
involuntary persecution of their fel-1
lows which they must find very try- j
ing and odious.
Of course, such as were inclined to,
would by no means be prohibited from
maintaining a motor vehicle in Palo j
Alto, but it is clear that after the t
latter had ceased to become a campus
necessity but few would do so. Like
wise, it is evident that an improved
and adequate bus or tram service to
Palo Alto must be included as a |
corollary to what we suggest,

As for the rest, Mr. Editor, we feel
very strongly that we have suggested
a panacea for the many ills which af
flict this campus—ills which you
yourself have from time to time noted
from the vantage point of your edi
torial column. We offer you no
Utopian dream, but only sane, con
sidered reasons why the physical
conditions surrounding the "Good Old
Days" should be brought back, in
order that the present sons of the
Stanford Red may enjoy their flavor.
May we not count on your enthusias
tic support?
We beg to remain, sir,
Very respectfully yours,
Sol of the Classrooms.

be deprived of their cars within a few
years. Remember Princeton!
3. The substitution of horses for
automobiles by such members of the I
student body and faculty as chose j
not to run would in the very nature :
of things result in furnishing employ
ment in varying capacities for those j
worthy but needy students who come
to college not to play, or drink gin,
or pet, but to secure an education.
4. The abolition of motor-driven
vehicles on the campus would auto- ;
matically free us from the tyranny I

town police officers, and would like
wise free the Mens Council from an
involuntary persecution of their fel-1
lows which they must find very try- j
ing and odious.
Of course, such as were inclined to,
would by no means be prohibited from
maintaining a motor vehicle in Palo j
Alto, but it is clear that after the t
latter had ceased to become a campus
necessity but few would do so. Like
wise, it is evident that an improved
and adequate bus or tram service to
Palo Alto must be included as a |
corollary to what we suggest,

As for the rest, Mr. Editor, we feel
very strongly that we have suggested
a panacea for the many ills which af
flict this campus—ills which you
yourself have from time to time noted
from the vantage point of your edi
torial column. We offer you no
Utopian dream, but only sane, con
sidered reasons why the physical
conditions surrounding the "Good Old
Days" should be brought back, in
order that the present sons of the
Stanford Red may enjoy their flavor.
May we not count on your enthusias
tic support?
We beg to remain, sir,
Very respectfully yours,
Sol of the Classrooms.
The Editor, Sir:
For the reasons noted below we
consider it highly advisable —nay, 1
even a pressing necessity—that the
ownership and operation of automo
biles and other motor-driven vehicles
on the Stanford Campus be utterly |
and'entirely abolished, and it is our
very earnest wish that you will bend
the fullest support of that organ of.
the press whose destinies are in your j
hands to the speedy sublimation of
this project. Our reasons for thus
soliciting your aid are as follows:
1. In the first place, Mr. Editor, you
will be quick to realize that time is,
a purely relative matter, and if all
residents of the campus are 011 an j
equal footing in regard to the matter
of means of locomotion, not only will
no inconvenience result from the abo-1
lition of automobiles, but a greater'
campus democracy will come into
existence.
2. It is plain and apparent from the J
published statements of several of the j
high officers of the administration
that they are in favor of abolition of j
student ownership of automobiles.
Would it not be the most politic ges- j
ture possible to secure their abnega
tion of automobiles also by the com
paratively voluntary means which we
suggest? Otherwise, it is safe to as
sume that the students alone would
be deprived of their cars within a few
years. Remember Princeton!
