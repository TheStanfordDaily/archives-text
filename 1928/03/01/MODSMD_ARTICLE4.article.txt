## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated freshman base
ball team will go into its fourth game of
the season Saturday morning at 10:30
o'clock when it meets Alameda High
School on the yearling diamond. The
Cardinal babes are favored to win the
%
contest although reports from the East
Bay team indicate that they will present
no mean opposition.
Batting was the babes' chief difficulty
early in the season, but now this weak
ness seems to have been largely overcome.
In their game with Burlingame Tuesday,
the yearlings collected twelve hits against
a pitcher who has had considerable ex
perience in local semi-pro circles.
Coach Wolter has developed a fine
pitcher in Don Story. He threw a prac
tically perfect game against Burlingame,
allowing the prep men but twenty-nine
trips to bat. The team has three other
hurlers who have been doing better than
ordinary work. These men arc Gillett,
Riclclefs, and Tickner. Gillett, who
pitched against Lowell High School for
the freshmen, is the only one of the trio
who has had a chance to prove himself
in actual contest. In that game he ac
quitted himself nicely, holding the high
school nine to a minimum of hits and
scoring nine strikeouts.
