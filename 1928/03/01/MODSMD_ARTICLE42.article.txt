# Four Roadsters Cause Big Jam in Noon Traffic Rush
## 
### 
Four roadsters were suddenly shoved
closer to the Postoffice during the traffic
rush yesterday noon when a rattling
Ford, driven at full speed by a Japanese
student, crashed into a Star managed by
a Stanford woman. The Star in turn
pushed the Chrysler ahead of it into a
fourth roadster. No serious damage was
done, and after a few moments of delay
for disentanglement, noonday traffic was
again on its way. All this took place in
front of the Union.
