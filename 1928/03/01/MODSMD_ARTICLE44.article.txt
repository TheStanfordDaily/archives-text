### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
March may come In like a lion, and
then again March may come in like a
lamb, and the customers who are
flocking to get tickets for the De
laney-Heeney fight in New York to
night are hoping that there will be
nothing sheep-like about the proceed
ings. It's pretty hard to forget the
Delaney-Maloney fight, which packed
Madison Spuare Garden to the raf
ters about a year ago, and which
proved such a lamb-like affair that
there was much booing and walking
out or the part of the customers.

The direct bearing between that
scrap and this one tonight is not that
it was a flop, but that Maloney beat
Delaney and was subsequently knock
ed out by three right-hand taps to the
chin in less than one round by Tom
Heeney.
That makes Delaney pretty bad
doesn't it, the night that he lost to
Maloney? And maybe there's some
truth in the rumor that Pete Reilly
his manager, must have known that
Jack Delaney was "through" when
j he sold his contract to Joe Jacobs

! recently for a mere $50,000. Three
years ago you couldn't have bought
i Jack Delaney for many times that
I sum. He looked like a million dob
lors worth of lighting ability. But
just last year he lost to Maloney and
Johnny Risko, looked bad against Re
' nault and Paulino, and knocked out
! the decrepit Berlenbach.
The recent record of the New Zea
| lander is much more impressive. He
I lost and drew witli Paulino, when the
; majority of experts thought he had
j won both bouts. He K.O.'d Maloney,
; beat Johnny Risko and Jack De Mave,
j and fought a draw with Jack Sharkey.
I He's a game, plodding fighter, but if
I "Bright Eyes" Delaney has a return
j to his old form, don't be too sure that
j Heeney's superior weight and record
I will avail him anything.

j he sold his contract to Joe Jacobs

! recently for a mere $50,000. Three
years ago you couldn't have bought
i Jack Delaney for many times that
I sum. He looked like a million dob
lors worth of lighting ability. But
just last year he lost to Maloney and
Johnny Risko, looked bad against Re
' nault and Paulino, and knocked out
! the decrepit Berlenbach.
The recent record of the New Zea
| lander is much more impressive. He
I lost and drew witli Paulino, when the
; majority of experts thought he had
j won both bouts. He K.O.'d Maloney,
; beat Johnny Risko and Jack De Mave,
j and fought a draw with Jack Sharkey.
I He's a game, plodding fighter, but if
I "Bright Eyes" Delaney has a return
j to his old form, don't be too sure that
j Heeney's superior weight and record
I will avail him anything.
