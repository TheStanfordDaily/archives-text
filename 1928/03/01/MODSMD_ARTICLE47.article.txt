# Baker Advises Engineers At Annual A.I.E.E. Smoker

### 
"Service is the biggest thing in
life," said Shirley Baker, '95, in an
impromptu talk to the Electrical En
gineering students at their annual
smoker in the Old Union last evening.
"Learn to be honest with your
selves; if you admit your mistakes,
you will get farther. I advise you to
find out as soon as possible what you
expect to do, and you will find it
profitable to budget your time."
Music was furnished by the Glee
Club quartet, and by Gabbert and
Carroll on their banjos. Marshall
Kirby did a burlesque act, and the
evening was finished off on cider,
smokes, and sandwiches.
