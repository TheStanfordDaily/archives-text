# WORK OUT EFFECTIVE SCARF PATTERN FOR DANCE DRAMA THEME
## 
### 
Black tunics and white silk scarves
make the storm dance one of the most
effective parts of "Das Rheingold,"
the dance drama to be given March 6
in the Assembly Hall. Dance and
scarf patterns are carefully worked
out, and the performance requires
some technical skill.
In the first scene laid in the depths
of the Rhine, the waters themselves
are symbolized by scarf dancers with
the three Rhinedaugliters in the fore
ground. This is in accord with the
modern trend toward using group
motion as a background for a few
dancing figures.
A grotesque effect is reached in
the third scene with the chain of
Nibelung dwarfs in the lurid light of
the underworld. Red lights, deep
shadows, and low discordant music
form the atmosphere for the scene.
In the last scene the battle of the
giants leads to the crisis of the drama
in a striking dance of primitive
strength.
