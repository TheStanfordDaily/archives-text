# WOMEN TO DEBATE ON "PAGANISM" TONIGHT
## 
### 
"Resolved, That this house regrets
the present tendency of American
college students toward paganism,"
is the question to be discussed tonight
in the Stanford women's debate with
Mills at 7:30 o'clock in the Little
Theatre.
The Stanford team, consisting of
Kathryn Teach and Rose Brecher,
will uphold the affirmative. Mills will
be represented by Helen Gilmour and
Lucy Lois von Loben Sels. Professor
James G. Emerson of the Department
of Public Speaking will preside over
the debate. The Stanford women have
been coached by George Crocker,
men's varsity debater.
Last night in a debate on the same
topic held at Mills the Stanford team
of Dorothy Fordyce and Violet Cros
hie, took the negative.
