### 
To show the necessity of directness in
business letters, W. J. Marra, correspond
ence director of the Bank of Italy, in a
talk here before a class in advertising re
cently cited what he termed "an excellent
example of how not to write a business
letter. Instead of writing an ordinary
collection letter, the writer of the fol
lowing decided to do it in an indirect
manner—with the result that the letter
was looked upon as an insult."
"Dear Mr. Edwards:
"1 was interested to note in yesterday's
paper the successful ending of the big
drive in behalf of Blank College. Truly
a remarkable achievement and one which
will mean much to the youth of our land!
"Knowing that a son of yours entered

j the Blank College last fall, this news
| item held a special interest for me. I
! sincerely compliment you upon selecting
a college for your boy which has such
| splendid prospects and I am sure you will
be repaid many times over for your far
seeing efforts 011 behalf of his future
which we can well say is already assured.
"Oh, by the way, Mr. Edwards, I no
ticed there is a bill of $50 which is con
siderably past due. Doubtless it has been
overlooked. Can't we have your check
by return mail? Thanks."
The following letter is the answer re
ceived :
"Gentlemen:
"I have your letter of the eleventh die
tated by A. Nixon whom I would not
know from a bale of hay if 1 saw him.
Just why lie should concern himself with
my personal affairs is a mystery to me.
If he has any of his own, I would advise
him to attend to them.
"1 am enclosing my check which was
made out and in the outgoing mail when
his letter was received. I would have sent
it before but 1 had to go to this pin
headed college to get my fool son out of
jail. I don't feel as certain as you do
about his future, not by a lot. The en
dowment he and that college both need
is brains. In fact, I wouldn't be sur
prised if that was your trouble.
"Take a good look at this check be
cause it's the last one you will get from I
me until your interest in my personal
affairs subsides."

If he has any of his own, I would advise
him to attend to them.

made out and in the outgoing mail when
his letter was received. I would have sent
it before but 1 had to go to this pin
headed college to get my fool son out of
jail. I don't feel as certain as you do
about his future, not by a lot. The en
dowment he and that college both need
