# VARSITY SWIMMERS DOPED TO SET SIX RECORDS SATURDAY
## Brandsten Prophesies Cards Will Repeat Last Year's Victory Over Bear Squad 
### 
Stanford varsity swimming team will
enter the water in Athens Club pool next
Saturday night at 8 o'clock doped to
break five out of a possible six Coast rec
ords in the meet against California.
The Bears are not given even a shad
owy chance of winning, and will be lucky
to get even a second place, competing
against the all-star Cardinal team.
"As Stanford now has the strongest
team in its history, Saturday's meet
should turn out to be a walkaway for
our boys," said Coach Ernst Brandsten.
"1 would not be surprised to see them
repeat last year's performance, when the
score was 58-11 in our favor, with Cali
fornia taking only one second place."
Brandsten looks for new marks in the
50- and 220-yard free style races. Breast
stroke, backstroke, and medley relay rec
ords will probably go by the board also.
The Card swimmers, if tlicy win, will set
a mark in the four-man relay. The old
record does not hold any longer, as the
distance has been changed from one to
two laps. In the same way, the winner
of the 440 free style race wil esltabish
a record, as it is a new event in the Cali
fornia meet. Judging by Bramel's time
of 5:22 1-5 made without competition
last week, the new record set will be
hard to reach in years after.
In the exhibition at Palo Alto High
School Tuesday afternoon, Ogden Driggs
cut three seconds from the Pacific Coast
free style record, and Cundall beat the
100-yard breaststroke time by an even
second.
After doing 3:24 flat in the 300-yard
medley relay race in practice, the Stan
ford mermen ought to have little trouble
with the Coast record of 3 :32 4-5 set by
Stevenson, West, and O'Connor, of this
school. The 50-yard free style record set
this month by Anderson, of Oregon, will
probably fall before Harrison's and Van
den Akker's speedy swimming; and
Throndson and Mills are to hold up the
diving honors.

two laps. In the same way, the winner
of the 440 free style race wil esltabish
a record, as it is a new event in the Cali
fornia meet. Judging by Bramel's time
of 5:22 1-5 made without competition
last week, the new record set will be
hard to reach in years after.
In the exhibition at Palo Alto High
School Tuesday afternoon, Ogden Driggs
cut three seconds from the Pacific Coast
free style record, and Cundall beat the
100-yard breaststroke time by an even
second.
After doing 3:24 flat in the 300-yard
medley relay race in practice, the Stan
ford mermen ought to have little trouble
with the Coast record of 3 :32 4-5 set by
Stevenson, West, and O'Connor, of this
school. The 50-yard free style record set
this month by Anderson, of Oregon, will
probably fall before Harrison's and Van
den Akker's speedy swimming; and
Throndson and Mills are to hold up the
diving honors.
Stanford varsity swimming team will
enter the water in Athens Club pool next
Saturday night at 8 o'clock doped to
break five out of a possible six Coast rec
ords in the meet against California.
The Bears are not given even a shad
owy chance of winning, and will be lucky
to get even a second place, competing
against the all-star Cardinal team.
"As Stanford now has the strongest
team in its history, Saturday's meet
should turn out to be a walkaway for
our boys," said Coach Ernst Brandsten.
"1 would not be surprised to see them
repeat last year's performance, when the
score was 58-11 in our favor, with Cali
fornia taking only one second place."
Brandsten looks for new marks in the
50- and 220-yard free style races. Breast
stroke, backstroke, and medley relay rec
ords will probably go by the board also.
The Card swimmers, if tlicy win, will set
a mark in the four-man relay. The old
record does not hold any longer, as the
distance has been changed from one to
two laps. In the same way, the winner
