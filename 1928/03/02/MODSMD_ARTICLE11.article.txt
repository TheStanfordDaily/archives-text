# WILBUR BACK FROM CUBAN PEACE MEET
## CALLS HUGHES CAPABLE Work at Pan-American Meet Receives Praise From President 
### 
President and Mrs. Wilbur returned
to Stanford today from Havana, where
Dr. Wilbur was a delegate to the sixth
Pan-American Conference. He is en
thusiastic about the achievements of
the Havana Conference, only a part
of which, he says, have been made
known to the public by the news
papers.
"While the public has learned
through the newspapers of a few of
the questions which have attracted
most attention in the United States,
the close of the conference found the
delegates of the twenty-one nations
in agreement and signing conclusions
on at least forty projects.
"The American delegation under
the able leadership of Secretary
Hughes has discussed with the repre
sentatives of the other nations the
whole series of problems thoroughly
and effectively."
Dr. Wilbur was himself the Ameri
can representative on the Confer
ence's Commission on Intellectual Co
operation, which agreed on a compre
hensive program of recommenda
tions; and was also connected with
the group which considered social
problems of common interest, includ
ing such matters as quarantine and
immigration difficulties.
This Commission, in the delibera
tions of which President Wilbur took
a leading part, proposed a dozen ideas
for action, ranging from care in mak
ing movies that are likely to misrepre
sent nations to each other, to the
creation of an Institute of Intellec
tual Co-operation with very extensive
scope.
"There is nation-wide enthusiasm
for Hoover for the presidency," says
Dr. Wilbur, who found earnest pro-
Hoover sentiment in the East. "Cir
cumstances seem now to be working
favorably for his nomination. The
future outcome will depend 011 wheth
er this public interest can make itself
felt in the convention."
