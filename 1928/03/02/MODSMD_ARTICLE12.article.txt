## 
### 
Scoring one run in the fourth in
ning and two in the fifth, the fresh
man interclass baseball team nosed
out the sophomores 3 to 2 in a close
and at times amusing seven-inning
game yesterday afternoon. The 1930
men made their two tallies in the
third frame, but failed to cross the
home plate again. Frequent hitting
and erratic fielding featured the
game.
Perry Taylor, sophomore pitcher,
threatened to be the hero of the day
when he hammered out a beautiful
three-bagger to left field in the sixth.
The sophomore coach at third must
have been asleep at the switch, for
Taylor endeavored to stretch the
triple into a homer and was put out
at the plate.
The second-year nine made a strong
bid for the game in the last of the
seventh when a double to center field
nut men on second and third. But
Ralph Cook, yearling relief pitcher,
pulled out of the hole in nice fashion,
fanning the next batter to end the
game.
The batteries were: freshmen —Mc-
Intyre, Cook, and Tickner; sopho
mores—Simkins, Leverenz, Taylor and
McCoy, Heinecke.
