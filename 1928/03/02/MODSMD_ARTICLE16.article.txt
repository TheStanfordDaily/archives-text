# GREAT BRITAIN URGES NEW SUPER ACTIVITY AGAINST U.S. PLANES
## 
### 
LONDON, March 1— (U.P.)— Great
Britain has challenged the effort of
the United States to build super-alti
tude fighting planes.
Already, as if in answer to the re
cent contract which (he United States
Air Service has placed with the Cur
tiss Company for fighters capable of
attaining an altitude of eight miles,
the Air Ministry has inaugurated
three competitions designed to im
prove fighting airplanes.
The three types of machines in the
competitions are:
The single-seated fighter.
The "interceptor fighter," whose
special duty will he to deal with in
vading aircraft.
The multiple gun fighter.
To capture orders for these ma
chines, every military aircraft com
pany in Great Britain is busy on de
signs. In some cases construction of
experimental machines already has
begun. Firms which hitherto have
concentrated on production of sea
planes and flying boats are turning
their attention toward construction of
fighting land planes.
Great Britain's fastest aircraft to
day—the Schneider Cup race winner
—is a seaplane. It maintained an
average speed of 218.49 miles over a
200-mile race, while the Italian sea
plane, which holds the world's speed
record, averaged 296.94 miles an hour
in four trials over a four-kilometer
course. Both records are far in excess
of any speed ever attained over simi
lar courses by a land airplane.
