# Roth Jr. Finds Risks In Empirical Method
## 
### 
Young Bill Roth, ten-year-old son of
the Stanford Comptroller, is off the
water-wagon for life. But that doesn't
mean Bill is embarking upon a career
of license and excess; not at all â€”he
simply won't climb about nor tamper
with the levers of the University
water wagon which stands in the Cor
poration Yard after the whistle blows
and day is done.
Yesterday afternoon Bill and some
of his friends were investigating how
the water-wagon is put together, and
what this and that would do, when
he happened to move a lever opening
the water valves. The water spurted
forth, quickly forming a pool about
the wagon, and each gallon pouring
out found him more and more in dan
ger of submersion. But the water ran
out.
So Bill is off the water-wagon for
life.
