# DELTA CHI DEFEATED BY BULL PEN CAGERS IN CHAMPIONSHIP TILT
## 
### 
Delta Chi basketeers fell by a 26-18
score before the fast Bull Pen quintet
last night in one of the best-played
games of the intramural basketball
championship competition. Coming
from behind in the second period, the
Encina men took a lead that they
held to the final whistle.
Delta Chi began in the first
period with a fast spurt that left the
Bull Pen men dazed. Heady floorwork
on the pnrt of the Bull Pen tied the
score near the end of the first half,
and held it to the end of the half.
Resuming play with the score 11 to
11, the fraternity team started a rally
which again gave thom a four-point
lead. Again the Bull Pen with Davis
and Lee forwards, resumed the lead
and held it.
The Delta Chi five made a feeble
attempt in the final quarters to tie up
the score, but close guarding on the
part of Bull Pen men spoiled every
attempt, while the Davis and Lee
combination made additional baskets
for the hall team, McAdoo showed
good form for Delta Chi, scoring 10
points.
Kappa Alpha will meet Breakers in
the final game of the quarter-final
competition tonight at 7:15 o'clock in
the Pavilion.
