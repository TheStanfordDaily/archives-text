# Aut Autos, Aut Horses
## 
### 
Time was when "Sol of the classroom" might have raised quite a
rumpus with his Campus Opinion favoring the abolition of automobiles on
the campus. But that time has passed. Quite a while ago most everyone
was fiidgeting around, worried over the prospect that perhaps the adminis
tration was going to stop the wheels of ingress and egress. In fact, there
was cause for worry. The occupants of the "Ad" building were seriously
contemplating such a step.
However, the powers-that-be have had quite a change of heart in
recent years and are gradually decreasing their paternalistic attitude to a
minimum. They feel a college student should be able to look after himself.
If he wants a rattle at four o'clock in the morning, let him get it himself.
I f he wants a car, let him have it and use it as he will, so long as he doesn't
bring the University into ill-repute. This is the attitude of the officials.
They don't want to deprive students of their toys.
And now on this matter of relativityâ€”how can we say that if all stu
dents walk instead of ride in cars, the relation will be identical, when in
the same breath we advocate horses? When was there less of democracy
than in the "good old days" when kings rode horses, and commoners
walked ?
As to "Sol's" contention that if horses were used, "in the very nature
of things" there would be more opportunities for needy students to find
work, it might be said that modern youth knows considerably more about
polishing a fender than it does about currying the broad side of a bay. And
anyway, the "white wings" are very jealous of their profession.
