# In Re Opinions
## 
### 
Yesterday two Campus Opinions were received unsigned. Every little
while such manuscripts are sent to the Daily, and cannot be used. The
rules for this column are that opinions must be no more than 250 words
long, and that the writer must sign his own name. Names, of course, are
omitted from the paper on request, but in case of any dispute, it is neces
sary for the Daily to have them on file. At times the word limit is ex
tended, but the right is always reserved to withhold any communications
of greater length.
