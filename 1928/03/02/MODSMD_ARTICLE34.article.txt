Professors
There is a Prof,
Who speaks in words
Like fiery beasts,
Or fleecy birds.
And yet the words,
For all their swing,
Their massive grace,
Don't mean a thing.
Another Prof,
In accents dull,
In phrases flat
Says bucketsful.
One tells the world,
In mutters coarse,
The other fakes,
With fairy force.
But which is best,
I cannot say,
For I prefer
To stay away.
