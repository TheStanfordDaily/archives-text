BERKELEY, March I—(U.P.) —
The discovery of a new vitamine, the
sixth thus far known to science, was
announced here today by Dr. Herbert
M. Evans, Chairman of the Depart
ment of Anatomy of the University
of California.
The new vitamine will be known as
Vitamine F, to follow Vitamine E, or
X, as it is sometimes called.
It is essential for normal growth in
animals, Dr. Evans said, and without
its presence in food animals attain
only a little more than half their nor
mal size and are sexually immature.
Among natural foods lettuce and
liver have been discovered to be most
richly endowed with Vitamine F.
The research which led to the dis
covery of the vitamine was done by
Dr. Evans and Dr. George O. Burr,
chemist, who is now at the Univer
sity of Minnesota.
"Food mixtures previously had been
called pure which in reality were not
single chemical entities," Dr. Evans
said.
The experiments were made by
feeding rats, he said.
Dr. 11. S. Johnson, son of the first
President of the University of Oregon,
will deliver the baccalaureate address
there in June.
