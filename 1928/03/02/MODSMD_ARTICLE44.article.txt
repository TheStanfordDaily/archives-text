# SPORTS OF 1928
## Crossing the Bar 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The pole-vault is one of the pretti
est events on the track and field pro
gram, and Sabin Carr, of Yale, I.C.
4.A. and world's champion, is one of
most graceful performers in that spec
tacular specialty. His successful
vault over an even fourteen feet last
May at the Eastern intercollegiate
games in Philadelphia was an epoch
in the history of athletics, and one of
the most remarkable accomplish
ments in the history of sports.
To say that no man will ever vault
higher would be very foolish. I can
remember very well seeing Norman
Dole, of Stanford University, beat R.
G. Clapp's world record in the pole
vault in 1904 with a leap of 12 feet
and one and 32-100 inches. They'll
never beat that was the cry on all
sides, and yet Le√üoy Samse, W. R.

Dray, L. S. Scott, Mark "Wright, Frank
Foss, Charlie Hoff, and Sabin Carr
have boosted the record upwards by
short stages until it is now almost two
feet higher in twenty-four years. One
dare not hazard a guess as to what
the record will be twenty years from
now!
Those who have the opportunity
of watching Sabin Carr vault in the
indoor intercollegiate games tonight
in New York should notice how he
utilizes his speed, his spring, the
strength of his arms and shoulders,
his knack in the matter of using his
legs after leaving the ground, and
his sense of balance. Coordination
and grace are essential to record
pole-vaulting, and mechanical form
in its last word is the principal ele
ment in success.
