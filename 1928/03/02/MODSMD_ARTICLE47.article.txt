# STANFORD'S TRACKMEN LOOM AS GREAT TEAM IN IMPENDING SEASON;
## Other Western Universities Also Plan for Strong Squads in 1928 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton's field and
track stars proved last Friday in the
interclass meet that they will be as
great an organization in 1928 as they
were last season â€” perhaps even
greater.
The flashy records turned in by
Templeton's charges in spite of the
weather and the early season were
encouraging, to put it mildly.
The fly in the ointment seems to be
that other Western schools promise
to have amply strong teams in the
race this season, also. Trojan enthusi
asts are not backward in their boast
that U.S.C. will have the most formi
dable outfit in the country.
California, of course, does not loom
as a dangerous threat just yet, but
no one is taking the Bears too lightly.
Times and distances at Berkeley are
getting better as practice progresses,
and there is always the possibility
that Christie may uncover enough
unknowns to augment his outfit, and
make it into a stumbling block for
the Cardinals.
On March 10 Stanford will meet
its first real test against the Los An
geles Athletic Club and, judging irorn
records already made by the South
ern Californians, the test will be no
simple one.
