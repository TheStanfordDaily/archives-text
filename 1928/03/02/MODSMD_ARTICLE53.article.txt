# Hays Says Sinclair Gave Him $ 160,000 to Defray Harding Campaign Costs

### 
WASHINGTON, March I.—(U.P.)—
Harry F. Sinclair, who is under in
dictment for the Teapot Dome affair,
gave $160,000 toward debts of the
Republican National Committee aris
ing out of the Harding Presidential
Campaign of 1920, Will Hays, former
chairman of the committee in charge
of that campaign, told the Senate Tea
pot Dome Committee today.
In 1923, Hays said, Sinclair gave
him $260,000 in Liberty Bonds to be
used for the party deficit. Later Hays
returned $100,000 of this. He said it
had been intended that Sinclair
should not give more than $75,000 and
that the remainder of the $260,000
would be returned to him when
enough contributions were obtained
to make it possible.
But collections were not adequate
and Sinclair, rather than have Hays
make up the balance out of his pock
et, consented that his contribution
should be $160,000.
Hays said the oil deals had nothing
to do with Sinclair's contribution. He
denied knowledge of the Continental
deal until newspaper reports about it
appeared afterward. He kept no rec
ords of the bonds although the Senate
Committee has already found that
$75,000 of Sinclair's Republican con
tribution was in Liberty Bonds
bought with Continental profits as
were the $233,000 in bonds which
Sinclair gave Fall a few weeks after
the Teapot Dome deal was closed in
1922.
