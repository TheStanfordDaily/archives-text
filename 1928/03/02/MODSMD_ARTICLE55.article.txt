### 
CHICAGO, March 1— (U.P.)—Over
the "passive opposition" of the Rocke- :
feller interests, Colonel Robert W. |
Stewart was re-elected Chairman of
the Board of Directors of The Stand-1
adrd Oil Company of Indiana at a
stockholders meeting today at Whit-1
ing, Ind., a Chicago suburb.
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., sent a let- j
ter to the stockholders stating lie "de
sired not to vote for Stewart as chair
man." This attitude was believed to
have been taken because of Stewart's
refusal to answer certain questions
before the Senate Teapot Dome in
vestigating committee at Washington
recently.
Rockefeller also notified the stock
holders that the Rockefeller Founda
tion's proxy votes were to be cast in
the same manner. Votes of
feller's individual holdings and those
of the Foundation were cast in favor
of re-election of the other eight di
rectors.
