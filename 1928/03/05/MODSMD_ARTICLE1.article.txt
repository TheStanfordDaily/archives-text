# 1930 PLAYERS SCORE VICTORY IN SPORTS DAY
## Sophomores Make 15 Points To 12 For Junior Team; Seniors Place Last MORE THAN 200 ATTEND Day Is Successful; Change Needed in Basketball Contestsâ€”Bunting 
### 
With the sophomore women win
ners of the Triangular Sports Day
with a total of 15 points to the
juniors' tally of 12 points, the annual
play day in which class teams from
Mills, California, and Stanford par
ticipated, terminated Saturday after
noon, acknowledged by coaches and
players as the most successful of re
cent sports days of the Triangular
Conference. Over 200 women visited
the campus for the event, 120 women
coming from the University of Cali
fornia.
A new program for athletic compe
tition was arranged by the Stanford
Sports Day Committee, whereby each
college sent class teams to play with
groups from the other colleges, the
entire competition being conductcd
on an interclass rather than an inter
collegiate basis. Teams from the four
classes competed in swimming, arch
ery, tennis, and basketball, and points
were awarded on a 5-3-2-1 basis for
first, second, third, and fourth, re
spectively.
Day Called Success
"The day taken as a whole was a
pronounced success," said Miss Helen
M. Bunting, head of the women's ath
lotic department, as she stood at the
door of the women's gymnasium and
departing students and coaches
stopped to congratulate the Stanford
committee on the favorabls outcome
of the day. "There is an opportunity
for further organization, however, in
basketball." she continued. "As it
was played today, second- and third
team players were playing on the
same teams with first-team players,
but that is something that can be ar
ranged easily by having the partici
pants listed as first- and second-team
material. On the whole the outcome
of the interclass plan was very fa
vorable."
May Be Continued
"I cannot say," she continued, when
questioned on the continued use of
the plan innovated this year, "wheth
er it will be continued or not. The
A.C.A.C.W. is definitely opposed to
intercollegiate athletic competition
for women, and as Mills and Califor
nia also object to its use, the inter
class plan as adopted this year ap
pears to be the most successful type
of competition possible."
The Triangular Council, which met
for a brief session at 1 o'clock Satur
day, decided that the office of chair
man should rotato in order of the
colleges which hold the Sports Day
on their campus. A fur,her meeting
of the Triangular Council \*ill be held
soon to discuss the policy of *he next
Triangular Sports Day which 'vill be

Day Called Success
"The day taken as a whole was a
pronounced success," said Miss Helen
M. Bunting, head of the women's ath
lotic department, as she stood at the
door of the women's gymnasium and
departing students and coaches
stopped to congratulate the Stanford
committee on the favorabls outcome
of the day. "There is an opportunity
for further organization, however, in
basketball." she continued. "As it
was played today, second- and third
team players were playing on the
same teams with first-team players,
but that is something that can be ar
ranged easily by having the partici
pants listed as first- and second-team
material. On the whole the outcome
of the interclass plan was very fa
vorable."
May Be Continued
"I cannot say," she continued, when
questioned on the continued use of
the plan innovated this year, "wheth
er it will be continued or not. The
A.C.A.C.W. is definitely opposed to
intercollegiate athletic competition
for women, and as Mills and Califor
nia also object to its use, the inter
class plan as adopted this year ap
pears to be the most successful type
of competition possible."
