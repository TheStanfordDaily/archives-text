# Reed Advocates Honest Men For Federal Offices

### Philip Stockton 
"Mellon declared that the collection
and expenditures of the campaign
funds were as upright as the collec
tions for a Church of Almighty God,
and with that blasphemy upon his
lips, he sits in the cabinet of Calvin
Coolidge.
"Five men sit in a hotel room in
1920, In fifteen minutes they pledge
two and one-half million to nominate
General Wood. The leader is Proctor
of Proctor and Gamble. He made Ivory
soap float, he thought he could float
at least one president."
Talks in Oakland
Senator James A. Reed of Missouri
is speaking. In Oakland before a
capacity luncheon; in San Francisco,
and the crowd jams the lobbies of
the auditorium. The crowd listens to
his broadside against the Republican
Party leaders; the combination of un
assailable fact and brilliant irony that
brought him to his leading position in
the senate, wins the crowd. The
speech is interrupted repeatedly by
applause from Republicans and Demo
crats alike, a tribute to the sincerity
and dignity of the man. Not even his
enemies dare call Reed a demagogue.
Now he sits, relaxed in an arm
chair, in his suite in the St. Francis.
He is chewing a cigar that has gone
out. His manner is courteous and pol
ished, he speaks slowly and very
quietly. From time to time his clear
blue eyes glance keenly at me as I
ask each question.
