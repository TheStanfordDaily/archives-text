# Reed Advocates Honest Men For Federal Offices
## 
### Philip Stockton 
"Mellon declared that the collection
and expenditures of the campaign
funds were as upright as the collec
tions for a Church of Almighty God,
and with that blasphemy upon his
lips, he sits in the cabinet of Calvin
Coolidge.
"Five men sit in a hotel room in
1920, In fifteen minutes they pledge
two and one-half million to nominate
General Wood. The leader is Proctor
of Proctor and Gamble. He made Ivory
soap float, he thought he could float
at least one president."
Talks in Oakland
Senator James A. Reed of Missouri
is speaking. In Oakland before a
capacity luncheon; in San Francisco,
and the crowd jams the lobbies of
the auditorium. The crowd listens to
his broadside against the Republican
Party leaders; the combination of un
assailable fact and brilliant irony that
brought him to his leading position in
the senate, wins the crowd. The
speech is interrupted repeatedly by
applause from Republicans and Demo
crats alike, a tribute to the sincerity
and dignity of the man. Not even his
enemies dare call Reed a demagogue.
Now he sits, relaxed in an arm
chair, in his suite in the St. Francis.
He is chewing a cigar that has gone
out. His manner is courteous and pol
ished, he speaks slowly and very
quietly. From time to time his clear
blue eyes glance keenly at me as I
ask each question.
"The Federal Government has
usurped powers which our forefathers
did not intend them to have. They
regulate affairs that properly- lie
within the province of the different
states, and which they are better able
to control for themselves. I favor a
simplification of our present code of
laws and a return to the states of the
powers taken from them.
"I do not believe the Republican
Party is in a position to aid the
farmer. The McNary-Taugen bill,
transferring money from the farmer
to a central bureau at Washington,
would be an oppressive measure. The
problem of the farmers is that they
are forced to buy goods under a high
protective tariff and sell their prod
ucts at the European level. The gap
between these spells bankruptcy for
the farmer. The Republican party is
in no position to offer relief except
by a complete change of National
Policy.
Favors Monroe Doctrine
"We have and must maintain the
Monroe Doctrine. Under it we must
protect our own nationals and those
of other nations when a lawless con
dition exists in Central America. The
question is whether such a condition
actually exists. The State Department
claims that Mexico sold guns to Cen
tral American rebels. I have seen no
facts to support the State Depart
ment's claims; on the other hand, I
know of nothing to sustain the charge
of those who say the Department is
suppressing the true information.
"I believe the waters of the Colo
rado should be harnessed. When I
left Washington an attempt was being
made to effect, a compromise between
the states, and I hope for a settlement
that will give justice for all con
cerned.
"The outstanding issue of the com
ing campaign ought to be whether we
wish government in the hands of
those who are either sold out before
or bought up after election, or wheth
er we want it in honest hands de
cently run."

Talks in Oakland
Senator James A. Reed of Missouri
is speaking. In Oakland before a
capacity luncheon; in San Francisco,
and the crowd jams the lobbies of
the auditorium. The crowd listens to
his broadside against the Republican
Party leaders; the combination of un
assailable fact and brilliant irony that
brought him to his leading position in
the senate, wins the crowd. The
speech is interrupted repeatedly by
applause from Republicans and Demo
crats alike, a tribute to the sincerity
and dignity of the man. Not even his
enemies dare call Reed a demagogue.
Now he sits, relaxed in an arm
chair, in his suite in the St. Francis.
He is chewing a cigar that has gone
out. His manner is courteous and pol
ished, he speaks slowly and very
quietly. From time to time his clear
blue eyes glance keenly at me as I
ask each question.
"The Federal Government has
usurped powers which our forefathers
did not intend them to have. They
regulate affairs that properly- lie
within the province of the different
states, and which they are better able
to control for themselves. I favor a
simplification of our present code of
laws and a return to the states of the
powers taken from them.
"I do not believe the Republican
Party is in a position to aid the
farmer. The McNary-Taugen bill,
transferring money from the farmer
to a central bureau at Washington,
would be an oppressive measure. The
problem of the farmers is that they
are forced to buy goods under a high
protective tariff and sell their prod
ucts at the European level. The gap
between these spells bankruptcy for
the farmer. The Republican party is
in no position to offer relief except
by a complete change of National
Policy.
Favors Monroe Doctrine
"We have and must maintain the
Monroe Doctrine. Under it we must
protect our own nationals and those
of other nations when a lawless con
dition exists in Central America. The
question is whether such a condition
actually exists. The State Department
claims that Mexico sold guns to Cen
tral American rebels. I have seen no
facts to support the State Depart
ment's claims; on the other hand, I
know of nothing to sustain the charge
of those who say the Department is
suppressing the true information.
"I believe the waters of the Colo
rado should be harnessed. When I
left Washington an attempt was being
made to effect, a compromise between
the states, and I hope for a settlement
that will give justice for all con
cerned.
