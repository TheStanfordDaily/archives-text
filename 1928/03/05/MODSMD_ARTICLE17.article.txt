### 
BERKELEY, Mar. 4— (P.I.P.)— Ex
pected weaknesses and a few unex
pected strengths were revealed in the
University of California's 1928 track
team as it went through its paces re
cently in the annual interclass meet.
Walt Christie, veteran Bear mentor,
was particularly pleased with Captain
Lank Talbot's time of 50 4-5 seconds
in the 440-yard dash. The track was
heavy from rain, and it is still early
in the season.
Harry Carter, a junior, won both
the mile and two-mile, and seems to
be cut out for California's "Iron man"
this season. He negotiated the mile
in 4 minutes and 39 seconds. Ilis time
for the two-mile event was 9 minutes
and 56 seconds.
Christie has a bevy of good sprint
material. Six men have done even
time in Ihe hundred and approached
22 seconds for the 220. Ilussel Ewing
won this event in the interclass meet
with a time of 22 3-5 seconds.
