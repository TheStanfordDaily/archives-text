## Conference Marks Lowered By Driggs and Harrison; Bramel Wins Dash ROUGH TANK SLOWS TIME Freshmen Take 56-12 Win From U.C. Babes; Burns Smashes Record 
### William H. Grace 
Staging an exact repetition of last
year's victory, the Stanford varsity
swimming team handed California a
58-11 defeat, allowing them only one
second place, in their annual tussle at
the Athens Club Saturday night.
Three Pacific Coast Conference rec
ords were broken by the varsity; and
the freshmen, winning 50-12 from the
Bear babes, broke one record.
Driggs Stars
Ogden Driggs was the outstanding
performer of the evening. After cut
ting four seconds from the 100-yard
backstroke record, Driggs turned the
220-yard race in 2:26 4-5, which is
2-5 of a second better than Wally
O'Connor's well-established time.
Reggie Harrison broke the 50-yard
free style record of 25 1-5 seconds by
doing the dash in 24 3-5. Hadley
Bramel distinguished himself by
swimming three hard races, the 100-
vard free style, 220-yard free style,
and a lap of the relay, winning the
century, and coming next to Briggs
in the other contest.
Burns Sets Record
Milton ■ Burns set a new mark for
first-year men in the 100-yard breast
stroke which will probably stand for
a long while. His time of 1:15 1-5 is
nearly two seconds better than var
sity time, although he has done far
below this in practice.
Smith, Desjardins, Thomas, and
Moffatt all did fine work, and Herb
Marsh, a diver of considerable prom
ise, but little experience in competi
tion, showed up very favorably with
Captain Pete Desjardins, national
titleholder.
Tank Rough
Because of the condition of the
tank, times made in Saturday's meet
were slower than expected. Existing
marks were consistently missed by I
a slight margin which showed the
difficulty encountered in the choppy
Athens pool.
