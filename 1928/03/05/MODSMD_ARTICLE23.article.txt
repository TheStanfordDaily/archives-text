Staging an exact repetition of last
year's victory, the Stanford varsity
swimming team handed California a
58-11 defeat, allowing them only one
second place, in their annual tussle at
the Athens Club Saturday night.
Three Pacific Coast Conference rec
ords were broken by the varsity; and
the freshmen, winning 50-12 from the
Bear babes, broke one record.
Driggs Stars
Ogden Driggs was the outstanding
performer of the evening. After cut
ting four seconds from the 100-yard
backstroke record, Driggs turned the
220-yard race in 2:26 4-5, which is
2-5 of a second better than Wally
O'Connor's well-established time.
Reggie Harrison broke the 50-yard
free style record of 25 1-5 seconds by
doing the dash in 24 3-5. Hadley
Bramel distinguished himself by
swimming three hard races, the 100-
vard free style, 220-yard free style,
and a lap of the relay, winning the
century, and coming next to Briggs
in the other contest.
Burns Sets Record
Milton ■ Burns set a new mark for
first-year men in the 100-yard breast
stroke which will probably stand for
a long while. His time of 1:15 1-5 is
nearly two seconds better than var
sity time, although he has done far
below this in practice.
Smith, Desjardins, Thomas, and
Moffatt all did fine work, and Herb
Marsh, a diver of considerable prom
ise, but little experience in competi
tion, showed up very favorably with
Captain Pete Desjardins, national
titleholder.
