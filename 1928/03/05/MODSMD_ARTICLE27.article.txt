Once again we will have with us the famed Masque Ball, with its
King and Queen and hilarityâ€”Long live the King!
This annual campus affair, which temporarily ceased its career back
in the good old days of '25, will be welcomed with open arms. Being
practncally the only large all-campus, nonsectarian ball of the year, it is
not only priced within the means of the folk of the realm, but it is
informal and gay in spirit. None of your formal this-and-that on the
night of April 6.
We hail the reinstatement of the Masque Ball as one of the best
means the campus affords of getting acquainted with our rural neighbors.
Many the quip and crack that goes unsung will be remembered as coming
from that good-looking boy with the yellow necktie, or whomnot?
The Rally Committee is taking charge of the Ball, and they promise
big things. Tickets for the price of $2.48 are on sale at the Old Union
today, and the things you can't do for those two dollars and forty-eight
cents aren't worth mentioning. .
