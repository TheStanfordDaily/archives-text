# For Women Only

Participants and coaches in the California-Mills-Stanford women's
triangular sports day held on the campus Saturday expressed satisfaction
with the new system of using interclass competition as the basis for
point-scoring". This scheme, whereby teams from each class are composed
of a combination of players from all three colleges, was suggested by
Stanford.
The Stanford women have indicated their desire to resume inter
collegiate competition with our two neighbors ever since it was dropped
several years ago. Mills and California, however, have not wished to
revive such competition.
Perhaps the introduction of this new plan in the sports day will be a
step toward realization of the Stanford women's wish. From Miss
Bunting's statement regarding the new system, it would appear that it
was suggested by Stanford as a compromise measure between the two
extremes of intercollegiate competition and complete lack of contact in
women's athletics. Compromise, we have learned, generally forecasts
further change.
Then, too, Miss Bunting hints at the problem of matching players of
equal ability, suggesting that participants in future sports days be defi
nitely ranked and placed on teams, according to their rating. Now we
understood that one of the great objections to varsity or interclass inter
collegiate competition, aside from the idea of college rivalry, was that it
was too selective, concentrating 011 too small a group the representation of
the college. Won't classification of the players lend to focus attention on
the first teams, whether representative of single colleges or not, and re
duce the others to a minor sports position?
Miss Bunting says that the Athletic Conference of American College
Women disapproves of intercollegiate competition in any form. We
understand, however, that the Conference conceded that exceptions might
be made in special cases where little traveling and expense were involved,
as in the Mills-California-Stanford group. These three colleges, more
over, had an athletic conference with intercollegiate contests some years
ago, and were apparently satisfied with its working. Now Mills and
California declare that they think we should accept the general principle
stated by the national organization.
It remains, then, to convince our two neighbors that the Mills-Cali
fornia-Stanford triangle is really a legitimate and practical exception to
this general principle.
