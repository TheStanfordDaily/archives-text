TWO GALLANT FLIERS
We must stop here and give a cheer
t'or something wonderful which had
almost escaped our attention: the ex
ploits of Captain Dieudonne Costes
and Lieutenant Joseph Lebrix, the
first Paris to New York fliers. Since
October 10, when they left Paris,
these amazing Frenchmen have flown
23,000 miles over a very hazardous
course, making an average speed of
107.5 miles an hour. Because their
flying was partly contemporaneous
with Colonel Lindbergh's flight
through the United States and later
with his good-will tour in Central and
South America, the remarkable ven
ture of Costes and Lebrix has gener
ally escaped attention in this country.
Some of the details of their flight,
made in a year of spectacular hero
ism in the air, are well worth repeat
ing.
Turn to South Atlantic
Last summer, when, as Stewart
Beach writing in the Independent
says, "hardly a flying field in Europe
was without its transatlantic plane
waiting favorable weather for a take
off on the stormy east-west passage,"
Captain Costes was also anxiously
scanning the skies, ready and eager
to fly for first honors. Consistently
adverse weather forced him to aban
don the North Atlantic route, and
with Lieutenant Lebrix, recently re
turned with a Legion of Honor cita
tion from service in French Morocco,
as navigator, he turned his attention
to the South Atlantic. October 10
saw the intrepid pair off on a 2,700-
mile hop to St. Louis, Senegal. Some
twenty-five hours later, storms not
withstanding, they reached their first
goal. On October 14 they were in the
air again, heading straight out across
the Atlantic toward Port Natal, Bra
zil. After twenty-one hours over the
lonely South Atlantic they reached
the Brazilian coast, just fifteen min
utes behind schedule. With their
machine slightly damaged by landing
on a poor field, they left next day for
Caravellas and Rio. From Brazil they
fiew to Buenos Aires and many other
cities and capitals, carrying the good
will of France.
Meet Colonel Lindbergh
One morning, shortly before dawn,
they crossed the Andes to Santiago,
Chile, touching a ceiling of 20,000
feet. Santiago repeated the enthusi
astic welcome of the other South
American cities, and cheered the
fliers northward to Bolivia, Peru, and
Ecuador. At Panama City Costes and
Lebrix were greeted by Colonel Lind
bergh. On January 26, some three
hours before Lindbergh resumed his
flight to Havana, they turned the nose
of their plane northward to Guate
mala City and Mexico. From Val
buena Flying Field, just outside of
Mexico City, they continued north to

New Orleans, in which city they were
welcomed February 4. After the offi
cial fetes at Washington, the flight
continued to its designated end in
New York City. The intrepid pair
are now en route to San Francisco,
from whence they will ship their
plane to Tokio and continue the flight
to Paris!
Costes and Lebrix have done for
France —and the cause of aviation —
what Lindbergh has done for this
country, and with the same modesty
and gallantry. We wish them endless
success on their long journey home —
and on their projected Paris to New
York non-stop flight next summer!
