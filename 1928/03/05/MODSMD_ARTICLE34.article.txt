## SHADES OF ULTRA-VIOLET 
### 
lii the East track coaches are com
mencing to prepare for the annual
invasion from the West's wide open
spaces of the insidious product of the
ultra-violet ray.
Fans will see Stanford and U.S.C.
athletes display their wares, and per
haps win meets. Newspapers will
carry stories of how the Cards and
Trojans performed.
But eastern track wiseacres will
tell of something insidious, some
thing dangerous which has come out
of the West, something which can't
be seen, but the weight of which can
be felt on the scoreboards and in
meet summaries.
The secret of the West's suc
cess is all very simple, they say.
Coaches are not responsible, nor
are the athletes themselves very
much superior. The difference
comes from the center of the
solar system.
The sun, it seems, radiates a
certain precious elixir for track
men—the ultra-violet ray. While
eastern track men are sweating
on indoor ovals, their western
rivals are blandly absorbing sun
light, and with it strength and
speed.
Brawny performers from Stan
ford and U.S.C. make their bows
at the 1.C.4A, and the A.A.U. with
complexions like those of life
guards. They can run faster,
jump better, and throw things
farther all because of the ultra
violets they have taken in along
with their sunburn.
And there is probably something in
the whole contention. It has long
been recognized that California cli
mate helps athletes, but until recently
no one thought of just why. Science,
apparently, has laid it all at the door
of that insidious thing — the ultra
violet.

But the easterners are getting even.
It wouldn't be very dignified to ask
Messrs. Templeton and Cromwell to
erect canopies over their tracks in
order to make the breaks a little
more even, so Mississippi Valley and
Atlantic Coast coaches have been
giving their charges baths in the rays
of ultra-violet lamps, and the boys
from the East will no longer have
occasion to be ashamed of their lily
like complexions when the Western
invasion begins this spring.—Robert
Speers.
