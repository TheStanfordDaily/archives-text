# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Publications may come and publi
cations may go, but it seems that at
last a Stanford Literary Magazine has
become an institution (not a tradi
tion) on our campus. When a maga
zine is formed on a campus giving
certain literarily inclined persons a
means of expression, it is worth
while, and when that magazine incor
porates certain constructive criticism,
not too cynical, in its pages then it
may be considered a worth-while ef
fort and one beneficial as well as in
teresting to those of us who can only
read that which others write.
I refer to Miss Heating's article in
the current issue of the Stanford
Literary Magazine on "What's Wrong
with Stanford." She refers to the
fact that Stanford undergraduates are
drifting from each other, that parties
rf twos and fours spend their eve
nings in San Francisco or San Jose,
that campus affairs where everyone is
a member of our Big Family are be
coming quite negligible, that as a re
sult the "hello" spirit is not any
longer a spontaneous greeting, it is

I in fact dead, and that no longer do
we have that feeling of "all for one
and one for all" but that now it is
i a feeling of "one for four and four
â–  for one." And what I ask is this.
Are we not missing a great deal by
not becoming better acquainted with
many different students on this cam
pus? Are we becoming so self-satis
| fied with ourselves that we need not
enlarge our group of acquaintances in
order to make a unified campus
! spirit? Can we not support rallies,
assemblies, campus productions and
the like? Surely most of our inter
ests are centered at Stanford Univer
sity during our four years here. Let
us see if we cannot get behind cam
pus activities, become acquainted
| once again with our co-sufferers in
education, and lift ourselves to the
plane from which we are slipping.
On April (J something new to most
j of us is going to be sponsored by a
! campus organization. Let us all get
behind it, make it a success, and start
| the trend toward a revived campus
j spirit of "one for all and all for one."
