meet in the various living groups in
an Exchange dinner given by the As

It is the aim of the Social Commit

gether as individual units. For this
purpose the two lower classes will
have dinner in the dining rooms at
Iloble, while the junior and senior
classes take possession of the houses
on the Row.
The two upper classes have been
divided into five groups each, and
the houses will be divided according
ly. The seniors will dine at the fol
lowing houses: Pi Beta Phi, Alpha
Omicron Pi, Gamma Phi Beta, Delta
Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta. The
other five houses. will take care of
the class of '29.
The groups of the senior and junior
classes, which will have dinner at
the various houses, will be printed in
the Daily tomorrow. Since it would
be impossible to phone half of the
women in the University to inform
them of their place of dining, the list
tomorrow will be the only one pre
sented to the campus.
