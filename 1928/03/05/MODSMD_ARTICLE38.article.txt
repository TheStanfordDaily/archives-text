# WAGNER OPERA "DAS RHEINGOLD" IS THEME FOR DRAMA TUESDAY
## 
### 
"Das Rheingold," the theme chosen
for the dance drama to be given to
morrow night, is the first of Wagner's
four great operas telling the story of
the Ring of the Nibelungs. The cycle
concerns the stolen Gold and the
curse it brings on all who try to
possess it, till it is returned to its
home in the Rhine.
This first work deals with the theft
of the Gold, and how it became ac
cursed. In order to present it most
effectively in dance, the original score
has been considerably shortened.
Four scenes are presented in the
drama as in the opera. Alberich, one
of the Nibelung dwarfs, invades the
depths of the Rhine, where the Gold
is guarded by the three Rhinedaugh
ters, and steals it from them. The
next scene, on the banks of the Rhine,
discloses an unhappy bargain by the
king of the gods to give up the God
dess of Youth to the giants who have
built him his castle. He goes to the
underground home of the Nibelungs
to get the Gold which the giants are
willing to accept in place of the god
dess, and succeeds in capturing Al
berich.
In the last scene he brings this
dwarf to the upper world, and ex
tracts from him the Gold and the
Ring forged from it. The giants re
turn to claim it; one slays the other
in a quarrel over the Ring and the
first is driven out by a storm raised
by the God of Thunder. Then the
gods pass over a rainbow bridge to
the new castle.
