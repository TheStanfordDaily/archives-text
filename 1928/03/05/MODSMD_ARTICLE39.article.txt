# SPORTS OF 1928
## Re-Enter The Chesty One 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The come-back attempt of Joie W.
Ray is very interesting. Not just be
cause the come-back attempts of any
star athletes are always interesting,
but because Joie W. Ray is also very
interesting himself. Back in 1915 at
the National A.A.U. championships at
the Panama-Pacific International Ex
position in San Francisco, Ray made
his debut under most unusual cir
cumstances. At that time Norman
Taber held the world's record for the
mile at 4 minutes 12 3-5 seconds.
Very few people had ever heard of
Joie Ray. Just before the race Taber
was introduced as the world's cham
pion and got a big hand. The an
nouncer evidently forgot Joie.
This rather annoyed that young
man, so he picked up the megaphone,
which was nearly as big as himself,
and announced to the crowd as fol
lows: "You've never heard of Joie
Ray, but you'll know all about me
after this race is run!" Aiter the
race was over, it was quite evident
that the "Chesty One" was THERE.
He defeated Taber quite handily in
the mediocre time of 4: 23 1-5, and
at a banquet at the Olympic Club
that evening modestly admitted that
he had come all the way out to San
Francisco from Chicago to beat Nor
man Taber, and, "with the help of
God and my coadh," had done just
that!

| Since then Ray has won seven na
tional outdoor mile championships in
succession (1917-1923), one half-mile
title (1919), two two-mile crowns
i (1923 and '24), and one five-mile
i championship (1916). He is joint
j holder, with Paavo Nurmi, of the
! world's indoor record for the mile at
4 minutes 12 seconds. The return to
old form of this cocky, colorful little
"Kankakee Flyer'" would add much
luster and excitement to the Olympic
campaign.
