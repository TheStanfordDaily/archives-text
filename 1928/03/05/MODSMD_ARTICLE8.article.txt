# Well-Cast Players Show Smooth Work In "Romantic Young Lady"
## Fitz Is Star in Second Act; Merner, North, Harris Are Outstanding 
### H. J. K 
The Romantic Young Lady ap
peared Friday night, after seven
weeks of hesitancy, and was more
charming than the most optimistic
had anticipated. The performance
was marked by the outstanding work
of Kathleen Fitz, but it is difficult
to discriminate in the way of praise
among the other members of the cast.
In nearly every case they seemed to
be well cast, and the work was
smooth, and unblemished —a welcome
contrast with previous plays.
It seems ironic fate that the un
usually long length of rehearsal time
—due to the various exigencies that
developed, a record time for campus
productions!—had to be spent on a
play so ethereal in plot, and could not
be concentrated on the more difficult
"Caesar and Cleopatra," scheduled
for next quarter. But in spite of this,
the spontaneity of the comedy was
well preserved, and did not suffer the
atrophy that was prophesied as al
most inevitable.
First Act Good
The first act went well— although
the soliloquy of Miss Fitz made us
understand why soliloquies in general
have gone out of fashion in modern
drama. In places this act seemed in
sufficiently motivated —but that was
the fault of the rather light plot. The
part of Maria Pepo, played by Be
netta Merner, was one of the con
spicuous successes of the play. It will
be a long time before we forget her
lovely dog-trot across the stage in the
last scene when Rosario, at last, real
ized the wisdom of judicious fainting.
The second act should be dedicated
to Miss Fitz, without doubt. She was
not only quite charming and irre
sistible with her own lines, but she
did a beautiful piece of assistance
with every line of the play. It was
unfortunate that Paul Plaff was self
conscious on his entrance, but he re
covered very well, and the mixup in
lines was scarcely noticeable. (Our
praise of this play is so wholehearted
that we must emphasize this one flaw
to avoid the danger of being called
saccharine.)
Lida Rittler Stars
Lida Rittler, as Irene, the stenog
rapher, was good. Spain must be a
Utopian place if private secretaries
are as charming there as she was!
Julia North, as Amalia, the dancer,
was well done, and the best of the
