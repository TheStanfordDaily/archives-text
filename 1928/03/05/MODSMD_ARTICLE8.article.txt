# Well-Cast Players Show Smooth Work In "Romantic Young Lady"
## Fitz Is Star in Second Act; Merner, North, Harris Are Outstanding 
### H. J. K 
The Romantic Young Lady ap
peared Friday night, after seven
weeks of hesitancy, and was more
charming than the most optimistic
had anticipated. The performance
was marked by the outstanding work
of Kathleen Fitz, but it is difficult
to discriminate in the way of praise
among the other members of the cast.
In nearly every case they seemed to
be well cast, and the work was
smooth, and unblemished —a welcome
contrast with previous plays.
It seems ironic fate that the un
usually long length of rehearsal time
—due to the various exigencies that
developed, a record time for campus
productions!—had to be spent on a
play so ethereal in plot, and could not
be concentrated on the more difficult
"Caesar and Cleopatra," scheduled
for next quarter. But in spite of this,
the spontaneity of the comedy was
well preserved, and did not suffer the
atrophy that was prophesied as al
most inevitable.
First Act Good
The first act went well— although
the soliloquy of Miss Fitz made us
understand why soliloquies in general
have gone out of fashion in modern
drama. In places this act seemed in
sufficiently motivated —but that was
the fault of the rather light plot. The
part of Maria Pepo, played by Be
netta Merner, was one of the con
spicuous successes of the play. It will
be a long time before we forget her
lovely dog-trot across the stage in the
last scene when Rosario, at last, real
ized the wisdom of judicious fainting.
The second act should be dedicated
to Miss Fitz, without doubt. She was
not only quite charming and irre
sistible with her own lines, but she
did a beautiful piece of assistance
with every line of the play. It was
unfortunate that Paul Plaff was self
conscious on his entrance, but he re
covered very well, and the mixup in
lines was scarcely noticeable. (Our
praise of this play is so wholehearted
that we must emphasize this one flaw
to avoid the danger of being called
saccharine.)
Lida Rittler Stars
Lida Rittler, as Irene, the stenog
rapher, was good. Spain must be a
Utopian place if private secretaries
are as charming there as she was!
Julia North, as Amalia, the dancer,
was well done, and the best of the
minor characters —though we had a
decided penchant for the brother
Pepe, played by William Moreland.
Don Juan, with Burnell Gould, was
a trifle unconvincing, and not overly
comic, but we can attribute this again
to the play. It is very difficult for a
college youth to play an old man, and
this was the weakness of both his
work and that of Guillermo, the serv
ant, played by James de Puy.
In the third act, Janet Harris, as
Dona Barbarita, shared laurels with
Benetta Merner. Miss Harris was a
most refined and unusual Spanish
dowager, and even her voice seemed
softened and mellowed with age and
gentility. Miss Merner not only was
very amusing herself, but was an ex
cellent foil for the Dona.
Cast Excellent
The three brothers were good
enough—Pepe seemed to us the most
attractive. They were well cast to
provide contrast for each other —
Wenig, especially so.
All in all —and it seems to us we
have been repeating this every para
graph—the play was excellently done,
very amusing, and a more than usu
ally polished performance. We feel
Miss Anna May Price, and her cast,
should be congratulated on their work
—particularly in view of the extraor
dinary handicaps they have had to
face in the production of this comedy.
We nearly forgot to mention the
sets, and the work of Les Kiler and
his stage crew. It almost goes with
out saying that they were all right.
The lighting and the rain machine in
the first act were particularly unob
trusive —which is the highest praise
that may be given to stage mechan
ics. Incidentally, Ave enjoyed the mu
sic between acts —so all in all, as we
said before, a good evening was had
by all!

ally polished performance. We feel
Miss Anna May Price, and her cast,
should be congratulated on their work
—particularly in view of the extraor
dinary handicaps they have had to
face in the production of this comedy.
We nearly forgot to mention the
sets, and the work of Les Kiler and
his stage crew. It almost goes with
out saying that they were all right.
The lighting and the rain machine in
the first act were particularly unob
trusive —which is the highest praise
that may be given to stage mechan
ics. Incidentally, Ave enjoyed the mu
sic between acts —so all in all, as we
said before, a good evening was had
by all!
The Romantic Young Lady ap
peared Friday night, after seven
weeks of hesitancy, and was more
charming than the most optimistic
had anticipated. The performance
was marked by the outstanding work
of Kathleen Fitz, but it is difficult
to discriminate in the way of praise
among the other members of the cast.
In nearly every case they seemed to
be well cast, and the work was
smooth, and unblemished —a welcome
contrast with previous plays.
It seems ironic fate that the un
usually long length of rehearsal time
—due to the various exigencies that
developed, a record time for campus
productions!—had to be spent on a
play so ethereal in plot, and could not
be concentrated on the more difficult
"Caesar and Cleopatra," scheduled
for next quarter. But in spite of this,
the spontaneity of the comedy was
well preserved, and did not suffer the
atrophy that was prophesied as al
most inevitable.
First Act Good
The first act went well— although
the soliloquy of Miss Fitz made us
understand why soliloquies in general
have gone out of fashion in modern
drama. In places this act seemed in
sufficiently motivated —but that was
the fault of the rather light plot. The
part of Maria Pepo, played by Be
netta Merner, was one of the con
spicuous successes of the play. It will
be a long time before we forget her
lovely dog-trot across the stage in the
last scene when Rosario, at last, real
ized the wisdom of judicious fainting.
The second act should be dedicated
to Miss Fitz, without doubt. She was
not only quite charming and irre
sistible with her own lines, but she
did a beautiful piece of assistance
with every line of the play. It was
unfortunate that Paul Plaff was self
conscious on his entrance, but he re
covered very well, and the mixup in
lines was scarcely noticeable. (Our
praise of this play is so wholehearted
that we must emphasize this one flaw
to avoid the danger of being called
saccharine.)
Lida Rittler Stars
Lida Rittler, as Irene, the stenog
rapher, was good. Spain must be a
Utopian place if private secretaries
are as charming there as she was!
Julia North, as Amalia, the dancer,
was well done, and the best of the
minor characters —though we had a
decided penchant for the brother
Pepe, played by William Moreland.
Don Juan, with Burnell Gould, was
a trifle unconvincing, and not overly
comic, but we can attribute this again
to the play. It is very difficult for a
college youth to play an old man, and
this was the weakness of both his
work and that of Guillermo, the serv
ant, played by James de Puy.
In the third act, Janet Harris, as
Dona Barbarita, shared laurels with
Benetta Merner. Miss Harris was a
most refined and unusual Spanish
dowager, and even her voice seemed
softened and mellowed with age and
gentility. Miss Merner not only was
very amusing herself, but was an ex
cellent foil for the Dona.
Cast Excellent
The three brothers were good
enough—Pepe seemed to us the most
attractive. They were well cast to
provide contrast for each other —
Wenig, especially so.
All in all —and it seems to us we
have been repeating this every para
graph—the play was excellently done,
very amusing, and a more than usu
ally polished performance. We feel
Miss Anna May Price, and her cast,
should be congratulated on their work

most refined and unusual Spanish
dowager, and even her voice seemed
softened and mellowed with age and
gentility. Miss Merner not only was
very amusing herself, but was an ex
cellent foil for the Dona.
Cast Excellent
The three brothers were good
enough—Pepe seemed to us the most
attractive. They were well cast to
provide contrast for each other —
Wenig, especially so.
All in all —and it seems to us we
have been repeating this every para
graph—the play was excellently done,
very amusing, and a more than usu
ally polished performance. We feel
Miss Anna May Price, and her cast,
should be congratulated on their work
—particularly in view of the extraor
dinary handicaps they have had to
face in the production of this comedy.
We nearly forgot to mention the
sets, and the work of Les Kiler and
his stage crew. It almost goes with
out saying that they were all right.
The lighting and the rain machine in
the first act were particularly unob
trusive —which is the highest praise
that may be given to stage mechan
ics. Incidentally, Ave enjoyed the mu
sic between acts —so all in all, as we
said before, a good evening was had
by all!
