# CARD HANDBALL MEN TO PLAY MATCH WITH ATHENS CLUB TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford varsity handball men will
meet the Athens Club team of Oak
land on the club's courts tonight at
6 o'clock in its second competitive
match of the year. Mernon Richards,
Dowell Richards, Sam Joseph, Bill
Stein, George Richards, and Bill
Price make up the varsity team. They
will be accompanied by John Sauter,
a freshman player, and Charles
Davis, coach.
The Stanford team is not conceded
much chance of winning from the
clubmen, but playing against such
keen competition should do much to
prepare the Cards for their matches
with California next Saturday. The
first and second ranking players on
the Oakland team are nationally
known as handball players. Last year
they beat the national champion dou
bles team in two out of three matches.
The matches will be played on the
four-walled court of the Athens Club,
which will be disadvantageous for the
Stanford players, who have only one
walled courts to play on here.
