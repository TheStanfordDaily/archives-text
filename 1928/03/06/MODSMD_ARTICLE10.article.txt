# HOLD TRYOUTS FOR ROLES IN ENGLISH PLAY
## Women to Compete Today For Parts in Comedy By Bernard Shaw 
### 
Tryouts for women's roles in
"Caesar and Cleopatra" will be held
in the Assembly Hall beginning at 3
o'clock today. Men will report at the
same hour tomorrow.
The Bernard Shaw play will be
given by the English Club on April
13. There are a large number of
men's parts in it, announces Miss
Anna May Price, dramatic director.
Some of the roles in the comedy are
difficult to act, and for that reason a
large turnout will be required to
choose a suitable cast. Many extras
are needed, also, she stated.
"Caesar and Cleopatra" will be the
first costume play given on the cam
pus since "Princess Ida," the operetta
given last year. Aside from the inter
est added by costuming will be the
usual lines of Shavian satire, wit, and
humor. The Caesar and Cleopatra of
this play are quite different from the
historical characters.
