# STANFORD'S VARSITY NINE PRACTICES FOR FINAL BRONCO GAME
## 
### 
In hope of playing that long-de
layed game with Santa Clara before
the end of the week, Stanford's var
sity baseball team will resume prac
tice this afternoon after a several
days' lay-off because of bad weather.
The game, which was to have been
played Saturday afternoon, may be
played here Thursday or Friday if
Santa Clara is willing.
With the series at stake both the
Cards and the Broncs should play
heads-up ball. Santa Clara took the
first game 6-5, but the Cards retali
ated the following Saturday with a
3-2 win.
Coach Harry Wolter has not se
lected a hurler to start the game
against the Broncs. It is possible that
Gene Kern may be the chucker
chosen to do the tossing for Stan
ford. In the three innings he pitched
against the Santa Clarans in the last
game, he fanned four men and al
lowed but two hits.
Simoni, with Casanova for relief,
will probably do the pitching for
Santa Clara. He acted the part of
"ye friend host" in fine fashion in the
first game, being touched by the visit
ing Cards for numerous hits that re
sulted in four runs in the one inning.
Next Saturday afternoon Stanford
meets St. Mary's on the local diamond
in the third and deciding game of
that series.
