# SENIORS WILL MEET FRESHMEN IN FIRST SERIES CAGE GAME
## 
### 
Senior women's basketball team
will meet the freshmen in the first
official game of the interclass series
on the women's basketball field to
day at 4:15 o'clock. The junior-fresh
man game, which was scheduled to
be played yesterday, was called off
as a result of the rain, but will be
played tomorrow instead.
The senior cagers have already de
feated the first-year team in a previ
ous practice game by a score of 23-2
but as the undefeated junior team
was only able to hold them to a score
of 12-1 indications are not as strong
for a second one-sided victory on the
part of the fourth-year team as they
were before the beginning of the final
series.
The sophomore team, although not
scheduled to play an official game,
will report for practice today, an
nounced Maxine Cushing, captain.
