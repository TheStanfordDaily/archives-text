Tomorrow night at 6:15 o'clock the
women of the University will meet in
an exchange dinner to be held by A.W.S.
in the different living groups' with mem
bers of the classes dining together.
Freshman and sophomore women will
have dinner at Roble, where Mary Edith
Jones and Alice Ingraham have charge
of the two classes. The Junior and Sen
ior Classes have been divided into five
groups each by members of the Social
Committee of A.W.S. The groups dining
in the different houses follow.
As there is no complete list of the
members of the different classes in ex
istence at the University, the possibility
of mistakes in this list is evident. Mem
bers of the Junior or Senior Classes
whose names do not appear in the fol
lowing groups are asked to phone Peggy
Mudgett at Roble.
