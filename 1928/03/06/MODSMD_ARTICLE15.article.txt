# PROMINENT STUDENTS ARE NOMINATED FOR MASQUE BALL "KING"
## 
### 
Late news dispatches from the
Rally Committee Headquarters in
front of the Library state that three
prominent Stanford men will risk
their lives and reputations and stand
for election to the position of Royal
High and Mighty of the coming
Masque Ball which is to be held in
the Pavilion April 6. Nominations will
be closed at noon today.
The first man nominated was Bob
King, versatile man-about-town, who
has chosen as his campaign slogan,
"King for King." Chris Freeman,
celebrated pork-pursuer, will also run
for the coveted office and has se
lected as a war cry, "A Royal Face
for a Royal Place." Charles McAllis
ter completes the first day's list of
nominees and the watchword he has
chosen is "Remember Wing Schmei
der?"
There are no costs attached to nom
inating and with every nomination
1000 votes are given gratis. The Rally
Committee Headquarters will be open
from 8 o'clock until noon today for
this purpose.
Votes may be cast (at a penny
each) tomorrow, Thursday, Friday,
Monday, and Tuesday, at the Rally
Committee Headquarters in front of
the Library.
Tickets are selling at a brisk rate
and will be on sale until 4 o'clock
today in the Old Union at the unusual
price of $2.48. No tickets will be sold
next quarter just preceding the Ball.
The music committee has followed
the moth-eaten custom and last night
dispatched a telegram inviting Ted
Lewis and his cohorts to furnish the
music for the Ball.
