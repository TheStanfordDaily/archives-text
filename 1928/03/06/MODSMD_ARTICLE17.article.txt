I)r. Wilbur returned to the campus
recently after attending the Sixth
Pan-American Conference, held at
Havana, as a delegate. His talk Thurs
day will be concerning the work done
there.
The president is enthusiastic about
the achievements of the Havana con
ference, only a part of which, he says,
have been made known to the public
by the newspapers.
"While the public has learned
through the newspapers of a few of
the questions which have attracted
most attention in the United States,
the close of the conference found the
delegates of the twenty-one nations
in agreement, and signing conclusions
on at least forty projects."
