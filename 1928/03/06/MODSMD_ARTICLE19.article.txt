# CARD FENCING SQUAD ROUNDING INTO FORM FOR CALIFORNIA MEET
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity fencing team will
work out every night this week in
preparation for the annual match
with California Saturday night. The
meet will be held in the main room
of the Encina Gymnasium at S o'clock
The Bears will be represented by
a team of veterans. Stanford, through
graduation, lost the first three men of
her last year's squad and so practi
cally every member of the five is new
at the sport. The men have been
working hard under the able tutelage
of Coach E. A. Bugge and Harry
Maloney and are conceded an even
chance to conquer the Berkeley men.
