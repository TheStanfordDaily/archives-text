# Senate to Investigate Unemployment Conditions
## 
### 
j WASHINGTON, March 5.—( U.P.)
i —Unemployment conditions were
I forced directly to the attention of the
I Administration today when the Sen
j ate, after debate strongly tinged with
J presidential politic s, adopted the
i Wagner Resolution requesting the
i Secretary of Labor to investigate the
extent of unemployment.
This resolution was sponsored by
two senators closely identified with
Governor A1 Smith's presidential cam
paign. Wagner and Copeland, New
York Democrats. It has been the un
derstanding here that unless business
improves by summer, Democrats will
endeavor to convince the country
that the Republican claim to being
the party of prosperity is unfounded.
