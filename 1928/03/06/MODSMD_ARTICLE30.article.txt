Plus what, we do not know. But, anyway, dozens and dozens of
scintillating limbs will be weaving about tonight midst the undulations
of Wagner's "Das Rheingold" as a bevy of Stanford belles wends its
way through the annual Dance Drama. It is rumored that Flo Ziegfeld
will have his scouts running hither and thither looking for new material
to put into his next show.
Certainly the women have been working on the show diligently enough
for a long time. If flitting feet and much application make a Dance
Drama, the one tonight ought to be worth considerably more than the
price of admission.
Oh, yes, we forgot to say that there is no charge for the entertain
ment. Student Body cards are not even required.
