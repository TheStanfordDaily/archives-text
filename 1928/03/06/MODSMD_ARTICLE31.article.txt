# Iss Dis a System?
## 
### 
Decade after decade we hear the continual prating about what's
wrong with the "present" system of education. New plans, new methods,
new curricula are annually and monthly being instituted, all with an idea
to improve the "present system." Some are good, they hold on; others
are bad, and may or may not, hold on. But each one is a SYSTEM.
One college president will cry for strict attendance at classes; another
will say he's all wet, and that what we need is more individual thinking
and less parroting of the professor's lecture. Harvard is- proud of its
"vagabonds" (students so-called because they merely listen-in on lectures
at their will and where they will), Annapolis is proud of its rigidity.
Minnesota has its audit classes, Stanford has its Independent Study; at
least, one can study that way after he has shown he can make good grades
parroting.
Then we have the old discussion about college age. A venerable
President Emeritus says students are not, as a rule, half ready to jump
into the world. They are too young, too inexperienced. Another gentle
man who has won the love and affection of his pupils and then settled
back from active administration tells us that boys and girls should start
college much younger, that they arc loitering and wasting away their
lives just at the age when they should be about and doing.
All of these men and institutions (oh, we might cut off a few per
cent) are infinitely jealous of their own methods. Without such-and-such
particular plan, the young people of the nations will go 011 their way in
just the same old fashion, learning nothing and getting nowhere.
11. G. Wells, in his novel, "Joan and Peter," gives a bachelor, with
an aunt and two sisters or sisters-in-law, the problem of bringing up a
boy and girl in England. He searches and seeks for proper schools. He
can find none. He tries this and he tries that, but at last gives up in
despair. Joan and Peter, however, come through the turmoil and find
themselves, not because of the systems of education, but in spite of them.
The problem is not What, or How, but Who.
Men come and grow. They're educated, they die. What is education ?
What is purity? What is success? What is happiness? They are NOT
systems.

college much younger, that they arc loitering and wasting away their
lives just at the age when they should be about and doing.
All of these men and institutions (oh, we might cut off a few per
cent) are infinitely jealous of their own methods. Without such-and-such
particular plan, the young people of the nations will go 011 their way in
just the same old fashion, learning nothing and getting nowhere.
11. G. Wells, in his novel, "Joan and Peter," gives a bachelor, with
an aunt and two sisters or sisters-in-law, the problem of bringing up a
boy and girl in England. He searches and seeks for proper schools. He
can find none. He tries this and he tries that, but at last gives up in
despair. Joan and Peter, however, come through the turmoil and find
themselves, not because of the systems of education, but in spite of them.
The problem is not What, or How, but Who.
Men come and grow. They're educated, they die. What is education ?
What is purity? What is success? What is happiness? They are NOT
systems.
Decade after decade we hear the continual prating about what's
wrong with the "present" system of education. New plans, new methods,
new curricula are annually and monthly being instituted, all with an idea
to improve the "present system." Some are good, they hold on; others
are bad, and may or may not, hold on. But each one is a SYSTEM.
One college president will cry for strict attendance at classes; another
will say he's all wet, and that what we need is more individual thinking
and less parroting of the professor's lecture. Harvard is- proud of its
"vagabonds" (students so-called because they merely listen-in on lectures
at their will and where they will), Annapolis is proud of its rigidity.
Minnesota has its audit classes, Stanford has its Independent Study; at
least, one can study that way after he has shown he can make good grades
parroting.
Then we have the old discussion about college age. A venerable
President Emeritus says students are not, as a rule, half ready to jump
into the world. They are too young, too inexperienced. Another gentle
man who has won the love and affection of his pupils and then settled
back from active administration tells us that boys and girls should start
college much younger, that they arc loitering and wasting away their
lives just at the age when they should be about and doing.
