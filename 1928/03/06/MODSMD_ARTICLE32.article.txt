From Oberlin College, Ohio, comes the news: "A recommendation to
the general faculty from the jpint faculty-student council of the Women's
League for the repeal of the rule providing that 'men and women do not
walk together for recreation during the Sunday quiet hours' was passed
unanimously early this week."
Just what is coming over this younger generation? Give them an
inch and they'll take a mile. Pretty soon they'll want to hold hands in
public.

Notices and letters keep coming in geometrically increasing numbers
soliciting publicity or students for floating universities, round-the-world
cruises, and whatnot. Some day we're going to develop a big fund and
finance a half-way-around-the-world cruise for all these pests.

The editorial staff of the Daily will meet today at the usual time
and place.
