# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Automobiles may come or go; Stan
ford women may peddle around on
iron steeds; traffic violators may be
fined by the Men's Council, the Sup
reme Court of the United States, or
the Board of Athletic Control; and
the Lower Division may be slightly
pruned or entirely eliminated. Those
are matters beyond your immediate
control other than giving them pub
licity.
But Mr. Editor, you can supply the
baseball fans with box scores of var
sity games. (Perhaps it is asking too
much for the same in regard to the
frosh contests, although many of us
would appreciate it.) Even those who
see the games would like to find out
from a box score how many hits each
player got, which chucker was credit
ed with victory or charged with de
feat, whether a hard-hit ball went as
a hit or was chalked up as an error
against an ambitious infielder, etc.
And when we can't see the games the
box score is even more valuable.
It should not be difficult to find a
reporter who understands baseball
and who can make out a box score.
The service would be appreciated by
many of us.
Yours 'til the last man's out —'25.

The Editor, Sir:
About a year ago the Daily suc
cessfully squelched a severe epidemic
of childishness that hit the Campus
in the form of an overwhelming de
sire of students in the balcony at
University productions to toss paper
aeroplanes down into the audience.
The object of such sport evidently

being to land in the hair of some
woman (land the aeroplane I mean).
A similarly moronish pastime is
getting under way at the local movie
tabernacles on Saturday nights. This
newest of activities consists in throw
ing lighted cigarette butts from the
balcony down to the main floor. Fur
ther interest is added by greeting all
scenes which affect the inhibitions of
college men with ribald jeers and
loud comments of an exceedingly low
nature.
Now it happens, I am told, that the
town morals squad visits the theatre
on Saturday nights to decide what is
good for the minds of college students
and what is not. They base a good
deal of their action on how students
greet various kinds of pictures.
It needs no further explanation to
show that the best parts of many pic
tures in the future will be deleted be
cause of the uncalled-for noise cre
ated by students who are extremely
humorous (in their own estimation).
Yours truly,
"Time and Place for Everything."

The Editor, Sir:
May I criticize the date set for the
Masque Ball? I believe that Monday's
Daily said that the ball was "NON
SECTARIAN," and I also believe that
April 6 is Good Friday.
Doesn't it seem to you that Good
Friday night should NOT be cele
brated in such a way?
If the Ball is held on this night it
cannot be called NON-SECTARIAN.
Do you agree with me?
Sincerely, Kewpie, '31.

scenes which affect the inhibitions of
college men with ribald jeers and
loud comments of an exceedingly low
nature.
Now it happens, I am told, that the
town morals squad visits the theatre
on Saturday nights to decide what is
good for the minds of college students
and what is not. They base a good
deal of their action on how students
greet various kinds of pictures.
It needs no further explanation to
show that the best parts of many pic
tures in the future will be deleted be
cause of the uncalled-for noise cre
ated by students who are extremely
humorous (in their own estimation).

The Editor, Sir:
May I criticize the date set for the
Masque Ball? I believe that Monday's
Daily said that the ball was "NON
SECTARIAN," and I also believe that
April 6 is Good Friday.
Doesn't it seem to you that Good
Friday night should NOT be cele
brated in such a way?
If the Ball is held on this night it
cannot be called NON-SECTARIAN.
Do you agree with me?
Sincerely, Kewpie, '31.
The Editor, Sir:
Automobiles may come or go; Stan
ford women may peddle around on
iron steeds; traffic violators may be
fined by the Men's Council, the Sup
reme Court of the United States, or
the Board of Athletic Control; and
the Lower Division may be slightly
pruned or entirely eliminated. Those
are matters beyond your immediate
control other than giving them pub
licity.
But Mr. Editor, you can supply the
baseball fans with box scores of var
sity games. (Perhaps it is asking too
much for the same in regard to the
frosh contests, although many of us
would appreciate it.) Even those who
see the games would like to find out
from a box score how many hits each
player got, which chucker was credit
ed with victory or charged with de
feat, whether a hard-hit ball went as
a hit or was chalked up as an error
against an ambitious infielder, etc.
And when we can't see the games the
box score is even more valuable.
It should not be difficult to find a
reporter who understands baseball
and who can make out a box score.
The service would be appreciated by
many of us.
Yours 'til the last man's out —'25.

The Editor, Sir:
About a year ago the Daily suc
cessfully squelched a severe epidemic
of childishness that hit the Campus
in the form of an overwhelming de
sire of students in the balcony at
University productions to toss paper
aeroplanes down into the audience.
The object of such sport evidently

being to land in the hair of some
woman (land the aeroplane I mean).
A similarly moronish pastime is
getting under way at the local movie
tabernacles on Saturday nights. This
newest of activities consists in throw
ing lighted cigarette butts from the
balcony down to the main floor. Fur
ther interest is added by greeting all
scenes which affect the inhibitions of
college men with ribald jeers and
loud comments of an exceedingly low
