"Death Comes for the Archbishop.";
By Willa Cather. Alfred Knopf &
Company.
To praise a book by Willa Cather
is like the proverbial coals to New
castle, besides being an enormous
strain on the Thesaurus. This latest
novel of hers was published toward
the last part of the winter, but it has
I
not been until this month that the ,
sales have pushed it up into the list
of best sellers.
That is significant of the book —it
is undeniably of the type that grows
on you. It is replete with passages
of curiously clear atmosphere — a
country of blue skies and hot plains, :
unsoiled by highways, byroads, towns, j
or the smutty air of factories. We
are very curious to know where Miss ;
Cather wrote this. Recently in the
various fields of letters and art there
have been a number of products of
artistic temperaments that have been
exposed to the geographic influence
of Taos, in New Mexico —and they
have all had somewhat the quality of |
this novel.
"Death Comes for the Archbishop" j
is more than a novel with historical ;
setting—it has much of the rare epic •
quality. The life and habits of the old
bishop are as carefully presented as
an etching, and not even the minor
characters of his environment are
neglected by Miss Cather's fine
strokes.

She has always had the spirit of
the pioneer—probably due to the in
fluence of her father, who was one
of the first settlers of the Nebraskan
town which was her birthplace. She
has concealed this trend of hers in
her several books but it flavors every
thing she writes. With "Death Comes
for the Archbishop" she at last comes
forth in her most becoming medium.
We ilo not feel it a very dangerous
statement to prophesy this novel of
hers will outlast her contemporaries
by many years.
