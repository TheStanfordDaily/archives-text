# CARD BOXERS TRAIN FOR BEAR MATCHES AT BERKELEY FRIDAY
## Kenaston May Replace Fain When Stanford Faces California in Ring 
### 
Cardinal boxers are training hard to
overcome their handicap in the possible
loss of Captain Norman Fain when they
enter the ring against California next
Friday night at Berkeley. Fain, who won
the Far Western intercollegiate light
heavyweight championship last year, is
out of shape and may not compete against
the Bears, Coach Maloney says.
California is said to have a more ex
perienced team this season than Stan
ford. The fact that the Berkeley boxers
triumphed over Davis makes them slight
favorites for winning a majority of
matches when the two clash next Friday.
California took five out of seven bouts
from the Aggies, while Stanford won
only three of their seven bouts when they
met the Aggies two weeks ago.
Probable Line-up
The probable line-up of men who will
step into the ring wearing the Cardinal
colors is: heavyweight, Ed Dillon, a
rangy mittman who combines speed and
accuracy with his punches from a 184-
pound frame; light-heavyweight, Captain
Fain, or Jack Kenaston who will don the
gloves in the event that the former is not
in peak of condition ; middleweight, Ho
mer Toberman, who will box his first
varsity bout; welterweight, Dan Frost;
lightweight, John Hrotnadka; feather
weight, Bill Levit; bantamweight, John
Sano.
Myron Schall, a former varsity man, is
assisting Maloney in coaching the team.
Maloney and Schall will miss the as
sistance of Fidel La Barba, retired fly
weight champion of the world, who is
absent from the University this quarter.
