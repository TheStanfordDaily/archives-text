"Great oaks from little acorns grow," |
according to some famous chiropodist i
(perhaps it was John Bunyan), and no
where is that saying better illustrated
I than in the case of Lyn Lary and Jimmy
i Reese, flashy young inficlders of the Oak
land Club of the Pacific Coast League, I
j who were recently purchased by the New]
York Yankees for a sum supposed to be!
around $150,000.
A year ago Lary and Reese were com
paratively unknown little acorns, with
batting averages of .253 and .267 respec-
I tively and the honor of playing on the
club that finished in second place. Now
| Lary and Reese are Great Oaks, sought
after by nearly every major league club ;
i that has money—big money—to spend i
! on promising young players,, and they are
considered the most brilliant keystone
combination that ever pranced about on
j Pacific Coast League diamonds.
Their 1927 records are as follows:
Jimmy Reese, the Jewish second-base
| man, whose real name is Goldsmith, bat
ted .295 in 191 games, making 213 hits I
■and scoring 113 runs. In his 722 times
1 at bat, he made two homers, led the j
league in triples with 17, made 34 doubles,
1.56 sacrifice hits, and stole 18 bases. Lyn- j
j ford Lary, the short stop, batted .293 in
I 195 games, made 224 hits in 765 times at
I bat, scored 124 runs, and stole 12 bases.
■ Lyn accounted for 12 home runs, 12
| triples, 40 doubles, and 45 sacrifice hits.
Col. Jacob Ruppert, owner of the Yan
; kees, wants a championship team for at

least ten years. He feels that his present
keystone combination of Lazzeri and
Koenig is good for at least five years
more, but realizes that ample protection
is needed for the future. The high-priced
pair are to report to New York in the
spring of 1929.

"Great oaks from little acorns grow," |
according to some famous chiropodist i
(perhaps it was John Bunyan), and no
where is that saying better illustrated
I than in the case of Lyn Lary and Jimmy
i Reese, flashy young inficlders of the Oak
land Club of the Pacific Coast League, I
j who were recently purchased by the New]
York Yankees for a sum supposed to be!
around $150,000.
A year ago Lary and Reese were com
paratively unknown little acorns, with
batting averages of .253 and .267 respec-
I tively and the honor of playing on the
club that finished in second place. Now
| Lary and Reese are Great Oaks, sought
after by nearly every major league club ;
i that has money—big money—to spend i
! on promising young players,, and they are
considered the most brilliant keystone
combination that ever pranced about on
j Pacific Coast League diamonds.
Their 1927 records are as follows:
Jimmy Reese, the Jewish second-base
| man, whose real name is Goldsmith, bat
ted .295 in 191 games, making 213 hits I
■and scoring 113 runs. In his 722 times
1 at bat, he made two homers, led the j
league in triples with 17, made 34 doubles,
1.56 sacrifice hits, and stole 18 bases. Lyn- j
j ford Lary, the short stop, batted .293 in
I 195 games, made 224 hits in 765 times at
I bat, scored 124 runs, and stole 12 bases.
■ Lyn accounted for 12 home runs, 12
| triples, 40 doubles, and 45 sacrifice hits.
