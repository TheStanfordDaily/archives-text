# Plan Doom of Palm Drive Ancient Palms Are Uprooted Avenue Dons Fringe of Oaks
## 
### 
Palm Drive is doomed! Planting
along the most beautiful and well
known avenue on the campus is to
be radically changed in the next de
cade or so, and the traditional palm
trees which never fail to thrill the
Eastern visitor will be surplanted by
oaks.
The first half-dozen palm trees
were cut down and replaced by young
oaks last week, says Roy H. Button,
Superintendent of Buildings and
Grounds. A number of oaks planted
behind the palms will grow there un
til they gradually displace the more
tropical tree.
John McLaren, Superintendent of
Golden Gate Park in San Francisco,
has advised against the planting of
palm trees at Stanford for a number
of years. His opinion was that since
the oak, and not the palm, is native
to this country, the former should be
featured on the campus landscape.
Difficulty in keeping the palm trees
alive and healthy has borne out Mc-
Laren's opinion and planting of oaks
resulted."
