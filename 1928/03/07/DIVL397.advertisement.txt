We can't very well say "smart" because that suggests somewhat a superficial here
today-gone-tomorrow quality. Whereas the virtues of Thos. Heath are deep
and permanent; they come from so much personal supervision, hand-work and
everlasting fussing with details. Might we then use the good old English word
"swanky"? We might, but who would know what we were talking about? "Elegant"
"rich" "sightly"—we feel the reproachful gaze of Thos. Heath upon us. We give
it up. All the really fine things in life are that way. You can't describe them!
