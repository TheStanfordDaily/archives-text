ships requires destroyers for their
protection," he explained. "The en
tire fleet requires cruisers for scout
ing so that the whereabouts of the
enemy may be learned. -The move
ment of the fleet requires a train for
the bringing of fuel and other sup
plies to the ships of the fleet. These
ships require protection and this pro

the present naval strengths and their
proposed building programs. Great
