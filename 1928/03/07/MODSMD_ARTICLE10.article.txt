After several weeks of elimination ;
matches, Coach E. A. Bugge an
nounced the ranking five men and!
the alternate of the varsity fencing ;
squad which will meet the California
fencers in the annual Bear-Card con- j
test in Encina Gym Saturday night.
These men are: 1. Herkimer j
Adams; 2. Arthur Scotten; 3. Orray i
Taft; 4. Richard Hull; 5. Fletcher j
Button; alternate, Martin Kilgore.
Adams and Scotten are the only
two experienced foilsmen on the
squad. Adams was a member of the
Olympic Club squad and Scotten par
ticipated in last year's meet with
California.
California has a strong team and ;
will push the Cardinal men to top :
form. Coach Bugge is of the opinion
that the Stanford fencers will have
an even chance of winning if the men j
exhibit the skill that they have been i
showing in the last week of practice.
