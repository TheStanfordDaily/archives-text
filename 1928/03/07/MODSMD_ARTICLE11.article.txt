# SENIOR WOMEN DOWN FRESHMAN CAGE TEAM
## 
### 
Outplaying the freshmen from the
first blow of the whistle, the senior
women's basketball team defeated the
first-year cagers yesterday by the lop
sided score of 33-3 in the first official
game of the interclass series. The
play was marked by the almost im
penetrable defense of the seniors and
fumbles and wild shooting on the part
of the 1931 team.
The seniors started out with a swift
passing attack, and as a result of
speed and first-class teamwork ended
the first quarter 27-0. A change in the
line-up of both teams in the second
half resulted in three tallies for the
freshmen and held the seniors to a
more evenly matched game.
The junior team will meet the
sophomore cagers today at 4:15
o'clock.
