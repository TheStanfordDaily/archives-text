# CHANGE DATE FOR RALLY COMMITTEE MASQUE FESTIVAL
## WILL BE HELD APRIL 7 Eighteen Men Now in Race For Honor of Reigning At Pavilion Ball 
### 
Change of date for the Masque Ball
from Friday, April G, to Saturday,
April 7, was made last night by the
Executive Committee. The royal rev
els may begin in the afternoon now
with the change of date, according to
Bob Fraser, but plans will have to be
made by the Rally Committee.
"Uneasy lies the head that wears a
crown" are Shakespearian words that
have not written themselves in the
hearts of those eighteen men whose
plebian hats are flung into the royal
ring for the coveted position of King
Carnival of the Masque Ball. The
Pavilion for the night will be turned
into an enchanted palace for royal
revelry by Chamberlain Ted Krough,
chairman of the decoration committee.
