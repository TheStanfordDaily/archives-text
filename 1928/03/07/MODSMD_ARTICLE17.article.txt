### 
Volumes of business done by the
country's largest mercantile establish
ments were revealed to members of
the Graduate School of Business by
Joel Kaufman, of the Emporium, in
a lecture, "Financial Aspects of De
partment Store Work," yesterday af
ternoon. Marshall Field's of Chicago
does seventy million dollars of busi
ness yearly; Macy's of New York,
sixty million; the May Company of
Los Angeles, twenty-five million; the
Emporium of San Francisco, twenty
million.
Sales per year should be two and
one-half the cost of the company's
real estate, according to Kauf
man. He presented figures to show
(hat a company should have $380,000
capital to do one million dollars of
business a year. In order to have a
sound business there should be suffi
cient capital to meet financial obliga
tions, to insure a normal growth, and
to meet emergencies, he said.
