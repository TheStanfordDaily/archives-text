# 1931 CINDER SQUAD CONTINUES PRACTICE FOR MEET SATURDAY
## 
### 
Freshman track squad continued
preparation for the Oakland High
School All-Star meet Saturday with
light workouts yesterday. Showings
in the trial meet revealed some prom
ising times in the distance events.
Wright made a good showing in the
880, making the distance in 2 minutes
3 seconds. This is five seconds better
than the time made in the meet Sat
urday. A slow track made impossible
any exceptional times in the dashes.
Burt DeGroot, freshman pole
vaulter, who has been out on a
sprained ankle, was back to practice
for the first time yesterday. There is
a possibility that he will be ready
for competition by Saturday, but noth
ing certain is known.
