# TO PLAY OFF TENNIS TOURNAMENTS TODAY
## 
### 
Most varsity and freshman ranking
tennis matches scheduled for yester
day were cancelled because the courts
were wet, and will be played today.
In the only matches played, Wilson,
seventh ranking freshman player, de
feated Gantner, sixth; and Cook,
nineteenth ranking freshman, won
from Westheimer, eighteenth.
The varsity team will meet the
U.C.L.A. team next Saturday in its
third match of the year. The Card
racqueters showed up very well
against Occidental College in the re
cent matches with them. Alan Her
rington, ranking varsity man, proved
himself to be a worthy successor to
Cranston Holman as number one man
on the Stanford team by defeating
Ben Gorchakoff of Occidental, third
ranking intercollegiate player for
1927.
Varsity and freshman matches lined
up for today are as follows: Herring
ton vs. McElvenny; Wheatley-Thomas
vs. Castellanos-Driscoll at 3:30
o'clock; Doeg-Weesner vs. Gantner-
Forbes at 1 o'clock; and Thomas vs.
Driscoll at 1:30 o'clock.
The first six men on the varsity
and freshman squads are asked by
Coach Harold Davis to report at the
gym at 2:30 o'clock today for Quad
pictures.
