# Who's to Blame?
## 
### 
A recent survey at the University of Kansas, made in an attempt to
discover reasons'for certain courses being" boresome or valueless, brought
out the fact that it is not merely the students who are to blame. Certain
objections were made to the professors, themselves. Among these were:
that the instructor did not know how to get his material over to others,
that he did not organize his subject, that his personality was distasteful,
and that he was too theoretical.
Now, it is quite well recognized that many of the best authorities are
men who cannot lecture; but it is also true, as was recently pointed out
by one of the Bull Session splashers, that there are numbers of men who
have a general scope of a subject, aiTil can present it in such a way as to
get the elements over. In regard to organizing material, it seems that
anyone who sets himself up as a college professor should have learned
to put his subject in order. But this is often not the case. As a lesult,
students listening to his lectures don't know just where he is headed.
He may have a very potent point to bring out, but if he doesn't bring it
out. what good is it?
Professors might do well to look in upon themselves once in a while
when they find that a heavy percentage of their students are flunking or
getting exceedingly low grades. Some are proud of these low giades, but
they should see the marks as a reflection on their own as well as the
students' work. Some teachers would be very much surprised to find
that the members of their classes give them a low grade. The trouble is
that instructors too often fail to apply the same criteria to themselves and
their courses that they apply to the work o fthe pupils.
It might be interesting to see what students think of specific profes
sors and classes. We prophesy that the ones ranking highest would be
the professors who deal with their students as individuals, not as minors
reflecting the words of a lecture back upon a blue book.
