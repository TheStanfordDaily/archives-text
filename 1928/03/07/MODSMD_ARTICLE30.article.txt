We owe an apology to the Women's Athletic Associations of Mills
and California. It seems they do favor interclass intercollegiate compe
tition for women, and are at present assisting to work out a plan for it
in the Mills-California-Stanford conference. The Triangular Council,
composed of four members of eacli college s board, will meet within the
next two weeks to shape a policy for future play days, with an eye to
introducing interclass intercollegiate contests.
The stumbling block has been the objection of a minority, made up
of a few coaches. At the Council meeting there will be not more than one
coach from each college. Ihe Stanford coaches are backing the stu
dents. So are most if not all of the Mills coaches. With this majority
favoring interclass intercollegiate competition, it looks as if it would
not be hard to put the plan through.
There will be no question of varsity competition. It is unanimously
frowned upon by all three colleges. But the women feel that interclass
intercollegiate play can be arranged to take in more than one team from
each class of each college, and also on a tournament basis so that the
three colleges can get together at one time.

All freshman members of the staff will meet in the Daily office at
12 :45 o'clock today.
