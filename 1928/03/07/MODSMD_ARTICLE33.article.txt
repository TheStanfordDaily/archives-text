# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
I have heard that there is a board
of very worthy souls who pass on the
pictures which will he shown in Palo
Alto. It is well that this group should
observe from their ethereal realm
that which will put the toddling feet
of the general public and Stanford
students on the pathway of virtue; it
is well that we are sheltered from
the worldly knowledge which follows
to the primrose path which leads to
perdition. It has been rumored that —
so closely do these "public godpar
ents" guard our tender minds from
taint —"Peter Pan" was not shown
because of the bedroom scene.
Perhaps this close censorship, which
prevents many good pictures from
being shown in Paly, is due to a few
students. These few students are
those who deviate from the "smart
cracks" and light smut into tilth.
Filth, when not seasoned without
even a little weak wit, is disgusting.
No one believes that "a Stanford man
is always a gentleman," but one does
expect him to refrain from using
language which is not tolerated in a
pool hall —at least in a public place
where there are women present. Were
these mental lightweights clever, but
they aren't —they have no defense
there.
Please do not believe that these
smelly remarks offend my aesthetic
soul, but it does irk me that the re
marks of a few tiny-brains, whose
I.Q.'s are as low as their language,
should prevent me from seeing inter
esting pictures. —D.O.C.

The Editor, Sir:
I see by the paper that Palm Drive
will soon be a mile or so of oaks; I
\
have read that some august body has
decided that one of the most com
mented upon, and one of the most
unusual, and one of the most beauti
ful features of Stanford, must go.
These palms have been here since
the beginning of the University; per
haps some of the students and grads
are rather attached to these old trees:
it is probable that many people who
are rather fond of Stanford frame
this in their impressions of the school
—but does it matter? No! Phoo for
sentiments, two phoos for traditions,
the Stanford administration thinks
traditions stupid, and sentiment silly.
Just because many people love these
palms, merely because the Drive is
unique, is that any reason to leave
them? Of course not, John McLaren
thinks "that since the oak, not the
palm, is native of this country, the
former should be featured on the
campus landscape." I hope that Mr.
McLaren does not think that the
chapel should be painted red.
The "Dippy" stated that the palm
trees have been dying. They have
been permitted to die. The only thing
that will stand with no care at all is
a telephone pole.
I am sincerely grateful that John
didn't pick eucalyptus. —L.
P.S.: Is it true that the Board of
Athletic Control is trying to substi
tute billboards for oaks?
