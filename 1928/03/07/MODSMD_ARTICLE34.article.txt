["Sakura," Columbia Theatre—
| Walker Whiteside lias been said to
be bringing Romance back to the
' modern stage. We don't know whether
j or not that is the particular emotion
that makes "Sakura" so different, but
we are satisfied with his discretion.
■ This is one of the few plays of the
j year that may be called "beautiful,"
land still have enough virility to avoid
I being anemic.
There are several reasons why
| "Sakura" is worth seeing. In the first
j place, it is a good play—not in the
! tragic sense, because there is some
| healthy melodrama in it; not in the
j lyric sense, because in spite of ex
j ceptionally poetic lines, the plot's the
; main thing. In the second place, the
| hokum part of the inscrutable Orien
tal is supplanted by an Oriental with
a sense of irony, and some real human
emotions. Also, Onda Sada, played
by Franc Hale (who incidentally, was
a student at Miss Ransom's school,
in Piedmont, not so long ago), is one
of the first Japanese ladies we have
I encountered for a long time that is
i not a drooping Butterfly, or a villain
ess.
Whiteside Popular
Lastly, there is Walker Whiteside.
Prince Hagane is one of his most
popular parts, and that is understand
able. We are at loss whether the
Prince makes the play, or the play
makes the Prince, but our suspicions
are the former.
The second act has been subjected
to a good bit of criticism on the usual
grounds of suggestiveness, and so on.
Not only by the curtain speech Mr.
Whiteside made Saturday night, ex-

I plaining in a most sincere way his
i strict observance of Japanese cere-
I monials, are we convinced that these
; comments are wholly ungrounded. We
'do not know anything of Japanese
; customs, beyond the fact that they
belong to a most ceremonious race,
i and we imagine most of the houses at
j the Columbia are in the same posi
tion. However, the whole spirit and
| atmosphere of the play are foreign to
j unpleasantness, and Whiteside's repu
tation is sufficient to our minds to
remove any doubt about the question.
"Sakura" is scheduled for a short
j run in San Francisco, which seems
j unfortunate, but we recommend it for
| your attention as long as it is here!
