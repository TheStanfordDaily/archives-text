THE MASK BALL
The Kings-to-be,
Look good to me.
But roughs, let me relate,
If Oswald for the job would run—
The rest would abdicate.

"I think I'll nominate him on a
1 police reform platform—something
like this, Kings Keep Kippered Kana
kas from Kleptomaniaism," announc
: ed Archie.
"Unfortunately it doesn't mean
much."
"Well, don't you think all those
, "K's" have a nice swing?"

I Cabbages Column,
The Editor, Sir:
Write a poem about a party of six,
With lots of appeal and fun.
Place the scene near ltoble bridge—
But get 'em home by one!
—Peggy.

i Since that sort of thing is a little
lout of my line, I've had to turn your
J request over to Archie, that man
| about-town of whom you may have
I heard. Archie says this is about a
blind date he had before meeting
Emma:
A GOOD TIME WAS HAD
BY ALL—THE REST
We parked the car
Near a lonely bridge.
Ethel and Joe
Hiked over a ridge.
Mabel and Jack
Went just 'round the bend,
.And me'n my girl
Had fun no end.
We talked of the weather,
But not for long—
We got interested in checkers
That she brought along.

We'll sign off with one of Emma
Fervor's gin-rickey rimes called "The
Heart of a Woman." Read it over
three or four times —and if you get
any rational meaning out of it you're
our Gunga Din.

THE HEART OF A WOMAN
Her heart is a cat lying in your arms,
Soft, quiet, afraid —
' But when you offer to caress her
There is a screech that rends the air.
A glow of green sparks in her eyes,
A clutch of claws, daggers sheathed
in velvet,
The bunching of wire muscles,
! And a quick spring from your arms.
! Your cheek shows a livid wound
! Where the blood mounts into a flush
of pain
| While the cat stands for a moment
incurious,
Watching you and stretching herself,
i Arching her smooth back in cruel
lethargy
j Before she glides away.
One dollar a year is plenty to live
i on, according to Earnest L. Price,
i American Consul from China, who
j spoke before a fraternity at the Uni
j versity of Washington.
