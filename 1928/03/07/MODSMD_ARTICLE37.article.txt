# SPORTS OF 1928
## A 						Socking Welshman 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Here is Frank Moody, a middle
weight with heavyweight title ambi
tions. Frank Moody, in case you don't
know it, is the current middleweight
and cruiserweiglit (light-heavy) cham
pion of England. He was born In
Wales in 1!)02, and in Wales, so they
say, they think more of him than
they do of young Albert Edward
Windsor, alias Lord Renfrewe, the
current Prince of their district.
Moody, at least, doesn't fall off a
horse so often.
Frank Moody has his ups and
downs in the ring, as have many other
good fighters, but it seems he has
been particularly effective against the
big boys. Listed among the heavies
whom he has put to sleep are Pat
McCarthy, Kid Norfolk, George Cook,
and Jack Stanley (to whom he con
ceded forty pounds in weight). Cook,
K.O.'d by Moody, licked Tom Heeney,
while Stanley lost a fifteen-round de
cision to the famous New Zealander.
Frank has bowled over two other
gents who went the distance with
Heeney—Max Gornick and Tom
Barry.
Moody is after the world's record
of one hundred knock-outs, held by
George K. O. Chaney. To date Frank
has turned in eighty-six and expects
to run. off the next fourteen within
two years. He will be in America
again before long, and hopes to show

that the British Isles are not entirely
passe as far as producing good light
ers goes. I also notice from Frank
Moody's record that he knocked out
one Vincent Lopez in four rounds in
192 G. Having heavyweight aspirations,
it is expected that he will soon come
out with a challenge to Paul White
man.
