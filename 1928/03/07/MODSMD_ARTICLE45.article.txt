# MANY "LOST" BOOKS RETURN TO LIBRARY EVENTUALLY-PARKS
## Librarian Blames Men More Than Women; Reclaim Books by Raids 
### 
Although books disappear regularly
from the Universitj Library, most of
the missing books reappear sometime
later, says C. V. Parks, assistant libra
rian. Loss of books is, however, a real
problem.
Men are worse offenders than women,
he finds, although since many off-campus
people use the library it is especially dif
iicult to locate blame. Not infrequently
searches arc made of the fraternity
houses, resulting in quite sizeable hauls,
lvcss often the rounds of sorority houses
and dormitories are made, but the yields
here are smaller. Janitors in dormitories
sometimes turn in books.
Parks believes the relative loss to be
no greater or less now than in the past,
considering the increased size of the li
brary and the larger student body. It
has been some time since an inventory has
been made of the books in the library, so
it is not known just how many are miss
ing. The most considerable loss is from
the reserved book room and the seminar
reading room.
