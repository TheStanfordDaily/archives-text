# MEXICAN UNIVERSITY WILL GIVE SUMMER COURSES IN ENGLISH
## 
### 
National University of Mexico is
announcing its eighth summer school
session from July 2 to August 15.
Courses are planned to meet the
needs of teachers and students of
Spanish, business men, social work
ers, and artists. Some courses are
given in English, such as General Sur
vey of Mexico, Latin-American His
tory and Relations, and Mexican Folk
ways, so that those who do not under
stand Spanish may equip themselves
with sufficient background to make
their stay in Mexico more valuable.
The summer school is housed in the
historical Churrigueresque, House of
the Masks. Every Thursday noon in
its patio are given typical Mexican
folk entertainments. Special week
end excursions are also planned.
