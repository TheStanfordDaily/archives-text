# Dance Drama Pleases Audience By Effective Light, Color Harmony
## 
### H. J. K 
"Das Rheingold," as presented last
night by the dance composition class,
the annual dance drama, was an in
teresting interpretation of an unusu
ally difficult subject. From an esthet
ic standpoint, it was nearly perfect
in color and harmony. The lighting,
coloring, and musical score, were well
worked out. The costuming was ex
cellent.
First Act Exquisite
The first act, with the group move
ments of the Waves, as a background
for the dance of the three Rhine
daughters, was exquisite. The last
act, witli the exceptionally spectacu
lar and beautiful storm dance, and
the grouping of the rainbow bridge,
was really rather magnificent.
On the whole, however, there was
an unfortunately disproportionate
amount of pantomime in relation to
the dancing. The group dances, the
individual dances, and the scarf work
were so excellent when they did oc
cur that their scarcity was a notice
able weakness.
Cast Does Well
Adele Gist, as Albericli, Virginia
Huntington, Helen Ward, Jeanne
Kurtz, as the three Rhine daughters,
Maxine Gushing, Betty Sliively, as the
Giants, Dorothy Kimberlin as Loge,
and Elizabeth Anne Lynch as Donner,
did particularly well.
All in all, it was beautifully done.
The audience, which, by the way, was
a record one, and nearly rivalled that
of the Football Gaieties, was a sig
nificant indication that there is a real
and general interest in the work of
the dancing classes of the University.
