# CRITICS GIVE L.A.A.C. EDGE OVER CARDS IN MEET ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
Critics are still predicting a Stan
ford defeat when the Los Angeles
Athletic Club's great track and field
organization meets the Cards Satur
day, but "Dink" Templeton's charges
seem blandly unconscious of the im
pending disaster, and continue to
work out as if nothing of importance
were coming up.
With names like those of Paddock
and Carter and Maxwell on its roster,
and with a good percentage of the
first places apparently cinched, the
Los Angeles squad does look like a
sure winner.
But there seems to be a pretty
large chance that Stanford's end of
the score may not be as small as is
anticipated in some circles. L.A.A.C.
may he the strongest aggregation in
the West, but the lads from the Farm
form a gang which is certainly not
the weakest.
The Cards are showing plenty of
fire in practice. With Coe loping off
the two-mile event in a little over
9 minutes and 55 seconds, things look
somewhat promising from that angle.
And then there is Harlow Rothert,
newly-elected Redshirt hoop captain,
who is adding to Stanford's power in
the field events by performing along
with the best of Templeton's weight
men after only a week's practice.
