# President Wilbur Talks Tomorrow Before Students
## Acted as Representative on Intellectual Board of Cuban Conference 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur will address
the all-University assembly which is
to be held tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock in the Assembly Hall on the
methods, organization, and results of
the Pan-Americon Conference in
Havana from which he has recently
returned. All classes at 10 o'clock will
be dismissed.
Much that was significant in the
achievements of the conference has
not yet been made public, according
to the president. He was delegate to
the convention, and acted as Ameri
can representative on the Commis
sion on Intellectual Co-operation of
the Conference.
Among the proposals agreed to by
this commission are: the establish
ment of a Pan-American Institute of
Geography and History, with head
quarters to be determined later; a
recommendation that books be given
the widest possible circulation be
tween countries of the American con
tinents; and other measures designed
to increase the information and sym
pathy between the peoples of differ
ent countries, particularly those in
the two Americas.
