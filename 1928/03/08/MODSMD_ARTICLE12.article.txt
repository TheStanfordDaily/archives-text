# ACTIVITIES OF MASQUE BALL WILL FURNISH PICTURE SET
## Stanford Studios to "Shoot" Campus Comedy Scenes in Pavilion During Festivities Doyle Is Leading Candidate In Race for Royal Throne At Rally Committee Fete BULLETIN Morrie Doyle, better known as Shenandoah, with the slogan "Big but King," jumped into the lead for King last night with 1596 votes. 
### Sylva Weaver 
Stanford will be a veritable Holly
wood when April 7, the night of the
Masque Ball rolls around, for the
latest news dispatches from Rally
Committee Headquarters announce
(hat (lie scene of the royal frivolities
will be used by the Stanford Studios,
a campus moving picture organiza
tion for the first of their two-reel
comedies.
Stanford Studios is an amateur mo
tion picture club, organized about
three weeks ago on the campus. The
productions made by Stanford Studios,
including the part filmed at the
Masque Ball, will be shown at Stan
ford in Spring quarter by the Dra
matic Council.
No salaries are paid the actors in
the company of which Ernest W. Page
is the director. Page wrote a scenario
which was used for the first effort of
the campus producers.
The scene taken at the Ball will be
one of merry frivolity and dancing in
which the hero, Powell Carpenter,
(rips along with the lady of his heart
by his side. The heroine is played by
Marion LaFollette, who is an Oakland
girl. The lover's conflict is deepened
by the appearance of the "other man,"
a part which will probably be played
by "Biff" Hoffman. Revelers at the
Ball will add the appropriate atmos
phere to the picture.
A King to rule by the Divine Right
of the Stanford electorate is the cen
ter of the struggle which proves the
old adage, "every little penny helps."
In considering the history of the
suffrage movement, students can only
be appalled by the highly "emanci
pated" suffrage in existence at the
University.
Here at Stanford an ideal situation
exis(s. There are no proper(y qualifi
cations —a man doesn't have to be a
40 s. freeholder, or pay a poor rate, to
vote for the King of the Masque Ball.
The vote is open to all, regardless of
race, color, previous condition, or
even present condition, of servitude.
One vote costs one cent. Open to all.

Tickets for the Ball will be on sale
Friday in the Union for $2.48.
Stanford will be a veritable Holly
wood when April 7, the night of the
Masque Ball rolls around, for the
latest news dispatches from Rally
Committee Headquarters announce
(hat (lie scene of the royal frivolities
will be used by the Stanford Studios,
a campus moving picture organiza
tion for the first of their two-reel
comedies.
Stanford Studios is an amateur mo
tion picture club, organized about
three weeks ago on the campus. The
productions made by Stanford Studios,
including the part filmed at the
Masque Ball, will be shown at Stan
ford in Spring quarter by the Dra
matic Council.
No salaries are paid the actors in
the company of which Ernest W. Page
is the director. Page wrote a scenario
which was used for the first effort of
the campus producers.
The scene taken at the Ball will be
one of merry frivolity and dancing in
which the hero, Powell Carpenter,
(rips along with the lady of his heart
by his side. The heroine is played by
Marion LaFollette, who is an Oakland
girl. The lover's conflict is deepened
by the appearance of the "other man,"
a part which will probably be played
by "Biff" Hoffman. Revelers at the
Ball will add the appropriate atmos
phere to the picture.
A King to rule by the Divine Right
of the Stanford electorate is the cen
ter of the struggle which proves the
old adage, "every little penny helps."
In considering the history of the
suffrage movement, students can only
be appalled by the highly "emanci
pated" suffrage in existence at the
University.
Here at Stanford an ideal situation
exis(s. There are no proper(y qualifi
cations —a man doesn't have to be a
40 s. freeholder, or pay a poor rate, to
vote for the King of the Masque Ball.
The vote is open to all, regardless of
race, color, previous condition, or
even present condition, of servitude.
One vote costs one cent. Open to all.
