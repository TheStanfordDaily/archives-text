## Works in Classical Modern Mode on Program; Ravel, Chopin Numbers Included 
### 
Harold Bauer, widely known con
cert pianist, will give a recital in the
Assembly Hall at 8 o'clock tonight,
presenting a program chosen from
both classical and modern composi
tions. Tickets are available at Cran
dall's for a dollar and a half and one
dollar. Seventy-live cent seats will be
on sale at the box office.
Tours of Europe, as well as his ex
ceptional performances in this coun
try, have established Bauer's fame
widely. He made his debut in the
United States in 1900 with the Bos
ton Symphony Orchestra. He was
born in England, although since 1915
he has been a naturalized citizen of
this country, and his early musical
experience was abroad. Paderewski
was an early sponsor of his, and since
then lie has won for himself the high
est reputation in musical circles as
an artist of exceptional ability.
His program this evening will be
given in three groups, the first of five
numbers, "Suite in A Minor," by Bach,
will be the opening selection, and will
be followed by Couperin's "Les Caril
lons de Cythere," "Arietta in G
minor" by Leonardo Leo, "Sonata in
A major" by Scarlatti, and Johann
Kuhnau's "David and Goliath." This
last is a vigorous interpretation of
the Philistine giant's overpowering by
the Israelite shepherd boy, ending in
a triumphal paean.
"Fantasiestuecke, Opus 12," by
Schumann, will be the single number
in the second group. This composi
tion is developed in eight movements,
among which are the popular
"Warum" and "Grillen."
