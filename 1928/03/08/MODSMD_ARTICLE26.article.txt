Another diatribe from the philippic Mr. Menke is run in todays
Campus Opinion column. It seems that some people cannot understand
that the quorum rule in Men's Council regulations has absolutely nothing
to do with that body when it deals with traffic violations.
Comptroller A. E. Roth advises that if there were not some form
of University control over traffic, the State would necessarily step in.
So it was out of deference to the wishes of the Administration that the
State officials agreed to turn this over to the University. Then, in order
to make it more convenient for students to appear, authority to punish
violators was further delegated by the Administration to Men's Council.
This authority might have been given to John Doe, Richard Roe, or
anyone, to an individual, a group, or a society, whether the person or
body were of the students, faculty, or whatnot. But it was given to Men's
Council because this is a group that continues year in and year out, chang
ing in personnel, but not in essence. The Council does not act by authori
zation of the students or the A.S.S.U. Constitution when it is trying
traffic cases, nor do the minutes go down as such. It meets first for these
â€¢cases, and then opens a second meeting to handle matters delegated by the
A.S.S.U.
How anyone can ask "why or when the quorum was abolished" is
perplexing. No such rule was ever in effect on the cases in question.
As to whether the Council is a judicial or legislative body, it may be
said that primarily it is a judicial body, both as regards its student body
duties and those for the University. However, in the case of its duties
for the University, no rules of procedure were set down; it was given
complete control. It has, then, both judicial and legislative functions, in
this capacity, and can "formulate rules which are NOT forced upon
them."
Mr. Menke's offer of a reward is certainly proof of his sincerity.
However, just what size this reward "in gold" would be, he doesn't state.
It also seems that if the offerer, himself, does not deem the answer to
his letter adequate, he will withhold the gold and merely write another
letter.
The Working Women's Clubhouse, to be built by the Illinois Club
of Chicago, will have, in addition to many other unique features, places
where the young women may entertain their boy friends. These places
will be called "courting nooks," and are planned for each floor of the
building.
Something like this should go over big in the Stanford Library.
