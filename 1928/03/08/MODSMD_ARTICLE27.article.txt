Thoughtlessness on the part of some students has caused consider
able disturbance in local theatres and much unfavorable comment about
Stanford students in general to be widely broadcast.
It is not the individual who is ignorant of the meaning of good taste
and a regard for the other fellow who laughs loudly, claps noisily, and
uses filthy language, but those who have forgotten their responsibility
to others. Presumably full-grown men, they have become childish, re
verting to the attitude of the ten-year-old who delights in making him
self prominent by noise. It is not the privilege of a minority to spoil a
performance for the rest of the audience.
If the discourteous few will realize that they are showing extreme
disloyalty to other Stanford students, they may cease their pretense of
being collegiate, and behave in accordance with their true sense of fitness.
It is true that vaudeville performers travel all over the country and that
"the only impression they have of Stanford is gained from the raucous
comments they hear in the theatre. 1 hat Stanford students as a whole
should gain an undesirable reputation because of the thoughtlessness of
a few is regrettable.
In addition to uncivil conduct in Palo Alto theatres an example of
impoliteness was given at the recent Dance Drama, when several men
made themselves quite obnoxious to the audience. Snapping of fingers in
imitation of the dancers on the stage brought forth disapproval of
members of the audience who were forced to hiss the disturbers into
silence. The beauty and continuity of the dance was destroyed for the
onlookers and the dancers were confused.
