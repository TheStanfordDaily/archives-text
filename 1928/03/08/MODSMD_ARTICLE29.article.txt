PHANTOMS OF THE NEXT YEAR
One whole decade has passed since
the World War, and now we look for
the angel of peace and the gentle
olive branch. We can't find them. Ten
years seem but a day, and the cry,
"The War to End War," echoes hol
lowly in our ears. Who today would
go forth to laugh at death just "to
make the world safe for democracy"?
It is sad in a way to think that so
many thousands should have died be
lieving their sacrifice, their one poor
life-offering, would help to end war
and make the world "safe for demo
cracy." It is sadder still that the
world has failed so miserably in the
execution of its trust.
That the world has failed, we think
has been apparent from the first false
notes at Paris in 1919. Today, in 1928,
the phantom of another war is very
real, treaties, conferences, agree
ments, and limitations notwithstand
ing.
SCIENCE AND WAR
It seems remarkable that the na
tions are so little able to advance
their social relations in the midst of
such brilliant advancement in science
and learning. But nations are no more
than reflections of the people—and
almost any second-rate prize fight at
five dollars a head will outdraw the
most significant scientific lecture.
We wonder just what is the general
attitude on war. In this country the
almost hysterical "There can't be
another war, hut you can't tell." This
is reflected in the government, and
today our "policy" on war and peace
reminds one of a man dancing on a
hot floor. One day there is a sugges
tion for a peace conference and the
next day a bottle on a silken cord
swings, breaks, and a forty-five mil
lion dollar airplane carrier moves
smartly down the ways. Or perhaps
these are both done on the -same day.
MUST KEEP ARMS
As much as we may rue the millions

and millions which are poured into j
these implements so pitifully useless j
except in killing, we can't criticize J
those who authorize them. When
everybody carries a blackjack in his
pocket, he who would survive must
1 likewise carry a blackjack. As long
as the nations are fully armed for
war we can't see a chance for real
peace. Right now nobody dares dis
| arm, nor even call the bluff and lead
the way to disarmament. A full
fledged war could quite possibly
; spring up in two months.
If war does come it promises to
'be more terrible than ever before,
j General E. D. Swiuton, inventor of
j the tank, in a recent address at Ox
| ford, England, held that the war of
the future would not be between army
and army but "people and people."
IHe foresaw the sowing of disease
; germs in cities, the employment of
airplanes without aviators to spread
pestilence, the use of chemicals to
destroy lives and crops. Treaties out
lawing these things, he thinks, will
i be "so many scraps of paper." A re
view of the ferocity of the last war
makes us think that General Swinton
' isn't overpainting the picture.
PEACE—A POSITIVE IDEA
About the only way out is to spare
no ends to build up a positive insist
ence that war and armaments must
be outlawed at once and forever. The
emphasis should fall on the necessity
for immediate action —something to
combat this present drifting along in
armed peace. In this interest there
should be an international education,
carried on with absolute sincerity and
designed to reach all the peoples of
the world.
If this fails and war does come, the
writer, for one, intends heading for
the South Seas, and there, with some
control over how and when he will
! die, reverse Sherman nearer to the
heart's desire by saying, instead of
"War is hell," "To hell with war."
