The Editor, Sir:
Do you think that by means of a
surgical operation, any rudimentary
ideas of good manners could be in
jected into the heads of the Stanford
roughs? At any rate, it would be
worth trying. Even if only a few suc
cumbed, the operation could be re
garded as successful.
The beautiful interpretive dancing
at the Assembly Hall on Tuesday
evening was beyond the comprehen
sion of these gentry. They had doubt
less never heard of the old legend of
the Rheingold, or of the Wagnerian
Opera of that name. So their inferior
ity complex, and their small-town
manners manifested themselves in
laughter, and noises which greatly
interfered with the enjoyment of the
more appreciative members of the
audience.
These youngsters are not only un
educated, but they are in all proba
bility uneducable. May they soon
flunk out, and return to the crude
communities which produced them!

The Editor, Sir:
I don't know whether the good name
of Stanford is still thought to be of any
importance by our "sophisticated" stu
dent body—probably not, but it is of very
definite personal importance to every one
of us; if we go out in the world as Stan
ford men we arc judged by the name of
our school. And the name of Stanford
has been suffering to an unbelievable de
gree lately, mainly because of the way a
few of the students act at our theatres./
God knows the vaudeville they give us |
isn't worthy of great applause, and even j
mild demonstrations of disapproval arc
excusable; but when frankly obscene lan
guage is used it is carrying things alto
gether too far. There has been a great
deal of it this quarter.
The vaudeville performers travel all ;
over the country, and there is nothing they {
like better than airing their views of
various audiences. The only impression
they have of Stanford is gained from the
raucous and broad comments they hear
in the theatre—you can imagine what they
say about us. The offenders seem to
think that they arc being merely youthful
and collegiate, but this is the only place
in the country that collegc students de
scend to obscenity.
I am not objecting to pure noise—it is
certainly ungentlcmanly enough, but is

usually expected in a college town —the
thing that must be stopped is the lan
guage used, language that none of the
students would think of using in any
other sort of mixed company. Our status
as gentlemen isn't any too well founded
anyway, and a thing like this is enough
to push it completely over the edge.

Do you think that by means of a
surgical operation, any rudimentary
ideas of good manners could be in
jected into the heads of the Stanford
roughs? At any rate, it would be
worth trying. Even if only a few suc
cumbed, the operation could be re
garded as successful.
The beautiful interpretive dancing
at the Assembly Hall on Tuesday
evening was beyond the comprehen
sion of these gentry. They had doubt
less never heard of the old legend of
the Rheingold, or of the Wagnerian
Opera of that name. So their inferior
ity complex, and their small-town
manners manifested themselves in
laughter, and noises which greatly
interfered with the enjoyment of the
more appreciative members of the
audience.
These youngsters are not only un
educated, but they are in all proba
bility uneducable. May they soon
flunk out, and return to the crude
communities which produced them!

The Editor, Sir:
I don't know whether the good name
of Stanford is still thought to be of any
importance by our "sophisticated" stu
dent body—probably not, but it is of very
definite personal importance to every one
of us; if we go out in the world as Stan
ford men we arc judged by the name of
our school. And the name of Stanford
has been suffering to an unbelievable de
gree lately, mainly because of the way a
few of the students act at our theatres./
God knows the vaudeville they give us |
isn't worthy of great applause, and even j
mild demonstrations of disapproval arc
excusable; but when frankly obscene lan
guage is used it is carrying things alto
gether too far. There has been a great
deal of it this quarter.
The vaudeville performers travel all ;
over the country, and there is nothing they {
like better than airing their views of
various audiences. The only impression
they have of Stanford is gained from the
raucous and broad comments they hear
in the theatre—you can imagine what they
say about us. The offenders seem to
think that they arc being merely youthful
and collegiate, but this is the only place
in the country that collegc students de
scend to obscenity.
I am not objecting to pure noise—it is
certainly ungentlcmanly enough, but is

usually expected in a college town —the
thing that must be stopped is the lan
guage used, language that none of the
students would think of using in any
other sort of mixed company. Our status
as gentlemen isn't any too well founded
anyway, and a thing like this is enough
to push it completely over the edge.
