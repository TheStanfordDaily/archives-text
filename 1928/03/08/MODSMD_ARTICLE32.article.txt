## Strenuous Workouts Precede Cinder Clash; Hec Dyer, Shove May Star in Dashes 
### 
Frosh track men received a hard
â– workout yesterday in preparation for
their second competitive meet of the
year against the All-Star team of the
Oakland High Schools Saturday morn
ing.
Hec Dyer and Maynor Shove, who
are running the dashes, will find
plenty of competition from the oppo
sition, according to a report from the
liny City. With a dry field they should
both turn in good times in the hun
dred, furlong, and 440-yard dash. After
the practice meets they should be
able to win the mile.
Ray Dawson has been improving in
the shot-put throughout the week. Al
though he will be at a disadvantage
with the 12-pound shot to be used
Saturday, he is expected to win first.
Tom Pike will also show up favorably
against the high school competition.
In the discus McLeod has been doing
exceptionally well and is a potential
winner.
Burt DeGroot, star pole-vaulter,
was on the track yesterday again at
tempting to strengthen his ankle
enough for the meet Saturday. It is
doubtful whether he will be able to
compete. A1 McDermott has been
showing fine form in the broad jump
and has been Improving daily. He is
also a regular in the dashes.
Austin and Smith have made good
times in the hurdles during the week
and are looked to for wins in their
events. They took second in last Sat
urday's meet right behind Pogolotti,
Modesto hurdle star. A team com
posed of Neikirk, Crisler, Wright, and
Shove will run the relay for the year
lings.
