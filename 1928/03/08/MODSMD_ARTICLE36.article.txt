# SPORTS OF 1928

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Tristram Speaker, of the Texas
Speakers, will be watched with much
interest this spring as he cavorts
around the outfield for the Philadel
phia Athletics. The "Silver Fox" or
the "Gray Eagle," whichever mon
icker you prefer, will attempt to
broadcast to the world, in true loud
speaker fashion, that he is not
through yet, and that, though a bit
gray on the bean and a bit slow in
the legs, he is still far from slow in
the bean or dim in the eyes, and that
the once great outfielder of the cham
pion Red Sox of 1912 and 1915 is still
an asset to any team, especially the
Philadelphia Athletics.
Away back on April 4, 1888, the
stork left a baby boy at the Speaker
home in Hubbard, Texas. Observing
that he was left-handed, his parents
decided that little could be done to
make him a President, a college pro
fessor, or cartoonist, so they decided
there was nothing for him to do but
go into professional baseball. "It will
be 0.K., Maw," quoth Pa Speaker,
"so long as he isn't a southpaw
pitcher." The lad did take a fling at
this unholy way of earning a living
in spite of all his parents could do,
but soon saw the error of his ways
and turned to the outfield, playing in
seven games with the Boston Red Sox
in 1907. He came back for thirty-one
games in 1908, and became a regular
the following year.

Besides being one of the greatest
of all outfielders, Sir Tristram in
dulges on the side in such mild pas
: times as golf, hunting, fishing, cow
| punching, and amateur magic and
I photography. Among his records 011
| the diamond are those of making
1 eleven hits in succession (July 8, 9,
j 10, 1920), and of making 770 two
; baggers in his lifetime, more than any
| other player.


His Bat Still Speaks
