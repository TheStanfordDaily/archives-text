# CHINA INDIFFERENT TO EXPLOITATION CLAIMS JAPANESE PROFESSOR
## 
### 
"Foreign exploitation of China
moets no opposition with the mass of
the Chinese people," declared Yamato
Ichihashi, professor of Japanese His
tory last night when speaking before
the Euphronia Debating Society.
"Thousands of coolies are supported
by outside enterprises. Nearly a mil
lion Chinese have emigrated into
.Japanese controlled Southern Man
churia."
Professor Ichihashi is of the opin
ion that a united China is still far
distant. "Democracy and republican
ideas can mean nothing to a popula
tion that is 97 per cent illiterate as
China is today." Ichihashi charged the
so-called Chinese leaders for placing
personal gain before the good of the
whole nation.
