# MODERN WORLD OWES DEBT OF EVIL TO OLD ROME, SAYS ANDERSON
## 
### 
"We are not usually told of the
bad things we owe to Rome," said
Professor Frederick Anderson in
speaking before the Classical Litera
ture Society on "The Legacy of
Rome," last evening. "Much of our
theory in literature is merely propa
ganda."
Professor Anderson pointed out that
the gross inadequacies of history are
present because of the fact that writ
ten records are usually left only in
cities, that whole civilizations disap- j
pear with few remaining traces, and :
that historians are often "dreadful
liars."
The great inheritance from Rome
is the language, stated Anderson. We
hardly appreciate the fact that half
of Europe speaks related languages.
Latin is a cultivated language, admir
able in comparison with the rest, for
much work was done in its composi
tion.
Roman law is often spoken of as
the "great gift of Rome," but the law
was very remote from the actual life
of the people. It was studied by schol
ars in the renaissance of the twelfth
century, but it was not until the four-1
teentli century that Roman Code was
adapted to European society. The rea- j
son that Roman law was imparted
successfully to western needs was be-j
cause it was seen to be useful in de
veloping nationalism. This centraliz- j
ing of duties, taking them away from 1
the local communities, was one of the j
evil influences of the Roman system, j
The best elements in the code, thinks !
Anderson, those of natural rights,'
were not Roman in their origin. The J
idea of natural rights laid the basis
for future democratic revolutions.
In concluding, Anderson commented
I on the fact that Rome gave us not
I precisely an inheritance, but pro
j vided rather an arsenal, stored with :
' words, laws, and customs, upon which i
later civilization drew according to
its needs.
