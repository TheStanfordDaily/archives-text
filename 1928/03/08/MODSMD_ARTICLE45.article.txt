# MEMBERSHIP IN CHOIR OPEN TO MEN, WOMEN DURING NEXT QUARTER
## 
### 
All students who would like to
register for the University Choir for
the spring quarter are asked by War
ren D. Allen to attend the final re
hearsals for this quarter, in order
that they may become familiar with
the special music to be sung for Good
Friday and Easter. As Holy Week
falls during the first week of the new
term, much of the preparation must
be made at this time.
All sopranos and altos will meet at
Memorial Church this evening at
7:15 o'clock, and the Women's Choir
will sing the anthem next Sunday
morning. All tenors and basses meet
in the Memorial Church next Monday
afternoon at 4:45 o'clock, and the
Male Choir will sing the anthem on
Sunday, March 18.
A full rehearsal for all singers will
be held with orchestra on Thursday
evening, March 15. The men will re
port at 7:30 and the women at 8
o'clock, and at this time three of the
choirs of Palo Alto will join with the
Stanford singers in preparation for a
joint musical service to be given on
Good Friday afternoon, April 6. Du
bois' oratorio, "The Seven Last Words
of Christ," will be sung by the com
bined choirs of Stanford and the
choirs of All Saints, Congregational,
and Presbyterian churches.
