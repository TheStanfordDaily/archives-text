# SOPHOMORE FIVE WINS CONTEST FROM JUNIOR WOMEN IN CLOSE TILT
## 
### 
Reversing the score of their last
encounter and giving every indica
tion of being the future championship
holders, the sophomore women's bas
ketball team defeated the junior
cagers by a score of 7-5 yesterday in
one of the fastest and closest games
of the entire interclass series. Kathe
rine Sobey scored five of the winning
points for the sophomores and Juanita
White, junior forward, was responsi
ble for the total five tallies of the -1929
team.
The game was hard-fought, from
beginning to end, and showed decided
improvement for the sophomores who
went down to a 12-1 defeat at the
hands of the junior cagers last week.
Maxine Cushing and Jessie Fleming
at the guard positions, figured in prac
tically every play and by their con
sistently good defense kept the junior
forwards from extensive scoring.
Sally Eells sophomore side-center,
starred at the pivot position.
