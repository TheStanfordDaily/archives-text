# WILBUR GIVES SUMMARY OF HAVANA MEET
## President Outlines Policies Of Delegates From United States PRAISES HUGHES' WORK America Hopes to See Latin Republics Sovereign, Strong Nations 
### 
"What the country wants is a
strong South and Central America.
Our policy is to build up, not to ex
ploit. If we can have a general spirit
of confidence among the American na
tions there is every reason why we
can eliminate suspicion and through
intellectual co-operation develop more
than in any other way."
In this manner Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur outlined the policy motivating the
United States in the Pan-American
Conference at Havana in his assem
bly address yesterday morning. He
discussed significant achievements of
the Conference, sketching to some ex
tent its methods of organization and
procedure.
"There - is a spirit-of-the-Americas
running through the relations of these
countries," said Dr. Wilbur. "Our
newspapers had an idea the other
American nations would regard us as
a unit against them, the 'Colossus of
the North'." Dr. Wilbur claimed this
was dispelled, and spoke of the prog
ress of the Conference as very
smooth.
He applied "The danger of slogans"
to the treatment of the intervention
question at the Conference. "No na
tion shall interfere in the private af
fairs of another nation" was the one
which had been advanced. "We can
not agree 'not to intervene' because
we would tie our hands while the
hands of Europe are free. European
countries have no policy of protection
like ours. It would be much simpler
to let them alone, but we have a defi
nite responsibility."
It is the United States' hope to see
these countries sovereign and free, j
strong enough to handle their own j
difficulties, he says, particularly in
the case of Mexico.
Particular problems facing the con
ference were the re-organization of
the Pan-American Union, the codifica
tion of public and private internation-1
al law, problems of communication, of
economics, social problems, intellec
tual co-operation, and others.

I The personal element entered into i
the workings of the Conference to a
I considerable extent, Dr. Wilbur re
ports. Oftentimes in private conversa
tions among delegates agreements,
were reached on the manner in which '
j to deal with certain problems. "The ■
basis for success in this sort of con
ference is for the delegates to know
j and understand each other."
Dr. Wilbur gave tribute to Secre-1
I tary Hughes as ably fitted by his ex-j
| and knowledge of American j
I policy and history to head the U.S.
! delegation. "He illustrates the type l
of American of which all should be !
proud. He gave a fine example of
American patriotism."

"What the country wants is a
strong South and Central America.
Our policy is to build up, not to ex
ploit. If we can have a general spirit
of confidence among the American na
tions there is every reason why we
can eliminate suspicion and through
intellectual co-operation develop more
than in any other way."
In this manner Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur outlined the policy motivating the
United States in the Pan-American
Conference at Havana in his assem
bly address yesterday morning. He
discussed significant achievements of
the Conference, sketching to some ex
tent its methods of organization and
procedure.
"There - is a spirit-of-the-Americas
running through the relations of these
countries," said Dr. Wilbur. "Our
newspapers had an idea the other
American nations would regard us as
a unit against them, the 'Colossus of
the North'." Dr. Wilbur claimed this
was dispelled, and spoke of the prog
ress of the Conference as very
smooth.
He applied "The danger of slogans"
to the treatment of the intervention
question at the Conference. "No na
tion shall interfere in the private af
fairs of another nation" was the one
which had been advanced. "We can
not agree 'not to intervene' because
we would tie our hands while the
hands of Europe are free. European
countries have no policy of protection
like ours. It would be much simpler
to let them alone, but we have a defi
nite responsibility."
It is the United States' hope to see
these countries sovereign and free, j
strong enough to handle their own j
difficulties, he says, particularly in
the case of Mexico.
Particular problems facing the con
ference were the re-organization of
the Pan-American Union, the codifica
tion of public and private internation-1
al law, problems of communication, of
economics, social problems, intellec
tual co-operation, and others.

I The personal element entered into i
the workings of the Conference to a
I considerable extent, Dr. Wilbur re
ports. Oftentimes in private conversa
tions among delegates agreements,
were reached on the manner in which '
j to deal with certain problems. "The ■
basis for success in this sort of con
ference is for the delegates to know
j and understand each other."
