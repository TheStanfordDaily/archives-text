# HIGHLY TOUTED FROSH NINE TIED BY SENIORS IN INTERCLASS GAME
## 
### 
Playing an even game throughout the
entire contest, the senior interclass base
ball men tied the highly touted freshman
nine with a score of 2-2 last night. The
game was prevented from going into
extra innings because of darkness.
Hedge and Hunkcn did the scoring for
the yearlings, while Reynolds and Flick
inger supplied the senior tallies. Rey
nolds pitched a fine game for the upper
classmen, as did Don Story for the first
three innings for the babes. Tickner
substituted for Story in the fourth period,
and was quickly replaced by Gillette, who
in turn was replaced by Ricklefs.
The sophomore and junior inter
class baseball nines will play this
afternoon at 4 o'clock on the inter
class field. Each team has lost, one
game and won none. The freshmen
defeated the sophomores 3-2, and the
juniors were beaten by the seniors 4-1.
