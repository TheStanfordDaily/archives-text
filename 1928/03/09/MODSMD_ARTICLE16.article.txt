# Harold Bauer Concert Enchants Audience By Lyrical Beauty, Color
## 
### 
Harold Bauer played last night not
j only to his delighted audience, hut
j very evidently for his own enjoyment.
His mastery of his art did not need
the embellishment of pyrotechnics:
| he played easily, brilliantly, his pro-
I gram growing in interest through its
j sue cessive numbers, and climaxing
; fittingly in two popular encores from
j Brahms and Chopin.
j His audience was enthusiastic from
i the first. One group, Schumann's
I "Fantasiestuecke," was particularly
j appreciated, as Bauer interpreted the
i wide ranges of mood in this suite with
| equal facility. In the main this group
was distinguished from the first by
j beautifully sustained lyrical quality
and strong contrasts. The brilliant
"Aufschwung" is well compared with
the wistful, tranquil of "Warum"
which follows it in this group.
; The sheer musical appeal of Cho
pin's "Barcarolle" made one almost
forget Hie technical excellence of its
j rendition. Bauer put into this all the
haunting, yet satisfying beauty which
is Chopin. "Etude, by the same
; composer, which Bauer gave as an
encore, was extremely delicate, af
| fording in the staccato passages evi
; dence of the artist's excellent touch
j control.
Of the first group, chosen from
composers of the latter part of the
17th century, Johann Kahnau's im
pressionistic interpretation of the
i storied conflict between David and
Goliath was the most striking num
ber. In the more spectacular parts of
I this, Bauer's unusual ability with the
left hand was accentuated.
Jjtauer was generous with his en
cores, playing one after each group in
i response to the sincere applause.
Barbarini's "Minuet," Schumann's
"Arabesque," were given after the
first and second groups. After a
: Brahms "Valse," his encore after the
last group, he returned when the audi
j ence, though still applauding, was
leaving Ihe hall. Perhaps he, like
| other artists, has become accustomed
j to playing the final encore to a stand
! ing audience. This one was, however,
: enthusiastically appreciative of the
artistry and rare musical sympathy
of Harold Bauer.

Harold Bauer played last night not
j only to his delighted audience, hut
j very evidently for his own enjoyment.
His mastery of his art did not need
the embellishment of pyrotechnics:
| he played easily, brilliantly, his pro-
I gram growing in interest through its
j sue cessive numbers, and climaxing
; fittingly in two popular encores from
j Brahms and Chopin.
j His audience was enthusiastic from
i the first. One group, Schumann's
I "Fantasiestuecke," was particularly
j appreciated, as Bauer interpreted the
i wide ranges of mood in this suite with
| equal facility. In the main this group
was distinguished from the first by
j beautifully sustained lyrical quality
and strong contrasts. The brilliant
"Aufschwung" is well compared with
the wistful, tranquil of "Warum"
which follows it in this group.
