### 
LOS ANGELES. March B.—(U.P.)
—With only the concluding argument
of the State and the instructions of
the court remaining, the case of Wil
liam Edward Hickman and Welby
Hunt, boy bandits charged with the
murder of Ivy Toms, probably will
reach the jury not later than noon to
morrow. Final defense arguments
were finished late today.
