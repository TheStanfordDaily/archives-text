# SURVIVING RUNNERS OF PYLE DERBY IN DESERT

EN ROUTE WITH PYLE CARA
VAX, Mojave Desert, Mar. 8. — (U.P.)
-—With a casual horned toad or lizard as
the only spectators, the remainder of the
entrants in C. C. Pyle's Los Angeles to
New York race were plugging over the
desert to Mojave Wells late today.
Leading the pack through the cactus
lined and sandy roads was Arthur New
ton, of England, formerly a noted dis
tance runner in South Africa.
He held to a tireless shuffle which kept
him slightly in the van of the other sur
vivors of the flat lands, mountain passes,
and deserts.
It was a gait that promised to take him
into Mojave Wells first and which threat
ened to leave other racers far in the rear.
