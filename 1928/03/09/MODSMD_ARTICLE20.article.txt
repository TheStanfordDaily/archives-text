## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March S.—(U.P.) I
—Secretary of Commerce Herbert I
Hoover has authorized the filing of ,
his name in Indiana as a Republican ;
presidential candidate.
He will challenge the favorite son, j
Senator James E. Watson of Indiana, J
for the control of the delegation to j
the Republican National Convention
in the state primaries to be held
May 8.
Secretary Hoover made no direct i
statement but a close friend was au
thorized to say that permission to file !
had been given to Hoover leaders in '
Indiana who have been pressing for 1
weeks to get the Secretary to go into i
the fight against Watson.
Hoover's decision was made public j
just a few hours before the time for .
filing in Indiana expired. Reports,
furnished by the Hoover workers in
Indiana were so optimistic that the ■
Secretary was persuaded to file de-!
spite his reluctance to antagonize j
favorite sons.
Just how Hoover, being the candi-;
date with the greatest visible dele
gate strength, is the target of an:
encircling movement of opponents,
bent 011 stopping him at the Kansas j
City convention, by means of adding
to the. initial strength of Lowden as
many favorite son delegations as can
be mustered, is well known.
Former Governor Goodrich, the
man who has been active in bringing j
Hoover into the race against Watson ;
has long been a bitter enemy of Wat- j
son. He prevented Watson from get- j
ting the backing of Indiana for Presi
dent in 1920. He was associated with
Hoover in relief work in Russia and
is wealthy:
The recent scandals involving state
officials in Indiana may figure in the
campaign since some of them are re
garded as part of the Watson or
ganization.
