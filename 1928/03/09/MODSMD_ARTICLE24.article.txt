# TEMPLETON'S TRACK SQUAD WILL BATTLE WITH L.A.A.C. ON LOCAL OVAL TOMORROW
## Paddock, Maxwell, Smiths Will Be Big Factors For Mercuries EXPERIENCE IS FACTOR Prospects For Cardinal Win Against Southerners Held Doubtful 
### 
Stanford's 1928 track and field ag
gregation will make its initial bow of
! the sea.'jon tomorrow with doubtful
prospects of success when the Los
i Angeles Athletic Club speedsters
: meet the Cards in the stadium.
Templeton's charges, a great col
! lege team from all indications, will

have to fight
against the odds
of age and experi
ence. Age and ex
perience may not
he in themselves
enough to make a
successful team,
but when they are
linked with real
power and ability
the result is dan
gerous.
Men like Pad
dock and Maxwell
and the Smith

brothers have the goods to present
along with their age, and they aren't
the only ones on the Mercury roster
who loom large and dark in the hori
zon Saturday.
The Cards will present a strong
front at any rate, and may not lag
as far behind the Southerners as some
critics suppose. No track meet this
early in the season can be called a
set-up for either faction until it is
finished. Good condition and newly
found talent have been known to ac
complish the unexpected.
