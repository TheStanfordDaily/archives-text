NEW YORK, March B—(U.P.) —>
The New York Sun said today that a
"premature story in tiie London Daily
Express" spoiled an attempt by Cap
tain Walter Hinchliffe and the Hon.
Elsie Mackay, daughter of Lord Inch
cape, British shipowner, to achieve
the first big flying sensation of the
year.
The Sun said it received its infor
mation from Hinchliffe's American
representative, John Gillespie.
The story quoted Gillespie as say
ing Miss Mackay wanted to be the
first woman to fly across the Atlantic
but her family would not consent to
let her risk it.
"Instead of abandoning the idea
she arranged with Captain Ilinchliffe
to make the attempt anyway, but told
her parents she was planning to fly
to India," the story continues. "Their
intention, according to Gillespie, was
to take off ostensibly for India and
as soon as they were in the air to
turn the nose of their Stinson-De
troiter westward instead of south
east."
The Sun said Ilinchliffe had been
in secret communication with Gilles
pie for two months and has also been
getting, secretly, weather reports
from ships at sea.
