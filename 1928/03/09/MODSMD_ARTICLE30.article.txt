# Palm Drive

### 
There seems to be a misunderstanding as to the Administration's
policy of improving Palm Drive. It lias been thought that the stately
palm trees now lining the avenue were to be removed and oaks set in their
place. This is an erroneous conception. Rather, what will be done, ac
cording to Comptroller Roth, is to place varying sizes of shrubs around
the palms, thus filling the barren parkways between the sidewalks and
the Drive. Later oak trees will be planted on the arboretum side of the
walks.
The misunderstanding may be attributed to the fact that at times
several palms have been removed. But these were fan palms which,
investigation and experiment have shown, do not thrive here. These
hav been replacd by the Phoenix, with which there has been more success.
Far from throwing over a tradition or desecrating Palm Drive, this
new plan should be the best move the University has ever taken toward
enhancing the beauty of the campus.
