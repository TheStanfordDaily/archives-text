Dr. Glenn Frank, of Wisconsin, and Mrs. Bertrand Russell, of many
points, have been having one glorious time slinging mud at each other
over the recent refusal of the University of Wisconsin to allow Mrs.
Russell to say her little piece about freedom of expression and all that.
Madame R calls the Doctor "a descendant from the ascetics of the
Middle Ages" and many worse things, and the Doctor says that Madame
R isâ€”well, he Avas very diplomatic about it.
It is to laugh. Both of them are worrying about the morals and
welfare of the students. One thinks the young should not be told all,
the other thinks they should. Well, if they'd go to a good, aid-fashioned
bull-session one day, they might both find that what one had to say, and
the other to suppress, wouldn't have made very much difference anyway.
