# Poor Little Piggy!

Following is a communication to the Portland Oregonian, dated
March 5:
(To the Editor.) â€”I have been astonished to read lately in your
columns that Stanford University students make an annual prac
tice of chasing a greased pig. I had supposed that this senseless
cruelty, indulged in by rustics at Fourth of July celebrations, had
gone out of style at least fifty years ago.
As a child, knowing of the one such event occurring in my
pioneer environment, I remember my father's indignation as he
told of the pig's terror, its pursuit, its pain and exhaustion, kicked
and thrust at, a bloody, wretched thing that they finally fell upon
and claimed. He made many caustic comments, not only on the
heartlessness of the pursuers but on their imbecility in featuring
such a "sport." Where was the intelligence, the sportsmanship,
the use or decency of such an act? What was the necessity of
pitting their brains against the intelligence of a pig, their strength
against his, and with the enforced handicap of undue fat, a re
stricted escape, and the howls of a frenzied mob, attacking from
all points?
1 supposed such a bestial exhibition was outlawed everywhere
long ago. It is a disgrace for any university to permit such a
thing. If those brainless boys cannot find anything better to do,
or to amuse themselves with, than to torture animals "just for
fun," there should be a law compelling decent conduct. Every
animal has the right to freedom and kindness and justice, if it is
only a pig. Each and every abuse to any animal is a sad reflection
on our worth or claims as an intelligent, decent person in a sup
posedly Christian land.

Tsk! tsk, Betty.
