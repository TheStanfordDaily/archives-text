"BURLESQUE"—Geary.
Once mure we refuse to "flatter the
malignant passions of human nature,"
and instead admit happily that we
enjoyed "Burlesque," with Bessie
Love, now running its first week at
the Geary. Particularly the last act,
which is not only novel entertain
ment, but has an original method of
climax.
Of course, the plot of the noble, un
selfish actress who goes back to her
true love in spite of his weaknesses,
or the greater opportunities offered
her, is hokum, but in spite of that the
play is well-vitalized. Why anyone
should want to compare it to "Broad
way" we don't know —the only points
of similarity are that the locale of
both is back-stage life, and that they
are playing next door to each other.
"Burlesque" is beginning its sev
enth month in New York with original
cast, and this is the first production
of it outside. The idea of playing
New York successes at the same time
out here on the coast with a West
ern company appeals to us immense
ly, and if the success of "The Desert
Song," now in Los Angeles, and this
show, is significant, it is a splendid
plan.
The appeal of a "play within a
play" is well-known, and the revue
within this play was almost predes
tined popular before the last act ar
rives. There are some good blue
songs, some good clowning, and some
exceptionally good dancing. Bessie
Love is mighty nice and she can
dance.
Skid, played by Jere Delaney, is
good, and he also can dance. Lefty,
with James Donlan, the rotund stage
manager, appealed to us particularly
because of his immortal plea, "Wish
somebody would treat to me to a
bed! Can you hire people to do your
sleeping for you?"
"Burlesque" is a hard play to say
anything about, except to recommend
you to see for yourselves, not only
for amusement, but as antidote to the
effect of finals next week. —H.J.K.

Meet a delightful young lady who i
is not saccharine, as her name ira- j
plies, and not sad and girlishly sim- j
pie, as the camera has so often sug-1
gested. Meet a movie star who was
saved by the Charleston dance craze
from an illustrious, but montonously
weepy, career as the screen's most
convincing sufferer. Meet a girl whose
very entry in a screen drama invari
ably used to provoke "Hearts and
Flowers" from the theatre organists, J
but whose new and real self sends
one away from an interview fervently
carolling, "Oh, Boy—What a Girl!"
In brief, meet Miss Bessie Love, j
who is making her first stage appear- j
ance as the star of "Burlesque" in j

the city this week.
Having become thoroughly condi
tioned to her he real, harrowed screen
shadow, I was wonder-stricken when
1 saw her on the stage. She acted not
like a wisp of a rainbow but like a
real human being. She strummed a
uke more fetchingly than "Li'l Eva"
Duncan. And, well—if you haven't
seen Bessie Love dance then "you
ain't seen nothin' yet"!
After the show I went back to talk
to her. She is not at all what you
expect. Vivacity is her outstanding
characteristic; that is, gayness and
a very active sense of humor. She is
very young and exceptionally attrac
tive. She has a strong personality—
quite as much "It" as the more no
torious Miss Bow —but a bit more re
fined than the red-headed flapper.
Miss Love seems a very happy per
son, not in the Pollyanna manner, but
as one who gets a huge kick out of
life.
She was telling me about the pic
ture she just finished. "We had so
much fun making it. It was so funny
we often just had to stop shooting
and have our laughs out. We said
that, even if it wasn't funny to the
audience it was a scream to us!" This
was in reference to "The Matinee
Idol," in which she stars for Columbia
Pictures.
"Of course I'm enjoying the role of
'Bonny' in this play. The company has
certainly spoiled me." She will play
"Burlesque" only in San Francisco
and Los Angeles, and then will go
back into pictures. But her initial at
tempt has been such an overwhelm
ing success that I'm sure we'll see her
on the stage again soon.
Since she is known far and wide
as Hollywood's foremost exponent of
the dance, I asked her how many
novelty steps we collegians should
know.
Down south they're doing all kinds
of steps, and in the ballrooms at the
Biltmore and the Ambassador, too.
The 'Varsity Drag' is all right for a
couple, but the 'Gigolo' is really too
difficult for two to do. We all go to
the Ambassador on Friday night,
which is College Night, to see the
j freak steps that the college students
j perform," she explained.
[ Miss Love is not only glamorous,
but practical. She has a ranch down
in the San Joaquin valley, and we
discussed the relative value of cotton
and raisins, the astute young lady
having planed the former.
I am going to look up one of those
ads for developing the personality
and take a course. Two years ago
Bessie Love was a demure and stereo
typed heroine. Then came the
Charleston and she emerged as a per
sonality-plus young lady. So perhaps
some of the rest of us can learn to
be the Life of the Party, too!

to her. She is not at all what you
expect. Vivacity is her outstanding
characteristic; that is, gayness and
a very active sense of humor. She is
very young and exceptionally attrac
tive. She has a strong personality—
quite as much "It" as the more no
torious Miss Bow —but a bit more re
fined than the red-headed flapper.
Miss Love seems a very happy per
son, not in the Pollyanna manner, but
as one who gets a huge kick out of
life.
She was telling me about the pic
ture she just finished. "We had so
much fun making it. It was so funny
we often just had to stop shooting
and have our laughs out. We said
that, even if it wasn't funny to the
audience it was a scream to us!" This
was in reference to "The Matinee
Idol," in which she stars for Columbia
Pictures.
"Of course I'm enjoying the role of
'Bonny' in this play. The company has
certainly spoiled me." She will play
"Burlesque" only in San Francisco
and Los Angeles, and then will go
back into pictures. But her initial at
tempt has been such an overwhelm
ing success that I'm sure we'll see her
on the stage again soon.
Since she is known far and wide
as Hollywood's foremost exponent of
the dance, I asked her how many
novelty steps we collegians should
know.
Down south they're doing all kinds
of steps, and in the ballrooms at the
Biltmore and the Ambassador, too.
The 'Varsity Drag' is all right for a
couple, but the 'Gigolo' is really too
difficult for two to do. We all go to
the Ambassador on Friday night,
which is College Night, to see the
j freak steps that the college students
j perform," she explained.
[ Miss Love is not only glamorous,
but practical. She has a ranch down
in the San Joaquin valley, and we
discussed the relative value of cotton
and raisins, the astute young lady
having planed the former.
I am going to look up one of those
ads for developing the personality
and take a course. Two years ago
Bessie Love was a demure and stereo
typed heroine. Then came the
Charleston and she emerged as a per
sonality-plus young lady. So perhaps
some of the rest of us can learn to
be the Life of the Party, too!
"BURLESQUE"—Geary.
Once mure we refuse to "flatter the
malignant passions of human nature,"
and instead admit happily that we
enjoyed "Burlesque," with Bessie
Love, now running its first week at
the Geary. Particularly the last act,
which is not only novel entertain
ment, but has an original method of
climax.
Of course, the plot of the noble, un
selfish actress who goes back to her
true love in spite of his weaknesses,
or the greater opportunities offered
her, is hokum, but in spite of that the
play is well-vitalized. Why anyone
should want to compare it to "Broad
way" we don't know —the only points
of similarity are that the locale of
both is back-stage life, and that they
are playing next door to each other.
"Burlesque" is beginning its sev
enth month in New York with original
cast, and this is the first production
of it outside. The idea of playing
New York successes at the same time
out here on the coast with a West
ern company appeals to us immense
ly, and if the success of "The Desert
Song," now in Los Angeles, and this
show, is significant, it is a splendid
plan.
The appeal of a "play within a
play" is well-known, and the revue
within this play was almost predes
tined popular before the last act ar
rives. There are some good blue
songs, some good clowning, and some
exceptionally good dancing. Bessie
Love is mighty nice and she can
dance.
Skid, played by Jere Delaney, is
good, and he also can dance. Lefty,
with James Donlan, the rotund stage
manager, appealed to us particularly
because of his immortal plea, "Wish
somebody would treat to me to a
bed! Can you hire people to do your
sleeping for you?"
"Burlesque" is a hard play to say
anything about, except to recommend
you to see for yourselves, not only
for amusement, but as antidote to the
effect of finals next week. —H.J.K.

Meet a delightful young lady who i

from an illustrious, but montonously

Having become thoroughly condi

shadow, I was wonder-stricken when
1 saw her on the stage. She acted not
like a wisp of a rainbow but like a

Love is mighty nice and she can
dance.

Meet a delightful young lady who i
is not saccharine, as her name ira- j
plies, and not sad and girlishly sim- j
pie, as the camera has so often sug-1
gested. Meet a movie star who was
saved by the Charleston dance craze
from an illustrious, but montonously
weepy, career as the screen's most
convincing sufferer. Meet a girl whose
very entry in a screen drama invari
ably used to provoke "Hearts and
Flowers" from the theatre organists, J
but whose new and real self sends
one away from an interview fervently
carolling, "Oh, Boy—What a Girl!"
In brief, meet Miss Bessie Love, j
who is making her first stage appear- j
ance as the star of "Burlesque" in j

the city this week.
Having become thoroughly condi
tioned to her he real, harrowed screen
shadow, I was wonder-stricken when
1 saw her on the stage. She acted not
like a wisp of a rainbow but like a
real human being. She strummed a
uke more fetchingly than "Li'l Eva"
Duncan. And, well—if you haven't
seen Bessie Love dance then "you
ain't seen nothin' yet"!
After the show I went back to talk
to her. She is not at all what you
expect. Vivacity is her outstanding
characteristic; that is, gayness and
a very active sense of humor. She is
very young and exceptionally attrac
tive. She has a strong personality—
quite as much "It" as the more no
torious Miss Bow —but a bit more re
fined than the red-headed flapper.
Miss Love seems a very happy per
son, not in the Pollyanna manner, but
as one who gets a huge kick out of
life.
She was telling me about the pic
ture she just finished. "We had so
much fun making it. It was so funny
we often just had to stop shooting
and have our laughs out. We said
that, even if it wasn't funny to the
audience it was a scream to us!" This
was in reference to "The Matinee
Idol," in which she stars for Columbia
Pictures.
"Of course I'm enjoying the role of
'Bonny' in this play. The company has
certainly spoiled me." She will play
"Burlesque" only in San Francisco
and Los Angeles, and then will go
back into pictures. But her initial at
tempt has been such an overwhelm
ing success that I'm sure we'll see her
on the stage again soon.
Since she is known far and wide
as Hollywood's foremost exponent of
the dance, I asked her how many
novelty steps we collegians should
know.
Down south they're doing all kinds
of steps, and in the ballrooms at the
Biltmore and the Ambassador, too.
The 'Varsity Drag' is all right for a
couple, but the 'Gigolo' is really too
difficult for two to do. We all go to
the Ambassador on Friday night,
which is College Night, to see the
j freak steps that the college students
j perform," she explained.
[ Miss Love is not only glamorous,
but practical. She has a ranch down
in the San Joaquin valley, and we
discussed the relative value of cotton
and raisins, the astute young lady
having planed the former.
I am going to look up one of those
ads for developing the personality
and take a course. Two years ago
Bessie Love was a demure and stereo
typed heroine. Then came the
Charleston and she emerged as a per
sonality-plus young lady. So perhaps
some of the rest of us can learn to
be the Life of the Party, too!
"BURLESQUE"—Geary.
Once mure we refuse to "flatter the
malignant passions of human nature,"
and instead admit happily that we
enjoyed "Burlesque," with Bessie
Love, now running its first week at
the Geary. Particularly the last act,
which is not only novel entertain
ment, but has an original method of
climax.
Of course, the plot of the noble, un
selfish actress who goes back to her
true love in spite of his weaknesses,
or the greater opportunities offered
her, is hokum, but in spite of that the
play is well-vitalized. Why anyone
should want to compare it to "Broad
way" we don't know —the only points
of similarity are that the locale of
both is back-stage life, and that they
are playing next door to each other.
