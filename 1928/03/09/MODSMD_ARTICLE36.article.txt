# GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT ACQUIRES FRAGMENTS OF ANCIENT SKELETON
## 
### 
Two teeth and other fragments of a
mastodon skeleton, which was discovered
last June near the foothills between
Menlo Park and Redwood City, have re
cently been acquired by the Geology De
partment. According to Professor Eliot
Blackwelder, the presence of the skele
ton, which is probably from five to twen
ty-five thousand years old, is significant
in the geological history of this region.
Mastodon skeletons have been found
from coast to coast of the continent, as
well as on nearby islands, especially those
off Santa Baral>ara. Probably the most
wonderful collection of fossils ever dis
covered, however, said Professor Black
welder, is that on the Rancho Brea,
an ancient tar-pit near Los Angeles, in
which animals were caught and embedded.
The remains of mastodons, mammoths,
saber-tooth tigers, and camels, as wells
as many other animals, have been found
there.
Although the skeleton found last June
was offered for sale, no one considered
it worth the expense of disembedding it
from its twenty-five foot covering, and
of mounting it.
