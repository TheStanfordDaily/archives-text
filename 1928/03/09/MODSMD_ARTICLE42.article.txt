DURHAM, N.C., Mar. B.— (U.P.)—
Instead of football the students dabbled
with Selectae Veteri or Historia Sacra.
The quads were deserted for researches
into Lucian's dialogues or Ovidii Editio
Expurgata.
The collegians got board for $13 to $15
a month and parents were happy. Tuition
was a mere $30 a year.
All this at North Carolina University,
105 years ago, according to a state alma
nac for 1823 found by a boy scout in an
abandoned house here.
There were no comprehensive tests for
entrance in those days. The few high
school students delved into Latin gram
mar, Corderious, Aesop's Fables, Corne
lius Nepos, or Viri Romae to gain en
trance into college.
Their records as athletes were waived.
If you weathered the mental storms of
Sallust and algebra, Horace and spheri
cal trigonometry, you became a senior
and were privileged, the almanac revealed,
to take the following subjects:
Chemistry, moral philosophy, mineral
ogy, geology, progress of metaphysical,
ethical, and poetical philosophy, logic,
progress of mathematics and physical
sciences, astronomy, rhetoric, chronology,
and declamation. If you mastered these
subjects in 1823 you received a diploma
and went out into the great wide world.
