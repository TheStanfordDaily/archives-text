Mysticism is the keynote of the exhi
bition of water colors and pastels which
opens this morning in the Stanford Art
Gallery. The drawings are the work of
Angelica S. Patterson, whose delicacy of
color and spirituality of feeling in the
elusive character of her imagination
make her art pure poetry.
The artist has chosen small pieces of
poetry to interpret in the films of color
and light she uses in her little master
pieces. In truth, each picture is a piece
of the imagination of an ethereal-minded
artist.
A typical bit of poetry which Miss Pat
terson interprets through her soft pale
shades is: Thrust your open arms out

heavenward; Fill them from the tide on
coming.
Other subjects treated in the same in
genious manner which is. a distinctive
characteristic of Miss Patterson's are:
"It is a time for stir, humanity lies open
to it and powers pass through." One
study in the rose shades shows a "pulsing
cosmic breath and a mighty thronging
movement." "The Gates Swing Open"
shows a filmy shadow of a man, truly an
atom in the immense universe before
him, standing before the great gates of
heaven and life.
