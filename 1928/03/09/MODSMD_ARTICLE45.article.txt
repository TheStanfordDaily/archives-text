# FRESHMAN BASEBALL NINE TO BATTLE WITH SAN FRANCISCO PREPS
## 
### 
After a forced lay-off of over a week
and a half, Coach Husky Hunt's yearling
baseball men will take the field tomorrow
morning against the Mission High School
nine none the worse for their rest. Ihe
babes exhibited their early season pep and
accuracy in an interclass game against
the Seniors last night, thus dispelling all
fears to the contrary. Coach Hunt has
ordered a light batting practice for to
night.
Don Story, sensational freshman hurler,
and Joe Fessio will probably be tlie bat
tery against the prep men. Spud Hardy,
regular catcher, injured his hand in last
night's contest and may be forced out of
the game for a few days.
The Mission team, which was runner
up for its league championship last sea
son, will present a well-balanced team.
The star high school infield is noted for
its fast fielding.
Stanford's regular infield and outfield
men will play tomorrow. A great num
ber of the yearlings' games have been
canceled and Hunt feels that the first
string men will need all the experience
possible before meeting the strong Cali
fornia nine.
The game will be played on the fresh
man diamond at 10:30 o'clock.
