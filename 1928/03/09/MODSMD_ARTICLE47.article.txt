# SPORTS OF 1928

### BY "FEG MURRAY, '18 
There are other male swimmers in
the world besides Johnny Weissmul
ler, although probably a large per
centage of the public hasn't ever
heard of them. There is Arne Borg,
the Swedish Leviathan, for instance,
who holds most of the world's free
style records not credited to Chicago
Johnny. But Arne doesn't count in
this discussion, as he is abroad and
this deals with three men who will
be Johnny's rivals in the coming in
door championships at Chicago early
next month.
Spence, Kojac, and Laufer will give
Johnny Weissmuller plenty of trou- j
ble any time they meet him, and al
ready some of them have taken his
measure, and also some of his rec- :
ords. Walter Laufer, for instance,
holds the accepted world's record for
100 and 200 meters backstroke, at 1 j

minute, 11 and 2-10ths seconds, and
2 minutes, 38 and 8-10ths seconds, re
spectively. Yet George Kojac is the
indoor and outdoor backstroke cham
pion, and has beaten both Johnny and
Walter in this event, and has set a
new record, yet to be accepted, for
the 400-meter dorsal-type of swim
ming.
Walter Spence has made new rec
ords, yet to be accepted, in the 100-
and 200-meter breaststroke events,
and holds the indoor and outdoor
championships. Spence is a very ver
satile performer, being a fine free
style and backstroke swimmer as
well.
George Kojac, the amateur swim
ming sensation of 1927, is also a fine
free-style performer. He won second
place in the indoor 220 and the out
door 100 meters, and should be even
i better this year.
