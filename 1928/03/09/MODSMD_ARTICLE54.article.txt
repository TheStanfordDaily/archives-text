Even if Stanford loses the meet with
L.A.A.C. tomorrow, and even if the whole
aiTair is terrible —which it won't be—
Cardinal fans should get their money's
worth out of the race between Captain
Bud Spencer and Percy Neirsbach in the
quarter.
The former Trojan flash has
firmly established his reputation
in this event, and Spencer's long,
machine-like stride has made the
Card skipper a prominent figure
in western track. Unless one of
the two develops apoplexy or
breaks a leg before, or during, the
race it should have sufficient
quality to stir the most blase
sportsman.
Not that the quarter will be the only
thing worth sitting through tomorrow.
A battery of ligld and track events is
scheduled that probably won't be equaled
here this year. It isn't every day that a
group of men like Paddock, Maxwell, the
Smith Brothers, Zombro, and Nichols
(etc., etc., etc.) is assembled in one place.
And in addition fans will be
given a chance to see some pos
sible United States representa
tives in the Olympic games at
Amsterdam next summer.
Stanford is sponsoring a decathlon to
give Olympic aspirants a chance to get
some experience in actual competition.
Biff Huffman, Swede Leistner, former
Card stars, are scheduled to compete.
Chuck Lewis, Missouri polevaulter and
once a Stanford graduate student, John
ny Myrra, Finn javelin champ, and Jack
Merchant, former Bear weightman, will
all be there.
This decathlon business may
not be the most spectacular fea
ture of the day, but it will be in
teresting to see Hoffman, famous
for his brawny proportions, run
the hurdles and the 100, not to
mention his competition in the
pole vault and broad jump. Ru
mor has it, by the way, that Biff
isn't so slow in going over the
sticks and clearing the bar.
