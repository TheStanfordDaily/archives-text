# HERKIMER ADAMS TO LEAD CARD FENCERS AGAINST CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Herkimer Adams, first man on the
varsity fencing team, was chosen captain
of the 1928 five yesterday afternoon.
Adams is the outstanding performer of
the squad. He was a member of the Car
dinal team that met California last year,
and has fenced with the Olympic Club
foilsmen for several seasons.
California swordsmen will visit Palo
Alto tomorrow night determined to de
feat the Stanford fencers in their annual
"Big Meet." The confidence of being
veteran team and the remembrance of a
Blue and Gold victory last year will do
much to support their claims.
The Cardinal camp, however, has not
been idle. E. A. Bugge and Harry Ma
loney, Stanford coaches, have developed
a group of men who were practically new
at the sport last fall, into what is now a
highly creditable team. With Captain
Adams as a mainstay, the Stanford squad
is given by experts, who have seen both
squads in action, an even chance to take
a victory over the Bears.
Coach Bugge has announced the line
up as follows: (1) H. Adams, (2) A.
Scotten, (3) O. Taft, (4) R. Hull, (5)
F. Dutton, alternate, M. Kilgore.
Five veteran fencers from the Olym
pic, Athens, and Italian athletic clubs will
be chosen to referee. It is very probable
that several exhibition matches between
these men will be arranged.
The meet will be held at 8 o'clock in the
main room of Encina Gymnasium. The
public, both men and women, are invited.
