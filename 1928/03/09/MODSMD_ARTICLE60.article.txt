# STANFORD BOXER MEETS BEARS TONIGHT IN FIRST SCHEDULED BOUTS SINCE 1922
## Two Champs Will Perform; U.C. Captain Has Won Thirty-Two Bouts Fidel La Barba Returns to Aid Maloney and Schall In Card Corner 
### Carroll O'Meara 
Two Pacific Coast boxing cliam-1
pions will perform tonight when the
Stanford boxers climb into the ring j
at Harmon gymnasium, Berkeley, to j
face California in the first match the i
two universities have staged since i
1922.
These two men are Norman Fain,
Cardinal captain who won the Far
Western Intercollegiate light-heavy
weight crown last season, and Cap
tain Frank Ribbel, champion welter
weight who presented the Bears with
his thirty-second intercollegiate vic
tory when the Blue-aiul-Gold warriors
met Washington recently.
Critics are inclined to give the
Berkeley team an edge to take a ma
jority of the bouts tonight by virtue
of their 5-2 win over Davis Aggies,
which team Stanford lost to by a 4-3
score. The California pugilists have
also indulged in one match more this
season than have Maloney's men.
This added experience may prove
profitable to them tonight.
Considerable encouragement came
to the local camp last night when it
was learned that Fidel La Barba, re-1
tired flyweight champion of the world,
had returned to the University and |
will assist Coach Maloney and Myron
Schall in the Cardinal corner tonight.
After final workouts last night it
was announced that the following
men were definitely chosen to repre- i
sent Stanford: Ed Dillon, heavy-;
weight; Captain Fain, light-heavy- j
weight; Homer Toberman, middle
weight; Dan Frost, welterweight;
John Hromadka, lightweight; Bill
Levitt, featherweight; and John Sano. I
bantam; Harris Skelton, Harry!
Birch, and Tom Goodloe will box in
exhibition matches.
Tickets for the bouts will be sold
in the Board of Control office today
for thirty-five cents with student body
cards.
