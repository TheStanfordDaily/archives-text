# EIGHT CARD MERMEN TO ENTER RACES FOR JUNIOR CHAMPIONSHIP
## To Hold Meet at Olympic Club, San Francisco, Sunday Night 
### 
Eight Stanford aquatic stars will en
ter the Pacific Athletic Association jun
ior championship races at the Olympic
Club pool in San Francisco Sunday night
and attempt to smash two coast records.
All the men will register as unattached,
because of the meet being held on Sun
day.
Hadley Bramel, stellar sophomore mer
man, is doped to take an easy win in the
500-yard free style race, and possibly
break the P.A.A. senior record as well.
"Judging by Bramel's time of 5:22 1-5
which lie made in the 440-yard free style
here last week, he ought to do close to
six minutes flat in the 500-yard free style,
j This is fast enough to win first place
in the junior race, and would break the
present senior record."
Ogden Driggs, Sandy Smith, Arthur
i Jessop, and Walter Brown have signed up
' for the 150-yard backstroke event. Since
1:48 is the present P.A.A. senior record,
Brandsten is confident that Driggs will
beat that mark as well as take first in the
i junior schedule. Smith is liable to go well
under two minutes, which would mean a
, place.
' Among Mills, Throndson, and Marsh.
| the former is favored to place highest in
i the low springboard diving contest. Har-
I oid P. Smith of the Los Angeles Athletic
j Club, who is considered the best diver in
the South, will be one of the contestants,
j but the Cardinal springboard artists are
I expected to give him a hard race for first
| place.
