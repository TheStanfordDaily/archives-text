the U.C.L.A. team 011 the varsity courts j
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.
Bob Laird and Rod Houser, first and
second men on the U.C.L.A. varsity, have
had long experience at intercollegiate
playing, and they will probably give A1
Herrington and Ralph McElvenny plenty
of stiff competition. The remainder of
the U.C.L.A. varsity forms a team which
has the reputation of being a strong con
tingent in the south, so there is 110 prom
ise of any one-sided matches.
The freshman team will meet the Saint
Ignatius High School team at 9:30 o'clock !
on the varsity courts, and also will play j
! four singles and two doubles matches, j
The freshman team, headed by Doeg, j
Weesner, Easton, and Stephens, still re-1
mains undefeated.
Thomas, sixth ranking player on the ;
varsity, defeated Hall, fourth man, inj
the second round of the varsity ranking
tournament yesterday afternoon with a
score of 8-6, 6-2. Gantner and Forbes
lost to Stephens and Easton in a sched
uled three set game. Both of these dou
bles pairs are freshman teams but they I
were not playing a match for team rank
ings.
All ranking matches for both freshman
and varsity teams should be completed by
