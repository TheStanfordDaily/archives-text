# STANFORD YEARLINGS WILL MEET EASTBAY HIGH SCHOOL TEAMS TOMORROW MORNING
## Oakland Trackmen Strong In Sprints, Broad Jump Against Card Babes 
### 
An All-Star team from the Oakland
high schools will attempt to take the
measure of the Cardinal frosh track
team tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock j
in a meet on the varsity oval.
The Bay City is said to have the
strongest team in years, and intends
to make the 1931 men fight to the ;
last event for a victory. Reports show |
that the opposition will bring with '
them outstanding stars in the broad
jump and dashes. Although they are (
weak in most of the field events, they :
intend to gather most of their points
in the runs.
A light work-out today will end
babe preparation for the meet. The
track yesterday was still rough from
the week of rains, but a warm day
today is expected to put the track in
the best of condition. A dry field will
raise the freshmen's chances con
siderably.
Although the freshman team will
be without the services of Parker,
star ruiler, and Harper, ranking jave
lin tosser, the prospects for a victory
are very bright. Wright will take care
of the mile run and Perreli-Minetti
will compete in the javelin event.
Both won first places in their event
in the meet last Saturday. Whether
or not Bnrt DeGroot can compete to
morrow in the pole vault will mean
the difference of five points to the
frosh total.
Despite the expected stiff competi
tion, Hec Dyer and Maynor Shove
will undoubtedly come through for
wins in the century, furlong, and 440-
yard dash. Ray Dawson is a sure bet
for first in the shot-put, while Mc-
Leod is slated for a win in the discus.
