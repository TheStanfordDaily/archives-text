Coach Harry Wolter's varsity baseball
nine will again swing into action tumor
row afternoon at 2:30 o'clock after more
than a week's lay-off because of rain,
! when the Cards meet St. Mary's in the
| third and deciding game of the series,
j Wolter put the Stanford squad through
I a brisk work-out yesterday and will top
it off with a light practice session today,
j Both games with the Saints this year
i have been close and well played, and fans
i are looking forward to another good
! nine innings tomorrow. In the first clash
with "Slip" Madigan's team, the Cards
came off with the long end of a 9-8 score.
St. Mary's retaliated in the next en
counter to win 2-1.
The chucking job for Stanford will
likely be given to Gene Kern, who showed
up well in the second tilt with Santa
I Clara, striking out four men and allow
ing but two hits during the three innings
he pitched. Hamilton will probably do the
tossing for the visitors.
St. Mary's has the reputation of being
a team of heavy hitters and has borne
out the record this year. Led by Don
dero, the Babe Ruth of the conference,
the Saints garnered thirteen hits from
the offerings of Stanford hurlers in the
first fracas. Dondero, by the way, has
lifted the ball over the Stanford left-field
fence three times during the 1928 season.
However, the Cards have not been un
usually gentle in the way in which they
have socked the ball around the field in
games against the Gaels. Levin, Sims, and
j Garibaldi have been the most consistent
■ hitters.
Stanford's conference standing is now
| the two games with St. Mary's he
|ing the only ones played. Santa Clara
I dropped out of the conference about two
■ | weeks ago.
