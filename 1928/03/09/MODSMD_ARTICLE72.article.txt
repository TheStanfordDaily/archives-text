## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, March 8. — J
(U.P.) —In a decision, handed down
today by the Supreme Court, the 1925
law governing the taxation of stocks, j
bonds, mortgages, solvent credits, and
the Amendment thereto, voted by the
State Legislature in 1927, were de
clared unconstitutional.
The decision written by Justice |
Richards and concurred in by four of
his colleagues, met with only two dis
senting votes.
The ruling was made in the test '
case of Arnold vs. Hopkins, a Los
Angeles action.
The 1925 law specifies that all
stocks, bonds, mortgages, and solvent
credits shall be assessed at seven per
cent of their cash value. The 1927
amendment specified that they be as
sessed at the arbitrary rate of $1.45
on the 100, making a substantial in
crease over the previous tax basis.
Today's decision throws out both
the law and amendment, the basis of ,
taxation reverting back to the origi
nal "ad valorem" system in vogue be- ,
lore the 1925 law was passed.
The defendant in the action was
the assessor of Los Angeles county.
As the result of today's decision, mil
lions of dollars were expected to be
saved California taxpayers.
