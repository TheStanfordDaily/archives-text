# NEW YORK PEDESTRIAN DEFEATS CITY TRAFFIC

### 
NEW YORK, March B.—(U.P.) —
Pedestrians, long the subject of cartoons
and scathing denunciations of any auto
ist who wished to have the right of way,
have at last revolted.
Thornton Lee Roberts, after waiting on
a perilous corner here for many minutes
to cross the street, raised his large walk
ing stick and in true shillalah fashion
crashed his way through the traffic.
Another argument for the walking
stick—but Roberts is charged with dis
orderly conduct.
