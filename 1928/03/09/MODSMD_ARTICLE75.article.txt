### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Mar. 8.-
(U.P.) —More testimony was heard by
the Senate Teapot Dome investigating
committee today bearing on indirect meth
ods of financing past Republican presi
dential campaigns^
James A. Patten, Chicago wheat king,
told the committee that in 1923 the late
Fred W. Upham, then treasurer of the
Republican National Committee, gave
him $25,000 in Liberty bonds for which
he put up $25,000 in cash toward the Re
publican National Committee deficit. Of
these bonds, $20,000 corresponded by
serial number with the famous Conti
nental Liberty bonds.
These bonds were from the $50,000
worth sent to Upham by Will Hays, for
merly chairman of the national committee,
who had received them as part of $160,000
in bonds from Harry F. Sinclair. Thus
the fuuds actually put up by Sinclair
were, in this case, partly put into the
Republican National Committee fund by
a roundabout route by which Patten, in
stead of Sinclair, appeared to be the
contributor.
Patten's transaction occurred Decem
ber 5, 1923, three days after "a prima
facie case of Fall's bribery" had been
made by the Senate Teapot Dome com

rnittee, Senator Walsh of Montana re
marked. Patten said he did not remem
j her that and if he did notice it at the time
he did not connect the two episodes.
