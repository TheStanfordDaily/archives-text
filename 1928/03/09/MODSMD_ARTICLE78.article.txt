OKLAHOMA CITY, Mar. B.—(U.P.)
—Governmental corruption is the big js
sue in the presidential campaign, in the
opinuui of Nellie Taylor Ross of Wyo
ming.
Mrs. Ross was the first woman to be
come governor of a state, having suc
ceeded her husband as Wyoming's gover
nor. She is a Democrat and a leader in
the councils of her party.
Prohibition, Mrs. Ross told the United
Press in an interview at the home of
relatives here, is no longer an issue, be
cause it now is a part of the Constitution
of the United States and a settled ques
tion.
She supports A1 Smith for her party's
presidential nomination but if a wet plat
form is advanced she will not align her
self with its supporters, Mrs. Ross said.
"The most vital problem which con
fronts the nation now is to cleanse the
federal government of shameless corrup
tion that has characterized this regime of
eight years," Mrs. Ross said.
"In no like period has there ever been

such a pollution in national government.
"It is the responsibility of every woman
to study party principles and through the
intelligence obtained, to declare her al
legiance. But she should be expected to
continue that allegiance only so far as
the party reflects her personal convictions.
"Just as women in business have served
to raise business standards, so will their
activities serve to elevate politics. Women
have not been enfranchised long, but their
influence in national political life is be
coming evident.
"Over the entire country are women of
strong leadership lending special study
to political problems and arousing among
women a desire to assert their privilege."
