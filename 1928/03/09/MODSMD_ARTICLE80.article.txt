# MEXICAN IMMIGRATION LIMITATION PROPOSED BY HOUSE COMMITTEE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March B.—(U.P.)
-—The House Immigration Committee
discussed in executive session today
tentative legislation for further re
striction on Mexican immigration as
a compromise for the Box Immigra
tion bill.
While the committee seemed op
posed to report favorably the Box
bill, whereby all other western na
tions would be placed on a quota
basis', a strong sentiment toward
enacting further restriction was ap
parent. This sentiment may take the
form of restrictions on Mexican In
dians and others of mixed blood from
the southern republic, who have been
entering the United States in large
numbers.
The committee seemed also to favor
increasing the border patrol, so that
many could be stopped from entering
the country who ordinarily would be
denied admission.
There was indication that the com
mittee may also seek to restrict
"visitors" —persons who enter the

country supposedly ror a short period
—but many of whom, according to
Representative Box, Texas TV r.ocrat,
and author of the bill, remain here.
