# CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP STUDENT TURNS OUT PERFECTED APPARATUS
## 
### 
Two new devices for psychological
experiments have been developed re
cently by Siegen K. Chou, a Chinese
government Tsing Hua Scholarship
student and a psychology graduate at
Stanford. Chou's "Quadrant Tachisto
scope," or exposure apparatus, achiev
ed considerable local recognition last
year.
A universal finger maze box, to be
known as a "Pattern Box," is the first
of the psychologist's developments.
Professors Terman, Miles, Merrill,
and Stone of Stanford, as well as a
number of psychologists from other
universities, expect to put it to a wide
variety of uses. The "Pattern Box" is
a further development and improve
ment on Professor Mile's wire finger
maze technique.
The second apparatus designed by
Chou is a multiple Groove Board,
originally designed to be used for
testing annual skill in controlling a
ball that is free to roll on a board
consisting of a series of uniformly
cut cross-section grooves. By filling
the unused grooves with square
wooden rods, the board can be in
stantly turned into a handy groove
or stylus maze board of any design.
Any finger maze-pattern of any de
sign. Any finger maze-pattern can
also be built on it by filling the
proper grooves with specially-made
rods having a round ridge on the top.

have made bowling a major item in
their athletic program and are plan
