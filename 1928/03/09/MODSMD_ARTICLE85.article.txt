# CLOWN PRINCE LLOYD TAKES LEAD IN RACE TO STANFORD THRONE
## Cinderella King Ready For "Crack at Queening" If Elected 
### 
Cloudy skies and "Wet Rain" went
hand in hand yesterday when the
Clown Prince Kenny W. Lloyd jumped
into the lead for Merry Monarch of
the little Stanford Kingdom which
will rise and fall in a day, April 7. In
an interview with this second Hat
field, the Rainmaker, yesterday, it
was learned that after having had
some experience in the art of "King
ing" in a "Kiss for Cinderella," he
was now ready to take a "crack at
Queening," as he so quaintly ex
pressed it.
April showers bring May flowers is
a bit previous, but at least Stanford
men bring flowers as little offerings
to the shrine of "Flower" Potts for
King. When the wavy red-haired
young man with royal aspirations
was asked about the imperial seat he
might be called upon to fill, lie re
sponded: "I'm just a normal, healthy
American boy trying to get along in
the world, but if the Stanford popu
lace chooses to elect me, far be it
from me to disappoint my public."
"Foijr-Foot Rule" Adams is third of
the kingly candidates. He feels that
he will truiy be a bread-giver if he is
chosen as the instrument of monarchy
by the Stanford populace. The fourth
candidate in line is the "Optimo
King" Sypher. It is rumored that the
cigar interest in San Francisco is
backing him to its last puff.
These first four candidates were
leading the race yesterday at noon
hour when the Rally Committee
closed the polls. Today, Monday, and
Tuesday will be the last three days
of election. The polls will close at
twelve o'clock sharp on Tuesday
morning, or afternoon, "as you like
it."
Tickets for the Ball will lie on sale
today in the Old Union for $2.45.

a bit previous, but at least Stanford
men bring flowers as little offerings
to the shrine of "Flower" Potts for
King. When the wavy red-haired
young man with royal aspirations
was asked about the imperial seat he
might be called upon to fill, lie re
sponded: "I'm just a normal, healthy
American boy trying to get along in
the world, but if the Stanford popu
lace chooses to elect me, far be it
from me to disappoint my public."
"Foijr-Foot Rule" Adams is third of
the kingly candidates. He feels that
he will truiy be a bread-giver if he is
chosen as the instrument of monarchy
by the Stanford populace. The fourth
candidate in line is the "Optimo
King" Sypher. It is rumored that the
cigar interest in San Francisco is
backing him to its last puff.
These first four candidates were
leading the race yesterday at noon
hour when the Rally Committee
closed the polls. Today, Monday, and
Tuesday will be the last three days
of election. The polls will close at
twelve o'clock sharp on Tuesday
morning, or afternoon, "as you like
it."

Cloudy skies and "Wet Rain" went
hand in hand yesterday when the
Clown Prince Kenny W. Lloyd jumped
into the lead for Merry Monarch of
the little Stanford Kingdom which
will rise and fall in a day, April 7. In
an interview with this second Hat
field, the Rainmaker, yesterday, it
was learned that after having had
some experience in the art of "King
ing" in a "Kiss for Cinderella," he
was now ready to take a "crack at
Queening," as he so quaintly ex
pressed it.
April showers bring May flowers is
a bit previous, but at least Stanford
