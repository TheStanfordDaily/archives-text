# DESIRE OF AMERICANS TO HAVE HAPPY TIME IMPRESSES ORIENTAL
## 
### 
"The thing that impressed me most
about the American people is their desire
to have a happy time," said Yung-Cheh
Shen, Korean graduate student, in an
interview granted the Daily recently. "I
may he wrong," he continued, "but 1
think they take 'a happy time' as their
motto. They are right, too, because with
out this one cannot live happily and ex
istence drops into dryness."
Mr. Shen received his degree at a Bap
tist missionary college in Shanghai. Uni
versity life in China is not so different
from what it is in the United States, since
the majority of the universities there are
those founded by missionaries or private
individuals from America or Europe, ac
cording to Mr. Shen.
Lectures in Chinese
In the Chinese Government schools
both texts and lectures are in Chinese, but
the fact that there are at least eighty-two
native dialects makes the education prob
lem exceedingly difficult where Chinese
is used. The "Mandarin Movement," an
attempt to bring about the use of one
standard form of Chinese, may eventu
ally correct this situation.
Dormitory life is popular in China,
since the universities are usually outside
the cities. Outside activities, however,
are an unheard-of thing in the Orient.
Mr. Shen believes that extra-curricular
interests are extremely valuable and lie
is making an observational study of,
well as taking a course 011 this phase of
university life.
Student Activities Limited
111 Koi;ea especially are student activi
ties limited. Free discussion outside the
classroom is forbidden, and whenever a
group is seen collecting, a policeman
quickly disperses it. The reason for this
is the fear 011 the part of the Japanese
Government that the students will agi
tate the question of Korea's political free
dom. £
On this question of Korean freedom
Mr. Shen is very positive. His attitude is
one of patience and tolerance rather than
of bitterness, but he firmly .states that
"Korean independence is a thing that will
be desired as long as there is a single
Korean in the world." Though it may
never be attained, it will always be an
ideal to inspire the coming generation, he
said. Korea has a culture and a civili
zation of its own, and should be a politi
cal as well as a spiritual unity.

"The thing that impressed me most
about the American people is their desire
to have a happy time," said Yung-Cheh
Shen, Korean graduate student, in an
interview granted the Daily recently. "I
may he wrong," he continued, "but 1
think they take 'a happy time' as their
motto. They are right, too, because with
out this one cannot live happily and ex
istence drops into dryness."
Mr. Shen received his degree at a Bap
tist missionary college in Shanghai. Uni
versity life in China is not so different
from what it is in the United States, since
the majority of the universities there are
those founded by missionaries or private
individuals from America or Europe, ac
cording to Mr. Shen.
Lectures in Chinese
In the Chinese Government schools
both texts and lectures are in Chinese, but
the fact that there are at least eighty-two
native dialects makes the education prob
lem exceedingly difficult where Chinese
is used. The "Mandarin Movement," an
attempt to bring about the use of one
standard form of Chinese, may eventu
ally correct this situation.
Dormitory life is popular in China,
since the universities are usually outside
the cities. Outside activities, however,
are an unheard-of thing in the Orient.
Mr. Shen believes that extra-curricular
interests are extremely valuable and lie
is making an observational study of,
well as taking a course 011 this phase of
university life.
Student Activities Limited
111 Koi;ea especially are student activi
ties limited. Free discussion outside the
classroom is forbidden, and whenever a
group is seen collecting, a policeman
quickly disperses it. The reason for this
is the fear 011 the part of the Japanese
Government that the students will agi
tate the question of Korea's political free
dom. £
On this question of Korean freedom
Mr. Shen is very positive. His attitude is
one of patience and tolerance rather than
of bitterness, but he firmly .states that
"Korean independence is a thing that will
be desired as long as there is a single
Korean in the world." Though it may
never be attained, it will always be an
ideal to inspire the coming generation, he
said. Korea has a culture and a civili
zation of its own, and should be a politi
cal as well as a spiritual unity.
