## Leland Stanford Junior's Birthday Was Old Date Commemorated Occasion Was Once General Holiday; Concerts Are Recent Innovation 
### Margaret Cummings 
"We had lots of fun in the old days—."
Dr. David Starr Jordan was reminiscing,
now that another Founders' Day means
i the thirty-seventh birthday of the Uni
! versity he has fathered so wisely and lov
! ingly and for so many years.
Not that Stanford seems a different
place to him now, either as a university
or in regard to the students who come
here. "There arc more of them, that's
i all." He is proud of the students Stan-
I ford has graduated who have made names
for themselves since.
| "Someone in each class will be known
! all over the country; some of these will
:be known all over the world. Herbert
j Hoover was the first, in the '95 class. The
I next class had some good ones, too. Jack
! Reynolds was full-back on the team that
! year, and is now president of the second
i largest bank in the world. Sarah Cotn
! stock was in that class also, and Ray Ly
| man Wilbur, whom 1 as a
| long-legged freshman who painted the
i old post-office back of the chapel all over
I with Stanford red."
Dr. Jordan told of the first Founders'
Day observance, held the year the Uni
versity opened, in 1891. "We all went j
down to Monterey for a picnic, faculty |
and students. This was on the fourteenth i
of May, Leland Junior's birthday, which
used to be Founders' Day.
"We didn't have automobiles in those
days, so we all took the train. The track J
only ran down as far as San Luis Obispo |
then. It was a general holiday, and almost j
everyone went. That was the greatest j
picnic we ever had. The next year we j
went over to the Big Trees at Santa Cruz.
"Later March ninth was observed in
! accordance with Mrs. Stanford's wish.
! At one time noted speakers from all over
I the country were secured to give the j
! Founders' Day address. In the last few
(years it has been the custom to observe'
1 these anniversaries with a program of
i music."
Musing over the early days, Dr. Jordan
I touched on the German maxim familiar
j to every Stanford student, "Der Luft Die
! Freiheit Weht," taken from Ulrich von
Hutton's speech to Luther's persecutors,
in which he said, 'Don't you know that
i the winds of freedom are blowing?' I
j used it in an address, Senator Stanford
liked it, and decided it would be a good
| motto for the University."

Dr. Jordan told of the first Founders'
Day observance, held the year the Uni
versity opened, in 1891. "We all went j
down to Monterey for a picnic, faculty |
and students. This was on the fourteenth i
of May, Leland Junior's birthday, which
used to be Founders' Day.
"We didn't have automobiles in those
days, so we all took the train. The track J
only ran down as far as San Luis Obispo |
then. It was a general holiday, and almost j
everyone went. That was the greatest j
picnic we ever had. The next year we j
went over to the Big Trees at Santa Cruz.
"Later March ninth was observed in
! accordance with Mrs. Stanford's wish.
! At one time noted speakers from all over
I the country were secured to give the j
! Founders' Day address. In the last few
(years it has been the custom to observe'
1 these anniversaries with a program of
i music."
Musing over the early days, Dr. Jordan
I touched on the German maxim familiar
j to every Stanford student, "Der Luft Die
! Freiheit Weht," taken from Ulrich von
Hutton's speech to Luther's persecutors,
in which he said, 'Don't you know that
i the winds of freedom are blowing?' I
j used it in an address, Senator Stanford
liked it, and decided it would be a good
| motto for the University."
"We had lots of fun in the old days—."
Dr. David Starr Jordan was reminiscing,
now that another Founders' Day means
i the thirty-seventh birthday of the Uni
! versity he has fathered so wisely and lov
! ingly and for so many years.
Not that Stanford seems a different
place to him now, either as a university
or in regard to the students who come
here. "There arc more of them, that's
i all." He is proud of the students Stan-
I ford has graduated who have made names
for themselves since.

! all over the country; some of these will
:be known all over the world. Herbert
j Hoover was the first, in the '95 class. The
I next class had some good ones, too. Jack
