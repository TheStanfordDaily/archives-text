Tobacco '
"A Prescription"
Have you ever noticed 1
right after a meal
How tired and laÂ»y
you always feel?
I'm telling you folks
it isn't a joke,
It will freshen you up "C
if you try a good smoke.
But whatever you do
these lines you must heed,
There's a certain tobacco
of course, that you need.
It's packed in a tin,
the tin's colored blue.
Not only the smoking
but the chewing kind too.
Of course if you never
are bothered this way,
Just keep the prescription
for some other day.
Ask for tobacco,
the best that's on earth;
To shorten the story,
just call it "Edgeworth."
