# FROSH ARE VICTORS OVER U.C. ONE-MAN TEAM IN GYM MEET
## 
### 
With a score of 50 points to 22 the
freshman gym team defeated the
California freshman team Saturday
night in the Encina gym. Because the
only freshman on the California team,
Santino, gained the entire 22 points
by himself, the glory of the Stanford
victory was somewhat invisible. The
California varsity downed the varsity
team 53 to 19, without any particular
difficulty.
Moeller, who has only one leg, took
throe first places, tied for first place
once, and took one second place for
the California varsity, with apparent
ease.
Bobby Gooden of the track team
won the rope-climb event in a little
less than five seconds.
The results of the seven events
were for the varsity team:
Long Horse, Moeller (C) and Ma
guire (C) tied for first, Harlow (C)
third; Side Horse, Moeller (C) first,
