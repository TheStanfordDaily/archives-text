### Whitney Wright, '31 
11l a closely contested meet, fea
tured by a great number of upsets
and surprising early-season marks,
the Stanford varsity track and field
team fell before the athletes of the i
l
Los Angeles Athletic Club by the i
score of 69 to G2 when the Southern
Caliiornia squad invaded the Cardi
nal Farm Saturday afternoon with
what was considered to be the great
est group of performers ever gathered
together on the Pacific Coast.
Winning first in the two-mile, first
in the low hurdles, and first and sec-!
ond in the mile, the Southerners upset j
the dope bucket in these events and :
took the meet. Henry Lunney, of the |
Club, after trailing Henry Coe for i
most of this race, came through with '
a strong sprint in the final lap of the
two-mile to pick the Stanford man
and win the race in the unusual time
of 9 minutes 35 3-5 seconds. Though j
placing third in the mile, Alex McKin-:
non of Stanford ran the four laps in .
4 minutes 22 2-5 seconds, his best sea-1
sonal mark.
The Nichols-West hurdling combina-1
tion went over the sticks according j
to schedule to win first and second in
the highs, Nichols taking first in
14 4-5 seconds. In the lows, West took
second to Maxwell, and Nichols did
not place.
Record Set in Broad Jump
A new Stanford record was turned
in in the broad jump event by Fred !
Zombro of Stanford with a leap of |
24 ft. 10 1-8 in. Dyer, also of Stanford,
was second with 23 ft. 8 3-8 in.
High-point honors of the meet were i
divided between Charlie Paddock, the j
"world's fastest human," and Eric j
Krenz, husky Stanford sophomore, j
Paddock won the two sprint events
and Krenz the shot put and discus.
Krenz threw the discus 154 ft. 9 in.
in an exhibition toss.
Bob King, lanky Stanford high
jumper, furnished the crowd a thrill
when he came within 2 1-16 in. of the j
world's record with a jump of 6 ft. 5
15-16 in. Another surprise came when
Ward Edmons, Cardinal pole-vaulter,
soared over the bar at 13 ft. 6 in. to
equal the mark he made in the 1.C.-4A.
meet last year and to set a new rec
ord for the Stanford track.
Spencer Runs Fast Quarter
Hopes of a close battle in the quar
ter-mile between Captain Bud Spen
cer of Stanford and Percy Niersbach,
former Trojan performer, faded when
Spencer and Morrison, his teammate,
proceeded to step out ahead of the !
rest of the field, the Cardinal skipper !
finishing first in the fast time of j
48 2-5 seconds. Larry Babcock, cap
tain of last year's Stanford champion- j
ship team, took third, with Niersbach j
fourth.
Johnny Lauritzen, speedy Cardinal i
sprinter, covered himself with glory '
when he sped to a second place in i
the furlong and a third in the century, j
