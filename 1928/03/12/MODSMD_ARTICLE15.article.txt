## Juniors Hold Second Place; Sophomore Athletes in Third Position FROSH GRID TEAM WEAK Yearlings Win Basketball; Contest For First in Track, Swimming

Leading by a whisker, but never
theless leading—such is the position
of the freshman class in the 1928 i»-
terclass tourney. The yearlings are
ahead of their nearest rival, the jun
iors, by but one point. Every class
has won a first place, but the 1931 ath
letes have garnered an ample supply
of second positions which are largely
responsible for their present lead.
Football proved to be the babes'
weakest sport. The worthy frosh
"varsity" went through the season
losing one more game than they won.
However, they did gain the distinction
of tying the winning senior eleven.
Basketball was the next sport on
the interclass schedule. Frosh teams
in both the first and second divisions
swamped all opposition and came
through the season undefeated.
"Very impressive" was the phrase
used by Coach "Dink" Templeton to
describe the record the freshmen
made in the annual interclass track
and field meet. The yearlings finished
second in this event as well as sec
ond in the Irish Marathon. Maynor
Shove ran away with the 440-yard run.
Hec Dyer demonstrated his ability in
the sprints by winning the 220-yard
dash as well as placing in the cen
tury.
Pressing the victorious sophomores
to the last race, the freshman pad
dlers nearly won another five points
for the class in the interclass swim
ming meet. Milt Burns romped away
with the breaststroke race in the fast
time of 1:15 flat.
Baseball games are now in prog
ress. The freshman aggregation is
making a strong bid for the cham
pionship in this sport and is so far
undefeated.
Tennis and soccer competition will
be run off next quarter.
