of their seven bouts with the Bears
at Berkeley Friday night In the first
match the two universities have
staged since 1922. In the feature bout
of the evening, Dan Frost, Stanford
welterweight, lost a questionable de
cision to Frank Ribbel, Bear captain,
after four rounds of fighting. The de
cision was unpopular with the crowd,
and for several minutes after it Was
given, Harmon Gymnasium resounded
with the boos and hisses of the 3500
persons present.
Coach Harry Maloney, when ques
tioned yesterday concerning (he fight,
said that it is his opinion that Frost
won the fight at the end of the sched
uled three rounds and need not have
fought the extra one. The judges,
however, called the first three rounds
a draw, making it necessary for the
two welters to fight anolher period.
Frost, who had been the aggressor
and had given his opponent a terrific
hammering during the first three
rounds, had expended all his energy
i and consequently lost the extra round,

| which the judges called the deciding
one. Frost was given a thunderous
hand as he climbed out of the ring,
j The two Stanford boxers who de-
I feated their opponents were Captain
Norman Fain, light-heavyweight, and
;Ed Dillon, heavyweight. Dillon drop
; ped his opponent four times with his
rangy lefts. Fain won by a technical
knockout in the third.
Homer Toberman was outboxed in
the middleweight class, but the judges
again wanted to see an extra round.
! Coach Maloney protested, but the
bout continued, with the result that
Toberman was knocked out for sev
, eral minutes.
