# And They Call Them "Babes"
## 
### 
Now that it is once again time for the Freshman edition to come
forth in its usual colorful greenery, we find it to be a good old custom to
editorialize. Freed for one short day from the constant cries of "Off
the dime with that story, frosh, you're not writing for posterity," from
night editors, desk assistants, and what not, we feel mightily moved to
endeavor to uplift upper classes, upper classmen, and worshippers of the
Golden Bear with something akin to an editorial.
On second thought, though, we see little reason for troubling our
selves and wearying faithful( ?) readers of the Daily in a boresome
and trite attempt to impart wisdom to those who are already all-knowing.
A mere enumeration of a few of the achievements of the Class of '31
should tend to have the desired uplifting efTect upon the great ones above
us (according to the Bawl-out), among whom are included the sopho
mores, juniors, and seniors, to do bigger and better things for their
alma mater.
Following are just a few of the accomplishments of the "Babes (we
wonder):
Victories over the California freshmen in football, basketball,
swimming, and water polo.
First place in interclass basketball.
Second place in interclass track.
Second in interclass swimming.
Third in interclass football.
To which we might add that the Freshmen are one and all "fine,
upstanding examples of America's mar-vel-ous young manhood and
womanhood."
Oh well, that's about enough on the Class of '31. By their deeds,
shall you know them. Accept and judge with not too "jaundiced and
malicious" an eye, O ye writers of campus opinions, the 1928 Freshman
Edition.
