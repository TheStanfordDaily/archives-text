# The 						Honor System, To Be Or Not To Be
## 
### 
To say that, the Honor System has been "running the gauntlet" in
recent months would be but a mild way of describing the storm of criti
cism through which it has been passing. Writer after writer has com
mented on the failure of the Honor System to come up to expectations.
Some lay the blame for the lack of respect by students in the system to
the "gradual dropping of traditions' ; others to the fact that it is a
system. However, the main basis for the disapprobation seems to be in
the idea that reporting violations is "tattling."
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, in an interview in another column of
this edition, is quoted as saying that this is a misconception retained from
childhood days. He goes on to say, "College men and women should be
able to assume the responsibility of governing themselves, and under the
present system that is just what they are doing. But self-government
involves discipline, and the failure to realize that you are actually the
one who is being cheated."
Apparently, university students, not only here but in educational in
stitutions throughout the country, have failed in this regard. 1 hey want
self-government but are unwilling to accept all of the responsibilities
necessarily entailed. They want the honor system and the feeling of self
respect that goes with its successful operation, but they are unwilling to
do their share to insure this success.
President Wilbur hit the nail on the head and hit it a resounding
whack when he declared, "No quarter for cheaters means no cheaters."
Which shall it be, a University governed under an honor system
respected and enforced by all the students, or a University governed
under an honor system respected by few and enforced by none?
