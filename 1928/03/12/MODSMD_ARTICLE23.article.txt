## CABBAGES AND THINGS ON THE OTHER HAND 
### Frederick Cromwell, '31 
I boxa on de boxing team,
If you know what I meana.
I keep my fighting spirit keen
By eating in Encina.
♦ * *
De little freshies aren't so meek
When after bread and beana;
I stretch my reach an inch a week
By eating in Encina.
• * *
So every day I train and eat
And I grow lean and leana.
I am a lightweight none can beat
From eating in Encina!

We can get a whole front page;
And, reforming, still have with us
Gold for justice's duo wage.

"I heard," said Wise Willie, flicking
his cigaret lighter away as ho used
to do with matches in their time,

| "that they had established a course
'in Plumbing. Must be quite a pipe
i course. But then, I don't believe in
; this new-fangled curriculum; a friend
! of mine took up aviation, and he got
! an overdose of it the first thing, even
though he only took one little drop
j in a whole lot of water."

Bawlouts are
great inventions;
the work is ended but
the memory lingers on.

Dear Ed:
Stanford has no community chest!
Why not start one to be used for
slush funds in future king elections?
It would give the polly-sigh men a
greater chance to practice corruption.
And may I ask a question—are the
girls to come to the masque ball
masked? I must know beforehand so
I won't pull any boners.
—I. W. Fellow.

You know, Eucina isn't such a bad
place after all. We were down at a

firey spiritual revival last night and
they told us all about HELL.

Yes, he learned in the army. An

Another pavilion concert. Picture
