## MUSIC MAGIC 
### 
Sceintists were recently elated over
the invention of a device which will
play music representing orchestra in
struments in response to passing the
hands over electric keys. This is a ,
remarkable thing, but would it be any
more impressive than to see Alfred
Hertz lead his San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra? Here is a bald
headed, bearded, German cripple pick-1
ing music out of the air by merely I
waving his hands; first drawing on the
violins, the brass, or drums, then
bringing out a few notes from the
flute —all in perfect accord and equal
balance.
An orchestra leader epitomizes ex
pression, in that he unites the effort
if each musician into a grand concert
which seems to follow the whim of the
'eader's movements. And after all,
music, like any art, is merely satisfac
■ ory expression of the emotions. We |
listen to the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra, or gaze enraptured at the
rhythm of Pa\Jowa's dancing, or stand
in awe before the Taj Mahal for the
reason that they satisfy feelings in
ourselves which we cannot understand.
The orchestra is one of the oldest,
and probably the most pleasing type ol'
music to listen to. The strain of
watching one individual performer, as
in a piano recital, is relieved by the
presence of fifty or sixty musicians
on the stage, and the audience gets
variation in sight as well as in sound.
Ancient Harmony
History records show that the first
Lo obtain orchestral effects were the
Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, and
Phoenicians, who combined harps,
guitars, pipes and drums, playing in
unison or in octaves. The Fourth

abasement of instrumental music,
when it was placed under a ban by
when it was placed under a ban by the
Chut'cli; it was preserved from abso
lute extinction only by wandering mu
sicians. Instrumental music was for
centuries dependent on outcasts and
outlaws, tolerated by the Church and
State but beyond the pale. Neverthe
less, the innate love and yearning of
the people for tone-color asserted itself
wits sufficient strength to overcome
such obstacles, even in the Four
teenth Century, when an orchestra
consisted of bagpipes, hurdy-gurdies,
and an organ.
With the forming of a musical
guild in 12S8, the status of the art rose'
and in England, in the next century,
John the Gaunt was chosen King of
the Minstrels.
Orchestras a Luxury
At first the orchestra was an aris
tocratic luxury, performing privately
at the courts of Italian nobles; by
the beginning of th Eighteenth Cen
tury most German princes had good
private orchestras or "Kapelle."
Haydn, whose Symphonie Concert
ante was played at the Memorial
Church by the Symphony Orchestra
Friday night, was the father of the
modern orchestra, and the first to
treat it independently as a power op
posed to the solo chorus.
Nothing could be more fitting or
satisfactory for the Founders' Day
exercises than such a concert of
sacred music, and no orchestra is
better qualified than the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, under
Hertz's direction. We hereby send
up a prayer that Hertz may never
get an attack of rheumatism.

Nothing could be more fitting or
satisfactory for the Founders' Day
exercises than such a concert of
sacred music, and no orchestra is

Sceintists were recently elated over
the invention of a device which will
play music representing orchestra in
struments in response to passing the
hands over electric keys. This is a ,
remarkable thing, but would it be any
more impressive than to see Alfred
Hertz lead his San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra? Here is a bald
headed, bearded, German cripple pick-1
ing music out of the air by merely I
waving his hands; first drawing on the
violins, the brass, or drums, then
bringing out a few notes from the
flute —all in perfect accord and equal
balance.
An orchestra leader epitomizes ex
pression, in that he unites the effort
if each musician into a grand concert
which seems to follow the whim of the
'eader's movements. And after all,
music, like any art, is merely satisfac
■ ory expression of the emotions. We |
listen to the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra, or gaze enraptured at the
rhythm of Pa\Jowa's dancing, or stand
in awe before the Taj Mahal for the
reason that they satisfy feelings in
ourselves which we cannot understand.
The orchestra is one of the oldest,
and probably the most pleasing type ol'
music to listen to. The strain of
watching one individual performer, as
in a piano recital, is relieved by the
presence of fifty or sixty musicians
on the stage, and the audience gets
variation in sight as well as in sound.
Ancient Harmony
History records show that the first
Lo obtain orchestral effects were the
Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, and
Phoenicians, who combined harps,
guitars, pipes and drums, playing in
unison or in octaves. The Fourth

abasement of instrumental music,
when it was placed under a ban by
when it was placed under a ban by the
Chut'cli; it was preserved from abso
lute extinction only by wandering mu
sicians. Instrumental music was for
centuries dependent on outcasts and
outlaws, tolerated by the Church and
State but beyond the pale. Neverthe
less, the innate love and yearning of
the people for tone-color asserted itself
wits sufficient strength to overcome
such obstacles, even in the Four
teenth Century, when an orchestra
consisted of bagpipes, hurdy-gurdies,
and an organ.
With the forming of a musical
guild in 12S8, the status of the art rose'
and in England, in the next century,
John the Gaunt was chosen King of
the Minstrels.
Orchestras a Luxury
At first the orchestra was an aris
tocratic luxury, performing privately
at the courts of Italian nobles; by
the beginning of th Eighteenth Cen
tury most German princes had good
private orchestras or "Kapelle."
Haydn, whose Symphonie Concert
ante was played at the Memorial
Church by the Symphony Orchestra
Friday night, was the father of the
modern orchestra, and the first to
