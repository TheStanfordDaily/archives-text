"Muster all your feeble intelligence,
degenerate offsprings of imbecility,
learn and obey these sovereign com
i mands -of your masters, the Regal
i Sophomores. Warts! Pimples! Shud
-1 der at the thought of your reception
at liume when father has to pay the
collect charges on your corpse! And
a maggoty one, at that."
Time was, O Frosh, when your very
| right to existence was questioned by
the mighty sophomores, if a warning
! posted in the boat house on Lagunita
| in days gone by may be trusted. With
these awe-inspiring words was the
freshman of old humbled:
"Frosh! Tin trinkets are unneces
\ sary in classifying you at the foot of
i the animal scale. Leave them in the
| slime and ooze of your filthy origin,
'or be returned with them. Ditto for
! whatever Hirsute tokens of shame
! still cling to your upper lips. Pools!
I Who cares that you made the twid
dledy-wink varsity in high school?
"His fragments will be strewn for
miles who holds not the Law Steps,
i seniors' bench, and all upper-class
j men's haunts saered. Vermin such as
| get cocky have premiums on their ex
i termination. The 'hello' privilege is
; one of the few evidences of Stanford
! allowed you. The women are one of
the privileges (?) disallowed you.
! Frails are not for Frosh.
"Key down your vocal chords, pull
in your necks, glue them in and nail
; a dink over your lamps, or become an
j active member in the Order of the
: Blister. You may smoke in Hell, but
don't try it on the Quad. Unless you
.
S are equipped with cast iron seating
| capacity, shun the cig."
Since evidences of such persecution
! are no longer to be seen, it must mean
1 that the viewpoint of our "elders"
i has changed. At last the ability,
: worth, and value of the freshmen are
admitted by all; tyranny has been
overthrown and the world is as it
I should be.
