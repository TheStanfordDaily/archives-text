# Hertz S.F. Symphony Orchestra Impressive In Memorial Concert
## 
### 
An impressive concert in the Me
morial Church of beautiful sacred
music played by the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra, under the di
rection of Alfred Hertz, featured the
celebration of Founders' Day at Stan
ford last Friday.
The Memorial Church, decorated
with flowers and greenery, was Ailed
to capacity. The Senior Class at
tended in a body.
Symphony No. 2, in D Major, by
Brahms, was the first number. Com
i monly known as "Pastoral," this piece
j impressed the listener as having a
; spontaneous flow, a lack of effort, a
j natural freshness that gave the whole
j work a special serenity of mood. The
next number, Haydn's Concertante,
| was notable for the solo work of
Mishel Piasjtro, C. Addimando, Michel
Penha, and E. Kubitschek, playing the
violin, oboe, 'cello, and bassoon. This
eighteenth century work afforded un
usual opportunity for use of the
bassoon in a solo part.
Hertz chose Wagner's Prelude to
"Parsifal" as the final number, and
inspired his audience by a fine rendi
tion of this masterpiece of music. The
violins interpreted the lament of lov
ing compassion, the brass was used
with powerful brilliance in elevated
parts, and the flutes furnished con
trast in the final compassion of lov
ing agony which this piece represents
with wonderful feeling and sympathy.
1931
