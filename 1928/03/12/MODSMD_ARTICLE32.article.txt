# FRESHMAN ATHLETES DISCLOSE ABILITY IN MURAL TOURNAMENTS
## 
### 
Outstanding freshman athletic
ability has been shown by the out
come of the four intramural tourna
ments that have been finished. One
was won by a freshman, another was
won through the ability of a 1931
man, and in the other the freshman
team was eliminated in the semi
final round.
John B. Sauter, freshman, won the
intramural handball tournament by a
large margin, winning all his matches
by straight games. In an exhibition
match against one of the best of the
University of California players last
night, he defeated his opponent.
The Intramural track meet, which
was run off last quarter, was won by
the Breakers Club. The points made
by Les Hables, ex-freshman track
star, was more than enough to win
the meet alone. He took three firsts
and offset a 25-foot lead to win the
relay. Second place in the meet was
won by Encina 3W, a team entirely
made up of freshmen.
Twelve freshman teams competed
in the intramural basketball tourna
ment. Two teams won their league
championships and advanced to the
semi-finals of the tournament. Both
were defeated at this stage not by
more superior or harder-lighting
teams, but by lucky breaks of the
game.
In the intramural tennis tourna
ment the freshman entrants made
good showings. In the advance tour
nament two freshmen from Encina
Basement advanced to the semi-finals,
where they were defeated. In the
consolation tournament, another
frosh team from Encina Basement
won the finals.
