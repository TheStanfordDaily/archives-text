# LOOMIS HURLS FIVE HITLESS INNINGS AS FROSH DOWN MISSION
## 
### 
Vard Loomis, a new recruit on the |
freshman pitching staff, surprised j
everyone, including himself, by pitch- j
ing a perfect no-hit, no-run game for j
five innings against the Mission High ,
School team Saturday to aid materi
ally in a Cardinal victory over the
prepmen by the score of 9-2. Loomis
was relieved by Don Story at the be
ginning of the sixth period, who al
lowed the Mission nine to collect two
hits and two runs in two innings.
Loomis retired ten men single-:
handed, and while he was on the
pitcher's mound no opposing player 1
reached first base. Story struck out |
four men and walked two. Neither;
Clancy nor McShane, the high school j
pitchers, offered much opposition to !
the yearling batsmen.
Stanford collected six of her runs I
in the second inning. Teague started
the inning by knocking a long fly ■
into center field. Hardy came |
through with his customary drive
into left field. Captain Hunken rapped j
out a fine hit along the third base |
line to complete the hitting for the ,
period. Another Cardinal score was
made in <lie third period when Wit-;
tenau singled to score Allen. The j
other two runs were made in the
fourth inning but were largely due to |
errors on the part of the Mission
team.
Loomis, Teague and Allen were the >
most consistent of the babe hitters, i
Allen exhibited some clever base run
ning and stole two bases. Summary:

Vard Loomis, a new recruit on the |
freshman pitching staff, surprised j
everyone, including himself, by pitch- j
ing a perfect no-hit, no-run game for j
five innings against the Mission High ,
School team Saturday to aid materi
ally in a Cardinal victory over the
prepmen by the score of 9-2. Loomis
was relieved by Don Story at the be
ginning of the sixth period, who al
lowed the Mission nine to collect two
hits and two runs in two innings.
Loomis retired ten men single-:
handed, and while he was on the
pitcher's mound no opposing player 1
reached first base. Story struck out |
four men and walked two. Neither;
Clancy nor McShane, the high school j
pitchers, offered much opposition to !
the yearling batsmen.
Stanford collected six of her runs I
in the second inning. Teague started
the inning by knocking a long fly ■
into center field. Hardy came |
through with his customary drive
into left field. Captain Hunken rapped j
out a fine hit along the third base |
line to complete the hitting for the ,
period. Another Cardinal score was
made in <lie third period when Wit-;
tenau singled to score Allen. The j
other two runs were made in the
fourth inning but were largely due to |
errors on the part of the Mission
team.
Loomis, Teague and Allen were the >
most consistent of the babe hitters, i
Allen exhibited some clever base run
ning and stole two bases. Summary:
