# VARSITY NINE TAKES THIRD GAME IN CARD-GAEL SERIES
## 
### John B. Isaacs, '31 
Bunching their hits in the third
and fifth innings, Coach Harry Wol
ter's charges swamped the St. Mary's
baseball men Saturday afternoon by
a 11-1 score to win for the first time
in four years a Cardinal-Gael series.
Bob Sims, Stanford right fielder, was
the hero of the day, hammering out
a triple and two singles in five trips
to the plate.
The St. Mary's batsmen never real
ly threatened the Cardinal defense
until the eighth inning when Kern
allowed Bill and Doiulero a hit each
and walked Bettencourt. This filled
the bases with no outs. At this point
Coach Wolter substituted Bob Philippi
for Kern. Philippi pulled himself out
of the hole nobly, striking out the
next two men to oppose him. Kaspero
wicz managed to squeeze out a short
outfield hit which scored Bill. Betten
court was thrown out at the plate
when he tried to follow Bill home.
Kern Allows But Four Hits
Kern pitched a good even game
until the eighth period. Previous to

that time the Gaels had only collected
four hits from him. Hamilton, who
pitched the first five innings for St.
Mary's, had very little on the ball
and should rave been removed after
the disastrous third inning.
Johnny Levin did not have the
chance to demonstrate his customary
hitting ability. He sacrificed on his
first trip to bat and was walked the
second time. He did get a nice single
into right field in the fifth inning.
The Irish were powerless to make
anything of their last trip at bat in
the ninth period. Conlan and Smith
flied out to Levin and Rooney knocked
a weak pop-fly to Garibaldi.

Kern pitched a good even game
until the eighth period. Previous to

The Irish were powerless to make
