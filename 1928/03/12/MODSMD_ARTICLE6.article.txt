# Dirtiness of Mudfight Makes Judges Puzzle
## 
### 
That the class of 1931 is a
rough bunch in the eyes of the
Ex Committee has been proved
this quarter. Gone are the days
when the innocent frosh class
could sling mud, anil knockout
and drown the soph class in a
slimy and suspicious-looking sea
of black. The days of the tie-up
are back again, so that no longer
will the soph class have to de
pend on the dictations of tradi
tion to acquire the title of the
victor.
It seemed so incongruous that
the puny class of 1930 should de
clare a victory over the massive
class of 1931 that tongues com
menced to wag after the Lagu
nita mud-fest last quarter, and
finally the Ex Committee was
forced to come to the decision
that the victors could be more
easily judged if the actual vic
tims could be neatly tied down
and counted.
