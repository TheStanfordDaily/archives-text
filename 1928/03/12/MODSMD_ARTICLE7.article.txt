# Students Fail To Fight For Rights, Contends Wilbur
## Violations of Honor System Allowed to Pass, Says Stanford Leader 
### William H. Grace, '31 
"Successful operation of the Honor
| System at Stanford depends wholly
on the students' attitude," says Presi
dent Kay Lyman Wilbur. "They must
1 drop the idea that reporting viola
i tions is 'telling the teacher'. That is
i a misconception retained from child
; hood days.
"College men and women should be
able to assume the responsibility of
governing themselves, and under the
present system that is just what they
are doing. But self-government in-
I volves discipline, and the failure to
take the responsibilities of a citizen
is the failure to realize that you are
• actually the one who is being cheated.
Play the Game Squarely
"There is not a man on the campus
I who would sit in a card game and
allow himself to be cheated. Yet,
when you are on the borderline be
tween passing or failing in a course,
a student using unfair methods will
! raise the average enough to flunk you.
With a very expensive education at
j stake, it no longer is a matter of 'tell
ing the teacher'. It is a case of play
; ing the game like a man, and stand
; ing up for your rights.
"Freshmen especially, as the com
ing class, should realize that they
! must either develop the atmosphere
1 which enforces an Honor System or
receive an unclean diploma.

"As to reporting violations, it is a
matter of procedure. The students
I can deal directly with the violator
himself. If he is told by a student or
group of students that cheating does
i not GO at Stanford and that he must
i leave if he cheats, the cheater will
; know that it simply 'isn't done'. Liv
i ing groups can very effectively stop
j dishonesty by discarding the cheaters
