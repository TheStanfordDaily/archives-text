# Students Fail To Fight For Rights, Contends Wilbur
## Violations of Honor System Allowed to Pass, Says Stanford Leader 
### William H. Grace, '31 
"Successful operation of the Honor
| System at Stanford depends wholly
on the students' attitude," says Presi
dent Kay Lyman Wilbur. "They must
1 drop the idea that reporting viola
i tions is 'telling the teacher'. That is
i a misconception retained from child
; hood days.
"College men and women should be
able to assume the responsibility of
governing themselves, and under the
present system that is just what they
are doing. But self-government in-
I volves discipline, and the failure to
take the responsibilities of a citizen
is the failure to realize that you are
• actually the one who is being cheated.
Play the Game Squarely
"There is not a man on the campus
I who would sit in a card game and
allow himself to be cheated. Yet,
when you are on the borderline be
tween passing or failing in a course,
a student using unfair methods will
! raise the average enough to flunk you.
With a very expensive education at
j stake, it no longer is a matter of 'tell
ing the teacher'. It is a case of play
; ing the game like a man, and stand
; ing up for your rights.
"Freshmen especially, as the com
ing class, should realize that they
! must either develop the atmosphere
1 which enforces an Honor System or
receive an unclean diploma.
See the Man
"As to reporting violations, it is a
matter of procedure. The students
I can deal directly with the violator
himself. If he is told by a student or
group of students that cheating does
i not GO at Stanford and that he must
i leave if he cheats, the cheater will
; know that it simply 'isn't done'. Liv
i ing groups can very effectively stop
j dishonesty by discarding the cheaters
from their midst. Such measures as
these serve the aims of self-govern
ment without involving the unpleasant
necessity of expulsion by the Univer
sity. After all, it is the students, not
the faculty, who suffer from hishon
esty. The idea is to stop cheating; it
does not matter whether it is accom
plished by the Men's Council, or by
individual effort, or by both combined.
No Quarter for Cheaters
"We want Stanford men and women
to receive clean diplomas. Any rec
ord of looseness in examinations dis
counts the face value of the diploma
by the amount of dishonesty which is
thought to go on. If students will
not become a part of the Honor Sys
tem it is a failure, and the answer to
failure is change. Elimination is the
only punishment which really works.
No quarter for the cheaters —means
no cheaters.
"The situation varies with different
years. At present, I should say that
it is somewhat loose in some classes of
the University; but I see no present
reason why the Honor System should
ever be voted out here as it has been
in some other places. Certainly in a
university of Stanford's size, with its
home campus, its selected students,
its general acquaintance, there is no
reason except moral flabbiness which
should keep the honor system from be
ing at its best. We ought to make it
possible to have every man and
woman with a Stanford diploma feel
that it was honorably won by honor
able work, and the public and alumni
ought to be able to feel that anyone
with a diploma from Stanford is de
pendable and honest and has lived
up to and believed in our Honor Sys
tem."
