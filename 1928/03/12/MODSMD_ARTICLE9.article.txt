### 
By winning four out of the five
sport events in which they have par
ticipated with the California babes so
far this year, the class of 1931 has
undoubtedly proved itself to be one of
; the most athletic that has graced the
i Stanford Farm for many a year.
After losing to U. S. C., St. Mary's
! and Santa Clara, the freshman foot
| ball team showed the remarkable
i ability that it had so cleverly guarded
all season by walloping the Bear Cubs
j to the tune of 25-7 with the odds 4 to 1
| against them, thus adding weight to
] the pockets of every loyal Cardinal
rooter.

the California yearlings sneaked off
with victory, winning 2-1 in the first
1 game and tieing the second at 1-all.
The 1931 basketball team broke the
jinx that has been following Stanford
freshmen during the last few years by
i going through its preliminary games
undefeated and capturing the Cali
fornia series in three thrilling clashes,
24-22, 22-30 and 29-27.
In the water polo meet the Cardi
nal babes splashed their way around,
under and over tliei;' Blue and Gold
rivals to win, 12 to 0, using two men
that had not played with the team up
to two weeks before the meet.
The 1931 mermen defeated the Cali
fornia freshmen 50 to 12 in the annual
