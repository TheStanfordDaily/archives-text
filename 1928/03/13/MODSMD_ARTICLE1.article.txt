### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Mar. 12. —
(U.P.) —Chairman William M. Butler of
the Republican National Committee is
not yet ready to concede that the Repub
lican National Committee should return
the money contributed by Harry F. Sin
clair, the Teapot Dome oil man.

"As I see it, the obligation, if any, for
restitution is upon those who conducted
the transaction," Butler said in a letter
to Senator Borah, who had proposed to
him that the Sinclair money collected by
Will Hays, former chairman, be returned
in the light of recent developments.

Butler said that later, if the Senate
committee agrees with Borah's conclu
sion, sympathetic attention will be given
to the proposal.

Borah replied that while the transac
tion occurred before Butler became chair
man, so that there was no personal re
sponsibility, the party as a party could
not escape its responsibilities simply be
cause there had been a change of chair
manship.
Borah gave warning to Butler that he
•did not propose to let the matter rest.
Butler's reply to Borah's original pro
posal follows:
"Your letter of March 5 I have re
ceived. Whatever the transactions were,
they were done and completed long be
fore my election as chairman of the Re
publican National Committee.
"During the period of my incumbency
-of the office of chairman, I did not, nor
did the committee or party, receive the
securities or the money and never had
them.
"As I sec it, the obligation, if any, for
restitution is upon those who conducted
the transactions.
"First of all, I want to make this
•clear.
"However, the hearing has not been
concluded, and I do not propose to pre
judge the case. If it appears that the
conclusion to which you have arrived is
borne out by the finding of the commit
tee, I will give sympathetic attention to
your proposal."
