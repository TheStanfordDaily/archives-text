## 
### 
Stanford swimmers took a first,
second, and third place in the P.A.A.
junior chan>pionsliip held at the
Olympic Club Sunday night, and three
divers placed in the Junior National
Diving Championship.
Hadley Bramel won the 500-yard
swim in the time of 6:24 flat, and
gained such a lead that he nearly
lapped the field at the finish. In the
150-yard backstroke race, Hobday, a
former Stanford freshman who will
return next fall, took first place,
Ogden Driggs ran him a dose second,
and Sandy Smith was third. The time
was 1:48 3-5.
Payne Theabaut, of Palo Alto, won
the junior national diving title. Mills,
Throndson, and Marsh of Stanford
were so closely judged for second
honors that it was necessary to count
points on the score card. Mills was
decided as second best, with Thrond
son third. Marsh's showing was re
markably good, considering bis inex
perience, as he came out ahead of the
best divers in San Francisco.
