# BABE TEAM PREPARES TO MEET CITY TRACK MEN HERE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Dink Templeton's freshman track squad
resumed practice yesterday to prepare for
the meet here with the San Francisco
high schools all-star team Saturday,
which is the final contest before vacation.
On the following Saturday teams from
the Sacramento Junior College and San
Jose State Teachers College will attempt
to down the yearling squad.

With Burt DeGroot back on the team
Saturday, the yearlings should win first,
second, and a possible third in the pole
vault. DeGroot has done over 12 feet in
last-year meets. Results in the broad
jump last week showed great possibilities
for the freshman team. With three men
all doing over 22 feet, a clean sweep in
that event is almost cinched.
If Templeton continues to use Hec
Dyer in the hurdles, a first in the lows
is almost assured. Smith and Austin will
take care of the other hurdle event.
Shove's 50 4-5 time in the 440 was
another record for early season compe
tition.
