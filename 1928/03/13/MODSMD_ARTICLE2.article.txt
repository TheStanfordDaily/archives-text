### 
OATMAN, Ariz., Mar. 12.—(U.P.)—
The small mining town of Oatman .
turned out its 200 population and many i
visitors today to welcome Arthur New
ton, the sturdy citizen of Rhodesia, as he
crossed the winner's line in the ninth lap |
of C. C. Pyle's marathon here today. ,
The town crier, and Oatman is one ,
of the few towns in the world to boast of ;
such an individual, bellowed forth the ,
news as Newton came in ahead of the
pack to win the last three out of four
laps in the Los Angeles to New York
stroll.
Following the Rhodesian, who made
the seventeen-mile lap from Needles in
4:43:30, was Eddie Gardner, Portland
negro, David Davies of Canada was
third, Nester Ericksen, fourth, and Peter
Gavuzzi, fifth.
Oatman, perched on the side of the
Black Mountain range, furnished a pic
turesque setting for the ninth lap finish.
