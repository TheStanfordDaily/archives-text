## 
### 
Comparative inactivity in the vot
ing for the Royal Ruler of the king
dom of Stanford characterized the
political campaign yesterday. Enthu
siastic party leaders, however, predict
heavy voting today in spite of the
prospect of slight rains. Rainy weath
er will be an added incentive to parti
sans of the "Wet-Rain" dynasty, and
"Flower" Potts will profit by a little
added moisture.
Voting will be continued from 8 to
12 o'clock at the Rally Committee
Headquarters today. By special ar
rangement with the Rally Committee
(he campaign managers and financial
interests have agreed to an extension

"Four-Foot Rule" Adams is leading
the race to the throne. Adams is a
wheat king from the broad, flat plains
of Woodland, California.
An effort to secure promises from
the royal candidates on the important
political question of Farm relief was
unsuccessful late last night as only
two of the candidates were willing to
reveal their secret plans and prom
ises on the aforesaid question. No
blesse oblige was the program advo
cated by a royal candidate to his con
stituents.
Spread-eagle oratory, parades, flow
er pots, and tiny red sprinkling cans
have been the principal features of
the campaign so far. Today the cam
paign managers will sit back and
hope they will be made prime minis
ters under the ruling dynasty.
The momentous question will be
soon settled. King Carnival will rule
and reign with the lady of his choice,
aided by the official sanction of the
Rally Committee at his side.
