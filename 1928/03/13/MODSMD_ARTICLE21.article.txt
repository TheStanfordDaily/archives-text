times greater than the one Saturday j
which is believed to have taken 120 lives,
was threatened today.
As a precautionary measure, the police ;
have ordered the inhabitants of all houses
in the danger zone to evacuate.
There were occasional minor slides to-!
day, increasing the danger of a great,
landslide from the other part of the main
hill. The destructive slide Saturday un
loosed 500,000 cubic yards of rock and
soil, smashing part of a hospital and
many dwellings.
Only 43 bodies have been recognized
so far. It wa ssaid today that reports of j
the number of bodies recovered from the
debris had been greatly exaggerated be-;
cause of the confusion of morgue and.
cemetery officials, and the duplication of
names.

before all the dead can be removed from
the twisted wreckage, the United Press
correspondent estimated tonight that the !
death toll would be approximately 120. j
Earlier reports had placed the number of i
deaths at between 150 and 200.
