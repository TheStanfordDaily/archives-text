# ARCHAEOLOGISTS STUDY IRRIGATION CANALS OF OLD RACE IN ARIZONA

PHOENIX, Ariz., March 12— (U.P.)
—An ancient race, so proficient at the
art of irrigation that approximately
100,000 acres of the Salt River Valley
were watered, is now being studied
by Arizona archaeologists. These peo
ple of 500 to 1000 years ago have been
named the Canal Builders.
They built long irrigation canals
and laterals, and in consideration of
the massive machinery modern man
uses in similar enterprises, their en
gineering feats are regarded as re
markable by Dr. O. A. Turney of
Plioenix.
Traces of the people themselves
have been obliterated almost com
pletely, it is said. They died, the
archaeologists believe, from some
mysterious plague or a prolonged
drought which their irrigation and
ingenuity were unable to conquer.
