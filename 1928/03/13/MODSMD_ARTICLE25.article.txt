GALSHOT, England, Mar. 12. —
(U.P.) — While trying to regain the
world's speed record for Great Britain
by flying faster than five miles a minute,
I Lieutenant S. M. Kinkead was killed to
jday when his plane nose-dived at ter
| rific speed into the English Channel.
Kinkead, a member of the British team
j which competed in the Schneider Cup
| seaplane races at Venice September 26,
1927, used a machine which had been
(confidently expected to attain a speed of
' 1310 to 320 miles an hour.
| Spectators said the plane dived almost
perpendicularly from a height of 400 feet
J j between Galshot airdrome, near South
ampton, and the Isle of Wight. The
I plane caused a big waterspout as it
! plunged into the sea at 5:25 p.m.
Kinkead was trying to break the 302-
' mile-an-liour record set by Major De
„ I Bernardi of Italy, after the Schncider
> ! Cup race. The Italian flyer had broken
7 the mark of 281.433 miles an hour in
j that race by Lieutenant S. N. Webster of
j Great Britain. Lieutenant Kinkead, a
, Schneider Cup entrant, had to retire on
1 the sixth lap of the race bccause his
propeller spinner started to burst.
I The Briton started his flight today in
Lia mist which prevented onlookers from
I seeing the machine until it was suddenly
j : noticed flying low, at seemingly great
a speed, over the channel. Suddenly it nose
, | dived into the water.
