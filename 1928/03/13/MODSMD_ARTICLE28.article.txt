# We're All for Him

The Stanford Hoover Club was officially organized last week, and is
starting work on its campaign for Herbert Hoover's election. Certainly
this is the place for such a group to be formed. It is the first time an alum
nus has been in a position to gain the Presidency of the United States, and
it is a privilege to do all we can toward putting Hoover into office. It is
gratifying that the University is now getting to the age where its men
are taking part in governing the country.
Merely because he is a graduate of Stanford is not a good reason for
supporting Hoover, but when we consider the work he has done as Secre
tary of Commerce, and his various humanitarian activities, it must be seen
that the country as a whole would benefit by having so practical and well
equipped a man for President. Not often in the history of the nation have
we had availably for the White House job a man so able.
Part of the Stanford club's work will be to start a "round-robin''
letter to all of the principal colleges in the country enlisting support for
Hoover. It is felt, since many ballots at various colleges have favored him,
that the students in great majority will favor such a move. This letter will
have affixed the names of student body presidents and other prominent
campus people, and will be issued through the press to the voting public.
It will be an expression of opinion from college students, and is the
sort of thing that should be done more often. People are looking to the
colleges for many things these days, political as well as others, so they
should be informed as to the views students have.
