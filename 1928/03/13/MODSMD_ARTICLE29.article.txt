The University often is charged with being conservative beyond tolera
tion by impatient youth, but it cannot be said to stifle liberal thought nor
to prevent the modern idea from being expressed. For example, Dr. Gard
ner, University chaplain, is now and then complained of as having too
anachronistic a point of view. Yet many times during the year preachers
of known liberal opinions, so cherished by university students, hold forth
in the pulpit of the Memorial Church.
Of the latter type of preachers is Maude Royden, the British evangel
ist. who is to deliver the Memorial Church sermon next Sunday morning.
Miss Royden has been refused the pulpit in many American churches;
so her appearance here will be a sort of vindication for short-sightedness
elsewhere.
"We won't bring young people back to religion until we make it
positive," Miss Royden says. "They have drifted away from the church
because they are tired of being told what not to do.'"
She is a believer in the unheard-of idea of substituting qualified "thou
shalts" in place of peremptory "thou shalt nots" as a guide to the
young.
"Thou shalt smoke if and as you deem best," she believes.
"Thou shalt drink whatever you wish, provided you consider your own
good in so doing.
"Thou shalt flirt if you see no reason why you shouldn't.
"Thou shalt enjoy theaters, dances, and other forms of entertainment
so long as you are truly entertained."
Such commandments will readily be taken up, but whether following
them will bring young people back to religion remains to be proved by
Miss Royden.
The Daily staff will meet today at the usual time and place.
