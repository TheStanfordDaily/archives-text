LET'S GROW UP
It must be nice to be a great, big,
grown-up race, like the kind they
grow in Europe. America is so young
—and all the writers in Europe know
1 it. Somebody should manufacture
some national whiskers, behind which
we might masquerade ourselves into
dignity and ponderous maturity, even
as our contemporaries across the
seas.
The very latest tear to fall for our
youth comes from Arnaldo Mussolini,
brother of the famous premier. Ar
naldo, speaking in Milan last Thurs
day, was unable to resist the now
ancient European weakness of trying
i to be funny at Uncle Sam's expense.
Said the great Mussolini:
Golden Youth
"Gold is a formidable force and
when it is found at the disposal of a
young race we must always expect
surprises. Moreover we must not for
get that in a short time the Ameri
cans intend to pursue a grandiose
policy of their own."
Europe has a positive complex
about our money. The mere fact that
European writers are forever harp
ing on the subject of gold, betrays the
value they set upon it. Before the
war the money bags were stacked in
London, Paris, and Berlin, and Eu
rope didn't feel at all badly about
the fact. Came the war, and the
money bags sailed westward. Then
the howl. Europe at times reminds us
of a spoiled child eating a cake and
wanting it. It had to have a big war
i
j and use up all its gold, and now must
[ sit by and grumble. War and grum
bling—prized virtues of the older
[ races!
More Bayonet Visions
Mussolini told his compatriots that
possession of gold was not only a
stroke of good fortune but also a re
sponsibility. "Woe unto us," he said,
"if a people of such fabulous riches
were dominated by a universal idea.
The force of bayonets would find a
means to defend it and impose it on
the whole world. Up to now America
is only a mass of reinforced concrete;
she lacks the leaven of history.
Nobler in its traditions and stronger
in its conception is the English im
perial formation."
There, there, Mr. Mussolini, don't
make us feel so badly. What if we did
choose to burn up our money in a
war? We would only be following the
silly example set by your Europe.
And after studying Chinese history
we aren't so sure about the nobility
of England.

Our national faults, we admit, are
many, but somehow this youth of
ours to which the Europeans refer so
contemptuously, can't be much worse
than the vaunted old-age of Europe.
We hope, furthermore, that America,
when it does come of age, will repre
sent something more noble and use
ful to humanity than do some of the
contemporary examples of mature
races. —Jack Springer.
