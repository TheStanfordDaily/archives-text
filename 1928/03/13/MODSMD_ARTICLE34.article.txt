MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,
New York, March 12.—(U.P.) — Johnny
Risko of Cleveland spoiled all Jack
| Sharkey's heavyweight championship
| dreams tonight by winning the judge's
decision over the Bostonian in fifteen
rounds of indifferent fighting. The for
mer baker boy, who always has been a
stumbling block in the heavyweight di
vision, carried the fight to Sharkey from
the opening bell, and what Johnny lacked
; in boxing skill and clean hitting, he made
j up in aggressiveness and persistence.
The outcome of the fight, in which
Sharkey was a 3 to 1 favorite, all but
ruined Tex Rickard's plans for a heavy
weight championship in June, for only
a decisive victory for the Bostonian
I could have saved the situation.
