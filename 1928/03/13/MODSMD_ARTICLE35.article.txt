RE TRACK, WOULD SAY—
The inarticulate freshmen failed to
say much yesterday about the track
team's notable exhibition against the
L.A.A.C Their green oasis was filled
with the reports of their own not un
impressive record in sports during
the year. But the varsity hit a level
of accomplishment last Saturday
which gives joy to those who like to
figure the team's chances to repeat
this year at Harvard its 1927 victory
in the 1.C.-4A. track and field cham
pionships.
Ward Edmonds, for example,
squirmed over the 13-foot 6-inch
height in the pole vault. That was
his height in the nationals last
May. This is March. Dink Temple
ton thinks he ought to break the
world's record of 14 feet 1 inch
before he is through. Will Ed
monds do so this year? His per
formance shows he has a good
chance.
Take Bud Spencer, or rather, try
and "take" him. If anyone in the con
ference "takes" him in the quarter it
will be a marvel. Bud ought to win
the quarter in the 1.C.-4A. Even if he
does, he probably will be far from the
only Stanford first-place winner. Fred
Zombro is a first-rate possibility to
cinch the broad jump; Dyer ought to
take second in this; Krenz ought to
win the discus throw and possibly the
shot; Edmonds should take the pole
vault; Nichols might well win the
high hurdles; King is the logical
choice to win the high jump.

Look them over; watch them prac
tice daily on the old oval. This year's
appears the strongest Stanford has
had, at least in its wealth of indi
vidual stars, and since this is Olym
pic Games year, the best records can
be expected to be made.
