# PERSONNEL DIRECTOR GIVES REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIVERSITY MEN
## Important Factors Include Co-operation, Control, Tact, Leadership 
### 
Important factors to be taken into con
sideration in employing a college man in
business, according to E. G. McCann,
personnel director of the Pacific Gas and
Electric Company, are: Does he enjoy
contact with people? Is he tactful? Can
he co-operate? Has lie self-control? Is
lie, or will he be, a leader?
McCann spoke before a conference ar
ranged by Dr. E. K. Strong, Jr., of the
Graduate School of business, held re
cently in San Francisco. A large num
ber of prominent business men and col
lege officials, as well as students, attended
the conference.
The remaining factors taken into con
sideration were classified by the speaker
into "easily ascertainable factors" and
"success factors"â€”not so easily ascer
tained. In the former group the appli
cant's record in college is considered:
such matters as grades and honors, intel
ligence test records, proportion of ex
penses earned, and activities. In the sec
ond group the reason for wanting to
enter the industry and the particular com
pany involved, and what vocation he in
tends to make his life work are con
sidered.
It was decided at the conference that
it is extremely important that machinery
be instituted whereby the employer may
have benefit of opinions and judgments
from the student's professors, and from
any others who have had an opportunity
to size up the situation. This was recom
mended because of the difficulty of sizing
up a candidate on short notice.
