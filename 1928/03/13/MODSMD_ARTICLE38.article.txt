"Elements of Physiology for Stu
dents of Medicine and Advanced
Biology," by Ernest G. Martin. Stan
ford professor of physiology, and
Frank W. Weymouth, associated pro
fessor of physiology at Stanford, has
just been released by Lea and Felii
ger, publishers.

The entire field of physiology is
covered in the large volume of 784
pages illustrated with 138 engravings.
Approaching the subject of physi
ology from a different point of view
the authors have developed it from
two key-principles. The first of these
is the familiar key-principle of gen
eral physiology, that living proto
plasm is a system of molecules and
ions.
That every protoplasmic cell is a
self-sustaining system is the second
key-principle around which the book
is built.
