### 
"College women in the Near East
are not very different from those in
America," said Katherine Newell
Adams, president of the Constantino
ple Women's College in an address
before the Faculty Women's Club yes
terday. "They dress the same, play
basketball, tennis, and hockey, and
take part in outside activities. There
is a difference, however, for they have
a zest, and earnestness, which is lack
ing among many American women.
They do not just naturally drift into
going to college as so many in your
country do, but they work for it, long
for it, dream about it.
"Our college women have lived
much deeper lives than most Ameri
cans. They are more pessimistic per
haps because they have seen so much
of the hard, tragic side of life."
Many Nationalities
Nineteen various nations are repre
sented in the Constantinople Women's
College, and one of the most import
ant functions of the college, accord
ing to Miss Adams, is to have the
women learn to understand and ap
preciate other nations.
Several alumnae of Constantino
ple's Women's College, which is the
only college exclusively for women in
the Near East, have distinguished
themselves as nurses, and one, who
took graduate work in Germany, es
tablished a baby clinic in Constan
tinople. "Turkish women are very in
terested in journalism, and also in
teaching," said Miss Adams.
Student government is practiced as
it is here, and a quarterly is put out
by the women. "There are two holi
days week, Friday, the Moslem
Sabbath, and Sunday. A social service
center where children are taught to
play games, and where mothers may
come to learn stories to tell their
children, and to enjoy themselves, has
been established at the college. Wo
men spend their spare time doing so
cial service work to raise the stand
aid of living.
"Turkey will be one of the great
nations of the world in the future, if
America will stand behind her, and
if the American people will continue
to make it nossible for men and wo
men in the Near East to go to col
lege" concluded Miss Adams.

"Turkey will be one of the great
nations of the world in the future, if
America will stand behind her, and
if the American people will continue
to make it nossible for men and wo
men in the Near East to go to col
lege" concluded Miss Adams.
"College women in the Near East
are not very different from those in
America," said Katherine Newell
Adams, president of the Constantino
ple Women's College in an address
before the Faculty Women's Club yes
terday. "They dress the same, play
basketball, tennis, and hockey, and
take part in outside activities. There
is a difference, however, for they have
a zest, and earnestness, which is lack
ing among many American women.
They do not just naturally drift into
going to college as so many in your
country do, but they work for it, long
for it, dream about it.
"Our college women have lived
much deeper lives than most Ameri
cans. They are more pessimistic per
haps because they have seen so much
of the hard, tragic side of life."
Many Nationalities
Nineteen various nations are repre
sented in the Constantinople Women's
College, and one of the most import
ant functions of the college, accord
ing to Miss Adams, is to have the
women learn to understand and ap
preciate other nations.
Several alumnae of Constantino
ple's Women's College, which is the
only college exclusively for women in
the Near East, have distinguished
themselves as nurses, and one, who
took graduate work in Germany, es
tablished a baby clinic in Constan
tinople. "Turkish women are very in
terested in journalism, and also in
teaching," said Miss Adams.
Student government is practiced as
it is here, and a quarterly is put out
by the women. "There are two holi
days week, Friday, the Moslem
Sabbath, and Sunday. A social service
center where children are taught to
play games, and where mothers may
come to learn stories to tell their
children, and to enjoy themselves, has
been established at the college. Wo
men spend their spare time doing so
cial service work to raise the stand
aid of living.
"Turkey will be one of the great
nations of the world in the future, if
America will stand behind her, and
if the American people will continue
to make it nossible for men and wo
men in the Near East to go to col
lege" concluded Miss Adams.
