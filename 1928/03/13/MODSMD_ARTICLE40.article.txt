# Encina Men Rioted in Past Jordan Was Then President Proposed Division of Hall

Fear of student riots at one time
caused University officials to serious
ly consider the dividing of Encina
Hall into two or three sections, ac
cording to the Daily Palo Alto of
January 10, 1906.
"The object of this proposed
change," said Dr. Jordan, who was
then president of the University, "is
to gain more privacy for the residents
of the Hall and also to prevent men
from congregating in such large num
bers. By this method University au
thorities hope to prevent hazing and
rioting, which has been going on
lately.
"As now suggested, the second,
third, and fourth floors of Encina will
be divided into three sections. The
first floor will remain just as it is at
present. This will allow all the men
the privileges of the clubroom.
"All the large modern Eastern
domitories are divided into smaller
sections â€”somewhat on the ideas of
flats. I visited dormitories at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania and Swarth
more College, and at both places this
system was successful."
Much dissatisfaction was shown by
the Encina men at this time 1 as they
had gained the impression that the
hall would be divided in half by a
solid partition. The greatest discus
sion was aroused in regard to the
clubroom, which they thought would
be divided.
