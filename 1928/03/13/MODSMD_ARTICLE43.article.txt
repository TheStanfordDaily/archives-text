# SPORTS OF 1928
## Two Prominent Reds 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
If you will scan the roster of the Rois
terous Reds of Cincinnati, you will find
the names of Lucas, Charles Fred, who
bats left, throws right, is twenty-six
years old, weighs 170 pounds, stands 5
feet 9 1 / i inches tall, and lives in Nash
ville, Tennessee, and Purdy, Everett Vir
gil, who bats left, throws right, is twenty
four years old, weighs 150, is 5 feet 6
inches tall, and whose home is in Beatrice,
Nebraska.
"Red" Lucas is that rare combination
of hitter-pitcher, so seldom seen in the
major leagues. He placed second base
and in the outfield for the Braves in
1924, and, when sent to Seattle in May
of the following year, he both pitched
and chased flies in the outer garden. In
1926, at Cincinnati, he was used pri

i
marily as a relief hurler, appearing in I
thirty-one ball games, winning six and
losing five. But what was more impor
tant to him, he batted more than .300. ' {
In 1927 "Red" made quite a name for j •
himself, for in 37 games as a pitcher he *
won 18 and lost 11, with an earned run 1
percentage of 3.37. In 150 times at bat j 1
(this in 80 games) he made 49 hits, fori 1
an average of .313. Perhaps he'll develop
1 into a regular outfielder in time. Other 1
pitchers have done it.
Everett Purdy also came to the Reds c
from Seattle. Arriving at the tail end
of last season, he belted big-league pitch
ing for an average of .354. He is a little s
runt, but got two doubles, four triples, J i
and one homer out of his 22 hits in 62 j
times at bat.
