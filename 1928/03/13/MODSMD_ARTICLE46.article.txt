Johnny Seiler, of Augusta, Ga., who pro
posed to allow C. G. Pyle's cross-country
runners a week start and then overtake
them, tonight gave up his attempt to run
from Los Angeles to New York.
After having covered approximately 60
miles between Los Angeles and here since
he started Sunday, Seiler claimed "poor
condition" and refused to go farther.
The Co-op, University of Oregon book
store, has made an increase of approxi
mately $5000 in the gross receipts.
