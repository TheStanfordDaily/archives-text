# REGISTRATION DANCE IS PLANNED FOR APRIL 2
## 
### 
April 2 is the date set for the Spring
Registration dance, announced by
George F. Mott, dance chairman. This
marks the revival of an old Stanford
custom, disregarded in the preceding
Autumn and Winter quarters, of hold
ing the dance on the day of registra
tion instead of on a Friday.
Brooks-Worthington orchestra has
been obtained for the evening. Admit
tance is $1 a couple, and roughs will
be welcome.
