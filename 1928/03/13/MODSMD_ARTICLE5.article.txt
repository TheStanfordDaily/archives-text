# SEATTLE VOTERS WILL DECIDE BETWEEN MAN OR WOMAN AS MAYOR
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Mar. 12.—( U.P.)
—The question of "women in politics,"
clear cut, and with no other issue to
cloud it, will come before the voters of
this city tomorrow when they will choose
whether Mayor Bertha K. Landes shall
serve another two-year term or whether
the city's chief executive shall be a man,
Frank Edwards, theater owner.
"Seattle needs a man for mayor" has
been the slogan of the Edwards support
ers throughout the primary and the gen
eral campaigns, both of which have been
as heated as any Seattle has ever experi
enced, without, however, any great slop
ping of political mud.
Mrs. Landes is completing four years
of municipal service, two years as presi
dent of the city council and two years
as mayor. Her supporters, strangely!
enough, arc sponsoring her re-election I
upon a straight good business platform'
without any of the usual cry of suppres-1
sion of bootlegging and vice, such as;
characterized her defeat of former May
or Edwin J. Brown, two years ago.
Mayor Landes cleaned up the vice situ-1
ation very soon after her election, with-;
out any show of sensation and as only j
one of her many problems of mayoralty, j
j There has been no serious criticism of
her police administration, nor for a re-!
turn to former conditions.
