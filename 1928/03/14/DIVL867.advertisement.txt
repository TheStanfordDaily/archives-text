SAID THIS BRIGHT YVUSC MAN,
"l% THE 141IM D OF Mi IT
VOSJ WEAR WITH A *7 TIE"
But, we hasten to add, Thos. Heath clothes for their part do
not require seven dollar ties. In other words, if you wear
seven dollar ties you certainly ought to have a Thos. Heath
suit or two or three for company. But on the other hand
if you wear Thos. Heath clothes you are sufficiently distin
guished to wear any tie with great impunity, or, in extreme
cases, no tie at all. Such is the result of so much personal
supervision, hand work and everlasting fussing with details.
