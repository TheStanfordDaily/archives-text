restitution it rested upon those who
obtained the Sinclair money.

four-hour sitting of the committee

1. Chairman Butler testified that
Hays had brought him $25,000 in
bonds and asked him to be a dummy
contributor for them, which he re
fused to do.

2. Secretary of the Treasury Mellon
testified that Hays similarly asked
him to pose as the contributor of $50,-
000 of Sinclair bonds, which he re
fused to do.

mittee has been seeking information,
said he did not feel that it was his
business to tell since he did not be
lieve it would add any useful informa
tion to what the committee already
knew.
Senator Walsh of Montana was par
ticularly severe with Will Hays who
failed to reveal the Mellon and Butler
episodes during his two previous ap
pearances before the committee.
