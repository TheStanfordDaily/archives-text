NEW YORK, Mar. 13. — (U.P.) —
New ideas in the management of the
United States diplomatic service and new
opportunities for would-be American dip
lomats of the future were suggested by
Myron T. Herrick, United States Am
bassador to France, in an interview with
the United Press just before he sailed
to resume his service in Paris.
"College men of the future in Ameri
can schools will come more and more to
realize the appeal of the diplomatic serv
ice as a life work," said the ambassador.
"They will know that the United States
government is encouraging them in their
efforts to serve the country in diplomatic
and consular posts. Even yet it is diffi
cult for young men to maintain their
positions in the service as they should,
due to the financial problem. But the
United States government has made great
strides forward in this matter and it is
quite possible that in the future a man of
even limited resources may go high in the
work of our embassies and consulates."
"The importance of the foreign diplo
matic service of the United States," said
the ambassador, "should be realized by
every patriotic citizen. It is through our
diplomatic representatives that we employ
systematically and continually, that is, in
the only effective way, the resources of
peace.
"I am glad to say that in recent years
there has been a new spirit in our for
eign service. This is due to the fact that
the service has been better organized and
equipped."
