# QUESTIONNAIRE SHOWS WASHINGTON STUDENTS' EXPENSES IN COLLEGE
## 
### 
Opinions that students go to college
only to have a good time, dancing,
seeing movies, and watching athletic
teams, instead of tending to their aca
demic work, mean nothing to engi
neering students at the University of
Washington, according to the results
of a questionnaire submitted recently
by the Ad Club there.
The questionnaire, which was given
by the group in an attempt to find the
potential buying power of university
students, showed that the average
student engineer spent only $2.50 a
month on dances, $3.05 on theatres,
and 35 cents on athletic contests.
Two students didn't spend a cent
on dancing or dining, and three didn't
pay anything for athletic contests,
while only one did not visit the thea
tre at least once a month.
One student spent $10 on dancing,
which draws the average up to the
$2.50 level. The greatest amount
spent each month for athletic events
was $1. The theatre drew a larger
patronage than either of the others,
taking $6 from one student's allow
ance each month.
The engineering students seem to
be able to dress less expensively than
the other on the Washington campus.
One hundred thirty-five dollars was
the yearly average spent for clothing
by students in all departments.
One student "got along very nice
ly," according to his statement, on $34
a year.
