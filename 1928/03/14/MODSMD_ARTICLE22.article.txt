### 
SANTA PAULA, March 13.—(U.P.) —California's greatest
catastrophe, the breaking of the St. Francis Dam in the Santa Clara
River Valley, has claimed more than three hundred lives. A late
check of all assembly points in the devastated area showed that
two hundred and seventy-seven bodies have already been recovered
and that more were being brought into the morgues hourly.

* Seven hundred were still missing.
In addition to the increasing death
list the damage caused when the huge
concrete water barrier gave way ap
peared larger every hour.
Conservative estimates placed the
value of homeß washed away or de
molished, the ruination of crops, or
chards, highways, and bridges be
tween $12,000,000 and $15,000,000.
The Saint Francis dam, the collapse
of which sent billions of gallons of
water down on sleeping valley resi
dents, and the power house it supplied
were built at a cost of $2,750,000.
