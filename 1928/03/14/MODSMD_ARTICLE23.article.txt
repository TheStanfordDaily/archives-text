# RED CROSS TO RESCUE
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, March 14.—( U.P.)
—Every organization v/h' h possibly
could aid the victims or the Saint
Francis Dam crash was either on the
ground tonight or had offered ser
vices.
The American Red Cross, using
much of the equipment pressed into
service in the Santa Barbara earth
quake disaster, had established tem
porary headquarters at Newhall and
was aiding in the relief work through
out the Santa Clara River Valley.
Santa Paula Hardest Hit
Santa Paula, a city of 7500, ap
peared to have suffered the most dam
age of the seven towns along the val
ley. Water reached to the second floor
of the Santa Paula High School.
The dam itself was in fragments,
except for the middle section, which,
like an ugly tombstone, jutted upward
from the ground.
More than twenty blocks of houses
were swept away at Santa Paula. The
debris was strewn on the roads and
over the countryside for miles around.
The towns of Fillmore, Piru, and El
Rio also plainly showed signs of the
destruction wrought in the terrific
downpour of the flood waters.
Flying Field Destroyed
At El Rio the town's flying field
had been entirely destroyed. The
hangar was flattened on the ground.
A smashed plane could be seen from
the air.
Orchards had been swept away and
trees floated about in the water.
The force with which the water
gushed through the dam was shown
by the distance it had moved the
great blocks of broken concrete. Parts
of the dam were scattered far below
the once imposing structure and it
seemed probable that the loosened
chunks, churning along in the racing
waters, had caused the dislodgement
of many of the houses in their path.
Only a thin stream of water was
flowing through the collapsed dam.
Sand carried through the crevices had
been deposited for miles along the
route of the flood and, where the
water poured into the sea near Ven
tura, great pools of silt had been
formed.
