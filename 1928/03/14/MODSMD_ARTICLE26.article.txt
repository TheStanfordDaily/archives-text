College students, those at Stanford not excepted, pride themselves on
having an appreciation, at least higher than average, of the arts. But do
they? The following conversation was overheard the day after the recent
symphony concert by a member of the University staff, not a college
student or graduate, and not a musician, but one who does appreciate
music and who was wondering if the attitude shown here is typical:
"Well, Dick, wasn't it splendid !"
"Oh, I didn't go."
"But you got two tickets."
"Yes, but Jack wouldn't go; we went to the movies instead.
The concert is just a lot of squeak, squeak, squeak, and we get
enough of that at home."
"How is that?"
"A friend of mine is learning the violin —but he is getting to
be a pretty good player now."
To call a concert by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, under
the direction of Alfred Hertz, a "squeak, squeak, squeak, is not merely
funny; it shows a lack of appreciation due to ignorance. Perhaps this
dialogue is not representative of the majority of college students, and
then again, maybe it is. But if it does show a good sample of the
general attitude, college students had better quit bragging.
