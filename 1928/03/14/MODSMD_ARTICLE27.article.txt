# The
						Perpetual Student

Germany has erected a memorial tablet to her "perpetual student" of
the University of Jena, who for forty-three consecutive years was en
rolled as an undergraduate in, and for forty-two consecutive years failed
to receive a diploma from that institution. Although it is not mentioned
on the tablet, it is understood that the perpetual student divided his time
between the classroom and the bar-room, and that of the two he was more
at home in the latter, dueling and drinking with equal proficiency.
It is lamentable that the commercialization of education in this coun
try and age has made such characters financial and scholastic impossi
bilities. Imagine the dignity and sacredness that such rocks of ages could
cast upon our halls of learning. What examples of cultural and spiritual
stability could they be to uncertain and unsophisticated striplings; what
bonds of union between tottering alumni and toddling freshmen; what
counsel to the faculty; what solace to the graduate manager.
But alas, the days of the scholar are past. Students may come, and
students may go, but none can stay forever. Our universities will not
satisfy the insatiable student. They discourage him with diplomas and
bust notices; they eject him with honors, and they eject him without
honors, but they must drive him out, his intellectual curiosity perhaps not
yet even aroused, to replace him with others whom they will treat the
same.
Indeed, Germany could not have erected a monument to one more
worthy. He was more than a student; he was a tradition. —1 he Cornell

Come on, Los Angeles, better get out two of 'em.
