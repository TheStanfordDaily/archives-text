# INTEREST IN COMING ELECTION SHOWN BY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS

### 
OBERLIN, 0., Mar. 13.—(I.P.)—The
accusation that college students are com
pletely oblivious to affairs outside the
ivied walls of learning may hold most of 1
the time, but once in four years at least;
there comes a renewal of interest in aca- !
demic circles in affairs national.
For the quadrennial presidential elec
tion stir is one which invades almost |
every college and university campus in
the country.
Already this year straw votes on presi
dential candidates have been held at Yale
and at Oregon—Hoover winning by big i
majorities in each case—and many more
such collegiate presidential straw votes |
are being planned.
But of still more interest, because it [
affects the activities of the students more,
is the mock political convention .examples
of which are held in many colleges and |
universities every four years just before
the regular political national conventions, j

Among those planning such events for
this year are Ohio State, Western Re
serve, Wisconsin, Ohio Wesleyan, and
Oberlin.
Oberlin claims the distinction of origi
nating the idea. It was back in 1864 that
the first Oberlin Mock Republican Na
tional Convention was held. Lincoln was
the Oberlin nominee, and since that time
at nine of the fifteen such conventions
held here the same candidate as was
later selected by the Republicans was
named by the Oberlin students.
Oberlin's convention always has been
Republican in nature. In the 1924 con
ventions Coolidge, Borah, and LaFol
lette were the most popular Republican
nominees in collegiate circles, while A1
Smith was almost the sole Democrat
named by undergraduates.
