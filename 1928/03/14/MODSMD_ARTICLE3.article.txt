# "CAPONSACCHI" WELL RENDERED IN READING BY ANTHONY BLANKS
## Palmer-Goodrich Adaptation Of Browning's Poem Is Poetical Drama 
### 
Capousacchi, the "warrior-priest,"
champion of truth and all that is fine,
Pompilia, the beautiful girl wife of
Count Guido, the cruel, shrewd "Blue
beard," were portrayed excellently by
Dr. Anthony F. Blanks, professor of
English, in his reading of "Capon
sacchi" as the last Tuesday evening
lecture program of the quarter.

"Caponsacchi," a Palmer-Goodrich
adaptation of Robert Browning's "The
Ring and the Book," is a highly poeti
cal drama, and according to Dr.
Blanks, "one of the great adventures
of the American stage." The trial of
Count Guido for the of his
lovely wife, takes place in the Vati*
can. The pope, who is final judge, sits
unseen, hoping to find the truth by
seeing and hearing the stories of the
count and the priest. Caponsacchi
tells of his taking Pompilia away from
the scheming count to Rome to her
parents, and of their being overtaken
by Guido; then of his banishment, and
on the day of his return, the heartless
murder of Pompilia, and her parents,
for their gold.

"Truth lies in the hearts of men,"
so says the pope, and he finds it, sen
tencing Guido to death, and telling
Caponsacchi, "Well done. God above
men. Go work, bear life; as you led
others, so lead men. Make the world
better."

"Caponsacchi" is a satire on rank,
wealth, and the "world's insight"; and
truth wins in the end. Dr. Blanks
showed great ability and versatility
in his rendition of it.
