The Editor, Sir:
"100,000 for athletic buildings, but
not a cent for hot showers." Such
seems to be the war cry of the Board
of Athletic Control. Practically every
day after five-thirty P.M. hot showers
are a minus quantity at the Encina
Gym—there just simply aren't any
then.
After a strenuous athletic workout,
nothing feels better than a hot
shower. A hot showed revives all the
tired muscles and sets a fellow up for
the rest of the evening. On the other
hand, what is more dissatisfying than
a cold, lukewarm shower. It leaves a
fellow just as tired as before entering
the shower, and it hasn't half the kick
that a hot shower has. In fact, a cold
shower is just as much out of place
as a glass of water on Big Game
night.
When the many advantages of a
hot shower are set off against the
practically negligible value of a cold
shower, there seems no reason why
the athletic heads could not come off
their high horse, spend a small
amount of money, and supply the gym
with hot showers until at least six
in the evening. —W.D.
The Editor, Sir:
I know that this is digging up a
long-buried hatchet, but I still feel
argumentative on the subject.
Somebody or something decided
that the dear old mud-fight be retired
in favor of a tie-up.
The very idea grieves me almost
beyond words. I feel that I have been
gypped, cheated, slighted, not consid
ered, left in the fog, and so forth. This
righteous indignation arises because
I am one of the foolish individuals

inclined to put too much faith in ex
perience. After going head foremost
into a nice, comfortable mud-puddle,
besides losing two pairs of shoes, one
shirt, part of a laundry bag, a little
skin, and the unessential portion of
my trousers, I feel that it is in ac
cordance with the honor system that
I be allowed to use lessons from those
experiences to my own advantage
against the great unlearned masses
of 1932.
For instance, I would never again
consider shoes other than the type
containing serviceable (pointed) hob
nails and equipped with high tops
made of two-ply leather. Furthermore,
no belt less durable than thick raw
hide or campus beefsteak would ever
be trusted with the upholding duties
of my three pairs of pants.
Now mudfighting is a sport for gen
tlemen (also politicians) whereas
rope-tying suggests bull-throwing and
similar far-Western practices which
prove most repulsive to the refined
tastes of those now living in Encina.
In addition, the tricks of the two
trades are as different as the adver
tised features of an automobile con
trasted with the same features 30,000
miles later. Hence my college educa
tion about mud-fighting is as useless
as four-wheel brakes on a loaded
wheelbarrow in regard to tie-ups.
According to our highly enjoyable
course in citizenship, the pursuit of
happiness is guaranteed by the Con
stitution. Unless my own game of
mud-fighting is restored to its former
standing, I fear I shall be pursued
instead of being in pursuit of way
ward frosh of '32. Therefore, I appeal
most earnestly to those in authority
that justice be restored.

in favor of a tie-up.
The very idea grieves me almost
beyond words. I feel that I have been
gypped, cheated, slighted, not consid
ered, left in the fog, and so forth. This
righteous indignation arises because
I am one of the foolish individuals

inclined to put too much faith in ex
perience. After going head foremost
into a nice, comfortable mud-puddle,
besides losing two pairs of shoes, one
shirt, part of a laundry bag, a little
skin, and the unessential portion of
my trousers, I feel that it is in ac
cordance with the honor system that
I be allowed to use lessons from those
experiences to my own advantage
against the great unlearned masses
of 1932.
For instance, I would never again
consider shoes other than the type
containing serviceable (pointed) hob
nails and equipped with high tops
made of two-ply leather. Furthermore,
no belt less durable than thick raw
hide or campus beefsteak would ever
be trusted with the upholding duties
of my three pairs of pants.
Now mudfighting is a sport for gen
tlemen (also politicians) whereas
rope-tying suggests bull-throwing and
similar far-Western practices which
prove most repulsive to the refined
tastes of those now living in Encina.
In addition, the tricks of the two
trades are as different as the adver
tised features of an automobile con
trasted with the same features 30,000
miles later. Hence my college educa
tion about mud-fighting is as useless
as four-wheel brakes on a loaded
wheelbarrow in regard to tie-ups.
According to our highly enjoyable
course in citizenship, the pursuit of
happiness is guaranteed by the Con
stitution. Unless my own game of
mud-fighting is restored to its former
standing, I fear I shall be pursued
instead of being in pursuit of way
ward frosh of '32. Therefore, I appeal
most earnestly to those in authority
that justice be restored.

The Editor, Sir:
"100,000 for athletic buildings, but
not a cent for hot showers." Such
seems to be the war cry of the Board
of Athletic Control. Practically every
day after five-thirty P.M. hot showers
are a minus quantity at the Encina
Gym—there just simply aren't any
then.
After a strenuous athletic workout,
nothing feels better than a hot
shower. A hot showed revives all the
tired muscles and sets a fellow up for
the rest of the evening. On the other
hand, what is more dissatisfying than
a cold, lukewarm shower. It leaves a
fellow just as tired as before entering
the shower, and it hasn't half the kick
that a hot shower has. In fact, a cold
shower is just as much out of place
as a glass of water on Big Game
night.
When the many advantages of a
hot shower are set off against the
practically negligible value of a cold
shower, there seems no reason why
the athletic heads could not come off
their high horse, spend a small
amount of money, and supply the gym
with hot showers until at least six
in the evening. —W.D.
