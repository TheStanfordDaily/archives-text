Father Mississippi, by Lyle Saxon;
The Century Co.
The life of the American Nile has
been one of war between, its waters
and man. From its prehistoric forma
tive period to its present-day course,
Mr. Saxon traces the river's power
in economics, history, and romance.
The notable events of pioneering
days and the stages by which com
merce and agriculture increased in
the valley serve as a background for
the author's illuminating description
of the floods, their control and pre
vention. Mr. Saxon depicts the Mis
isissippi as the determiner of the
Nation's growth, fount of romance,
source of beautiful legends, and a
curse to the dwellers along its banks.
"The biggest flood on earth" came
early in April 1927, heralded by
crashing levees from Arkansas to
New Orleans. Mr. Saxon tells of the
heroic efforts to hold back the pour
ing deluge by a frail-looking line of
sandbags and then the climax of ten
sion and anxiety with the dynamiting
of the Poydoras levee on April 29.
Explains Problems
Mr. Saxon completes his story by
taking up in detail the problems of
flood control, theory and practice, and
flood prevention. "The Mississippi,"
he asserts, "belongs to the people of
the United States. The river drains a
vast area unaffected by flood, which
should be held equally responsible for
its ravages. The solution will be slow,
but relief can be given, and it must
be given quickly, for not so very long
after Congress meets spring will be
here, and torrents will be sweeping
down the Mississippi to the Gulf."
