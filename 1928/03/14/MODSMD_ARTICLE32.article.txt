# The 						Ugly Duchess, by Lion Feuch-twanger; Viking Press.
## 
### 
Feuchtwanger's place as a literary I
figure is secure. "The Ugly Dutchess"
may not have the broad sweep, the j
kaleidoscope pageantry and the dra- j
matic climax of "Power," but it de
lineates with painstaking artistry the j
innermost workings of the human j
mind, a tragic figure, doomed by phys- 1
ical ugliness to be maligned, misun
derstood, and rejected.
Margarete, Dutchess of Tyrol, is
like a character cursed by the Greek
gods; her every desire thwarted, her j
good intentions misinterperted, and
her better deeds credited to her bitter j
rival, all because she was physically j
so ill-favored as to repel even her in
timates. With a misshaped head,
overhanging lip, and a disproportion-1
ate jaw, she has left her mark in his- 1
tory as the ugliest woman of whom
history has record. Sackniouth —thus j
she was known to her people, and i
parents frightened their children with
allusions of her ogre-like countenance.'

With a wealth of detail Feuchtwan
ger plunges the reader into the pa
geant of medieval Germany with its
hundreds of princelings, dukedoms,
free cities, fiefs and seas. Pope, em
peror, outlaw, burgher, and peasant,
Neapolitan money-lender and his Jew
ish rival —all play their parts on the
tragic stage from which Margarete
makes her ignominious exit, a forlorn
and vanquished creature destined by
fate to leave as her contribution to
history the fact that she was the
world's ugliest woman.
Her statecraft, her farseeing sup
port of the burghers in their victori
ous fight against the baronieal privi
lege, her liberalism in religious mat
ters in an age of superstition, her
fostering of commerce and industry,
availed her nothing. Her misfortune
came with birth and followed her to
the death. She was repulsively ugly!
That is Feuchtwanger's story, a ming
ling of fiction and fact, romance and
realism that makes it one of the
greatest novels that has appeared in
years. —E.L.S.
