Blue books are beginning to be so
fascinating. I mean, everyone seems to
be all excited about being able to fill them
next week. Of course, all the nonchalant
roughs who never care about staying in
college are talking quite wonderfully
about getting grades and things.
I mean, they sort of disappoint a girl
when they change their minds about go- i
ing out into the world for adventure.
Of course, shocks on the campus gen-1
erally come from the campus chatter, but
I really think that the co-eds should just J
go ahead and admit that they are trying
hard.
I mean, I think that dark circles are a
mark of real studtousness, even though
they do always come near finals. But so
many of them have simply become quite
courageous and are wearing glasses and
everything.
And I really do get a thrill out of my
professors. I mean they are beginning
to be really interesting, now that they are
getting right down to the facts of their
courses, with exams so near.
I really don't understand how anyone
can learn much from a seminar. I mean
with so many people around it is hard
to get very far. There are so many dis
tractions.
But I was wondering if there wasn't
some way that a nice person who was
really serious minded could manage to
avoid those perfectly horrid tests and
things. I mean, it would help a lot if
there was a line of some sort that one
could get hold of that would aid materi
ally in eliminating, well, you know what
everyone really says about fnlais. So 1
ask you, why not either let everyone have
blue books at home or not use them at
all.
