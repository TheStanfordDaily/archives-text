# Parisian Brand Of Naughtiness But Little Changed By Years

PARIS, Mar. 13.—(U.P.)—There is a
French saying which is perhaps the best
definition of Paris as a haven for pleas
ure seekers. The saying is "Plus cela
change plus c'est la menu: chose," which
may be translated freely as "The more it
changes the more it is like what it was
before." Nothing is different but the
veneer.
The old Moulin Rouge, famous
throughout the world as the last word in
risque shows, vanished only to give way
lo a dozen others where the visitor of
today can find the same attractions which
brought his grandfather to Paris fifty
years ago. Only now he can find them
in every night resort while his forbears
were limited to one.
Exit the Demimonde
There are no longer women whose dis
plays of jewels and horses, whose love
affairs and extravagances, ups and downs,
made them heroines of romance, but their
place is well filled by so-called actresses,
dancers, "artists" of all kinds who, in
stead of being called "demimondaines,"
proudly call themselves "mondaines," or
women of the world. The women of an
other day drove thoroughbreds presented
by princes and nabobs and spent hours
every day at the hairdresser's. Those of

| today drive de luxe cars and have their
hair bobbed once a month.
j "Plus cela change, plus c'est la meme
j chose."
In the time of Napoleon and down to
the last days of the second Empire the
gilded youth of Paris thronged the Palais
Royal, where everything, from gambling
;to gallantry, was at their disposal. They
never went to the country except when
the sheriff was on their heels or when a
change in their political fortunes made
the capital unsafe. The bloods of today
are scarcely ever seen in Paris. The
( automobile has taken the place of the
. four-in-hand and in place of the Palais
i Royal they have a hundred resorts within
an hour of Paris to which the police
penetrate only on festive occasions when
the company stages a revival of the Bac
chanalian orgies under the unblushing
! stars.
Champagne Comes High
Anybody who can pay for a bottle of
so-called champagne at two to 500 francs
! a throw can try the dance floors in the
Montmartre establishments. The art stu
dents have the annual "Bal des Quat'z'-
' arts" where everything goes, especially
the scanty clothes in which the students
| and their models are draped at the open
i ing of the ball.
