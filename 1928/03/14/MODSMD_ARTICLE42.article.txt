# Oregon Debaters Able to Continue Tour With Loan
## 
### 
University of Oregon debaters, ma-'
rooned in New York for more than a
week, were able to continue their cruise
as a result of a financial loan by a mem
ber of the Oregon faculty. The junior
class has also voted to give the profits
of Junior Shine Day to the debaters.
The Oregon men will engage in more
than thirty debates in various countries
before they return to the campus in May.
