# Wisconsin Opens Date Shop Queening Allowed to All Bureau Considered Success
## 
### 
MADISON, Wis., Mar. 13.—(U.P.)—|
"Dates That Don't Disappoint" is the j
slogan of Wisconsin University's latest!
experiment—The Date Shop, which is j
doing a land office business under the
supervision of Stanley Aranoff, philan
thropic sophomore.
"Wanna blonde ?
"Redhead?
"Hot-stepper ?
"Book noser? |
"Quiet gutie?" queries Stanley from l
behind the counter of his new establish
ment.
"All right, here you are," he passes
out a neatly typewritten slip containing j
the name, address, and accomplishments I
of an appropriately designed co-ed.
And another soul, swathed in grizzly |
bear garments and iron hat, plunges into j
the night, made supremely happy by vis- j
ions of a full evening ahead.
Aranoff, who originated the idea after
watching the jaded and friendless lives
of shy and unknown students and co-eds,
is a campus uplifter of the most up-to
date type.
He worried long and late over the sad
fate of the dormitory boys, lacking in so

, cial glitter but yearning to meet some
"nice kid," and of many co-eds longing
| for a chancc to meet a good boy and see
a show now and then.
"Student social life stagnation" is the
way Aranoff labeled conditions. He de
cided to change this awkward situation
and the "Date Shop" is the result.
"Yes, size is important," Aranoff ex-!
I plained. "I'm careful never to date tall
j girls with short men, or gangling youths
with ponderous piano punishers. Modera
tion in all things is my motto."
He added that all the dating is not

i from the masculine side. "It may be the
effect of leap year, but many a co-ed has
called me asking to get a date with an
appreciative male student. I do my best
and usually these meetings turn out as
satisfactory as when conditions are re
versed."
The senior class at the University of
Illinois was denied its annual ball be
cause of rowdiness at the seitior informal.
The American University of Syria has
received a million-dollar donation from
the John D. Rockefeller Foundation.

Aranoff, who originated the idea after
watching the jaded and friendless lives
of shy and unknown students and co-eds,
is a campus uplifter of the most up-to
date type.
He worried long and late over the sad
fate of the dormitory boys, lacking in so

, cial glitter but yearning to meet some
"nice kid," and of many co-eds longing
| for a chancc to meet a good boy and see
a show now and then.
"Student social life stagnation" is the
way Aranoff labeled conditions. He de
cided to change this awkward situation
and the "Date Shop" is the result.
"Yes, size is important," Aranoff ex-!
I plained. "I'm careful never to date tall
j girls with short men, or gangling youths
with ponderous piano punishers. Modera
tion in all things is my motto."
He added that all the dating is not

i from the masculine side. "It may be the
effect of leap year, but many a co-ed has
called me asking to get a date with an
appreciative male student. I do my best
and usually these meetings turn out as
satisfactory as when conditions are re
versed."

"Dates That Don't Disappoint" is the j
slogan of Wisconsin University's latest!

"Redhead?
"Hot-stepper ?
"Book noser? |
"Quiet gutie?" queries Stanley from l
behind the counter of his new establish
ment.
"All right, here you are," he passes
out a neatly typewritten slip containing j
the name, address, and accomplishments I
of an appropriately designed co-ed.
And another soul, swathed in grizzly |
