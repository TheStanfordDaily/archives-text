DECATUR, 111., Mar. 13.—(U.P.)—
Although he has played exactly 120,878
games of solitaire and won but 623 dur
ing the last thirty years, C. H. Conklin,
74, passenger conductor on the Wabash
railroad, has never yet caught himself
cheating.
Sometimes it took a lot of will-power
to keep from taking one little peek at the
deck, he admitted, particularly when he
would play 1,000 or more games without
winning.
He exercised his forbearance because
he was keeping a careful tabulation of all
games played and wished to calculate the
percentages in Canfield — the brand of
.solitaire he plays.
Chances 190 to 1
Soon after he finished his first 10,000
games—when he was a mere beginner
he found the chances of winning were
190 to 1 against him. That average still
holds good after more than 120,000
games.
Conklin's 120,878 games have been
played in odd moments during his life as
a railroad conductor. He now plays Can
field so expertly that atmospheric condi
tions affect his game.
Weather Has Effect
If the weather is fair and the cards
dry, he plays at the rate of 20 games an
hour. So if he. had played each game at
top speed, it would have taken him more
than 6000 hours to play 120,878 games.
If he had played day and night without
stopping even for mfals it would have
required more than a year's time.
Where Canfield is played in gambling
houses the player pays $52 for the deck
and receives $5 for each card turned up.
If Conklin had been gambling he would
have lost $1,395,227 during his thirty
years of solitaire.
