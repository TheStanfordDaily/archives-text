# Automobile Club Erects Government Road Signs
## 
### 
United States numbered road signs are |
being erected by the California State
Automobile Association on the coast
route south, Route 101, and the valley
route south, Route 99, under the club's
plan to add to its yellow-diamond road
sign system the Federal system of route
designation by numerals on all main
roads.
The shield-shape signs, bearing the
number designating the route, are so
spaced that motorists unfamiliar with the
road may follow a number the entire dis
tance.
According to a recent report, 1687 stu
dents at Yale have been vaccinated since
smallpox appeared in the vicinity of the
campus.
