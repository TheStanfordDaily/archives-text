LOOKING AHEAD
Ulysses and the rest of the boys
who went out after Paris' scalp prob
ably took a no more intense interest
in the Sons of Troy than Dink Tern
pleton and his Cardinal tracksters are
taking in certain young men from
southern California who have bor
rowed the same cognomen.
Now that the Los Angeles Athletic
Club Mercuries have come and gone,
U.S.C. occupies a large portion of the
horizon as far as Stanford is con
cerned.
L.A A.C. did what it set out to
do Saturday—only it came uncom
fortably close to missing. In fact,
Templeton's charges handed
everyone a big surprise by almost
trouncing "the greatest organiza
tion of track stars ever assem
bled in the West."
Not that Stanford wasn't rated well
prior to the meet, but chances seemed
pretty slim for any college team
against the group of nationally fam
ous veterans whose names occupied
a large portion of the club squad's
roster.
With Paddock and Kuck and Max
well and the Smith brothers out there
by themselves the meet would have
been worth the money. Men with
names as prominent as those, in the
world of sport, are worth going to see
any day.
But with Bud Spencer, Bob King,
Fred Zombro, Ward Edmonds, and
Eric Krenz leading the Cards, Stan
ford could have set tip a little show
on her own that would have satisfied
the late Mr. Barnum himself —and the
public wouldn't have been fooled,
either.
The long and short of the whole
thing is that Dink Templeton's
pupils proved themselves to be
in a class by themselves by their
performance Saturday. Any col
lege squad which can do what the
Cards did doesn't need to worry
much about anything in the field
today.
Certain Trojan voices will, of
course, loudly dispute that point.
Stanford may be good, they will say,
but boasting will sound better after
the Card-U.S.C. clash.
And there is some measure of truth
in their contention, no doubt. Stan
ford may not need to worry much
about any college squad, as was so
boldly remarked above, but what wor
rying is done will probably be caused
by Mr. Cromwell's warriors.
After all, there is time enough
between now and the Trojan meet
for considerable muscle-pulling
and other upsetting occurrences.
But then that works both ways;
so it probably isn't too profitable
to count the fowls before the eggs
are laid.
THE HOME FIRES
There has been a big howl, lately,
concerning the lean days which are
to come when the lower division be
comes a thing of the past.
There is good reason for the howl,
too, but judging from the results of
the Freshman meet Saturday, the
wolf won't be scratching at the Board
of Athletic Control's door for a while,
anyway.

are laid.
THE HOME FIRES
There has been a big howl, lately,
concerning the lean days which are
to come when the lower division be
comes a thing of the past.
There is good reason for the howl,
too, but judging from the results of
the Freshman meet Saturday, the
wolf won't be scratching at the Board
of Athletic Control's door for a while,
anyway.
—Bob Speers.
LOOKING AHEAD
Ulysses and the rest of the boys
who went out after Paris' scalp prob
ably took a no more intense interest
in the Sons of Troy than Dink Tern
pleton and his Cardinal tracksters are
taking in certain young men from
southern California who have bor
rowed the same cognomen.
Now that the Los Angeles Athletic
Club Mercuries have come and gone,
U.S.C. occupies a large portion of the
horizon as far as Stanford is con
cerned.
L.A A.C. did what it set out to
do Saturday—only it came uncom
fortably close to missing. In fact,
Templeton's charges handed
everyone a big surprise by almost
trouncing "the greatest organiza
tion of track stars ever assem
bled in the West."
Not that Stanford wasn't rated well
prior to the meet, but chances seemed
pretty slim for any college team
against the group of nationally fam
ous veterans whose names occupied
a large portion of the club squad's
roster.
With Paddock and Kuck and Max
well and the Smith brothers out there
by themselves the meet would have
been worth the money. Men with
names as prominent as those, in the
world of sport, are worth going to see
any day.
But with Bud Spencer, Bob King,
Fred Zombro, Ward Edmonds, and
Eric Krenz leading the Cards, Stan
ford could have set tip a little show
on her own that would have satisfied
the late Mr. Barnum himself —and the
public wouldn't have been fooled,
either.
The long and short of the whole
thing is that Dink Templeton's
pupils proved themselves to be
in a class by themselves by their
performance Saturday. Any col
lege squad which can do what the
Cards did doesn't need to worry
much about anything in the field
today.
Certain Trojan voices will, of
course, loudly dispute that point.
Stanford may be good, they will say,
but boasting will sound better after
the Card-U.S.C. clash.
And there is some measure of truth
in their contention, no doubt. Stan
ford may not need to worry much
about any college squad, as was so
boldly remarked above, but what wor
rying is done will probably be caused
by Mr. Cromwell's warriors.
After all, there is time enough
between now and the Trojan meet
for considerable muscle-pulling
and other upsetting occurrences.
But then that works both ways;
so it probably isn't too profitable
to count the fowls before the eggs
are laid.
