# CARDS TO ENGAGE IN FIVE CONTESTS ON BASEBALL TRIP
## TROJANS' TEAM STRONG To Meet U.C.L.A.; U.S.C. in Los Angeles During Spring Vacation 
### 
Five games will be played by Coach
Harry Wolter's varsity baseball nine dur
ing their trip to Los Angeles the latter
part of this month. On the way south
the Cards will meet a Bakersfield team
in a non-conference game. On March 27
and 28 games will be played with the
U.C.L.A. Bruins and then Stanford will
tangle with U,S.C. in a two-game series
to be played March 30 and 31.
Victories over'the southern teams will
put the Cards near the head of the Cali
fornia Collegiate Baseball Conference
and in line for championship honors. In
the three conference games played this
year, all with St. Mary's, the Cards have
won two and lost one, giving them an
average of .666. •
Harry Wolter's pitching staff appears
to be one of the best developed here in |
recent years. Doug Lewis, "Count" So-i
bieski, Gene Kern, and Bob Phillippi have
all shown up well in St. Mary's and!
Santa Clara games and form as good a'
group of college pitchers as can be found;
on the Coast. Reese, Simpkins, and Rey-j
nolds, though having played little this j
year, are all chuckers having plenty on
the ball when needed.
Stanford's infield and outfield have j
been consistently good so far this sea- !
son. Cook Sypher, because of his scrappy I
play, has an undisputable place at the re- [
ceiving end of the battery. Maguire will |
probably start at first in the Southern
California games, Garibaldi at second,
Busch at short, Laird at third, Levin at
left field, Wilton at center, and Sims atj
right.

Ten varsity basketball players have
been awarded letters at Washington State
College.
