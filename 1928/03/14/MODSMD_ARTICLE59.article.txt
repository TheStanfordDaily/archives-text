# THREE GAMES PLANNED FOR CARD POLO TEAM
## 
### 
During spring vacation the varsity polo
team will make a trip to the Southwest
where it will play three games, one with
the University of Arizona at Tucson on
March 27, and two with the New Mexico
Military Institute on March 30 and 31.
The strength of these two outfits is not
definitely known, but Arizona usually has
a strong squad and has competed in the
East several times.
The six men who will probably make
the trip are Thompson, Post, Weymouth,
! McDougall, Connolly, and Mossman.
These players have been showing up well
in recent practices, and Lieut. Whitmore
â–  concedes them good chances for victory.
