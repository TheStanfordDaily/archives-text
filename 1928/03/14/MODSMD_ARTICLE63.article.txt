# CARDS WILL MEET U.S.C., OLYMPIANS DURING VACATION
## CARDINALS FORMIDABLE To Clash Against Trojans March 31 ; Winged "O" s Here March 24 
### 
With the L.A.A.C. meet a thing of the
past, Coach Dink Templeton is turning
his attention to the Olympic Club, and
more closely to U.S.C. The Cards will
take on the San Francisco outfit on
March 24, and the Trojans on March 31.
In spite of the fact that Stanford's
tracksters proved themselves beyond
question last Saturday, there has been no
let-up in practice sessions. The Mercuries
were tough competition, but more is com
ing, and by the time of the Card-Trojan
clash Templeton's warriors will be in
prime shape.
The U.S.C. danger promises to be no
myth inasmuch as the southern school is
turning out the best outfit seen there
in years. The Trojans have long been
tough customers for Stanford to handle,
and the present season will be no excep
tion if early season marks are to be
considered.
I The Olympians are strong in the
| sprints, at least, with Barbour, former
j Bear flash, and Sweet, who made a name
i for himself at Montana, holding forth in
that event. Then Elmer Gerken, weight
! star at U.C. last year, should give Eric
I Krenz some competition.
