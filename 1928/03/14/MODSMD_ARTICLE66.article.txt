# CARD BABES FAVORED TO TAKE TRACK MEET FROM BEAR FRESHMEN
## 
### 
The strongest freshman track team in
years will meet the California Babes next
quarter to continue the long line of Stan
ford victories in the Little Big Meet.
Unless the California team shows some
extraordinary improvement or the year
lings have a slump, the final score of the
meet will be a one-sided Cardinal victory.
A comparison of the scores made in
last Saturday's meets shows the superior
ity of the Stanford freshmen. The height
that won the California meet pole vault,
11 feet 4 1 /± inches, is the only Stanford
record that has not been equaled this
year. Burt DeGroot, who will be back in
competition this Saturday, has vaulted
over 12 feet. Hec Dyer and Maynor
Shove should take care of the dashes in
fine style. With Lane in the half and
Brown in the two-mile, the yearlings will
have little to fear in the track events.
