# To Draw Schedule Today For Baseball Tournament
## 
### 
The intramural committee will meet
this afternoon to draw up a schedule for
the baseball tournament next quarter.
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
sports, announced yesterday that all or
ganizations must notify him before 1 o'-
clock today of their intention of entering
a team in the tournament.
Suggestions have been submitted to the
committee favoring the adoption of a
soft-ball tournament. Davis requests that
all organizations favoring a soft ball in
stead of hard ball league should notify
him this morning. No club will be al
lowed to enter teams in both tourna
ments. Intramural points will be given in
both divisions.
