## Some More Goalies 
### BY "FEG MURRAY,'16 
Hockey goalies are always interesting,
possibly because they are so conspicuous
in all their funny pads (certainly Solo
mon in all his glory was never arrayed
like one of these) and because they are
the court of last appeal on the momen
tous question of whether or not the puck
shall knock the cage for a goal.
11 would be an almost impossible task
to select the best goal-minder in the Na
tional Hockey League, because each has
his ups and downs, and some have much
better defenses in front of them than
others. Little Roy Worters of Pitts
burgh is awarded the palm by many
hockey followers, and is a wonder at
making almost impossible saves, especially
when two opponents come at him at the
same time.

I Alex Connell, goalie of the world's
j champion Ottawa Senators, is called the
"shut-out king" of the league, and justi
fied that title recently by holding his op
ponents scoreless for six and a half con
secutive hours of hockey. Hal Winkler,
I of those Bruising Bruins of Boston, has
a large following, and Col. Hammond, of
die Rangers, and Ranger fans are proud
of Lome Chabot, who succeeded him in
New York.
Last, but not least, is little Vernon
"Blackie" Forbes, whose acrobatic work
lias featured many a hard tussle on the
ice. Forbes is a chesty little bird, and
much of the credit for the New York
1 Americans' surprising change of form
j must be given to his come-back to major
j league hockey.
