Speeds of reactions of football
players form the topic of an article,
"How Fast Can You Get Away?" in
the Scientific American for March, by
Walter Miles, Professor of Experi
mental Psychology at Stanford.

In the article Professor Miles de
scribes how players, in response to a
command, charge at an instrument
designed to measure the speed of
their reactions. Their heads touch a
trigger, which releases a golf ball,
which strikes a revolving drum and
makes an impression on it.

The charging time for men in the
first squad of varsity linesmen varied
from .316 to .405 seconds, with an
average of .305. In the second varsity
squad it varied from .307 to .549, with
an average of .443 for the seven men.
A group of backs used as linesmen
showed an average of .404, with an
average deviation of .46.
