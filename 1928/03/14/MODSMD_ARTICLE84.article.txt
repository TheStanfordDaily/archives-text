# Hounds May Bay on Farm Possum Tracks Reported New Sport To Be Result
## 
### 
The mournful baying of hounds out
where the rolling foothills rise. The
flicker of dark lanterns. The sibilant
whispers of eager hunters. Will this
he part of the Stanford sport program
of the future?
This possibility was conjured be
fore the would-be campus nimrods as
authentic reports of oppossum tracks
gave credence to the belief that
'possum may become a staple dish in
the dining halls. Then came real
proof!
It was late in the dark night a few
days ago. The students were return
ing to Encina. Across the bright beam
of thoir car's headlights dashed a
peculiar animal.
"A possum," they cried, scarcely
believing their eyes.
The Southern animal gained the
safety of the sidewalk, then huddled
in the low bushes which fringe the
paths in front of the Union Store.
Racoons have long been known for
their nocturnal visits hereabouts.
Oppossums, however, are a rarity.
The best minds on the Farm, or the
most imaginative ones, see visions of
"parties of six" sallying forth on
'possum hunts. It is said that Sam
would be pleased.
Unless there is some hot Southern
sporting blood in the vicinity, how
ever, the possibility seems only a pos
sibilityâ€”especially if there's only one
opossum.
