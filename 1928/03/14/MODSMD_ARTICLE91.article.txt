ALAMEDA, Mar. 13. — (U.P.) — A
single tragedy marked construction of |
the new estuary tube here, which is rap
idly nearing completion. A canary gave
its life in the cause.
Despite the fact that the bird and its
mate were used to test the possible pres-1
ence of monoxide gas in the tunnel .as
trucks first roared through, it was not
the gas that claimed the canary's life.
Someone placed the canary in the con
struction office during the week end. The

office cat was left there too. Tragedy.
The remaining bird of the pair retained
its post at the top of the tube, to warn
men if gas collected in the tunnel. The
warning would have been through its
death.
University of Colorado will permit
Sunday afternoon tennis playing, this
spring, for the first time in the history
of that schdol. The ban on Sunday morn
ing games is still in force.
Cincinnati ranks first among American
universities in growth with an increase
of 80 per cent since 1922.
