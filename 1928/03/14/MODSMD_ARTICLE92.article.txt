# LIBRARIES OF EUROPE DO NOT GIVE SERVICE; HAVE NO HEAT, LIGHT

EUGENE, Ore.—(l.P.)—The libraries
in Europe make no pretense at service;
they are purely aristocratic, and are used
on the whole by only research workers,
according to S. Stephenson Smith, asso
ciate professor of English at the Uni
versity of Oregon, who is quoted by the
Oregon Daily Emerald.

The great Bodleian library at Oxford
has neither light nor heat, is cold as a
tomb most of the time, and is open dur
ing the middle of the day only. The
founders, said Mr. Smith, when they
started this library forbade the installa
tion of light and heat owing to the danger
to the precious books and manuscripts.

They are not libraries as we under
stand them, said Smith; they have no
circulation, no shelves, and it probably
would require an act of Parliament to
take a book from either of the two great
libraries of England, the British Museum
and the Bodleian. These two libraries
have a copy of every book that has been
copyrighted and printed in England, and
together they have a total of nearly five
million volumes and manuscripts.

In general the European libraries are
not well administered. It takes about
four weeks to get a book from the great
Prussian State Library, and one is ex
tremely careful when he enters and more
so when he leaves not to appear suspi
cious. The great State Library of France
Professor Smith says doesn't appear to
have been swept since Richelieu built it.
The dirt under the tables is about eight
inches deep. It is almost impossible to
use the catalogues, since there is no index
finding system. The entries are made in
big black books.

The students at Oxford and Cambridge
buy their own study books, as do most of
the people in England. On the continent
municipal libraries are rare, but they are
beginning to abound in England.
