# WOMEN'S GLEE CLUB PLANS RADIO CONCERT
## 
### 
Arrangements are being made for a
radio concert by the Stanford Wo
men's Glee Club to be broadcast over
KGO in Oakland near the end of next
quarter.
Tryouts for membership will be
held April 2 and 3, the first two days
of next quarter, from 2 to 5 o'clock
upstairs in the Women's Clubhouse.
The club numbers eighteen at pres
ent, and this group may be consider
ably augmented.

Both new and old members will
meet Wednesday, April 3, at 7 o'clock
in the Clubhouse. There will be no
meeting tonight, but regular work
will be begun at this initial practice
next quarter.
