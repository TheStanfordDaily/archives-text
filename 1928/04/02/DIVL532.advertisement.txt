IN MANILA THEY SAY "E-SIVAN"
S-MUUL
—as essen Hal to
a good parly as a girl!
ISUAN—a ginger ale imported from the Philippines—
contains that spirit of joy necessary to any Rood party.
Isuan means "Spirit of Joy." The tartness of fresh limes:
the spice of ripe ginger; the vigor of Isuan mineral water;
all these blend to create this refreshing new ale.
FOR that party you arc throwing this week-end, be sure
to order Isuan—it mixes wonderfully. You'll be surprised
at the better service the waiters will give you. They
know that ISUAN is a connoisseur's ginger ale— and
they give service accordingly.
