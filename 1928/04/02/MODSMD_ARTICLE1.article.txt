# CAMPAIGN FOR HOOVER SHOWS SURER OUTLOOK
## Senator F. B. Willis' Death Leaves Single Strong G.O.P. Candidate DELEGATES DRIVE BEGINS Stanford Graduate Receives Support of Straw Vote Taken in Colleges 
### Gale Wallace 
With the removal by death of Sen
ator Frank B. Willis in Ohio Friday
night just before he was to address
a crowd of supporters, the outlook of
Herbert Hoover's campaign appears
to be much more certain. Undoubtedly
the country lost one of its great
statesmen when the youngest Senator
from Ohio passed away, and his pass
ing leaves the Republican candidacy
for president with only one apparent
worth-while manâ€”Hoover.
Drive Opens Today
Today the spring drive for presiden
tial convention delegates begins in
earnest throughout Michigan. The
Secretary of Commerce was favored
by leading Republicans to acquire the
pledge of the state's entire thirty
three G.O.P. representatives. There
is no legal promise binding the dele
gates to the meeting, however.

In Ohio, with the death of Willis,
Hoover's backers deplore the fact
that the name of the Ohio Senator
was not removed from the ballot.
Willis' delegates were pledged to sup
port former Governor Frank O. Low
den of Illinois, for second choice.
From the political forecasts that have
been swarming the Buckeye state, the
people have become imbued with the
spirit of paying homage to their great
leader by electing his pledged dele
gates intact as they stand on the pri
mary ballot, it was stated in press dis
patches.
Hoover Favored
Throughout the country Hoover
has been receiving the enthusiastic
support of straw polls in the univer
sities an<J colleges. In the Middle
West, Hoover is running neck-and
neck in the voting, but the Stanford
graduate is leading in the Atlantic
and Pacific seaboard institutions. At
the University of California and at
Mills College Hoover led with large
majorities throughout the polling.
