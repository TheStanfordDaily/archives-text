# SENIOR ENDOWMENT FUND DRIVE STARTS TODAY UNDER CALL
## Request That Subscriptions Be Sent to Committee Before April 10 
### 
Opening the drive for the Class of
1928 Endowment Fund, letters were
placed in the mail last night by Harry
Call, chairman of the endowment
committee, and will reach every mem
ber of the senior class today.

Each senior is asked to pledge as
much as possible, with the under
standing that the amount is to be
applied to the Alumni University
Fund, and to be used as necessity de
mands for the development of Stan
ford, and for its emergency require
ments.
Call asks that the pledges be re
turned as soon as possible, and espe
cially before April 10. After that date,
personal calls will be made on all
seniors who have either not pledged
an amount to the fund, or who have
returned their pledges unsigned, to
signify that no subscription will be
made.
When the Endowment Fund was in
augurated last year by the Class of
1927, a minimum of $5.00 was set for
each personal subscription. The pres
ent senior class has set no minimum,
believing that a larger total will thus
be obtained. While the Class of 1527
pledged more than $700 to be paid
each year, Call expects and requests
that the Class of 1928 will substan
tially exceed that amount.
