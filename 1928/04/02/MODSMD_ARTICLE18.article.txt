# LENINGRAD WILL BUILD HOSPITAL IN MID-AIR

LENINGRAD, April 1. — (U.P.) —
Plans for what is probably the first
"aerial hospital" in the world have
been announced by the director of
the Metclinikoff Hospital here, Pro
fessor Oppel.

The plans involve the construction
of a large platform, hanging from four
huge aerostats, and kept from floating
off into space by a land anchor. This
platform, with glass walls as shields
against the wind, will be kept aloft at
a level suitable for tuberculosis pa
tients.
Professor Oppel explains that the
air which tubercular patients find in
mountain spots exists right in Lenin
grad, or any other city. It is merely
a matter of rising high enough to
locate it. An aerial hospital such as
he proposes, he claims, will be
cheaper and more practicable than
the journeys to strange places usu
ally prescribed by physicians.
