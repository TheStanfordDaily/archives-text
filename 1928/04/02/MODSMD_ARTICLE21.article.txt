# EDITORS OF COLLEGE COMICS OPPOSED TO REPRINTING OF JOKES
## 
### 
Winston Norman, editor of the
Stanford Chaparral and secretary of
the Western Association of College
Comics, was quoted by the Washing
ton Daily as being opposed to the re
printing of "sex" and "gin" jokes ap
pearing in college magazines in a
talk before the convention of the As
sociation held last week.

A committee, headed by the secre
tary of the Association, was formed
to suppress plagiarism of stories and
humor printed in the college maga
zines.
"Our reason for formulating the
committee," Norman is quoted as say
ing, "is that many magazines through
out the country have been guilty of
copying humor from the college
monthlies without permission and
without credit."
Under the plan formulated at the
convention, the secretary will be noti
fied by any of the magazines whose
material has been plagiarized.
It was suggested that each maga
zine syndicate its own articles and
not lay undue stress on objectionable
humor.
