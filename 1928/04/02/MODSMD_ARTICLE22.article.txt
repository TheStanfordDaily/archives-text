### 
ROME, April 1. — (U.P.) —An open
clash between Premier Mussolini,
audacious Fascist chief, and Cardinal
Gasparri, Secretary of State of the
Vatican and as such the Pope's politi
cal lieutenant, was foreseen today as
unavoidable, unless —as those who
realize the seriousness of such an
eventuality hope—an early compro
mise is reached.

Opinion here is divided on which of
the alternatives is the most likely.

The Vatican-Italian Government
situation has become gravely compli
cated within the last week, following
several months of forebodings.

Only a few months ago an early
solution of the differences which had
existed between the Vatican and the
Government since 1870 when the
Pope was shorn of his temporal power
which for centuries had given him
the status of an independent monarch,
was expected.
