# TROJAN WALLS GRUMBLE AS STANFORD TRACKSTERS WIN FROM U.S.C. 77 TO 54
## Dink Performs Ulysses Act To Place Cards Over Hump in South MEET CONTAINS UPSETS Captain Bud Spencer Takes Limelight With Fast Time in Quarter 
### Bob Speers 
Once again the walls of Troy have
crumbled. This time, however, the
catastrophe came not through the
wiles of a certain Ulysses, but
through those of a no less able gen
eral, one Robert L. Templeton, whose
Cardinal horde upset the Trojans to
the extent of 77 points to 54 last Sat
urday afternoou.
The results of the meet as a whole
were not unexpected, but those of
some individual events were. Ward
Edmonds, vaulting 13 feet G inches
to tie Barnes of U.S.C., hadn't been
doped to do so well. And Henry Coe,
stellar Card two-miler who seemed a
cinch to grab first in his event, was
crowded out of a win by Warren
Woodruff, Trojan sophomore.

Johnny Lauritzen proved to the
world that Stanford isn't destitute of
sprinters after all. Lauritzen finished
only a yard behind the fleet Borah to
tie for second in the 220, and took
third in the century.

But it was for Captain Bud Spencer
to step into individual honors again
by winning the 440 in the exceedingly
good time of 48 3-5 seconds. He fin
ished a comfortable distance ahead
of his nearest competitor who was, by
the way, Morrison, Stanford's speedy
sophomore.
Now that the 1928 Stanford-U.S.C.
meet is history the Winged O track
sters and California loom as the next

fore they embark on their eastern 1
