Once again the walls of Troy have
crumbled. This time, however, the

Cardinal horde upset the Trojans to
the extent of 77 points to 54 last Sat

The results of the meet as a whole
were not unexpected, but those of
some individual events were. Ward
Edmonds, vaulting 13 feet G inches

Woodruff, Trojan sophomore.

Johnny Lauritzen proved to the
world that Stanford isn't destitute of
sprinters after all. Lauritzen finished
only a yard behind the fleet Borah to
tie for second in the 220, and took
third in the century.

But it was for Captain Bud Spencer
to step into individual honors again
by winning the 440 in the exceedingly
good time of 48 3-5 seconds. He fin

of his nearest competitor who was, by
the way, Morrison, Stanford's speedy
sophomore.
