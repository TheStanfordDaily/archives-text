# So Much For So Little

Students of Stanford University often think they are paying a pro- 1
digious sum for their education —but they know only the third of it. ihe
money is taken in by the University for tuition, syllabus fees, and what
not, comprises only one-third of the amount it costs to put a member of
the student body through a quarter.
It is useless to argue about the benefits of a college education. There
is still the small group of business men who say a college graduate is
not worth his salt, but the great majority of oldsters appreciate that four
years (or any given number of years) spent at a university are of
infinite value.
There is no doubt that one's earning capacity is increased largely to
the same extent that one's education is increased. Figures taken time
and again prove this to be a fact.
There comes, then, the problem of what we owe our own institution.
What with ever-mounting costs, caused by bettered service and the
lowering value of the dollar, colleges, Stanford included, are always in
need of money. Some time ago, it became a custom at Yale, Princeton,
and others, for the members of each class to turn over each year after
their graduation, a small sum which would go toward the general endow
ment fund, to be used as needed by the University. Last year $500,000.00
was given to Yale in this manner. And all in small individual contribu
tions which even the least prosperous would not miss.
Last year the Class of 1927, instead of making the old-fashioned class
gift, started the policy of University endowments here. This year, the
Class of 1928 is doing the same thing. Around $800.00 has been collected
from the first class already. With class after class using the same policy,
the sums will grow in a proportion that will be of great value to Stanford,
and will enable the administration to carry out its progressive plans in
such a way that we can all continue to be proud to say that we are
Stanford students, or graduates, as the case may be.
Letters have been mailed by the Endowment Committee, today, to
all seniors. These letters request the members of the class to signify the
sums they are willing to put into the yearly fund. It is hoped that all
will see the value of this to the University, and will support it by return
ing the pledge card to the committee as soon as possible.

years (or any given number of years) spent at a university are of
infinite value.
There is no doubt that one's earning capacity is increased largely to
the same extent that one's education is increased. Figures taken time
and again prove this to be a fact.
There comes, then, the problem of what we owe our own institution.
What with ever-mounting costs, caused by bettered service and the
lowering value of the dollar, colleges, Stanford included, are always in
need of money. Some time ago, it became a custom at Yale, Princeton,
and others, for the members of each class to turn over each year after
their graduation, a small sum which would go toward the general endow
ment fund, to be used as needed by the University. Last year $500,000.00
was given to Yale in this manner. And all in small individual contribu
tions which even the least prosperous would not miss.
Last year the Class of 1927, instead of making the old-fashioned class
gift, started the policy of University endowments here. This year, the
Class of 1928 is doing the same thing. Around $800.00 has been collected
from the first class already. With class after class using the same policy,
the sums will grow in a proportion that will be of great value to Stanford,
and will enable the administration to carry out its progressive plans in
such a way that we can all continue to be proud to say that we are
Stanford students, or graduates, as the case may be.
Letters have been mailed by the Endowment Committee, today, to
all seniors. These letters request the members of the class to signify the
sums they are willing to put into the yearly fund. It is hoped that all
will see the value of this to the University, and will support it by return
ing the pledge card to the committee as soon as possible.
Students of Stanford University often think they are paying a pro- 1
digious sum for their education —but they know only the third of it. ihe
money is taken in by the University for tuition, syllabus fees, and what
not, comprises only one-third of the amount it costs to put a member of
the student body through a quarter.
It is useless to argue about the benefits of a college education. There
is still the small group of business men who say a college graduate is
not worth his salt, but the great majority of oldsters appreciate that four
years (or any given number of years) spent at a university are of
infinite value.
