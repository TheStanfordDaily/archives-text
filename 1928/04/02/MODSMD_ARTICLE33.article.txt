Tomorrow The Daily is starting a period of tryouts for students
desiring positions on the editorial staff. Anyone wishing information
on this should be at the office tomorrow at the time appointed (sec story
on front page).
Needless to say, underclassmen are most desirable for the staff, since
it requires some time to teach one not acquainted with a newspaper, and
it is not until the fundamentals have been acquired that the individual is
of value to the paper. However, anyone who is interested may try for
a place on the staff.
The usual method of selection is on a competitive basis, by which the
tryoutees are rated on their comparative abilities, and those most capable
are taken on after they have shown sufficient aptitude in the work.
