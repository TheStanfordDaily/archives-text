# Let's Call It Quits

Every so often this business of riding on the outside of the famed
Peninsula Railway cars, trekking between Palo Alto and the Campus,
pops up. A couple of years ago two accidents of a serious nature resulted
from "hooking" rides from the station to Encina, or from Encina to the
station. Since that time, until very recently, students have used their
heads and walked the short distance.

It seems it shouldn't be necessary to call college students down for
such a childish prank, but if they will insist on so riding they may be
taken to task in a manner more financial than verbal.
