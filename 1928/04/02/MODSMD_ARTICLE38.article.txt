The program offered by the thea
tres in San Francisco this week is
like the menu of a depot lunch coun
ter along about three in the morning
—a little of nearly everything, but
most of it with that "warmed-over"
flavor. "The Desert Song," at the Cur
ran, is the best bet. From all appear
ances it will continue to play to capa
city audiences for some weeks. The
music is very good, and the plot, or
libretto, or whatever you may call it,
is thrill-11-ingly romantic. By the way,
"The Mikado" is scheduled for the
next attraction, though it may be
years before it comes.

Walker Whiteside goes into his sec
ond and last week at the Columbia,
with "The Hindu." This isn't a bad
show at all, and has some amusing
fireworks in it as atmosphere for the
grand Maharajah. It's one of these
mysterious detective things, where
you palpitate for three acts to find
out the Master Mind who stole the
Jewel, and is stirring up all India in
revolt. (Some day somebody will
write a play where a real villain gets
away successfully with his dastardly
designs, but that's a long way off.)
Franc Hale, as Clarence Cartwright,
is very, very beautiful, and White
side's enunciation is as fine as ever.
The supporting cast is excellent, and

includes a playful boa-constrictor,
named Lucifer, who sends matinee
audiences into hysterics and eats
guinea pigs—which is an interesting
way of solving that economic prob
lem! Anyway, if you missed the
"Green Goddess," and like magicians,
and want some Far East antidote, we
suggest this antidote.

At the Community Playhouse, is
"Appearances," by Garland Ander
son, negro bell-hop playwright. It looks
as though the West coat was just be
ginning to get the backwash of the
Harlem flurry some two years ago in
the East. "Appearances" is signifi
cant, in view of the exceptional ac
complishment of the author, and
thanks to Dario Shindell, has an artis
tic end. However, the negroid imagi
nation motivating it is typical and
obvious. There are better plays —but
there have been worse ones.

"Take My Advice," beginning yes
terday at the Alcazar, has stopped the
sweep of "New Brooms" at last, but
"The Shannons of Broadway" are still
going strong. The doors of the Geary
are very dark, and it seems to have
been only a rumor that Jeanne Eagles
was to arrive. And, by the way, the
Green Street Theatre has been re
decorated —just like a real American
commercial Bohemian authentic
French restaurant. —Hallie Keating.

ginning to get the backwash of the
Harlem flurry some two years ago in
the East. "Appearances" is signifi
cant, in view of the exceptional ac
complishment of the author, and
thanks to Dario Shindell, has an artis
tic end. However, the negroid imagi
nation motivating it is typical and
obvious. There are better plays —but
there have been worse ones.

"Take My Advice," beginning yes
terday at the Alcazar, has stopped the
sweep of "New Brooms" at last, but
"The Shannons of Broadway" are still
going strong. The doors of the Geary
are very dark, and it seems to have
been only a rumor that Jeanne Eagles
was to arrive. And, by the way, the
Green Street Theatre has been re
decorated —just like a real American
commercial Bohemian authentic
French restaurant. —Hallie Keating.
SHOWS ABOUT TOWN
The program offered by the thea
tres in San Francisco this week is
like the menu of a depot lunch coun
ter along about three in the morning
—a little of nearly everything, but
most of it with that "warmed-over"
flavor. "The Desert Song," at the Cur
ran, is the best bet. From all appear
ances it will continue to play to capa
city audiences for some weeks. The
music is very good, and the plot, or
libretto, or whatever you may call it,
is thrill-11-ingly romantic. By the way,
"The Mikado" is scheduled for the
next attraction, though it may be
years before it comes.

Walker Whiteside goes into his sec
ond and last week at the Columbia,
with "The Hindu." This isn't a bad
show at all, and has some amusing
fireworks in it as atmosphere for the
grand Maharajah. It's one of these
mysterious detective things, where
you palpitate for three acts to find
out the Master Mind who stole the
Jewel, and is stirring up all India in
revolt. (Some day somebody will
write a play where a real villain gets
away successfully with his dastardly
designs, but that's a long way off.)
Franc Hale, as Clarence Cartwright,
is very, very beautiful, and White
side's enunciation is as fine as ever.
The supporting cast is excellent, and

includes a playful boa-constrictor,
named Lucifer, who sends matinee
audiences into hysterics and eats
guinea pigs—which is an interesting
way of solving that economic prob
lem! Anyway, if you missed the
"Green Goddess," and like magicians,
and want some Far East antidote, we
suggest this antidote.
