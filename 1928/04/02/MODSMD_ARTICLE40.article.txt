UP IN THE AIR
If, up until about 3:45 p.m. Satur
day, Ward Edmonds never seriously >
regarded himself as a future world's
champion pole-vaulter, it was out of
sheer modesty, for after two trieß to
better Sabin Carr's record he had
every eye in the Coliseum watching |
him and every tongue chattering en
couragement as he flung his angu
lar frame skyward on the memorable
third attempt. That time he was with
in a fraction of an elbow of landing in
the sawdust with the cross-stick still
behaving itself properly on top of the
standard.
Tomorrow is another day,
though, and Edmonds might get
the satisfaction of busting the
mark in the 1.C.-4A. when he is
competing against Carr as well as
against Lee Barnes of U.S.C.

Dink Templeton has often be
moaned the fact that there are so
few field and so many track events
in a meet, and now we see clearly
why Dink is down in the mouth. The
field division of his team won every
first place against U.S.C. except that
in the pole-vault, in which Edmonds
tied with Barnes after the irregular
procedure of trying for the record.
Stanford took 26 out of a possible 27
points in the shot-put, discus, and
javelin and in all won 41 points in the
field to the Trojans' 13! Certainly the
Cards are the most consistently good
performers on the greensward that
any American team can boast.
