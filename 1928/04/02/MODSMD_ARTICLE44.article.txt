# EASTERN STATES PASS NO-LIMIT SPEED LAWS
## 
### 
Connecticut and Michigan, which
formerly had maximum speed limits
of 30 to 35 miles per hour, respec
tively, have repealed these laws, and
have enacted "no-limit" speed laws.
The main point of these new laws,
according to the California State
Automobile Association, is that they
provide that drivers must have cars
under complete control at all times.
