# SPORTS OF 1928
## World Conquerors 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Alexander, King of Macedon, found
himself, at 33, the ruler of most of
the known world, and, crying because
there were no more empires to con
quer, died in Babylon in May or June,
323 B.C. Alexander, the pitcher, at the
age of 33, found himself the leading
hurler in the National League, as
far as earned run effectiveness went,
for the second year in succession,
and went on pitching for eight sea
sons more, and is still going strong at
this writing.
In 1915, history hath it, a young
pitcher and outfielder of the Boston
American League club appeared in
his first world series game as a pinch
hitter, batting for Shore in the ninth
inning, but failed to get a hit. Alex
ander, then at the end of his fifth
season with the Phillies, won that
game, 3 to 1. The young pinch-hit
ter's name was George Herman Ruth,
and the two were to meet again in
a world series between the Cardinals
and Yankees eleven years later.

Alexander, as everybody remembers,
won the second game of the 1926
series 6 to 2, keeping Ruth hitless;

he won the sixth game 10 to 2, again
keeping Ruth hitless; and he pitched
the final two and a third innings of
the seventh game, again keeping
Ruth hitless.
Back in the four years, 1914, '15,
'16, and '17, "Alex" averaged more
than 30 wins a season. He won 28
games m 1911 and 27 in 1920, and last
season, when 40 years old, he finished
with 21 wins and 10 losses, and an
earned run average of 2.52. He's one
of the seven wonders of the world,
this Alexander is!
