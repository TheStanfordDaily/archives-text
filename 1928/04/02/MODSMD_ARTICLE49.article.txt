# POSTPONE PROPOSAL TO LOCATE BIG "C" ON WESTWOOD HILLS
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, April 1.—(P.1.P.)
— Pending student suggestions, the
idea of placing a Big "C" on the hills
at Westwood near the site of the
new University of California, has
been indefinitely postponed. Adverse
criticism toward the proposition of
constructing the letter led to this
move.
Feeling that the practice of auto
graphing the highest hill in sight has
become altogether too common, the
traditions committee is now asking
for suggestions for a symbol which
will be more of a significant nature.
