# BLACKWELDER CHANGES GEOLOGY I PROGRAM
## 
### 
Geology 1 is no longer given on the
old basis, announces Professor Eliot
Blackwelder. As now arranged it is
not a lecture course and it can not
be taken for less than five units. The
classwork will be held on a basis of
textbook reading, laboratory work,
and field trips.

The number in the class will be
limited to thirty-five. Geology 1 is in
tended especially for sophomores and
there are no prerequisites.
