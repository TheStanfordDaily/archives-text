# DAILY TO HOLD INITIAL TRYOUT MEETING TODAY
## Trial Period Involves Office Work; Previous Training Is Not Required All Aspiring Journalists Are Urged to Come Out for Reportorial Work 
### 
The Daily editorial staff is in need
of new writers, with or without pre
vious journalistic experience. For this
reason the second tryouts of the col
lege year are being called, and all
aspiring reporters, underclassmen and
upperclassmen alike, will be wel
comed at the Daily office today at
1:30 o'clock at the initial meeting of
the spring quarter tryoutees.
How long the trial period will last
has not yet been determined, nor will
it be until it has been seen how many
try out and how close competition is.
The women's editor and the manag
ing editor will have charge of the
tryouts, making assignments of news
and feature stories, judging work
turned in and finally choosing the re
porters to be taken on the staff. For
the information of those who intend
to come out, it may be said that the
first week of the tryouts requires a
good deal of time to be spent about
the Daily office, during which famil
iarization with the routine may be
gained.
Freshmen particularly will be ex
pected to try out, for this spring's
trial period affords members of the
1931 class their last opportunity of
getting in the race for the highest
places on the staff during their sen
ior year. However, an attempt will be
made, in the case of upperrlassmen
showing experience on other college
newspapers, to give due consideration
to their abilities.
