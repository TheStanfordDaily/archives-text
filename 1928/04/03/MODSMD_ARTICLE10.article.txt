# CARDINAL FROSH NINE PRACTICES TO MEET U.C. BEAR CUB TEAM
## 
### 
With the opening game of the Card
Freshman-Bear Cub baseball series
but four days off, announcement has
come from Coach Husky Hunt that
Norman Hedge, stellar third-baseman
on the yearling nine, has been de
clared ineligible. Hedge has played a
brilliant game all season and has
been one of the mainstays of the
babes' somewhat depleted hitting
force.
Coach Hunt has not announced the
successor of Hedge. It is probable that
Fred Goodell, who was covering the
third sack very early in the season
and who was ruled out because of
scholarship, will be reinstated and
will be eligible to play. However, if
Goodell should continue to be ineligi
ble, it is probable that Hunt will be
forced to shift his whole present in
field lineup.
The Stanford team will begin prac
tice tonight for their first California
contest which will be played here at
2:30 o'clock Saturday on the varsity
diamond. Captain John Hunken de
clares that the men are in good con
dition after their long lay-off and
should easily round into their early
season form in the few days of prac
tice.
Comparative scores indicate that
the teams will be very evenly matched
although the Cardinal nine is given
a slight edge by most observers. Cali
fornia has a powerful batting attack
which should bo a test for the crack
Stanford defensive machine.
