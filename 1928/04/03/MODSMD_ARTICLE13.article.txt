# REPRINT PRIVILEGES OF COLLEGE HUMOR
## SCORED BY EDITORS Western Association Moves To Refuse Contracts With Magazine 
### 
Declaring themselves to be opposed to
the editorial policy and general tone of
the College Ilumor magazine, the West
ern Association of College Comics, which
convened at the University of Washing
ton last week, passed a resolution to re
fuse the magazine reprint rights at the
expiration of the present contracts. Sole
reprint rights are now held by the maga
zine.
Winston Norman, editor of the Stan
ford Chaparral, explained the stand of
the association on his return from the
convention yesterday. In the opinion of
the comic editors the material used by
College Humor gave a false impression
of college life and added to the popular
misconception of student activities. It
was declared at the convention that Col
lege Humor, with its cheap exploitation
of supposed college life, furnishes pub
licity which no university desires and
was intended for readers of a lower
class.

Commenting on the move, Norman
said, "The matter of choice of material
does not affect Chaparral much, since our
policy is to avoid questionable jokes and
to go light 011 liquor as humor material."
Chaparral had some grievances, however.
"Last year College Humor sent a motion
picture unit to Stanford which made a
film, without the permission of Univer
sity authorities, that will be cheap pub
licity. In spite of our objection, they
have stated intention of using Chaparral
material as subtitles.
"College Humor has committed breach
es of contract by syndicating reprints
from college magazines to newspapers
without permission. They plan to re
lease college comic material through ra
dio and phonograph, although the con
tracts with them do not include such
rights," Norman said.
"The break with College Humor will
involve a certain amount of financial
loss from reprints and advertising," ad
mitted Richard Guggenhime, manager,
"but I feel that the loss is well repaid
by the fact that we are no longer sub
ject to College Humor's exploitation."
