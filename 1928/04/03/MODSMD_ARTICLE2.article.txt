# FORTY TEAMS ENTER TROPHY COMPETITION IN MURAL BASEBALL
## 
### 
Forty teams will enter competition this
year for the intramural baseball trophy
play which will start on April 9 under
the schedule announced yesterday by
Charles W. Davis.
Eight leagues of five teams each have
been formed with every team playing
once a week. Following five weeks' com
petition the leaders in the eight leagues
will play off for the All-University in
tramural baseball championship.
Beta Theta Pi, winner of the cham
pionship last year, is favored to repeat,
having practically the same team back.
Encina teams will be considerably weak
er this year because under a new ruling
no varsity or freshman squad men will
be allowed to compete. Players who have
been dropped from the two squads will
be ineligible.
Four diamonds have been prepared
near the old polo field. Games will be
scheduled every afternoon on these fields
at 4:15 o'cloqk. As usual the games will
last seven innings. Games postponed on
account of weather conditions will be
played at the end of the season, and not
during the present schedule.
