SAN DIEGO, April 2. — (U.P.) —
Some concern for the safety of Col
onel Charles A. Lindbergh was ex
pressed when he had not arrived at
Mahoney Airport at 3 p.m.
The air hero and three companions,
flying a Ryan monoplane, left Phoe
nix, Ariz., at 12:15 mountain time and
was expected here not later than
3 p.m.
While his lateness led to reports
that his plane was down it was point
ed out that he was expected at
Tucson today but instead avoided that
city and went on to Phoenix and that
he might have landed at some other
city in southern California to evade
a welcoming crowd here.
The object of his trip here was to
claim a new Ryan monoplane which
he ordered for April 1.
A check of airports at Yuma, Ariz.,
El Centro, Inyo, and Santa Barbara,
revealed that Colonel Charles A. Lind
bergh had not reached any of those
points late today.
