Rudderless Ships
How about having a definite policy on this matter of electing varsity
sports captains?
Two years ago there was a great hullabaloo raised in an effort to dis
continue the election of captains until after each sport, at which time the
most worthy member of the team should be chosen honorary captain.
This was defeated. It was defeated because there were enough people
with foresight who could see the muddle into which the respective teams
would be thrown with such a plan in effect.
However, in spite of the decision against such a method, three major
sports this year started in with no captains. These were, of course, foot
ball, basketball, and baseball. After considerable scrambling around, the
football team finally elected a captain. Previous to this selection, the team
was like a rudderless ship. There were doubts in the minds of the players
—should they do what the "captain of the day" said, was Joe or John or
jerry finally going to be chosen, or did they have a chance themselves?
Such a situation was bound to reduce teamwork. In fact, it did.
After Hal McCreery was chosen, however, the team worked smoothly,
the questions were all answered, and they all pulled together (to use a
good old rotarian term).
Next came basketball season, and, not profiting by the experience of
the football team, the hoopmen put off selecting their captain until the
end. While the poor showing (and it must be admitted the playing wasn't
good) cannot be attributed solely to the lack of a leader, still that had a
great deal to do with it.
Both the football and basketball teams have seen their errors and have
elected captains for next year already. This is as it should be. Track is
the only major sport which had its leaedr chosen for this year, and is
perhaps the one least in need of one.
There now remains of the major sports only baseball which cannot
boast a captain. Some say this is caused by politics and some say the
coaches are at fault. It is true that the baseball team is good, but it still
remains a fact that there is a great deal of unrest among the members of
the team as to who deserves the captaincy, and who will get it. They
would all be a lot better off if the man were chosen.
If mere custom is not strong enough to elect captains before the season
opens, some provision should be instituted making this compulsory. If the
athletes are backward about taking a definite step, then it is up to the
Executive Committee. The whole thing should be straightened out so it
will be definite in the future.
