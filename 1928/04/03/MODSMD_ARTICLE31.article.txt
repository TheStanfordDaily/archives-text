# College Comics vs. College Humor
## 
### 
In Seattle last week, assembled in their annual convention, editors and
managers of eight Pacific Coast college comic magazines voted unani
mously to break all relations with "College Humor" at the expiration of
their present contracts. Stanford Chaparral and the California Pelican
>verc foremost in advocating the move.
This means that no longer will "College Humor" be allowed to re
print material from Pacific Coast comics. VVe hope that this is only the
beginning of a movement by universities throughout the country to black
list this and other professional magazines which purport to picture "au
thentic campus life," but which actually aim their material at a class of
readers who are eager and ready to swallow any perversion of the truth
which is sufficiently flavored with excitement.
Odd though it may be, millions of people in this country derive their
sole idea of higher education from the "College Humor" type of magazine,
and from such inane motion pictures as the "Calford" series with which
Palo Alto theatre patrons are too familiar. There is comfort in the thought
that only a low class of audience gives credence to such bosh; yet it is
bothersome to think that some millions of Americans believe implicitly
that a college is a sort of adolescent kindergarten wherein professors are
absent-minded fogies and wherein students wear Oxford Bags, never look
at a book, spend all their time necking, frequenting roadhouses or throw
ing fits at football games, drinking nothing but gin, and wearing rooters'
hats night and day.
The evil of misrepresentation of college life has gone far enough. We
can be glad that Chaparral has pioneered in the movement against it.
