Another laurel in the hat of Stanford's democratic spirit! The queen
flunked out!
Yes sir, the queen-to-have-been of the Masque Ball is not with us.
Tity the poor king". Ile had his lady all chosen, the crowns were about to
be set, and everything was lovely in the kingdom. And then to have
such a catastrophe. Was ever a king more sorely tried, or a potential
queen more bitterly disappointed?
it all goes to show that not even a member of the royal family has a
"pull" on the Stanford campus. Ah, well, we can at least l>e thankful that
nations shall not come to blows, and that a new queen can be invited.
