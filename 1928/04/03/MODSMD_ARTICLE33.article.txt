SUCH POPULARITY MUST—
Herbert Hoover's chances for the
Republican nomination of the presi
dency grow stronger day by day. With
the rebuke administered Senator
Fess of Ohio, colleague of the late
Senator Willis, for his "draft Cool
idge" propaganda by the chief execu
tive himself, Hoover sentiment in the
communities of the nation becomes
more apparent.
The Secretary of Commerce is not
a professional politician. His chief op
ponents in the Republican race
breathe and flourish in the atmos
phere of intrigue and guile. Plain and
straightforward in his actions and
service to the country through the
medium of his office, the Secretary
has gained support by these attri
butes.
The recent investigations into the
oil slush fund and the past inquiries

into the sinks of iniquity of the Re
publican Party have been brought
forth by Hoover's opponents as cam
paign arguments because he has not
come forth with a fiery statement
against the party's practices. The fact
that Hoover did not see fit to burst
into print with denunciations rather
added to his prestige than diminished
it.
An attempt to raise dissension in
the ranks of the Secretary by bring
ing up the liquor question for disserta
tion was made in the Senate. Senator
Neely of West Virginia, and a Demo
crat, took a fling at Hoover for his
so-called evasiveness in a statement
on the \fet and dry proposition. This
was in contradiction to Hoover's
stand for the enforcement of the pro
hibition law, and illustrate only one
of the futile efforts that have been
made to curb his popularity.
