It's really too early in the quarter to be
thinking seriously of books, but for mo
ments of levity, "Heavenly Discourses,"
by C. E. S. Wood, is worthy of attention.
The book of short dialogues and of var
ied dramatis personae is published in a
cheap edition by the Viking Press, and
sold at various restaurants and so on.
The dramatic dialogue form can be very
bad, or can be fairly amusing, and this
set contains a little of both.
Mr. Wood is a local author, or poet, or
writer—depending on your reaction to his
work —and this geographic relation makes
the book also interesting. Most of the
dialogues, admitted in the preface, were
written during the period of the war, and
are unfortunately a little dated. The ones
on prohibition, on Anthony Comstock, on
humorists in heaven, and on general phil
osophical questions, however, are inter
esting and amusing.
Epigrams Help

A few of the epigrams help to lighten
the dialogues enormously, and in spite of
the subject matter, which may offend
some readers' sense of the fastidious,
technically Mr. Wood has done very well
by his blasphemies. The nice way he has
adapted his profanity is rather significant
of his attitude throughout.
And speaking of critics, and blasphe
mies, Dr. William Clyde DeVane has re
cently published "Browning's Parley
ings" (Yale University Press). This vol
ume, with "One Word More on Brown
ing" (Stanford University Press), by
Mrs. Frances Theresa Russell, of our
own University, is heralded by the New
York Tribune as "clearing the way for a
new critical biography of Browning."
"These two books should give pause to
the Browningites' idolatrous admiration.
Apparently he is going to be debunked
and made to take his chances, as have the
other poets, in the field of criticism."
