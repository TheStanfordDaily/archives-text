MR. TEMPLETON IN AMSTERDAM
Sometime after the Daily expired
last quarter announcement was made
in New York that Dink eTmpleton
would be one of ten coaches to direct
the American Olympic track and field
team this summer.
Stanford is pretty proud of this
honor to the boy coach, especially
since Dink deserved it as much as
any coach we know of. This will be
only the second Olympiad to have
been held since Dink graduated from
college.
Templeton doesn't yet know
what he will have charge of, but
probably he will fatch some of
the field performers. He is a wiz
ard at developing field men, as
witness the strength in this de
partment exhibited by his teams
during the past few years.
It will be especially pleasant
for the Stanford men who make
the team to have their own coach
on hand ready with his advice.

While the subject is warm, we
might as well remark about who from
Stanford we think will make the
Olympic team. Bob King ought to be
pretty much a cinch. Ward Edmonds,
too, looks as if he has a stateroom
on some transatlantic liner waiting
for him. Krenz is a possibility in the
shot and a pretty good bet in the dis
cus. Bud Spencer has the ability—
the question is will he be able to
demonstrate it at the Boston trials.
Zombro and Dyer both are chances
in the broad jump; the former we
consider an A-l possibility. Elsewhere,
it is not easy to fix upon likely men.
Ross Nichols might turn the trick in
the high hurdles, and Clarence West,
who is a good competitive athlete,
might do the same In the lows.
That would be quite a few men
to place on an Olympic team, but
then, they're good, as the East
will have ample opportunity of
learning when the 1.C.-4A. comes
around.
