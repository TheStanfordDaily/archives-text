# CARD BALL PLAYERS BREAK EVEN IN TILTS AGAINST SOUTHERNERS
## Win Over Bakersfield Team Gives Stanford Three Victories on Trip 
### 
With three wins and two defeats to
its credit the Cardinal baseball nine
returned to the campus yesterday
after a five-game invasion to South
ern California. Coach Harry Wolter's
charges broke even in the conference
games with U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., tak
ing one game and dropping one in
each series. On the way South, the
Cards out-slugged the Kern River
Standards, a semi-professional team,
in a hectic nine-inning game at
Bakersfield to win 14 to 13.
In a game conspicuous by the ab
sence of smart baseball and the
prominence of errors, Stanford was
able to convert ten safe hits into
twelve runs March 27 to gain a 12
to 7 victory over the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Though socking out fourteen hits, the
Bruins were able to cross the home
plate but seven times. Stanford
showed a classy infield, and the Card
battery of Phillipi to Sypher proved
effective in the pinches.
Bruins Win
Both teams "came out of the mist"
the next day and played heads-up ball,
the Bruins squeezing out a 1 to 0 win.
"Count" Sobieski, Stanford liurler,
pitched masterful ball throughout and
only twenty-three U.C.L.A. men faced
him in eight innings. Not one of
these was able to garner a safe hit.
The Bruins executed a bit of clever
baseball in the sixth which gave them
the only tally of the game.
This game was a tough one for the
Cards to lose. They touched the Bruin
hurler for five hits and made but one
error, as compared with the three
errors and no hits of the U.C.L.A.
outfit.
Cards Lose to U.S.C.
After a day's lay-off, Stanford
swung into action again on Bovard
Field March 30 against the Univer
sity of Southern California, dropping
a close 2 to 0 pitchers' duel to the
Trojans. The Cards knocked out the
ball for five safe hits, and the Tro
jans batted out but two. As in the
U.C.L.A. contest, however, the Stan
ford batsmen were the heavier hitters
but were unable to convert their hits
into runs. Kern pitched for the Cards,
while Shalberg did the tossing for the
Southern California nine.
In the fifth and last game of the
Southern tour, Stanford evened the
score with the Trojans by defeating
them 8 to 5 in a wild tilt. A three-run
rally in the ninth frame brought the
victory to the Cardinals. A 5 to 0 ad
vantage which Stanford had chalked
up in the fifth inning had dwindled
before the determined batting of the
U.S.C. team until the eighth inning
when the count was evened. Frank
Wilton's homer in the ninth put the
game on ice. Lewis pitched a fine
game for Stanford until the eighth,
when he weakened, and Philippi re
placed him.
