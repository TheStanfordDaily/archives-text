"Resolved, That American investors
and their investments in foreign nations
should be protected only by the govern
ment of the nation in which the invest
ment is made" is the subject of a debate
to be held here with the University of
Oregon team on Thursday night. The
Stanford varsity team, composed of Rob
ert Sharp and Ronald Anderson, will up
hold the affirmative.
"The subject is interesting and timely,"
said Stanley Weigel, debating coach,
"since it touches the whole policy of
American intervention, especially the re
cent trouble in Nicaragua."
