# SPORTS OF 1928
## Father and Son 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"Like Father, like Son," is a shop-worn
expression in connection with sports, but
what else can you say in the case of Joe
and Ray Ruddy of the New York Ath
letic Club? For Joe, the father, was a
famous all-around athlete in his day, win
ning 750 trophies in twenty-six different
sports over a period of thirty-five years,
and still plays a mean game of water
polo and handball, while Ray, the son, is
one of the best of the younger generation
of shimmers, and hopes for a place on
the United States Olympic team.
Young Ray Ruddy is now, unless plans

slip, competing for the N.Y.A.C. in the
men's national indoor swimming cham
pionship at Buffalo. Ray established new
free-style marks last year for 600, 700,
and 800 yards. At that time he was only
fifteen years old. Then he won the Na
tional A.A.U. long distance champion
ship (about three and one-half miles) and
the junior half-mile title. His best chance
for making the Olympic team is in the
1,500-meter event.
Ray also plays, now and then, on the
N.Y.A.C. water-polo team, which is cap
tained by his illustrious 48-year-old Dad.

The two went down to Annapolis not so
long ago and beat brother Joe, Jr., who
played on the Navy tank team. Joe, Jr.,
and Ray are great-great-grandsons of
the famous Joe McGrath, former heavy
weight champion of Ireland. If they keep
on like their irrepressible father, they will
be winning national championships twenty
years from now. Ray is a fine swimmer,
no doubt about that. And so is his old
man!
