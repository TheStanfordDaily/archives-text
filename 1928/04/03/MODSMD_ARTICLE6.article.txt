# CARD FIRST-YEAR MEN DEFEAT PREP SCHOOL TEAM IN TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman track team
rounded out its schedule of early sea
son meets by decisively defeating the
combined San Francisco prep school
squad on March 17. A meet against
teams from the Sacramento Junior
and San Jose Teachers college was
postponed because of rain.
The only competition before the
Little Big meet will be the interclass
relays scheduled for Saturday morn
ing. The 1931 men will resume prac
tice this afternoon for the relays and
the California meet on April 13.
A victory in the California contest
is almost a certainty with the Bear
Cubs given possible firsts in only two
events, the mile run and javelin.
Mossman in the mile has run off the
event in 4 minutes 30 seconds but will
find stiff competition against Dick
Wright and John Parker, who have
equal records for the season. With
three California men doing over 170
feet in the javelin, Perelli-Minetti,
lone frosh hope, will have stiff com
petition. Freshman stars have bet
tered all other California marks for
the season.
