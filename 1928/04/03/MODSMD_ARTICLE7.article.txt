# ILLUSTRATED MAP OF CAMPUS IS PUBLISHED BY UNIVERSITY PRESS
## 
### 
An illustrated map of the Stanford
campus has been drawn by Delia Taylor,
'24, and published by the Stanford Uni
versity Press. This map, which is the
first of its kind to be made of the Stan
ford community, shows both the past and
the present of the University, and indi
cates proposed lines of future growth.
The map is printed in the four natural
colors of the campus on a high grade of
bond paper. There is also a limited edi
tion on a heavy grade of parchment.
Miss Taylor has taken as her model
an airplane view of the University from
the foot of Palm Drive. She has included
practically every detail of the Univer
sity's physical plant and of the halls and
residences that surround it.
