# Pretentious Settings To Be Featured At English Club Play
## 
### 
Settings and costumes for "Caesar and
Cleopatra," by Bernard Shaw, which will
be given on April 13 by the English Club,
will be the most pretentious and elabo
rate since the production of "The Green
Goddess," according to E. Leslie Kiler,
designer.
Eight sets will be used in the play, two
interiors and six exteriors. In order to
better convey the Egyptian atmosphere, a
special proscenium in Egyptian architec
ture has been built in the Assembly Hall.
The scenes to be shown include Cleo
patra's courtyard, a desert scene, two
throne rooms, a lighthouse, and the edge
of the quay at Alexandria.
"Egyptian architecture must be repre
sented by solid and permanently built
sets," Kiler explained, "and we have used
stairs and platforms to gain this effect."
The sets will be constructed in the mod
ern style, merely suggesting the scene
and omitting the minor details. Several
units will be utilized in more than one
set by shifting positions to form a new
composition.
Chrysella Duncan Kiler has charge of
the colorful costuming. Both Egyptian
and Roman clothes are to be worn in the
play.
