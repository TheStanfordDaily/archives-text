# K.A., SIGMA NU FIVES MEET IN MURAL FINALS
## Epidemic of Measles Caused Postponement of Tilt Planned for March HASTINGS CUP AT STAKE Finalists Win Close Games From Indians, Bull Pen Cage Quintets 
### 
Sigma Nu will meet the Kappa
Alpha quintet tonight in the long-de
layed tilt for the All-University Intra
mural basketball championship. Fol
lowing stiff workouts by both teams
during the last few days, indications
point to a strenuous battle when the
two fives take the floor at 7:30 o'clock
in the Pavilion.
The championship game which was
■scheduled for last quarter was post
poned because of a slight epidemic of
measles at the Kappa Alpha house.
Kappa Alpha advanced to the finals
by defeating the Indians 18 to 15.
Sigma Nu won the right to compete
by winning from Bull Pen by a 22 to
19 score. Both finalists showed fine
form in their last contests.
The winner of the game tonight will
be awarded the Hastings Trophy. It
was donated by the San Francisco
clothing firm three years ago under
the stipulation that a team, to retain
the trophy permanently, would have
to win it twice. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
•captured it in 1925, Kappa Sigma in
1926, and Sigma Chi won it last year,

but none of these was in the running
for the big silver basketball this year.
Plaques have been awarded the
winners of the nine leagues and med
als have been given to the members

of Bull Pen, Indians, Delta Chi, El
Toro, Theta Xi, Encina IW, and
lireakers, winners o£ the league
championships.
Starting lineups for tonight's game
are as follows:
Kappa Alpha Sigma Nu
