United Press Staff Correspondent
ROME, April 3—(U.P.)—The Vati
can unbent to make the first move
today to avert a seriously threatened
crisis with Premier Mussolini, outspo
ken Fascist chief, over the old differ
ence between church and state which
has kept Popes for nearly sixty years
voluntary prisoners inside their Vati
can headquarters.

The official Vatican organ, the Ob
servatore Romano, in an editorial de
signed to soften recent manifesta
tions against the Italian government,
said that recent remarks by the Pope,
though outwardly reproachful, were
constantly paternal; because he "real
ized that he was the common father
of all and never was hostile to any
body."

But an even more significant de
velopment occurred when it was un
derstood that the Pope, upon advice
of his ministers, had postponed pub
lication of an encyclical in which he
had intended to give his views on the
nationalism question.

Now, it is understood, the encyclical
will be published during the second
half of the month. It is said reliably
that the document will be a further
condemnation of the French Royalist
Party, Action Francaise, and will con
demn its policies on thirty-two doc
trinal points.

The most recent friction between
the Vatican and Mussolini's govern
ment came when the Pope complained
that the government was monopoliz
ing the education of youth and the
failure of members of the Catholic
party —allied in politics with the
Fascist party—to visit the Pope was
criticized.
