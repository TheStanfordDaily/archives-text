# AL SMITH BATTLES FOR DELEGATES IN WISCONSIN POLLING
## N.Y. DEMOCRATS LEAD Republican Vote Is Divided Between "Old Guard," LaFollette Party 
### 
MADISON, Wis., April 3.—(U.P.)—
Although only the names of Senator
Frank W. Norris, Nebraska, Repub
lican, and Senator James A. Reed,
Missouri, Democrat, appeared for the
preferential ballot for president, in
terest in today's primary centered on
delegates to the national conventions.

Among the Republicans, the battle
for delegates was sharply divided be
tween the Old Guards, who have an
uninstructed slate of 26, and the La-
Foleltte Progressives, who have the
same number pledged to support Nor
ris for president.

Democratic voters face a more com
plex problem in selection of their
delegates with Governor Alfred E.
Smith of New York apparently hold
ing two complete slates of delegates
pledged to his support. Four delegates
at large pledged to Senator Thomas
J. Walsh, Montana, a Dry Democrat,
also are in the field.

D. Leigh Colvin, New York, and
Charles H. Randall, Los Angeles, two
Prohibition Party candidates for
president, were entered in the pri
mary for a complimentary vote.
Voters were expected to express
preference for candidates other than
Norris and Reed by writing in the
names of their choice on the majority
party ballots.
