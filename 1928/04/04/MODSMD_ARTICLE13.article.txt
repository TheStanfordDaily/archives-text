SAN FRANCISCO. April 3.—( U.P.)
—Before record-breaking crowds, the
1928 split season of the Pacific Coast
League got under way today in four
California cities.
Ball parks in San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Oakland, and Sacramento
were jammed almost to capacity long
before the usual opening day festivi
ties took place.

More than 16,000 fans watched the
San Francisco Seals and the Seattle
Indians clash at Recreation Park here
in a 13-inning game. The Seals copped
a 3 to 2 verdict in the last inning
when Crosseti scored from third after
Olney, Seattle substitute first base
man, muffed a throw.

At Los Angeles the Angels won
from Portland, 11 to 5. Barfoot went
the entire distance for the Angels
while the Beavers were forced to use
Cole, Wetzel, and Yerke.
Hollywood and Oakland met before
a large crowd at Oakland and turned
in another 3 to 2 game with the
Southerners on the long end of the
score. Both teams gathered eight hits.

Sacramento got off to a flying start
by defeating the San Francisco Mis
sions at Sacramento, 6 to 3. The
Senators hit Pillette, Eckert, and
Gomes for twelve hits, while Ray
Keating allowed the Missions only
five.
