# LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP AT STAKE IN CARD-S.C. TILT ON LOCAL FIELD
## Varsity Nine, Trojans Likely Contenders for Title, Have Split Series 
### Frank Whiteley 
When Stanford's varsity baseball
team meets the Southern California
horseliide tossers in the third and de
ciding game of the series on the local
diamond tomorrow afternoon at 3:15
o'clock the Cards will be playing with
a conference championship as the
probable reward. Each team has won
one game in the series, the Trojans
taking the first 2-0 in Los Angeles
last week and dropping the second
S-5.

It looks as if U.S.C. and Stanford
will be the principal contenders for
the California Collegiate Baseball
Association championship this year.
Though St. Mary's has a slightly
higher standing now than Stanford,
the Cardinal nine won the 192S series
from the Gaels. U.S.C. has won three

conference games and lost one, while
the Cards have won four and lost
three. However, the Trojans have
eight games yet to play, as compared
with the four which remain on the
Stanford schedule.

Coach Harry Wolter has as good a
team this year as has ever been de
veloped on the Farm. The in fielders
and outfielders have played classy
ball and seem to be getting better all
the time.

The Card pitching staff is such that
it would delight the most pessimistic
of coaches. "Doug" Lewis, "Count"
Sobieski, Bob Philippi, and Gene Kern
have all pitched first-rate ball this
season. It is problematical as to which
of these four will be given the task
of hurling the game against Southern
California tomorrow. Philippi hurled
a winning game against the U.C.L.A.
Bruins, while Lewis was on the
mound in a win against U.S.C. Though
pitching a no-hit game against the
Bruins, Sobieski was beaten. In much
the same way Kern lost a close game
to the Trojans, after allowing them
but two hits. Besides these four Wol
ter has three promising moundsmen
in Reynolds, Riese, and Simpkins.
Next Saturday Stanford and Cali
fornia will play the first game of their
annual series at Berkeley.
