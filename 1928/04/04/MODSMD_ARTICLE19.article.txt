# NOTIFY PUBLISHERS OF CHANGE IN ADDRESSES
## 
### 
Permanent residents on the campus are
urged by Stanford postofficc authorities
to notify publishers of magazines and
newspapers of changes in their box num
bers and street addresses.

Information should be sent to the pub
lishers as soon as possible to avoid con
fusion when the postofficc changes em-

ployees during the summer vacation. Mail |
should be addressed to Stanford Univer- j
sity, Calif., not to Palo Alto.
