# UNIVERSITY CONCERT SERIES FOR 1928-29 OFFICIALLY APPROVED
## 
### 
MEXICO CITY. April 3.—(U.P.)—
A concert series for 1928-29 was defi
nitely approved by the Executive Com
mittee last night, and Gertrude Baker,
manager, was given two weeks in which
to secure figures for next year's season.

Because of the deficit this year, a $6000
limit was set for the 1928-29 series. The
artists on this year's program were se
cured for $7600. Student management
will continue as before, and work on a
drive to promote the success of the series
next year will commence soon.

Pledges of support will be distributed
at the concert Thursday, April 12, when
the Alfred Hertz San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra will present the final
number of this year's series.
