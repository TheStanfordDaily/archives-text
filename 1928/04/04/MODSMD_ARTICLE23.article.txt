Face Difficult Team

Because of these facts the Stan
ford trio, though seasoned debaters,
will have a difficult task confronting
them in opposing the arguments of
the Filipinos.

speaker, has been active in local for
ensic circles for the past three years.
He has met teams from California
and U.S.C., and was chosen a member
of the Joffre debate team during his
sophomore year. He was one of the
men to make the Eastern tour and
winner of the Joffre Debate medal
last year. His easy, fluent delivery
was heard in the recent debate with
Cambridge University.

Experienced Debaters
Gordon Shallenberger, the second
speaker, has debated for two years
and engaged in meets with Nevada
and California. Virgil Whitaker, a
sophomore, debated against California
on the freshman team last year and
against U.S.C. this year. He is a logi
cal and convincing speaker.

The Philippine squad is composed
of Teodoro T. Evangelista, Jacinto C.
Borja, and Pedro Camus. Admission
to the debate will be 25 cents with
student body card, or 50 cents for the
