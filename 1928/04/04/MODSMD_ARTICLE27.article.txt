# Dead Wood
## 
### 
Philomathia Literary Society, a 45-year-old organization at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, has just closed its doors. This follows closely on
the announcement from Nebraska that its superfluous honor societies have
all been banned. The literary society went out of existence because "few
men find time .... to attend our meetings," which meant that it had
lost interest for them. The honor societies went out at Nebraska because

there were too many useless organizations.
These are examples of a very healthy tendency that has been noted for
some years, the gradual elimination of organizations that have no function
and serve no purpose whatsoever. Of course, while many have been elim
inated, it must also be admitted that many have been started. This is in
evitable so long as we have the "joiner" with us. However, from all re
ports, it seems that the elimination far exceeds the creation, and this is j
good.
Some people seem to take great delight in going back to the home town
and mentioning that they were members of such-and-such and so-and-so
organizations, which bodies very probably have no recognition at all,
except of name, on their own campus. This may be very fine, but it is
much finer to have a few societies which do mean something, and it is
almost impossible to have ones that amount to anything when there is so
much dead wood littering up the grounds.
If we looked around in the nooks and crannies of the Stanford campus
we might find considerable of such dead wood.
