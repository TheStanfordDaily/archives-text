Propaganda has become a high art, and today to find the truth in mat
ters of political or social concern short of an exhaustive investigation
approximates futility.
Nicaragua is by all odds the enigma of the hour. And what is it all
about? The Marines are doing their best to kill Sandino. Who is San
dino ? Pick up one publication and you will learn that he is a bandit; pick
up another and, presto, he becomes the Liberator of Nicaragua, a Bolivar
of Central America.

Of longer standing but no more accuracy are the accounts of the
Soviet regime in Russia. Prejudice has so colored news from Russia that
an honest evaluation of the Bolsheviki experiment is almost impossible.
Some light on the inaccuracy in this particular case is found in a recent
article by a former member of the staff of one of the leading English
dailies in which he reveals how the "Riga dispatches" were written 011 his
typewriter in London. As British opinion was strongly anti-Red at the
time, the "dispatches" were frequently reporting peasant uprisings which
never happened.
Propaganda is of course by no means confined to the press. Witness
the uproar caused by Katherine Mayo's book "Mother India." The book
was hardly off the presses before proof was being read on books written
to disprove her statements.
The list might be extended indefinitely, and nothing has been said
about the oil scandals. The moral in all this is not difficult to find : reserve
your opinions if you would be truly wise.
