# The 						Philippines
## 
### 
When the varsity debate team meets the representatives of the Uni
versity of the Philippines tonight, there will be an intelligent discussion
on a topic that is timely and interesting. The question of granting inde
pendence to the Philippines will probably be one of the heaviest planks in
the party platforms for the coming presidential race. Thinking Americans
will welcome the opportunity of hearing the Islands' side of the question,
expounded by university men whose opinions and facts are not to be con
fused with the hollow talk and twisted logic of politics.
We hope that the short visit to Stanford will be enjoyable to the Uni
versity of the Philippines squad and their coach.
