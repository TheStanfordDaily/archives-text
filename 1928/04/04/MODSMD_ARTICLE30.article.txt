# Standards

### 
The University of Minnesota has taken a stand against allowing any
leniency to students who arc unable to keep strictly up to standard be
cause of having to work all or part of their way. I his is the essence of a
dispatch by the New Student Service.
In so doing Minnesota is partly correct. The attitude was brought
about because so many students were merely using work as an excuse for
poor grades, whereas they weren't working at all. However, to inflict this
upon students who arc honestly working in an attempt to got a collcgc
education is a mistake.
People who are working in order to get money to s'tudy further are
usually deriving more actual good out of what studying they do, even if it
be too little to make good grades, than those who force themselves to re
member items 1, 2, and 3 on the syllabus, merely to stay in college so that
they may enjoy themselves. After all, the college is intended (or was)
for the purpose of teaching. Why not give the honest workers the better
chance ?
