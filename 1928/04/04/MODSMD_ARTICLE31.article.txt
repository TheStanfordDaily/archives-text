"The Campus," by Robert Cooley
Angell. D. Appleton & Co.
"The Campus," a study of "contem
porary undergraduate life in the
American University," comes particu
larly to our attention —not only be
cause it bears Dr. Wilbur's recom
mendation upon the dust cover, but
because it is a keen and conscientious
analysis of our immediate environ
ment. The work is concerned primar
ily with the weaknesses in college
life today, a few of its virtues. The
problems of undergraduate life, such
as co-education, fraternities, sorori
ties, distractions of athletics, extra
curriculum activities, are discussed —
and criticized constructively.
Angell sees undergraduate life as a
"distinct and particular phase of the
general social process," and his analy
sis is based on the recognition of this
type of life as an organic whole. This
is a comprehensive view of college
life that is extraordinarily unique
when we consider the flood of litera
ture upon the problems of education —
a flood that is predominantly made up
of waves that lap obscure beaches,
rather than directed against the main
issue.

Students Have Three Wishes
He analyzes the average under
graduate's motives into three prime
desires: for individual prestige, for
present self-expression, and for suc
cess in later life. Their reactions to
university life are complicated by the
influences of certain national charac
teristics of Americans —externalism,
the talent for organization, lack of
consideration of cultural prestige, and

so on.
The fundamental weakness in uni
versity life he finds in the lack of
interest in scholarly activities, and

the relatively small amount of "learn
ing.'* He attributes this primarily to
the fact that students are the prod
uct of this national condition but
secondarily to the accumulativee ef
fect of the variety of extra-curricular
influences in the college organization.
Based on Observation

The. book is based on his observa
tions as an undergraduate, and as a
teacher. The statistical tables are un
obtrusively placed at the end of the
book, and on the whole, his treatment
of the subject is sympathetic and not
overly diadactic. His view is broad
and comprehensive. It is without
doubt one of the clearest and most
readable criticisms that has appeared
recently.

Yet from the point of view of the
undergraduate, we find certain funda
mental weaknesses in his treatment.
Professor Angell's book is an analy
sis, and a discussion —but is not con
structive criticism. And though his
observations of college life are perti
nent, his understanding of the under
graduate mind seems not only limited,
but a little prejudiced. Many of his
conclusions are drawn from rather
dangerously broad generalizations —
such as his opinion of the reason for
the popularity of dancing. "One of
the features of . . . dancing ... is
the slight degree of mingling among
the couples. Often a man and woman
spend practically the whole evening
together."

There are controversial conclusions
in the volume, but at any rate it is
decidedly significant. We recommend
it for your attention. Whether you
agree with Professor Angell or not,
"The Campus" undoubtedly is a book
that "every student should know."

"The Campus," by Robert Cooley
Angell. D. Appleton & Co.
"The Campus," a study of "contem
porary undergraduate life in the
American University," comes particu
larly to our attention —not only be
cause it bears Dr. Wilbur's recom
mendation upon the dust cover, but
because it is a keen and conscientious
analysis of our immediate environ
ment. The work is concerned primar
ily with the weaknesses in college
life today, a few of its virtues. The
problems of undergraduate life, such
as co-education, fraternities, sorori
ties, distractions of athletics, extra
curriculum activities, are discussed —
and criticized constructively.
Angell sees undergraduate life as a
"distinct and particular phase of the
general social process," and his analy
sis is based on the recognition of this
type of life as an organic whole. This
is a comprehensive view of college
life that is extraordinarily unique
when we consider the flood of litera
ture upon the problems of education —
a flood that is predominantly made up
of waves that lap obscure beaches,
rather than directed against the main
issue.

Students Have Three Wishes
He analyzes the average under
graduate's motives into three prime
desires: for individual prestige, for
present self-expression, and for suc
cess in later life. Their reactions to
university life are complicated by the
influences of certain national charac
teristics of Americans —externalism,
the talent for organization, lack of
consideration of cultural prestige, and

so on.
The fundamental weakness in uni
versity life he finds in the lack of
interest in scholarly activities, and

the relatively small amount of "learn
ing.'* He attributes this primarily to
the fact that students are the prod
uct of this national condition but
secondarily to the accumulativee ef
fect of the variety of extra-curricular
influences in the college organization.
Based on Observation

The. book is based on his observa
tions as an undergraduate, and as a
teacher. The statistical tables are un
obtrusively placed at the end of the
book, and on the whole, his treatment
of the subject is sympathetic and not
overly diadactic. His view is broad
and comprehensive. It is without
doubt one of the clearest and most
readable criticisms that has appeared
recently.

Yet from the point of view of the
undergraduate, we find certain funda
mental weaknesses in his treatment.
Professor Angell's book is an analy
sis, and a discussion —but is not con
structive criticism. And though his
observations of college life are perti
nent, his understanding of the under
graduate mind seems not only limited,
but a little prejudiced. Many of his
conclusions are drawn from rather
dangerously broad generalizations —
such as his opinion of the reason for
the popularity of dancing. "One of
the features of . . . dancing ... is
the slight degree of mingling among
the couples. Often a man and woman
spend practically the whole evening
together."

There are controversial conclusions
in the volume, but at any rate it is
decidedly significant. We recommend
it for your attention. Whether you
agree with Professor Angell or not,
"The Campus" undoubtedly is a book
that "every student should know."
