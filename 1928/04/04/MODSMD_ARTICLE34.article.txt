# AND Then Our Little SALLY
## 
### 
I think it was perfectly wonderful the
way every one came back to school. The
most expected things didn't happen at all,
except, of course, it did rain. But then, 1
rather like the weather when it is a little
damp. I mean it sort of keeps things
quieted down after the vacation.
And the holidays were almost like being
right here on the campus, there were so
many people around doing odd things that
were terribly interesting. I think that a
young girl really learns a lot just by go
ing to college and then getting all the

contrasts.
That is, every one seems quite different
at times and one realizes that one can't
find out everything no matter how hard
one tries, except by watching people in
action. And of course, the situation does
affect action. I mean, it changes one's
whole point of view.

But I really don't understand why every
one is so different on vacations. It seems
that people almost do things that well
I mean, everything the professors
tell us about laws and things was very
interesting. I guess college students are
so wise though that they don't believe all
that is told them.

What I mean to say is that I am really
glad to be back at school because things
are so nice and quiet and restful, and
holidays make such a pretty background
to work on for one can really use a lot of
one's old ideas to help out in stiff courses,
especially in spring quarter, because every
thing always helps a little to explain to
some people how much one appreciates
being here with the lake and the sunshine,
if it stops raining.
