### 
Nathan Van Patten, director of the
Stanford Library, and C. V. Park, as
sistant librarian, are attending the twenty
third annual meeting of the California
Library Association which is being held
April 3-5 at Riverside.

The Oberlin Women's Glee Club
gave a series of concerts, including a
radio performance, during the spring
vacation. They traveled some 900
miles through Michigan, Indiana, and
Illinois.

Plans have been completed for a
new library, costing $G25,000, at the
University of North Carolina.
