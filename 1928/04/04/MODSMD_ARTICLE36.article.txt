# DEATH BLOW TO CHICS IN OVERPOPULARITY OF SOME SPRING STYLES
## Ensemble of Printed Dress, Plain Coat Feature Present Style 
### Lady Vee 
Spring this year lias expressed her
self in a number of fashion modes
and details that are so charming that
they are already becoming too popu
lar to permit of much more popular
consumption. The too-popular thing is
the thing no longer chic.
There are several features this
sping that every woman will have an
impulse to put in her wardrobe â€”they
are already that widespread; and she
will be wise to see that they are par
ticularly suited to her needs and type
before she succumbs.

Ensemble Popular
For instance, the ensemble of
printed silk dress and plain coat is
going to be so ever-present that she
who does not own one w r ill be dis
tinctive. The coats promise to be

mostly beige, of one cast or another,
and the dresses threaten to bore us
to extinction with their jabots and
front pleats in the skirt.
Another costume that runs a chance

of being too popular for its own good
is the jersey blouse and printed silk
skirt and neckerchief. This is so ideal
for the college campus that the typi
cal 1928 college woman will probably

wear it through various and sundry
magazine illustrations of college life.
Will Wear Yellow
The yellow dye pots were used
overtime this season; and despite the
rumor that yellow is dreadfully un
popular with the masculine faction of

society, it has proceeded on its merry
way to feminine favor. The middling
type, however, the one who is neither
blonde nor brunette, and of unnotice
able coloring, will do well to use other
colors than yellow.

i Of all the popular fashion notes,
though, the one to be handled most
charily is the hat that goes up in a
point over one eye or in a peak in
the center. Like the roll brim in the
men's world, it was not made for the
person of tliickish neck and broad
face.
