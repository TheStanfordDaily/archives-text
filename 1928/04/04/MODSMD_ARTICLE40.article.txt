# HISTORY OF "MASQUE, ANTIQUE PAGEANTRY" TOLD CATHERINE DE MEDICI GIVES FIRST MASQUE BALL STANFORD NOT TO BE OUTDONE BY ANCIENTS
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
"Pomp and feast and revelry,
masques, and antique pageantry" have
characterized the lighter moments of
mankind since the earlier days of
Greek and Roman civilization. In view
of Stanford's coming Masque Ball
perhaps a history of such glorious af
fairs would not be inappropriate.
In ancient days the Greek and
Roman actors wore masks covering
the head as well as the face for mum
meries and pantomimes. In the Greek
drama masques are found which, to
gether with the Roman revels of the
Saturnalia, form the origin of the

modern masquerade.
The use of the dramatic mask was
evolved in the later theatre through
mimes and Italian popular comedy.
A "masque" was a specie of dramatic
entertainment in Europe in the six
teenth and seventeenth centuries. In
the period of James I in England the
masque reached its highest literary
form under Ben Jonson.

Druids in England used the mas
querade in proclaiming the New Year.
Held in Churches
Medieval masquerades were scenes
of great frivolity and extravagance.
They were held in the churches in

| spite of the efforts of many Popes to
1 control the Bacchanalian revelry. The
' magnificence and splendor of the car
i nivals of Lorenzo de Medici in golden
Italy are well known in history.
In 1858 Sixtus V tried to repress
the festival by setting up gibbets and
whipping posts. Sixtus also attempted
; to reform the evil custom of throw
; ing dirt and flour at the passengers
|of the carnival by permitting only
flowers and sweetmeats to be thrown.

Started in Italy
Catherine de Medici in France in
augurated the first Masque Ball in
the history of merriment, and surely
the civilized world owes her a debt
for this discovery that is far too often
unnoticed. It was an exclusive form
I of entertainment in which the carni
val element and the wearing of masks
j combined to make revelry more
! unique.

Paris is filled with merry laughter (
during the Mardi Gras which received
its name from the practice of parad
ing a fat ox (boeuf gran) during the 1
celebration of Shrove Tuesday. New
Orleans celebrates the Mardi Gras
with lungs, queens, and courtiers.
Stanford is not to be outdone by ,
history. A King and Queen will rule j
over a Masque Ball on Saturday which j

will combine in the modern youthful
enthusiasm of the twentieth century,
Roman revelry, Italian magnificence,
French gaiety, and Stanford ingenu
ity.
