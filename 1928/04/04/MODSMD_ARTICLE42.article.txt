# LOOSENED FRAMES OF CHAPEL WINDOWS ARE MADE FIRM BY STEEL
## 1906 Earthquake Weakened Iron Bars Supporting Stained Glass 
### 
Although their frames were loos
ened in the earthquake of 1906, the
stained glass windows of the Stan- J
lord Chapel have stood neglected and 1
weakened for twenty-two years, until
a few months ago when reenforcing

work was begun. The lower parts of
some of the windows began to sag in
ward as the horizontal iron bars
which were soldered onto the lead
work did not lend enough support.
They are now being replaced by per
pendicular electro-galvanized steel
bars, which are shorter and stronger
than the iron ones.

The workmen on the job, who are
from the Western Art Glass Studios
in San Francisco, explained the gen
eral types of stained glass windows.
Those in the Chapel are of the opale
scent type, being wrought on the
same principle as a regular mosaic.
Each color used is distinct within its
lead fret, and consequently many
separate pieces of glass are employed.
Iu the enamel type of window the
colored effects are obtained on white
sheets of glass precisely as they
would be on slabs of porcelain.
Full-Size Cartoon Made

From the artist's design a full-sized
cartoon is drawn with all the details,
and from this is made a tracing, show
ing the lead lines only. The colors de
sired are carefully marked and the
corresponding glass is selected.

Almost every section of the Chapel
windows, except where the effect is
merely decorative, is at least two
panes of glass in thickness, while in
some cases there may be as many
as five thicknesses, for depth as well
as color is striven for.

Mosaics Fastened by Wax
After the separate mosaics have
been cut out they are fastened to
gether by a wax preparation and the
whole is set on a glass easel against
the light. Then the worker tries the
effect of different colors behind the
panel forming the picture. Where no
back color is desired a clear glass is
thick and thin in spots, in order to
give the effect of folds of cloth. The
"ruby" glass, used to such an extent
in old-fashioned windows, is ineffec
tive when applied without discrimina
tion. Another glass, cooled in corru
gatod forms when made, gives the
effect of corduroy.
