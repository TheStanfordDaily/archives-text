# CARDINAL TRACKMEN ARE FAVORED TO WIN OVER OLYMPIC CLUB
## 
### 
Since Coach Dink Templeton's field
and track outfit has successfully
passed the most difficult hurdle on its
season's slate in U.S.C. there might
be reason for a period of coasting,
but from all indications Templeton
doesn't believe in rest.
At any rate the Cards haven't been
taking a vacation. The cross-country
jaunts and stilt' practice session they
have been indulging in don't look that
way.

With the Olympic Club meet only
a few days off the Stanford squad
looks good. The Cardinals justified
all expectations in the Trojan clash,
and should have no trouble in dis
posing of the Winged "O" men whose
slock dropped considerably last Sat
urday when they eked out a win by
only a narrow margin against the
Bears.

There are rumors, however, to the
effect that the Olympians didn't pre
sent their strongest front to the Cali
fornians, and that Saturday may be a
different story as far as their power
is concerned. It doesn't seem at all
likely, though, that they will serious
ly menace Templeton's charges, it
being rather a question of how many
points the Cards will win by than a
question of whether they will win.

That question is not one easily set
tled in view of the fact that the
strength of club teams is always a
doubtful quantity until the eve of the
meet, inasmuch as such organizations
have the habit of springing surprises
in the persons of new material.
