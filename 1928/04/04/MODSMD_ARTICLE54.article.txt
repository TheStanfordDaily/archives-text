# BABE TEAM RESUMES PRACTICE FOR ANNUAL U.C. FRESHMAN MEET
## 
### 
Despite a wet field the freshman track
and field team resumed practice yesterday
after the vacation layoff. Murray Draper,
track manager, announced last night that
the interclass relays, scheduled for Satur
day, were canceled because of the Olym
pic Club meet. He is making an attempt
to arrange a meet with the College of the
Pacific freshmen, but it is still tentative.

John Parker, star miler, who was out
of competition* last quarter because of
scholastic standing, will be back for the
California freshman meet on April 13.
Mossman, star Bear cub miler, who runs
the distance in about 4 minutes 30 sec
onds, will offer Dick Wright and Parker
stiff competition.
The California outfit will find strong
opposition in the sprints with Hec Dyer
and Allan McDermott both stepping the
century 10 flat and the 220 in 22 seconds.
Dyer will also run the low hurdles.

Bob Brown, who ran a fine second to
Hank Coe in the two-mile during the
interclass meet, will have a chance to run
his only two-mile race of the season.
Running the event in 10 minutes and pos
sibly less with good weather conditions,
he is conceded a sure first. He has been
entered in the mile in the previous meets.

His time of 50 4-5 seconds in the 440
will make Maynor Shove a sure winner
in that event. Shove has not been pressed
in any race this season and track officials
are wondering what he can do with real
competition.
