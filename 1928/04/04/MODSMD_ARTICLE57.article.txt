# THIRD BASE ON 1930 NINE IS LEFT VACANT BY INELIGIBLE PLAYER
## 
### 
With the first game of the fresh
man-Bear Cub series but three days
off, Coach Husky Hunt has an added
woe to accompany his present prob
lem of filling the vacancy at third
base on the babe nine that was
caused by the ineligibility of Norman
Hedge, regular third-sacker. Hunt's
latest worry is Jupiter Pluvius.

After a lay-off of several weeks'
duration, the Stanford men will need
at least three days of practice to
round into playing form. If rain con
tinues the Card yearlings will be un
able to enter the field on an even
basis with the California team which
had no finals or spring vacation to
interfere with its daily workouts.

The hope that Fred Goodell, who
covered third sack early in the sea
son, might take over Hedge's position
was given up when it was known
that Goodell will also be ineligible.
As there are no other likely candi
dates among the squad-members,
Hunt will probably shift Paul Magee
from his present position at second
base to the third counter. Jim Mears,
center on the championship babe bas
ketball squad, is likely to be the new
man in the infield. If Ward Loomis
does not pitch the opening game he
will very probably see service on
second base.

The first game of the three-game
yearling aeries will be played on the
varsity diamond Saturday morning.
