# ROYAL PARLIAMENT TO ASSURE SUCCESS OF MASQUE GAIETIES
## 
### 
"Everything is being done by my Royal
Parliament to assure the most brilliant
and successful of coronations," said King
David Adams of Stanford yesterday.
King David is now looking extremely
well after his rest in the low flat wheat
plains of Woodland, California, where he
spent his vacation preparing for the
kingly ordeal of his ascension to the
throne of the Masque Ball next Saturday
night.
"We want everyone to have a good
time," said His Majesty simply. "To this
end my Royal Parliament has been work
ing during vacation. The decorations, the
music, and the costumes will be all that
the Stanford court can hope for, and all
that remains to make a successful affair
is for my public to attend it 100 pbr cent
American, Turkish, Russian, or plain
Stanford rough."
Ted Krough, Imperial Custodian of the
Drapes and Palms, announces a carnival
motif for the decorations. The throne
will be placed at the east end of the
Pavilion where the King and his court
iers will hold sway with the Queen and

her charming followers. Black and gold
will predominate in color to make a
throne room worthy of a Cardinal King.
Twenty-five additional tickets will be
on sale today at the Old Union. The Ball
will start at 7:48 o'clock promptly. A
Mysterious Marvel will sound the trum
pet for the commencement of festivities.
In order to facilitate the rental of cos
tumes for the students a costume com
pany will be on the campus in the Pavil
ion this afternoon after 1:30 o'clock. The
company, Blake and Amber, is the largest
in San Francisco, and will be present on
the campus the rest of the week.
