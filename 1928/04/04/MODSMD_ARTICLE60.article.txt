# SPORTS OF 1928
## Act Two Begins 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
In another week now, the Walloping
Waners of Pittsburgh will begin the
second scene of their famous Brother
Act, which went over so big in 1927.
Paul, the elder, and a veteran now of
two full seasons with the Pirates,
i should "draw" better than ever, as he
has two new titles to his credit, i.e.,
| champion batsman of the National
League and also its most valuable
player. Lloyd, having played to capa
city houses for one season on the
i circuit, will certainly not be bothered
j with stage fright, to say the least,
and hopes to improve on his acting
| of last year. Pitchers of other Nation
al League clubs are unanimous in
saying that he is a bad actor.
"Wee Willie" Keeler holds the ma
! jor record for one-base hits with a
mark of 199, made in 1897. Yet little
Lloyd Waner, in his first year in the
| National League, knocked out 198

singles. The American League record
is 179.. No other player in the older
- circuit hit as many one-base wallops
as the younger Waner did in 1927.
Lloyd is the first player in the history
J of baseball to collect over 200 safe
hits in his first year in the majors,
; and Lloyd got 223!

The batting averages for 1927 show
that Paul Waner, in 155 games, scored
113 runs, made 237 hits, 40 doubles,
i 17 triples, 9 homers, 23 sacrifice hits,
I and stole 5 bases, and had a batting

average of .380; while Lloyd, in 150
games, scored 133 runs, made 223
hits, 17 doubles, G triples, 2 home
runs, 11 sacrifice hits, stole 14 bases,
and finished the season with a mark
of .354. Some family! Some act!
