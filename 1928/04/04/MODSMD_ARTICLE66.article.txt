# SHAW'S "CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA" IS STUDY IN CHARACTER, SATIRE
## 
### H. G 
George Bernard Shaw's "Caesar and
Cleopatra," which will be presented by
the English Club on April 13, is an inter
esting study of characters. Shaw admits
in the notes to the play that he has made
Caesar and Cleopatra a little different
from the generally accepted characters
associated with those names.

Caesar is a perfectly natural human
| and not the stern and hard character de
j picted in the histories. Cleopatra, Shaw
| has made a normal sixteen-year-old girl,
I physically matured but not mature in

experience and judgment.
The entire play is a satire on modern
society, and in it Shaw takes the oppor
tunity of rapping many institutions. Sig
nificant of the prominence of "Caesar and
Cleopatra" is the fact that the New York
Theatre Guild produced it two years ago
to dedicate its new building.

Shaw is perhaps the most outstanding
dramatist today and is always a huge box

office success. Shavian satire and humor
is especially appreciated by educated au
diences and for that reason his plays are
suitable for college production.

Miss Anna May Price, dramatic direct
or, has had experience with this play be
fore, and this will be valuable in staging
it here.
