# WATSON OPENS FIGHT IN SENATE FAVORING McNARY-HAUGEN BILL
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 3. —
(U.P.) —The fight to re-enact the Mc-
Nary-Haugen farm relief hill, which was
vetoed a year ago by President Coolidge,
was opened in the senate today by Sena
tor Watson of Indiana, a candidate for
the Republican presidential nomination.
Presidential aspects are involved be
cause Frank O. Lowden is for it and
Herbert Hoover is opposed.

The present bill, while retaining the
equalization fee which President Coolidge
denounced as unsound, makes a slight
concession in that it would make this
proposal a last resort measure instead of
a fundamental one as in the old bill. That
is, the bill provides that the proposed
federal farm board should first exhaust
the co-operative revolving fund provisions
backed by the administration, and if this
fails, resort to the equalization fee.

Some hope is expressed that this change
will cause the President to sign the bill
this time, since he would be empowered
to appoint the farm board subject only
to senate confirmation, and presumably
would have confidence in its desire to re
sort to the equalization fee only as a des
perate measure. On the other hand, he
has criticized this proposal so severely
that some doubt if he would sign his
name to it even as an alternative measure.
