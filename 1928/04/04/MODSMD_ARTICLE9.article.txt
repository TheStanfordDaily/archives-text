## Artist Explains Beauty of Indian Movement And Natural Grace 
### Virginia Voorheis 
Incense, semi-darkness, and slow
heating of an Indian drum were at
mospheric prologue to the Indian
dances presented last night in the
Assembly Hall by Grace Davis Bur
roughs. Before her performance, Mrs.
Burroughs, in draped Indian costume
of gold cloth from head to foot, with
passive, mask-like face accentuated
by huge, elaborate ear-rings, told the
audience the meaning of her Indian
dances.

Beauty of Movement
"Tlie people of India," she said,
"movjng about their daily tasks, have
retained a natural beauty of move
ment and rhythm that is akin to the
Greek symmetry of line, because the
movement is all directed from the
center of the body. In all their diffi
cult footwork in their dances, where
the ankle hells are made to keep in
tricate rhythms and express differing
moods, the movement is all begun
from the center of the body, from the
solar plexus, not from the foot or the
knee.

"From the habit of carrying every-!
thing on their heads, the women of
India develop a superb carriage and \
posture, with head high, chest out,
and arms free. In all their labor their
movements are beautiful —again be- \
cause it is all directed from the cen- j
ter of the body and gives the whole
a symmetry and rhythm of line that
is unknown to the Western world."

Interperts Ancient Dances
Mrs. Burroughs' first two dances
were done to both flute and drum, one
the well-known "Song of India'' and
the second to the familiar "Temple
Bells" from the Indian Love Lyrics,
to which she did The Coquette. The
Punjabi Lament was done to drum
and her own voice alone, singing the
old Indian love lament, done simply
and unpretentiously with sweet un
operatic voice. In The Water Carrier
Mrs. Burroughs demonstrated her
mastery of the Indian footwork in dif
ficult and complicated rhythms.
Throughout, her feet were the center
of interest, demonstrating as they did
her understanding of the principle of
the movement all starting from the
center of the body.

cult footwork in their dances, where
the ankle hells are made to keep in
tricate rhythms and express differing
moods, the movement is all begun
from the center of the body, from the
solar plexus, not from the foot or the
knee.

"From the habit of carrying every-!
thing on their heads, the women of
India develop a superb carriage and \
posture, with head high, chest out,
and arms free. In all their labor their
movements are beautiful —again be- \
cause it is all directed from the cen- j
ter of the body and gives the whole
a symmetry and rhythm of line that
is unknown to the Western world."

Interperts Ancient Dances
Mrs. Burroughs' first two dances
were done to both flute and drum, one
the well-known "Song of India'' and
the second to the familiar "Temple
Bells" from the Indian Love Lyrics,
to which she did The Coquette. The
Punjabi Lament was done to drum
and her own voice alone, singing the
old Indian love lament, done simply
and unpretentiously with sweet un
operatic voice. In The Water Carrier
Mrs. Burroughs demonstrated her
mastery of the Indian footwork in dif
ficult and complicated rhythms.
Throughout, her feet were the center
of interest, demonstrating as they did
her understanding of the principle of
the movement all starting from the
center of the body.
