Sailing "Tourist Third" is
adventure that begins when
you go up the gangplank.
You will dance on moonlit
decks to the rhythm of a col
lege orchestra no feet have
yet resisted. You will swim
in salt water in an impro
vised deck tank. You'll play
the delightful deck games
thatyouth-on-a-lark devises.
And there'll be bridge,—
and conversation; — and
sometimes lost sleep! But
of course you have your
choice between missing
sleep and fun.
Do you realize how very
inexpensively this can be
done on big Cunard ships
such as the CARONIA, CAR
MANIA, SCYTIIIA, LACONIA,
LANCASTRIA and TUSCANI A?
You are berthed in a com
fortable, clean cabin, you
have good food, njrely
served, with ample dek
space and you enjoy the
company of your own
kind of people . . . because
they are others like you
who feel the adventurous
call of traveling Tourist
Third Cabin.
