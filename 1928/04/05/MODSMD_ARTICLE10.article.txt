# LITTLER ASKS STUDENTS TO BACK HOOVER
## Cutler Organizes Alumni to Support Candidacy of Former Student 
### 
"If anyone ought to be behind
Hoover it's his own alma mater. We
want to make it known that Stanford
students ARE behind him and to en
list the students of other universities
in his support.'' This is the way
Robert Littler, chairman of the Stan
ford Hoover Club, sums up the pur
poses of the organization which is
now engaged in a campaign to gather
i student supporters of Stanford's dis
tinguished alumnus into its ranks.
"Signing the enrollment blank pub
lished in this issue does not involve
any financial obligation nor does it

i bind a person in any way. It merely
| signifies one's approval of Hoover's
! candidacy and policies," Littler ex
plained.
Stanford alumni, organized under
I the leaders of Leland W. Cuttler,
are already doing active work for
; Hoover. "Their response is unani
mous," Cuttler reports.
"We want this same spirit among
the undergraduates," said Littler. "A
showing of Hoover's strength on the
| campus is going to be a big talking
; point in the national campaign, and
i we urge all students who are back of
1 him to sign the enrollment coupon,
| to clip it, and to mail it to Box 1243
i or to place it in a box provided for
that purpose at the Engineering cor
ner."
