# Ticket Sale For Shavian Comedy Will Open Today
## 
### 
Seat sale for Shaw's "Caesar and Cleo
patra," which will be presented by the
English Club a week from tomorrow,
will begin at one o'clock today, announces
Norman Larsen, dramatic manager. Be
cause of the expensive settings and cos
tumes necessary for the production, there
will be a slight increase in the customary
admission charge. Tickets will be on
sale for $1 to $1.50.
An unusually large number of mail
order ticket applications were reported by
the Dramatic Council offices yesterday.
Popularity of Shaw as a playwright and
the pretentiousness of the production are
believed to be responsible for the in
creased seat demand.
More than fifty persons will appear in
"Caesar and Cleopatra," and several
names familiar to campus play patrons
arc included in the cast.
Both Roman and Egyptian costumes
will be seen on the stage, which make
the show as much of a pageant as a
comedy. Although the play is done in
costume, the lines are decidedly modern
in the typical Shavian style of satire.
