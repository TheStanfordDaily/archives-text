# BURNABY IS ELECTED CAPTAIN OF CARDINAL FIRST-YEAR GOLF MEN
## 
### 
Homer Burnaby was elected to cap
tain the Stanford freshman golf squad
through the present season at a meet
ing of the Cardinal golfers yesterday
noon. Burnaby, registered from Los
Angeles, has been near the top of the
yearling ladder this season, and
promises to develop considerably be
fore the end of his college career.
Both the varsity and the freshman
squads left for Berkeley yesterday to
take on the Bear mashie-wielders to
day.
A successful campaign into south
ern California during spring vacation
indicates that Stanford's chances
against California are promisnig, but
golf, the most erratic of sports, can
not be doped with a great deal of ac
curacy.
