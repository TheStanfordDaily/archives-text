# CARDS, TROJANS IN DECIDING CONTEST OF SERIES TODAY
## S.C. Athletes Out to Avenge Defeat of Trackmen in Saturday's Meet 
### 
For the first time in several weeks
Stanford baseball fans will see the Car
dinal varsity nine in action today when I
the Cards meet the Southern California
Trojans on the home diamond at 3:15
I o'clock in the third and deciding game of
the series. Each team has won a game.
Coach Harry Wolter put his squad |
through a light batting and fielding work- J
out yesterday to wind up their practice ;
for today's encounter with U.S.C. The i
Trojans played St. Mary's at Oakland
yesterday.
Every time the Southern Calilo.nia
athletes have invaded the Stanford cam
pus in recent months, it has been with the
idea of avenging some previous defeat.
With the memory of the decisive victory
of the Cardinal track and field men last
Saturday still fresh in their minds, the
sons of Troy will be out for blood, and j
not perhaps, in this afternoon's diamond
contest. However, the Cards will be in
no mood for throwing the game away. 1
A victory will add materially to Stan
j ford's already excellent chances for a
|conference championship.
Wolter has not selected the hurler who
will start today's game. With four first
| class pitchers to choose from, the coach's
task should not be a difficult one. So
| bieski, Philippi, Kern, and Lewis are all,
i capable of defeating the visitors. Sahl-j
i berg, who acquitted himself creditably
iagainst Stanford in the first game of the
| series last week, may do the mound work
{ for the Trojans.
The Card line-up will probably be the
| same as in the last few games. This I
means Sypher, catcher; McGuire, first
base; Garibaldi, second base; Laird, third
base; Busch, short stop; Levin, left field;
| Wilton, center field ; and Sims, right field. ,
j Wolter said yesterday that their regular
| batting order may be changed.
