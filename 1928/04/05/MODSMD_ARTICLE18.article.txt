# PHILIPPINE DEBATERS GIVEN OVERWHELMING DECISION BY AUDIENCE
## 
### 
Expressing their belief that the
Philippines should be granted imme
diate and absolute independence, de
baters from the University of the
Philippines won an audience decision
by a vote of 178 to 52 in a meet with
the Stanford varsity last night.
More than one-half of the audience
consisted of Filipinos. Teodoro T.
Evangelista, the first speaker for the
affirmative, opened his speech with
a courteous expression of the purpose
of the present debate tour. "We are
not politicians, or envoys, merely
representatives of a university who
wish to present a dispassionate expo
sition of the Philippine cause."
The many arguments advanced by
the affirmative were that since the
Philippines were socially, economi
cally, and politically capable of self
government and should therefore be
granted independence. Each of the
three speakers proved one phase of
the argument, and Evangelista, in a
rebuttal speech stated the completed
case in syllogistic form.
The Stanford team pointed out
some probable results if independence
were granted. The negative acknowl
edged their sympathy with the Philip
pine cause, but pointed out that only
by waiting until the Philippines were
a little more advanced would their
independence endure.
Virgil Whitaker, Gordon Schallen
berger, and Fred Combellack spoke
for Stanford in the order mentioned.
Professor William Hawley Davis pre
sided.
