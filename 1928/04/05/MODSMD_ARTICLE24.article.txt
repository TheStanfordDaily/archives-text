						Captain Now

### 
Is the baseball team going to elect a captain now or wait until the
season is over, when the position will be merely one of honor? A pretty
empty glory that. Any baseball squad needs a leader who, when any dis
putes arise, or when someone on the field is needed to take charge of some
difficulty, can step in with authority and represent his team.
Time was when the captain was also the coach in college nines, but
that is not the case now. However, while the coach can handle the team to
a certain extent from the bench, and before or after the games, there
should be someone actually in the game to handle matters occurring dur
ing any particular game.
The problem seems to be two-fold on the baseball squad: In the first
place, Coach Harry Wolter evidently does not want a captain. Why?
Well, for one thing it is rumored that he isn't in favor of the men who
seem to be most popular for the place. This attitude hardly needs com
ment. The second difficulty seems to be political. After the day's practice
in which one of the men has done exceptionally fine work, his backers
want to have an election, hoping he will be a cinch to take it. But perhaps
another man being touted for the position hasn't been quite up to snuff for
that day, so his cohorts don't want an election. And so goes it.
However, when spoken to individually, the players want a captain.
They don't like the uncertainty caused by not having one. The real diffi
culty must lie in the coach. Now a coach is on the job to get the best
work out of the men, to teach them the intricacies of the game, and to
make a winning team. But he is not supposed to win games "at any cost."
And one of the effects of not allowing a captain to be chosen is that the
men, after long uncertainty and foreboding, commence to dislike those
they suspect of not being "for" them, or their man. This is an unhealthy
condition, and bad for any kind of a team. This was proved quite con
clusively in both basketball and football. And the coaches, themselves,
recognized it to be so, else why would they have had elections for next year
immediately at the conclusion of their respective seasons?
Coach Wolter must realize that college sports are not exactly like
professional ones, and that spirit has a great deal to do with a winning
team. After all, the players are not getting paid, and they, as well as the
members of the student body, have some voice in the running of the team.
Both of these groups want captains.
