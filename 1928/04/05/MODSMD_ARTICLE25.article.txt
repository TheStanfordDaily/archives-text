September 15 next, Stanford will have Ernie Nevers and Ed Walker
added to the coaching staff of the University. This is a splendid step.
Both of these men were stellar performers at Stanford during their
undergraduate days, and should furnish inspiration as well as actual in

remembered particularly for his football career, but Nevers, who has
recently been pitching for the St. Louis Browns, was also a basketball and
baseball player to be envied.
