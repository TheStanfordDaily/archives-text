Just a VERY few of the last-minute nubilous nuances of politics in
the big town of Chicago:
Senator Deneen charged Mayor Thompson is attempting to cloud law
less conditions by injecting World Court issue in primary and criticizing
Deneen for voting for it.
Governor Small called Louis L. Emmerson, his opponent in gubernatorial
race, "Chicago Tribune Candidate," and accused newspapers of misquoting
him.
Former Attorney General Brundage accused Democrats of planning to
throw strength to Governor Small in primary to elect Justice Floyd Thomp
son Governor at election.
Leo Konetzka, Democratic election worker, was shot through arm in
political row.
Won't Congress please call on Nicaragua to send back some of the
Marines to take care of Mayor Thompson's babe?
