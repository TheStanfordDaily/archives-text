California Pastime
By practice slaughtering beauty has
almost reached the level of a high art in
California. Commercialism has come to
such a sorry pass that now no scene how
ever beautiful is complete without a bill
board. While oil wells march down the
beach and hide the sea, the mountains
yield up age-old redwoods to make more
signs.
Back in the days of the real estate
booms California sold her heritage of
beauty to a Middle-Western farmer and
got a hot dog stand and a handful of
bills in return. Today there are signs of
an awakening concern for beauty, but
nature, which is .credited with curing all
scars if given time, and those aestheti
cally inclined can't work fast enough to
keep up with the inartistic efforts of our
host of real estate men, cheap contractors,
and sign painters.
Shortening Names
Passing over the jumble of subdivi
sions, billboards, "good eats" shacks, way
side fruit stands, and the ugly or bizarre
houses which everywhere greet one, we
will consider the degeneration of Cali
fornia names, also a very prevalent pas
time. The classic example, perhaps, is

San Francisco, which seems to contain
too many syllables for most of the popu
lation. Hence the lowbrow "Frisco."
Anybody pronouncing the name of Los
Angeles correctly is looked upon as some
thing of a freak. Business men, lords of
speed and efficiency, have been heard to
use "Monte" for El Monte. Likewise the
beautiful name San Juan Capistrano is
similarly conspired against by the Bab
bitts.
The three peaks in the San Bernardino
Mountains, named by the early Spaniards
San Antonio, San Gorgonio, and San
Jacinto, have become Old Baldy, Gray
back, and San Jack respectively. That the
minds of the populace may not be unduly
strained, San Bernardino is telescoped
into "San Berdoo."
Just Commonplace
While this, like many other things in
life, is sad but true, it is nevertheless
sheer mental slovenliness, which, in this
particular case, ruins and makes common
place something which might be very
beautiful and colorful.
And the only reason for writing this is
to protest against commonplaceness and
commonplace minds, both of which are
very dull and uninteresting.
