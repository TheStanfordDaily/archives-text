"Etched in Moonlight,?' by James [
Stephens. Macmillan Co., New
York.
This collection of short stories by
the author of "The Crock of Gold,"
"Deidre," and numerous other beauti
ful books, is evidently a synthesis
from his earlier —and palmier —days. j
In the seven sketches or stories pre- 1
sented, we can find traces of every
mood and style he has ever used.
Two of the set are very fine indeed
—"Etched in Moonlight," a dream
story, and "The Wolf," more or less
of a silhouette characterization. The
first of these is written in the ex
quisite manner of "Deidre," with all
the beauty and lyrical qualities he is
capable of—and with some of his in
credible horror. The atmosphere of
the dream impregnates it throughout,
even to infecting the reader with the
weird apprehension peculiar to
dreams.
The rest of the stories are lament
able, we think. Schnitzler can be for
given and even commended for per

fuming his books with the odors of a
clinic, but for James Stephens to de
scend to the neurasthenic ward! Two
of the stories, "Hunger," and "School
fellows," nauseated us exactly as
ether does. Not the choice of subject
matter —anything in that line can be
forgiven if the treatment is artistic
and fine enough, for the style of the
artist is a mysterious alchemy capa
ble of performing miracles. But the
mystic pseudo-symbolic pathos that
he employs in these two tales is a
shame to his former work.
A man who has the delicious and
subtle humor of the philosophers and
their wives in "The Crock of Gold, v
who has the power of making the epi
grams in "The Demi-Gods," who has
the talent for endowing the gods and
goddesses of Irish legends with the
flesh and blood of humans, to come
forth with this! A more mediocre
author could be easily forgiven, but
in view of his past work, "Etched in
Moonlight," in spite of the one or
two fine stories, is an insult to his
j own intelligence.—Hallie Keating.

In the seven sketches or stories pre- 1
sented, we can find traces of every
mood and style he has ever used.
Two of the set are very fine indeed
—"Etched in Moonlight," a dream
story, and "The Wolf," more or less
of a silhouette characterization. The
first of these is written in the ex
quisite manner of "Deidre," with all
the beauty and lyrical qualities he is
capable of—and with some of his in
credible horror. The atmosphere of
the dream impregnates it throughout,
even to infecting the reader with the
weird apprehension peculiar to
dreams.
The rest of the stories are lament
able, we think. Schnitzler can be for
given and even commended for per

fuming his books with the odors of a
clinic, but for James Stephens to de
scend to the neurasthenic ward! Two
of the stories, "Hunger," and "School
fellows," nauseated us exactly as
ether does. Not the choice of subject
matter —anything in that line can be
forgiven if the treatment is artistic
and fine enough, for the style of the
artist is a mysterious alchemy capa
ble of performing miracles. But the
mystic pseudo-symbolic pathos that
he employs in these two tales is a
shame to his former work.
A man who has the delicious and
subtle humor of the philosophers and
their wives in "The Crock of Gold, v
who has the power of making the epi
grams in "The Demi-Gods," who has
the talent for endowing the gods and
goddesses of Irish legends with the
flesh and blood of humans, to come
forth with this! A more mediocre
author could be easily forgiven, but
in view of his past work, "Etched in
Moonlight," in spite of the one or
two fine stories, is an insult to his
j own intelligence.—Hallie Keating.
