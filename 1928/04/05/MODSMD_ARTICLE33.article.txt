# 'SO HE WENT TO HELL' HEADS NEXT ISSUE OF 'LIT,' READY MONDAY
## 
### 
Variety and lightness of tone charac- '
terize the contents of the April number
of the Literary Magazine which is to
be mailed to subscribers Saturday and
will be sold on Quad Monday.
"And So He Went to Hell," a short !
play by Laird Doyle in the vein of
"Heavenly Discourse," is one of the most;
entertaining features of the issue. Such j
public figures as Satan, George Jean;
Nathan, and Theodore Dreiser figure
prominently in the work.
Herbert Reynolds, Marshall Somer-'
[ ville, and Betty Ford have also contrib
uted to the April number.
Casting aside its usual red cover, the j
magazine will appear this month in a |
striking black and white jacket. An
etching by Morgan Stedman of one of j
the Quad towers will form the frontis- j
piece.
