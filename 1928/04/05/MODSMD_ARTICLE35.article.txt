# SPORTS OF 1928
## Detroit's Hopes 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Second from the top of the Tigers'
player roster for 1928 is the name Car
roll, Owen T. Third from the bottom of
the list is the name Whitchill, Earl O.
These two men are as far apart in man
ner of delivery as they are on the roster,
for Whitchill is a left-hander, while Car
roll throws in the orthodox manner. But
they are alike in two things: one, that
on them will rest about half the burden
of pitching for Detroit during the coming
season, and, two, because they are both
terrible batters. With Sam Gibson and
Ken Holloway, they will carry the hopes
of Flivver City fans in the 1928 pennant
race, and there are certain good reasons
why Manager Moriarty can look with
optimism on the clays between April 11
and September 30.
Owen Carroll, of Newark, N.J., who

[ weighs 165 and bats .174, is well remem
bered for his sensational work with Holy
Cross, where he won 48 games out of 50.
He joined Detroit in the summer of 1925
but got off to a disastrous start, and was
| sent to Toronto, where he pitched fine
ball in 1926. His 1927 record of 10 wins
and 6 defeats gives hope for an even
better season this year.
Earl Whitehill, of Cedar Rapids, la.,
who weighs 165 and bats .205, became a
regular with Detroit in 1924 and won
17 games while losing 9. The next year
he made it "11â€”11"; in 1926, won 16 and
| lost 13; and last season recorded 16 vic
j tories and 14 defeats. He has, you see,
yet to go below the .500 mark, and, as he
j is only 28 years old, there is no reason
j why he should not have many more win
ning seasons ahead of him.
