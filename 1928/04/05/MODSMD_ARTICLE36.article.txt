# STANFORD MEN PLAN TO STUDY CONDITIONS OF FISHING STREAMS
## 
### 
A six-mile laboratory, established
by Dean Theodore Hoover on his
holdings in Santa Cruz county, will
be used to make a study of trout
stream conditions on the Coast, it was
announced recently. Part of Waddell
Creek and a building for a labora
tory have been placed in the hands
of the Department of Zoology operat
ing through Dr. John O. Snyder, an
agent of the Fish and Game Commis
sion, for the undertaking of a study
of the Steelhead-Rainbow trout of the
Coast streams, who will use the prop
erty as a laboratory.
Letters were sent to three hundred
persons holding tickets of admission

to the Rancho del Oso, notifying them
that fishing and unauthorized trespass
ing on the stream will be discon
tinued. Commenting on this step,
Hoover said:
"It is self-evident already that our
present system of propagation and
conservation is inadequate to the
sporting needs of California and
doomed to failure within a few years,
because we are definitely burning the
candle at both ends by taking spawn
ing fish and taking thousands of
fingerlings before they have a chance
to mature."
