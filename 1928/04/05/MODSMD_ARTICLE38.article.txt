Saturday night's gala Masque Ball will |
be the fourth University masquerade that
has been given on the Stanford campus.
Owing to the difficulty of. staging the
usual two-day spring carnival the Execu
tive Committee set aside May 4 in 1923
for a Masque Ball.
"Abandon dignity all ye who enter
here" was the succinct warning over the
flower-decked entrance of the Pavilion on I
the fourth of May, 1923. A grand march
"for to see and be seen" opened the high
jinks, and the jollities of the evening
were under the official irresponsibility of
a Mephistophelian master of ceremonies |
and his cohorts.
The identity of the carnival masque
j rulers was kept secret until the coronation i
at 10:30 o'clock. Dr. Wilbur crowned,
j the Lord and Lady of Misrule, Sam Men
i denhall and Peggy Richardson.
In 1924 the campus names of sover-1
eigns were veiled in secrecy until the {
night of April 25 when the A.S.S.U.;
Masque Ball was held. After a hotly con-'
tested election Dana Fuller and Muriel
Saxon forsook their roles of Stanford
students and were crowned Monarchs of
j Merriment in an elaborate pantomime \
| ceremony.
The 1925 Masque Ball was different
from any other ball given on the campus. â– 
There were the usual costumes and the j
same carnival spirit and monarchical rule, !
j but all suspicion of formality vanished in !
the setting of a children's playground
which was the idea carried out in the
decorations.
The 1925 Ball was given by the Rally
Committee. The King was elected by the
! Stanford populace and the lady of his
choice was the Queen. J. H. Sickler and
Rowena Mason ruled over their "toy"
kingdom of swings, see-saws, slides, and
games of catch and leap-frog.
The Masque Ball of 1928 promises to

be the most glorious of these royal Stan
ford coronations. Entertainment, a mys- j
terious masked and marvelous orchestra,
a King and Queen to rule the revelers,
and a setting in which one cannot help
but spend a happy evening are the fea
tures of Stanford's 1928 carnival of mer
riment.
Only twenty-four students at the Uni
versity of Oregon "flunked out" last se
mester, as contrasted with thirty-seven of i
the semester before.
