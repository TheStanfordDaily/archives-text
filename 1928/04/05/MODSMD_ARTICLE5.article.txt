MADISON, Wis., April 4.—(U.P.)—
Progressive Republicans pledged to sup
port Senator George W. Norris of Ne
braska for the presidency were successful
in winning three out of four candidates
for delegates at large, returns tabulated
in the Wisconsin primary late today indi
cated.
Senator Robert M. LaFollette, progres
sive, led the field of candidates by a com
fortable margin. As late returns showed,
the tide of sentiment was turning toward
the Norris ranks.
In the Democratic balloting the so
called Callahan candidates, pledged to
support Governor A1 Smith of New
York, had won by a large majority.
On the basis of 1600 precincts out of
a total Of 2746 in the state early tonight,
LaFollette had 95,137 votes. Senator John
J. Blaine, his running mate in Congress
and also a progressive, had 85,430.
The race tightened in selection of two
other delegates-at-large, but the progres
sive leaders pointed out that the rural
precincts undoubtedly would throw vic
tory to them at least to the extent of get
ting three out of four to be selected.
