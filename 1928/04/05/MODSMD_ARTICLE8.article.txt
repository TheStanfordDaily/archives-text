# SMITH, HOOVER LEAD RACE FOR NOMINATION IN PARTY COMPETITION
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 4.—(U.P.)—
Early primaries have thrown Gover
nor Allrod E. Smith and Secretary
Herbert Hoover into the lead in their
respective party contests for the
presidential nominations.
Smith Gains in Four States
Smith has picked up large blocs of
delegates this week in New York,
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Maine.
Hoover received the preference in
Michigan.
Delegates thus far instructed or
pledged in primaries and state con
ventions are as follows:
Republican—Hoover, 1 IS; Lowden, 86;
Curtis, 23. Necessary to nominate, 545.
Democratic —Smith, 244; Reed, 36;
George, 28. Necessary to nominate,
734.
Dope Sheets Unchanged
Thus no candidate, in actual dele
gates, has begun to cover the distance
to the nomination. Partisans of each
candidate naturally try to make these
victories seem highly significant. But
the fact is that none of the primaries
has changed the line-up on the dope
sheets of the politicians. They have
turned out as expected, there have
been practically no real contests,
each primary thus far has recorded
the wishes of the state leaders and
has not been the result of a furious
struggle between candidates.
