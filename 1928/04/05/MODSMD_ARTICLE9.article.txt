Four members of the S.C. varsity
tennis squad will arrive this morning
on the campus to meet the Stanford
team this afternoon at 1:30 on the
varsity courts. There will be four
singles matches played during the
afternoon and two doubles.
Although Bob Gates, No. 1 man on
the S.C. team, is considered a very
good player, it seems to be the con
census of opinion that A1 Herrington
will take his match against him as
will the other members of the varsity
In their respective matches.
Stanford Easy Winner
This will be the fifth meet of the
varsity team this season, all of which
have been easily annexed. The Occi
dental squad headed by Ben Gorcha
koff was nearly annihilated, and the
varsity took every match in the meet
with U.C.L.A. Last week, in Los An
geles, Stanford took the honors in the
four-way meet with California, S.C.,
and U.C.L.A., so altogether the out
look is bright for today.
Trojans Lose Early
In the same four-way meet last
week, the S.C. team was either un
successful or just plain unlucky, for
only one man went past the first
round and he was put out in the
second round. In the doubles matches,
Bob Gates and Bob Bagley, of S.C..
went to semi-finals where they wero
i put out by Hoogs and Ilager of Cali
fornia.
