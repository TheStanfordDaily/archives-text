IF you choose rightly now, you will be doing work
that interests you, that pays you well and that offers
steady opportunity for progress. If vou choosc without
thoroughgoing analysis of yourself and your job, you may
be starting all over, or else discontented and underpaid in
work for which you are not fitted.
The bond business is one field which you may care to
consider. There are no ruts in it for men who are adapted
to it. It calls for a broad familiarity with business in this
country and abroad. It requires close observance of politi

Possibly such a business may appeal to you. If so, in

Men," will give you a better understanding of the bond
business, and help you to decide upon the advisability of
choosing it for a career.
