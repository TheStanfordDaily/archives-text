# CARD MITTMEN TAKE TOURNEY FROM U.C., 4-3
## Maloney's Boxers Redeem Recent Defeat Before 3,000 Spectators Marcus, Berkeley Grid Star, Defeated; Dillon Wins Thrilling Match 
### Carroll O'Meara 
The Cardinal lcatherpushers redeemed
their recent defeat at the hands of the
Bears when they met and defeated Stan
ley Jones' team here in the Pavilion last
night before more than three thousand
eager fans. Stanford took four out of
the seven regular bouts from the Cali
fornians.
The feature of the evening was the
light-heavyweight bout between "Brick"
Marcus, California grid star, and Harold
Crumley of Stanford. In this, his ring
debut, Marcus took a severe beating
through three rounds of exciting boxing, i
Marcus New at Game
Marcus demonstrated his unfamiliarity
with the ring game in the first round
which he lost to a less stocky opponent.
The blows that Crumley delivered in the
second period would have finished a less j
sturdy man. The Berkeley football player
stuck through the entire bout in spite of I
his dizziness in the last round, lie was a
bloody spectacle, and slill groggy when he
left the ringâ€”his career as a pugilist
probably at an end.
Another thrilling match took place in
the heavyweight class, which was fought
between Ed Dillon of Stanford and
"Red" Barclay of the Bears. Both men 1
are rather tall for heavyweights, and box
unusually fast for this division.
The first round of this affair was even.
In the second and third rounds Dillon.
proved his superiority as a boxer, landing
blows with ease on his opponent's head
and body. Both of these periods were j
decidedly in favor of the Stanford boxer,
whose consistent left jabs told 011 his op
ponent. Dillon won by a judges' deci
sion. Excitement was keen among the
spectators during the entire eight minutes
of this bout which decided the victor of
the tourney.
Jake Fetzer of Stanford and Linwood
Spier of California fought on a par for
the start of their middleweight match,
but the tide turned in favor of the Cali
fornia man after a few seconds when he
dropped Fetzer a short count. From then
on the match was Spier's. He won a
technical knockout in the second through
the aid of his smashing rights.
Kearney Beats Levitt
John Sano (S), and N. Koboyashi (C),
both Japanese bantams, started the seven
regular bouts. Sano won from his oppon
ent after a fast extra round. In the feath
erweight class, Francis Kearney (C), was
given a technical knockout over Bill Lev
itt (S), after a few seconds of boxing.
Stanford took the lightweight bout,
with John Hromadka (S) and Wilbur j
Kendig (C) in the ring. Kendig, a ;
crouching slugger, was outboxed by the !
Card leathcrpusher for the entire route.
Danny Frost lost to George Sherwood j
by a technical knockout in the second in 1
the welterweight.
All the exhibition matches went three
rounds except the middleweight bout, in
which Milton Cohen defeated George
Julian, California, by a technical K.O. in
the second.
