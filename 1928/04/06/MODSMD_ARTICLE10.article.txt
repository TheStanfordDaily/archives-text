# OREGON DEBATERS GRANTED DECISION IN FORENSIC CLASH
## Visitors Adequately Defend Present Intervention Policy of U.S. 
### 
Declaring that the negative met tin
j arguments of the affirmative side squarelj
! and adequately, Professor Anthony F
Blanks adjudged the Oregon debate tearr
winner over the Stanford varsity in the
intercollegiate meet last night.
In discussing the subject, "Resolved
That American investors and their invest
ments should be protected only by the
government of the nation in which the
investment is made," the Stanford team
based their arguments only on the par
ticular phase of military intervention in
the Central and South American coun
tries.
The Stanford team advanced the points
that military intervention is economically
unsound and could not be differentiated
from imperialism. The second speaker
declared that armed intervention was fun
damentally unjust and that it was con
trary to the present tendencies in inter
national law. Both Ronald Anderson
and Robert Sharp, the Stanford speakers,
said that the United States had gained
the moral condemnation of the world for
activities in the Southern Hemisphere.
It was because the limited viewpoint
taken by the affirmative that the decision
was awarded to the opposition.
Joseph McKeown and Joseph Durgan,
the Oregon speakers, based their points
011 the assertion that every case of armed
intervention by the United States was
for the protection of lives of citizens.
Therefore, to protect lives, strategic in
terests, and to enforce the Monroe Doc
trine, intervention was necessary.
