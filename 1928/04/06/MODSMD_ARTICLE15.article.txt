### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 5. —
(U.P.) —Governor Alfred E. Smith of
New York, a Democratic presidential
candidate, was defended by a rival candi
date in the Senate today when Senator
Walsh of Montana replied to a recent
attack in connection with the oil scan
dals by Senator Robinson, Indiana Re
publican.
He said Robinson's insinuations against
Smith were "mere piffle," adding that no
one has ever dared to assert that the gov
ernor is not an honest man.
Walsh said the "heinous crime" charged
against Smith by Robinson was that he
appointed Harry F. Sinclair as a New
York racing commission member. Walsh
added that Robinson was the sole author
ity for another charge that Smith received
a campaign contribution from Sinclair in
1920.
"I presume 110 one could find any par
ticular culpability if the campaign man
agers of Governor Smith did take a con
tribution from Sinclair," Walsh said.
"The whole thing seems to me to be
what might be termed, in street language,
mere piffle.
"But the attack of the senator from In
diana is particularly directed against me."
