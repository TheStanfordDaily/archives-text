## 
### 
Pledged subscribers who have not
yet paid for their subscriptions to
the Literary Magazine will be offi
cially lit on by the "Lit" if they
liave not done so by 5 o'clock today.
And furthermore, tbe beautiful
pun mentioned above is only a sam
ple of what the tardy ones will miss

copy of tbe magazine containing the
innermost thought of a prominent
campus figure on the subject of pun
ning. No, he doesn't approve, but he
begins his masterpiece with ''Once
upun a time," and goes from bad to
worse.
Then, too, those whose payments
are delinquent will be denied the
valuable suggestions contained in
"And So He Went to Hell" to say
nothing of the subtle humor in Mar
shall Somerville's story, "Jim En
counters the Dragon."
