# STRONG CARDINAL TRACK TEAM MEETS OLYMPIANS TOMORROW
## Stanford's Strength Is Seen In Field Events With Krenz, King, West Edmonds Promises Strong Competition for Carr In Pole Vaulting 
### Bob Speers 
It will be a dangerously strong
Cardinal (rack team that takes the
field at 2:30 o'clock tomorrow after
noon in the Stanford stadium to meet
the Winged "O" squad from San Fran
cisco.
And if the team as a whole is
strong the field division can take the
credit for a big portion of it. Temple
ton's weight men and jumpers are
probably the best seen on the Pacific
Coast, or anywhere else, in a long
time.
Krenz Sure in Weights
Eric Krenz, husky sophomore shot
putter and discus-thrower, looks capa
ble of copping a couple of firsts in any
meet he enters. And should Krenz for
some reason fail to do his stuff, three
or four of his brawny mates will be
ready to step into the breach.
Then Stanford's broadjumpers aren't
to be equalled on the coast, if in the
entire country, and with Edmonds
looking promising as a probable con
queror of Sabin Carr in the pole vault
this year, Stanford shouldn't have
much difficulty in that event against
the Olympians.
King Doped to Win
Card fans are confident that Tem
pleton's javelin men are capable of
better marks than they turned in
against U.S.C., and Bob King had to
leap only 5 feet 11 inches to win the
high jump in the Trojan meet. Five
feet eleven inches is just enough to
get King limbered up.
With Swede Leistner, former Card
stickman, in the running, West and
Nicholas should get some competi
tion in the hurdles, but those two
gentlemen seem capable of grabbing
a comfortable number of points in
any competition.
Opponents No Set-Up
The Olympians are not to be taken
with too much levity, however. Their
success against California is not im
pressive, to be sure, but the strength
of club teams is always uncertain, and
the margin of Stanford's win may not
loom as large as is anticipated in
some circles.
