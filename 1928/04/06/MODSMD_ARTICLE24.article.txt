# On Rushing—For Freshmen
## 
### 
Monday noon fraternity rushing starts, and will continue for several
weeks. Stanford has regulations for rushing that are quite different from
those in other colleges. All first-year men being required to live in Encina,
they are not allowed to join a fraternity until the prescribed and legal
pledging date, after having had a chance to visit the various fraternities to
which they have been invited during the rushing period.
The reason for these regulations is based on a policy of giving both
the houses and the rushees an opportunity to know more of each other
than is possible in the "knock-down and drag-out" method. In addition,
the local plan allows the freshman to become adjusted to the University
and its ways, and to meet his classmates on an even footing.
However, in spite of all the safeguards in the present system, it is
impossible for all the first-year men to be acquainted with the fraternities,
for they can have no contacts with them except during the regular periods,
and then they find the various chapters on "good behavior." Ilence it is
merely good advice to say "look before you leap." It is not sensible to
allow one's eagerness to get into just any fraternity carry him away, for
he may find himself in a very unhappy situation.
It must not be understood that joining a fraternity is deprecated in
any way. Whether or not one should join is a moot question, and must be
decided individually, for it is entirely a personal matter. There are advan
tages and also disadvantages in belonging to a house, most of which every
one has heard discussed time and again. One is more apt to form closer
friendships when living with a smaller group, but by that very fact is also
liable to have his friendships limited in number. Since fraternities are
anxious to have their men active, the individual will find more of an incen
tive to work, and very likely more help. It is, however, well to remember
that one's own individuality should not be too much sacrificed.
This year's handbook has four things which it would l>e well for every
man to consider before he makes up his mind :
1. The character, reputation, and ideals of the national organization.
2. The object and general purpose, or policy, of the fraternity.
3. The character of the men in the local chapter. Are they the kind of
men you wish to emulate ?
4. The expense—dues, assessments, board, room rent, etc.
The best thing for the rushee to do is to go to the fraternities that in
vite him, look things over, listen to what the men have to say, and, keeping
his tongue in his check, sit down by himself and decide what he wants most.

The best thing for the rushee to do is to go to the fraternities that in
vite him, look things over, listen to what the men have to say, and, keeping
his tongue in his check, sit down by himself and decide what he wants most.
Monday noon fraternity rushing starts, and will continue for several
weeks. Stanford has regulations for rushing that are quite different from
those in other colleges. All first-year men being required to live in Encina,
they are not allowed to join a fraternity until the prescribed and legal
pledging date, after having had a chance to visit the various fraternities to
which they have been invited during the rushing period.
The reason for these regulations is based on a policy of giving both
the houses and the rushees an opportunity to know more of each other
than is possible in the "knock-down and drag-out" method. In addition,
the local plan allows the freshman to become adjusted to the University
and its ways, and to meet his classmates on an even footing.
However, in spite of all the safeguards in the present system, it is
impossible for all the first-year men to be acquainted with the fraternities,
for they can have no contacts with them except during the regular periods,
and then they find the various chapters on "good behavior." Ilence it is
merely good advice to say "look before you leap." It is not sensible to
allow one's eagerness to get into just any fraternity carry him away, for
he may find himself in a very unhappy situation.
It must not be understood that joining a fraternity is deprecated in
any way. Whether or not one should join is a moot question, and must be
decided individually, for it is entirely a personal matter. There are advan
tages and also disadvantages in belonging to a house, most of which every
one has heard discussed time and again. One is more apt to form closer
friendships when living with a smaller group, but by that very fact is also
liable to have his friendships limited in number. Since fraternities are
anxious to have their men active, the individual will find more of an incen
tive to work, and very likely more help. It is, however, well to remember
that one's own individuality should not be too much sacrificed.
This year's handbook has four things which it would l>e well for every
man to consider before he makes up his mind :
1. The character, reputation, and ideals of the national organization.
2. The object and general purpose, or policy, of the fraternity.
3. The character of the men in the local chapter. Are they the kind of
men you wish to emulate ?
4. The expense—dues, assessments, board, room rent, etc.
