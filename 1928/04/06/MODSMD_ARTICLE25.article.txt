A movement to prevent the return to the United States of the former
Maharajah of Indore and his bride, who was formerly Nancy Ann
Miller of Seattle, was started in the Washington city yesterday, it is
learned from news dispatches. The group interested in refusing admission
to Nancy Ann and her husband is the Women's Home Missionary Society
of the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church. The society, it is said, will
ask the Women's Foreign Missionary Society to start a nation-wide move
ment for this purpose.
The objection voiced by the president of the society is that "the former
Miss Miller and her Hindu husband .... do not stand for the principles of
Christianity and because they will come here to spread their belief through
out a Christian nation." She also says further: "Our society is working
hard to further the interests of Christianity throughout the world and most
seriously objects to the encroachment on its work by a foreign religion."
The women of this society seem to forget that one of the great boasts
of these United States is that we have religious freedom. They evidently
also consider that their tenets and those of Christianity are the only ones
worth listening to. They might find out many interesting and enlightening
things if they'd look at the other side. They also might find there isn't so
much difference, after all.
