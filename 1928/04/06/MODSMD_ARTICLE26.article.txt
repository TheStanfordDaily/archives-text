# Looking Ahead a Little

Tomorrow night the Masque Ball will be reinstated on the campus. Its
continuance year after year depends upon how the students are able to
handle themselves. The administration has been of the opinion that the
campus in general thinks the affair is going to be a "brawl." This is not
the case.
Men's Council will see that any infractions of the social rules are
strictly dealt with, and the Rally Committee is pledged to see that the
students comport themselves as Stanford men and women should.
It is hoped that no action will be required of either the Council or the
Committee. The Ball is one party at which everyone can enjoy himself
informally, but it would be extremely foolish to overdo the thing and have
this dance banned in the future.

Dr. Edward R. Weidlein, of the Mellon Institute of Pittsburgh, makes
the statement that "personality is worth more to a student than grades."
And it takes a lot of personality to sell bonds these days, too.
