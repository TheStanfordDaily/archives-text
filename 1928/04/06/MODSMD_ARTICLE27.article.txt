"Mr. Hodge & Mr. Hazard," by Elinor
Wylie. Alfred A. Knopf.
"The novel of Mr. Hodge and Mr.
Hazard is an everyday fable; its histori
cal trappings are slight, and it must re
main not a disguised biography but a
brief symbolic romance of the mind . . . .
the central figure is ... . evidently the
victim of an excessive sensibility which
the high order of his talents failed to
stiffen into character The author
has formed this little image of an ideal
ist from various clays . . . ."
And what Elinor Wylie herself has
said about her book in the preface is far
better than we can attempt. We find her
always charming, and even more so here
than in "Orphan Angel." The romantic
spirit is lightly caught, as suits its ephem
eral nature, as was the personality of the
Suntreader in her former book.
Beauty in Lyric Spirit
With the beauty of the lyric spirit she
draws, you are almost unconscious and
unaware of those voluminous draperies
and petticoats Queen Victoria was spread
ing so amply over England during the
period of this novel. Mr. Hodge, Mr.
Hazard's antithesis, is like an ostrich
plume on the top of one of Victoria's
extraordinary hats, and waves as positive
a rebuttal of Hazard's pretty dreams as
one of the lady's own nods would have.
Mr. Hodge, fortunately, does not appear
until we have enjoyed Mr. Hazard's sen
sibilities through the majority of the vol

ume.
It is a difficult book to criticize—except
in a chaotic disorganized fashion. If we
must come down to earth, and be prac
tically minded about it, however: it is
very fortunate indeed for the students of
this University, now enrolled in the two
courses of Victorian literature — since
Miss Wylie's new book is the pleasantest
way possible to obtain a conception of the
early part of the period, and of the gen
tlemen literati worthy of notice. You can
pick up fascinating snatches of sugges
tions (for instance, that Tennyson was
not ludicrous when he tuned his harp to
Victoria).
We would like to appeal to the malig
nant side of human nature by slamming
this book long and merrily in the worst
invectives we have in mind—if it would
stir a few of the rather atrophied minds
on this campus to read. But the book is
too fine for blasphemy. We do hope some
will read it, though—it's an ideal tonic
for the spring.
Glee Club on Stage
And by the way, speaking of theatres,
which of course we weren't, it seems that
the Stanford Glee Club will provide a
good portion of the Easter Sunday pro
gram for the San Jose California Thea
tre. We don't know the exact nature of
their performance but anyway there is a
Fanchon & Marco show and a feature
film to augment them.
