### Vern Cordry 
The Lost Epic of Lagunita
"Went plus, b'gosh!" shouted
Archie, as he popped into the office.
"I'm so darn pleased that I'm not at
all annoyed by a late registration fee,
a late gym fine, a late room rent as
sessment, and a dearth of seat cards
in four of my five courses. I went plus
last quarter!"
"How did your brother Oswald do,
Archie?"
"He went true to the name of
Tewksbury—on 'pro.' I was kinda
pleased. Y'know after he went plus
liis first quarter the family made
some very personal remarks to me.
Wanted to know why my little broth
er was showing me up. They're not so
tough on me now."
"Did you write anything for the
first issue?"
"Neither did you. I've seen all the
papers."
"It's high time we start. What'll it
be?"
"Well, it's an old custom to start
with a poem about Lagunita."
"Will you rime it with 'senorita,' or
write a wop dialect mess featuring
'wet feeta'?"
"Rotten!"
"Let's use the one the Oxford trans
fer sent us last year. That one called
'The Bawth'."
"I've forgotten it. Whistle the pat
ter."
"It goes like this —
f stood up,
The bloomin' craft
Began to teetah.
Bah Jove, but Lagunita
Is cold in Spring.
"If we're going to use old stuff we
ought to use that petting poem—it'll
go over big with the roughs and
Roble. I'll read it —
While moonlight shines
On shadowed lake,
Concentric lines
Move out and break
Beneath the willows—
Round the floats,
Are wavering forms
Of drifting boats.
Who ride in this
Uncharted way,
Unguided on
The surface sway?
They like a course
That's undefined —
The drifters aren't
The paddling kind!
"All wrong!" said Archie. "Let's
have something quiet, something pas
toral." He picked up a pencil and
began to write. "How does this
sound —
A bowl of shimmering green,
Set like an emerald iri green hilis.
Rimmed by billowing oaks
Which hover at the water's edge,
Like sylvan angels "
"Hey, you guys! Quit moonin'. It's
time to go to press!"
"Too bad," said Archie sadly, "we'll
have to press-agent old Lagunita some
other time."
"Press-agent Lagunita! Didn't you
see the crowd up there yesterday
afternoon ?"

ought to use that petting poem—it'll
go over big with the roughs and
Roble. I'll read it —
While moonlight shines
On shadowed lake,
Concentric lines
Move out and break
Beneath the willows—
Round the floats,
Are wavering forms
Of drifting boats.
Who ride in this
Uncharted way,
Unguided on
The surface sway?
They like a course
That's undefined —
The drifters aren't
The paddling kind!
"All wrong!" said Archie. "Let's
have something quiet, something pas
toral." He picked up a pencil and
began to write. "How does this
sound —
A bowl of shimmering green,
Set like an emerald iri green hilis.
Rimmed by billowing oaks
Which hover at the water's edge,
Like sylvan angels "
"Hey, you guys! Quit moonin'. It's
time to go to press!"
"Too bad," said Archie sadly, "we'll
have to press-agent old Lagunita some
other time."
"Press-agent Lagunita! Didn't you
see the crowd up there yesterday
afternoon ?"
The Lost Epic of Lagunita
"Went plus, b'gosh!" shouted
Archie, as he popped into the office.
"I'm so darn pleased that I'm not at
all annoyed by a late registration fee,
a late gym fine, a late room rent as
sessment, and a dearth of seat cards
in four of my five courses. I went plus
last quarter!"
"How did your brother Oswald do,
Archie?"
"He went true to the name of
Tewksbury—on 'pro.' I was kinda
pleased. Y'know after he went plus
liis first quarter the family made
some very personal remarks to me.
Wanted to know why my little broth
er was showing me up. They're not so
tough on me now."
"Did you write anything for the
first issue?"
"Neither did you. I've seen all the
papers."
"It's high time we start. What'll it
be?"
"Well, it's an old custom to start
with a poem about Lagunita."
"Will you rime it with 'senorita,' or
write a wop dialect mess featuring
'wet feeta'?"
"Rotten!"
"Let's use the one the Oxford trans
fer sent us last year. That one called
'The Bawth'."
"I've forgotten it. Whistle the pat
ter."
"It goes like this —
f stood up,
The bloomin' craft
Began to teetah.
Bah Jove, but Lagunita
Is cold in Spring.
