SEATTLE, April s.—(P.l.P.)—Pros-1
pccts for a prosperous season in football
next fall are reported poor at the Uni
versity of Washington. In tlie first turn
out of the year for spring practice Mon
day, only two lettermen and live others
from the varsity squad of last season,
showed up. The lettermen are Chuck
Carrol and Elliot Pulver, back field stars.
Promising material from the frosh squad
of last season helps to dispel the gloom .
of Coach Enoch Bagshaw on the outlook.
