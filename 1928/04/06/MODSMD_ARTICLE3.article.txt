KANSAS CITY, Mo., April 5. —
(U.P.) —The bodies of six victims were
recovered today, four other persons were
missing, and hundreds were left home
less in a series of severe windstorms and
cloudbursts which swept the Southwest
last night.
The states of Kansas, Oklahoma,
Texas, and Arkansas were hit by the
storms, which apparently centered at
Shawnee, Okla., where a disturbance
reached tornado proportions and left four
dead in its wake. Topeka, Kans., and
Lincoln. Ark., each reported one killed
in windstorms.
Damage totaled more than $1,000,000 in
the four states and may go higher when
a complete check has been made.
A cloudburst accompanied the cyclonic
winds at Shawnee and six feet of water
ran through the streets. Two of the four
killed in Shawnee were found lying in
the street when the raging waters sub
sided.
Fears were felt that four other missing
were swept away by the waters and car
ried into the North Canadian River.
Approximately 200 families were left
homeless in Shawnee and business men of
the city met to provide relief for the
victims. All relief agencies including the
National Red Cross were asked to co
operate in aiding the sufferers.
