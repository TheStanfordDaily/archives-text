It would seem that quite a number of :
people would like to be reporters. At
least, a lot of students have come over to
try out for the newspaper.
I'm sure they are all welcome, because
we do need some good reporters. I mean, i
every paper should have new material if
it is possible. And they all do look so
interesting and fresh, and full of ideas,!
if you know what I mean.
And they are all so serious-minded. Of j
course everyone on our paper now is very '
serious-minded. It really is appalling. I
mean, at times I don't understand just :
what everything means. But the Editor
told me that if I read each column every j
day, why 1 wouldn't have any trouble at i
all keeping up with things.
Our paper does try to get the best news !
in the best and safest way, especially that
of worldly interest. I hope all the try- j
outees realize that our paper is free from
scandal and vicious policies, like dealing
in personalities and misunderstood arti
cles. Of course, our big policy is to pub
lish all the campus news here and there.
But then, when something big really
happens like an earthquake or a war or
something, we give a whole paragraph on
the front page to it. It really is exciting,
being on a paper, you know.
