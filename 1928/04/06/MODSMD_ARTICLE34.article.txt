LONDON, April S.—(U.P.) —A long
fight by British rubber men to control
world prices—a fight which affected every
consumer of rubber goods from motor
tires to nursing-bottle nipples—failed dis
astrously today.
Prime Minister Baldwin announced in
the House of Commons that the Steven
son rubber restriction scheme would be
abandoned as from November 1.
The scheme was imposed six years ago.
It limited exportation of rubber from
British growing countries so that when
prices went down, so did the rubber out
put.
Foreign rubber men fought it bitterly.
Before the scheme was imposed they had
tried to depress the market, so that Great
Britain claimed the scheme was defen
sive. Its effect, however, was to send rub
ber prices skyrocketing when American
rubber men, their stocks depleted when
they held back for low prices, had to buy
big quantities.
