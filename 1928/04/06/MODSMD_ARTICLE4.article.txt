# BORAH WILL ENLIVEN PROCEEDINGS OF G.O.P. NATIONAL CONVENTION

WASHINGTON, D.C., April S. —
(U.P.) —Senator Borah of Idaho is pre
pared to do his best toward enlivening
the proceedings of the Republican Na
tional Convention in Kansas City.
He expects to be a member of the
Idaho delegation and probably will be
on the resolutions committee which drafts
the platform.
Two matters lie close to his heart in
connection with the platform. One is a
bone-dry prohibition plank instead of the
simple law enforcement declaration which
the party usually adopts. The other is a
strong, direct statement regarding the
oil scandals.
The point of Senator Borah's sword
has been somewhat blunted by the failure
of the public to respond to his appeal for
$160,000 to pay back Harry F. Sinclair's
Republican campaign contribution. He
has collected only $7,000. But he is not
through.
"You can bet the party is going to
hear more about this until it returns the
stolen goods," Borah said when asked if
he was becoming discouraged. "I haven't
lost faith in the American people. The
leaders of the party to whom substantial
contributors look are opposed to this but
I think the situation will be different by
the time we get through with it."
