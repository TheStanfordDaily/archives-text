# YEARLING TRACKSTERS CENTERING ATTENTION ON LITTLE BIG MEET
## 
### 
With possibilities of arranging a meet
for the Stanford freshman track team
tomorrow vanished, the yearling outfit
will center their attention upon the Little
Big Meet scheduled for April 13. Mur
ray Draper, track manager, said yester
day that the College of the Pacific would
be unable to come and that he had little
hope of arranging a contest for this week
end.
The cancellation of the interclass re
lays because of the varsity-Olympic Club
meet Saturday will deprive the 1931 team
from any chance to test themselves
against outside competition before the
California contest.
Two weeks of good weather will give
the freshman squad an opportunity to be
in their best condition of the season. De
spite the vacation layoff and the wet
track, the team will be in a condition to
make some surprisingly good records
when they meet the Bear Cubs.
The frosh stars will put one of the best
teams in years upon the field April 13.
Comparative records for the season give
the babes an overwhelming victory and
the California part in the meet will be to
keep the score down.
Templeton has given no indication
whom he will take down to the Berkeley
meet and competition will be keen among
the freshmen for places among the three
Cardinal entries in each event.

Dr. Moore of U.C.L.A. states that
there will be no more monthly assem
blies unless the attendance is In
creased. He feels that the effort ex
pended in getting speakers for these
assemblies is not repaid by the usual
attendance of less than 200 students.
