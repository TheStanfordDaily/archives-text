# PENNANTS, BLACK AND GOLD, WILL DECORATE SCENE OF MERRIMENT
## Motley Throng Will Gather Around King's Throne In Masque Ball 
### 
Hundreds of carnival pennants will be
lning from the ceiling of the Pavilion
next Saturday night to transform it to a
royal throne room for King David
Adams of the Masque Ball. Black and
gold will cover the walls, and the throne
from which the King will view the royal
revelry.
It will he an international throng that
makes merriment from 7 :48 o'clock until
12 o'clock of Saturday night, for Rus
sians, Turks, Japanese, Indians, and
American colonials will mingle with
Pucks, goblins, prime ministers, and
princes in frolic and gaiety. Stanford
will forget its student responsibilities for
one night, and become a melting pot of
strange and exotic personalities.
Any type of costume is permitted, but
no one, regardless of race, sex, impor
tance, or previous condition of servitude
will be admitted into the precincts of the
royal throne room without a costume.
Masks are required of every reveler.
At 10:30 o'clock the coronation cere
mony will take place. An elaborate pan
tomime and procession is being evolved
by Jack Shoup and Hock Chalmers.
Blake and Amber, costutners from San
Francisco, will be on the campus all day
tuday and tomorrow in the Pavilion to
rent costumed to students. This company
has recently purchased the entire stock of
Norman's in San Francisco, and so a
wide choice of periods and styles in cos
tumes is available.
