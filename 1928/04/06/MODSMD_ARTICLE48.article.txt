### 
Taking four out of the six matches
played on the varsity courts yesterday
afternoon, the varsity tennis team easily
defeated the Southern California squad.
The most evenly fought match of the day
was played by Gomer Thomas, number
four man, against Francis Hardy. Hardy
took the first set 6-3, but Thomas came
back in the second and took it with ease
6-1. He won the match by winning the
third set 6-4.
A1 Herrington Wins
A1 Herrington defeated Theron Wil
son, the first man on the Southern Cali
fornia team, 6-2, 6-3 in straight sets, and
John Wheatley downed Bob Bagley also
in straight sets, 6-1, 6-4. Because Ralph
McElvenny had not registered yet, he
was ineligible to play and Ernest Renzel
took his place, losing his match to Bob
Gates 6-0, 6-4.
McElvenny had registered by the time
the doubles matches were played so that
lie and Herrington paired off to defeat
Wilson and Hardy 6-2, 6-0.
Wheatley, Thomas Downed
Wheatley and Thomas were unable to
withstand the attack of Gates and Bagley,
perhaps because of Thomas' stiff first
match against Hardy, consequently they
were defeated 2-6, 3-6.
This was the fifth consecutive win of
the varsity tennis team and will be the
last match before the California meet on
April 14 at Berkeley.
