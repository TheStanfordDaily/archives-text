## 
###

organized in the women's physical edu
cation department, in addition to the
classes in elementary, intermediate, and
advanced tennis. No instruction is given

provide practice work. Later in the quar
ter a continuous round robin tournament
will be played during class hours.
The classes in swimming, diving, and
tennis are filled to capacity, and those
in archery, track, and dancing have also
a large number entered. Swimming seems
to be very popular, having an enrollment
of 125, and the others vary in size from
80 to 35.
Captains in the various sports will be
elected as soon as the classes have gotten
under way, probably in one or two weeks.

diana University were not allowed to ride
beyond the city limits in a horse and
buggy.
