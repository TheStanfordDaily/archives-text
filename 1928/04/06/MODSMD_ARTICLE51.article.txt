BERKELEY, April 5. — (P.1.P.) —
California's track men are heavy favor
ites to triumph over the U.C.L.A. Bruins
when the two teams clash on the oval
here Saturday. Coach Walt Christie, vet
eran mentor of the Bears, however, feels
that the outcome is still somewhat uncer
tain, and has been pushing his men to the
limit all week.
California is certain to take a majority
of points in the broad jump, half-mile,
and the 220. The Bruins are conceded the
honors in the pole vault and the high
jump and have a fighting chance of cop
ping the meet if they finish men in the
right positions in several of the undecided
events.
Both the mile and two-mile races
should be good with Careton Wait of
U.C.L.A. featured in both. Waite will
run against Cherry in the mile and
against Wayne Fox in the longer event.
Both races are a toss-up and will count
much to decide the outcome. Tommy
Myles, Bruin sprint star, is doped to place
second to Ewing in the century and third
in the 220. Bruin supporters arc confi
dent that he will cut in for more points
than northern rooters credit him.

Contrary to custom, the senior men
of the University of California will
not wear caps and gowns at the Bac
calaureate exercises for the class of
'28 on May 13. The dress for the
senior women has not yet been de
cided upon.
