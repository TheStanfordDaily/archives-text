# Yearlings Are Favored Over U.C. Babe Nine
## 
### 
With the question of who will cover
third base still unsettled, Coach Husky
Hunt's yearling baseball men will never
theless enter the first game of the 1928
series with the California frosh with the
odds slightly favoring the Stanford team.
The contest is scheduled to be played at
3:30 o'clock tomorrow on the varsity dia
mond.
Hedge May Play
Coach Hunt still maintains a slim hope
that Norman Hedge, regular third sacker
who was declared ineligible last week,
will be reinstated in time to play. If
Hedge is not available, Jim Mears or
Art McGarr will see action. Mears has
been playing in Hedge's position for the
last few nights, while McGarr is regu
larly a second baseman. Mears was a
member of the yearling basketball squad
and has been reporting for baseball prac
tice for only a few weeks. His defensive
work is still ragged. Mears, however, is
a fine batter and would be a great asset
to the Stanford team in this department.
Story Will Start
Don Story, stellar freshman hurling
ace, has been selected to pitch in tomor
row's game and "Spud" Hardy will catch.
Following is a complete Stanford lineup:
Magee, 2b; Johnson, ss; Hunken (C),
If; Teague, lb; Mears or McGarr, 3b;
Allen, cf; Hardy, c; Wittenau, rf; Story,
P.
Bear Offense Strong
California presents a strong team which
is particularly impressive in its offensive
work. Whether Don Story and the highly
touted Cardinal infield can hold the Blue
and Gold batting attack is a question that
will be settled only tomorrow.
The Stanford babes did well in a light
hitting practice last night. Nearly every
man knocked several good hits deep into
the outfield. Hunt has ordered another
light hitting session for this afternoon
as a final wind-up practice.
