# Huskies, Bears Prepared For Crew Regatta
## 
### 
The University of California's varsity,
junior varsity, and freshman crews are
ready for the starter's gun which will
send them off on Lake Washington at
Seattle today against the University of
Washington oarsmen in the twenty-fifth
annual regatta for the supremacy of the
Pacific Coast. The Husky varsity and
jayvees lost to California on a three
mile course and the yearlings over two
miles, last year.
Rough water has hindered the Blue
and Gold eights from making time trials
over the course, but Coach Ky Ebright
of the Bears said he was not worried over
that fact. Only light practice with a few
racing starts was the program for the
oarsmen during the last two days.
