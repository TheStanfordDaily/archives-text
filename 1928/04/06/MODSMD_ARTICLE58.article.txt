# Cards Glven Edge Over Bears In Initial Diamond Tilt Tomorrow
## 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter will take Cardi-!
nal baseball men to Berkeley tomorrow >
for the initial contest of the 1928 big
series. By virtue of the poor fielding
that the Bears have been exhibiting all
season, betting odds will decidedly favor
Stanford.
California has the inglorious record of 1
chalking up twenty-five errors in four
games on their recent southern tour. ,
Coach Zamloch's men have been playing j
up and down baseball, with too many |
downs to really be slated as a strong ag- ;
gregation. Their batting work and es-'
pecially that of Bob Stevenson is above
the average. If California wins from |
Stanford tomorrow, it will be the result'
of a Berkeley slugfest.
Coach Wolter presents a well-balanced
team which is making a determined bid ;
for the conference championship. Bob
Sims, Johnny Levin, and Cook Sypher
are hitters of no mean ability themselves
and promise to give the Berkeley pitcher
plenty of trouble.
Wolter will start the regular lineup
with Kern, Sobieski, Philippi, or Lewis
in the box.
