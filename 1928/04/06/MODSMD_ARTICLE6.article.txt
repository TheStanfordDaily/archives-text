# Sovereign Consoles Self With New Consort; Mariana Evans Is Queen
## Revelries Commence at 7:48, None Eligible Without Mask, Costume

"It just kinda happened," said King
David Adams last niglit in comment
ing on the Sudden abdication of the
Queen of the Masque Ball, and the
royal upset in Stanford politics when
it was discovered that there was no
Queen to rule the Kingdom, and the
King.
"I went out to look for a Queen,
and oh —well —it just kinda happened
again, and Mariana Evans said she
would help me rule my people from
the throne of the Masque Ball Satur
day night. I'm only sorry that I can't
have two queens," said the sovereign
whimsically.
Throne Room Described
King David went on with a descrip
tion of the throne room. "No one
would ever believe it was actually
our Stanford Pavilion. Thousands of
carnival pennants will be hung from
the ceiling, while black and gold
royal drapes, royally draped by Ted
Krough and his assistants, will cover
the sides. And we'll have all sorts of
fun with the favors," continued the
King playfully.
"No one will be permitted to enter
the Kingdom of revelry without a cos
tume and a mask. It wouldn't be any
fun, you know, if everybody knew
everybody else. It's the mystery ele
ment that makes the gaieties more
gay.

"My public will be changed tomor
row night when 7:48 o'clock rolls
around. No longer will it be a group
of Stanford students, but a conglom
erate mass of Turks, Russians, Japa
nese, Chinese, Egyptians, and even
an Indian or so, to say nothing of the
fairy-book characters like Puck, or
Aladdin, or the little red hen. Maybe
Peter Rabbit will be there!
"Every kingdom must have an in
ternal as well as a foreign policy, so
my Royal Parliament, alias the Rally
Committee, will be on hand to see
that all affairs of state run smoothly
and according to the Iloyle of Masque
Balls."
Coronation Planned
When asked about the crown, the
King said humbly: "I feel it will be
a great honor to wear the Stanford
crown jewels for a night. After the
Grand March there will be an elabor
ate coronation ceremony which Jack
Shoup and Hock Chalmers have
evolved. Then Mariana and I will be
crowned and look on the merry
makers for the rest of the evening."
Blake and Amber, costumers from
San Francisco, will be in the Pavilion
to rent costumes to students all day
today and tomorrow. This company
has recently purchased the entire
stock of Norman's in San Francisco,
and thus possesses a great variety of
costumes from which to choose.
