## Cook Sypher, Stocky Catcher Plays Great Game, Hits Homer, Two Singles TROJAN FIELDING GOOD Chance of Lifetime Comes to Cards in Ninth With Two Men on Base 
### Frank Whitely 
Failure to score with three men on base
in the ninth inning, yesterday, cost Stan
ford the third and deciding game of the
conference baseball series with Southern
California, 4-2, in a thrilling ten innings
intermixed with good and bad baseball.
The Trojans crossed the plate twice in
the first of the tenth to put the game on
ice.
Cards Flop in Ninth
Stanford's usance of a life-time to take
the game came in the ninth when, with
Maguire and Sypher on base and but one
out, Harder was walked. Laird, the next
man up, struck out, and was followed by
Philippi, who got a weak infield hit to
force Harder out at second and end the
inning. In the tenth the first U.S.C. man
up was put out at first. Van Aspe, the
next man up, got a single to right field
and was forced to second by F. Welch,
who was hit by pitcher. An error by
Busch allowed Van Aspe to score, and a
sacrifice fly to left field permitted Welch
to cross the home plate. Busch was the
only Card to get a hit in the last of the
tenth, but this did not materialize into a
run. Good-bye, game.
Cook Sypher, stocky Stanford catcher,
was in great form yesterday, pounding
out a homer and two singles in three
times at bat. Busch, shortstop, was also
going good, knocking out the offerings
of the Trojan hurlers for a double and
two singles in three times at bat. Four
errors proved costly for Stanford. Three
resulted in runs for the other side. The
fielding of the Trojans was considerably
better.
