## Stanford Professor Visits Important Countries In West Indies

"Summing up American intervention it
Haiti, my own personal feeling is thai
while mistakes have been made in the
past because of excessive zeal, or the
desire for too quick results, the American
occupation has been distinctly beneficent,'
said Dr. Percy A. Martin, professor oi
History, yesterday in an interview.
Dr. Martin has just returned from a
trip to the West Indies, where lie repre
sented Stanford University at the twen
ty-fifth anniversary of the founding of
the University of Porto Rico.
"If the United States," continued Mar
tin, "carries out its announced policy of
withdrawing at the end of eight years,
and can train up a corps of efficient Hai
tians to carry on the constructive work
initiated by the Americans, the United
States intervention in the affairs of
Haiti will have been justified."
Seventy Attend Meet
Professor Martin left New York for
Porto Rico on March first. Among the
esventy delegates to the anniversary cele
bration of the Porto Rican university
were President Ferrand of Cornell, Pres
ident Jessup of lowa State, and Dean
Woodbridge of Columbia.
"The island is one of the most beauti
ful in the West Indies. There is a
blending of the Spanish and American
types of civilization that is most inter
esting. Porto Rico is becoming a bi
lingual country. English is taught as far
as the first four grades as a foreign lan
guage; from then on through the high
schools and universities it is the language
of instruction.
Porto Ricans Cordial
"There is a genuine feeling of cordial
ity and friendship between the United
States and Porto Rico. It is the desire of
politicians and statesmen to have the is
land granted the status of statehood, but
most of these men relize that the time-is
not yet opportune for this step. This was
the sentiment expressed to me by Senor
Barcelo, Porto Rico's leading public
man."
From Porto Rico Dr. Martin flew by
airplane to Santo Domingo. There he
met the president and a number of gov
ernment officials. "The Dominican Re
public feels that the United States has
kept its promise," Dr. Martin stated.
"When we took over the administration
of Santo Domingo in 1916 we said we
would withdraw. Three years ago we re
linquished entire control with the excep
tion of administration of customs. The
Dominican Republic is once more re
stored to the position of an independent
state."
Martin Visits Haiti
Martin next flew to the negro republic
of Haiti which occupies the western end
of the island of Santo Domingo. Here he
made a special study of American inter
vention and its problems. "I was greatly
impressed with the earnestness and effi
ciency of the American officials. The Bu-\
reau of Hygiene has established dispell- j
saries, clinics, and hospitals throughout j
the republic. The Department of Agri-!
culture, in addition to launching an ex- j
cellent school of agriculture near the
capital, has established a number of ex- j
perimental stations, a large number of i
rural schools, and some twelve trade!
schools.
"President Born informed me that he!
was fully convinced not only of the great |
services which the American government
was rendering Haiti, but he was equally
convinced of our disinterestedness."
Professor Martin returned from this
trip on April 4.
