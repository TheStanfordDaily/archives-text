# CHAUNCEY M. DEPEW DIES IN NEW YORK OF BRONCHIAL PNEUMONIA
## Famous Speaker, Statesman, Politician Was 93 at Time of Death 
### 
NEW YORK, April 5. — (U.P.) —
j Chauncey M. Depew is dead. Like the
! unexpected finis to an absorbing classic
I mirroring the life and fashions of a
; nation, the public learned today that at
(4:20 o'clock tbis morning he died of
j bronchial pneumonia.
He was 93 years old and on April 23,
had he not caught a cold when he re
| turned from Florida to his New York
i home, he would have been 94, and there
would have been another of those birth
jdav interviews to supply witty comment
and occasionally pungent advice to the
nation be saw grow from a backwoods
settlement to a world power.
Bronchial pneumonia, as is well known
by this time, finished in "little more than
| nine hours the man whose body and mind
j had withstood the assaults of nearly a
century of time. Depew met his biggest
moment without a ready epigram. He
was unconscious when he died, perhaps
mercifully so, for he had hoped to live
to be 100.
Depew had a good time while he lived
—he lived a long time and his death left a
vacancy in the ranks of successful gentle
man-wits of the world for which no im
mediate successor has been mentioned.
He made it a point to be kindly and
amusing even where wisdom did not
strike him as essential; and as for being
a gentleman, he came by that naturally.
It was no effort.
Depew died the chairman of the board
of directors' of the New York Central
railroad and the most famous of Ameri
enn after-dinner speakers. He was also a
statesman and politician, notable in the
latter classification for having refused a
number of offices, including that of Secre
tary of State.
He was born in 1834 on a farm where
Peekskill, N.Y., now stands, where his
adolescent energy was expended in plow
ing corn and resisting his father's plan
for him to become a landed farmer and
his mother's ambition that he become a
clergyman. He went to Yale, graduating
in 1836 at the age of 22, and was admitted
to the bar of New York state two years
later. Yale was not a big college then,
but Depew succeeded in spending four
years there without attracting undue at

tention as a scholar. He was not preco
cious.
Young Depew enjoyed making speeches,
which was a mark of gentlemanly attain
ment in those benighted times, and as a
young lawyer he threw himself heart,
soul, and voice behind Fremont ("The
Pathfinder") and Dayton. Fremont was
snowed under by Buchanan by 496,905
votes despite the assistance of Depew.
He lived actively so long, held so many
positions, and knew intimately so many
fi.gures in political life from Lincoln to
Coolidge, so many educators from Wool
sey to Hadley, so many writers from
Ralph Waldo Emerson to Mark Twain,
and so many captains of industry from
Commodore Vanderbilt on, that he never
had time to pause and set down any
memoirs about them.
Historical figures, American and for
eign, were his in the background of their
times. He knew his knowledge of them
might be valuable and regretted his in
ability to set them, like jewels, in their
proper contemporary mountings for pos
terity. But a new crop was always sliow

ing up and Depew was too busy to get
around to it.
A fairly good history of half a cen
tury, however, may be found in his ora
tions and addresses at dinners, conven
tions, and many types of gatherings. De
pew was particularly good at interviews.
He always answered questions without
hesitation, evidently considering it a vio
lation of the rules of the game to retire
behind "nothing to say."
Depew married Miss Elise Hegeman in
1871 and a son, Chauncey Mitchell De
pew, Jr., was born to them. Mrs. Depew
died in March, 1893. Almost nine years
later, in December, 1901, Depew was
married to Miss May Palmer, who with
Chauncey, Jr., survives him.
Funeral services will be held Saturday
morning at 10:30 at St. Thomas' Episco
pal Church in Fifth Avenue, of which
Depew was a member. Interment will be
at the cemetery in Peekskill, where his
father and mother are buried.
A four-volume folio P>ible, printed in
Strassburg in 1480, has been given to
the Princeton University Library.

j Chauncey M. Depew is dead. Like the
! unexpected finis to an absorbing classic
I mirroring the life and fashions of a
; nation, the public learned today that at
(4:20 o'clock tbis morning he died of
j bronchial pneumonia.
He was 93 years old and on April 23,
had he not caught a cold when he re
| turned from Florida to his New York
i home, he would have been 94, and there
would have been another of those birth
jdav interviews to supply witty comment
and occasionally pungent advice to the
nation be saw grow from a backwoods
settlement to a world power.
Bronchial pneumonia, as is well known
by this time, finished in "little more than
| nine hours the man whose body and mind
j had withstood the assaults of nearly a
century of time. Depew met his biggest
moment without a ready epigram. He
was unconscious when he died, perhaps
mercifully so, for he had hoped to live
to be 100.
Depew had a good time while he lived
—he lived a long time and his death left a
vacancy in the ranks of successful gentle
man-wits of the world for which no im
mediate successor has been mentioned.
He made it a point to be kindly and
amusing even where wisdom did not
strike him as essential; and as for being
a gentleman, he came by that naturally.
It was no effort.
Depew died the chairman of the board
of directors' of the New York Central
railroad and the most famous of Ameri
enn after-dinner speakers. He was also a
statesman and politician, notable in the
latter classification for having refused a
number of offices, including that of Secre
tary of State.
He was born in 1834 on a farm where
Peekskill, N.Y., now stands, where his
adolescent energy was expended in plow
ing corn and resisting his father's plan
for him to become a landed farmer and
his mother's ambition that he become a
clergyman. He went to Yale, graduating
in 1836 at the age of 22, and was admitted
to the bar of New York state two years
later. Yale was not a big college then,
but Depew succeeded in spending four
years there without attracting undue at

tention as a scholar. He was not preco
cious.
Young Depew enjoyed making speeches,
which was a mark of gentlemanly attain
ment in those benighted times, and as a
young lawyer he threw himself heart,
soul, and voice behind Fremont ("The
Pathfinder") and Dayton. Fremont was
snowed under by Buchanan by 496,905
votes despite the assistance of Depew.
He lived actively so long, held so many
positions, and knew intimately so many
fi.gures in political life from Lincoln to
Coolidge, so many educators from Wool
sey to Hadley, so many writers from
Ralph Waldo Emerson to Mark Twain,
and so many captains of industry from
Commodore Vanderbilt on, that he never
had time to pause and set down any
memoirs about them.
Historical figures, American and for
eign, were his in the background of their
times. He knew his knowledge of them
might be valuable and regretted his in
ability to set them, like jewels, in their
proper contemporary mountings for pos
terity. But a new crop was always sliow

ing up and Depew was too busy to get
around to it.
A fairly good history of half a cen
tury, however, may be found in his ora
tions and addresses at dinners, conven
tions, and many types of gatherings. De
pew was particularly good at interviews.
He always answered questions without
hesitation, evidently considering it a vio
lation of the rules of the game to retire
behind "nothing to say."
Depew married Miss Elise Hegeman in
1871 and a son, Chauncey Mitchell De
pew, Jr., was born to them. Mrs. Depew
died in March, 1893. Almost nine years
later, in December, 1901, Depew was
married to Miss May Palmer, who with
Chauncey, Jr., survives him.
Funeral services will be held Saturday
morning at 10:30 at St. Thomas' Episco
pal Church in Fifth Avenue, of which
Depew was a member. Interment will be
at the cemetery in Peekskill, where his
father and mother are buried.
A four-volume folio P>ible, printed in
Strassburg in 1480, has been given to
the Princeton University Library.

was unconscious when he died, perhaps
mercifully so, for he had hoped to live
to be 100.
Depew had a good time while he lived
—he lived a long time and his death left a
vacancy in the ranks of successful gentle
man-wits of the world for which no im
mediate successor has been mentioned.
He made it a point to be kindly and
amusing even where wisdom did not
strike him as essential; and as for being
a gentleman, he came by that naturally.
It was no effort.
Depew died the chairman of the board
of directors' of the New York Central
railroad and the most famous of Ameri
enn after-dinner speakers. He was also a
statesman and politician, notable in the
latter classification for having refused a
number of offices, including that of Secre
tary of State.
He was born in 1834 on a farm where
Peekskill, N.Y., now stands, where his
adolescent energy was expended in plow
ing corn and resisting his father's plan
for him to become a landed farmer and
his mother's ambition that he become a
clergyman. He went to Yale, graduating
in 1836 at the age of 22, and was admitted
to the bar of New York state two years
later. Yale was not a big college then,
but Depew succeeded in spending four
years there without attracting undue at

tention as a scholar. He was not preco
cious.
Young Depew enjoyed making speeches,
which was a mark of gentlemanly attain
ment in those benighted times, and as a
young lawyer he threw himself heart,
soul, and voice behind Fremont ("The
Pathfinder") and Dayton. Fremont was
snowed under by Buchanan by 496,905
votes despite the assistance of Depew.
He lived actively so long, held so many
positions, and knew intimately so many
fi.gures in political life from Lincoln to
Coolidge, so many educators from Wool
sey to Hadley, so many writers from
Ralph Waldo Emerson to Mark Twain,
and so many captains of industry from
Commodore Vanderbilt on, that he never
had time to pause and set down any
memoirs about them.
Historical figures, American and for
eign, were his in the background of their
times. He knew his knowledge of them
might be valuable and regretted his in
ability to set them, like jewels, in their
proper contemporary mountings for pos
terity. But a new crop was always sliow

ing up and Depew was too busy to get
around to it.
A fairly good history of half a cen
tury, however, may be found in his ora
tions and addresses at dinners, conven
tions, and many types of gatherings. De
pew was particularly good at interviews.
He always answered questions without
hesitation, evidently considering it a vio
lation of the rules of the game to retire
behind "nothing to say."
Depew married Miss Elise Hegeman in
1871 and a son, Chauncey Mitchell De
pew, Jr., was born to them. Mrs. Depew
died in March, 1893. Almost nine years
later, in December, 1901, Depew was
married to Miss May Palmer, who with
Chauncey, Jr., survives him.
Funeral services will be held Saturday
morning at 10:30 at St. Thomas' Episco

Depew was a member. Interment will be
