# SPORTS OF 1928
## Easter Greetings 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
What with Easter coming so soon, and
the air full of talk of bunnies, rabbits,
eggs, and all that sort of thing, one's
thoughts might easily wander to a goose,
don't you think, especially if that goose
were connected with Our national pastime.
So here is "Goose" Goslin, of the Wash
ington Senators, who really has nothing
to do with Easter, except that he starts
his eighth season with Washington on
Easter Wednesday, with high hopes of
busting that old rabbit ball, or egg, right
on the nose as often as possible.
Leon Allen Goslin played a mere dozen
or so games for the Senators in 1921, and
since then he has been a consistent .300,
or better, hitter. Last year he slipped a
bit from his high mark of .354, made in
1926, and dropped to a figure twenty
points lower, but showed his speed by
stealing thirteen more bases than he did

the year before.
Our Easter Egg, Miss Eleanor Egg, of
Paterson, N.J., is joint holder of the girls'
50-yard dash record of 6 2-5 seconds,
made in her home town in December,
1924. Jll February, 1926, she set a new
indoor record in the running high jump,
clearing 4 feet 10 3-8 inches.
"Bunny" Ryan and "Rabbit" Maran
ville are not so young or spry as Miss
Egg, but are still able to do their bit in
an Easter tennis tournament or ball game.
Miss Ryan lias probably won more ten
nis prizes than any other woman player,
while Mr. Maranville has gotten in and
out of more scrapes than any other ball
player now in the majors. He bolstered
up the â€¢morale of the Cardinals 110 end
last fall, and should show many of the
youngsters a few tricks before summer
comes around.
