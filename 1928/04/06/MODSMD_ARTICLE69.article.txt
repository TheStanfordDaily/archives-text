A member of the Academic Council
subscribed to the dinner tendered
to President Wilbur on March 14,
but later sent in word that he was
unable to attend and requested the
return of his subscription. Through
inadvertence, the name of the pro
fessor to whom the return was to
be made has been mislaid. The
chairman of the dinner committee,
Dr. A. E. Taylor, will feel grateful
if the professor in question will
notify him so that his subscription
may be returned.
