# ORGANIZATION FORMED BY STUDENTS BACKING WALSH FOR PRESIDENT
## 
### 
A Stanford Walsh-for-President Club j
was organized on the campus yesterday
afternoon, and will start work immedi-!
ately among the student body, and in Palo
Alto and vicinity, to promote Thomas J.
Walsh, senator from Montana, as candi
date for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
It is the intention of the Club to get in j
touch with the state organization for |
Walsh in San Francisco, and co-operate !
with it in every way, says Leonard H. j
Kirkpatrick, president. Other officers are : i
vice-presidents, George E. Bodle, Bernard!
Ely, Robert A. Hume, Beverly McAnear, j
Gordon P. Shallenberger, Virgil K. Whit- j
aker; secretary-treasurer, Frederick M.'
Comhellack. Beverly McAnear states the i
platform of the organization as follows:
"We have chosen to support Thomas J.
Walsh for President because we believe
that he represents the very antithesis of
the leading candidate for the Republican
nomination, Herbert Hoover. It must be
remembered that it was Mr. Walsh who
unmasked the corruption of the govern
ment of which Mr. Hoover was a promi
nent cabinet member. The present un- j
employment which exists despite cam
paign slogans of prosperity, calls for a j
liberal progressive; we believe Mr. Walsh|
to be such a man. Accordingly in th**

face of present demands for sentimental
loyalty we insist upon the true Stanford j
tradition of independent thinking and so j
call all Stanford liberals to the support!
of Mr. Walsh."
