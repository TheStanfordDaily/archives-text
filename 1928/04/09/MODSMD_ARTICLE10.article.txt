# SCATTERGOOD TO TALK ON ENGINEER'S NEEDS
## 
### 
That the knowledge of human needs
and contact with the general public
are main fundamentals of a success
ful engineer is to be the central idea
of a talk by Ezra P. Scattergood, chief
engineer and general manager of the
Bureau of Power and Light of Los
Angeles, this morning at 11 o'clock
in the Little Theatre.
In an informal talk on the subject,
"The Engineer's Individual Qualifica
tions for Success," he will outline and
develop the above idea point by point.
Although a successful engineer has
to do with the fundamental principles
of the science, Mr. Scattergood be
lieves a broad foundation will enable
the student to develop ideas that will
be of great benefit.
