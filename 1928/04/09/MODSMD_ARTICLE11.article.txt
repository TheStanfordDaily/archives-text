Scoring two runs in the first inning
and four in the fourth, the California
Bears piled up an early-game lead suf
ficient to humble the Cardinal varsity
baseball nine 6-2 at West Field, Berke
ley, Saturday afternoon in the first
game of their annual series. The
Cards' batting was weak, and at no
time did they make a serious threat
to take the game, being unable to hit
in the pinches.
Nemechek, pitching for California,
hurled a fine game. At the start it
looked as though he would last just
about long enough for a relief tosser
to warm up. In the first three innings
he walked five men. However, he
proved to have plenty of control when
needed, and repeatedly retired men
after throwing over three balls. He
allowed but four hits.
Bears Hit Well
The California batters didn't waste
any time in breaking into the run
column. Maurice led off with a three
bagger to center field in the first in
ning and scored when Devore pounded
out a homer to right field.
"Doug" Lewis, who chucked the
first four innings for Stanford, was
decidedly off form, or rather he was
twirling the kind of balls the Bear
batters like to hit. After being
touched for those two long blows in
the first, he settled down to business
and retired the next nine men to face
him. Then came the disastrous fourth
when the Bear batters drove out three
singles and a double to score four
runs.
Coach Harry Wolter started Bob
Philippi on the mound in the fifth,
and the California sluggers were able
to get but one hit in the remaining
innings. In these four chapters only
fourteen men came to bat. His under
hand delivery and speed seemed to
fool the opposing hitters, and every
inning but the ninth they went out,
one-two-three, with pleasing regular
ity.
However, with the batting of the
Bears checked, the Cards were unable
to start any fireworks. In the eighth
an error by the California second
baseman put Sims on first; and a
single by Sypher, an error, and Gari
baldi's sacrifice permitted him to
score. Laird crossed the home plate
in the ninth to account for Stanford's
second and last tally.
Next Saturday the Cards will play
the Bears again on West Field, and
April 21, the third game of the series
will be played here.
