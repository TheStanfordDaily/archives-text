# APRIL ISSUE OF "LIT" GOES ON QUAD SALE TODAY; UNIQUE COVER
## 
### 
Appearing in an unique and strik
ing black and white cover, the April
issue of the Stanford "Lit" will go on
Quad sale this morning. This number
is unusually rich in its content of
stories, essays, and verse, proving of
considerable diversity in theme.
Among the contributions is a short
story by Marshall Somerville, entitled
"Jim Encounters the Dragon"â€”almost
original in character. Laird Doyle's
play, "And So He Went to Hell," is
an entertaining piece with its scene
laid in the courtroom before the Im
perial Court of Hades. Famous mod
ern characters and playwrights come
in for judgment before Satan "who is
bored, for it is Monday, and lots of
people go to Hell over the week-end."
The Bookshelf contains as its fea
ture, parallel columns of criticism
showing two opposing types of reac
tion to Upton Sinclair's recent book
"Oil!" One criticism was written by
a college student; tlie other by a
man who now has sons in college.
