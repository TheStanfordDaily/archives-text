# YEARLING NINE LOSES OPENING CONTEST OF CALIFORNIA CUB TILTS
## 
### 
Trying to stave off defeat by a
thrilling but unsuccessful rally in the
ninth inning, the Cardinal freshman
baseball team lost to the California
first-year nine by a 4 to 3 score in
the opening contest of a three-game
series here Saturday.
The Bear yearlings showed to ad
vantage in all departments of the
game. Horner, pitching for the visi
tors, kept the Stanford team's hits
well scattered and was only in diffi
culty in the seventh and ninth in
nings. Don Story, the Cardinal
mountlsman, pitched good ball, but
was a trifle wild, walking eight men.
He, however, had six strikeouts to his
credit in comparison to his opponent's
two. In the ninth inning he worked
himself into a tight place by allowing
a hit and walking two men. With the
bases loaded, Vard Loomis replaced
him and successfully checked the
Blue and Gold onslaught.
The outstanding player on the
Cardinal squad was "Spud" Hardy,
stocky catcher, who placed his team
in both the hit and the run columns
by knocking a home run over the left
field fence in the fifth inning. He made
a good sacrifice in the seventh and
got a long single in the ninth. He
tried to come all the way in from
second on Reynolds' double and was
called out at the plate. Thus vanished
Stanford's last chance to tie the score.
Mike Reynolds went in as a pinch
hitter in the seventh and garnered a
single and double in the only two
times he was at bat.
The California team made nine hits,
starting in the first inning, but were
only able to score in the third and
eighth Innings, obtaining two runs in
each. The Cards started in the fifth
with Hardy's home run, and a hit
accompanied by some loose playing
on the part of the visitors netted them
two more counts in the seventh and
put them ahead. Tlieir lead was short
lived, however, and the heart-break
ing aspect of the ninth frame made
it a hard game to lose.
