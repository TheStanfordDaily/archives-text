Undaunted by thoughts of the times
when they had home the Cardinal

tord athletes competed on the side
of the Olympic Club lust Saturday.
Three of them, Leistner, Storie, and
Charles, added four points to the
Winged "O" 's final score. Leistner
finished third in both hurdle races;
Storie came in behind Spencer and
Morrison to place third in the 440-

the two-mile run. Fred Richman, the
fourth man, ran a lap in the relay.
