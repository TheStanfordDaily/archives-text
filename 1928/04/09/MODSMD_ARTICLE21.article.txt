HOLLYWOOD, April B—(U.P.)—
Mere man made a bid for notice in
Hollywood's Easter fashion parade to
day.
Shell pink and canary-colored suits
appeared in spots along Hollywood
Boulevard, the celuloid rialto, and pas
tel shades also were popular with the
sterner sex.
The canary-colored suits, it was
noted, necessitated oyster-white
shirts and ties. Shell pink drew neck
ties to match. The pastel suits
brought out the same shades in col
lars, shirts, and spats.
Louis Jerome, tec-art fashion ex
pert, observed that the waistline for
the male would be narrower, the
sleeves snugger, the trousers wider,
and the colors flashy.
