# CARDS DEFEAT OLYMPIC CLUB SQUAD 87-44
## Eric Krenz, Clarence West Star for Stanford by Double Victories Gooden's Win in Mile Over Charteris, McKmnon Surprises Crowd 
### Bob Speers 
Stanford's track and field team did
everything expected of it—and more
—Saturday, in handing the Olympic
Club squad a neat 87 to 44 defeat.
Among the outstanding features of
the day were the Cardinals' clean
sweep in the field events, and Captain
Bud Spencer's near-world-record mark
in the 440.
Fears of hidden potentialities
among the clubmen were dispelled
when the visitors were unable to grab
more than three first places. The
forty-three-point margin of Stanford's
win was, in a way, somewhat of a sur
prise. Considerable had been said con
cerning what the Olympic Club might
do and a thirty-point lead was about
the best expected from the Cards.
Krenz, West Star
Eric Krenz and Clarence West
starred for Stanford as double win
ners. Krenz took the shot and discus
events handily, and West surprised by
copping both firsts in the hurdle
events. Ross Nichols suffered tough
luck in the highs when he hit a hur
dle and was forced out of the race
after taking a good lead from the
first.
Ward Edmonds gave the crowd a
desired thrill by trying for a world's
mark in the pole vault after winning
the event handly at 12 feet 9 inches,
the 14-foot-two-inch mark was a trifle
too much for the Card ace, however,
and the bar slipped to the ground on
each attempt.
Gooden Wins Mile
Gooden's win in the mile came as
a big surprise. Either McKinnon or
Charteris was favored to cop the
event, and Gooden slipped through to
win.
Russell Sweet, speedy Montanan,
captured first in the century and the j
220 for the Olympians. He knocked j
off the hundred in 9 4-5 and the longer
race in 21 3-5. Johnny Lauritzen got
thirds in both events for Stanford.
Spencer Sensational
Bud Spencer came through, as
usual, with the most beautiful race
of the day, taking the 440-yard dash
in the fast time of 48 seconds flat for :
the second best clocking of his career.
Morrison, fleet Card sophomore, fin
ished second.
The new Stanford hoop captain,
Rothert, proved his versatility by tak
ing third in the shot after only a short I
training period since basketball sea-1
son.
Charteris' famous finish failed to
pull the northern ace through in the
relay when Spencer's locomotive-like
stride carried him across the tape
first in the final lap.
