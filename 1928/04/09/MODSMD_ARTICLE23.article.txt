# CHAPARRAL SATIRIZES RUSHING; APRIL ISSUE FEATURES ART WORK
## 
### 
A gay mood in celebration of the
twenty-second birthday of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society is evident in
the Track and Rushing Number of
Chaparral which goes on sale next
Wednesday.
The Old Boy wishes to make it
known that "freshmen are advised
not to read this issue, for it contains
material that gives men's rushing a
beating—and satirizes that institution
in a way that will disillusion all fresh
men who do not follow this advice."
An extra large amount of art work
is also contained in this issue as are
several full-page art features includ
ing one entitled "Fraternity Rushing
as it Might Be —and Is," by Bob Phil
ippi. "Fables of the Farm," a feature
carried in the early issues of Chappie
last year, will return with authentic
local comedy.
