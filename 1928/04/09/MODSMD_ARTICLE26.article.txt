Contrary to the custom of past years, Women's Athletic Association
elections will not be held with those of the Associated Women Students
this year. The chief reason given by W.A.A. i'.oard members for the
change is that it is not practicable for women to run for offices of both
organizations at the same time, and they feel that W.A.A. may gain
by waiting until the A.W.S. elections are over. Moreover, it has been a
matter of policy with both organizations that they shall not place the
names of the same people on their ballots at the same time.
In this year's election there are several women outstanding in athletics
who are candidates for A.W.S. offices. Chesterlyn Thomas, is now presi
dent of W.A.A., and is eligible for re-election. Ruth Lausburgli, junior
representative on the Board, and Maxine Gushing, secretary of the
athletic organization, are also eligible for higher office in W.A.A.
There is no law of either organization forbidding them from having
some of the same women in office, but in view of the tradition against
their doing so, W.A.A. prefers to wait. Perhaps the change will be of
benefit to the Athletic Association, but time alone will tell. In view of
the tradition established, however, it is unfortunate both organizations
should look to the same people for leadership.
