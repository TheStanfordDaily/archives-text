The fear of the University Administration that a Masque Ball could
not be run on the campus without its degenerating into a "brawl" was j
pretty thoroughly squelched with Saturday night's demonstration. Not
only was the dance free of any excessive drinking, but everyone had an
enjoyable time, in spite of many predictions among the "old timers" that
it would be a Hop without a lot of liquor.
Bob Fraser and the Rally Committee arc to be congratulated for the
reinstatement of the Masque Ball, and the splendid manner in which it
was handled. There can be no objections to having more of these in the
future, now it is proved that students can have a good time at a costume
ball without its developing into a drunken orgy.
