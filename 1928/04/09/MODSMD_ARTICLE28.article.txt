# Hoover Leads

### 
The two straw votes taken amongst the Who's Who's and the students
at thirty-nine universities offer material for some interesting speculation.
Out of the 5500 residents of New York who are listed in Who's Who,
about one in four replied to a request for preferences on Republican presi
dential candidates. The Hoover choice was five to one. And when classi
fied by sexes the returns show that the women were for lloover in the
same proportion as the men. But the women gave no votes to Nicholas
Murray Butler, Lowden, Borah, or Norris. All of these got some ballots
from the men.
The university test vote was conducted by The Independent and cov
ered both Republicans and Democrats. Of some 28,000 Republican votes
Hoover got 22,000. Dawes drew 3223, Lowden 2194, Curtis 275, and
Willis 443. In South Dakota and lowa the state universities gave Lowden
the lead over Hoover by 158 to 122 in the former and 524 to 407 in lowa.
At the University of Chicago Hoover got more than the combined total of
Lowden and Dawes, both Illinois men.
Among the Democrats Smith showed nearly as much strength as did
Hoover among the Republicans. Of some 18,000 Democrats, 13,500 fa
vored Smith. Reed got 2208, Ritchie 1370, Walsh 1058, and Donahey 488.
Smith topped all other Democratic candidates in each of the thirty-nine
universities canvassed except one, Washington University in St. Louis,
which gave Smith 73 and Reed 240. This was, of course, a favorite son
vote. Yet the University of Missouri gave Smith 25 and Reed 18. What
is the explanation of the Smith strength among college men and women?
If it is because he is supposed to be a wet candidate, why not throw their
strength to Ritchie, who is outspokenly wet?
As a sure indication of which way the wind blows a straw vote may
not be always dependable, but these two cross sections have at least the
claim to be interesting.â€”San Francisco Chraniclc.
