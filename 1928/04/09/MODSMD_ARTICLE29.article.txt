A MISSIONARY MONOPOLY?
When Nancy Ann Miller, Seattle,
U.S.A., married the former Maharajah
of Indore she gave up whatever Chris
| tian beliefs she might have held for
those of the Hindu.
Later, when all the pagan splendor
of the marriage ceremonies was be
ginning to dim in the eyes of the for
eign correspondents, when the couple
were presumably becoming used to
seeing each other across the break
fast table, came the announcement
that Tukojirao Holkar and his Ameri
can bride were planning to bring
; their religion to the attention of peo
ple in this country, such an undertak
ing being perfectly feasible in view
of the great wealth of the Maharajah.
Reversing Things
This bold and unsual idea of a little
foreign missionary work was not to
! go long unchallenged. Strange as it
may seem, the first objection was to
! come from a missionary society, an
: organization engaged extensively in
the same kind of work throughout the
world. To keep the Hindu and his
wife out of the United States "be
cause they do not stand for the prin-
I ciples of Christianity" soon became
the motto of these militant Christians,
: who, with true missionary zeal, are
now sponsoring a national call to
arms against the invaders.
If this half-baked idea of a group of
| Seattle women gains headway in this
country we must conclude that our
American missionaries and churches
j are a poor bunch of sports. For years
and years now our missionaries have
gone out in never-ending streams to
impose themselves and their ideas on
the lands of the East. The Oriental,
remembering perhaps the gunboats
anchored in the rivers, has listened
patiently, rising in rebellion only
i when abuses became too flagrant.
Rarely has he elected to resent the
scorn heaped upon his religion, cen-
J turies old, and more rarely still has
| he sought to preach to the Westerner.
With or Without Courtesy
Should this Hindu choose to break
this silence, he should be received
with all courtesy in this country. Ad
vance indications, however, seem to

say that this is just how he won't be
received. Great numbers of people
with more religion than sense or tol
erance can safely be expected to for
get all about religious liberty and
common courtesy and expend much
energy and talk against the Mahara
jah. Possibly if he should speak in
the South the Klan might forget its
grudge against the Catholics long
enough to break up the meeting.
The president of the Seattle mis
sionary society certainly made a tar
get out of herself when she told the
press that her society, working hard
to further the interests of Christianity
throughout the world, "most seriously
objected to the encroachment on its
work by a foreign religion." Except
for some rather startling figures to
be found in yearbooks, we might be
led to believe that Christianity is the
only religion worthy of the name in
(he world. While it is all right for
this lady to be ridiculous as she may
choose, we nevertheless hope this
j statement doesn't get out into the
world as an expression of American
public opinion on religion and reli
gious tolerance.
After all, and finally, we can't see
how our Fundamentalists can fear for
the possible success of this embassy
of mystic India. Converting people is
slow work, revival meetings and Ai
mee notwithstanding. More than 130
separate American missionary soci
eties have been listed in the Chinese
field, some of which have been active
for nearly seventy-five years. Less
than one per cent of China has been
converted, and at this rate it lias been
estimated that 2500 years and more
than fifty billion dollars will be need
ed to convert to Christianity even a
fourth of the population of China. At
this speed even the vast fortune of
the former Maharajah' could hardly
dent our national hide.
Why not, then, worthy women of
the Women's Home Missionary Soci
ety of the Trinity Methodist Episco
pal Church of Seattle, be good sports
and let our friend from India have his
say? And competition, you know, can
be very stimulating—even in religion.
