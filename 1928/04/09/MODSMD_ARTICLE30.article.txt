"Crusade," Donn Bryne. Little Brown
& Co.
The Crusades are a dark woof for
Byrne's romantic lyric weave, but
when his threads are women and the
pattern complete, this tapistry is very
much the same as his former fabrica
tions. On the whole, "Crusade" is not
his finest work, but easily among his
second best. "Messer Marco Polo"
caught the tinkle of little gold bells,
"The Wind Bloweth," the winds,
zephyrs, and hurricanes, "Brother
Saul," organs and lutes, and "Crusade"
is a medley of soft zithers, guitars,
and trumpets and bugles.
In the character of Sir Miles O'Neil,
cousin to the King of Uulter, he has
an admirable vehicle for the Irish de
lineation he has made peculiarly his
own. It is rather a neat problem to
transpose such a character to the
Holy Lands, and retain the person
ality of both. The romance contains
all the peculiarly Byrnish qualities
that one may expect it to, and, in
addition, the author has done very
well by the crusades themselves.
These wars of religion are at the
stage when they have become political
rather than emotional, and the reli
gion has been twisted into a tortuous
adoration of the tomb of a dead deity,
rather than the idealistic worship of
the resting place of a ressurected
Christ.
It is the most astonishing thing how
near Byrne approaches Sir Walter
Scott sometimes, and yet, thank
heaven, how far he manages to avoid
this catastrophe! "Crusade" makes a
nice four-hour reading. Someone point
ed out to us that the first sentence
is ninety-six words long, but except
for such proclivities of Byrnes, there
are no obvious blemishes in it.
As for theatres, there are variety
of things to choose from. This so
called English melodramer-r, "Inter
ference" will bring back the Geary to
sweetness and light, beginning Mon
day. (By the way, we notice that
Jeanne Eagels was called before the
Actors Equity Association to explain
her temperamental distaste for com
ing to San Francisco in "Her Card
board Lover," previously scheduled
for last. week. Wish they would pub
lish the bonfide minutes of that meet
ing! )
The Henry Duffy Players continue
the same, with "Take My Advice" and
"The Shannons of Broadway." The

Columbia is recuperating from its
costume adventures with Whiteside
in an airy fashion. The much-heralded
"Wings," another of these super
i movies, will play—beginning yester
! day.
"The Married Virgin" is coming
i back to the Green St. Theatre, with
! a new second act —when, no one
j seems to know, but they promise it
i soon; and there are many diverse ru
! mors about that "The Captive" will
be in our midst. (Gossip places it
at every theatre from the self-respect
ing legitimates, to the Chinese
Opera-r Houses!)
