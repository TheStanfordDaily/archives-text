FORGOTTEN
With the rapt interest of all local
sportdqm fixed upon Coach "Dink"
Templeton's track warriors, another
group of athletes is working on the
campus unnoticed —just now.
Next fall, however, this same
band, sweating in obscurity, will be
cheered by thousands. Such is a
situation that would be ripe mate
rial for philosophizing.
Warner and his gridmen don't
: need philosophy, though, and prob
ably wouldn't appreciate it. They are
getting right now what they need
most —practice and lots of it.
And men who love any sport
enough to don hot, smelly suits, and
perspire daily through apparently
endless and meaningless practices'
deserve little less than the Con
gressional Medal of Honor.
Especially so when the waters of
Lagunita are lapping gently against
green shores; when the sky is very
blue; when the distant hills are gray
in the soft, warm haze of spring.
It isn't easy nor is it pleasant to
block and tackle and run signals on
I a soft, cool turf beneath a warm sun.
In the fall it's different. The
breeze is sharper, football's in the
air, the noisy crowds are there.
Those men who labor every day,
: forgotten in the lure of a slim ca
noe cutting blue water and because
Cardinal tracksters are breaking
records, will once again be idols.
Once again the mob will howl for
blood, and once again Stanford
hearts will swell as the Redshirts
trot onto the field.
So much for human nature.
