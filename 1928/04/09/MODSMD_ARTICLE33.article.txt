NEW YORK, April S—(U.P.)—j
; American girls would be infinitely more
! happy if they were less like Helen of
Troy, in the opinion of Mine. Elisabeth
Rethberg, Metropolitan Opera star, who
;is at present engrossed in preparation in- ;
j cidental to introducing the famous Greek |
lady to the operatic stage.
Mme. Rethberg has been approved by
Richard Strauss, Viennese composer, for
the prima donna and title role in his lat
est opus, "The Egyptian Helen," based on
the life of Paris' sweetheart. The Metro-!
politan star will sing "Helen" at the
world premiere of the Strauss work in
Dresden, Germany, in June, after which
she will introduce "Mrs. Menelaus" to
audiences on this side of the water.
Mme. Rethberg holds the opinion that!
I American girls lead the world in charm,
beauty, fashion, brains, and achievement
—but that they are far behind their cous-i
ins of other countries when it comes to!
true happiness and contentment. Like
Helen of Troy, says the opera star, the
i American girl is never quite satisfied,
j She continues, undaunted, in her quest for
thrills, excitement, and something new,!
! overlooking genuine happiness en route.
