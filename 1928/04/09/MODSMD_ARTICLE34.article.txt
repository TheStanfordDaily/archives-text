# ARM-CHAIR GRID FANS MAY BE DEPRIVED OF FOOTBALL BROADCAST
## Al Masters Declares That Radio Adds to Interest In Pigskin Game 
### Kenneth Mansfield 
Arm-chair football fans will be a
thing of the past, at least in the |
northwestern section of the Pacific j
Coast Conference, if the recommenda
tion of the graduate managers of the
northern division of the conference is
acted on favorably at the general
meeting of the managers in June. The j
first step toward the discontinuance j
of football broadcasting was taken in
the meeting of the graduate mana- j
gers of the northern division held in
Portland on March 23.
Small Schools Complain
Many complaints have been re
ceived from the smaller schools stat-j
ing that broadcasting the big games <
attracts large numbers from their
contests. It is the belief of the north
ern managers that these small schools j
have a legitimate reason for their ob- j
jections and have acted accordingly, i
Although the big games always sell j
out, broadcasting hurts the attend- j
ance at the less important conference ,
games is their contention.
Masters Approves
A1 Masters, graduate manager at i
Stanford, expressed himself as fol
lows: "My personal reaction to the
whole situation is that broadcasting
builds up interest in football rather
than detracting from it." He further
stated that Stanford now a con- j
tract with KPO for the broadcasting
of games here. The contract runs for
a year.
"I don't believe that broadcasting
helps football interests, the size of
the audience and such, but as a mat
ter of fact, these are things lliat will
have to be further determined," was
the comment of Jack Benefiel, gradu
ate manager at Oregon.
At Franklin Field, Pennsylvania, no
broadcasts are permitted until the
stadium is sold out. This fact was
brought up in the Portland meeting,
but it was thought that this solution
did not help the small schools.
All things • considered, something '
will probably Le done about the situa- [
tion at the June meeting of the gradu
ate managers of the coast conference.
It is possible that radio listeners-in
will be deprived of their favorite au
tumn indoor sport, at least in the

games is their contention.
Masters Approves
A1 Masters, graduate manager at i
Stanford, expressed himself as fol
lows: "My personal reaction to the
whole situation is that broadcasting
builds up interest in football rather
than detracting from it." He further
stated that Stanford now a con- j
tract with KPO for the broadcasting
of games here. The contract runs for
a year.
"I don't believe that broadcasting
helps football interests, the size of
the audience and such, but as a mat
ter of fact, these are things lliat will
have to be further determined," was
the comment of Jack Benefiel, gradu
ate manager at Oregon.
At Franklin Field, Pennsylvania, no
broadcasts are permitted until the
stadium is sold out. This fact was
brought up in the Portland meeting,
but it was thought that this solution
did not help the small schools.
All things • considered, something '
will probably Le done about the situa- [
tion at the June meeting of the gradu
ate managers of the coast conference.
It is possible that radio listeners-in
will be deprived of their favorite au
tumn indoor sport, at least in the
northern section of the conference.
