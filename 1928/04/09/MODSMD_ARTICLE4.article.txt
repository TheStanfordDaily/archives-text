a little too good for the University
of Illinois, having a better passing
game and taking advantage of their
opportunities.
Coach Ernst Brandsten's team, con
sisting of Harrison, Burns, Vanden
Akker, Maltby, Driggs, Strong (cap
tain), and Thornton also won the na
tional intercollegiate polo title from

extra-period game played at Chicago

markable showing in view of the fact
that the team spent most of its time
