# ADAMS REIGNS FOR NIGHT AT MASQUE BALL
## Crowning Impressive; Rally Committee Praised for Colorful Affair 
### 
"If 1 were King, Ah Love; if I were
King,
What treasures to your throne I'd
bring.
I'd stoop beneath your sceptre, and
I'd swear
Allegiance to your eyes, and lips,
and hair."
Davy Adams rose to Kingship, and
fell into the comparative obscurity
of a Stanford student all in one day,
last April 7, even as his famous coun
terpart, Francois Villon, the writer of
the beautiful verses that begin this
final message to the Stanford popu
lace concerning ye grand Masque
Ball whereunto went all fun-loving
members of this community last Sat
urday night.
Ball Is Success
Once in a while one of these kingly
dreams come true, even as Villon's
and Adams' came true. Perhaps one
will come true from this year on into
the future years of Stanford's history,
where for one night the entire col
lege, under the capable guidance of
the Rally Committee, will don the cap
and bells even as the Clown Prince
in the coronation ceremony, and spend
a few merry hours in an unusually
happy and historical atmosphere.
It is a challenge to the imagination
to see such numbers of characters
melted together in one conglomerate
mass. George and Martha Washing
tons abounded, while Russia pos
sessed a goodly representation. From
a Visogoth to a Chinese emperor all
periods and worlds of fancy and fact
were represented. Even a monkey and
an absent-minded college student who
forgot half his wearing apparel were
included.
Coronation Impressive
The coronation ceremony was a
masterpiece of pantomime. From the
two upright heralds announcing the
arrival of the sovereigns, through the
jester's affectionately patting the fur
of the Queen's robe, the coronation
was handled smoothly and interest
ingly. Hock Chalmers performed his
role with the suavity of a Richelieu.
All in all, the Ball was a grand and
glorious success. Credit must be
given where credit is due, and it goes
to Bob Fraser and the Rally Commit
tee which worked hard and long on
plans and decorations. And if the
comments of a number of sons and
daughters of the Stanford Red can
be believed, it was the best dance
given in these parts for many quar
ters.

Ball whereunto went all fun-loving
members of this community last Sat
urday night.
Ball Is Success
Once in a while one of these kingly
dreams come true, even as Villon's
and Adams' came true. Perhaps one
will come true from this year on into
the future years of Stanford's history,
where for one night the entire col
lege, under the capable guidance of
the Rally Committee, will don the cap
and bells even as the Clown Prince
in the coronation ceremony, and spend
a few merry hours in an unusually
happy and historical atmosphere.
It is a challenge to the imagination
to see such numbers of characters
melted together in one conglomerate
mass. George and Martha Washing
tons abounded, while Russia pos
sessed a goodly representation. From
a Visogoth to a Chinese emperor all
periods and worlds of fancy and fact
were represented. Even a monkey and
an absent-minded college student who
forgot half his wearing apparel were
included.
Coronation Impressive
The coronation ceremony was a
masterpiece of pantomime. From the
two upright heralds announcing the
arrival of the sovereigns, through the
jester's affectionately patting the fur
of the Queen's robe, the coronation
was handled smoothly and interest
ingly. Hock Chalmers performed his
role with the suavity of a Richelieu.
All in all, the Ball was a grand and
glorious success. Credit must be
given where credit is due, and it goes
to Bob Fraser and the Rally Commit
tee which worked hard and long on
plans and decorations. And if the
comments of a number of sons and
daughters of the Stanford Red can
be believed, it was the best dance
given in these parts for many quar
ters.
"If 1 were King, Ah Love; if I were
King,
What treasures to your throne I'd
bring.
I'd stoop beneath your sceptre, and
I'd swear
Allegiance to your eyes, and lips,
and hair."
Davy Adams rose to Kingship, and
fell into the comparative obscurity
of a Stanford student all in one day,
last April 7, even as his famous coun
terpart, Francois Villon, the writer of
the beautiful verses that begin this
final message to the Stanford popu
lace concerning ye grand Masque
