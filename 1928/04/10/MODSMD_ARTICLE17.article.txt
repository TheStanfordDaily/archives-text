# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMAN, ANIMAL LIFE NOTED BY MONTAGUE
## 
### 
"There is an absolute difference be-j
tween human personal life and brute life,;
and despite that difference we can inter-1
pret the evolution of the one from the!
other in a perfectly materialistic way," J
said W. P. Montague, Professor of Phi
losophy at Columbia, who spoke on the j
"Materialistic Conception of Personality" !
yesterday.

"Human thought is lvricul rather than
pragmatic or materialistic," believes Pro
fessor Montague. Refuting the mechanis
tic and the vitalistic conceptions of mind,
and the view taken by the emergent evo
lutionists, Montague advanced the hypoth
esis that when kinetic energy flows into
the brain at the synapses where it is re
versed or redirected, some of it is stored
as potential energy in the protoplasm,
and some of this energy remains there,
making memory. Sensations occur when
potential energy is stored up, is the be
lief of Montague.

"No new factors make the difference
between man and brute, but a shift in the
emphasis of the factors present makes
the new state," concluded Professor Mon
tague.
