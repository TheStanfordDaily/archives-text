# SYPHER NAMED HEAD OF 1928 BASEBALL NINE
## Captain Called Stanford's Best Catcher; Scrappy Playing Notable TEAM APPROVES CHOICE Election of Leader Should Pull Players Out of Batting Slump 
### Frank Whiteley 
Cook Sypher, who has been on the
receiving end of the Stanford battery
tor more than two years, was eleoted
| captain of the varsity baseball team
yesterday following practice. Sypher
has distinguished himself by his
scrappy play during the past two sea
sons and the present one, and is prob
ably the best catcher that Stanford
i has ever had. His aggressiveness has
had much to do with the Cards' suc
; cesses this year.
Plays Consistent Game
Sypher is a line college catcher if
there ever was one. His play behind
the plate is always the same, and that
means consistently good. When it
comes to handling the bat, he looks
better still. In the U.S.C. game he
drove out three hits, one of them a
homer, in his trips to the plate.
"Dink" Templeton said of him in
the March issue of The Illustrated
Review: "The team is strengthened
by Cook Sypher, the best catcher
Stanford has ever had â€”and I used to
look upon Bubbah Dent as a god."
Under Sypher's leadership, the
team should pull out of its batting
| slump and crash through to a victory
in the second game with California
next Saturday at West Field, Berke
ley.
Cards Poor Saturday
Last Saturday the Cardinal horse
hide tossers played the poorest ball
they have played all year. It wasn't
so much what they did, as what they
didn't do. Their fielding was good
enough, except that it was a bit
slower than usual, but their hitting
was poor. After three men had been
walked, the Cards would come up to
the platter, swing at the first balls,
and go out, one-two-three.
Sypher is popular with his team
mates, and as captain he should be
able to keep them on their toes dur
ing the few remaining games.
The Australian trip for the varsity
has not been definitely decided upon
as yet. The San Francisco Bulletin
| said yesterday that it had been de
cided upon, but this story was not
authentic.
