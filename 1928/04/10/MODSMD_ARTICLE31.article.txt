# At Last!

Yesterday afternoon. Coach Harry Wolter called a special meeting of
the baseball squad to see if they wanted to elect a captain. They did. Cook
Sypher, a veteran behind the bat for three years, was elected.
It is believed this was a wise step, and that the benefits of removing
the uncertainty will be seen in the remaining few games. Jt was, perhaps,
just a misunderstanding all around that kept a captain from being elected
before.
Now all that remains is for the team to see that someone is chosen
immediately the last game is over to lead the 1929 outfit. If this is all
worked out before the season commences, the difficulties will be overcome
and misunderstandings obviated.
