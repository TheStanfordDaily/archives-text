It seems that the northern members of the Pacific Coast Conference
are not in favor of having football games broadcast. They feel that this
cuts down the gate receipts of the game, and the smaller colleges think
their games do not draw the crowds they should, for people would rather
listen to a big game over the radio.

There is something to the argument of the smaller schools, for the
chances are they do lose patronage, but A1 Masters has the correct view
in respect to the larger colleges when he says, "My personal reaction to
the whole situation is that broadcasting builds up interest in football
rather than detracting from it." It must be remembered that there are a
great many people who cannot go to the games, but who are, neverthe
less, ardent fans, and greatly desirous of getting a contest as near first
hand as possible.

There is also a large class of people who do not know much about
football, and who don't get as much out of watching a game as they do
out of listening to the broadcaster's interpretation of the plays. If the
graduate managers desire to crcate enthusiasm over the game, certainly
it is a step to have such people become interested.
What the managers should attack is this business of broadcasting every
thing but the game. A few of the listeners are entertained by the side
lights, such as: "Oh, here comes Bill Jones, the great blah blah, and
coming in through the south entrance, 1 see Oaf Oafum, the whatnot."
But the great majority of people listening to a football game want to hear
the game, not how beautiful the sunset is.

Radio broadcasting is rapidly becoming more and more vital in dis
seminating news —all kinds of news—and this is going to continue. It is
nearly as reasonable to say that newspapers can't carry the story of the
game, as to refuse to allow it to be broadcast.
