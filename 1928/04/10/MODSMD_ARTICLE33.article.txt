# White Collars
## 
### 
General Edward Orton, in speaking to the winter graduating class of
Ohio State University, made a statement to the effect that the colleges
are turning out too many people into the "white-collar" class, that there
is danger of over-saturation in these lines of work, and that some have
already been noted, particularly law and medicine.
The poor white collar folk come in for a lot of talk every now and
then, and the palaver is usually adverse. Too many people overlook the
fact that there is an increasing demand for inside workers. As modern
science and invention have decreased the number of people required in
the fields and factories for manual labor, just to that extent have sprung
tip needs for those hands to work out figures and tabulations, write re
ports, and a million and one other such duties. If we're going to con
tinually argue that the voting population should be educated, that the
people of the country (any country) are way below par, etc., etc., it seems
rather foolish to say that there are too many college graduates.
True, there are numerous universities that turn out, in mass produc
tion, a great many youths who can lay claim only to four years of "getting
by." But General Orton's remedy, that of reducing the number of gradu
ates, will not fill the bill. If the present institutions reduce their enroll
ments, which seems unlikely, there will lie a new crop of universities, for
someone will always want to provide places for those who can't find help
themselves.
Anyway, this argument that such-and-such profession or business is
over-saturated is all wrong. The only way to state such a proposition is
to say that there are not enough good men in the field, and too many
poor ones. This is true, but it is also true of practically every profession
or occupation of any kind. So where does the debate end? Efficient, ca
pable men are always in demand, and a certain number of culls must be
expected in each lot. The only way to find which trees will grow sound
apples and which will grow bad ones is to give them the same soil and
nourishment, then gather the cropâ€”the inspectors will do the rest.
There will be a meeting of the staff of Tiie Stanford Daily at
12:45 o'clock today in the usual place. All members are requested to
lie present.
