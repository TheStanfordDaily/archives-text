Heroics come high in Chicago. Wit
ness the sad case of Arthur Thomas,
druggist, now out of a job because he got
his drug store bandit. To hire him, say
the embattled vendors of a thousand and
one preparations, might attract a gangster
reprisal.
A lot of little boys in Chicago certainly
never went to Sunday school.
* * *
Mr. O. O. Mclntyre, do you know
that it costs the New Yorker-about
the-town from $50 to $500 yearly to
maintain a hat ? Such are the rav
ages of the tight-shirted hat-check
girls.
Hat-check tips are not so bad,
being often rewarded with a smile,
but the dead hand of custom becomes
heaviest when, at 1 a.m., you must
tip a waiter who last filled and iced
your water glass at 9 :30 p.m.

Twenty Y.M.C.A. boys, eager to un
ravel the mysteries of the East, are to
sail for the Orient on June 6. Does a
picture of the group grace the news
story? Not so. Instead, a most comely
young girl is photographed with the cap

tain of one of the Dollar boats. What
has she got to do with the story? Noth
ing in particular. I

Kathryn Ray, of the Follies, pulls
a little faster one than usual and
touches top-column. It seems that
she has been married for four years
now, and all-wise Broadway has been
none the wiser.
She is reported "shopping around
for a divorce."
* * *
At 18 Mary Miller decided to become
George Miller, and for sixty years now
she has been taken as a man. She has j
been a farm hand, night watchman, and
even a trapeze performer in a circus. All j
of which, if true, is certainly remarkable
—even for lowa.

The presidential poll conducted by Thej
Independent draws to a close, with a
landslide carrying Hoover to victory in
all colleges save five. "The practical po- j
litical significance of this," says The In-\
dependent, "may be nothing, may be j
slight, or may, if academic opinion is con-;
ceded to count heavily, be considerable."
The second guess is probably the nearest j
correct.

Kathryn Ray, of the Follies, pulls
a little faster one than usual and
touches top-column. It seems that

being often rewarded with a smile,
but the dead hand of custom becomes
heaviest when, at 1 a.m., you must
tip a waiter who last filled and iced
your water glass at 9 :30 p.m.

Twenty Y.M.C.A. boys, eager to un
