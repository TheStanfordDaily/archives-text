"Wings"—Columbia.
Anyone interested in aviation—and that
lincludes all of us, doesn't it?—will get a
huge thrill from this splendid picture,
j "Wings" paints an unforgettable picture
of the World War as seen from the skies,
j with airplane duels, crashes, and stunts.
It is a triumph in photography, the scenes
up in the air being taken with an eye to
the utmost in sensationalism, excitement,
and beauty.
When the actual fighting scenes start
the screen is suddenly enlarged to nearly
twice its regular size, startling the audi
ence and hurling it right up in the clouds
4 alongside the flyers. The drone of the
airplanes and the noise of their impacts
with each other and with the houses and
earth when they fall is most effectively
sounded by a device timed to the picture,
similar to the Vitaphone and greatly em
phasizing the reality of the battles.
Bccause of the magnitude and authen
ticity with which the airplane scenes have
been filmed, the picture compares favor
ably with "The Big Parade" and "What
Price Glory," the most outstanding of
the World War Pictures. There is a
great deal of fighting in "Wings," not
only above the clouds but down on the
actual front. With such a magnificent
background the conventional love story is
bound to get the worst of the deal. The
plot of the picture is very slim and lacks
the emotional appeal of the two great war
pictures just mentioned above. The cast
is a thoroughly capable and appealing
j one, however.
It is of particular interest to college

people to know that the two leading male
roles arc taken by men not long out of
school. "Buddy" Rogers, who does the
best acting (outside of that done by the
airplanes) in "Wings," is a 23-year-old
ex-student of the University of Kansas. |
Richard Arlen, the other hero, is a gradu
ate of the University of Pennsylvania. !
The story was written by John Monk
Saunders, a Rhodes scholar from the Uni
versity of Washington, the screen play
was adapted by Louis Lighton, of the j
University of Arkansas, and the picture :
itself produced by B. P. Schulberg, a
graduate of the College of the City of
New York. "Wings"—with all its daring
stunts —was dominated in its making by |
collegians, and so we can feel indirectly j
proud of its success.
Oh —the sex appeal is most ably sup- j
plied by Clara Bow who, as the heroine, j
displays the customary amount of "It" j
and considerable acting ability as well.

And we went down to hear the Stan
ford Glee Club perform as part of the '
program for Easter Sunday at the San
Jose California Theatre. Their program
was interesting, including such things as I
"150 th Psalm," "Invictus," "Viking j
Song," and so on. We heard two little !
boys in back of us asking what they were j
singing when they reached the medley |
of Stanford songs part of the program.)
Their mother sharply reprimanded them,
and said it was military music. Which is
as good a way of saying it as any.
