» Two hotly contested games and
two defaults were the results of the
first day's contests in the Intramural
baseball tournament yesterday. De
spite many errors and loose play all
teams showed great possibilities of
developing into first-class material.
Beta Theta Pi defeated Encina I in
a closely contested game with many
errors. A rally by the Encina nine in
the last of the seventh inning when
they were nine runs behind was the
feature of the game. Murphy and
Stewart, Beta battery, well handled
the situation for the first three in
nings, not giving a single hit or al
lowing a man to reach first.
Encina Rallies in Ninth
Murphy blew up in the fourth, al
lowing numerous hits and two runs.
Andrews replaced him in the fourth.
Thomas, Encina pitcher, pitched a
fine game, but no support on the part
of the team allowed seven runs in the
third. A six-run rally in the last of
the ninth with numerous doubles and
triples gave the Hall men an interest
' in the game but they were unable to
overcome the Betas' twelve runs.
Each team made ten hits and numer
ous errors. Harlow Ilothert scored
two runs on passed balls after strik
ing out both times.
El Tigre Takes Lead
Starting with two runs in the first
inning and one in the fourth the El
Tigre baseball team took a lead that
! the Fiji men could not reach tlirough-
J out the game. Bunching hits in the
| fifth the Phi Gamma Delta's scored
two runs but were unable to bring in
| the tying one. Faultless fielding on
j the part of the El Tigre men kept the
1 fraternity team under hand at all
; times. Hunter of El Tigre allowed!
; only four hits while his teammates 1
were collecting seven from McCor-1
| mack, Fiji liurler. After getting two i
men on base in the sixth inning the '
j fraternity nine were lacking the j
I punch to score the tying run.
Encina I and Phi Kappa Psi won on
defaults. In a practice game between
the two teams, Phi Kappa Psi won
j 4 to 1 in five innings.

» Two hotly contested games and
two defaults were the results of the
first day's contests in the Intramural
baseball tournament yesterday. De
spite many errors and loose play all
teams showed great possibilities of
developing into first-class material.
Beta Theta Pi defeated Encina I in
a closely contested game with many
errors. A rally by the Encina nine in
the last of the seventh inning when
they were nine runs behind was the
feature of the game. Murphy and
Stewart, Beta battery, well handled
the situation for the first three in
nings, not giving a single hit or al
lowing a man to reach first.
Encina Rallies in Ninth
Murphy blew up in the fourth, al
lowing numerous hits and two runs.
Andrews replaced him in the fourth.
Thomas, Encina pitcher, pitched a
fine game, but no support on the part
of the team allowed seven runs in the
third. A six-run rally in the last of
the ninth with numerous doubles and
triples gave the Hall men an interest
' in the game but they were unable to
overcome the Betas' twelve runs.
Each team made ten hits and numer
ous errors. Harlow Ilothert scored
two runs on passed balls after strik
ing out both times.
El Tigre Takes Lead
Starting with two runs in the first
inning and one in the fourth the El
Tigre baseball team took a lead that
! the Fiji men could not reach tlirough-
J out the game. Bunching hits in the
| fifth the Phi Gamma Delta's scored
two runs but were unable to bring in
| the tying one. Faultless fielding on
j the part of the El Tigre men kept the
1 fraternity team under hand at all
; times. Hunter of El Tigre allowed!
; only four hits while his teammates 1
were collecting seven from McCor-1

men on base in the sixth inning the '
j fraternity nine were lacking the j
