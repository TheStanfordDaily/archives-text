# Literary Tastes Altered By University Education

### 
"College changes literary tastes," says
Pat Morrissette, instructor in English at
the University of Oregon. The freshmen,
with almost mathematical precision, pick
the trite and usual poems as the leaders.
The second-year student, with more liter
ary assurance and slightly abler judg
ment, puts the mediocre in second place,
juniors are accurate hut are humble re
garding their ability. They have a tend
ency to rate everything alike, But the
senior's judgment is accurate and strong.
