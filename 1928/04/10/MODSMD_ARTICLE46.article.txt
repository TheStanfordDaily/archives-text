# PHI BETA KAPPA KEY VALUE INVESTIGATED BY EASTERN COLLEGE
## 
### Hammel McKay 
Now comes that time of the year
when those of us that have studied
hard can look back over four long
years and wonder —if a certain small
key is to he ours. Recently an eastern
college determined to settle the dis
cussion "as to whether or not it pays
to study hard enough to make an
honor organization." So an investiga
tion of the ancient and honorable
order of Phi Beta Kappa was the
result.
In 177G a social and literary society,
confined to collegians who had "ar
rived at the age of sixteen," was es
tablished at William and Mary Col
lege. Later, the last qualification was
dropped and in 1781, of the forty
nine or fifty members of this period,
nearly all were in the Continental
army. The best-known names of this
period are Chief Justice Marshall,
Madison, Mason, and Lee.
Abandon Secrecy Oath
Through the influence of John
Quincy Adams, the chapters of the
society then existing abandoned the
oath of secrecy which it adhered to
formerly, and has since been a non
secret society. Soon after this the
society changed from a senior literary
society to an organization of gradu
ates. When Greek letter fraternities
came into existence, Phi Beta Kappa
began to confine its elections to honor
students and has remained an honor
ary society to the present time.
Some of the most famous names of
American History are on the roll of
Phi Beta Kappa. Emerson, Holmes,
Bryant, Longfellow, Bret Harte, Story,
Kent, Webster, Beeclier, and Wendell
Phillips are among the most famous
of the orators and poets of Phi Beta
Kappa.
U.S. Presidents Belong
Of the presidents of the United
States eleven were members of the
honor society. Some of these names
are Adams, Pierce, Garfield, Arthur.
Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson. Thirteen
out of twenty-nine members of the
Hall of Fame have been Phi Beta
Kappas. This is approximately one
half of the total number elected to
that honor.
