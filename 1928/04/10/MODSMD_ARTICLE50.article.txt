BERKELEY, April 9.—(P.l.P.)—Let- j
tors discussing pledging problems were
recently sent out by the Interf raternity j
Council to the students of 350 high
schools throughout the state. The conn-1
cil in this communication went on record
as not disapproving high school pledging.
The communication urged that high
school men realize the seriousness of
pledging themselves to join fraternities.!
A knowledge both of the history of the!
house and of its standing on the campus j
from the standpoint of students and ad
ministration is regarded as essential.
