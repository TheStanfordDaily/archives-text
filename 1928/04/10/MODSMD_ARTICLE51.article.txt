SEATTLE, April 9.—(P.l.P.) —Little
did a poor worm think that he would
I cause a furor in scientific circles when,
about 600,000,000 years ago, he went for
a walk across a mud bed. But such is the
case. His name was "cliniciclichnites wil
| soni"—and he probably didn't know that
' either."
| But his track which he left behind him
bears a close resemblance to a Goodrich
! Silvertown cord and for a few days the
I University of Washington campus, where
a cast from the track was made, believed
they had made a discovery of great im
portance, at least to the automobile ad-
I vertisers.
