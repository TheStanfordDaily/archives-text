# Hertz Orchestra To Play Modern Popular Program
## Last of Season's Concerts To Be Given in Pavilion Tomorrow Night 
### Margaret Cummings 
An essentially modern and popular pro
gram of music will be given tomorrow
. | evening when the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra under the direction of
,! Alfred Hertz will give the final concert
of the season in the Pavilion at 8 o'clock.
"Scheherazade," the opening number, is
classed as Rimsky Korsakoff's greatest
orchestral work. In the field of orchestra
Rimsky Korsakoff's work shows instru
mental brilliance raised to a pitch which
has been rarely surpassed. He composed
the first Russian symphony.
To Play Five Numbers
Saint Saens, Massenet, Kreisler, and
Brahms are the other composers from
whose works the program of five numbers
has been selected. The first named is of
the modern French school, and is con
sidered the Frenchman most fitted to
compete with the classic masters of sym
phony. His incomparable talent for or
chestration enables him to give relief to
ideas which might otherwise be crude and
mediocre in themselves.
His faculty in writing a certain sort
;of rich, sensuous melody is largely the
! reason for the success of Massenet. He
is a skilled and graceful musician, and is
also a French composer who ranks high
among his contemporaries.
Kreisler's Work Popular
Fritz Kreisler has won fame and pop
ularity not only as a virtuoso of the first
rank, but for the lyrical beauty of his
| compositions. Brahms is classed as one
j of the romantic composers, since all his
| work is so distinctly a reflection of his
| own personality. His music is essentially
j serious.
Tickets for the Symphony concert are
still available, and may be obtained at the
! Old Union. They range in price be
tween $1 and $2.50.
