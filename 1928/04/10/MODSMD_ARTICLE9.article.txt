# FORDNEY-McCUMBER TARIFF PROVISION IS HELD CONSTITUTIONAL
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 9.—(U.P.)—
i In a decision of fundamental import
ance, the United States Supreme
Court has upheld the flexible tariff
provision of the Fordney-McCumber
Act and given its approval to the
policy of Congress in enacting pro
tective tariff legislation for the pur
pose of fostering domestic industry.

The flexible tariff provision allows
the President upon the recommenda
tion of the U.S. Tariff Commission,
to raise or lower tariff duties by fifty
per cent in order to equalize the cost
of production at home with that of
foreign countries.

The law was assailed on the ground
that Congress has unconstitutionally
delegated its taxing power. Chief Jus
tice Taft, who read the decision, held
that the law made the President
merely the agent of Congress in the
operation of the tariff law.

He said that while each of the three
branches of the government is sepa
rate under the Constitution, "that is
not to say that any branch may not
call on another for assistance."

The constitutionality of the protec
tive tariff principal also was assailed
in the case, it being contended that
Congress had no authority to use its
taxing power as an instrument of
policy in encouraging special indus
tries and could use taxation only for
purposes of revenue.
Justice Taft disagreed and uphold
the right of Congress to enforce the
protective tariff principle.
The case came up from the United
States Court of Customs Appeals
which overruled the protest of an im
porter of barinm dioxide upon which
President Coolidge had raised the
duty under the flexible tariff law.
