" There was a sound of
revelry by night." â€”LORD BYRON
Once upon a time an undergraduate came back from
his spring vacation, bought a case of "Canada Dry" and
to his friends said, "Come around to my rooms, this
evening. . .
"There was a sound of revelry by night," as Lord
Byron put it. And if you don't believe me, look it up
in some canto or other of Childe Harold.
This is not a story of flaming youth. Or anything
devilish.
But just this: "Canada Dry" is the smoothest', mel
lowest, most palatable ginger ale you've ever tasted. It
quenches your thirst. It has a distinctive flavor. It
mixes well with other beverages. It contains no capsi
cum (red pepper). And it is really good for you.
