# HERTZ PLAYS LAST A.S.S.U CONCERT FOR 1928 TONIGHT
## Five Selections on Popular Program Represent as Many Nationalities MUSIC WILL BE LYRICAL "Scherazade" Is First of Orchestral Numbers by City Symphony 
### Margaret Cummings 
Russian, Viennese, Spanish, Hun
garian, and French music will be rep
resented on the popular and lyrical
program to be given by the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra in the last
A.S.S.U. concert of the year in the
Pavilion tonight at 8:15 o'clock.

Rimsky Korsakoff's colorful "Scher
azade" is the opening selection, and
is one of the finest examples of mu
sical story-telling that is known. The
four movements of the composition
have reference to selected stories
from the "Arabian Nights," and are
assigned to "Sinbad the Sailor," "the
Prince Kalendar," "the Young Prince
and the young Princess," and "the
Festival at Bagdad, with the sinking
of the ship."
Piastro Plays Solo
Mishel Piastro will take the violin
solo part in Saint Saens' "Rondo
Capriccioso," the second number.
Saint Saens is a consummate master
of composition, no one possessing a
more profound knowledge than he of
the secrets and resources of the art.
This is perhaps the most serious se
lection on the program.
"Caprice Viennoise" by Fritz Kreis
ler is one of the most general favo
rites. The story is told of Kreisler's
asking a pawnbroker to evaluate his
violin one time while watiing to board
his boat, when the pawnbroker, who
happened to be a music lover, had
him arrested on suspicion of stealing
Kreisler's violin, which he recognized.
Kreisler only convinced the pawn
broker of his true identity by playing
for him the "Caprice."
Will Render "Le Cid"
Massenet's "Le Cid Suite" from the
opera built around the adventures of
the Spanish national hero, and two
Hungarian dances by Brahms are the
last numbers. The program follows
in full:
Scherazade Rimsky Korsakoff
Rondo Capriccioso Saint Saens
Mishel Piastro, soloist
Two Hungarian Dances Brahms
Caprice Viennoise Fritz Kreisler
Le Cid Suite Massenet
