CHICAGO, April 10.—(U.P.)—Brav
ing the expected shootings, Bluggings,
kidnapings, and intimidations that
marked the Illinois primary in Chi
cago today, voters swamped the polls
and cast what was predicted by all
political leaders to have been the
heaviest primary vote in history.
Police and special guards in auto
mobiles were kept busy throughout
the day answering appeals from pre-j
cinct judges who reported several in
stances of violence, intimidations, and ,
frauds at the polls.
A bright warm sun brought out the ;
voters early and a steady line of men
and women made their way to the;
polls in defiance of sluggers and in
timidators to mark their ballots fol- j
lowing the bitterest Republican cam-;
paign ever seen in Chicago.
The Democratic vote was light, due
to the fact that there were no con
tests in that party and thousands
called for Republican ballots. Similar
reports of heavy Republican voting
came from principal cities in Illinois,
indicating the entire state was
aroused by the "pineapple" throwing
staged in the final weeks of the cam
paign in Chicago.
