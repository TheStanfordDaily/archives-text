# Dramatic Council Offers Two Tickets For Return Of Missing Sign
## 
### 
It lias happened again.
True to form, the Dramatic Council
announces the disappearance of the
neatly lettered sign recently sus
pended across Lasuen Street at the
Postoffice. The large metal letters
used by the council in announcing
current dramatic productions evident
ly appeal to students who have a
penchant for freak room decorations.
Once a quarter someone "finds" a few
letters. This time the entire sign,
"Caesar and Cleopatra," is missing.

The Council is proud of the sign
and wants it back. As an indication
of his attitude in the matter, Norman
Larsen, dramatic manager, announced
yesterday that he will part with two
tickets for "Caesar and Cleopatra"
which he has offered as a reward
for the return of the sign. Simply
take the letters to the office and walk
out with the tickets. Gravy!
