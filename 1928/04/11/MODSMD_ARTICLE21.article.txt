in poetic feeling and variety of mood,
was a brilliant finale for the program
of piano, violin, and organ at the Me
morial Church last night. Frances

Peirce, violinist, and Warren D. Allen,
organist, rendered this masterpiece
for the piano with the orchestral part
beautifully transcribed for the organ.

and clearness of the piano, the har
mony and intensity of the organ, and
the melodic sweetness of the violin
produced a symphonic effect of ma
jestic proportions. Jarnefelt's Ber
ceuse was particularly fitted for por
trayal through this combination.
Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor
by J. S. Bach, "one of the noblest of
all great works for the organ," was
interpreted with great precision of
feeling by Warren D. Allen. Its sud
den variations, vivacity and quietness,
and its two themes were contrasted
excellently.
