Every once in a while a debating society makes the complaint that no
one seems to be interested in going to debates any more. \\ ell, what can
they expect, when a large portion of the topics discussed are older than
the hills? How many people are interested in hearing a debate, no matter
how learned, on subjects such as: The United States Foreign Policy, '1 he
Philippines, Taxation, The League of Nations, Abolishment of the Two-
Thirds Rule in Democratic Nominating Conventions, Is It Right to Dis
obey Unjust Laws, etc., etc.?
What is the purpose of the debating society? Is it in existence to
enlighten people who haven't studied given topics to as great an extent
as the debaters? Is its aim to give amusement and experience to the par
ticipants? Probably a mixture of the two, with the weight decidedly on
the latter, is its real object. But, in accomplishing that object, the debaters
require an audience.
There are several ways to get audiences: one is to amuse them, another
to arouse their passions, and still another to give out information they
want to obtain. Other ways can be mentioned, but these will suffice. Now
people who go to a debate to really learn something are those who usually
think for themselves, and aren't interested in hearing a repetition of the
old arguments pro and con about the U.S. foreign policy, etc. They want
something new, or at least a bit out of the ordinary.
To amuse a group of people is perhaps the best method of assuring
continued audience. But it is hard to find debaters who can truly amuse.
Even if such performers were plentiful, it wouldn't be sensible to have
only humorous contests. A diversity of topics is what is needed, and in
getting a variety, the subjects should not be the old time-worn favorites.
If the debaters want an audience they must not only be the actors, but
the casting director and booking agent as well.

It might be mentioned that Euphronia Debating Society is discussing
fraternities Thursday night. This is, in view of rushing, a timely topic,
and will probably be handled in an entertaining manner.
