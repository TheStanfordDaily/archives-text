Up at Folsom is a man serving a life sentence for killing a policeman,
lie is called Judah Benjamin, "California's loneliest prisoner." This
phrase has been applied to him, for he has been in solitary confinement
for practically nine years, from his own choice. When he was sent to
Folsom he refused to sign the entrance papers, and since has consistently
refused to do any work whatsoever, or to conform to any of the prison
rules. As a consequence he has had to remain in "sol."
At one time the warden had a lunacy board examine Benjamin, and
they pronounced him insane. This irritated the prisoner and he went
before a jury and proved himself sane, feeling highly indignant that such
a stigma should be cast upon his mentality. So back to his cell he went,
refusing to work because working in a prison is against his religious
beliefs.

Here is a man who has, at least, accomplished considerably more than
many California juries have. From his actions it seems clear that he
prefers not to conform to any of the rules of society. It is much better,
then, to have him out of society's way, where he can do no more harm.
The pity is that a glib-tongued lawyer can stand in front of "twelve
good men and true" and convince them that a perfectly sane (legally)
man has dementia whatnot, and thus obtain for his client mere incar
ceration in an asylum for a few years, from which he will shortly be
released to carry on further acts of lawlessness.
If individuals on a jury only had the pride in their mentality that the
"loneliest prisoner" has evidenced, perhaps the "insanity ' plea wouldn t
be so popular.

The Drifter says the forms of the things in the world will change with
the increased use of the airplane, and that even "a cow will come to have
much the same form for us that a cockroach now has."
That may all be true, but no self-respecting cow is going to climb into
bed just to take a nice bite into us while we sleep.

At a recent class vote, the seniors of Yale College expressed the pref
erence of a Phi Beta Kappa key to the "Y" earned in major sports.
And they say college students make gods of athletes!
