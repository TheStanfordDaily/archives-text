"Strange Interlude," Eugene O'Neil.
Boni & Liveright.
It is a curious thing the very defi-
I nite impression the "Strange Inter-
I lude" leaves with you—a mixed in
fluence —the way you feel when you
have heard a symphony concert and
been to a dentist's office in the same
afternoon. This is one of the most
successful of the O'Neil masque plays,
but fortunately intended primarily
for the reading public.
An exhausting play to read. The
very magnificence of its scope, and
the hugeness of its plan raises a ques
tion in our minds of its artistic value.
An audience that is worn out is worse
than no audience at all, and except
in a few exceptional cases, that is,
we believe, the predicament the ninth
and last act would leave both readers
and spectators. The theme of the
triple-relationship of Nina to the
three men involves a number of com
plicated issues which O'Neil follows
up fully—with the result that the
reader is exhausted both emotionally
j and from sheer physical fatigue. He
I seems to neglect the value of sugges
tion —a marked contrast to the treat-
I ment of "Beyond the Horizon."
Epigrams Good
The interpretation of the thought
processes of his cast seems stronger
both dramatically and artistically
than the actual dialogue. Marsden,
the repressed morbid introvert of an
author, is beautifully done. There are a

number of epigrams sprinkled through
the play that remain with you—such
as the characterization of the profes
sor's study: "a cosy cultured retreat,
sedulously built as a sanctuary where,
secure with the culture of the past at
his back, a fugitive from reality can
view the present safely from a dis- j
tance, as a superior with condescend- j
ing disdain, pity, and even amuse- ;
ment." And Nina's comment, "L-i-i-f-e! |
Just a long drawn-out lie with a
sniffling sigh at the end!"
Technically, the "Strange Inter
lude" can not be considered as an
other of O'Neil's mental gymnastics,
nor can it be considered an experi- i
ment. The vehicle for his theory is
too carefully worked out, and the
hybrid form of drama crossed by the
novel seems a fairly well-grown ani
mal.
Sincerity Questioned
Rrtistically, however, it is a different
question. It surely leaves a very defi-1
nite impression—whether that is be
cause of the character delineation or
because too many of our own secret
springs of thought are tapped does
not matter, perhaps. This impression
is not toward the particular figures !
of the play, but toward life in gen- j
eral. We would be a good deal hap-'
pier in our minds if we knew whether
this was a sincere example of O'Neil's
conception of human marionettes, or
whether his conception was influenced |
by a poor digestive system.
