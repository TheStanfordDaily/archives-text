# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
Tlie Editor, Sir:
There appeared in a recent edition
of the "Daily" a statement concern
ing the Walsli-for-President club on
the campus; and concerning that
statement, I beg leave to make a few
observations.
When a man is nominated by his'
friends as their choice for presidency, ;
it is desirable to have a strong plat-1
form, in order to secure his nomina- j
tion by the convention. The friends
of Mr. Walsh on the campus have
made his platform, the "very antithe
sis of Mr. Hoover's stand." This can
hardly be called a flattering indorse
ment for any man, whether he be a
candidate or not. As qualifications for
the position of Chief Magistrate, Mr.
Hoover places before the public his
past record and inherent ability. For
sheer ability, Mr. Hoover has no peer
in this country. Failure in a big posi
tion is unknown to him. His work in
instituting the Belgian Relief Fund,
his Flood Relief program and the
conduct of the Department of Com
merce during the past eight years,
are works of genius, and command
only the highest admiration. Mr.

Hoover stands for progress, and will
give to the public that kind of an
administration, if elected.
If Mr. Walsh stands for the "anti
thesis" of this record of Mr. Hoover,
it is plain that Mr. Wash has a weak
platform for thinking voters. Mr.
Walsh is undoubtedly a man of sin
cerity, truth, and honesty, but the
ordinary man is possessed of the
same attributes. But it is not the
ordinary man that possessed the great
ability of Mr. Hoover. Mr. Walsh's
claim to fame is not based upon any
great constructive legislative program
in the Halls of Congress, but rather
upon his service on the Investigation
Committees. While these services are
necessary and worthwhile, they hard
ly qualify a man for the highest posi
tion in the land.
Not being a member of the Hoover
for-President club on the campus or
elsewhere, I can thus speak without
fear of censure for partiality. But
neither will I join any organization
which has for its basis, the "antithe
sis" of what Mr. Hoover stands for.
Yours respectfully,
Paul E. Jackson.
