Twenty-six track and field athletes I
A
from Southern California colleges are
preparing for a northward trek to
engage Coach "Dink" Templeton's ;
Card warriors in the' Stadium Satur-1
day afternoon. Eight of the visitors
will be from Occidental, seven from
Pomona, six from San Diego, two
from Caltech, two from Whittier, and
one from Redlands.
The Southerners are not backward
in expressing their meagre hope of
making a dent against the powerful
Stanford aggregation, but are able to
boast of some dangerous individual
stars.
Goodheart, of Occidental, and
Brown, of San Diego, have both
hit 4 minutes and 30 seconds in I

the mile, and are capable of mak
ing 2 minutes flat in the half.
And according to word from South
ern California the All-Stars will pre
sent an array of sprinters who should
force Lauritzen to make better than
even time in the short sprints. Laurit
zen, by the way, has been showing
rapid improvement in both his races,
and should soon be in a position to be
a, reasonably dangerous threat in any
company.
The bloodiest slaughter will
come, probably, in the field
events. The Cards hold an undis
puted supremacy in the West as
far as hurling and jumping over
things goes; so the All-Stars, ad
mittedly weak in that quarter,
should be easily swamped. A pos
sible exception may be in the
broad jump as the visitors have
six men capable of bettering 22
feet, and may grab a second or
third in that event. â€”Bob Speers.
