# AND Then Our a Little SALLY...
## 
### 
Men's rushing is going to be loads
of fun. Why I am all exeited and
interested already. It is so amusing
to watch all the little freshmen come
vaguely wandering up the Row.
I really do feel sorry for them, all
scared-like. Because they just know
that everyone is giving them the once
over like in a fashion show, from
the feet on up.
Hut I don't understand how the men
can really tell whether they like a
person just by looking them over. I
mean, you can't always be sure it was
the same one you saw on the Quad
the day before.
But I guess the freshmen have a
little different expression from the
older men. They really seem so nice
and safe and cute. And they don't
have that self-satisfied look that is
so annoying. I mean, no one likes to
be made to feel that she is absolutely
unnecessary.
And then, they do look intelligent
when they say hello. And they are
willing to take a chance.
And I think that when men rush
and are not willing to take a chance
on anything, why they just get left
because, after all, no one really trusts
anyone else. Just see what happened
over the vacations.
I just love to see the men being
really nonchalant and brave. And
when they play baseball and games
everyone simply howls. I mean, any
one would try to be a good sport
whenever he is on a party, anyway.
I often wonder just what men talk
about. I mean, judging things in the
usual way, they must think that still
water doesn't get as far as active
liquids.
But the nicest thing is the way
that all the men just suddenly blos
solin out like they were sort of in
love. I mean, they seem to really hav°
a purpose, and aren't quite as dazed
as usually.
