# ROPER FLOUTS ALLEGED EASTERN SUPERIORITY

### 
COLUMBUS, Ohio— (I P ). — Eastern i
athletic superiority? There's no such j
thing!
In words to this effect, William A.
Roper, Princeton football coach, con
demns the belief that better athletic
groups emanate from the imperious
East than from the rustic West.
"Football teams depend upon the
material furnished, and in a degree j
on the coach and backing. You can't
have a good team without the ma- j

terial, but the material can be found
in all parts of the country—not only
in the East."
