# VARSITY TENNIS TEAM MEETS U.C. SATURDAY ON BERKELEY COURTS
## 
### 
It has been definitely decided that <
the varsity tennis team will go up to
Berkeley this Saturday to meet the ;
California team on the Berkeley Ten
nis Club courts. The three singles
matches will start at 10 o'clock in
the morning, with two doubles match
es immediately following.
Four men on the California team, !
who will match forces with the var-1
sity, are Dick lloogs, Bob Hager, Mar
tin McKee, and Nebo Chasseur. lloogs,
Hager, and McKee all are very evenly |
matched and have at some time or j
other during the season been first
man on the squad. Although these j
men are rated highly as tennis play-:
ers, the California team had little;
luck in the four-way meet in Los An
geles, March 30 and 31, and their
total score was only one or two
points.
The men who will represent Stan-1
ford are A1 Herrington, John "Wheat
ley, Ralph McElvenny, and Gomer
Thomas. Herrington, Wheatley, and I
McElvenny will play singles matches,;
while Herrington and McElvenny will
play first doubles, with Thomas-
Wheatley meeting their second doubles
team. Hoogs and Hager, of California,
will form their first doubles team,
and McKee and Chasseur will play
second doubles. '
In the Los Angeles meet, Herring- 1
ton and McElvenny defeated McKee J
and Chasseur, and they also defeated |
Hoogs and Hager in straight sets. It ;
is expected that the varsity will win j
the first doubles and probably lose
the second doubles, thus it will be |
necessary to take at least two out j
of the three singles matches in order!
to win the meet.
