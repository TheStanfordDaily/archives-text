# Professor Sidney Townley Believes Scientists May Discover New Planet
## 
### 
Belief that another planet may be
added to the known bodies in the
solar system was expressed yesterday
by Professor Sidney D. Townley of
the Mathematics department here. "It
is more probable that a new planet
will be found than that one will not
be found," he declared.
The new planet, whose position has
been calculated by Professor William
H. Pickering of Harvard, is computed
to be about half the size of the earth
and to revolve about the sun in an
orbit which is partially within and
partially without that of Neptune, at
present the outermost planet of our
system.
At present the Harvard, Yerkes,
and Lick observatories are conduct
ing a thus-far fruitless search for the
planet. A telescope would be neces
sary to see the object, which would
appear from the earth as a star of
the twelfth magnitude. According to
Professor Pickering's calculations, the
planet is at present in the constella
tion Cancer where, Professor Town
ley declares, there should be no par
ticular difficulty in finding it if Pick
ering's calculations are correct.
Professor Pickering's calculations
call to mind the feat of Adams and
Leverrier, who independently of each
other predicted in 1845 the existence
of the planet Neptune from deviations
in the calculated orbit of Uranus, the
outermost known planet at that time.
The deviations of Neptune, upon

which Pickering bases his calcula
tions, are much smaller than those
upon which Adams and Leverrier
had to work. The deviations of Uranus
from its computed orbit amounted to
only three minutes of arc, or about
one-tenth of the apparent diameter of
the moon as viewed from the earth.
The observed deviation of Neptune
amounts to but three seconds of arc.

As time goes on, Professor Town
ley states, the probabilities of finding
the new planet, if any such object ac
tually exists, will increase. Neptune,
with its period of 165 years, has only
made about half a revolution around
the sun since its discovery in 1845.
In the future the deviations of the
planet from its predicted course
should grow larger and larger until
they give astronomers enough data
to base their calculations upon the
new object's position more accurately.

tions, are much smaller than those
upon which Adams and Leverrier
had to work. The deviations of Uranus
from its computed orbit amounted to
only three minutes of arc, or about
one-tenth of the apparent diameter of
the moon as viewed from the earth.
The observed deviation of Neptune
amounts to but three seconds of arc.

As time goes on, Professor Town
ley states, the probabilities of finding
the new planet, if any such object ac
tually exists, will increase. Neptune,
with its period of 165 years, has only
made about half a revolution around
the sun since its discovery in 1845.
In the future the deviations of the
planet from its predicted course
should grow larger and larger until
they give astronomers enough data
to base their calculations upon the
new object's position more accurately.
Belief that another planet may be
added to the known bodies in the
solar system was expressed yesterday
by Professor Sidney D. Townley of
the Mathematics department here. "It
is more probable that a new planet
will be found than that one will not
be found," he declared.
The new planet, whose position has
been calculated by Professor William
H. Pickering of Harvard, is computed
to be about half the size of the earth
and to revolve about the sun in an
orbit which is partially within and
partially without that of Neptune, at
present the outermost planet of our
system.
At present the Harvard, Yerkes,
and Lick observatories are conduct
ing a thus-far fruitless search for the
planet. A telescope would be neces
sary to see the object, which would
appear from the earth as a star of
the twelfth magnitude. According to
Professor Pickering's calculations, the
planet is at present in the constella
tion Cancer where, Professor Town
ley declares, there should be no par
ticular difficulty in finding it if Pick
ering's calculations are correct.
Professor Pickering's calculations
call to mind the feat of Adams and
Leverrier, who independently of each
other predicted in 1845 the existence
of the planet Neptune from deviations
in the calculated orbit of Uranus, the
outermost known planet at that time.
The deviations of Neptune, upon

which Pickering bases his calcula
tions, are much smaller than those
upon which Adams and Leverrier
had to work. The deviations of Uranus
from its computed orbit amounted to
only three minutes of arc, or about
one-tenth of the apparent diameter of
the moon as viewed from the earth.
The observed deviation of Neptune
amounts to but three seconds of arc.
