## 
### 
MADISON, Wis. — (I.P.) —Equipped
with parts missing from the original,
the famous Muir clock at the Univer
sity of Wisconsin once more will
work.
When Muir was a student at the
university more than half a century

ago he worked out a mechanical
time-clock which, when properly set,
would bring to the desk to which i»
was attached the book he should be
studying at the time. When the time
was up the main wheel would collapse
and another book would be brought
in its place.

"A legal mind is the prime requisite bf
any successful lawyer," says Professor
William K. Arthur of the University of
Colorado. The successful lawyer must
like his torts and retorts better than any
thing else.
