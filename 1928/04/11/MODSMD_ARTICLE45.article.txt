## 
### 
With the outcome of the 1928 Stan
ford-California freshman baseball
title dependent upon the second
game of the series which will be
played at 3 o'clock tomorrow at West
Field in Berkeley, the rejuvenated
Cardinal team will enter the contest
with the odds slightly against them.

California won the first game Satur
day, but Coach liusky Hunt believes
that if his men win tomorrow they
should have no trouble defeating the
one-pitcher Blue and Gold aggrega
tion in the vnal game here next Sat
urday.
Coach Hunt has designated seven
teen men to make the Berkeley trip.
Those who will start in the game are:
Hedge 3b, Teague 11), Hunken, If,
Johnson ss, Fessio c, Loomis p, Rey
nolds rf, Allen cf, and Magee 2b. The
substitutes are: Story, Gillette, and
Tickner, pitchers; Hardy, catcher;
McGarr and Mears, inkeld men; Wit
tenau and Miller, fielders.

Seniors in their last semester at Prince
ton University are to be granted unlim
ited cuts in lecture classes as a result of
a petition presented to the university fac
ulty by the student council.
University of California contemplates
an addition of 20,000 seats to its Memo
rial Stadium.
