Bids for the Junior Prom, spon-1
sored by the Class of 1929 and to be
held on Friday, May 11, will go on
sale Monday afternoon at 1 o'clock in
the A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union,
according to Ted Krough, chairman
of the ticket committee of the Prom.
Krough will be in the office from 1
until 4 o'clock, he announces. Sale
j of bids will be made only to juniors
who have paid their class dues,
j Krough declares. Those wishing to
, buy bids may, if they are now delin
quent, pay their dues at the time they :
get their bids, in order to qualify.
Sale of bids under this restriction will
| be continued indefinitely, Krough ad- 1
vises.
The decorative effects of this year's
Prom will be unlike those of any
I dance held on the campus in some
time. Powell Carpenter, chairman of
! the decorations committee, has ar
ranged an especially unique scheme
of the Louis XIV Period for the ap
proach to the Pavilion, where the
j dance will, of course, be held.
The inner circle before the Pavilion
i will be kept clear of cars, and a car
! pet, covered by a marquee, will reach
: from the main doors to the outer
' street. When the machines draw up,
j their doors will be opened by a liv
! eried footman, while another assists
the ladies to the ground. Passing
down the carpeted walk, one will
enter the corridor of the Pavilion, ;
j which will be draped in ivory and
rose.
A contract for the decorative work
of the ballroom and the corridors has
been made with the J. L. Stewart Co.,
of San Francisco, and the work will
go forward rapidly after the Military
Ball, April 20.
