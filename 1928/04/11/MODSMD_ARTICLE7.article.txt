# PHYSICAL EDUCATION MAJOR, MINOR BEING PLANNED BY BUNTING
## 
### 
Contemplating establishment of a
teaching major or minor, or both, in
Physical Education for Women, Helen
Masters Bunting, head of the depart
ment, is conducting a survey of the
present student body to determine the
advisability of the project.

Cards have been sent to all the
women asking if they would he inter
ested in either of the courses, in
order to obtain tangible information
as to the probable registration. Miss

Bunting believes that this is the best
way to determine what the interest
in the major or minor would be, espe
cially in the case of lower classmen
who have not yet decided upon their
majors.
Major departments in Women's
Physical Education are part of the
curriculum of practically all the uni
versities and colleges on the coast.
