# ALFRED HERTZ PLEASES WITH LIGHT CONCERT
## Koraskow's "Scheherazade" Given Biggest Ovation By Audience PROGRAM IS MODERN "Cid Suite" Proves Popular With Its Characteristic Spanish Rhythm 
### Margaret Cummings 
An enthusiastic and highly appreci
ative audience received the concert
given last night by Alfred Hertz's
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
The program was somewhat light, but
quite modern and colorful.
All the glamour and glitter of an
oriental pageant was portrayed in the
richly melodic symphonic suite,
Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade,"
which was given the biggest ovation
by the audience. The architectural
splendor of the composition was im
pressive; the lyrical parts in distinct
contrast to the heavier and more lan
gorous strains, with the interest cen
tering climactically upon the crashing
music representing the sea storm.
Mishel Piastro's solo violin work
in Saint SaÃ«ns' "Rondo Capriccioso"
gave delicate artistry to the swiftly
moving, rhythmic, and quite brief
rondo.
Hertz's own orchestration was used
in playing Kreisler's "Caprice Vien
noise," a yearning, poignantly beauti
ful favorite. It was played with a
sympathy of feeling which brought
out the full melodic and harmonic
richness of appeal that is there.
Flutes, clicking castanets, tambou
rines combined with the characteris
tic and stirring rhythm of "The Cid
Suite" from Massenet's opera to make
this group rank next to the "Schehera
zade" in interest. In the seven short
movements, types of music represent
ative of different provinces and of
dances ranged from the rather haunt
ing minor strains so typical of the
Iberian peoples, to the gay and ex
travagant measures which are to be
found in some of their dances.
A second concert is being held in
the Pavilion at 3 o'clock this after
noon. Admission will be fifty cents.
