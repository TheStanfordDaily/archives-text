# DAVIS FEARS TENNIS TEAM TOO CONFIDENT FOR BERKELEY MATCH
## 
### 
"They are going to have a harder
! fight than most people think," said
Coach Hal Davis yesterday, concern
ing the varsity tennis team's chance
of taking the meet from California
Saturday morning on the Berkeley
Tennis Club courts. According to
Davis, the men on the varsity think
they are better than they really are,
as was shown in the meet last Satur
day against the University of Oregon.
The courts at the Berkeley Tennis
Club are much slower than the var
sity courts, and another condition
with which the team will probably
I have to contend, is the wind which
is usually blowing around the bay
region.
The freshman tennis team com
-1 pleted its season last Saturday with
, the California meet, but sometime
i within a month a meet will be held
j between the freshman and varsity
teams.
After this meet Saturday, the var
[ sity will be through until May 18,
! when it goes north to Seattle to com
pete in the Pacific Coast Conference.
Herrington and Hall are going to the
Ojai Tournament April 26, 27, and 28,
and Forbes and Easton of the fresh
man team will probably go down also.
