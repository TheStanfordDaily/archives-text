# LOWDEN STRENGTHENS PRESIDENTIAL HOLD IN ILLINOIS VOTE RESULT
## Al Smith Gains Control of State's 53 Democrat Party Delegates 
### 
CHICAGO, 111., April ll.—(U.P.)—
Illinois voters completely wrecked the
Small-Thompson-Crowe alliance, gave
the Republican list of candidates for the
November election an entirely new com
plexion, and lent added strength to the
presidential candidacy of Frank O. Low
den, a survey of Tuesday's primary
showed tonight.
The Democratic leaders in the state
were jubilant because they saw a breach
in the ranks of the Republicans so great
that the remaining months until Novem
ber will be unable to heal it. The bitter
ness which waged openly in the primary
campaign will leave its marks on the
Republican candidates, the Democrats
felt.
The so-called Deneen slate of candi
dates under the banner of the Emmerson-
Deneen-Swanson ticket won nominations
all through the list with estimated ma
jorities ranging from 200,000 to 400,000.
Louis L. Emmerson, candidate for the
gubernatorial nomination, was given the
biggest state-wide victory when he .de
feated Governor Len Small by an esti
mated majority of approximately 400,000.
Governor A1 Smith of New York as
sumed practically complete control of Il
linois' 53 delegates to the Houston con
vention. Convention delegates headed by
the George E. Brennan wing of the party,
which will support the New York gover
nor, were chosen throughout the state.
