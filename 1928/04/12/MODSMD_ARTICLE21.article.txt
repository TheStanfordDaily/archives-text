# Appreciation Of Music Acquired Declares Hertz
## Find Greater Love of Music In Younger Europeans Than in Americans 
### Louise Dohrmann 
"An appreciation of good music is
an acquired taste," said Alfred Hertz,
director of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, last night in an in
terview. "It is important for college
students to hear good music. They are
representative of the next generation,
and therefore the continuation of a
love of music goes through them." He
believes that for the most part uni
versity men and women appreciate
the arts, and that a broader education
aids in an understanding of higher
things.
Hertz declares that there is a
greater love of music among the
younger Europeans than among the
Americans. He attributes this to the
stress laid on music in the European
homes. "Over there a child is brought
up on music and it is bred in him,"
he says. "There is less emphasis laid
on athletics, which leaves more time
for the arts."
Twenty-five years ago the best
musicians were to be found in Europe,
but now the most eminent artists are
in our own country, according to the
orchestra leader. "America is a young
country. The soil must be prepared
for the production of genius. The
older nations started a few hundred
years sooner, so they have produced
a few more masters than we. But we
are on the way."
When questioned about the appeal
of modern music, Hertz said time was
needed for a true evaluation. "It is
like anything new and radically dif
ferent, like short skirts and bobbed
hair. Some of it is worthwhile, but
nothing much can be made of it yet."
Hertz dismissed the idea of a Big
Game Symphony. He described the
football classic as a drama in itself,
which does not need to be set to
music. He is himself an enthusiast of
football, even though he attended his
first game only two years ago.
Last night was the final concert of
the season. In a short address before
the concert, Alfred Hertz congratu
lated the orchestra on their work and
thanked them for their co-operation.
He expressed the belief that the
players were in the best shape of the
season at the present time.
Hertz looks forward to coming to
Stanford and playing for the students.
He chooses his programs with special
care, laying particular emphasis on
lighter music, since he believes the
audience appreciates his efforts.

younger Europeans than among the
Americans. He attributes this to the
stress laid on music in the European
homes. "Over there a child is brought
up on music and it is bred in him,"
he says. "There is less emphasis laid
on athletics, which leaves more time
for the arts."
Twenty-five years ago the best
musicians were to be found in Europe,
but now the most eminent artists are
in our own country, according to the
orchestra leader. "America is a young
country. The soil must be prepared
for the production of genius. The
older nations started a few hundred
years sooner, so they have produced
a few more masters than we. But we
are on the way."
When questioned about the appeal
of modern music, Hertz said time was
needed for a true evaluation. "It is
like anything new and radically dif
ferent, like short skirts and bobbed
hair. Some of it is worthwhile, but
nothing much can be made of it yet."
Hertz dismissed the idea of a Big
Game Symphony. He described the
football classic as a drama in itself,
which does not need to be set to
music. He is himself an enthusiast of
football, even though he attended his
first game only two years ago.
Last night was the final concert of
the season. In a short address before
the concert, Alfred Hertz congratu
lated the orchestra on their work and
thanked them for their co-operation.
He expressed the belief that the
players were in the best shape of the
season at the present time.
Hertz looks forward to coming to
Stanford and playing for the students.
He chooses his programs with special
care, laying particular emphasis on
lighter music, since he believes the
audience appreciates his efforts.
"An appreciation of good music is
an acquired taste," said Alfred Hertz,
director of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, last night in an in
terview. "It is important for college
students to hear good music. They are
representative of the next generation,
and therefore the continuation of a
love of music goes through them." He
believes that for the most part uni
versity men and women appreciate
the arts, and that a broader education
aids in an understanding of higher
things.
Hertz declares that there is a
greater love of music among the
younger Europeans than among the
Americans. He attributes this to the
stress laid on music in the European
homes. "Over there a child is brought
up on music and it is bred in him,"
he says. "There is less emphasis laid
