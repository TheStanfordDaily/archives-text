# Big Meet Rooters
## 
### 
Rooters' tickets for the Stanford-California Big Meet are on sale at
the Old Union, have been on sale since Tuesday, and will not be on sale
after 5 o'clock this afternoon, after which time it is to be expected a
number of students will be running around crabbing because they can't
obtain a ticket.
At times there has been cause for complaint that not enough time or
publicity was given the students to buy, but if anyone has overlooked the
fact that tickets are being sold these three days, it is his own fault.
