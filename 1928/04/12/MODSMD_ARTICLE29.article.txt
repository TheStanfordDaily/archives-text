# More Than a Gesture

An announcement that Columbia University is making sweeping ad
vances in the salaries of its professors, will be met with hopefulness by
members of the teaching profession.
Every step that is taken to give more money to these men and women
should have hearty approval. It is no use making the trite statement
that teachers are underpaid. Everyone recognizes that fact. But few
have done anything about it. It is to be hoped that more colleges (and
school boards) will fall into line, as Columbia has.
