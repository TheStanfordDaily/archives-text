Another legislature's little joke is announced. It is found in recent
dispatches that Quebec has passed a law forbidding boys and girls under
sixteen years of age to attend a motion picture show. This province
includes Montreal and Quebec. Even the parents of these youngsters
cannot take them to the movies.
The situation is even more ludicrous when we discover that girls of
twelve and boys of fourteen can be married, under the laws of the
province. llow can the poor things learn "What Every Young Girl
Should Know?"

An ad in The Nation reads: "I, a Hindu student and chemist, desire full or
part time work so that in spare time I may work on history of Ancient Hindu
Chemistry, now in preparation. I hold degrees from Cornell and M.I.T. My
experience comprises industrial chemical analysis, laboratory and pure research,
newspaper work, lecturing before college audiences. Impeccable references of
course. What chances are there for me?"
Such modesty must be deserved. •

Stanford had its vacation last week, and the Stanfordites have all gone—thank
God —back to Palo Alto. Item from Caltcch's paper.
Mebbe they don't like us.

Shell pink and canary-colored suits appeared in spots along Hollywood
Boulevard, the celluloid rialto, and pastel shades also were popular with the
sterner sex.—News dispatch from Hollywood, by United Press.
Well, we heard it was getting pretty bad down there, this year. This
proves the rumors.
