# FLOWER PAINTINGS IN ART GALLERY HAVE SOFT COLOR RICHNESS
## 
### 
Paintings of Clara Lyon Hayes
which are on exhibition in the Stan
ford Art Gallery until April 16 were
recently shown in the Paul Elder
gallery in San Francisco where they
were very favorably received.
Mrs. Hayes selects flowers as the
subjects of her best work. The deli
cate shadings of the petals against a
dark background are artistic touches
at which she is a master. She is par
ticularly successful in painting flow
ers in the manner of the Italian and
Dutch masters of the seventeenth
century. Her canvasses possess depth
and richness, and are mellow and soft
in tone. They contrast strikingly and
soothingly to the so-called modern
school of expressionism which empha
sizes the seemingly important ele
ments in the picture to the exclusion
of all else with consequent confusion.
This artist, who is the mother-in
law of Comptroller A. E. Roth, is suc
cessful in her use of color and in
gaining effects of brilliant sunshine in
her work. A sense of tranquility and
peace is secured by the somber
values, and the richness of her
shades.
