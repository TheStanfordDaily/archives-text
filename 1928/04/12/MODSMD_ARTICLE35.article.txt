WAR, AND OTHER SHOOTINGS
Under the apt title of "This Is War,
Gentlemen!" Carleton lieals, writing
in this week's issue of "The Nation,"
sends a few startling remarks after
visiting the battleground in Nicara
gua. Says he: . . We have taken
a place in the minds of these people
with the hated Spanish conquerors of
other days. The password runs among
the people and it echoes in their
songs: 'We must win our second in
dependence from the Americans, from
the Machos, the Yankees, the hated
Gringos. Names enough they have
for us.
"My personal opinion is that if San
dino had arms he could raise an army
of ten thousand men by snapping his
finger; that if he marched into Mana
gua, the capital, tomorrow, he would
receive the greatest ovation in Nica
raguan history. America's friends in
Nicaragua are the politicians who
have bled the country for so many
decades, they are the politicians who
wish to stay in power or to get into
power with our help."
Take it or leave it —but suppose it
is true?
The Prince of Wales falls off
his horse twice in the same race,
bringing the grand total up to
twenty-eight falls.

For the sake of a little variety
in the London dispatches, we
wish somebody would tie the gen
tleman on the next time he races.
We wonder if Dee Reims, veteran
Sacramento motorman, attempted to
fight when "two young fellows" held
him up. Unfortunately he died before
this fact could be ascertained.
Some bandits are scared off by a
woman's scream; others merely pull
the trigger. We don't know the mathe
matical chance of success involved in
bluffing bandits, but it seems clear
enough that the loser bluffs never
more.
One hundred and fifty years of
democracy goes to the polls in
Chicago, amid shootings, kidnap
pings and attempts to stuff the
ballot boxes. Only one has been
reported killed so far.
Octave Valente, with a record of
never once having stepped outside the
city limits of San Francisco in all
the fifty-three years of his life, is
pensioned by the Fire Commission.
How anybody could live in San
Francisco and watch the ships sailing
in and out of the Golden Gate and
never go anywhere, is strange.

woman's scream; others merely pull
the trigger. We don't know the mathe
matical chance of success involved in
bluffing bandits, but it seems clear
enough that the loser bluffs never
more.
One hundred and fifty years of
democracy goes to the polls in
Chicago, amid shootings, kidnap
pings and attempts to stuff the
ballot boxes. Only one has been
reported killed so far.
Octave Valente, with a record of
never once having stepped outside the
city limits of San Francisco in all
the fifty-three years of his life, is
pensioned by the Fire Commission.
How anybody could live in San
Francisco and watch the ships sailing
in and out of the Golden Gate and
never go anywhere, is strange.

WAR, AND OTHER SHOOTINGS
Under the apt title of "This Is War,
Gentlemen!" Carleton lieals, writing
in this week's issue of "The Nation,"
sends a few startling remarks after
visiting the battleground in Nicara
gua. Says he: . . We have taken
a place in the minds of these people
with the hated Spanish conquerors of
other days. The password runs among
the people and it echoes in their
songs: 'We must win our second in
dependence from the Americans, from
the Machos, the Yankees, the hated
Gringos. Names enough they have
for us.
"My personal opinion is that if San
dino had arms he could raise an army
of ten thousand men by snapping his
finger; that if he marched into Mana
gua, the capital, tomorrow, he would
receive the greatest ovation in Nica
raguan history. America's friends in
Nicaragua are the politicians who
have bled the country for so many
decades, they are the politicians who
wish to stay in power or to get into
power with our help."
Take it or leave it —but suppose it
is true?
The Prince of Wales falls off
his horse twice in the same race,
bringing the grand total up to
twenty-eight falls.

For the sake of a little variety
in the London dispatches, we
wish somebody would tie the gen
tleman on the next time he races.
We wonder if Dee Reims, veteran
Sacramento motorman, attempted to
fight when "two young fellows" held
him up. Unfortunately he died before
this fact could be ascertained.
Some bandits are scared off by a
woman's scream; others merely pull
the trigger. We don't know the mathe
matical chance of success involved in
bluffing bandits, but it seems clear
enough that the loser bluffs never
more.
