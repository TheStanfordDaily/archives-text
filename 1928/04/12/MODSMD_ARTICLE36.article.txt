"Take My Advice" —Alcazar.
Whoopee! Son is home from school
and with a bang we are in the midst
of the action in "Take My Advice,"
now playing at the Alcazar. Witty,
exciting, the play moves through
three acts of pure comedy, remark
ably clean and really entertaining.
The plot is woven around the trials
and tribulations of the typical Ameri
can family suffering from the afflic
tion of one stage-struck daughter and
one love-sick boy, which situation al
lows for plenty of comedy. We ven
ture to say that the predicaments and
scrapes these two members of the
younger generation get themselves
into will bring back fond memories
to many students.
And a professor gets them out of
their difficulties! Would there were
more like him. Bradley Clement is the
kind-hearted gentleman who helps
straighten out the family affairs, al

though Irving Mitchell so cleverly j
carries the part that we are sure he
is going to get himself in a terrible I
predicament before he gets the Weav
ers out of theirs.
It is our secret belief that Emerson
Treacy must be just out of prep
school for his performance as Bud
Weaver is true to life even to his
walk. Ann McKay is as good as ho in
her playing of Ann Weaver, his sis- j
ter. The only weak place in the cast
is Robert Adams as Kerry Van Kind.
For the first half hour it's not so bad
but after that one feels like murder- \
ing him. Ken Browne as Jimmy
Thayer, Joseph De Stephani and Leah
Winslow as the fond and doting par
ents, and Ruth Saville as Marella
Scott, all get into the rollicking spirit
of the performance and turn in ster
ling work.
If you are seeking a laugh and some
real amusement take our advice and
see "Take My Advice." —T.C.P.
