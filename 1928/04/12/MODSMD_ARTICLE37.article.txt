Dear Mr. Larsen:
(of dramatic club)
A few days ago, Cassias and T were
walking by the P.O. as old sol made
his way over the eastern hills, about !
six a.m. In the gutter, to our great 1
surprise, we saw Cleopatra being run
under wheel while above her dangled
the mighty Caesar in the last throws

of what had been a stormy night.
Every car that passed on Caesar's
side almost broke its windshield >
against Caesar's lower tin letters.
In short, we viewed a scene that '
was menacing to the well-being of an
innocent passersby. It was apparent
that Cleopatra had fallen for Caesar
sometime before dawn.
We removed the remains to our en
campment and straightened out Cleo
patra with a hammer as best we could ,
for she had been badly dented and j

some of the paint was chipped off the
last two or three letters in her name.
It was not until today's Dippy that
we discovered that we were holding
these two captives, as it were. It
! would seem as though we were liold
| ing them for ransom if we were to
I accept the two tickets offered in re
turn for them. No, we acted from
solely an humanitarian interest and
therefore we understood that society
i really needed these two notable fig
ures back again, we post-haste pro
| ceeded to finish our work along the
J same principles by returning Caesar
' and Cleopatra to the English Building
this morning.
Very sincerely, M. Anthony.
P.S.: If you hang up this sign again,
! please do it carefully!
