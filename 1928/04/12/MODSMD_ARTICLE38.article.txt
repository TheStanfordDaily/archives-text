A THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE
A freshman who has been attend
i ing a certain citizenship class for sev j
eral days was not accounted for in ;
that class by the citizenship office.'
When the instructor asked him if he ;
belonged in the class, he answered.!
"No, but I just visited around and I'
decided that this was the best sec
| tion."
"How about the grades in the sec- i
tion you belong in," said the instruc- i
tor, "won't the instructor of that sec- I
tion flunk you out for nonattendance?" j
"Oh, I don't care about the grades," !
replied the freshman, "it's the infor
mation that I'm after." —DeM.

And that makes us believe in the
old wheeze that "after all bologna is
bologna (wop for baloney) no matter
how thin you slice it."

Here's a little poem that Nicholas

Kerchoffski, our janitor, wrote with i
a moist linger on the undusted top of '
our desk. This only goes to show the
deleterious effect of symphony music J
on the Russian mind —or any mind for
that matter:
To the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra
Oh, would I were a musiker!
To strum upon the mandolin,
To play of love, and hate, and sin—
And blow the harmoniker.
A guy there was in Tolski town
Of wisdom keen, of figure fair,
With purple eyes and greenish hair —
His singing brought him great re
nown.
He sang Franz Liszt's "Lieberstraum"
The audience went wild with glee,
He said, "Kantika will be proud of
me" —
Which to his spirit was a balm.
Rut lasting fame ne'er came to him
For he was poor and she was not.
A flash of fire, a ringing shot —
Fate on earth is hellish grim.
Finis (of this poem and him)

Motto of a modern co-ed: EVERY
MAN FOR HERSELF. —Emma.

I Hew to the line!
I Let the chips fall where they may.
But when I'm in a poker game—
May the "chips" with papa stay!

Try this on your meal ticket —
I'm looking for a honeybunch;
I hope to find the girl today.
Not one who gobbles tons of lunch,
I'm looking for a honeybunch
Who realizes every crunch
On sandwich costs me half my pay.
I'm looking for a honeybunch,
I hope to find the girl today.
