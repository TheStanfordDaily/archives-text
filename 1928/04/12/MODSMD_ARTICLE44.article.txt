# LONG HAIR SHOWS GAIN Campus Survey Being Made TITIAN HEADS ARE RARE

Women having and trying to have
long hair show a gain of ten per cent
over last year's figures as shown in
a survey of Stanford women in living
groups on the campus. Whereas last
year there were only eighty-one heads
of crowning glory and thirteen trying
out for it, this year the numbers are
108 and forty-three respectively.
Verily, the hair-pin industry looks
up! Three-tenths of the women living
on the campus are now chronic con
sumers. And conversely the women's
barbers are languishing for clients.
On this campus alone more than $2,000
is being lost this year to the ton
sorial profession, a sum sufficient to
supply the whole campus—masculine
and feminine alike —with a good-sized
bottle of Listerine!
In the same survey it was found
that only eighteen fellow red-heads
would greet Helen of Troy if she
were to come among us, and Lorelei
would find only eighty-nine true, un
mistakable blondes. Theda Bara, on
the other hand, would be lost in the
comparative obscurity of 136 real
brunettes. Of the so-called middling
type —the indescribable —there flour
ish 155.
If the distinct blonde is a rara avis
and growing rarer every generation
(page Mendel), the red-head threatens
to join the dodo in becoming extinct!
Or else they simply migrate to other
parts than the Stanford campus.
