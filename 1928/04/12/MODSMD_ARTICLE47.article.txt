# Stanford Daily Advertising Staff Conducts Student Budget Survey
## 
### 
In an attempt to determine the po
tential market afforded by Stanford
students for the use of advertisers
and others interested in student buy
i ing power, the advertising staff of the
j Stanford Daily is conducting an ex
i tensive survey of student budgets on
the campus.
Questionnaires are being circulated
among both men and women students
in a personal canvass of tbe student
group. These questionnaires deal
chiefly with the number of clothes,
; accessories, and other purchases of
! students here and in addition will in
dicate the place of purchase as well
! as the amount spent for them. Ques
[ tions relative to the amount spent
i for traveling expenses, automobiles
and their upkeep, and amusements
are incorporated in the question
naires.
Figures secured from Palo Alto
banks on the amount spent per quar
ter by the students of the University
reveal the surprising fact that the
average expenditures of a Stanford
student are in excess of the per capita
I income in the United States. These
' figures will form one of the most in
; teresting pieces of information which
i merchants will be able to gather from
the published survey.
Six weeks will he required to com
pile the data. It will then be published
in book form for the convenient use
; of Daily advertisers or other persons
interested in student expenses. The

completed survey will contain definite
data on a great variety of expendi
tures, even to the extent of indicating
the newspapers read and subscribed
to by Stanford students. It should
form the basis on which merchants
may build constructive sales policies.
