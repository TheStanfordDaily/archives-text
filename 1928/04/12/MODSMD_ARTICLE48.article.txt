### 
The Senior Farce Committee met i
Tuesday night to consider the type
of play to be presented during Senior
Week. The committee has several
plays with good possibilitifes under
consideration, ranging from old-fash
ioned melodrama to straight comedy,
according to Jack Shoup, chairman.
"The committee is particularly fa- '
vorable to melodramatic farce, since
nothing on that order has been pro
duced recently on the campus. At
tempts are being made to procure a
play pleasing to the campus audi
ence." The committee is working hard
under Anna May Price, director of
dramatics, toward that end.
Gene Tunney will lecture on
Shakespeare at Yale University dur
ing the spring semester.

Students and faculty members at I
the University of Oregon have formed j
