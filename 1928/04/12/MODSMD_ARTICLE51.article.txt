# CARDINAL FROSH PLAY CRUCIAL CONTEST ON BEAR DIAMOND TODAY
## Self-Satisfaction Is Shaken; Cards Determined to Trim Rivals 
### 
Eighteen determined Cardinal yearling
baseball men will invade the lair of the
Golden Hear this afternoon with the ex
pressed purpose of thoroughly trimming
their California rivals. The Berkeley
frosh captured the first contest of the
'28 series, 4-3. Stanford must win this
afternoon and Saturday to bring the
championship to the farm.
Though shifts in the personnel of the
Card nine have been few for today's
game, there has been a complete change
from the semi-self-satisfied attitude that
has been evident all season.
Coach Hunt is certain that if his nien
can win today, they should have little
trouble defeating California in the final
tilt Saturday. The Blue and Gold aggre
gation has but one pitcher of any skill.
Hunt is also positive that he has a better
team man for man than the Berkeleyites.
Vard Loomis, who will be on the
mound for Stanford, is in the pink of
condition. At the first of the season he
was essentially a curve ball pitcher but
now has developed several other tricks.
Joe Fessio studied the California bat
ters last Saturday and will be behind the
plate today. Fessio is the strongest
thrower on the squad and a consistent
batsman.
Mike Reynolds will be the third mar
in the outfield with Captain John Hunken
and Ralph Allen. The three make an
exceptionally strong hitting trio.
Stanford's stellar infield, composed of
Chuck Teague at first, Paul Magee at
second, Dykes Johnson at shortstop, and
Norman Hedge at third, will again see
action in today's tilt. All men arc accu
rate fielders, and Teague and Hedge have
been since early in the season among the
heavy hitters.
