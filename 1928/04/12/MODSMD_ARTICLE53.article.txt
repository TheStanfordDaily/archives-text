The finest American pottery is that
made by the American Pueblo Indians
of the Southwest, according to art
critics, and some of this will be on
exhibition at the Art Gallery begin
ning Sunday, April 15. Among the
pueblos the pottery of Zuni is con
sidered the finest. For centuries this
ware has been made. In the days of
Coronado, this early explorer report
ed to his king in Spain the "fine water
vessels" made by the Zuni Indians.
One of these Zuni potters will come
to the campus on Sunday for three
days to assist Pedro J. Lemos, direc
tor of the Art Gallery, in his South
west Indian Handicraft exhibition.
Without a potter's wheel of any kind,
the Indian potter produces perfectly
shaped pottery and decorates it with
earthen colors. With a small crude
brush made from Yucca leaves beauti
ful designs representing thunder
birds, sacred deer, rain-clouds, and
lightning are painted in brown, red,
and yellow colors.
The Zuni potter believes that a
"Made Being" exists in any handi
craft. The ringing sound of a com
pleted piece of pottery is the voice
of the "Made Being." The clang of a
broken bowl is the escaping voice.
Whistling or sounds similar to breath
ing pottery are never permitted near
the potter for fear that the "Made
Being" will attempt to escape to join
the sound and thereby break the pot
tery.
The Indians go to their pottery for
their water and their meal. Pottery
is therefore considered sacred as an
intermediary between nature and
their existence. The other Indian
craftsworkers will do blanket weav
ing, silver-work, turquoise drilling,
and sand-painting.
