# CARD NINE PRACTICES BATTING FOR SECOND GAME OF U.C. SERIES
## 
### 
After meekly bowing to California
last Saturday, the Cardinal baseball
nine has been going through some
strenuous practice sessions tbis week,
and if nothing goes wrong, Coach
Wolter believes that the tables will
be reversed at Berkeley next Satur
i day and that the Golden Bears will
' finish the game grabbing at the short
J end of a long score.
Wolter has been working the Cards
i ample when it comes to batting.
| Asked yesterday if they had been
I showing improvement, he merely re
marked that they are still swinging
but not hitting much. The outlook,
however, isn't half bad; and the Stan
ford men should be able to whale
into the offerings of the Berkeley
twirlers and bring back a victory.
Nemeehek, who did the hurling for
the Bears last week, will probably
start in the box again Saturday. He
walked enough Cards at West Field
in the April 7 game to begin another
"bunion derby," and if the Stanford
hitters will do something besides just
swing, "once again the Cardinal will
whip the Gold and Blue."
Wolter's numerous chuckers have
all been taking turns at tossing them
over this week. Reynolds, who has
pitched in but one game this year,
looked fairly good Tuesday, and
seems to have lots of speed. The task
of throwing them over the platter
against the Bears has not yet been
assigned to any particular hurler.
Sobieski, Kern, Philippi, or Lewis
are all likely starters.
