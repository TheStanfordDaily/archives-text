# VARSITY SEEKS REVENGE FROM BEAR BATSMEN
## Second California Triumph Would Finish Stanford Title Aspirations Berkeley Nine Takes Three Games in Row, Offers Strong Lineup 
### Frank Whiteley 
With a week of strenuous practice
sessions behind it and memory of the
6-2 defeat handed out by the Bears
last Saturday still occupying a promi
nent place in the thoughts of its mem-
T>ers, the Cardinal varsity baseball
nine will meet California at West
Field, Berkeley, tomorrow afternoon
at 3 o'clock in the second game of
the annual series. Twenty-three play
ers, practically the whole squad, will
make the trip.
Coach Harry Wolter has a good
nine this year, and for a while it
looked to be of championship calibre.
Two tough breaks on the southern
trip, loss of a ten-inning game to
XT.S.C. here, and last Saturday's
game put the damper 011 hopes of
winning the California Collegiate
Baseball Conference. California's vic
tory over St. Mary's yesterday, how
•ever, helps materially the chances of
the Cards finishing near the top posi
tion. Two wins over California and
-one over U.C.L.A. in the three re
maining games should place Stanford
very near the top. Stanford has won
four games and lost five.
California Strong
California has demonstrated conclu
sively in the past two weeks that it
has a ball team. After dropping its
first five games, it has wou the last
three contests, against U.S.C., Stan
ford, and St. Mary's. Tomorrow's
game should be one of the best of the
1928 conference season. It will have
to be some game, though, if it equals
the hectic seventeen-inning affair be
tween the Cards and Bears last year.
The Cardinal starting lineup will
probably be the same as that which
has started most of the games this
year. Captain Cook Sypher, who has
been doing stellar work behind the
plate, will do the receiving. Bill Ma
guire will cover the first sack, while
"Gerry" Garibaldi and Bill Laird wlil
do the work at second and third, re
spectively. Maguire is a classy in
flelder and can always be depended
on to get the runner out if the ball
is anywhere within reach. Garibaldi
is a consistently good second baseman
and a strong hitter. Last year there
was no regular at third, and Wolter
rotated three or four men at this
position. Laird, coming up from the
1927 freshman team, was given the
job at the beginning of the present

j season and has held it against all
comers. Add to these three Jim Busch,
J shortstop, and one has as good a col
j lege infield as any coach could desire.
Outfieid Fast
i The outfield is made up of Jack
'Levin, left; Frank Wilton, center;
j and Bob Sims, right. All three are
fast and reliable fielders. Wilton and
i Sims are heavy hitters, and Levin
I can always be depended on to come
| through with a blow in the pinches.

1927 freshman team, was given the
job at the beginning of the present

The Card moundsman for tomorrow
has not yet been named.
With a week of strenuous practice
sessions behind it and memory of the
6-2 defeat handed out by the Bears
last Saturday still occupying a promi
nent place in the thoughts of its mem-
T>ers, the Cardinal varsity baseball
nine will meet California at West
Field, Berkeley, tomorrow afternoon
at 3 o'clock in the second game of
the annual series. Twenty-three play
ers, practically the whole squad, will
make the trip.
Coach Harry Wolter has a good
nine this year, and for a while it
looked to be of championship calibre.
Two tough breaks on the southern
trip, loss of a ten-inning game to
XT.S.C. here, and last Saturday's
game put the damper 011 hopes of
winning the California Collegiate
Baseball Conference. California's vic
tory over St. Mary's yesterday, how
•ever, helps materially the chances of
the Cards finishing near the top posi
tion. Two wins over California and
-one over U.C.L.A. in the three re
maining games should place Stanford
very near the top. Stanford has won
four games and lost five.
California Strong
California has demonstrated conclu
sively in the past two weeks that it
has a ball team. After dropping its
first five games, it has wou the last
three contests, against U.S.C., Stan
ford, and St. Mary's. Tomorrow's
game should be one of the best of the
1928 conference season. It will have
to be some game, though, if it equals
the hectic seventeen-inning affair be
tween the Cards and Bears last year.
The Cardinal starting lineup will
probably be the same as that which
has started most of the games this
year. Captain Cook Sypher, who has
been doing stellar work behind the
plate, will do the receiving. Bill Ma
guire will cover the first sack, while
"Gerry" Garibaldi and Bill Laird wlil
do the work at second and third, re
spectively. Maguire is a classy in
flelder and can always be depended
on to get the runner out if the ball
is anywhere within reach. Garibaldi
is a consistently good second baseman
and a strong hitter. Last year there
was no regular at third, and Wolter
rotated three or four men at this
position. Laird, coming up from the
1927 freshman team, was given the
job at the beginning of the present

j season and has held it against all
comers. Add to these three Jim Busch,
J shortstop, and one has as good a col
