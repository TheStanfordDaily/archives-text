# STANFORD CHANCES TO RETAIN RACQUET TITLE ENDANGERED
## California Tilts Tomorrow Last Obstacle Before Stanford Squad 
### 
Stanford's hopes for a second con
secutive Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
tennis championship will either he
confirmed or destroyed in the annual
match with the University of Cali
fornia net men to be played on the
Berkeley Tennis Club courts tomor
row morning at 10 o'clock.
A victory over the Blue and Gold
will give the Cardinals the undisputed
championship of the Southern Divi
sion of the Conference, which, viewed
in the experience of the past years,
practically means the championship
of the Coast.
Stanford Favored
From all indications, Stanford
should hand the Bears a decisive
beating. In the fourway individual
tournament held recently in the
South, Alan Herrington defeated the
best players from Stanford, Berkeley,
U.S.C., and the U.C.L.A., and Herring
ton and Ralph McElvenny won the
doubles. In the course of the singles
play McElvenny eliminated Bud
Hager, first man at Berkeley, anJ
John Wheatley defeated Dick Iloogs,
California captain. In the doubles, Mc-
Elvenny and Herrington won over
both the first and second doubles
teams from Berkeley in straight sets.
If the same Cardinals can do as well
tomorrow, the match is a certainty
for Stanford.
Herrington Fast Man
The line-up of matches is not defi
nitely decided as yet, but Alan Her
rington probably will play Bud Hager,
John Wheatley will play Dick Hoogs,
Ralph McElvenny will play Martin
McKee. In the doubles, McElvenny
and Herrington will meet Hager and
Hoogs, and Wheatley and Thomas
will play McKee and Chasseur.
In the past Stanford fared poorly
in tennis competition with California.
For fourteen years following 1912
Stanford did not win a single team
match from the Bears. Better players
began coming to Stanford and in 1926
Stanford won three matches to two,
and in 1927 won four out of five. This
year the Cardinals should make it
five matches straight.
