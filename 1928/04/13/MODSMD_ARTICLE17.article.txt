# CARD, BEAR FROSH TRACK TILT TODAY
## California Yearlings Hope to Upset Prediction in Berkeley Meet 
### Jean Blum 
Stanford's freshman track team will
'oave at noon today for Berkeley to
meet the Bear Cubs in their annual
track and field contest at 3 o'clock
on the California Oval.
California supporters hope for at
least an even meet but comparative
records give the Cardinal team a vic
tory by thirty points or better. A dry
track is expected to bring fast times,
with possible broken records in the
broad jump, mile run, and 410.
Mile Run Strong
California will send a well-balanced
team upon the field but with the ex
ception of Spud Mossman, distance
man, and Akers, javelin thrower, no
Bear entrant has marks equalling
Stanford records made this season.
California backers concede Mossman
a double victory but he may find his
equal in John Parker, star miler, who
was ineligible last quarter, and in
John Lane, half-miler. Parker ran the
mile in 4 minutes 30 seconds this
week, and Lane has run the SSO in 2
minutes flat.
The most interesting races of the
day will be between Hec Dyer and
Allen McDermott of Stanford and
Pearl Hunter, Christie's colored
