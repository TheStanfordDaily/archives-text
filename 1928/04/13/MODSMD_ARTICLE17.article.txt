# CARD, BEAR FROSH TRACK TILT TODAY
## California Yearlings Hope to Upset Prediction in Berkeley Meet 
### Jean Blum 
Stanford's freshman track team will
'oave at noon today for Berkeley to
meet the Bear Cubs in their annual
track and field contest at 3 o'clock
on the California Oval.
California supporters hope for at
least an even meet but comparative
records give the Cardinal team a vic
tory by thirty points or better. A dry
track is expected to bring fast times,
with possible broken records in the
broad jump, mile run, and 410.
Mile Run Strong
California will send a well-balanced
team upon the field but with the ex
ception of Spud Mossman, distance
man, and Akers, javelin thrower, no
Bear entrant has marks equalling
Stanford records made this season.
California backers concede Mossman
a double victory but he may find his
equal in John Parker, star miler, who
was ineligible last quarter, and in
John Lane, half-miler. Parker ran the
mile in 4 minutes 30 seconds this
week, and Lane has run the SSO in 2
minutes flat.
The most interesting races of the
day will be between Hec Dyer and
Allen McDermott of Stanford and
Pearl Hunter, Christie's colored
sprinter. Dyer and McDermott have
the better marks, but the California
man, who did not compete in the
Bears' earlier meets, has improved
steadily.
Weight Events Strong
Ray Dawson, Card yearling, is fa
vored in the shot put. He has tossed
the 16-pound pellet 43 feet 7 inches,
while Young, California's best, hag
never thrown over 41 feet. Norman
McLeod is a sure first in the discus.
Spenser Austin and Rogers Smith
will find close competition in the high
sticks in George Watkins, who has !
been a consistent point-winner for ;
Christie's squad. Although the Stan- 1
l'ord men have the best season rec
ords, Watkins is said to be a great j
competitive athlete. Reynolds of U.C.,
with a record of 11 feet 8 inches, is I
a slight favorite over Burt DeGroot :
in the pole vault. DeGroot has done |
but 11 feet C inches this year, though j
he topped 12 feet in high school.
Broad Jumpers Good
Local broad jumpers have a bright
chance of a clean sweep with three |

men capable of more than 22 feet.
Hopes of a similar triumph for the
Bears center in the javelin, but
Perelli-Minetti, who has been throw
ing around 175 feet, may disillusion
the Cubs.
Maynor Shove, freshman captain,
is conceded a first in the 440 because
of his 1928 mark of 50 4-5 seconds.
Against stiff opposition Shove should
be able to break 50 seconds. Bob
Brown should have little trouble win
ning the two-mile with Bob Filley a
possible second.
