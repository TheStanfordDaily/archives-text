# FRANCE, WORLD PEACE WILL BE SUBJECT OF U.C. DEBATE TUESDAY
## 
### 
"France and World Peace" will be
the general topic of the annual
M6daille Joffre Debate which will be
held between Stanford and California
Tuesday night at Wheeler Auditorium,
Berkeley.
Philip Cavalero, Herbert Wenig,
and Robert Hume will speak for Stan
ford. Under the arrangements made
for the debate only two speakers from
one school will be on each team and
the third will be exchanged. The
award is made to the best speaker
regardless of the showing of the other
two men on the team.
Only the general topic is announced
to the debaters until two hours be
fore the debate when a specific topic,
usually in the form of a resolution
for debate, is announced. The topic
for Tuesday night will be chosen by
Charles E. Martin, Dean of the Col
lege of Social Sciences at the Univer
sity of Washington and writer on so
cial science topics.
The origin of the Joffre Medal De
bate is an interesting one. Thirty-five
years ago, Baron Pierre de Coubertin
offered, in honor of Sadi Carnot, mar
tyred President of France, an award
known as the Carnot Medal which
was to be presented to the Stanford
or California speaker making the best
individual showing in an annual for
ensic contest to be hold between the
two universities. In 1017 the award
was changed to the Joffre Medal in
honor of the great Marshal of France.
