# INDIVIDUALS OF VISITING TRACK TEAM THREATEN
## Stanford Sure of Victory in Tomorrow's Clash With Southerners Sprints, Half, Mile, Relay Are Strongest Events of All-Stars 
### Bob Speers 
While chances of a Stanford defeat
seem almost too small to be men
tioned, Dink Templeton's Cards will
be given some competition when the
All-Southern Conference track and
field team faces them in the Stadium
at 2:30 o'clock tomorrow.
The twenty-six visitors do not
represent sufficient power as a team
to endanger the Cardinals, but several
j individual .performers promise to be
strong enough, and should extend
some of Templeton's athletes to the
limit.
Sprints To Be Close
Whittier's sprinter, Pendleton, has
covered the century in 10 flat and the
220 in 22 flat, with Ruth of Occi
dental doing practically as well, so
I Johnny Launtzen must exhibit some
fast running tc finish in the money.
In the mile McKinnon and Gooden
| will find competition in Goodlieart
and Brown, of Occidental and San
I Diego respectively. Goodheart has
I done 4:33 and Brown 4:32.
Pole Vault Strong
i Jenson, Occidental vaulter, has
cleared the bar at 13 feet 1 inch this
year, and is generally thought to be
capable of a better performance. He
; may be the required incentive that
Edmonds needs to clear 14 feet 2
ifiches.
The half-mile will probably be one
of the closest races of the day with
McGuire, of Stanford, and his Occi
dental opponents, Goodheart and Ap
pleton, all covering that distance in
i about two minutes.
Relay Will Feature
Then to top off the day's program,
a close battle seems likely in the
relay. The All-Star quartet is made
up of men who have all run the 440
in less than 50 seconds, and whose
aggregate time is impressive enough
I to cause the Card baton carriers some
i worry.
