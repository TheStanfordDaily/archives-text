"So we suggest co-education —if any—for women, l'or men, four
years among men." This is the conclusion of an editorial in the Chicago
Tribune, referring to colleges. On first glance one is inclined to give a
hearty guffaw, but it was really intended to mean something. Ihe frib
une bases its contention for co-education for women on the principle that
women mature two or three years earlier than men, and can use the
college as a happy hunting ground for husbands; men aren't a distraction,
but the main objective, and that they pursue their advantage, is shown
by the many college romances.
For the men, it is suggested they should go to a university where
only men are allowed, because women do distract them. After graduation
from high school they are still in the horse-play stage of adolescence, and
need to ease growing pains with rough sports. They are still in the learn
ing, and making, and collecting period.
This editorial, we suspect, was the result of inspiration from Knute
Rockne's statement that the success of his football teams was caused by
the lack of women at Notre Dame. Now, from the famous coach's point
of view, his contention is right. But he has limited it to football success.
When it comes to making a general assertion that co-education is bad
for men merely because it may detract from putting out good football
teams, it is bad logic. .
All men in college aren't interested in being better football players —
they are interested in being better men. Taking it for granted that college
freshmen are in the horse-play stage and need rough-and-tumble anti
dotes for their growing pains, does this mean necessarily that they should
grow into sober, finished products before they associate with women?
It is silly. A man isn't a well-turned individual if he hasn't learned to
be with women, naturally and as a matter of course. It is much better for
him to become thus acquainted during his college days than to have to
adjust himself after he is out trying to conquer the world.
To say that a college man is STILL in the "learning, and making, and
collecting" stage is pure rot. Every man worth the name is ALWAYS in
this stage. One who ceases to learn, or to make, or to collect, ceases to
live. And again to call the contacts of co-education natural to women,
but unnatural to men, is fallacious. Look around a college and you will
find a few of the male sex who shy a mile from the girls, and you will
also find the opposite true, that the girls (a few of them) try to be as
inconspicuous as possible in the presence of men.
Of course the girls distract college men, but so are the women dis
tracted. What does it matter? People have to get used to distractions
of many kinds. If life is a game, and women are a part of man's life
(which they are), then, like golf or bridge, the younger he learns to play
the game, the better off he will be.

ing, and making, and collecting period.
This editorial, we suspect, was the result of inspiration from Knute
Rockne's statement that the success of his football teams was caused by
the lack of women at Notre Dame. Now, from the famous coach's point
of view, his contention is right. But he has limited it to football success.
When it comes to making a general assertion that co-education is bad
for men merely because it may detract from putting out good football
teams, it is bad logic. .
All men in college aren't interested in being better football players —
they are interested in being better men. Taking it for granted that college
freshmen are in the horse-play stage and need rough-and-tumble anti
dotes for their growing pains, does this mean necessarily that they should
grow into sober, finished products before they associate with women?
It is silly. A man isn't a well-turned individual if he hasn't learned to
be with women, naturally and as a matter of course. It is much better for
him to become thus acquainted during his college days than to have to
adjust himself after he is out trying to conquer the world.
To say that a college man is STILL in the "learning, and making, and
collecting" stage is pure rot. Every man worth the name is ALWAYS in
this stage. One who ceases to learn, or to make, or to collect, ceases to
live. And again to call the contacts of co-education natural to women,
but unnatural to men, is fallacious. Look around a college and you will
find a few of the male sex who shy a mile from the girls, and you will
also find the opposite true, that the girls (a few of them) try to be as
inconspicuous as possible in the presence of men.
Of course the girls distract college men, but so are the women dis
tracted. What does it matter? People have to get used to distractions
of many kinds. If life is a game, and women are a part of man's life
(which they are), then, like golf or bridge, the younger he learns to play
the game, the better off he will be.
"So we suggest co-education —if any—for women, l'or men, four
years among men." This is the conclusion of an editorial in the Chicago
Tribune, referring to colleges. On first glance one is inclined to give a
hearty guffaw, but it was really intended to mean something. Ihe frib
une bases its contention for co-education for women on the principle that
women mature two or three years earlier than men, and can use the
college as a happy hunting ground for husbands; men aren't a distraction,
but the main objective, and that they pursue their advantage, is shown
by the many college romances.
For the men, it is suggested they should go to a university where
only men are allowed, because women do distract them. After graduation
from high school they are still in the horse-play stage of adolescence, and
need to ease growing pains with rough sports. They are still in the learn
ing, and making, and collecting period.
