# Another One Out

### 
Another college professor breaks out with a rash scheme to eliminate
loafers in the universities. l~le says that if tuition is made commensu
rate with the cost of putting the student through school, then the student
will knuckle down and dig into the hooks in a fashion well-nigh amazing.
This is wrong. The major premise is wrong, and so are all the little
minors.
Years ago it was the custom to pay for education by means of tuition,
but practically nowhere is that the case now. This meant that wealthy
people only could attend. It is not an aristocracy of dollars that modern
educators want, but an aristocracy of intelligence. So do we all.
What proof is there that mere payment of two thousand dollars in
stead of two hundred will decrease loafing in college? Rather it would
seem to point toward the opposite result. While it is not true in all cases,
it has been shown by many figures and compilations that the students who
work hardest in college are those who have barely enough money to get
by on. Having to pay the full cost would nearly obviate the possibility
of a higher education for them. They could not work and earn enough,
and by the time they had amassed a sufficient amount by working con
stantly they would have passed the time when college is of the most
benefit.
What is there to show that the student who can spend only two
hundred dollars is of less benefit to the state than one paying two thou
sand? Nothing. This fact cannot be determined until the man has either
proved or disproved his value, and it is only by giving full opportunity
to potential ability that we can ever discover it.
