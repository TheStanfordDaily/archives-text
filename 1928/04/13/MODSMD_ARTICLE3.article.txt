# Euphronia Upholds Fraternity Life In Contest With U.C.
## 
### 
In a no-decision debate against the
team of the Ccnturiata Society of the
University of California, Euphronia
last night defended the existence of
fraternities on the campuses of Cali
fornia and Stanford before a large
audience in the lobby of the Old
Union.
The main contentions of the visit
ing debaters as set down by Donald
R. Cauglie, first speaker for the af
firmative, were that fraternities bring
about the moral decay of the mem
bers, lower American political and
social standards, and destroy effi
ciency of the university and are con
trary to its aims.
Leon Carley, first Stanford speaker,
brought up the question of how the
men turned out of the fraternities
would be housed so that the existing
evils of fraternities would be done
away with.
Louis Mercado and Wagner d'Ales
sio, the other two Euphronia men,
centered their arguments on a com
parison of hall and fraternity men and
on the benefits derived from the lat
ter form of housing.
The second and third debaters for
the affirmative were Louis J. Kroeger
and Harold Svendsgaard. Following
the debate questions from the audi
ence were discussed and answered.
