OUTLAWING THE SNOWBALL
Snowballing is now illegal in Los
Angeles County. The announcement
comes just in time to restock the well
worn supply of Los Angeles jokes.
On the surface the idea of sunny
Southern California outlawing snow
balls is rather funny, but anyone who
has gone up in the mountains there
after a winter's storm can well appre
ciate the sagacity of the move. The
first week-end after a heavy snowfall
truckloads of picnickers with more
muscles and energy than brains in
vade the,mountain resorts. For them,
snow has but one use: to make snow
balls to throw at somebody. The re
sult is cracked windshields, cracked
heads, or both.

la Berlin a bobbed-haired girl of
twenty holds up the jail and escapes
with her sweetheart, under arrest on
a charge of high treason.
Someone should tell her that it isn't
stylish for bandits to have bobbed
hair just now.
If the world was populated with
Jersey City cigar store owners of the
stamp of Peter Bedrick, courtesy,
honesty, and kindred virtues could
be expected to disappear. Bedrick
lost $50, which was found and re
turned by a young boy. Bedrick, by
way of appreciation, gave the chap
five cents.
If the recipient of his huge favor
develops "sophomoric cynicism" pre
maturely, he may be excused.
