"Clowning Through Life," by Eddie
Foy and Alwin F. Harlow. E. P.
Dutton & Co.
This is the most thoroughly amus
ing and genuine book that has come
to our attention for some time. It is
not only an entertaining biography of
an interesting person, but it is by far
the most readable account of the
sixties, seventies, and nineties of
America we have been through.
Eddie Foy was a great clown —per-
haps greatest to our fathers and
grandfathers than in our own mem
ory. He started out in Chicago, New
York, and then pioneered in the West
—from Leadeville, Tombstone, in Ari
zona, to San Francisco and Butte,
Montana. It seems that the honky
tonkies and concert halls of that
period were vastly more lively than
their equivalents today of the vaude
ville and stock companies. According
to Eddie Foy, there were clever end
men and beautiful girls, "I knew girls
who sang in such places who brought
their mothers with them every night
and who were as correct in their
demeanor as any church chorister."
With our local color, perhaps the
most amusing of all the book is the
account of San Francisco. "The bi
zarre, the richest merriest city on the

continent." "The city swarmed with
gold siLver millionaires, Pacific Rail
loacl millionaires, millionaires made
by sugar and goodness knows what
not." "No matter whether you bought
whiskey, wine, beer, a cigar, or a
package of cigarettes, the price was
a quarter, and the lunch went with it."
"You couldn't run a theatrical enter
prise in Frisco without serving drinks
on the floor. Why, even in the highest
class theatres and opera houses, the
elite had champagne sent into their
boxes from the bar which was a part
ol' every building." "The most famous
catchline ever written originated in
San Francisco," as part of a theatri
cal program explaining, as was the
custom, the play, " 'And the villain
still pursued her.'"
Then, besides this historical touch,
Eddie Foy's life was no mean one.
He is touchingly sweet and sentiment
al about each of his four wives, and
there were some thrilling incidents
with the gunmen in the early mining
camps on his repertoire. There are
pages in the book with a clear naivete
that you are stunned by until you
realize he is clowning again. In short,
it is a fascinating book. Would con
temporary life was as interesting, and
that Shaw had as good comedians in
his satires! Hallie Keating.
