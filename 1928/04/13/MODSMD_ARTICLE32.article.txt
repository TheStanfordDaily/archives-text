Dear Sally—
The oddest thing has happened. An |
old friend of mine, well anyway that
is to say I have known him some
place before although I can't remem
ber where, has asked me to go to an J
oddly legitimate production given by j
the English Club. I have just read an ;
advertisement about it, and the plot :
is centered on a perfectly beautiful
woman who lived sometime during
the vague middle ages. And there is p,
man in the story, and it seems that
they are both really quite famous.
So, like that odd girl in the news
paper who always reads up on the
"more or less details" of the story,
I thought I would do the same thing.
My dear, it's certainly been one reve
lation after another to me. I am be
ginning to regret not having taken
more history.
Well, it seems this Caesar person, i
who was the man in the case, was
quite old, that is to say he sort of
had a fatherly interest in Cleopatra
who was the queen of something or |
other. It appears she was one of these i
terribly vain women and before long |
Caesar fell desperately in love with J
her. As she had already poisoned ;
more than one man, I can't imagine a i
male like Caesar being infatuated
with that kind of a girl.
At this point someone is vaguely
murdered in Cleopatra's house and
Caesar sort of takes the hint and
leaves. But he simply couldn't get rid
of Cleopatra. She has herself wrapped
in a tiger skin rug and brought into
Caesar's presence, which was certain
ly rather daring or risque as someone
once said.
Anyway, this thing goes on for vol
umes and volumes and Caesar finally
gets killed, and then Mark Antony
falls in love with her. Hut everyone
ought to know how stories of this
kind end. Yours, Lewyse.
