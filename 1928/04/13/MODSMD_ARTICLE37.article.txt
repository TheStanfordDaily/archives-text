## ODE TO A KEY 
### Vern Cordry 
Two weeks are gone,
The same old grind,
I was going to study
But got behind.
Two weeks are gone,
And I don't rate.
I'll get some "D's" —
Good-bye Phi Bete!
Statistics show,
So some guys say,
A Phi Bete key
Keeps Poverty away.
Spring is here,
There's balm in the air
If I'm no Phi Bete —
I'm darned if I care!
—Little Archie Smith, '30.
