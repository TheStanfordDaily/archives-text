# FRESHMAN NINE LOSES 7 TO 3 IN FINAL TILT WITH BEAR YEARLINGS
## 
### John Isaacs 
BERKELEY, April 12— Failing to
hit when hits would count, the Stan
ford freshmen lost the second and
final game to California 7 to 3 here
today in the Little Big Series. The
third game, scheduled for next week,
is automatically cancelled.
Although the Redshirts were better
man-for-man in defense, the California
babes managed to pound out the runs
in nice little bunches that gave them
an easy victory. Loomis, Stanford
hurler, was hit mildly in the first,
second, and fifth innings, but was
lambasted all over the lot in the
sixth. Story, who went 011 the mound
at the start of the seventh, at least
kept the Bears scoreless.
Starting with Horner's homer in
the second, the Berkeley nine rested
easy throughout the game. In the
sixth inning they so completely found
Loomis* curves that four of them
crossed the plate. Fiedler got on base
after a horrible error at third. Durell
and Horner were put out, Maclean
was walked, giving Butler a chance
to single and scoring Fiedler. Bur
gett tripled, scoring Maclean and
Butler, and went home himself on
Silver's single. Freeman was put out.
Stanford's futile rally started in the
eighth, after two men were out.
Magee, who had been leading the
Card frosh all afternoon, walked.
Hardy doubled, to score Magee, but
Story fanned.
Horner, Bear pitcher, had Stanford
well under control, fanning the Card
hatters one-two-three in the sixth, sev
enth, and ninth innings.
Stanford 0 11 0 0 0 0 1 o—30 —3
California 11 0 0 1 4 0 0 *—7
