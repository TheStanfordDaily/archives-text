the Alpha Kappa Lambda men out in
every inning, allowing only one hit

five-inning game by a score of 15 to 0.

The closest game of the day was
that between Theta Xi and El Cuadro,
the former winning by the score of 12
to 6. The best feature of the game
was the pitching strength of both
teams, Domianchi, Theta Xi, fanning
14 and walking 5, and Ricklefs, El
Cuadro, fanning 10 and walking 1.
Poor fielding, however, accounted for
a good many runs during the contest.

game:

cisively defeated its opponent, the

two errors.
