# WHERE CAESAR CALLED ON CLEOPATRA
## 
### 
This little map shows what a grand
place Alexandria was in the days of
Caesar and Cleopatra. There was a
great deal of trade, as evidenced by
the heavily loaded liner to be noted
in the East Harbor. They had a li
brary, a theatre, a city hall, and al
most everything that little old New
York can boast, even to a bridge run
ning out to the favorite island. The
line in the foreground is of the city
hall; it formed on the left, according
to ancient tradition. The little paddle
like prominence just to the right of
the bridge represents the spring
board off which the pirates walked
their yictims, to be eaten by the enor
mous sea monsters seen gamboling
about back of the island of Pharos.
The little stretch of closed water be
tween the death-board and the ship
is the Royal Harbor, where every
thing was harbored, from kings to
other kinds of criminals. Finally, will
be noted a lighthouse in the distance.
This is not a lighthouse at all, but

the castle of Pharos where all the
social lights hung out. The sparkle
that you see coming from the top
most eminence is limelight. After cen
turies of investigation, it has been
impossible to discover what the
building is that the fish on the right
is about to engulf. It was rumored
that it is the first dance hall built on
a pier, but due to improper support
that theory seems to be excluded.
