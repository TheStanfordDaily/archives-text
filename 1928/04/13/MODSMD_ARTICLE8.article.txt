# SHAW'S 'CAESAR, CLEOPATRA' WILL BE PRESENTED TONIGHT
## This Production To Be One Of Most Pretentious Given on Campus Color, Impressiveness Mark Staging of Play; Sets Are Elaborate 
### Hubert Gagos 
Bringing to Stanford one of the
most ambitious productions in years,
George Barnard Sliaw's historical sa
tire, "Caesar and Cleopatra," will be
presented in the Assembly Hall at
8:15 o'clock tonight under the direc
tion of Miss Anna May Price.
Tonight's production has a diver
sity of attractions seldom found in a
single campus play—Shavian humor,
eight elaborate sets, colorful cos
tumes, and an unusually well-balanced
and well-cast dramatis personae.
Plenty of Action
"Caesar and Cleopatra" abounds in
action and surprise situations. Al
though the play follows the historical
account of Caesar in Egypt and is
played in costume, the lines and
humor are decidedly modern and
pregnant with characteristic Shavian
wit and satire.
Color and impressiveness mark the
staging of the play. Such scenes as
Caesar addressing the Sphinx in the
moonlight, Cleopatra in her boudoir,
and the Egyptian throne room are
masterpieces of stagecraft, executed
by Leslie Kiler, that will long be re
membered at Stanford.
Cast Experienced
Raymond Haizlip, as Caesar, Dor
othy Garner, as Cleopatra, and Jean
ette Owens, as Ftatateeta, share the
acting honors. The supporting cast
is composed of experienced players
who keep the action up at all times.
Seats will remain on sale until 4
o'clock this afternoon at the Old
Union or may be purchased at the
box office beginning at 7 o'clock. A
special block of roughs' seats will be
sold at the box office at fifty cents.
