# VARSITY TAKES 92-48 VICTORY IN EASY MEET
## Stanford Grabs Twelve Out Of Sixteen Firsts From Southern Stars Henry Coe Breaks Cardinal Record for Two-Mile in Local Stadium 
### 
Although Dink Templeton's track
and field outfit swamped the South
ern Conference All-Stars 92 to 48 Sat
urday, the Stanford athletes were
somewhat erratic in their perform
ance, and from a spectator's point of
view the meet fell little short of
being listless.
Twelve out of sixteen firsts went
to the Cards, who dropped only the
javelin, the 880, the 220, and tied
for a win in the century. The spear
tossing event was, by the way, some
what of a surprise, but can be ac
counted for by the fact that Bill
Sparling, Stanford ace, was out of
competition because of a sore shoul
der.
Henry Coe's 9:35 1-5 time in the
two-mile was a feature of the day.
Not only did the lanky distance star
make the best time ever turned in by
a Stanford runner in the local sta
dium for the eight laps, but also he
did the unusual stunt of breaking a
record with practically no competi- 1
tion to press him on. It isn't an easy
matter to keep covering ground at top I
speed in a position almost a half lap
ahead of the field.
A special feature, the 16-pound
hammer throw, was placed in the'
meet to give the boys a chance to
see just what they were capable of,
in view of the fact that the event is
one of those scheduled for the 1.C.-4A.
Casey Kazanjian won for Stanford j
with a toss of 142 feet 11 3-4 inches, j
hardly good enough for Eastern com- 1
petition.
The half-mile proved to be one of
the most interesting races of the day
with Goodheart, of Occidental, com- I
I ing through on the home stretch to
beat Tom McGuire out of a first. Mc-
Guire displayed plenty of punch, and
was barely defeated. If he continues
on the upward grade it seems prob
able that Stanford will cheat Cali
fornia out of one of the few firsts
tor which Christie hopes.
