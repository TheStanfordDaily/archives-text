# CARDINAL DEBATERS TO MEET WITH U. C. IN JOFFRE CONTEST
## Cavalero, Wenig, Hume Will Speak on World Peace For French Award 
### 
Stanford's varsity debaters will
meet California tomorrow night in a
forensic contest at Wheeler Audi
torium, Berkeley, on the subject of
"France and World Peace." The best
speaker of the evening will receive
the annual Joffre Medal award for
individual honors in debating.
The teams will be split so that only
two members from each school will
be on a side. Although the general
topic is known, the specific question
for debate will be taken from a
sealed envelope two hours before the
debate. This year the subject will be
chosen by Charles E. Martin, Dean of
the College of Social Sciences at the
University of Washington.
Philip Cavalero, Herbert Wenig,
and Robert Hume will be the Stan
ford entries in the contest. Cavalero
is a veteran on the varsity debate
squad. He has been on teams com
peting against California and U.S.C.
He was winner in the extemporane
ous speaking contest held during
spring vacation in which speakers
from all Pacific Coast colleges and
universities participated. Cavalero is
known as a good competitive speaker
and is expected to do well in the
Joffre debate which calls for practi
cally extemporaneous speaking.
Herbert Wenig, though only a
sophomore, is recognized as a finished
speaker. Pie was winner of both na
tional and international interscholas
tic oratorical contests while he was a
student at Hollywood High School,
and was prominent on the freshman
debate team at Stanford. He recently
debated in a varsity meet with the
College of the Pacific.
Robert Hume, another sophomore,
participated in the U.C. freshman de
bate last year and is a member of the
varsity squad this year.
