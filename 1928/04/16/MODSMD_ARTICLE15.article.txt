# Daily Will Sponsor Big Meet Dope Contest; Offers Munificent Prizes
## 
### 
Have you a flair for doping track i
meets?
The Daily cordially hopes you <
have, because tomorrow it will an- •
nounce generous prizes to be offered :
in the annual Big Meet Doping Con- i
test, which it sponsors each season, j
.All followers of the Stanford track
I varsity will be eligible to submit 1
| dope sheets, and they will be receiv- i
i able at the Daily office or by mail,
| Box 1014, up until Saturday noon, the
! day of the meet. Members of the var-
I sity squad are particularly desired!
to submit dope. No one on the Daily
staff will be eligible for a prize.
Since it is hardly predictable what
1 California will do in the meet Satur-
I day —whether it will score heavily or i
. whether Stanford will take 100 points
j—there is a fruitful margin uporv
1 which the dopester may encroach, j
j Scores submitted should be plainly,
indicated at the top of the dope sheet |
and the events listed in the following ,

manner: 100-yard dash —Lauritzen
(S) first; Ewing (C) second; Van
Gelder (C) third. The winner will be
whoever submits the correct or the
nearest correct point score. If more
than one submit the same score, e.g.,
92 to 39, the one who has doped the
individual place winners most nearly
correctly will receive the first prize,
and the other prizes will be distribu
ted accordingly.
The premiums to be offered will
be substantial and such as to call
torth a good many dope sheets. Wo
men will be especially encouraged to
dope the meet, for a special prize for
tlie most nearly correct dope submit
ted by a woman will be offered.
Make out your dope early and mail
it to the Managing Editor, Pox 1014,
or bring it to the Daily office. Each
day an attempt will be made to solicit
predictions of the score of the meet
I from the coaches and leading ath
| letes.
