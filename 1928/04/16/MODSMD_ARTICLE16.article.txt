# Varsity Net Men Hand Lacing To Fast U. C. Team
## Cardinals Retain Undisputed Lead in Local Division Championship Race 
### AL DENNY 
Following the annual California-
Stanford varsity tennis match,
John B. Wheatley was elected to
captain the Stanford team in
1929. He succeeds Alan Herring
ton, honorary captain for the pres
ent season and ranking varsity
player.

Winning all five matches, Stan
ford's varsity tennis team Saturday
handed California the soundest beat
ing ever given a Blue and Gold tennis
varsity since competition in the sport
between the two universities began.
Alan Herrington began the day for
the Cardinals by taking two straight
sets from "Bud" Hager, in each set
overcoming substantial leads of his
California opponent. Hager put up a
stubborn scrap but Herrington's su
perior all around ability accounted
for points when they were really
needed. The score was 6-4, 6-4.
John Wheatley repeated his win of
the Los Angeles four-way tournament
over Dick Hoogs in straight sets.
Hoogs started well, running up a 4-1
'ead. Whiteley became aroused at
this point. Coming into the net be
hind his forcing shots, he volleyed
(he returns for clean placements. He
took the first set at 6-4, and the sec
ond at 6-3.
Ralph McElvenny took the final
singles for Stanford from Martin
McKee, left-handed Bear loop artist,
6-3, 6-2. McKee lacked consistent
ground strokes, but he bothered Mc-
Elvenny considerably with trick
serves and heavily topped and undei*-
cut shots.
In the doubles, Herrington and
McElvenny won from Hoogs and
"Dusty" Rhoades 9-7, 6-1. The Calf
fornia pair played desperate tennis in
the first set, their effectiveness aided
by erratic playing by Stanford. The
closeness of the first set stimulated
the Cardinals and the final set werit
to them in fast order.
John Wheatley and Gomer Thomas
completed the California rout by tak
ing a three-set match from McKee
and Nebo Chasseur. The Cardinals
dropped the firsft set 6-8, but settled
down and shut out their opponents
in the next two, 6-3, 6-3.
By virtue of the California victory
Stanford now holds the undisputed
championship of the Southern Divi
sion of the Pacific Coast Conference.
The championship of the Coast will
be decided in Seattle in May. The
Cardinals are favorites to win the
title for the second consecutive time.
