HALIFAX, N.S., April 15—(U.P.) —
The Junkers monoplane Bremen,
which made the first westward flight
across the North Atlantic Ocean, will
not attempt a flight from Greenly
Island to New York, even if a fresh
fuel supply becomes available, accord
ing to a wireless message received
here today from Pt. Amour.
The message, which came from the
same radio operator who sent first
word of the forced landing Friday
night, stated that the German-Irish
crew had definitely decided not to at
tempt the flight due to the condition
of their plane, which apparently was
more seriously damaged in landing
than was at first believed.
