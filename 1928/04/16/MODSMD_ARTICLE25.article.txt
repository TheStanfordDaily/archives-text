track team took the annual "Little
Big Meet" from California for the
fifth consecutive time on the Califor
nia oval Friday afternoon. The final
score was 91 2-3 to 39 1-3.

during the 100- and 440-yard dashes
when California was allowed only
one point in each event. Throughout
the meet the Card frosli totaled 53
points to 24 for the Bears on the
track, and bettered Christie's outfit
by 23 1-3 points in the field events.
The most exceptional performance
of the, day was made by Hec Dyer,
Card sprint flash, who captured fif
teen points for high point honors and
tied the 100-yard dash record at 10
fiat. After winning first place in the
century, Dyer came back to nose out
A1 McDermott in the 220 and to win
the low sticks with little competition.
The only sweep of the day was
made by the Cardinals in the discus,
when Goldsmith threw the plate six
feet farther than he had ever done
before to nose out Norman McLeod
by a foot. Don Colvin won third
place. Burt DeGroot came through in
the pole vault to clear 11 feet 6 inches
and nose out the favorite, Reynolds
of California.
Captain Maynor Shove ran the
quarter in 51 2-5 seconds to win by
three yards. Bill Neikirk nosed out
Wright, Bear runner, by a final sprint
to capture second honors.

California squad, did honors for the
Blue and Gold in the mile and 880-
yard runs. After stepping off a mile
in the record time of 4 minutes 29 7-10
seconds, he came back to outsprint
Lane of Stanford in the shorter dis
tance. After leading in the mile for
more than two- laps, John Parker,
Card distance man, was defeated in a
fast final lap.
The javelin record of 173 feet *4
inch made by Rhighetti of Stanford
in 1922 was broken by Churchill of
California, who threw the spear 187
feet 11% inches. His teammate
Akers' toss of 180 feet lynches also
