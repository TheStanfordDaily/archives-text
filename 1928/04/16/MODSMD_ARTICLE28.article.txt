# That Assembly Hall
## 
### 
The reviewer of Friday night's play, "Caesar and Cleopatra, struck
a note when he quoted the body who said the Assembly Hall was a fine
place for Citizenship lectures. Certainly the ancient contraption is
fit for very little else. For one scene of four minutes' duration it took
fifteen minutes to prepare the set.
It is an old story to speak of the inadequacy of the stage equipment,
the lack of space, the crowded condition of dressing rooms, the freezing
atmosphere backstage, the hard seats in front, the awkward seating
arrangement in the balcony, the whole barn-like appearance of the place.
One is reminded of nothing when he enters the Hall. About the only
difference between the two is that in the old days the opera house used
candlesâ€”now we have electric lights.
Stanford has gained a national reputation in dramatics that is to be
envied by practically every other university in the country. It has also
gained a reputation in football, track, swimming, et al. We have a
fine stadium, splendid tennis equipment, and spacious glass cages with
smooth-topped desks for all coaches, clerks, and call boys who have
anything to do with athletics. Then we take a look at the big out-grown
structure which has to serve duty for a theater.
It is almost an insult to ask an artist to build sets, or a director to
put on plays, under such hopeless conditions. True, we have had sets
that were inspirations, nothing short; and we have had plays that keep
people coming to the campus year after year. But these facts are due to
the talent we have had. How much more could be accomplished in a
theater worthy of the name.
This University is situated in the very center of the most cultured
section of the Pacific Coast. If there were a playhouse with the proper
facilities, there would be no limit to the constructive dramatic work that
could be accomplished. If Stanford is interested in continuing a repu
tation of the right sort, a new theater is the thing that will do it.
