# The 						Controversy at Clark
## 
### 
During the past week a great deal has been sent over the wires re
garding some kind of a "situation at Clark University." Finally it is
discovered that the trouble is this: The editor of the Clark Monthly had a
playlet entitled "Bull Session" set up and ready to run. It was found and
brought to the attention of President Atwood, who notified the editor
and two associate editors of their dismissal. Immediately afterwards,
the president of the student body and two seniors who have earned high
rank in studies and respect from other students, resigned from the
university.
It seems the reason for the voluntary resignation of the latter trio
was that they felt President Atwood had violated the American prin
ciple of the right to fair hearing. Atwood had allowed the students
that he had already made up his mind that the article, which must be
involved no chance for defense. The editor of the magazine claimed
assumed to have been objectionable, was not to be published, and the
two associates had never even seen the copy. When a committee from
the student body undertook to offer to the president resolutions of con
fidence in the truth of the statements of the editors, in an effort to have
the expulsion reversed, they were, they claim, summarily refused a hear
ing with the words, "There's the door; get out!"
The men who resigned were under no compulsion whatever. Very
few college men, standing on the verge of graduation with honors, are
going to take such a step unless moved by pretty sound reason. It
was an unusual deed, and very likely caused by deep injustice to their
friends. Such an action as Atwood seems to have made should not
be countenanced in a college president. If the colleges are attempting
to train young men and women in the practice of fair play and the use
of calm, deliberate judgment, their presidents should confine themselves
to the same principles.
