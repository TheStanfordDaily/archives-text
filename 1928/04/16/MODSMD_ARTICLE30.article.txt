# Keep the Fount Open

A short letter in the Campus Opinion column today brings up a point
JHat has bothered a lot of us for a long time. The writer asks why
the library can't he left open until ten o'clock on Saturday and Sunday
nights. Well, why not? These nights are often about the only time
a great many people have in which to do that bit of extra work that
really counts towards getting an "A" or learning the things they are <
presonally interested in.
Perhaps the cost is too great for the number of students who would!
take advantage of such an increase in service. True, there is the mat-1
tcr of lights and library assistants. Rut it would seem that the cost of
operating eleven more hours a week could well be afforded, for the
students who would be working in those hours are the ones who are a |
benefit to the University. Such an expenditure couldn't be a waste of j
money.
