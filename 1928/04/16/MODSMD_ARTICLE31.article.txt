FLYING WESTWARD
The East-to-West air route across
the North Atlantic, after claiming so
many lives, has at last been con
quered, three intrepid flyers escaping
the fate of the others by a narrow
margin.
The brief history of transatlantic
flying is one of strange incident. Back
in 1919, almost ten years ago, the NC4,
flying for the American Navy, reached
England by way of the Azores. A
month or so later saw Commander
Grieve and Major Hawkers away
from St. Johns for England, only to
be forced down after flying a thou
sand miles. Fortunately for them a
Danish steamer was near at hand
when they came down.
A little later Captain John Alcock
and Lieut. Arthur Brown, flying a
Vickers Vimy bomber, made it from
St. Johns to Clifton, Ireland, a dis
tance of 1960 -niles, in 16 hours and
12 minutes, completing the first trans-

Atlantic non-stop flight. The same
summer saw the British dirigible, !
R-34, cross and recross the Atlantic.
The names of these pioneers have
been all but forgotten in the brilliant
revival of distance flying last summer, j
Almost even more forgotten is the j
remarkable American round-the-world
flight, made in 1924. Only a few thou- 1
sand were on hand to greet the flyers
when their air girdle of the earth
came to an end in Seattle. In the light
of the overwhelming ovations ac- |
corded the heroes of 1927, this indif
ference to a feat of equal or greater
glory is hard to understand.
Today, as the list of transatlantic
flight failures and successes grow
longer and longer, the achievements
of 1919 and 1924 become more and
more distinguished; and when one
considers the great improvements in
the science of flying and airplane
construction made since then, the
daring of those pioneers reaches to
the skies.
