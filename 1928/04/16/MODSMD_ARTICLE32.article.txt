"Boojum," by Charles Wertenbaker.
Boni & Liveright.
By careful count, in the first thirty
pages of this book exactly two and
one-half kegs of corn whiskey, one
quart of Scotch, one jar of miscel
laneous, and three indiscriminate
mixtures are consumed by the charac
ters. There are three hundred odd
pages of the novel, and the relative
wetness increases relatively, so you
know what sort of a book it is—one
of these pictures of college.
The adventures of Boojum ,a mor
bid younger brother, sort of a poet,
are traced through his career at this
mythical Southern University, and
until he reaches sweetness, light, and
maturity. Wertenbaker seems to
have had a good deal of fun writing
this. Fortunately he puts words of
explanation in the mouth of Boojum,
who explains, along toward the later
half of the book, that his life and
are a tremendous joke, and not
to be taken seriously.
It makes amusing reading, and a
good yarn, if you remember this rep
rimand carefully. The points we ob
ject to, however, are concerned with
the misrepresentation of college and
adolescent life. Of course, under the
circumstances, we only know from
hearsay the majority of the adven
tures of the young man about college,
and our experience is even more lim
ited and vicarious when it comes to
young men in Southern College. Now
Boojum is involved in countless bad
check episodes, he remains in a rosy
haze of intoxication most of the time,
and he has more than his share of
affairs. We can forgive misrepresen
tation of the college lads —but when
it is done on such a grand and mar
melous scale!
The general psychology of an ado- I

lescent is convincing as illustrated in
this young man, and if it weren't for
his unfortunate habit of always com
ing back after he has run away, we'd
even find him likable. We read the
book at one sitting, so you may gather
it is not dull. We feel very, very reti
cent about ever going out with an
other college man if it is true They
Are Like This.
In short, this is no kind of a book
for a member of a coeducational in
stitution to review. Either your opin
ion of your fellow comrades in gen
eral is embittered, or you can be
skeptical — and miserable because
there isn't a Boojum around this cam
pus.

it is not dull. We feel very, very reti
cent about ever going out with an
other college man if it is true They
Are Like This.
In short, this is no kind of a book
for a member of a coeducational in
stitution to review. Either your opin
ion of your fellow comrades in gen
eral is embittered, or you can be
skeptical — and miserable because
there isn't a Boojum around this cam
pus.
—Hallie Keating.
"Boojum," by Charles Wertenbaker.
Boni & Liveright.
By careful count, in the first thirty
pages of this book exactly two and
one-half kegs of corn whiskey, one
quart of Scotch, one jar of miscel
laneous, and three indiscriminate
mixtures are consumed by the charac
ters. There are three hundred odd
pages of the novel, and the relative
wetness increases relatively, so you
know what sort of a book it is—one
of these pictures of college.
The adventures of Boojum ,a mor
bid younger brother, sort of a poet,
are traced through his career at this
mythical Southern University, and
until he reaches sweetness, light, and
maturity. Wertenbaker seems to
have had a good deal of fun writing
this. Fortunately he puts words of
explanation in the mouth of Boojum,
who explains, along toward the later
half of the book, that his life and
are a tremendous joke, and not
to be taken seriously.
It makes amusing reading, and a
good yarn, if you remember this rep
rimand carefully. The points we ob
ject to, however, are concerned with
the misrepresentation of college and
adolescent life. Of course, under the
circumstances, we only know from
hearsay the majority of the adven
tures of the young man about college,
and our experience is even more lim
ited and vicarious when it comes to
young men in Southern College. Now
Boojum is involved in countless bad
check episodes, he remains in a rosy
haze of intoxication most of the time,
and he has more than his share of
affairs. We can forgive misrepresen
tation of the college lads —but when
it is done on such a grand and mar
melous scale!
The general psychology of an ado- I

lescent is convincing as illustrated in
this young man, and if it weren't for
his unfortunate habit of always com
ing back after he has run away, we'd
even find him likable. We read the
book at one sitting, so you may gather
it is not dull. We feel very, very reti
cent about ever going out with an
other college man if it is true They
Are Like This.
