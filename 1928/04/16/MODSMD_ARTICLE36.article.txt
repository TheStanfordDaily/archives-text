The Editor, Sir:
Why couldn't the library be open
until 10 o'clock on Saturday and Sun
day? There are many of us who do
not have the cash to step out over the
week-end, or who need the week-end
for catching up in our work. Perhaps
there are some who would like to
browse around and get acquainted
with a few of the books; wouldn't the
week-end suit this purpose admir
ably?
I suppose the objection might be
that there are students who work in
the library who would like to get off
once in awhile. This is a fair-enough
argument, but how about getting full
time workers if no students can be
found who are willing to work till 10?
â€”Not a Phi Bete.
