# BOARD OF GOVERNORS FORBIDS CARD GAMES IN LOBBIES OF UNIONS
## Men's Council Will Handle New Ruling Violations, Announces Culver 
### 
Another rendezvous of the Stan
ford "rough" is gone. No longer will
men gather in the lobby of the Old
Union for their rounds of bridge and
poker. The board of governors of
that building has decreed otherwise.
Even solitaire is forbidden.
The following edict has been is
sued: "Because of numerous com
plaints concerning gambling and ob
noxious conduct of groups of indi
viduals who habitually play cards in
the lobby of the Old Union, it is here
by declared that all card playing or
gambling is prohibited in the New or
Old Union." This regulation does not
apply, it is announced by officials, to
games which are conducted in connec
tion with social functions held there.
Any violation of the new rule will
be dealt with by the men's council,
it was stated yesterday by George B.
Culver, Dean of Men.
