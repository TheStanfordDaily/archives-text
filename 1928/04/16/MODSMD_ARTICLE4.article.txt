# California Downs Card Nine 2-1 In Close Tilt To Win Annual Series
## Gus Nemechek, Bear Pitcher, Strikes Out Seven Men, Allows Six Hits 
### 
Gus Nemechek, accorded strong
support in the batting department,
hurled his way to a close 2-1 victory
over Coach Harry Wolter's Stanford
varsity baseball nine Saturday after
! noon at West Field, Berkeley, to give
California the annual series, and to
record his fourth straight win in two
years over the Cards. The Bear
chucker struck out seven men and
allowed but six hits.
It was a pitchers' battle from start
to finish, with Nemechek having just
a little bit the edge, and was any
body's game until after the Cardinal
batters had been retired in the ninth.
Poor base-running by the Stanford
men probably cost them the game.
"Count" Sobieski was in the box
for Stanford, and twirled good ball,
though being touched for ten hits. He
was in a bad hole several times but
pulled out in nice fashion.
California's first score came in the
sixth when Captain Douthit, Bear
center fielder, singled, advanced to
third on Millett's double to right
field, and scored on Stevenson's sacri
fice fly. The next inning Wyatt
singled to center field, went to sec

Maurice's single.
Stanford surprised the more than
three thousand fans who witnessed
the game, in the seventh inning,
when, with two men out, Berg, play
ing left field in place of Jack Levin,
scored the Cardinals' only tally. Berg
reached first on an error by the Cali
fornia third baseman, stole second,
and scored on Sobieski's drive down ;
the third base line.
The third game of the series will;
