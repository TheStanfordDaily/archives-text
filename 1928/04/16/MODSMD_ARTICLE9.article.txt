# Success Of Shaw Comedy Dimmed By Extreme Length Of Production
## Dorothy Gamier, Raymond Haizlip Are Convincing In Leading Roles 
### Winston Norman 
George Bernard Shaw's "Caesar
and Cleopatra," presented in the in
evitable Assembly Hall Friday night
before a poor house, was much too
ornate for campus production, but
well done in spite of tiresome length.
Dorothy Gornier as Cleopatra and
Raymond Haizlip as Caesar formed an
able team. Miss Garnier's perform
ance was outstanding. She played the
ingenuous 16-year-old Queen of Rgypt
expertly and with fair consistency,
making a desirable Titian - haired
charmer. Haizlip, of excellent voice,
gave a pleasing interpretation of the
wistful conqueror of the world, too
wise and too old, intrigued by Cleo
patra, quick to forget her.
Robert Cathcart as Rufio, tough
liombre and loyal field marshal to
Caesar, was very natural and most
entertaining. Jeanette Owens' por
trayal of the unpronounceable Ftata
teeta, mistress of the Queen's house
hold, divided opinion, for though
manner and makeup were x very good,
her voice was harsh instead of tense.
She stabbed Lynn Bramkamp, the
sturdy Pothinus, which was a shame,
as he was doing very well.
Ptolemy, the Penrod King of Egypt,
was nicely handled by Maurice Power.
Herbert Foxworthy was fair as Ptol
emy's ancient tutor, Theodotus. So
were Douglas Gregg and Alfred Leon
hardt, Britannus and Septimius re
apectively. Silas Prime, who was
Apollodorus, a Sicilian aesthete, ap
peared in Act 111 while the others
were getting their second wind and,
with good voice and fine stage pres
ence, carried the act. So much for
the cast, too large to enumerate.
Applause greeted the setting for
Scene 2 of the first act, which was
a happy achievement by the Kiler
family. With such auspicious intro
duction, Miss Gamier and Haizlip
brought the play to its highest point
with an amusing dialogue, sustained
it in the next scene, and into Act 11,
the best of the performance. But this
left three acts to go, and everyone,
the audience included, was worn out
at the end of the total playing time:
«{ hours, 15 minutes.
The Shaw play, in five acts and nine
innings, was an unfortunate choice.
A visiting statistician recorded times
i'or the 8 scene changes, which ranged
from 8 to 15 minutes and totaled 1
hour, 20 minutes. The audience,
squirming in the odd Assembly Hall
seats, felt that no play, however in
tense (and this one was not) could
overcome such handicap. "Caesar and
Cleopatra" was a good vehicle for
Shaw's epigrammatic wit, but a spec
tacle which overtaxed Stanford's
stage facilities and served to justify
a member of the audience who, upon
leaving, remarked that the Assembly
Hall is an excellent place for Citizen
ship lectures.
Students at the University of Mon
tana, upon being questioned, nearly
all agreed on green for the "shade of
the season."

were Douglas Gregg and Alfred Leon
hardt, Britannus and Septimius re
apectively. Silas Prime, who was
Apollodorus, a Sicilian aesthete, ap
peared in Act 111 while the others
were getting their second wind and,
with good voice and fine stage pres
ence, carried the act. So much for
the cast, too large to enumerate.
Applause greeted the setting for
Scene 2 of the first act, which was
a happy achievement by the Kiler
family. With such auspicious intro
duction, Miss Gamier and Haizlip
brought the play to its highest point
with an amusing dialogue, sustained
it in the next scene, and into Act 11,
the best of the performance. But this
left three acts to go, and everyone,
the audience included, was worn out
at the end of the total playing time:
«{ hours, 15 minutes.
The Shaw play, in five acts and nine
innings, was an unfortunate choice.
A visiting statistician recorded times
i'or the 8 scene changes, which ranged
from 8 to 15 minutes and totaled 1
hour, 20 minutes. The audience,
squirming in the odd Assembly Hall
seats, felt that no play, however in
tense (and this one was not) could
overcome such handicap. "Caesar and
Cleopatra" was a good vehicle for
Shaw's epigrammatic wit, but a spec
tacle which overtaxed Stanford's
stage facilities and served to justify
a member of the audience who, upon
leaving, remarked that the Assembly
Hall is an excellent place for Citizen
ship lectures.
Students at the University of Mon
tana, upon being questioned, nearly
all agreed on green for the "shade of
the season."
George Bernard Shaw's "Caesar
and Cleopatra," presented in the in
evitable Assembly Hall Friday night
before a poor house, was much too
ornate for campus production, but
well done in spite of tiresome length.
Dorothy Gornier as Cleopatra and
Raymond Haizlip as Caesar formed an
able team. Miss Garnier's perform
ance was outstanding. She played the
ingenuous 16-year-old Queen of Rgypt
expertly and with fair consistency,
making a desirable Titian - haired
charmer. Haizlip, of excellent voice,
gave a pleasing interpretation of the
wistful conqueror of the world, too
wise and too old, intrigued by Cleo
patra, quick to forget her.
Robert Cathcart as Rufio, tough
liombre and loyal field marshal to
Caesar, was very natural and most
entertaining. Jeanette Owens' por
trayal of the unpronounceable Ftata
teeta, mistress of the Queen's house
hold, divided opinion, for though
manner and makeup were x very good,
her voice was harsh instead of tense.
She stabbed Lynn Bramkamp, the
sturdy Pothinus, which was a shame,
as he was doing very well.
Ptolemy, the Penrod King of Egypt,
was nicely handled by Maurice Power.
Herbert Foxworthy was fair as Ptol
emy's ancient tutor, Theodotus. So
