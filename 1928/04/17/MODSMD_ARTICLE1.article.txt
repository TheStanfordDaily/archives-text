# IRISH AVIATOR ENDS ATLANTIC HOP IN CANADA
## Two Germans Brave Fierce Storm, Trying to Fix Ship for N.Y. Hop 'Duke' Schiller Fights Gale To Pick Up Fitzmaurice On Greenly Island 
### 
SEVEN ISLANDS, Quebec, Aprli 16.
—(U.P.) —One of the crew of the
transatlantic monoplane Bremen was
half way back to civilization tonight
while the other two —the Germans —
•stood by their plane on ice-bound
Greenly Island, off the Labrador
coast.
Commandant —or Major since Sun
day—James Fitzmaurice, of the Irish
Free State Air Force, arrived this
afternoon at Natashquan, on the St.
Lawrence river.
Schiller to Rescue
Duke Schiller, famous Canadian
pilot, flying in behalf of the North
American Newspaper Alliance, took
Fitzmaurice from Greenly Island at
10 A.M., today.
Hermann Koehl and Baron Guntlier
von Huenefeld, the German members
of the crew, are remaining with the
Bremen, watching to see that no
harm comes to her from the Arctic
weather which is having a bitter final
fling, and trying to repair her dam
aged tail-skid in hope that they can
fly her in triumph to Mitchel Field,
New York.
As late as 6 P.M., Sunday, a violent
Etorm was raging over the two-miles
by-one island which loomed like a
desert oasis out of a heavy fog. One
of the heaviest snows ever recorded,
even along the bleak Labrador coast,
was falling.
Flies Through Storm
It was through the western portion
of this storm area that Duke Schiller
flew Sunday to the rescue of the
Bremen's crew. He had left Natash
quan at noon and landed at Blanc
Sablon, on the coast opposite Greenly
Island, at 4:30. He remained over
night.
Schiller fought his way through
blinding snow and against a howling
head wind such as that which the
Bremen barely beat on her transatlan
tic flight. But he arrived without inci
dent.
It was impossible to try the return
journey last night and so he remained
at the scene. He had been prepared
to take off all of the Bremen's crew,
or two of thm at least. But Koehl and
Von Huenefeld refused in any cir
cumstances to leave their plane.

SEVEN ISLANDS, Quebec, Aprli 16.
—(U.P.) —One of the crew of the
transatlantic monoplane Bremen was
half way back to civilization tonight
while the other two —the Germans —
•stood by their plane on ice-bound
Greenly Island, off the Labrador
coast.
Commandant —or Major since Sun
day—James Fitzmaurice, of the Irish
Free State Air Force, arrived this
afternoon at Natashquan, on the St.
Lawrence river.
Schiller to Rescue
Duke Schiller, famous Canadian
pilot, flying in behalf of the North
American Newspaper Alliance, took
Fitzmaurice from Greenly Island at
10 A.M., today.
Hermann Koehl and Baron Guntlier
von Huenefeld, the German members
of the crew, are remaining with the
Bremen, watching to see that no
harm comes to her from the Arctic
weather which is having a bitter final
fling, and trying to repair her dam
aged tail-skid in hope that they can
fly her in triumph to Mitchel Field,
New York.
As late as 6 P.M., Sunday, a violent
Etorm was raging over the two-miles
by-one island which loomed like a
desert oasis out of a heavy fog. One
of the heaviest snows ever recorded,
even along the bleak Labrador coast,
was falling.
Flies Through Storm
It was through the western portion
of this storm area that Duke Schiller
flew Sunday to the rescue of the
Bremen's crew. He had left Natash
quan at noon and landed at Blanc
Sablon, on the coast opposite Greenly
Island, at 4:30. He remained over
night.
Schiller fought his way through
blinding snow and against a howling
head wind such as that which the
Bremen barely beat on her transatlan
tic flight. But he arrived without inci
dent.
It was impossible to try the return
journey last night and so he remained
at the scene. He had been prepared
to take off all of the Bremen's crew,
or two of thm at least. But Koehl and
Von Huenefeld refused in any cir
cumstances to leave their plane.
