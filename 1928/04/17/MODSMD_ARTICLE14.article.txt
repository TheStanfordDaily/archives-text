## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 16. —
(U.P.) —President Coolidge made a veiled
attack against governmental participation
in private business, such as is proposed in
the McNary-Haugen farm relief bill, in
an address tonight before the Daughters
of the American Revolution convention.
All mention of the D.A.R. public
speakers' "black list" was avoided at the
convention today although opponents of
the list and of Secretary of the Navy
Wilbur's original navy program were
working quietly to inject a resolution
which might precipitate an open fight in
the society.
Leaders of the patriotic congress were
confident of their ability to "sidetrack"
efforts to bring the "black list" into con
vention debates.
Frederick J. Libby, executive secretary
for the National Council for Prevention
of War, and one of the speakers con
demned by the society, was refused ad
mission to the convention. He was told
lie "had no invitation" and was barred at
the doors of the convention hall.
With the exception of the President's
address, preparedness was the keynote of
the convention.
But Mr. Coolidge steered clear of all
discussion on the military. His talk was
devoted to better citizenship and better
government.
"We have built our institutions around
the rights of the individual," the Presi
dent said. "We believe he will be better
off if he looks after himself. We believe
that the municipality, the state, and the
nation will each be better off if they look
after themselves.
"If it is desirable to keep the govern
ment unencumbered and clean, with an
eye single to public service, we shall
leave the conduct of our private business
with the individual, where it belongs, and
not undertake to unload it on the govern
ment."
