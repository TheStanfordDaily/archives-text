# Baumgardt Gives Illustrated Talk On Stars Tonight
## Slides Present Remarkable Celestial Photographs; Lecture Popular 
### 
"An Evening with the Stars," an
illustrated lecture given by B. R.
Baumgardt more than a thousand
times, is the topic for the Tuesday
evening lecture tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the Little Theatre.
The lecture, revised and kept up to
date, abreast with the most recent
explorations of the starry universe,
serves as an introduction to the study
of the heavens.
The remarkable achievements in
recent celestial photography * will be
revealed on the screen, and their
bearing on some of the greatest prob
lems that have yet engaged the atten
tion of thinking men will be interpre
ted in a popular and understandable
way.
Repeated visits to the leading astro
nomical observatories in this country
and Europe have resulted in an un
rivaled collection of celestial views
which form illustrations for Baum
gardt's lecture.
