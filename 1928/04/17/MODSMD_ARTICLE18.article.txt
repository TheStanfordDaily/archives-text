# JUNIOR COMMITTEE MAY ENGAGE PALACE ORCHESTRA FOR PROM
## 
### 
Likelihood was expressed yesterday
by Paul Herbold and Hub Moffatt of
the Junior Prom committee that Bill
Rawdin's Palace Hotel orchestra
would be selected to provide the
music for the festivities of the Class
of '29 on May 11.
During the past week the commit
tee interviewed the leaders of eleven
orchestras, but no definite choice was
made. Rumor has it that Earl Burtnett
of the Los Angeles Biltmore was
traveling north and would be avail
able lor engagements. However, after
telegraph communication with the
Los Angeles leader, the committee
learned that this rumor was errone
ous. Most hotel orchestra leaders are
prevented from accepting extra en
gagements because of Musician's
Union regulations.
Tickets for the Junior Prom are on
sale to those members of the class
who have paid their dues, or pay
them at the time of purchase, in the
Old Union from 1 to 4 o'clock all this
week.
