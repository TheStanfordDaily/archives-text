# Stanford Varsity Nine Meets Bruins In Third Game To Decide Series
## 
### 
After dropping three games in a
row, the Cardinal varsity baseball
nine will endeavor to break this los
ing streak when it meets the U.C.L.A.
Bruins here this afternoon at 3:30
o'clock on the varsity field in the
third and deciding game of the series.
Stanford won the first game from the
Bruins on the southern trip 12-7, and
lost the second 1-0.
The Cards have played fairly good
ball in the recent games with Califor
nia, but have displayed inability to
pound out very many safe hits. The
Stanford sluggers were able to touch
Gus Nemechek, Bear hurler, for but
nine safe blows in two games. "Red"
Berg, who has shown considerable
skill in handling a bat, will begin the
game today in left field, and should
do much to strengthen the Card
lineup.
Bob Philippi, who pitched winning
ball against the Bruins in Los An
geles in the first game of the series,
will start on the mound today. In
the opening game of the California
series Philippi relieved Lewis in the
fifth frame and hurled the remaining
five innings in big league form, al
lowing the heavy-hitting Bears but
one safe blow. Captain Cook Sypher
will do the receiving, and this battery
should prove effective against the
U.C.L.A. men.
Aside from their one victory over
Stanford, the Bruin nine has had a
poor season, losing all other games.
Stanford is now fourth in the Cali
fornia Collegiate Baseball Conference,
having won four games and lost six.
