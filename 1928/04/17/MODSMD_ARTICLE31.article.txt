The student is a baby; the student is in revolt; he is immoral, unmoral,
indifferent; he drinks gin and doesn't respect his superiors; the student
worships science and scorns religion; he is courageous, independent, quick
to think, keen. All these epithets, and more, have been applied, and are
being applied, to the "college student."
Just what kind of animal is this that has so many sides? In ancient
times, when men were hearty, one Hercules slew a many-headed serpent,
called the Hydra. But even Hercules would quail before such a being as
this much-maligned "college student."
One person, supposedly an authority, will make the statement that col
lege students are just a bunch of rah-rah boys and girls. Then another,
also supposedly an authority, will say the rah-rah stage is a fine thing for
adolescent youth and that there ought to be more of it, that the students
are too much fed up on Greek and seriousology. Then someone will be
moan the dearth of vocational courses the "c.s." takes, only to be met with
an assertion that the student is too much interested in such things, while he
should be developing his soul and mental powers on the Classics.
Such generalizations are all wrong; they are incoherent', irrational, mis
leading. In any college in the country one can find the individuals answer
ing to each particular type that is claimed for the whole, but it is an utter
fallacy to classify all students in one group. The very fact the disputants
have such a hard time maintaining their ground (which they don't) is
proof that no particular one is right. Of students in college there is just
as much variety in individuals as there is in a town or city, with the possible
exception of certain of the anent (imbecile, moron) classifications.
Perhaps the most generally accepted point of view is that students are
all rah-rah. Such an idea is gained from the publicity given to college
sports, glee clubs, comic magazines, dramatics, and the other activities
which, by their very nature, get into the newspapers. Then, too, cheap
motion picture concerns and magazines play upon the more spectacular
and least true of the activities in college.
The things that students think about, the topics they discuss with frank
ness and open-mindedness don't receive such publicity. This is natural,
for those thoughts are apt to be pretty conservative. But we mustn't make
generalizations. It can't be done.
