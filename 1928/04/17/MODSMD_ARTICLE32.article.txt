# One For Aesop

There is an old fairy tale in one of the books we read as children that
told of a father who said to his three sons as he was dying that there was
a great treasure buried in the soil of the orchard. The sons then began to
dig frantically all over the orchard, but not finding the gold they expected,
the two older sons gave up in disgust. The youngest, however, persevered,
and finally, on noticing that the constant digging had made the trees bloom
as never before, realized that the great abundance of fruit resulting from
cultivation was the treasure his father had in mind. The boy became
wealthy and wise.
Much like the old story we find that a couple of farmers down by San
Jose are trying to break the world's tractor endurance record. It seems
that someone in New Zealand made a dashing, non-stop flight over field
and furrow for nine consecutive days. The Battaglia boys now want to
make it ten days.
The establishing of such a record is a pretty futile gesture. But back
of the big tractor, the ground is being broken up and mulled over between
row after row of prune trees. Thus the try for the record will meet with
success, even though they reach but eight days and twenty-three hours.
