# Only Godliness Left

Tn the few years that the Encina dining halls have been in existence,
another tradition has sprung up that is now doomed to die an early death.
Freshmen and upper classmen alike have become accustomed to washing
their cars at the rear door of the kitchen. A hose was conveniently con
nected in the kitchen, and the tidy student could wash his car with either
hot or cold water.
Apparently an economy program has been launched by the manage
ment of the Encina dining halls, for the privilege of washing cars has
been taken away. The reason given is that the water bill was too much
last month.
With the necessity of hiring his car washed every time it gets dirty,
the average student is likely to neglect this tidiness entirely, with the
result that the cars will be fitting backgrounds for the dirty trousers that
have been the horror of so many observers on the campus this year.
