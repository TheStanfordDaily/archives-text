# Cards Taboo
## 
### 
Lobbies in dormitories are built especially for the men living in those
dormitories to enjoy. Such things as playing cards and chess, bull sessions,
etc., are the usual methods of enjoyment. But when the residents of the
hall abuse their privileges in the lobby, these diversions may be taken
away. The recent action of the Union Board of Governors, abolishing
card playing in the New and Old Unions, was the result of such abuse.
The regulation issued was that: "because of numerous complaints con
cerning gambling and obnoxious conduct of groups of individuals who
habitually play cards in the lobby of the Old Union, it is hereby declared
that all card playing or gambling is prohibited in the New or Old Union."
All violations of this ruling will be dealt with by Men's Council, says Dean
Culver.
