"The Man Who Conquered Death,"
Franz Werfel. Simon & Schuster.
On the surface this is a sordid tale,
but the main theme is a hopeful one.
Werfel shows here a deep conviction
in the inherent soundness of the hu
man character as such.
A man, just an ordinary man, finds
himself much down and out. His fam
ily is in want, and he can apparently
do nothing about it. But he finds a
way out. He decides to die so that
his family can collect his life insur
ance, the only way his pitiful savings
of Austrian marks can be worth any
thing.
Seeks Death
He must die from natural causes.
So be it, then, he goes out and col
lects sundry mortal diseases. As he
Is about to resign himself to death,
he finds that he must live until a cer
tain date. By sheer willpower, and
much against the professional judg
ment of his physicians, he fights off
death until the right time comes.
Werfel draws his characters very
well indeed, showing his hero sympa
thetically as a very remarkable per

son, covering up his extraordinary!
heroism so that the reader is not
struck by it for a long time, even as
the people who were about the man
in the story. The other figures in the
story are shown as people that one
might meet in any community where |
poverty was the order of the day.
Gloomy Strain
The gloomy post-war Austrian
touch is very evident in the book, yet
Werfel injects a fundamental optimis
tic brightness into the whole by the
very humanness of his characters.
They are quite blind, some of them, ;
but not unsympathetic.
The book is short, which we appre- '
ciated doubly because the author is
an Austrian, and we have been j
brought up to expect long-winded
works from such. Perhaps the brevity
is due to able condensation on the
part of the translators, Clifton P.
Fadiman and William A. Drake. Not
having seen the German original, we
do not know. At any rate, it makes
good reading, and doesn't take a great j
deal of time.
We recommend it. —AA.
