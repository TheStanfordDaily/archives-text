### Frederick Cromwell, '31 
"I was working the big guns over
in the Military Dept. today."
"Yes? Well, I was talking to the
Colonel myself."

Whether you are an ordinary ra- !
tional student, or on the Board of j
Athletic Control, or whatnot, we
lecommend the following:
TECHNIQUE
There was a man in our school
Who was so wondrous wise
When rushing season came around
He practiced telling
Jokes
*1
So that the boys in his house
Would have a lot of pull.
He also learned the wily trick
Of slinging lotsa
Gravy-dishes
Around so's not to spill them.
When a frosh piled up a slam
He gently closed his pearly teeth
And muttered
"Nicely played, old man."

MORE STATISTICS
If all the doughnuts served in the
Roost and the Cellar in one quarter
were placed in a stack, they would j
probably fall over.
If all the telephone calls made to j
Roble in one evening were stretched I
out into one conversation, the line
would be busy. -
If all the women's stockings on the
campus were laid end to end down
Palm Drive, there would be 1000 bare
legs.
If all the milkshakes served at the
Peninsula Dairy in a month were
dumped into a reservoir, it would be
very wasteful.
If all the syllabi distributed at
Stanford in one quarter were piled up
in the stadium, someone would prob
ably have the presence of mind to
set them on fire. —Betty, '31.

THE CELEBRITY
Ist Senior: I've been absent from
about thirteen classes so far this
quarter.
2nd egoist: Well, I see you've cut
quite a figure.
* * *
AND SO IT GOES
"I've just finished another book and
my hand was so nervous that I could
hardly write."
"Fine! I didn't know that you were
an author."
"Oh, it was a check book!"

Dear Ma and Pa:
This is fraternity rushing week at
Stanford and your son is being sought
by a house, the X.Y.Z.'s. They are a j
keen bunch of fellows and I like them.
I hinted gently, but still so that they'd
catch on, that I'd like to join their

house. Pretty clever, eh?
School is going along pretty well
and my grades are all right. My Eng
lish prof asked me a question today,
but quick as a flash I shot another
hack .at him, and he called on some
body else. That will show him I'm
not so dumb.
Your son, Al.
P.S.: My bank balance is $12 and
some odd cents.
"I was working the big guns over
in the Military Dept. today."
"Yes? Well, I was talking to the
Colonel myself."

There was a man in our school
Who was so wondrous wise
When rushing season came around
He practiced telling
Jokes

So that the boys in his house
Would have a lot of pull.
He also learned the wily trick
Of slinging lotsa
Gravy-dishes
Around so's not to spill them.
When a frosh piled up a slam
He gently closed his pearly teeth
And muttered
"Nicely played, old man."
