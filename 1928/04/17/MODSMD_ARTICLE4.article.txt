"Our aim is to make the Indian
I self-supporting and thereby to fit him
! for better citizenship," stated B. I.
' Staples, for many years a worker
among the Navajo Indians, in his lec
ture last night on "Indian Arts and
Crafts" in the Stanford Art Gallery.
"This can be accomplished by inter
esting the public in these works."
Mr. Staples is eminently well fitted
to give a lecture on this subject. He
is well-informed on Indian handicrafts
and personalities. He first visited the
Southwest for his health and became
interested in the work of the Nava
jos. He opened a school to teach the
young Indians the handicrafts of their
ancestors. In recognition of his ser
vices he was initiated into the Navajo
tribe.
Classifies Industries
In his lecture, Mr. Staples classified
the industries of the tribe into three,
sections-â€”weaving, pottery, and sand
painting. All of these arts date to pre
historic times. The first weaving was
done with feathers. The dyes were
obtained from the cochineal bugs and
from plants. Principal colors in Nava
jo work are grey, red, yellow, and
brown.
Mr. Staples continued with a discus
sion of the pottery industry and jewel
working. The Indians mine their own
turquoise and prepare their own sil
ver. Silver work is used mainly in
making forks and spoons, which sell
more readily than blankets and pot
tery.
Explains Sand-Painting
Sand-painting is not a commercial
art, but is connected with healing cere
monies, initiations, and religious fes
tivals. Colors are obtained from
ground rocks, and pictures are made
in the sand. These figures are ex
i tremely sacred.
An exhibition of Navajo blankets,
j potteries, and silverwofk is now be
j ing held in tlie Art Gallery.
