BERKELEY, April 15.—(P1P.) —
Street clothes will be worn by senior
women at the University of California
at the baccalaureate services this
year in place of the traditional caps
and gowns.

Women students at the University
of Texas are forbidden to have more
than three dancing dates a week.

Construction has begun on the now
$414,000 men's dormitory at Oregon
State College.
