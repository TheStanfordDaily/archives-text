# SPORTS OF 1928
## Court Battles 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
There are court battles —and court
battles. Last week-end, in Mexico
City, the United States Davis Cup
team eliminated their neighbors to
the south from further participation
in the 1928 race for the historic bowl
by trouncing the Mexican team five
matches to none in a very pleasant
and colorful series of court battles.
On or about April 16, Mr. Jack
Dempsey, who lost his title within a
week of the day Bill Tilden lost his,
meets his former pal and manager,
Jack Kearns, in a court battle to
decide whether or not the fighter
owes the manager an enormous sum
of money—something like $700,000
I believe.
Now Tilden, in a legal skirmish,
would be no more out of place than
Dempsey in a tennis court battle, but
it so happens that law suits, attach
ments, writs, and so forth are not
new to Colorado Jack, while Philadel
phia Bill, as far as I know has never
been served with a habeaus corpus,

but only a tennis ball and racket
However, if amateur tennis ever was
dragged into the legal courts, no such
disclosures and scandals would be
; forthcoming, as many people connec
ted with the cauliflower industry
seem to fear what may come to light
in connection with the Dempsey
Kearns court battle.
But to get back to more pleasant
subjects. In the Mexico City court
contests, two things were brought
cut. One, that Bill Tilden is a good
captain and leader and not an auto
| cratic czar, as some people seemed
!to think; two, that in John Hennes
! sey the United States has a player
j who will do a lot to take the place of
i Little Bill Johnston, and who, if he
doesn't burn himself out too soon,
may prove a thorn in the side of the
i Hennessey eliminated Cochet from
Frenchmen in Paris next summer.
J the United States national chain
; pionships last September—don't for
| get that in taking stock of our
| chances.
