(By the United Press)
That the Institute of Pacific Relations
may meet in Kyoto, Japan, in November J
of 1929 for its next conference was ex- j
pressed by President Ray Lyman Wilbur
of Stanford University, and chairman of
the Institute, to the United Press yester- j
day. Dr. Wilbur said that while final
action on the selection of the Japanese
city has not been made, he believed that
it would convene there.
The invitation was presented to the In-1
stitute by the Japanese consul at Honolulu
through J. Merle Davis, general secre- j
tary of the organization.
Regarding the Institute, President Wil-,
bur said: "The development of the Insti
tute shows a remarkable increase of inter
est of the countries of the Pacific in their j
mutual problems. The general desire of
the countries is to discover facts in regard |
to many different problems before them.
"The Institute is a fact-finding group
without political power or official posi
tions. Through joint activities of men of j
affairs, business men, scholars and publi- j
cists it is hoped that a better understand- j
ing among all the elements in the peoples
of the Pacific can be brought about."
