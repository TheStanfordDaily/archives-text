I Stanford poloists are fairly assured {
of having a return game with the j
University of Arizona four here dur
ing the latter part of the month, said
Polo Coach Lieutenant Whitmore
| yesterday. Stanford was beaten in the |
! first game with the Arizona team at I
i Tucson during vacation, but they
were playing under very unfamiliar
conditions.
The polo schedule also includes a;
| game with the Ninth Area Corps of
San Francisco, May 5, and the tourna- 1
ment at Oregon State, May 17-21, in j
| which Stanford, Oregon State, and
i two civilian teams will be entered. '
