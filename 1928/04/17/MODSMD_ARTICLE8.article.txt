# CONTINUE TRIALS FOR OPERA ROLES
## Tryouts Held in Afternoon, Evening; Men Needed For Chorus Work 
### 
Further tryouts for "Ticker Tape," the
Junior Opera, will be held in the Assem
bly Hall from 3 to 5 and from 8 to 10
o'clock today. Trials will be conducted
by Gregg Williamson, assistant to Miss
Price, Ted Duncan, musical director, and
Frances Boone, dance director.
Participation in "Caesar and Cleopatra"
will not disqualify students from appear
ing in the Junior Opera, since casting for
the Shaw play was done last quarter.
Men for chorus work are especially need
ed for the opera, Gregg Williamson an
nounced. Many students attended the first
meeting yesterday, but additional men and
women will be welcomed at the trials
today.
Names of students surviving the first
cut in cast will be published in the Daily
tomorrow.
