# PRESIDENT HITS SENATE FLOOD PROPOSITION
## Charges Lumber Companies Behind Objectionable Features of Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 17.— (U.P.)—
The Mississippi Flood bill, which the
Senate recently passed in ninety min
utes by a unanimous vote, came under
severe attack at the White House to
day as the most extortionate measure
within the knowledge of President
Coolidge.

It was charged that lumber com
panies were behind some of its most
objectionable features.

Just as the House was convening
to open debate, President Coolidge
made known his opposition to the bill
in more bitter terms than previously.
His views forecast a veto although
he has not announced his course.

It was said on his behalf that the
Senate bill would require an expendi
ture of $1,400,000 more than the origi
nal administration plan prepared by
General Jadwin, Chief of Army Engi
neers. The President believes this

boost is due largely to interested lum
ber companies who would profit by
flood control improvements and who
would receive damages from the Fed
eral Government as well. He doubts if
there ever was a proposal of such
extortionate nature before. He does
not think the Senate understood what
it was voting on as the bill went
through with practically no discus
sion.
