##

"We have been trying to teach peo
ple how to use their voices," said Lee
Emerson Bassett, professor of public
speaking here, in describing the work
of his department to the Mothers
Club yesterday. "The average student
is unable to make a written page clear

or interesting or even pleasant to
others," said Professor Bassett.

Courses in speech-making with the
purpose of training students so that
they can say what they wish to say
with force, clearness, and without
fear, work in debating, and dramatics

as well as reading aloud, are included
in the thirty courses given in the
public speaking department, Bassett
explained.
Mrs. E. E. Smith, chairman of the
Welfare Committee of the Mothers
Club, gave the annual report. Twenty
five hundred dollars less has been
earned by students working their way
through school than was earned last
year despite the fact that there are
more working. The reason seems to
be, according to Mrs. Smith, that stu
dents are too interested in getting
money rather than in doing their
work well.
