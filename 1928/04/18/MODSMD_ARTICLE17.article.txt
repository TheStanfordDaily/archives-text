# MEN'S COUNCIL MAKES STATEMENT OF HONOR CODE INTERPRETATION
## 
### 
Clarifying another point in the in
terpretation of the Honor System,
Men's Council yesterday issued the
following communication to the stu
dent body to explain application of
the code to reports and term papers.
Following is the statement:
"Unless express exceptions are
made by the professor the report is
expected to be entirely the original
work of the student. Any parts which
are copied from books, magazines, or
other manuscripts are expected to be
enclosed in quotation marks. A failure
to so acknowledge the writing as that
of another is not only a breach of the
Honor System but a violation of one
of the fundamental rules of English.
"The same rule applies to the
bibliography appended to any report.
The presence of the name of an arti
cle means that the student has read
that article prior to writing his re
port.
"The council considers the writing
of a report in violation of these rules
as a serious breach of the Honor Sys
tem and will punish it accordingly.
"Louis R. Vincenti, Chairman."
Three charges of violation of the
Honor System were dismissed, and
one student was penalized for the
breach. Fines for speeding and other
violations of the traffic regulations
totalled $53.
