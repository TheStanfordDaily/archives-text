Bruins enabled the Stanford varsity
baseball nine to wfn the third and'
deciding game of the series, 8-4, here
yesterday, and record its first victory
in three weeks. Six errors proved cost
ly to the Bruins and accounted for all
but two of the Cardinal tallies. Tha
game was slow throughout, and smart
baseball was not in evidence.
Philippi Looks Good
Bob Philippi turned in nine neat
innings on the mound for Stanford,
and was master of the situation in all
but the sixth when he walked Gra
ham to force in a run. However, in
this frame he retired three men by
the strike-out route to end the scor
ing. In all he fanned eight of the
Bruin batsmen.
Stanford's big inning was the fourth.
Three walks, two errors, and a single
resulted in four runs being chalked
to the Cardinals' credit. Their first

run was made in the opening inning,
and the second in the third chapter.
Two more scores in the ninth brought
(he total up to eight. In this inning
Maguire reached second on an error
j and crossed the plate when Berg
jingled to center field. Berg, in turn,
| reached home on Laird's double to
I left field.
Bruins Score in Third

Throe of the Bruin runs came in
the third. "Weazel" Wilson, U.C.L.A.
second baseman who had been walked,
went home on Gebauer's double.
| Woodruff, coming up next, hammered
j out a long one to left center field
