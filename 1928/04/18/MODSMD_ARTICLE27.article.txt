Definitions of the Honor System have been many, varied, and usually
misunderstood. The whole trouble has come in the fact that most people
have considered that it is a "system," as was pointed out some time ago
by the "Old Boy," on Chaparral's editorial page. It is hopeless to try to
define everything which might be a breach of the code, but it should be
sufficient to call attention to the fact that its key-word is HONOR.

Webster's New International says of honor, that it is "a sense of
what is right, just and true, with course of life correspondent thereto;
strict conformity to duty imposed by conscience, position or privilege."
Certainly everyone in Stanford University has some similiar inter
pretation of honor. How, then, can a student excuse something which he
knows, in his own conscience, is not right by saying he didn't know it was
a breach of the Honor System? It is merely an evasion.
Men's Council has brought up one point over which there has been
some controversy. According to a letter (published elsewhere in this
issue) from the Chairman of the Council to the Student Body, it is a
breach of the code sufficient to merit punishment, when a student copies
material from books or magazines without quoting or giving credit to the
source, or when one cites an article in a bibliography without having read
the article.
Surely no one could argue that such practices are in accord with
his ideas of what is right. It seems odd that the question should even
have come up.
