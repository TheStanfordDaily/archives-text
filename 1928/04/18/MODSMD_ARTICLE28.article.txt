# A 						Matter of Degree
## 
### 
A gentleman from North Dakota makes the suggestion that there
should he another degree added to the list already given by colleges. This
degree would he the Co. S. (College Student, or Collegiate Status), and
would be "conferred upon al land sundry who attend reputable institu
tions of learning of collegiate grade and who do pursue and actually
complete with intelligent appreciation and detectable results of culture or
vocational proficiency any course or courses whatsoever therein."
The proponent of this idea thinks it's great stuff. It would, he claims,
cause a great many more people to come to college for a little while and
think, and it would add to the gratification of those who go to college for
a period too short to obtain the customary A. B. or B. S. This is just the
trouble with such a plan; it would allow more people in college who
weren't there for any other purpose than to get the coveted "degree."
Even now such individuals are too numerous, and one of the biggest
problems in the universities is to get rid of the dead wood in order to
make a place for the students who are earnestly attempting to accomplish
something.

It is contended that the degree would be unique in that it would
"neither represent nor pretend to represent a like amount of work for

each and every student securing it." One might get it for a few weeks'
work in sociology, another for many terms of studying bacteriology, and
still another for a short attendance in a school of home economics. Well,
its pretty hard to find even the'A.B. degree that does anything more than
represent a certain number of units garnered, sometimes by real work,
and other times by such a modicum of work that a high school freshman
would be ashamed of the effort.

There are already too many useless degrees being h'anded out. What
is needed more than addition to their number, is some standardization of
degrees. Such a one as that outlined here would make it almost impossible
for anyone to obtain an idea of what amount of effort had been put
into its acquisition.
