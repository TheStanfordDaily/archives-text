"Modern fiction is the kind I do not care to read," says John Cotton
Dana, Librarian of the Newark Public Library, speaking with the
authority of one who has been selecting books for public libraries during
several decades. Necessarily, lie adds, his reading has been of reviews,
descriptive and critical, rather than of the books themselves. Ile has seen
the greater part of fiction hailed enthusiastically in the past fifty years,
only to sink into obscurity and oblivion, and has become disgusted. Now
he passes a blanket judgment of disapproval.
Perhaps he wants to play safe. It is often commendable to be
"ciitic;t4 of the liking of things and manners that are so loudly in
fashion". Put it is a false generalization to carry this to the point of
condemning all modern American novels as merely the outcome ot fash
ion and imitation.
It is only a truism to say that we are too close to judge contemporary
outpourings with the accuracy and perspective another half-hundred
years will bring. Put why shut one's eyes to the fact that during any
period of prolific creation, such as the present, novelists produce much
that is of enduring worth.
Actually, we need not rely entirely on the verdict of time. There
is no reason to deny honor to a book which deals well and honestly with a
problem entirely contemporary; it may have lost its point when the period
with which it deals has passed, but it can be relevant and valuable today.
