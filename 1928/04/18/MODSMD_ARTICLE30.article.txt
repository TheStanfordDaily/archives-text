## CLOSE SHAVES, AND OTHER INCIDENTS 
### 
This news is now of the dim past,
but because it is so funny it should
be chronicled for the benefit of future
generations of animal behaviorists. A
San Francisco account of the most
recent ill-fated sortie for the ever
absent Stanford Axe:
"University of California alumni
chortled with glee yesterday at the
news of the Stanford defeat. A deputy
superintendent of the San Francisco
schools laughed with a particular
'Yak-Yak-Yak.'"
Variations in barber shop eti
quette were noted in Arizona yes
terday, when Tontino Valenzuela,
barber at Chandler, Arizona, was
shot dead with a customer only
half-sliaved in the chair.
There should be a law against
that kind of a thing.
Prohibition up to the minute:
1. Local Federal officers visit Half

Moon Bay and "after an all-night
vigil" take "one of the largest hauls
of the season." The rum-runners "put
up a brief resistance" but a "ring of
cold steel" soon caused them to sur
render.
Bail was set at $5,000 each, which
"they promptly furnished." "A search
for the higher-ups" is being conducted.
2. In Los Angeles "two armed and
well-dressed young men" posing as
prohibition agents, force their way
into a "luxurious" home where a party
is in progress and make off with
$25,000 in jewelry.
Last week in Germany a man
swam around and around, finally
scoring forty-six hours in the
water to set a new record in
marathon swimming. For forty
two hours he was paced by a pet
sea-lion, but at that time the ani
mal refused to be longer intrigued
by offering of herrings and went
sound to sleep.
We give the credit to the sea
lion. —Jack Springer.
