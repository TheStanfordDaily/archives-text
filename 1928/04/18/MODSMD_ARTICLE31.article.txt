The strangest thing happened tc
me the other day, and I just loved it,

because things like that don't happen
.jvery day. You see, I was introduced
0 the most eruditious Phi Bete.
I mean, he really seemed to know
low to judge the right proportions,
nd he encouraged me. now that I
lave someone to look up to, to give
11 I can for his purpose. I sincerely
lope that I can study hard and learn
1 great deal.

Of course, I'm going to devote all my
'me, well, nearly all, to getting the
lost out of everything, because I
lon't want to have any ragged edges.
Ty Phi Bete told me that I must con
. cntrate on what I'm doing and not
ay any attention at all to anyone
ir anything that I may hear.

I really think he is quite right. I'm
"oing to be indignant if I'm advised
o be careful about working too hard,
because the more you do the easier

f is. Why just yesterday I spent the
whole afternoon with him, just read-1
ing the most divine poetry. And I j
have never been able to understand :
metry before. !
[ asked him about athletics, butNjie !
aid that exercise was for those who 1
ouldn't keep in training otherwise.
Tut he didn't seem to know anything
bout dieting, because he thinks about
•ery deep and serious subjects. I
mean, he can't be worried about
->very one.
I'm glad now that I have an incen
ive to help me appreciate college
"d its chances. And I do love intel
gent and subtle people. They make
no feel so deliciously excited and
iirious.

ion of supplementing the college
