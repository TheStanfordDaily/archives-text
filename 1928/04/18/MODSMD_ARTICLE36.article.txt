## 
### 
"There is no place where goodwill 1
is needed more than in the Near East
where lines of commerce cross, where !
Islam, Judaism, and Christianity over- J
lap, and where empires meet," de- |
clares Bayard Dodge, president of the
American University of Beirut, who
will discuss "Student Life in the
Levant" at 7:30 o'clock tonight in the !
Little Theatre.
"The Near East was so upset by j
the last war that it will continue to i
be a breeding place for new troubles |
unless there is reconstruction. During
the past year there has been a rebel- !
lion in Syria with a standstill of busi- |
ness. Egypt has suffered from a cot- '
ton crisis and Palestine from extreme j
economic depression.
"But what tliese backward coun-1
tries need more than money is a sup- j
ply of men and women with real goals j
and trained by scientific methods. It
is my fortune to work in an American i
institution that is manufacturing such
men and women," he says.
Dodge has been president of the
American University of Beirut since
1923, and in this capacity is influen- j
tial in Near Eastern countries. Dur- i
ing 1920-21 he served as director of j

the Near East Relief. Decorations
from the government of Syria have
been awarded him for his outstanding
1 services.
