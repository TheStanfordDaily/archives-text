# LEVANT STUDENT LIFE WILL BE SUBJECT OF BAYARD DODGE TALK
## 
### 
"There is no place where goodwill
is needed more than in the Near East
where lines of commerce cross, where
Islam, Judaism, and Christianity over-
lap, and where empires meet," de-
clares Bayard Dodge, president of the
American University of Beirut, who
will discuss "Student Life in the
Levant" at 7:30 o'clock tonight in the
Little Theatre.
"The Near East was so upset by
the last war that it will continue to
be a breeding place for new troubles
unless there is reconstruction. During
the past year there has been a rebel-
lion in Syria with a standstill of busi-
ness. Egypt has suffered from a cot-
ton crisis and Palestine from extreme
economic depression.
"But what these backward coun-
tries need more than money is a sup-
ply of men and women with real goals
and trained by scientific methods. It
is my fortune to work in an American
institution that is manufacturing such
men and women," he says.
Dodge has been president of the
American University of Beirut since
1923, and in this capacity is influen-
tial in Near Eastern countries. Dur-
ing 1920-21 he served as director of

the Near East Relief. Decorations
from the government of Syria have
been awarded him for his outstanding
1 services.
