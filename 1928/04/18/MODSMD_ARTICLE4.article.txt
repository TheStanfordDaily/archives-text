# DAMAGE BY EARTHQUAKE IS RECALLED ON ANNIVERSARY
## Financial Loss of Approximately $2,800,000 Was Caused By Temblor Which Shook Stanford Farm, Ruined Church, Destroyed Arch 
### Hammel McKay 
With a financial loss upwards of
$2,800,000, the death of two persons,
the destruction of some of Stanford's
finest buildings and certain famed
landmarks of that day as a few of
its immediate results, one of the
greatest earthquakes of modern times
shook the campus on April 18, twenty
two years ago today. Stories carried
by the Daily Palo Alto show that no
insurance was carried and although
it was the richest endowed institution
in America at that time, the Univer
sity was obliged to rely solely upon
the income derived from capital. As
no debt could be contracted under the
terms of the endowment, the Stanford
of today, rising from the disaster, is
the direct result of a rigid economiza
tion and efficient administration.
Church Damaged
The Memorial Church was one of
the buildings which suffered the
greatest damage. Prior to the earth-

quake it dominated the surrounding
buildings with its tall clock tower.
Due to the shock this fell forward
and crashed through the roof in frout
of the central dome. The force of the
impact loosened the mosaic, "The
Sermon on the Mount," and it was
buried beneath the debris upon the
pavement before the chapel. At the
time it was believed to be, together
with the many stained-glass windows,
a total loss.
Immediate reconstruction and re
pair of the Memorial Church was
given up and it was decided that it
must be left for several years before
sufficient funds would be available.
The Chapel was finally restored as it
now stands. The marble canopy above
the "Angel of Grief" was shattered
to bits but the statue itself was un
harmed.
Arch Destroyed
The great arch that once formed
the entrance to Memorial Court was
almost completely destroyed. Plans
for its reconstruction were made but
they never materialized. The library
and new gymnasium, which at that
time faced the chemistry building and
the museum, were also demolished.
These two represented the nearing
completion of the original building
plans as designed at the University's
founding. The best-known landmark
to be destroyed was the brick smoke
stack of the "farm." It fell with the
first temblor upon the power house,
totally destroying it. Roble Hall, now
Sequoia, suffered perhaps the least of
any structure on the campus.
David Starr Jordan, then president,
speaking of the terrible catastrophe
at the time, stated: "We have often
said that it is not buildings but men
that make a University. This is the
time for Stanford men to show that
this is true . . .
"It will doubtless be necessary at
Stanford to limit her entering class
next year, and to adopt a plan of fees,
not for tuition, which we hope will
always remain free, but adequate to
cover ... all merely administrative
work.
"But our great ambitions for Stan
ford must rest awhile —until we can
save money enough for building again
and until our own alumni are old
enough and rich enough to come to
our rescue."

this is true . . .
"It will doubtless be necessary at
Stanford to limit her entering class
next year, and to adopt a plan of fees,
not for tuition, which we hope will
always remain free, but adequate to
cover ... all merely administrative
work.
"But our great ambitions for Stan
ford must rest awhile —until we can
save money enough for building again
and until our own alumni are old
enough and rich enough to come to
our rescue."
With a financial loss upwards of
$2,800,000, the death of two persons,
the destruction of some of Stanford's
finest buildings and certain famed
landmarks of that day as a few of
its immediate results, one of the
greatest earthquakes of modern times
shook the campus on April 18, twenty
two years ago today. Stories carried
by the Daily Palo Alto show that no
insurance was carried and although
it was the richest endowed institution
in America at that time, the Univer
sity was obliged to rely solely upon
the income derived from capital. As
no debt could be contracted under the
terms of the endowment, the Stanford
of today, rising from the disaster, is
the direct result of a rigid economiza
tion and efficient administration.
Church Damaged
The Memorial Church was one of
the buildings which suffered the
greatest damage. Prior to the earth-

quake it dominated the surrounding
buildings with its tall clock tower.
Due to the shock this fell forward
and crashed through the roof in frout
of the central dome. The force of the
impact loosened the mosaic, "The
Sermon on the Mount," and it was
buried beneath the debris upon the
pavement before the chapel. At the
time it was believed to be, together
with the many stained-glass windows,
a total loss.
Immediate reconstruction and re
pair of the Memorial Church was
given up and it was decided that it
must be left for several years before
sufficient funds would be available.
The Chapel was finally restored as it
now stands. The marble canopy above
the "Angel of Grief" was shattered
to bits but the statue itself was un
harmed.
Arch Destroyed
The great arch that once formed
the entrance to Memorial Court was
almost completely destroyed. Plans
for its reconstruction were made but
they never materialized. The library
and new gymnasium, which at that
time faced the chemistry building and
the museum, were also demolished.
These two represented the nearing
completion of the original building
plans as designed at the University's
founding. The best-known landmark
to be destroyed was the brick smoke
stack of the "farm." It fell with the
first temblor upon the power house,
totally destroying it. Roble Hall, now
Sequoia, suffered perhaps the least of
any structure on the campus.
David Starr Jordan, then president,
speaking of the terrible catastrophe
at the time, stated: "We have often
said that it is not buildings but men
that make a University. This is the
time for Stanford men to show that
this is true . . .
"It will doubtless be necessary at
Stanford to limit her entering class
