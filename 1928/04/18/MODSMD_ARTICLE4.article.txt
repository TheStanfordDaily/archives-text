# DAMAGE BY EARTHQUAKE IS RECALLED ON ANNIVERSARY
## Financial Loss of Approximately $2,800,000 Was Caused By Temblor Which Shook Stanford Farm, Ruined Church, Destroyed Arch

With a financial loss upwards of
$2,800,000, the death of two persons,
the destruction of some of Stanford's
finest buildings and certain famed
landmarks of that day as a few of
its immediate results, one of the
greatest earthquakes of modern times
shook the campus on April 18, twenty
two years ago today. Stories carried
by the Daily Palo Alto show that no
insurance was carried and although
it was the richest endowed institution
in America at that time, the Univer

Church Damaged
The Memorial Church was one of
the buildings which suffered the
greatest damage. Prior to the earth-

quake it dominated the surrounding
buildings with its tall clock tower.
Due to the shock this fell forward
and crashed through the roof in frout
of the central dome. The force of the
impact loosened the mosaic, "The
Sermon on the Mount," and it was
buried beneath the debris upon the
pavement before the chapel. At the
time it was believed to be, together
with the many stained-glass windows,
a total loss.

given up and it was decided that it
must be left for several years before
sufficient funds would be available.
The Chapel was finally restored as it
now stands. The marble canopy above
the "Angel of Grief" was shattered
to bits but the statue itself was un
harmed.
