# Handy Andy

### 
When Rogers Hornsby was traded
to Boston, speculation was rife as to
who would play second base for the

Giants in 1928. McGraw opened the
training season with Andy Cohen,
young Jewish star, who had had such
a successful season with Buffalo of
the International League, in 1927.
Andy immediately showed himself to

be such a handy man about the key-

stone sack, and evinced such a keen
desire to learn and so fine a tempera
ment, that he caused many a sports
writer and many an old-time player
to say or write words of praise about
him

What pleased McGraw most of all,
probably, about Cohen's work at
Augusta, was his increased confidence
over 1926, when he was up for a trial
with the Giants, and his serious study
and application to his job at hand.
Andy asked much inside dope on the
intricate business of batting and
fielding from Ty Cobb and Hans Lo
bert, and learned many helpful things
from each of these grand old veterans.

Andy Cohen was born in a baseball
town, Buffalo, on October 25, 1904.
Babe Ruth was born there and Wil
bert Robinson lived there. The Cohen
family soon moved to Texas, the
home of the "great Hornsby, whose
shoes Andy is now trying to fill. Later
on this studious young Jewish boy
went to the University of Alabama,
where lie starred in sports. Alabama
has sent many ball players to the

major leagues—Joe and Luke Sewell,
for instance —and Andy learned his
baseball well there.

In appearance Cohen resembles
Dan Mendoza, greatest of Jewish
prizefighters. He has a hooked nose,
high cheek bones, piercing black eyes,
and black hair. More important, he is
fast on his feet, and blessed with a
nimble brain.
