# ASSISTANT LIBRARIAN ANSWERS TO QUERIES ON HOURS FOR STUDY

"The library tries to be open at the
times that it can serve the students
best," said Charles Y. Park, assistant
librarian, when asked why it was not
open until 10 o'clock Saturday and
Sunday nights.

"We have gradually increased the
time that the library is open over a
period of years. At one time it wasn't
open on Sunday at all, and on Satur
day it closed at 3:30 o'clock," said
Park. The time of closing on Satur
day was extended to 5 o'clock, and
then the library was opened on Sun
day from 2 to 6 o'clock.

"To keep the library open until 10
o'clock on Saturday and Sunday
nights would be a very considerable
expense, and I doubt very much
whether it would be used enough to
justify the cost," Park explained.
