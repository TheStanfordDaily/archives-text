### Sylva Weaver 
"Indians are children of nature.
They are delighted in the fields,
flowers, and trees around Stanford,"
said B. I. Staples of Coolidge, New
Mexico, who has brought the five In
dians to the Pacific Coast who are
now exhibiting their crafts in the Art
Gallery.

"According to their religious beliefs
the Great Spirit behind the blue sky
who sends rain and sunshine pro
duces everlasting life. In the words
of the western world God created na
ture and man to appreciate it. The
Indians know that the Great Spirit
will never fail them if they have
enough faith.
Sand-Painting Is Rite
"The sand-painting, which is a pe
culiar Navajo custom, is a religious
ceremony. It is used in healing in the
sacred organization of the medicine
and also in tribal initiations. The
work is commenced at sunrise, and
destroyed at sundown."
The design used in the sand-paint
ing in the Art Gallery now is con
nected with the Indian ceremony of
Ye-Be-Chi which takes place after the

harvest is gathered in the fall. It
corresponds to the Thanksgiving Day
of the United States. There are four
figures of the four prophets repre
sented. Encircling these is another
great figure, the rainbow.
Live in New Mexico
The Navajos are now living on a
large reservation, in the northern
part of New Mexico. They are wan
dering nomads dwelling in hogans or
small mud houses. The Navajo is the
largest tribe living today and the only
tribe increasing in number. Included
in the exhibition here at Stanford are
ihree Navajos, the chief, the sand
painter, and the weaver. Their names
are: Totchern (chief) Usida (silver
smith), Jenna Bah, and Denie Chile
Betsua.

The Zunis are a pueblo
have a small reservation in the west
ern part of New Mexico. The Pueblo
women control the home, do all the
plastering and pottery work. The chil
dren take their mother's name and
belong to her clan. The father owns
the field and cattle but, once the har
vest is within the home, the mother
controls it.
