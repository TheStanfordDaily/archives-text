# ILLUSTRATED LECTURE ON CELESTIAL BODIES GIVEN BY BAUMGARDT
## 
### 
"The universe is a symbol of the
reality that sustains it" was the view
expressed by B. R. Baumgardt in his
illustrated lecture on "An Evening
with the Stars" last night.

Remarkable celestial photographs
taken at the Mount Wilson observa
tory which has the most powerful re
flecting telescope in the world, and in
other observatories of Europe and
the United States revealed striking
truths. The sun, with its many sun
spots by which, according to Baum
gardt, with further study we can for
tell the crops, and the total eclipse
of the sun were seen.
The photographs of Mars show that
it has water and many clouds, and in
1924 it was proven by R. I. Trumpler
(hat there are what some have called
canals on Mars. However, says Baum
gardt, these are not really canals but
waterways over 200 miles across.
However, there is no proof that they
are man-made.
The moon was shown by the photo
graphs to have no water or vegeta
tion, but to have had tremendous vol
canic activity in the past.
Nebula in all stages of develop
ment were pictured, and some im
mense black spaces appeared. As
more powerful telescopes have been
used, no stars have appeared in these
spaces. This may indicate that the uni
verse is finite.
