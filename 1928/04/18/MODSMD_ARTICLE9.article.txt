## 
### 
Sidney J. W. Sharp, '15, has offered
an award of $50 to go to the winner
of the Moot Court competition for
first-year law students. According to
George Crocker, member Moot Court
Hoard, there are but six partnerships
remaining undefeated.

The regular Moot Court advanced
to the final round for the $200 Sloss
award last night. The results are:
1. Peterson-Kaseberg defeated Brown
stone-Lang. Judged by Superior
Judge Daniel C. Deasy of San Fran
cisco.
2. L. Brown-Lloyd defeated H. Brown-
Brunner. Judged by Superior Judge
Frank A. Griffen of San Francisco.
Both decisions were won by very
close margins. Unusually forceful and
logical delivery featured the argu
ments. The final case between last
night's winners will be heard May 15.
