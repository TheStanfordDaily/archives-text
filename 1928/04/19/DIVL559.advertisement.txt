in Cunard Comfort
Go the economical way witli
adventurers of your own
age —people who are deter
mined that they will see,
and get all the advantages of
havingseen,Europehutwho
want to save their money to
spend while traveling there
and who enjoy a trip on the
ocean for its own sake.
Do you realize how very
inexpensively this can be
done on big Cunard ships
such as the CARONIA, CAR
MANIA, SCYTIIIA, LACONIA,
LANCASTRIA,andTUSCANIA?
You are berthed in a com
fortable, clean cabin, you
have good food, nicely
served, with ample deck
space and you enjoy the
company of your own kind
of people . . . because they
are others like you who feel
the adventurous call of trav
eling Tourist Third Cabin.
You will dance on moonlit
decks to the rhythm of a
college orchestra no feet
have yet resisted. You will
swim in salt water in an im
provised deck tank. You'll
play the delightful deck
games that youth-on-a-lark
devises. And there'll be
bridge,--and conversation;
--and sometimes lost
sleep! But of course you
have your choice between
missing sleep and fun.
