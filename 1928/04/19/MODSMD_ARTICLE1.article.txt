# CARD VICTORY INEVITABLE IN THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL MEET
## Prospective Olympic Games Entrants, Close Races Features of Day California-Stanford Records May Be Sent Soaring Is Prediction 
### 
Although an overwhelming Stanford
victory looms as inevitable, the thirty
fifth annual Big Meet, to be held here
Saturday, will be worth the money
if only because it is a Bear-Card con
test.

The good old Stanford-California
spirit, which will be much in evi
dence, won't be the only attraction,
however. The fact that some close
races are probable, and above all the
fact that several husky Cards, who
will be there, seem likely prospects
for the coming Olympic games go to
make the Big Meet, worth seeing. It
isn't every day that track fans are
able to see a college oval team which
has the genuine quality possessed by
the Stanford outfit.

While track experts are busily pre
paring dope sheets showing to the
fraction of a point just how badly
California is to be beaten, Walt
Christie and the boys in Berkeley can
be counted on not to give up without I
a struggle.
The Bears are always at their best
against Stanford, and inasmuch as
some of the Californians can't be
termed second-rate performers, sev
eral races are bound to be close.
In addition, some California-Stan
ford meet records are in grave danger
of being shattered as the Cards and
Bears take the field tomorrow. Just
how many depends on the weather
and the personal condition of the
competitors.
