"A few critics are still left who
give scrupulous reviews of the thea
tre, books, and music," said Alexan
der Fried, music critic of the San
Francisco Chronicle, in a lecture
given before the English Club last
night.
"There are three styles of review:
the personal, which is the most popu
lar and read more than the others;
reportorial, and technical."
Fried gave a general discussion of
newspapers of today, and particularly
emphasized the materialistic side of
newspaper reviews. He said that the
inference of a single review might
not have much influence, but review
ing in general can help a play through
the creation of public interest.
