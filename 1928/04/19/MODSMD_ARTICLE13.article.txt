# AGE OF LOUIS XIV IS MOTIF OF '29 PROM DECORATIONS
## Rose, Silver to Transform Pavilion Into French 'Salle de Danse' Committee Announces Plans For Orchestra, Lighting, Draping Effects 
### Sylva Weaver 
The grandeur and magnificence of
"le roi soleil," Louis XIV, will come
to life again when the Junior Class
has its annual Promenade on May 11.
The decorations which will transform
the Pavilion into a rose and silver
"salle de danse au Grand Monarque"
were announced last night by Paul
Herbold, chairman of the Prom com
mittee, and Powell Carpenter, who
has charge of the decorations.
On entering the Pavilion one will
go through a marquee, a canopy used
in the old days, where a liveried foot
man will assist the ladies. The lobby
will be covered with heavy rugs with
floor lamps carrying out the rose and
silver motif.
The inside of the Pavilion will
again be predominantly rose. The '
ceiling will be a light stiple blue
which looks silver in light. The
clouds will thus have a silver lining,
and everything will be rosy when May
11 rolls around. The ceiling will be
draped gracefully down to the sides.
Softly draped rose will cover the
walls. Where the rose and silver meet, j
in the proximity of the balcony, large
?;old cords will be hung. From the
highest points of these cords tassels
will fall.
Each year the various dance com
mittees search for a suitable place to
put the orchestra which will assure i
the musical strains reaching the far I
outposts of the Pavilion. At the 1928 j
Prom a most happy solution has been j
found. The orchestra will be placed in i
the middle of the floor on a slightly j
raised platform.
A large crystal chandelier with
colored lights playing on it will sup
ply the light. Lights will be used that
will bring out the rose and silver of |
the recorations.
Tickets for the Prom are on sale at.
the Old Union now.
