# PEOPLES OF LEVANT TRY NEW REFORMS. EDUCATOR DECLARES
## Turks Have Made Up Mind To Adopt Western Idea Of Renaissance 
### 
"The Turks have made up their minds
that to be modern they have to dress like
Europeans," said Dr. Bayard Dodge,
president of the American University of
Beirut, Syria, in describing the "Renais
sance of Asia" in a lecture last night.

American and European novels, movies,
dress, and automobiles have been taken up
in the cities, but the interior remains the
same. "They think that the country will
no longer have the stigma of the sick
man of Europe if they take on the mod
ern manners," said Dodge.

Students of many nationalities gather
in the colleges of the Levant, and find
that there is no race problem, learn to be
tolerant, and to uphold peace, and they
go back to their countries as the first
educated people, to be trained leaders.

The three American colleges in Turkey
are Roberts College, Constantinople
Women's College, and the University of
Beirut. The Bulgarians are building,
with American aid, a college at Sofia, and
the Greeks are building a model school
at Athens with their own money, but
with the advice of Americans. Domestic

science, agriculture, and engineering are
the main courses taught, the others being
art, literature, chemistry, etc. Beirut has
a large football field where the men learn
the real meaning of democracy.

Six graduates of Roberts College are
now attending the University of Cali
fornia. "Many foreign students are com
ing to our country to study our methods.
They arc looking particularly to America
to help them for it is she who has kept
out of politics in Asia; this is indeed a
great challenge," said Dodge.
