MONTREAL, Quebec, April 18. —
(U.P.) — The transatlantic plane
Bremen may be ready to leave Green
ly Island Saturday or Sunday, Robert
Cannon of the Canadian Transconti
nental Airways, now at Murray Bay,
said tonight.

Cannon made the announcement
after consulting with Major James
Fitzmaurice, Irish member of the
Bremen crew, who arived late today
at Lake St. Agnes airdrome from
Clarke City, Quebec.

Cannon said it was hoped to assem
ble the spart parts for the Bremen at
Murray Bay and then have the
Junkers monoplane, Fl3, sister ship
of the Bremen, make a hop to Green
ly Island and aid in repairing the
Bremen.
It was assumed the Bremen would
make a stop, perhaps at Quebec, be
fore continuing to New York after it
is repaired. Original plans were for
the plane to start Monday.

Fraulein Kerta Junkers, who greet
ed Fitzmaurice at Lake St. Agnes air
drome today, was reported to have
returned to Murray Bay but to be
preparing to return to the airdrome,
probably tonight. This strengthened
the belief of some that she would be
a member of the relief expedition to
Greenly Island.
