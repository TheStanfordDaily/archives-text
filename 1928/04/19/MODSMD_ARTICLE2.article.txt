# W. E. HOTCHKISS HOME HEAVILY DAMAGED BY EARLY MORNING FIRE
## 
### 
The newly constructed stucco home
of Dean Willard E. Hotchkiss, of the
Graduate School of Business, caught
fire early yesterday morning due to
an overflow of oil in the furnace. The
damage, a great deal of which was
done by smoke and water, has been
estimated at between eight and ten
thousand dollars. Many valuable rugs
and costly draperies, together with
all the living-room furniture, includ
ing a grand piano and a victrola were
destroyed.
The Hotchkiss family had only lived
in the house, which is situated in the
new residential district back of Lagu
nita, since February 29, and had given
a reception last Sunday afternoon to
their many friends as a house warm
ing to open their home.
Shortly before 7 o'clock Hotchkiss
and his family were awakened when
smoke entered the second floor. The
fire had burned between the walls
from the basement through the living
room and up into the bedrooms on
the second floor.
