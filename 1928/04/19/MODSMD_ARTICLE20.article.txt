# Education Makes Gap Between Two Generations In Syria Says Dodge
## President of University in Syria Explains Ideals Of Near East College Speaker Claims American Tourists Given Friendly Native Reception

Tall, gracious, charming, with a slight
ly English accent and a delightful smile,
Bayard Dodge easily marks himself as a
leader. It is easy to understand this
man's achievements, even from a brief
contact with him. As president of the
University of Beirut, Syria, he is doing
the work to which he feels himself, called,
and for which he passed up the easier
road opened by inherited wealth.

Education is doing the same things to
students in Syria it is to the college
going youth of this country, Dr. Dodge
says. "Science haÂ§ leveled everything.
Harry Emerson Fosdick held a big forum
at the school at which Moslems, Chris
tians, and Buddhists were present, and
the questions they sent in for him to
answer were the same ones which would
have been asked by a Stanford student."

Of course this marks an almost unbe
lievable gap between the old generation
and the new. "Parents there take a great
pride in their children, even if they don't
understand them. The gap is so great
that there is really little friction. The
children are very affectionate and con-

siderate, although they wish to be as j
different from their parents as possible, i
"There is a great desire to see an edu- I
cated womanhood. There is a wide feel- !
ing, intuitive if not entirely formulated,
that the hope of the country lies in com- |
plete and broad education for women.
They are coming to take much the same ]
place in general life as they do here.
Contrary to general belief, Dr. Dodge j
says the feeling toward Americans is a
very friendly one. An American tourist
was crossing the desert, and was flying
a small American flag from the radiator
cap. A bunch of Arabs swooped down
upon him, and much to his surprise kissed
the flag, and were unable to do enough \
for him. It is the same everywhere as I
far as the Moslems are concerned.
