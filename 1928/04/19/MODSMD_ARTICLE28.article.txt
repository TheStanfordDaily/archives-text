Since the announcement several years ago of a change in the require
ments for admission to the Stanford Law School, which was in essence
that a student must have an A.B. or B.S. degree, a number of other
universities have also raised their requirements. Notable among these
are Columbia and California, the former making it necessary for an
applicant to pass an examination similar to the Stanford freshman apti
tude test, besides having had three years of college work.
Last week the Board of Regents of U.C. took action making it neces
sary for a Law student to have an A.B. or B.S. before entrance in the
School of Jurisprudence. They will give the degree of LL.B. instead of
J.D., as in the past, for three years of work. The Doctor of the Science
of Law will be given for additional work designed for prospective teach
ers. This plan is practically the same as that now used here.
This trend toward making professional educations increasingly diffi
cult is a good thing. Not only is it beneficial for one who is going to
practice law to spend more time learning judicial matters themselves, but
it is of equal value for him to have a general knowledge of political, social,
scientific, and other subjects.

Making it harder to enter a law school limits its numbers more closely
to those who are studying with a purpose. It has been complained that
there are too many lawyers, that the cities are overrun with them. This
is in part due to the fact that it has been too easy to become one, and
partly because there are too many so-called shyster lawyers, men who
care nothing about upholding the principles and ethics of their profession.
The law schools are expected to impart the right ideals to their stu
dents, and this they can best do when the number of students is limited,
not only in number but also to men and women who have entered the
work with the intention of becoming lawyers, and to those who already
have a sufficient foundation upon which to lay the stones of good practice.
