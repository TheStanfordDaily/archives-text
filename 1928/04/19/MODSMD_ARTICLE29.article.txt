# Do We Want Them?

Tuesday night, following a long period of doubt and controversy, the
Executive Committee decided to continue the musical concert series next
year, in spite of the fact that this season's concerts netted a deficit of
around a thousand dollars. Plans are being outlined whereby it is thought
the series next year cannot possibly lose so much money, and it depends
upon whether or not the students are interested enough to support the
concerts.

The chance is being taken because the Committee feels that even
though such a project does lose some money, it is of sufficient benefit to
the students to warrant the expense. However, if the people for whom
the money is being expended do not care enough about hearing world
famous artists for the small amount that is charged, there is no use
worrying about it. Certainly, the Student Body can't stand an outlay of
a thousand dolars every year, just for the gratification of saying that it
does have these artists.

It is up to the students to show that they want the series to continue
every year, by purchasing the season tickets which will be ready for
distribution in a short time.
