People seem to be greatly surprised to find that only twenty-nine out
of one hundred and fifty-nine girls at the University of Missouri, and
only one of a hundred and fifty at the University of California, would
marry Charles Lindbergh if they had the chance. The reasons given by
the rejectors are many, the most prominent being that they don't want a
famous husband, for whom they would only be "Lindy's wife." The
trouble with these girls is that they think a man with such courage
wouldn't be so easy to handle. He might smoke cigarettes in bed, and
make 'em like it.
Some of the girls said they'd like to go out with him a few times
before they decided, which goes to show that all this scientific experi
mentation that the professors talk about does find a few little niches to
lodge in after all. One of the largest groups of answers was to the
effect that the girls didn't want to marry Lindbergh because they were
already in love with someone else. Who said the modern girl doesn't want
her man?
