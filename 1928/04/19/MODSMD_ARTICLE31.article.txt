Tuesday a man slipped on the car tracks on Mission Street in San
Francisco and lay stunned. A street car was bearing down upon him,
the motorman apparently unaware of his plight. Policeman E. E. Fisher,
of the.traffic department, saw the impending disaster, rushed across the
street, and dragged the man to safety just as the wheels of the car grazed
his head. Jn doing this, Fisher barely escaped being run down himself,
according to pedestrians who saw the incident.
This is just one example of the many chances officers of the law take |
that arc not necessarily their "duty." We are always hearing of the |
untoward things policemen do, but the countless number of truly heroic 1
deeds they do in the course of a day's work receive little notice or
comment.
Tryoutees for the Daily editorial staff will meet in the editorial office'
at 7:15 o'clock tonight.
