Last Friday night a group—sup
posedly of Stanford men —numbering
somewhere between sixty and one
hundred, went to Berkeley in an at
tempt to bring back the axe head
which was once Stanford's. That they
failed was probably due only to the
all but overwhelming odds against
them. The try was made —according
to Stanford-California agreements —
outside the university grounds, and
apparently the personal injuries sus
tained on either side were negligible,
despite city papers' stories of ' broken
heads," etc.
Two facts stand out about, the epi
sode, one curious, the other signifi
cant. First, that in 1928 such an expe
dition was planned and carried out —
that is the curiosity; then, that there
was so very little stir, one might
even say interest, about the whole
affair on the campus.

Without in any way disparaging the
heroism of these modern crusaders it
must be confessed that BnTiehow the
whole affair fell a little flat, here and
on the Berkeley campus sis well. Even
the glamour surrounding a glorious
failure was missing. For all the pub
lic cared, the trouble could have been
spared. Had the old oxe head changed
hands, it would have been occasion
for mild wonder, not enthusiasm. To
the great mass of college men and

women in the two institutions, the af
fair of the axe seems an interesting
anecdote of days when things were
done differently. This is a new genera
tion. School spirit in the old sense uf
the word is as extinct as the dodo —

but why bewail degeneration and de
cadence? True, the semi-hysterical
emotion associated with the Past of
the axe inspires somewhat the same
insincere interest today as would an
attempt to revive debate on the vari
ous theories of transubstantiation —
yet perhaps the loss is not so great.
As a very capable article in the No
vember Illustrated Review put it —

". . . . intense feeling on the question
is now lacking. So far as Stanford is
concerned, the old axe is a 'buried
hatchet' and the past is forgotten."

More of the past is being forgotten
every day. If the axe and its ilk repre
sent anything, they represent dead
issues. There is no turning back; pro
cesses of this sort cannot be reversed.
The only way out is forward, along
lines of inevitable development. This
minor episode has simply shown that
in the future all such expeditioners
will have to do their adventuring sim
ply with a view to the fun —if any
that they find in it —for to their com
panions such antedated stirring must
seem quixotic and insignificant.

Two facts stand out about, the epi
sode, one curious, the other signifi

that is the curiosity; then, that there
was so very little stir, one might
even say interest, about the whole
affair on the campus.

Without in any way disparaging the
heroism of these modern crusaders it
must be confessed that BnTiehow the
whole affair fell a little flat, here and
on the Berkeley campus sis well. Even
the glamour surrounding a glorious
failure was missing. For all the pub
lic cared, the trouble could have been
spared. Had the old oxe head changed

for mild wonder, not enthusiasm. To
the great mass of college men and

women in the two institutions, the af
fair of the axe seems an interesting
anecdote of days when things were
done differently. This is a new genera
tion. School spirit in the old sense uf
the word is as extinct as the dodo —

but why bewail degeneration and de
cadence? True, the semi-hysterical
emotion associated with the Past of
the axe inspires somewhat the same
insincere interest today as would an
attempt to revive debate on the vari
ous theories of transubstantiation —
yet perhaps the loss is not so great.

is now lacking. So far as Stanford is
concerned, the old axe is a 'buried
hatchet' and the past is forgotten."

More of the past is being forgotten
every day. If the axe and its ilk repre
sent anything, they represent dead
issues. There is no turning back; pro
cesses of this sort cannot be reversed.
The only way out is forward, along
lines of inevitable development. This
minor episode has simply shown that
in the future all such expeditioners
will have to do their adventuring sim
ply with a view to the fun —if any
that they find in it —for to their com
panions such antedated stirring must
seem quixotic and insignificant.

Last Friday night a group—sup

somewhere between sixty and one
hundred, went to Berkeley in an at

which was once Stanford's. That they

all but overwhelming odds against
them. The try was made —according
