"Interference." Geary Theatre, San i
Francisco.
"Interference," with its unobtrusive
title, came quietly into San Francisco
last week, without the usual heralding
and blowing of Hollywood trumpets,j
and it is the best and most beautifully
done melodrama we've had this year.
It's good enough to be taking the
house away from "Desert Song," play
ing next door, instead of catching the ,
overflow.
We saw it two nights ago and are
still a nervous wreck from the ex
perience. One of the best qualities of
the play is that it is kept low —played |
with reserve, but not a let-down in j
tension throughout. The themes of!
blackmail, a loving wife concealing
from a loving husband, the charming
blackguard returning to life, and a
murder, are not glaringly out of the
ordinary, but the treatment is origi
nal. You are not conscious of having
seen a "melerdramer" until you have j
left the theatre. This restraint makes
the scenes vastly more effective than ;
the rip-roaring hair-tearing mega-!
phone crimes that have been about
recently.
Cast Is Clever
The cast is a real one, not a hit-or-1
miss collection of miscellaneous j
whatnots. They are all English, with
the exception of Isabel Withers, who 1
plays Deborah Kane, a questionable |
woman in a pajama lounge suit. The
voice tones and contrast seem to have
been considered as carefully by the
director as the dramatic action.
The play is well-written. The lines
are very good indeed, particularly j
those of Philip Zoaze. Zoaze, played i
by Pat Somerset, is charming, amus- :
ing, and tragic. Faith Marlay, with
Doris Lloyd, is a beautiful heroine. ;
She lifts herself with her skill as an
actress, from the usual type of violet
eyed, melting heroines.
Marlay Plays Well
Sir John Marlay, with Montagu
Shaw, is an adequate doctor, besides
a convincing and artistic actor. It is !
such a change to see a theatrical
doctor who doesn't look as though
he would faint at the sight of blood! I
The minor characters are very good

indeed, especially the cockney maid.
It really seems to us a very fine
play indeed. We have been told re
cently that we don't know a thing
about drama, but nevertheless we
recommend it heartily—for what our
recommendation is worth. In fact,
there were only two things we could
find fault with: a little overdose of
sentiment about the duty of a doctor
to his patients, and that we couldn't
understand anything Childers, the
i butler, said. That was his accent —not
! his enunciation. Hope that "Inter
! ference" will have a long run!
