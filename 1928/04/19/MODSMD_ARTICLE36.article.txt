# DOPESTER PREDICTS OVERWHELMING WIN FOR DAILY CONTEST
## 
### 
That Stanford will take
points in the California meet is the
prediction of the average dope sheet
based on the guesses entered in the
Daily's Big Meet Dope and Prog
nostication contest. Such a deluge
of points to the Cardinals would
leave California to content itself
with 29J4.
One dopester, Harrison van der
Werker, figures the score will be
102 to 29 (which was the Daily's
guess, made yesterday), and he
further believes Stanford men will
take every first place. Seven Bears
are conceded second places and eight
third places.
Dope sheets should be mailed to
the Managing Editor, or delivered
to the Daily office. Entries in the
contest close Saturday noon. The
score and the individual place win
ners should be predicted on the
sheet.
Prizes offered are a $10 merchan
dise order by Roos Bros., a $7.50
pair of shoes by Thoits, a live
pound box of candy by Wilson's,
and a special women's prize of a
carton of cigarettes by Morey's.
