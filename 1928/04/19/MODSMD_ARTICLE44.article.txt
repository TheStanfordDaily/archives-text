### 
John A. Heydler, president of the
National League, chooses to run in
1928, very decidedly. Not that the
prexy of the older circuit is up for
nomination or election or anythingj
like that, but he is very much on the
job, and feels a very great responsi
bility that his pet, hobby, and life
work, the National League of Profes
sional Baseball Clubs, shall get re
venge on that young upstart, the
American League, for the four straight
defeats administered to the Pirates by
the Yankees in the last world series.
Pirates again, Cardinals, Cubs,
Giants —even the lowly Phils; Heyd
ler plays no favorites, but it pulling
for each and every one to have a
good season, avoid scandals, give the
fans a run for their money, and win
the world's championship back to the
older league. Mr. Heydler is a busy
man these days, spending much more
of his time at his office on West 40th
Street, New York City, than he does .
at his home in Garden City, Long
Tsland, but later on he will get time
for a little golf (he has made a hole ,
in one!) and, of course, to see many, j;
many ball games. | ;

Watching ball games, either as a
spectator, umpire, or league official,
is something that Heydler has been
doing now for nearly forty years. He
saw his first major league game from
the windows of the Government print
ing offices in Washington in 1889.

Always Interested in baseball,
young Heydler umpired amateur
games now and then, and, in 1895,
filled in in a major league contest
when Tim Keefe failed to show up.
Later he was taken on as a regular.
About 1903 he was appointed secre
tary to Harry Pulliam, president of
Hie National League, and remained
is secretary-treasurer until 1918,
when he was unanimously elected to

succeed Governor Tener as the boss
of the older circuit. For ten years now
he has been the fairest, most honest
president the league has ever had.

National League, chooses to run in
1928, very decidedly. Not that the
prexy of the older circuit is up for
nomination or election or anythingj
like that, but he is very much on the
job, and feels a very great responsi
bility that his pet, hobby, and life
work, the National League of Profes
sional Baseball Clubs, shall get re
venge on that young upstart, the
American League, for the four straight
defeats administered to the Pirates by
the Yankees in the last world series.
Pirates again, Cardinals, Cubs,
Giants —even the lowly Phils; Heyd
ler plays no favorites, but it pulling
for each and every one to have a
good season, avoid scandals, give the
fans a run for their money, and win
the world's championship back to the
older league. Mr. Heydler is a busy
man these days, spending much more
of his time at his office on West 40th
Street, New York City, than he does .
at his home in Garden City, Long
Tsland, but later on he will get time
for a little golf (he has made a hole ,
in one!) and, of course, to see many, j;
many ball games. | ;

Watching ball games, either as a
spectator, umpire, or league official,
is something that Heydler has been
doing now for nearly forty years. He
saw his first major league game from
the windows of the Government print
ing offices in Washington in 1889.

Always Interested in baseball,
young Heydler umpired amateur
games now and then, and, in 1895,
filled in in a major league contest
when Tim Keefe failed to show up.
Later he was taken on as a regular.
About 1903 he was appointed secre
tary to Harry Pulliam, president of
Hie National League, and remained
is secretary-treasurer until 1918,
when he was unanimously elected to

succeed Governor Tener as the boss
of the older circuit. For ten years now
he has been the fairest, most honest
president the league has ever had.
