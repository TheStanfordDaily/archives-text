"American audienccs do not suffer es
sentially from English audiences except
in one point," said Doris Lloyd, leading
lady : of "Interference," in an interview
to the Daily. "After a play an English
audience will remain seated until the last
curtain call is over, while Americans are
ready to leave as soon as the first curtain
has dropped on the last act."

Miss Lloyd is a charming young Eng
lishwoman of medium height, with au
burn hair and hazel eyes. She has beauti
ful hands and a lovely complexion. Her
most striking qualities are her refinement
and her simplicity. She is natural and un
affected.

Miss Lloyd played on the English stage,
then came to America to enter the movies.
She was connected mostly with Fox and
Metro Goldvvyn Mayer. She has appeared
with Antonio Moreno, Lon Chaney,
George O'Brien, and Owen Moore.

During the war the actress played in
soldier camps in England. At one time,
some troops, as a demonstration against
the. government, set the theater on fire
during her performance. No one was
hurt, but all the stage settings were lost.
She also tells how economically people
had to live during this time. She and
three other girls lived on a little over
three dollars a week, by beating prices
down.
"I think Stanford is very beautiful,"
said Miss Lloyd, when questioned on this
subject. "I made a very short visit, how
ever, so I have only a very general im
pression."
