# CONFERENCE STANDING HINGES ON CARD-BEAR BALL GAME SATURDAY
## Stanford Nine Prepares to Grab One Victory From Berkeley Team 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity nine!
: went through a fast work-out yesterday
: in preparation for the third game of the
series with California next Saturday af
! ternoon following the Big Meet. Though
the Bears have already won the scries
j by taking the first two games, Saturday's
! diamond contest will have considerable
j bearing on the teams' respective confer
ence standings and should be one of the
best erf the year. A victory for either
j team places it third in the California Col
legiate Baseball Conference for the sea- j
j son.
Gene Kern has been selected to do the
mound work for the Cards. Kern hasn't
had a single \ 1 day all year, hurling
good ball in every game he has started.
Against S.C. on the southern trip he
allowed the Trojan sluggers hut two
| hits during the entire nine innings.
The Cards' showing against the U.C. j
L.A. Bruins Tuesday was far from im- i
pressive, and their batting showed little
j improvement. They were able to garner .
only seven safe hits from the offerings of
the two Bruin chuckers, Graham and
i Griffith, who, by the way, walked five men
; between them and seemed to be in the
hole a good part of the time. Harry
, Berg, who has been in the lineup at left
field in the last two games, was the only
| Stanford man to pound out two safe
j bingles.
Stanford's fielding has been compara
j tively good all year, and with a little
| more strength in the batting department, i
| many close games which have gone to
j the opponents would have resulted in
| wins for the Cardinal. In yesterday's j
| practice session the Stanford men looked [
| considerably better in their stickwork, j
and if they continue to improve they j
| should be able to knock the Bear pitcher |
j out of the box early in the game.
