# Roble Hall Will Present Novel Dance on April 28
## 
### 
Although "there is nothing new under
the sun," something distinctly novel to the
campus will appear at the Roble dance on
April 28 if present plans materialize.
An outside dance will be given. In
order to do this, the dance committee
plans to have a large wooden floor made
which can be stored away in the winter
and used for spring dances in the future.
Katherine Keho, '31, has charge of the
dance.
