### 
of the Century ~
leading all the sixes
in distinction and value
Far faster than Hupmobile can build them, the motoring
public is demanding record quotas of the Hupmobile Six
of the Century. One reason overshadows others in this
country-wide acceptance of the car —the fact that a new
and original style has appeared among sixes and that this
more striking beauty is sponsored by a maker of Hupmo
bile's reputation. It is worthy of note that the Six of the
Century is drawing buyers from every field—from those
who planned to spend several hundred dollars less to
those accustomed to paying $1000 more for distinctive,
appearance and performance.
