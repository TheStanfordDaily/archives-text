Although the California Bears have
finished the first two games of the 1928
baseball series on the long end of the
score, the Stanford varsity nine, led by
Captain Cook Sypher, will endeavor to
stein the tide of California victories when
it meets the Bear team here tomorrow,
in the third and last game of the series.
California won the first game 6-2, and
the second 2-1.
Bear Games Close
With heads bloody but unbowed, as
the poets would say, the Cards will begin
the game determined to even the count to
some extent with the Berkeley men. Both
of the games with California this year
were close, and if there had been a trifle
more strength in Stanford's batting, the
Cardinal nine would probably have come
out on top in both contests.
Nemechek a Star
Gus Nemechek seems to be the only
pitcher that the Bears have, but so far
he has proved to be sufficient. He has
allowed the Stanford batsmen but nine
hits in the two games. He is also cred
ited with two victories over Stanford in
the 1927 series. He doesn't appear to
have an unusual amount of speed or to
put any exceptional "stuff" on the ball;
but his control is good, and that gets re
sults. He seldom throws the ball di
rectly over the plate, but consistently
cuts the corners with his offerings.
Coach Ilarry Wolter, who has used |
Lewis, Philippi, and Sobieski in the box
against California, has decided to start
Gene Kern tomorrow. Kern is a cool
and heady pitcher with a capacity for
keeping out of the hole. Ilis delivery is
rather odd and seems to fool the oppos- ,
ing batters, and besides this he is able to |
come through with the goods and put
over balls that can't be hit.
Lineup Announced
The remainder of the Stanford lineup
will be the sameâ€”Sypher, catcher; Ma
guire, first base; Garibaldi, second base;
Laird, third base; Busch, short stop;
Berg, left field; Wilton, center field; and
Sims, right field.
For thirty-seven consecutive years Cal
ifornia and Stanford have competed on
the diamond, and during these years the
Bears have taken twenty-three scries to
Stanford's twelve. The 1906 series re
sulted in a tie. Since 1920 California has
won six series; Stanford, two.
Wyatt will do the catching for the
Bears, and the balance of their lineup!
will be as follows: Stevenson, lb; De- I
vore, 2b; Valianos, ss; Millett, 31); Hill. |
If; Douthit, cf; and Maurice, rf.
