# ARTISTS TO PRESENT CONTRASTING OILS IN ART GALLERY EXHIBIT
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
A striking contrast in methods and
effects is seen in the work of the two
artists who open an exhibition this
morning in the Art Gallery. Roberta
Balfour uses vibrations of broken
color and a pure color pallette, while
Laura A. Armer paints in pure color
with virility of form and technique in
broad flat tones without shading.
"Painting should express the inner
significance of life, not the material
and the obvious," said Roberta Bal
four who was on the campus yester
day. Mrs. Balfour has struck out in
a new field of art. She has broken
away from the academic schools
where she learned to paint to a new
method of ekpressing the vibrations
of the atmosphere to which she is
particularly sensitive. Having been
brought up in Nova Scotia, the warm,
invigorating climate of California,
where she came about six years ago,
was a new thing, and it was in the
search to find a method to express
the vibrations of light in the Golden
State that Mrs. Balfour finally came
to the method she now employs—a
method of expressing the vibrations
ment among artists as it is so dis
tinctly different from any of the ac
cepted academic traditions,
Laura A. Armer, who is exhibiting
with Mrs. Balfour, is interested in
the ethnological phases of the desert,
and the curious legends of the Nava
jo tribe. She has studied in New
Mexico rll the myths of creation and
the stories of nature which are so
beautifully conceived by the Navajos
—the wandering nomads who believe
in the great spirit living behind the
blue sky.
