### 
WASHINGTON, April 19.—( U.P.) —
A stubborn fire tonight in the south
east section of the city along the
Potomac river, brought out three
alarms and harbor fire-fighting apa
ratus.
The fire was centered in an old
fish market and spread to adjoining
buildings as harbor tugs poured
streams of water over the burning
structures.
