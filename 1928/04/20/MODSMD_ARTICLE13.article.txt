### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 19. —
(U.P.) —Construction of the giant Boul
der Dam project in Colorado, as outlined
in the Swing-Johnson bill, which is ex
pected to be brought up in the Senate
today, is held not feasible in a report of
a special committee of the American En
gineering Council, representing 43,000
professional engineers, made public here
tonight.
The council, an organization conducted
to afford a means through which engi
neers may express their views on national
questions of an engineering character,
said the special committee which decided
against feasibility of building the project
was composed of the "most eminent en
gineers experienced in such matters."
The council's deciJc.-i is expected to
be used by opponents of the Swing-
Johnson bill as an argument against the
project when it comes up for considera
tion.
Senator Johnson of California, author
of the measure, said arrangements have
been made to take up the bill as soon as
the naval appropriation bill is out of the
way, and a final vote on the latter meas
ure is expected Friday or Saturday.
