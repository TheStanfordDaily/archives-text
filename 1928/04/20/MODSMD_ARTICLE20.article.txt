HONOLULU, T.H., April 19.—( U.P.)
—Resumption of the search for the
missing British freighter Asiatic
Prince by the United States Navy
was announced today by officials of
Pearl Harbor navy base.
The cruisers Marblehead, Rich
mond, and Cincinnati have left the
Orient for this port and will keep
constant watch for the missing ship
during the voyage.
The Asiatic Prince is long overdue
at Yokohama.
Mariners believe it sent distress
calls on the night of March 31. Sig
nals for help were heard by the
liners Calawaii and Niagara on that
night but were so weak they were
hard to decipher.
