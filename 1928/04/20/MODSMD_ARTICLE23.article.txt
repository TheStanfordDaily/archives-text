# SINCLAIR JURY VERDICT OUT SATURDAY; FALL'S VERSION UNMENTIONED
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 19.—(U.P.)—
By Saturday night Harry F. Sinclair
may know his fate in the Teapot
Dome conspiracy trial.
The defense rested unexpectedly to
day without offering the jury the
famous deposition which lawyers took
from Albert B. Fall at El Paso, Texas,
recently, and which purported to give
Fall's version of the Teapot Dome
and money transaction between them.
Why the defense decided not to use
this was a mystery. The defense said
it cut short its testimony because the
Government's case was so weak. On
the other hand, it was hinted that the
deposition might not have been so
favorable in some respects to the de
fense and also that to offer it would
have opened the way for the Govern
ment to have given testimony to
break down Sinclair's contention that
in giving Fall $233,000 in Liberty
Bonds he was buying a third interest
in the Fall ranch.
The Government is seeking to have
the jury advised that the defense with
held the Fall deposition and the judge
will rule Friday as to whether the
jury may know this.
