## California Scribe Declares Bears Cannot Take More Than 38 Points Tomorrow Even If They Get Breaks

BERKELEY, April 19.—The old master and the new master, Wtut
Christie and "Dink" Templeton, are at it again—the annual scuffle and
shuffle for every point in the Big Meet.
The California picture is a sad one. Christie's efforts to collect points
by strategical moves reminds one of the story of Mother Hubbard and the
cupboard that was bare when she went to it to get a bone for her dog.
Giving the Bears all the breaks they deserve on the basis of past per
formances, it's almost impossible to see how they can score more than 38
points. And the chances are the final count will be under that. Christie's
men as a team are ten-spots and Templeton's are aces.

Bears Weak in Field
In their dope sheets, Californians pass
over the field events hurriedly. Five
points are the most the Bears can expect
to Stanford's forty-nine. What can a
good team do to men like Eric Krenz,
A1 Forster, Harlow Rothert, Bob King,
Ward Edmonds, Fred Zomhro, Kim
Dyer, and the rest? The answer in this
case is five third places at tlie most: Irv
Phillips, discus, over 140 feet; Benny
Lom, broad jump, 23 feet 7 inches; Em
ory Curtice, javelin, 184 feet; Tony Jack
levitch, high jump, six feet, and Everett
Scrivner, pole vault, 12 feet.
U.C. Strong on Track
It is in the track events that the hopes
of the Bears lie. It is in the mile, the 880,
the 440, and the sprints that the really
sensational battles of the day will be
fought. The optimistic Bear dope sheet
gives California 33 points here and Stan
ford 44.
The race of the century it is billed—
the nerve-smashing fight between Captain
"Lank" Talbot, Captain "Bud" Spencer,
and Johnny Morrison for places in the
440-yard dash—and never were truer
words spoken.
Typewriter athletes of the Bay region
are unanimous in declarations that Spen
cer has a first mortgage on first place
and that the real battle will be between
Talbot and Morrison for second place.
On the latter point the pencil brigade is
split about fifty-fifty.
Predict's Spencer's Defeat
From Christie comes a statement to the
effect that Talbot will beat Spencer. If
such a tiling were to happen, California
would not care so much about the beating
it will take from the Cardinals. The day
would be a success even if Stanford
should score the 95 points it is given by
the sporting press gentry.
On the basis of past times, Spencer has
i an undoubted lead over Talbot. 1 he
, black-spectacled Cardinal ace already this J
| season has been clocked at 48s flat, and
| nearly every other quarter mile he has ;
been in has been timed close to that. Tal- j
, bot won his first under-50s race last Sat
lurday.
| But on the basis of past records a slight !
| conflict can be noticed. Talbot was more !
successful in the 1.C.4-A. meet last spring j
than Spencer, although neither placed in i
1 the finals. The Bear captain was barely [
I nosed out by the eventual 440 champion
in one of the heats timed under 49 sec- 1
! onds. Spencer failed to do anything to j
bring renown to the fair name of Stan- !
1 ford.
I Moreover, as Christie says, the Stan
-1 ford track is faster than the Cal oval. If ;
| Talbot wins the pole position—well, the
» J battle will be beyond the ken of mortal j
j pen to describe. Walt thinks that Tal-,
| bot's stretch sprint will equal Spencer's.
: | And Bud's finish, according to Temple
) j ton, is the eighth wonder of the world.
> j It seems to depend entirely on their po
' I sition around the curve.
j j Kenny Van Tress is Christie's chief
) j hope to keep California from the keenest
) humiliation possible to a Bear track coach
—to see the Stanford Red ahead in every
5 event. From the personal angle Van
: Tress looks like a sure 880 winner. He
) defeated Ed Gloege of U.S.C. by some
) six or seven yards by a beautiful stretch
j dash, and Gloege had no trouble keeping
3 Tom McGuire, Stanford's best half-mile
) bet, in the rear. Bryce Schurr even nosed
1 i out McGuire, although the Trojan was
j j disqualified.
_ j But the picture is entirely different
) i from the mathematical angle. Van Tress
i j was timed in 1 minute 58.6 seconds Sat
-1 urday; McGuire was nosed out by Good

heart of Occidental the same afternoon
in 1 minute 58.2 seconds. It was the first
time the Cardinal ever broke two min
utes ; it shows he is developing fast.
But Van Tress hasn't been pushed to
his limit yet. He was held back by a bad
box on the curve Saturday. It's dollars
to dimes he can break the tape under 1
minute 58 seconds with red-hot competi
tion all the way, and McGuire will fur
nish enough of that. If Alex McKinnon
is in the race it will be for pace-setting
purposes only, for he will be very tired
after the mile. Dave Chase should place
third.
Foresee Mile Interest
The mile run, the first event, promises
to be one of the best of the day. McKin
non, despite his so-so showing last Sat
■ urday, is one of the competitive runners
Templeton has under his crimson ban
ner. It wouldn't be much of a surprise to
see him break 4 minutes 25 seconds for
! the first time this season.
Against Alexis the long-legged Ned
1 Cherry and Harry Carter. Neither of
the Bears put any last-stretch sprint into
i the mile run against S.C., linking arms
instead 35 yards from the tape, and loping
| to a 4-minute 27.7-second victory. Cherry
InnkpH liL*<» tlin liPQfr nf tli«» two • lif* lmr!

| plenty of untapped reserve power. It's
j just about the psychological time for
| Cherry to step out and break 4 minutes
I 25 seconds, too. The winning time should
be around that point.
Bears Are Optimistic
The Bears, however, are optimistic, and
j they can't see how McKinnon can reverse
form so much in one week. So Cherry
and Carter are placed one, two.
Pick your choice in the sprints—Russ
' Ewing, Homer Van Geldcr, and Bill Keil
'of California against Johnny Lauritzen
of Stanford. On the face of things it's
! a toss-up between Ewing and Lauritzen
j in the century and Van Gelder and Lau
ritzen in the furlong. Ewing has it in
| him to do 9.8s just as Van Gelder is due
Ito break 225. The Cardinal sprinter
; hasn't the confidence that comes with
1 being a winner as have the two Bears. So
this dope sheet puts Lauritzen down for
two seconds.
