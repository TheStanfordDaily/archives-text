BERKELEY, April 19.—The old master and the new master, Wtut
Christie and "Dink" Templeton, are at it again—the annual scuffle and
shuffle for every point in the Big Meet.
The California picture is a sad one. Christie's efforts to collect points
by strategical moves reminds one of the story of Mother Hubbard and the
cupboard that was bare when she went to it to get a bone for her dog.
Giving the Bears all the breaks they deserve on the basis of past per
formances, it's almost impossible to see how they can score more than 38
points. And the chances are the final count will be under that. Christie's
men as a team are ten-spots and Templeton's are aces.

Bears Weak in Field
In their dope sheets, Californians pass
over the field events hurriedly. Five
points are the most the Bears can expect
to Stanford's forty-nine. What can a
good team do to men like Eric Krenz,
A1 Forster, Harlow Rothert, Bob King,
Ward Edmonds, Fred Zomhro, Kim
Dyer, and the rest? The answer in this
case is five third places at tlie most: Irv
Phillips, discus, over 140 feet; Benny
Lom, broad jump, 23 feet 7 inches; Em
ory Curtice, javelin, 184 feet; Tony Jack
levitch, high jump, six feet, and Everett
Scrivner, pole vault, 12 feet.
U.C. Strong on Track
It is in the track events that the hopes
of the Bears lie. It is in the mile, the 880,
the 440, and the sprints that the really
sensational battles of the day will be
fought. The optimistic Bear dope sheet
gives California 33 points here and Stan
ford 44.
The race of the century it is billed—
the nerve-smashing fight between Captain
"Lank" Talbot, Captain "Bud" Spencer,
and Johnny Morrison for places in the
440-yard dash—and never were truer
words spoken.
Typewriter athletes of the Bay region
are unanimous in declarations that Spen
cer has a first mortgage on first place
and that the real battle will be between
Talbot and Morrison for second place.
On the latter point the pencil brigade is
split about fifty-fifty.
Predict's Spencer's Defeat
From Christie comes a statement to the
effect that Talbot will beat Spencer. If
such a tiling were to happen, California
would not care so much about the beating
it will take from the Cardinals. The day
would be a success even if Stanford
should score the 95 points it is given by
the sporting press gentry.
On the basis of past times, Spencer has
