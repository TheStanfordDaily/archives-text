# Big Meet
## 
### 
It's the Big Meet for most of us tomorrow. The annual track contest
with California and the other things, like the baseball game, which go
with it, provide the second greatest athletic orgy of the year for the student
body and the public, the Big Game, of course, being the Great Entertain
ment.
Stanford is pretty proud of its track and field team this year. As a
team, it is rated one of the strongest dual meet aggregations in the United
•States, and as performers, the individual members are so capable that
already a victory for the Cardinal in the 1.C.4-A. is being predicted. Of
a defeat over California tomorrow, 110 one has doubt. In 1921, 1922, and
1923, the Golden Bear had its day, with a number of "wonder" track teams
winning for it; since 1923, we have been having ours.
What the Stanford student body is most interested in speculating upon
at this stage of the season, however, is how many points the Cards will
win at the 1.C.4-A. and how many Stanford men will be numbered among
the United States competitors at the Olympic Games. As to the first, some
statistical soul has already figured more than forty.
Three Cardinals on the present varsity appear to be fairly certain of
places on the American Olympic team. They are Ward Edmonds, Eric
Krenz, and Bob King. The high jump, the weight events, and the pole
vault will be strengthened with these men competing. Whether others, like
Fred Zombro, Kim Dyer, Bud Spencer, and Ross Nichols will get to
Amsterdam is yet to be seen.
