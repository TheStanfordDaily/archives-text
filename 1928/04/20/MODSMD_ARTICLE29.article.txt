These one hundred percentists begin to gall when they reach the point
of making attempts to restrict such organizations as the Actors' Equity
Association to Americans, thereby barring artists of the caliber of George
Arliss. It might be said that there is some excuse in this particular situ
ation, due to the recent "England for English Actors" movement, but that
is based on a weak reason for both sides are taking a selfish, narrow point
of view.
The American situation is this: Thirty-nine members of A.E.A.
signed a petition which was printed in Equity, the association's magazine,
asking a revision of their constitution to bar aliens from holding office in
the organization, having a vote, or being employed by it. If the move is
successful it would drive out two of the association's most influential
members, George Arliss, councillor for Equity, and Grant Stewart, editor
of the magazine and recording secretary. It is thought the petition was
aimed directly at these two men. Arliss is an Englishman, and Stewart, a
Scot.
In the case of commodities, there is some reason for protective tariffs
and such things, and when countries are at war it is quite essential that
all the citizens back their respective governments, but when professional
societies commence to establish the principle of protective patriotism, they
are cutting their own throats. Scientists of various branches, medical men,
and others have developed international organizations, and through this
means are able to keep themselves in touch with the work accomplished in
the different parts of the world.
Similar co-operation is beneficial to musicians, actors, artists, and all
people in the various art professions. They need to be kept "on their toes,"
as the pep-talk executive might say. Certainly it is to be hoped that Actors'
Equity will not change its constitution to conform to such a narrow, bigoted
attitude as that voiced in this petition.
