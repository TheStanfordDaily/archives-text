"The Baby Cyclone"—President.
A jolly comedy is Baby Cyclone, a
jolly comedy. Imagine an enormous Pe
kinese pup, weighing all of a pound, bear
ing up under the fierce name of Cyclone.
And this, if you please, is the chief actor,
conspicuous by his silence.
Three couples, one about to go down
to the sea in the ship of matrimony, the
other a year on the voyage, and the third
way out past the horizon, become so ex
cited, involved, and tangled up over the
ownership of the long-haired pup that
they are almost shipwrecked by this same
Cyclone.
Show Recipe for Bliss
And best of all we know now the
secret formula for marital bliss. Should
the wife become irate, hysterical, or go
into a fit, ready to scream or jump out a
window, reach for the hat, put it on, and
out you go, returning some five hours
later to find God's in his heaven and all's
right with the wife.
This very light and extremely witty
farce guarantees three acts of continuous
laughter for everyone, dyspeptics in
cluded. Of course one should ignore the
fact that a perfectly good policeman who
dominates the second act, at least the last
half of it, is left high and dry so to
speak. One wonders whether or not he
was awarded a Congressional medal for
digging up the queerest case for the po
lice court yet recorded—two women fight
ing over a very small Pekinese and two

men eacli declaring the dog belonged to
the other man's woman—or whether he
was made to don sackcloth and ashes for
arresting one of New York's millionaires
and his fiancee.
Plays Difficult Role
Elizabeth Forrester as the hysterical
Jessie Hurley, who could reel off more
baby talk to Cyclone in five'minutes than
we knew existed, fdled a difficult role
extremely well. Hers is a pose in the
play and she conveys this idea to the au
dience, which is an accomplishment. In
contrast to Jessie Hurley is Lydia Web
ster, played by Enid Markey. She, the I
want-what-I-want-when-I-want-it sort of
person, wages a miniature war over Cy
clone and finally wins in a compromise.
Miss Markey gave an excellent portrayal.
The two principal masculine leads,
taken by Kenneth Daigneau and Thomas
Chatterton, were cleverly done. Daigneau
had the task of being the tempestuous and
yet most zealous husband, who was
"damned sure God didn't watch over Cy
clorte," as Jessie would have him believe,
and who likewise believed Jessie about
the only person in the world. Chatterton
portrayed the calm and as yet unruffled
bachelor.
Fast, breezy dialogue, a good cast, a
complex plot which by its complexity
provides rollicking funny situations, blend
to make of this a delightful night's en
tertainment.

to the sea in the ship of matrimony, the
other a year on the voyage, and the third
way out past the horizon, become so ex
cited, involved, and tangled up over the
ownership of the long-haired pup that
they are almost shipwrecked by this same
Cyclone.
Show Recipe for Bliss
And best of all we know now the
secret formula for marital bliss. Should
the wife become irate, hysterical, or go
into a fit, ready to scream or jump out a
window, reach for the hat, put it on, and
out you go, returning some five hours
later to find God's in his heaven and all's
right with the wife.
This very light and extremely witty
farce guarantees three acts of continuous
laughter for everyone, dyspeptics in
cluded. Of course one should ignore the
fact that a perfectly good policeman who
dominates the second act, at least the last
half of it, is left high and dry so to
speak. One wonders whether or not he
was awarded a Congressional medal for
digging up the queerest case for the po
lice court yet recorded—two women fight
ing over a very small Pekinese and two

men eacli declaring the dog belonged to
the other man's woman—or whether he
was made to don sackcloth and ashes for
arresting one of New York's millionaires
and his fiancee.
Plays Difficult Role
Elizabeth Forrester as the hysterical
Jessie Hurley, who could reel off more
baby talk to Cyclone in five'minutes than
we knew existed, fdled a difficult role
extremely well. Hers is a pose in the
play and she conveys this idea to the au
dience, which is an accomplishment. In
contrast to Jessie Hurley is Lydia Web
ster, played by Enid Markey. She, the I
want-what-I-want-when-I-want-it sort of
person, wages a miniature war over Cy
clone and finally wins in a compromise.
Miss Markey gave an excellent portrayal.
The two principal masculine leads,
taken by Kenneth Daigneau and Thomas
Chatterton, were cleverly done. Daigneau
had the task of being the tempestuous and
yet most zealous husband, who was
"damned sure God didn't watch over Cy
clorte," as Jessie would have him believe,
and who likewise believed Jessie about
the only person in the world. Chatterton
portrayed the calm and as yet unruffled
bachelor.
Fast, breezy dialogue, a good cast, a
complex plot which by its complexity
provides rollicking funny situations, blend
to make of this a delightful night's en
tertainment.

"The Baby Cyclone"—President.
A jolly comedy is Baby Cyclone, a
jolly comedy. Imagine an enormous Pe
kinese pup, weighing all of a pound, bear
ing up under the fierce name of Cyclone.
And this, if you please, is the chief actor,
conspicuous by his silence.
Three couples, one about to go down
to the sea in the ship of matrimony, the
other a year on the voyage, and the third
way out past the horizon, become so ex
cited, involved, and tangled up over the
ownership of the long-haired pup that
