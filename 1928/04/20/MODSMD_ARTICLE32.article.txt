## REGARDING THE QUESTIONNAIRE 
### 
Approximately one thousand question
naires, having to do with various mat
ters, were distributed Wednesday night.
These are now being tabulated, and the
results will be available for Monday's
Daily.
This group of questions was made up
by the Daily as a partial check on the
reaction of the campus to different issues
of the day, and as such should provide
some interesting if not entertaining sta
tistics.
The thousand copies of the question
naire were divided up between the classes,
halls, and fraternities as nearly in pro

portion as possible.
Because of the limitations inherent in
such an undertaking, the answers can
not be considered more than generally
accurate. An effort was made to reduce
the usual "wise-cracking" to a minimum
by individual distribution, rather than
through the eating groups.
Two or three of the questions suffered
from vagueness, due partly to space limi
tation and partly to our inexperience.
The totals will be made up according
to class and sex. With this as a basis it
may be possible to draw some conclu
sions as to change in ideas from year to
year. If sufficient time is found the
answers will be tabulated according to
major subjects.
