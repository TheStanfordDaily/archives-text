### Cordry Cromwell 
I'm the boy who moves the hurdles
Up and down the field so warm.
I'd really like to "get" that man
Who makes the jokes about my form.
I'm quite the most important man
Of all the many gathered here.
I wield the megaphone, and see—
I nearly always get a cheer!
I'm just another pleasant usher
Showing high-hats where to go.
If you could see beneath my smile
As I argue with some Jo!
So be we mighty men of brawn
Or humble boys whom fame doth cheat
You see it takes us every one
To put the "go" in a track meet.

Big Reward Offered Saturday
for the Following People:
The first wise-cracker that likens a j
track suit to underwear. We have read 1
so many gags on this theme that we'll
pay almost any sort, of bounty for this 1
boy's scalp.
Those rapid looking females who insist
on wearing filmy duds. One goes to the
meet to watch feats of strength, skill. \
and stamina—not to practice self-control. !
The guy who goes out to get an ice
cold bottle of soda and brings it back to
drink as you sit there in the sweltering
sun.
The original fellow who thought of the
idea of paying one buck for a rooter's
ticket.

Proud Hawaiian to Stanford Student— ;
Over in Hawaii we have more dry docks
than any place in the world.
Student—l can sympathize with you—
most of the M.D.'s over here are that
way too.

Cabbage Opinion Column
The Editor, Sir:
1 think that the cover on the Track
Number of "Chappie" is immoral. Who
ever heard of Stanford women wearing
such daring track suits? It's immoral, I
repeat. This University is going to the
Bow-Wows! Wat are you going to do
about it?
