### 
PULLMAN, Wash., April 19. —
(P.l.P.)—Coach Bailey of the W.S.C.
Cougar nine succeeded in splitting the
opening two-game series with Gonzaga
University and is now preparing his team
for the first game of the conference series
with the Idaho Varidals, here on April 27.
The Cougars showed good form in the
pre-season games. Their hitting was
good but failed in the pinches when long
hits were needed. Bailey has three good
pitchers on the squad.
