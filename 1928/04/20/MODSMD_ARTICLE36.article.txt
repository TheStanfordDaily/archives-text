# AND Then Our Little SALLY...
## 
### 
Our track coach is really perfectly
darling. I mean, when 1 heard that the
Big Meet was tomorrow, I simply had to
get an interview. And I found out sev
j eral things that were really amazing, like
broken records and training and ages.
It would seem that the younger the |
j men the easier it is to train them, and
| the more anxious they arc to break I
! records. That is, older people give up
sooner.
! At last I have found out why the run
ners carry little sticks. Still, I don't quite s
understand how one's elbows could inter
; fere with one's knees. But in the relay 1
I wonder why they don't carry it the
same way. It must be because they have
to run differently.
i The most exciting thing is to watch
j them pole vault. 1 mean, the men just
j sort of fold over, like in diving. It is
j extravagant, though, when they have to i
! break so many poles at every meet. They 1
might get something real heavy that
'wouldn't fall: I'm sure the jumpers
; would like it much better.
I think that men who are very religious
| ought to make very good high jumpers,
i I mean, the object seems to be to get off
the ground. But some said that they tied !
| some kind of springs to their legs. But
i of course, I don't believe that.
j Did you ever notice how the men who
| are in weights are always chewing some- j
| thing? That's to keep them from getting
| too excited. Because, even the biggest j
! stars get excited.
I'm beginning to like track better than J
[ anything else because if you get tired of (
I one thing there is always something else
j going on. I hope that Cal gets all mixed
i up tomorrow.
But I do wish that our coach would
stay on the field where we can see him.
I mean, I wish he were on the team.
