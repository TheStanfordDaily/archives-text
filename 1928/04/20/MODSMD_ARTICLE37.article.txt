# CARD WEIGHT MEN GOOD Clean Sweeps Please Dink I.C.-4A. TITLE NO MYTH
## 
### 
The Farm has long been famous as
the training quarters of burly athletes
who can put the shot and throw the
discus, but never has a Stanford
coach had such a satisfying group of
weight men as are now wearing the
Cardinal. It is even rumored that
! "Dink" Templeton, whose favorite
pastime is to make clean sweeps of ,
one or more events in dual or confer
ence meets, is contemplating making
a bid for all five places in the shot in
the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet this year.
This may sound like a pipe dream, ,
but when one examines the records
of the Cards this year and then looks
over the marks made by other shot- J
putters throughout the country, the
dream shows possibilities of develop
ing into a reality.
First of the live Cardinal weight
tossers comes Eric Krenz, who has
heaved the brass ball more than
forty-nine feet in competition during
!the present season, and is conceded
' a first in the Eastern meet.
Next comes A1 Forster, who has
done better than forty-eight feet. Har
low Rothert, whose heave of forty-;
I seven feet seven and three-fourths
j inches was good for but a third in the
Olympic Club meet, is third man of
the Stanford quintet. Herb Fleish
hacker and Stewart Way, both capa
ble of more than forty-six feet, are
the other two Card shot-putters.
There is one fly in the ointment,
however, and that happens to be none
other than Adellman of Georgetown
| University, winner of the 1928 Indoor
I.C.A.A.A.A. ball-heaving event, with a
! put of forty-eight feet two inches. Un
-1 less he breaks an arm or develops
! insomnia or something equally inca-j
I
l pacitating, he should take a place in
j the outdoor meet.
, More women attend the University
of California than any other college
or university. There are 5,690 en
j rolled.
