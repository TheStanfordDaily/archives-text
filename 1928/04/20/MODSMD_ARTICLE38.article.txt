# First Big Meet Held 35 Years Ago; Stanford Overwhelmed By U. C. 91-35
## Present Track Varsity Has Opportunity to Avenge Defeat of 1893 
### 
It is a long step from the first
Cardinal track team to tlie one which
will uphold the glory of Stanford to
morrow. In the first Big Meet, which
was held on the Olympic Club
Grounds, April 22, 1893, the twenty
eight Sons-of-the-Stanford-Red who
composed the varsity were over
whelmed by the California Bears,
91-35.
Such was the result of Stanford's
first track tangle with the University
of California, but the 1928 varsity will
without doubt avenge that crushing
defeat. And please remember that old
saying which goes, "He who laughs

among the events, but one can scarce

sight of several husky young colle
gians walking enthusiastically around
the track and earnestly trying not to
break into a ruiv
Back in those "good old days" nei
ther Stanford nor California had
championship material. The times
were slow and the distances far be
low the Eastern collegiate records.
How vastly different is the situation
now, with the prospects of several
Cardinals being entered in the Olym
pic Games. Truly, the old grads can
not say, "Now, in my day," with scorn
in their voices.
