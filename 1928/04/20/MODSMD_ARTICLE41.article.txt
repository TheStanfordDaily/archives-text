# CARD BOXER, DIVERS, WATER POLOISTS ARE OLYMPIC PROSPECTS
## 
### 
Stanford has five men in the field
of minor sports who are likely Olym
pic Games prospects, according to the
present outlook. One boxer, three
divers, and a water polo expert make
up the list of probabilities.
Pete Desjardins, *31, who success
fully defended his title as national
diving champion last month for the
fourth consecutive year, will undoubt
edly represent the United States in
the springboard events. Dave Fall,
doing graduate work at Stanford now,
holds second honors for platform div
ing from the last Olympic Games. He
and A1 White, world's champion and
former Stanford student, will be logi
cal choices for the fancy aquatic
work, although no official action has
been taken as yet.
Reggie Harrison, poloist of the first
rank, was unofficially given first
choice by the swimming committee
to go on the second team to Amster
dam next summer. This action has to
be formally passed on by the Olympic
board before it becomes effective.
Phil Smith, special student, won the
right to go to Boston for the final
Olympic Games tryouts by defeating
King Jamison of Oakland in three
rounds on April 12 for the heavy
weight title.
Word was received last week by
Coach Ernst Brandsten that his ap
pointment to the position of head div
ing coach of the American Olympic
tema has been formally approved.
