# BEAR MENTOR PICKS TALBOT TO DEFEAT CARDINAL CAPTAIN
## 
### 
"California has nothing to fear from
any of Stanford's quarter milers." Coach
Walt Christie, veteran Bear mentor, was
speaking, and in one sentence he summed
up his ideas as to just how Lank Talbot
will fare against Captain Bud Spencer
of the Cards.
"Of course Stanford will win the
meet," he continued, "but California may
be counted upon to take some firsts."
Either Carter or Cherry will beat the
Cardinal miler, McKinnon, Christie said.
The California coach smiled as he
thought of the 880. Vantress, he declared,
will have no trouble with Templeton's
hope in that event, McGuire. Thus Mr.
Walter Giristie shoots holes in any the
ory which says that Stanford is due to
cop all firsts in the Big Meet tomorrow.
And in a certain Mr. Curtice, Christie
declares he has the man who will ruin
the Cards' chances of making a clean
sweep in the spear throwing contest to
morrow. Last year Curtice was unable
to show because of a bad arm, but his
appendage is in great shape now.
'I hen too, as Christie pointed out, track
stars are temperamental. No one can say
definitely just what will be done in any
event until that event is finished.
