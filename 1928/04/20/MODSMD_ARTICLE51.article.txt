# FRESHMAN ATHLETES HAVE GREAT RECORD FOR MAJOR SPORTS
## 
### 
Having successful seasons in three of
the five major sports, the Class of 1931
presents one of the most promising ar
rays of first-year athletes in the history
of the institution.
Playing listless games during the early
schedule of the football season, the year
i lings showed their true ability when they
came back from a 22 to 13 defeat by
U.S.C. to win from the Bear Cubs. The
California freshmen had won from the
U.S.C. frosh by a large margin earlier
in the season. Entering the Little Big
Game on the short end of the odds, the
Card Babes trounced California by a
| 25 to 7 score.
Flashy Hoop Five
Receiving their only defeat of the sea
son in the California series, the freshman
quintet turned in one of the most per
fect records ever made by a Cardinal
cage team. The star freshman five de
feated California in two of three games
to win the first Stanford-California
freshman basketball series since the game
has become a competitive sport between
I the two universities.
After starting the freshman baseball
season with a string of victories, the
team went into a slump that lasted
throughout the remainder of the sched-
I ule. Rain postponed half the practice
games and only seven contests, all of
which were victories, were played. A
strong California freshman outfit took
the series in two straight games.
Without the services of John Doeg,
ranking player, who was East for the
Davis Cup trials, the Stanford frosh
dropped the final match of the year to the
Blue and Gold team. The freshman team
won all its earlier matches with a clean
sweep of the games.
Track Team Strong
The track team proved to be the
strongest outfit placed upon the cinder
track by a freshman class when it turned
in victories in all the meets of the year
by over 50 points. Taking nine of the
fourteen first places, they defeated Cali
fornia 91 2-3 to 39 1-3. Hec Dyer was
the luminary of the meet, winning three
first places in the 100- and 220-yard
dashes and the 220-yard low hurdles.
Captain Maynor Shove led the field by
five yards in the 440-yard dash.

dents on small salaries is being carried

Having successful seasons in three of
the five major sports, the Class of 1931
presents one of the most promising ar
rays of first-year athletes in the history
of the institution.
Playing listless games during the early
schedule of the football season, the year
i lings showed their true ability when they
came back from a 22 to 13 defeat by
U.S.C. to win from the Bear Cubs. The
California freshmen had won from the
U.S.C. frosh by a large margin earlier
in the season. Entering the Little Big
Game on the short end of the odds, the
Card Babes trounced California by a
| 25 to 7 score.
Flashy Hoop Five
Receiving their only defeat of the sea
son in the California series, the freshman
quintet turned in one of the most per
fect records ever made by a Cardinal
cage team. The star freshman five de
feated California in two of three games
to win the first Stanford-California
freshman basketball series since the game
has become a competitive sport between
I the two universities.
After starting the freshman baseball
season with a string of victories, the
team went into a slump that lasted
throughout the remainder of the sched-
I ule. Rain postponed half the practice
games and only seven contests, all of
which were victories, were played. A
strong California freshman outfit took
the series in two straight games.
Without the services of John Doeg,
ranking player, who was East for the
Davis Cup trials, the Stanford frosh
dropped the final match of the year to the
Blue and Gold team. The freshman team
won all its earlier matches with a clean
sweep of the games.
Track Team Strong
The track team proved to be the
strongest outfit placed upon the cinder
track by a freshman class when it turned
in victories in all the meets of the year
by over 50 points. Taking nine of the
fourteen first places, they defeated Cali
fornia 91 2-3 to 39 1-3. Hec Dyer was
the luminary of the meet, winning three
first places in the 100- and 220-yard
dashes and the 220-yard low hurdles.
Captain Maynor Shove led the field by
five yards in the 440-yard dash.
A hunt for better living conditions for
young faculty members and graduate stu
dents on small salaries is being carried
