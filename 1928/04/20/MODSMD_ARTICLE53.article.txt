# INITIAL JUNIOR PROM HELD IN 1899; MANY DANCES ON PROGRAM

Just as the sanctity of the law steps
is an institution at Stanford, so is
Junior Week. And just as there is
this Junior Week there is the Junior
Prom.
Going back through the annala of
Junior Proms at Stanford, one of the
first ones was held on March 24, 1899.
This early in Stanford history Junior
"Week" was a day, with many
events preceding the Prom. On the
Prom programs for that year there
were scheduled twenty regular dances,
two extras, and two grabs.
Prom Held in May
Twenty years later the Prom was
held in Mayâ€”perhaps to avoid a re
currence of the rainfall which marred
the 1599 Junior Day. The dance was
in Encina gymnasium. To quote from
a "Daily Palo Alto" of that time,
"One-steps will be favored at the
Prom; nine out of sixteen dances be
ing one-steps, with five fox-trots,
while two waltzes will be thrown in
for variation. 'Eats' will be imported
from San Francisco."
In 1920, specific decorations were
made to create an Arabian effect. This
seemed to start an era of competition,
each succeeding class trying to outdo
the other. For in 1921 on May G, the
Court of King Arthur was established
in the Encina gymnasium. All the
Knights and Ladies of the Round
Table were there. The orchestra was
on a pavilion in the center of the
floor resembling a pavilion in a tour
nament.
Pavilion Dedicated
The following year the class of '23
dedicated the new Pavilion with its
Junior Prom. The decorations fea
tured Springtime. Brilliant streamers
hung from a gabled canopy over the
center of the floor. An indirect light
ing system controlled a battery of
colored reflectors.
The class of '24 evidently believed
in having no delay between dances.
Lettered cards were placed on booths
around the pavilion to help partners
locate each other. For variation sup
per was served on the tennis courts.
Tropical Motif
In 1924 and 1925 the Proms were
given against a tropical smugglers'
island as background, and a Japanese
Pagoda, respectively. In the latter,
programs were card cases of Oriental
brocade. Russia, with blue panels,
white ceiling and candelabras, fea
tured the 1926 Prom.
The "Enchanted Forest" was the
scene of the 1927 Prom. Giant spiders,
toadstools, and frogs were painted on
the walls between trees. A waterfall
effect was placed behind the orches
tra.
The Junior Prom of 1928 will be
held May 11.
The University of California Alumni
Association, with a membership of 20,000,
claims to be the largest organization of
its kind in the United States.
