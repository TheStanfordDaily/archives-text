# McCABE SAYS SEVEN YEARS DEMONSTRATE WORTH OF C.M.T.C.
## 
### 
"Seven years have demonstrated
the value of the Citizens' Military
Training Camps," declared Lieuten
ant-Colonel E. R. Warner McCabe,
U.S.A., head of the Stanford Military
! department, explaining the growth
and increasing popularity of the year
ly summer encampments.
"Proof of the increasing desire of
young men to receive the training is
the fact that seven years ago the first
camps trained only 10,000 men. Last
year almost 40,000 were admitted and
another 20,000 were turned away,"
Colonel McCabe said.
Aim to Develop Manhood
"The military feature is by no
means the chief aim of the camps,"
he continued, "rather the purpose is
; to develop the manhood of the nation
by bringing together the young men
on a common basis of equality and to
inculcate the principles of self-disci
pline and obedience to proper au
thority."
The courses of training contemplate
a full term of four summers, although
there is no obligation either to con
| tinue the C.M.T.C. course or enter
I any other military service, the Col
| onel said. The first year, or basic
course, has a minimum of military
training and a maximum of athletic
and recreational activities. During the
1 successive three years the military
! training is progressive, with the ob
ject of fitting the student for a com
mission in the Officers' Reserve Corps,
j should he desire to take the examina
tion after further study.
Pay All Expenses
All expenses of attending the camp
are defrayed by the Government.
Food, uniforms, cots, blankets, ath
letic equipment, laundry service, and
railroad fare to camp and return are
supplied to students.
Enthusiastic endorsement of the
C.M.T.C. training has been given by
leaders in all fields. President Cool
idge and thirty-two Governors have
sent their sons to camp. Indorsements
for the camps include letters from
athletic coaches at more than forty
nationally prominent colleges.
I Results of a personal canvass show that
| the students of the University of Red
lands believe "studying interferes little
I with college education."

"Seven years have demonstrated
the value of the Citizens' Military
Training Camps," declared Lieuten
ant-Colonel E. R. Warner McCabe,
U.S.A., head of the Stanford Military
! department, explaining the growth
and increasing popularity of the year
ly summer encampments.
"Proof of the increasing desire of
young men to receive the training is
the fact that seven years ago the first
camps trained only 10,000 men. Last
year almost 40,000 were admitted and
another 20,000 were turned away,"
Colonel McCabe said.
Aim to Develop Manhood
"The military feature is by no
means the chief aim of the camps,"
he continued, "rather the purpose is
; to develop the manhood of the nation
by bringing together the young men
on a common basis of equality and to
inculcate the principles of self-disci
pline and obedience to proper au
thority."
The courses of training contemplate
a full term of four summers, although
there is no obligation either to con
| tinue the C.M.T.C. course or enter
I any other military service, the Col
| onel said. The first year, or basic
course, has a minimum of military
training and a maximum of athletic
and recreational activities. During the
1 successive three years the military
! training is progressive, with the ob
