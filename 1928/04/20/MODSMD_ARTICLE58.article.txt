# Dope Contest Ends At Noon Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tomorrow noon, at the zero
hour, just before the pistols be
gin to spit out their short, stac
cato barks on the Stadium track,
the Daily's Big Meet dope con
test will close. The dope should
be in the Daily office at noon,
whether sent by mail or turned
in by the dopester.
Tlie coveted prizes offered by Palo!
! Alto merchants have furnished incentive j
for twenty would-be prophets of the {
results of the Big Meet in The Daily's j
Dope Contest. About thirty-five students 1
submitted estimates last year in a simi- !
| lar contest, and the indications are that j
i the mark will be bettered this year.
The prizes as previously announced j
are: first, a ten-dollar merchandise or- j
j der given by Roos Brothers; second, a j
i $7.50 pair of shoes from Thoits; and!
! third, a five-pound box of College-Maid
j chocolates, donated by Wilson's. In addi
j tion Morey's Smoke Shop is giving a
I carton of cigarettes as a special women's
I prize to be awarded to the woman who j
I submits the most nearly correct guess ;
l which does not win any of the first three j
1 prizes.
If tiiere is any woman on the campus
j who smokes (and the Daily makes bold j
j to presume there is), she is a cinch to I
! win the carton of cigarettes, as no guesses j
| have yet been received from anv of (he !
500.
