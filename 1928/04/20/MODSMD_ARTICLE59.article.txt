BOY, THE LINIMENT
It will not be a very sprightly bear i
that will come down to Stanford to
morrow to run and jump while the
Indian beats the tom-tom; neverthe
less, the Big Meet will not lack inter
est. Track is a performance of indi
viduals, and if the competitors are
picturesque, then the meet is worth
watching.
The 440, for instance, will be a
curious race, in that the two op
posing captains will vie therein.
Bud Spencer beat Lank Talbot
last year, but Coach Walter Chris
tie has said Talbot can beat any
Stanford quarter-miler, by gosh.
We, however, espect to see both
Spencer and Morrison lead the
California skipper to the finish.
Somehow it is hard to imagine a
llig Meet as being dull. Only about
eight records out of fifteen are due
It) be broken tomorrow, and those by
Stanford men. If they should be
wrecked, then California would hold
but one record —that of 9 4-5 seconds
in the 100-yard dash.
God grant that these stiff after
noon winds we have been having
may die down —just for tomorrow.
* * *
We are pleased to note in pass
ing that a track victory tomorrow
would place Stanford on the high
pedestal dedicated to The Win
ner of a Majority of the Five
Major Sports in California-Stan
ford Competition. Football and
tennis have come our way. A win
tomorrow would establish once
again our superiority.

This youth Harlow Rothert is about
the most remarkable athlete the Uni
versity has had since Ted Shipkey.
Tomorrow he will compete in the j
Hhot-put and high jump only, but he
might throw the javelin and discus if j
lie chose. He may take second in the j
hich jump, for last Saturday he was

discovered for the first
time, by Dink Templeton to ;
he doins 5 feet 10 inches ,
■while just "fooling around."
Dink promptly signed him j
up for the Big Meet in this 1
event.
Rothert has done 47 feet
7 inches in the shot-put, 180
feet in the javelin, and 130
feet in the discus. He is
considered the best punter
on the varsity football
team, is captain-eiect of the
basketball team and ac

proved during his sopho

Clifford Pearson Hoff- \

da high school on athletics I

pretty good student, at that, j
considering the fact that j
he has been engaged in j
footbal land track since he |
was a freshman.
We wonder what Hoff
man had to say to the |
eager Alamedans about the |
relationship between schol- I
arship and athletics. One 1
jx-rfectl yapparent bearing |
which grades have upon
participation in sports is «»
eligibility. That is a bogey 1
which drives the C-minus '
student-athlete wild. $
Yet there is another way |
in which scholarship affects |
athletics. The man who |
habitually neglects liis aca- jf
demis work for movies and *
cards following an after- ! |
noon's football practice is |
less likely to improve his |
playing than a man who I
studies conscientiously his 1
assignments or the game |

the intelligent athlete with \

picturesque, then the meet is worth
watching.
The 440, for instance, will be a
curious race, in that the two op
posing captains will vie therein.
Bud Spencer beat Lank Talbot

This youth Harlow Rothert is about
the most remarkable athlete the Uni
versity has had since Ted Shipkey.
Tomorrow he will compete in the j
Hhot-put and high jump only, but he
might throw the javelin and discus if j
lie chose. He may take second in the j
hich jump, for last Saturday he was

discovered for the first
time, by Dink Templeton to ;
he doins 5 feet 10 inches ,
■while just "fooling around."
Dink promptly signed him j
up for the Big Meet in this 1
event.
Rothert has done 47 feet
7 inches in the shot-put, 180
feet in the javelin, and 130
feet in the discus. He is
considered the best punter
on the varsity football
team, is captain-eiect of the
basketball team and ac

BOY, THE LINIMENT
It will not be a very sprightly bear i
that will come down to Stanford to
morrow to run and jump while the
Indian beats the tom-tom; neverthe
less, the Big Meet will not lack inter
est. Track is a performance of indi
viduals, and if the competitors are
picturesque, then the meet is worth
watching.
The 440, for instance, will be a
curious race, in that the two op
posing captains will vie therein.
Bud Spencer beat Lank Talbot
last year, but Coach Walter Chris
tie has said Talbot can beat any
Stanford quarter-miler, by gosh.
We, however, espect to see both
Spencer and Morrison lead the
California skipper to the finish.
Somehow it is hard to imagine a
llig Meet as being dull. Only about
eight records out of fifteen are due
It) be broken tomorrow, and those by
Stanford men. If they should be
wrecked, then California would hold
but one record —that of 9 4-5 seconds
in the 100-yard dash.
God grant that these stiff after
noon winds we have been having
may die down —just for tomorrow.
