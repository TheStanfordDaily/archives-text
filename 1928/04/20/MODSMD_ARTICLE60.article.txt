Spectators at the Meet tomorrow will
witness the performance on the track of
more than a half dozen prospective mem
bers of the United States track and field
outfit which goes to Amsterdam this
I summer for the 1928 Olympic Games.
Eric Krenz, Stanford shot and discus
' star, heads the list of local candidates,
j His marks in the weight events this sea
| son make him the best of the West. Ross
I Nichols, with a mark of 14 3-5 seconds
'in the 120-vard high hurdles, is Stan- i
j ford's strongest candidate for the barrier j
dash. His performance this year indi-J
i cates that he is likely to smash a record J
when he is pressed with greater compe
tition than he has seen thus far. Bob
King has earned for himself the title of
the best high jumper in the country with j
his mark of six feet six inches.
Spencer Is Candidate
Captain "Bud" Spencer has run the 440 :
in 47 4-5 seconds and is the leading can
didate the West has to offer in the one
lap event. Ward Edmonds is well worthy
of notice with his pole vaulting. He
crossed the bar at 13 feet 7 inches in the
Olympic Club meet and barely missed
establishing a new world's record in Los
Angeles when the Cards met the Trojans.
In the broad jump Fred Zombro
j and Kim Dyer will probably be members
|of the United States team. Both men i
have held the record of the Coast Con- ;
ference at one time or another. Zombro
set a new Coast record with a jump of
24 feet 10 inches. J
