# CARDS LOOM AS NATIONAL NET CHAMPIONS
## Herrington, McElvenny Star As Stanford Takes Coast Title 
### 
Stanford's hopes for another nation-'
|al athletic championship seem well- |
' founded as a result of the clean sweep !
! made by the varsity tennis team in the
i Southern Division of the Pacific Coast
j Conference on a recent tour.
Beginning with the University of
| Southern California, the Cardinals have
i in ruthless fashion mowed down the best
| players from the strongest universities in
' the state. The most brilliant perform
! ances have been made for Stanford by
' Alan Herrington, first singles player, and
Herrington and Ralph McElvenny, first
I doubles combination. In the doubles Her
rington and McElvenny, third ranking
national intercollegiate combination, have
! defeated every collegiate combination of
j note in California without the loss of a
! single set.
Beat Occidental Pair
In the national collegiate last summer,
! the Stanford pair reached the semi-final
! round where they fell victims to their old
rivals, GorchakofF and Craig of Occi
dental. The Occidental pair lost in the
finals to Van Ryn and Appel of Prince
ton, and were ranked second nationally.
With longer experience on grass courts,
| McElvenny and Herrington improved
rapidly and two weeks after the inter
collegiate matches eliminated the title
holders, Van Ryn and Appel, in three j
sets at Longwood. Throughout the win
ter the Cardinal champions have been j
working specially on their doubles game.
A former point of weakness, Herring-1
ton's overhead game, has been remark- j
ably strengthened, adding greatly to the
effectiveness of the team. New national
intercollegiate honors should come to
these two players when they make a trip
east in June.
Herrington Wins
In the singles, Herrington has won
recognition as the outstanding individual
college player of the Coast. In the Stan
ford-Occidental match he defeated Ben
jamin Gorchakoff, third ranking national
star, in straight sets. In the four-way
tournament held during the spring vaca
tion at Los Angeles, Herington emerged
as winner, defeating Bob Laird, U.C.L.A.
star, on the slippery cement courts in the
tion at Los Angeles, Herrington emerged
national collegiate ranks, an dwith his ex
national collegiate ranks, and with his ex
ent form, lie bids to defeat all comers in
the 1928 competition at the Merion Crick
et Club in June.
