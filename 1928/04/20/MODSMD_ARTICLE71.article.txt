# WARNER LOOKS GLOOMY AS COAST TITLE IS PREDICTED
## SOPHOMORES UNTRIED Cards Outclass Conference Opponents in Football Material, Power 
### Milton Silverman 
A virtually intact Stanford eleven
which cornered one conference cham
pionship and tied for another offers
tittle comfort to the six Pacific Coast
Conference teams that battle against
the Cardinals in 1929.
Not only has Pop Warner at his call
virtually all of a team which demon
strated a one-point superiority over
ihe Pittsburgh Panthers, but also gal-
I loping around the practice field last
j season was a complete sophomore
| team. Only a few of these sophomores
saw action in conference games, and
a goodly number of excellent pigskin
artists with three years of future
football playing are left.
Tough Schedule
Stanford has not an easy schedule.
At least one could scarcely term
! teams from the Olympic Club, Ore
gon, and Santa Clara as set-ups. And
1 in spite of the fact that once again
■ U.S.C. has lost all but two of her grid
' heroes, the Redshirts need never
I worry about being tfiven a good, rous-
I ing welcome when they play tag with
the Trojans in the Los Angeles Coli
seum.
L Add to this list of playmates Char
lie Erb's sturdy rock-crushers from
L Idaho and Bagshaw's Huskies, and
Pop has sufficient time to get the
Cards in fair shape for the California
blood-session. If the Stanford team
• survives to and through a post-season
| game with the Navy or Yale or W.&J.
( ! or such, it will be a great testimony
. for the superb and unselfish labors
I of the junior managers.
Material Plentiful
Not that Stanford hasn't enough

men. Pop can afford to sluff
off a score of good backfield
men and still have enough
left to pas salong as far as
the fourth team. With Cap
tain Hoffman and Smalling
learning how to be full
backs, Pop may see fit to
insert Fleislihaeker and
Rothert in the shoes of a
quarterback.
Hill and Hyland, and
Murphy and Patchett leave
gaps to fill, but they will be
filled, judging from spring
training reports. Who will
fill the gaps is something
else, but there are Wilton,
Sims, Frentrup, Clark, Sim
kins, Riese, and Taylor
hanging around.
McCreery, Freeman Gone
MeCreery and Freeman
have left their football ca
reers for sign-painting and
gymnasium-blasting.
Walt Heinecke is pre
dicted to do bigger anil
finer things in the approach
ing season. If he plays cen
ter, he will destroy the
hopes of Cook and Vermil
ya. But if he plays tackle,
he will disgruntle an entire
squadron of potentialities
Sellman will return for his
last year as first-string
tackle.
Both Robesky and Post
have signed the tryoutee
list for guard. The latter
especially is expected to
rank high in the "yardage
gained" column in the Sun
day sport-sections.
Plenty of Ends
And at ends will be Da
vidson, Harder, Muller,
Preston, and Vincenti, al
lowing Warner consider
able choice.
Furthermore, there will
be tlie vestiges of 1931. But
one can't tell about fresh
man football players. Some
times they get on the var
sity and sit on the bench
all season, and sometimes
they go out for dramatics.
Meanwhile in the battle
camps of Mr. Warner's
energetic colleagues begins
construction work on the
wrecked machinery left by
the riotous season of 1927.
Down in the bulrushes of
Los Angeles, Papa Jones is
grooming a certain youth,
Moses by name, to do for
his famous backfield what
Jesse Hlbbs is hoped to do
for the line. Moses, or some
other doughty gentleman,
will have to fill the eleated
bootB of Morley Drury and
Morton Kaer before him. A
fairly difficult job.
And at California, the
alumni aro crooning over
the possibilities of one Gar
rity, who may evolve into
the long-awaited Blue and
Gold hope. Washington has
"Chuck" Carroll, who last
year took his sophomorie
characteristics to heart
and rammed fifty-odd point
victories down the throat
of Husky opponents.
