Garnering two first places, two sec
ond places, and a third in the first
five events of the annual interclass
tournament, the Class of 1931 has
piled up such a lead over the rest of

the yearlings will maintain their fore
position through the remaining two
sports to an ultimate championship.
The Junior Class is second, with the
sophomores third, and • the seniors
last.
Interclass tennis will get underway
this afternoon when the freshmen

1:16 flat.
Frosh Pitchers Good

from other classes. A first-rate pitch
