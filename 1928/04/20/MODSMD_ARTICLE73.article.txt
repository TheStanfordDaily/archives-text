# FROSH DEMONSTRATE PROWESS OVER CUBS IN MINOR ATHLETICS
## 
### 
By losing to California in only one
of the five minor sports in which they
have competed with the Blue and
Gold so far this year, Stanford's
freshmen have shown unusual ath
letic prowess.
The Cardinal yearlings showed
themselves unbeatable in the aquatic
events, winning both the swimming
and water polo meets with the Cali
fornia babes. In the former the Stan
ford men took every first place and
broke one record. The final score was
56 to 12.
The water polo team shut out their
opponents completely, winning 12 to 0,
despite the fact that they were using
two men who had not played with
the team up until two weeks before
the meet.
In soccer, however, the Cardinal
babes did not fare as well. After tak
ing most of their early-season games
by small scores, they were defeated
by the California Cubs 2 to 1 in the
first tilt, and could do no better than
tie them at one-all in the second.
ters contributed largely to the year
ling success in this event.
