# INTEREST IN BIG MEET LIES IN POSSIBILITIES FOR RECORD BREAKING
## 
### 
Although interest does not run high as
to the results of the ensuing Big Meet,
there is a great deal of debate as to how
many records will be broken and who
will break them.
All marks now held by the University
of California, except Phil Barber's 9 4-5
seconds achievement in the century, are
in considerable danger of being exceeded
by the Card athletes, and several in pos
session of Stanford men should be im
proved.
Hank Coe, lanky Card two-miler, last
week bettered the old record of 9 min
utes and 43 seconds, held by Stevens of
I California, by an even eight seconds and
is due to repeat this Saturday.
Several times during the season the
Redshirt vaulter, Ward Edmonds, has
cleared 13 feet 6 inches and on one
trial nearly negotiated the world record
of 14 feet 2 inches. According to the
dope, he should easily smash the existing
record of 12 feet inches, held by
Hill of the Bears.
The third record now held by the
Bears, which should go by the boards
Saturday, is the 6 feet 4)4 inches jump
held by Maker of Berkeley. Bob King
has leaped 6 feet 6 inches this spring, and
will not surprise by surpassing the old
mark.
Eric Krenz may come through with a
record heave in either or both the shot
and discus. The big boy has approached
the old distances on numerous occasions
and is now in excellent shape to uncork
a long throw.
