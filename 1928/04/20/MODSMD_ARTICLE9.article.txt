"Herbert Hoover is a man who prac
tices what he preaches, a a real executive,
and a real administrator," said Irving
Rosenblatt, Stanford freshman debater,
in the contest with the University of Cali
fornia freshman team in the Little The
atre last night. The question was "Re
solved, That this house prefers Herbert
Hoover to Alfred Smith for President
of the United States," Stanford uphold
ing the affirmative, and California, the
negative.
The negative team based its argument
on the point that Smith's experience and
training as Governor of New York state
made him the man best fitted for the
presidency. "He knows poitical machina
tions, and in this, we believe, lies his
superiority over Hoover," said Miss Eliz
abeth Wilson, first speaker for Califor
nia. Situations which he will face in the
presidency, he has already learned to face
in New York, she added.
Government relation to business, and
the prohibition question, were two vical
points in the Stanford argument. "It is
because we believe that Hoover meets
these two issues fairly and unflinchingly
that we support him," said Wadieh Shib
ley, Stanford speaker. Smith, the af
firmative pointed out, bases his popu
larity on his anti-prohibition views; and
diametrically opposed to Hoover, he fa
vors government control of industry.
"We have come to recognize Hoover,"
said Shibley, "as a great humanist and
as a man of achievement.
Other California speakers were Larry
Wilson and Adrian Kragen. Harry Gir
vetz was the third speaker for Stanford.
By a special request of the University of
California, 110 decision was made on the
debate. Professor Harold Shepherd, of
the Stanford Law School, presided.
