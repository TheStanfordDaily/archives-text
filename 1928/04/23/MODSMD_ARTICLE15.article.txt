# 'Lots Of Glory, Not Much War' Is Stimulus For Military Ball Friday
## 
### 
The glory of war —or rather lots of
glory and not much war —was the real
stimulus of the Military Ball held last
Friday evening in the Pavilion. At
any rate, Scabbard and Blade, who
sponsored the dance, proved that Mr.
Sherman was not altogether right in
his famous assumption.
One of the most interesting fea
tures of the evening proved to be the
decorations, which created a weird
atmosphere of another planet. The fu
turistic eye of the decorator, Jack
Craig, of San Francisco, conceived
Martians who battled invaders with
lightning and who rode on giant sky
wheels; buildings of unearthly size
between which giant air-trains wove
in and out; hordes of warring air
ships. dirigibles, and planes foreign to
our earthly categories crossing under
sky bridges built in space. Various

and changing shades were cast on
this strange world by a lighting tech
nique of super-excellence.
And Rube Wolf was there to in
spire fun and to autograph programs.
That is all that need be said about
famous Rube; his orchestra was con
ducted, before he arrived, by Herb
Meyerinck of the Cliff Lounge, San
Francisco.
G. Darwin Peary, formerly a player
on the Keith, Pantages, and Orpheum
circuits, and who is now attending
Stanford, gave an acrobatic stunt for
the entertainment of the dancers.
The patrons and patronesses were
Col. and Mrs. E. R. Warner McCabe,
Major and Mrs. John Kellihcr, Cap
tain and Mrs. M. W. Pettigrew, Cap
tain and Mrs. Frank J. Atwood,
Lieut, and Mrs. Charles Whit more,
and Lieut, and Mrs. Sanderson.
