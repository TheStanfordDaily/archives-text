# CARD NINE DEFEATED BY CALIFORNIA SQUAD IN LAST SERIES GAME
## Garibaldi, Sims Make Two Tallies for Stanford; Final Score 3-2 
### 
Inability to take advantage of the
breaks and poor base-running cost
the Cardinal varsity baseball nine the
last game of the series with California
3-2 here Saturday. Gus Nemechek, the
hoodoo of Stanford ball teams, saved
the day for the Bears in the ninth
when he replaced Jacobson in the box
after the bases had been loaded with
but one out, and retired the Card bat
ters to end the game.
Gene Kern was on the mound for
Stanford, and, though not quite in
winning form, he hurled fairly good
ball until the seventh when Lewis re
lieved him. Kern walked four of Coach
Zamloch's men, and was touched for
seven hits. Lewis, accorded excellent
support in the fielding department,
was in control of the situation during
the remaining three innings.
Stanford's first tally was marked up
in the fourth chapter when Garibaldi
singled, stole second, and came home
on Maguire's double down the third
base line. Sims made the other tally
in the sixth when he singled, ad
vanced to second on Levin's one
bagger, and scored on the next play
when Maguire was thrown out at
first.
