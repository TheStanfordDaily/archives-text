# SEVEN RECORDS TOPPLE AS CARD TRACKMEN DEFEAT GOLDEN BEARS
## Eric Krenz, John Lauritzen Are Double Winners In Weights, Sprints; "Bud" Spencer Runs 48 Flat Race To Win From Talbot 
### BOB SPEERS 
VTUMEROUS silk-lined, hand-embroidered, steam-heated niches in Stanford's
Hall of Fame are being carved today for certain young men of Coach
Dink Templeton's Cardinal varsity following its sterling performance Satur
day while trouncing California's Bear 90!/ 2 to 40/ 2 .
The laurel wreaths for seven Card-U.C. meet records came to rest on the
heads of Stanford men Saturday, and with the falling of the old marks, every
Big Meet record save one was placed under the Stanford banner. California
had held best marks in the century, the two-mile, high jump, and pole vault.
Now only the time of Phil Barber remains unsullied.
Captain Bud Spencer's 48 seconds flat in the 440, Ross Nichols' 14 4-5 sec
onds in the 120-yard low hurdles, Hank Coe's 9 minutes 38 1-5 seconds in the
two-mile, Bob King's 6 feet 5 1-8 inches in the high jump, Ward Edmonds'
13 feet 6 inches in the pole vault, Eric Krenz's 154 feet 6 3-4 inches in the
discus, and Kim Dyer's 24 feet 1 1-4 inches in the broad jump proved that
Templeton has this year the greatest bunch of performers ever seen here.

or on the Coast, for that matter, and
Fred Zombro, with three trials yet to
make in his try for a new record, was
forced out because of a strained ten
don in his leg.
Bud Spencer's locomotive-like gait
delivered the goods in spite of the
rosy predictions of Walt Christie and
others who hailed Lank Talbot as the
long-legged Card skipper's conqueror.
It was a thrilling race to watch, and
Spencer's beautiful stride was alone
worth the price of admission. Johnny
Morrison's pluck battle for a second
justifies recording, too. That boy is
bound to be in a class by himself be
fore long.
Johnny Lauritzen, Stanford's hope
in the short sprints, proved to be
more than a hope as he boomed
across the finish for firsts in the 100
and the 220 with even times in both.
Ward Edmonds continued his heart
breaking series of attempts at the
world record in the pole vault, and
came close enough on his second try
to get a gusty gasp from the assem
bled multitude. Eric Krenz sailed a
little higher into the horizon of Olym
pic possibilities with his two firsts in
the weights, just as did the rest of
the boys who soared into the lime
light with sparkling times and dis
tances.
