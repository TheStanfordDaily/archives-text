# SEVEN RECORDS TOPPLE AS CARD TRACKMEN DEFEAT GOLDEN BEARS
## Eric Krenz, John Lauritzen Are Double Winners In Weights, Sprints; "Bud" Spencer Runs 48 Flat Race To Win From Talbot 
### BOB SPEERS 
VTUMEROUS silk-lined, hand-embroidered, steam-heated niches in Stanford's
Hall of Fame are being carved today for certain young men of Coach
Dink Templeton's Cardinal varsity following its sterling performance Satur
day while trouncing California's Bear 90!/ 2 to 40/ 2 .
The laurel wreaths for seven Card-U.C. meet records came to rest on the
heads of Stanford men Saturday, and with the falling of the old marks, every

It was a thrilling race to watch, and
Spencer's beautiful stride was alone

Morrison's pluck battle for a second
