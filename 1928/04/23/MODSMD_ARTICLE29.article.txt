The result of four days of tedious tabulating may be seen on the
right. The statistics, in a general way, represent a cross section of
Stanford undergraduate opinion, and as such arc interesting if not par
ticularly valuable.
The Hoover victory was as ample as it was expected. On the
subject of the candidate's stand on prohibition, the vote was almost split,
a slightly larger number regarding the matter as unessential. This is not
so significant as the decided opinion expressed on the religious issue.
This, we believe, may be interpreted most favorably, indicating, as it does,
a prevailing freedom from religious prejudice and intolerance.
As has been the case in the past with respect to the more intelligent
groups, the opinion was strongly in favor of American participation in
the League of Nations. This preference has a substantial value, as
the League is not a particularly live issue in this country at this time.
American intervention in Nicaragua did not meet with entire ap
proval. Apparently the "definite responsibility" policy outlined by Presi
dent Wilbur earlier in the year failed to justify itself in student opinion.
Among the more interesting totals are those having to do with the
marrying age and prohibition. Stanford students very evidently prefer
to postpone the fabled joys of the marriage state until they are several
years out of the University. The concensus of opinion on the prohibition
question was definitely for modification of the existing situation. The
result in this case, we believe, be approximately the same if a national
collegiate vote was held.
Some of the best material in this questionnaire can be obtained by
tracing the graduation in opinion through the various classes.
The Daily appreciates the interest and attention given these questions.
