# G. B. Shaw and College
## 
### 
George Bernard Shaw, who has ideas on most any subject one wishes
to bring up, himself included, wrote a letter to a freshman at the
University of Michigan, telling that youth a few of his thoughts about
college. The letter says:
"I think,that college life makes a man a mucli better citizen because
it is a communal life and therefore trains him for human society. College
graduates, like sailors, are very superior to merely domesticated persons in
point of sociability.
On the other hand, college training is intellectually and morally ruinous
except to the very few people who have a natural aptitude for its subjects
and a strong and indiscriminate memory for all sorts and scraps of infor
mation; this, with certain technical tastes and no more values —no con
science, in short.
"Except in cases where a college degree is an indispensable qualifica
iton for some contemplated professional carecr a college student should
make the most out of college by reading what he likes and discussing it
at students' clubs (if there are any except drinking and sporting ones) and
doing the least minimum of dry work to secure a pass, or even retire
without one—short of being kicked out. But every case is peculiar, and
cannot come under any general prescription. Travel if you can afTord it,
preferably on foot and fourth class."
In a few words, Shaw's letter states that college is a fine place to
become sociable, but a man with a conscience shouldn't try it, unless he
is going into a profession requiring a degree, and in any case, he
should read a great deal of what he likes, and cut the dry prerequisites
to a minimum, and then travel. Most of this has been said plenty of
times, and has become trite, but when we're studying to make that "A"
grade, we're apt to forget there are other things.
