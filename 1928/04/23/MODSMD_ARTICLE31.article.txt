Saturday, Coach Dink Templeton's runners, throwers, and jumpers
took a big bite at the Golden Bear and got a healthy chew. 'Tis rumored
that Dink is a bit disgruntled at not having better the total points record,
but with a score of 90 1-2 to 40 1-2 most of us are satisfied.
Added to the weighty score, the Stanford team placed seven new
Stanford-California records, and in so doing brought all of them to
the Farm, except the hundred-yard dash. These were performances of
which to be proud.
Now, the big question comes back about the 1.C.4-A., and the
Olympics, things look even brighter for the Card aggregation than when
the subject was mentioned last week. Krenz, Edmonds, and King can
hardly miss both affairs, and Captain Bud Spencer, Nichols, and West
linve only the obstacle of the college competition to set a little more dope
in their favor. Zombro and Dyer ought to cause a lot of worry to other
broad-jumpers hoping for a trip to Amsterdam.
But whether or not any of the men run another race, jump another
jump, or throw another gadget, they can rest assured they participated
in one of the best meets Stanford and California rooters have witnessed.
