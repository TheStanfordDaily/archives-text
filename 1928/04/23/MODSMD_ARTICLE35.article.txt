# LINE-UP IS ANNOUNCED FOR PRESS-DAILY TILT TO BE PLAYED MAY 6
## Dope Thrown Into Uproar By Recent Importation Of Quist Brothers 
### 
Carl Oliver and Jim Frank, mag
nates of the Press and Daily baseball
teams, have, after much hesitation,
announced their respective lineups for
the Press-Daily ball game to be
played May 6.
Although the Press won last year
the recent importation by the Daily
of the famous Swedish stars, the Quist
brothers, GusMalm and Carl Win,
throws the dope into an uproar. An
other point in the Daily's favor this
year is that the Daily's assistant bat
boy, Jack Hodges, will be given full
access to the enemy's diamond.
Oliver announces that the Press has
so many stars that it is impossible
for him to give more than a tentative
lineup this early. The Press team has
been practicing daily and as yet only
a few sore arms and heads have de
veloped. He declares that if the game
proves as one-sided in the early in
nings as it did last year he may loan
the Daily some of his players in order
to make it interesting.
The lineup of the two teams is as
follows:
Daily—Frank, c; Winquist, p;
O'Meara, lb; Silverman, 2b; Gould,
3b; Cochran, ss; Peck, If; Mansfield,
cf; Speers, rf; Malmquist, bb; Hod
ges, sbb.
Press —Barnes, c; Palmer, p; Wag
ner, lb; Ware, 2b; Williams, 3b; Mc-
Donald, ss. These players are sure of
positions on the team, though a few
changes may be made on the day
of the game. As to fielders, the Press
lias so many stars that only results
shown in practice will make those
who will play eligible.
