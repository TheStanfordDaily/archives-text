OSLO, Norway, April 22. — (U.P.) —
The only foreign menace to American
supremacy in the pole vault in the
Olympic Games at Amsterdam was
removed definitely today when the
Norwegian Sports Association de
clared Charley Hoff a professional.
Hoff, who formerly held the world's
record for pole vaulting, sought re-;
instatement in Norway despite his ad
mitted professionalism in the United
States. The sports association here
decided Hoff had forfeited his ama- I
tour standing.
