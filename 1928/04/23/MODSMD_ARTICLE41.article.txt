# THE 						EIGHT WONDERS OF THE SPORT WORLD
## 
### Feg Murray 
The word "Strength," composed as
it is of seven consonants and one
vowel, is most appropriate for the
ruggedness and power that it implies.
Taking each letter in turn, and using
it to begin the name of a champion
in some sport, and including each of
the most important or popular sports
once, we find that the lone vowel,
the weakest link in the chain of let

ters, stands for the only woman cham
pion used. And she can laugh at all
the S's T's, R's, N's, G's, and H's in
the world because, in proving herself
the greatest swimmer of her sex the
world has ever seen, she surpassed
all mere man's records for crossing
the English channel.
Sullivan, Thorpe, Ruth, Ederle,
Nurmi, Gotch, Tilften, and Hagen
represent fighting, football, baseball,

swimming, running, wrestling, tennis,
and golf, and while it may be that
there have been stronger fighters,
ballplayers, runners, and so forth
than the eight athletes selected, the
above octet forms an unbeatable com
bination, and in the success of the
individual, strength, either of body or
of mind, has played a pre-eminent
part. What if Nurmi does look frail,
and is noted for his rhythmic running
form above all things? Where would
his records be if he didn't have a
great hidden power in his lungs and
heart, and easily seen strength in his
hips and legs? Stamina, the will to
win, and a love of the game they
played all have had a part in the

success of these "eight wonders of the
world of sports," too.
Another combination follows:
Sandow, probably the strongest man
that ever lived.
Thompson, Earl, world's champion
hurdler.
Ross, the "Big Moose" of swimming.
Exterminator, the race horse that
goes on forever.
Nelson, "Battling," plenty of strength
here.
Grange, the Red Terror of the grid
iron.
Tolley, one of the hardest hitters in
golf.
Hornsby, six-time batting champion
of the National League.
