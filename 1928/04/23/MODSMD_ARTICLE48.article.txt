## 
### 
With ninety per cent of the engrav
ing completed and all of the borders
printed for the 1928 Quad, Herbert
Reynolds, editor, announced yester
day that the major portion of the
book will go to press next week.
This year's book will be the first to
devote a part of the Administration
section to research problems being
conducted at Stanford. Novel lay-outs
of pictures Avill contribute much to a
special Year Division of the forth
coming edition. The humor section,
always popular on the campus, is
titled "Bawlout," The theme to be
used in this section is the circus side
show.
Reynolds stated that the book is
further advanced for this time of the
year than most previous Quads have
been. A few more copies of the book
are still available out of the number
reserved for those who have not been
able to make early reservations.

American college students are the
best-dressed students in the world is
the opinion of Dr. Earnest L. Talbert
of the University of Cincinnati, after
an extensive study of European col
lege students.
