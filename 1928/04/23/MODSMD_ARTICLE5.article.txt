# CHAPARRAL OFFERS CUP TO STANFORD'S FOOLISH FRESHMAN
## 
### 
Freshman contributors to
Chaparral will have their last
opportunity to compete for the
silver cup offered hy the Ham
mer and Coffin Society to "Stan
ford's Most Foolish Freshman"
in the May Number of Chappie,
the deadline for which has been
set at next Tuesday, April 25.
At the same time the winner of
the cup is decided, the Society
will elect its new members.
A wide range of comic ma
terial is anticipated for the May
Number inasmuch as no particu
lar subject will be featured. The
Old Boy has adopted the policy,
"Anything Funny Goes."
In addition to art work, verse,
and two-line jokes, stories of
about two hundred words are
particularly in demand. Also a
good humorous story or parody
of about fifteen hundred words
is needed. Gags are declared not
necessary for cartoons as the
Chappie jokester staff feels
capable of supplying the accom
panying comic material.
