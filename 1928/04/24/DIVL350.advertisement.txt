of Tobacco

Gentlemen:
The agent while going through his
plunder stored in our baggage room
came across a can of your tobacco, and
account of his not using a pipe lie made
me a present of this tobacco.
You will note the revenue stamp
and your memo which was inclosed.
The tobacco was put up in 1010, six
teen years ago. But it was in good
shape, of remarkable flavor, and was
greatly enjoyed by me.
Thought you would be interested in
knowing how your tobacco held out in
these days of fast living.
Yours very truly,
