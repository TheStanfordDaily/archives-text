# HOUSE SPURNS COOLIDGE PLAN OF FLOOD BILL
## Administration Forces Bow Before Supporters of Hones-Reid Bill President's Supporters Lose By Slight Margin in Congress Vote 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 23. -
(U.P.) —House supporters of the ilood
control bill scored a decisive victory over
Administration forces late today when
they defeated, 73 to 142, two amendments
recommended by President Coolidge as
vital.
They were for New Orleans to accept
responsibility for damages arising from
the construction of the Bonnet Carre
spillway and for southeastern Missouri
and southern Illinois to accept similar re
sponsibility for the New Madrid spill
way; and for the states to furnish the
right-of-ways for all levees, including
those needed in the construction of
floodways.
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 23. —
(U.P.) —Administration leaders fought
valiantly today to carry out President
Coolidge's recommendations on flood
•control legislation but on every occasion
when they clashed with supporters of the
Hones-Reid bill, the Administration
forces went down to defeat.
However, the decisions were so close
that if they are to be regarded as an
indication of strength in case of a presi
dential veto, it is doubtful if supporters
of the bill could summon enough strength
to override the President.
It was thought at first that the House
would dispose of the bill today but so
many amendments were offered with de
mands for roll calls and teller votes, that
it was decided to carry the measure over
until Tuesday.
President Coolidge had contended that
certain large corporations, utilities and
holders of real estate along the Missis
sippi Valley should be made to pay a
portion of the cost of protection, even
if local communities were exempt. A
move to insert this into the bill, made
by Representative Luce, Massachusetts
Republican, was defeated by the scant
margin of 114 to 110. On a standing vote
it was lost only by three.
