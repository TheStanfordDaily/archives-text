"Rules of the house will be relaxed
in the special moving picture perform
ance for the English Club tonight,"
announces Jack Shoup, manager of
the G. and S. theatre at Los Altos,
where the picture will be shown at
8:15 o'clock. "Club members will
leave their hats and decorum out
side."
This performance will probably be
a foreign super-production and is ex
clusively for English Club members
who will accompany the picture on
the organ. Engraved certificates of
club membership will be distributed
to those present at the showing.
Those without cars are asked to
meet in front of the Women's Club
house a little before 8 o'clock tonight,
and cars will be furnished. There will
be special rates at the theatre for the
performance.
