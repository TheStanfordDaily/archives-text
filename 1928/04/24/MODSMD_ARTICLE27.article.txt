# VOLUME TELLS LIVES. ACHIEVEMENTS OF '96
## 
### 
"Stanford '96" is the title of a vol
ume, edited by Sarah Comstock,
which has been published recently,
telling of the lives and achievements
of the members of the Class of 1896
during the past thirty years. Two
hundred and fifty copies were printed,
each member of the class receiving
one. This is the first time that a
Stanford class has gotten together in
a reunion of this sort.
Of the 168 original members, thirty
two are no longer living. Further
statistics tell that of the forty-five
women in the class twenty-seven mar
ried. President Wilbur and Dr. Thom
as A. Storey were members of '96.
