# An Easy Place

### 
The late Rev. Henry Ward Beecher once received a letter from a young
man who recommended himself very highly as being honest, and closed
with the request, "Give me an easy situation, that honesty may be reward
ed." To which Mr. Beecher replied, "Don't be an editor if you would be
'easy.' Do not try the law. Avoid school keeping. Keep out of the pulpit.
Let alone all ships, stores, and merchandise. Abhor politics. Keep away
from lawyers. Don't practice medicine. Be not a farmer or a mechanic;
neither a soldier nor a sailor. Don't study. Don't think. Don't work. None
of them are easy. Oh, my honest friend, you are in a real, hard world! I
know of but one real 'easy' place in it. That is the grave."—Walter Walsh,
London.
