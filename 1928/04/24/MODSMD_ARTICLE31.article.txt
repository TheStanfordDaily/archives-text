# Selling Talks

Last Saturday morning, students who were wending their weary way
home for the finishing touches to the sleep that was so rudely broken into
by that Saturday 8 o'clock, were almost wakened from their lethargy by
strains of music gurgling from a phonograph on the Engineering Corner.
But they fell back to semi-consciousness immediately they discovered it
was merely a hoax to sell the new Glee Club records.
Irrespective of the students who were so rudely interrupted, however,
there seems to have been a mistake about selling those records. It is a
University policy that outsiders may not set up establishments, etc., for
the purpose of selling on the campus. Not knowing of this ruling, Albert
Kulmann, manager of the Glee Club, suggested to Ralph C. Dodson's
music company that a good way to sell some of the records made by the
club would be to play them on the Quad, and have a salesman on hand
to fill the orders.
A single instance of this kind can be of little significance, but the ruling
is a good one, for it would indeed be a nuisance to have hawkers and
vendors of various sorts selling their wares on the Quad any time they took
a notion, particularly if they are not connected with the University or
Student Body.
When student managers wish to sell in this way in the future they
should get the proper authority, in order to avoid later embarrassment.
