The other day a campus student walked into the Union store and made
some purchases, totaling around three dollars. He was about to pay for
the goods with a check, when he was informed that checks over two
dollars could not be accepted. Thereupon, he made out two checks of two
dollars each, took his goods, his change, and walked away very much dis
gruntled, as he had a right to be.
If such a thing were not so comical, it might be tragic—tragic in the
sense that somewhere someone is of extremely low mentality. Now, if
the rule emanating from the charge d'affaires of the Union covers such a
situation, that rule had better be changed if the management doesn't care
to cause considerably more merriment.
However, if the occurrence was merely the result of stiperefficiency on
the part of one of the employees, either the said employee should be given
a little lesson in practical hints for the salesman, or, if this is too much for
his capacity, he might be replaced bv another a bit more advanced.
