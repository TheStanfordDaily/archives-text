## A 						NEW TYPE OF "BLUES" 
### 
American "business ingenuity" has
struck a new high note. Scheming
heads of luxury and entertainment in
dustries, ever alert for something new
and different (preferably sensational),
are willing, it seems, to produce any
thing that will sell. The latest
achievement is an idea whereby one
of these schemers may capitalize on
crimes and tragedies.
A well-known phonograph record
company Is now producing and sell
ing a series of records immortalizing
such gruesome incidences, the most
recent of which is entitled "Little
Marion Parker." As its title suggests
this number deals with the history of
the brutal and better-forgotten Hick
man murder case. In a whiny voice
and simple tune a baritone "sings"
the story of Los Angeles' most fiend
ish murder from the time the "mur
derous villain, a fiend with heart of
stone, took little Marion Parker away
from friends and home." until "they
found poor Marion, her body cold in
death." As the record reaches its wel
come end we learn the moral in
volved, namely, that "We cannot

guard too closely the ones we love
so dear."
This record is to be followed soon
by "The Fate of Hickman." Among
others which have already been re
corded and are now on sale are "The
Fate of Mildred Doran," "The Fate of
Floyd Collins," "The Mother That
Never Came Hack," and "The Wreck
of the Virginian." It seems that any
topic, providing that it is gruesome
or otherwise sensational, is a suitable
i subject for a lyric and the recording
of it for phonograph reproduction.
Now, after our popular headline
murders have been played out by the
newspapers, the record concerns can
i set the court testimonies to music
for the pleasure and entertainment of
"murder fans" or perhaps some in
i genious an dtalented individuals will
j dramatize these murders or write
them into musical comedies.
Thanks to such an idea, we can now
spend a quiet evening at home listen
ing to such enlightening, pleasant,
and classical entertainment. If we
have a radio we can probably request
| our favorite radio jazz-singer to
| "nasal" it for us between prune malt
' advertisements. â€”Carroll O'Meara.
