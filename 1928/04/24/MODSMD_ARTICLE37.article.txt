"Marriage Made Easy." Webster &
Hopkins. Century Co.
The inspired authors of "I've Got
Your Number" were not satisfied by
merely making the inner secrets of
our personalities accessible to parlor
gatherings, but have turned their at
tention to the great social problem of
matrimony. Not only will they pre
scribe the most suitable mate for the
reader, but they go further and ex
plain how to fall in love with the
same suitable mate when it has been
acquired. We are waiting breathless
ly to hear whether a third book will
be written on how to make said suit
able mate fall in love with the
acquiree.
"Marriage Made Easy" should real
ly accompany the well-dressed man or
woman everywhere. No social gather
ing is complete without it —no busi
ness meeting that cannot profit by

its presence. If for instance, you have
had to run for the last train for San
I Francisco, and you find when the con
ductor conies around, that you have
not only neglected to buy a ticket, but
your coin purse is at home in Palo
1 Alto —whip out the little book and the
; weary miles of conversation between
you and the brakeman will be im
measurably lightened—he probably
I has too few of these cultural influ
j ences in his life anyway.
But to bring the book closer home.
: For campus life, it has a very definite
: value. We have spent the last week
in gathering statistics on our ac
quaintances, and we have discovered
an infinite number of valuable facts.
For instance, we now know that for
a prominent and beautiful member of
: the Rally Committee, only the "wisp
of a woman with large wistful eyes"
will serve, though he prefers the "up-

J to-date experienced woman who talks
' back to him." We find that one of our
! campus editors had "better marry a
j woman who likes to be taken to the
theatre, who lives on the surface of
life, is not sensitive," for he belongs
| "to the period of history when women
; were expected to be grateful to be
allowed to live." For another of our
rising young journalists, we find that
I he must look for sense in a woman,
and that he will "probably not be
entirely carried away by the gay little
chorus-girl who made the subordi
nated heart give an unexpected leap."
And so on —it's all in the book. You
too can have the secret of your
j friends' most intimate character de
tails. A word of warning, however —if
you are the one it is being tried on,
be sure and be up on such questions
as, "Do you like cats? Do you like
silence at breakfast? I)o you enjoy
having children climb over you? Does
china that doesn't match distress
you?" If you are in doubt about these
significant issues, you will be abl&
to conceal nothing.
In short, it seems that the campus
j is going questionnaire.
