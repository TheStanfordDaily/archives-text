# COLLEGE MEN PREFER MARY BRIAN TO OTHER STARS OF HOLLYWOOD
## Actress Neither Smokes Nor Drinks; Is Described as Gentle and Mild 
### Ben Maddox, Jr 
Most college men prefer Mary
Brian, when we get r'ght down to i
cases in discusing Hollywood favo- J
rites; and when she came to San ;
Francisco recently to be the principal j
attraction at the annual Press Club
frolic I lost no time getting up to the
Mark Hopkins for a personal inter
view.
Mary herself is even prettier and !
more desirable than she screens to
be. Small, slim, smartly dressed, she :
manages to "drive 'em wild" —the
Stanford "500" please note —by being i
just gentle and mild. She neither
smokes nor drinks, although she re-!
fused to say what others should do. !
She is not an extreme individualist
like Mae Murray or Clara Bow, and
for this reason she seems more real.
Star at Nineteen
To me the most interesting thing !
about Mary is that at nineteen she i
is a world-famous actress. It is a
decided compliment to her character
and "bringing-up" that she is still as j
nice a girl as you'd find anywhere— j
after three years of unexpected fame
and fortune. She came out to Los
Angeles when just fifteen, expecting
to be a painter. But she appeared in
a prologue presentation and Herbert
Brenon and there made her a
star by casting her as "Wendy" in (
"Peter Pan," the picture which also j
introduced Betty Bronson and Esther
Ralston to the public.
Ever since "Peter Pan" Mary has ,
been, and still is, under contract to j
Paramount. She has worked more
steadily than any actress in Holly- j
wood, and although she has not;
shown any amazing emotional ability
as yef, big tilings are expected of her. !
As she has started so young, she has j
an advantage over players who are |
old by the time they achieve promi
nence.
Mary is especially remembered as
the Girl in "Brown of Harvard." I
asked her if she thought William
Haines would last long in a real col- ;
lege if he acted so conceited. "If any
one else did the things he does it :
would seem fresh," she answered, [
"but he can get away with it. I'd like
to do another college picture, but j <
this is such an uncertain business j i
one never knows what will be as- (
signed next."
Heroine of "Beau Geste"
Mary Brian was the heroine of
"Beau Geste," and has played oppo-;
site Richard Dix in three of his films. j
She assured me that "he was a peach i
to work with, and we hope to do an- ;
other picture together soon."
She visited Stanford once three
years ago when she and "Buddy" !
Rogers were doing a picture together,
and he brought her out to his fra- j
ternity house.
"I like to go on location trips, but
they're taking more and more ex
teriors right around Hollywood. And -
as for prop boys"—in answer to a
question as to the opportunities for 1
summer jobs—"they have the hardest
jobs in the movies. They carry around
huge kits and must produce any and
everything at the right moment, as ,
well as remember where everything
was on the set the previous day or
week."
Paramount recently "loaned" Mary
Brian to First National to be "Lil- !
lums" in the film version of "Harold
Teen." I can think of no one who
better suits the collegiate idea of the
perfect "sheba."
