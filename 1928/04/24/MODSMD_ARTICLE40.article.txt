# SPORTS OF 1928
## Better Than Frisch 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
In 1926, Hughie Critz, of the Reds,
j was the fielding sensation of the Na
j tional League, as far as second-base
-1 men went, and in 1927 Frankie Frisch
i coralled the honors for keystone
guardians. Now critics from the
Rhineland are boasting that Hughie
will top them all again in 1928, and
that his stellar work in the training
; season and in the opening games
gives proof that there is not a better
j Fielding second baseman in the older
: circuit. Frisch's fielding average in
! 1927 was .979, while Critz's 1926 mark
was .981, but Frankie had 96 chances
more than Hughie.
Critz, it will be remembered, was a
hold-out during the first part of last
year's race and didn't approach his
j 1926 form until summer. Even at that,
[ he finished the season with a fielding
mark of .969. His batting, never his
j strong point, nevertheless was higher
j than in 1925 and 1926, and while he
J cannot hope to compete with Frisch

or Hornsby on the offense, he can
be, and probably will be, the best de
fensive second-baseman in the league.
He is extraordinarily fast in going in ;
either direction, and it is his ground
covering ability, combined with his
fine work in double plays and speed
on the bases that makes his future |
so unusually bright for one who is I
now in his fifth major league season. ;
Critz, a graduate of Mississippi
A. & M. College, will have opposition
from another university man besides [
Frisch, for Andy Cohen, youthful
Jewish second-baseman of the Giants,
played at the University of Alabama
and is a wonderful fielder. Neither
Hornsby nor Fresco Thompson, sec
ond-sacker of the Phillies, are college
men, but both are finished fielders
and the race between Critz, Frisch,
Hornsby, Thompson, and Cohen for
the title of "best defensive second- i
baseman in the National League" !
should serve as one of the interesting
sidelights of the 1928 season.

more than Hughie.
Critz, it will be remembered, was a
hold-out during the first part of last
year's race and didn't approach his
j 1926 form until summer. Even at that,
[ he finished the season with a fielding
mark of .969. His batting, never his
j strong point, nevertheless was higher
j than in 1925 and 1926, and while he
J cannot hope to compete with Frisch

or Hornsby on the offense, he can
be, and probably will be, the best de
fensive second-baseman in the league.
He is extraordinarily fast in going in ;
either direction, and it is his ground
covering ability, combined with his
fine work in double plays and speed
on the bases that makes his future |
so unusually bright for one who is I
now in his fifth major league season. ;
Critz, a graduate of Mississippi
A. & M. College, will have opposition
from another university man besides [
Frisch, for Andy Cohen, youthful
Jewish second-baseman of the Giants,
played at the University of Alabama
and is a wonderful fielder. Neither
Hornsby nor Fresco Thompson, sec
ond-sacker of the Phillies, are college
men, but both are finished fielders
and the race between Critz, Frisch,
Hornsby, Thompson, and Cohen for
the title of "best defensive second- i
baseman in the National League" !
should serve as one of the interesting
sidelights of the 1928 season.

In 1926, Hughie Critz, of the Reds,
j was the fielding sensation of the Na
j tional League, as far as second-base
-1 men went, and in 1927 Frankie Frisch
i coralled the honors for keystone
guardians. Now critics from the
Rhineland are boasting that Hughie
will top them all again in 1928, and
that his stellar work in the training
; season and in the opening games
gives proof that there is not a better
j Fielding second baseman in the older
: circuit. Frisch's fielding average in
! 1927 was .979, while Critz's 1926 mark
was .981, but Frankie had 96 chances
more than Hughie.
