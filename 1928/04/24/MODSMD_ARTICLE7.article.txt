# German War Ace Calls Flight Of 'Bremen' Great Aviation Triumph
## Flyers Who Cross Atlantic To This Side Meet Bad Storms, Currents 
### Phil Stockton 
j "The flight of the 'Bremen* is a great
I achievement for aviation. Due to the
j direction of the wind currents, Uiose
crossing to this side are forced to fly
directly against the fog banks and storms
I sweeping down from the Arctic and the
I northern coast of Labrador. Of seven
i attempts, this is the only one to suc
! ceed."
The speaker, Baron Karl Friedrich von
Hirschlield-Hagelberg, was one of Ger
-1 many's outstanding war aces, officially
| credited with crashing eight enemy planes
in combat. He was a personal friend of
Von Richtofen, was at Heidelberg with
him, and at the outbreak of the war both
joined the same regiment of Uhlans.
Sees Action in War
Baron von Hagelbcrg saw his first real
action during the big German drive on
Calais in 1915. The enemy launched a
surprise night counter attack, and in the
action his commander was thrown from
his horse and injured. The baron, who
was then in command, had him carried
back to a base hospital, then succeeded
in rallying his troops and repulsing the
attack. During the battle bullets knocked
an epaulet off his shoulder, and another
struck his cigarette case in his shirt
pocket above his heart.
"When Boelke, our greatest ace, was
shot down in 1916 von Richtofen wrote
asking me to join his 'air circus,'" he
said. "I was in the air from then till
near the end of the war, fighting on
patrols over the North Sea, and in the
battles of Flanders and Verdun. Von
Richtofen received his air training in
Boelke's flying circus. When Boelke was
killed he was put in command.
Surround Enemy
"When we came in contact with an en
emy squadron we would maneuver for
altitude and try to surround them. Fail
ing in this, we each picked a foe, and it
was every man for himself. Ihe ideal
position for attack is above the enemy,
j where you can swoop down and rake it
| with machine gun lire.
"At Verdun I was assigned to observe
Hill 98. My duties were to report the
effect of our fire and the troop move
ments. Usually enemy planes would close
| in from behind to cut me off. and it was
i a running fight to get back to our lines.
I My last action was at Flanders, where I
| brought down an American observation
scout.
"We were all very sorry to see Amer
ica enter the war. My mother was an
American. It was your immense supply
of resources and fresh troops that turned
the balance against us," he concluded.
