# PHONOGRAPH RECORD OF STANFORD SONGS MADE BY GLEE CLUB
## 
### 
The first phonograph record made
by the Stanford Glee Club, and one
of only a few recorded by college
glee clubs in the United States, was
formally released yesterday by the
Victor Company and is now on sale in
all music stores.
"Come Join the Band," "Stanford
Forever," "Sons of the Stanford Red,"
and a parody on the "Trojan War-
Horse Song" compose a medley on
the record. "Hail, Stanford, Hail" and
"Alma Mater" are recorded on the
reverse side.
