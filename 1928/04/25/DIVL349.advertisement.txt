Choose a career that fits you
then ft yourself for that career
YOU wouldn't join the first fraternity that gave you a
bid unless you liked it. It should be the same with the
business you entpr — don't drift into it, just because it
"turned up." First, know whether you are interested in a
certain line of work, then fit yourself for it by proper selec
tion of courses, and by reading and observation. Having
made your selection, do not let chance propositions deter you.
Apply this test offitness to the bond business, if you arc
considering it. Because it requires a high degree of training
and ability, the compensation and opportunities for the man
adapted to it are unusually good. It may be just the field
for you.
Assuming that you have made a studied decision to enter
the bond business, the best start you can make is to choose
a conservative, reliable bond house that will provide a sub
stantial background for your own efforts. Ally yourself
with a firm that will take pains to train you for effective
work. In the Halsey, Stuart & Co, training schools, each
new man is given three months' intensive, practical training,
with pay, before being assigned to active duty.
Most of the questions you may have in mind about the bond
business are answered in our booklet, '' The Bond Business
as an Occupation for College Men." Ask for pamphlet abb.
