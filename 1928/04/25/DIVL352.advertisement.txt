IF YOU HAVE "IT"
But folks there is no way in the world to determine whether you do or do not have "IT." j
! without making a SCREEN TEST of you. Recent developments now make possible the making j
! of SCREEN TESTS in almost any town or city, so our Directors and Cineniatographers are j
J going to nearly 100 towns and cities throughout the United States with their cameras, lights, j
| make-up, and everything necessary for making these SCREEN TESTS of you and for you, and j
if ou do have "IT," your TESTS will be submitted to the producers for their consideration. An '
opportunity of this kind has never before been presented, becausc of the formerly impracticable I
methods of making these TESTS outside of the studio. To get a SCREEN TEST made by the I
studios, if you were right here in Hollywood, is almost an impossibility, therefore you can realize j
what this opportunity means to you. Present plans include SCREEN TESTS of ONLY those
' registered in advance. This may be the opportunity of a lifetime. Do not fail to avail yourself of
it. Full information and registration blanks will be furnished FREE UPON REQUEST.
