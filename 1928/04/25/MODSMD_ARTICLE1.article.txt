# BALLOTS SHOW G.O.P. LEAD IN DAY'S RETURNS
## Ohio Primary Is Center of Interest; Regarded as Test of Hoover Five States Chose Total of 369 Delegates in Tuesday Voting 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 24.— (U.P.)—
Five states selected a total of 369
delegates to the Republican and
Democratic National Convention
Tuesday in the biggest political day
of the pre-convention campaign.
Republicans selected 189 delegates
in primaries in Massachusetts, Penn
sylvania, and Ohio and in a state con
vention in Oklahoma.
Democrats selected 180 delegates in
primaries in Massachusetts, Pennsyl
vania, and Ohio and in a state con
vention in Kansas.
Political interest was centered on
the Ohio primary because many poli
ticians regard it as a test of Secre
tary of Commerce Hoover as a presi
dential figure. He never has run for
an elective office and this is the first
primary in which he faced a serious
fight. Fifty-one delegates were at
stake. Hoover was pitted against a
slate of delegates committed to the
late Senator Willis but now predomi
nately for Vice-President Dawes. The
campaign has been one of the most
bitter in recent presidential history
and is regarded as a severe test for
Hoover. Ohio Democrats voted for an
unopposed slate of 48 delegates
pledged to former Senator Atlee
Pomerene with Governor Smith fa
vored as second choice.
Pennsylvania, with 74 Republican
delegates in the balance, had less
significance because the slate is a
hand-picked uninstructed one which
will be controlled by state political
leaders headed by Secretary Mellon.
Massachusetts Republicans selected
39 delegates. Hoover is expected to
receive part of the delegates with the
others uninstructed. The Massachu
setts Democratic delegation of 36
votes will be solidly for Governor
Smith.
Kansas Democrats were choosing in
state convention between Senator
Reed of Missouri and Governor
Smith. Representative Ayers, favorite
son, withdrew at the last minute.
In Oklahoma the Republican state
convention had Senator Curtis of
Kansas and former Governor Lowden
as the principal contenders.
