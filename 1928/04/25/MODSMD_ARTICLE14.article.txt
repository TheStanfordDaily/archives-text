# SENIOR COMMITTEE ON ENDOWMENT TO HOLD MEETING IN OLD UNION
## 
### 
An important meeting of the Senior
Endowment Committee has been an
nounced by Harry Call, chairman, for
tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the Trophy,
Room of <the Old Union. Plans for the
continuance of the personal endow- i
ment drive will be settled. It is im-1
portant that all committee members
be there, he stated.
A large number of pledges have
been reported, according to an -unof- j
ficial check, and a personal canvass I
drive is planned to check over those
seniors either not returning their
cards, or indicating that no pledge
will be made. The drive will insure
to the committee that all seniors
were reached and that those who have :
returned blank cards have definitely
decided not to go on record with the
Class of 1928 Endowment.
The purpose of the endowment is
to provide a fund to which senior
classes in the future may add, and
from which the University may draw
money for emergency conditions;
funds are to be used at the discretion
of the University for the advancement
of education at Stanford.
