# GOLDER TO ENTERTAIN STANFORD FELLOWSHIP MEMBERS INFORMALLY
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Fellow
ship, fulfilling the object of trying to
know professors personally, will visit
Professor Frank A. Golder of the His
tory department informally this eve
ning at 8:30 o'clock.
The Fellowship was begun last
year as an intermediate group of the
Y.W.C.A. and Y.M.C.A., but has gradu
ally worked into an independent or
ganization. Its purpose is to give men
and women an opportunity to come
together on grounds that are not pure
ly social. The three ways in which
this purpose is obtained are: by trips
to professors' homes, thus getting to
know them informally; by day trips
or hikes; and by week-end trips.
No hikes or week-end trips will be
held this quarter, but several are be
ing planned for next fall. A hike at
the Woodside Country Club, and a
week-end trip to Yosemite were held
last quarter. The only organization
of the fellowship is a board of direc
tors, and there is no membership
qualifications since all Stanford stu
dents interested are eligible.
Next week Thursday, May 3, the
members will visit the home of Bailey
Willis, Professor Emeritus of Geo
logy. Since only a limited number of
students can be accommodated, any
one interested is asked to let one of
the following know: Sally Miller,
Morden Brown, Don Alden, Harriet
Cogswell, Ben Culver, Maxine Cush
ing, Tom Drake, Anne Frick, Helen
Huneke, Winifred Huntington, Marga
ret Owen, Stanford Steinbeck, and
James Watkins.
