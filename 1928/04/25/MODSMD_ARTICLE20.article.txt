## Fidel LaBarba, Jack Feeley Judges; Fast Matches Are Predicted Harry B. Smith Will Present Gene Tunney Medals to Winners of Bouts 
### Carroll O'Meara 
Fourteen men will enter the ring in
the Pavilion tonight to compete for
tiie University boxing championships
and the Gene Tuiuiey gold medals.
Seven representative collegiate weight
titles will be decided in the bouts
which begin promptly at 8 o'clock.
In tiie last of the preliminaries yes
terday afternoon three more men won
the right to compete in the finals to
night. Hobson (middleweight) de
feated Mendenhall, Sands (middle
weight) defeated Harold, and Doerr
(welter) defeated Cavitt in an extra
match, their first meeting resulting
in a draw.
Excitement Promised
Seven good bouts are promised by
the entrants in tonight's tourney.
Maurer, Hromadka, and Frost each
won medals in the Novice Tourna
ment last quarter, while a number of
other contestants won their cham
pionships last year. An exciting affair
seems' likely when Hollingsworth
meets Captain Fain in the light-heavy
weight division; both men are medal
holders and were competitors in the
Pacific Coast tourney held recently in
Los Angeles, the latter successfully
defending his coast collegiate title.
It had been hoped that Gene Tun
ney would be able to attend tonight's
tourney to present bis medals, but
word was received from him yester
day by Harry Maloney sending re
grets and saying that he was com
pelled to remain in New York to start
training immediately for his fight this
summer. In the absence of Tunney
his friend Harry B. Smith will pre
sent the 14-karat engraved gold med
als to the victors. Peter Flanigan will
referee the bouts. The judges will be
Fidel Laßarba and Jack Feeley. Fred
Frehe will act as timekeeper.
Following is a schedule of the bouts
