# City or Country?

### 
City or country â€”which shall it be? ihis is a question that almost
everyone has to solve, or at least ponder, some time or another. Believing
the problem would be interesting to his readers, the editor of the Country
man, a little rural journal in England, invited a number of noted English
authors to express their views as to where they could work best.
Arnold Bennett and Ililaire Belloc stated decidedly that it makes no
difference to them where they work. Most of the writers, however, strad
dled the fence to a certain extent. Clemence Dane struck perhaps the
keynote of the majority of opinions when she said, "One is taking mental
cocktails all day long; but the end of a month of mental cocktails is com
plete physical exhaustion." This was referring to working in a city. She
went on, "I am sure that in the end the quality of the work [done in the
country] improves." '
Aldous Huxley, greatly favoring the country, said that the vitality that
is claimed by some to be a consequence of working in an urban district
"seems to me to bear a close resemblance to the great vitality of a dead
frog's leg when an electric current is passed through it." In going further,
he couldn't help taking a dig at us over on this side of the Atlantic, and
added: "The most highly galvanized corpse-cities are, of course, to be
found in America."
John Galsworthy, Havelock Ellis, Sir Oliver Lodge, Ramsay Mac-
Donald, John Masefield, and T. F. Powys all claimed that they were at
their best in the country, Powys stating that he neither worked nor played
in London. Others said they can't work in the country because it is too
beautiful and distracting, some that the city is best for writing, the country
best for reading. George Moore made the statement that "people taken up
from the country to be educated in the towns never return to the country."
All of this discussion was aroused when the headmaster of Westminster
School in London was so rash as to say to his students: "In order to live
your life well, play in the country but work in the town. It is in the great
vitality of the great town's life that the individual is stimulated and com
pelled to think."
Most of these comments have overlooked what may be a point of some
significance. That is, that most of the young writers are in the city, while
most of the writers who live in the country are older people. Does this
mean that after one has worked for some time he realizes that he can do
better in the quiet and comparative solitude of the country, or does it infer
merely that it is necessary to be near the publishers in order to get a good
start, or that the city becomes tiresome, or does it mean anything at all?
Perhaps no one can be absolutely sure of even himself in this regard.
Certainly it would be a valuable thing to know. The chances are that much
of the best work that has ever been done has been under the stress of the
moment, when the author was thinking only of getting the darn thing to
press on time so he could hit it out for the country and sunlight, or the
city and bright lights, depending on where he was at the time.
