# Well Done

Although California rooters wanted their team to make as many points
as possible in the track meet Saturday, no one begrudged Stanford the
stars that it had. In fact ,they were pleased that Stanford may soon claim
several world record holders among its students.
This is partly due to the recognition and admiration bestowed by
everyone, both students and outsiders, of such outstanding performers as
Stanford may boast. But it is more due, probably, to the excellent spirit
of friendliness that has grown up between Stanford and California during
the past few years and which was highly noticeable last Saturday. Whole
hearted cheers of recognition were given by both sides to athletes of the
other. And when King and Edmonds and the other Stanford stars were
trying for record marks there was not a California rooter that did not wish
to see them succeed.
Stanford will go back East this summer with California's best wishes
for success, and it is to be hoped that its track team will manage to break
several national or world records.
