# Up And At 'Em

Yesterday in Chicago a man hustled a little four-year-old girl into his
automobile, held a handkerchief over her mouth, and sped away. The
onlookers were shocked, and one of them, having great presence of mind,
took the license number, notified the police, and told headquarters they'd
better get right on the case. Headquarters did, and found that papa had
just returned home from taking his little girl, Geraldine, to the dentist,
and that he had held the handkerchief over her mouth to keep her from
crying to lustily.
If Chicago would take as much interest in her baby politicians, the
town might not be such a "windy" city.
QUESTION OF ETHICS proposed by the Washington Daily:
"Should the coed retain more than one fraternity pin at one time and
should they be worn on nightgowns and pajamas?"
