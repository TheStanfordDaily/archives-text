"Stanford University, Present and |
Future," Delia Taylor. Stanford !
I
University Press.
This latest output of the Stanford i
University Press is a dignified ver-;
sion of the popular illustrated map. '
Delia Taylor has not only made a j
colorful decoration for the wall, but
has graphically tied up the Utopian
plans for future buildings.
The plans for these edifices that.
"require millions of dollars and years
of building" before "Stanford will at-1
tain its full usefulness" have been
presented in the Illustrated, and vari
ous other magazines, but it is a little!
hard to recognize their nature in j
nebulous form. On this map, however, j
you may specifically locate them — i
from the future Science Quad, Law ;
School, Library Quad, down to the
future Plaza before Toyon and Bran
ner halls. Amusing to note that the
Big Game Bonfire rates a place.
Student Checks Map
We heard that one accurate student
checked up on the map and found two
buildings missing, but we can't locate !
them. The only omission is in the :
way of footpaths here and yon, but
we suppose our favorite trails really j
do not merit a place in the Stanford '
University of the future.
A University map that is informa
tive as well as artistic —and is NOT
collegiate—is a blessing of the gods, i
They are obtainable at the Bookstore. I
Make checks payable to the Stanford
Bookstore! —H.J.K.
James BoswelPs "The Hypochondri

ack," Margery Bailey. Stanford
University Press. Two volumes.
From the little-known files of The j
London Magazine from 1777 to 1753, !
Dr. Bailey has rescued the seventy !
essays written by James Boswell and
published anonymously by him.
"Bozzy," the abused and neglected,
famous for the fame he gave a man
better than himself —readers of Eng
lish literature have wondered that a j
man said to be so trivial could write '
so good a book as the "Life of John- i
son." Even those who are most anx- j
ious to recognize his genius have re-;
garded Boswell as a quaint or comic i
figure.
Gives Life of Period
The essays open a perspective of
Boswell's thinking, his motives, his :
reaction to that dissipated, irresponsi-1
ble life of his, very different from the i
traditional view of his character. In ]
addition, they provide an interesting;
and colorful outlook on the life and i
thought of the eighteenth century. In |
the intimate, confiding presentation
of Boswell's prejudices, illusions, so
cial standards, and political persua- j
sions we glimpse the restless, bustl- <
ing pageant of the important transi- j
tion period in which he lived.
Dr. Bailey's voluminous notes and '
admirable introduction add immeas- j
urably to the interest and value of
the essays. Her edition of "The Hypo- j
chondriack" is the first ever to ap- j
pear, although an English edition j
planned by A. W. Evans was de- j
stroyed by fire before publication, j
when the Stanford edition was some j
months under way. —D.L.
