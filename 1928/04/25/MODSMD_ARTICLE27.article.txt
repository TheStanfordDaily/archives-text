We read the other day of another
humorous statistician who was
lynched in a quite primitive manner.
Hoping for more lenient treatment
we print the following:
If all the faux-pas made during
I men's rushing were tabulated by
' Emily Post, they would still be made.
If all the energy consumed at Roble
Gym were converted into electricity
I and set to run a five-car train, the
; women would be darned glad.
If all the Daily Tryoutees were
weighed before and after tryouts, the
women would object both times.
If all the people who answered the
Daily questionnaire, saying they in
; tended not to marry, could look in a
j crystal globe, they would see nothing
at all. —Betty, *31.

A sorry little group of boys was
singing this the other evening with
long, drawn-out wails:
They took the points; they took our
roll;
They beat us through and throoooo.
We used to be the blue and gold
But now we're only bloooooooooo.
* * *
Oh yes, the speed cop says rushing
j is all right if confined to its proper
place.
