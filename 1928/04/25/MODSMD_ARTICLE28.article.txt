j The Editor, Sir:
I should like to protest about a
1 certain discrimination in Saturday's
| track meet. Why was it that no dog
! was turned loose on our runners? I'm
! sure we could have done much better
! if we had something like this to spur
j them on. I think that we should have
competition always on an equal basis.
Yours in the spirit of sportsmanship
â€”A. Baer.
