# Ellsworth Gives Origin Of Famous Novel Plot In Illustrated Lecture
## "Robinson Crusoe" Declared Great Novelty During Queen Anne's Time 
### 
"Defoe's 'Robinson Crusoe' was as
! great a novelty in Queen Anne's Age
as the telephone or radio in our day,"
said W. W. Ellsworth in a lecture on
"The Age of Queen Anne" last night.
Ellsworth told the story usually
j thought to he the source of Defoe's
I novel of the sailor who was put
! ashore on the island of Juan Fernan
; (lez off the coast of South America
because of the resentment of his
superior officer, and who printed his
' story after his return to London.
However, Ellsworth showed that
j Defoe did not use this story but j
rather one of a Spanish sailor whose
ship was wrecked on the northern
| coast of South America on the island
of Tobago.
"It is hard to think of Dean Swift
as a clergyman," said Ellsworth in
describing this master satirist and :
politician. Illustrating his lecture with I
pictures of the coffee houses, operas, j
main personages of the day, and of j
j the plots of the novels, Ellsworth
i well described Addison, Steele, Gay, !
the Duke and Duchess of Marlbor- j
ough, and Pope, the master poet.
The luxurious life of Bath, where
people bathed from 6 to 9 o'clock in :
| the morning, "they did not swim, for
: no one knew how in those days," and
where each day was a round of teas,
| operas, plays, and halls, were por
trayed by Ellsworth.
