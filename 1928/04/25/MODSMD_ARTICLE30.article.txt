# AND Then Our A Little SALLY...

J Now that all the statistics about
| the people have been published, and
j the San Francisco papers have used
the material on the front page, I
! guess someone had better begin to
j really do something.
I mean, I wish that someone would
explain to me just what some of those
terms mean. Now trial marriage, for
: instance. Why, when people use
| terms like that, we poor girls have
I the hardest time to really under
j stand.
That is, it seems so obvious I just
! know there is something else back
of it.
And the double standard. There are
so many different meanings. Of
course, I think most everyone said
single, because it sounds so much
j more sophisticated and free.
Who really knows what anyone in-
I tends when they are being skeptical?
j I mean, naturally one wonders about
j people but why bother believing the
I worst. That is, I was told to always
| know that the gullible inherit the
j earth, if you know what I mean.
Of course, everyone is agnostic
| about something or other. I mean, re
â–  ligion is all so mixed up that it is
! hard to decide which one you think
is the prettiest.
I wish that a nice person would
| write a book about the troubles of
the modern age and make it possible
for us to look up the answers as if
jwe were taking a course. I mean,
; when there is no text a girl has a
l difficult time to keep things going in
j the proper direction.
