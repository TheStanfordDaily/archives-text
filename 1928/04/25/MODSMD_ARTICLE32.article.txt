# DOG EJECTED FORCIBLY Dragged Off Ignominously TRIES TO RUN TWO-MILE
## 
### 
One of the participants in the Big
j Meet last Saturday was forcibly re
j moved from the field! And it was not
because of unsportsmanlike conduct.
No, indeed. The high-handed action
was occasioned by the fact that the
runner was so filled with enthusiasm
that he insisted on competing in the
two-mile. Had he been allowed to re
main in the race Stanford would
doubtless have had a second place as
well as a first, for he was neck-and
i neck with Henry Coe.
I Big Meet spectators were greatly
I amused to see a perky little bull dog
dash out on the track immediately
after the starter's gun had announced
the beginning of the two-mile. The
racing dog soon overtook Coe, who
was leading, after which he was
satisfied with running by the side of
the Stanford track star and encourag
ing him with playful leaps and joyful
: barks.
However, it seemed that the dog's
well-meant efforts were not appreci
ated. And finally, after eluding two or
three clutching hands, he was
pounced on by an active official and
dragged off in disgrace, probably
! thinking to himself as many others
i have thought before him, that "there
j ain't no justice in this world."
