Fraternity teams walked away with
the majority of honors in yesterday's
intramural baseball play, which
proved to be the most active and ex
citing yet this season, five games tak
ing place at once.
Probably the most important con
test of the day was that between
Breakers Club and El Toro, in which
Perry Taylor, Breakers' pitcher,
again proved his ability in the mound
position by striking out eleven men
and allowing only one hit. This is
the second decisive triumph of the
Breakers Club, which is making a
strong bid for championship honors.
Despite the one-sidedness of the
score the El Toro men were far from
being poor players, as Bush, El Toro
pitcher, struck out seven men during
the five innings. Only one error was
called against the losers.

intramural baseball play, which
proved to be the most active and ex

Probably the most important con
test of the day was that between
Breakers Club and El Toro, in which

the second decisive triumph of the
Breakers Club, which is making a
strong bid for championship honors.
Despite the one-sidedness of the
score the El Toro men were far from
being poor players, as Bush, El Toro
pitcher, struck out seven men during
the five innings. Only one error was
called against the losers.
