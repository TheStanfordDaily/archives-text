# SPORTS OF 1928
## Bon Voyage! 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
When the Aquitania pulled out of
New York on Wednesday, April 18, it
carried among its passengers two of
America's most famous athletes,
Helen Wills, of Berkeley, and Walter
Hagen, of Rochester, N.Y. Although
almost as different as night is from
day, the two have much in common,
and Helen, the amateur tennis player
and artist from the West, will be
hoping that Walter, the professional
golfer and would-be ball club owner
from the East, wins the British open
tournament, while Mr. Hagen will be
rooting for Miss Wills to win the
British tennis championship.
What these two have in common
most of all is that they are both
products of the U.S.A., and when they
win a foreign championship it is a
distinct triumph for the country
which they represent. The fact that
Uncle Sam is "casting his homebreds

. upon the water" at' such an early date
means that lie is out in a serious way
to clean up in Europe in 1928, and this
advance guard of the Athletic Expe-
I ditionary Force is just a sample of
what is to follow. And he could not
have picked on a better amateur ten
; nis player and a better pro-golfer to
represent him than Helen Wills and
Walter Hagen.
Each is a fighter, each is a hard
; hitter, and each is a brilliant shot
maker. Each has campaigned in Eu
rope before, the first time with little
or no success, and on a later trip
covered herself or himself with glory.
Walter Hagen won the British open
title in 1922 and 1924, and only lost
!in 1923 by a single stroke. Helen
Wills won the Wimbledon champion
ship in 1927. She will also compete
in the French championships and the
I Wightman Cup matches.
