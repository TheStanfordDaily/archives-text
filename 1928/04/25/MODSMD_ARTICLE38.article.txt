# TOLMAN WILL REVEAL COMMITTEE FINDINGS ON FAILURE OF DAM
## 
### 
Findings of the committee investi
gating the St. Francis Dam failure
will be discussed and illustrated in a
lecture by Professor C. F. Tolman of
the Geology department here at 7:30
o'clock tonight in the Assembly Hall.
As chairman of the committee ap
pointed by the Department of Water
and Power of the City of Los Angeles
to investigate the failure, Professor
Tolman has first-hand information on
the subject. He will illustrate his talk
with diagrams and photographs show
ing the geological characteristics of
the dam site. There is difference of

opinion as to which side of the dam
went out first. Different geological
formations on the two sides made it
| possible for seepage to weaken the
| ground which supported the dam.
The lecture is being sponsored by
j the Engineering Council of Stanford
j including the Civil Engineering So
! ciety, Electrical Engineering Society,
l Mechanical Engineers, and the Geo
logical and Mining Society of Ameri
! can Universities.
