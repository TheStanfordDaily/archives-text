# NEW WOMEN'S GYM, EQUIPMENT NEEDED SAYS MISS BUNTING
## 
### 
"There is definite need for a new
gymnasium building and new sport
! equipment for Stanford women," de
clared Helen Masters Bunting, head
of the Physical Education Depart
ment. "The inadequacy of the present
buildings and equipment make the
â–  need an urgent one."
Funds, naturally, are essential to
the fulfillment of this need. Money
j has recently been spent for men's
i equipment, and the women should be
! next in turn; new showers and club
rooms would be included in the plans
| of the proposed building, Miss Bunt
ing explained.
"The Physical Education Depart
! ment hopes to establish a teaching
major and minor, and if the project
is carried out, there wilJ be a still
greater necessity for adequate build
ings," states Miss Bunting. In a re
cent survey of the student body to
obtain tangible information as to the
probable registration for the major
or minor, 115 women signified defi
nite interest in the plan.
Dean Elwood Cubberley, of the
Education Department, in speaking
of the project, said, "Physical Educa
tion is needed at Stanford, especially
as a minor subject."
