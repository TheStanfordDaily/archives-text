boxing aside at the end and the round
ended with each man exchanging hard
blows to the body and head.
John Hromadka won, in the light
weight division, a decision over Dick

in his favor. Hromadka took advantage
with a longer reach and broke through his

and wold punches. Doerr went to his
knee once in the last round, which ended
in slugging. Kd Dillon had little difficulty
in defeating John O'Sullivan for the
heavyweight title. He was not hard
pressed to win and did not extend him
self greatly. The loser was downed once
for five counts.
Lester Sands can thank his effective
left jab for his medal and middleweight
championship. He defeated Richard Hob
son after a close three rounds of pol
ished boxing.
The two lightest weight bouts both
ended in technical knockouts in the sec

ended in technical knockouts, they were
all close and winners were not certain
until the very last.
""in the feature bout of the evening Cap
tain Norman Fain defeated Bill Hollings
worth for the light-heavyweight cham
pionship after three rounds of clean, hard
fighting. The first period was about even,
Fain not starting his attack until the
second. The victor had his own way at
the start of the third but both men cast
boxing aside at the end and the round
ended with each man exchanging hard
blows to the body and head.
John Hromadka won, in the light
weight division, a decision over Dick
Gold water after an extra round. Hro
madka appeared the more skillful boxer,
but he faced a tough and stocky op
ponent who presented an excellent de
fense at the start, which was forgotten
in the third in an effort to turn the bout
in his favor. Hromadka took advantage
with a longer reach and broke through his
opponent's weakening defense to win the
bout.
Dan Frost and A1 Doerr, rivals in the
novice tournament, met again last night
in the welter class and staged as thrilling
a bout as before with the result that
Frost won again. The winner had the
first round. Both became slightly groggy
in the second under each other's terrific
and wold punches. Doerr went to his
knee once in the last round, which ended
in slugging. Kd Dillon had little difficulty
in defeating John O'Sullivan for the
heavyweight title. He was not hard
pressed to win and did not extend him
self greatly. The loser was downed once
for five counts.
Lester Sands can thank his effective
left jab for his medal and middleweight
championship. He defeated Richard Hob
son after a close three rounds of pol
ished boxing.
The two lightest weight bouts both
ended in technical knockouts in the sec
ond round. Ed Thayer won the bantam
weight title from Charles Shreves in a
contest which started evenly but ended
suddenly with the loser unable to con
tinue after attempting to launch an ag
gressive attack. Paul Maurer, feather

Jack Jordan. The loser was the better
man in the first, but left his body open
to Maurer's blows in the second round.
