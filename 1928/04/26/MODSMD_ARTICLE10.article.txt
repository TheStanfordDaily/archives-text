# "SOUTH SEAS PREFERRED" TO BE JUNIOR OPERA TITLE
## Story Pictures Adventures Of Collegiates After Having Graduated Plot Offers Wide Field For Specialty Acts, Chorus, Burlesque Skits 
### Margaret Cummings 
"South Seas Preferred" has been
chosen by the authors, Herbert Rey
nolds and Jack Shoup, as the produc
tion title for the Junior Opera. This
will replaced "Ticker Tape," which
has been the working title.
Life as it is found to be immedi
ately after rather than during college
days is the fundamental theme of the
plot. Just what the college youth and
maiden do upon being let loose on
an unsuspecting world after gradua
tion is here portrayed, with some of
the resultant complications possible,
largely humorous.
Dorothy Sheckel and Bob Roberts
are two of these post-college products,
and the difficulties in which they in
volve themselves and those around
them, wittingly and otherwise (some
of which are hinted at by the title),
furnish an enormous field for amusing
situations.
"South Seas Preferred" offers par
ticular opportunity for specialty acts
and choruses, and work is going rap
idly ahead on these features as well
as on the main body of the plot. The
comical and burlesque element will
be played up to considerable extent,
culminating in a sure-fire, guaranteed
to-please surprise ending.
