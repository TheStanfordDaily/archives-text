# To Hold Biology Classes, Field Trips Off Campus
## 
### 
Two Summer Quarter activities
which will be off the campus are the
geology field trips and the work in
biology at the Hopkins Marine Sta
tion.
A geology field trip will be made to
the Ventura quadrangle and adjacent
regions under the direction of C. F.
Tolman, professor of economic geo
logy. The students on the trips make
geological maps and in this way have
mapped a good portion of the state.
