# Edwin Kemmerer, Noted Economist, Will Speak Today On Money Topics
## Lecturer Associated With Harley Lutz in Poland, Chile Researches 
### 
Edwin Walter Kemmerer, reor- j
ganizer of the banking, monetary, and
revenue systems of many nations, and
a member of the Dawes Commission,
will speak in the Little Theatre at'
Stanford at 10 o'clock this morning, j
His topic will probably deal either
with his experiences in reforming the
financial systems of nations or with
the aims of the Stable Money League,
of which he is president.
Dr. Kemmerer, who is professor of
economics at Princeton, is on leave
this year and is touring the country
in the interests of the Stable Money
League, the object of which is to
stabilize the value of the dollar so as j
to eliminate the disastrous rise and j
fall of price levels. He has made in-!
tensive studies of these peaks and j
deep depressions, and believes that
measures can be effected to prevent
them both in the United States and
throughout the world.
His acceptance of an invitation to
speak at Stanford was received too
late to permit a general student as- i
sombly, but some classes will be dis
missed to enable students to attend
his lecture, and all interested are in-;
vited.
