# GORDON DAVIS RETURNS FROM EUROPE TO TAKE CHARGE OF DRAMATICS
## 
### 
The dramatic productions of the
| Summer Quarter have always been
I notable. The fact that many of the
I leading stars of other colleges are at
1 Stanford in the summer, offering
stimulating competition to native
talent, and that training for the Sum
mer Quarter plays is even more in
tense than in other parts of the year
1 has led to some of the summer plays
taking outstanding rank in the his
tory of the campus stage. Assurance
that this will be the situation this
summer is given by the fact that
Gordon Davis, director of dramatics,
will return from his leave of absence
j to take charge.
Davis is in Europe and will select
three plays for production at Stan
ford this summer. With his aids he
will also offer a full course in Thea
-1 tre Workshop and Play Production.
It was not known that Professor
Davis would be back this summer at
the time the Summer Quarter Bulletin
was printed, so that the courses he
will offer do not appear there.
Tentative dates for the presenta
| tion of the three plays to be selected
by Gordon Davis are July 6, July 27,
and August 10.
