# 1928 SUMMER SESSION PROGRAM BALANCED, SAYS JOHN SELLARDS
## University to Offer Wide Selection in Number of Available Courses Director Makes Ready For Largest Attendance in Years of School 
### 
"We have a better balanced pro
gram for this summer," said Director
of the Summer Session John A. Sel
lards yesterday, "than in any year of
the decade since Stanford began to
offer regular university work the year
round.
"This year Stanford will offer in
the Summer Quarter not only a wide
choice for Upper Division and gradu
ate students, but a well-rounded
course for all the undergraduate
courses, including those who are be
ginning their university work.
"We shall have this summer, also,
a richer and more varied and com
plete schedule of lectures and con
certs than ever before."
The attendance this summer, Direc
tor Sellards says, will be at least as
large, judging from the number of
inquiries received, as it was last
year, when with nearly 1400 regis
tered, the enrollment was the highest
it has ever been.
The Law School courses in the
Summer Quarter, Sellards says, are an
indication of the effort that has been
made to provide for all classes, with
courses designed especially for those
taking up law for the first time, for
those who are already registered at
Stanford, and for those who wish to
specialize in particular fields.
Director Sellards called attention
to the fact that the Summer Quarter
will open this year on Thursday in
stead of Tuesday, as announced in
the earlier bulletin, the change hav
ing been made to avoid the confusion
and inconvenience that was caused
by incoming students trying to estab
lish themselves and settle down be
fore there had been time to put rooms
just vacated into order. The closing
date of the term remains as it was.
