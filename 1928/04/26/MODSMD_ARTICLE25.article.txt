# Learning About the University
## 
### 
The Stanford Fellowship, organized this year, receives little space in j
the Daily because its activities are not of a nature that make "news," but j
its purposes and achievements are of great significance in the life of the
University. Formed primarily, as its name indicates, to foster comrade- j
ship among Stanford students, it has naturally developed interest in Stan- 1
ford itself and in the professors of the University.
Members of the group are learning to know their professors as indi-1
viduals and not as lecture machines, to understand them, and to know what
they are thinking. Conducted informally, meetings of the Fellowship bring
students and professors together in a feeling of equality.
They go after information about Stanford and its professors and get
it at the original sources, from those who are best informed about particular
phases, as they did last night when they were guests of Dr. Colder and
last week when they were at President Wilbur's home. Exchange of ideas
and interaction of opinions create mutual understanding and greater appre
ciation, and have a broadening effect for all concerned.
Not an "honor society" and with no exclusive restrictions on its
membership, the Stanford Fellowship welcomes those who are interested
in its projects or who wish to change the character of the group by working
from the inside out.
Two things that need doing this group can do. It can help to stay the
tendency for Stanford students to lose the characteristic Stanford spirit of
personal contact as the University grows in numbers and diversity of
interests; and it can aid undergraduates to fit themselves as alumni who
understand a little better their University through understanding those who
constitute the University.
