# Summer Quarter No Dull Time
## 
### 
Ten years ago the academic calendar was revised at Stanford and in
place of a long vacation period Summer Quarter courses were offered.
Beginning with only a little more than three hundred students and a small
faculty including a bare half-dozen visitors, the attendance had increased
to nearly 1400 in 1927. For the coming summer more than forty members
of the teaching staff come to Stanford from other universities of America
and from Europe.
In addition to the visitors who are here for the entire Quarter, there is
an opportunity in summer to secure distinguished lecturers in many fields
who take advantage of vacation time to visit the Pacific Coast. Public
lectures are of almost daily occurrence and cover many subjects. ITere,
then, is an opportunity to explore new fields and develop new interests.
Stanford undergraduates have a large representation in the Summer
Quarter, and particular care has been taken to meet as far as possible the
requirements of undergraduates who remain, as well as of students coming
for specialized and advanced work.
The Summer Quarter is a part of the academic year, with work and
requirements of the same character as during other Quarters. Many of
the college activities and distractions of other Quarters are lacking, but the
student who remains to advance his standing during the Summer Quarter
will find the campus is by no means a dull place.
