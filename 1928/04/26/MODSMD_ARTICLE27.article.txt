# JURY BLAMES PUBLIC IN ST. FRANCIS DAM DISASTER—TOLMAN
##

"Blame for the St. Francis clam dis
aster was laid by the coroner's jury not
only to the chief engineer in charge and
the engineering board, but to the general
public," said Cyrus F. Toltnan, economic
geologist and chairman of the first com
mittee to investigate the ruins of the darn,
in an illustrated lecture at the Assembly
Hall last night. "One man would not
have been allowed the entire responsibil
ity of final judgment if the public had
been actively and properly interested in
the dam's construction."
"The four investigating committees
were unanimous in saying that weak
foundations caused the break. The dam
itself diil nut fail. Schist on the east side
was made up of laminated planes which
dipped toward the stream and were the
causes of slides. Conglomerate rock was
under the side of the dam which went
out first. It appeared to be a hard rock,
but turned to clay when wet under pres
sure. A large fault under the west but
tress was shown to have slipped, and a
gradual solution of gypsum along the
foundations loosened the contact between
rock and concretc."
