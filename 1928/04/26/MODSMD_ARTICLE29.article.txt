The spring menu of the Stanford Uni-1
versity Press offers an interesting and;
varied selection. Five new titles are listed
for spring, and five for autumn publica-1
tion. "Crossroads in the Mind of Man," I
by Professor Truman L. Kelley, of the
education and psychology departments, is
a study in differentiate mental abilities.
"Stanford Educational Aptitude Tests,"
by Milton B. Jensen, is a series of tests
designed to determine a prospective edu
cator's special fitness for teaching, ad
ministrative work, or research.
Among the more popular books is "Oh,
Ranger," to be issued in May, a book
about national parks by Horace M. Al
bright and Frank J. Taylor. This is the
first complete story of the national parks,
and is a colorful tale of their history, lore,
and traditions. Narrative and incident in j
this book make the unusual combination j
of information and amusement.
"A Brief Anthology of Mexican
Verse," by S. Millard Rosenberg, is the j
only collection of Mexican verse in cap- 1
tivity, and makes the second of the Stan
ford Spanish Series edited by Professor
Aurelio M. Espinosa. A brief anthology
of Mexican prose is also being prepared, j

"The Hypochondriack," a series of |
| Boswell essays, edited by Dr. Margery!
J Bailey, has been reviewed in a previous j
edition of this paper, but merits additional j
| emphasis. Dr. Bailey has rescued from j
| the little known files of the London Mag- [
azine of about 1777, the seventy essays of
Boswell, which were published anony-1
mously. The essays open a perspective of
Boswell's thinking, motives, and of his
reaction to the dissipated and irrespon
sible life of his contemporaries. Not only j
do they provide an interesting and color- j
ful outlook on the life and thought of I
the eighteenth century, but in the inti- j
mate, confiding presentation of Boswell's j
j prejudices and standards, throw new light
on his heretofore obscure character.
The illustrated map of Stanford Uni- j
versity, of the Present, and of the Fu- j
ture, by Delia Taylor, is the most unique >
| output of the Press this year. It is not
| only a colorful and decorative piece of !
work, but illustrates graphically the plans
J for the future Science Quads, Law!
School, etc., that have up till now only
been presented in nebulous form. The
j character of this map makes it amusing
and valuable to past, present, and pros- j
j pective Stanford students.—H. J. K.
