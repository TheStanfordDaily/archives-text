Out of the East, in the stock market
| reports, comes the word that a ciga
| rette price war is in progress in New
York. Manufacturers of three leading
brands have reduced their wholesale
quotations, permitting a retail price
of two packages for twenty-five cents.
Fond fathers will note this and the
daughter's allowance will be reduced
accordingly. Possibly—but not prob
ably ! *
One of the San Francisco morn
ing papers announces proudly
that a reader, who had been
speechless for a number of years,
had her vocal powers restored by
reading its funny paper. The
point was that the funny paper
was so funny that the good wo-

man simply laughed in spite of
herself, and this laugh restored
her to speech.
It is something to be proud of:
that anybody could find anything
to laugh at in the funny section.
The gallantry of the day belongs to
the air. The transatlantic plane,
Bremen, lands on a barren island and
j calls for help. Any number of planes
■ are almost instantly ready to make a
perilous trip of assistance. An air
: hero, half-sick, insists on piloting one
j of the relief planes. He is forced out
I en route with lobar pneumonia. Word
! goes out that a serum is needed if his
i life is to be saved. No sooner is the
message received than a fellow eagle
' whirled away to his aid.
The days of knight errantry fade
jin comparison.
