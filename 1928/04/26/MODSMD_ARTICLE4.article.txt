# DR. WILBUR ADVISES A.W.S. TO CO-OPERATE FOR NEW GYMNASIUM
## 
### 
"The women of the University sel
dom miss an opportunity, but there
is one that they have missed," said
President Wilbur last night at the
installation banquet of the Associ
ated Women Students. "It is the co
operation and earnest effort necessary
to get a new gymnasium."
Dr. Wilbur urged the women to
study all the angles concerning the
situation and to get to be good poli
ticians. "Women need this kind of
experience," said the President.
"Citizenship has opened up new fields
for women. An example of this is the
difference between the present elec
tion in the country due to the women
workers and voters and the elections
of the past."
Eleanor Davidson, retiring presi
dent, spoke modestly of the progress
"she hoped Council had made" in her
administration, and thanked the wo
men for their help in her own charm
ing way. She graciously informed Dr.
Wilbur that she thought "he had
something in his mind."
Janet Harris, newly installed presi
dent, spoke on her recent trip to the
A.W.S. convention in Seattle, and
outlined the work for next year which
the new Council will undertake to
perform. Those ideas which Janet
Harris plans to carry out next year
are a constitutional inspection, an in
quiry for off-campus women, a greater
number of general assemblies, a study
of class privileges, and last and most
important, a new gymnasium.
