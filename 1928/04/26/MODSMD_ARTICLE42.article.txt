# SPORTS OF 1928
## An All-Around Middy 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"Whitey" Lloyd, who has thrilled
j thousands with his exploits on the
gridiron and the basketball courts,
' will attempt to add a new chapter to
j his career next Friday and Saturday
!by competing in the decathlon test I
at the Penn Relays on Franklin
Field, Philadelphia.
To star at football and basketball |
would seem enough for any mortal — j
1 but, no, "Whitey" must go out on I
the track, and instead of doing one j
| event becomes proficient at ten of j
j them. The decathlon consists of the j
100-meters run, broad jump, 16-pound j
I shot-put, high-jump, 400-meters run,
| 100-meters high hurdles, discus-throw,
pole-vault, javelin-throw, and 1500-
meters - run. So you see what
"Whitey' is up against when he faces j
the field for the initial test on Friday. |

Earl Thompson, present United
States Navel Academy track and field
coach, and holder of the world's
record of 14 —2-5 seconds in the 120-
yard high hurdles, believes that Lloyd
will give the other decathlon con
tenders some keen competition.
Thomson has competed in the gruell
ing ten-event test himself, and knows
what it is all about.
Football fans who saw the Navy-
Michigan and Nevy-Army games last
year were shown plenty of Lloyd's
gridiron capabilities, but it was in
the Colgate game of 1926 that he
outdid Frank Merriwell at his best.
With Colgate leading and only a min
ute or so to play, "Whitey" grabbed
a fumble on his one-yard line and
ran ninety-nine yards to a glorious
victory.
