# World's Record In Discus Totters As Krenz Beats Mark With Trial Tosses
## Throw of 161 Feet 2 Inches Weight Heaver's Best Distance of Day 
### 
Eric Krenz broke the world's rec-
I ord in the discus throw in practice
i Tuesday afternoon.
The big weight heaver broke it
three times, in fact. His best toss was
: 161 feet 2 inches, the second best 159
i feet 4 inches, and the third best 158
: feet 6Vi inches. The world mark
which these three eminent efforts put
in the shade is Bud Houser's dis
tance, attained in 1926, of 158 feet
1% inches.
Seven times the curly-headed Stan
ford star threw the platter clear up
onto the running track of the Old
; Oval, where the varsity practices,
i Never has the track taken such a
: beating from discus throwers. Tiny
Hartranft, on one of his palmy days,
is reported to have hit the oval, but
! Tuesday Krenz was hitting it con
sistently, flinging the discus out into
space time after time; he was simply
what they call "hot." There is no
other explanation for the flock of un
heard-of throws.
Krenz's high mark will not go down
on the record books, because it was
not made in official competition. But
from his display of might, there is
; every confidence that he will go down
to the Fresno relays next Saturday
with a chance of shattering the
world's record.
Measurement of Tuesday's marks
was not made with an official steel
tape until yesterday morning. Even
at that, the announced distance fails
to do Krenz justice, for, standing in
the depression where the discus cir
cle is, he was obliged to throw the
discus onto the track opposite, the
latter being 3 feet 5 inches higher
! than the ring. So it is probable that
the discus would have gone anywhere
; from 163 to 165 feet on its longest
: ride, had it been thrown to a surface
I of the same level as the discus ring.
