Finds Right
Tobacco for

Larus & Bro. Co.
Richmond, Va., U. S. A. p
Gentlemen:
Most all well-known tobaccos smoke
well in a cold or temperate climate,
but very few in a tropical climate.
They are mostly too heavy, don't seem
to be blended right—at least that is
my opinion gained from practical ex
perience.
However, Edgeworth is the same in
any climate. Again that is my opinion
gained by practical experience.
I cannot get the same pleasure out
of any brand of tobacco that I can out
of Edgeworth, and I have tried many
—and paid fancy prices, too. It costs
real money to smoke imported tobaccos
here; the import duty is very high.
Anyway, we cannot have everything
we would like in these countries, so we
hold on to all the little pleasures possi
ble. Now you know why I smoke
Edgeworth.
Yours respectfully,
