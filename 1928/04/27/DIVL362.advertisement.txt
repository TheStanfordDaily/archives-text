Youthful, Distinctive
SPORTS WEAR
The young woman at college—she who has
cultivated a taste for better things—sets the
fashion for all the sports-clothed young
moderns. It is for her that our sniartly
youthful, distinctly individual sports apparel
is chosen. That is why such an engaging array
are to be found in misses' sices.
