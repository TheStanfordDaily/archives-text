# CARDINAL NINE TO MEET FAST ORIENTAL TEAM
## East Will Meet West at 2:30 O'clock on Local Field Tomorrow Keioans Made Fourteen Hits Against Strong U.C. Diamond Team 
### 
East will meet West when the
Cardinal varsity baseball team plays
the championship Keio University
nine of Japan here tomorrow after
noon at 2:30 o'clock. The Japanese
team, conqueror of Waseda Univer
sity, last year's champions of Japan,
has proven to be an aggregation of
heavy hitters and should give the
Cards a close game.
Though dropping two games to
California, the Keioans were able to
pound out as many as fourteen safe
hits in a game. Besides California,
the boys from the Orient have played
St. Mary's, the Athens Club, and the
Watsonville Japanese Club, and in
all contests have shown lots of class
in all departments of America's na
tional game.
Still smarting from their defeat by
the Bears last Saturday, the Cards
have displayed plenty of speed in
practice sessions this week. The
Stanford men exhibited more strength
in the batting department in the third
California game than they have
shown for some weeks, and if they
can do as much tomorrow there
should be no doubt about the winner.
Count Sobieski will start on the
mound for the Cards. The Count has
had rather a hard time of it this
year when it comes to winning games.
Against U.C.L.A. on the southern
trip he pitched a no-hit game, but lost
1-0 when his support in the field
weakened and allowed the Bruins to
score a run. Again, against California
in the second game, he hurled good
ball but was beaten 2-1. The rest of
the Stanford lineup will be about the
same —Sypher or Berg, catcher; Ma
guire, first base; Garibaldi, second
base; Laird, third base; Busch, short
stop; Levin, left field; Wilton, center
field; and Sims, right field.
The Keio squad will arrive in Palo
Alto at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning,
and will have lunch at the Cardinal
Hotel, after which the Rally Commit
tee will show them about the cam
pus. Following the game, the visiting
players will be entertained at dinner
at the Stanford Japanese Club. They
plan to leave San Francisco for
Southern California Sunday, and after
playing a few games there to go East
where they will meet Yale and Har
vard and other Eastern university
nines.
Hiashi Kohimoto, coach and man
ager of the Keio team, was a member
of the nine which represented that
university on a tour of the United
States in 1914. During this trip Keio
played a game with Stanford.

in the second game, he hurled good
ball but was beaten 2-1. The rest of
the Stanford lineup will be about the
same —Sypher or Berg, catcher; Ma
guire, first base; Garibaldi, second
base; Laird, third base; Busch, short
stop; Levin, left field; Wilton, center
field; and Sims, right field.
The Keio squad will arrive in Palo
Alto at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning,
and will have lunch at the Cardinal
Hotel, after which the Rally Commit
tee will show them about the cam
pus. Following the game, the visiting
players will be entertained at dinner
at the Stanford Japanese Club. They
plan to leave San Francisco for
Southern California Sunday, and after
playing a few games there to go East
where they will meet Yale and Har
vard and other Eastern university
nines.
Hiashi Kohimoto, coach and man
ager of the Keio team, was a member
of the nine which represented that
university on a tour of the United
States in 1914. During this trip Keio
played a game with Stanford.
East will meet West when the
Cardinal varsity baseball team plays
the championship Keio University
nine of Japan here tomorrow after
noon at 2:30 o'clock. The Japanese
team, conqueror of Waseda Univer
sity, last year's champions of Japan,
has proven to be an aggregation of
heavy hitters and should give the
Cards a close game.
Though dropping two games to
California, the Keioans were able to
pound out as many as fourteen safe
hits in a game. Besides California,
the boys from the Orient have played
St. Mary's, the Athens Club, and the
Watsonville Japanese Club, and in
all contests have shown lots of class
in all departments of America's na
tional game.
Still smarting from their defeat by
the Bears last Saturday, the Cards
have displayed plenty of speed in
practice sessions this week. The
Stanford men exhibited more strength
in the batting department in the third
California game than they have
shown for some weeks, and if they
can do as much tomorrow there
should be no doubt about the winner.
Count Sobieski will start on the
mound for the Cards. The Count has
had rather a hard time of it this
year when it comes to winning games.
Against U.C.L.A. on the southern
trip he pitched a no-hit game, but lost
1-0 when his support in the field
weakened and allowed the Bruins to
score a run. Again, against California
in the second game, he hurled good
ball but was beaten 2-1. The rest of
the Stanford lineup will be about the
same —Sypher or Berg, catcher; Ma
guire, first base; Garibaldi, second
base; Laird, third base; Busch, short
stop; Levin, left field; Wilton, center
field; and Sims, right field.
