## 
### 
An opportunity to study those
phases of geology that are least com
mon in the Coast ranges will be given
to the students of Geology 111 and
103 in a field trip in structural geology
this week-end.
The trip, which will be made by
automobile and will require two days,
will be spent in the field north and
northeast of Redding.
The particular formations to be
studied are the intensely-folded
slates and limestones, and also other
rocks, intersected by dikes and stocks
of diorite, according to Eliot Black
welder, head of the department. There
are numerous placer mines, shaft
mines, and open-pit operations in the
district. These as well as the sur
rounding formations will be observed.
