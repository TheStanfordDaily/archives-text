# Edwin Kemmerer Discusses Future Of Gold Problem
## Speaker Saved Colombia in Dangerous Bank Crisis By Initiating Gold Standard 
### 
"I don't know of anything more im
portant to the world than the produc
tion of gold," said Edwin Kemmerer,
Professor of Economics at Princeton,
in a lecture on "Gold and the Gold
Standard" yesterday. "It is an eco
nomic good, which, different from
most economic goods, if produced on
a great scale, does great social harm."
Kemmerer discussed the gold pro
duction of the future, explaining the
view taken by one school of econo
mists that the supply of gold will
grow less, that no new discoveries
will be made, and that the world will
face a period of falling prices. He dis
cussed the opposite view that there
would be future discoveries, and with
a greater economy in the use of gold
there will be a sufficient gold produc
tion to maintain prices.
Kemmerer, who established a gold
standard in Colombia, and saved that
country during its bank crisis, told
of the run on one of the largest
banks in Colombia just after the gold
standard had been adopted. This bank
kept its doors open from Friday un
til Tuesday noon when it was forced
to close because of lack of gold.
Other runs started, and Kemmerer
decided the only thing to do was to
establish the Central Bank which had
been provided for in the gold stand
ard. In order to do this in time, the
President of Colombia declared a le
gal holiday on Thursday, Friday was
a holiday anyway, and Saturday a
half holiday, so by means of notes
imported by airplanes, the Central
Bank opened on Monday with an im
mense gold supply, and the country
was saved from a panic.
