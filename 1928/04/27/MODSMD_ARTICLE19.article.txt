# LOWDEN NOW LEADING DAWES AS PROBABLE OPPONENT OF HOOVER

WASHINGTON, April 26.—(1 J.P.) —
Those who seek to prevent the nomi
nation of Secretary Herbert Hoover
are looking more than ever to former
Governor Lowden of Illinois.
Until the Ohio primary Vice-Presi
dent Dawes had been regarded by
many as the logical heir of the anti-
Hoover coalition. But his failure to
poll a substantial share of the prefer
ence vote against Hoover in spite of
the fact that Ohio is his native state
and in spite of an aggressive cam
paign for him in the closing days of
the fight has impaired his availability
in the opinion of many here.
Lowden, on the other hand, has un
dergone a genuine rejuvenation as a
result of the smashing of the Small-
Thompson organization. The House
is about to pass the McNary-Haugen
Farm Bill which he has championed.
The fractional vote which President
Coolidge received in the Massachu
setts preference primary indicates
that the voters of his home state
have given up hope of drafting the
President, and the lingering expecta
tion of the anti-Hoover coalition that
it could turn in the end to Coolidge
has all but disappeared. All of which
centers attention on Lowden as the
figure upon which the coalition must
largely depend.
