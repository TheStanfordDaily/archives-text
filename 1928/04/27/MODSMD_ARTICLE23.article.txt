# STANFORD TRACKMEN TO LEAVE TODAY FOR FRESNO RELAY MEET
## Krenz Expected to Shatter World's Record in Discus Throw Athletes Representing Fifty Colleges to Appear At Carnival 
### 
Dink Terapleton and his hand
picked Cardinal track and field outfit
will leave this afternoon for the San
Joaquin Valley and the Fresno Re
lays, which are to be a big feature of
the Raisin Day Festival in that city.
Fifty universities and colleges will
send over 500 athletes to the valley
carnival, and the Cards stand out as
the most powerful aggregation en
tered. U.S.C., California, the Olympic
Club, and the Los Angeles Athletic
Club are expected to offer the strong
est competition to the Stanford
squad.
The Trojans, in particular, will bo
powerful tomorrow. Cromwell is jour
neying north with Captain Lee
Barnes, Charley Borah, Warren Wood
ruff, Ed Gloege, Jack Williams, Wel
don Draper, Jim Steward, and Richard
Wehner, fleet freshman sprinter.
Dink Templeton's Cardinals need
lose little sleep, however, as the al
ready strong Stanford squad seems
to become more dangerous with each
practice. Eric Krenz caused a furor
yesterday when he went on a platter
tossing spree and heaved the discus
all over the oval, sending world
marks by the boards. Unluckily the
distances made by the husky weight
man can't be called official, but they
are quite sufficient to give the other
Fresno entries something to think
about, not to mention certain Eastern
gentlemen who will be at the 1.C.-4A.
Krenz's work is the most outstand
ing just at present, but judging from
the Cards' performances this season
it seems quite likely that other young
men may rise to fame tomorrow. Cer
tainly good things may be expected
from men like Ward Edmonds and
Captain-Elect Ross Nichols, not to
mention the long-legged Captain Bud
Spencer.
Whatever the outcome of the
Fresno Relays, the Stanford squad
will gain a little more valuable ex
perience which will do no harm in
preparation for the impending East
ern invasion.
