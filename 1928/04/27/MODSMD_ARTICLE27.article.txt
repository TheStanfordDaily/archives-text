For years Oliver Wendell Holmes has been considered one of the most
learned judges on the Supreme Court, yet time and again, in decisions of
the court, we find "Justice Holmes dissenting," or read a dissenting opinion
written by him. And oftentimes those opinions take a hearty thrust at
the traditions and precedents that seem to hind a large majority of legal
experts.
In an article in his column in The Nation, Heywood Broun cites the
above facts, which are already quite well known, and goes on to say that
there should I>e some way to make the Supreme Court "responsive and
responsible to popular will." He feels that the court is so bound by the
past that real justice is not forthcoming from the nation's highest tribunal.
Perhaps Broun is right. Perhaps the Court is overburdened with age
old precedents from which it dares not, or cares not, to deviate. Does it
follow then that they must be made responsive to popular will ? From
what one can gather, modern political theorists think that this is the last
thing that should be done. One of the greatest evils of many of the state
judicial systems is the very fact that they are subject to the caprices of
popular will, which, after all, merely means the caprices of politicians.
Broun asks the old chicken-and-egg question: "Does the Constitution
make the court or the court the Constitution?" He says the court is a
"body which has come into being with the gradual accumulation of powers
never granted but all usurped." The answer to his question is quite
simple. Certainly there was 110 court before the Constitution was drawn
up. After it was drawn up, there was, and is, a court, and this because one
was provided for in that document.
Because they have usurped powers never granted (Broun leaves his j
readers to determine what those powers are) may mean that the court
is a corrupt group of busybodies, or it may mean the justices have found
it necessary to do some things not mentioned in the Constitution, things j
the makers thereof did not foresee. "Well," Broun would say, "then the
popular will should determine." He is wrong. Matters judicial cannot be 1
handled by any such ephemeral agency.
True, the Supreme Court makes mistakes. It is composed of human
beings. But in everything there must be some centralized point of last
resort, and that point can't be fluctuating with every change of the
weather, or the prohibition question.

past that real justice is not forthcoming from the nation's highest tribunal.
Perhaps Broun is right. Perhaps the Court is overburdened with age
old precedents from which it dares not, or cares not, to deviate. Does it
follow then that they must be made responsive to popular will ? From
what one can gather, modern political theorists think that this is the last
thing that should be done. One of the greatest evils of many of the state
judicial systems is the very fact that they are subject to the caprices of
popular will, which, after all, merely means the caprices of politicians.
Broun asks the old chicken-and-egg question: "Does the Constitution
make the court or the court the Constitution?" He says the court is a
"body which has come into being with the gradual accumulation of powers
never granted but all usurped." The answer to his question is quite
simple. Certainly there was 110 court before the Constitution was drawn
up. After it was drawn up, there was, and is, a court, and this because one
was provided for in that document.
Because they have usurped powers never granted (Broun leaves his j
readers to determine what those powers are) may mean that the court
is a corrupt group of busybodies, or it may mean the justices have found
it necessary to do some things not mentioned in the Constitution, things j
the makers thereof did not foresee. "Well," Broun would say, "then the
popular will should determine." He is wrong. Matters judicial cannot be 1
handled by any such ephemeral agency.
True, the Supreme Court makes mistakes. It is composed of human
beings. But in everything there must be some centralized point of last
resort, and that point can't be fluctuating with every change of the
weather, or the prohibition question.
For years Oliver Wendell Holmes has been considered one of the most
learned judges on the Supreme Court, yet time and again, in decisions of
the court, we find "Justice Holmes dissenting," or read a dissenting opinion
written by him. And oftentimes those opinions take a hearty thrust at
the traditions and precedents that seem to hind a large majority of legal
experts.
In an article in his column in The Nation, Heywood Broun cites the
above facts, which are already quite well known, and goes on to say that
there should I>e some way to make the Supreme Court "responsive and
responsible to popular will." He feels that the court is so bound by the
past that real justice is not forthcoming from the nation's highest tribunal.
