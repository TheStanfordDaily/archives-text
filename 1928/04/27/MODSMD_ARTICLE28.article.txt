# Space Needed

With the proposed introduction at Stanford of a teaching major and
minor for women in Physical Education, the need for a new gymnasium
becomes more acute. The buildings and equipment are entirely inadequate
to meet present demands, and w.ith the addition of a new department the
situation would I>ecome further aggravated.
Most of the Physical Education classes are now conducted out of doors ;
but when the "weather prevents them from holding regular practice, there
are no classrooms available. The old gymnasium, intended as temporary
quarters only, has now been in use for thirty years. The other building,
erected ten years ago, was only put up to fill an emergency need, and was
never meant for permanent occupancy. In neither of these is there any
classroom space. Dr. Mosher's office, recently fitted up, has one adjoining
classroom and that is needed for her own courses.
Sports classes are in urgent need of lecture rooms right now. The
addition of a teacher's course in Physical Education would make them
absolutely imperative.
