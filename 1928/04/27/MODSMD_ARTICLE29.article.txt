Organized for the first time this year as a self-supporting student ac
tivity, the Stanford Glee Club has attained a position in the foremost ranks
of college musical societies. This year the annual spring tour of the club
met with notable success. The name and spirit of Stanford were brought
before the people of central and southern California through the medium
of music. A medley of Stanford songs was recorded on Victor records
by the Glee Club. The enviable season of the club will be brought to a close
at the Home Concert which will be given in the Assembly Hall tonight.
Music sung by the club is of real merit and not merely the rah-rah
songs of bygone college glees. The Stanford Glee Club was among the
first to adopt the standard of semi-classical music for their programs and
has made a success of it.
