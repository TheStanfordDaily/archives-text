Andre Maurois, a French writer, in pointing his contention that Dart
month shows the typical American spirit, the pioneer spirit, says: .. at
Dartmouth College, the rallying cry is an Indian cry: 'Qua, oua!' Dart
month is at the of a forest. In the evening the students carry their
dinner and their hooks into the depths of the woods. During fine weather
they pass the night there and the farther away the better for them."
That's what HE thinks!

There is a project under way by which Cornell University may join
with the University of Porto Rico in establishing a graduate school for
tropical agriculture.
