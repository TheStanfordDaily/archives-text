While We Are Debunking History . . .
The press, the movies, the maga
zines, and fiction have woefully and
wilfully failed to interpret college
life to the public, with the result that
what college really is and what Live
non-collegiate world thinks it is have
become two separate and somewhat
different things.
What is needed, in the higher inter
ests of a little truth and accuracy, is
something new and honest in middle
men.
Voices of Protest
From scattered quarters conic pro
tests against the rot that is handed
out as representative of collegiate
activities. In the East, Cornell and
Princeton have been moved to wrath
by the distortions of the movies,
while in the West, college comic
papers, led by the Stanford Chapar
ral, are breaking away from the gin,
petlirg, and rah-rah interpretation of
college life, upon which limited hori
zon the sun of the national college
tomic magazines rises and sets.
Ideas Slew to Take
Instead of being radical and ultra
modern, college students are com
fjervatice almost lo the extreme. Wit
ness the opposition to change and the
loyalty which outworn traditions can

| muster in a college. New ideas in
thinking tend to take slowly with
j collegians or not at all.
Some sixty men and women at
Drake University were interviewed
recently on the subject of compani >n
j ate marriage. Only two or three ad
mitted that they would even consider
I sued a relationship. The results of the
i Doily questionnaire, printed last Mon
! day, reveal a similar conservative
point of view. Yet, when the resultr,
; of this questionnaire appeared in the
j city papers the next morning the
same figures having been properly
sensationalized, looked quite different.

However badly the college bubble
needs to be punctured, the prospects,
we suspect, are not particularly
bright for an era of truth and ac-1
curacy. The exploits of college boys j
