"The International," John Howard
Lawson, Macaulay Co.
This play is about as harmless and
innocuous to have around as a keg
of dynamite, or a dam built on shale.
It is so revolutionary in form as well
as subject matter —and chaotic —that j
the average reader will simply slough
it from his mind when he has finished J
it. Serious consideration of it brings
nightmares.
Mr. Lawson's play is laid in the 1
future, when conditions in interna- j
tional commerce precipitate the great
est war of all times. Perhaps this is
some fifty years from now, perhaps a
hundred. Conflict between capitalistic
interests for a piece of land in
Thibet, containing oil, sets the world
afire, but there is a revolution in each
and every country to add to the strife, j
We are not sure just who is going l
to inherit the kingdom of the earth
according to this conception—surely
not the meek. It seems more likely
that all these human parasites on the
earth will be consumed in the strug-

I gle. Family against family, brothers
against brothers, nation against na
tion, employee against employer — i
everyone.
Tliis dismal Utopia is prophesied in
a most interesting form. The entire !
play is planned to a symphonic-like
| arrangement of music, along "modern
istic lines with special emphasis on
broken rhythms, machine noises, and
| chanting blues." Two choruses of
women are used with "a combination
of jazz treatment and the dignified
I strophe and antistrophe of Greek
drama." In the battle-scenes, the ma
chine guns are done in foxtrot time.
A futuristic scenic scheme is also
planned, upon a permanent structure
that varies with the lighting from
being a futurist city, a mountain pile,
or a rough relief map.
Lawson has combined some of the
best qualities of O'Neill and of Wytter
Bynner in "The International," with
a great deal of his own added for good
measure. It is surely the newest of
■ the new Art, and worth considera
' tion. —Hallie Keating.
