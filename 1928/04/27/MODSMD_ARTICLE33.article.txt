Now that another national cham
pionship on the cinder path seems
likely for Coach Dink Templeton's
pupils, Sons of the Stanford Red are
! wearing, complacent grins. And well
1 they may, for another Cardinal clean
! up at the 1.C.4-A. would do great
j things for the boys from the Farm.
But the individual glory gained
from such a feat isn't all. Win
ning football teams have spread
the name Stanford from one coast
to the other, and victorious track
outfits will do the same.
Scholars will shake their heads
sadly at such a declaration. It is a
paradox that an institution of learn
ing must depend on brute strength
for such a large portion of its fame.
But such is human nature.
Add the name of some great
authority in science or literature
to the faculty role, and hardly a
stir will result, to speak compara
tively. But discover a great half
miler or an Ail-American quarter
back, and all the high school kids
in the country will prick up their
ears.
It isn't natural for youth to thrill at
(lie news of a scholarly triumph, and
for that matter it doesn't seem to
thrill much of the world at large. But
i a football team or a great coach will
cause them to thirst for knowledge
to an amazing degree.
Look at Centre College. Until a
few years back no one outside of
Kentucky had ever heard of that
little institution, in spite of its
high ideals and sterling scholar
ship.
Then came "Bo" McMillan and
those gallant Praying Colonels. Har
vard fell, and so did Penn.—two Go
liaths before an unknown David.
There was romance in the tale of
that unknown, poorly equipped
] eleven, and in how it humbled the
i pride of the East. When "Bo" and his
teammates came homo the townspeo
ple got out the band and the fire

, truck and made merry. Next year
Centre College turned away aspiring
' scholars by the dozen —an unprece- i
| dented event in the annals of that 1
! institution.
It isn't particularly appropriate to j
J draw a parallel between Centre and
i Stanford, to be sure. Stanford, great
j in itself, need not stoop to commer
j cializing athletic excellence, it may
i he argued. ,
But in spite of all that, Stan
ford's great teams are doing
something for their alma mater
greater than bringing home sil
ver-plated cups and humbling the
Golden Bear. And it's the wise
scholar who sees these truths,
and shows tolerance.
