# Tolman Predicts Abandonment of Hollywood Dam
## Fact That Mulholland Was Builder Causes People To Fear Break 
### Hubert Gagos 
"Despite the fact that there is no
imminent danger of another dam dis
aster, the Hollywood Dam will prob
ably be abandoned as soon as new ar
rangements can be made for the
storage of water." That was the state
ment made to the Daily yesterday by
Cyrus F. Tolman, professor of econo
mic geology and chairman of the first
committee to investigate the failure
of the St. Francis dam.
"The fact that the dam was built
by City Engineer Mulholland, who
supervised the construction of the St.
Francis dam, and that it is closely
modeled on the one that was de
stroyed, has caused uneasiness in
Hollywood. A possible break would
wipe out the center of the Hollywood
business district."
Professor Tolman explained that
the geological formation at the base
of the Hollywood dam is quite dif
ferent from the conglomerate rock
and clay at the base of the St. Fran
cis dam.
"There was no structural weakness
in the dam itself, it was weakness at
the base that caused the collapse,"
Professor Tolman explained.
Mulholland was described by Pro
fessor Tolman as an experienced
structural engineer whose work in
civic engineering has been admirable.
He was not, however, an experienced
dam builder. Mulliolland's outstanding
feat was the construction of the Los
Angeles aqueduct.
"A business depression in Holly
wood has followed the collapse of the
St. Francis, dam," Professor Tolman
remarked. "I do not believe that a
dam, no matter how secure, should be
placed in a position that would jeop
ardize a city," he concluded.
