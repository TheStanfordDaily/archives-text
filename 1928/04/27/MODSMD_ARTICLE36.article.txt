# SPORTS OF 1928
## The
						Thinker 
### BY "FEG MURRAY. '16 
Never known as a "master mind,"
nevertheless Miller Huggins, mite of
New York Yankees, has won one
more pennant in the last seven years
than his rival New York pilot, John
McGraw, who is noted for his heavy
thinking ability. Here is a picture
of the Miller in a thinking pose, (no,
little boy, he is not whistling through
his fingers,) cogitating, nay, even ru
minating on what the present or cur
rent season holds in store for his
beloved Yankees.
True, in the training season the
proud champions of the world didn't
look too good. They gave the im
pression of a team that thought all
that was necessary in order to win a
game from Aslieville or Nashville, or
even Brooklyn, wasto go out on the
field and cause people to say, "Ah, the
New York Yankees! Wonderful!
Great! Stupendous!" But Miller didn't
worry, at least not much, and when
the season got under way, and his
club won the first three games and the
Yanks, took their standings, every
body felt better.
The Yanks are very lucky in hav

ing the double attraction of Ruth and
Gehrig, who travel around helping to
win games and bring in gate receipts
Iby their home run act. Babe let
j Lou get the jump on him in 1928, but
I they pay off on what's done in 154
games. The fact that Gehrig, in his
third season as a regular, was able
to hit five more home runs than
Hornsby's National League record,
and as many or more than Ruth hit
in 1919, 1923, 1924, 1925, or 192G, was
somewhat overlooked in the excite
ment of Ruth's final record-breaking
| 60.
It seems that with a team of such
j super batting skill, and with pitchers
J like Hoyt, Pennock, and Moore, Mil
! ler Huggins' thoughts must all be op
| timistic.
