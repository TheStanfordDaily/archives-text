# Convalescent Home To Commence Drive Soon

### Sylva Weaver 
The Stanford Convalescent Home
stands today as a symbol of the char
ity of the founders of the University.
For eight years it has been of benefit
to the sick and crippled children of
San Francisco. It is a charity organi
zation to which the students of the
school contribute a good part of the
running expenses. The drive for funds
starts next week, and will continue
until May 16, Labor Day.
The Convalescent Home recalls
memories in the minds of the early
students here. Leland Stanford, Jr.,
lived there, and when he died, the
home seemed strangely silent. It was
in this home that the founder of the
LTniversity awoke one night to say
"the children of California shall be
my children," and the foundation of
this institution was made.
Stanford Home Used
Here the Senator died, and Mrs.
Stanford was left to face her great
responsibilities alone. In the earth
quake the house fell, and it seemed
for a time that the glory of the home
had disappeared. However, it was not
possible that the Stanford home
should be forgotten. A use worthy of
the two founders was discovered in
the work done for the convalescent
children of San Francisco.
For two summers the home and its
surroundings were turned into a sum
mer camp. This led to a request from
the Stanfoi'd Hospital in the city that
a home be established for the all
year-round care of sick children. The
Stanford Home for Children was es
tablished in the old Stanford resi
dence in 1920.
Has Large Endowment
While the Home was established
primarily to care for the needy chil
dren of the Stanford clinics in San
Francisco, it has broadened into an
institution that receives convalescent
children from any clinical hospital or
accredited charity. It is entirely non
sectarian, and is open all the year
round. The endowment of the Home
has now reached the sum of

$101,027.72.
One day each year students of the
University clean up the grounds, and
many men and women give of their
time doing odd tasks and caring for
the children at the Home.
