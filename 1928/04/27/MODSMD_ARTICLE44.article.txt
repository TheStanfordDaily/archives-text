"Esperanto" will be the subject of |
a talk by E. A. Rogers, president of
Montezuma School for Boys, in the
Women's Clubhouse Monday night at
7:30 o'clock. Rogers is an interna
tionally known Esperantist. Martin
H. Pihl, of the same school, will ren
der some vocal solos, the Boys'
Quartette will sing, and a play will
be performed by a cast of Montezuma
boys.
Esperanto, an international lan
guage invented by Dr. Ludovic Zame
nof of Poland and first published in
1887, is the most accurate language
there is, according to students in the
class held at Stanford under the di- j
rection of E. B. Myers of Redwood I
City High School. It has three tenses,
past, present, and future, no reflex
ives, no declensions, and only one
gender. Each letter has one sound,
and words are pronounced exactly as
spelled. Ambiguity of meaning in sen
tences is impossible.
"To establish a neutral foundation
on which the various races of man
kind may hold peaceful, brotherly in
tercourse without intruding on each
other and without racial differences," ,
is the ideal aim of Esperanto, which
means "one who hopes."
When a person acquires the ability
ot carrying on a conversation in Es
peranto, he is given a pin, a green
star, which he may wear when trav- j
eling. Paul Wildhoefer of Hungary
recently came all the way to the
Montezuma School without using any
other language than Esperanto, which !
all hotels in Europe employ as one of
their languages.
The British Esperanto Association
of London is the center of the Es- j
peranto organization. According to '
the April issue of the Modern Lan-'
guage Journal this international lan- j
guage is spreading rapidly especially
in Europe. i
