## Alpha Delt, S.A.E., Encina 2E Nines Beat K.A., Chi Psi, Sigma Nu Outfits 
### 
A phenomenal number of strikeouts
featured yesterday's intramural base
ball play, in which Encina 2E, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, and Alpha Delta Phi
triumphed over the teams of Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Nu, and Chi Psi, re
spectively. Seventy strikeouts were
issued during the 20 innings.
The closest and best-played game
of the day was that between Alpha
Delta Phi and Chi Psi, in which the
former won 3 to 2. Good pitching on
both sides held the batters down to
a small number of hits, four hits be
ing allowed by each liurler. Fifteen
men were struck out by Ditzler of
Chi Psi and seven by Thompson of
Alpha Delta Phi. Only three errors
were made during the entire game.
Following is the summary of the
game: R H E
Alpha Delta Phi 3 4 1
Chi Psi 2 4 2
A last-inning rally, which ended
only when Gatzert, freshman left
fielder, made a difficult, one-handed

catch of a long fly, threatened to de
prive the Encina 2E team of a vic
tory over the Kappa Alpha aggrega
tion. The Hall men led 8 to 3 up to
the last period, but the combination
of errors on the part of their oppon
ents and accurate hitting allowed the
fraternity players to score two more
tallies, and to place one man on base
before the end of the inning.
Following is the summary of the
game: R H E
Encina 2E 8 8 5
Kappa Alpha 5 5 1
Scoring ten runs in the last Inning,
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon liorsehide
chasers had an easy time defeating
the Sigma Nu nine, the final score
being 20 to 7. The feature of this
same was the large number of strike
outs, Leverenz of the winners fanning
fifteen and Dyer of Sigma Nu twelve.
During the first five innings the
teams seemed pretty evenly matched,
with the Sigma Alpha Epsilons lead
ing by two runs. In the last period,
however, the Sigma Nu team let down,
four men reaching first on errors and
six on hits. A three-base hit by
Palmer scored two runs.

Scoring ten runs in the last Inning,
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon liorsehide
chasers had an easy time defeating
the Sigma Nu nine, the final score
being 20 to 7. The feature of this
same was the large number of strike
outs, Leverenz of the winners fanning
fifteen and Dyer of Sigma Nu twelve.
During the first five innings the
teams seemed pretty evenly matched,
with the Sigma Alpha Epsilons lead
ing by two runs. In the last period,
however, the Sigma Nu team let down,
four men reaching first on errors and
six on hits. A three-base hit by
Palmer scored two runs.

A phenomenal number of strikeouts
featured yesterday's intramural base
ball play, in which Encina 2E, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, and Alpha Delta Phi
triumphed over the teams of Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Nu, and Chi Psi, re
spectively. Seventy strikeouts were
issued during the 20 innings.
The closest and best-played game
of the day was that between Alpha
Delta Phi and Chi Psi, in which the
former won 3 to 2. Good pitching on
both sides held the batters down to
a small number of hits, four hits be
ing allowed by each liurler. Fifteen
men were struck out by Ditzler of
Chi Psi and seven by Thompson of
Alpha Delta Phi. Only three errors
were made during the entire game.
Following is the summary of the
game: R H E
Alpha Delta Phi 3 4 1
Chi Psi 2 4 2
A last-inning rally, which ended
only when Gatzert, freshman left
fielder, made a difficult, one-handed

catch of a long fly, threatened to de
prive the Encina 2E team of a vic
tory over the Kappa Alpha aggrega
tion. The Hall men led 8 to 3 up to
the last period, but the combination
of errors on the part of their oppon
ents and accurate hitting allowed the
fraternity players to score two more
tallies, and to place one man on base
before the end of the inning.
