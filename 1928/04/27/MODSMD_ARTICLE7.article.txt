### 
MURRAY BAY, Quebec, April 26.—
(U.P.) —Casting aside all other con
siderations, including the elaborate
welcome which New York City had
planned for them, the crew of the
i transatlantic airplane Bremen will fly
to Washington Friday to attend the
burial of Floyd Bennett. Bennett gave
his life in an effort to carry relief to
them while they were on Greenly
Island.
Immediately after reaching Murray
Bay this afternoon on the relief plane
which brought them out from ice
locked Greenly Island, the German-
Irish crew of the Bremen held a con
ference with Fraulein Ilerta Junkers.
Then they announced they would take
off at dawn for Washington.
The elaborate and expensive wel
come which had been planned for
them in New York can wait, they de
cided, until they have paid their re
spects to Bennett, who arose from a
sick-bed to fly a relief plane as far
as Murray Bay to rescue them.
QUEBEC, April 26. — (U.P.)—This
ancient city, to which has come of
late the excitement of a modern con
quest of the air, sent Floyd Bennett
home to his country this afternoon
with reverence, honor, and military
ceremony.
After brief ceremonies in the little
funeral chapel of Jeffrey Hale hos
pital, a solemn cortege such as the
sorrowing Quebec populace never had
looked upon before wound through
two miles of the old city's picturesque
streets to the railroad station. There,
the flag-draped casket was placed
aboard a train for Montreal, accom
panied only by Mrs. Bennett and
Commander Richard E. Byrd, the
dead airman's beloved chief.
Full military honors were accorded
the man who had given his life on a
mission to aid his comrades in aerial
conquest, while the cortege was es
corting the casket to the station. The
brief, touching services were recited
by Archbishop Scott.
