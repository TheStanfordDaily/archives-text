# REINALD WERRENRATH POPULAR IN RECITAL AT ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### 
Reinald Werrenrath last night jus
tified his claim to a popular favor
shared only by John McCormack in
a recital given in the Assembly Hall.
The rather light program still allowed
the baritone opportunity to display
the rich tone, power and ease of de
livery, and dramatic feeling which
marks his singing.
"Credo" from "Otello" was particu
larly well received, and Werrenrath
put into it all the sinister, mocking
character of Shakespeare's villain. A
later group, which Werrenrath has
made famous, was "Songs of the
Sea."
"The Road To Mandalay," a con
cluding encore, was given an enthusi
astic ovation. "Roots," another Kip
ling poem, was also sung with spirit
and artistry.
Mr. Garrick, who accompanied
Werrenrath with skill, played three
solos which were vory favorably re
ceived.
