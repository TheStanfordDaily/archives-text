Make Reading a Delight
Many of our cients tell us that while
they enjoy reading they can do only
a small amount of it when their eyes ,
give out and they must stop to rest
them. After we fit them out with
glasses to correct vision defects they
can read all night long with the!
greatest comfort. Do not suffer from
eye strain. Come to us for properly
fitted glasses.
