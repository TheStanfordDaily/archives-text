# KEIO BASEBALL TEAM DEFEATS CARDINALS 5-2
## Stanford Nine Elects Frank Wilton Varsity Captain For 1929 Season Three Regular Cards Out of Lineup; Reise, Harder, Berg Substitutes 
### Frank Whiteley 
Frank Wilton, center fielder
during the past two years, was
elected captain of the Stanford
varsity baseball team for the
1929 season following the game
with Keio University Saturday

nese men are real ballplayers and
gave a good exhibition of the way

There were several gaps in the

won his block "S" in past years as a
pitcher, did creditably at shortstop in
place of Busch, while Spud Harder
did the ball-chasing in center field

Berg did the receiving in place of
Captain Cook Sypher.

and further aided his teammates by

at bat. Count Sobieski did the chuck

form, allowing the heavy-hitting
Keioans but eight bingles.
Keio's big inning was the second
