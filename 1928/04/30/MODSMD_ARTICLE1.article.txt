# KEIO BASEBALL TEAM DEFEATS CARDINALS 5-2
## Stanford Nine Elects Frank Wilton Varsity Captain For 1929 Season Three Regular Cards Out of Lineup; Reise, Harder, Berg Substitutes 
### Frank Whiteley 
Frank Wilton, center fielder
during the past two years, was
elected captain of the Stanford
varsity baseball team for the
1929 season following the game
with Keio University Saturday
afternoon. Wilton, who has won
fame on the gridiron as a speedy
and shifty open-field runner, is a
classy outfielder with sure judg
ment of flies and a good arm, and
as lead-off man, a dependable hit
ter.

Playing baseball as it should be
played, the championship Keio Uni
versity nine of Japan defeated the
Stanford varsity 5-2 in a slow game
here Saturday afternoon. The Japa
nese men are real ballplayers and
gave a good exhibition of the way
America's national game is played in
the Orient, and did it all too effec
tively for the satisfaction of the
Cards. The visitors bunched their
hits and made the most of all oppor
tunities to score.
There were several gaps in the
Stanford lineup, due to the inability
of three regulars to play, but these
holes were fairly well filled by sec
ond-string men. Rudy Riese, who has
won his block "S" in past years as a
pitcher, did creditably at shortstop in
place of Busch, while Spud Harder
did the ball-chasing in center field
usually done by Frank Wilton. Harry
Berg did the receiving in place of
Captain Cook Sypher.
Keio Pitcher Strong
Miyatake, said to be Japan's best
college pitcher, turned in nine neat
innings on the mound for the visitors,
and further aided his teammates by
driving out two singles in four times
at bat. Count Sobieski did the chuck
ing for the Cards and was in good
form, allowing the heavy-hitting
Keioans but eight bingles.
Keio's big inning was the second
when three hits and a walk resulted
in three tallies. Miyatake singled;
Machida walked; and the two of
them came home on Okada's double
down the third-base line. Okada then
scored on Kongo's single to right field.
In the fourth Fukushima reached first
on a fielder's choice play, stole sec
ond, and went home on a passed ball
to score another run. Yamashita
made the fifth score in the eighth
inning when he singled, stole second,
advanced to third on Machida's single,
and reached home on an error by
Harder.
Laird Knocks Homer
Two bases on balls, an infield hit,
and a sacrifice fly in the fifth ac
counted for Stanford's first run. Laird
lifted a long one over the left field
fence in the sixth to score the other.
Besides this homer Laird knocked out
two singles to take the honors as the
slugger of the day with three hits in
four trips to the plate.

Frank Wilton, center fielder
during the past two years, was
elected captain of the Stanford
varsity baseball team for the
1929 season following the game
with Keio University Saturday
afternoon. Wilton, who has won
fame on the gridiron as a speedy
and shifty open-field runner, is a
classy outfielder with sure judg
ment of flies and a good arm, and
as lead-off man, a dependable hit
ter.

Playing baseball as it should be
played, the championship Keio Uni
versity nine of Japan defeated the
Stanford varsity 5-2 in a slow game
here Saturday afternoon. The Japa
nese men are real ballplayers and
gave a good exhibition of the way
America's national game is played in
the Orient, and did it all too effec
tively for the satisfaction of the
Cards. The visitors bunched their
hits and made the most of all oppor
tunities to score.
There were several gaps in the
Stanford lineup, due to the inability
of three regulars to play, but these
holes were fairly well filled by sec
ond-string men. Rudy Riese, who has
won his block "S" in past years as a
pitcher, did creditably at shortstop in
place of Busch, while Spud Harder
did the ball-chasing in center field
usually done by Frank Wilton. Harry
Berg did the receiving in place of
Captain Cook Sypher.
Keio Pitcher Strong
Miyatake, said to be Japan's best
college pitcher, turned in nine neat
innings on the mound for the visitors,
and further aided his teammates by
driving out two singles in four times
at bat. Count Sobieski did the chuck
ing for the Cards and was in good
form, allowing the heavy-hitting
Keioans but eight bingles.
Keio's big inning was the second
when three hits and a walk resulted
in three tallies. Miyatake singled;
Machida walked; and the two of
them came home on Okada's double
down the third-base line. Okada then
scored on Kongo's single to right field.
In the fourth Fukushima reached first
on a fielder's choice play, stole sec
ond, and went home on a passed ball
to score another run. Yamashita
made the fifth score in the eighth
inning when he singled, stole second,
advanced to third on Machida's single,
and reached home on an error by
Harder.
Laird Knocks Homer
Two bases on balls, an infield hit,
and a sacrifice fly in the fifth ac
counted for Stanford's first run. Laird
lifted a long one over the left field
fence in the sixth to score the other.
Besides this homer Laird knocked out
two singles to take the honors as the
slugger of the day with three hits in
four trips to the plate.

of three regulars to play, but these
holes were fairly well filled by sec
ond-string men. Rudy Riese, who has
won his block "S" in past years as a
pitcher, did creditably at shortstop in
place of Busch, while Spud Harder
did the ball-chasing in center field
usually done by Frank Wilton. Harry
Berg did the receiving in place of
Captain Cook Sypher.
Keio Pitcher Strong
Miyatake, said to be Japan's best
college pitcher, turned in nine neat
innings on the mound for the visitors,
and further aided his teammates by
driving out two singles in four times
at bat. Count Sobieski did the chuck
ing for the Cards and was in good
form, allowing the heavy-hitting
Keioans but eight bingles.
Keio's big inning was the second
when three hits and a walk resulted
in three tallies. Miyatake singled;
Machida walked; and the two of
them came home on Okada's double
down the third-base line. Okada then
scored on Kongo's single to right field.
In the fourth Fukushima reached first
on a fielder's choice play, stole sec
ond, and went home on a passed ball
to score another run. Yamashita
made the fifth score in the eighth
inning when he singled, stole second,
advanced to third on Machida's single,
and reached home on an error by
Harder.
Laird Knocks Homer
Two bases on balls, an infield hit,
and a sacrifice fly in the fifth ac
counted for Stanford's first run. Laird
lifted a long one over the left field
fence in the sixth to score the other.
Besides this homer Laird knocked out
two singles to take the honors as the
slugger of the day with three hits in
four trips to the plate.

Frank Wilton, center fielder
during the past two years, was
elected captain of the Stanford
varsity baseball team for the
1929 season following the game
with Keio University Saturday
afternoon. Wilton, who has won
fame on the gridiron as a speedy
and shifty open-field runner, is a
classy outfielder with sure judg
ment of flies and a good arm, and
as lead-off man, a dependable hit
ter.

Playing baseball as it should be
played, the championship Keio Uni
versity nine of Japan defeated the
Stanford varsity 5-2 in a slow game
here Saturday afternoon. The Japa
nese men are real ballplayers and
gave a good exhibition of the way
America's national game is played in
the Orient, and did it all too effec
tively for the satisfaction of the
Cards. The visitors bunched their
hits and made the most of all oppor
tunities to score.
There were several gaps in the
Stanford lineup, due to the inability
of three regulars to play, but these
holes were fairly well filled by sec
