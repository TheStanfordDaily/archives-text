# SAN MATEO SYMPHONY SERIES OFFERS RATES TO SUMMER STUDENTS
## Distinguished Men Obtained To Conduct Concerts At Hillsborough 
### 
Special rates for the Sunday after
noon symphony concerts in the
Woodland Theatre at Hillsborough
this summer will again be available
for Stanford students and faculty.
There has always been a close bond
between the San Mateo Philharmonic
Society, which sponsors these con
certs, and the members of the Stan
ford summer quarter, and this year
the dates of the eight concerts have
been placed once more so that all fall
within the limits of the summer ses
sion.
To Have Tickets Here
Director Sellards of the summer
quarter will have the special series
tickets for the series available for
Stanford people, and special taxi rates
will be arranged for those who do not
have their own automobiles.
In addition to Ossip Gabrilowitsch,
who has conducted some of the con
certs in previous summers, the Phil
harmonic Society has for this summer
engaged two other distinguished con
ductors, both of whom will make their
Pacific Coast debut here. Albert
Coates has been guest conductor for
several concerts in New York every
season since 1920, but has never been
West before. His career has been
largely centered in the great opera
houses of Europe.
Molinari Secured
Bernardino Molinari, conductor of
the Orchestra of the Augusteum in
Rome, was first heard in this country
last January. He has returned to his
own orchestra to finish the season
and will qome to California from
there to conduct the first concerts of
the series at Hillsborough.
