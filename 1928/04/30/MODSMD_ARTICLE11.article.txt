### 
The Anti-Aircraft division, Battery
A of the sixty-third Coast Artillery
from Fort Scott, now encamped on
University grounds south of the sta
dium, will begin practice tonight in
locating and illuminating planes fly
ing under cover of darkness.
According to Lieutenant L. E. Shaw,
the division now has nine Cadillac
searchlights of one million candle
power each. The beam from one of
these lights is strong enough to per
mit the reading of a newspaper at a
point thirty-five miles distant from
the searchlight. Only four of the nine
lights will be used in the battery's
maneuvers at present.
