# WASHINGTON FACES SERIOUS DANGER OF FLOOD IN POTOMAC
## U.S. Weather Bureau Issues Flood Warnings; Twenty Foot Rise in River 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 29.— (U.P.) —
For the first time in ten years, the
National Capital faces the possibility
of a flood as swollen streams of near
by states pour their muddy waters
into the Potomac river.
Unusually heavy rains, snows and
storms in Maryland and Virginia have
added to the usual spring freshets
which the river must carry from in
land to the sea.
Flood warnings have been issued by
the United States Weather Bureau and
river men are keeping a watchful eye
on gauges as the water rises slowly
toward the danger mark.
At Great Falls, nine miles above
Washington, the river was reported
more than twenty feet above its nor
mal level and rising at the rate of
about six inches an hour.
