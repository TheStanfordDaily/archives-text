# LAGUNITA FAREWELL RESULTS IN SPEEDY DEPARTURE OF HERO
## 
### 
A tender farewell on the shores
of Lake Lagunita, wherein the
hero and his misleading lady
educate a thrilled lloble audi
ence; an ochre roadster speed
ing down Palm Drive in a mad
dash for the S.P. local; an early,
full-dress, breakfast tour of the
campusâ€”
Connect them as you will, and
glimmerings may come of the
plot of Stanford Studio's "Fast
Male." With , only one photogra
pher and eight directors in full
possesion of the complete sce
nario, secrecy may yet be main
tained until the end of the quar
ter, when the mammoth produc
tion will be released.
