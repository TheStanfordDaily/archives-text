# SCHOLARSHIP FIGURES SHOW IMPROVEMENT OVER 1926-27 GRADES
## 
### 
Comparative figures released by the
Scholarship Committee show a small-j
er number of disqualifications for low
grades during the first two quarters
of the current school year than for
the corresponding two quarters of last
year.
At the end of the autumn quarter of
192G-27, 84 students were disqualified
for low grades. The autumn quarter
of the year 1927-28 shows 67 flunks,
a reduction of 17. Winter quarter fig
ures for 1926-27 show failures to the
number of 51, while the correspond
ing quarter in 1927-28 resulted in 47
failures, a reduction of 4.
Last year's spring quarter figures
show a very large number of failures,
81. This number, which is usually
much smaller, is ascribed to the
change in scholarship rules which
went into effect during that quarter. [
Prior to that time, a student was al
lowed to go on probation for three
successive quarters before disqualifi
cation. Under the present rules, dis
qualification takes place if the stu
dent does not maintain a C average
after being on probation.
