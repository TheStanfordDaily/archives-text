morning are the most interesting bit
of educational work the Church has j
clone this year," said Dr. Gardner yes
terday after the celebration of the
Mass, according to the rite of the
Russian Church in the Chapel was
over.
"We hear a good deal of talk about
international-mindedness, but we can
never really hope to understand a
country unless we know its cultural
background, and especially its reli
gion."
The music of the Mass was sung by
the choir of the Holy Trinity Cathe
dral of San Francisco. Archbishop
Alexy of the Greek Orthodox Church
conducted the services in the Holy !
Liturgy of St. John Crysotum, a saint j

the Reverend Father Sakovitch and
Professor Henry Lanz..
