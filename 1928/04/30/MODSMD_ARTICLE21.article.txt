Esperanto is being taught at Stan
ford in an extra-curricular class,
which meets on Tuesday evenings,
conducted by E. B. Myers of the Red
wood City High School.
Dr. Ludovic Zamenof, who lived in
a Polish town peopled by Poles, Rus-1
sians, Germans, and Jews, each race
speaking its own language and hating j
each other, conceived the idea that if
they spoke one language they could
understand each other better, and
race hatred would disappear.
Realizing that one race would not
give up its language for that of an
other, he invented Esperanto, which ;
means "one who hopes," and first pub
lished it in a book titled "An Inter
national Language by Dr. Esperanto."
He constructed his language so that
it would be the most accurate pos-!
sible, and yet extremely simple.
