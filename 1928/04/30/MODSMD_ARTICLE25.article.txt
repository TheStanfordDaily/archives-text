# WILSON DEALT HAND OF THIRTEEN SPADES
## 
### 
4- <§>
"Lucky at cards, unlucky in love" —
so reads the old proverb. If there is
any truth in this time-honored maxim,
Harold Wilson is destined to be eter
nally unsuccessful in affairs of heart;
he was dealt a perfect hand of thir
teen spades in a bridge game at the
Phi Delta Theta house yesterday.
Albert Purkiss was the dealer. May
nor Shove and Bud Hawkins complet
ed the foursome.
