# The 						Women's Turn
## 
### 
Additional funds arc needed for the men's gymnasium and athletic
equipment. Admitted, but the women need new building and equipment
too. While the men have been receiving large sums—inadequate, perhaps,
hut nevertheless large —the women have received almost nothing since
the newer of their two gymnasium buildings was put up as a temporary
measure ten years ago. The women feel that the men are now relatively
better taken care of than the women, and that it is therefore the turn
of the Five Hundred to get a modern gymnasium with up-to-date
equipment.
The women's gymnasium buildings are not large enough. The dress
ing rooms are inadequate and the showers are in a pitiable state of
senility. There are not enough lockers even with two women sharing each
one, so that many of the women have been in the habit of dressing at
home for their gym classes, a habit which is inadvisable both esthetically
and hygienically. There is no need to expand on the esthetic value of
keeping those gym suits out of sight, and it is generally known that it is
not good hygiene to saunter leisurely home after violent exercise without
first having taken a shower and changed clothes.
The offices of the department are inadequate, with the five or six
members of the staff crowded together in two small rooms. All in all, it
does look as if it were the turn of the women, if funds cannot be found for
both the men and the women.
