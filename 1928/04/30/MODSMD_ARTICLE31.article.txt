Most people get pleasure out of spending money, but there are many
who would rather save than spend, and every once in awhile some
individual more stinting than his neighbors goes to such extremes that
he is called a miser. Last week a man died in Philadelphia who had
been given this appellation by those who knew him. It is said that he
boasted he could make a wash boiler of soup for fifteen cents that would
feed him for a couple of weeks.
Paul Schelley was this particular miser's name, and he died at the
age of 79. So little thought about was lie, that it was twenty-seven days
after he was last seen before he was discovered dead in a chair in his
home. During his life he wore old clothes held together with strings and
wire, did without socks, neckties, and handkerchiefs, and shaved himself
with an old knife and tallow soap.
As is true with all misers, the legend grew up that he was immensely
wealthy. So, people tried to get into the house to see what they could
find. The jx)lice were forced to guard the house, and reluctantly com
menced a search themselves. And again true to custom, they found
wealth. In an old safe, some two hundred thousand dollars' worth of
securities and twenty thousand dollars in faded currency were found.
Back of an ancient calendar were pinned some five hundred dollars in
currency, and more bonds and stocks were discovered back of pictures.
All told, the sum amounts to around a quarter of a million dollars.
Now the police are making a search for the old man's relatives, to
tell them of the fortune they have coming. Perhaps the miser got much
pleasure out of merely hoarding his money. But even if he did not,
someone will.
