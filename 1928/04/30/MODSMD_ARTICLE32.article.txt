An old Chinese proverb runs "To converse with a superior man for
one night is better than studying books for ten years." But how did this
number one man become superior? Certainly not by merely talking all
his life. Perhaps lie is a man who could see the fact that everything one
does may be generalized and applied to mankind without reading what
has gone on in the past throughout the world. If so, he is a rare man,
as well as a superior one.
It is by reading books—good books, books that have been written
because the writer had something to say, written by men who knew how
to say it, and why it should be said—that most of mankind is able to get
an index of the experiences of the past and apply them to himself. llow
many a man has dated a new era of his life from the reading of a
particular book!
Not only may a man learn by reading; he may find comfort, peace of
mind, excitement, glorious adventure, cheerful companionship, good
counsel. Can he read, a man will never lack friends, he will never be
alone.
In this mechanical, modern, "go-getter," rotary age, we boast that
achievements are being made faster than we can take account of, more
abundantly than ever before. The boast is well-founded. Hut it is well
to remember that ages of great achievement have not always been times |
of intellectual advancement. These great things must be applied, their I
meanings must be understood, and this can only be accomplished by
comparison, comparison of like things of other days.
If you would understand what the superior man has to say, read
books; if you would understand what he is doing, read books.
