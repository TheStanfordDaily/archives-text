GONE ARE THE "HEAPS"
Where are the broken-down Fords
of yesteryear? Where are the wrecks,
wired together, wildly painted, and
wittily lettered, which used to in
trigue the undergraduate? Gone. Say
"Alas!" or "Thank God!" just as you
please, but it is plainly visible that
strictly collegiate motoring is emerg
ing, throttle to the floor, from the
days of chugging 1912 models and
tottering, long-ago-worn-out Fords
into a decade of swifter, smarter, and
more arrestable roadsters.
Compete for Oldest
Two or three years ago the popular
ity of the battered wreck was tre
mendous to the point of actual compe
j tition in obtaining the worst possible
j contraptions. The proud owners of
, these "heaps" basked In the amused
i glances of the people on the high
| ways, and on the campus they were
j traction lords in their fashion who
never went forth unless loaded to the
j guards with acquaintances. Such was
; the day when the special job was
I abandoned for something less con
[ spicuous. Nor were automobiles so
j common 011 the campus then.
Things change. The old Fords, the
I cast-off relics from the second-hand
! yards, are still in evidence, but they
are few and they slip around very
quietly now, and there is little show
of ownership. Gone with the old Ford
is the prejudice against owning a fine
car. Today the finest roadster cre
ates little stir as it spins around —
it is only one among many.
Reflecting the Times
It might be interesting to inquire
into this change which has come so
swiftly and yet so quietly. Probably
in a sense it is a fad. But, more ac
curately, perhaps, it indicates a trend

toward a more sophisticated and lux
urious conception of college, a colle
giate reflection of a phase of modern
life.
With this change, or possibly as a
by-product of it, there has been a
change in the social activity of the
Stanford campus. The campus dances '
have dwindled in number and popu
larity until today, with a few excep
tions, such as the Prom, no date is
much of a date this side of San Fran
cisco.
The result, in this case, is to boost
the cost of "queening" and to put the |
chap without a car at a great disad- ;
vantage, with the further result that
a considerable number of men are
forced out of the social life, and hence !
a less number of women are dated
from the campus. Who wants to take
a date to the city and back on the i
train? (Don't mention taxi bills at 1
both ends.) To what extent this may :
or may not mar the happiness of the !
college days of those concerned, we I
can only guess.
This is not a protest against under-1
graduate ownership of automobiles — ,
as far as we are concerned those who
own a machine should have a perfect
right to use it on the campus or off — i
but rather a plea for a revival of;
something akin to the spirit of the j
days of all-university mixers and such.
What we regret is the waning social
life of the campus, which sickly con- !
dition practically forces one to pro- j
duce a presentable machine or to'
retire from the race.
Because it is too late now to tear
Stanford down and move it nearer
San Francisco, this problem, out of
fairness to the happiness of the whole
group, should invite serious consid
eration. —Jack Springer.

What we regret is the waning social
life of the campus, which sickly con- !
dition practically forces one to pro- j
duce a presentable machine or to'

Because it is too late now to tear

San Francisco, this problem, out of

GONE ARE THE "HEAPS"
Where are the broken-down Fords
of yesteryear? Where are the wrecks,
wired together, wildly painted, and
wittily lettered, which used to in
trigue the undergraduate? Gone. Say
"Alas!" or "Thank God!" just as you
please, but it is plainly visible that
strictly collegiate motoring is emerg
ing, throttle to the floor, from the
days of chugging 1912 models and
tottering, long-ago-worn-out Fords
into a decade of swifter, smarter, and
more arrestable roadsters.
Compete for Oldest
Two or three years ago the popular
ity of the battered wreck was tre
mendous to the point of actual compe
j tition in obtaining the worst possible
j contraptions. The proud owners of
, these "heaps" basked In the amused
i glances of the people on the high
| ways, and on the campus they were
j traction lords in their fashion who
never went forth unless loaded to the
j guards with acquaintances. Such was
; the day when the special job was
I abandoned for something less con
[ spicuous. Nor were automobiles so
j common 011 the campus then.
Things change. The old Fords, the
I cast-off relics from the second-hand
! yards, are still in evidence, but they
are few and they slip around very
quietly now, and there is little show
of ownership. Gone with the old Ford
is the prejudice against owning a fine
car. Today the finest roadster cre
ates little stir as it spins around —
it is only one among many.
Reflecting the Times
It might be interesting to inquire
into this change which has come so
swiftly and yet so quietly. Probably
in a sense it is a fad. But, more ac
curately, perhaps, it indicates a trend

toward a more sophisticated and lux
urious conception of college, a colle
giate reflection of a phase of modern
life.
With this change, or possibly as a
by-product of it, there has been a
change in the social activity of the
Stanford campus. The campus dances '
have dwindled in number and popu
larity until today, with a few excep
tions, such as the Prom, no date is
much of a date this side of San Fran
cisco.
The result, in this case, is to boost
the cost of "queening" and to put the |
chap without a car at a great disad- ;
vantage, with the further result that
a considerable number of men are
forced out of the social life, and hence !
a less number of women are dated
from the campus. Who wants to take
a date to the city and back on the i
train? (Don't mention taxi bills at 1
both ends.) To what extent this may :
or may not mar the happiness of the !
college days of those concerned, we I
can only guess.
This is not a protest against under-1
graduate ownership of automobiles — ,
as far as we are concerned those who
own a machine should have a perfect
right to use it on the campus or off — i
but rather a plea for a revival of;
something akin to the spirit of the j
days of all-university mixers and such.
