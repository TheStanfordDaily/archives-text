# THE 						REVIEWER
## THINGS TO BE SEEN AROUND AND ABOUT 
### 
The little theatre movement seems
the most active sign of life in San
j Francisco this week. Reginald Trav
ers, at the Players Guild, is present
ing "The Mikado," with costumes,
1 voices, and actors in the Gilbert-Sulli
van manner. This breaks the long
armed negroid influence, and person
! ally we find revivals much more en
joyable.
"The Desert Song" and "Interfer-
J ence" continue as before. "Excess
Baggage" is coming to the Geary next
t week, it seems, but we're not taking
any of their advance publicity very
; seriously any more. "Wings" con
tinues to make strong men, women,
; and children weep at the Columbia.
I The amount of war propaganda that
the public has been subjected to in
j the last three months is really alarm
j ingly large.
Garland Anderson has moved "Ap
| pearances" down to the Capitol. For
j his very sincere attempt to put a
j theory over, via the medium of the
* stage, some little admiration is due
| him.
We went down to the Green Street
Theatre, to see the new second act
of "The Married Virgin." That part
of the performance was vastly enter
taining, but the rest of the play was
rotten —in the true sense of the
word. A magnificent woman, Mile.

Rose Dione, with stage experience
from way back, is the outstanding
figure of this "original French farce"
that is interpolated for no good reason
in the old play. She has had some
movie experience, and will be remem
bered as leading the French revolu
tionary mob in "Scaramouche" in
their dance through the city. Too bad
the Green Street doesn't put on pro
grams of one-act plays—so you might
know when to walk in and out.
The Carnegie exhibition of repre
sentative modern European art, now
at the California Palace of the Legion
of Honor, is scarcely in our line to
review, but what with Esthetic class
es in this University, and our low
brow tendency of inertia, we would
like to bring it to your attention. Ex
posure to this sort of thing is really
a very good idea —once in awhile.
This exhibition —or exposition—il
lustrates beautifully all the theories
about art as the application of a tech
nique for the realization of a concep
tion, rather than the application of
technique for the imitation of Nature.
Personally we became a little dizzy
seeing the Czecho-Slovakian school,
and the German left us with a good
deal of doubt as to the wholesome
qualities of the diet of the Teutonic
artists. The neurotic influence of the
war on their imagination is particu
larly strong in contrast with the very
fine work of the Spanish and Italian
schools. —Hallie Keating.

We went down to the Green Street
Theatre, to see the new second act
of "The Married Virgin." That part
of the performance was vastly enter
taining, but the rest of the play was
rotten —in the true sense of the
word. A magnificent woman, Mile.

Rose Dione, with stage experience
from way back, is the outstanding
figure of this "original French farce"
that is interpolated for no good reason
in the old play. She has had some
movie experience, and will be remem
bered as leading the French revolu
tionary mob in "Scaramouche" in
their dance through the city. Too bad
the Green Street doesn't put on pro
grams of one-act plays—so you might
know when to walk in and out.
The Carnegie exhibition of repre
sentative modern European art, now
at the California Palace of the Legion
of Honor, is scarcely in our line to
review, but what with Esthetic class
es in this University, and our low
brow tendency of inertia, we would
like to bring it to your attention. Ex
posure to this sort of thing is really
a very good idea —once in awhile.
This exhibition —or exposition—il
lustrates beautifully all the theories
about art as the application of a tech
nique for the realization of a concep
tion, rather than the application of
technique for the imitation of Nature.
Personally we became a little dizzy
seeing the Czecho-Slovakian school,
and the German left us with a good
deal of doubt as to the wholesome
qualities of the diet of the Teutonic
artists. The neurotic influence of the
war on their imagination is particu
larly strong in contrast with the very
fine work of the Spanish and Italian
schools. —Hallie Keating.
The little theatre movement seems
the most active sign of life in San
j Francisco this week. Reginald Trav
ers, at the Players Guild, is present
ing "The Mikado," with costumes,
1 voices, and actors in the Gilbert-Sulli
van manner. This breaks the long
armed negroid influence, and person
! ally we find revivals much more en
joyable.
"The Desert Song" and "Interfer-
J ence" continue as before. "Excess
Baggage" is coming to the Geary next
t week, it seems, but we're not taking
any of their advance publicity very
; seriously any more. "Wings" con
tinues to make strong men, women,
; and children weep at the Columbia.
I The amount of war propaganda that
the public has been subjected to in
j the last three months is really alarm
j ingly large.
Garland Anderson has moved "Ap
| pearances" down to the Capitol. For
j his very sincere attempt to put a
j theory over, via the medium of the
* stage, some little admiration is due
| him.
