Sophistication is, of course, a very
hard thing to define especially on a
college campus. I mean, students be
lieve in all kinds of free things, and
definitions rather hamper one.
But someone said to me the other
day that sophistication really meant
not believing in anything. I really
don't understand though how an edu
cated person could do the tilings he
does without an ulterior motive.
I mean, if you don't believe that
you are going to get what you want,
why bother trying. The movies said
the other night "a mind is only as
I strong as its weakest think."
I'm sure I believe a lot of nice peo
ple are sophisticated even if they
don't seem to enjoy everything. That
is, they don't want it known that they
j get a kick out of college, but under
| neath, 1 honestly think that sophisti
| cated people are just that way be-
I cause they are cowards. I mean, they
are afraid of being laughed at.
Of course, no one really likes to be
made fun of unless he knows he is
funny, but then he isn't funny. Oh,
dear, life is so complicated and I have
, the hardest time trying to explain
i things. I wish college was more edu
j cational.
I mean, I wish I knew just whom to
believe and whom to trust. Interest
ing people arc so apt to be deceiving.
Not intentionally, of course, but they
I seem to think that if they don't be
; lieve anything that no one else should
take them seriously.
And then, they are angry if you
! tell them that they are doing quite
! well for a mere college rough.
