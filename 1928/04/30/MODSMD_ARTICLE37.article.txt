i The Editor, Sir:
Is there any justice? Consider the
1 cases of two co-eds. One went down
Palm Drive at forty-two miles an
hour; she was fined Twenty-Seven
Dollars! The other went down the
| road next over from Palm Drive,
I passed a deserted intersection at
I thirty-six miles, and was fined Twen
| ty-One Dollars! And did either of
I them have a chance to state their
case when they were up before Wo
men's Council? No! It was merely a
case of make checks payable to Stan
ford Universityâ€”no doubt to help
build another Men's Gymnasium.
I think it is a "crime to lay on fines
j like that, particularly for a first of
j fense. No doubt but what both of
j them should be fined for speeding,
but why devastate a student's finan
cial status in such a brutal way! A
year ago another co-ed was brought
before a Palo Alto police court for
going down Palm Drive at sixty-two
miles an hour. She was fined Fifteen
{Dollars! By the prevailing system on
the campus she would have been
fined forty-seven dollars. It's a pity
that a student couldn't be given at
least ordinary police-court justice.
A Very Mad Co-ed.
