### Hubert Gagos 
By Hubert Gagos

Two hours of splendid musical en
tertainment were presented by thei
Stanford Glee Club at the home con
cert given in the Assembly Hall Fri
day night. C. Albert Kulmann, direc- !
tor, and his ensemble are to be con- j
gratulated upon their musical pro- j
flciency and showmanship.
Timing of the acts, arranged to leave
no breaks in the continuity of the j
program, and a perfect balance and
arrangement of different types of
songs contributed to the effectiveness
of the concert. Kulmann, as director, I
showed a fine appreciation in his
handling of contrasts and nuances of
the well-blended voices.
Program Pleases
"The Builder," by Cadman, "Hail
Us Ye Free," "Invictus," and "March
of the Men of Harlech" were majes
tic in their grandeur. Rich, solid,
resonant, the tone color of the en-1
semble approached that of a profes
sional chorus on these selections.
"Rolling Down to Rio," in a lighter ,
vein, was sung with all the vigor of
Kipling's lines.
Among the softer, smoother songs,
"Sylvia," an encore, and "Suoini's
Song" were the best. The program in
cluded comic songs and the medley
of Stanford songs reproduced on Vic- J
tor records.
Two Solos Given
Jean Jago interpreted Chopin and i
Debussy well in two piano solos and j
an encore. Adelbert Culling, the bari-;
tone soloist, was pleasing in voice, !
manner, and personality.
