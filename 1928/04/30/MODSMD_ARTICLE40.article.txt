# SPORTS OF 1928
## Milwaukee Joe 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
While the slowness of the feet and
the weakness of the arm of aged Ty
Cobb must cause the venerable Cor
nelius McGillicuddy no end of Avorry
as the season gets under way, the re
turn to life of Joe Hauser has bright
ened up the wrinkled manager's pen
nant chances immeasureably. Joe
Hauser, as all baseball fans will no
doubt remember, was one of Connie
Mack' 3 brightest stars back in 1922,
'23, and '24. His batting average for
those three years was .306, and he
proved himself most valuable on de
fense.
Then, just before the 1925 season
opened, Hauser broke his knee cap
and was forced to remain idle all year.
He had trouble coming back in 1926,

j hitting only .192 in 91 games, so
I Mack farmed him out to Kansas City
j where he had a fine year, batting .353,
getting 49 doubles, 22 triples, 20 hom
ers, and stealing 25 bases. "11m'!'
thought old Connie, as he regarded
Hauser's '27 record. "Joe's kneecap
seems to be about O.K. now. Guess
I can use him again at first next
i season."
So Joe got his job back again, and
, in the spring training season batted
out many a steaming hit that delight
ed his elongated boss. On Friday,
April 13, in a game with the Yanks
at Philadelphia, Joe got two rousing
homers and a triple out of four times
at bat. It looks as if Hauser has come
back to stay.
