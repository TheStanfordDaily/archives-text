# Trophies Captured On African Trek To Be Given To Stanford Museum
## Skulls of Elephants, Hippopotami, Rhinoceros, Various Other Jungle Animals Presented by Walker Brothers 
### Allan Hart 
A number of valuable specimens of
big game, animals from the interior
of Africa, will be presented to the
Stanford Museum by Fletcher Walker,
'2fi, and Kenneth Walker, '27, it was
learned yesterday. These specimens
have just arrived from the East, and
certain large skulls will be presented
immediately.
The skulls to be presented to the
museum include those of an elephant.,
a rhinorecos, a hippopotamus, and
various caniverous animals such as
the lion, hyena, leopard, wild dog,
cheetah, and jackal. Whether or not
a number of mounted specimens will
be added to this list depends on the
attitude of the University, Kenneth
Walker said yesterday.
Plan Exhibits
"We hope to work out a scheme
whereby complete groups of various
horned specimens, such as gazelles
and antelopes, will be shown in their
natural habitats," said Walker when
interviewed. "However, this is mere

ly a plan and is not at all definite."
Leaving Stanford in March of 1927
the two Walkers were joined in the
East by Dr. Thomas S. Arbuthnot, ex
dean of the Pittsburgh Medical
School, who has collected specimens
for the Carnegie Institute in the past.
The party proceeded to London, and
there was equipped with proper
clothes and heavy rifles.
The party sailed from Geona on
June 9, 1927, and headed for Mom
basa on the east coast of British East
Africa. Prom here they went by train
to Moschi in Tanganyaka, where they
boarded trucks and started for
Arusha, their jumping-off place from
civilization.
At Arusha they loaded their equip
ment on two trucks and headed for
the jungles. Their hunting country
was around Lake Manyaro and
the N'Goren Goro Crater. This coun
try was the background of Stewart
Edward White's story, "Back of Be
yond."
