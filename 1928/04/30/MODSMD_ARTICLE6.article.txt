# Trophies Captured On African Trek To Be Given To Stanford Museum
## Skulls of Elephants, Hippopotami, Rhinoceros, Various Other Jungle Animals Presented by Walker Brothers 
### Allan Hart 
A number of valuable specimens of
big game, animals from the interior
of Africa, will be presented to the
Stanford Museum by Fletcher Walker,
'2fi, and Kenneth Walker, '27, it was
learned yesterday. These specimens
have just arrived from the East, and
certain large skulls will be presented
immediately.
The skulls to be presented to the
museum include those of an elephant.,
a rhinorecos, a hippopotamus, and
various caniverous animals such as
the lion, hyena, leopard, wild dog,
cheetah, and jackal. Whether or not
a number of mounted specimens will
be added to this list depends on the
attitude of the University, Kenneth
Walker said yesterday.
Plan Exhibits
"We hope to work out a scheme
whereby complete groups of various
horned specimens, such as gazelles
and antelopes, will be shown in their
natural habitats," said Walker when
interviewed. "However, this is mere

ly a plan and is not at all definite."
Leaving Stanford in March of 1927
the two Walkers were joined in the
East by Dr. Thomas S. Arbuthnot, ex
dean of the Pittsburgh Medical
School, who has collected specimens
for the Carnegie Institute in the past.
The party proceeded to London, and
there was equipped with proper
clothes and heavy rifles.
The party sailed from Geona on
June 9, 1927, and headed for Mom
basa on the east coast of British East
Africa. Prom here they went by train
to Moschi in Tanganyaka, where they
boarded trucks and started for
Arusha, their jumping-off place from
civilization.
At Arusha they loaded their equip
ment on two trucks and headed for
the jungles. Their hunting country
was around Lake Manyaro and
the N'Goren Goro Crater. This coun
try was the background of Stewart
Edward White's story, "Back of Be
yond."
For three and a half months the
party hunted, moving about from one
country to another.
"The country as a whole was ac
cessible by truck; wo would move
150 or 200 miles to a new hunting
country where we would go to the
local sultan, head of the village. From
liim we would secure fifty or sixty
boys, and with our equipment on their
beads, would start on a foot safari
into country inaccessible to travel by
truck. We would be gone ten to
twenty days."
Bag Many Trophies
The party hunted for three and a
half months. Each of the white men
secured an elephant, and in addition
bagged a rhinoceros apiece, three
leopards, three cheetahs, twenty-two
lions, a number of water buffalo, hip
popotami, antelopes, gazelles, kudus,
wildebeests, congoni, wart hawks, os
trich, impannas, and others. Motion
pictures were kept of each day's hunt
ing, and about 1200 snapshots were
taken and developed.
"Natives in this part of the country
have all felt the effects of civiliza
tion and, except in the most inacces
sible parts, have been forced to give
up cannibalism,'* said Walker. "But
wives were quoted at thirty shillings
apiece.''
"Freeze at Equator"
On completion of their hunt they

started north in the trucks, going first
to Nairobi. As they crossed the equa
tor, Walker says, they "nearly froze
to death" on account of the high alti
tude. From Nairobi their route lay
through Uganda, along the edge of
the Congo, to the town of Re jab on
the headwaters of the White Nile in
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
From here they went down-stream
by steamer as far as Khartoum, at
the junction of the Blue and the
White Nile, where they boarded a
train for Wadihalfa. From here they
went by boat to Assuan, and from
there by train to aCiro.
The total distance from their hunt
ing country to Cairo was about 3500
miles, and they covered this distance
in the remarkable time of twenty-five
days. The first thousand miles was
covered by truck in nine days.
The party was on good roads all
the way and could go forty miles an
hour. It was nine mouths away from
the United States.

150 or 200 miles to a new hunting
country where we would go to the
local sultan, head of the village. From
liim we would secure fifty or sixty
boys, and with our equipment on their
beads, would start on a foot safari
into country inaccessible to travel by
truck. We would be gone ten to
twenty days."
Bag Many Trophies
The party hunted for three and a
half months. Each of the white men
secured an elephant, and in addition
bagged a rhinoceros apiece, three
leopards, three cheetahs, twenty-two
lions, a number of water buffalo, hip
popotami, antelopes, gazelles, kudus,
wildebeests, congoni, wart hawks, os
trich, impannas, and others. Motion
pictures were kept of each day's hunt
ing, and about 1200 snapshots were
taken and developed.
"Natives in this part of the country
have all felt the effects of civiliza
tion and, except in the most inacces
sible parts, have been forced to give
up cannibalism,'* said Walker. "But
wives were quoted at thirty shillings
apiece.''
"Freeze at Equator"
On completion of their hunt they

started north in the trucks, going first
to Nairobi. As they crossed the equa
tor, Walker says, they "nearly froze
to death" on account of the high alti
tude. From Nairobi their route lay
through Uganda, along the edge of
the Congo, to the town of Re jab on
the headwaters of the White Nile in
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
From here they went down-stream
by steamer as far as Khartoum, at
the junction of the Blue and the
White Nile, where they boarded a
train for Wadihalfa. From here they
went by boat to Assuan, and from
there by train to aCiro.
The total distance from their hunt
ing country to Cairo was about 3500
miles, and they covered this distance
in the remarkable time of twenty-five
days. The first thousand miles was
covered by truck in nine days.
The party was on good roads all
the way and could go forty miles an
hour. It was nine mouths away from
the United States.
A number of valuable specimens of
big game, animals from the interior
of Africa, will be presented to the
Stanford Museum by Fletcher Walker,
'2fi, and Kenneth Walker, '27, it was
learned yesterday. These specimens
have just arrived from the East, and
certain large skulls will be presented
immediately.
The skulls to be presented to the
museum include those of an elephant.,
a rhinorecos, a hippopotamus, and
various caniverous animals such as
the lion, hyena, leopard, wild dog,
cheetah, and jackal. Whether or not
a number of mounted specimens will
be added to this list depends on the
attitude of the University, Kenneth
Walker said yesterday.
Plan Exhibits
"We hope to work out a scheme
whereby complete groups of various
horned specimens, such as gazelles
and antelopes, will be shown in their
natural habitats," said Walker when
interviewed. "However, this is mere

ly a plan and is not at all definite."
Leaving Stanford in March of 1927
the two Walkers were joined in the
East by Dr. Thomas S. Arbuthnot, ex
dean of the Pittsburgh Medical
School, who has collected specimens
for the Carnegie Institute in the past.
The party proceeded to London, and
there was equipped with proper
clothes and heavy rifles.
The party sailed from Geona on
June 9, 1927, and headed for Mom
basa on the east coast of British East
Africa. Prom here they went by train
to Moschi in Tanganyaka, where they
boarded trucks and started for
Arusha, their jumping-off place from
civilization.
At Arusha they loaded their equip
ment on two trucks and headed for
the jungles. Their hunting country
was around Lake Manyaro and
the N'Goren Goro Crater. This coun
try was the background of Stewart
Edward White's story, "Back of Be
yond."
For three and a half months the
party hunted, moving about from one

big game, animals from the interior
of Africa, will be presented to the
Stanford Museum by Fletcher Walker,
'2fi, and Kenneth Walker, '27, it was
learned yesterday. These specimens
have just arrived from the East, and
certain large skulls will be presented
immediately.
The skulls to be presented to the
museum include those of an elephant.,
a rhinorecos, a hippopotamus, and
various caniverous animals such as
the lion, hyena, leopard, wild dog,
cheetah, and jackal. Whether or not
a number of mounted specimens will
be added to this list depends on the
attitude of the University, Kenneth
Walker said yesterday.
Plan Exhibits
"We hope to work out a scheme
whereby complete groups of various
horned specimens, such as gazelles
and antelopes, will be shown in their
natural habitats," said Walker when
interviewed. "However, this is mere

ly a plan and is not at all definite."
Leaving Stanford in March of 1927
the two Walkers were joined in the
East by Dr. Thomas S. Arbuthnot, ex
dean of the Pittsburgh Medical
School, who has collected specimens
for the Carnegie Institute in the past.
The party proceeded to London, and
there was equipped with proper
clothes and heavy rifles.
The party sailed from Geona on
June 9, 1927, and headed for Mom
basa on the east coast of British East
Africa. Prom here they went by train
to Moschi in Tanganyaka, where they
boarded trucks and started for
Arusha, their jumping-off place from
civilization.
At Arusha they loaded their equip
ment on two trucks and headed for
the jungles. Their hunting country
was around Lake Manyaro and
the N'Goren Goro Crater. This coun
try was the background of Stewart
Edward White's story, "Back of Be
yond."
For three and a half months the
party hunted, moving about from one
country to another.
"The country as a whole was ac
cessible by truck; wo would move
150 or 200 miles to a new hunting
country where we would go to the
local sultan, head of the village. From
liim we would secure fifty or sixty
boys, and with our equipment on their
beads, would start on a foot safari
into country inaccessible to travel by
truck. We would be gone ten to
twenty days."
Bag Many Trophies
The party hunted for three and a
half months. Each of the white men
secured an elephant, and in addition
bagged a rhinoceros apiece, three
leopards, three cheetahs, twenty-two
lions, a number of water buffalo, hip
popotami, antelopes, gazelles, kudus,
wildebeests, congoni, wart hawks, os
trich, impannas, and others. Motion
pictures were kept of each day's hunt
ing, and about 1200 snapshots were
taken and developed.
"Natives in this part of the country
have all felt the effects of civiliza
tion and, except in the most inacces
sible parts, have been forced to give
up cannibalism,'* said Walker. "But
wives were quoted at thirty shillings
apiece.''
"Freeze at Equator"
On completion of their hunt they

started north in the trucks, going first
to Nairobi. As they crossed the equa
tor, Walker says, they "nearly froze
to death" on account of the high alti
tude. From Nairobi their route lay
through Uganda, along the edge of
the Congo, to the town of Re jab on
the headwaters of the White Nile in
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
From here they went down-stream
by steamer as far as Khartoum, at
the junction of the Blue and the
White Nile, where they boarded a
train for Wadihalfa. From here they
went by boat to Assuan, and from
there by train to aCiro.
The total distance from their hunt
ing country to Cairo was about 3500
miles, and they covered this distance
in the remarkable time of twenty-five
days. The first thousand miles was
covered by truck in nine days.
The party was on good roads all
the way and could go forty miles an
hour. It was nine mouths away from
the United States.
