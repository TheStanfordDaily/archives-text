# FACULTY COMMITTEE PLANS MEMORIAL TO REV. FLETCHER DOLE
## Circular Letter Solicits Aid To Found Book Fund For Scholarship 
### 
With the idea of establishing a
scholarship or book fund at Stanford
as a memorial to the late Rev. Charles
Fletcher Dole, a group of faculty men
have formed themselves into a com
mittee to receive voluntary contribu
tions for this purpose.
Mr. Dole, the committee points out
in a circular letter it has sent to his
friends, was admired throughout the
United States and was particularly
close to Stanford through the large
number of relatives who have been
students at the University, and
through his contacts with Dr. David
Starr Jordan in work for world peace.
Friend of Jordan
"The Dole family has been rep
resented in the student body almost
continuously since the doors of the
University were opened in 1891," the
letter says, "and a grandson is now
a student here. There was a strong
bond of sympathy between Rev. Dole
and David Starr Jordan, in the ardor
with which both men worked for the
cause of peace.
Memorial Planned
"It has occurred to some of Mr.
Dole's Stanford admirers that it
would be pleasant and appropriate to
establish a memorial here in com
memoration of one whose life was a
beautiful realization of those spiritual
ideals which it should be the highest
concern of the University to foster. It
is hoped that a sum may be realized
sufficient to establish a scholarship
or a fund for the purchase of books
relating to the peace movement."
The committee does not plan any
more intensive effort to raise funds
than is involved in sending out this
letter. Contributions, the letter says,
may be mailed to J. Pearce Mitchell,
who is treasurer of the Dole Memo
rial Committee. The other members
are Professor B. O. Foster, chairman,
John A. Sollards, secretary, and Pro
fessor Frank A. Colder.
