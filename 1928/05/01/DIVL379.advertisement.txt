Dear Sirs:
Just aconfessionandan appreciation.
A number of years ago I was a user
of your Edgeworth smoking tobacco.
But likesome others, perhaps, I was led
by alluring advertisements to change.
A few days ago I went into a drug
store to get some tobacco, and on the
case was the familiar can of Edgeworth.
I bought it and since then I have en
joyed old-time comfort.
So my confession is that I made a
mistake in changing to other brands,
and my appreciation is such that Edge
worth will be my Smoke Pal while life
lasts, which may not be long, for I
have passed my "three score years and
ten."
Very truly yours,
(signed) E. P. Fishburn
