# LINDBERGH'S PLANE PLACED IN AVIATION EXHIBIT AT CAPITAL
## "WE" FLY LAST TIME Smithsonian Institute Gets "Spirit of St. Louis" As Flight Relic 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 30. —
(U.P.) —The "Spirit of St. Louis" glided j
gracefully to earth at Boiling Field short
ly after 3 o'clock today to end its active, J
historic career and spend the rest of its
days among the antiquaries of the Smith
sonian Institution.
Its owner, Col. Charles A. Lindbergh,
flew it here from Lambert Field, St.
Louis, to turn it over to Smithsonian of
ficials—fulfilling a promise made after
the immortal flight from New York to j
Paris.
Unless ■ a sentimental impulse over
comes Col. Lindbergh later, he has taken
his famous plane into the air for the last
time. For so far as is known now the
"Spirit of St. Louis" has permanently
retired from active partnership in the
famous firm of "We."
The "Spirit of St. Louis" left its natu- j
ral element—the air—probably for the ;
last time after a short but active life of j
less than one year, during which it won
immortal fame for itself and its pilot, was
the first to span the Atlantic from New
York to Paris, and covered more than
43,000 miles in this country, Latin Amer
ica, and abroad.
Within a few days it will be dismantled, I
suffer the ignominy of being hauled by j
auto truck to the red brick building of i
the Institution, and be reassembled and I
placed on exhibition with other planes j
which have made aviation history.
