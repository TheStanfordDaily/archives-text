HALIFAX, N.S., April 30.—(U.P.)—
Twenty-four men, the entire crew of the
Dutch steamer Collisto, were believed to
have been lost when the ship foundered
off Louisburg, N.S.
The first report to reach Louisburg was
that a steamer was in distress off Scat
tcrie, having gone ashore in a fog. With
the lifting of the fog today, however,
patrols reported there was no indication
of where the ship had been ashore. A
life boat and a door were picked up off
Kelp Cove.
The Collisto was bound for Louisburg
from Rotterdam.
The Collisto is a steel screw steamer,
built in Rotterdam in 1920, and managed
by G. Iludig and J. Veder. The ship is
377 feet long and carries wireless.
