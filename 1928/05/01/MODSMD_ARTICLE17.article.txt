# Universal Tongue Favored As Bond Between Nations
## Rogers, Noted Esperantist, Shows Need of Improved Communication 
### 
"A universal language will help to
bind people of different races to
gether," said E. A. Rogers, president
of the Montezuma School, and inter
nationally known Esperantist, last
night in a lecture in the Women's
i Clubhouse. "Increased facilities of
| communication are becoming more
necessary as improved transportation
lessens distances."
Rogers described the origin of Es
peranto. Dr. Ludovic Zamenof, a Pole,
took Latin roots also found in other
languages, and added about forty pre
fixes and suffixes. This is all there
is to the new tongue, but it expresses
all shades of meaning. It can be
grasped in only a few lessons. There
is not an irregular construction in the
language.
Welcome Esperanto
"Scientists welcome Esperanto,"
declared Rogers, "since their works
may be transmitted more rapidly by
means of.it. The diplomatic service
needs a neutral universal language.
The great number of translations now
necessary make delegates suspicious.
Business men can make good use of
it since it saves long-winded interpre
tations."
Rogers commended Stanford on the
| stand it had taken in not including
l a foreign language in entrance re
quirements. "The study of foreign
; languages, especially Latin, take up
valuable time which could be spent
in learning more useful things," he
said. "If Esperanto could be substi
tuted time could be saved. If colleges
would recognize it as a study, people
| would turn to it readily.
Do Not Realize Need
"Americans do not realize the need
: for a knowledge of languages. In Eu
rope a different language is spoken
every few hundred miles. That is why
i Esperanto is taking faster over there.
! But the Americans are beginning to
j recognize its importance. They will
! take it up when they find it will help
| them in matters of dollars and cents."
The lecture was followed by a pro
gram of songs and a short play by
some of the pupils of the Montezuma
School.
