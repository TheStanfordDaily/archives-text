# TEMPLETON STRESSES NECESSITY OF FORM IN WOMEN'S ATHLETICS
## 
### 
The need of practice in track was
stressed by "Dink" Templeton yester
day with some of the members of the
class in women's track, when he gave
them suggestions and advice on de
veloping their form in view of becom
ing real athletes. He said that no one
should try to do anything in track
unless she really likes to work, and
is willing to spend a great deal of
time improving her technique.
"One advantage men have over wo
men is the fact that they have had
training and practice in athletics of
all sorts from grammar school up,"
Templeton said. "Girls who expect to
begin participating in track events
when they enter college will find a
great deal of difficulty in learning the
form in a short time. There are prob
ably only a few girls who can master
the lay-out form of high jump with
out previous training in it."
Templeton expects to train Marion
Holley in the high jump for partici
pation in the Olympic Games in the
summer. He observed a num'uoi' of
the other members of the class, and
he believes that Thelma Patten
should make an excellent hurdler, and
that Lydia Bowen could, with prac
tice, break the existing shot put rec
ord.
