# BIG WELCOME GIVEN CREW OF BREMEN AT NEW YORK CARNIVAL
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 30.—(U.P.)—A
roar of welcome reverberated against
cloud-banked skies and made Manhattan
| Island a bedlam today as the city staged
I a Roman spectacle of triumph for the
three flying men of the Bremen.
Flag-bedecked boats traced the waters
surrounding the island. Airplanes in
droning fleets flew overhead. The sky
scrapers of lower New York and the
marble-fagaded buildings of Fifth Avenue
showered torn paper and streamers until
the air glittered and hurt the eyes. The
canyons of Broadway and Fifth Avenue
for a distance of five miles were carpeted
| with humanity.
Hundreds of thousands of voices
j cheered the progress of the three guests
through the tides of people. Several mil
lion listened to the noise and tumult by
radio.
