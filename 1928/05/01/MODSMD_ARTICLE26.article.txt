# HOOVER, SMITH TEST TODAY IN PRIMARY VOTE
## Eyes of Nation on California As Strength of Hoover Awaits Sanction SUPPORTERS CONFIDENT Smith, Walsh, and Reed Are Center of Democratic Interest in State 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 30.—( U.P.)
—Delegations favoring three Democratic
candidates for President and one that has
pledged to vote for Herbert Hoover for
the Republican nomination drew the at
tention of the United States tonight, the
eve of California's presidential primary
election.
Although interest was centered on the
three-cornered battle of Alfred E. Smith
of New York, Thomas J. Walsh of Mon
tana, and James A. Reed of Missouri, for
votes of the Democrats, the size of the
vote drawn by Hoover was also awaited
with anxiety.
Hoover Sole Republican
The Secretary of Commerce was un
opposed hy any official entrant and there
have not been any indications of a "write
in" campaign against him.
Consequently his friends have been try
ing for many weeks to enthuse the party,
which has three-fourths of the total reg
istration of California, to make Hoover's
total vote one of unquestionable magni
tude.
Heartened by predictions that Tuesday
will be fair throughout the state, Hoover's
workers were confident that he would poll
the largest vote ever secured by a Re
publican presidential candidate in Cali
fornia.
The effect of the Democratic campaigns
was much more puzzling. Because Smith
was first to start a campaign here his
chances for victory have seemed to many
to have been magnified by the additional
propaganda.
Smith Strength in North
The predominance of Smith strength
seemed to be in Northern California,
however, while Walsh's friends claimed
their stronghold was Southern California.
If the Walsh group, which has been
headed by William Gibbs McAdoo, a
national figure of the party, was correct
in its assertion, the election should be
very close. Southern California Demo
crats decidedly outnumber those in the
north.
While the Reed faction failed to im
press its opponents to any great extent
at the start, it seemed to be worrying
both camps with less than twelve hours
left before the polls are opened.
