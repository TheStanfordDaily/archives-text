# Kenneth Walker Relates Narrow Escape On Hunting Trip In Africa
## 
### Allan Hart 
"Did you have any close escapes:
"Plenty of 'em," said Kenneth
Walker, '27, when asked about the
hunting expedition from which he and
his brother, Fletcher Walker, '26,
have just returned.
"One day my brother and I set off
in search of some water buffalo, tak
were walking through grass about
ing with us our elephant rifles. We
six feet high, in single file, along a ;
game trail. My brother's gun boy was
in the lead, my brother was number
two man, my gun bearer third, and I
brought up the rear. On a particularly
rough stretch of the trail we had
been walking along quietly—you
never talk on these foot safaris —
when suddenly my brother spoke
quickly to his gun boy. Glancing up,
I saw him reach for his gun, and I j
realized that we had stumbled on
dangerous gamo.
Kills Lion
i "I just had enough presence of mind j

to grab my own rifle as my gun boy
ran past. Whirling about I saw my
brother bowl over a huge black
mailed lion which had risen from the
grass. No sooner had he fired than,
within a radius of fifty yards, eleven
more lions and lionesses rose up, and
three of these charged at once.
"There was no chance to run, and
there were just the two rifles, with
two shots each, between us. We
dropped the three that charged, and
after quickly reloading our guns wero
able to get two more lions before
they got away.
We now had the interesting job of
"walking up" the wounded lions as
they lay in the grass. This was ac
complished by slowly walking through
the grass until the lion would rise up
and roar, preparatory to charging,
when one or two shots from the big
guns would stop them before they
got well started. The charge of the
first three lions probably lasted for
a ten-second period, but it took us
about twenty minutes to round up
our wounded lions.
Used Various Guns
"What kind of rifles did we use?
Well, our elephant guns were 475
Jefferies and shot a 500-grain bullet.
A shot from one of these simply shat
tered the skull of a lion. Then we
used 30 Springfields, which shot a

220-grain bullet."
The hunting ground used by the
Walkers was about 300 miles in from
the coast of British East Africa, and
three or four degrees south of the
equator. The nearest civilization was
a military post about 150 miles away. !
A complete motion picture record
of the trip was kept and is now being
developed at Universal City. In addi-'
tion about 1200 snaps were taken. :
"We probably 'shot' more big game
with our cameras than with our
guns," said Walker.
Much of the time the party was
in high, open country, surrounded by
snow-capped peaks. But on the re
turn trip, going down the Nile, they
passed through a papyrus swamp
16,000 square miles in extent. Papyruß
grass often grows to a height of
twenty feet.

game trail. My brother's gun boy was
in the lead, my brother was number
two man, my gun bearer third, and I
brought up the rear. On a particularly
rough stretch of the trail we had
been walking along quietly—you
never talk on these foot safaris —
when suddenly my brother spoke
quickly to his gun boy. Glancing up,
I saw him reach for his gun, and I j
realized that we had stumbled on
dangerous gamo.
Kills Lion
i "I just had enough presence of mind j

to grab my own rifle as my gun boy
ran past. Whirling about I saw my
brother bowl over a huge black
mailed lion which had risen from the
grass. No sooner had he fired than,
within a radius of fifty yards, eleven
more lions and lionesses rose up, and
three of these charged at once.
"There was no chance to run, and
there were just the two rifles, with
two shots each, between us. We
dropped the three that charged, and
after quickly reloading our guns wero
able to get two more lions before
they got away.
We now had the interesting job of
"walking up" the wounded lions as
they lay in the grass. This was ac
complished by slowly walking through
the grass until the lion would rise up
and roar, preparatory to charging,
when one or two shots from the big
guns would stop them before they
got well started. The charge of the
first three lions probably lasted for
a ten-second period, but it took us
about twenty minutes to round up
our wounded lions.
Used Various Guns
"What kind of rifles did we use?
Well, our elephant guns were 475
Jefferies and shot a 500-grain bullet.
A shot from one of these simply shat
tered the skull of a lion. Then we
used 30 Springfields, which shot a

220-grain bullet."
The hunting ground used by the
Walkers was about 300 miles in from
the coast of British East Africa, and
three or four degrees south of the
equator. The nearest civilization was
a military post about 150 miles away. !
A complete motion picture record
of the trip was kept and is now being
developed at Universal City. In addi-'
tion about 1200 snaps were taken. :
"We probably 'shot' more big game
with our cameras than with our
guns," said Walker.
Much of the time the party was
in high, open country, surrounded by
snow-capped peaks. But on the re
turn trip, going down the Nile, they
passed through a papyrus swamp
16,000 square miles in extent. Papyruß
grass often grows to a height of
twenty feet.
"Did you have any close escapes:
"Plenty of 'em," said Kenneth
Walker, '27, when asked about the
hunting expedition from which he and
his brother, Fletcher Walker, '26,
have just returned.
"One day my brother and I set off
in search of some water buffalo, tak
were walking through grass about
ing with us our elephant rifles. We
six feet high, in single file, along a ;
game trail. My brother's gun boy was
