Ho, hum! Student Government! A short time ago the newspaper at
the University of Arizona made a violent attack on the institution of
student control. The Oregon Emerald and several other college papers
have also had something vicious to say on the subject recently, some
maintaining hotly that the studes must have their rights, they've got 'em
and they must keep 'em. Just as vehemently, the other side comes back
that there is no student government, that college presidents and faculties
run the school, and just turn over the little mechanical jobs to the
students.
Some professor or instructor, or gentleman of collegiate affiliation in
the East said, in essence: "Aw, let 'em have their committees and presi
dents and chairmen and councils. It doesn't mean anything anyway,
doesn't stop us from doing what we want to do, and it gives them a feel
ing of satisfaction." Well, there you are.
Certainly it is foolish to pretend that students do have ultimate control
in the things they seemingly manage. Suppose the president doesn't like
a ruling of the disciplinary council—he sends a little note to the council
and asks the members if they don't think it would be much more expe
ditious to do thus-and-so. Oh, sure, writes back the council, we didn't
see the matter in just that light before. You're right, it ought to be thus
and-so. And the ruling is changed to thus-and-so.
Nevertheless, even though the final say may be taken away at infre
quent times, the university administrations usually leave the students in
charge of much of the student body business. This, in itself, is the valu
able thing to the parties of the first part. They are getting experience in
passing the buck and telling the tryoutees what to do, and passing laws,
and making rulings, and controlling funds, just like they do in "real" life.
