California's commission to investigate juvenile delinquency discussed
the topic of sex education at a meeting last week. One of the members
brought up the question of giving a course having to do with sex edu
cation, but not specifically designated as such. "As soon as you advertise
sex teaching as such you won't get very far," was the statement of
Charles C. Hughes, city superintendent of schools, of Sacramento. "The
subject must be taught in a subtle way."
Anyway, they are discussing the problem with a little frankness. In
late years youth itself has reached out because it wanted to know things,
and has found out many items the prudish nineties kept to its oldsters.
Now people are beginning to wake up a bit and discover that perhaps it
isn't the best thing to conceal too much. The best policy is to enlighten
youngsters. If it is done in the right way, instead of leaving it up to
them to find out as they will, perhaps the homes for delinquents will not
be so well patronized.
Dr. Mariana Bertola, of San Francisco, says, "It is the wrong thing
to give such knowledge until they have developed the self-control that is
needed to accompany the sex impulse." The doctor evidently believes that
it is best to close the stable door after the horse has got away. Knowledge
is needed to develop that self-control she speaks about.
At another time during the meeting of the commission, Mr. Hughes
was asked at what age it was best to "begin education into the mystery of
life." He answered the question squarely this time, and with sense:
"When the child begins to be curious."
