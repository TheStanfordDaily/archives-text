Dr. Wilbur had a good luinch when he said that the only way the
women could get their new gymnasium was for the entire Five Hundred
to organize and agitate as a body. Miss Bunting has done her share in
finding out what the probable cost would be, and in planning out the
proposed new building to include everything the women might need. Now
the thing is for the women to get together, discuss the question, settle on
a line of action, and follow it up.
Janet Harris, new president of Associated Women, has included the
drive for a gymnasium in her program for next year. Chesterlyn Thomas,
Women's Athletic Association president, has declared herself in favor
of such a move, and it is fairly safe to say that W.A.A., whoever may be
at its head next year, will back up any plans for a new gym.
Dr. Wilbur evidently wants the women to have new quarters; the
Physical Education department wants them; the women's leaders want
them. What is necessary to put the thing over is concerted backing of
these leaders by all of the women.
One good way of making money these days is to become an art critic
and go around hunting in cellars and garrets for old oil paintings, buy
'em for a song, call 'em Corots, Rembrandts, or something of the like,
Unci make a few thousand dollars a throw.
The editorial staff will meet at 1 o'clock today in the Daily office.
