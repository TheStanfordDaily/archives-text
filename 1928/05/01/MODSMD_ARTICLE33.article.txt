## PHILOSOPHERS, BOOTLEGGERS, BANDITS, AND OTHERS 
### 
The remarks which foreigners leave
: behind at the dock in New York are
always ample and are sometimes, in
addition, illuminating. Count Hermann
Keyserling, German philosophical
writer, is no exception to the rule.
| While the ship which was conveying
him back to the fatherland was get
ting up steam he had time to con
clude that Americans are not yet
thinkers, although "in time they may
become rational." Any mental exer
tion, even a few minutes of intense
conversation, induces great fatigue
! in us, he said.
Only a few minutes, of intense con
| versation, Count? Is it not a wonder,
then, that anybody survives rushing?
(You win, Count; it is a wonder.)
When riding in an airplane one
should only register nonchalance
if a wing collapses, the engine
falls out, or the 'plane gets into
an uncontrollable nose dive. Such
things are to be expected. But
to get shot in the foot while hy
ing is a different matter.
Such was the Acliilles-like fate
of an air passenger in Los An-

geles. The 'plane had been flying
at a low altitude, and police be
lieve the bullet was fired in re
prisal by persons whose sleep had
j been disturbed by the droning of
the motor.
The woman who screams over a
; mere holdup had best not go into
i business. When a girl usher in Chi
j cago screamed as three armed and
j masked men stepped up to the
cashier's cage of a Chicago movie,
; one of the trio calmly sent a bullet
through her by way of reprimand.
The second bandit, just as calmly,
gathered up the $1400 in booty, and
the third, to be occupied, fired both
barrels of his sawed-off shotgun in
the general direction of the 2100
patrons, narrowly missing one of the
managers.
Along with the tanks of whiskey.
Michigan bootleggers have taken to
carrying tanks of poison gas. These
are loosened against any officers who
should chance to give chase.
This, is putting one over on the
Chicago hard babies, who are' still
back in the machine gun stage.
