"Love and I." Ednah Aiken, Dodd,
Mead & Co.
Mrs. Aiken's books are always wel
comed, not only because of the merit
of lier work, but because of our inter
est in the novels of this particularly
Californian group of authors. "Love
! and I" is the first published book of
Mrs. Aiken's for some time, and its
appearance has been awaited with in
terest.
The story of Marcia Robbins, of
I Warren Gaunt, and of Crystal Way
.
man, is told with an unusual tech
nique. Scarcely stream-of-conscious
ness, and scarcely with hard-finish.
Gaunt's viewpoint is maintained
throughout, but the curious alchemy
with which three hundred and fifty
three pages are kept from dull intro
spection is a secret of the author's
own.
Situation Cruel
Beginning with a cruel situation —a
wife surprising her weak husband in
a clandestine affair —the story pro
gresses through all the ugly phases
of the catastrophe, with Gaunt, the
friend, smoothing and covering up all
he can. Then two women, living under
the same roof, both having loved the
same man, both fearing each other —
and the influence of Gaunt, solving
their problems.
One of the very pleasant features
of "Love and I" is that Mrs. Aiken
does not force you to accept her
theories,, at the point of a gun. It is
impossible to believe anyone could
read this, and not have his ideas of
life a little affected. But in spite of
the fact that nearly every character
here has a ruling philosophy, you are
not obliged to agree one way or the
other. The curious contrast of the
extremely devout Catholic, and equal
ly devout Christian Scientist, is
rather significant.
Local Setting
The story is laid in the peninsula,
and environments of San Francisco.
This description of San Jose amused
us particularly: "It was years now, a

decade, perhaps . . . since progress,
American energy, had awakened San
Jose. Cheerfully, the town of southern
' habits had flung open her doors, but
she was unprepared, her hospitality
I was taxed. It was as though a grand
mother were trying to make room in
her house of old-fashioned limitations
i for all her unassorted relatives —up-
j to-date American grandchildren, . . .
i and a quaint old-time foreign grand
i mother." —Hallie Keating.
