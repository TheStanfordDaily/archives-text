Dear Very-Mad-Co-ed:
No, there isn't any justice yet; may- j
be there will be some day, but not
now. When you have amateur judges
backed up by a sense of mightiness
and righteousness, what do you ex
pect? And when, in the bargain, said
judges have a beautiful little code
that can be learned by rote there isn't
any place for justice. That iniquitous
consideration of a defendant's reasons
for speeding or the particular case of
how dangerous it may have been is
put aside for the rhyme the judges
sing: "A dollar a mile for every mile,
a dollar a mile for every mile, etc." j
You see, justice is an outside con- J
sideration; it is merely a pseudonym!
for the process of punishment. If you j
are too broke to own a car and there- :
fore borrow one, and if, at the same
time, you go thirty-five miles an hour
past a deserted intersection that is
guarded by an arterial anyhow, you
should pay half your month's allow
ance just the same as if you owned
a foreign car and the fine meant only j
the deprivation of your bi-weekly j
party. No, no, my dear, you mustn't :
expect justice; that would be too j
much work for the judges, and be- ;
sides, don't you see, it would invali
date their pretty rhyme: "A dollar a
mile for every mile, a dollar a mile J
for every mile, etc."
And don't be so vindicative about
the men's gymnasium; we're every i
bit as griped about it as you all are,
even if we are glad to have some hot
showers for the first time in five
years. Everything will pass in time,
don't worry; it only took three years
to abolish dinks and four years to
abolish nonsmoking for women. Be
philosophical, even about the Coun
cils; give 'em time and they'll sn \* j
out of it. â€”Mad But Philosophical. |

The war has changed the spirit of j
European institutions to a democratic i
character, according to Raoul Georges !

sity, Louvain, Belgium.
