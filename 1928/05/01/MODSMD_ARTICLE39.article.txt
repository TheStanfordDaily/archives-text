# HERE'S A SCOTCH JOKE Use Gags For Advertising MEANNESS EXAGGERATED
## 
### 
That the "so-called" Scotch jokes
are made up by the Scotch themselves ;
merely as a means of advertising
Scotland, is the assertion that was
made by Richard A. C. Oliver, a
graduate student from the University
of Edinburgh, Scotland, who is doing
work in Psychology here for two
years. At present lie is engaged in j
preliminary work for research in the j
field of tests and measurements. He ]
has a Commonwealth Fund Fellow
ship.
"Scotchmen may be thrifty because
they have to be, but their meanness
is an exaggeration," he says. "They
are not as rich as Americans, but
when they do have money they
spend it too. These are like the
stories of Americans' boastfulness
which are told abroad."
In comparing student life in Scot
land witli that of Stanford, he says j
that at Edinburgh there are many
more active student societies in the j
different departments. There they !
have rousing debates and discussions, '
organize dances, theatre parties, and j
picnics. J
The tuition at Edinburgh is about J
$100 a year for three terms in the j
Faculty of Arts, and living expenses j
are less there. Most of the women !
live in dormitories, while men prefer '
the quiet and independence of lodg-i
ings.
One of the things that ho admires
the most is the way students earn
their own expenses here. He thinks it
is amusing to be waited on by stu
dents of the same class as himself,
with the complete absence of self
consciousness and snobbishness. At
Edinburgh the poorer students are
supplied with scholarships 01* "bur
saries," and work only during vaca
tion. The universities have 110 classes
that correspond to our lower division. 1
This work is done in secondary
schools.
Students are well educated in Scot
land. Then most of them go abroad j
where they can earn a better living.
Theatres are more popular there, al- j
though the moving pictures all come 1
from the United States. Mary Pick-,
ford and Harold Lloyd are most popu
lar. Jazz is also imported.
