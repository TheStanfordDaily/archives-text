# "BACK TO NATURE" MOVE ENDORSED BY JOURNALISM CLASS
## 
### 
Visual evidence that the "back
to nature" movement is gaining
supporters on the Stanford farm
was demonstrated to all who
passed the "hay field" opposite
the Press building yesterday
morning between the hours of
11 and 12 o'clock.
There was learning in its sim
plest form. No stuffy classroom,
no hard seats, no determined
"prof" pounding vociferously on
his desk. Instead of these, blue
sky and sunshine, fresh-cut hay
to sit on, and a professor in evi
dence only by the low murmur
of his voice and the presence of
a hat swinging on the limb of a
tree above him.
It sounds like a students'
Utopia, but unfortunately it was
all an accident. Professor E. W.
Smith's class in American Jour
nalism was driven out of its
regular meeting place by a spe
cial R.O.T.C. class and forced to
adjourn to the hayfield for in
struction.
