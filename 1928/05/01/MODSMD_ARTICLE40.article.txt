# DEFINITE GOAL BRINGS FRENCH STUDENTS TO COLLEGE—IDA STAUF

"French college students attend
universities for a purpose rather than ;
for a cultural background," says Miss j
Ida Stauf, Stanford '10, of the Ro-1
manic Languages department. "There |
is no college life, as American stu
dents understand the word, to dis
tract a student's attention from his
work."
Miss Stauf returned from an ex
tended trip around the world at the
beginning of winter quarter. While
in France she studied at the Univer
sity of Paris for her doctor's degree !
and since graduating from Stanford j
she has studied in Europe several
times.
Students Are Industrious
"Since the war," Miss Stauf con- j
tinued, "more girls demand a college j
education, but there is still a class |
of people who do not believe in hav- :
ing their daughters attend universi
ties. As a result these people who are
acquiring a higher education really
want it and work for it. There is no
real interest taken in the students by
the professors. One either does his
work or —doesn't."
French children are being taught
English at an early age, she said. |
Formerly the French people did not
travel outside their own country
much, and few needed to learn any
other language. It is much easier for
the French student to learn English
than for the English or American stu
dent to learn French, Miss Stauf be
lieves.
