# SPORTS OF 1928
## OO-LA-LA! 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Who was the most graceful and one I
of the best second basemen in all
> baseball history? "Larry" Lajoie,!
who played with the Cleveland
Indians from 1902-1914, before that'
with the Phillies for Ave years, and
afterwards with the Athletics for five :
years, and afterwards with the Ath- j
letics for two years. Now, then, who j
i is the most promising young second I
baseman in the American League,
one, who, in only two seasons, has !
i already established himself as a star, j
and who has already been compared
with Lajoie In his brilliancy as an j
all-around player? Tony Lazzeri, 1
Yankee second baseman. Notice the
similarity in the last names? LA-joie
and LA-zzeri.
During Napoleon Lajoie's twenty
one years in big league baseball, he
made the amazing record of hitting
.300 or better against twenty-one dif
ferent major league clubs. He led
Ban Johnson's new organization in

! batting in 1901 with an average of .405
and repeated in 1903, and 1905. On
j May 10, 1897 he socked Red Dono
; hue for a single, a double, and two
j homers in live tries. He once hit
| three triples in one game, and another
time scored three men on a single,
j No wonder that Walter Johnson call
j ed him "the best batter I ever faced."
Lajoie formerly held the record for
| two base hits, knocking out 651 of
J them in his career in the majors.
; Let's see what Tony Lazzeri has done
jin his line. He hit 28 doubles in 1926,
I and 29 last year. Compare this with
' Lajoie's 11 in 1596 and 36 in 1897, his
j first two seasons. Tony should go
better and better for many years to
come. Last year he improved his 1926
| record in runs, hits, and stolen bases,
and batted 34 points higher. Kept
out of the first few games of 1928 by
a lame back, he should more than
make up for lost time, and perhaps,
at some distant date, even out-Lajoie
Lajoie.
