# DANGER OF LONG-DISTANCE RUNNING EXPLAINED Professor of Physiology Claims Heart Is Likely to Suffer ATHLETES UNABLE TO TELL WHEN INJURY BEGINS

"The greatest danger from long-dis- j
tance racing is the inability of a
runner to discover at what point the
injury to himself begins," declared
Frank W. Weymouth, professor of
physiology at Stanford, when ques- I
tioned about the probable effects of
C. C. Pyle's Bunion Derby on the
participants. In this event, the run
ners started from Los Angeles to
reach New York. Their speed is ap
proximately seven miles an hour.
Heart Likely to Suffer
"The heart is the most likely organ !
to suffer," he continued. "The severe
strain might have an unfavorable ef
fect; many athletes have been known
to have shortened their lives. There
is no good to be derived from such
an effort."
Weymouth compared this race to
six-day bicycle races in regard to

| physical results. "Some people have
I kept up long-time bicycle races as a
profession for a good many years,"
he said. "The results to the individual
depend entirely on his previous train
ing and condition, and on his mod-
I eration and sanity. In races of long
duration, the participants must soon
drop to a pace they can stand. It is
entirely a question of selection."
Inca Runners Famed
He remarked that the Incas of Peru
formerly ran long distances to carry
messages, and also to insure fresh
! fish to the diet of their emperor.
These runners traveled at a good
speed, and did not seem to suffer.
However, the distances were covered
in relays. The Indians chewed coca
leaves as a stimulant.
Lafayette College is considering es
tablishing a deferred rushing system.
