# ELSIE JANIS DECLARES SHE IS THROUGH WITH MUSICAL COMEDY LIFE
## 
### Ben Maddox, Jr 
"No more musical comedies for
I me!" Elsie Janis told me emphati
| cally last Sunday just before going
|on for her afternoon show at the
Orpheum in San Francisco. This in
ternationally famous stage star seems
more like a big business executive
than an actress, for she speaks di
rectly to the point and has something
definite to say.
"You work hard for a big hit. Then
when you get it you're bored to death
playing it. I hope I never do another
musical comedy. I'm going back to
the concert stage next September.
Concert programs let me cover a
great deal more territory—l'll do over
sixty cities next season.
"I close my vaudeville tour in Los
Angeles when I leave here. Do I live
there? Certainly not. My home is in
New York, but I spent last summer
in Beverly Hills and liked it im
mensely.
Worked in Movies
"The movies? Oh, yes, I used to be
in pictures—'way back before any of
j the 'live ones' were well known. But
I wasn't good. I might have developed
a movie personality, but it's tedious
work and I was too lively and moved
around too fast for the camera.
"Writing? Of course I'm serious
about it. The first story I ever wrote,
'Listen, Baby!' appears in the cur
rent 'Red Book.' They took three
other short stories at the same time.
All of a sudden I discovered I could
write, so I expect to do a lot of
stories from now on—no, not neces
sarily for the same magazine."
Plays at Orpheum
Miss Janis, who is headlining the
Orpheum bill this and next week, as
sumes glamour and personality the
moment she steps on the stage. Her
reputation as one of the outstanding
entertainers in the theatre world is
well bestowed, and if you want a per
fect introduction to the leading cele
brities of the theatre just go and see
I Miss Janis impersonate them. On
j this tour she presents characteriza
! tions of Lenore Ulric, Beatrice Lillie,
Fannie Brice, one of the Two Black
j Crows, Sarah Bernhardt, and Will
j Rogers. All the eccentricities and
I charm of each are wonderfully por
trayed, and in the Rogers number,
with which she closes her act, she
slings a rope and the bull as realisti
cally as Will himself.
Miss Janis is particularly admired
for her patriotism during the World
War, when she gave all her time and
talent to entertaining the soldiers
both here and in France.
Last August she opened the new
and elaborate Mayan Theatre in Los
! Angeles, starring in the musical com
! edy "Oh, Kay!" She was to have ap
peared in this play in San Francisco,
' but front-page complications arose
j and now she's through with musical
! revues, she hopes.

I must tell you one question she
asked me—read on if you're feeling
complacent—"Stanford is at Berkeley,
isn't it? No? U.C. is there? But aren't
they—Stanford and the state univer
sity—one and the same?"
Such is collegiate fame!
