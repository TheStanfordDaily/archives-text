# PHI KAPPA PSI, EL TIGRE WIN MURAL GAMES
## Betas, Delta Tau, Downed to Lose League Leadership To Opponents Clubmen Trounce Champions Of Last Year 10 to 4; Many Strike-Outs 
### 
Phi Kappa Psi and El Tigre ad
vanced to the top of their respective
leagues in yesterday's intramural
baseball play by defeating Delta Tau
Delta and Beta Theta Pi. Scores in
both games were comparatively low,
the Phi Psi's winning 12 to 3 and
El Tigre 10 to 4. Encina basement
won from Alpha Sigma Phi on default
and Sequoia 2 and Encina 3W lost
by a double default.
Good fielding on the part of the
Phi Kappa Psi men proved too much
of an obstacle for the Delta Tau Delta
batters, only two safe hits being re
corded. Price, Phi Kappa Psi pitcher,
fanned seven; while Martin, Delta
Tau Delta hurler, was only credited
with one strike-out and allowed 12
bits.
A last-inning rally by the Beta
Theta Pi players threatened to steal
victory from the hands of their op
ponents, the El Tigre nine, but by
desperate fielding the Hall men were
finally able to stop this after three
men had crossed the home plate. The
outstanding feature of the game was
the large number of strike-outs, Hun
ter of El Tigre accounting for eight
and Murphy of the fraternity team
for seven.
Following are the scores by in
nings :
Phi Kappa Psi 1 5 13 11
Delta Tau Delta 0 0 2 0 0 1
El Tigre 0 2 0 2 0
Beta Theta Pi 1 0 0 0 3
