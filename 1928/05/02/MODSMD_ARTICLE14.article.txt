# DECORATIVE DETAILS OF PROM COMPLETE; SCHEME IS ORIGINAL
## 
### 
Details of the Junior Prom decora
tions are now almost completed, and
the actual work of decorating the
Pavilion will begin in the next few
days. The J. L. Stuart Company of
San Francisco, decorators, said that
the French Colonial idea was new,
and had never been carried out either
here or in the city.
According to Powell Carpenter,
chairman of the decorations commit
tee, the large French pink drapes for
the side walls are being made in San
Francisco, and will be brought down
here already folded and pleated, to
be bung in place.
Three crystal chandeliers will light
the dance iloor. The main one, ten
feet across, has often been used in
San Francisco for Grand Opera deco
rations. The two smaller ones, famil
iar to old San Franciscans, hung for
years in the Palace Hotel.
A flood of colored light, said Car
penter, will play over the outside of
the pavilion. Rose spotlights at the
ends and pink and green lights
through the shrubbery before the
building will make a decorative ef
fect worthy of Louis the XIV himself.
