# FIRE MARSHAL SAYS HAY CONFLAGRATION ONLY BOYISH PRANK
## 
### 
"Only a boyish prank." That's
the way Fire Marshal Dugan
sums up the situation of the fire
alarm which was turned in last
night just before midnight.
The local fire department, in
response to the call, sent a
chemical truck to the location of
the fire which was reported to
be "just behind the Art Gallery."
It was not a false alarm, for
there was a fire blazing away
on the spot indicated; it was a
haystack that had been ignited.
A few minutes after this call
was answered, another haystack
"caught fire" behind Encina
Hall. No official evidence was
obtained concerning the arson
ists.
