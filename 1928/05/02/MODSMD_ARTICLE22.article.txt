# COMMITTEE MEMBERS CANVASS SENIORS FOR ENDOWMENT PLEDGES
## Will Solicit Donations From Unpaid Seniors Today; Call Is Chairman 
### 
Beginning today, members of the
Endowment Committee will carry on
a personal canvass of seniors, for the
purpose of securing pledges to the
Class of 1928 Endowment Fund. Calls
will be made on all seniors who
either returned pledges unsignd in
dicating that no money would be
pledged, or failed to return cards to
Harry Call, chairman of the com
mittee.
Already more than $700 has been
pledged, an amount, nearly equalling
that pledged by the Class of 1927,
which left the University a yearly in
come of $7SO. This was the first gift
of its kind to be made by a University
graduating class. Pledges received
from the Class of '28 to date have
averaged more than five dollars each,
says Call.
Annual Pledge Asked
The plan of endowment calls for
an annual pledge of money to the
University Alumni Fund, the money
in which is to be used by the Uni
versity for any purpose which will
advance or be of aid to the educa
tional facilities at Stanford. Pledging
to this endowment means that each
senior promises to pay a certain
amount to the fund annually to be
paid on receipt of notice from the
University. The promise, explains
Call, is only moral, and not in any
way legally binding. If at any time
it is inconvenient to pay the amount
pledged, payment may be deferred by
writing the University to that effect.
"Considering the fact that each
student pays but one-third of the ex
pense entailed in his education, and
that the University must stand the
remaining expense, the Class of 1928
feels that to have an annual income
to the University, to be used as it
sees fit in improving educational
facilities, is the most practical and
the most fitting thanks that the Class
of 1928 can give for the schooling
received during its four years of un
dergraduate work," said Call, in com
menting on the plan. The personal
canvass will continue until Wednes
day, May 9.
