# LINDBERGH, LANPHIER PLAN AIR TRIP OVER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May I.—(U.P.)—
Details of a proposed airplane flight
over Europe were worked out here
today by Col. Charles A. Lindbergh
and Major Thomas C. Lanphier, com
mandant of the first pursuit group,
U.S. Air Service.
Lindbergh and Lanphier spent most
of the day going over maps and
checking routes, mileage, and stops.
They were closeted at the home of
Lindbergh's cousin, Captain Emory
Land, assistant chief of the Naval
Bureau of Aeronautics.
Although neither of the two flyers
would discuss details of the proposed
flight, which would carry them to
many of the civilized countries of the
world, both admitted that they were
working on plans and maps.
