—The lead of Governor A1 Smith of
New York in the Democratic presidential
race increased tonight with receipt of
additional returns from the California
primary election.
At 8 p.m. returns from 320 precincts
out of 8755 in the state gave the follow
ing: Smith 5422, Reed 3129, Walsh 1651.
The same precincts gave Herbert Hoo
ver 22,991 in the uncontested Republican
presidential balloting.
Many of the precincts reported at 8
p.m. were from Los Angeles County and
Southern California.
Smith's strength in that section in the
early count was a surprise to his cam
paign managers here. They had counted
on Walsh polling a heavy vote in that
district.
Instead, the Montana senator was run
ning a poor third to Senator Reed of
Missouri on the basis of early returns.
Voting precincts in San Francisco
County were just closing at 8 p.m.
LOS ANGELES, May I.—(U.P.)—
Two precincts in Southern California
early tonight showed a slight lead for
Governor A1 Smith in the Democratic

gave: Smith 21, Walsh 18, Reed 2. The
same precinct gave Herbert Hoover, Re
publican, 74.
One precinct in Orange County gave
Smith 8, Walsh 5, Reed 5.
Southern California was the section in
which Walsh was counted on to make his
best showing because of the support of
William G. McAdoo.
