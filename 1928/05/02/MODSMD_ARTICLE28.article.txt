The State Bar of California has started a policy of constructive legis- \
lation in addition to its police function of regulating its members. This will,
"he enthusiastically welcomed by everyone interested in seeing that the;
legal profession maintains standards worthy of men whose chosen occu-:
pation it is to straighten out entanglements of the law.
When the State Bar commences its work in earnest it may be able to :
do away with some of the myriad of criticisms that have been heaped upon j
the heads of lawyers. When so prominent a lawyer as Samuel Unter- j
meyer makes the remark that the medical and other learned professions are j
advancing, while his own is degenerating, it is time for the barristers to :
take stock.
Mr. Untermeyer recently charged that lawyers are not resourceful or
progressive, that they are prolific talkers and poor perfomers, that they
have reduced their profession to a money-making trade, that they give too
little public service, that they bring too many cases into court and cause
needless delays when they do get into court. Much of the disrespect for i
law, he attributes to lawyers themselves. The reasons for this, Mr. Unter-,
meyer claims, are that his profession is "bound by tradition and prece- i
dent and so paralyzed by fear that it dare not follow an intelligent course!
toward progressive reform." The gentleman from New York even goes to ;
the extent of saying that law is a lost art. If true, this is all very inter-;
esting, not to say regrettable.
In making quite such derogatory statements, however, Mr. Untermeyer j
fails to remember that at one time blood-letting was the panacea for all
ills, and that real property could not be devised by will. Just as this has
been changed by the medical profession, so has the law changed, due in j
large part to the lawyers. Legal customs have changed greatly since the
time when William the Conqueror made his little raid and took over all
English land, then introduced the feudal system, from which most of the!
difficulties have arisen. Equity has come in and the purely formal has
largely given way to more common sense methods.
Yet it is true many lawyers use rules of law as much for evasion as
for protection. By technicalities they are able to do things with a law
that was never intendechgo operate in such a way. Recognizing it is better
that a few must suffer erroneously in order that the greater number may
receive justice, legislatures enact rules that inevitably work hardship in!
some cases. This would be all right if lawyers didn't take advantage of
such chances and slip in crooked practices that increase that number of
cases.
The whole situation is up to the members of the legal profession them
selves, and more particularly up to those men who are desirous of seeing
justice accomplished. This recently announced policy of the State Bar gives i
some promise of a betterment of conditions. The Bar can control its mem-1
bers, and can help greatly to initiate progressive legislation. If it does these
two duties as it should, the law may not be a "lost art."

dent and so paralyzed by fear that it dare not follow an intelligent course!
toward progressive reform." The gentleman from New York even goes to ;
the extent of saying that law is a lost art. If true, this is all very inter-;
esting, not to say regrettable.
In making quite such derogatory statements, however, Mr. Untermeyer j
fails to remember that at one time blood-letting was the panacea for all
ills, and that real property could not be devised by will. Just as this has
been changed by the medical profession, so has the law changed, due in j
large part to the lawyers. Legal customs have changed greatly since the
time when William the Conqueror made his little raid and took over all
English land, then introduced the feudal system, from which most of the!
difficulties have arisen. Equity has come in and the purely formal has
largely given way to more common sense methods.
Yet it is true many lawyers use rules of law as much for evasion as
for protection. By technicalities they are able to do things with a law
that was never intendechgo operate in such a way. Recognizing it is better
that a few must suffer erroneously in order that the greater number may
receive justice, legislatures enact rules that inevitably work hardship in!
some cases. This would be all right if lawyers didn't take advantage of
such chances and slip in crooked practices that increase that number of
cases.
The whole situation is up to the members of the legal profession them
selves, and more particularly up to those men who are desirous of seeing
justice accomplished. This recently announced policy of the State Bar gives i
some promise of a betterment of conditions. The Bar can control its mem-1
bers, and can help greatly to initiate progressive legislation. If it does these
two duties as it should, the law may not be a "lost art."
The State Bar of California has started a policy of constructive legis- \
lation in addition to its police function of regulating its members. This will,
"he enthusiastically welcomed by everyone interested in seeing that the;
legal profession maintains standards worthy of men whose chosen occu-:
pation it is to straighten out entanglements of the law.
When the State Bar commences its work in earnest it may be able to :
do away with some of the myriad of criticisms that have been heaped upon j
the heads of lawyers. When so prominent a lawyer as Samuel Unter- j
meyer makes the remark that the medical and other learned professions are j
advancing, while his own is degenerating, it is time for the barristers to :
take stock.
Mr. Untermeyer recently charged that lawyers are not resourceful or
progressive, that they are prolific talkers and poor perfomers, that they
have reduced their profession to a money-making trade, that they give too
little public service, that they bring too many cases into court and cause
needless delays when they do get into court. Much of the disrespect for i
law, he attributes to lawyers themselves. The reasons for this, Mr. Unter-,
meyer claims, are that his profession is "bound by tradition and prece- i
dent and so paralyzed by fear that it dare not follow an intelligent course!
