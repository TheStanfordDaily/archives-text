"There's one born every minute," said P. T. Barnum, referring to those
Americans who will purchase or attempt anything possible to achieve fame
or fortune. Were the old circus-master living today he would be com
pelled to bring his statement to time by either increasing the birthrate or
reducing the time denomination in his famous quotation. Furthermore,
he would no doubt join Mencken and insist that his theory be accepted as
fact. lie wouldn't have to go far for examples to support his contention.
Tramping through Illinois today are a pack of transcontinental hoofers
who have completed 2200 miles of their 3400-mile journey by foot from
Los Angeles to New York City, where they will be welcomed as heroes and
where cash awards, newspaper publicity, and movie contracts await them,
providing they survive the grueling marathon to enjoy the fruits of their
irrationality. The "Bunion Derby" is being managed by C. C. Pyle, the
Billy Sunday of the sport world, who will derive the greatest profits of the
venture from advertising endorsements of everything from asphalt high
ways to sawdust breakfast foods. Mr. Pyle's contribution to the world's
longest marathon is brains and capital. He is traversing the weary way in
an automobile with nis bookkeeper.

Last week in Southern California a dancing marathon was stopped by '
the health department after the affair had continued for a week with all i
but three couples eliminated. The "dance" started at Culver City, the*
competitors trotting over the highway behind band wagons to a beach
dance hall several miles distant where they continued day and night for
nearly 150 hours.
The same kind of contest was staged in Los Angeles last year wilh the ,
same results. The city and dance hall received free advertising; the en
trants in the contest wore out their shoes and their stamina; some suffered j
permanent injuries, and four people received $125 each for their terpsicho
rean efforts.
In addition to dancing marathons, melodramatic evangelism, hot-dog
stands, and nightmare architecture, this same city of Los Angeles is known j
as "a community that opposes boxing because of its brutality."
