MOVING THE DANCE OUT OF
THE CHAPTER HOUSE
The other day we were moved to
observe that campus social activities,
along with the funny-looking automo
biles, had dwindled and faded with
the passing years. Where in former
times the social life of the campus
was vigorous and sufficient, it is not
so much so now, and the social whirl
whirls here no longer but in San
Francisco. A rough tabulation of the
dates granted by the Ex Committee,
as listed by this paper from 1923 to
the present time, clearly substanti
ate this viewpoint. The January 1 to
May 1 periods of these years were
checked, and the dance dates granted
therein were divided as follows:
Roble, men's halls, all-University,
sororities, and fraternities.
For the moment we will consider
the change within the six-year period
as reflected in the sorority and fra
ternity totals. The change in the
other living groups will be noted
later.
Decrease Easily Seen
From January to May 1923 dates
were granted for twenty-one sorority
and twenty-two fraternity dances.
The following year during the same
time the number of dates granted fell
to ten and twenty respectively. In
1925 the women's houses asked for
twelve dances and the men's for fif
teen during the five months. The drop
continued in 1926, when the sorority
total came to eleven and the frater
nity to twelve for the period. In 1927
from the first of January to the first
of May seven sororities and ten fra
ternities were recorded as asking for
dates. From last January to the pres

j ent time the total is ten sorority and
! four fraternity dates granted by the
Ex Committee.

Dampening Effect
It is something ©f a far call from
the twenty or so hops per group of
, the days of 1923 to the ten and four
per group for the same period of time
this year. The small total for 102S
is partly the result of specific circum
stance added to the prevailing state
of indifference, mainly, the quaran
tine and the dampening shadow cast
by the action following the Sigma Chi
dance last fall. For the time being,
at least, the men seem to be scared
1 out, and not without good reason.
Even if the wayward brothers can be
made to walk in the straight and nar
l row for the duration of the evening,
j there is no certainty that various
1 guests, both invited and uninvited,
will be equally as thoughtful.
Drinking is not the reason for the
near-absence of fraternity dances,
j The cost of a good party given at the
chapter house is apt to run very high
j per man, even up toward $20 if the
i affair is formal. Now such a sum, if
conservatively invested, can be made
to see one through two or three
I nights in the metropolis to the north.
Going Elsewhere
The number of sorority dances,
while considerably less in number,
have not fallen off to the same extent
ias have the fraternity, probably for
the simple reason that it is about the
! only practical way for a women's
group to entertain.
Whatever the reasons, the figures
indicate plainly enough a greatly
changed condition. Stanford is going
off the campus for its social life.
