"The Mikado." Players Guild.
Revivals come and revivals go, and
generally there is no regret at their
passing. This one, however, is an ex
ception. "The Mikado," now being
presented in San Francisco, under the
direction of Reginald Travers, is very
good indeed. All the Gilbert and Sulli
van flavor is there, but a freshness
that does not usually accompany the
preserves of former years is also
served up.
The part-professional, and part
amateur organization of the theatre
gives an amusing enthusiasm in the
cast, and it may almost be taken for
granted now that the chorus or mob
of any performance here will be es
fhetic as well as musical. We did
hear, when we saw it, that Nanki-
Poo was a "foul ball," but aside from
this gentleman's discrepancies,
there's scarcely anything the most
scrupulous could find to criticize.
Travers Is Good
The chorus is like one of those
beautiful advertisements for Victor
records, psychically animated. Trav
ers, as the Lord High Executioner, is
a riot, and his pathetic rendering of
that magnificent ballad, "Tit-Willow,"

| tragic and heart-rending. Katisha, the j
! Mikado-Daugliter-in-Law-Elect, is as
! stupendous as a parrot with delirium
| tremens. The Lord High Everything
Else, Pooh-Bah, is immense,
i There's nothing better than a Gil
i bert and Sullivan comic opera, except j
a Gilbert and Sullivan opera well j
done. "The Mikado" decidedly falls |
in this class, and is further helped |
out by the fact that Travers' interpre- j
tation is sympathetic. This is one of i
j the most popular of the famous duet's 1
i light operas, and always a favorite. ;
"To Make the Punishment Fit the i
Crime," "Three Little Girls From !
School," "The Flowers That Bloom
in the Spring," "Tit-Willow," are some
| of the songs.
Hearing "The Mikado" is like read- i
ing the Bible or Shakespeare, in the |
similarity with your constant surprise j
at recognizing familiar quotations. I
We don't know what we thought j
"protoplasmic ancestors" was a quo
i tation from, but it seems it is from i
| (his tradition-honored institution. In ;
, short, for educational reasons, as ;
well as for your own amusement, ]
"The Mikado" is well worth seeing, I
i
and regrettable to miss.

"The Mikado." Players Guild.
Revivals come and revivals go, and
generally there is no regret at their
passing. This one, however, is an ex
ception. "The Mikado," now being
presented in San Francisco, under the
direction of Reginald Travers, is very
good indeed. All the Gilbert and Sulli
van flavor is there, but a freshness
that does not usually accompany the
preserves of former years is also
served up.
The part-professional, and part
amateur organization of the theatre
gives an amusing enthusiasm in the
cast, and it may almost be taken for
granted now that the chorus or mob
of any performance here will be es
fhetic as well as musical. We did
hear, when we saw it, that Nanki-
Poo was a "foul ball," but aside from
this gentleman's discrepancies,
there's scarcely anything the most
scrupulous could find to criticize.
Travers Is Good
The chorus is like one of those
beautiful advertisements for Victor
records, psychically animated. Trav
ers, as the Lord High Executioner, is
a riot, and his pathetic rendering of
that magnificent ballad, "Tit-Willow,"

| tragic and heart-rending. Katisha, the j
! Mikado-Daugliter-in-Law-Elect, is as
! stupendous as a parrot with delirium
| tremens. The Lord High Everything
Else, Pooh-Bah, is immense,

i bert and Sullivan comic opera, except j
a Gilbert and Sullivan opera well j
done. "The Mikado" decidedly falls |
