DATING
Two Stanford men now look for dates,
They write an appealing "ad."
There is a shortage of women —
The situation's bad.
They should have asked some co-eds
A full five months before,
One's a Junior and one's a Senior —
But they're not wise to campus lore.

We notice that the advertisement
says, "Can furnish references"—we
think that it ought to read, "Must
furnish references."

Believe It or Not, Spring Is Here?
Along with Spring's fiowers, colds,
new-mown hay, green grass, and
lambs gamboling 011 aforementioned
green grass—there is Love! Spring
Love drives some goofy while others
write "poetry." (Peruse the pome be
low to see what I mean):
You, Yourself, Said So
'Twas like a dream, that night we
met;
You. yourself, said so
With "yes" instead of "no"
In answer to my wish, and yet
How could you say I would forget?
My words were like a summer breeze;
You, yourself, said so,
And as the flowers blow,
You yielded with a loving squeeze,
For all 1 had to say was, "please."
'T was liko a dream, that night we
met;
You, yourself, said so,
But you will never know
That sometimes one cannot forget,
Especially when he's dreaming vet.
