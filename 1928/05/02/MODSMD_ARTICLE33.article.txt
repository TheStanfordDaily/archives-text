It really seems that college stu
dents enjoy quite innocent pastimes.
That is, they actually don't spend all
their time doing the perfectly start
ling things that one reads about in
magazines and thing like that.
What I mean to say is, that lots of
Stanford students are interested in
circuses. That is, quite a few went to
see Mr. Barnes' show and really
seemed to like all the horses and ele
phants and pink lemonade and pop
corn and clowns and things. I mean,
they seemed to be having lots of
"good, clean fun."
I wonder why some people seem to
be ashamed to admit that they ever
have a good time. That is, I heard a i
girl say that she just hated circuses,
but 1 saw her at the one Mr. Barnes
manages and she laughed and laughed
at the clowns and drank three bottles
of soda pop.
Things like that are hard for a girl
to understand; so I asked an awfully
brilliant psychology major, and he I
told me all about .lots of perfectly
fascinating things â€” psychological
complexes and things like that, you i
know. I thought it was very interest
ing, although I wasn't exactly sure
I was understanding everything just
right. But anyhow, 1 think psychology
must be just too thrilling, and I never j
dreamed that it might have something J
to do with circuses, if you get what
I mean.
