The Editor, Sir:
Several days ago a statement ap
peared in the Daily explaining the
Honor System as interpreted by the
Men's Council. Among other things,
Mr. Vincenti said that for a student
to include in the bibliography of a
term paper any article which he had
not read was a breach of the Honor
System, and would of course mean
his expulsion from the University.
Either the Men's Council have in
terpreted the Honor System falsely,
or else some of our professors do not
conduct their work in accord with it.
The professor who gave History' 177
during the fall quarter asked for a
term paper and a bibliography. The
bibliography had to be exhaustive,
but the students were not asked to
read even half the articles included.
To have read all the articles in most
of those bibliographies would have
taken years, for as a rule many of
the items were written in one of three
or four languages.
I believe that quite frequently the
professor who assigns a paper and
bibliography wishes to see if the stu
dent has the ability to locate a great
amount of reference material on the
subject. Very often he has no inten
tion of requiring that every article
be read. If the reading has been
superficial it is sure to show up in
the body of the paper.
Another point applies especially to
advanced students who, when as
signed a subject for a paper, make
it a point to collect an extensive
bibliography so that they may be
able to use it at some later time in
continuing their reading along the
same line.
Had Mr. Vincenti taken History 177
and abided by his own interpretation
of the Honor System he would have
flunked the course. Had he followed
Professor Hulme's instructions he
would, of course, have withdrawn
from the University of his own ac
cord for breach on the Honor Code.
These remarks are submitted with
out malice toward Mr. Vincenti or the
Men's Council, or the Honor System
itself but only with the hope of find
ing a way out of a dilemna which is
sure to present itself to many another
student. â€”'26.
