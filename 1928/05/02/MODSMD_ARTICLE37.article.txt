# SPORTS OF 1928
## More Speed 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Scarcely had this cartooner finished
and dispatched a drawing labeled
"Speed," in which Captain Malcolm
Campbell of England was shown get
ting his world's record for automo
biles of 20G.95 miles an hour, when
up from Florida came the news that
Ray Keecli had driven J. M. White's
thirty-six-cylinder Triplex at a rate
of 207.6 miles an hour, thus bring
ing the speed record back to America.
The two extra wheels on Mr. White's
Triplex were especially designed for
racing on the beach course at Day
tona. If the regular driving wheels
sink into the sand, the extra set still
grips the track and keeps the car
moving.
Keech set his new record on Sun
day, April 22. On the two previous
days interesting examples of speed in
sports were brought to this writer's
attention. On Friday, the twentieth,
the Yankees staged a home-coming
party at the Stadium, otherwise
known as "the House that Ruth
built." In weather that was better
suited for football than baseball,
your correspondent watched Mr. Lefty
Grove, of Connie Mack's Ancient An
tiques, throw a ball by Miller Hug
gins' Yankees with such blinding
speed that most of the proud cham
pions of the world struck out or
popped up weakly to the infieldcrs.

I Later 011 in the game, Old Man Cobb
; and Old Man Speaker combined to
push over the winning run for Phila
delphia, thus entirely spoiling New
York's opening festivities.
Then on Saturday, the twenty-first,
at Columbus, Ohio, George Simpson,
of Ohio State University, ran 100
yards on a muddy track in the won
derful time of 9.G seconds, equalling
1 the national collegiate and official
I world's record.
