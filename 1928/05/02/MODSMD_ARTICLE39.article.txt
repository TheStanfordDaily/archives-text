# OLD CAMPUS WINERY STANDS DESERTED IN STRAWBERRY FIELDS
## 
### 
Way back in 18S9 a building was
erected about a half mile west of the
Mausoleum which, up to the time of
the earthquake, was used as a winery.
In January 1909, the Board of Trus
tees, to remedy the lack of accom
modations, granted the structure to
the students for use as a new dormi
tory. For some reason the plans fell
through and the building is still
there, just as it was in the 'SO's. Over
the front door is the sign, "Palo Alto
Stockfarm â€”Dairy Barn," but asidfe
from housing a Ford truck and a few
rakes and hoes, the edifice is in dis
use.
It is a large brick building, two
stories in height and with two wings
extending to the rear, making the
building U-shaped. The outside of the
structure is impressive, and holds
itself together proudly, but the inside
is a chaos of broken glass, shattered
boards, farm implements, cobwebs,
dust, dirt, land old presses.
"Winery Hall" is surrounded with
fields covered with strawberries
heavy with luscious fruit. A few
casks, very dry unfortunately, are
fumbled about in the silent corners
of the "Hall."

Minnesota.
