# POLICE AID SOUGHT IN CASE OF MISSING CHEMISTRY STUDENT
## 
### 
Police aid has been called into the
search for Houston Letcher, graduate
student in chemistry at Stanford
University, who dropped out of sight
at noon on April 5, when he left home,
presumably for San Francisco on an
errand connected with his studies.
Letcher has been a research fellow
in chemistry at Stanford for two
years, living with his widowed moth
er, Mrs. Sara Letcher, in Palo Alto,
and neither she nor his professors
and fellow students who knew him
best have any explanation to offer
for his disappearance. Their supposi
tion is that he is suffering from some
form of amnesia.
