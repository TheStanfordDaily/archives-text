# STANFORD I.C.-4A. MEN TO BE CHOSEN AFTER OLYMPIC TRIALS HERE
## Outfit Likely to Make Trip Includes Bud Spencer, Nichols, West 
### Bob Speers 
Those who are to compose Stan
ford's track and field crew for
1.C.-4A. competition will not be cho
sen until after the Olympic tryouts
which will be held here on May 12,
according to Coach Dink Templeton.
It isn't difficult, however, to pick
out an outfit which is likely to make
the journey. Captain Bud Spencer will
go, of course. Bud didn't fare so well
in the East last season, but that ex
perience taught a lesson which was
valuable. Spencer has been careful to
guard against overtraining, and
should be in the best possible shape
by May 25.
Then there is Clarence West and
Ross Nichols, Stanford's famous hurd
ling duo, who should make the trip.
Bill Sparling will probably do things
in the javelin, as Avill Eric Krenz, A1
Forster, and Harlow Rothert in the
shot.
Ward Edmonds stands a good
chance to at least equal the world's
record in the pole vault when he
meets Sabin Carr and Lee Barnes in
that event at Cambridge. And Bob
King is a cinch to be on hand for
high jump competition.
Henry Coe, Stanford's lanky two
miler, will be there, while Fred
Zombro and Kim Dyer should give
Easterners a real broad-jumping ex
hibition.
There are others, too, who have a
chance to make the transcontinental
trek. It remains for the sagacious
Dink to figure out just who can make
the grade. It is possible for many
things to happen in the next three
weeks which will alter the entire as
pect of the situation. Too many
muscles have been pulled and too
many men have suddenly developed
into strong contenders in this track
game for Templeton to make any
hard and fast selection just yet.
