### 
Although Alden Oliver, '31, has lost
the use of his good right arm for the
next few weeks, he is triumphing over
his hard-fought battle with a Chevrolet.
Yesterday afternoon in front of Encina
Oliver endeavored to start his "Chevie,"

but the starter would not work.
Resorting to the crank, he seized the
handle with vigor. The motor kicked
against such treatment and Oliver found
himself with a broken arm. Nevertheless
he is glorying in the fact that even if his
arm was broken in the process, he suc
ceeded in starting the motor. "Spud"
Hardy, catcher of the frosh baseball
team, took Oliver to the hospital.
