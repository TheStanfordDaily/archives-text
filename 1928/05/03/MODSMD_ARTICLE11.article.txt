# CARDINAL POLO FOUR NAMED FOR PRESIDIO CONTEST TOMORROW
## Weymouth, McDougall, Post, Thompson Included in Varsity Line-Up 
### 
The definite line-up for the polo
game between Stanford's varsity
team and the San Francisco Presidio
outfit has been determined by Coach
Lieutenant Whitmore, placing Wey
mouth at one, Post at two, McDou
gall at three, and Thompson at four,
with Connolly substitute. The game
is to be played Friday at 2:30 o'clock
on the Presidio field.
Larry Weymouth and Tex Thomp
son are both players with three years'
varsity experience. Thompson is a
versatile player, with probably the
best riding and hitting ability on the
team. Jack McDougall, playing num
ber three, is a very strong player, and
was formerly rated as a three-goal
man by the National Polo Associa
tion.
Considering the Presidio team's ex
cellent string of horses, Bud Post
will be the only varsity man equally
mounted with the army squad. Post
has nine of his own horses which are
kept at Stanford. They were brought
here from Arizona and New Mexico
two years ago, and six of them will
be played in the game Friday. These
mounts considerably strengthen the
team.
Twelve army horses are going to
be taken up today to the Presidio for
the game, and all the animals are in
better condition than they have been
all year.

The Cardinal poloists feel that
there is a chance of bringing home
the laurels. They played practically
this same team last fall, winning one
game and dropping the other.
