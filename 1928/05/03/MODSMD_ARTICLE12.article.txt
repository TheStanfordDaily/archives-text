HALIFAX, N.S., May 2.—( U.P.) —
The hull of the Dutch steamship "Cal
listo," which is believed to have sunk off
Scatterie Sunday with all of her crew
of 28, has been located with nothing but
her derricks showing above water.
On Saturday night the ship sent out a
wireless SOS saying she was aground,
but patrols Sunday morning were un
able to locate the ship even after the fog
cleared.
Various pieces of wreckage, including
a life boat and a door, were found by
the patrols along the coast, but the hull
itself was not found until today.
