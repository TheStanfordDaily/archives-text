# El Campo, El Cuadro Get Mural Horseshoe Defaults
## 
### 
El Campo and El Caudro won on
defaults in the day's competition of
the intramural horseshoe tourna
ment. Branner and Encina were
awarded losses for failing to show
up. Charles W. Davis, director of
intramural sports, announced that all
postponed games must be played this
week or they will be counted as
double defaults.
