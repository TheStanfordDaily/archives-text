# PRACTICE DISCLOSES SEVERE DEFECTS IN DAILY STAFF TEAM
## 
### 
Things look very, very bright
for the Pride of the Pressroom,
the University Press stalwart
baseball outfit. For in practice
yesterday, the Daily players—
such as there were —looked woe
fully rank.
Easy infield flies were sure
death for thumbnails.
Gentle foul tips sent one
catcher after another to the
bench.
The outfielders contented
themselves with picking line
drives off of the fence.
The pitcher could not find his
own box, let alone the home
plate.
And only four days remain
before the first inning of the
wildly heralded Battle of the
Century. It looks bad, bad!
