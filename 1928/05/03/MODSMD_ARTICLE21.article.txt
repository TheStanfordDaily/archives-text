# TWENTY-FIVE MEXICAN TEACHERS WILL VISIT HERE SUNDAY, MONDAY
## 
### 
Twenty-five leaders of the teaching
profession in Mexico will be visitors
to the Stanford campus next Sunday
and Monday. This group of educators
from our southern neighbor are tour
ing this state, making an investiga
tion of California university and sec
ondary school systems.
The trip is the result of an invita
tion sent to the Mexican Secretary
of Education from the International
Council for Educational Progress.
Will C. Wood, State Superintendent
of Banks, President W. W. Campbell
of University of California, President
Wilbur, and Dr. C. N. Thomas, promi
nent internationalist, are leaders of
the organization.
Included in the group are college
and high school professors, and super
intendents of several Mexican state
school districts. There are four wo
men in the party. Among the most
prominent of men are: President
Eurado Prunedo, National University
of Mexico; Dr. Lauro Aguirre, Direc
tor of Federal Normal School; En
rique C. Corona, president National
Indian School; and Waldo Soberon,
director of National Agriculture
School.
"Mexico is more and more looking
to California as a model for its
school system," declares Dr. Thomas.
"Because of internal unrest, educa
tional advantages were for a long
period available to only a few. Now
that the government is in progressive
hands, the increase in the number of
schools, pupils, and teachers has been
tremendous.
Comptroller Roth, Director of Sum
mer Quarter Sellards, and Alumni
Secretary McDowell will have charge
of the group during its visit here.
They will have charge of the group
