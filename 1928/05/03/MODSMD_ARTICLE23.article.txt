### M. C 
"And do you feel you have found
your life work in tliia field?" the
sweet young journalist queried the
co-authors of the already famous
"South Seas Preferred," 1929 Junior
Opera.
"Well," drawled one of them with
a flavor of his Hammer and Coffin
background, "the grass is really too
high as yet for us to see our way out."
Noticing the lines of weariness in
the faces of the two budding celebri
ties, the fair reporter inquired solici
tously concerning how their health
was holding out under the nervous
strain of being both authors and pro
ducers. They admitted that the big
worry was the non-appearance as yet
of the $50 reward.
"And the fan letters?" "Oh, I refer
all those to my partner since his
dark curly hair best fits him to cope
with them," one replied. "Movie con
tracts we take care of in the same
way. I prefer to write subtitles on
his movies."
"Do either or both of you expect to
fall in love with the leading lady?"
Speaking modestly and diplomatically
they said they would leave this pre
carious task to the leading man.
The young authors said the brain
child was born more by the evolution
ary process than the spontaneous
generation idea. "We discovered it
one day in a flower pot, a very tender
seedling. Then we took it into a
secret place and nourished it tender
ly, where from a mere plot it grew
into a whole planation."
"What do you like best about it?"
she asked. "The fact that is all writ
ten!" they chorused vehemently. As
she left, being business men as well
as geniuses, they reminded her that
the seats go on sale today at 1 o'clock
at the Union for $1, $1.25, and $1.50.
