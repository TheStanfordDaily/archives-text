### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 2. —
(U.P.) —Washington took the German-
Irish crew of the Junkers plane "Bre
men" into its hearts today, cheered them,
shook hands with them, praised them,
decorated them, dined them at the White
House, introduced them to Congress, and
in many ways paid the nation's tribute
to three brave men.
When Baron Von Hoenefeld, Captain
Herman Koehl, and Major James C.
Fitzmaurice stepped to the rear of the
White House shortly after noon and re
ceived from President Coolidge the first
Distinguished Flying Crosses ever to be
awarded foreigners, America bestowed
upon them its highest honor.
Two of the men—the baron and Cap
tain Koehl—were former enemies of the
United States. Both had fought under
the German flag. Ten years ago today
while newspapers were screaming head
lines of attacks and counter-atacks on the
western front, they would have been
mobbed by the war-inflamed citizenry.
Today they also were mobbed but by
cheering, good-natured crowds.
