Tomorrow the freshmen who intend to join fraternities will journey
into the lawyer's office, and if they choose correctly, take a further jaunt
up the row to their respective houses to receive the little button and hearty
handshakes. When it is all over everyone will emit a tremendous sigh of
relief, for the whole business is trying to all concerned.
Every once in a while a freshman is found who believes that after he
has "made" a fraternity, or made what he considers a better fraternity
than certain of his acquaintances, he has good reason for riding the high
horse. Such an attitude merely brings forth a few tolerant smiles and
knowing nods. The new pledge may feel within himself a great surge of
elation, he may feel that now he has reached the zenith, that henceforth
his college life will be one round of happy days. This is all fine and as it
should be, but he must remember that the nouveau riche, one who displays
newly gotten riches in a gaudy and ill-chosen manner, receives nothing for
his efforts but a gentle "here's-your-hat-what's-your-hurry ?"
On the Stanford campus, unlike the situation in many colleges, there is
no wide distinction between a fraternity and a non-fraternity man. Some
choose the halls or Palo Alto, and some choose one house and some an
other. True, it may be said that many of those in the halls have not taken
that way from choice, but the opposite is also true. What ultimately
stands out is, not where a man lives, but what he does.
Thus, it behooves those men who may have the idea that since they
have gone the fraternity they wanted, they should not be quite so thick with
old Bill, who really is a pretty good guy after all, but not quite up to the
standards of Omicron Beta, to recall that a man is known not only by the
company he keeps but by the friends that he keeps.
