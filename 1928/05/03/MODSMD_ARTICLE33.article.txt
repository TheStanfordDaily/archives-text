# Hoover Hits a Homer
## 
### 
As everyone knew he would, Herbert Hoover took his home commun
ity by a big landslide in Tuesday's primary election. In Palo Alto, May
field district, and Stanford there were 3,287 votes cast, and the secretary
took 2,722, or 83 per cent of the total. This is a majority to which Hoover
may point with pride. His nearest opponent was A1 Smith, with 298.
Taking the primaries that have already been run off, the local com
munity seems to have hit the keynote of public opinion, with the exception
that the Hoover vote does not, of course, run to such large proportions in
other places. With a few exceptions, mostly "favorite son" states, these
two men seem to have the approval of their respective parties, as far as
the public is concerned.
What the conventions will turn out may be a different matter. When
the politicians get to milling around they don't worry much about popular
sentiment. Even Smith, strong party man though he is, may get a slap in
the face if the Democrats feel they are going to need stronger Wall Street
support. Hoover, knowingly, does not have this important factor behind
him, and Owen D. Young might be the man to swing things.
