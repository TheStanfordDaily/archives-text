Professor Lee Emerson Bassett of the English Department will speak
Saturday morning before the Speech Arts Association at a meeting in the
Western Women's Club Building, San Francisco, on "The Old Vic."
So might the staid Daily report an event to take place this week-end.
But not so some of the San Francisco newspapers, the editors of which
seem to be ever mindful of their partially moion public. The Bulletin, for
example, says on page 1:
. . The big racket will bust loose with a business confab at 10 a.m.
Later, A. F. Blanks, language prof over at Cal, will make a spiel on 'The
Object of Teaching Oral Expression.'
"Lee Emmerson [sic] Bassett, another language prof down at Stan
ford, and one of the high hats what started this speech arts gag, is slated
for a ten-round, no-decision go with 'The Old Vic,' which was a London
honky-tonk when John L. was a pork and beaner."
It is no credit to you, dear reader, if you can understand the above
quotation, and it certainly speaks ill for journalism that a newspaper
should ridicule an honest, intelligent movement such as the Speech Arts
seems to be.
