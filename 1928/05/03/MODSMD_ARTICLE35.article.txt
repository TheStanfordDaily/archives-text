# And There Was Light

The Daily prints with great satisfaction today the fact that at last the
women have been freed from their big black, bulbous bloomers and attend
ant evils of the gym. Now they will wear cute little knee-length knickers,
half-sox, a blouse, and shoes, all tan to match. And when the elements
decree, there is a sweat-shirt coat, almost like the men wear. Yes sir,
almost.
Some day they may even wear whole costumes just like the men, but
modesty must have its due. Backless dresses and bare arms are all right
for every-day wear, but no skin may show during games or exercise. It's
immodest. Oh, well, the new outfits show the sweet little dimpled knees,
anyhow. There's hope yet.
