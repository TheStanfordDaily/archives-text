IT'S THE OLD R.O.T.C. GAME
Out of the near distance comes the
rattle of the sabre and the rumble of;
the war god's thunder. It's the old •
R.O.T.C. question again.
The band plays and the Spring-j
fields, row on row, go marching by. 1
The band stops playing and the;
Springfields come down one after the
other and occasionally together, and
then, to the 2,000 cadets cooling their
heels on the parade grounds, speaks
W. W. Campbell, astronomer-militar
ist president of the mighty Univer
sity of California:
"Is there anyone here spoiling for
a fight to the death with the forces
of another nation?"
Not a hand is raised, naturally.
No Delicate Words
That is not all. Paragraph after
paragraph is needed to quote what
President Campbell had taken the
opportunity to say about certain poor
benighted souls on the California
campus who had dared oppose the
institution of R.O.T.C. Bands and
guns, and guns and troops, even if
they are only plodding cadets, inspire
no one to delicate words; for those
who objected President Campbell
could only hurl "pacifists."
If we may venture to say it, Presi
dent Campbell, we think you are
wrong. Furthermore, we wager the
fight against compulsory military drill
in our universities and colleges will
go steadily on, in spite of your "sting
ing rebuke" to those who see things
differently from what you do.
Theory and Practice
Like many other things, military
training is one thing in theory and an
other thing in actual practice. And
right here those who advocate com
pulsory drill for college students miss
their guess. To lift a stock argument
from President Campbell's speech of
last Monday:
"If it is desirable and necessary to
maintain any degree whatsoever of
preparedness to defend the State and
the National all able-bodied young
men, who are enjoying the special
bounty of the States as students in
the State University, should be on
call to this service."
This is the rallying cry which sends
endless hundreds of disgusted fresh
men and sophomores marching
around and around year after year.
But do they learn, under this compul
sory system, to become soldiers in a
practical sense of the word? Some
do, but the larger part only learn new
swear words and look forward to the
days when, as juniors, they will be
liberated.
Drilling, Not by Choice
My first year in university was
spent at the University of Washing
ton, where, even as at California,
flourishes R.O.T.C. at the expense of
the first- and second-year men. With
the opening of the Fall term we were
herded off to the Military department,
where a twelve dollar deposit pro
duced an old army uniform, which
fitted not at all, and a Springfield
rifle. The war was on.
For one perfectly good hour five
days a week we drilled. At least part
of the drill period came at 11 o'clock.
As no self-respecting dresser would
wear the "monkey suits," as they
were not too incorrectly called, any
longer than was necessary, everybody
sought to have the 10 o'clock hour
free. Thus the uniform would not
have to be donned until the last min
ute.
Listless Efforts
As for the actual drill, we merely
dragged through the hour. There was
nothing which even approximated
military discipline, in spite of the
guns, the uniforms, and the unappre
ciated efforts of the officers. So list
less were the efforts, that I believe
T could have learned in one week, if
the need had arisen, all that I learned
in three quarters.

To note the difference between the
two methods of teaching the gentle I
art of warfare, I registered in military
at Stanford for the same number of'
quarters. There is almost no compari- I
son between the compulsory and the.
optional systems. Things go over
with a bang here that is unknown
where the student body is forced, at
the threat of expulsion, to drill a cer- i
tain number of hours per week.J
Everything about the Stanford corps
betrays eagerness, aptness, and cour- i
tesy; just about the opposite of what
I saw under the other system.
Thus, to draw conclusions, the very
benefits which are claimed for the i
compulsory system are not obtained
—rather the opposite—except in the ,
case of a small part of those con.
cerned, which group would elect
military under any system. But many
hundreds of men, who will learn lit
tle or nothing about soldiering, are
forced to do something which inter
ests them not at all, under the name
of "patriotism."
Perchance the pacifists of the Uni
versity of California are not as dumb
as President Campbell believes they
are. —Jack Springer.
