Now that the lost script of the sec
ond act has been found, the Junior
Opera people are really getting ex
cited about the performance a week
from Saturday.

It is much more fun to rehearse a
show in a hurry, I mean, if you have
to be a long time on it, the jokes all
get sort of stale. It keeps a freshness
about a show when they don't have
to spend weeks and weeks on it.
And I just know that some of the
people are thinking now of some of
the queer things they are going to do
when the show goes on. Because half
the fun in an opera is waiting for the
unexpected.
I can remember the most amazing
things about what people do, just to
liven up the show. You know, like
falling down in the wrong places; and
nailing books to tables, and filling
glasses with green paint.
Of course, the choruses are going
to be darling. And I think that cam
pus choruses are always better than
professional ones. I mean, they keep
you wondering, in more ways than

one. That is, city groups aren't a bit 1
interesting. You always know just
what they will do under the circum
stances.
The should be good. And
student compositions are always so !
different, and nice. I mean, the tunes j
really are educational because you j
have to thing a long time before you
can remember them. And then, they j
always help to show off the good
voices, too, because their ranges are
always so wide. I mean, they go way
up and way down, which makes a
song more intriguing.
