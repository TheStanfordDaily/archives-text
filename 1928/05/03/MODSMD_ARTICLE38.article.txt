PROPELLING THE PLATTER
Eric Krenz was relating to us re- 1
cently some of the inside facts con
cerning the art of throwing the discus.
He had been asked how he managed
to make those three world's record
throws last week. His explanation,
which seemed too modest to be true,
was that he fouled on all the throws.
It is not hard, Krenz said, for
a discus thrower to get the plat
ter out for a long ride if he over
steps the circle. The greater lat
itude he is allowed on his stance,
the farther the throw. Krenz has
been able for some time to make
long tosses by taking advantage
of a tenfoot "take-off," but the
regulation circle, within which
shot-putters must keep, is only
8 feet 2 inches. He has gradu
ally succeeded in improving his
throwing form, until now, he de
clares, he can occasionally make
the long throws in an 8 foot 6
inch circle. It was as a result of
his overstepping the mark last
Tuesday that he got out those
three hefty heaves over the
world's record distance of 158
feet 1% inches.
The classic pose or stance of the
ancient Greek discus thrower, which
has been preserved in the famous
statue, wouldn't allow a man to get
the ancient platter out very far into
space, according to Krenz. The cor
rect position is a low, bent position,
in which a man looks more like a
Japanese berry-picker than a Greek i
god. As the turns of the body are ,
made, the difficulty enters in of tim
ing the throw so that the swift swing
of the hips may give impetus to the
discus. To get that jerk at the right j
time is the trick of the event, and it
still eludes Krenz, Forster, Hoffman,
Way, and the rest of them.
