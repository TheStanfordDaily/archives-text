CAIRO, May I.—(U.P.)—Possibility
of an early attempt to re-open negotia
tions on the rejected draft of the Anglo-
Egyptian treaty were forecast here to
night following the receipt of the British
note accepting Egypt's compliance with I
the demand of the British ultimatum in
connection with the Assemblies bill.
Considerable relief was expressed in j
government circles when the note from I
London was delivered by the British resi
dency here.
