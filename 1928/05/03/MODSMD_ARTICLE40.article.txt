# BURLINGAME ATTACHES LITTLE LASTING VALUE TO X-RAY EXPERIMENT

### 
"That he got chickens without
wings is probable, but that they were
good chickens I doubt," Dr. L. L.
Burlingame, Professor of Biology
here, commented on the results of
experiments made by Dr. Dieffenbach,
an Eastern scientist, in exposing hen
eggs to X-rays.
Chickens hatching from eggs so
treated evidence wide peculiarities,
according to the reports of Dr. Dief
fenbach, who is a specialist in electro
therapeutics. Mutations caused by
the X-rays resulted in chickens being
hatched without wings and showing
other abnormalities. The scientist
says in many cases these mutations
are advantageous, and tend to create
an improved species of chickens.
Other experiments carried on by
Dr. Dieffenbach with the eggs showed
that when so treated only female
chickens hatched. The explanation ad
vanced for this and concurred in by
I>r. Burlingame is that continued ex
posure to the X-rays causes destruc
tion of the male producing factor in
the fertilized egg.
Other Experiments Made
Such experiments, says Dr. Bur
lingame, have been made on vinegar
flies 'by Dr. Muller at Texas Univer
sity, and Professors Goodspeed and
Olsen at Berkeley have also been
working with the effects of X-rays in
producing mutation. They have found
that the effect of these rays is to
speed up the normal rate of mutation
200 to 2000 times.
