## 
### Alice Ingraham 
Professor of structural engineering
at Stanford since 1893, Charles Ben
jamin Wing will retire next year in
order to devote more time to his po
sition as chairman of the California
State Park Commission.
Graduating from Cornell in the
class of '80, he continued his work
on a fellowship, one of the first to be
given by Cornell University. He be
came an instructor and subsequently
an assistant professor at Cornell, but
in Is9l he was called to the Uni
versity of Wisconsin as professor of
civil engineering. After acting in this
capacity for two years, he was called
to Stanford.
Professor Wing has been consult
ing engineer on a number of im
portant projects, largely along the
line of bridge construction, having
acted in this capacity in the building
of a bridge in Santa Cruz and one in
Oregon. He was the first designer of
the towers for the Poulsen Wireless
Corporation which became the Fed
eral Telegraph Company, and has now
been absorbed by the Mackay inter
ests. Wing designed for the Federal
Company 1000-foot towers which were

to be erected for the system at Pe
king, China, but owing to the inter
national difficulties these towers have
not been built yet.
In addition to his professional
work, Professor Wing was the acting
chairman of the Redwood Park Com
mission for some time, so his present
appointment as chairman of the Cali
fornia State Park Commission is a
logical one.
The American Society of Civil En
gineers is honoring him with a ban
quet in the Stanford Union next Tues
day night at 6:45 o'clock.

A conference of women's colleges,
Wellesley, Vassar, Smith, Mount Hol
