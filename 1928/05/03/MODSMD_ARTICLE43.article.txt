# SPORTS OF 1928
## May Birthdays 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The Emerald is the birthstone of
the merry month of May, yet one can
assemble a cluster of diamond stars
that were born in the fifth month
who will outshine all the emeralds
you can find in Ireland. Just at pres
ent two "May-bees," Ed Rousch and
George Grantham, are in the public
eye, the former because he has at last
begun a baseball season without his
usual hold-out activities and in the
best of physical condition.
Last year Rousch got off to a slow
start with the Giants, after reporting
late, and seemed unable to hit in any
luck until way into the summer. Don't
forget that since 1817, after he was
traded to the reds with "Matty" and
McKechnie, Rousch has never failed
to bat over .300, and in the years

1921, '22, '23, and '24 had the fine av
erage of .350. He is one of the best
outfielders in baseball history.
George Farley Grantham, at this
writing the National League's lead
ing batsman, is now in his fourth
season with the Pirates. With his
former Cub team-mate, Sparky Adams
now playing with him in Pittsburgh,
"Galena George" is going better than
ever.
Here is an all-May team, composed
of stars in or recently in the majors:
catcher, Frank Snyder; pitchers,
Eppa Rixey, Babe Adams, and Blan
kenship; third base, Joe Dugan; out
fielders, Edd Rousch, A1 Simmons,
and Zach Wheat. Joe, Judge, John
Tobin, and Joe Harris were also born
in May, and there are many others.
