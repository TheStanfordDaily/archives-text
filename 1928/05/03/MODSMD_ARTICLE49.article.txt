# Plains Of Lake Manyaro Produce Excellent Athletes Says Walker
## 
### Allan Hart 
The high and open plains around
the shore of Lake Manyaro have tend
ed to make wonderful athletes of the
Mbugwe tribe of natives, who inhabit
that particular part of Africa, accord
ing to Kenneth Walker, who with his
brother, returned a short time ago
from a hunting expedition to this dis
trict. Especially are the Mbugwe men
remarkable as spearsmen and long
distance runners.
The Walkers' party often employed
members of this tribe on their safaris.
After traveling for ten hours in the
hot sun, with a 50-pound load on their
heads, the natives would be released
about fourteen miles from their camp,
and they would cover this distance in
less than an hour and a half.
"We once sent a notoriously slow
runner 175 miles to see if we had any
mail," Walker said. "He was back in
four days." And these are just aver
age times, Walker pointed out.
"We were told there have been
cases of natives running 200 miles in
twenty-four hours. Of course this
would be when they were running for
their lives."
The Mbugwe natives are also ex
ceptional spearsmen. The spear they
use has a seven-foot wooden shaft
with an eighteen-inch double-edged
steel point, and weighs probably
twice as much as the javelin used in
intercollegiate competition. And the
natives throw their spear over 60
yards, as far as a good throw by col
lege athletes.
Ten hours in the hot sun are likely
to give one something of a thirst,
and it is impractical to carry water
on a twenty-day expedition.

"Drinking water was always con
siderable of a problem," Walker said,
"and while in the elephant bush we
struck on a unique way of securing
our water.
"Elephants, being particular about
their water, scorn to drink from the
slimy pools. So they follow up a dry
water course and with their trunks
dig wells in the sand three and a half
to four feet deep and the diameter
of their trunks. Then they leave their
trunks in the sand until they fill with
water, when they blow the contents
into their mouths. We would appro
priate the elephants' drinking "foun
tains" and put them to our own use.
This water, bad enough at best, was
far better than that in the open pools,
from which the other game drink."
