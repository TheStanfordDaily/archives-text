# NEW STYLE GYM UNIFORM ADOPTED BY W.A.A. BOARD
## 
### 
A new style of gymnasium uniform
designed by the Physical Education
department will be worn by the Uni
versity women for athletic purposes
in the future. The choice was made
following a vote of preference in the
gym classes, and by official action of
the Women's Athletic Association
Board.
These new uniforms are made of
much lighter weight material than
those which have been in use, permit
greater freedom of movement, and
present a trimmer appearance. They
are two-piece suits made up in light
tan soisette, and consist of a men's
shirt and knee-length knickers. White
coat sweaters made of the same ma
terial as sweat shirts accompany the
costume, and will be worn when the
weather makes it necessary. Tan elk
skin mocassins and tan ribbed half
hose complete the outfit.

Miss Bunting, professor of physical
education for women and director of
Itoble Gymnasium, says that a change
in the style of uniform has been un
der consideration for some time. The
one chosen is similar in pattern to
uniforms used in certain of the wo
men's colleges and universities in the
East. Because of the California cli
mate, the material from which these
at Stanford will be made is of lighter
weight than those worn elsewhere.
The style of the uniforms will permit
their being used for horseback rid
ing, hiking, camping, and other such
activities.
Next year's incoming freshmen will
be required to purchase the new out
fits, but those who now have the old
style suit will not need to do so. The
cost of the newly adopted uniform
is less than that of those formerly
worn.
