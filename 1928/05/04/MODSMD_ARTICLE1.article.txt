# MCNARY-HAUGEN BILL PASSED BY HOUSE 204-121
## Equalization Fee Clause Is Restored by Congress In Relief Bill Include Four Million Dollar Revolving Fund For Farm Marketing 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 3. —
(U.P.) —The House tonight passed the!
McNary-Haugen farm relief bill carry
ing the equalization fee provision which
caused President Coolidgc to veto the
bill a year ago.

The vote was 204 to 121.
This vote was short of the two-thirds
which would be necessary to pass the
bill over the President's veto. More
than one hundred congressmen did not
vote.
The Senate passed the bill a few weeks
ago. The House has amended the meas
ure slightly and after these differences
have been adjusted the measure will be |
ready for the President. It has been |
strongly intimated at the White House:
that President Coolidge will veto the bill I
as he did a year ago.

Shortly before the bill was passed the
House adopted an amendment urged by
cotton growing states which would pre
vent the Farm Board from assessing an
equalization fee on any commodity unless
the Commodity Council provided in the
bill approved it.

The bill, a football in Congress for
several years, has been supported by
Vice-President Dawes and Governor
Lowden of Illinois and has been a factor i
in the consideration of them as Republi
can presidential candidates. Secretary of
Commerce Hoover, adhering to the pol
icy of the Coolidge administration, has :
opposed the bill.
The bill's central feature is the equali-;
zation fee plan to finance the buying up ;
of surplus crops to be dumped abroad at
a loss if necessary, this loss to be ab- j
sorbed through a fee charged back to the
farmers on a pro-rata basis. President j
Coolidge has opposed this as being un
constitutional and likely to create a gov
ernment price-fixing bureaucracy. Many
in Congress have supported the bill some
what reluctantly upon the theory that
whatever its shortcomings, practically
everything else has been tried without
bringing relief to the farmer.
The bill also would set up a $400,000,- ;
000 revolving fund to be used by co- j
operative organizations in controlling the j
marketing of farm products. The bill
provides that this plan shall be exhausted j
before resorting to the equalization fee. ;
The President favors this portion of the j
bill.

The bill's central feature is the equali-;
zation fee plan to finance the buying up ;
of surplus crops to be dumped abroad at
a loss if necessary, this loss to be ab- j
sorbed through a fee charged back to the
farmers on a pro-rata basis. President j
Coolidge has opposed this as being un
constitutional and likely to create a gov

in Congress have supported the bill some

whatever its shortcomings, practically
everything else has been tried without
bringing relief to the farmer.
The bill also would set up a $400,000,- ;

WASHINGTON, D.C., May 3. —
(U.P.) —The House tonight passed the!
McNary-Haugen farm relief bill carry
ing the equalization fee provision which
caused President Coolidgc to veto the
bill a year ago.

The vote was 204 to 121.
This vote was short of the two-thirds
which would be necessary to pass the
bill over the President's veto. More
than one hundred congressmen did not
vote.
The Senate passed the bill a few weeks
ago. The House has amended the meas
ure slightly and after these differences
have been adjusted the measure will be |
ready for the President. It has been |
strongly intimated at the White House:
that President Coolidge will veto the bill I
as he did a year ago.

Shortly before the bill was passed the
House adopted an amendment urged by
cotton growing states which would pre
vent the Farm Board from assessing an
equalization fee on any commodity unless
the Commodity Council provided in the
bill approved it.

The bill, a football in Congress for
several years, has been supported by
Vice-President Dawes and Governor
Lowden of Illinois and has been a factor i
in the consideration of them as Republi
can presidential candidates. Secretary of
Commerce Hoover, adhering to the pol
icy of the Coolidge administration, has :
