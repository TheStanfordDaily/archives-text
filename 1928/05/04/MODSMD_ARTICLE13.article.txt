### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 3.—( U.P.)
—More than 95 per cent of the votes cast
in California's presidential primary elec
tion had been reported tonight and
showed that Herbert Hoover, the Repub
lican, would receive nearly 600,000 votes
while Governor A1 Smith's margin of
victory in the Democratic race would be
about 73,000 votes.

The delegation of 29 members pledged
to vote for Hoover at the Kansas City
convention received approximately three
fourths of the total vote, which would
exceed 800,000.

This was considered exceptional in view
of the fact that Hoover was not opposed.

Fluctuation of the vote for the three
Democratic candidates was barely per
ceptible as the final precincts were being
heard from. Senator James A. Reed of
Missouri was running second, approxi
mately 73,000 votes behind Smith, while
Thomas J. Walsh of Montana was about
11,000 votes behind Reed.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark., May 3. —
(U.P.) —The Arkansas State Republican
Convention voted today to send an un

convention, defeating the efforts of sup
porters of Frank O. Lowden to have the

nor for the presidential nomination.
The vote was 255 to 2.1 against an in
structed delegation.
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 3. —
Despite the gains of Governor Smith,
Senator James A. Reed of Missouri will
go on with his campaign for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination, he said to
day. Reed made this known in a tele
gram to Josephus Daniels.
"I shall go on with my campaign,"
Reed said. "I am a Democrat. It is the
duty and mission of the Democratic party
to wipe out corruption and restore decent
and popular government."
