# Broadway Flavor Marks Music For 1929 Junior Opera
## Jazz Orchestra Will Play Accompaniments for Songs, Choruses 
### Margaret Cummings 
Music a la Broadway and the New
York musical comedy shows will give
a true professional finish to the
Junior Opera, "South Seas Preferred,"
to be given next Saturday night. A
special jazz orchestra will play, and
the orchestration of the musical
scroll has been planned to take ad
vantage of the particular skill of each
member of the orchestra. Ted Dun
can, musical director, who has had
considerable experience in this field,
has been in charge.

Lyrics and music for the songs
have been contributed by such popu
lar campus composers as Jack Wig
gin, Larry Staley, A1 Cass, Greg Wil
liamson, Neal Spaulding, and others.
"Someday, Somewhere" is the "hit"
of the show, and was written by
Wiggin and Williamson. Wigging was
musical director for the 1926 dra
matic council season, and has written
songs for all the football gaieties and
operas.
"We're Off to the Goo-Goo Isles," a
fast, rollicking fox-trot by Ted Dun
'•an, is the theme song. Toya, played
by Jeanette Owens, will sing "My
Heart Can't Belong to You." The
music of this is by Neal Spaulding,
assistant musical director, and Ted
Duncan wrote the lyric.

A1 Cass and Julia North will sing
"I'll Be a One-Gal Sailor," composed
by Cass, and for which he has worked
out the entire accompaniment. From
rehearsals it gives every indication
of being as good as "Tough," a Cass,
Randall duet in the 1925 Gaieties.

"Magic Isle" by Staley will be in
troduced as a duet by Tom Watt and
Mavnor Shove who gained fame by
their harmony singing in Encina
Hall this year. The Pirate quartette
by Jack Meakin is quite as good as
"Melody Manglers" in the last foot
ball show.
