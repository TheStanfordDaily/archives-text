# WALKER RELATES FURTHER EXPERIENCES IN JUNGLES

One docs not ordinarily associate rhi
noceroses with motor trucks, but Ken
neth Walker, '27, found that in the Afri
can jungle they may sometimes come too
close together. There were days, Walker
says, when they would have to ward off
as many as four or five charges from
rhinoceroses while driving along.
"In one place," Walker continued, "we
had to build five miles of road and
bridge four rivers—and the road had to
be literally cut through the jungle—to
reach an open country on the other side
of the lake. While the road was being
constructed the 'rhinos' would bother the
natives—would chase them up trees.
When we came through on the trucks,
we had to be on our guard, but we
weren't actually challenged in the bush.
But out on the open plains along side the
jungle, 'rhinos' would get our wind and
come charging out at the trucks. We
would drive slowly ahead, taking moving
pictures all the time, until the 'rhinos' got
dangerously close—say thirty feet. Then

we would give the truck the 'gun* and
pull ahead. A truck following would take
moving pictures of the whole proceed
ing."
Rhinoceroses have two unusual char
acteristics: they arc very short sighted,
and they arc exceedingly stupid. Walker
tells about one time when a rhinoceros
was "planted" squarely in the middle of
a narrow part of the road. The hunters
stopped the trucks about a hundred yards
off, since the animal cannot see over fifty
yards and therefore would not charge
them. Not wanting to kill him, they shot
bullets from their 30 Springfield guns
sometimes within six inches of his nose,
raising little puffs of dust. But not even
this would disturb the rhinoceros, though
lie would just push his nose forward a
little, and sniff the ground where the
bullet had hit. After delaying them for
fifteen minutes, he apparently tired of
the "sport" and lumbered off into the
jungle.
Birds and snakes were plentiful in the
