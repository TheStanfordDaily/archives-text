# WALKER RELATES FURTHER EXPERIENCES IN JUNGLES

One docs not ordinarily associate rhi
noceroses with motor trucks, but Ken
neth Walker, '27, found that in the Afri
can jungle they may sometimes come too
close together. There were days, Walker
says, when they would have to ward off
as many as four or five charges from
rhinoceroses while driving along.
"In one place," Walker continued, "we
had to build five miles of road and
bridge four rivers—and the road had to
be literally cut through the jungle—to
reach an open country on the other side
of the lake. While the road was being
constructed the 'rhinos' would bother the
natives—would chase them up trees.
When we came through on the trucks,
we had to be on our guard, but we
weren't actually challenged in the bush.
But out on the open plains along side the
jungle, 'rhinos' would get our wind and
come charging out at the trucks. We
would drive slowly ahead, taking moving
pictures all the time, until the 'rhinos' got
dangerously close—say thirty feet. Then

we would give the truck the 'gun* and
pull ahead. A truck following would take
moving pictures of the whole proceed
ing."
Rhinoceroses have two unusual char
acteristics: they arc very short sighted,
and they arc exceedingly stupid. Walker
tells about one time when a rhinoceros
was "planted" squarely in the middle of
a narrow part of the road. The hunters
stopped the trucks about a hundred yards
off, since the animal cannot see over fifty
yards and therefore would not charge
them. Not wanting to kill him, they shot
bullets from their 30 Springfield guns
sometimes within six inches of his nose,
raising little puffs of dust. But not even
this would disturb the rhinoceros, though
lie would just push his nose forward a
little, and sniff the ground where the
bullet had hit. After delaying them for
fifteen minutes, he apparently tired of
the "sport" and lumbered off into the
jungle.
Birds and snakes were plentiful in the
party's hunting country. The Muscovic
duck, as large as the common wild goose,
was plentiful and very good eating. The
pow, a large game bird weighing as
much as thirty pounds, was also very
good game food.

"Pheasants and partridge were plenti
ful, and African quail, about the size of
English sparrows, were there in great
numbers," said Walker.

The party had a number of experi
ences with the black momba snake, whose
poison brings immediate death.
"One day," Walker relates, "a native
started to climb a large tree. When he
got about twenty feet from the ground
he saw two bright eyes peering out from
a hole. Thinking them those of a bird
he reached in, and was bit by one of these
tnombas. He started for the ground as
fast as he could go, and fell the last
three or four feet. But he was dead be
fore he reached the ground."
