An organization which calls itself the Evolution Publishing Corpora
tion, and edits the magazine Evolution, calls its semi-tabloid effort "A
Journal of Nature." About the only nature it seems to deal with is ill
nature. While professedly attempting to further the cause of truth in
matters evolutionary, the publication merely makes a screaming and alto
gether weak attack on the fundamentalists.

In trying to batter down the stand of the fundamentalists this sheet
runs such things as the picture of a monkey with an inscription reading:
"Here's a portrait of the editor's great, great, great, great . . . grand
father. Isn't he nice? You see, he comes from a race distinguished even
in antiquity for its sense of humor." It is just this sort of thing that
scientists have been trying to do away with. To say that man is a de
scendant of monkeys is to twist things in just the way the opponents of
evolution have been doing for decades. This prejudices even one who has
an open mind, and certainly tends to keep the people already fundamental
ist in opinion from investigating.

The first prerequisite to the scientific thinker is an open mind. A
direct antithesis to this is shown in an article run in "Evolution," concern
ing a questionnaire sent out to college presidents. Four main questions
were: Is evolution taught in your institution; is it taught as fact or as
mere theory; do YOU consider evolution a fact; should teaching evolution
be prohibited by law? Out of the answers it is found that the great
majority do teach the subject, that most of the men consider it to be a
fact, and that an almost unanimous numl)er felt that it should not be
outlawed, but as to whether it was fact or theory there was a more even
division.
From the small percentage of answers received it can be seen what the
prexies think of such methods of scientific publicity, some of them even
writing letters to the effect. J. Oliver Buswell, Jr., said, "We have a thor
oughly equipped and well organized group of scientific laboratories in
Wheaton College, but we have no sympathy whatsoever with an atheistic
propaganda which masks itself with the popular scientific terms of our
day." There was not a single president of a large college which answered
the questionnaire, according to the report. The editors of the magazine
assume, however, that "the larger universities . . . would, of course, be
unanimous for evolution." Probably this is true, but such a statement is
indicative of this group's attitude.

In answering the question, "Do YOU consider evolution a fact?"
several presidents went to the trouble to point out the near-impossibility
to answer: one said, "It depends on what you mean by evolution." He*
was called a pussyfooter. Another replied, "Your question indicates im
maturity of thought." He, too, was belittled by the magazine, as pussy
footing.
Such methods of spreading scientific truth are not merely foolish, they
are just the sort that will give those who are narrow and bigoted some
thing to hang their hats on. Thus, they defeat their own purpose. It is
probable, however, that this particular popularization is not in any way
intended to advance honest science. It appears more to be an atheistic
program bent on destruction, and worrying little, if any, about con
struction.

outlawed, but as to whether it was fact or theory there was a more even
division.
From the small percentage of answers received it can be seen what the
prexies think of such methods of scientific publicity, some of them even
writing letters to the effect. J. Oliver Buswell, Jr., said, "We have a thor
oughly equipped and well organized group of scientific laboratories in
Wheaton College, but we have no sympathy whatsoever with an atheistic
propaganda which masks itself with the popular scientific terms of our
day." There was not a single president of a large college which answered
the questionnaire, according to the report. The editors of the magazine
assume, however, that "the larger universities . . . would, of course, be
unanimous for evolution." Probably this is true, but such a statement is
indicative of this group's attitude.

In answering the question, "Do YOU consider evolution a fact?"
several presidents went to the trouble to point out the near-impossibility
to answer: one said, "It depends on what you mean by evolution." He*
was called a pussyfooter. Another replied, "Your question indicates im
maturity of thought." He, too, was belittled by the magazine, as pussy
footing.
Such methods of spreading scientific truth are not merely foolish, they
are just the sort that will give those who are narrow and bigoted some
thing to hang their hats on. Thus, they defeat their own purpose. It is
probable, however, that this particular popularization is not in any way
intended to advance honest science. It appears more to be an atheistic
program bent on destruction, and worrying little, if any, about con
struction.
An organization which calls itself the Evolution Publishing Corpora
tion, and edits the magazine Evolution, calls its semi-tabloid effort "A
Journal of Nature." About the only nature it seems to deal with is ill
nature. While professedly attempting to further the cause of truth in
matters evolutionary, the publication merely makes a screaming and alto
gether weak attack on the fundamentalists.

In trying to batter down the stand of the fundamentalists this sheet
runs such things as the picture of a monkey with an inscription reading:
"Here's a portrait of the editor's great, great, great, great . . . grand
father. Isn't he nice? You see, he comes from a race distinguished even
in antiquity for its sense of humor." It is just this sort of thing that
scientists have been trying to do away with. To say that man is a de
scendant of monkeys is to twist things in just the way the opponents of
evolution have been doing for decades. This prejudices even one who has
an open mind, and certainly tends to keep the people already fundamental
ist in opinion from investigating.

The first prerequisite to the scientific thinker is an open mind. A
direct antithesis to this is shown in an article run in "Evolution," concern
ing a questionnaire sent out to college presidents. Four main questions
were: Is evolution taught in your institution; is it taught as fact or as
mere theory; do YOU consider evolution a fact; should teaching evolution
be prohibited by law? Out of the answers it is found that the great
majority do teach the subject, that most of the men consider it to be a
fact, and that an almost unanimous numl)er felt that it should not be
outlawed, but as to whether it was fact or theory there was a more even
