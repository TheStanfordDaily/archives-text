Miss Helen Masters Bunting, Director of Women's Physical Educa
tion, C. W. Davis, Director of Intramural Sports, Ruth Silliman, of the
W.A.A. board, and Stanley Cook, representing the men's intramural de
partment, have organized an all-University mixed doubles tennis tourna
ment, to start May 10. The idea is an excellent one, we think, and speaks
for itself. Athletic competitions for men and women together seem to be
much needed on the Stanford campus, where about the only sports to be
mutually enjoyed are horseback riding and swimming in Lagunita.
Start now to line up your partners for the tourney. The event is open
to all registered students, and if a player has no partner in mind, he or
she may register for a "blind" partner.

The more one thinks of the plan, the more alluring it is. Tennis has a
peculiarly fitting vocabulary for the use of mixed doubles teams. For
example, you can say roughly, 40-love; or you can chirp 40, love, raising
your voice at the end. But you had better not practice the latter too much,
if you are out to win, because there will be many experienced and able
teams entered solely for the love of the game.
