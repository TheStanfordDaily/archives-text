# Slingers vs. Sluggers
## 
### 
Sunday morning at ten o'clock the famous Press team will meet the
Stanford Daily nine on the varsity diamond for the annual tussle between
the ink-slingers and the lead-sluggers. The Press outfit has been training
for this seven-inning go for many months, and claim that they have an
unbeatable aggregation, but the Daily squad, which does not need so much
practice, they being a lot of healthy young lads, avow that the old fogies
in the Press-room are going to take the drubbing of their lives.
This battle will determine whether or not the typewriter is mightier
than the font, a subject which has been argued for years without either
side winning a fall. The trouble with the printers is that they think they
are indispensable to the writers. Well, last year the Daily boys gave them
the game so they could have a moral victory on this great argument,
because, although they get pretty cocky, they do much letter work when
they can take a dig or two at the front office. So, let the flies land where
they may.
