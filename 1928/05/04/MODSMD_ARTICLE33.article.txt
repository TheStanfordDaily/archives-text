OUR FAILING SOCIAL LIFE
Pursuant to observations made earlier
in the week, we will next consider the de
cline of the larger student social func
tions, as noted from a rough survey of
the dates granted by the Ex Committee
for the January-May period of the years
from 1923 to the present time.
The decline in this case, as with the
fraternities and sororities, is very notice
able, running from a large number of
all-campus functions in 1923 and '24 to
two registration dances, the Masque Ball,
and the Military Ball as the sum total for
the same period this year.
Going and Gone

The social calendar four years or so
back was filled with the names of organi
zations giving dances. One sees a date
set for a Union Club dance, a Stanford
Band dance, a W.A.A.-Scalpers ball, and
a Boat House Ball, the latter to be given
in conjunction with lake sports. (This
party had to be called off, however, as
it was feared the boathouse might col
lapse under the shaking.) In addition to
the Cord Ball, there was also what was
known as a Decorators' Ball for the
Juniors. Junior Week, unlike it is now,
was something of a real event. Today one
might ask, where is the Decorators' Ball,
and what is the Cord Ball? One has gone
and the other is tottering.

The decline in Hall dances has not been
quite so great as has the all-campus and
the Row dances, probably because the
force of custom is more continuous in
such groups. That the interest has fallen
off here too is apparent, nor does one fail
to remember the Encina formal of a year
or so ago which went in the hole to the
tune of something like $800.
Spontaneity Lacking

The present social tone of the campus
might best be characterized as indifferent.
The dances are few and far between, and
most of them can be measured by how
dull they are rather than by any standard
of excellence. All the element of spon
taneity seems to be gone out of our social
life, leaving only a perfunctory interest
in the remaining events on the social cal
endar. The cmpus being no longer so
cially sufficient, those who would play
must turn to the white lights of San
Francisco.
The problem is a difficult one, admitting
that the general welfare of the student
body might be advanced by a return to a
more even balance between the on- and
off-campus attractions. The success of
the Masque Ball gives a suggestion of a
way out. While there was nothing par
ticularly spontaneous about the event, it
being preceded by weeks of extensive
publicity, the success of the affair was
certainly very gratifying.
Keep the Price Down
What we need more of right now are
dances on the plan of the Masque Ball:
reasonably priced affairs staged and
backed by competent organizations. Dec
orations are not particularly necessary tc
an informal dance, nor does the group
giving the dance need a large margin of
profit; hence the admission price can be
kept down.

This is not much of a panacea for all
ills, we admit, but just at this time even
suggestions are badly needed.

Because it is too late to tear Stanford
down and move it nearer to San Fran
cisco, this problem, out of fairness to the
happiness of the whole group, should
merit serious consideration.

and the other is tottering.

The decline in Hall dances has not been
quite so great as has the all-campus and
the Row dances, probably because the
force of custom is more continuous in
such groups. That the interest has fallen
off here too is apparent, nor does one fail
to remember the Encina formal of a year
or so ago which went in the hole to the
tune of something like $800.
Spontaneity Lacking

The present social tone of the campus
might best be characterized as indifferent.
The dances are few and far between, and
most of them can be measured by how
dull they are rather than by any standard
of excellence. All the element of spon
taneity seems to be gone out of our social
life, leaving only a perfunctory interest
in the remaining events on the social cal
endar. The cmpus being no longer so
cially sufficient, those who would play
must turn to the white lights of San
Francisco.
The problem is a difficult one, admitting
that the general welfare of the student
body might be advanced by a return to a
more even balance between the on- and
off-campus attractions. The success of
the Masque Ball gives a suggestion of a
way out. While there was nothing par
ticularly spontaneous about the event, it
being preceded by weeks of extensive
publicity, the success of the affair was
certainly very gratifying.
Keep the Price Down
What we need more of right now are
dances on the plan of the Masque Ball:
reasonably priced affairs staged and
backed by competent organizations. Dec
orations are not particularly necessary tc
an informal dance, nor does the group
giving the dance need a large margin of
profit; hence the admission price can be
kept down.

This is not much of a panacea for all
ills, we admit, but just at this time even
suggestions are badly needed.

Because it is too late to tear Stanford
down and move it nearer to San Fran
cisco, this problem, out of fairness to the
happiness of the whole group, should
merit serious consideration.

OUR FAILING SOCIAL LIFE
Pursuant to observations made earlier
in the week, we will next consider the de
cline of the larger student social func
tions, as noted from a rough survey of
the dates granted by the Ex Committee
for the January-May period of the years
from 1923 to the present time.
The decline in this case, as with the
fraternities and sororities, is very notice
able, running from a large number of
all-campus functions in 1923 and '24 to
two registration dances, the Masque Ball,
and the Military Ball as the sum total for
the same period this year.
Going and Gone

The social calendar four years or so
back was filled with the names of organi
zations giving dances. One sees a date
set for a Union Club dance, a Stanford
Band dance, a W.A.A.-Scalpers ball, and
a Boat House Ball, the latter to be given
in conjunction with lake sports. (This
party had to be called off, however, as
it was feared the boathouse might col
lapse under the shaking.) In addition to
the Cord Ball, there was also what was
known as a Decorators' Ball for the
Juniors. Junior Week, unlike it is now,
was something of a real event. Today one
might ask, where is the Decorators' Ball,
and what is the Cord Ball? One has gone
and the other is tottering.
