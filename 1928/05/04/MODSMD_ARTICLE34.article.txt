"Love Sonnets of a Cave Man." Don
Marquis, Doubleday, Doran & Co.
The lyric laments of the reincar
nated Pithecanthropus Erectus, Don
Marquis, are the correct thing for this
sort of weather. "The Primitive's the
Mode!" he says, "Shall we not roar
our Pleistocene affections as of
yore?" And roars them through
twenty-five moods of a gentle pre
historic lady, from the loud roar: "I
do recall as if 'twere yesterday, that
time your teeth met through my dex
ter wrist." To the whispering roar:
"My Love, I am not always violent!
Sometimes, when gorged with meat,
musing I lie . . . sometimes I am a
most Poetic Gent! Sometimes, my
Sweet, when I'm replete with food, I
only wish to sing and purr and coo!"

Personally, we adore every word of
it because we have that sort of mind.
It's delicious nonsense, and thei*e's so
much poor foolishness around that
this is a blessing and a miracle.

In short, nearly everyone with a
sense of humor will enjoy it, and if
you are not sure whether you have or
not, take Almack's humor test (now
on call at the Chaparral office. You
will find out things about yourself
you never knew before).

And by the way, the circus was here
the other day, and Tom, the Palo Alto
boa constrictor, won the wrestling
match. The calliope callioped, Lotus,
the largest blood-sweating hippopota
mus in captivity, hippoed, and "Bim
bo," the only singing donkey in the
world, sang. â€”Hallie Keating.
