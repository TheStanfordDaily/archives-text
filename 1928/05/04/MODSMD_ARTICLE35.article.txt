# CABBAGES and THINGS
## THE 						MEDAL WINNER 
### 
A flash, a crash, a dash of spray,
And Fishy Jones was on his way;
A hump, a jump, a labored grunt—
'Tis Fishy Jones must bear the
brunt;
A swish, a swosh, a sploch—b'gosh!
He passed the flash from far Osh
kosh;
And won a noble disk of tin!
—Percy Bysshe Shelley VI.
