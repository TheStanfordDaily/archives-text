The Editor, Sir:
I am taking a course in French.
The other day our prof gave us one
of his atrocious dict6es. I was, unlike
the rest of the class, quite pleased
to have a I was thrilled be
cause on every preceding one I had
made from ten to twenty errors. This
time, however, I knew my stuff! I
was going to surprise the old fellow!
I alone —I, who had so miserably
failed heretofore, was able to raise
my dainty fist in reply to his query,
"How many made no mistakes?"
Imagine my embarrassment when he
continued, "Very good, I congratulate
you. And I am sure that there will
be more of your kind when we do it
next Friday for grades."
Yours for justice,
Chagrined, '31.
