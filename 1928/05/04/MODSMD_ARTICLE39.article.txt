# PROFESSOR BASSETT RELATES HISTORY OF OLD VIC THEATRE
## 
### 
"The history of the Old Vic theatre
is a remarkable illustration of the
bad policy of giving to theatre-goers
the type of entertainment they are
thought to desire. In its early period
the Old Vic presented nothing but the
very rankest of entertainment, sim
ply because the management believed
the people could not appreciate a
higher degree of entertainment," de
clared Lee Emerson Bassett of the
Department of English in an inter
view with the Daily yesterday. Pro
fessor Bassett visited the old theatre
on his recent trip abroad and has
made a study of its history. Saturday
morning he will speak on "The Old
Vic" before the Speech Arts Associa
tion in San Francisco.

The Old Vic began life as the Royal
Coburg, which opened in London May
12, 1818. Situated in what later be
came one of the poorest districts of
London's south side, it was sedom
visited by the more cultured. In 1833
Queen Victoria visited it and the
theatre was renamed after her and
another, rather vain attempt made to
place it among the better theatres.

In the middle of the last century
the theatre became notorious as the
home of the deepest-dyed melodrama,
and was rescued by Emma Cons, a
Lambeth housing expert, who had
carried on various improvements in
the district and who found the dis
reputable old place had a bad effect
on the lives of her tenants.
Professor Bassctt attended a perform
ance of "II Trovatore" while in London.
"The sccncry used is of the simplest type
and the productions arc perhaps lacking
in the niceties and details of our l>est
productions. However, it is the intense
interest given and enjoyment obtained by
its patrons, the majority of which are to
be found in the poor classes, that make
it a success.
Dramas and operas for the present sea
son include Carmen, Madame Butterfly,
King Lear, Faust, Rigoletto, and others.
The leads arc taken by professional play
ers who wore paid a maximum of $10.
