# VINCENTI STATES NATURE OF TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
## Dr. Wilbur Derives Power to Regulate Driving Rights as Disciplinary Measure From Trustees; Delegated Authority to Councils 
### 
Complete summary of the nature,
1 jurisdiction, and operation of the
! Stanford Student Traffic Court,
! which has been approved by Presi-
I dent Wilbur, Comptroller Almon E.
Roth, the Men's and Women's Coun
cils, is given below in a communi
j cation fjrom Louis Vincenti, chairman
j of the Men's Council.

"The power and authority to regu
late driving privileges among the
students is derived by the President
of the University as one of the disci
plinary powers granted by the Board
of Trustees. This power of traffic
regulation, which applies only to stu
dents and not to the general public,
has at various times been directed,
and applied through the Comptroller's
office and the County Courts. While
this means was successful in a meas
ure at Stanford, it has not averted
serious accidents at other universi
ties throughout the country.
"In order to lessen the possibility
of some serious accident among the
Stanford students, the President, the

Comptroller, and the members of the
Men's and Women's Councils last fall
started to organize a new method
of regulating student operators.
Authority Explained
"After serious consideration, the
President delegated to the councils
the regulation of driving privileges
and left to their discretion the meth
ods of enforcing any rules which they
might formulate. The councils, in
exercising this power, do not do so
as bodies organized and elected under
the Student Body Constitution, but
as separate bodies designated by the
President to enforce disciplinary pow
ers made by the President to the
Student Body included only those
exercised at the time of the grant by
the Faculty Committee of Student
Affairs.

"The regulation of motor traffic
never came under the jurisdiction of
this committee, for at the time of its
existence there was no motor traffic
to be regulated. Therefore, it can be
j clearly seen, that in exercising the i
j ; power of traffic regulation, the Coun- j
; ells are not acting under the Student
, Body Constitution and are not bound
e ' by any provisions which are contained
11 therein, but are responsible only to
j the President of the University,
f State Law Criterion
- j "It must not be forgotten that the
s j State can still arrest and prosecute
e students for violation of the State
- Motor Vehicle Laws. It is only
2 through the courtesy of the Motor i
' Vehicle Department at Sacramento !
" that students are not ordered to ap
- pear at the police courts as well as
t before the Student Councils. This
1 ; shows the necessity of strict enforce
-1 ment by the Councils or else the j
State will be forced to again bring '
* the student to trial before its own j
I courts.
"The Councils have adopted the !
-j State Laws as the criterion by which j
- j to punish students. A violation of the
' | state law is an offense which the
Councils feel duty bound to punish.
The Councils have formulated a
schedule of penalties modeled on the |
one used by the City of San Fran- j
cisco. If this schedule is examined, it !
• will be noted that the fine imposed j
'; for speeding is most severe. This is j
in keeping with the belief of the
II Council that speeding is the cause
| of the large majority of accidents,
| ! and that an elimination of speeding
will eliminate auy serious accidents
I and thereby prevent a state of affairs
_ which can be remedied only by refus-1
. ing students the privilege of owning j
. or operating motor cars on the cam- j
. pus.
The Councils do not apply the j
schedule arbitrarily, but are always
- willing and eager to recognize any j
i peculiar position of the individual and j
. to assess a penalty that will work j
i justice in each case.
Fines Not Arbitrary
[ "The fines which are assessed are |
1 paid at the Accounting Office in the |
• Administration Building, and go into :
J a fund for the maintenance of campus
* roads and payment of the traffic of
ficer furnished by the county. Efforts 1
have been made to have the campus :
roads properly sign-posted and ar- j
'! terial stop signs have been installed j
j at dangerous intersections.
"The Councils do not recognize the i
claim of any student to the right to j
be tried in the county court alone. \
He may go there if he chooses, but
the Councils will not surrender their j
jurisdiction on account of it. To do
so would be to lose all effective j
means of controlling student drivers. '

"In closing it might be well to note ' |
that in the four months in which the !
system has been in operation, there i
has been a marked decrease in the
; number of accidents and arrests, and ]
j a marked increase in the care exer- l
cised by drivers.
"The members of the Councils i
realize that the system is not perfect, j
but we are endeavoring to perfect it £
and welcome the constructive criti-
cism of any of the students who care
to put their suggestions in writing. ; (

Complete summary of the nature,
1 jurisdiction, and operation of the
! Stanford Student Traffic Court,
! which has been approved by Presi-
I dent Wilbur, Comptroller Almon E.
Roth, the Men's and Women's Coun
cils, is given below in a communi
j cation fjrom Louis Vincenti, chairman
j of the Men's Council.

"The power and authority to regu
late driving privileges among the
students is derived by the President
of the University as one of the disci
plinary powers granted by the Board
of Trustees. This power of traffic
regulation, which applies only to stu
dents and not to the general public,
has at various times been directed,
and applied through the Comptroller's
office and the County Courts. While
this means was successful in a meas
ure at Stanford, it has not averted
serious accidents at other universi
ties throughout the country.
"In order to lessen the possibility
of some serious accident among the
Stanford students, the President, the

Comptroller, and the members of the
Men's and Women's Councils last fall
started to organize a new method
of regulating student operators.
Authority Explained
"After serious consideration, the
President delegated to the councils
the regulation of driving privileges
and left to their discretion the meth
ods of enforcing any rules which they
might formulate. The councils, in
exercising this power, do not do so
as bodies organized and elected under
the Student Body Constitution, but
as separate bodies designated by the
President to enforce disciplinary pow
ers made by the President to the
Student Body included only those
exercised at the time of the grant by
the Faculty Committee of Student
Affairs.

"The regulation of motor traffic
never came under the jurisdiction of
this committee, for at the time of its
existence there was no motor traffic
to be regulated. Therefore, it can be
j clearly seen, that in exercising the i
j ; power of traffic regulation, the Coun- j
; ells are not acting under the Student
, Body Constitution and are not bound

11 therein, but are responsible only to
j the President of the University,
