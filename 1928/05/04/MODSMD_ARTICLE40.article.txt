# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY RECEIVES COLLECTION OF SOCIALIST PAPERS
## Articles Cover Period From 1876 to 1907, Include Foreign Material 
### 
A collection of socialist papers, some
printed in 1876, and the latest in 1907, was |
presented to the Hoover War Library last
week. The majority of the papers are
British, but there are also some from
France, Russia, and Germany.
Freedom of the press in Great Britain
and freedom for Russia are the main de
mands of the papers. Articles headed
"Anarchism Defined," "Socialism Made
Plain," and "Educate, Agitate, Organize,"
give a fair idea of the material.
One paper has in it an address entitled I
"Old Ossawattomie Brown," given by
Juhn Swinton in New York on December
2, 1881, anniversary of John Brown's
death. The outstanding paragraph is, "As
Samson in his death brought down the I
temple of Dagon, as John Brown in his 1
death shivered the bulwarks of the chat- :
tel of slavery, so every martyr hastens the
end of the system under which he is sac
ficed."
The papers are not on exhibition yet,
but anyone may look through them. A,
few will probably be exhibited next week.
The special exhibit this week is made upi
of honor rolls from different universities
and organizations, with a book of eighty
pastels by Eugene Burnand, a Swiss art
ist, of leaders of the Allies in the World
War.
