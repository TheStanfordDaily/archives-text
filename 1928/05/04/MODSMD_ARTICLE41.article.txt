# CALIFORNIA LANDSCAPE PAINTINGS ON DISPLAY IN STANFORD GALLERY
## 
### 
A collection of twenty-one oil paint
ings of California landscapes by Ada
Belle Champlin of Pasadena will be
on exhibition at the Stanford Art
Gallery beginning Sunday.

The paintings have a restful quality
and are painted in a manner that
suggests a decided method and yet
versatile in showing the various
moods of nature, from the soft, at
mospheric subjects to the clearer and
more brilliant. To those who have
stayed any length of time at Carmel
and its environs, "The Carmel Dunes,"
"Carmel Playground," and "Carmel
Shore" will appeal.

In "The River Valley," the distance
of river, trees, and mountains makes
a deep, soft background for the clear,
strong tree in the foreground, giving
a very pleasant contrast. Some of the
other titles are "December Syca
more," "Monterey," "Eaton's Canyon,"
and "Eucalypti."
