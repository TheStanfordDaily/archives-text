PRINCETON, N.J, May 3.—( U.P.)
—'Tin strong for the co-ed and heartily;
I believe in co-education. It seems to me
1 that it is preferable for the college man
; to have his association with women within
the college than with outsiders. When
there is no opportunity within the college,
men will go outside and associate with
women of a lower intellectual and social
i standing."
Hey wood Broun, columnist of the
"World" and the "Nation," put much
emphasis on this statement.
"Co-education is no doubt the best so
lution to our problem. There's hardly a
better meeting ground and it has an in
tellectual setting. Here men meet women
of similar intellectual capacities and at
tainments. And, then, when they go out
into the business and professional worlds,
they all go as equals."
Classes at 8 o'clock practically do
i not exist at Harvard University and
a 9 o'clock lecture is an atrocity.
