Stanford's recent boxing tourney
brings to mind the question asked by
Gene Tunney when he visited the
campus last year. Why, the champion
pugilist demanded, is it that in col
lege the manly art of self defense
must take a back seat to most other
sports?
Although the big crowd which
turned out for the bouts last
month seems to indicate that box
ing is becoming more and more
popular at Stanford, it remains
that Mr. Tunney's inquiry is jus
tified.
The fact that boxing is rated as a
minor sport here and at other univer
sities, shows in itself that it doesn't
exist on a par with football, basket
ball, baseball, or track. Just why is
the question.
Tunney presented some very valid
arguments for the game. He pointed
out that it appeals to the cave man
instinct as well as football or any of
the others, fie showed that speed,
action, strength, quick-thinking, and
grace are required in boxing more
than in any other sport. It develops
courage, self-reliance, and an instinct
for fair play.
Why then, is it relegated to the
athletic background in college?
There are at least two good an
swers. First, some of Mr. Tun
ney's colleagues in the profes
sional fighting game have hardly
been of the type to reflect honor
on the business. Prize-fighting has
come to be looked upon in about
the same light as slugging peo
ple and robbing banks. Second,
it is human nature to appreciate
a type of co-ordination not seen
in boxing—teamwork.
Fans love to see a quarterback
wisely choose a play; they love to
see the leather oval spin out of the
center's hand. It is a thrill to observe
a crouching half speed around end
behind a smashing interference which
knocks a wide path through the op
position. Boxing has speed and action
and requires sagacious generalship,
but it lacks that other element.
But it is at the doorsteps of
Mr. Tunney's brethren of the
prize ring that the biggest bur
den of the blame must be laid.
It is difficult for intelligent peo
ple to associate themselves with
anything which smacks even to
the slightest degree, with the
brutality, and corruption of pro
fessional boxing.
Here it should be hastily said that
this is not a blanket condemnation of
the game. Gene Tunney is himself a
sterling example of what a profes
sional pugilist should be. It is no dis
credit for a man to earn a living
through physical strength and skill
any more than it is for Pavlowa to
commercialize her grace and perfect
ly trained muscles on the stage. Un
fortunately, however, Tunney's type
is not the rule, and until it is amateur
boxing will never hold a center posi
tion on the athletic stage.
The popularity of the game at
Stanford is unusual, and largely
so through the efforts of Harry
Maloney, whose unceasing work
and perfect example of fair play
and sportsmanship have been an
inspiration for all those under
him.
Harry Maloney loves the game
and knows it well. Were there a
few more like him and his friend
Gentleman Gene Tunney, boxing
would undoubtedly take an im
portant place in the world of ama
teur sport.
Some criticism has been heard
since the Stanford championship
bouts concerning the brutality of
them. That, it seems, is unjustified,
and unfair. True, the blood flowed the
other night, and some of the young
men kissed the canvas with consider
able vigor. But what of it? No perma
nent damage was done, and if we are
to protest against college boxing we
should just as loudly howl at college
football and basketball. Even in base
ball and track some of the activities
are not in accordance with oitV best
intellectual and humanitarian stand
ards. —Bob Speers.

sional fighting game have hardly
been of the type to reflect honor
on the business. Prize-fighting has
come to be looked upon in about
the same light as slugging peo
ple and robbing banks. Second,
it is human nature to appreciate
a type of co-ordination not seen
in boxing—teamwork.
Fans love to see a quarterback
wisely choose a play; they love to
see the leather oval spin out of the
center's hand. It is a thrill to observe
a crouching half speed around end
behind a smashing interference which
knocks a wide path through the op
position. Boxing has speed and action
and requires sagacious generalship,
but it lacks that other element.
But it is at the doorsteps of
Mr. Tunney's brethren of the
prize ring that the biggest bur
den of the blame must be laid.
It is difficult for intelligent peo
ple to associate themselves with
anything which smacks even to
the slightest degree, with the
brutality, and corruption of pro
fessional boxing.
Here it should be hastily said that
this is not a blanket condemnation of
the game. Gene Tunney is himself a
sterling example of what a profes
sional pugilist should be. It is no dis
credit for a man to earn a living
through physical strength and skill
any more than it is for Pavlowa to
commercialize her grace and perfect
ly trained muscles on the stage. Un
fortunately, however, Tunney's type
is not the rule, and until it is amateur
boxing will never hold a center posi
tion on the athletic stage.
The popularity of the game at
Stanford is unusual, and largely
so through the efforts of Harry
Maloney, whose unceasing work
and perfect example of fair play
and sportsmanship have been an
inspiration for all those under
him.
Harry Maloney loves the game
and knows it well. Were there a
few more like him and his friend
Gentleman Gene Tunney, boxing
would undoubtedly take an im
portant place in the world of ama
teur sport.
Some criticism has been heard
since the Stanford championship
bouts concerning the brutality of
them. That, it seems, is unjustified,
and unfair. True, the blood flowed the
other night, and some of the young
men kissed the canvas with consider
able vigor. But what of it? No perma
nent damage was done, and if we are
to protest against college boxing we
should just as loudly howl at college
football and basketball. Even in base
ball and track some of the activities
are not in accordance with oitV best
intellectual and humanitarian stand
ards. —Bob Speers.
Stanford's recent boxing tourney
brings to mind the question asked by
Gene Tunney when he visited the
campus last year. Why, the champion
pugilist demanded, is it that in col
lege the manly art of self defense
must take a back seat to most other
sports?
Although the big crowd which
turned out for the bouts last
month seems to indicate that box
ing is becoming more and more
popular at Stanford, it remains
that Mr. Tunney's inquiry is jus
tified.
The fact that boxing is rated as a
minor sport here and at other univer
sities, shows in itself that it doesn't
exist on a par with football, basket
ball, baseball, or track. Just why is
the question.
Tunney presented some very valid
arguments for the game. He pointed
out that it appeals to the cave man
instinct as well as football or any of
the others, fie showed that speed,
action, strength, quick-thinking, and
grace are required in boxing more
than in any other sport. It develops
courage, self-reliance, and an instinct
for fair play.
Why then, is it relegated to the
athletic background in college?
There are at least two good an
swers. First, some of Mr. Tun
ney's colleagues in the profes
sional fighting game have hardly
