# GRADE RECORD SHOWS HIGH RATING IN WOMEN'S SPORTS
## Brains, Athletic Ability of Women Top Those of Men During Four-Year Period; Women's "S" Society Stands Third in Ninety-Eight Groups 
### Barbara Dewlaney 
Brains and athletic skill go hand in
hand with Stanford women as they do
not with Cardinal athletes, according to
a survey based on University scholarship
ratings compiled by the Scholarship Com
mittee.
Over a period of four years the women
athletes have proved better scholars than
men athletes, ranking, as a rule, in the
upper quarter of the rating whereas the
athletic men place in the lower half of the
list.
Women Rank High
Feminine wearers of the 'S" who are
Women's "S" Society members ranked
third out of 98 organizations in the
scholarship rating for 1926-27. Far out
distancing the University scholarship av
erage for the year, these women are third
only to Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Lambda
Upsilon, chemistry honor society.

Freshman teams both head and end the
men's athletic scholarship list, the babes'
tennis team ranking highest and their
football group lowest for the past year.
Varsity track men during a period of five
years have been listed in the upper third
of the athletic rating whereas football
men always fall in the lower half of the
list.

Nor do Stanford athletes upset the
theory that athletes usually are not in
tensely energetic scholars, since the Stan
ford athletic power during a five-year

period rests in the lower half of the
scholarship rating and always as a group
averages below the University average
scholarship for any year.

It is interesting to note that as a rule
debaters rank in the upper third of the
scholastic rating, with dramatists falling
below them into the middle of the list.

Journalists Rate High

Journalists as a group rate in the upper
half of the student organizations scholas
tic listing. Whether or not yearbook
work makes a man serious and scholarly
or that the yearbook attracts the more
scholastically inclined is open to discus
soin, but at any event in four out of five
years Quad staff members have ranked
higher in scholarship than have any other
journalists. And Chaparral members,
either because the spirit of humor carries
them far afield from study or because
producing comics is demanding on time,
hold four out of five last places in the
rating of publications.

If it wern't for Phi Beta Kappa indi
viduals, other organizations might have
a chance at first place, but Phi Betes just
have that place reserved for them year
after year and never come around to offer
it to any other group. During 1922-23 the
scholarship average for Phi Betes reached
its highest peak, dropping considerably in
1923-24. Though their average has been
on the upgrade since that time, it has
never reached the 1922-23 vecord.

Feminine wearers of the 'S" who are
Women's "S" Society members ranked
third out of 98 organizations in the
scholarship rating for 1926-27. Far out
distancing the University scholarship av
erage for the year, these women are third
only to Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Lambda
Upsilon, chemistry honor society.

Freshman teams both head and end the
men's athletic scholarship list, the babes'
tennis team ranking highest and their
football group lowest for the past year.
Varsity track men during a period of five
years have been listed in the upper third
of the athletic rating whereas football
men always fall in the lower half of the
list.

Nor do Stanford athletes upset the
theory that athletes usually are not in
tensely energetic scholars, since the Stan
ford athletic power during a five-year

period rests in the lower half of the
scholarship rating and always as a group
averages below the University average
scholarship for any year.

It is interesting to note that as a rule
debaters rank in the upper third of the
scholastic rating, with dramatists falling
below them into the middle of the list.

Journalists Rate High

Journalists as a group rate in the upper
half of the student organizations scholas
tic listing. Whether or not yearbook
work makes a man serious and scholarly
or that the yearbook attracts the more
scholastically inclined is open to discus
soin, but at any event in four out of five
years Quad staff members have ranked
higher in scholarship than have any other
journalists. And Chaparral members,
either because the spirit of humor carries
them far afield from study or because
producing comics is demanding on time,
hold four out of five last places in the
rating of publications.

If it wern't for Phi Beta Kappa indi
viduals, other organizations might have
a chance at first place, but Phi Betes just
have that place reserved for them year
after year and never come around to offer
it to any other group. During 1922-23 the
scholarship average for Phi Betes reached
its highest peak, dropping considerably in
1923-24. Though their average has been
on the upgrade since that time, it has
never reached the 1922-23 vecord.
Brains and athletic skill go hand in
hand with Stanford women as they do
not with Cardinal athletes, according to
a survey based on University scholarship
ratings compiled by the Scholarship Com
mittee.
Over a period of four years the women
athletes have proved better scholars than
