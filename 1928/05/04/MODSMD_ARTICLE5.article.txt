Sigma 23 to 5 and Sequoia I took an
easy victory from Sigma Chi 11 to 2.
Phi Sigma Kappa forfeited to Bran
ner and Delta Upsilon to Phi Kappa
Sigma. r
Despite the one-sidedness of the
score, the best-played game of the
day was that between the Phi Delts
! and Kappa Sigs. Both teams hit free
ly, the Phi Delts accounting for six
teen and their opponents for twelve.
The Kappa Sigs' failure to make good
their opportunities and to take the
breaks when they were offered were
the only reason for their ignominious
defeat.
Chuck Smalling, Phi Delt pitcher,
turned in a good record, fanning 11
men and not allowing a single walk;
while Willis Wolf, Kappa Sigma
| hurler, allowed seven.
The second game was marred by
' exceptionally poor fielding on the
part of the Sigma Chi men. who com
mitted more than ten errors during
; the five innings, many of which it
| was too difficult to record due to the
■ frequency with which they w6re
j made.
The only redeeming feature of the
j game was the excellent work of the
pitchers of both teams, each striking
; out 7 men and allowing a minimum of
walks. The fact that John Tillotson,
Sigma Chi pitcher, allowed the Hall
men 13 hits was due in part to the
inability of his teammates to get
under the long flies knocked up by
j the Sequoia players.
