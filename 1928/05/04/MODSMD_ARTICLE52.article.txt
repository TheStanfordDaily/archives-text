# SPORTS OF 1928
## These Boys Can Hit 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Among the leading appleknockers,
or onion thumpers, of the American
league at this writing are three gen
tlemen who may be classified as an
ancient veteran, a youthful veteran,
and an unknown recruit. They are,
respectfully: Ken Williams, 35-year
old outfielder of the Red Sox, who
formerly played with the Browns for
i nine straight years, and in 1915 and
'16 for Cincinnati; Goose Goslin, 26-
year-old outfielder of the Senators,
who is now in his eighth season with
Washington; and Paul Easterling,
j rookie outfielder of the Detroit Tigers,
j an unknowh busher who has relegat-
I ed the famous Bob Fothergill to a po
! sit ion on the bench.
All three of these enterprising gen
tlemen are hovering around the top
1 of the American League batting av
i erages, and Easterling had the honor
of leading them all with a mark of
j .625 when the percentages for indi
vidual batting were published in the

Sunday papers. Not only in batting
averages were these three among the
leaders, but on Tuesday last, they all
stood tied as the home run leaders
of the Ban John-pardon-me-the E. S.
j Bernard circuit.
Let's take a look at Easterling, as
; he is the newcomer among the three,
i Like Chalmer Cissell, expensive
j White Sox rookie, Easterling learned
his baseball in the uniform of Uncle
j Sam. Seattle took Paul in 1926 and
j farmed him to Bloomington last year,
where he batted .342 and made 159
hits. So Moriarty traded Ruble to
Seattle for the plump outfielder, and
| the 1928 season was scarcely a week
' old when he had become the most
j talked-of player in the league. In hit
i ting his second of three home runs
iin three successive days, Easterling
| walloped a ball clear over the center
l field bleachers in St. Louis, yards
; beyond Babe Ruth's famous drive in
! the 1926 world series. He bats and
j throws right handed.

Seattle for the plump outfielder, and

Among the leading appleknockers,
or onion thumpers, of the American
league at this writing are three gen
tlemen who may be classified as an
ancient veteran, a youthful veteran,
and an unknown recruit. They are,
respectfully: Ken Williams, 35-year
old outfielder of the Red Sox, who
formerly played with the Browns for
i nine straight years, and in 1915 and
'16 for Cincinnati; Goose Goslin, 26-
year-old outfielder of the Senators,
who is now in his eighth season with
Washington; and Paul Easterling,
j rookie outfielder of the Detroit Tigers,
j an unknowh busher who has relegat-
I ed the famous Bob Fothergill to a po
! sit ion on the bench.
All three of these enterprising gen
tlemen are hovering around the top
1 of the American League batting av
i erages, and Easterling had the honor
of leading them all with a mark of
j .625 when the percentages for indi
vidual batting were published in the

Sunday papers. Not only in batting
averages were these three among the
leaders, but on Tuesday last, they all
stood tied as the home run leaders
of the Ban John-pardon-me-the E. S.
j Bernard circuit.
Let's take a look at Easterling, as
; he is the newcomer among the three,
i Like Chalmer Cissell, expensive
j White Sox rookie, Easterling learned
his baseball in the uniform of Uncle
j Sam. Seattle took Paul in 1926 and
j farmed him to Bloomington last year,
where he batted .342 and made 159
hits. So Moriarty traded Ruble to
Seattle for the plump outfielder, and
| the 1928 season was scarcely a week
' old when he had become the most
j talked-of player in the league. In hit
i ting his second of three home runs
iin three successive days, Easterling
| walloped a ball clear over the center
l field bleachers in St. Louis, yards
; beyond Babe Ruth's famous drive in
! the 1926 world series. He bats and
j throws right handed.
