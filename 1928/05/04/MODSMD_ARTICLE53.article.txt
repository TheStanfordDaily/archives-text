# AND THEN OUR LITTLE SALLY
## 
### 
I am so excited about the baseball
game Sunday between the staff here
and the Press men. I just know it is
going to be the most thrilling game
of the season.
Of course, I really don't know much
about baseball, except that it must be
very strenuous, with everyone run
ning around in such a funny way. I
mena, it seems to me that they must
get awfully hurt when they slide!
But it really is thrilling when the
balls go way out of sight; it makes
you think of golf. And I nearly die
when the holder or catcher or some
thing or other throws his armour
away just to run backwards for a
hall when there is a net to stop it
right there.
I wish someone would tell me why
they all wear those big boxing gloves.
It must be so they won't hurt the
player when they tag him out. Just
imagine what would happen if the
men were really out! Can't you just
see them reeling around the bases
like a merry-go-round.
If I were going to play I would
want to be the pitcher. He seems to
do the most and have the most excit
ing time. I mean, he is closest to the
man with the power.
I don't understand though, how he
can possibly know what to do when
those fast halls start hitting around
him. It seems that balls would make
a player nervous.
And I get so worried about the men
who stand around watching when the

batter throws his bat. I really think
baseball is more dangerous than any
other sport because more things can
happen.
But I just know that those Press
men can't possibly win the game.
After all, they are- older and can't be
so agile, I mean with their feet.
