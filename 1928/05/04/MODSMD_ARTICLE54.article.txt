# FOSSIL IMPRINT FOUND RESEMBLING AUTO TIRE

SEATTLE, Wash., May 3—(I.P.
and U. of Wash. Daily)— Automobiles
600,000,000 years before the time of
man ?
A visit to the Geological laboratory
in Science Hall at the University of
Washington would seem to prove so,
for a plaster cast taken from an an
cient fossil shows a perfect imprint
of a Goodrich Silvertown cord.
Automobile firms will never get to
use this choice hit of valuable adver
tising, however, because the mark
was made by a gigantic worm ages
ago.
