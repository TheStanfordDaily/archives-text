### Fowell Ball 
(United Squeeze Correspondent)
Advancing like the mighty Roman legions of old, multitudes
of Pacific Coast sport enthusiasts are heading for the Stan
ford Varsity Diamond to view the greatest baseball spec
tacle of the age when the Daily nine and the University
Press team clash in their annual classic at 10 o'clock Sun-

day morning. Two weeks of intensive practice have put both aggregations
into championship form and they may be expected to stage one of the finest
exhibitions of the game since the inception of the Amer-

ican National Sport.
Both teams are out for victory—the Daily outfit to
avenge the 10 to 3 defeat administered by the inkslingers
last year, and the Pressmen to add another slug to their
long galley of impressive wins.
Formidable line-ups have been assembled by man
agers of both teams. Fences will be moved back to pre
vent home-runs from becoming a monotonous repetition,

and the fielders are expected to be equipped with bicycles to chase long
drives.

* Peerless Pitchers
Len Mayrhofer, who will take the
mound for the Press, has played in Ca
nadian leagues and is ambidextrous at
bat as well as in the pitcher's box. Carl
Winquist, a freshman, will pitch for the

scribes. Don Oswill will catch the cannon
balls delivered by Winquist. Don War
ren will be the man behind the batter for
the Press team.
Jim Frank, Milt Silverman, and "Jay"
Gould will cover first, second, and third
sacks respectively for the Daily. Cochran
will play short, while

O'Meara and Wright
will play in the pas
ture. Mansfield and
Moore will stay at i
the opposite side of '
the field. Substitutes
for the Daily are:
Hodges, Judson, Em-

try, Cumrnings, Fitz, Conn, Lynch, and
the remainder of the Daily staff.
Press Overconfident
Confidence of the Pressmen may cause
them to be crestfallen after the game, for

they will have to rise
to the heights to de
feat the journalists
this year. Line-up of
Carl Oliver's Press
nine is as follows:
Eddie La Frank, If ;
Ted Uriell, lb;

Dutch Wilhelmy, cf; Ellison Hamlet, ss;
Ernie Hipp 3b; Red Furbush, 2b; Carl
Schmidt or Gene Whitten, cf; Don War
ren, c; and Lenny Mayerhofer, pitch.
Substitutes will be Bartmess and Sulli
van. Charley (Doc) Wegner is the train
er for the printers.
Astrid Arnoldson, batboy, said yester-

day that there has been so much mud
slinging that baths will be in order be
fore any public appearance can be made
by the players.
Silence Impressive
Both Claude Conn, manager, and Frank
Baker, editor, refused to speak on the

chances for the Daily team to win Sun
day's game. "I cannot editorialize now,"
was Baker's noncommittal statement.

Advancing like the mighty Roman legions of old, multitudes
of Pacific Coast sport enthusiasts are heading for the Stan
ford Varsity Diamond to view the greatest baseball spec
tacle of the age when the Daily nine and the University
Press team clash in their annual classic at 10 o'clock Sun-

day morning. Two weeks of intensive practice have put both aggregations
into championship form and they may be expected to stage one of the finest
exhibitions of the game since the inception of the Amer-

ican National Sport.
Both teams are out for victory—the Daily outfit to
avenge the 10 to 3 defeat administered by the inkslingers
last year, and the Pressmen to add another slug to their
long galley of impressive wins.
Formidable line-ups have been assembled by man
agers of both teams. Fences will be moved back to pre
vent home-runs from becoming a monotonous repetition,

and the fielders are expected to be equipped with bicycles to chase long
drives.

* Peerless Pitchers
Len Mayrhofer, who will take the
mound for the Press, has played in Ca
nadian leagues and is ambidextrous at
bat as well as in the pitcher's box. Carl
Winquist, a freshman, will pitch for the

scribes. Don Oswill will catch the cannon
balls delivered by Winquist. Don War
ren will be the man behind the batter for
the Press team.
Jim Frank, Milt Silverman, and "Jay"
Gould will cover first, second, and third
sacks respectively for the Daily. Cochran
will play short, while

O'Meara and Wright
will play in the pas
ture. Mansfield and
Moore will stay at i
the opposite side of '
the field. Substitutes
for the Daily are:
Hodges, Judson, Em-

try, Cumrnings, Fitz, Conn, Lynch, and
the remainder of the Daily staff.
Press Overconfident
Confidence of the Pressmen may cause
them to be crestfallen after the game, for

they will have to rise
to the heights to de
feat the journalists
this year. Line-up of
Carl Oliver's Press
nine is as follows:
Eddie La Frank, If ;
Ted Uriell, lb;

Dutch Wilhelmy, cf; Ellison Hamlet, ss;
Ernie Hipp 3b; Red Furbush, 2b; Carl
Schmidt or Gene Whitten, cf; Don War
ren, c; and Lenny Mayerhofer, pitch.
Substitutes will be Bartmess and Sulli
van. Charley (Doc) Wegner is the train
er for the printers.
Astrid Arnoldson, batboy, said yester-

day that there has been so much mud
slinging that baths will be in order be
fore any public appearance can be made
by the players.
