WASHINGTON, D.C., May 3. —
(U.P.) —Preparations going on to assist
Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh indicate
that his contemplated flight to Europe by
way of Greenland will be probably or
ganized in contrast to his single-handed
flight to Paris a year ago.
Commander Philip Van Horn Wcems,
navy navigation expert, has been given
a month's leave to work with Lindbergh,
the Navy Department announced. He
will instruct Lindbergh in certain quick
methods of solving navigation problems.
Other preparations are going on in at
least half a dozen quarters fully bearing
out exclusive United Press dispatches
several weeks ago about Lindbergh's
plans.
The Danish government, the U.S.
Weather Bureau, other governmental
agencies, individual airmen, and many
private organizations possessing informa
tion regarding meteorological and other
flying conditions in Greenland and Ice
land are co-operating. Results of the
Michigan University studies in Green
land are being used.

Henry Ford, before he left London,
told friends that "Lindbergh was joining
up with us," adding that the flyer would
soon be using a Ford three-motored
plane. This confirms another United
Press dispatch of this week.

Lindbergh is expected to fly from St.
John's, Newfoundand, possibly stopping
in Labrador and again at Greenland and
Iceland.
