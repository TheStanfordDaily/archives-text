Interest was expressed tonight in a
letter regarding Herbert Hoover, which
was written in December, 1904, by Pro
fessor W. R. Dudley of Stanford Univer
| sity to his nephew, Samuel W. Dudley,
then instructor and now Professor of
Mechanical Engineering in the Sheffield
| Scientific School at Yale. The letter'
reads:
"My dear Sam:
"What makes a successful man is not
to be foretold, as you say. H. C. Hoover,
the most successful Stanford graduate in
mining engineering, was chiefly noted as
; a student for the clear-headed clean way
in which, as treasurer of the student body,
lie set their finances on a sound basis
j after they had become a muddle and a
! scandal through the work of either stu
dent knaves or fools.
"But he proved later to have remark
able judgment, and excellent practical
knowledge of his specialty, until he began 1
to draw $10,000 then $25,000 salaries from
English companies in Australia and

I China. He saw where he could make
!; good mining investments which increased
( his income.
"He became a member of a firm of
three mining experts, advisers, and man
agers in London. One member of this
, firm defaulted last year for $800,000. The
other members were not liable. But Hoo-
I ver, in order to save the credit of the
' firm and prevent losses to patrons, threw
into the breach practically his whole for
tune of $750,000 and you can imagine
business honor of this kind was not lost
on the English and in the end he will
recover through great fees all he lost and
more.
"Hoover graduated in 1895 and is not
much over 30 years old. So you see a
fortune is not always acquired by crowd
ing others to the wall. The latter is done
by the great millionaires and the little
and uneducated pirates in banking, trade,
and speculation.
"Between there is a field, for the edu
.
cated engineer of high standards, that is
i highly honorable and lucrative.

Interest was expressed tonight in a
letter regarding Herbert Hoover, which
was written in December, 1904, by Pro
fessor W. R. Dudley of Stanford Univer
| sity to his nephew, Samuel W. Dudley,
then instructor and now Professor of
Mechanical Engineering in the Sheffield
| Scientific School at Yale. The letter'
reads:
"My dear Sam:
"What makes a successful man is not
to be foretold, as you say. H. C. Hoover,
the most successful Stanford graduate in
mining engineering, was chiefly noted as
; a student for the clear-headed clean way
in which, as treasurer of the student body,
lie set their finances on a sound basis
j after they had become a muddle and a
! scandal through the work of either stu
dent knaves or fools.
"But he proved later to have remark
able judgment, and excellent practical
knowledge of his specialty, until he began 1
to draw $10,000 then $25,000 salaries from
English companies in Australia and

I China. He saw where he could make
!; good mining investments which increased
( his income.
"He became a member of a firm of
three mining experts, advisers, and man
agers in London. One member of this
, firm defaulted last year for $800,000. The

I ver, in order to save the credit of the
