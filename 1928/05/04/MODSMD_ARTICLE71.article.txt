# MEXICAN GOVERNMENT PUBLISHES OWN BOOKS IN NATIONAL LIBRARY
## 
### 
"All the modern libraries in Mexico j
are being developed by the national
government there, entirely unaided
by any private financial interests," ;
said Nathan Van Patten, director of
Stanford Libraries, who has just re- j
turned from the Second Annual Con- i
ference of Mexican Librarians in \
Mexico City. "The most unique fea- j
ture of this movement is that the ■
Mexican Government published its j
own books for use in its libraries, j
The books are not for sale. This sys- |
tem provides uniform editions for all
the governmental libraries and facili
tates replacement.
"The Mexican National Library is
housed in an old building that was
formerly used as a convent. It con
tains some 700,000 volumes which
are largely uncatalogued," he said.
"There are only two modern library
buildings in Mexico. One is called the
Cervantes Library in honor of the
famous Spanish writer and author of
"Don Quixote." The other is named
after Abraham Lincoln and contains
a fair collection of English books and
reading material. All the other li
j braries are established in old houses
; that were once used as churches or!
convents.
"It is likely," Van Patten holds,!
j "that there are many old and rare j
volumes of Spanish and English
printing hidden away in some forgot
ten room of one of these old li- j
braries." He bases this opinion on the '
fact that Mexico was the original
home of printing in the Western j
world, books having been printed
there as early as the sixteenth cen- i
tury.
