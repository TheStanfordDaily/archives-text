i clared a university professor here re

"Love and all of the emotions are in
; dications that the person is faced with a
| conflict which he is atempting to adjust
j As time goes on, love disappears when the
conflict is resolved," he stated. He char
acterized love as a temporary state result
ing from inexperience or the inability of
a person to resolve a number of factors,
pointing out that jealousy and anger are
the natural results of this inability to
adjust one's self to the situation.
Later in life, the professor stated, peo

fully adjusted to life situations and as a
result do not fall in love.
He declared that recent newspaper
stories which said people over thirty are
unable to love are in a large measure sub
stantiated by scientific theories.
