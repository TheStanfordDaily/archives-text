An Easy Way to Save
Saving money through the medium of a checking account is a distinct
advantage that can be enjoyed by commercial depositors of the
American Trust Company. The Self-Regulating Savings Account plan,
which enables the commercial depositor to earn four per cent interest,
compounded semi-annually, on his surplus funds, is an exceptionally
easy way to save money. The Bank of Palo Alto Branch of the
American Trust Company will be glad to explain fully the merits of
Self-Regulating Savings Accounts.
