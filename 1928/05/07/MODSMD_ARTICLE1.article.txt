### 
Monday, May 14, has been set for
the date of the Stanford Convalescent
Home Drive by Baylor Brooks, chair
man of the A.S.S.U. Drive. Announce
ment of the various committees to
carry on the work of the drive has

Davidson, chairman of the women's
division of the drive. Labor Day will
be Wednesday, May 16.
Two thousand dollars has been set
as the quota to be raised from the
men of the University, while the wo
men plan to raise at least $1500. The
total local subscription to come from
this district is $7000, half of which

Three Sources of Income
The income of the Stanford Con
valescent Home comes from three
sources. The interest on the General
Endowment which is the income on
bonds owned by the Home last year
amounted to $5400. The second source
of income is the operations receipts
which are the expenses of some of
the children paid by outside organiza
tions.
Public contributions form by far
the largest amount of the income of
the Home. Last year the donations
from individuals, the local subscrip
tion, came to $5,861.27. The students'
part in this subscription was approxi
mately $2000. This year the students'
part will be $3500. Donations from
•organizations, and the contributions
of the Community Chests of San Jose
and San Francisco complete the third
source of income.
