# Junior Week Program Opens With Cord Ball On Thursday Afternoon
## 
### 
The class of 1929 will indulge in the
annual frolics and festivities which
constitute Junior Week, beginning to
day. A series of events has been
planned by Robert Hume, president
of the class, and the various com
mittees working under him, beginning
with the Cord Hall on Thursday after
noon, and culminating in the mirth
ful and sparkling Junior Opera of
1929.
The Cord Ball will be held in the
Women's Clubhouse from 2 to 5
o'clock on Thursday afternoon. Either
cords or corduroys are required, and
according to Robert Edgren, chair
man of the Cord Ball committee, only
clean cords will be acceptable. At
first, sight Edgren thinks this require
ment a bit stiff; at second sight he
believes it will be better for the
dance and the souls of the dancers if
cleanliness is insisted upon.
Brooks-Wort'nington will furnish
the music, and tickets will bo sold
at the door.

Friday night the Pavilion will be
transformed into a royal "salle de
danse" of the most gloriously extrava
gant king of France, Louis XIV. Ac
cording to Powell Carpenter the deco
rations will he glorious, but not too
extravagant, as college treasures
have a way of being quite open and
above-board.
The Pavilion will be a brilliant
blaze of lights, a sight that can be
visible for miles around. The corners
of the Pavilion will be covered with
rose, and blue, and purple lights
which will form an enlightening en
trance to the silver and old rose of
Louis' dancing salon.
Plan Lake Sports
Saturday morning the annual
Lake Sports Carnival will be held on
Lagunita. Tom Thurlow is arranging
the details of the swimming races. As
before noted, the Class of '29 will
finish its festivities In a fever of
finance and ticker tape, and the ro
mantic lures of "South Seas Pre
ferred."
