# Card Polo Squad Defeats Presidio In One-Sided Tilt
## Jack McDougall High Point Man of Game Friday With Nine Goals 
### 
Lieutenant Charles Whitmore's var
sity polo team out-rode, out-fought,
and out-played a team representing
the San Francisco Presidio to win a
fast game 17 to 4 on the rough Pre
sidio field Friday afternoon. The score
does not tell the whole story. At half
time, Cliauncey Thompson, Stanford
No. 4 man, went over to the oppon
ents' side and two substitutes re
placed Thompson and Weymouth to
make the game more even. Score at
half time was 15 to 1.
In fairness to the army team, it
should be explained that some of the
regular first-string men were absent
because of aerial maneuvers held
Friday. Jack McDougall, playing No.
3 for Stanford, was high-point man,
making nine goals. Bud Post, No. 2,
scored five, and Larry Weymouth
three. Captain Kilburn made three
points for the Presidio quartet.
Card Teamwork Shines
Splendid teamwork characterized
the playing of the Card quartet.
Thompson played his usual air-tight
defense at No. 4, rarely missing
back-hand strokes in stopping the
Army attack.
Post scored the first for Stan
ford soon after the beginning of the
opening chukker. A series of long
drives by McDougall and Weymouth
placed the ball in position for the !
score. Post made the second tally for
Stanford after the gong announced
the close of the period. Shortly be
fore this lie had been dismounted by
being hooked.
Stanford on Defense
The second chukker clearly showed
the Stanford advantage. The younger
men, though on a poor field and on
inferior mounts, were not once on
the defensive. McDougall scored all
five of the goals made this chukker.
The last one was knocked between
the posts after a thirty-yard drive
over the heads of the players by Wey
mouth.
Presidio scored its first goal in the
third chukker when Captain Kilburn,
No. 2, opened the period with a goal.
McDougall followed with two suc
cessive tallies. Hard riding by the
Stanford four netted another goal by
Weymouth and the period closed with
one more by the same player.
Lineups Changed
Four more points were scored by
Stanford in the fourth. McDougall
counted for two, while Post and Wey
mouth made one each. At half time,
Thompson replaced Lieutentant John
son on the opponents' team. Adolph
Levy went in at No. 4 for Stanford,
and George Connolly replaced Wey
mouth at No. 1.
The game was more even during
the last two chukkers, with Thomp
son blocking offensive attempts by
Stanford. Captin Kilburn made two
more points for the Army, and Post
made an equal number for Stanford.
Lieutenant Lewis, No. 3 on the Pre
sido team, made the only goal during
| the sixth and last chukker.
