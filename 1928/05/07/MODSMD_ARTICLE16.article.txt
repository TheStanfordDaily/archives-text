# Card Polo Squad Defeats Presidio In One-Sided Tilt
## Jack McDougall High Point Man of Game Friday With Nine Goals 
### 
Lieutenant Charles Whitmore's var
sity polo team out-rode, out-fought,
and out-played a team representing
the San Francisco Presidio to win a
fast game 17 to 4 on the rough Pre
sidio field Friday afternoon. The score
does not tell the whole story. At half
time, Cliauncey Thompson, Stanford
No. 4 man, went over to the oppon
ents' side and two substitutes re
placed Thompson and Weymouth to
make the game more even. Score at
half time was 15 to 1.
In fairness to the army team, it
should be explained that some of the
regular first-string men were absent
because of aerial maneuvers held
Friday. Jack McDougall, playing No.
3 for Stanford, was high-point man,
making nine goals. Bud Post, No. 2,
scored five, and Larry Weymouth
three. Captain Kilburn made three
points for the Presidio quartet.
Card Teamwork Shines
Splendid teamwork characterized
the playing of the Card quartet.
Thompson played his usual air-tight
defense at No. 4, rarely missing
back-hand strokes in stopping the
Army attack.
Post scored the first for Stan
ford soon after the beginning of the
opening chukker. A series of long
drives by McDougall and Weymouth
