# Daily Baseball Team Drops Close Contest To Press; Score 15-4
## Errors, Disputes, Hard Hits Mark Grudge Fiasco On Varsity Field 
### Fowell Ball 
In a meeting on the varsity dia
mond yesterday morning, on the field
of many another gory battle, the
great American game of baseball was
given its annual journalistic interpre
tation when the husky Daily team did
fair battle with the Pride of the
Pressroom.
Incidentally, the Press nine sneak
ed over fifteen runs during the seven
or so innings to take a hair's-breadth
victory, 15 to 4. From the Daily stand
point, the entire game may be con
sidered a typographical error.
Gore Is Shed
"Butch" Hamlet began the disperse
ment of gore for the Press. In the
first inning he singled, advanced on
ITriell's hit, and scored on Whitten's
long hit to shortstop. Three runs
came trickling ocer the plate that in
ning, which slightly clouded the effect
of the Daily's lone tally.
The journalists, however, regained
their much-advertised prestige in the
next frame, smashing out three runs
with three beautiful hits, not count
ing the . errors. The Press men,
though, made four.
The printers, after recovering from
the ill effects of the "bean ball" ap
plied in the first two innings, came
back in the third and fanned in great
style. But so did the Daily batsmen.
Gould, excruciating lead-off man for
the journalists, poked out his second
hit in the fourth inning. Due to some
slight omission here on the part of
the scorekeeper (who was undoubted
ly in the pay of the Press) it is im
possible to learn what happened dur
ing the rest of the inning.
Mayerhofer, foxy flinger for the
Press, had his thumb bearing down
right well from then until lunch time.
Winquist, daily hurler, pitched great
ball, but so dazzled were his oppos
ing batters that they refused to come
near the plate and get strikes called
on them —all except Wilhelmy—he
knocked two home runs.
Appleby and Hamlet umpired the
game.
