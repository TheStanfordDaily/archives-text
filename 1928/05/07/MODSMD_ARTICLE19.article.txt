# GOD HOLDS POSITION OF GOOD FATHER-GARDNER
## 
### 
"God is not a dreadful policeman
nor an angry juuge. God occupies the
same relation to humanity that a
good father holds to his family," said
Dr. Gardner yesterday in his sermon
at the Memorial Church.
"Christianity is the most encour
aging, the most joyous, the least re
pressive and the least forbidding of
all the religions of mankind. There
is no religion that gives so large a
scope for the high spirit of the soul."
The theme of the sermon was that
moral evil is not a curse but some
thing inherent in the evolution of
man's nature.
