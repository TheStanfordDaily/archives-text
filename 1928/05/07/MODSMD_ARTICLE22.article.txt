# TREAT'S LECTURE ON CHINA AT ALPHA PHI HOUSE ENDS COURSE
## 
### 
Professor Payson J. Treat gave a
lecture last night at the Alpha Phi
House, completing his course on the
Far East from last quarter. He cov
ered conditions in modern China from
the beginning of the Nationalist party
to the latest authentic reports.
The unsettled conditions in China,
said Professor Treat, are the inevi
table result of the combined revolu
tions in the industrial, intellectual,
and political fields. These disrupting
forces came upon China just at the
moment when the stabilizing influ
ences of the monarchy and class of
scholars were discredited.
Professor Treat expressed his opin
ion of those who attended by saying
that he had never known the Stan
ford intellectual animal to pursue his
studies on a moonlight Sunday night
in May.
