# The 						Independent Study Plan
## 
### 
"There is now more interest in the Independent Study Plan than
there was three years ago when it was introduced," declares Professor
Edgar E. Robinson, of the History Department, who, in the absence of
Professor A. L. Guerard, is chairman of the committee administrating
the plan.
That statement hardly seems true, according to our observation.
Seldom does one hear the Independent Study Plan mentioned, even on
Registration Day; while three years ago, when discussion of the idea
was everywhere being made, there was much talk and fervent approval
of the institution on the part of the students, who at the time felt they
were human diaphragms, ever destined to listen to lectures, without being
permitted to expand and broaden (whatever that means).
Then the I. S. P., as they efficiently refer to it in the Registrar's
Office, was inaugurated. But hardly any knocked at the door wishing
to be admitted. Now, with a capacity for taking care of twenty-five
students, the committee has less than half that number under its super
vision. Ideally, there ought to be seventy-five or a hundred applying
each year to study under the plan.
Perhaps the reason for the ungratifying response to a system which
attracted so much enthusiasm when conceived is the fear of having to
do more work than under the lecture system. The spirit is willing in
many students, but the flesh weak.
In answer to this objection, Professor Robinson asserts that the
Independent Study Plan is not designed to foster research work at all,
but has as its object the broadening of intellectual interest by giving the
student time to cover that ground in which he is most interesed.
For example, Professor Robinson suggested to one man that he spend
an entire month in reading, then devote two weeks wholly to the practice
of dropping in on courses. There is, in fact, an infinite number of ways
in which one's program of independent study may be arranged, and so
well can it be fitted to the student's temperament and needs, that it seems
as if many whose upper division years are devoted to the pursuit of
letters particularly would want to work on their own.
The Independent Study Plan "requires a higher type of thinking and
more self-direction than work in courses," Professor Robinson says.
Who of hose who have "B" averages or better does not think himself
capable of such a higher type of thinking? Why not, by doing self
directed work, avoid waste of countless hours in tedious lectures scarcely
worth listening to? The plan allows the student to take considerable
work in courses —whatever he thinks worth while; for the rest, he can
dispense with the lecturer and rely on himself and the intermittent counsel
of a professor.
It would be very advisable, we think, for every student whose grades
are good, to consult the head of his chosen major department upon com
pletion of the lower division, or indeed sooner, as to whether he would
do well to work independently. Everyone who is half a scholar ought at
least to consider taking advantage of this.
The professors might on their part encourage interest by recommend
ing the work of those they believe would benefit by it. Both professors
and students are failing to realize the full usefulness of the plan for
independent study.

least to consider taking advantage of this.
The professors might on their part encourage interest by recommend
ing the work of those they believe would benefit by it. Both professors
and students are failing to realize the full usefulness of the plan for
independent study.
"There is now more interest in the Independent Study Plan than
there was three years ago when it was introduced," declares Professor
Edgar E. Robinson, of the History Department, who, in the absence of
Professor A. L. Guerard, is chairman of the committee administrating
the plan.
That statement hardly seems true, according to our observation.
Seldom does one hear the Independent Study Plan mentioned, even on
Registration Day; while three years ago, when discussion of the idea
was everywhere being made, there was much talk and fervent approval
of the institution on the part of the students, who at the time felt they
were human diaphragms, ever destined to listen to lectures, without being
permitted to expand and broaden (whatever that means).
Then the I. S. P., as they efficiently refer to it in the Registrar's
Office, was inaugurated. But hardly any knocked at the door wishing
to be admitted. Now, with a capacity for taking care of twenty-five
students, the committee has less than half that number under its super
vision. Ideally, there ought to be seventy-five or a hundred applying
each year to study under the plan.
Perhaps the reason for the ungratifying response to a system which
attracted so much enthusiasm when conceived is the fear of having to
do more work than under the lecture system. The spirit is willing in
many students, but the flesh weak.
In answer to this objection, Professor Robinson asserts that the
Independent Study Plan is not designed to foster research work at all,
but has as its object the broadening of intellectual interest by giving the
student time to cover that ground in which he is most interesed.
For example, Professor Robinson suggested to one man that he spend
an entire month in reading, then devote two weeks wholly to the practice
of dropping in on courses. There is, in fact, an infinite number of ways
in which one's program of independent study may be arranged, and so
well can it be fitted to the student's temperament and needs, that it seems
as if many whose upper division years are devoted to the pursuit of
letters particularly would want to work on their own.
The Independent Study Plan "requires a higher type of thinking and
more self-direction than work in courses," Professor Robinson says.
Who of hose who have "B" averages or better does not think himself
capable of such a higher type of thinking? Why not, by doing self
directed work, avoid waste of countless hours in tedious lectures scarcely
worth listening to? The plan allows the student to take considerable
work in courses —whatever he thinks worth while; for the rest, he can
dispense with the lecturer and rely on himself and the intermittent counsel
of a professor.
It would be very advisable, we think, for every student whose grades
are good, to consult the head of his chosen major department upon com
pletion of the lower division, or indeed sooner, as to whether he would
do well to work independently. Everyone who is half a scholar ought at
least to consider taking advantage of this.
