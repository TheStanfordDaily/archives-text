Everyone dislikes slovenliness. The student tradition on the campus
fortunately is recognizing this, and no longer is the engineer, reeking with
a quarter's dirt collected by his clothing, looked upon as an exemplary

week an Associated Press story on Paris fashions, run in the
San Francisco Chronicle, included a pun either consciously or uncon
