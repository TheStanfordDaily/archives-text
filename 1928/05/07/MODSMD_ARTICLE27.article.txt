THE BILL LINGERS ON.
THE PARTY—IT'S ALL OVER
Rushing is over. Before the fatigue
wears off and the whole affair is
relegated to the shelf until another
year, a few conclusions, made in the
spirit of friendliest criticism, might
be in order.
Two rather obvious defects exist
in the present system. Namely:
It costs too much money.
The rushing season is too long.
We will consider only the monetary
side of the party. Somewhere in the
neighborhood of 650 men live on the
Row. There were fifteen rushing days
in the period just closed, with a total
of five hours of rushing per day. Add
to this another hour for rushing meet
ing. Subtract the two hours which
would normally be spent with the
noon and evening meal, and subtract
a third hour to cover the absence of
those who for one reason or another
could not be on deck all the time.
The Monetary Side
This leaves three hours a day rush
ing per man, which we think is a fair
and, if anything, overly-modest total.
Disregarding the additional time al
lowed on the last day of rushing, we
get 45 hours as the minimum rushing
time per man for the fifteen-day
period. This multiplied by 650 gives
the rather staggering figure of 29,250

as the total number of hours spent
by the fraternities in rushing. When
the large amount of time which must
be spent in pre-season rushing is con
sidered, the total above does not tell
the full story.
Bill Very High
A monetary value must be given
to this time, and, again seeking mini
mum figures, we set seventy-five
cents per hour as the value of a col
lege man's time. This might be raised,
but we can see no justification for any
smaller valuation. At 75c per hour,
29,250 hours are worth on paper
$21,937. To this must be added the
actual financial outlay for rushing.
It is difficult to find out just how
much rushing costs each house,
though from figures we have on hand
the amount might be set at $250 and
not be far off. Thus, adding $6,000 as
the total cost for the twenty-four
houses, the bill climbs to $27,937 for
its grand total. Counting the men al
ready pledged and those who will
probably pledge this week, we select
230 as the approximate total of
pledges. The cost then per pledge is
$121.46!
Suggestions Are Needed
All of this is too much. Surely some
better and less expensive system can
be devised.
Suggestions are in order.

much rushing costs each house,
though from figures we have on hand
the amount might be set at $250 and
not be far off. Thus, adding $6,000 as
the total cost for the twenty-four
houses, the bill climbs to $27,937 for
its grand total. Counting the men al
ready pledged and those who will
probably pledge this week, we select
230 as the approximate total of
pledges. The cost then per pledge is
$121.46!
Suggestions Are Needed
All of this is too much. Surely some
better and less expensive system can
be devised.
Suggestions are in order.

THE BILL LINGERS ON.
THE PARTY—IT'S ALL OVER
Rushing is over. Before the fatigue
wears off and the whole affair is
relegated to the shelf until another
year, a few conclusions, made in the
spirit of friendliest criticism, might
be in order.
Two rather obvious defects exist
in the present system. Namely:
It costs too much money.
The rushing season is too long.
We will consider only the monetary
side of the party. Somewhere in the
neighborhood of 650 men live on the
Row. There were fifteen rushing days
in the period just closed, with a total
of five hours of rushing per day. Add
to this another hour for rushing meet
ing. Subtract the two hours which
would normally be spent with the
noon and evening meal, and subtract
a third hour to cover the absence of
those who for one reason or another
could not be on deck all the time.
The Monetary Side
This leaves three hours a day rush
ing per man, which we think is a fair
and, if anything, overly-modest total.
Disregarding the additional time al
lowed on the last day of rushing, we
get 45 hours as the minimum rushing
time per man for the fifteen-day
period. This multiplied by 650 gives
the rather staggering figure of 29,250

as the total number of hours spent
by the fraternities in rushing. When
the large amount of time which must
be spent in pre-season rushing is con
sidered, the total above does not tell
the full story.
Bill Very High
A monetary value must be given
to this time, and, again seeking mini
mum figures, we set seventy-five
cents per hour as the value of a col
lege man's time. This might be raised,
but we can see no justification for any
smaller valuation. At 75c per hour,
29,250 hours are worth on paper
$21,937. To this must be added the
actual financial outlay for rushing.
It is difficult to find out just how
much rushing costs each house,
though from figures we have on hand
the amount might be set at $250 and
not be far off. Thus, adding $6,000 as
the total cost for the twenty-four
houses, the bill climbs to $27,937 for
