"Strangers and Lovers," by Edwin
Granberry. Macaulay Co.
This new novel is every bit as en
joyable as the spring weather, and
a very good story for the tired col
legian. If, like us, you are bored alike
by the pessimism of the "realistic"
school and the commonplaeeness of
the romanticists, you'll appreciate
"Strangers and Lovers" which dresses
up "a slice of life" in very charming
clothes. It is the story of a "poor
white" girl living alone with her
father on a barren strip of Florida
wasteland. Mr. Granberry does not
concern us with psychological analy
ses of the characters, but lets them
speak for themselves. They are ordi
nary people who do everyday things,
but the author has a knack for choos
ing remarkably euphonious words,
and has an original style that loses
none of its attractiveness through its
directness.
We discovered no particular moral
to the book —for which we are duly
thankful! —and we are a little uncer
tain as to the title's bearing on the
story; but we do know that we liked
it as well as anything we've read this
year. The plot is concerned with
Millie Carver, a girl in her 'teens,
who never once thinks of getting
away from the backwoods. Barefoot,
beautiful, and totally lacking in any
formal education, she resignedly takes
things as they come. Many villains
pursue her, but they are all foiled at
the critical moments by hurricanes,
Florida mobs, and such "nick o' time"
girl-savers.
The publishers are advertising the
book as "a story of adolescence, love,
and marriage, shot through with trag
edy, lust, joy, and hardship, but pre
sented so simply and sympathetically
that it is close to the earth and to
the warm life of human beings." We
may add that for once we really agree
with the blurb on the cover, and that
the novel is distinguished by its vi
tality and splendid characterization.
Mr. Granberry's description of the
luxurious Florida wilderness is noth
ing less than eloquent, and yet he is
clever enough to be concise and never
wanders off on long-winded details.
We have never heard of him before,
we confess, but understand that he is
a young man. He is so straightfor
ward and wastes so few words in
getting his points across that we
know he must realize how busy the

present age is, and what little time it
has to pore through complex entan
glements. His style rather resembles
Willa Gather's.
We highly recommend "Strangers
and Lovers" for spring reading—it is
serious enough to make one think
and light enough to take up to Lagu
nita Sunday afternoon.
