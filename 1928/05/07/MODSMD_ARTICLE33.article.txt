# SPORTS OF 1928
## Fred's Big Year 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
j Funny fellow, this Fred "Firpo"
Marberry, who in the last four years
has worked in 225 ball games as a
pitcher and pitched only eleven com
plete contests in those four seasons.
Tall, dark, weighing 200 pounds,
; "Firpo" has all the makings of a Wal
ter Johnson or a "Matty," yet for four
long lean years he has sat in the bull
pen until Manager Bucky Harris
sent out an "5.0.5." Then he would
go in to try to retrieve a lost cause,
or to save a game about to be thrown
into the defeat column by a wabbly
j team-mate.
Now it appears that Fred the Firp'
lis about to come into his own. With
' Sir Walter gone, Marberry seems
destined to be one of the star hurlers
of the American League in 1928.
Certainly he will do more than relief
duty, as his two early season vic
i tories have shown.
Marberry's record as a relief
pitcher for Washington during the
seasons 1924, '25, '26, and '27, was
1 quite remarkable. He pitched in
half a hundred games the first season,
six of them complete. In 1925 he
