### 
CONSTANTINOPLE, May 6. —
(U.P.) —Reports received here today
said an earthquake in Anatolia killed
one girl, injured many persons, com
pletely destroyed one village, and
badly damaged three other towns.

worked in 55 contests and not once
did he take the mound at the start of
his team's first inning on the field.
In 1926 he figured in 64 games, yet
only three were complete ones for
him. Last season his record shows
56 contests, only two of them com
plete.
His value to his team was far
greater than the mere forty games
he received credit for winning dur
ing those four seasons. In 1924, when
Johnson was voted the most valuable
American League player, Fred came
to Sir Walter's aid on six different
occasions. He saved many a game for
other hurlers, and this year the big
Texan wants to cash in on his own
victories.
