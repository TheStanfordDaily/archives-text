# FOOTBALL MATERIAL LOOKS PROMISING IN SPRING SCRIMMAGES
## Sixteen Lettermen Out For Practice; Warner Gives Tentative Lineup 
### 
With the football squad divided into
five teams, Coach "Pop" Warner has
been putting his prospective varsity
through intensive scrimmage practice
during the past month. At present
Stanford's chances of copping the
conference title seems promising.
Sixteen out of twenty-two lettermen
| are back on the field, and those prac
tically the same men on the team
that played last fall.
The tentative lineup for the coming
season is: Captain Biff Hoffman,
fullback; Frank Wilton and Bob Sims,
halfbacks; Spud Lewis, quarterback;
Walt Heinecke, center; Don Robesky
and Dynamite Post, guards; Roland
Sellman, tackle, and Ted Harder and
Johnny Preston, ends. There is also
a wealth of material in Jack Murphy,
Frentrup, Davidson, Cook, Vincenti,
Muller, Smalling, and Vermilya.
Vacancy at Tackle
; One of the problems that is con
fronting the coaching staff is the
finding of a new man to fill out the
other tackle position vacated by Chris
Freeman. Ray Dawson, fullback on
the frosh team, has been converted
into a tackle, and seems, at present, a
, likely successor to Freeman.
Other promising men coming up
from the freshman class niclude Hill
man, Caglieri, and Winnek in the
backfield, and Pete Heiser, captain

of the 1931 frosh team, and Dick
Rogue in the line. Moffatt was ex- i
pected to shine at half but an injury
j to his shoulder, which he suffered at 1
the height of his playing on the frosh
. team, is still bothering him. Many of

last season's Grays are also seeing
active work against the first-string
team.
Football practice will continue up
to about one week before finals and
will start again on September 15.
