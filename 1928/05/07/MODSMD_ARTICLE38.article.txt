LOS ANGELES, May 6. —American
slang is the outcome of our expand
ing age, which needs more vivid
words to express meanings more
clearly, according to Dr. F. C. Blan
cliard, of U.C.L.A. Slang sltould be
depended upon to vitalize the lan
guage; the vulgar and silly parts will
he discarded, and the best will eventu
ally find its way to the dictionary.
The freshman English teachers at
Indiana University recently adopted
the plan of substituting magazines
for textbooks.
