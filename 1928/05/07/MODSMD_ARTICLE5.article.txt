# SENIORS TO COMPLETE ENDOWMENT CAMPAIGN DRIVE ON WEDNESDAY
## Class of 1928 Fund System Assures Steady Income For University 
### 
Committee members working under
Call on the Clas sof 1928 En
dowment are swinging into the last
uays of an intensive campaign to
reach all seniors who have not re
turned their pledges to the 1928 fund.
The drive will end Wednesday. Class
members are urged to subscribe to
the endowment fund by Call, chair
man of the endowment committee
handling the drive.
"When the student stops to realize
that two-thirds of his education has
been paid for by Stanford, and that
the policy of expansion which the
University contemplates cannot be
realized without funds, he can see
the necessity for ever increasing
funds at the disposal of the Trus
tees, Call said. "The endowment fund
plan, as instituted at Stanford by the
Class of 1927, and now being carried
on by the Class of 1928, is a method
whereby a regular income is assured
the University, to be used as it sees
fit for educational purposes. It pro
vides a fund immeuiately realizable
for emergency uses, in which respect
the plan is essentially different from
that used by senior classes before
1927. Then insurance was taken out
in the name of the University, which
paid a sum into the treasury after a
period of years."
