# Allardice Dies In Palo Alto After Illness Of Year
## Was Professor Emeritus of Mathematics; Came to Stanford in 1892 
### 
Robert Edgar Allardice, Professor
Emeritus of Mathematics, died at 2
o'clock yesterday morning in the
Palo Alto Hospital after a lingering
illness of over a year's duration. An
infection of the lungs was the imme
diate cause of his death. Professor
Allardice was born in Edinburgh,
Scotland, sixty-six years ago, and
leaves behind him a sister in Glas
cow.
Allardice came to Stanford at the
start of the University's second year,
in 1892. He immediately assumed the
position of head of the Mathematics
department and held that office until
'the time of his retirement a year ago.
Previous to coming here, he served
as a professor at the University of
Edinburgh, his alma mater, for ten
years. At that university he had been
a Baxter and a Drummond scholar.
He was an eminent figure in the
mathematical world and in his youth
had received several decorations for
his work in this field. His later years
were devoted almost entirely to the
establishment of the Stanford Mathe
matics department in its present en
viable position.
Definite arrangements for the fun
eral services have not yet been made,
but the ceremony will probably take
place from the chapel of Roller and
Hapgood in Palo Alto at 1:30 o'clock
tomorrow. Dr. Gardner will officiate.
