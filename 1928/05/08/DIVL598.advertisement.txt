Never Gets

Gentlemen:
J I have always wanted to smoke a
pipe. After several attempts I gave
my "taste" up, for with each trial I
got a blistered tongue.
One evening, when looking over a
certain outdoor magazine, I read that
a certain fisherman could catch more
fish when using "Edgeworth," so I
decided I would try "his" tobaccoâ€”
for I am no poor fisherman!
The next day I tried to secure Edge
worth. The local country storekeeper
did not have it, so I sent by a friend to
the city for my first Edgeworth. Two
things have happened: I still smoke
Edgeworth, and the local storekeeper
always has a supply.
I catch fish and never get "a bite"
from Edgeworth!
Yours for keeps,
H. V. Massey
