# HOLD OLYMPIC TRACK TRYOUTS HERE SATURDAY
## Varsity, Freshman Trackmen To Compete in Stadium For U.S. Finals FORTY-SEVEN ENTERED Templeton May Coach Own Men When Americans Go To Amsterdam 
### 
Forty-seven men from Coach Dink
Templeton's varsity and freshman
track teams are entered in the Olym
pic tryouts which are to be held in
the Stanford Stadium Saturday.

Lauritzen, Bradley, Dyer, and Mc-
Dermott will compete in the 100- and
200-meter events. Spencer, Morrison,
Dales, and Syer are slated to run the
400-meter race, McGuire in the 800-
meter, with Aiken and Gooden iu the
1500 meters.

To Run 5000-Meter Race
Coe, Loofbourow, and Aiken are to
run in the 5000-meter event, and Coe
will compete in the gruelling 10,000-
meter race. In the 110-meter hurdles
Nichols, Bullis, and West are entered.

Stanford's relay quartet should
have a good chance in the 1600-meter
baton-passing event. King, Austin,
French, and Madison will all compete
in the high jump, and Templeton's
famous broad-jumping duo, Dyer and
IZombro, are expected to do good
things in their event. These two will
also enter the hop-step-jump compe
tition.

Two Men in Pole Vault
Hulsman and Edmonds are entered
in the pole vault, Sparling, Joaquin,
Kibby, and Goodcell in the javelin,
and Krenz, Way, and Forster in the
discus, Rothert, Krenz, Forster,
Fleishhacker, and Way are to put the
shot, and Kazanjian will enter the
hammer throw. In the 56-pound
weight event Fleishhacker and Ka-

zanjian will compete.
Just what the Stanford contingent
â€¢will do remains to be seen. Consider
ing the strength of the Cards and the
ability of several individual stars it
seems likely that Templeton will have
some of his own hoys to coach when
lie helps train the American Olympic
optfit. In any event, the meet Satur
day will give the Stanford men some
good practice for the Eastern trip
which they are soon to make.
