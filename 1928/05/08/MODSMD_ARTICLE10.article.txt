# REST HOMES FOR STANFORD PEOPLE TO OPEN IN FALL
## DEANS APPROVE PROJECT Mothers Club To Sponsor, Finance Establishments For Students 
### 
Rest homes to provide for Stanford
students who are over-tired, or con
valescing from operations, or physi
cally below par, are to be opened on
the campus next fall quarter. There
will be separate establishments for
men and women students.

The executive board of the Mothers
Club voted at a meeting yesterday to
sponsor the financing of these homes,
which will be under immediate direc
tion of Dr. Clelia D. Mosher and Dr.
Thomas A. Storey. The board of gov
ernors from the Mothers Club will
have general supervision of both
homes. This board is composed of
Mrs. Edwin J. Thomas, chairman;
Mrs. Walter Bingham, secretary
treasurer; Mrs. A. B. Clark, Mrs. Paul
Shoup, and Mrs. Thomas A. Storey.

This project is being undertaken as
llie initial step in what it is hoped
will result in an endowed infirmary
for the University, says Mrs. Thomas.
Students receiving this care will be
charged only a nominal sum. The
Mothers Club, in promoting and spon
soring the financing of the homes,
will have charge of all contributions
to the project.

The women's home will be at 553
Salvatierra street and Mrs. L. J. Owen
will be in charge. The men will be
taken care of at the Chester Thomas
home under the management of Mrs.
S. V. Morrison.

Hearty support for the plan has
been given by Dean Yost and Dean
Culver, and it has also received the
approval of the campus medical au
thorities.
