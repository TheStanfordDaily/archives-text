# New Daily Chief May Be Chosen By Staff Vote
## Two-Thirds of Total Today In Nominating Ballot Will Elect Editor 
### 
Members of the editorial staff of
the Stanford Daily will meet at 1
o'clock this afternoon in the Daily
office to nominate and possibly elect
the next editor, whose term of office
J begins at the start of Fall Quarter
I and ends in the middle of Winter

Quarter.
Today's meeting will be held pri
marily to nominate the candidates for
the editorship, but if any one man
should receive more than two-thirds
of the total of votes cast, he will be
declared automatically elected and
j the vote would not depend on the
i student body elections as would
! otherwise be the case.

Staff members who have served for
six or more quarters will be entitled
|to two and one-half votes, those
j with three quarters of work to their
I credit will be allowed two votes, and
! the remainder will each be allowed
one vote, providing they have been
on the staff for one full quarter.
