### 
INDIANAPOLIS, May 7—(U.P.) —
With the most spirited political cam
paign Indiana has seen in recent
years at an end tonight, Herbert
Hoover faces a crucial test in his
race for the Republican presidential
nomination when the voters in Tues
day's primary choose between him
and Senator James E. Watson.

Watson, the "favorite son" candi
date, has the support of a powerful
state organization, which has backed
him actively in his appeal to the
Hoosier voters for Indiana's support
at the Kansas City convention.

Hoover will face the test of his
presidential strength in the first Mid
dle Western state where farm relief
was made a campaign issue. An
overwhelming majority despite the
fact that Watson should get a heavy
vote in the agricultural districts.

A record vote of more than a half
million voters was predicted tonight
when fair weather was forecast for
Tuesday throughout the state.

Hoover's strength undoubtedly will
come in the industrial sections. He
should carry northwestern Indiana,
and in fact the northern half of the
state should favor the Secretary of
Commerce.

Watson's followers were equally
optimistic over the chances of their
candidate to win in Indiana tomorrow
and predicted that "Watson will win
by a larger majority than that which
sent him to the Senate in 1926." He
received a majority of approximately
160,000 votes for the senatorship.
