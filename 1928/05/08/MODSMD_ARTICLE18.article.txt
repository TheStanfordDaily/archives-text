## 
### 
All chairmen and committee mem
bers for the Stanford Convalescent
Home Drive will meet this afternoon
at 1 o'clock in Room 214 to organize
the campaign for funds which will
take place next Monday, May 14. Bay
lor Brooks, chairman of the Drive,
will preside over the meeting, and
Murray Draper will outline the work
to be done in order to raise $3500,
the student quota for this year.

Committees for the Associated Wo
men Students have been announced
by Eleanor Davidson, who is direct
ing the women's division of the
Drive, and Lilian Force, who is or
ganizing the women's campaign.

Thirty-five hundred dollars has
been set as the students' goal. This
amount of money has been necessi
tated by the improvements and addi
tions that have eome to the Home in
the last year. A new isolation ward
has been added which makes it pos
sible to isolate children when they
are first admitted and thus protect
those in the Home from contagious
diseases.

This new addition, the admission
ward of the McLaughlin Unit, has
increased the capacity of the Home
from forty to forty-five children. To
meet the additional cost of caring for
five more children the income must
be increased. The part of Stanford
students in the Drive is to raise $3500
among themselves to help fill the
local subscription of $7000, and five
more children each year can regain
their health and happiness in the
sunshine of the Stanford Home.

Additional committees to complete
the organization, and the committees
that were announced yesterday, fol

all the men's ana women's living
groups to collect the money next
Monday. The A.W.S. speaker's com
mittee is given out by Lilian Force.
