What with nominations for student body officers now in full swing, and
the attendant politicians casting hats hither and thither, a few words might
be said about leadership. Dean Gauss, of Princeton, wrote an article for
the Saturday Evening Post a short time ago, entitled "Education of Lead
ers." His main point was that leadership is not the primary end of
education, and that it is the height of folly to talk about requiring leadership
of a young man entering college.
After having been harangued quite a bit by people about Princeton,
Dean Gauss amplified some of his statements, and here they are:
". . . leaders are a drug on the market. I mean of course that reputed
leaders are a drug on the academic market. Everybody who enters college
lias to be certified as a leader. They are indoctrinated with the notion from
the time they are children, and college professors and officials have unfor
tunately a very large share in the responsibility. What I wish to insist upon
is that leadership, like character, is a by-product of a purposeful life.
"It (over-stressing leadership) results in giving weaker-minded under
graduates a totally wrong perspective. They are bursting with suppressed
desires for leadership. . . . Such a leader thinks he must do something start
ling and unique. He is the type who gets up parades in order to lead them.
He has an itch to lead anything and everything, if it is only a riot.
"A leader is not a man who bosses a ward, who heads a riot or shouts
loudest in protest. Civilized communities must be governed by law and a
leader in a civilized community is one who does the same things that other
people do better than other people do them."
Merely to say that these words are applicable to the present political
pot-boiling is putting it far too simply. When men or women are being
nominated, they should be students who have shown an outstanding ability
to do the sort of job for which they are running. Politics seem to be a
necessity, but poor candidates are not.
