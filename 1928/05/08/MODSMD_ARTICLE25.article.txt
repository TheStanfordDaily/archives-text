# A 						Splendid Move
## 
### 
Stanford has never had any place within its confines or nearby where
students could go or be sent when they were in precarious health. The
Palo Alto Hospital, yes. But that is usually crowded, and oftentimes the
needs of the students are not such as to warrant a stay in the hospital for
a few days.
Now the Stanford Mothers' Club is sponsoring a move, to l>e financed
and handled by the club, which move involves providing just the sort of
care a convalescing or run-down student requires. Many times a man or
woman who is working and carrying heavy courses, or doing much in the
way of activities, finds that the load has become a bit too heavy, and
develops a minor ailment which may, if not properly attended, become
serious. It is this sort of case the Mothers' Club hopes to help.
Dr. Storey stated yesterday that he has realized the need of such a
service for some time, and heartily approves, as does Dr. Mosher. The
intention is to start this with the purpose of working into some sort of
real convalescent home, which will be a hospital, and yet not require quite
the equipment or expense the usual medical institution calls for.
Certainly this is a plan which students and parents, as well as the
University authorities, will applaud. Many are the students who would
have welcomed such a place during last quarter's session of colds and
headaches.
