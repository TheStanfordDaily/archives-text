# How Does the Other Half Live?

For the past several years there has been an effort on the part of
sociologists to get college students to take a fling at the unique experience
of being on a parity with the working man, the transient worker, or the
"down-and-outer." Three months during the summer spent in the long
lines of the unemployed or at some lesser job will give a student some
definite conception of the case and complaint of men against their fellow

men.
In line with this, a student from the University of Giicago recounts
from actual experience the feeling of being but one man among 15,000
unemployed in Detroit. He tells, in his article in a current publication,
of the sham and inadequacies of present-day employment offices.
In particular, is the unorganized state of the worker emphasized. As
a solution to the problem, the writer apparently believes in stabilized pro
duction to make the demand for labor more constant. A hint of workers'
organization coming inevitably, despite the constant opposition of employ
ers, is contained in the article. Such organizations will certainly develop
in Detroit and other industrial centers of the country, and the more men,
like this particular writer, who are prepared to deal properly and satis
factorily with that problem of the future, the less will be the rough inci
dents occurring in the evolutionary proccss.
Labor in this country has not begun to approach the status it has in
its organized form in Great Britain and on the continent. There the ob
server finds it tinged with a Red color which is not altogether absent in
this •country. To prevent the precipitation of such a movement in this
country in the coming advances of labor will demand the sympathetic
understanding of men such as the writer in question.
