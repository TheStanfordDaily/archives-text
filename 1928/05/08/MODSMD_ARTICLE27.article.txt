# Daily Election
## 
### 
All members of the editorial staff will be at the Daily office at 1
o'clock to vote for the ensuing editor.

All seniors should remember that it takes more than units and honor
points to graduate this quarter; it takes a little slip to the Registrar's office.
Today is the last day in which these little slips may be handed in.
