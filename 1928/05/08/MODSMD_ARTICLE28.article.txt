"For Love of a Sinner." Robert Gor
don Anderson. Century Co.
Messire Francois Villon has prob
ably been the butt of more historical
portraits, romances, and whatnot,
than any other representative of the j
human race. There have been re- j
markably few biographies o£ this in- |
teresting person, in contrast to the i
enormous outpourings of fiction he |
has stimllated.
This novel of Anderson's surely
does not even attempt to give an
authentic portrait of the troubadour, |
but it makes very amusing light read- j
ing. Anderson himself is too much
charmed by the romance of Villon to
write anything but a very romantic
historical story—but then, that is not
necessarily something to criticize, j
And he has done very well in one
line —the phrases are nicely turned, 1
and the book is well-written. The old 1
French atmosphere is caught neatly, j
and it is rather unique to read of the
swashbuckling thieving heroic old
liars —in smooth sentences.

Fortunately Villon's real story is
veiled in the fog of years, and we
can not depreciate Anderson's con
ception from this stand. An interest
ing but rather doubtful bit of psychol
ogy is his interpretation of Villon's
hours at the Golden Cockrel. It seems
that the poet spent his hours at this
brothel —which did have the virtue
of being the worst of its kind —with
his mind amused to exploits, but his
heart and soul soaring aboVe its
sordidness.
The book is finely imagined. The
tavern scene, particularly when the
Ballad of Legs of All Sorts, and the
song of the King, the Clown, and the
Agile Flea, are written, is pleasantly
fresh. The romantic element of this
novel makes it meat for circulating
libraries, as the title capitalizes this
quality. Incidents like the one men
tioned, however, give an amusing and
stimulating conception of the period
—like a treatment for a bronze statue,
just beginning to flake from rust.
