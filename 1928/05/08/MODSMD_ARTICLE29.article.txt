The Editor, Sir:
In answer to your editorial in this
rooming's Daily, may I be allowed to
offer an explanation for the "sloven
liness" you complain of in regard to
the removal of Dramatic Council
advertising?

The sale of tickets for Dramatic
Council productions does not end on
the day of the ordinary seat sale, but
continues throughout the week follow
ing and until the night of the play
itself. It is therefore the custom to
leave the announcements on the
classroom blackboards during this
period, rather than to erase them
at once. This is done, not merely
through carelessness, but to call the
attention of the students to the con
tinued sale.

In the matter of the signs painted
on the sidewalks, they are ordinarily
removed on the day following the
sale. However, in the case of "Caesar
and Cleopatra," an experiment was
made in using a new kind of paint;
this has proved very difficult to
erase, and we have as yet been un
able to remove it entirely.

The Dramatic Council is very
anxious to call the attention of cam
pus residents as thoroughly as pos
sible to its activities. In doing this, it
may occasionally cause criticism by
advertising its attractions too osten
tatiously. At such times we will al
ways be glad to accept such criticism
in the spirit in which it is offered, and
attempt to correct the trouble at
once. Norman Larson,
Dramatic Manager.

The Editor, Sir:
Apropos of the leading editorial on
this morning's issue, we might not
agree upon a measurement of degree

of interest in the Independent Study
Plan, but we do agree, apparently, in
a desire to encourage an interest in
its possibilities. There is at present
some discussion of the matter; let
it go at that.

To aid in explanation, the Chair
man of Committee has found it best
to have an extra office hour for the
work of the Independent Study Plan
on Friday, May 11, from 10-12, and on
Wednesday, May 16, from 10-12 and
from 2-4. (Room 172, Administration
Building.)
Very sincerely yours,
Edgar E. Robinson.

Apropos of the leading editorial on
this morning's issue, we might not
agree upon a measurement of degree

of interest in the Independent Study
Plan, but we do agree, apparently, in
a desire to encourage an interest in
its possibilities. There is at present
some discussion of the matter; let
it go at that.

To aid in explanation, the Chair
man of Committee has found it best
to have an extra office hour for the
work of the Independent Study Plan
on Friday, May 11, from 10-12, and on
Wednesday, May 16, from 10-12 and
from 2-4. (Room 172, Administration
Building.)
Very sincerely yours,
Edgar E. Robinson.
The Editor, Sir:
In answer to your editorial in this
rooming's Daily, may I be allowed to
offer an explanation for the "sloven
liness" you complain of in regard to
the removal of Dramatic Council
advertising?

The sale of tickets for Dramatic
Council productions does not end on
the day of the ordinary seat sale, but
continues throughout the week follow
ing and until the night of the play
itself. It is therefore the custom to
leave the announcements on the
classroom blackboards during this
period, rather than to erase them
at once. This is done, not merely
through carelessness, but to call the
attention of the students to the con
tinued sale.

In the matter of the signs painted
on the sidewalks, they are ordinarily
removed on the day following the
sale. However, in the case of "Caesar
and Cleopatra," an experiment was
made in using a new kind of paint;
this has proved very difficult to
erase, and we have as yet been un
able to remove it entirely.

The Dramatic Council is very
anxious to call the attention of cam
pus residents as thoroughly as pos
sible to its activities. In doing this, it
may occasionally cause criticism by
advertising its attractions too osten
tatiously. At such times we will al
ways be glad to accept such criticism
in the spirit in which it is offered, and
attempt to correct the trouble at
once. Norman Larson,
Dramatic Manager.
