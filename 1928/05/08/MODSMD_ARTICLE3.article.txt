# CHAPPIE TO REVEAL ASTOUNDING POLICY FOR RACE WELFARE
## 
### 
When Chaparral appears to
morrow readers will learn
of a new policy which the maga
zine has adopted for the better
ment of the human race. "We
have taken the lead in a far
reaching program for social good
which will sweep the country
like a broom," said Winston Nor
man, editor. "We will not an
nounce the new policy, however,
prior to sale of the May issue,
because we want it to shock the
student body and possibly the
administration."
Melvin .Tones contributes "The
Coining of Gaspard," a saga of
the North Woods, Stanford Uni
versity, and way points, which
is claimed will quicken the pulse
and sweeten the breath. "More
and Rougher Roughs" is the gist
of one editorial, while another
once more complains about the
15-mile rule on Palm Drive in
tersections.
"We are running a number of
puns which we think are mighty
funny," the editor announces,
"and if readers do not like them
the lake is filling up rapidly."
Ted Krougli drew the cover de
sign. The issue includes full-page
art features by Krough and by
Link Malmquist.
