Now that all you frosh have had
your fling at fraternity life we will
have a Cabbage "bull session" there
! on.
* * *
Of course you were so interested
in looking for your name in the
paper (perhaps your last appearance
! in the august Daily) that you didn't
read the headline —
Two Hundred Sixteen Men Pledged
To End Fraternity Rushing Period
* * *
That just goes to show that the
Freshmen were a bit bored with the
procedure too.
♦ • *
The Bull Sessioner crashed through
I with some excellent statistics on the
Rushing situation yesterday. Most
fraternity men were surprised and
flattered to find that their time was
valued at seventy-five cents an hour.
• * * *
You pledged Freshmen will no
doubt be pleased to hear that the new
brothers thought enough of you to
spend $121.46 in food, shows, parties,
and rushing "labor" charges (at 75
jcents per hour). Perhaps you will
feel yourself obligated because of the
[ great expense incurred in pinning
| the "brass" on you. Think nothing of
it- You perhaps haven't heard that
sophomores spend time at mowing
lawns, answering phone calls, waxing
floors, and general housework. After
you have paid your initiation and
"done your time" as a sophomore you
will insist that the fraternity owes
you room and board any time you
want to "drop in on the boys" for the
| next ten years.

IN MANILA THEY SAY "E-SWAN"
—Paily gingerale adv.
But back in Missouri the old farm
ers are still saying "I swan!"
