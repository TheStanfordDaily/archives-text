# SPRING SONG
## 
### 
The lake is decked in annual dedica
tion,
The slap of paddle echoes in the
air.
But what with rushing and initiation i
The smacking slap of paddle echoes '
where?

| The gun cracks and the red-clad
heroes run;
We watch from sun-warmed spot
or shady nook.
But what with all this spring-time
can we shun
The far less pleasant cracking of
a book?
MORAL
'Tis sad. This problem leadeth every

thing;
'Tis hard, for now (tra la) it's surely
spring!
—Doe Joakes.
* * •
We'll wind up with Little Tessie'*
poem which tells all about this
healthy outdoor life —
TO THE SUN
You touched my arms with golden
rays,
For that you may expect some
praise.
That would have been a fair return —
But damn it all, I got sunburn!
I've tried to get a coat of tan,
Ever since the year began.
An athlete's brown has been my
"yearn,"
But damn it all, I got sunburn!
Both poem and profanity could be
made stronger.—Sunburned Ed.
