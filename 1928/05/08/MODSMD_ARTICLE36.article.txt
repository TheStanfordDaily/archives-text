## At the Penn Relays 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The two outstanding features of the
Penn Relays, held last Friday and
Saturday at Franklin Field, Philadel
phia, under atrocious weather condi
tions, were the remarkable sprinting
of the famous Charley Paddock, of
California, and the performance in
the 3000-meter steeplechase of Har
old Keith, of Oklahoma.

Paddock, in running 175 yards in
17 2-5 seconds, set perhaps the most
phenomenal record of his long and il
lustrious career, as he not only ran in
better than even time on a track
ankle-deep in mud, but had to swerve
to one side to avoid trampling on
forty or fifty spectators, who fell onto
the side of the track where he was
running when a part of the south
wall of the stadium gave way while
the race was in progress.
Keith, who with three other Okla
homans, owes his entrance into the
steeplechase event to a misunder
standing, had never seen or heard of
such a race before last Friday, and
not only took the hurdles and the
water jump like a veteran, but out
raced some star cross-country run
ners who knew what it was all about.
Keith's winning time of 10 minutes
9 4-5 seconds is about half a minute
slower than Willie Ritola's winning
time at the Paris Olympics, but the
Oklahoma boys have gone back home
with the avowed intention of building
a steeplechase course and practicing
up on the event.
Paddock has been criticized because
he did not stop running when he saw

the wall crash about fifty yards in
front of him, and go to the assistance
of those who had fallen. He told me
after the race that his first reaction
was to stop—that the race was "off"
• —but that the pounding feet of his
competitors urged him on. Anyway,
by the time he could have slowed
down and turned around, all the fall
en spectators would have been picked
up by the many officials, athletes, and
others who lined the other side of
the track.

up on the event.
Paddock has been criticized because
he did not stop running when he saw

the wall crash about fifty yards in
front of him, and go to the assistance
of those who had fallen. He told me
after the race that his first reaction
was to stop—that the race was "off"
• —but that the pounding feet of his
competitors urged him on. Anyway,
by the time he could have slowed
down and turned around, all the fall
en spectators would have been picked
up by the many officials, athletes, and
others who lined the other side of
the track.
