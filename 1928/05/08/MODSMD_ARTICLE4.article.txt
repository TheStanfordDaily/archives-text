# ARRANGE FOR VARIETY OF STAGE SCENES IN JUNIOR PRESENTATION
## 
### 
A corner of a college campus at
night, the South Sea Islands, there
and en route, and the inside of a stock
exchange—all have their part in the
action of the Junior Opera, "South
Seas Preferred" to be given in the
Assembly Hall Saturday evening.

These represent settings for the
three acts of the play, and are being
developed by Les Kiler, art and tech
nical director for the show. The first
act is staged on the ext'-rior of a
campus ballroom, and gives oppor
tunity for some good moonlight ef
fects. The lighting will be stressed
more perhaps than the actual sets,
Kiler says.

There will be two scenes in the
second act, both with shipboard motif.
The second scene is after arrival in
the all-important South Seas, wherein
the cannibals appear as well as the
southern vampire. Time is late after
noon for this, and lighting effects
promise to be faithful to the kind of
sunsets they have in tho southern
hemisphere.

In the last act ticker tape plays
its part in a stock exchange more
impressionistic and satirized than
prosaically correct. Clever, vivid cos
tumes add color to the total effect.

For the benefit of those who were
unable to secure tickets at the regu
lar seat sale last Thursday, the re
maining tickets have again been
placed on sale at the A.S.S.U. offices
in the Old Union. Tickets which have
been ordered by members of the cast
and others are being held at tliis of
fice, and if they are not called for by
5 o'clock today will be placed on sale.
