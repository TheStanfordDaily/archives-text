# EL CAMPO VICTORIOUS, SIGMA CHIS DEFAULT IN HORSESHOE FINALS
## 
### 
El Campo defeated El Cuadro in
the first match of the final round
intramural horseshoe play yesterday.
Sequoia won on a default of Sigma
Chi. Other matches scheduled were
not played because of double defaults.

Rainey Hancock and A1 Gardner
defeated Floyd Clause and Bob ltick
lefi's by scores of 21 to 15, and 21' to
14, in two loosely played contests.
Few ringers were scored by either
team and inaccurate throws marred
the games.

In the second series Bob Hardson
and Ellsworth Jackson won from Jim
Barr and Fletcher Button after an
extra game. All three contests were
very close and were featured by many
ringers and spectacular shots. The
final scores were 21 to 20, 13 to 21,
and 21 to 17.
