"Hail! Hail!
The Gang's All
Here!"
Whether it is a baseball game or an exam knocked
for a loop, there is always some joyous occasion for
"Canada Dry." Then whoop her up with a light-fingered
jazz-artist on the ukulele and "Hail, Hail! The Gang's
All Here !" in close harmony.
"Canada Dry" has a delightful flavor . . . tang to it
. . . dryness . . . sparkle. It contains no capsicum (red
pepper). And because it contains only pure Jamaica
ginger to give it that mild, subtle taste, it blends well
with other beverages.
