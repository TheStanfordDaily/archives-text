# Cap'n Keel Falls In Love, Approves Of Goo-Goo Isles
## South Sea Island Beauty Works Wiles On Old Salt, Captivates The Captain 
### Margaret Cummings 
The old captain might know a lot
about ships and sailing, and in a fight
with the pirates he knew his stuff;
no doubt of it. But Arthur and some
|of the other collegians, whose ad
j ventures you will learn Saturday
night at "South Seas Preferred," de
cided what he knew about real life
was not as much as it should be. In
i particular he was woman-shy, and
i they proposed to remedy it.
Toya, however, exotic flower of the
south seas, was by no means man
shy. She had lots of enthusiasm, and
was not at all hard to please. Arthur
; could make the kind of love she
liked, and she even tried Bob, The
Hero and so not for her, for a little
divertissement. But it was the cap
tain, good old Captain Keel, who
formed the piece de resistance as far
1 as Toya was concerned. And the sur
prise that Arthur got . . . !
Nor was Toya the only surprise
they found on the trip to the Goo-Goo
Isles. Not all of them were as easy
to take as she either. Danger clouds
loom on the horizon, and we have a
chance to see whether the football
enthusiasts can manage a "real situa
tion."
After which . . . but that were
J to tell too much.
