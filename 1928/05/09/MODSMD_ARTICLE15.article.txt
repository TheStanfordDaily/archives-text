# JUNIORS MUST WASH CORDS TO "GET BY" AT BALL TOMORROW
## 
### 
The Cord Ball, opening Junior
Week festivities will be held from two
to five o'clock tomorrow afternoon in
the Women's Clubhouse, and the
Junior Prom, the second event, will
take place Friday night in the
Pavilion.
"Clean cords or nothing" has been
chosen/ as the slogan of the Cord Ball
by the committee in charge, so Stan
ford roughs will realize for one day
that cleanliness is the required dis
guise in which to attend a Cord Ball.
It is rumored that this dance will be
as effective as the Masque Ball in
concealing identities.
The special feature of the Junior
Prom, according to Paul Herbold, is
that none of the Juniors have to do
any of the work. This is looked on as
a delightful improvement on past
Proms before which ambitious. Jun
iors struggled and slaved until the
wee sma' hours the night before the
Prom.
