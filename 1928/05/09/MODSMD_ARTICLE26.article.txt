A young lad of eighteen summers was indicted recently for publishing
an "obscene" poem, and sentenced to three years in the New York City
Reformatory. He did not like some of the institutions in these United
States and said so. We have not read the poem but we may take the
attitude that it was most obscene and most undesirable. Does this justify
the court for taking a third degree attitude toward the youth? Justice
Healy said, in sentencing David Gordon, "It is too bad we cannot sentence
you to Russia. You would get a good soul-pulling of what they are
handing out to people of your kind."
A fine remark to make to a student of the University of Wisconsin,
who had been able to enter the college on a Zona Gale scholarship, a
student who had spent fifteen of his eighteen years in this country and
seems to have found only the wrong side. Perhaps the justice forgets that
once he himself was young and cared a little about some of the things
that didn't seem just right. At any rate such an attitude is not the kind that
is going to make a foreign-born American feel any more kind toward the
institutions he does not understand.
As to the legal aspects of the case not much can be said. The poem
was written for the Daily Worker, and circulated. The laws on such matter
running through the mails, the court probably is quite competent to quote.
But this doesn't excuse their methods. On cross-examination Justice
Voorhees shot out at Gordon, "What do you mean by writing such stuff?
Get down to that." Then all the judges began to thunder questions at him.
Gordon tried to say something; he started, "The idea is a copy of Bernard
Shaw. Bernard Shaw once said . . ."
Then Healy jumped into the fray and answered, "You are a plagiarist
besides?" Such a conclusion, if it can be called such, is not merely silly,
it is wholly asinine. When a judge can sit and make such remarks, one
can almost see an excuse for the "obscene" poetry alleged to have been
written by this young man.
In commenting on the case, Heywood Broun has made some apt state
ments. lie says: "His [speaking of Gordon] poem was crude and seemed
to me to have small merit beyond a certain earnestness. And yet I thought
that here was one who had, by some mischance, seen nothing but the more
cruel and vicious side of American existence. Only a few will assert that
we have created Utopia, but there is at least ground for the affirmative
side of the question: Resolved, That many things in the United States are
admirably administered. In such a debate three mature men might easily
have prevailed against a boy. It seems to me that long before punishment
was even considered there should have been a sincere attempt to urge the
youngster out of his way of thinking. In his poem Gordon railed against
the notion that this is a land of opportunity. Most logically Healy and
Kelly and Voorhees might have pointed out that he, himself, through bene
fit of a scholarship, was enjoying whatever advantages Wisconsin has to
offer."
But no, the justices were not interested in showing the boy where he
was wrong. They were interested only in pointing out that the United
States government, through them, disapproved of such sentiments to such
an extent that one who had them must be incarcerated in a reformatory
for three years. "If he was older I would vote to send him to the peni
tentiary," said Voorhees.
And the judges kick about the juries!
