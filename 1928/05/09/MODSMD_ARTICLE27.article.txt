The Daily takes rather a fatherly interest in the freshmen. For that
reason, it should be said that it pains us more than the members of the
Class of 1931 when we take the latter to task for periodically setting fire
to the hay stacks which last week were drawn up on the University's far
flung fields. No less than nine piles of new-mown hay, fit for any poet to
make verses over, have been destroyed by fire since the sun-bronzed labor
ers and sturdy horses cut and gathered them.
Everyone assumes, without proof, that freshmen were guilty of the
arsons; at any rate, whoever were should be ashamed of their childishness.
Setting fire to hay is an annual custom which could easily be relegated to the
stack of traditions where the wearing of dinks and the tubbing of freshmen
repose.
The hay happens, as a matter of fact, to belong to Sam McDonald,
who is superintendent of athletic grounds and buildings. The University
allows him to cut the tender grass and fox tails which sprout on the adobe
fields of the campus, bale it, and sell it for what he can get. Therefore,
anyone who plunges a Vestal flame into the stacks of dry grass is not
getting revenge with the University for the quarterly $96.
