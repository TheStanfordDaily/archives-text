THIS PROBLEM NEVER
TROUBLED EVE
The rain will go away, if not today
probably tomorrow. And then it will
be spring again. That is, it will be
spring if the west wind doesn't start
blowing. If the west wind doesn't blow
the question which will be uppermost
in everybody's mind will be: Shall
campus women wear stockings? Or
shall they not?
The history of the anti-stocking
movement on the campus is some
thing like the new moon which set
with its rising. A little more than a
week ago some hardy souls did a
little pioneering along these lines.
Like most other pioneers their efforts
were not a raving success. Which pos
sibly made them feel badly.
Saves Money
The problem is not at all difficult,
but because nobody enjoys being
laughed at, least of all a college stu
dent, it is difficult to get action. To
consider the arguments of those in
favor:
1. Money is saved. Undoubtedly.
We don't know the mortality rate of
campus hosiery, but with some of
our antiquated furniture it must be
very high.
2. It is cooler. Naturally.

3. The chances for a good coat of
tan are materially increased. This
factor can't be underrated. Getting
brown has become a major feminine
activity, equalling, in some cases, the
importance which is attached to pick
ing off a husband.
4. There are other reasons, but we
can't think of them.
Not Immodest
Now to look at the opposition:
1. It is immodest. It isn't.
2. Men stare at girls without stock
ings. Also to be disregarded. It would
be physically impossible for them to
do much more staring than they nor
mally do.
3. Shoes are hard on bare feet.
Probably, but women enjoy suffering
for a worthy principle like this.
4. The area of operation for mosqui
toes is greatly enlarged. The Mosqui
to Abatement District, for which we
are taxed, is awakening from its
dreams; so this will not be a point
at argument.
5. There are other reasons, but we
can't think of them.
The Aesthetic Element
Our salient point we have cherished
until the very end. We mean, what
about the aesthetic element? That's
the point. Before a girl decides to do
without, she should most carefully
survey her limbs. Then she should ask
the opinion of two of her best friends.
Then, if all comment is favorable, if
her limbs are trim and attractive, she
should feel perfectly free to go with
out stockings on the campus. But
preferably she should first get rea
sonably tanned.
Such are the profound conclusions
of one clear out of his province.

brown has become a major feminine
activity, equalling, in some cases, the
importance which is attached to pick
ing off a husband.
4. There are other reasons, but we
can't think of them.
Not Immodest
Now to look at the opposition:
1. It is immodest. It isn't.
2. Men stare at girls without stock
ings. Also to be disregarded. It would
be physically impossible for them to
do much more staring than they nor
mally do.
3. Shoes are hard on bare feet.
Probably, but women enjoy suffering
for a worthy principle like this.
4. The area of operation for mosqui
toes is greatly enlarged. The Mosqui
to Abatement District, for which we
are taxed, is awakening from its
dreams; so this will not be a point
at argument.
5. There are other reasons, but we
can't think of them.
The Aesthetic Element
Our salient point we have cherished
until the very end. We mean, what
about the aesthetic element? That's
the point. Before a girl decides to do
without, she should most carefully
survey her limbs. Then she should ask
the opinion of two of her best friends.
Then, if all comment is favorable, if
her limbs are trim and attractive, she
should feel perfectly free to go with
out stockings on the campus. But
preferably she should first get rea
sonably tanned.
Such are the profound conclusions
of one clear out of his province.

THIS PROBLEM NEVER
TROUBLED EVE
The rain will go away, if not today
probably tomorrow. And then it will
be spring again. That is, it will be
spring if the west wind doesn't start
blowing. If the west wind doesn't blow
the question which will be uppermost
in everybody's mind will be: Shall
campus women wear stockings? Or
shall they not?
The history of the anti-stocking
movement on the campus is some
thing like the new moon which set
with its rising. A little more than a
week ago some hardy souls did a
little pioneering along these lines.
Like most other pioneers their efforts
were not a raving success. Which pos
sibly made them feel badly.
Saves Money
The problem is not at all difficult,
but because nobody enjoys being
laughed at, least of all a college stu
dent, it is difficult to get action. To
consider the arguments of those in
favor:
1. Money is saved. Undoubtedly.
We don't know the mortality rate of
campus hosiery, but with some of
our antiquated furniture it must be
very high.
2. It is cooler. Naturally.

3. The chances for a good coat of
tan are materially increased. This
factor can't be underrated. Getting
brown has become a major feminine
activity, equalling, in some cases, the
importance which is attached to pick
ing off a husband.
