# GOLF TEAM ELECTS WARD EDMONDS, '29, AS VARSITY CAPTAIN
## 
### 
Ward Edmonds, '29, Stanford's
record-breaking pole vaulter but
heretofore little known as a
mashie-wielder, was chosen to
lead next year's varsity golf
team yesterday at a meeting of
the goli' squad.
Edmonds has had two years'
experience as a varsity player,
and won his numerals in golf
as a freshman. He has been one
of Stanford's outstanding players
this season and promises to be
among the best in intercollegiate
competition on the coast next
year, according to Charles W.
Davis, Director of Intramural
Sports.
