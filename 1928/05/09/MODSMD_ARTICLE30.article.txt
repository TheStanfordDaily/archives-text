"Herbert Hoover," Will Irwin. Cen
tury Co.
Generally a biographer must spend
pages and pages of tedious space ex
ploiting the personal characteristics
of his subject. Will Irwin does not
have this necessity—here is the un
usual case where plain facts speak
eloquently enough. A campaign bio
graphy seems scarcely a thrilling
thing, but this book —doubly interest
ing to us from personal interest —is
most absorbing and stimulating.
Shorn of propaganda, and almost
starkly impersonal, the facts here tell
the story of Hoover plainer than
twelve million adjectives could. This
complete story of Hoover's life not
only reveals many little-known inci
dents of his youth, but connects the
whole, and shows the influence of
each event upon the man.
Gives Early Life
The influence of his Quaker hered
ity, and his childhood associations,
are related —Herb's first scientific ex- j
periment to see if tar would burn,
and the conflagration that followed — j
Herb played Indians —Herb's experi- 1
ment in natural history to see if an
owl would wring its own neck with
its curious twisting head —the experi
ment, mechanically-minded, with the
old plow and the calf —Herb reading
the forbidden book of "Robinson
Crusoe" —Herb brought up in the
county of Abraham Lincoln, reading
American history.
Probably more significant light on
the man today, however, and of deep
interest to us, is the life of Hoover
as a young man. The story of the
first life of Stanford has been told
over and over again, but the first
organization of college life and stu
dent activities is not so well known.
The influence of pioneer Stanford on
Hoover, and Hoover's influence on
Stanford and the integral part of stu
dent organization, are so closely in
termingled that it is impossible to
dissociate the two.
Humorous Incidents Cited
Irwin goes on to Hoover's early en
gineering, and then to his experiences
in China. This episode, during the
Boxer wars, and the discussion of his
work is a vivid introduction to his
international work. Humorous side
lights are not neglected, and the story
of Mrs. Hoover keeping house, a hos
pital, and a home, under fire, has a
magnificent pathos in its comedy.
And then, perhaps the most ab
sorbing part of Hoover's career is in
his war work. This account is naked
of any red-white-and-blue rah-rah
sentiment, and gives a clearer view
of the tremendous situation in Bel
gium than any discussion, we believe,
now obtainable. The countless inci
dents, fraught with economic, diplo
matic, and human problems are only
hinted at —the record of Hoover's
magnificent humanitarian struggle is
outlined in what is almost a catalogue.
Peace, and the work of reconstruc
tion, with Hoover's energy and execu
tive talents, vitalizing the war-shat
tered rags and tags of countries. All
his work has been on such a stupen
dous scale that it is hard to realize
its proportions. After reconstruction
comes Hoover's work in transforming
the almost prefunctory department of
commerce into a major agency for
increasing and stabilizing national
economic life.
All in all, and aside from partisan
and porsonal interests, Will Irwin's
biography is fascinating. It is an ex
traordinary fresco of photographs of
an extraordinary figure. "In the face
of difficulties, Herbert Hoover acts
like an optimist." —Hallie Keating.

Gives Early Life
The influence of his Quaker hered
ity, and his childhood associations,
are related —Herb's first scientific ex- j
periment to see if tar would burn,
and the conflagration that followed — j
Herb played Indians —Herb's experi- 1
ment in natural history to see if an
owl would wring its own neck with
its curious twisting head —the experi
ment, mechanically-minded, with the
old plow and the calf —Herb reading
the forbidden book of "Robinson
Crusoe" —Herb brought up in the
county of Abraham Lincoln, reading
American history.
Probably more significant light on
the man today, however, and of deep
interest to us, is the life of Hoover
as a young man. The story of the
first life of Stanford has been told
over and over again, but the first
organization of college life and stu
dent activities is not so well known.
The influence of pioneer Stanford on
Hoover, and Hoover's influence on
Stanford and the integral part of stu
dent organization, are so closely in
termingled that it is impossible to
dissociate the two.
Humorous Incidents Cited
Irwin goes on to Hoover's early en
gineering, and then to his experiences
in China. This episode, during the
Boxer wars, and the discussion of his
work is a vivid introduction to his
international work. Humorous side
lights are not neglected, and the story
of Mrs. Hoover keeping house, a hos
pital, and a home, under fire, has a
magnificent pathos in its comedy.
And then, perhaps the most ab
sorbing part of Hoover's career is in
his war work. This account is naked
of any red-white-and-blue rah-rah
sentiment, and gives a clearer view
of the tremendous situation in Bel
gium than any discussion, we believe,
now obtainable. The countless inci
dents, fraught with economic, diplo
matic, and human problems are only
hinted at —the record of Hoover's
magnificent humanitarian struggle is
outlined in what is almost a catalogue.
Peace, and the work of reconstruc
tion, with Hoover's energy and execu
tive talents, vitalizing the war-shat
tered rags and tags of countries. All
his work has been on such a stupen
dous scale that it is hard to realize
its proportions. After reconstruction
comes Hoover's work in transforming
the almost prefunctory department of
commerce into a major agency for
increasing and stabilizing national
economic life.
All in all, and aside from partisan
and porsonal interests, Will Irwin's
biography is fascinating. It is an ex
traordinary fresco of photographs of
an extraordinary figure. "In the face
of difficulties, Herbert Hoover acts
like an optimist." —Hallie Keating.

Generally a biographer must spend
pages and pages of tedious space ex
ploiting the personal characteristics
of his subject. Will Irwin does not
have this necessity—here is the un
usual case where plain facts speak
eloquently enough. A campaign bio
graphy seems scarcely a thrilling
thing, but this book —doubly interest
ing to us from personal interest —is
most absorbing and stimulating.
Shorn of propaganda, and almost
starkly impersonal, the facts here tell
the story of Hoover plainer than
twelve million adjectives could. This
complete story of Hoover's life not
only reveals many little-known inci
dents of his youth, but connects the
whole, and shows the influence of
each event upon the man.
