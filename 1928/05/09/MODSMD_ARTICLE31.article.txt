I think the way that everyone here
on the campus looks after the girls
is so marvelously altruistic. They are
always trying new ways of helping us
out, like giving us a certain number
of late leaves to be sure that we
won't be cheated.
And we must be careful about tell
ing where we are going so that if
any accidents occur, they will know
who is responsible. We are always
careful about signing out and telling
who told us we could go out. So you
see, everything is almost right out in
the open. I mean, the modern youths
keep very few secrets.
But do you know, by the time
everything is all arranged to go, we
are so tired that we have lost all our
pep and fire. And so we spend very
quiet evenings.
Of course, the health of all the stu
dents has to be looked after —train-
ing is such a social problem. But the
men really have the advantages for
relaxation. They have such a nice
gymnasium, and no lock-out rules.
And then, when a girl makes a mis
take three times in timing she has
to go up before Council for the lock
outs, even if they were really avoid
able, like brakes catching on fire or
something.
Oh yes, the campus women are
taken care of. Even when they are in
the hospital and nearly dying, their
very best masculine friends can't
even come to see them. Modesty is a
thing that must be reverenced, even
in a hospital.
I really feel rather hurt, though,
when very advanced thinkers like we
have on our University executive
staff say that any girl who wants to
stay out later than 1:30 o'clock does
n't belong here. It would seem that
there is a difference in the four hours
between nine and one, and the seven
and eleven of the old-time parties. I
wonder if they have a guilty con
science about the midnights of their
youth that they can't trust the
younger people of today.
