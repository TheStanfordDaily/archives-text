# NEW ZEALAND WANTS UNIVERSITY EDUCATION WITHIN CLOSE RANGE
## 
### 
"New Zealand is a poor country and
the New Zealander wants his educa
tion brought to him." Such was the
explanation of the island's university
system given last night by Professor
Harold Chapman Brown, of the
Philosophy Department, who spoke
in the Little Theatre on "Random
Impressions of New Zealand."
The University of New Zealand is
divided into four fundamental branch
es which give practically identical
courses, he said. Teachers on the
island feel isolated, Brown declared,
and they welcome contact with edu
cators from other countries.
One outstanding feature of the
Dominion's school system is its abil
ity to teach the people pure English.
"I felt awkward in my speech with
natives on day labor jobs," Brown
said.
The labor influence in New Zea
land's government was illustrated by
Professor Brown, who told of an
American engineering firm which
wished to introduce steam shovels in
the island, only to find that officials
demanded that as many laborers be
employed as if modern equipment
had not been used. This, he pointed
out, was to help alleviate the situa
tion of unemployment.
New Zealand's attitude in this mat

ter is somewhat justified, Brown de
clared, in that such steps are taken
to give the Dominion sound growth
without introducing foreign labor and
creating a race problem.

SHANGHAI, May B.—(U.P.)—The
body of Walter 13. Wilson, American
vice consul, was found today in the
Whangpoo river, near Shanghai.
