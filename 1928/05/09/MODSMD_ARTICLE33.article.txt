# HOME BRINGS JOYS TO CONVALESCENTS
## Forty-Five Children Receive Care, School; Change Patients Weekly 
### Sylva Weaver 
Twenty smiling-eyed children,
browned from Stanford's warm sun
shine, and clad in blue and red cover
alls, entered the once-famous living
room of the old Stanford residence
yesterday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
School was about to begin at the
Stanford Convalescent Home under
the direction of Mrs. Harriman.
"1 want you all to find a picture
and write a story about it," said the
teacher, as forty bright eyes were
concentrated on her. Quickly the
rustle of magazine leaves filled the
air in answer to her request. Little
Pauline, aged eight, gave a tiny
shriek of joy, for such a bounding
spirit as Pauline's cannot be regu
lated even by the requisite silence of
a schoolroom, as she discovered a
lovely picture of a baby and a nurse.
Then Pauline wrote her story with
all the enthusiasm and originality
in such technical matters as spelling
that her young soul could muster.
"I am going to lern to be a nors.
I will be one in a little wile. Mother
is sick and when I am a nors I am
going to help her, and in a few dass
she will be well agn. Now I am with
a babby to tacke ckra of. I am going
awa now the end."
There are forty-five children in the
Home continuously. Thursday of each
week is "change day." Six children
are admitted and six are dismissed
on this day. The new entrants are
usually placed in the new admission
ward of the McLaughlin Unit where
they can be isolated and thus the
other children can be protected from
contagious diseases.
Life at the Home is one of a peace
ful and happy community, and ,one
cannot help saying with one of the
nurses that "if the Stanford students
could only see what happiness and
joy their money provides, it would
give them that sense of satisfaction
that comes from doing something
worthwhile. Visitors are welcome at
any time.
In 1927 there were 181 children ad
mitted to the Home of which eighty
eight were girls and ninety-three,
boys. The work of the doctors' and |
nurses' staffs in changing the pale
and listless children to tanned, active,
and bright ones, is surely a work of
which the founders of the University
would be justly proud.

boys. The work of the doctors' and |
nurses' staffs in changing the pale
and listless children to tanned, active,
and bright ones, is surely a work of
which the founders of the University
would be justly proud.
Twenty smiling-eyed children,
browned from Stanford's warm sun
shine, and clad in blue and red cover
alls, entered the once-famous living
room of the old Stanford residence
yesterday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
School was about to begin at the
Stanford Convalescent Home under
the direction of Mrs. Harriman.
"1 want you all to find a picture
and write a story about it," said the
teacher, as forty bright eyes were
concentrated on her. Quickly the
rustle of magazine leaves filled the
air in answer to her request. Little
Pauline, aged eight, gave a tiny
shriek of joy, for such a bounding
spirit as Pauline's cannot be regu
lated even by the requisite silence of
a schoolroom, as she discovered a
lovely picture of a baby and a nurse.
Then Pauline wrote her story with
all the enthusiasm and originality
in such technical matters as spelling
that her young soul could muster.
"I am going to lern to be a nors.
I will be one in a little wile. Mother
is sick and when I am a nors I am
going to help her, and in a few dass
she will be well agn. Now I am with
a babby to tacke ckra of. I am going
awa now the end."
There are forty-five children in the
Home continuously. Thursday of each
week is "change day." Six children
are admitted and six are dismissed
on this day. The new entrants are
usually placed in the new admission
ward of the McLaughlin Unit where
they can be isolated and thus the
other children can be protected from
contagious diseases.
Life at the Home is one of a peace
ful and happy community, and ,one
cannot help saying with one of the
nurses that "if the Stanford students
could only see what happiness and
joy their money provides, it would
give them that sense of satisfaction
that comes from doing something
worthwhile. Visitors are welcome at
any time.
In 1927 there were 181 children ad
mitted to the Home of which eighty
eight were girls and ninety-three,
boys. The work of the doctors' and |
nurses' staffs in changing the pale
and listless children to tanned, active,
and bright ones, is surely a work of
which the founders of the University
would be justly proud.
