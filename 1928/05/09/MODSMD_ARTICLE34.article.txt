# SPORTS OF 1928
## Sir Walter's Conqueror 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The British Open Championship,
which gets under way on May 7th,
appears to he "in" the voluminous
"bag" of one Archie Compston, of
Wolverhampton, England, if one may
say that an open championship is
ever "in the bag." For in crushing
Walter Hagen, known as the greatest
of all match play golfers, 18 and 17
at Moor Park last April 27 and 28,
Compston showed such a dazzling
display of golf that he is now looked
upon as a top-heavy favorite to walk
Sandwich from next Monday till
Saturday.
"Who is this guy Compston? You
heard untutored individuals ask on all
sides as reports of llagen's defeat
trickled in, like Archie's putts, with
uncanny monotony. Archibald Ed
ward Wanes Compston was born in
Wolverhampton in January, 1893. Hc>
has been a British professional gol

fer for years, and was previously en
gaged at Kidderminster and Coven
try. He tied for second place in the
British open in 1925, was runner-up
i for the French open title that same
year, and won the Gleneagles and
Professional Golfers' Association
tournaments. He also won the "News
of the World" championship that year
and in 1927.
In 1926, Compston toured the United
States with Arnaud Massy, French
champion, and last year Ik; came here
ias a member of the British Ryder Cup
team. He is big and strong, and
noted for his long-driving ability.
Compston has also scored three lioles
in-one. In beating Hagen the con
queror of Jones and Duncan at match
play, "Big Archie" was thirteen un-
I der even fours for 54 holes, and that,
•
|by the bamboo-shafted spoon of Al
i lab, is some golf.
