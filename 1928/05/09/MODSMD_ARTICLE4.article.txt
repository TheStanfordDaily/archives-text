# DISCUS, POLE VAULT MARKS MAY FALL IN OLYMPIC TRIALS HERE
## Krenz, Edmonds Considered As Possible Winners Of New World Titles 
### Bob Speers 
While more than 100 of the best
track and field performers in northern
California are competing in the
Olympic tryouts here Saturday, addi
: tional lustre may be added to the
meet by the shattering of two world's
! marks.
Eric Krenz and Ward Edmonds,
j Dink Templeton's weight and pole
i vaulting aces, are the two gentlemen
who loom as possible holders of new
titles. Edmonds has come so close to
surpassing the best world's record
j during this past season that he will
| unquestionably be able to give the
crowd a real thrill.
i , Krenz has three times beaten the
world's mark in the discus, but be
cause these feats took place in prac
tice they could not be counted as of
j ficial. Two weeks ago, Eric tossed the
! platter within six feet of his goal
j against a stiff wind.
A1 Masters and his crew of mana
gerial assistants are going to have a
real job in preparing the local oval
for Saturday's carnival. All the races
will be run in meters instead of
1 yards, a fact which necessitates the
moving of all finishing posts. Then
in addition, a special pit will have to
be constructed for the hop-step and
-1 jump, which is not a regular part of
j the intercollegiate track and field pro
gram.
The hammer throw, another event
which is not often seen here, will
probably be held outside of the sta
dium to remove any danger of cracked
i skulls that have been known to re
j suit in that competition.
