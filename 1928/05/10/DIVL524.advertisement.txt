YEARS ago, P. A. showed a clean pair of heels
to the field of smoking-tobaccos. It has main
tained its lead ever since putting more distance
behind it every year. There must be a reason
why P. A. is the world's largest-selling brand.
There Is! Open a tidy red tin and get a full 1
breath of that class-by-itself fragrance. Then 1
tamp a load into the bowl of your pipe and |
light up. The first pull tells you why more men
smoke P. A. than any other brand. Cool and , / I j
smooth and mellow and mild —not for one I 1 tjmjffl J |
pipe-load, but always. Try this long-burning I jiiijSEv i
tobacco, Fellows. You'll say so!
