# Gardner Explains Administration Of Convalescents At Children's Home
## Stanford Spirit Is Revealed As Charity in Appeal For Home Funds 
### 
"We talk a lot about Stanford
spirit, and the Convalescent Home

appeal brings out Stanford spirit as
perfect charity," said Dr. Gardner,
who is president of the Board of Di
rectors of the Home, yesterday at a

meeting of the women who are con
ducting the A.W.S. Drive for $1500
which will take place next Monday,
May 14.

Dr. Gardner gave a short history of
the Convalescent Home, and urged
the women to realize that the stu
dents are asked to help support an
organization that is peculiarly Stan
ford's own, and is based on a firm
financial foundation.

The general endowment of the
Home at the present time is $ 174,-
G3G.73. The fund of $101,027.72 from
which a yearly income goes to the
Home as the rest of the endowment
is in special funds for additions and
improvements.
In the year 1927 the running ex
penses for the year were $36,939.85.
This included the administration,
operation, and maintenance of the
Home. Food and clothing for the chil
dren amounted to $10,324.05. The
convalescent children in the run
around unit, the old Stanford resi
dence, all wear the same type of
clothing. Blue and red overalls for
boys and girls alike are worn on
week-days, while on Sunday and spe
cial occasions the boys wear blouses
and corduroys and the girls dresses.

For repairs of the buildings and
grounds, laundry, lights, and heat, the
cost to the Home was $14,739.34. The
rest of the expenses for the year
were included in salaries, wages, and
printing with the comparatively small
item of $1,111.94 for medical and
dental treatment. The reason for the
small cost of medical treatment is
that doctors' services from Palo Alto*
are donated.
The distribution of the cost per
child per day has been carefully esti
mated by J. P. Mitchell, who is secre
tary-treasurer of the Convalescent
Home. It costs $2.57 to care for one
child for one day.

The money to run and operate the
Home comes from three sources. In
terest on the general endowment, ex
penses of the children paid by out
side organizations such as the Sciots
of San Francisco who support a num
ber of beds, and public contributions,
make up the income for the year.

From the last-named source is the
budget of ?16,134 from the San Fran
cisco Community Chest, and practi
cally all the rest comes from the in
dividual donations such as the stu
dents give. This year the University
students have pledged to give half
of the local subscription, that is,
$3500, of the $7000 needed from this
source to run the Home during the
next year.
