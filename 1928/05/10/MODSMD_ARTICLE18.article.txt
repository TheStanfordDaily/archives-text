# REPAIR RECORDS PROVE FRESHMEN DESTRUCTIVE TO ENCINA'S WINDOWS
## 
### 
Two hundred and seventy-four win
dows and transoms have been re
placed at Encina since the beginning
of last Fall Quarter, according to the
official glass replacer of the campus.
Of that number several were of plate
glass for the clubroom.

From a study of the repairman's
record it was found that the greatest
number of broken windows are in
rooms facing the courts at the back
of the hall. Innumerable light shades
are broken in the hallways of Encina
by freshmen each year. Further ex
amination of the records showed that
a large number of windows are
smashed at the ends of quarters,
while many transoms have met a
similar fate at the same time.

Contrasted to this record of glass
destroying at Encina, the list shows
that only fifteen windows were re
placed at Sequoia in the same period,
ten at the Union, eight at Toyon, and
one lone transom at Branner. The
only glass replacement at Roble was
in the swinging windows of the din
ing room where the wind was re
sponsible for the damage.
