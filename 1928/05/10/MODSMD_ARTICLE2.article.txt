# UNIVERSITY HIRES 110 MEN FOR FIELD WORK
## 
### 
The magnitude of the operations
carried on by the University aside
from those of a purely educational
nature may be seen by the fact that
the normal payroll for laborers alone
numbers 110 men. These figures
given out by the office of the super
intendent of the corporation yard
also show that many men in excess
â€¢of this number are being employed
in the various improvement jobS
about the campus.
In addition to those men who are
employed by the office at the cor
poration yard, between fifty and sixty
janitors are employed for hte build
ings on the Quad and the dormitories.
