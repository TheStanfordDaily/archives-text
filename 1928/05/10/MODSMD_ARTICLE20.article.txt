# The 						Truth Will Out
## 
### 
Politicians will do well to pick their candidates with care this week, for
the activities of each man running for office on the Student Body and
Men's Council ballots next Tuesday, will he itemized in the Daily next
Monday morning. The plan is to give full information as to each office he
has held or each activity in which the candidate has participated since his
entrance to Stanford. This will be strictly non-partisan and impartial.
A few times in the past the Daily has entered politics, and sponsored
men to whom the editor was partial. This will not be done this year. But
it is thought that too often many of the candidates are almost, if not totally,
unknown to the campus in general. Thus, to obviate the signing of ballots
just because one's friend says Bill is a good guy, or because the first name
is easiest to mark a cross beside, or one likes a certain name better, this
list will be published, giving as completely as possible in brief form, what
each man has done on the campus.
Read this information Monday. It should be enlightening as well as
