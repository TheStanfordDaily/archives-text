# Compassionate Marriages
## 
### 
A really and truly companionate marriage is now discovered, we see by
the Nation. One Judge Joseph Sabath of the superior bench, Chicago, has
just annulled the marriage of a couple who were joined in holy matrimony
by Captain Hartley on board the good ship Leviathan. His grounds were
that, upon investigation of the laws of the forty-eight states, he could
find not one that authorized ships' captains to perform marriage cere
monies. This same opinion was recently expressed by the United States
Shipping Board.

But the meat of the thing is that Judge Sabath says these marriages are
not void, but merely voidable, which in legal contemplation means they are
perfectly valid until either party wishes to break the contract. All pro
ponents of the companionate marriage should look upon this with delight.
What could be simpler: no license, no three days' notice; merely a short
little ceremony and a honeymoon on the boat. Then when the party of the
first part or second part desires a new mate or new surroundings the party
may just back out.

But what aljout the righteous souls who will believe that this will put
a smirch on their escutcheons, and that they aren't as well married as they
thought? Captains have been doing this sort of thing for some generations
now, and there are probably many hundreds or perhaps even thousands of
families built upon this flimsy ( ?) structure. Oh, well, they needn't worry
too much. No one will question them, and they are perfectly safe until
wifey or hubby gets huffy.
