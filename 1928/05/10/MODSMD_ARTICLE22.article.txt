# What! No Esprit de Corps?

Emile Berliner and C. F. Jenkins, both inventors of many little doo
dads which increase the cost of living and decrease the amount of steps
necessary to get from the kitchen sink to the stove and back, have a young
woman interested in their several prides who is trying to defeat a bill
introduced in Congress to give Thomas A. Edison a congressional medal
in honor of his multitudinous achievements.
Berliner claims to be the inventor of the microphone, the continuous
current transformer, and the gramophone, and Jenkins claims honor for
the motion picture machine, all of which have been popularly listed to the
credit of Edison. The two gentlemen have an array of evidence support
ing their claims, and they may be quite right, but it looks like rather of a
back-stabbing to try to keep the daddy of so many whatchamacallits from
getting his medal. Why, they might want to get one themselves sometime,
and if they were nice boys maybe Edison would lend them a few patents to
put the deal over.
