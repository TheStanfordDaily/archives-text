Down in Brownsville, Texas, a collcge Tor parrots has been started with
an enrollment of some 1500 birds who are being taught to talk by the means
of special phonograph records. The ages of the birds run from five to
eight months and they are instructed lor about three months, with periodic
examinations. The value of each is judged by his flow of words on gradu
ation.
Now this is the kind of school the Democrats or Republicans should
start. They could turn out orator after orator and give them jobs accord
ing to their "flow of words on graduation." At least they'd all speak the
same language.

Stanford women who have won Phi Beta Kappa keys arc fairly unanimous in
disagreeing with the University of Wisconsin co-ed who declined the honor on the
grounds that it didn't stand for true scholarship. But where the real unanimity
could he found would he among those who strove for the key but failed to win it—

and all of them would declare with the Wisconsin girl that it wasn't worth having.—

In a column of the Daily Princctonian, we find the item: LOST. Eng

the innocent individuals involved please drop around to 223 Lockhart.
