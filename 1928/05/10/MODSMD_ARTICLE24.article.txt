IT RESPONDS TO BABY'S' TOUCH
"Yes, this is absolutely the newest
model out. It has a beautiful finish
which will always take a high polish.
Here is an extra reserve tank —there
our special sparking system which
never misses fire, and best of all you
get two hundred to the gallon."
"All right. I'll take one of those
cigarette lighters."

Another Down-hearted Letter for
the Home-folks:
Dear mother,
I guess I'm not doing so well in
college. Maybe I should have stayed
home and taken post-graduate work
in Wilbush High like pop suggested.
We had a test yesterday and they
asked us about "liberty." I couldn't
think of anything to tell them except
what pop used to tell you at the din
ner table. I don't know whether they
will think the same way or not. Then
they asked us about the race troubles
and I wasn't very well acquainted
with this, so I told them frankly that
the nearest I ever came to being a
track man was when I worked on the
section gang last summer.
Last night I played bridge until
two o'clock to try to improve my
game. Tell pop I can't buy that
sweater he sent me ten dollars for.
We had hash for dinner, and it is
raining today—oh yes, I am trying to
break in a new pipe, too, so you can
imagine just how I feel about it all.
Love, Herbert.
