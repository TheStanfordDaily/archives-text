The Editor, Sir:
Two hundred and sixteen men
pledged fraternities, and no doubt a
larger number have been rushed last
month. Probably most of these men
thought of the wasted expense in
board bills at the Commons. In fact,
a number of "wise" freshmen have
escaped the sacrifice through doctors'
excuses, thus not paying for meals
they had to miss while eating up on
the Row. The rest of the time they
spend the saved money for meals off
the campus.
The present system perhaps en
ables the Commons to pick up in
finances, but it should not be done
this way, if solely for good principle.
If the method was made more satis
factory, so the freshmen would not
feel the loss, there would be less
excused boarders, and thus a larger
income which would not rely on ab
sences to make the grade.
