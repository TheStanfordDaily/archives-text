# BASSETT SPEAKS ON LURE OF MONACO AT EUPHRONIA MEETING
## 
### 
A description of the gambling J
houses of Monte Carlo featured the j
talk given last night by Professor
Lee Emerson Bassett of the Stanford
English Department before the meet-

ing of Euplironia, men's debating so
ciety, in the lobby of the Old Union.
His topic was "The Lure of Monaco."

In closing his speech Professor
Bassett declared that the principle
upon which Monte Carlo is based is
entirely wrong and expressed his hap
piness that we have nothing like it
here.
During the business meeting which
followed the talk an amendment was
voted upon and passed that elections
for club officers be held twice a year
instead of each quarter as in the past.
A committee was appointed to inves
tigate upon the matter of organizing
Euphronia into a Stanford chapter of
a national fraternity and to submit a
report at the next meeting. Plans for
the quarterly banquet were also dis
cussed.
