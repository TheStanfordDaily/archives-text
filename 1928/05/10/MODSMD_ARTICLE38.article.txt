# JUNIORS TAKE 2 TO 1 SOCCER CLASH FROM SENIORS IN TOURNEY
## Class of 1929 Team Shows Superior Forward Line Play to Win Tilt 
### 
Juniors with a superior forward
line and offense defeated the senior

soccer team yesterday afternoon in
the second game of the interclass
soccer tournament to a score of 2 to 1.
Roy Morris of the junior team made
both of the scores for his team, while
Bob Dawson kicked the only goal
made by the seniors.

In the first part of the game the
juniors kept the seniors back near
the junior goal. The seniors in this
part of the game were showing a
good defense but no offense what
ever. The halfbacks of both teams
seemed to be doing most of the play
ing.
No scores were made in the first
half but Morris came through in the
first ten minutes of the second half
with his first score. Then no scores
were made until the last ten minutes
of play when Morris shot his second
goal, and immediately after that Daw
son scored for the seniors.

There were seven varsity soccer
players listed on the junior team
lineup including Captain-elect A1
Gibhs. The senior team consisted
mostly of holdovers, and it was great
ly handicapped by the fact that its
lineup had only ten men.

The juniors will meet the freshmen
Friday in the third interclass game,
and Monday the seniors and sopho
mores will play off their game. At
present the freshmen and the juniors
each have two points toward the in
terclass trophy.
