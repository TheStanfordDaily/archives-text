# WATSON GAINS LEAD BY SMALL MAJORITY IN INDIANA ELECTION

### 
INDIANAPOLIS, May 9.— (U.P.)—
Agricultural Indiana, combined with
the organization of the party in pow
er, was successful in Tuesday's pri
mary in winning the state's 33 dele
gates for United States Senator
James E. Watson, "Favorite Son"
candidate for the Republican presi
dential nomination.

Secretary of Commerce Herbert
Hoover lost gradually today as re
turns were received from the outlying
districts and the early lead he had
assumed Tuesday night was wiped
away and a majority estimated at
more than 30,000 in Watson's favor
remained tonight.

Returns from 2993 precincts out of
3610 precincts gave: Watson 169,002;
Hoover 142,918.

Evans Woollen, Indianapolis bank
er, was unopposed for the preferen
tial vote on the Democratic presiden
tial ballot.

In conceding Watson's victory, Os
car G. Foellinger, state campaign
manager for Hoover, said the result
was a "great victory" for the Secre
tary of Commerce.

"From a standpoint of actual
votes," Foellinger said, "Herbert
Hoover has been defeated, but con
sidering the fight he waged and
against whom, he has won a great
victory."
Indiana was the first agricultural
state in which Hoover's name was en
tered in a primary, and, as had been*
predicted, the farmers' vote went
against him. The municipalities and
industrial centers went heavy for
Hoover but the Watson organization
with its appeal to the farm vote were
odds which the former could not sur
mount.
Hoover's manager in pointing out
that he lost "only by a small number
of votes against one of the most pow
erful political machines in the United
States," said that it was Senator
Watson's "moral duty" to permit the
delegates to vote for Hoover when
the Senator is eliminated at the con
vention.

HARRISBURG, Pa., May 9.—( U.P.)
—Secretary Herbert Hoover's prefer
ential vote in the Republican primary
will approximate more than 50,000, it
was disclosed today when additional
returns were filed in the State Elec
tion Bureau by seven counties.
