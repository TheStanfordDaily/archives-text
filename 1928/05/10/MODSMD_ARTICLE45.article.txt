# SPORTS OF 1928
## Two New Umpires 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
"Umpireâ€”a person chosen to de
cide a question in controversy," says
the dictionary. But a big league
baseball umpire has to do lots more
than that. Little items such as know
ing and enforcing the rules of the
game, controlling your temper, being
sincere and in good physical condi
tion, having keen eyesight, an expert
knowledge of human nature, and the
ability to handle men, all help make
the umpire's job one of the toughest
in existence. Colorful arbiters like
Bill "Lord" Byron, "Silk" O'Laughlin
and Tim Hurst are few and far be
tween, yet as they leave the ranks
new ones come up to take their places
and the new ones are always interest
ing.
The two new National League um
pires this year are "Dolly" Stark and
Sherwood Magee. The former, never
a star player, has been especially
groomed to take the place of that
veteran of veterans, Hank O'Day,
while the latter has been connected
with the national pastime ever since
before 1904, when he came up to the
Phillies as a rookie outfielder.
"Dolly" Stark is a product of col

lege circles, having been basketball
coach at Dartmouth for four years,
and an umpire of "big league" col
lege ball games for many seasons.
He had a trial as an infielder with
Washington in 1920, and later play
ed for Jersey City and Newark. He
has already established the reputation
of being one of the smartest and
fastest of the older circuit indicator
men.
Sherwood Magee played with the
Phillies for ten years, then with the
Braves and Reds until 1920, and then
went to the minors. In 1915, fifteen
years after he had led the National
League batters, and when he was
forty-one years old, he was the lead
ing American Association batsman
He has umpired spring training
games since 1921 and last season
worked in the New York-Pennsyl
vania League.
