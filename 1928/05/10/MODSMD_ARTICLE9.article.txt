# FACTIONS IN CHINESE CIVIL WAR MAY UNITE TO OPPOSE JAPANESE

### 
PEKING, May 9.—( U.P.) — The;
Japanese troops in China were men- j
aced tonight hy the threat of immi
nent union of warring Chinese fac- \
tions to drive them from Chinese soil. I

Marshal Chang Tso-Lin, the power- [
ful northern war lord, ordered his
troops to cease fighting "since all
China is faced by outside danger." i
The southern forces, which have
been driving northward against
Chang Tso-Lin, already are locked in
a deadly battle with the Japanese at j
Tsinan-Fu.
Shang Tso-Lin's order followed an
appeal from the Shanghai Chinese
Chamber of Commerce to all Chinese
tactions to unite against Japan.
The northern war lord declared he 1
had attempted to fight communism t
but other dangers in China now are j
greater.
"It is highly regrettable that for
eigners should be involved in our
domestic struggles," Chang Tso-Lin's i
statement said.

Anti-Japanese feeling throughout j
north China is increasing. The situa
tion has been aggravated by the deci
sion of the Japanese to build an aero
drome near Tientsin, despite the re
fusal of the Chinese Foreign Office to
grant a permit for its construction. I
Fighting there is feared should the 1
Japanese continue with their plans.
The reports of the fighting at Tsin
anfu, which tonight was continuing,
and rumors of heavy Chinese casual
ties have incensed Chinese against
the Japanese until actual union of the
warring factions no longer is improb
able.
The possibility of an anti-Japanese
boycott, with serious damage to
Japan's extensive trade, is foreseen.
That lives and property of other
foreigners now are endangered is
conceded by observers here, for the
Chinese are in a state of excitement i
that excesses would be unavoidable
in event the Chinese gain control of
Tsinanfu or other property now pro
tected by the Japanese.
