Tobacco *
"A Prescription"
r i
Have you ever noticed
. right after a meal
How tired and laay
you always feel?
I'm telling you folks
it isn't a joke,
It will freshen you up l^
if you try a good smoke.
But whatever you do ,
these lines you must heed,
. There's a certain tobacco *
of course, that you need.,
It's packed in a tin,
the tin's colored blue.
Not only the smoking
but the chewing kind too.
Of course if you never !
are bothered this way,
Just keep the prescription
for some other day.
Ask for tobacco,
the best that's on earth;
To shorten the story,
just call it "Edgeworth/J
