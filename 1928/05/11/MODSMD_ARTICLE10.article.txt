# JUNIOR WEEK LAKE SPORTS TO BE HELD TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
Lake sports at Lagunita will be held
as a feature of Junior Week tomorrow
at 10:30 o'clock, announces Tom Thur
low, who is in charge of the aquatic
events.
The Swedish Marathon, which is held
among the four classes in the University,
will start the events. The sophomore
team, captained by Reggie Harrison, is
a strong favorite to win the marathon, as
Bramel, Driggs, and Harrison form a
strong backbone for the team, which will
be hard to beat. 1928 is given second best
chance to win. Each team is composed of
ten men who swim fifty yards each, from
the boathouse to a float.
Had ley Bramel is doped to win the
cross-lake swim, second event of the day.
Last year Bramel took second place in the
distance race, which is swum from the
spot where the water enters Lagunita to
the boathouse. Ogden Driggs, 440-yard
swim star, is given almost equal chances
with Bramel.
A canoe race, won by Dave Fall and
Walter Mills last year, is the next con
test. Entries for Saturday have not been
announced. Canoe tilting, the crowning
event of the day, will also be the last.
Anyone who is a bear for punishment and
not afraid of a ducking can enter this
comical event. Each canoe has a team of
two men, one at the paddle and the other
armed with a long pole padded with a
boxing glo\*e. The idea is to push the
other canoe over or unhorse the opposing
pole-wielder, and the awkward results of
the fight usually bring down the house.
