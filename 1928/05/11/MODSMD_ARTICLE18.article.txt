## NINE CLASSES WILL RETURN TODAY FOR UNIVERSITY HOMECOMING REUNION Evening Set Aside For Visiting Fraternity, Sorority Groups; Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur To Be At Home Tomorrow 
### Janet Post 
Members of the "great Stanford family now world wide in its interests
and activities" are coming back to the campus tomorrow to renew the old
memories and associations that form their common home ties. Nine classes,
beginning with the class of 00, which will have twenty-five years of catching
up to do, have planned reunion meetings as a part of the eighth annual
University Day program.
Instead of a general alumni reunion, University Day this year will be
marked by the return of groups of classes whose members were under
graduates together in the same years. One of these groups includes 1905,
1906, 1907, and 1908, the last class to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of
its graduation. The other group includes a more recent set of classes, from
1924 to 1927. The class of 1903 has the distinction of being in a group by
itself.

alumni to visit their fraternity and so
rority groups before the regular program

of the University and something of its
plans for the future at a luncheon being

Members of the "great Stanford family now world wide in its interests
and activities" are coming back to the campus tomorrow to renew the old
memories and associations that form their common home ties. Nine classes,
beginning with the class of 00, which will have twenty-five years of catching
up to do, have planned reunion meetings as a part of the eighth annual
University Day program.
Instead of a general alumni reunion, University Day this year will be
marked by the return of groups of classes whose members were under
graduates together in the same years. One of these groups includes 1905,
1906, 1907, and 1908, the last class to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of
its graduation. The other group includes a more recent set of classes, from
1924 to 1927. The class of 1903 has the distinction of being in a group by
itself.
