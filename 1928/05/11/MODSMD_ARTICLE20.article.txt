# Business And The Grad
## 
### 
"What a college trained man has to offer to, and what he has a right
to expect of, business and industry," was used as a topic for discussion at
the fourth personnel session among spokesmen for college undergraduates
in a number of eastern colleges, and commercial representatives, at the
University Club of Boston. The student observers assured the business
men that they recognize their worth to business must be measured by their
willingness to work and to adapt themselves to the needs of service in
commerce as well as in college.
This has a tendency to make one say "heh-heh, I suppose they think
that is something new." The statement is so obviously the correct thing
to say that there is no combatting it, and no one would want to, anyway.
But, conversely, there are a great many of the oldsters who claim that
college students graduate with the idea that all they have to do is to step
out and wait around for a job to be tossed their way. This belief is just
as trite as that of the students, but it is far more false. Perhaps there are
many students who feel this way; in fact, there undoubtedly are.
In these days, however, young men in college are much more apt to
know what is going on in the business world than they did in ye goode
olde days when college life was a profession in itself. There aren't so
many who believe they are going to have things handed out all along the
line.
Of more significance at the session was a statement by William T.
Foster, director of the Pollak Economic Foundation. He said: "Business
does not expect college to send it men who can step in and reorganize the
sales force, but it does expect their graduates to have a liberal point of
view, capacity for leadership, initiative, and the ability to see the forest
instead of merely trees."
In other words, Mr. Foster says that business doesn't expect the
college graduate to know HOW to do things at the start, but to have the
CAPACITY to learn, and the ability to see how the things he does and
observes relate to other activities. It's not the detail, but the method, that
counts.
