With spring running rife in the vicinity, we find the crop of stocking
less co-eds growing each day and we heartily approve the style, not to say
the economics involved. Not long ago it would have been the height of
indecency for a young lady to do such a thing as bare her legs in public,
unless she was taking a swim. Why, just a few years ago there was an
awful uproar when the girls started to roll their stockings below the knees,
but now even the Women's Physical Education department sanctions it in
athletic outfits.
This nude-leg custom started a little while back. Some prima donna
(names slip the editorial mind) ran out of stockings over in Paris, and was
in a terrible quandary as to what she would do. But, remembering that an
actress never forgets her cues, she got out the trusty Gillette, and fared
forth onto the boulevards sans hose. The midinettes and goggle-eyed
tourists were all a-buzz next day, and in a short time it was quite the
thing to go jauntily about one's affairs with only a pair of slippers below
the knee.
It didn't take long for conservative womanhood to see that this was a
splendid means of saving money, as well as being in style. Decent stockings
cost unheard-of sums, we are told, and the more they cost the shorter they
live. Therefore, the more hours they can rest peacefully in the bureau,
the more chance their fair owner has of using them when she really must.
The only recommendation we have to make is that it might be a good
plan for beauty parlors to put in a new department where some of the
no-sox addicts might have knees, as well as faces, lifted.
