# STEWART DECLINES TO DISCUSS STANDARD OIL RESIGNATION REQUEST
## 
### 
CHICAGO, May 10.—(U.P.)—Col
onel Robert W. Stewart refused to
reply today to the demand of John D.
Rockefeller, Jr., that Stewart resign
as chairman of the board of directors
of the Standard Oil Company of In
diana, dismissing the controversy
with the explanation that a statement
was "untimely."
Stewart, who arrived shortly before
noon from New York, went immedi
ately to his offices here and declined
all attempts to be interviewed. He
explained that in view of the con
tempt proceedings pending in Wash
ington, he would not discuss the
Rockefeller letters given out in New
York Wednesday.
Stewart left the train at Engle
wood, an outlying district, and went
to his office in an automobile in order
to evade the crowd of newspapermen
that awaited him in Chicago.
His action today indicated he in
tended to wait until he could learn
the sentiment of other stockholders
in the Standard company before he
would consent to a special "show
down" meeting. In his brief typewrit
ten statement he said he would give
"the most careful consideration" to
any communication from any stock
holder of the company.

A gift of $25,000 for a new ethics
course was received by the com
merce school of Northwestern Univer
sity.
