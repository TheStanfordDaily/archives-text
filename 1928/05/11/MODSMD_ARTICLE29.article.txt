"Garde a Vous!" by J. D. Ncwsom.
Doubleday, Doran & Co., Garden City,
New York.
This is a not at all remarkable novel
about the French Foreign Legion. It isn't
bad reading, but there really isn't much
to it.
The story is very much like "Beau
Geste" with the three brothers left out,
but not nearly so good. However, it has
some clever moments, and the end has
some minor surprises. But we weren't es
pccially impressed by the manner of the
last-minute resctie of four people, when
the insurgent Bern* Harazan scattered and
retreated at the mere sound of the reliev
ing force's bugles.

One rather good point of the book is
in the discussion of French imperialism.
It is shown cynically, almost bitterly.
Then the author turns around and shows
how France gets away with it, by incul
cating in even her Foreign Ixgion, made
up chiefly of foreigners, the love of
French glory. In doing this, he discards
all his cynicism, and achieves even mo
ments of grandeur. But then, there is
always something magnificent about a
body of men responding instantly to the
call of patriotism. Pacifists and cynics
may call it sob-stuff, but it docs work.
All in all, the book is quite common
placc, but it is enjoyable if one casts aside
all exjiectation of improving the mind or
finding a great work.â€”Astrid Arnoldsoti.
