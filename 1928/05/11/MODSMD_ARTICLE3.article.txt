# Juniors Present South Sea Opera Tomorrow Night
## 
### Margaret Cummings 
"South Seas Preferred," the 1929 Jun
ior Opera by Herb Reynolds and Jack
Shoup, will be given at 8:15 o'clock to
morrow evening in the Assembly Hall.
Final dress rehearsal was held last
night, with plenty of South Seas and
South Sea Island belles in evidence, and
grass skirts of every shade. Costuming
and sets are colorful, and are supple
mented with great effectiveness by clever
lighting.
Musical numbers showed up especially
well, with a harmony duet by Pewee and
Bee (Cass and North) in the first act
which is worth the price of the show in
itself. Ted Duncan is musical director of
the show. Tom Watt, who with Neal
Spalding made a name for himself by
his harmony singing in Encina this year,
has some good songs.
Specialty acts evidence clever planning
and originality. The cannibal dance in
the second act is a novelty, as are the
two stowaways in the big box who sing
for their passage. Kathleen Fitz has a
feature song to new-blues music.
All principals in the show are experi-
enccd in campus productions. Though it
is the first time either Helen Ward or
Carol Wynn have played in lead roles,
both are well cast.
The light, burlesque tone is maintained
throughout, with the straight comedy
parts being taken by A1 Cass and Ken
neth Lloyd, and by Edwina Ewing as
Mrs. Sheckel. Lines throughout are
clever, and the show gets lots of laughs.
Choruses, under the direction of Fran
ces Boone, have done work which is a
real departure in finish and plan from
the type variety usual to college musical
comedy. The serpentine effect with the
hula girls is particularly good.
The box office will open at 7 o'clock
tomorrow night when the few remaining
seats will be placed on sale. No rough
seats will be sold.
