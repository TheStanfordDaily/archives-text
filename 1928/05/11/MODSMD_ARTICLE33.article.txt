## ANSWER TO A MAIDEN'S PRAYER 
### 
The Board of Athletic Control, says;
! the Daily, is considering the possibility of
S a new gymnasium for women, and ways
\ and means of raising money are being in
vestigated.
Loud "Hosannas" will doubtless
be heard from fair members of
the student body on receipt of
this startling news, and most of
the Stanford community is prob
ably just as fervent in offering up
a silent prayer that something
will really be done—at last.
In the first place, humanity at large
| will be rendered a great service when the
eye-sore which constitutes the present!
women's athletic equipment is gone. From ,
a purely artistic point of view the removal
of that blot on Stanford's landscape, the
girls' gymnasium, will be a great boon, i
On one side of the campus
loom the graceful arcades of a
great stadium—for the exploita
tion of men's physical prowess, i
On that same side of the campus
are extensive brown brick struc
tures with tile roofs, surrounded
by green lawns and carefully
grouped shrubbery—all contribu
tory to the cause of building the
body beautiful for Stanford man
hood. The less said about the
shack stuck in the wilds of north
campus the better—it's for the
I 500.
It's all very natural, of course. The
men make all the money, and receive the
j fruits of their labors. The Board of
| Athletic Control has taken a big amount
|of rather severe criticism for its distri-
I bution of funds, and perhaps the attacks
| were somewhat justified. But members of
the poor old Board of Athletic Control
J shouldn't be snarled at too cruelly. It's
I their money, and, after all, they aren't
running a charitable institution.
If some definite action can be
taken, though, to forever banish
those sagging wooden walls from
the campus, Allah should be
praised, and the women, in their
chic new rompers, should accom
plish bigger and better things in
physical culture.—Bob Speers.

campus the better—it's for the
I 500.
It's all very natural, of course. The
men make all the money, and receive the
j fruits of their labors. The Board of
| Athletic Control has taken a big amount
|of rather severe criticism for its distri-
I bution of funds, and perhaps the attacks
| were somewhat justified. But members of
the poor old Board of Athletic Control
J shouldn't be snarled at too cruelly. It's
I their money, and, after all, they aren't
running a charitable institution.
If some definite action can be
taken, though, to forever banish
those sagging wooden walls from
the campus, Allah should be
praised, and the women, in their
chic new rompers, should accom
plish bigger and better things in
physical culture.—Bob Speers.
