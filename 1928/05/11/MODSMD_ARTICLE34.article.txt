# AND Then Our Little SALLY...

### 
It was very thoughtful of someone to
put the Junior Opera on the night of
home-coming day. I mean, it ought to
save the alumni the trouble of finding
something to do.
With the Olympic tryouts in the after
noon, I think the chorus ought to give
them a little relief from the strain of
watching so much competition. I do think
the grass skirts are quite intriguing. Of
course, they have to be standing still while
they wear them, but every one has the
same idea.
It really is fascinating to keep track
of the changes that come in every year
with cacii new opera. Why now they are
actually letting the girls be economical
about stockings. I guess that since they
have accepted a new kind of gym suit,
nothing matters very much any more. I
hope the home-comers appreciate what an
advancing institution this is.
Because the only thing that seems to
be left of the older days is the building
where they put on the shows. I mean,
every one remembers the old horseshoe
form.
I had a thought the other day that if
the partition walls back stage were struck
down, that there would be more room for
the chorus to work out. But I guess that
they can't give up everything all at once.
Anyway, I hope that the home-comers
like the entertainment and realize how
hard we have been working for them. I
mean, we want our efforts appreciated by
their support.
