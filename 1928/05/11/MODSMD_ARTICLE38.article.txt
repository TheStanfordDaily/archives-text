BERKELEY, May 10. —(P.1.F.) —
With the closing of the present se
mester at the University of California
but a few days distant, every mem
ber of the 1928 varsity football team
has made arrangements to -work dur
ing the summer months.
Irvine Phillips, end and captain
elect of the 1928 varsity, will go to
Cambridge for the 1.C.-4A. track and
field meet before settling down for
the summer. He is favored to place
again in the discus this year. He was
good for a second place in the 1927
meet.
A Berkeley and Oakland laundry
truck will give Benny Lom, halfback,
his summer's employment. Jim Cock
burn, fullback, will travel to South
America as an ordinary seaman,
while Stanley Barr, who made a repu
tation for himself in the last Wash
ington game, will go with one of the
fishing fleets to the coast of Alaska.
Paul Clymer, halfback, is to be a
clerk for the Yosemite National Park
Company. Lee Eisan, stocky little
quarter noted for his broken field run
ning, will continue in his present
position as playground director in
West Berkeley, working on a full
time rather than part-time basis. Russ
Ewing, fastest halfback on the squad,
will work in Pomona for six weeks
before he takes a trip to Michigan.
