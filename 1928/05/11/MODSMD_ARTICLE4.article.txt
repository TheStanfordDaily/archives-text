# Students To Get Yearly Call For Help Of Charity
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
Stanford will have an opportunity to
prove her charity Monday in the Stan
ford Convalescent Home Drive for $3500.
A very complete organization has been
worked out by the two chairmen of the
Drive, Baylor Brooks who has charge of
the A.S.S.U. campaign, and Lilian Force
who is handling the A.W.S. division.
The appeal for funds from the students
will be concentrated in the one day, Mon
day, May 14. A thorough canvass of all
the living groups will be made by the
various committees which have been ap
pointed to speak and to collect pledges
and money for the Convalescent Home.
The women of the University have set
for themselves a goal of $1500, which
represents an average of $3 apicce from
each one of the five hundred, while the
$2000 set for the men's quota represents
an individual contribution of $1 from each
man student.
Stanford's One Charity
The Convalescent Home is a charity
which is peculiarly Stanford's own. The
Home as it is today represents the grad
ual growth of an organization which was
| started on the campus in 1920. Many of
the graduates from the earlier years of
the University will remember when the
students used to gather grapes in the
i vineyard, and the faculty could honestly
purchase its modest gallon of old port
! from the winery.
They will remember, too, the cordial
I hospitality that existed in the old Stan-
I ford residence when the Governor and
Mrs. Stanford held open house on a
Sunday afternoon. After the Stanfords
died the home was rented by the Uni
versity, and it was not until the summer
of 1919 that the idea of caring for the
sick and crippled children of the hospitals
of San Francisco at the "Farm" came into
existence.
Founders' Home
In 1920 the Stanford Home for Chil
dren was established in the old Stanford
residence. The house and 27 acres of the
surrounding land were leased from the
trustees of the University at a rental of
a dollar a year. The chaplain, Dr. Gard
ner, has been the guiding hand of the in
stitution since its founding, and it is with
characteristic graciousness that he says:
"But it was not possible that the Stanford
home with its happy memories, its great
kindness, its devotion, its charity, should
lie forgotten. A use worthy of the name
of the founders of the University would
be found. Both of them loved children,
so what was more fitting than to use the
Stanford residence for the benefit of sick
children ?"
Sincc the institution of the Home on
the campus the organization of the Home
has grown apace. There are now three
units to the Home, and the old Stanford
residence hold? only a little lo s s half
the children. Two extra units have been
built to care for the rust.
Two Units Added
The McLaughlin Unit was added to
the Home in 1923, and the outstanding
improvement of the last year was the
addition of the new admission ward to
this unit where the bed-patients are kept.
Work is going on at present on the Bab
cock Unit, a gift of Mrs. Harry Bab
cock, and when this building is completed
it will be an exact replica of the Mc-
Laughlin Unit.

so what was more fitting than to use the
Stanford residence for the benefit of sick
children ?"
Sincc the institution of the Home on
the campus the organization of the Home
has grown apace. There are now three
units to the Home, and the old Stanford
residence hold? only a little lo s s half
the children. Two extra units have been
built to care for the rust.
Two Units Added
The McLaughlin Unit was added to
the Home in 1923, and the outstanding
improvement of the last year was the
addition of the new admission ward to
this unit where the bed-patients are kept.
Work is going on at present on the Bab
cock Unit, a gift of Mrs. Harry Bab
cock, and when this building is completed
it will be an exact replica of the Mc-
Laughlin Unit.
Stanford will have an opportunity to
prove her charity Monday in the Stan
ford Convalescent Home Drive for $3500.
A very complete organization has been
worked out by the two chairmen of the
Drive, Baylor Brooks who has charge of
the A.S.S.U. campaign, and Lilian Force
who is handling the A.W.S. division.
The appeal for funds from the students
will be concentrated in the one day, Mon
day, May 14. A thorough canvass of all
the living groups will be made by the
various committees which have been ap
pointed to speak and to collect pledges
and money for the Convalescent Home.
The women of the University have set
for themselves a goal of $1500, which
represents an average of $3 apicce from
each one of the five hundred, while the
$2000 set for the men's quota represents
an individual contribution of $1 from each
man student.
Stanford's One Charity
The Convalescent Home is a charity
which is peculiarly Stanford's own. The
Home as it is today represents the grad
ual growth of an organization which was
| started on the campus in 1920. Many of
the graduates from the earlier years of
the University will remember when the
students used to gather grapes in the
i vineyard, and the faculty could honestly
purchase its modest gallon of old port
! from the winery.
They will remember, too, the cordial
I hospitality that existed in the old Stan-
I ford residence when the Governor and
Mrs. Stanford held open house on a
Sunday afternoon. After the Stanfords
died the home was rented by the Uni
versity, and it was not until the summer
of 1919 that the idea of caring for the
sick and crippled children of the hospitals
of San Francisco at the "Farm" came into
existence.
Founders' Home
In 1920 the Stanford Home for Chil
dren was established in the old Stanford
residence. The house and 27 acres of the
surrounding land were leased from the
trustees of the University at a rental of
a dollar a year. The chaplain, Dr. Gard
ner, has been the guiding hand of the in
stitution since its founding, and it is with
characteristic graciousness that he says:
"But it was not possible that the Stanford
home with its happy memories, its great
kindness, its devotion, its charity, should
lie forgotten. A use worthy of the name
of the founders of the University would
be found. Both of them loved children,
so what was more fitting than to use the
Stanford residence for the benefit of sick
children ?"
