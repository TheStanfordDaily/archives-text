Stanford will have an opportunity to
prove her charity Monday in the Stan
ford Convalescent Home Drive for $3500.
A very complete organization has been
worked out by the two chairmen of the
Drive, Baylor Brooks who has charge of
the A.S.S.U. campaign, and Lilian Force
who is handling the A.W.S. division.
The appeal for funds from the students
will be concentrated in the one day, Mon
day, May 14. A thorough canvass of all
the living groups will be made by the
various committees which have been ap
pointed to speak and to collect pledges
and money for the Convalescent Home.

each one of the five hundred, while the
$2000 set for the men's quota represents
an individual contribution of $1 from each
man student.
