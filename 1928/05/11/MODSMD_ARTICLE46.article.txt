# National Board On Campus For Annual Meeting
## 
### 
The Stanford National Hoard will hold
its annual meeting on the campus this
afternoon, devoting the afternoon to an
inspection of various University labora
tories and departments as a preliminary
to its conference with President Wilbur
concerning the conduct and development
of the University.
Give Stanford Ideas
The board is composed of outstanding
men in their communities, both Stanford
graduates and those who have not at
tended Stanford. These have been chosen
so as to represent all parts of the coun
try, and their function is to bring into
the counsels of Stanford fresh ideas and
to take back to Stanford men and women
in their home districts information about
the progress and plans of the University.
The non-alumni members are chosen by
the Hoard of Trustees, and the alumni
representatives by the alumni association.

The most recent addition to the Na- j
tional Board among the alumni group is !
Robert W. Campbell, '96, who has had j
long experience in the conduct of univer- !
sity affairs through membership for a i
dozen years on the Board of Trustees of
Northwestern University, several of them
as president of the board, and through his
chairmanship of the endowment commit
tee which raised $8,000,000 for that uni- ;
versity. A lawyer, practicing in Chicago, j
Campbell has engaged in many industrial, j
business, and public enterprises.
