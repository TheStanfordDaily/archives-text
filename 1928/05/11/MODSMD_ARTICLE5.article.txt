# STOCKINGLESS GIRLS CALLED VULGAR BY DOCTOR JORDAN
## 
### Mary Lee Richmond 
"Girls without stockings?" Dr. Jordan
looked mildly surprised. "But are there
any on this campus ?" was his response
when his opinion on this difficult question
was sought in a recent interview.
Wednesday's edition of the Stanford
Daily was produced, and the Bull Session
on what "never troubled Eve" pointed out.
"I have not seen one of these girls
yet," said Dr. Jordan, "but I would say
that their names should be written with
the initial 'V' in front of them. That
'V' is for vulgar," lie explained.
He takes this strong stand against such
a fad, he admitted, not because he con
siders it an indication of wickedness, but
because it is coarse-grained, and reduces
itself to a question of poor taste.
"If a man should appear on campus
with shoes and no stockings, I should
consider it vulgarity on his part as well,"
he continued.
Girls' Smoking, Vulgar
However, Dr. Jordan is not thus in
favor of the "single" standard on all
points unreservedly. Regarding smoking
he makes this distinction:
"If a girl smokes, it is her business.
But if I ever saw one smoke, I would
cross her off my visiting list," he said
with a smile that relieved the severity of
his words. "It is mildly injurious to her
—and wholly vulgar.

"Cigarettes are not so injurious for
men. Yet I am convinced that men who
smoke habitually will never do as high a
grade of work as they arc capable of, and
will never attain as much."
Dr. Jordan believes that the question
of convenience and advantage should play
an important part in governing one's con
duct. "If an advantage is to be gained
by a new movement, then I approve of
and admire the person who stands forth
boldly and proclaims this advantage.
"As to the modern girl's style of dress,"
he went on, "I recognize that it has an
enormous convenience, until the point is
reached where this is overdone. Every
girl knows herself where the line should
be drawn."
Favors Women's Athletics
Women's athletics he definitely favors.
"The more they have of sports, the better
it is for them, providing it is not a waste
of time," is his opinion.
The Pope's scathing denouncement of
women in Italy who were participating in
the Olympic tryouts, which was published
a few days ago, was brought up at this
point. "Well," laughed Dr. Jordan, "I
am afraid that the Pope is not a very
good judge of girls."
But the persistent interviewer was un
able to gain any satisfaction from Dr.
Jordan on the subject of bobbed hair, be
yond his acknowledging that it was doubt
less "very convenient."

"The more they have of sports, the better
it is for them, providing it is not a waste
of time," is his opinion.
The Pope's scathing denouncement of
women in Italy who were participating in
the Olympic tryouts, which was published
a few days ago, was brought up at this
point. "Well," laughed Dr. Jordan, "I
am afraid that the Pope is not a very
good judge of girls."
But the persistent interviewer was un
able to gain any satisfaction from Dr.
Jordan on the subject of bobbed hair, be
yond his acknowledging that it was doubt
less "very convenient."
"Girls without stockings?" Dr. Jordan
looked mildly surprised. "But are there
any on this campus ?" was his response
when his opinion on this difficult question
was sought in a recent interview.
Wednesday's edition of the Stanford
Daily was produced, and the Bull Session
on what "never troubled Eve" pointed out.
"I have not seen one of these girls
yet," said Dr. Jordan, "but I would say
that their names should be written with
the initial 'V' in front of them. That
'V' is for vulgar," lie explained.
He takes this strong stand against such
a fad, he admitted, not because he con
siders it an indication of wickedness, but
because it is coarse-grained, and reduces
itself to a question of poor taste.
"If a man should appear on campus
with shoes and no stockings, I should
consider it vulgarity on his part as well,"
he continued.
Girls' Smoking, Vulgar
However, Dr. Jordan is not thus in
favor of the "single" standard on all
points unreservedly. Regarding smoking
he makes this distinction:
"If a girl smokes, it is her business.
But if I ever saw one smoke, I would
cross her off my visiting list," he said
with a smile that relieved the severity of
his words. "It is mildly injurious to her
—and wholly vulgar.

"Cigarettes are not so injurious for
men. Yet I am convinced that men who
smoke habitually will never do as high a
grade of work as they arc capable of, and
will never attain as much."
Dr. Jordan believes that the question
of convenience and advantage should play
an important part in governing one's con
duct. "If an advantage is to be gained
by a new movement, then I approve of
and admire the person who stands forth
boldly and proclaims this advantage.
"As to the modern girl's style of dress,"
he went on, "I recognize that it has an
enormous convenience, until the point is
reached where this is overdone. Every
girl knows herself where the line should
be drawn."
Favors Women's Athletics
Women's athletics he definitely favors.
