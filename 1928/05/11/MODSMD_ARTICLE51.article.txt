### 
NEW YORK, May 10.—(U.P.)—Gov
ernor Alfred E. Smith flicked the ashes
from a dead cigar stump, leaned across
the table toward the Senate campaign in- ;
vestigating committee in a hotel parlor j
here today, and said:
"I promised the people of this state i
when I was inaugurated governor in 1927 ;
that I would be their governor and noth- j
ing else. 1 told them that job would take
all my time. I know nothing about the
presidential campaign that has been con
ducted. I have done nothing, I don't in
tend to do anything. What my friends
have done you can learn from them."
The director of Smith's "friends,"!
George R. Van Namee, a public service
commissioner of New York State, fur
nished the committee an account of the
work done in the governor's behalf, show-,
ing that $103,310 had been collected and]
$92,090.28 disbursed.
The largest financial contributor, Van j
Namee revealed, is William F. Kenny, a j
contractor, who donated $20,000 and ad-!
vanced $50,000 in loans. The committee I
displayed more interest in this fact than j
any other developed in the two-hour ses- 1
sion for which the committee came up !
here from Washington.
Resume Hearing Friday
Under questioning, it was brought out !
that Kenny has done some of New York j
City's gas and sewage mains construction '
work, but Van Namee never heard that I
Kenny had ever obtained any state con- 1
tracts for road construction.
The second point in which the commit-1
tee manifested deep interest was the ac- J
count of Van Namee showing that $45,000
had been sent into California for the pri
mary there. Van Namee thought that any
suggestion that the Smith organization in

California had used a corruption fund
was ridiculous. Two pieces of literature
sent to the voters cost nearly $40,000 to
distribute, he said, and furthermore $3500
of the $45,000 advanced was later re
turned unused.
The committee hearing will resume on
Friday in Washington where James R.
Good, director of the Hoover-for-Prcsi
dent Club, will testify, as will Senator
Watson of Indiana.
