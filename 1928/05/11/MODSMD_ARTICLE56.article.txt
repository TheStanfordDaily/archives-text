# MOTHER'S DAY SUNDAY Card Sale Shows Increase GIFTS, FLOWERS SENT
## 
### 
Mother's Day, which comes Sun
i day, will be observed by more Stan
ford students this year than ever be
! fore, according to Mrs. H. T. Bau
| chou, head of the stationery depart
ment at the Bookstore. She bases her
statement on the yearly increase in
! the sale of Mother's Day greeting
[ cards.
"Many students, of course, send a
gift of flowers and enclose a card,"
she said, "while others merely mail
the present or send only the card.
! The idea has been put over and is
j going big."
Most of the students have mothers
who are alive to remember, but those
who are not so fortunate often send
| greeting cards to someone who is tak
j ing the mother's place. Many cards
are mailed each year to the mothers
of sweethearts as well.
At least half of the students at
Stanford purchase cards in the Book
i store, according to the figures of Mrs.
Bauchou.
"The Mother's Day sentiment is
j rapidly growing and is worthy of
I encouragement for reasons other
i than the mere sale of cards," she
added.
Mrs. Bauchou believes that Father's
Day is not so well observed, but that
it will no doubt attract increasing at
tention in the future. Since the day
comes in the middle of June and few
students are here at the time, she has
very little information on which to
base her judgment.
