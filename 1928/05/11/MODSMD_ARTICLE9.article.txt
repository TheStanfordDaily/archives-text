# OLYMPIC TRIALS SLATED HERE TOMORROW
## Nichols, Leistner Expected To Stage Good Race In Low Hurdles Extended Time Granted To Squad; May Stay Until Olympic Tryouts 
### Bob Speers 
Stanford trackmen today re
ceived permission from the Fac
ulty Committee on Athletics to
remain in the East following the
I.C.A.A.A.A. meet until the Olym
pic Tryouts on July 6 and 7. Tem
pleton's team will also be allowed
to compete in the National Colle
giate Athletic Association meet
in Chicago on June 9 and 10.
This action does not definitely
assure the extended Eastern so
journ, it is pointed out, as finan
cial arrangements must first be
made by the Board of Athletic
Control. Two lines of action seem
probable. First, some of the Cards
may be taken East to compete
under club colors with the clubs
paying thei expenses. Second,
Templeton may cut down his
squad enough to permit those who
do go to remain for a longer
period.
Just how wide a swath will be cut
by Cardinal track and field athletes
in international competition this sum
mer is to be more or less determined
in the Stanford Stadium tomorrow at
2:30 o'clock when more than 100 men
will compete in the Olympic Tryouts.
The fact remains that a contestant
may be victorious tomorrow, and still
amount to little at Amsterdam, but
nevertheless, Card fans can afford a
little optimism if some of Temple
ton's pupils come through.
Long Race Unique
The 10,000 meter race will be a
novelty in this locality, but it prom
ises to be almost as tiresome for the
spectators as for the participants in
that it takes about a half hour. Be
cause of this fact, officials, who are
running the meet, have arranged to
start the gruelling contest early in
the day—at 1:30 o'clock probably—
so that it will be finished by the time
that the competition proper is begin
ning. This will save uninterested
parties boredom.
One of the features of tomorrow's
classic should be the 110 meter high
hurdle race. Nichols and Leistner
will stage a great battle for first, from
all indications. "Swede" has shown
great improvement since the Olympic
Club-Stanford meet, and in practice
he and next year's Stanford track
ekipper have been splitting honors
consistently.
For the benefit of those who are
confused by the European custom of
using meters instead of yards to
measure distances tomorrow, an arith
metical translation is given here
with: 100 meters is 109 yards; 200
meters, 219 yards; 400 meters, 437
yards, 800 meters, 875 yards; 1500
meters, IG4O yards; 5000 meters, 5468
yards; 10,000 meters, 10,936 yards;
110 meter high hurdles, 120 yards;
400 meter low hurdles, 437 yards;
1600 meter relay, 1750 yards.
