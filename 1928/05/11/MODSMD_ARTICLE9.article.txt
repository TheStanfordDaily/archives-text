# OLYMPIC TRIALS SLATED HERE TOMORROW
## Nichols, Leistner Expected To Stage Good Race In Low Hurdles Extended Time Granted To Squad; May Stay Until Olympic Tryouts 
### Bob Speers 
Stanford trackmen today re
ceived permission from the Fac
ulty Committee on Athletics to
remain in the East following the
I.C.A.A.A.A. meet until the Olym
pic Tryouts on July 6 and 7. Tem
pleton's team will also be allowed
to compete in the National Colle
giate Athletic Association meet
in Chicago on June 9 and 10.
This action does not definitely
assure the extended Eastern so
journ, it is pointed out, as finan
cial arrangements must first be
made by the Board of Athletic
Control. Two lines of action seem
probable. First, some of the Cards
may be taken East to compete
under club colors with the clubs
paying thei expenses. Second,
Templeton may cut down his
squad enough to permit those who
do go to remain for a longer
period.
