The Big Dramatic Smash
"THE NGOSE"
with
Richard Barthelmess
A First National Picture. Not in
years has the screen given you
drama so realistic —so vivid—so
appealing! A supreme charac
terization by the star of the im
mortal "The Patent Leather
Kid," with Lina Basquette, Alice
Joyce, and Montague Love.
