# TEMPLETON SAYS 'BUD' CAN DO BETTER; ANNOUNCES IC-4A TEAM
## Spencer, Coe, Morrison Go East to Train; Thirteen Others May Leave 
### Templeton Peck 
"It still isn't the best," laconically
remarked Dink Templeton when
asked for a statement about Captain
Bud Spencer's race in the 400 meters
last Saturday, in which he broke the
world's record. "Spence can run fast
er than that; he admitted afterward
that it was the easiest race he had
ever run."
Templeton is of the opinion that
the wind sweeping down the straight
away .was a not inconsiderable handi
cap for 240 yards of the race, while
that which aided him on the seventy
five yards of the home stretch was
practically negligible, because the
breeze doesn't come strong on that
side of the stadium.
"Some day, when he has all the
conditions right, Spence will crack
that record right," Dink said. "I
think that very probably he would
have been timed in 47 1-5 if he had
run the full 440."
Asked how many men were to be
sent East next Friday for the 1.C.-4A.
championships at Cambridge, May 25
and 26, Templeton declared that if all
went well, arrangements would be
made to send a team of sixteen men.
Spencer; Henry Coe, two-miler; and
John Morrison, quarter-miler, left yes
terday morning via the Gold Coast
Limited for Andover, Mass., where
they will train for the 1.C.-4A. They
will be quartered at the Pliillips-An
dover Academy, famous Eastern prep
school.
The remainder of the team, which
is certain to leave next Friday, con
sist of Ross Nichols, Eric Krenz, Har
low Rothert, A1 Forster, Bill Spar
ling, Kim Dyer, Fred Zombro, Bob
King, and Ward Edmonds. Clarence
West, if he can leave his studies in
the Business School, Lee Kibby, Tom
Joaquin, and Herb Fleishhacker com
plete the sixteen and will be taken,
pending completion of arrangements
by the Board of Athletic Control.
