# DISMISS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON CLASSES FOR LABOR PROGRAM
## 
### 
All afternoon classes on Wed
nesday, May 16, will be excused
to allow students to partake in
the annual Labor Day program
at the Convalescent Home, an
nounces Harvey Lytel, the gen
eral chairman of Labor Day.
Seraphim Post, chairman of the
Labor committee, has mapped
out the grounds around the
Home into fourteen sections, and
Louis Vincenti, chairman of the
grounds committee, will place
one of his committee men in
charge of each section. The
workers, who should be at the
field of action shortly after
lunch, will be apportioned to the
various foremen as fast as they
appear.
Mr. Guntlier, manager of the
Union stores, will manage the
concessions, while the women on
Anne Hartwell's committee will
serve. All the proceeds will go to
the Convalescent Home fund.
Plans for entertainment are
going ahead and the program
promises to be the most unusual
and surprising yet staged. There
may possibly be a'few "aviation"
numbers but that is not yet defi
nitely decided upon, says Norm
Larson, chairman of the enter
tainment committee.
John Van Amringe, head of
the transportation committee,
would appreciate the services of
anyone who owns a car.
