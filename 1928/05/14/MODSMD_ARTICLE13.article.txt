# ANNUAL MUSICALE OF TOYON IS PRESENTED
## 
### 
Toyon Club, in presenting its fourth
annual musicale last night, varied
from the usual custom of engaging
only campus musicians. The program
was given by the Lichtenstein String
Quartet from the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, and by Marie de
Forest Emery, a Pcilo Alto soprano.
Mozart's "Quartet in B flat. Major
(No. 15)," the opening number, was
well rendered by the quartet. San
tuzza's Aria from "Cavallerla Husti
cana" by Mascagnl, was one of the
best solos sung by Mrs. Emery.
