# 1929 QUAD TRYOUTEES WILL MEET TOMORROW NIGHT IN UNION OFFICE
## 
### 
The first 1929 Quad tryoutee meet
ing for managerial and editorial po
sitions will be held tomorrow night
at 7:45 o'clock in the Quad office in
the Old Union, according to Homer
Craig, manager of the 1929 Quad.

All sophomores are eligible to try
out for staff positions both on the
editorial and the managerial staffs.
Very little work will be done by the
tryoutees this quarter, except for a
few hours on Saturdays. Tryoutees
work one year, at the end of which
those with the highest number of
points are appointed to positions.

No previous experience is neces
sary for the work. For the manager
ial staff it consists of soliciting ad
vertisements, selling Quad subscrip
tions, and working in the office. On
the editorial staff it consists of work
in the office, helping the editor,
making suggestions on the book, and
proof-reading.

There are four salaried positions on
the managerial staff and four on the
editorial staff, all of which include
both men and women. All expenses
incurred in getting material for the
book are paid by the Quad.
