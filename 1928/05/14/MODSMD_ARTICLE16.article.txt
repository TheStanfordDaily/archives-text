# Mystery Ship Strikes Newfoundland Rocks
## 
### 
ST. JOHNS, Newfoundland, May 13.
—(U.P.) —An unknown steamer ran
aground on Cape Freels Shoals, near
here, early today, and has been sound
ing a siren at frequent intervals, ac
cording to the Cape Pine light-keeper.
Dense fog and rough weather have
prevented sighting of the ship or
launching of boats from the rock
bound shore.
The ship presumably Is a tramp,
without wireless, otherwise the Cape
Race station would have picked up
distress signals.
For twenty-four hours the whole
south coast has been enveloped in
dense fog.
Help Stanford's Own!
