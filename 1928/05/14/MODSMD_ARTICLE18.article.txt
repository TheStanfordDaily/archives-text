# JUNIOR OPERA PLEASES WITH CLEVER LINES
## Cass Scores Hit in South Sea Play With Clever Comedy; Music Good 
### Hallie Keating 
Junior Operas come and go, but the
puns stay on forever —and "South
Seas, Preferred," presented Saturday
night at the Assembly Hall, had an
ample share. The general plot of the
play was perhaps more suitable for a
Ram's Head, since the audience
around here has an unfortunate habit
of taking burlesque seriously. But
the very clever lines were an out
standing feature, and kept the laughs
coming from the house as regular as
the staccato of a machine-gun. Bee
and Peewee, in particular, seemed
two parts that were a direct inspira
tion of the Lord. The character con
ceptions were clever and good com
edy, and though the plot was frail
indeed, it followed the best traditions
of Junior Opera in givnig a phenome
nal range for chorus costuming. It
was authentically collegiate without
the "College Humor" influence.

With about the third minute of the
play, A1 Cass picked the show up on
his shoulders and ran away with it.
The proportion of comedy and clown
ing were better balanced than in any
part we have seen him play these
four years, and his business was well
timed with his lines. The "One-Gal
Sailor" appealed to us as the best
song of the show.
Bee, with Julia North, was well
cast, and. besides, gave the part some
good touches of her own. Dorothy,
with Helen Ward, was the traditional
blonde heroine, and eminently satis
factory. Bob, with Carol Wynr... was
so very likeable and good-natured
that some of his best lines were lost.

When Thomas Watt, who played
Arthur, loses his habit of looking
deep into every woman's eyes, and
has had a little more experience, he
will be a very popular leading man.
Even now he has one of the most
charming stage presences the campj?
has witnessed. Kenneth Lloyd, as
Mr. Sheckel, was handicapped by the
Smith Bros, disguise he wore, and
that the burlesque of his part was a
little too subtle. He did, however, get
over some of the good lines of the
show, with the immemorial "tum
tums" and his "immense" comple
ments. Edwina Ewing, as Mrs. Sheck
el, Robert Keerl, as the old sea-captain,
Keel, and E. H. Conroy, played their
character parts with refreshing spon
taniety. And Toya, as tropical as any
man-eating shark of the south seas,
was very beautiful, and fairly seduc
tive.

The chorus work was better than
in the Gaieties. Frances Boono de
serves a bigger hand for her work
than we have space to give her —in
particular, the finales, generally the
most awkward of amateur numbers,
were good.
The specialty numbers were one of
the high points. "Struttin' Along" with
Fitz herself, "Deck Swabbers' Chor
us" and Reprise, and "Two Runaway
Stowaways"—the harmony number
with Katharine Crane and Virginia
Moulton —compensated for the lack
of a Track Show this year. The Can
nibal dance with Link Malmquist and

Don Marquis was a new edition by this
popular pair of doggers, and what
with the makeup, got one of the big
gest hands of the evening. The most
unique feature of all, however, was
the tumbling act, with Vernon Perren
and Darwin Peavy.
The music was consistently good,
and though it was dragged in some
what surprisingly in places, was
worth it. The Cass-North duet in the
first act, the Ward-Watt-Wynn mil
lionaire song, and the great love song
with the heroine and hero in the third
act, were three songs that could stand
publishing.
All in all, it was a good Junior
Opera, from the point of music, au
thorship, chorus work, voices, and
cast. There were, of course, the ob
vious flaws of every Junior Opera, but
who cares?
Some day, perhaps, Dramatic Coun
cil will have a brainstorm and export
the Junior Opera wholesale to Los
Angeles where there are plenty of
alumni, and ex-alumni, and families
waiting to buy seats. Most of the
Eastern colleges attempt going on the
road occasionally, and there is no
reason why football should be the
only paying activity on the campus.
And think how surprised some fami
lies would be to see their children
thus!
Help Stanford's Own!

Bee, with Julia North, was well
cast, and. besides, gave the part some
good touches of her own. Dorothy,
with Helen Ward, was the traditional
blonde heroine, and eminently satis
factory. Bob, with Carol Wynr... was
so very likeable and good-natured
that some of his best lines were lost.

When Thomas Watt, who played
Arthur, loses his habit of looking
deep into every woman's eyes, and
has had a little more experience, he
will be a very popular leading man.
Even now he has one of the most
charming stage presences the campj?
has witnessed. Kenneth Lloyd, as
Mr. Sheckel, was handicapped by the
Smith Bros, disguise he wore, and
that the burlesque of his part was a
little too subtle. He did, however, get
over some of the good lines of the
show, with the immemorial "tum
tums" and his "immense" comple
ments. Edwina Ewing, as Mrs. Sheck
el, Robert Keerl, as the old sea-captain,
Keel, and E. H. Conroy, played their
character parts with refreshing spon
taniety. And Toya, as tropical as any
man-eating shark of the south seas,
was very beautiful, and fairly seduc
tive.

The chorus work was better than
in the Gaieties. Frances Boono de
serves a bigger hand for her work
than we have space to give her —in
particular, the finales, generally the
most awkward of amateur numbers,
were good.
The specialty numbers were one of
the high points. "Struttin' Along" with
Fitz herself, "Deck Swabbers' Chor
us" and Reprise, and "Two Runaway
Stowaways"—the harmony number
with Katharine Crane and Virginia
Moulton —compensated for the lack
of a Track Show this year. The Can
nibal dance with Link Malmquist and

Don Marquis was a new edition by this
popular pair of doggers, and what
with the makeup, got one of the big
gest hands of the evening. The most
unique feature of all, however, was
the tumbling act, with Vernon Perren
and Darwin Peavy.
The music was consistently good,
and though it was dragged in some
what surprisingly in places, was
worth it. The Cass-North duet in the
first act, the Ward-Watt-Wynn mil
lionaire song, and the great love song
with the heroine and hero in the third
act, were three songs that could stand
publishing.
All in all, it was a good Junior
Opera, from the point of music, au
thorship, chorus work, voices, and
cast. There were, of course, the ob
vious flaws of every Junior Opera, but
who cares?
Some day, perhaps, Dramatic Coun
cil will have a brainstorm and export
the Junior Opera wholesale to Los
Angeles where there are plenty of
alumni, and ex-alumni, and families
waiting to buy seats. Most of the
Eastern colleges attempt going on the
road occasionally, and there is no
reason why football should be the
only paying activity on the campus.
And think how surprised some fami
lies would be to see their children
thus!
Help Stanford's Own!
Junior Operas come and go, but the
puns stay on forever —and "South
Seas, Preferred," presented Saturday
night at the Assembly Hall, had an
ample share. The general plot of the
play was perhaps more suitable for a
Ram's Head, since the audience
around here has an unfortunate habit
of taking burlesque seriously. But
the very clever lines were an out
standing feature, and kept the laughs
coming from the house as regular as
the staccato of a machine-gun. Bee
and Peewee, in particular, seemed
two parts that were a direct inspira
tion of the Lord. The character con
ceptions were clever and good com
edy, and though the plot was frail
indeed, it followed the best traditions
of Junior Opera in givnig a phenome
nal range for chorus costuming. It
was authentically collegiate without
the "College Humor" influence.

With about the third minute of the
play, A1 Cass picked the show up on
his shoulders and ran away with it.
The proportion of comedy and clown
ing were better balanced than in any
part we have seen him play these
four years, and his business was well
timed with his lines. The "One-Gal
Sailor" appealed to us as the best
song of the show.

serves a bigger hand for her work
than we have space to give her —in
particular, the finales, generally the
most awkward of amateur numbers,
were good.
The specialty numbers were one of
the high points. "Struttin' Along" with
Fitz herself, "Deck Swabbers' Chor
us" and Reprise, and "Two Runaway
Stowaways"—the harmony number
with Katharine Crane and Virginia
Moulton —compensated for the lack
of a Track Show this year. The Can
nibal dance with Link Malmquist and

Don Marquis was a new edition by this
popular pair of doggers, and what
with the makeup, got one of the big
gest hands of the evening. The most
unique feature of all, however, was
the tumbling act, with Vernon Perren
and Darwin Peavy.
The music was consistently good,
and though it was dragged in some
what surprisingly in places, was
worth it. The Cass-North duet in the
first act, the Ward-Watt-Wynn mil
lionaire song, and the great love song
with the heroine and hero in the third
act, were three songs that could stand
publishing.
All in all, it was a good Junior
Opera, from the point of music, au
thorship, chorus work, voices, and
cast. There were, of course, the ob
vious flaws of every Junior Opera, but
who cares?
Some day, perhaps, Dramatic Coun
cil will have a brainstorm and export
the Junior Opera wholesale to Los
Angeles where there are plenty of
alumni, and ex-alumni, and families
waiting to buy seats. Most of the
Eastern colleges attempt going on the
road occasionally, and there is no
reason why football should be the
only paying activity on the campus.
And think how surprised some fami
lies would be to see their children
thus!
Help Stanford's Own!
Junior Operas come and go, but the
puns stay on forever —and "South
Seas, Preferred," presented Saturday
night at the Assembly Hall, had an
ample share. The general plot of the
play was perhaps more suitable for a
Ram's Head, since the audience
around here has an unfortunate habit
of taking burlesque seriously. But
the very clever lines were an out
standing feature, and kept the laughs
coming from the house as regular as
the staccato of a machine-gun. Bee
and Peewee, in particular, seemed
two parts that were a direct inspira
tion of the Lord. The character con
ceptions were clever and good com
edy, and though the plot was frail
indeed, it followed the best traditions
of Junior Opera in givnig a phenome
nal range for chorus costuming. It
was authentically collegiate without
the "College Humor" influence.

With about the third minute of the
play, A1 Cass picked the show up on
his shoulders and ran away with it.
The proportion of comedy and clown
ing were better balanced than in any
part we have seen him play these
four years, and his business was well
timed with his lines. The "One-Gal
Sailor" appealed to us as the best
song of the show.
Bee, with Julia North, was well
cast, and. besides, gave the part some
good touches of her own. Dorothy,
with Helen Ward, was the traditional
blonde heroine, and eminently satis
factory. Bob, with Carol Wynr... was
so very likeable and good-natured
that some of his best lines were lost.

When Thomas Watt, who played
Arthur, loses his habit of looking
deep into every woman's eyes, and
has had a little more experience, he
will be a very popular leading man.
Even now he has one of the most
charming stage presences the campj?
has witnessed. Kenneth Lloyd, as
Mr. Sheckel, was handicapped by the
Smith Bros, disguise he wore, and
that the burlesque of his part was a
little too subtle. He did, however, get
over some of the good lines of the
show, with the immemorial "tum
tums" and his "immense" comple
ments. Edwina Ewing, as Mrs. Sheck
el, Robert Keerl, as the old sea-captain,
Keel, and E. H. Conroy, played their
character parts with refreshing spon
taniety. And Toya, as tropical as any
man-eating shark of the south seas,
was very beautiful, and fairly seduc
tive.

in the Gaieties. Frances Boono de
serves a bigger hand for her work
than we have space to give her —in

most awkward of amateur numbers,
