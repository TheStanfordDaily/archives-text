# MUSICALE IS PLANNED TO RAISE MONEY FOR CAMPUS REST HOMES
## 
### 
The Mothers Club will terminate
their work for this year by a garden
party and benefit musicale held at
the home of Mrs. Paul Shoup in Los
Altos tomorrow at 3 o'clock. The
proceeds will go toward the establish
ment of rest homes on the campus
next year for students who are not
sick enough to go to the hospital, but
are in a rundown, over-tired condi
tion.
The program will consist of the
Stanford Women's Glee Club and a
trio composed of Elizabeth Peirce,
violinist; Mary Moynihan, pianist;
and Evelyn Hahn, flutist. Paul Brain
ard, tenor, accompanied by Mrs.
Brainard; and Marjorie Blackwelder
will be the soloists. A second trio
composed of Leland Long, cellist;
Elizabeth Moser, violinist; and
Henry Moser, pianist, will also enter
tain.
Tickets may be obtained for fifty
cents through Mrs. E. C. Baker,
Kingscote Apartments, or at Mrs.
Shoup's on the afternoon of the musi
cale. Five hundred tickets have al
j ready been sold.
Help Stanford's Own!
