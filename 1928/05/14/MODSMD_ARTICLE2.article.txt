# SAN MATEO POLOISTS COMBINE WITH CARD TEAM TO PLAY GAME
## 
### 
A combined Stanford varsity and
Menlo Circus Club polo team won 12-5
from the San Mateo Polo Club in a
game played at the new Menlo field
Saturday afternoon. Thompson and
Post started the play with Jenkins
and Coryell of Menlo. In the next
chukker McDougall went up at three,
and during the seventh and eighth
periods Weymouth played, making the
team exclusively a Stanford one.
McDougall, who accounted for six
of the twelve goals, made some re
markable long hits. Thompson, be
sides making three counts, did ex
cellent work on the defensive with
long back shots. Although hit in the
chest by a strong drive, Bud Post was
the hardest rider in the game and
made two goals.
Willie Tevis, San Mateo's five-goal
handicap player, did some stellar
playing which failed to be effective
"because of lack of support by his
teammates. In the fifth chukker Tevis
was thrown from his horse which
rolled completely over the rider with
out injuring him.
Help Stanford's Own!
