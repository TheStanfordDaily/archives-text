Hadley Bramel, fighting his way to
the finish line through water weeds
and stray canoes, won the cross-lake
swim, feature of Lake Sports held at
Lagunita Saturday. Walt Brown was
a close second, followed by Kline and
Babson.
Alexander and Solomon grappled
ineffectually against Fall and Heller
in the canoe-tilting contest for half
an hour without being able to deter
mine who were the better men. The
suspense was growing unbearable
when Tom Thurlow, headmaster ex
officio etc., ruled that the first pair
to be spilled would be considered
vanquished. The S.A.E. pair got their
heads together, and instead of trying
to push their opponents over, Solo
mon Jumped into the water and over
turned Fall and Heller, leaving Alex
ander afloat .and victorious.
"Whitey" Burns and A1 Cook won
the canoe race over Fall and Thrond
son, last year's champions, after a big
tangle occurred at the first float.
Some trouble was experienced in
running off the Swedish Marathon.
The floats were crowded, so the boys
were a bit backward about starting
when their turns came. The juniors
nnd sophomores were particularly
hesitant, and slowed things down by
their polite insistence on not jumping
the gun. The frosh won with little
effort, but unanimously voted that
the honors should go to the sopho
mores, as they had been so courteous
nnd reticent.
