# Our Own Charity

### 
Stanford students have one charity—the Convalescent Home. One
day each year all of us go over to the Home and put in the afternoon
raking, cutting, hoeing, and cleaning, doing what it would take a few
men hired for the labor some time to accomplish. And again, once each
year we all contribute an infinitesimal sum which goes toward the
general expenses of giving these children the care they need.
Eight years ago, a few helpless children were taken to the old
Stanford residence and given a modicum of help. Since then two units
have been added to the Home and a third is under construction. There
are forty-five children being given the best treatment for their various
conditions it is possible to give. This costs money, for nurses, cooks,
food, and equipment must all be paid for.

We have set $3500 as the sum to be given by the Student Body this
year. Today is the day this money will be collected. It means just a
bit more than one dollar from each student. The girls have undertaken
to contribute three dollars apiece, and the men, one dollar. This means,
for the men, abstinence from the movies for about two nights.
If each of us could see the children as they go into the home, then
sec them as they come out, healthy, happy, and well-nourished, not one
would refuse to give all his pocketbook could stand. Ihe good these
dollars will do cannot be estimated. But certainly the sense of satisfac
tion in knowing that we have contributed toward bringing health to
these youngsters will much more than repay for staying home and
studying a couple of nights.
