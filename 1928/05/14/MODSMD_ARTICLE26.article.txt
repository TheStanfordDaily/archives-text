# Give Them a Chance

It's about time to do a little weeping on people's shoulders again
about this business of not allowing Stanford plays and operas and such
to take short trips of some kind and test the local talent on other stages.
Debating teams, football, track, and other athletic teams, the Glee Club,
and others, are allowed to move off the campus a little. Why not the
plays?
Director, student actors, stage designers, and property people, work
for weeks to put a show in shape, and it is all over in two or three hours.
Their work is displayed before an audience of people, most of whom are
personally acquainted with some one or several of the actors. Obviously,
such an audience is more disposed to be pleased at the performances.
What the students need are audiences that are foreign, that will judge a
play and its characters on their own merits, and not on personal friend
ship.
It is objected principally that this is publicity for the University that
is not desirable. When, may we ask, has a play been put on here of the
type that would be undesirable publicity for Stanford? Perhaps some
are not so good, but it wouldn't be necessary to take every play away;
merely the best one or two during a year. As to publicity, if we must
look at it from that point of view, it would seem that it is desirable to
show people that Stanford is interested in some things other than
championship football teams. It is complained that there is too much
stress put on athletics. Why not, then, give dramatics and some of the
other things a little stress?
