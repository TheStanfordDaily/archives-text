# Feminist Movement in China
## 
### 
China's wars may come and go, but so frequent are they that only a
part of the population is really involved at one time. Hence, they still
have plenty of time to worry about such trivial affairs as the theatre. For
years, nay centuries, women have been barred from the stage in China,
and men have taken their parts. Now, however, we notice the women
are breaking into drama.
But the public will not accept them as women. They must imper
sonate the men, with their falsetto sing-song renditions, who have so
long taken the feminine leads. This is, of course, quite natural, for the
Chinese plays are formalistic in the extreme, as anyone who has paid a
visit to the theatre on Grant Avenue, in San Francisco, or studied the
old "No" plays, can testify.
Natural though it may be, it is curious that men should prefer to have
the women act as men themselves act in impersonating the women. It is
even necessary for the actresses who would make the most of their
profession to study under well-known actors who have starred in the
female roles. One actress uses this point as one of her most effective
advertising schemes.
Perhaps it will not be long, however, before this reaction is over
come, and the sex element will be just as crudely exploited in China as
it commonly is on our own stage and screcti.
