# FORMAL 1928 REPLICA OF LOUIS XIV'S COURT IS SETTING FOR PROM
## 
### 
In a softly lighted, richly decorated,
strictly formal 1928 replica of one of
the court rooms of Louis XIV, the
junior class held its annual Prome
nade last Friday night. The Pavilion
was disguised perfectly.
There were many unique features
about this year's Prom, and perhaps
the most conspicuous was the pres
ence of countless chairs for the dance
weary to sit on, without the usual un
successful search which accompanies
most campus dances.
Then, too, another most remarkably
unusual note in the Prom was the
fact that Professor Treat, one of the
chaperones, was actually asked for
ten cents by the liveried Marquis des
Hats and Coats, and his consternation
almost conquered his characteristic
"savoir faire" on discovering that he
had left all his money at home.
Thanks to an obliging A.T.0., how
ever, Professor Treat recovered his
equinamity, and later his hat.
Help Stanford's Own!
