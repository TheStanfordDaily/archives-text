NEW YORK, N.Y., May 13— (1.P.)
—Displacing the present curriculum
of twenty years' standing, a revised 1
plan of undergraduate study will go i
into effect next September at Colum- ]
bia University. The first two years
will be devoted to "orientation and
discovery," and the junior and senior j
years will be given to genuine work 1
in preparation for graduate or pro
fessional study. The new plan in- i
eludes lecture courses demanding
neither prerequisites nor examina- j
tions.
