# FRESHMEN-JUNIORS TIE IN SPECTACULAR POLO GAME HERE SATURDAY
## Spills, Runaway, Fine Hitting By Gilbreath, Gorham Feature Meet 
### 
In an exciting, tie-score game the
freshman polo team made its final
appearance of the season Saturday
morning when it played the junior
team before a crowd which filled one
side of the field.
Two spills, one runaway, and some
spectacular hitting on the part of
Gilbreath and Gorham brought the
spectators to their feet a score of
times. The 1931 men, who outplayed
their seniors with some pretty team
work, led them by a score of 3-2 at
the beginning of the fourth chukker.
"When the period started off it looked
like an easy win for the frosh until
Gilbreath lost his mount, was up again
on another horse, and broke a stirrup
which put him out of the play for
good. Handicapped by the loss of a
man, the freshmen weakened and Les
Arps shot a goal to tie the score 3-3.
"Curly" Revell started the scoring
in the first chukker for the juniors.
They got the ball down into the fresh
man territory at the beginning of the
next period and things were looking
pretty dark for the frosh when Gil
breath carried the ball the length of
the field for a goal.
The same thing happened again,
Gilbreath driving the ball clear down
along the sideboards and then cutting
in from a difficult angle for the goal
which tied score. Gorham acciden
tally made a goal for his opponents
in the same period, but redeemed
himself in the next when he put the
freshmen into the lead with another
scoring hit.
