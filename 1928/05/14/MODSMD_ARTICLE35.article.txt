Trader Horn, in his most garrulous
moments, never told of an ivory deal
in Africa that could compare with the
one in which Clialmer Cissell was
bought from the White Sox. There
had been high-priced pieces of ivory
before this —Willie Kamm and Jimmy
O'Connell, for instance — but when the
management of the South Side Park
in the Windy City announced that the
star short-stop of the Portland (Ore.)
club had been purchased for $123,000,
it made old-timers blink with amaze
ment and the shade of Old King Kelly
turn over in his grave.
Cissell, like Caesar, came to the big
leagues, saw what it was all about, and
conquered, if his work in spring train
ing and the first month of the season
can be taken as a criteron. On the

opening day, in liis first official major j
league as a White Sox Rookie, he
made two errors, but grabbed three |
hits, and the fans placed their stamp
of approval on him. Since then, his j
batting has steadily improved, until, on
May 2nd, his name appeared among I
the published list of leading five bat
ters in the American league.
Some critics have gon so far as to
compare this rookie to Larry Doyle,
just as they have compared Tony Laz
zeri to Larry Lajoie. Like Doyle, the
former Giant second baseman, Cissell
has a very happy disposition, is loose, 1
fast, and throws without effort or lost j
motion. If he develops into as good a
short-fielder as another famous ex-1
Portland player, Charley Comisky can
have no kick coming. Yes, I mean
Dave Bancroft.
