# SPENCER SETS WORLD RECORD IN 400-METER
## International Time Is Tied As Two Coast Marks Are Shattered 
### Gale Wallace 
Captain Bud Spencer today holds
the highest honor the athletic world
can give him —the world's record in
the 400-meter dash. By taking the
lead at the start and increasing it as
he went, the Stanford captain raced
to glory Saturday in the fastest race
ever witnessed in the Stanford Sta
dium, and clipped two-fifths of a sec
ond from the record held by Ted
Meredith since 1916 of 47 2-5 seconds.
To Attend National Tryouts

In the attempt to demonstrate his
ability as a 400-meter runner, Spencer
fully justified his supporters' hopes
in the Pacific Association Olympic
Games trials here. His sensational
race qualifies him for a berth on the
aggregation of track and field men to
go to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for
the national tryouts on July 6 and 7.

The 400-meter distance translated
is 437 44-100 yards. Had Spencer been
timed at 440 yards he would undoubt
edly have accomplished another feat
and taken Ted Meredith's other cher
ished record. Johnny Morrison came
close to tying the shattered time by
placing second.
Besides seeing a new world's time
made, the spectators saw another in-
ternational mark tied, and two Pacific
Coast performances shattered.
Leistner Equals Record
Hugo ("Swede") Leistner, former
Stanford intercollegiate champion and
now competing for the Olympic Club,
equalled the time of Earl Thomas of
Dartmouth, in the 100-meter hurdles
of 14 4-5 seconds. Bob Kelley, also of
the Olympic Club, sent his old Coast
mark in the hop, step, and jump tot
tering to leap 48 feet IVz inches.
Kim Dyer, Cardinal broad jumper,
went a bit better and leaped 24 feet
10 7-8 inches to make a new Coast
performance. His teammate, Fred
Zombro, was second with a jump of
23 feet 8 inches.
Ward Edmonds pole vaulted 13 feet
to win the event. Later in the trials
he attempted 14 feet 2 inches, but
failed to go over the bar. He easily
made 13 feet 6 inches in preparing
for the 14 feet 2 inches trials.
Freshmen Take Honors
The Stanford freshmen came!
through with honors. Dyer was third
in the 100-meter dash. McDermott, a
teammate, was third in the second

Captain Bud Spencer today holds
the highest honor the athletic world
can give him —the world's record in
the 400-meter dash. By taking the
lead at the start and increasing it as
he went, the Stanford captain raced
to glory Saturday in the fastest race
ever witnessed in the Stanford Sta
dium, and clipped two-fifths of a sec
ond from the record held by Ted
Meredith since 1916 of 47 2-5 seconds.
To Attend National Tryouts

In the attempt to demonstrate his
ability as a 400-meter runner, Spencer
fully justified his supporters' hopes
in the Pacific Association Olympic
Games trials here. His sensational
race qualifies him for a berth on the
aggregation of track and field men to
go to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for
the national tryouts on July 6 and 7.

The 400-meter distance translated
is 437 44-100 yards. Had Spencer been
timed at 440 yards he would undoubt
edly have accomplished another feat
and taken Ted Meredith's other cher
ished record. Johnny Morrison came
close to tying the shattered time by
placing second.
Besides seeing a new world's time
made, the spectators saw another in-
ternational mark tied, and two Pacific
Coast performances shattered.
Leistner Equals Record
Hugo ("Swede") Leistner, former
Stanford intercollegiate champion and
now competing for the Olympic Club,
equalled the time of Earl Thomas of
Dartmouth, in the 100-meter hurdles
of 14 4-5 seconds. Bob Kelley, also of
the Olympic Club, sent his old Coast
mark in the hop, step, and jump tot
tering to leap 48 feet IVz inches.
Kim Dyer, Cardinal broad jumper,
went a bit better and leaped 24 feet
10 7-8 inches to make a new Coast
performance. His teammate, Fred
Zombro, was second with a jump of
23 feet 8 inches.
Ward Edmonds pole vaulted 13 feet
to win the event. Later in the trials
he attempted 14 feet 2 inches, but
failed to go over the bar. He easily
made 13 feet 6 inches in preparing
for the 14 feet 2 inches trials.
Freshmen Take Honors
The Stanford freshmen came!
through with honors. Dyer was third
in the 100-meter dash. McDermott, a
teammate, was third in the second
heat, but failed to place in the finals.
Austin, Card frosh. jumped twenty
one times to conquer Coggeshall of
the Olympic Club, for second place
in the high jump. Bob King was first
in this event.

at the cost of $00,000, liave been com
pleted at the University of Hawaii.
Captain Bud Spencer today holds
the highest honor the athletic world
can give him —the world's record in
the 400-meter dash. By taking the
lead at the start and increasing it as
he went, the Stanford captain raced
to glory Saturday in the fastest race
ever witnessed in the Stanford Sta
dium, and clipped two-fifths of a sec
ond from the record held by Ted
Meredith since 1916 of 47 2-5 seconds.
To Attend National Tryouts

In the attempt to demonstrate his
ability as a 400-meter runner, Spencer
fully justified his supporters' hopes
in the Pacific Association Olympic
Games trials here. His sensational
race qualifies him for a berth on the
aggregation of track and field men to
go to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for
the national tryouts on July 6 and 7.

The 400-meter distance translated
is 437 44-100 yards. Had Spencer been
timed at 440 yards he would undoubt
edly have accomplished another feat
and taken Ted Meredith's other cher
ished record. Johnny Morrison came
close to tying the shattered time by
placing second.
Besides seeing a new world's time
made, the spectators saw another in-
ternational mark tied, and two Pacific
Coast performances shattered.
Leistner Equals Record
Hugo ("Swede") Leistner, former
Stanford intercollegiate champion and
now competing for the Olympic Club,
equalled the time of Earl Thomas of
Dartmouth, in the 100-meter hurdles
of 14 4-5 seconds. Bob Kelley, also of
the Olympic Club, sent his old Coast
mark in the hop, step, and jump tot
tering to leap 48 feet IVz inches.
Kim Dyer, Cardinal broad jumper,
went a bit better and leaped 24 feet
10 7-8 inches to make a new Coast
performance. His teammate, Fred
Zombro, was second with a jump of
23 feet 8 inches.
Ward Edmonds pole vaulted 13 feet
to win the event. Later in the trials
he attempted 14 feet 2 inches, but
failed to go over the bar. He easily
made 13 feet 6 inches in preparing
for the 14 feet 2 inches trials.
Freshmen Take Honors
The Stanford freshmen came!
through with honors. Dyer was third
in the 100-meter dash. McDermott, a
teammate, was third in the second
heat, but failed to place in the finals.

Help Stanford's Own!
New engineering units, constructed
at the cost of $00,000, liave been com
pleted at the University of Hawaii.
Captain Bud Spencer today holds
the highest honor the athletic world
can give him —the world's record in
the 400-meter dash. By taking the
lead at the start and increasing it as
he went, the Stanford captain raced
to glory Saturday in the fastest race
ever witnessed in the Stanford Sta
dium, and clipped two-fifths of a sec
ond from the record held by Ted
Meredith since 1916 of 47 2-5 seconds.
To Attend National Tryouts

In the attempt to demonstrate his
ability as a 400-meter runner, Spencer
fully justified his supporters' hopes
in the Pacific Association Olympic
Games trials here. His sensational
race qualifies him for a berth on the
aggregation of track and field men to
go to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for
the national tryouts on July 6 and 7.

The 400-meter distance translated
is 437 44-100 yards. Had Spencer been
timed at 440 yards he would undoubt
edly have accomplished another feat
and taken Ted Meredith's other cher
ished record. Johnny Morrison came
close to tying the shattered time by
placing second.
Besides seeing a new world's time
made, the spectators saw another in-
ternational mark tied, and two Pacific
Coast performances shattered.
Leistner Equals Record
Hugo ("Swede") Leistner, former
Stanford intercollegiate champion and
now competing for the Olympic Club,
equalled the time of Earl Thomas of
Dartmouth, in the 100-meter hurdles
of 14 4-5 seconds. Bob Kelley, also of
the Olympic Club, sent his old Coast
mark in the hop, step, and jump tot
tering to leap 48 feet IVz inches.
Kim Dyer, Cardinal broad jumper,
went a bit better and leaped 24 feet
10 7-8 inches to make a new Coast
performance. His teammate, Fred
Zombro, was second with a jump of
23 feet 8 inches.
Ward Edmonds pole vaulted 13 feet
to win the event. Later in the trials
he attempted 14 feet 2 inches, but
failed to go over the bar. He easily
made 13 feet 6 inches in preparing
for the 14 feet 2 inches trials.
Freshmen Take Honors
The Stanford freshmen came!
through with honors. Dyer was third
in the 100-meter dash. McDermott, a
teammate, was third in the second
heat, but failed to place in the finals.

made, the spectators saw another in-
ternational mark tied, and two Pacific

the Olympic Club, sent his old Coast
mark in the hop, step, and jump tot
tering to leap 48 feet IVz inches.

10 7-8 inches to make a new Coast
performance. His teammate, Fred
Zombro, was second with a jump of
23 feet 8 inches.
Ward Edmonds pole vaulted 13 feet

the highest honor the athletic world
can give him —the world's record in
the 400-meter dash. By taking the
lead at the start and increasing it as

In the attempt to demonstrate his
ability as a 400-meter runner, Spencer
