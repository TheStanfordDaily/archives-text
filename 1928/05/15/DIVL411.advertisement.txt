Gentlemen:
This morning I had a smoking ad
venture worth recording.
Next to me in the smoking car a
gentleman was puffing his pipe con
tentedly. I was not smoking at the
moment, and the aroma of his tobacco
intrigued me exceedingly. For twelve
years I had smoked Edgeworth with
out being tempted by any other brand,
but the fragrance emanating from the
pipe of the gentleman beside me was
so agreeable that 1 could not resist
the temptation to speak of it.
"That is wonderfully fragrant to
bacco you have there," I remarked.
"Would you mind telling me the name
of it?"
"It is Edgeworth," he answered.
We then congratulated each other
upon our mutual good taste, and I
decided that I would continue to use
his brand and mine.
Sincerely yours,
S. H.
