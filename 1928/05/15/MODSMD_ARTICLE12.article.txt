# FIFTEEN COMPRISE TRACK DELEGATION TO EASTERN MEET
## Pressure of Study Prevents West From Going With Card I.C.-4A. Team 
### Bob Speers 
Coach Dink Templeton has selected
fifteen men to comprise the Stanford
track and field, or rather field and
! track, team at the national intercol
j legiates at Cambridge next week.
Ross Nichols, Eric Krenz, A1 For
( ster, Harlow Rothert, Herbert Fleish
! hacker, Bil Sparling, Leo Kibby, Tom
i Joaquin, Fred Zombro, Kim Dyer,
Ward Edmonds, and Bob King are
the ones who will leave Friday for
Andover, Mass., along with Dink and
I Track Manager Murray Draper. Cap
tain Spencer, John Morrison, and
Henry Coe left Sunday for the East.
West Will Not Go
Clarence West, who was considered
a sure point-winner in the low hur
dles, will be unable to accompany the
team because of the pressure of his
work in the School of Business Ad
ministration. "Westy" took two points
last year. Probably Dink would drag
West along if he thought he would
be needed to assure Stanford's win
ning the meet, but happily it looks
as if things are going to come the
Cardinal way this year notwithstand
ing.
The team will arrive at Andover on
Tuesday, May 22; it will practice on
Wednesday at the Phillips-Andover
Academy track on Wednesday, lay off
Thursday, and participate in the trials
on Friday. The finals in all events
will be held Saturday in the Harvard
stadium.
Six Veterans on Squad
This year's squad has six veterans
who accounted for 15% of the total
36y 2 points by which Stanford won
the 1927 championship. Last year
Dyer took one in the broad jump and
Zombro two; Edmonds three in the
pole vault; Forsters three in the dis
cus; Nichols three in the hurdles;
and King 3V 2 in the high jump. Spen
cer, it wil be remembered, failed to
qualify in the quarter.
Men who competed last year but
who won't be in the meet next week
are: Biff Hoffman, nine points; Ted
Shipkey, three points; Taffy Evans,
two points; Sid Meeks, three points;
Alex McKinnon, two points; and
Clarence West, two points.
Alex McKinnon dropped track after
the Big Meet, Templeton having de
cided that laying off is the best thing
for the little miler, whose season was
not as successful this year as last.
Dink counts on McKinnon's coming
back strong next year, and considers
the best way to insure this is to give
him a complete rest.

and King 3V 2 in the high jump. Spen
cer, it wil be remembered, failed to
qualify in the quarter.
Men who competed last year but
who won't be in the meet next week
are: Biff Hoffman, nine points; Ted
Shipkey, three points; Taffy Evans,
two points; Sid Meeks, three points;
Alex McKinnon, two points; and
Clarence West, two points.
Alex McKinnon dropped track after
the Big Meet, Templeton having de
cided that laying off is the best thing
for the little miler, whose season was
not as successful this year as last.
Dink counts on McKinnon's coming
back strong next year, and considers
the best way to insure this is to give
him a complete rest.
Coach Dink Templeton has selected
fifteen men to comprise the Stanford
track and field, or rather field and
! track, team at the national intercol
j legiates at Cambridge next week.
Ross Nichols, Eric Krenz, A1 For
( ster, Harlow Rothert, Herbert Fleish
! hacker, Bil Sparling, Leo Kibby, Tom
i Joaquin, Fred Zombro, Kim Dyer,
Ward Edmonds, and Bob King are
the ones who will leave Friday for
Andover, Mass., along with Dink and
I Track Manager Murray Draper. Cap
tain Spencer, John Morrison, and
Henry Coe left Sunday for the East.
West Will Not Go
Clarence West, who was considered
a sure point-winner in the low hur
dles, will be unable to accompany the
team because of the pressure of his
work in the School of Business Ad
ministration. "Westy" took two points
last year. Probably Dink would drag
West along if he thought he would
be needed to assure Stanford's win
ning the meet, but happily it looks
as if things are going to come the
Cardinal way this year notwithstand
ing.
The team will arrive at Andover on
Tuesday, May 22; it will practice on
Wednesday at the Phillips-Andover
Academy track on Wednesday, lay off
Thursday, and participate in the trials
on Friday. The finals in all events
will be held Saturday in the Harvard
stadium.
Six Veterans on Squad
This year's squad has six veterans
who accounted for 15% of the total
36y 2 points by which Stanford won
the 1927 championship. Last year
Dyer took one in the broad jump and
Zombro two; Edmonds three in the
pole vault; Forsters three in the dis
cus; Nichols three in the hurdles;
and King 3V 2 in the high jump. Spen
