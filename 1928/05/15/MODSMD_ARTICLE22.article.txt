# MANY GROUPS HAVE SUBSCRIBED QUOTA, DRIVE REPORT INDICATES
## Rally Committee Votes to Donate $250 to Annual Stanford Charity Convalescent Home Campaign Will Continue Until Tomorrow Morning 
### 
The Rally Committee last night
presented $250 to the Convale
scent Home Drive. This amount
was made on the Masque Ball
given the first of Spring Quarter.
Reports from the Finance Commit
tee of the Convalescent Home Drive
indicate that many of the living
groups filled their quotas yesterday
in the first day of the student appeal
for $3500 for "Stanford's Own" char
ity.
Although many houses and clubs
have responded admirably to the one
call for student charity that is given
during the year, there are a number
of living groups on the campus that
have not yet filled their quotas. The
individual contribution from each
man is $1, and most of the men's
living groups have responded to this
call.
There are some houses which have
turned in no reports at all, and some
of the women's houses have not com
pleted the individual quota set for the
women, that is, $3 apiece.
The Drive will continue today, and
probably tomorrow. The treasurers in
the living groups will continue col
lecting their contributions until the
respective quotas are filled. It is the
hope of the chairmen of the Drive
that each student in the University
will respond to the call for "Stanford's
Own" charity.
The reports from a few of the liv
ing groups are: Roble, $330.80 (in
complete); Men's Halls (incomplete);
El Campo, $33.00; Breakers, $11.50;
El Cuadro, $24.00; Sequoia, $101.00;
Los Arcos, $43.00; El Tigre, $18.00;
El Toro, $34.00; Fraternities (incom
plete); Chi Omega, $45.00; Alpha
Omicron Pi, $70.00; Delta Gamma,
$66.00; Sigma Kappa, $25.00; Kappa
Kappa Gamma, $149.50.
