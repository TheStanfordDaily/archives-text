# Vote With a Purpose
## 
### 
Today the men and women of the Student Body may vote for next
year's leaders. In the general election there are all class offices, the Student
Body president and vice-president, secretary of the A.S.S.U., student mem
ber of the Board of Athletic Control, junior and graduate members of the
Executive Committee, and three members of the Men's Council.
Every so often there comes a kick from some one or some group of
dissatisfied students about how the Men's Council, or the Executive Com
mittee, or some other body or officer handles the affairs over which that
body or person is given jurisdiction. These fault-findings often have a good
basis, and often do not. But if students will vote "intelligently" and work
for the men they know are competent, omitting political rings and see
sawing, they will find the causes for complaint much diminished.
If the Student Body and each individual member doesn't care enough
to go to the polls today and vote for the people they firmly believe can do
the best work, they don't deserve to have competent government.
What we want in each office are men who have had experience along
the same lines as the office to which they aspire. These jobs are not honor
ary degrees, to be meted out because so-and-so is a fine fellow, or because
he has worked like the deuce to win a letter (although this may be good
evidence of competency), or because he has supported some member of a
given political group in the past. Politics, in the boss-and-clique sense, are
at best a joke in college.
Look over the list of candidates. Find out what they've done, how
familiar they are with past affairs in the Student Body, whether or not
they are interested in the job merely as an honor, or if they will consider
they have a duty to perform. You can tell. Vote yourself, not as Bill Jones
dictates.
