# The 						Independent Way

Elsewhere in this issue there are described the commendable efforts of
the Committee on Independent Study to make known the nature of the
Independent Study Plan and to enlist desirable students to study under it.
Last week, we pointed out that one of the reasons for the lack of
interest in independent study is the fact that few students know much
about it. Only when one's friends or acquaintances are working in a
certain department does study in that department become a reality to one.
Similarly with the independent study plan—but ten or so have pursued
their work under it up until now; consequently the other 3400 students in
the University lack direct ideas concerning it.
Professor Edgar E. Robinson, acting chairman of the committee ad
ministering the plan, has a pertinent statement to make regarding the
scheme:
"As the Upper Division becomes more and more the center of atten
tion here at Stanford, it seems probable that greater emphasis will be
given the method whereby the exceptional man or woman will be given this
unusual opportunity (i.e., that of the Independent Study Plan) in prepara
tion for business, professional, or graduate work. Thus far it has had
perhaps its greatest attraction for men and women seeking what used to
be called 'a liberal education,' for it is just that—education worthy of a
'free man.' The student who is here for serious work finds in this plan
the possibility of freeing himself from a great deal of elementary work,
of planning a two-year program in advance, and of doing in that time a
higher grade of work, as high indeed as his ability permits. He does it in
a way Ipest calculated to prepare him for later tasks, that is, by independent
study, where initiative and originality and concentrated effort count for
most. It puts upon him, as class work, even seminar class work, can never
do, the primary task of his later life, that is, of 'making his own way.' "
