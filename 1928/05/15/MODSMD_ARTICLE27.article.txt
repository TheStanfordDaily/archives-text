Somebody has an awfully poor sense of the appropriate. Yesterday
just at noon the campus was hooted, tooted, and sirened at by much blaring
of whistles and horns. We all rushed to doors, windows, and other points
of vantage to see what kind of a fire, or circus, was happening. There
were two cars, carrying blatant banners, some nurses, and some children
from the Convalescent Home.
Such tactics are fine stuff for Rarnum and Bailey, but they hardly hit
the spot in an appeal for charity. We're all for getting money for the
llome, but "suppose it were your little sister?" Would you want her to
be set in the tonneau of an automobile and paraded around the campus as
an example of what good a few dollars could do?
People don't mind giving a reasonable sum of money for a worthy
purpose, if they can see they are not wasting it, and can afford to do so.
But they don't like to be tooted at. Perhaps, during the War, when there
were big human interest drives, this method was necessary, but it wasn't
in the present instance.

Krishnamurti, young Hindu prophet, is credited with the statement
that he has no use for women because he is sated with love affairs occurring
in another existence.
Heh, heh.

There will be a meeting of the Editorial Staff of the Daily at 1 o'clock
in the ofTice.
