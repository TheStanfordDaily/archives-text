BANALITIES IN OUR SECONDARY
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
In the land of Colorado, immortal
ized by the snow-capped mountains
and popularized by ex-Judge Ben
Lindsay, lived a little girl by the
name of Rosalie. Rosalie, being at
that stage of life, was a high school
girl. In her town, Walsenburg by
name, all the little high school girls,
by dictum of the worthy county
school committee, must dress just
alike during school hours. A plain
white cotton middie with not more
than three straight rows of braid on
the collar and sleeves, a black tie,
and a navy blue skirt. That, and noth
ing more —externally, at least.
One day last November our heroine
presented herself at the local educa
tional factory dressed but "not ac
cording to rules." Whether she came
so attired because of aesthetic prin
ciples, because she was tired of the
uniform, or because of mere feminine
obstinacy, our Associated Press dis
patch does not say. The point is,
whatever her reason, she was not ad
mitted. Now the case is pending be
fore the supreme court.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
Her father, in his petition, is be
sieged by doubts. He is "unable to
understand why a child wearing a
middie having three straight rows of
braid thereon shall be a better stu
dent in algebra, geometry, chemistry,
or Latin than one wearing six rows
of braid." You are quite correct, Mr.
Lamme. Only the girl who has enough
courage to revolt against the persist
ent tendency in our modern life to
reduce everybody and everything to
the same common, drab likeness,
probably is miles ahead of her fellow
students in mental capacities.
We are uninformed on the history
of school uniforms, except for the one
fact that the idea received a great
impetus during the hystero-moronic
days of the late war. The plan has
been fairly widely adopted, at least
in California. The argument for uni
form dress in the high school is valid
as far as it goes, and, like blanket
phrases, satisfies the average blanket

thinking populace. The uniforms are
supposed to be cheaper; they pro
mote democracy—the girl with money
can't outshine her more humble sis
ter; and, it has been said, that they
take the girls' minds off dressing.
And so thousands of high school girls,
one hardly distinguishable from the
other, go to school each day, and the
babbitts, the school boards, the home
missionary "societies, and other un
imaginative organizations without
end feel that a good thing has been
done. The great American leveling
process rolls on.
REAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED
We hope that the Colorado court
decides that Rosalie doesn't have to
dress like everybody else if she does
not choose to do so. There are two
real principles involved. First, it is
carrying democracy too far. It almost
seems like a conspiracy on the part
of the average-minded to reduce the
world to their own limited dimensions.
It is dreadful enough to be told
what you can drink and what you
cannot drink, but to be told that your
daughter must go attired in a drab
and colorless fashion during the years
when she should be learning the art
of dress is too much. Individualists,
arise from your sleep.
In the second place, there is the
aesthetic element, which lies tram
pled in the dust as usual. Our Ameri
can educational system could hardly
do more to kill imagination and
creative interest if it tried, and the
case at point is one of the worst of
fenders against these twin virtues.
HOLD PROGRESS BACK
We think this tendency to exult
sameness and the "average" in our
American life should be vigorously
deplored. Our magazines and news
papers, which are always spending
money to find the average person for
this thing and that, aren't getting the
world ahead very fast. We are in
tensely interested in the future pos
sibilities of civilization, which possi
bilities will be achieved by the excep
tion, not the average. As one writer
has said, "All the average person has
to do with progress is to hold it
back." —Jack Springer.

HOLD PROGRESS BACK
We think this tendency to exult
sameness and the "average" in our
American life should be vigorously
deplored. Our magazines and news
papers, which are always spending
money to find the average person for
this thing and that, aren't getting the
world ahead very fast. We are in
tensely interested in the future pos
sibilities of civilization, which possi
bilities will be achieved by the excep
tion, not the average. As one writer
has said, "All the average person has
to do with progress is to hold it
back." —Jack Springer.
BANALITIES IN OUR SECONDARY
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
In the land of Colorado, immortal
ized by the snow-capped mountains
and popularized by ex-Judge Ben
Lindsay, lived a little girl by the
name of Rosalie. Rosalie, being at
that stage of life, was a high school
girl. In her town, Walsenburg by
name, all the little high school girls,
by dictum of the worthy county
school committee, must dress just
alike during school hours. A plain
white cotton middie with not more
than three straight rows of braid on
the collar and sleeves, a black tie,
and a navy blue skirt. That, and noth
ing more —externally, at least.
One day last November our heroine
presented herself at the local educa
tional factory dressed but "not ac
cording to rules." Whether she came
so attired because of aesthetic prin
ciples, because she was tired of the
uniform, or because of mere feminine
obstinacy, our Associated Press dis
patch does not say. The point is,
whatever her reason, she was not ad
mitted. Now the case is pending be
fore the supreme court.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE
Her father, in his petition, is be
sieged by doubts. He is "unable to
understand why a child wearing a
middie having three straight rows of
braid thereon shall be a better stu
dent in algebra, geometry, chemistry,
or Latin than one wearing six rows
of braid." You are quite correct, Mr.
Lamme. Only the girl who has enough
courage to revolt against the persist
ent tendency in our modern life to
reduce everybody and everything to
the same common, drab likeness,
probably is miles ahead of her fellow
students in mental capacities.
We are uninformed on the history
of school uniforms, except for the one
fact that the idea received a great
impetus during the hystero-moronic
days of the late war. The plan has
been fairly widely adopted, at least
in California. The argument for uni
form dress in the high school is valid
as far as it goes, and, like blanket
phrases, satisfies the average blanket

thinking populace. The uniforms are
supposed to be cheaper; they pro
mote democracy—the girl with money
can't outshine her more humble sis
ter; and, it has been said, that they
take the girls' minds off dressing.
And so thousands of high school girls,
one hardly distinguishable from the
other, go to school each day, and the
babbitts, the school boards, the home
missionary "societies, and other un
imaginative organizations without
end feel that a good thing has been
done. The great American leveling
process rolls on.
REAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED
We hope that the Colorado court
decides that Rosalie doesn't have to
dress like everybody else if she does
not choose to do so. There are two
real principles involved. First, it is
carrying democracy too far. It almost
seems like a conspiracy on the part
of the average-minded to reduce the
world to their own limited dimensions.
It is dreadful enough to be told
what you can drink and what you
cannot drink, but to be told that your
daughter must go attired in a drab
and colorless fashion during the years
when she should be learning the art
of dress is too much. Individualists,
arise from your sleep.
In the second place, there is the
aesthetic element, which lies tram

And so thousands of high school girls,
one hardly distinguishable from the
other, go to school each day, and the
babbitts, the school boards, the home
missionary "societies, and other un
imaginative organizations without
end feel that a good thing has been
done. The great American leveling
process rolls on.
REAL PRINCIPLES INVOLVED
We hope that the Colorado court
decides that Rosalie doesn't have to
dress like everybody else if she does
not choose to do so. There are two
real principles involved. First, it is
carrying democracy too far. It almost
seems like a conspiracy on the part
of the average-minded to reduce the
world to their own limited dimensions.
It is dreadful enough to be told
what you can drink and what you
cannot drink, but to be told that your
daughter must go attired in a drab
and colorless fashion during the years
when she should be learning the art
of dress is too much. Individualists,
arise from your sleep.
In the second place, there is the
aesthetic element, which lies tram
pled in the dust as usual. Our Ameri
can educational system could hardly
do more to kill imagination and
creative interest if it tried, and the
case at point is one of the worst of
fenders against these twin virtues.
HOLD PROGRESS BACK
We think this tendency to exult
sameness and the "average" in our
American life should be vigorously
deplored. Our magazines and news
papers, which are always spending
money to find the average person for
this thing and that, aren't getting the
world ahead very fast. We are in
tensely interested in the future pos
sibilities of civilization, which possi
bilities will be achieved by the excep
tion, not the average. As one writer
has said, "All the average person has
to do with progress is to hold it
back." —Jack Springer.
