"The Rampant Age," Robert S. Carr.
Doubleday, Doran & Co.
We are so used to being "exposed"
ourselves that it is distinctly shock
ing to learn that the morals of the
actual Younger Generation —the high
school crowd —are bad and interest
ing enough to merit a novel about
them. Written by an eighteen-year-old
boy, "The Rampant Age" presents
our juniors in much the same manner
Percy Marks pictured is in "The
Plastic Age."
Carr's obvious attempt to be
sensational is deplorable. He was
probably influenced by Professor
Marks' style, for there is much in
common between the two. We prefer
"The Rampant Age" of the two
stories, for while the wildness is as
predominant, it is truer to life.
Carr will horrify many of his readers
because he goes into details about
the drinking and petting parties
staged by high school students. Yet
it is absurd to say that the book is
exaggerated beyond all proportions.
The majority of high school students
do not run wild, but as Carr says,
"the good, solid background serves
to bring the smaller, more erratic
foreground into great prominence."
The author's theme is that familiar
friend —the revolt of modern youth,
but in confining himself entirely to
the high school crowd he achieves
originality. His conversation is excel
lent, his characters nicely drawn, and
his plot interesting. He is much dis
turbed about the prevalence of "neck
ing," and at one point dissertates in
this wise:
"Necking, the piece de resistance of I
every date, varied widely according
to the girl; with the aid of a few well
time slaps Paul learned to shift his
emotional gears quickly from one
night to another. The vast majority
of the free-dating, white, high school
girls necked mildly on the defensive
up to a certain point. There they
stopped, with a quiet, firmness you
could not help admiring, or with loud, j
self-righteous dissertations on the ad
vantages of a moral life. Most of them
were like tight-wire walkers. You
wondered, marvelled, that they could
continually hold such a precarious
position without losing their balance
sooner or later, yet hold it they did, j
even if by only the scantiest techni
calities."
There are clever phrases such as j
this: "Doris sat quietly with her I
hands folded in her lap, a faint half- !
smile on her lips, her eyes fixed |

dreamily on space in one of those
beautifully noncommittal states which
girls can achieve on davenports with
boys in dim rooms."
The book is the "epic" of the high
school crowd that babbled the "Clee
jut, clee-jut, ohyesweare cuh-lee-jut!"
refrain. The setting is the Middle
west, the schools and colleges men
tioned being fictitious. Only once does
Carr became specific — when he
eliminates the hero's dumb rival by
graduating the gentleman and send
ing him "out West to Leland Stanford
University in California." The publi
city we appreciate, but surely Carr
knows what kind of students come
here!
"The Rampant Age" is a compara
tively true story of the modern high
school "fast set." You'll recognize
many of the characters and situa
tions, and whi e you may think it
trashy you'll probably enjoy it.
