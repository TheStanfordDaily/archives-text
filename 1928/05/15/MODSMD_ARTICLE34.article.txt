# PRESIDENT RESERVES EVENING TO DISCUSS STUDENTS' PROBLEMS
## 
### 
President Wilbur is setting aside
this evening for discussion of campus
problems with students at his home.
Through student co-operation with Dr.
Wilbur an informal meeting was held
at his home last week, and finding
the discussion mutually beneficial, ar
rangements have been made for a
second such evening.
The meeting, which is open to all
students, will provide an opportunity
for the airing of all opinions about
the conduct of the University and the
answering of questions and problems
confronting students.
The President will be at home after
8 o'clock.
