# COMMITTEE CAMPAIGNS THIS WEEK FOR STUDY PLAN REGISTRATIONS
## University Seeks To Attract Lower Division Students To Proposition 
### 
The Committee on the Independent
Study Plan is making an appreciable
campaign this week to attract Lower
Division students who have shown
good scholastic ability to the Inde
pendent Study Plan for the pursuit
of their Upper Division work. Profes
sor Edgar E. Robinson, chairman pro
tem of the committee, in the absence
of Professor Albert L. Guerard, has
sent a circular letter to desirable
students explaining how the plan
may be adapted to the student's
needs and inviting interested students
to consider the I.S.P. before arrang
ing their Upper Division work.
In an interview with the Daily, Pro
fessor Robinson yesterday gave
something of the history of the move
ment for independent study.
"Last year," he declared, "there
were in the United States upwards
of forty colleges experimenting with
'Reading for Honors,' or, as we term
it at Stanford, the Independent Study
Plan. The most elaborate system and
probably the most effective work has
been at Swarthmore College. Appar
ently, at Swarthmore, the system has
passed beyond the stage of experi
ment. At any rate, it is old enough
to have comments upon it by gradu
ates two or three years out of col
lege.
Plan Thought Successful
"One graduate in his third year at
the Harvard Law School writes:
'Honors work has helped me directly
in my study here, for the Law School
is run on the plan of no examinations

and no marks until the end of the
year. We work entirely on our own
| accord, not being required to attend
I classes, lectures, etc. In meeting con-
I ditions so novel to the ordinary un
dergraduate, I feel sure that honors
j work has benefited me.'
"Another Swarthmore graduate,"
says Professor Robinson, "writes as
follows: 'Honors work has the effect
of making you realize that you do
j not have to take a course in a sub
ject in order to learn something
about it. That was a stupendous dis
j covery to me, and is the buoy that
is keeping me up under the staggering
amount of new study I am forced in
my present position to undertake
without very much guidance. It gives
you a confidence in attacking new
fields that is invaluable."
At Stanford Since 1925
The Independent Study Plan has
existed at Stanford since 1925. Each
year a few men and women have
studied under it, and a half dozen
have now taken their degrees. It is
too early, however, to measure the
results either by their testimony or
that of the members of the faculty
interested. Ten departments have for
mally adopted the plan. It is designed
to cover the work of the Upper Divi
sion only though there is some dis
cussion of applying the plan with
modifications to the Lower Division.

Professor Robinson has set aside
Wednesday as a special day for con
sultation with students desiring to
learn of the plan. He has announced
he will be in his office, 172 Adminis
tration building, from 10 to 12 and
from 2 to 4 o'clock.
