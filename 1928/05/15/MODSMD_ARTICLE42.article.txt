## Tennis Alphabetâ€”A 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
The Alpha's of the Tennis world
are numerous,, and, even though the
letter comes last in the name "U.S.-
L.T.A." (United States Lawn Tennis
Association,) nevertheless the A's
have come first in many an impor
tant tournament. Recently two of
the clan of A have come to the front
in indoor and intercollegiate tour
naments, Bill Aydelotte winning the
national indoor crown last winter and
Wilmer Allison taking the intercol
legiate title back to Texas last fall.
Allison was a member of the United
States Davis Cup team that invaded
Mexico so successfully in April.

Manuel Alonso, the fleet Spaniard,
has long been a dashing and spectac
ular figure on American courts. He
has scored notable victories over rank
ing American players, including Bill
Tilden, and has won many important
tournaments.
The tribe of Anderson is well rep
resented on the tennis courts. J. O.
Anderson, the Australian Davis Cup
player, is the most famous of all. He
helped win the Davis Cup from
England in 1919, and in 1922 and 1923
tried unsuccessfully to win it from
the United States, defeating William
Johnston in a fierce five-set match in
1922. Other Andersons are Fred G.
and his son Fred C., national father
and son champions for several^years.
Fred B. Alexander long played a
prominent part in U. S. tennis history,
and ranked in the first ten off and on
from 1904 to 1924.
Among the ladies, Senorita Alvarez
upon as a "second Suzanne Lenglen"
of Spain is the most prominent, while
Cecilie Aussem of Germany is looked
by many European critics.
