# DAILY STAFF TRAINING TO MEET PRESS NINE
## 
### 
Much encouraged by their fine
showing against the University Press
baseball nine May G, the famed news
venders of the Daily staff have been
wearing out the green turf on the
varsity diamond in strenuous prac
tice sessions lately in preparation for
a return game in the near future. As
sistant Manager Jack Hodges of the
Daily squad reports that gaps in the
infield and outfield are being filled by
members of the editorial board.
In an effort to strengthen the bat
ting department of the typewriter
pounders' union, Hodges tried to
practice seduction of "Babe" Ruth of
the New York Yankees. Ruth was
willing and jumped (leaped, sprang)
at the chance to test his prowess
against Mayrhofer, tricky liurler for
the printers; but Manager Huggins
considers him indispensable to the
pennant chances of the Yanks and
would not grant him a furlough.
Carl Winquist, tosser for the jour
nalists, has been limbering up his
arm during the past week and work
ing on a new fade-away ball that
should baffle the Press men.
