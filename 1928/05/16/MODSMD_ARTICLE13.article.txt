close tonight, according to Bob
j Fraser, chairman of the Finance Com

I from the different living groups have
not come in yet, it is believed that

ed to the call for $1 apiece quite
generously.
Reports from the women's drive i
show that they have raised now about
$1153.75 which is only $247 short of
the quota set for them this year.
No accurate reports of the dona
tions from the fraternities aiul the
halls have been received yet, but if
i each of the treasurers in the various
living groups collect the individual
' quota of $1 and as much more from
i some members as they can give, the
! men's quota of $2,000 will be reached.
As the men's quota represents a very
; small sum from each individual it is
practically assured that it will be
| reached.
