# BROWN, LLOYD WIN MOOT COURT FINALS TO TAKE $200 PRIZE
## 
### 
Leon B. Brown and Edward W.
Lloyd defeated John K. Kaseberg and
Harold L. Peterson in the champion
ship finals of the Moot Court argu
ments held in Room 12 of the Law
Department last night. The winners,
having progressed undefeated through
a series of elimination rounds, will
receive the first prize of $200, donated
by Judge M. C. Sloss of San Francisco.
The case contested by the two
teams turned on the close point of
"the tort liability of public officers
acting under unconstitutional stat
utes." California Supreme Court Jus
tices John E. Richards, John T.
Nourse, and John W. Schenk handed
down the decision. No specific divi
sion of points was made by the bench
in announcing its verdict. Both sides
were complimented for able organiza
tion of their material. The losers will
be presented with copies of "Form
Book of California Practice" by Pro
fessor W. B. Owens of the Law
School.
