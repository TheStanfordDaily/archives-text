## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 15.—(U.P.)—
The Jones-Reid flood control bill be
came a law today when President
Coolidge signed the measure designed
to curb the mighty Mississippi.
It authorized a $325,000,000 appro
priation, part of which will probably
be included in the deficiency bill now
being prepared in the House. How
ever, $10,000,000 to start the work
was released for use as soon as the
President's signature was on the bill.
This will enable the special board
and the Mississippi River Commission
to begin mapping out plans for the
gigantic project, regarded as the
largest engineering feat since the con-
I struction of the Panama Canal.
Additional portions of the author
ized $325,000,000 will be made avail
j able from time to time during the
ten years estimated needed to com
plete the work. Much more than this
amount may be needed before the
project is finished, It is believed.
Before actual work can be started
%
on the building of levees and con
struction of spillways, President Cool
idge must appoint a civilian engineer
to be a member of the control board.
