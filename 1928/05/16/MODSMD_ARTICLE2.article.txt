# SIXTEEN TEAMS SET FOR INITIAL PLAY IN HANDBALL TOURNEY
## 
### 
Sixteen teams have entered the
1928 Handball Doubles Tournament
which will begin today. C. W. Davis,
intramural director, said yesterday
that the first round should be over
by Tuesday, May 22. There is no
award in the tournament, and it has
nothing to do with the intramural
competition. The various teams are
to make arrangements for the times
when they will play. The matches will
be played on the one-wall courts in
the Encina Gymnasium.
The drawings are as follows:
Taekaberry-Sibbett vs. Stevenson-
Duval; Maloney-Sprague vs. Davis-
Yokum; McDermott-Mandell vs.
Walker-Mahy; Masters-Davis vs.
Hamblyn-Odemar; Stein-Paradise vs.
Meyberg-Levit; Brown-Jones vs. G.
White-O. Dunn; Evans-Long vs. De-
Lucchi-Sullivan; Tussing-Liebendorfer
vs. Flickenger-Ashby.
