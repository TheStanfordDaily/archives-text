# TRIO MINGLES SWEET, BRILLIANT SELECTIONS IN MUSICAL PROGRAM
## Violinist, Soprano Please Audience With Concert In Little Theatre 
### Page Bradshaw 
Sweetness was admirably mingled
with brilliance in the well-chosen pro
gram offered in the Little Theatre
last night by Winifred Estabrook,
soprano, Elizabeth Peirce, violinist,
and Mary Elizabeth Moynihan, pian
ist and accompanist.
Ravel's old modern harmony and
wistful appeal in "Piece en forme de
Habanera," played by Miss Peirce,
formed the most unusual number.
Miss Peirce's firm, sweet tone and
sympathetic rendition make her work
especially pleasing. "Minuet" by
Haydn-Friedburg was full of the com
poser's daintiness and charm.
Miss Estabrook showed her clear,
flexible soprano to best advantage in
the lyric melody of "There Is a Gar
den," by Proctor, and in the trio selec
tion, "Si Vous L'Aviez Compris" by
Denza. All three artists gave splen
did execution in the trio "Le Nil" by
Leroux. The last number, "Spring
Song," by Oscar Weil, was a triumph
for the soprano with its wide range
and gay rendition.
