# They've Got The Jobs
## 
### 
Well, most of the bigger jobs were all fixed up yesterday, President,
Vice-President, Secretary, Board of Athletic Control, et al. Now all that
remains to the pot-boiling is a little simmer here and there. The politicians
are to be congratulated this year for the small amount of unnecessary
agitation that accrued the past week or so. This was one of the quietest
and most friendly elections held on the campus in some time. Finals ARE
pretty close.
But as to the new office-holders, may they remember the things they
have kicked alxDut during the reigns of recent bosses. Let them consider
the abuses they have thought were being perpetrated. Let them go into
these matters fully and carefully, fully because the things may actually need
change, and carefully lest they make changes which will be worse than
existing conditions. It is usual that people have many so-called constructive
ideas when they want a job, but seem to lose those ideas, or their vitality,
or their initiative, or something, after they have got the job. But it is also
true that there are many who go into an office and consider it merely as a
good club to use in effecting personal prestige, or run wild with reforms
that don't mean a thing.
We don't expect any of these officers to do any of the oh so onerous
things mentioned above, but 'tis well for them to keep in mind that maybe
they can keep the ball rolling a little more smoothly, small though their
actual power may be.
