Following is a news-editorial item taken verbatim from Time. It is
given, not much for its facts, but for its gullible treatment. Someone
wrote an article in The Stanford Illustrated Review, stating that it was
all a mistake about the Kappa romance. The writer quoted Lou Henry as
saying that the truth was much more fascinating and romantic. Anyway,
this isn't all about Hoover:
FRAT MEN
Fraternity-pinned chests swelled with pride at a piece in the
"Magazine of Sigma Chi," by its editor, one Chester W. Cleveland.
"Today," wrote Brother Cleveland, "fraternity folk pretty much
direct the affairs of the nation. The White House is 100 per cent
Greek letter, with President Coolidge flying the royal purple of Phi
Gamma Delta and the First Lady of the Land wearing the arrow of
Pi Beta Phi. Vice-President Charles G. Dawes of Delta Upsilon
guides the destiny of the U.S. Senate. Nicholas Longworth, of Zeta
Psi, is in command of the House of Representatives."
Editor Cleveland recalled that Delta Upsilon, to which Charles
Evans Hughes as well as the Vice-President belongs, "gave Garfield
to the Presidency"; that Beta Theta Pi has never "given" any one
to the Presidency but that it enrolls Frank Orren Lowden, William
Edgar Borah, Robert Marion LaFollette. "And here is a scoop.
. . . Harry F. Sinclair ... is a Phi Gamma Delta brother of Presi
dent Coolidge. Will Hays is a former National President of Phi
Delta Theta, which gave us President Benjamin Harrison."
Fraternity-pinned chests subsided, however, when Editor Cleve
land was carried by his exultation to make the following statement:
"There is not much doubt about it. The next President of the United
States, if a Republican, will be a fraternity man unless Herbert
Hoover is elected." To this prophecy, lame enough in its omission
of the two leading candidates for Presidency (Democrat Smith and
Republican Hoover), Editor Cleveland added the following: "Herbert
Hoover is non-fraternity and anti-fraternity. Hoover worked his
way through Stanford by waiting on table at the Kappa Kappa
Gamma sorority house. There he met and courted Lou Henry, now
Mrs. Hoover. It is alleged that her sorority sisters were considerably
embarrassed in a social way. Their actions and the attitude of the
Stanford fraternity men toward him are responsible, undoubtedly,
for his feeling of hostility toward the college fraternity system."

direct the affairs of the nation. The White House is 100 per cent
Greek letter, with President Coolidge flying the royal purple of Phi
Gamma Delta and the First Lady of the Land wearing the arrow of
Pi Beta Phi. Vice-President Charles G. Dawes of Delta Upsilon
guides the destiny of the U.S. Senate. Nicholas Longworth, of Zeta
Psi, is in command of the House of Representatives."
Editor Cleveland recalled that Delta Upsilon, to which Charles
Evans Hughes as well as the Vice-President belongs, "gave Garfield
to the Presidency"; that Beta Theta Pi has never "given" any one
to the Presidency but that it enrolls Frank Orren Lowden, William
Edgar Borah, Robert Marion LaFollette. "And here is a scoop.
. . . Harry F. Sinclair ... is a Phi Gamma Delta brother of Presi
dent Coolidge. Will Hays is a former National President of Phi
Delta Theta, which gave us President Benjamin Harrison."
Fraternity-pinned chests subsided, however, when Editor Cleve
land was carried by his exultation to make the following statement:
"There is not much doubt about it. The next President of the United
States, if a Republican, will be a fraternity man unless Herbert
Hoover is elected." To this prophecy, lame enough in its omission
of the two leading candidates for Presidency (Democrat Smith and
Republican Hoover), Editor Cleveland added the following: "Herbert
Hoover is non-fraternity and anti-fraternity. Hoover worked his
way through Stanford by waiting on table at the Kappa Kappa
Gamma sorority house. There he met and courted Lou Henry, now
Mrs. Hoover. It is alleged that her sorority sisters were considerably
embarrassed in a social way. Their actions and the attitude of the
Stanford fraternity men toward him are responsible, undoubtedly,
for his feeling of hostility toward the college fraternity system."
Following is a news-editorial item taken verbatim from Time. It is
given, not much for its facts, but for its gullible treatment. Someone
wrote an article in The Stanford Illustrated Review, stating that it was
all a mistake about the Kappa romance. The writer quoted Lou Henry as
saying that the truth was much more fascinating and romantic. Anyway,
this isn't all about Hoover:
FRAT MEN
Fraternity-pinned chests swelled with pride at a piece in the
"Magazine of Sigma Chi," by its editor, one Chester W. Cleveland.
"Today," wrote Brother Cleveland, "fraternity folk pretty much
direct the affairs of the nation. The White House is 100 per cent
Greek letter, with President Coolidge flying the royal purple of Phi
Gamma Delta and the First Lady of the Land wearing the arrow of
Pi Beta Phi. Vice-President Charles G. Dawes of Delta Upsilon
