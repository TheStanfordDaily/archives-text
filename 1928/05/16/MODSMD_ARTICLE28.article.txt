# Work That's Play
## 
### 
Hurray for the picks! Hurray for the shovels! Hurray for the food
stuffs, too! And thus poetically opens a little word to the effect that the
All-University rake and hoe meet will start today at one o'clock sharp 'mid
the fanfare of trumpets and the drumming of drums which will be noticed
as the Stanford Band. It's no use to argue that we should all go over and
work for the good of the children at the Home, as well as for our own
good (see farmers' health statistics).
But, just think, we'll be able to swing the hoe, or the axe, or the rake,
or other implement that comes to hand, to the beats of music played by the
band. It is hoped they keep up the jazz and don't play too many waltzes.
And besides this, there'll be a big barbecue, under the personal, not to say
loving, care of Sam McDonald, than whom there is no whomer when it
comes to barbecuing luscious lamb.
And to top it all, there will be the none-such vaudeville spectacle, pre
sented by the Student Body's most illustrious entertainers. After all the
work is done, all we'll have to do is get in line and grab our food, then
wander over under the oaks and munch away between bursts of laughter at
the funny men making antics on the specially built stage.
All ri^'lit —one o'clock at the Convalescent Home, folks.
