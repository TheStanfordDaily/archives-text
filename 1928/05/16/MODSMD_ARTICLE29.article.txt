College questionnaires can be used
for purposes less profound and
weighty than ascertaining whether
or not the Double Standard should
prevail, less practical than sounding
opinion on the preferred candidate
for president, and less disturbing than
testing attitudes toward American in
tervention in Nicaragua. In fact, the
questionnaire can be made a thing of
pleasure and a joy forever when con
ditions permit—that is to say when
a student body is sufficiently small,
sufficiently a unit, and sufficiently
filled with the spirit of "that sort of
thing."
Take Princeton for instance. Com
bined with the "Nassau Herald," a
record of the membership, history,
and opinions of each class at the time
of its graduation is a list of nearly
one hundred questions —significant, in
timate, irrelevant, ridiculous, on
which some five hundred males vent
their judgments of each other, college
morals, mores, and existence in gen
eral.
For the sake of those interested in
the comparative type of scholarship,
it may be said that the only subject
in which the Princeton inquisition, as
organized by the 1927 class, relates
itself to the recent survey conducted
by The Daily is that of Phi Bete
versus Block letter. Stanford seniors
voted about 67 per cent in favor of
the key. The Princeton margin fig
ures approximately 60 per cent. In
response to the query "Drink?" about
21 per cent of the Princetonians de
clared they did not. Whether this has
any relation to the 22 plus per cent
of Stanford seniors who favored
strict enforcement of Prohibition is
an open question.
STANFORD RATES
An exquisitely personal touch is
provided in the query, "Favorite man's
college after Princeton?" in which
Leland Stanford (sic) rated 2 votes,
being a close runner-up to Yale with
365, Dartmouth with 34, Williams
with 29, Virginia with 16, and a few
others. Harvard (this was shortly
after the unpleasant breach of ath
letic relations) was given 52 votes
and an enviable place between Vassar
and Bryn Mawr, as favorite women's
college.
Nearly half of the questions were
devoted to ascertaining what the
class members thought of each other
along certain lines. Those picked
were: Best All Around Man, Most
Respected, Best All Around Athlete,
Best All Around Man Outside Ath
letics, Most Thorough Gentleman,
Most Popular, Most Original, Most
Scholarly, Most Brilliant, Most Like
ly to Succeed, Done Most For Class,

What could be more thorough
going—or more satisfying to look
over in after years?
CLASS ELECTS FAVORITES
The class selected its favorite pro
fessor, preceptor, extra-curricular ac
tivity, coach, sport (to watch) and
sport (to play), most interesting lec
turer, most inspiring teacher, most
valuable course, most useless course,
hardest year, most pleasant year, and
so on, choosing newspapers, tooth
paste, studies, automobiles, and ciga
rettes.
Artistic judgments were solicited.
Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo
placed first and second among motion
picture actresses; Adolphe Menjou
and Doug Fairbanks among the ac

matists, Galsworthy the fiction writ
ers, Byron the poets. Meantime Max
field Parish beat John Held Junior
by one vote and Rembrandt by eight
in the race for favorite artists.

CLASS ELECTS FAVORITES
The class selected its favorite pro
fessor, preceptor, extra-curricular ac
tivity, coach, sport (to watch) and
sport (to play), most interesting lec
turer, most inspiring teacher, most
valuable course, most useless course,
hardest year, most pleasant year, and
so on, choosing newspapers, tooth
paste, studies, automobiles, and ciga
rettes.
Artistic judgments were solicited.
Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo
placed first and second among motion
picture actresses; Adolphe Menjou
and Doug Fairbanks among the ac
tors. Will Shakespeare led the dra
matists, Galsworthy the fiction writ
ers, Byron the poets. Meantime Max
field Parish beat John Held Junior
by one vote and Rembrandt by eight
in the race for favorite artists.
Rhetorical question: Couldn't we
try something similar here, Mr. and
Miss Senior Class?
—Herb Klein.
College questionnaires can be used
for purposes less profound and
weighty than ascertaining whether
or not the Double Standard should
prevail, less practical than sounding
opinion on the preferred candidate
for president, and less disturbing than
testing attitudes toward American in
tervention in Nicaragua. In fact, the
questionnaire can be made a thing of
pleasure and a joy forever when con
ditions permit—that is to say when
a student body is sufficiently small,
sufficiently a unit, and sufficiently
filled with the spirit of "that sort of
thing."
Take Princeton for instance. Com
bined with the "Nassau Herald," a
record of the membership, history,
and opinions of each class at the time
of its graduation is a list of nearly
one hundred questions —significant, in
timate, irrelevant, ridiculous, on
which some five hundred males vent
their judgments of each other, college
morals, mores, and existence in gen
eral.
For the sake of those interested in
the comparative type of scholarship,
it may be said that the only subject
in which the Princeton inquisition, as
organized by the 1927 class, relates
itself to the recent survey conducted
by The Daily is that of Phi Bete
versus Block letter. Stanford seniors
voted about 67 per cent in favor of
the key. The Princeton margin fig
ures approximately 60 per cent. In
response to the query "Drink?" about
21 per cent of the Princetonians de
clared they did not. Whether this has
any relation to the 22 plus per cent
of Stanford seniors who favored
strict enforcement of Prohibition is
an open question.
STANFORD RATES
An exquisitely personal touch is
provided in the query, "Favorite man's
college after Princeton?" in which
Leland Stanford (sic) rated 2 votes,
being a close runner-up to Yale with
365, Dartmouth with 34, Williams
with 29, Virginia with 16, and a few
others. Harvard (this was shortly
after the unpleasant breach of ath
letic relations) was given 52 votes
and an enviable place between Vassar
and Bryn Mawr, as favorite women's
college.
Nearly half of the questions were
devoted to ascertaining what the
class members thought of each other
along certain lines. Those picked

Take Princeton for instance. Com
bined with the "Nassau Herald," a
record of the membership, history,
and opinions of each class at the time
of its graduation is a list of nearly
one hundred questions —significant, in
timate, irrelevant, ridiculous, on
which some five hundred males vent
their judgments of each other, college
morals, mores, and existence in gen
eral.
For the sake of those interested in
the comparative type of scholarship,
it may be said that the only subject
in which the Princeton inquisition, as
organized by the 1927 class, relates
itself to the recent survey conducted
by The Daily is that of Phi Bete
versus Block letter. Stanford seniors
voted about 67 per cent in favor of
the key. The Princeton margin fig
ures approximately 60 per cent. In
response to the query "Drink?" about
21 per cent of the Princetonians de
clared they did not. Whether this has
any relation to the 22 plus per cent
of Stanford seniors who favored
strict enforcement of Prohibition is
an open question.
STANFORD RATES
An exquisitely personal touch is
provided in the query, "Favorite man's
college after Princeton?" in which
Leland Stanford (sic) rated 2 votes,
being a close runner-up to Yale with
365, Dartmouth with 34, Williams
with 29, Virginia with 16, and a few
others. Harvard (this was shortly
after the unpleasant breach of ath
letic relations) was given 52 votes
and an enviable place between Vassar
and Bryn Mawr, as favorite women's
college.
Nearly half of the questions were
devoted to ascertaining what the
class members thought of each other
along certain lines. Those picked
were: Best All Around Man, Most
Respected, Best All Around Athlete,
Best All Around Man Outside Ath
letics, Most Thorough Gentleman,
Most Popular, Most Original, Most
Scholarly, Most Brilliant, Most Like
ly to Succeed, Done Most For Class,
Done the Class Most, Most Entertain
ing, Biggest Grind, Handsomest, Pret
tiest, Wittiest, Thinks He is (Wit
tiest), Most Pious, Busiest, Laziest,

Best Dressed, Thinks He Is (Best
Dressed), Most High Hat, Talks Most
and Says Least, Biggest Snake,
Thinks He Is (Biggest Reptile), Big
gest Bluffer, Most Eccentric, Smooth
est, Biggest Gloom, Most Likely
Bachelor, Biggest Drag With Faculty,
Needs It Most (Biggest Drag With
ditto), Biggest Politician, Best Build,
Most Collegiate, Most Uncollegiate,
Greatest Woman-Hater, Most Uncon
scious, Class Baby, and last, but judge
if least, Best Natured.
What could be more thorough
going—or more satisfying to look
over in after years?
CLASS ELECTS FAVORITES
The class selected its favorite pro
fessor, preceptor, extra-curricular ac
tivity, coach, sport (to watch) and
sport (to play), most interesting lec
turer, most inspiring teacher, most
valuable course, most useless course,
hardest year, most pleasant year, and
so on, choosing newspapers, tooth
paste, studies, automobiles, and ciga
rettes.
Artistic judgments were solicited.
Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo
placed first and second among motion
picture actresses; Adolphe Menjou
and Doug Fairbanks among the ac
tors. Will Shakespeare led the dra
matists, Galsworthy the fiction writ
ers, Byron the poets. Meantime Max
field Parish beat John Held Junior
by one vote and Rembrandt by eight
in the race for favorite artists.
Rhetorical question: Couldn't we
try something similar here, Mr. and
Miss Senior Class?
