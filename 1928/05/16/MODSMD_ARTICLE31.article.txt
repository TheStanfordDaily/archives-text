The Editor, Sir:
Mention was made in Monday's
Daily of the fact that one of our pro
fessors was somewhat embarrassed
at the Prom by having the liveried
attendant of the checkroom ask him
for a dime to check his hat. Perhaps
Professor Treat was not the only one
embarrassed at the Prom. But who
among us should know better the
customs of the court of Louis XIV
than Professor Treat. Surely if it had
been a custom to charge a dime for
checking in those days the history
professors would know it and come
adequately supplied when dances are
given which purport to represent
such times.
All of which might indicate that
such a petty charge was wholly in
appropriate at the Prom, and it has
been whispered, is inappropriate at
any dance which wishes to maintain
a formal atmosphere.
Perhaps Messrs. Hackley and Cross
("checking done by") can explain
how they "get away with it" in as
much as we all know that they are
hired and adequately paid for this
work by the dance committee.
Yours for more formal checking,
A.L.R.
The Editor, Sir:
Let me use a little space to warn
those old-fashioned campus drivers
who still use 31x4 tires to tie them
on with a hard knot hereafter, be
cause I'm gunning for one. Some po
tential bond salesman, whose name
probably decorates an honor pledge,
made off with my spare Saturday
night; thus robbing me of the dis
tinction of being the only one on the
campus who has not lost a spare. I
don't know who takes them, what he
does with them, or how he justifies
the action; but he gets away with it
—and maybe I will.

The Editor, Sir:
One of the problems facing the ad
vertising committee of the Convale
scent Home Drive was some way of
boosting the Drive during the Mon
day noon rush for lunch. The original
suggestion was to dress one of the
three or four prominent students up
as a baby and perambulate him down
the Row at the critical moment. Most
of the other suggestions were along
this line. One, of course, observes the
"appropriateness" of spontaneous re
sponses, and the subconscious tribute

to the type of thing the campus
would observe. The committee, how
ever, felt that the most appropriate
thing would be the actual presence i
of the Convalescent Home. Needless
to say, it could not be done, for no
children leave the place. And so, sup
posing "it were your little sister"
she would have been safe at home. |
The children used were from the
campus grammar school. Two of the
nurses kindly consented to lend the
influence of their presence.
Those blatant banners, though! In
retrospect, how could we have done
it? Ilrilliant, ordinary, black paint on
glaring common white painters' cloth.
We ARE sorry, and realize they
should have been done in blue or
pink, but must have allowed our
aesthetic judgment to be submerged
to our frenzied excitement in the
moments of preparation. And that J
whistle —did just exactly what it was
supposed to do as witnessed by the !

editorial writer's own confession that
he rushed to see the cause for it.
Nurses, children, and something to
attract attention could not have been
so very inappropriate for the purpose.
Anyway, we don't feel bad, because
we understand the insidiousness of
the critical habit.
—A Member of the Committee.
