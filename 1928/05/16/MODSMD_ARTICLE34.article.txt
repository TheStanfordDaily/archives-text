# SPORTS OF 1928
## Champion of Champions 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
One of the most dramatic heavy
weight fights in all ring history took
place just twenty-eight years ago be
tween James J. Jeffries, champion of
the world, and James J. Corbett, the
ex-cliampion. Corbett, thirty-four
years old, with only one fight under
his belt in more than three years,
trying to regain his title from his
former sparring partner, fighting the
huge, bear-like boilermaker eight
years his junior, who had knocked
out the man who had knocked out
Corbett!
The fight was held on May 11 at
Coney Island, the scene of Jeff's tri
umphs over Fitzsimmons and Shar
key. About 8000 people saw Corbett's
gallant attempt to regain his title.
Contrast that with the crowd of near
ly 150,000 that watched Dempsey's
come-back attempt against Tunney in
Chicago twenty-seven years later. Let

me quote from Corbett's own version
of the fight, in his most interesting
book, "The Roar of the Crowd."
"While I was resting in my chair
after the twenty-second, I began to
plan what I would do when champion
again. My handlers were cautioning
me to be careful, as I had the fight
now, but I had made tip my mind to
slug the last and make a whirlwind
finish and not play safe. Well, I had
settled that; and not listening to my
seconds, I sat there puzzling over the
choice of a road-manager, planning
out a new play, and I was actually
deciding what size type I would use
on the big posters that would pro
claim me 'Champion of the World
Again!'"
Then, in the twenty-third round,
Jeff caught Corbett with a terrific left
hook and knocked him out. Not for
ten years was the big boilermaker to
know how it felt to lose.
