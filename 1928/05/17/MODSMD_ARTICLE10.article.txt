TOKYO, May 16.—( U.P.) — The
Japanese government reached a de
cision today to disarm the Chinese
Nationalists if they should attempt to
pursue Marshal Chang Tso-Lin into
Manchuria after the fall of Peking,

indifferently regard the prospect of
an invasion of Manchuria and Mon
golia by rival forces and therefore
will not permit prosecution of the war
beyond a line from Shanhaikwan to
Chaoyang, it was said.
Chang Tso-Lin may retire with his
troops to their home provinces un
molested, but Japan's interests in
Manchuria are too extensive to be
jeopardized by civil war there, the
Cabinet is understood to have de
cided.
Whether Japanese forces in Shan
tung and Manchuria will be reinforced
was not announced.
