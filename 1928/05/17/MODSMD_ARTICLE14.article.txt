"Success of the Stanford Student
Organizations Fund has elicited con
gratulations from colleges and uni
versities all over the West, and has
caused imitation of the system by
many institutions," declared Robert
Cecil, student manager, when explain
ing the administration and function
of the Fund in a recent interview.
"We have been asked to explain the
plan to colleges that want to use it
as a model for their own financial
system."
"The new requisition system used
to handle organization money is the
best one we could find," Cecil said.
"It is the same one used by the Uni
versity and by the Board of Athletic
Control."
"Cecil explained that $150,000 was
handled by the organization last year,
an increase of $15,000 over the pre
vious year. "With this increase in
volume, caused by an increase in the
number of subscribers to the fund, we
are able to give better service at a
smaller cost," the student manager I

continued. Under the new A.S.S.U.
Constitution, all student organiza
tions, other than living groups, are
required to become affiliated with the
Student Organizations Fund and let
i their finances be handled by it. A
| minimum handling charge of 1.4%
.is made for the bookkeeping and
banking service.
if
"Organizations are relieved of a lot
of worry, and are protected from con
| tracting large debts by the Student
J Organizations Fund," Cecil declared,
j "All money is deposited with us, and
! when the organization wishes to pur
j chase anything, it merely makes out
i a requisition and we do all the rest.
I Thus no organization is allowed to
I spend more than it can afford.
"Another service that 'we are able
j to give the organizations is to advise
; them on the probable outcome of any
j undertaking by studying the records
â–  of similar undertakings in the past.
For instance, if an organization
i wishes to give a dance, we have a
record that will enable us to say how
many bids it may expect to sell, how
much the dance will cost, and any
other information."
The central organization keeps the
books for the members and issues
monthly trial balances to the treas
urers. Despite the small handling
charge, the organizations have found
it financially profitable as well as con
venient to let the Fund administrators
handle their money, Cecil said. "We
have stopped up the leaks, especially
in personal expenditure accounts. By
a standardized method of requisitions,
a great deal of loss from this source
has been eliminated."
In 1916, when the Student Body be
came bankrupt, President Wilbur sug
gested the formation of the Student
Organizations Fund. His plan mater
ialized in 1919 and the Fund handled
a sum of $90,000 in its first year.
Gradually, as membership increased,
the service was improved and the
charge for it was lowered.
A1 Masters, general manager, is in
charge of the organization, but Robert
Cecil as student manager has the di
rect control over its administration.
