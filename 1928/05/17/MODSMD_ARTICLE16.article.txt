# VARSITY POLO SQUAD GOES NORTH TO PLAY
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity polo team left
yesterday afternoon for a trip in the
Northwest to play the University of
Washington and Oregon State Col
lege teams. They expect to return
May 20.
Larry Weymouth, George Connolly,
Chauncey Thompson, and Jack Mc-
Dougall comprise the team. Last year
the Cardinals beat these two outfits
by a decisive margin in games played
both at Stanford and on their home
fields. It has been two years since the
Oregon players defeated the local
team, and Washington has never
done so. Coach Lieutenant. Charles S.
Whitmore expects his men to play a
superior game to that of the Northern
teams.
Horses belonging to the team play
ing on its own field will be played by
both sides, to eliminate Stanford's
taking mounts along.
