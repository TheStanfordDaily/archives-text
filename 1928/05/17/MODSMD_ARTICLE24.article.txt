Stanford spirit manifested itself in
work and play yesterday when num
bers of the sons and daughters of the
Stanford Red cleaned up the grounds
of the Convalescent Home, and in re
ward for the heavy labors were given
good wholesome food and mirthful
diversion.
"I wish Labor Day were every day,"
said one of the children on the porch
of the McLaughlin Unit of the Home
as the workers industriously chopped
up huge trunks of trees to the inspir
ing march-rhythm of the Band, bright
ly arrayed in their red uniforms,
"It is amazing how much work the
students do on Labor Day," said Miss
Ruth Spande, who is superintendent
of the Home. "And the women this
year can't be given too much credit
for the work they have done. They
painted all the furniture in the old
Stanford house, and cleaned all the
windows of the new Babcock Unit.
It was an inspiring sight to see
Stanford's men and women laboring
j so hard in the warm sun of an after
noon on the Farm. And it was a group
of weary workers who gathered,
quickly enough though around the
barbecue pit at 5 o'clock where Sam,
Cardinal barbecue captain-in-cliief,
was generosity plus in feeding starv
ing Stanford students.
As the crowd gathered around the
cleverly improvised stage (more
power to Norm Larson and Greg Wil
liamson) three airplanes whirred
through the air to the surprise and
! delight of the college group and the
; convalescent children who were
watching the spectacle from the
: porch. Lieutenant Norman A. God
| dard performed many daring stunts,
; the names of which are known only
to those versed in aviation.
Syncopation that made the audience
sway rhythmically characterized the
playing of Staley and Thebaut. Big
j Perrin and Little Peavy had some
new tricks for a very appreciative
audience, and the harmonica duet
proved that such an feat could be
done, and done very well. Vincenti's
rendering of the famous "Casey" epic
left a little to be desired in the way
of histrionic ability.
All in all, despite Stanford's well
known conservatism and a' that, the
Labor Party may be pronounced a
great success from every possible
angle.

year can't be given too much credit
for the work they have done. They
painted all the furniture in the old
Stanford house, and cleaned all the
windows of the new Babcock Unit.
It was an inspiring sight to see
Stanford's men and women laboring
j so hard in the warm sun of an after
noon on the Farm. And it was a group
of weary workers who gathered,
quickly enough though around the
barbecue pit at 5 o'clock where Sam,
Cardinal barbecue captain-in-cliief,
was generosity plus in feeding starv
ing Stanford students.
As the crowd gathered around the
cleverly improvised stage (more
power to Norm Larson and Greg Wil
liamson) three airplanes whirred
through the air to the surprise and
! delight of the college group and the
; convalescent children who were
watching the spectacle from the
: porch. Lieutenant Norman A. God

; the names of which are known only
to those versed in aviation.
Syncopation that made the audience
sway rhythmically characterized the
playing of Staley and Thebaut. Big
j Perrin and Little Peavy had some
new tricks for a very appreciative
audience, and the harmonica duet
proved that such an feat could be
done, and done very well. Vincenti's
rendering of the famous "Casey" epic
left a little to be desired in the way
of histrionic ability.
All in all, despite Stanford's well
known conservatism and a' that, the
Labor Party may be pronounced a
great success from every possible
angle.
Stanford spirit manifested itself in
work and play yesterday when num
bers of the sons and daughters of the
Stanford Red cleaned up the grounds
of the Convalescent Home, and in re
ward for the heavy labors were given
good wholesome food and mirthful
diversion.
"I wish Labor Day were every day,"
said one of the children on the porch
of the McLaughlin Unit of the Home
as the workers industriously chopped
up huge trunks of trees to the inspir
ing march-rhythm of the Band, bright
ly arrayed in their red uniforms,
"It is amazing how much work the
students do on Labor Day," said Miss
