# On Choosing a Manager
## 
### 
In selecting the tennis manager for next year, a very unfortunate and
probably unnecessary procedure became necessary. The usual method is
that the incumbent manager, the coach, and the present and incoming cap
tains each make their choice as to the best man, then this goes to the
graduate manager for approval or veto, he having the final decision. Ordi
narily, the vote of these men is automatically approved by Masters.
This spring, however, it seems there was considerable milling around
beforehand as to whom some of the men with votes would vote for. One
of them, it is claimed, stated at ten o'clock in the morning that he was
voting for one candidate, and in the afternoon his vote was cast for the
other. As a consequence, there were three votes for the latter aspirant, and
only one for the other. Naturally enough, this last-minute switch puzzled
the graduate manager, so he inquired among the office people, those in
charge of equipment, and the man who will be tennis coach next year, who
they thought was the better man. They appear to have favored the one
who got the single vote.
Naturally enough, again, the three-vote man felt he was getting the
boot or something, and that the gradaute manager had it in for him.
Friends of his began discussing the matter with members of the Executive
Committee, and others, and finally the graduate manager said he would
waive his veto, and put the question into the hands of the Committee for
their decision. After hearing the case Tuesday night, the Committee de
cided the weight of evidence favored the one-vote man. He has the job.
Now, as to whether the action was right or wrong, very little can be
said. The Committee discussed the situation fully, at length, and impar
tially (only two members even knew who the men were). They did the
best they could. But the point is, the thing should never have reached the
Committee at all.
No one can, after looking at the facts, say that the graduate manager
was not perfectly justified in his action. Rather, he is to be commended.
Last year a situation developed in which two houses were found trying to
pass the manager jobs of two sports back and forth. The graduate man
ager found this out, and while he had to turn out the man who was most
fitted for the job, he felt it was his duty to break up such a ring. It was
his duty. Since we have student managers, and since they are working
on a competitive tryoutee system to get the jobs, such measures must be
taken to protect the other aspirants in the future.
The whole blame in the present case may be laid at the feet of those
four men who voted in the first place. Very evidently there was immaturity
of thought some place. Maybe a person could be for one man at ten o'clock
in the morning and have his mind changed by good sound reasoning in
four hours, but it hardly seems likely when there have been a couple of
years previous to look them over. Therefore, it seems to the Daily that
captains, coaches, and managers must use judgment in picking the next
managers if the tryoutee system, or any method of selection, is to survive.
Otherwise, the standard of managers is going to take a rapid decline.

on a competitive tryoutee system to get the jobs, such measures must be
taken to protect the other aspirants in the future.
The whole blame in the present case may be laid at the feet of those
four men who voted in the first place. Very evidently there was immaturity
of thought some place. Maybe a person could be for one man at ten o'clock
in the morning and have his mind changed by good sound reasoning in
four hours, but it hardly seems likely when there have been a couple of
years previous to look them over. Therefore, it seems to the Daily that
captains, coaches, and managers must use judgment in picking the next
managers if the tryoutee system, or any method of selection, is to survive.
Otherwise, the standard of managers is going to take a rapid decline.
In selecting the tennis manager for next year, a very unfortunate and
probably unnecessary procedure became necessary. The usual method is
that the incumbent manager, the coach, and the present and incoming cap
tains each make their choice as to the best man, then this goes to the
graduate manager for approval or veto, he having the final decision. Ordi
narily, the vote of these men is automatically approved by Masters.
This spring, however, it seems there was considerable milling around
beforehand as to whom some of the men with votes would vote for. One
of them, it is claimed, stated at ten o'clock in the morning that he was
voting for one candidate, and in the afternoon his vote was cast for the
other. As a consequence, there were three votes for the latter aspirant, and
only one for the other. Naturally enough, this last-minute switch puzzled
the graduate manager, so he inquired among the office people, those in
charge of equipment, and the man who will be tennis coach next year, who
they thought was the better man. They appear to have favored the one
who got the single vote.
Naturally enough, again, the three-vote man felt he was getting the
boot or something, and that the gradaute manager had it in for him.
Friends of his began discussing the matter with members of the Executive
Committee, and others, and finally the graduate manager said he would
waive his veto, and put the question into the hands of the Committee for
their decision. After hearing the case Tuesday night, the Committee de
cided the weight of evidence favored the one-vote man. He has the job.
Now, as to whether the action was right or wrong, very little can be
said. The Committee discussed the situation fully, at length, and impar
tially (only two members even knew who the men were). They did the
best they could. But the point is, the thing should never have reached the
Committee at all.
No one can, after looking at the facts, say that the graduate manager
was not perfectly justified in his action. Rather, he is to be commended.
Last year a situation developed in which two houses were found trying to
pass the manager jobs of two sports back and forth. The graduate man
ager found this out, and while he had to turn out the man who was most
fitted for the job, he felt it was his duty to break up such a ring. It was
his duty. Since we have student managers, and since they are working
on a competitive tryoutee system to get the jobs, such measures must be
taken to protect the other aspirants in the future.
