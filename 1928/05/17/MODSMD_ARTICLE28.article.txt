Among the funny little rules we have around the University, there is
one which strikes us as just a little bit funnier than others which have
come to our attention. A Stanford man may not visit a Stanford woman in
the Palo Alto Hospital, nor can a Stanford woman visit a Stanford man,
unless he or she has gotten a permit from the Dean of Women, and in
order to get such a permit, the parties concerned must be engaged.
Now as to the reason for this rule. First, we called Miss Boezinger,
who is acting Dean of Women during Miss Mary Yost's absence. She did
not know where the rule came from, and states that the President's office
does not know. She offered as a possible explanation that oftentimes
there are several men in the wards and that if too many people were allowed
to visit, it would not be beneficial to the other patients, for this number
would increase geometrically as the patients increase arithmetically.
But isn't such a matter up to the hospital authorities? They know
whether or not the patients must be kept quiet, and it is easy for them to
see that quiet is maintained. But evidently the hospital didn't make such
a ruling, or request it. Upon being asked, the hospital reports that they
have been requested by the University not to admit said men and women
except upon the Dean's permit. Dr. Mosher, medical adviser for the
women, was asked about the rule. She stated that she didn't know it ex
isted, and that she did not know a reason for it. Nor did the Dean of Men's
office know the whys and wherefores.
We can't see any good reason for such a rule. It seems silly in the
first place, and mighty queer in the second, that no one who should have
some idea of why it is knows anything about it.
