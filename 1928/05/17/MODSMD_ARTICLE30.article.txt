SUN BATHING, AND PROBLEMS
CONNECTED WITH THE SAME
Behold the latest —and blush! The
sun, now given to shining every day
or so, has brought to light the an
cient and most worthwhile relaxation
of sun bathing, and the campus,
sprawled over roof and porch, is all
intrigued with its new pastime.
Whether or not the sudden ascen
dancy of the violet ray to popularity
can be attributed to an appreciation
of the beneficial value of the same,
or to other more subtle reasons, we
can't quite say. Possibly many of the
devoutees have in mind getting a run
ning start on the coming summer. In
any event, snoozing away in the lazy
afternoon sun is a new and pleasant
way of wasting time which entails a
very minimum of strain on the con
science.
MODESTY WITH DIFFICULTY
As it is against the rules to sun
bathe with your clothes on, or prefer
ably not even in a bathing suit, a
certain problem involving modesty
and utility has arisen. Most of the
campus living quarters, among their
other limitations, lack facilities which
at the one and same time embrace
sufficient privacy and sufficient sun.
When faced with giving up one or
the other, the men have most often
elected the sun. A stroll down any of

our alleys nowadays is apt to reveal
other things besides garbage cans.
The problem is no less embarras
sing to the women, for whom a tan
has much social value. It seems that
only a few of the sororities have sun
deeks discreetly enough secluded to
make possible a graceful combination
of modesty and utility, ltoble, with
its protected back porch, however, is
reported to be the stronghold of the
gentler back-to-nature fans.
BENEFICIAL MEDICALLY
In addition to the delightful relaxa
tion and the exquisite way of passing
time, we have Dr. Storey's word that
it is beneficial from a medical view
point. That is, if the exposure is not
too long. Sunburn may be harmful as
well as disagreeable, and hence
should be guarded against, likewise
injury to the eyes. Otherwise bask
away as much as you please.
Odd as it may seem to a person of
liberal views, there has been a cer
tain amount of objection registered
against the exhibitionism of some of
our sun worshipers. Most of it has
been directed against the semi-nudity
on the men's tennis courts. However
amusing these objections, they should
be considered by the sun bath fans,
lest those who would be most free
in their views be judged intolerant
by others. —Jack Springer.
