"Poems in Praise of Practically Noth
ing," Samuel Hoffenstein, Boni &
Liveright.
In this utilitarian age, a book of
verse — even doggerel verse — that
achieves both fame and popularity, is
something to be regarded with awe.
Hoffenstein's amusing collection of
heterogeneous poetry has accom
plished both since even the "New
Yorker" makes jokes about it now,
and bookstore sales show it high
among the best sellers.
This miscellaneous assortment
varies from Poems of Passion Care
fully Restrained So As To Offend No
body to parodies, litanien before elec
tions, and Poems Intended to Excite
the Utmost Depression. As in every
book of this sort, a little of it neces
sarily goes a long way, but this is
clever enough to take your doses
often.
Amusing Parodies
Probably the most amusing are the
parodies, on contemporary artistes,"
which include Edna St. Vincent Mil*
lay, Yeats, Walter de la Mare, and
Vachel Lindsay. Some direct bur
lesques as:
"I burned my candle at both ends,
And now have neither foes nor friends;
For all the lovely light begotten,
I'm paying now in feeling rotten."
as well as more subtle parodies of
their styles. The Lindsay one, in par
ticular, is amusing.
Hoffenstein is vary much a gentle
man of the twentieth century, which
though not entirely a thing to be
proud of, he very cleverly capitalizes.

His commentary verse runs along hit
ting off things he is"a-Freud" of, to
nursery rhymes for divorced children.
And if future generations are inter
ested in our civilization — for any
other reason but morbidity—they can
take down the dust-covered copy of
these poems, and get an even clearer
insight of our life than by reading the
files of old funny papers.
Express Tragedy
Besides the broad humor, how
ever, are some poems of deep tragedy,
seriously concerned with great prob
lems of life. Hoffenstein's piercing
vision and philosophy appeals to us—
particularly as our hay fever is get
ting worse with this weather. The
pathetic poems run along on a theme
like this:
"You buy some flowers for your table;
You tend them tenderly as you're able;
You fetch them water from hither and
thither —
What thanks to you get for it all?
They wither."
And above all, he has not forgotten
the little one, and has given a whole
section to "A Garden of Verses for
the Little Ones, Including Orphans
and Step-Children, and Their Parents
and Guardians Also," with touching
little quatrains such as this:
"Sleep, my little baby, sleep;
You'll have cause enough to weep—
Slumber is a precious boon;
You'll be getting measles soon — v
You see, there is a little of everything.
Poetry is in essence something one's
mood should "vibrate" to, and Hof
fenstein has included nearly every
shade in the spectrum here for your
vibrations. —Hallie Keating.

And if future generations are inter
ested in our civilization — for any
other reason but morbidity—they can
take down the dust-covered copy of
these poems, and get an even clearer
insight of our life than by reading the
files of old funny papers.
Express Tragedy
Besides the broad humor, how
ever, are some poems of deep tragedy,
seriously concerned with great prob
lems of life. Hoffenstein's piercing
vision and philosophy appeals to us—
particularly as our hay fever is get
ting worse with this weather. The
pathetic poems run along on a theme
like this:
"You buy some flowers for your table;
You tend them tenderly as you're able;
You fetch them water from hither and
thither —
What thanks to you get for it all?
They wither."
And above all, he has not forgotten
the little one, and has given a whole
section to "A Garden of Verses for
the Little Ones, Including Orphans
and Step-Children, and Their Parents
and Guardians Also," with touching
little quatrains such as this:
"Sleep, my little baby, sleep;
You'll have cause enough to weep—
Slumber is a precious boon;
You'll be getting measles soon — v
You see, there is a little of everything.
Poetry is in essence something one's
mood should "vibrate" to, and Hof
fenstein has included nearly every
shade in the spectrum here for your
vibrations. —Hallie Keating.
"Poems in Praise of Practically Noth
ing," Samuel Hoffenstein, Boni &
Liveright.
In this utilitarian age, a book of
verse — even doggerel verse — that
achieves both fame and popularity, is
something to be regarded with awe.
Hoffenstein's amusing collection of
heterogeneous poetry has accom
plished both since even the "New
Yorker" makes jokes about it now,
and bookstore sales show it high
among the best sellers.
This miscellaneous assortment
varies from Poems of Passion Care
fully Restrained So As To Offend No
body to parodies, litanien before elec
tions, and Poems Intended to Excite
the Utmost Depression. As in every
book of this sort, a little of it neces
sarily goes a long way, but this is
clever enough to take your doses
often.
Amusing Parodies
Probably the most amusing are the
parodies, on contemporary artistes,"
which include Edna St. Vincent Mil*
lay, Yeats, Walter de la Mare, and
Vachel Lindsay. Some direct bur
lesques as:
"I burned my candle at both ends,
And now have neither foes nor friends;
For all the lovely light begotten,
I'm paying now in feeling rotten."
as well as more subtle parodies of
their styles. The Lindsay one, in par
ticular, is amusing.
Hoffenstein is vary much a gentle
man of the twentieth century, which
though not entirely a thing to be
proud of, he very cleverly capitalizes.

His commentary verse runs along hit
ting off things he is"a-Freud" of, to
nursery rhymes for divorced children.
