AND THAT'S THAT
The Convalescent Home
Is free from weeds.
We've paid out dough
To meet its needs.
We've watched Vincenti's
Humorous capers
And scattered 'round
Our picnic papers.

HEARD AT THE HOME

awhile. I'm not working either."

Hock Chalmers Was There!
The perrenial college youth, Hock
Chalmers, tells marvelous bed-time
stories in spite of not having done
that very much. Chalmers and Delmer
Daves are Stanford's greatest expon
ents of Stanford's great ideal of good
clean fun told in a good clean way.

When the tumblers were strutting
their stuff some bozo piped up, "That
just goes to show that a little fellow
can walk all over a big guy."

Cabbages "Lost and Found" Column
We'd like to refer you to the Daily's
"lost, and found" stating that a "small
black lady's suitcase" has been lost.
We are trying to help her find her
suitcase. Mail it to Cabbages.

"Hold the line, Archie's just stepped
in Hello, Archie!"
"Hello yourself!" grumbled Archie,

thumbing a blister on his hand.
"Phew! but I'm tired!"
"What happened? Did you swing a
hoe too much?"
"Naw! I was trying to crank that
darn Ford after the entertainment
and it balked. You don't think that I'd
do any manual work, do you? I put on
my roommate's band uniform and
spent the afternoon talking to all the
women. I rated heavy until the Ford
went dead. I had to send her home
with one of those Chrysler boys."
"Tough luck! I hope you've got
some stuff for the column. I'm dead
tired from pushing a wheelbarrow all
afternoon."
"Say, are you the guy that was
pushing those females around in that
wheelbarrow when it was needed to
haul rubbish? Don't speak to me on
tlie Quad! A slow smile spread over
Archie's features as he settled down
in his chair. "Did you see that dumb
bunny pull up all those radishes and
leave the weeds?"
