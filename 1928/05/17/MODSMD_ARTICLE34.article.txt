# Sidelights on Labor Day..
## 
### 
Labor Day is one of the remaining
traditions of this place which we hope
the iconoclasts will never attempt to
abolish. When a thousand students
take off their shirts, spit on their
hands, and grab axes, all to help !
beautify the home of forty or fifty ill
children, then certainly things haven't j
gone entirely to the dogs. Labor Day |
and the Masque Ball, the only two
occasions on which the whole student
body makes any attempt to gather
for the purpose (partial though it be,
in the former case) of having fun,
provided some of the best enjoyment
any of us have had this year, that is,
of which we could speak, as Hock
Chalmers said, in the present com
pany.

Thirty-two sheep furnished 871
pounds of mutton for the raven
ous horde last night—the sheep
were from the University's flock;
thirty-two gallons of ice cream,
2300 sandwiches, thirty gallons
of coffee, one and one-half gal
lons of pickles, and enough bean
and potato salad to feed 1200
freshmen, or 1800 normal eaters,
were consumed. Sam McDonald,
caretaker of athletics buildings
and grounds, was the chef, and
Benny Craft headed the commit
tee which doled out the food.

With every alternate fellow look
ing for as easy a job as there is to
be found, it has always been a puzzle
to us why more don't seek work in
the Toy Repair Department. Yester
day, Dick Worden had three men
mending and painting the convale
scent children's juvenile vehicles. We
wandered over to the cool shade
where the boy craftsmen were operat
ing, and found six Buddy Bugs (kid
die kars), two auto coasters, three
wagons, several Irish Mails, one vehi
cular boat, and several tricycles and
skudder cars being Ducoed.

Good old Dr. Gardner was hik
ing about the grounds all after
noon, watching with interest the
weeds fall, the sawn logs drop
apart, and other busy things. He
works ceaselessly for the Home,
and he cherishes it almost as
much a part of his life as the
Memorial Chapel.

Sixteen gallons of frozen orange
juice were sold during the heat of
the afternoon, Adele Gist reported,
and more could have been. And that's
about as completely as we kept track
of the annual event.

Sixteen gallons of frozen orange
juice were sold during the heat of
the afternoon, Adele Gist reported,
and more could have been. And that's
about as completely as we kept track
of the annual event.
Labor Day is one of the remaining
traditions of this place which we hope
the iconoclasts will never attempt to
abolish. When a thousand students
take off their shirts, spit on their
hands, and grab axes, all to help !
beautify the home of forty or fifty ill
children, then certainly things haven't j
gone entirely to the dogs. Labor Day |
and the Masque Ball, the only two
occasions on which the whole student
body makes any attempt to gather
for the purpose (partial though it be,
in the former case) of having fun,
provided some of the best enjoyment
any of us have had this year, that is,
of which we could speak, as Hock
Chalmers said, in the present com
pany.

Thirty-two sheep furnished 871
pounds of mutton for the raven
ous horde last night—the sheep
were from the University's flock;
thirty-two gallons of ice cream,
2300 sandwiches, thirty gallons
of coffee, one and one-half gal
lons of pickles, and enough bean
and potato salad to feed 1200
freshmen, or 1800 normal eaters,
were consumed. Sam McDonald,
caretaker of athletics buildings
and grounds, was the chef, and
Benny Craft headed the commit
tee which doled out the food.

With every alternate fellow look
ing for as easy a job as there is to
be found, it has always been a puzzle
to us why more don't seek work in
the Toy Repair Department. Yester
day, Dick Worden had three men
mending and painting the convale
scent children's juvenile vehicles. We
wandered over to the cool shade
where the boy craftsmen were operat
ing, and found six Buddy Bugs (kid
die kars), two auto coasters, three
wagons, several Irish Mails, one vehi
cular boat, and several tricycles and
skudder cars being Ducoed.

Good old Dr. Gardner was hik
ing about the grounds all after
noon, watching with interest the
weeds fall, the sawn logs drop
apart, and other busy things. He
works ceaselessly for the Home,
and he cherishes it almost as
much a part of his life as the
Memorial Chapel.
