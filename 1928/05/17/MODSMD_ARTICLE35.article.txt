The Editor, Sir:
I have a little matter which I wish
to call to the attention of the student
body at large. It is a matter of deep
concern to us all, and I believe it my
duty to make it known.
A friend of mine nominated a cer
tain man for the Board of Athletic
Control, but much to his surprise the
nominee's name did not appear in the
Daily. Now it developed that this
nominee "happened" to be around
when the nomination box was opened
and saw his name; whereupon he and
the chairman of the Election Board
proceeded to tear up the nomination
and let it go at that! We will all
agree, I believe, that such action was
entirely contrary to all customary
(at least as far as we are aware) pro
cedure. To be fair, I must admit that
there is no constitutional provision
prohibiting this sort of thing. We
must admit, nevertheless, that this
sort of action might result in ques
tionable tactics if it is allowed to go
on unchecked. To my way of think
ing it should be imperative that all
nominations be published in the
Daily. Then if anyone wishes to with
draw, he should have to send in a
formal declination blank, and this in
turn should have to be printed in the
Daily.
Members of the Election Board
should merely perform ministerial
duties, i.e., they should be obliged to
carry out certain well-defined func
tions, regardless of their personal be
liefs or desires. If a nomination blank
is dropped in the box provided for
that purpose, the person named there
on is legally nominated. The Election
Board should have no discretionary
power in the matter. The nomination
should be published in the Daily, fol
lowed by any subsequent legal decli
nation.
As a result of the case here cited,
a man was duly and legally nomi
nated for an office —did not resign;
at least not according to prevailing
custom —therefore he was technically,
at least, running for office. Yet this
man served as an official at the elec
tion. The constitution provides that
no person running for office can
serve as an election official.
I realize that it is more or less a
matter of personal opinion whether
or not such a person was a candidate.
T also am aware of the fact that since
there is no constitutional provision
covering the subject of declinations
that tearing up a nomination blank
cannot be declared unconstitutional.

Although these things are realized
and it is probable that nothing can
be done —now, we can at least see
to it that suitable provisions are in
serted in the constitution so that a
recurrence of this sort of thing can
be prevented in the future.

A friend of mine nominated a cer
tain man for the Board of Athletic
Control, but much to his surprise the
nominee's name did not appear in the
Daily. Now it developed that this
nominee "happened" to be around
when the nomination box was opened
and saw his name; whereupon he and
the chairman of the Election Board
proceeded to tear up the nomination
and let it go at that! We will all
agree, I believe, that such action was
entirely contrary to all customary
(at least as far as we are aware) pro
cedure. To be fair, I must admit that
there is no constitutional provision
prohibiting this sort of thing. We
must admit, nevertheless, that this
sort of action might result in ques
tionable tactics if it is allowed to go
on unchecked. To my way of think
ing it should be imperative that all
nominations be published in the
Daily. Then if anyone wishes to with
draw, he should have to send in a
formal declination blank, and this in
turn should have to be printed in the
Daily.
Members of the Election Board
should merely perform ministerial
duties, i.e., they should be obliged to
carry out certain well-defined func
tions, regardless of their personal be
liefs or desires. If a nomination blank
is dropped in the box provided for
that purpose, the person named there
on is legally nominated. The Election
Board should have no discretionary
power in the matter. The nomination
should be published in the Daily, fol
lowed by any subsequent legal decli
nation.
As a result of the case here cited,
a man was duly and legally nomi
nated for an office —did not resign;
at least not according to prevailing
custom —therefore he was technically,
at least, running for office. Yet this
man served as an official at the elec
tion. The constitution provides that
no person running for office can
serve as an election official.
I realize that it is more or less a
matter of personal opinion whether
or not such a person was a candidate.
T also am aware of the fact that since
there is no constitutional provision
covering the subject of declinations
that tearing up a nomination blank
cannot be declared unconstitutional.

Although these things are realized
and it is probable that nothing can
be done —now, we can at least see
to it that suitable provisions are in
serted in the constitution so that a
recurrence of this sort of thing can
be prevented in the future.
