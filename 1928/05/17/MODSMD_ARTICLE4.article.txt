## Complete Reports of Gifts Not Yet Made; More Money Expected

Reports from the Convalescent
Home Drive committees indicate that
$2150.06 has been raised from the stu
dents of the University in their ap
peal for funds for "Stanford's Own"
charity. This amount does not include
the $250 from the Rally Committee,
nor the $74.73 that was made yester
day from the concessions for Labor
Day.
Complete reports for the Drive
have not come in, so it is hoped that
| those men who have not yet contri
buted will do so in the next few days.
The men of the University contribu
ted $996.31 while the women gave
$1153.75, which shows that the wo
men gave a much greater response to
the call for the charity than the men.
"The spirit shown this year in the
Drive was perfectly splendid," said
Lilian Force yesterday, on viewing
the results of the A.W.S. Drive. "I
don't believe the women have ever
showed such remarkable co-operation
before."
The A.S.S.U. contribution of $996.31
represents $450.95 from the fraterni
ties on the Row and $545.36 from the
halls.
The items of the A.S.S.U. Drive
are: men's halls, $401.83; El Capitan,
$13; Sequoia, $96; El Cuadro, $22;
bottles placed in postoffice, etc.,
$12.53; concessions donated from the
Peninsula Creamery, Nipa Hut,
Moreys, and Lucky Strike and Chester
field companies for Labor Day, $74.73;
fraternities, $450.95; and the Rally
Committee, $250.
The women's living groups have
donated $1153.75. Of this amount
$663.75 comes from the Row, and
$490 from Roble. The total amount
for the A.S.S.U. Drive, the A.W.S.
Drive, and the Rally Committee repre
sents a sum of $2400.06.
