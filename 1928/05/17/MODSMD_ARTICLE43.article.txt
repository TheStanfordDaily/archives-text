# SPORTS OF 1928
## Will Collett Collect? 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Glenna Collett, the most-feared lady
of the links (I mean feared by British
and French ladies when it comes to
winning their national titles) and the
best-known of all American women
players, is now in her third invasion
of the British Isles with a very defi
nite object in view. I don't mean that
she has put an ad in the London
Times, "Position wanted, Female.
Young lady educated in the States
would like a job of chaperon to Brit
ish Women's Championship cup for
period of one year," or anything like
that, for we all know very well that
all the putting she will do will be on
the greens of the Hustanton golf club.
But, you see, this is Glenna's third
trip abroad in search of a title, and
many people sort of feel that this
time she will be successful. When she

lost to Joyce Wethered in 1925, she
was beaten by the greatest woman
golfer in the world, and fought very
valiantly and courageously while
playing wonderful golf herself. Then
the industrial strike postponed the
192G tournament, and Miss Collett
was forced to come home without
competing for the title.
In the qualifying round of the Wo
men's South Atlantic championship at
St. Augustine, Glenna gave a rude
shock to many a male golfer who
thought he was good because be had
broken 80, by shooting a sizzling 74!
Not only can she send her drives far
and straight down the fairway, and
sink her putts, but Miss Collett's iron
play is becoming more and more
steady. If any girl from these shores
is to twist the British lion's tail, she
is the one to do it.
