# COLLEGIATE BLAZERS RENOUNCED BY CO-EDS IN FLAPPERS' FAVOR
## 
### Lady Vee 
Coats and more coats are the order
of the day this season, and there are
as many different varieties as there
are hours of the day.
Two types of coats introduced last
summer are achieving their due popu
larity this year—the three-quarters
and seven-eighths length velveteen,
in all colors, and the blazing blazer of
striped flannel. For the gay printed
dresses so rampant now, nothing is
so satisfactory as one of the plain
velveteen coats, trimmed with noth
ing but stitching.
Unfortunately, the ultra-collegiate
high school flapper has made the
blazer so distinctly her own that the
real, bona fide college co-ed has noth
ing for it but to eschew it —sadly but
firmly eschew it. In all such cases
of stolen thunder, the thief is best
left unmolested —with the thunder!
A new and decidedly different ver
sion of the jacket has presented itself
for evening, made of chiffon or lace —
and cut exactly like a man's smoking
jacket. This freak of fashion —the
most fragile of materials cut on the
most tailored lines possible—is a

striking inconsistency and thereon
hangs the chief charm.
Of course these jackets can only
be worn with evening frocks of equal
j filminess —in other words, chiffon or
| georgette. For the bouffante silhou
ettes, the proper light wrap is the
| traditional shawl or one of the new
; scarfs made of strips of fine lace, and
chiffon.
