# BEGIN PREPARATIONS FOR ENCINA INFORMAL
## 
### 
Work on the decoration of Encina
lobby for the Encina Sport Dance has
now begun and all of the furniture
has been removed. John B. Craig, San
Francisco decorator, who is in charge,
will have all materials down here by
today. This year the lobby will
be transformed into a summer gar
den with colorfully flowered hangings
about the walls, with a three-foot
hedge, and with an abundance of
flowers.
