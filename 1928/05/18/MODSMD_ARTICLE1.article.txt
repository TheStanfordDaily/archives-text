## Phi Delts Swamp Phi Sigmas In First Championship Tilt of League VI Godett, A.T.O. Hurler, Strikes Out Sixteen Players in Pitching Duel 
### 
An overthrow in the first of the eighth
inning gave Alpha Tau Omega a 3 to 2
â– win yesterday over Alpha Delta Phi in
one of the closest games of the intramural
baseball tourney. Phi Delta Theta de
feated Phi Kappa Sigma in the first game
of the play-off for the championship of
League VI.
The Alpha Delt-A.T.O. game was a
pitchers' battle between Michael Godett
and John Keith, the former holding the
losers to three hits, and striking out six
teen men. The Alpha Delt hurler allowed
four hits.
The Alpha Delts took the lead in the
third inning when they scored on a walk
and a hit. A.T.O. then took the lead with
two runs, the game remaining the same
until Perry Churchill hit a home run.
The winning run was scored in the first
of an extra inning by Carl Munson, who
took advantage of an overthrow to the
shortstop, after he had hit a single.
Phi Delta Theta defeated Phi Kappa
Sigma in League VI play-off when Chuck
Smalling held the Phi Kaps to three hits,
striking out sixteen men. His effective
pitching kept the hits scattered and no
man reached third base. Tindal Evans,
Phi Kappa Sigma pitcher, allowed only
three hits but walks and overthrows gave
the Phi Delts eight runs. He settled down
after the fourth inning, allowing no hits
or runs. A triple by Smalling in the first
inning was the longest hit of the game.
Phi Delta Theta will play Kappa Sigma
Saturday morning in the varsity diamond
for the championship of League VI. The
winner of the game will meet Phi Kappa
Psi, League I winner, Monday afternoon
in the finals competition.
