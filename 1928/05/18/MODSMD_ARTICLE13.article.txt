# SENIOR, FROSH TEAMS WILL PLAY TODAY FOR SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
Senior and freshman interclass soccer
teams will clash this afternoon at 4:30
o'clock in a game which will practically
decide the interclass championship. By
winning, the first-year men will be placed
in a tie with the junior team; while a
senior victory will place the juniors well
in the lead.
The game between the juniors and
sophomores which was to have been
played Wednesday was postponed until
Monday, but judging by the ability shown
thus far by these two teams, the upper
classmen will have little trouble winning.
The seniors played Monday with only
eight men and defeated the sophomores 2
to 1; therefore the game this afternoon
should be a fight from start to finish.
Most of the players on the senior team
arc varsity men, past or present; conse
quently they work very well together. At
the same time the members of the fresh
man team, with the exception of one or
two players, played together on the frosh
team last fall.
