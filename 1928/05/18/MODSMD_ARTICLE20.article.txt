# COMMITTEE PLANS RALLY AS SEND-OFF FOR CARD ATHLETES
## 
### 
"The parade starts at 1:15 o'clock
but the main show won't start until
1:30 o'clock," announces Bob Fraser,
chairman of the rally committee, in
reference to the mammoth rally and
send-off to be staged at the Palo Alto
depot this afternoon just prior to the
time that Stanford's national cham
pionship track team embarks for the
East to defend its title in the 1.C.-4A.
meet next Saturday. The newly
elected yell-kings will have charge of
the event.
"All loyal sons and daughters "from
down on the Farm" will be expected
to turn out en masse," declared
Fraser. "A rousing send-off this after
noon will do much to insure a Cardi
nal victory at Cambridge next week."
A musical program is being ar
ranged by Scott Webster, newly elect
ed head yell-leader. An effort is being
made to have Dink Templeton deliver
a brief farewell speech summarizing
the Stanford chances in the coming
contest. This will be the only rally
of the quarter.
