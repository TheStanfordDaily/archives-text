# TRACKSTERS LEAVE TODAY FOR PRETENTIOUS EASTERN INVASION
## Card Delegation to Compete In A.A.U. Championships, Olympic Tryouts Board of Athletic Control Shoulders Expenses of Trip This Year 
### Bob Speers 
Thirteen Card tracksters with Coach
Dink Templeton and Manager Murray
Draper leave today at 1:30 o'clock
on the most pretentious Eastern in
vasion ever attempted by Stanford.
The prime purpose is, of course,
the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet at Cambridge
on May 25 and 2G. For this the Cards
have been working all year, and it is
this contest which they are deter
mined to win.
The National A.A.U. championships
and Olympic Games tryouts in Boston
July 6 and 7, go to make the journey
all the more momentous, and the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
championships in Chicago June 8 and
9 will round out a great program.
The decision of the Stanford Board
of Athletic Control to shoulder the ex
penses of this trek means an entirely
independent band of Cardinals
swooping down into select Eastern
circles, but by the same token the
Board's action caused consternation
in another camp right here on the
Pacific Coast.
It has been the practice, formerly,
for the Olympic Club to send East a
strong squad for the A.A.U. champion
ships, pretty largely composed of
Stanford athlfetes. Now that the
Cards are traveling on their own, the
club is left in a somewhat embarras
sing position.
This ambitious program, being em
barked on by Templeton and his
charges, will keep them away from
the Farm for more than two months.
In fact, it seems more than likely
that several, at least, will not be seen
in these parts until next Fall, when
the Olympic games are a thing of the
past.
Krenz, King, Spencer, Edmonds,
and Dyer are already considered lead
pipe cinches for the transatlantic
jaunt, and after the successful East
ern campaign which looms, there
may be other Stanford men on the
boat.
