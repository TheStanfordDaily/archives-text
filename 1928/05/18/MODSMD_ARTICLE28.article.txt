# Setters of Fireâ€”Note

Here is a letter from Comptroller Roth. It covers the situation
fully and does not need to be expanded upon, but if the arsonists
will realize the danger caused by their childish pranks certainly
they won't allow these conflgrations to continue.
Mr. Frank Baker, Editor,
The Stanford Daily
Dear Frank:
' I am writing to enlist your co-operation in correcting a situa
tion which began as an innocent prank and has developed into a
rather serious problem. I refer to the annoying practice of burn
ing up the hay on the Stanford Farm.
History does not record the name of the first freshman who
conceived the idea of a hay bonfire. I do recall, however, that such
an instance occurred when I was a student at Stanford, and the
stunt probably has been repeated each year during all its history. It
therefore would appear that the stunt has lost its originality.
This year the situation has become very serious. Last Sunday
night there were 18 fires to which the fire department found it
necessary to respond. I am sure that Stanford men will realize the
seriousness of the situation and co-operate in eliminating this
nuisance when the following serious objections thereto are pointed
out.
In the first place the fields are becoming so dry that there is
danger of the fire spreading and doing serious damage.
In the second place the property loss in the destruction of
the hay has become so great as to amount to a real destruction of
University property.
In the third place, and most important, is the fact that when
the fire department is responding to these calls it takes the men
and equipment away from the fire house where they would be
greatly needed in the event that a serious fire should occur at some
house or hall on the campus. It is extremely important in handling
fires that no time be lost in responding to a call and it is conceivable
that with a fire at Encina, or some other building on the campus,
a very serious situation might arise if the firemen and equipment
were not available for immediate response to a call.
It has been my experience in the past that Stanford students
will respond and co-operate with the University in eliminating any
practice when its objectionable features are brought to their at
tention.
I shall consider it a great favor if you would co-operate in
presenting this situation to the student body, and you may feel free
to use this letter in any way which you desire.
Yours very truly,
A. E. ROTH,
Comptroller
