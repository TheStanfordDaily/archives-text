# Give These Boys a Hand

### 
Following the lead of Captain Spencer, Morrison, and Coe, the rest of
the 1.C.4-A. track squad will leave today for eastern parts well-known,
immediately after a send-ofif rally at the Southern Pacific depot in Palo
Alto at 1:30 o'clock. Contrasted with last year, when it was considered
Stanford team in the Little Theatre at 7:15 o'clock tonight. The hour was
team is expected to make even more points than were made in winning a
year ago.
As a team, the Stanford track men have shown themselves to be about
the best intercollegiate aggregation in the country in the dual meets. They
also have many individual stars among them, who may further prove their
competency for Olympic trials in the 1.C.4-A. workout.
Our last chance to show appreciation for their work and Dink Temple
ton's coaching is at the rally today. A hearty send-off should set them
well on the way to fight for Stanford, as well as individual honors.
