KINGS BAY, Spitzbergen, May 17.â€”
General Umberto Nobilc, who took the
giant dirigible Italia out over the unex
plored Arctic wastes Tuesday at 2 p.m.,
sent a wireless message at noon today
saying he was returning to Kings Bay,
where he expects to arrive tonight if his
present speed can be maintained.
At that time the Italia was southeast
of Franz Josef Land, after cruising north
and south over Lenin Land, where a
snow storm had been encountered. Nobile
had found no new land.
