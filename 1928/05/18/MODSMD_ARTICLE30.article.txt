# Women's Debate
## 
### 
Stanford women have only one truly intercollegiate activity, debating.
Even that is not as well developed as it might be. But tonight the women
debaters are inaugurating something new in the way of intercollegiate
activity. For the first time, a Stanford women's forensic team will invade
the south, in a dual debate with U.S.C.
The women have been working for this contest for some time. Now
that they have achieved it, what they need most for its repetition in future
is the co-operation of the student body. A LJ.S.C. team is meeting a
Stanford team in the Assembly Hall at 7 :15 o'clock tonight. The hour was
set early so that the debate would not interfere with other activities of the
evening.
