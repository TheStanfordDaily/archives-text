# Seats And More Seats

### 
California now considers its stadium is too small again, and may
add about thirty tiers, which will increase its capacity to over 100,000.
Engineers have been busily engaged in surveying the plan and find it can
feasibly be carried out without robbing the structure of its classic lines.
This will be welcome news to both Stanford and California graduates
who must struggle every other year to obtain seats for the Big Game.
Such an addition might take care of nearly all the applicants for tickets
for a couple of years, anyhow. Last year, the Stanford stadium was
increased some thousands of seats, and the Big Game found them all
taken. Just how big must a stadium be to take care of all the students,
alumni, and outsiders who wish to see these games? Some day they
will have to stop building additions, and then what will happen?
