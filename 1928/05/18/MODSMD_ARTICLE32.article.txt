A NOBLE INSTITUTION
The Nation is running a series of
articles which hold great promise.
Various people, writers and others,
including Erna Ferber, H. L. Mencken,
Sinclair Lewis, Upton Sinclair, are
to describe the world they would like
to live in.
Stuart Chase, under the title of "A
Very Private Utopia," heads the
series. Among the deficiencies of our
life he brings to the attention of his
readers is the absence of keen con
versation.
"I would like to live in a world," he
writes, "where many good books were
being published—fiction, poetry, sci
ence, history, philosophy; where good
plays and good music were just
around the corner —without too much
standing in line and too little ventila
tion; where good pictures were being
hung; where the arts and crafts were
flourishing and especially, where good
conversation abounded; together with
the leisure to pursue it. Of all the
joys which life has to offer for me,
none can exceed that of keen, stimu
lating talk; and nothing is rarer in
America today."
College Bull Sessions
The point is well made, and holds
for our contemporary college life as
much as it does for the business and
social world. Upon a few fugitive oc
casions, however, collegiate conversa
tion escapes the spell of the common

place. We refer to the justly famous
institution of the bull session.
Of all things which are attractive
to college students, there is nothing
perhaps more universal in its appeal
than a good- bull session. Really good
bull sessions, being a combination of
accident, leisure, and a certain rare
and almost undefinable spontaneity,
happen most infrequently. This is
rather regrettable when one considers
the amount of time which is wasted
on such dull pastimes as the movies.
Follow Set Cycle
The best results, as far as keen
ness in thought and conversation go,
are achieved when the group is not
too large. While the topics degenerate
fast enough in small groups, with
larger numbers involved, they usually
degenerate at the beginning never to
rise again.
Bull sessions invariably follow a
set cycle in the subjects chosen for
conversation. First it is sex, normal
and otherwise, then religion, then any
number of other subjects, and at the
end sex, always.
A good session, when entered upon,
attempts to make up in part for the
lack of originality of thought in ordi
nary talk. It is too bad that college
students can't inject a few more ideas
into their daily conversation. Unfor
tunately, however, they are lazy, and
even a selected group finds it difficult
to think all the time.
