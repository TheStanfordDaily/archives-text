"CHICKEN FEED"—President.
Once more despite several exams
we ventured into Duffvland —the land
of good, clean fun. "Chicken Feed" is
another comedy of the type so often
seen in Henry Duffy's theatres, one
that tells you at the final that the
good, old family life is the best after
all.
A demand for participation in the
profits as well as a more equal share
of the troubles of marriage partner
ship made by several wives and an
engaged girl start the action of
"Chicken Feed." No longer will wives
be contented with the "chicken feed"
handed out at varying intervals by
husbands. Marriage must be put on a
business basis. So Nell Baily, who is
engaged to a young, romantic in
ventor and who cannot tolerate such
a cold-blooded proposition, influences
her mother and another woman to
leave their husbands in order to bring
them to terms. Independence the wo
men soon discover has many disad
vantages, and the men, who at first
rejoiced in their regained bachelor
hood, after vain attempts at ironing

and cooking, find out that singleness
has many shortcomings.
Laughs on Husbands
The play is a little slow in getting
up steam but the second act when
the two husbands take up housekeep
ing provides the married couples in
the audience with many laughs. There
are many quarrels between husband
and wife which always impress one
with the inconsistency of women. But
despite all the squabbles and misun
derstanding everything turns out hap
pily. As usual a wild-cat investment
turns out to be very profitable and
the play closes with the idea that
family life is the best, that both hus
band and wife have their particular
jobs to fill.
There are many good lines in
'Chicken Feed" and the acting done
in some cases by the New York mem
bers of the cast is good. However,
this type of domestic comedy has
little appeal to the average collegian
who possibly will have to go through
the actual experience before he can
fully appreciate the situations' that
are played up in "Chicken Feed."

her mother and another woman to
leave their husbands in order to bring
them to terms. Independence the wo
men soon discover has many disad
vantages, and the men, who at first
rejoiced in their regained bachelor
hood, after vain attempts at ironing

and cooking, find out that singleness
has many shortcomings.
Laughs on Husbands
The play is a little slow in getting
up steam but the second act when
the two husbands take up housekeep
ing provides the married couples in
the audience with many laughs. There
are many quarrels between husband
and wife which always impress one
with the inconsistency of women. But
despite all the squabbles and misun
derstanding everything turns out hap
pily. As usual a wild-cat investment
turns out to be very profitable and
the play closes with the idea that
family life is the best, that both hus
band and wife have their particular
jobs to fill.
There are many good lines in
'Chicken Feed" and the acting done
in some cases by the New York mem
bers of the cast is good. However,
this type of domestic comedy has
little appeal to the average collegian
who possibly will have to go through
the actual experience before he can
fully appreciate the situations' that
are played up in "Chicken Feed."
