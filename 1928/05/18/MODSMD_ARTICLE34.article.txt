# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
It was unfortunate that one of the
chaperones wah charged to check his
coat at the Junior Prom. In the rush
of checking 200 coats in an hour's
time it is difficult to distinguish who
is who and we apologize for this mis
take.
It is interesting to note that on the
night of the Prom in the women's
cloakroom where no systematic
checking was done, a shawl and a
purse were missed. At all dances
where checking has been done we
have assumed a full responsibility for
all articles left in onr charge.
In past years the slip-shod method
of securing different fellows to do the
checking has been noticeable. This
year we have tried to stabilize the
business and give quick as well as
efficient service.
If Mr. A. L. R. and others think,
"that such a petty charge was wholly
inappropriate at the Prom or any
dance which wishes to maintain a
formal atmosphere" we suggest that
they interview the chairman in
charge. The statement of Mr. A. L. It.
that wo "are hired and adequately
paid for this work by the dance com
mittee," is not true. A nominal charge
is made by us to pay. for our time and
expenses which occur.
"Yours for more formal checking,"

The Editor, Sir:
What price cheap notoriety? Holly
wood seems to have been done one
better! Down there at least, only the
girls go stockingless. I approved of
the girls' bare legs; they were cute,
but it is one thing for a girl to follow

a fad well established in Los Angeles
and another thing for a boy to wear
knickers without sox, solely to cause
starins and smothered laughter!
But then it is only natural for a
male flapper to want to do what Dr.
Jordan had called vulgar, thereby
stimulating his already too-ardent de
sire for publicity. Maybe he thought
his legs were cute. Some people are
naturally a bit queer.
I am hoping that while he is being
childish he will bring his top to class.
