# AND Then Our A Little SALLY---
## 
### 
I am really awfully excited about
the rally this afternoon. I hope I see
every one, I know, because I think
they will all be there. No one who is
really spirited would want to miss
seeing the team leave for the 1.C.-4A.
It really is a thrill to see them all
dressed in clothes. I mean, it is such
a shock to find out so many things
are different when they have to go
on a train.
I bet they all are going to have a
wonderful time. But I don't under
stand how they manage to keep train
ing while they are back there. I
mean, athletes seem to have a pro
pensity for attracting all sorts.
If I were a brave young college
boy I think I would try to go back
with them like some one did last
year. It seems that there would be a
lot of excitement if one could go.
That is, various situations might be
amusing, like hiding when the in
spector comes by.
I wonder why there isn't a girl
track team that could be sent away
on trips. I just know it would be a
lark for all concerned. Girls do love
to travel; and there would be few
dangers because of training rules.
I guess that will never happen,
though, because the men seem to al
ways get the attention for the things
they can do, and the girls only for
what they can't do.
