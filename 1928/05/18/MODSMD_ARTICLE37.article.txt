Ah, these lovely spring mornings.
It's wonderful to lie in bed and
Pull the covers back in place every
ten minutes following each unsuc
cessful attack on the so-and-so mo
squito,
Count the alarm clocks as each one
goes off in its turn up the court and
down the court,
Attempt to convince yourself that
perhaps the phonograph was a won
derful invention after all —it's just
such amateurs as those next door
who ruin its reputation,
Figure out how long you can stay
here and still avoid paying fifty cents
for that library book,
Decide that Harry Lauder was en
tirely wrong in his famous assump
tion that "it's nice to get up in the
morning, but it's nicer to lie in bed."
♦ * *
SUBTILE?
They say that they have some new
Stanford maps now, which means of
course that public opinion always
conquers.

"I hadn't received a letter for two
weeks, so I nearly broke the glass
trying to get that one out of my box
in a hurry. You can imagine my sui
cidal feeling when I saw it was this
—yes, I think it was a mistake —I'm
going over and have a talk with him
today."
