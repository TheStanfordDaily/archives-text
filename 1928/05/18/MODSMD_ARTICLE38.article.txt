Professor Elio Gianturco, who is on

United States, brilliantly illustrated
his lecture on "Modern Italian Music"
on the piano last night in the Little
Theatre. He is the son of the Italian
statesman and jurist, Emanuele Gian
turco.
"Popular songs played a large part
in the inspiration of Russian Com
poser and this influence is felt by
the musicians of every country," ac
cussed by Gianturco in showing the
the French in music is quite superfi
cial when compared to the deep sensi
tiveness of the Italian," he said.
Five modern composers were dis
cussed by Giautrco in showing the
range of modern composers. He
played four dances from the inci
dental music of Pisanella, a drama of
d'Annunzio, to illustrate the original
compositions of Ildebrando Pizetti.
