### 
Additional reports from the Convales
cent Home Drive for "Stanford's Own"
charity bring the total for the contribu
tions up to $2524.28. This amount does
not include any of the pledges which have
been distributed in the men's living groups.
Next Friday will be the last day that
pledges can be turned in, according to Bob
Fraser, chairman of the fiinance commit
tee for the drive, as it is hoped to clear
up all the records for the Convalescent
Home funds by that date.
The women's living groups have almost
attained the very high quota that was set
for them this year, but as yet the men
have only a little over half of theirs.
However, with the additional money given
by the Rally Committee, and that gained
from the concessions donated for Labor
Day ,the total amount for the Home now
is over $2500.
Of this $2524.28, the women have given
$1182.75. $509 comes from Roble, and
the rest from the Row. The men's halls
have given $574.53. Branner, Encina, and
Toyon contributed $401.83, while Sequoia |
gave $96, the Union $41.70, El Cuadro
$22, and El Capitan $13.
