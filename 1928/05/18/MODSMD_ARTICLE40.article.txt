# TRUSTEES APPROVE PLAN FOR EDUCATION PROGRAM
## Doctor of Education Degree Will Be Awarded After Graduate Study 
### 
The Board of Trustees of Stanford
University has recently approved a plan,
submitted by the faculty of the School of
Education, for the establishment of a
three-year graduate program of study
leading to the professional degree of Doc
tor of Education (Ed.D.), and similar to
the plan now followed at Harvard. The
new degree is to be primarily a profes
sional degree, analogous to j.D., M.D.,
D.D., and Engineer.
The proposal to create such a degree
was considered by the faculty of the
School of Education some three years
ago, but was decided against at that time.
The recent reconsideration and final adop
tion of the plan has been due largely to
the interest of President Wilbur in the
idea.
' Reasons for Plan
According to Dean Ellwood P. Cubber
ley of the School of Education, three
main reasons for the new degree were in
fluential in its establishment. First was
the desire to create a professional degree
of equal weight and difficulty with the
present Ph.D. degree, but with the em
phasis on professional preparation and
mastery of educational materials rather
than primarily on research; second was
the desire to provide a master-teacher
type of degree to prepare a better teacher
in subject-matter fields for the rising
junior colleges; and third was the desire
to create a new university degree that
would relieve all departments of the Uni
versity from the pressure of those older
candidates for the Ph.D. degree who are
not primarily interested in research, but
who are good teachers in colleges and
normal schools, and who seek the degree
due to pressure from the institutions with
which they are connected, rather than
from any deep interest in the advance
ment of knowledge through research.
Two Types of Degree
The new degree is to be of two types,
the School Administrator type, primarily
designed to prepare for school adminis
tration and the teaching of Education in
universities, colleges, and normal schools,
and the Master-Teacher type, primarily
designed to prepare a new type of teacher
in subject-matter fields for the junior col
leges and for small colleges generally.
The time requirement for the two types
of the Doctor of Education degree is the
same, viz., a minimum of three years of
study beyond the A.B. degree. Each type
of the degree likewise is based on the
completion of the A.B. and A.M. require
ments for graduation in the School of
Education, except that A.B. graduates
from other schools or departments may
be permitted to make up undergraduate
deficiencies in Education by individual
study, as well as by taking courses.
Each type of the degree will call for
the completion of the requirements for a
teacher's certificate, including major and
minor subjects, and at least two years
of successful experience as a teacher, one
of which must have been subsequent to
taking the A.B. degree. For the master
teacher type of degree the equivalent of
one year of advanced study in Education
will be waived, and the candidate will be
expected to devote this time to advanced
work in a teaching minor such as history,
mathematics, or chemistry, and with a
view to perfecting himself in the subject
matter field as well as in educational the
ory and practice.
Name Chief Differences
The chief differences between the new
degree and the general university degree
of Doctor of Philosophy will lie in that
the emphasis for the new degree will be
placed more on a broad and systematic
knowledge of Education as a field rather

than on research. In place of the lan
guage requirement the candidate will be
expected to evidence a wide mastery of
selected fields in Education, and to extend
his reading and study beyond the scope
of the courses given, much as does the
English university student in the honors
courses.
California Pioneers Degree
California established the first such de
gree some six or seven years ago, and
about four years ago Harvard placed the
new degree on a thoroughly sound foot
ing and has made the work for the de
gree especially attractive to strong and
capable students.
