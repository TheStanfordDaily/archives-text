# STANFORD LIT PRINTS ESSAY ON UNIVERSITY BY PRESIDENT WILBUR
## 
### 
"What's Wrong With Stanford," by
President Wilbur, is the outstanding
feature of the May issue of the Stan
ford Literary Magazine which will go
to press over the week-end. This
number, which is the last of the year,
will also announce the editor, busi
ness director and staff promotions for
the coming year.
President Wilbur's article is the
third and last of the "What's Wrong
With Stanford" series that has been
running in recent numbers of the
"Lit." Fred Speers, who wrote the
first article, gave his views from the
men's standpoint; Hallie Keating
from the women's standpoint, and
now President Wilbur concludes by
dealing with the question from the
faculty standpoint.
"Realism in the Maternity Ward"
is Herb Klein's donation to this issue,
and is a psychological study of the
reactions produced on a young interne
in the ward.
Frank H. Day, brother of A. Grove
Day, the first editor of the Literary
Magazine, has written a clever bur
lesque story for this issue entitled
"Alice in the Rough Country." It is a
parody on "Alice in Wonderland" and
deals with Alice's diverse and amus
ing adventures while on a visit to the
Stanford campus.
For bright cracks and smart epi
grams Laird Doyle's story about
movie actresses in Hollywood is hard
to beat. Helen Stanford deserts the
field of poetry for awhile in this is
sue and breaks into the story realm
with a satire on high art. "Art for
Art's Sake" is commendable for its
cleverness.
This issue of the "Lit" has a light,
satiric atmosphere, and is well-bal
anced. The cover will be done in yel
low and black, as was that of the
February number.
