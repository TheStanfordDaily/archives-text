# SPORTS OF 1928
## When Left Is Right 
### BY “FEG MURRAY, '16 
Left-handed pitchers may be eccen
tric wild, coo-coo, and what have you?
—but good ones, southpaws with a
fair amount of control, win ball
games, and are valuable and neces
sary to every big league pitching staff.
Back in the days when Connie Mack
was winning pennants, he had Wad
dell and Plank in 1902 and Pennock
and Plank in 1914, and now, fourteen
years later, he has Grove, Walberg,
and Orwoll. Can anybody think of
one manager in either "big time" cir
cuit who can match these three port
siders, unless it is Wilbert Robinson
with Petty, Elliott, and Clark, or
Roger Peckinpaugh with Shaute,
Buckeye, and Miller?
"Rube" Walberg, whose real name
is George, is now in his fifth season
as a regular with the Athletics. Last
year, in winning 10 games and losing
10, he twice held the champion Yan

bees to one hit ,and this year, on
April 21, he gave them only six scat
tered hits and shut them out 10 to 0.
In 1927 the New Yorkers were not
whitewashed until September third,
so it may be an omen of what is to
come.
Walberg is a big fellow, standing
C feet 1 inch in height, and weighing
ISS pounds. He was born in Seattle
in July, 1899, and pitched for Port
land of the Pacific Coast league in
1922. The following year the Giants
had him, but he was sent to the Ath
letics on waivers. He worked in 26
games for Mack in 1923, winning 4
and losing 8. Nineteen twenty-four
saw him farmed out to Milwaukee,
where he won 18 and lost 14. Since
then he has been a regular with the
Athletics, and his speed has made
him the toughest pitcher in the
American League for the Yanks, as
well as other teams.
