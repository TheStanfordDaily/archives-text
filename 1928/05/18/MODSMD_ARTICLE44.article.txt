# DAILY BUSINESS STAFF TRIALS FINISH TODAY, STATES CLAUDE CONN
## 
### 
Today is the last chance for stu
dents to try out for the business staff
of The Stanford Daily this quarter,
according to Claude C. Conn, business
manager. No previous experience is
necessary and those wishing to try
out should see Conn in the Daily
business office.
Actual competition among those
who survive the cut to be made at
the end of this quarter will start next
fall when the tryoutees will compete
for a year for the three salaried
junior manager positions. These man
agers have charge of advertising in
the three fields â€”national, local, and
San Francisco. From the three junior
managers the business manager will
be selected in the senior year.

The competitive work next year will
consist of selling advertising, making
surveys, merchandising work, book
keeping work, and office work. For
the balance of this year the tryoutees
will familiarize themselves with the
work of the business department by
working around the office and under
studying the present managers.
