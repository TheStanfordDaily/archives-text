# SEN. HEFLIN ASSERTS CATHOLIC INFLUENCE IN AL SMITH ATTACK

### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 17. —
(U.P.) — Senator Hettin of Alabama
spiced his daily Senate attack on Gover
nor Smith today with assertions that the
Roman Catholic cross and rosary have
been placed on some of the government's
paper money and that the President's
room at the Capitol has been done over—
in anticipation, he suspects—in the colors
of a Roman cardinal.
The Senate chamber was warm and op
pressive and the two dozen of senators
present were dozing over monotonous
routine debate when the doughty senator
from Alabama appeared in white flannel
trousers. His daily attack on Governor
Smith is coming to be a reliable source
of free entertainment for the galleries
and they were packed when he arose to
speak.
