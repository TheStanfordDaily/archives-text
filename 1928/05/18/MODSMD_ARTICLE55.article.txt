# HOOVER, SMITH WINS PREDICTED IN OREGON ELECTION HELD TODAY
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., May 17.—( U.P.)
' —Voters of Oregon will express their
| preference for presidential, district, and
local candidates for the Republican and
Democratic nominations at the Oregon
primary election tomorrow.
Herbert Hoover is unopposed on the
Republican ballot, and having been reared
in Oregon, is such a general favorite here
that it was regarded as a certainty not
only that he would receive a high prefer
ential vote but that candidates for seats
: at the Republican convention expressing
j favor for him would be elected.
Governor Alfred E. Smith of New
i York will win the Democratic preference
by a big vote, it was freely predicted, and
ten delegates pledged to him will un
| doubtedly be elected.
The names of Senator James A. Reed
of Missouri, Senator Thomas J. Walsh
of Montana, and the Rev. Alonzo P.
Workman of Missouri also appear on the
Democratic ballot, but sentiment through
out the state has swung so tremendously
toward Smith, even though Oregon is an
exceedingly bone dry state and is ordi
narily actively anti-Catholic, that victory
for the New York governor was regarded
as certain.
Oregon has thirteen delegates to the
Republican convention at Kansas City.
