# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY RECEIVES COLLECTION OF VALUABLE PAPERS
## 
### 
The Hoover War Library has
lately received from Lwow (Lemberg)
Poland, a very valuable collection of
papers concerning Eastern Galicia
during war and post-war periods. The
collection is a gift of Dr. Karol Bad
ecki, vice-director of the archives of
Lwow, and includes about 500 pamph
lets, proclamations, and news clip
pings from Russian, Hungarian, Ger
man, and Polish newspapers.
Galicia, before the war, was under
Austrian rule, but is now a manda
tory of Poland. Many campaigns were
carried on there between the Austrian
and Russian armies during the war.
Lwow is one of the principal cities of
Poland, and was the scene of much
action between the Polish and Aus
trian aimies.
