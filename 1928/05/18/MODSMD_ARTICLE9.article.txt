The revolutionists are known to have
lost five killed and five wounded. It was
said that other marines probably had been |
wounded.
Medical supplies were dropped to Hun
ter's forces from airplanes Wednesday.
Hunter, with a detachment of twenty
five marines and ten guardsmen, engaged
a force of seventy-five men under com
mand of Jose Leon Diaz. The rebel
forces had been located by airplane and
Hunter ordered the atack with his roving
patrol.
The marine captain proceeded in the
direction indicated but Diaz's scouts had
reported the advancing troops and the
Nicaraguans prepared an ambush. The
engagement began at long range, however,
and the marines pushed the atack and soon
dislodged the Diaz forces, which fled.
PUERTO CABEZAS, Nicaragua,
May 17.—(U.P.) —Rebels commanded by
Augustino Sandino, Nicaraguan rebel,
made a third raid on the American-owned
La Luz mine in the Pis Pis district and
burned all buildings except two, Harry P. j
Amphlett, a Britisher, superintendent of i
the mine, said upon his arrival here today j
en route to New York to consult with
officials of the La Luz Company.
Amphlett said he found a letter ad
dressed to him at the mine threatening to
kill all Americans who fell into the hands
of the Sandinistas. The letter was signed
by Sandino and bore a seal picturing Ni
caragua under the heels of a United |
States marine with a drawn sword.
The letter said Sandino had become j
convinced that North Americans were in
sympathy with the government's policy in j
Nicaragua, and if any of them fell into:
his hands "they will have reached their
end."
