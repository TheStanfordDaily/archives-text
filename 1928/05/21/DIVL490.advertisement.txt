The eminent European psychologist
DE WALDOZA
WILL CONDUCT HIS FAMOUS SERIES OF MENTAL SUGGESTIVE
EXPERIMENTS
De Waldoza's experiments are of so strange and thrilling a nature as
to seem impossible. He gains influence over the human powers of
mind and body—over the senses and actions —although the subject be
fully conscious.
While under the influence of De Waldoza, the will loses its power.
He will prove to you that all the power of will and body can avail
nothing when pitted against his suggestions.
