# SENIORS TIE FRESHMEN IN INTERCLASS SOCCER GAME WITH 0-0 SCORE
## 
### 
With a discouraging finish the
freshmen, who were doped to down
the seniors in the interclass soccer
game Friday afternoon, were unable
to make a single goal, the final score
being 0-0. The seniors played again
with only eight men, and while this
may appear to be a disadvantage it
has its advantages.
The seniors played their usual
rushing and kicking game, and the
freshmen were unable to meet the
onslaught sufficiently to put over a
goal. With apparent ease, the fresh
men kept the ball in the vicinity of
the goal, but through misfortunes and
inefficient playing lost the ball every
time to the seniors.
According to Harry Maloney, the
freshmen showed too much team
work in front of the goal, and in their
endeavors to pass the ball about
from one player to another missed
good chances to drive through a goal
or two.
If the juniors are successful in de
feating the sophomores today, they
will acquire the Interclass Champion
ship. Otherwise the freshmen will
have to meet them again for the final
event.
