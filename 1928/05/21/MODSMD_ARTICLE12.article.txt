# SPECTATORS FAVOR STANFORD IN U.S.C. WOMEN'S DEBATE
## Marion Klocksen, Katherine Drew Victors in Final Forensic Contest 
### 
By a majority of two votes, the
audience at the Stanford-S.C. women's
1 debate last Friday night voted in
: favor of the negative on the merits
of the question, "Resolved, That
American investors and investments
should be protected only by the gov
ernment of the country in which the
investment is made."
Betty Henninger and Eleanor
i Veale, supporting the negative for
Southern California, showed a foren
| sic style like that of the popular Ox
ford debaters. Their principal argu
ments were that the main object of
government is protection, and that
only in a chaotic country, whose
i home government cannot give its
citizens this protection, does Amer-
I ica intervene. Increase of education
! and reduction of national debts were
i claimed to be results of this peaceful
[ intervention.
The Stanford squad, composed of
, Marion Klocksen and Katherine
Drew, claimed that America's present
' policy toward Latin-American coun
tries is unsound because it violates
the sovereignty of these nations and
is contrary to the trend of interna
tional law, leading to war and loss
of life. Tt was also declared an un
due extravagance on the part of the
United States.
Decision by the audience was to be
made wholly on the grounds of the
merits of the question, uninfluenced
by the debate. Dean Olivia Boezin
ger presided over the contest. This
is the first held by the Stanford wom
en with a southern university, and
the last women's debate of the year.
