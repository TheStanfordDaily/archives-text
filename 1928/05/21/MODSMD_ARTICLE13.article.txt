ST. JOHNS, Newfoundland, May 10.
—(IT.P.) —The German transatlantic
airplane Bremen, which made the
first westward crossing of the Atlan
tic, crashed and was badly damaged
today in attempting to take off for
resumption of its journey to New
York.
The Bremen rose under full power,
then stalled, wavered, and fell to the
ice-covered ground. None of the occu
pants was injured.
The accident occurred at Long
Point, Laborador, just across the nar
row Belle Isle Straits from Greenly
Island, where the plane landed after
its transatlantic flight.
Fred Melchior, crack Junker's pilot
who was dropped by parachute from
an American Army airplane Saturday
to bring the Bremen out, was at the
controls when the accident occurred.
