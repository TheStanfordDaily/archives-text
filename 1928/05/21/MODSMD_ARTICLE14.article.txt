Fourteen kinds of pyramids were
formed by the Stanford Gym Team
Friday evening in an exhibition in
the apparatus room of Encina Gym
nasium. Work on the long horse,
parallel bars, elephant, rings, horizon
tal bar, mats, and spring board pre
ceded the pyramids. Darwin Peavey
and Vernon Perron gave a tumbling
exhibition; this team has been seen
several times in local entertainments.
Clarence Naff, who won a first place
in tumbling for Stanford in the minor
sports conference at Los Angeles this
year, was also seen in action.
