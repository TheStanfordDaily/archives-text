# CHAPPIE TO REFLECT OLD BOY'S INSANITY
## 
### 
The Old Boy has "gone crazy with
the heat." He admits it himself, and
In addition, says that his insanity will
be reflected in the next and last issue
of Chaparral this year. He is in the
market for art and literary contri
butions and is said to be particularly
partial in selecting copy with a pes
simistic note.
In compliance with this policy,
Chappie will specialize on "razzes"
of every sort and subject, as well as
parodies and burlesques. Verses, two
lino jokes, and semi-short copy is
desired as usual.
Wednesday is the deadline for all
art contributions. Literary contribu
lions may be handed in a bit later,
but the Old Hoy suggests that humor
ists get in touch with him before com
pleting their manuscripts.
