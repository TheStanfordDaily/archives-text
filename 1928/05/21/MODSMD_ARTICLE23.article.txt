# COPENHAGEN PHYSICIST WILL GIVE SERIES OF LECTURES HERE SOON
## 
### 
H. A. Kramers, mathematical physicist
in the University of Copenhagen, will ar
rive at Stanford June 1 to deliver a three
weeks' series of lectures on wave me
chanics to graduate students. His work
deals with the mathematical theory of the
transfer of electrons within the orbits of
atoms, and with the new theory that
electrons are a group of waves.
Kramers lias been at the University of
Toronto, and will lecture at the Univer
sity of Minnesota before coming here.
He will be on the summer session faculty
at Michigan.
"Kramers is one of the leading mathe
matical physicists of the world, and we
consider it a great privilege to have him
here," said Professor David L. Webster
of the Physics department.
