Fighting down an exciting rally in
the second game. Tackabury and
Sibbett beat Stevenson and Sobieski,
21-G, 22-20, in their first-round match
of the 1928 Handball Doubles Tourna
ment Saturday. Sobieski. who played
with Stevenson instead of Duvall, led
the losers' rally.
Brown and Jones defeated White
and Dunn 21-6, 21-8 in the other match
played over the week-end. There now
remain in the first round only the
matches McDermott and Mandell vs.
J Walker and Mahy, and Stein and
Paradise vs. Meyberg and Levit.
These will probably be played some-
I time today.
