EAST LANSING, Mich., May 20. —
(P.I.P.) —Smoking by girls in dormi
tories, sorority houses, or other off
campus buildings, was forbidden by
a unanimous vote of the W.S.G.A. of
Michigan State College. Stating that
the fire hazard, though important, was
only a secondary consideration, the
members declared in a formal state
ment that the main reason was for
the maintenance of high ethical
standards.
