# TWO SORTS OF PEOPLE
## 
### 
There are two sorts of people in the world, who, with equal degrees of
health and wealth, and the other comforts of life, become, the one happy,
and the other miserable. This arises very much from the different views in
which they consider things, persons, and events; and the effect of those
different views upon their own minds.
In whatever situation men can be placed they may find conveniences and
inconveniences; in whatever company they may find persons and conversa
tion more or less pleasing; at whatever table they may meet with meats and
drinks of better and worse taste, dishes better and worse dressed; in whatever
climate they will find good and bad weather; under whatever government,
they may find good and bad laws, and good and bad administration of those
laws; in whatever poem or work of genius they may see faults and beauties;
in almost every face and every person they may discover fine features and
defects, good and bad qualities.
Under these circumstances the two sorts of people above mentioned fix
their attention; those who are disposed to be happy, on the convenience of
things, the pleasant parts of conversation, the well-dressed dishes, the good
ness of the wines, the fine weather, etc., and enjoy all with cheerfudness.
Those who are to be unhappy think and speak only of the conti-aries. Hence,
they are continually discontented themselves, and by their remarks, sour
the pleasures of society, offend personally many people, and make themselves
everywhere disagreeable. If this turn of mind was founded in nature, such
unhappy persons would be the more to be pitied. But as the disposition to
criticize, and to be disgusted, is perhaps taken up originally by imitation,
and is unawares grown into a habit, which, though at present strong, may
nevertheless be cured, when those have it are convinced of its bad effects on
their felicity .... If these people will not change this bad habit, and conde
scend to be pleased with what is pleasing, without fretting themselves and
others about the contraries, it is good for others to avoid an acquaintance
with them; which is always disagreeable and sometimes very inconvenient,
especially when one finds one's self entangled in their quarrels.â€”FRANKLIN.
