# ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY
## 
### 
There is no more valuable subordinate than the man to whom you can
give a piece of work and then forget it, in the confident expectation that the
next time it is brought to your attention it will come in the form of a report
that the thing has been done. When this self-reliant quality is joined to
executive power, loyalty, and common sense, the result is a man whom
you can trust.
On the other hand, there is no greater nuisance to a man heavily bur
dened with the direction of affairs than the weak-backed assistant who is
continually trying to get his chief to do his work for him on the feeble plea
that he thought the chief would like to decide this or that himself. The
man to whom an executive is most grateful, the man whom he will work
hardest and value most, is the man who accepts responsibility willingly.
