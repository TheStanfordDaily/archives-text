# THE 						UPSTART AND THE HUMBLE
## 
### 
The man who, by some sudden revolution of fortune, is lifted up all at
once into a condition of life greatly above what he had formerly lived in,
may be assured that the congratulations of his best friends are not all of
them perfectly sincere. An upstart, though of the greatest merit, is generally
disagreeable, and a sentiment of envy commonly prevents us from heartily
sympathizing with his joy. If he has any judgment, he is sensible of this, and,
instead of appearing to be elated with his good fortune, he endeavors, as
much as he can, to smother his joy, and keep down that elevation of mind
with which his new circumstances naturally inspire him. He affects the same
plainness of dress, and the same modesty of behavior, which became him in
his former station. He redoubles his attention to his old friends, and en
deavors more than ever to be humble, assiduous, and complaisant. And this
is the behavior which in his situation we most approve of; because we
expect, it seems, that he should have more sympathy with our envy and
aversion to his happiness, than we have with his happiness. It is seldom
that with all this he succeeds. We suspect the sincerity of his humility, and
he grows weary of this constraint. —ADAM SMITH.
