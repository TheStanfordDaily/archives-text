Today is your day and mine, the only day we have, the day in which we
play our part. What our part may signify in the great whole wo may not
understand; but we are here to play it and now is our time. This we know:
It Is a part of action, not of whining. It is a part of love, not cynicism. It
is for us to express love In terms of human helpfulness.—DAVlD STARR

No man lives without Jostling and being jostled; in all ways he has to
elbow himself through the world, giving and receiving offense.—CARLYLE.
