"Cursed Be the Treasure," by H. B.
Drake. Macy-Masius, publishers.
Here's a rip-roaring story of a life
long enmity that leads a chase over
all England, on the sea, and comes
back faithfully to a treasure-cave
and a haunted house.
The hero, like most heroes of ad
venture stories, is not remarkable,
and even lapses into unutterable stu
pidity at intervals. But he ends up
happily in the right place, as such
heroes have a knack of doing.
There are thoroughly gripping bat
tles, hair-raising ghost scenes, and
(pardon our dutch) a devil of a mess
straightened out partly by a master
mind and partly by pure luck. There
are a few unnecessary details thrown
in that could have been spared us,
but practically every maze through
which the tale seems to lose itself for
a time eventually leads to the same
end.
Every incident in the story has its
basis in the existence of a treasure
and a Latin manuscript which, be

sides telling how to find the hoard,
lays a perpetual curse upon it. The
working out of that curse, chiefly
through guilty consciences and mis
understandings, is the theme of the
story.
The hero, however, is not one of
the seeders of the treasure. His chief
occupation is quite fortuitously get
ting in the way of the hatred between
the various seekers, and struggling
vainly to break away from its path.
Eventually, of course, he does emerge
from the gloom of strife into com
parative calm.
The book was recommended to us,
with the comment that it was rather
like "Treasure Island." Well, it is,
but it is packed with much more en
tanglement, and the style, although it
has a touch of the Stevensonian,
shows also marked traces of Con
rad's influence.
But that doesn't deter us from pass
ing the book on, and our remark in
so doing is, "Read it; it's corking
good."
