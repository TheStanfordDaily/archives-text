A MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION
"Didja know that Emma Fervor has
a little sister?" asked Archie as he
dropped into our room last night.
"No, Emma never said a word
about a little sister. How did you
find out?"
"I was looking Emma up in the
'bawlout' and I noticed that there
were two Fervors! There's a new
frosh girl by the same name."
"Why didn't Emma tell us?"
"You never saw a girl that would
tell you all about a little sister —es-
pecially if that little sister has more
on the ball than she has. That's not
being done this season."
"Does she write stories too?"
"Does she write? Dunt esk! Read!"
Archie handed me a neatly typed
manuscript. "This will serialize as
well as Emma's great story, 'A Nest,
A Vest, and You.' "
"What's her name?"
"Her name is Lotta —and she has
a nice low scholastic average."
"Hm-m-m. She must be a nice
girl."
Editor's Note.—We are going to
start publication of Lotta Fervor's
marvelous thriller, "Three Buckets of
Blood, or The Mystery of the Butcher
shop."

The Editor, Sir:
The Junior Prom was too easy on
the roughs. They let us in the bal
cony and gave us an unobstructed
view of the dance. To make matters
worse we were invited around to the
side door to swill some left-over
punch. 'Tain't right! It looks like
politics to us!
