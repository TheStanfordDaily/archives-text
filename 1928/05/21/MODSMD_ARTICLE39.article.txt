# MEN RENOUNCE BLAZERS Neckties, Lapels Are Narrow JACKETS WEDGE-SHAPED
## 
### Beau Peep 
Impecunious college men will wel
come the news now released that the
Oxford gray suits of bluish cast so
good this spring and summer are to
be equally good this fall, so that all
those who were far-sighted enough or
intuitive enough to avail themselves
of one will be in the mood for self
congratulation.
It should also be interesting to
Western university men that the
wedge-shaped, two- or three-button
jacket which has been worn out here
for the last two years and was on
the verge of being given up has be
come highly popular in the East and
so is given a new lease on life every
where else.
Three-Button Arrives
The three-button jacket with only
two buttoned, promises to replace to
a great extent the all-tliree-buttoned
style previously worn. This will mean
more Hymo fronts instead of the stiff
hair cloth that makes a roll front im
possible. And when only two are but
toned the front is rolled over the top
button.
Both hat brims and coat lapels are
narrower this year, a two-inch brim
b6ing the proper width. In the matter
of straws, the Panamas are far and
away the leaders, among university
men, a fact easily explained because
the snap brim is the collegiate sine
qua non. Colored bands are taboo
this summer, and the one-inch black
band takes their place.
Ties Are Narrower
Neckties, too, are narrower, espe
cially the bow variety; and the new
est thing for evening is a very nar
row pointed one. Small checks and
figures are just as good now as they
were at the beginning of the season
and large stripes have receded to the
background.
Sweaters have at last gotten free
from the crew neck and have won the
favor of university men in more of a
V shape—not quite V, but called
"fashion neck" instead. They are still
mostly in pastel shades —yellows and
blues, etc.
Last year's plus fours have elon
gated into plus sixes, and are as much
in demand as ever, with the single
plaid linens possibly in the lead. The
erstwhile traditional white flannels
have staged a come-back and prom
ise to grace the summer's verandahs
and lawns. Besides flannel, they are
being shown in Bedford cords, and
are worn with any dark coat.
What with the women running
away with the striped blazer, the
men have been reduced to wearing
only plain colored ones, usually in
camel's hair. The loud blazer has
become about as feminine as the cig
arette holder.

toned the front is rolled over the top
button.
Both hat brims and coat lapels are
narrower this year, a two-inch brim
b6ing the proper width. In the matter
of straws, the Panamas are far and
away the leaders, among university
men, a fact easily explained because
the snap brim is the collegiate sine
qua non. Colored bands are taboo
this summer, and the one-inch black
band takes their place.
Ties Are Narrower
Neckties, too, are narrower, espe
cially the bow variety; and the new
est thing for evening is a very nar
row pointed one. Small checks and
figures are just as good now as they
were at the beginning of the season
and large stripes have receded to the
background.
Sweaters have at last gotten free
from the crew neck and have won the
favor of university men in more of a
V shape—not quite V, but called
"fashion neck" instead. They are still
mostly in pastel shades —yellows and
blues, etc.
Last year's plus fours have elon
gated into plus sixes, and are as much
in demand as ever, with the single
plaid linens possibly in the lead. The
erstwhile traditional white flannels
have staged a come-back and prom
ise to grace the summer's verandahs
and lawns. Besides flannel, they are
being shown in Bedford cords, and
are worn with any dark coat.
What with the women running
away with the striped blazer, the
men have been reduced to wearing
only plain colored ones, usually in
camel's hair. The loud blazer has
become about as feminine as the cig
arette holder.
Impecunious college men will wel
come the news now released that the
Oxford gray suits of bluish cast so
good this spring and summer are to
be equally good this fall, so that all
those who were far-sighted enough or
intuitive enough to avail themselves
of one will be in the mood for self
congratulation.
It should also be interesting to
Western university men that the
wedge-shaped, two- or three-button
jacket which has been worn out here
for the last two years and was on
the verge of being given up has be
come highly popular in the East and
so is given a new lease on life every
where else.
Three-Button Arrives
The three-button jacket with only
two buttoned, promises to replace to
a great extent the all-tliree-buttoned
style previously worn. This will mean
more Hymo fronts instead of the stiff
hair cloth that makes a roll front im
possible. And when only two are but
toned the front is rolled over the top
button.
