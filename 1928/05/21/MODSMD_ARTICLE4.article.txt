## 
### 
"During the time I have
worked at Stanford I haven't
seen a single student under the
influence of liquor!" Campus
Traffic Officer John Olsen, in
the Saturday issue of the Palo
Alto Times, made this statement
which will shock the black
gloved pessimists from Oshkosh
to Omaha, and disrupt all the
jokes of college humorists for
months to come.
Much has been said concern
ing the amount of bootleg in
bibed by the younger generation,
but Olsen's experiences seem to
prove that the whole thing is
just another "yarn," as far as
Stanford is concerned.
The Campus Cop declares that
University students are just as
careful about driving as anyone
else. He admits that occasional
arrests are necessary, as shown
by the .$385.50 in fines which
have been added to the money
chests from January to April.
