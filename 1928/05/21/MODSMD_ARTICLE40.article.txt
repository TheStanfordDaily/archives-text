# BAGSHAW WILL BUILD U. OF W. GRID SQUAD ON THIRTY-ONE MEN

SEATTLE, Wash., May 20.—P.1.P.)
—Next year's University of Washing
ton football team will be built around
a group of thirty-one men, as shown
by the spring turnout now under way.
Coach Enoch W. "Baggy" Bagshaw
has eleven lettermen in line for the
team, among whom is Chuck Carroll,
the great Purple and Gold halfback,
who consistently tore through other
Coast elevens in 1927.
With no exceptional qrfirterback
and a loss of seven forwards from his
last fall's line, including many all-
Coast men and the captain-elect,
Clarence Dirks, the coach's job looks
like one of insurmountable difficul
ties. But with two fleet ball carriers
in Thurle Thornton and Carroll, and
a prospective stellar fullback in the
person of Johnnie Dalquest, the
Washington team may yet shape into
another Purple Tornado.
