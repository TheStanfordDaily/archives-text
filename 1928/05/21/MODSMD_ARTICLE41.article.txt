# BARNES VAULTS USING SHORT POLE IN FRESNO TO BREAK WORLD MARK

LOS ANGELES, May 20.—(P.1.P.)
—Captain Lee Barnes, vaulting avi
rato on Coach Dean Cromwell's IJ.S.C.
track team, used a pole 2 3-4 inches
shorter than the world's record of
14 feet, 1 and 3-4 inches when he
made his record-breaking leap at the
annual West Coast Relays in Fresno.
The Trojan captain, who also holds
the Olympic vaulting record, cracked
his 14 foot, 1 inch pole on his first
jump after Savin Carr's world mark.
Instead of calling for a longer stick,
Barnes used one that was 13 feet
11 inches long.
Barnes holds his pole about two
feet lower than the height he expects
to clear. Part of the secret of his
success, according to Coach Dean
Cromwell, lies in the speed with
which he approaches the take-off.
This speed is considerably aided by
the use of a comparatively short, light
pole.
