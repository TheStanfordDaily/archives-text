# "THE ADMIRAL" TELLS EXPERIENCES AS HALL TELEPHONE OPERATOR
## 
### Howard Moore 
"The fine art of being a good tele
phone operator is no snap," declares
William Rigden, known in Toyon cir
cles as "The Admiral." "Not only
must he have a clear head and a good
memory but he must also have tact
and be a good deal of a diplomat."
Rigden has been the campus ex
change operator in the Toyon office
since it opened five years ago.
The exchange is in operation from
7 o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock
at night and handles calls to and
from 257 rooms in Encina, ninety-five
rooms in Toyon, and eighty-two rooms
in Branner and the Union respective
ly. The Union answers the calls the
quickest and has the fewest number.
Encina, however, outnumbers all the
other halls put together by three to
one in the matter of number of calls.
On a busy day, especially on Saturday
morning, it is not uncommon to have
as many as eighty to ninety in one
hour.
Perfects System
"The Admiral" has done much to
perfect the telephone system. A night
book is kept in which all important
calls not completed by 10 o'clock are
posted and the students are then noti
fied before they leave for classes the
next morning. All the numbers of the
men in the halls have been placed in
a revolving file. Each card has a bit
of ribbon on it to show to what hall
the man belongs.
Since he has been the telephone
operator, Rigden has had many hu
morous experiences. One of the most
common occurrences is the San Fran
cisco operator who endeavors to get
En-sigh-na Hotel and, if the person
called is not in, requests that he be
paged. He often has trouble with
girls who ring up with "very impor
tant messages and ask if the men can
be paged in the classrooms." Tuesday
and Thursday are the busiest nights
for the operator probably due to dat
ing up for the week-ends.
Started at Toyon
Five years ago Toyon was the only
hall to have individual room service,
but later the system was extended to
Branner and the Union. A year later
Encina installed room service, and
now Sequoia is the only hall without
it.
