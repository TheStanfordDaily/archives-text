# U.S.C. LACKS MEN FOR 1928 FOOTBALL SQUAD

### 
LOS ANGELES, May 20.—(P.1.P.)
—Howard Jones, coach of the foot
ball teams at the University of South
ern California, doesn't much care
who plays on his 1928 Trojan team.
This may seem a strange statement
but Jones believes that the losses the
Southern California team sustained,
because of graduation and scholar
ship, mean that his next season's
team will be almost all new faces.
At the end of spring practice at
IJ.S.C. last week critics agreed that
the Trojans will be lucky if men ca
pable of filling the holes are available
next fall.
