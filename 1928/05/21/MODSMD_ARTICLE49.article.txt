## Can Jimmy Stop Sammy? 
### BY "FEG MURRAY, '16 
Since Sammy Mandell, synthetic
lightweight champion of the world,
won his title from the ancient Rocky
Kansas in 3926, he has confined him
self to boxing such nobodies as Joe
Jawson, Larry Cappo, Clausine Vin
cent, Jack Duffy, Ray Moore, Jimmy
Lanning, Eddie Dwyer, Ammando
Shekels, etc., etc., etc., Shekels being
as good a place as any to stop, be
cause that is what little Sammy is
out for, and why not? Only a couple
of names mean anything in Mandell's
record for the past two years, a
twelve-round no-decision bout with
Jackie Fields in Los Angeles and a
ten-round win from Phil McGraw, the
fast fading florist in Detroit.
Now the pussy-footing champion is
going to risk his title at last, and
when I say "risk," I mean just that.
Folks who have seen Jimmy McLarnin

in action, especially in his knock-out
victories over Kid Kaplan and Sid
Terris, are confident that "Baby
Face" has a grand chance of win
ning by a K.O. At any rate, the in
terest in this bout is partially mak
ing up for what the Tunney-Heeney
fracas lacks, and is restoring pres
tige to a division once honored by a
long list of real fighting champions
like McAuliffe, Lavigne, Gans, Nelson,
Wolgast, Ritchie, and Leonard.
While McLarnin's critics point to
his fights with Bud Taylor and
Tommy Cello, and say that Mandell
will have no difficulty in outpointing
Jimmy, at the same time avoiding his
deadly right hand, nevertheless Mc-
Larnin has been fighting oftener and
against better opponents than Sammy,
and so should have an even chance
to win the title.
