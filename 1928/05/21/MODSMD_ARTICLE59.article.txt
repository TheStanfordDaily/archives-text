# PENINSULA PUBLISHERS END ANNUAL MEETING HERE WITH LUNCHEON
## 
### 
Round-table discussions and a
luncheon at Encina Commons yester
day ended the annual two-day meet
ing of peninsula and hay region pub
lishers, held on the campus over the
week-end. About forty newspaper men
of the region were present as guests
of the University.
The value of state publishers' or
ganizations was stressed by speakers
at the dinner held Friday night in the
Stanford Union. Colin Dyment, pub
lisher of the Hayward Review, former
dean of the school of journalism at
the University of Washington and
professor of journalism at the Univer
sity of Oregon, talked informally on
the accomplishments of the publish
ers' organizations of the two north
western states. He emphasized par
ticularly the assistance given by the
journalism departments of the state
universities and expressed the hope
that some similar movement could
be started in California.
The chief speaker of the evening
was Professor J. Hugh Jackson of
the Graduate School of Business. Pro
fessor Jackson spoke on the budget
plan, urging the publishers the ne
cessity of operating under that sys
tem, and presenting simple types of
budgets for their consideration. He
advised them to bo conservative in
estimating their probable income and
generous in setting down probable ex
penses.
Professor Everett W. Smith, head
of the Stanford journalism depart
ment, was toastmaster for the eve
ning.
