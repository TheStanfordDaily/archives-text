LOS ANGELES, May 20.—(P.1.P.)
—Nelson Berry, a quarterback on the
frosh eleven at U.S.C. last year, won
the annual punting championship of
the Trojan football men last week.
He led in kicks for accuracy, had a
perfect score in five tries for goal
after touchdown, averaged better
than fifty yards in boots for distance,
and sent three out of five drop-kicks
through the uprights.
