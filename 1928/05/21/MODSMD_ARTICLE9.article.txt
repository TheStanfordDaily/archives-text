# Four Hundred In Track Meet For Intramural Title
## Hold Broad Jump, Century Heats Today to Open Mural Competition 
### 
With the intramural championship,
two plaques, and gold, silver, and
bronze medals at stake, as well as
seven records, the annual Spring
Quarter Track and Field Meet and
Relay Carnival will get under way at
2 o'clock this afternoon on the Prac
tice Oval. It is estimated that close
to 400 men, representing more than
thirty intramural organizations, will
compete this year. In the 1927 meet
303 people took part.
The 100-yard dash and broad jump
are listed on the schedule for to
day's competition. Marshal Hale, for
mer track captain, established the
intramural record for the century
several years ago while competing
for Sigma Nu, when he negotiated the
distance in 10 s. flat. Wesly Doe of
Breakers equaled this mark last year.
The broad jump record of 22 ft. 7 in.
was set four years ago by Marshal
Crookshank, Delta Upsilon.
The 120-yard hurdles and the shot
put are the events on tomorrow's pro
gram. A. M. Ely, Delta Chi, holds the
record of I', 1-5 in the hurdles. A1
Forster, Zeta Psi, established the shot
put record of 44 ft. 2 in. during his
freshman year.
The other two events, the 880-yard
run and the discus, are scheduled for
Thursday. R. R. Mcintosh, Sigma Nu,
holds the record for the half mile
with a mark of 1 m. 57 s., while David
Taffy Evans, Alpha Delta Phi, holds
the discus record of 144 ft. 6VÂ£ in.
The trial heats for the eight-man
mile relay will be held Wednesday
afternoon, and the final heat Friday
afternoon. The record of 3: 10 7-10
was set by Breakers two years ago.
Each intramural group may enter
as many men as desired in any
event, and of this number the points
made by the ten highest of one
group in a particular event will be
counted. Besides group competition
there is individual competition, and
standard intramural medals will be
awarded to the three men with the
highest point totals for the six
events. The scoring system is such
that it is possible for one person to
make 6000 points. A world's record
or a near world's record in any event
counts for 1000 points. G. L. Gil
bert, Sigma Nu, was the high scorer
last year with a total of 3043.
Any registered student who has not
received class numerals or a block
"S" in track is eligible to compete.
