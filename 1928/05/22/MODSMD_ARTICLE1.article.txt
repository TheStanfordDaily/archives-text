# CARDS FAVORED TO TAKE I.C.-4A. TITLE IN EAST
## Thirty-Two Colleges Will Be Represented in Harvard Athletic Classic Hope of East Lies in Yale With Sabin Carr, Ross Star Performers 
### Bob Speers 
While Coach Dink Templeton and
his crew of Cardinal tracksters are
â€¢speeding eastward, sports scribes in
all parts of the country are busy at
their typewriters trying to figure the
exact margin by which Stanford may
be expected to cop the 1.C.-4A. meet
in Boston this coming week-end.
Even on the Atlantic seaboard the
Cards are considered overwhelming
favorites to win. Thirty-two colleges
will send teams to this, the fifty-sec
ond I.C.A.A.A.A. classic, and not one
appears to have the strength on the
field and on the track that Temple
ton's men can boast.
Hope for Western Win
Another Stanford victory will mean
the seventh Western triumph in
eight years. The University of Cali
fornia won in 1921, 1922, and 1923.
Then in 1925 and 1926 U.S.C. carried
the title back West, and last season
Stanford annexed the coveted trophy.
Yale, it seems, will be the white
hope of the East this year, with Sabin
Carr, pole vaulter, and Launcelot
"Ross, dash man, as stellar performers.
Other well-balanced outfits which are
to be in the field are Harvard, Cor
nell, Princeton, Penn State, Syracuse,
"Holy Cross, Pennsylvania, Columbia,
and New York University, but not one
of these can present a galaxy of speed
and brawn which stacks up favorably
against the Stanford roster. U.S.C.
can be counted upon to offer plenty
of opposition in some departments,
but no real danger is expected from
that quarter.
Should Better Scoring
Last year Stanford piled up 36V&
points, with the nearest competitor,
Penn State, garnering 27. Endless pos
sibilities loom for Templeton's team
this season. That the scoring of 1927
will be bettered seems more than
likely, and it's not overly improbable
that a point-garnering record will be
set when the smoke of battle clears
away from the staid towers of old
Harvard.
