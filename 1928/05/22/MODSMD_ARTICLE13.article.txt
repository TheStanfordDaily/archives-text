turning in the fastest time in the century,
George E. Bradley, Alpha Sigma Phi,
carried off high point honors with a total
of 1848 points yesterday in the opening

C. H. Beatty, Theta Xi, and Virgil
Dowell, Phi Kappa Psi, were second and
third in the scoring with totals of 1676
and 1636, respectively. They both sprinted
the hundred in 10 3-5 s. to tie for third
place honors in this event. In the broad
jump Beatty took second with a leap of
21 ft. 11 in., and Dowell jumped 21 ft.
6 in. to take third. C. Recknagel, running
for Encina II, turned in the second fastest
time in the hundred with a mark of 10
2-5 s.
200 Take Part

ous organizations, took part in the meet,
and it is estimated that a new record for

put are the events on today's program. A.
M. Bly, Delta Chi, holds the record of
13 1-5 s., while Al Forster, Zeta Psi, is
credited with the shot put record of 44
