## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 21 — (U.P.) —
The Senate was held in session to
night in an effort to get final action
on the tax reduction bill. Senator
Smoot, in charge of the measure, an
nounced he would keep the Senate in
session all night if necessary to get
action.
The Senate met at 10 a.m., today,
two hours in advance of the usual
time, and sat straight through the
evening without recessing for dinner.
Society hostesses had to revise their
dinner arrangements for absent sen
ators. The Senate sat until midnight
Saturday and may be in session sev
eral nights this week.
After long and bitter debate the
Senate rejected the farm tariff meas
ure amendment to the tax hill of
fered by Senator Reed, Missouri
Democrat, 53 to 23.
On the asumption that the Presi
dent would veto the McNary-Haugen
farm relief bill, Reed urged the de
benture rider to the tax bill as an
alternative form of farm relief. This
plan, recommended by the National
Grange, is intended to apply the pro
ceeds of the protective tariff directly
to the farmers. It would permit the
exporter of farm products to receive
debentures permitting them to im
port, duty free, products equal to the
value of twenty-five per cent of their
export.
