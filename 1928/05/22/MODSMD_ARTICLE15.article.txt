# Brandsten Trains Five Prospects For Diving Title
## Contenders For National Championship Prepare For Meet Friday 
### 
There are five outstanding contenders
j for the Junior National Outdoor Diving
Championship title who are now working
i at Encina pool under Coach Ernst Brand
| sten. These men, Ed Throndson and
i Herb Marsh of Stanford, Herman Ring
ler of the Pennsylvania Athletic Club,
' Heinie Groh of Illinois University, and
i Wally Colbath of Northwestern Univer-
J sitv, are entered in this meet, which
will he held in Encina pool next Friday.
Ed Throndson, varsity man, entered un- 1
attached in the P.A.A. diving champion-!
ship which was held at the Olympic Club'
pool of San Francisco Sunday night, took
third against A1 White, Olympic cham
pion, and Guertin Carrol, who was per-1
forming in his home tank.
Throndson Promising
Spectators called Throndson an "A1
White in the rough," and men who have j
watched his progress all year said that !
he at last looked like a real diver. The
contest was very close, much more so than |
; the results seem to indicate, so it is figured
I that the varsity contender will be a figure
to be reckoned with next Friday.
Herb Marsh, Stanford freshman, is
looking very good in practice, Marsh's
: lack of experience makes it hard to pre
dict just how he will stand up under the
; strain of competition.
Ringler Good
Herman Ringler, the Middle-Aatlantic
| champion, has had a great deal of experi
! ence in the three years during which he
has competed, and shows it. Somersault
or tumbling dives are this man's strong
suit, and if he can bring his gainers and
back-takeoffs up to snuff he will have one
of the best chances to win.
The Big Ten champion, Heinie Groh, is
handicapped by a lack of high-board ex
perience. His work in collegiate circles
j has been mostly on the thrqe-foot board,
| and it is a question as to whether or not
|he can adapt himself to the different
: height with sufficient ease to come
through for a victory.
Colbath is at present in Hollywood giv
ing an exhibition at the Hollywood Ath
letic Club, and expccts to return for the j
meet Friday. He holds the intercollegiate
record.
