# Stanford Okey—Says Prexy
## 
### 
President Wilbur writes an article published in The Stanford Literary
Magazine, which is being sold this morning. The article is entitled, "Stan
ford Is All Right." Pursuant to his title, he praises the fact that cheap
standards seem to be making less appeal, and that the student body is
reaching out for sound principles. He says, "Personally, I have full con
fidence in our present group of students." The whole essay has the appear
ance of showing a great deal of satisfaction on the President's part in
Stanford students. But, we ask you, how else could he feel when writing
for publication?
It has been said of Ray Lyman Wilbur that when he gets up to talk one
can be assured he is going to say the right thing. Now that can be taken in
two ways: one giving a connotation that he is merely a pretty clever poli
tician, and the other, that the things he says are apropos of the time and
place. We use the latter meaning. At a cursory glance the article may look
a bit like soft soap, since students are the ones who will read the magazine,
but here and there we find little interjections that are far from being soap
of the runny variety.
For example, "The present sham of pledging rules is as obvious as it
is unnecessary." This is a direct charge at the manner in which fraternity
pledging is being handled. He's more or less right. This business of
having fifteen or twenty freshmen at a house at a meal, and then sitting
around and playing bridge or chatting in the way of a Ladies' Aid tea, is
pretty weak, as are the present rules to which he refers. It is the whole
system that needs re-decorating. Wilbur also makes the criticism that too
many students are "trying to imitate the more shallow and pretentious en
tertainments of the hotel, cabaret, and roadhouse."
In commenting upon some of the improvements of the students, the
President makes a few remarks quite to the point. In noting that boys and
girls in high schools have had much experience in competitive athletics,
debate, dramatics, journalism, and.other activities, he finds that "When
these students come to us at Stanford the novelty has worn off. The
attempts to repeat at Stanford the experience of the high school are be
coming less and less successful. The less worthy and more juvenile of the
so-called 'Stanford traditions' have been sloughed off one at a time." Again,
in stating that there is a general reaching out by students for sound prin
ciples, and a desire to get down to real values, he believes: "I he drama is
better, the journalism is markedly improved [WHOOPS!], athletics are
carried on in a wholesome and more effective manner. Fewer students are
attempting to prove over again that which has been proven millions of times
before —that, while alcohol may not make a man into a fool, it can show
him up as one."
But of all the statements, the one which pleases us most is this: "There
is much greater willingness to think straight, to recognize the things that
are crooked." If this is true (and who should know better than he 2), then
there is some hope, in spite of what the newspapers and the movies make
us out.

attempting to prove over again that which has been proven millions of times
before —that, while alcohol may not make a man into a fool, it can show
him up as one."
But of all the statements, the one which pleases us most is this: "There
is much greater willingness to think straight, to recognize the things that
are crooked." If this is true (and who should know better than he 2), then
there is some hope, in spite of what the newspapers and the movies make
us out.
President Wilbur writes an article published in The Stanford Literary
Magazine, which is being sold this morning. The article is entitled, "Stan
ford Is All Right." Pursuant to his title, he praises the fact that cheap
standards seem to be making less appeal, and that the student body is
reaching out for sound principles. He says, "Personally, I have full con
fidence in our present group of students." The whole essay has the appear
ance of showing a great deal of satisfaction on the President's part in
Stanford students. But, we ask you, how else could he feel when writing
for publication?
It has been said of Ray Lyman Wilbur that when he gets up to talk one
can be assured he is going to say the right thing. Now that can be taken in
two ways: one giving a connotation that he is merely a pretty clever poli
tician, and the other, that the things he says are apropos of the time and
place. We use the latter meaning. At a cursory glance the article may look
a bit like soft soap, since students are the ones who will read the magazine,
but here and there we find little interjections that are far from being soap
of the runny variety.
For example, "The present sham of pledging rules is as obvious as it
is unnecessary." This is a direct charge at the manner in which fraternity
pledging is being handled. He's more or less right. This business of
having fifteen or twenty freshmen at a house at a meal, and then sitting
around and playing bridge or chatting in the way of a Ladies' Aid tea, is
pretty weak, as are the present rules to which he refers. It is the whole
system that needs re-decorating. Wilbur also makes the criticism that too
many students are "trying to imitate the more shallow and pretentious en
tertainments of the hotel, cabaret, and roadhouse."
In commenting upon some of the improvements of the students, the
President makes a few remarks quite to the point. In noting that boys and
girls in high schools have had much experience in competitive athletics,
debate, dramatics, journalism, and.other activities, he finds that "When
these students come to us at Stanford the novelty has worn off. The
attempts to repeat at Stanford the experience of the high school are be
coming less and less successful. The less worthy and more juvenile of the
so-called 'Stanford traditions' have been sloughed off one at a time." Again,
in stating that there is a general reaching out by students for sound prin
ciples, and a desire to get down to real values, he believes: "I he drama is
better, the journalism is markedly improved [WHOOPS!], athletics are
carried on in a wholesome and more effective manner. Fewer students are
attempting to prove over again that which has been proven millions of times
before —that, while alcohol may not make a man into a fool, it can show
him up as one."
