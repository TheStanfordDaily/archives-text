# On Your Toes, Men

A day or so ago an opinion from "One of the Five Hundred" was
received at the office and could not, as a consequence of lacking the fair
one's name, be run in the Campus Opinion column. 'Twere a shame, for
we have got several hearty laughs. The young lady says, in remarking how
few good dancers there are on the floor at a campus frolic, that "Out of an
entire assemblage of two hundred or more couples, there will be perhaps
fifteen or twenty who can honestly be called good, about that many more
who are passable, and as for the rest —they are simply negligible, some
times painfully so."
Now, this attack is not on the entire three thousand students. Ah, no.
She says, "This is certainly due to no fault of the women on the campus.
It is very generally true that the women here are good dancers." U-umm,
well. "The trouble is," she continues, "that the men do not realize the
imperative necessity of being a good dancer if one is to appreciate a dance
. . . the men are either blind or conceited —perhaps they fancy that a girl
is sufficiently thrilled over their mere presence to compensate for being
pushed or lurched over the floor. Well, she isn't."
Perhaps the little girl is right. Mebbe we are a bunch of sloths, can't
realize this "imperative necessity," don't have any fun. But facts are
facts; there are. in round figures, twenty-five hundred men on the campus,
and five hundred women. If they don't like "the man whut brung" 'em,
they certainly have a field from which to pick and choose.
Anyway, the writer of the opinion does not bring in a criticism without
offering a remedy. She makes a suggestion: "1 lold an affair of two hours
or so in the afternoon once every week, or perhaps twice a week, at the
Women's Clubhouse, at which the men who need the practice, and can't
get it any other way —and there seem to be plenty of them —will be shown
the real technique by girls who know how. In order to insure the best
teachers for the men, the women will be required to pass a test before a
men's board to prove her competence." Applicants' line forms on the left.
Now we think this idea is a mighty good one, and we would like to have
the woman who wrote this come into the office sometime soon and tell us
who she is, and sec if some constructive program can't be worked out.
Why, maybe we could even have 'em give us lessons 011 bridge, holding a
teacup, tieing our tux ties, and so on, far, far into the night.
THERE WILL BE a meeting of the editorial staff today at 1 o'clock.
It is to be the final staff meeting of the year.

received at the office and could not, as a consequence of lacking the fair
one's name, be run in the Campus Opinion column. 'Twere a shame, for
we have got several hearty laughs. The young lady says, in remarking how
few good dancers there are on the floor at a campus frolic, that "Out of an
entire assemblage of two hundred or more couples, there will be perhaps
fifteen or twenty who can honestly be called good, about that many more
who are passable, and as for the rest —they are simply negligible, some
times painfully so."
Now, this attack is not on the entire three thousand students. Ah, no.
She says, "This is certainly due to no fault of the women on the campus.
It is very generally true that the women here are good dancers." U-umm,
well. "The trouble is," she continues, "that the men do not realize the
imperative necessity of being a good dancer if one is to appreciate a dance
. . . the men are either blind or conceited —perhaps they fancy that a girl
is sufficiently thrilled over their mere presence to compensate for being
pushed or lurched over the floor. Well, she isn't."
Perhaps the little girl is right. Mebbe we are a bunch of sloths, can't
realize this "imperative necessity," don't have any fun. But facts are
facts; there are. in round figures, twenty-five hundred men on the campus,
and five hundred women. If they don't like "the man whut brung" 'em,
they certainly have a field from which to pick and choose.
Anyway, the writer of the opinion does not bring in a criticism without
offering a remedy. She makes a suggestion: "1 lold an affair of two hours
or so in the afternoon once every week, or perhaps twice a week, at the
Women's Clubhouse, at which the men who need the practice, and can't
get it any other way —and there seem to be plenty of them —will be shown
the real technique by girls who know how. In order to insure the best
teachers for the men, the women will be required to pass a test before a
men's board to prove her competence." Applicants' line forms on the left.
Now we think this idea is a mighty good one, and we would like to have
the woman who wrote this come into the office sometime soon and tell us
who she is, and sec if some constructive program can't be worked out.
Why, maybe we could even have 'em give us lessons 011 bridge, holding a
teacup, tieing our tux ties, and so on, far, far into the night.
THERE WILL BE a meeting of the editorial staff today at 1 o'clock.
It is to be the final staff meeting of the year.
A day or so ago an opinion from "One of the Five Hundred" was
received at the office and could not, as a consequence of lacking the fair
