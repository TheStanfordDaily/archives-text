"The Man Who Knew Coolidge," Sin
clair Lewis; Harcourt, Brace &
Company.
If you were fortunate enough to en
counter the first of this brace of char
acter-monologues, when it appeared
in the American Mercury recently,
you have no need to read the entire
volume. This first chapter is decidedly
better than the rest of the series—the
only other section approaching it is
"You Know How Women Are," where
Lowell Schmaltz, the one hundred
per cent American, and close friend
of the Babbitts, confides his marital
problems to a cousin. There is a
stronger current of reality here, and
the personal idiocyncracies of
Schmaltz are less exaggerated.
To complain of Sinclair Lewis'
exaggeration always brings the an
swer that he gives us only the truth,
stark photographic truth about real
people. We do not think it matters a
great deal about the actual facsimile
truth —the exaggeration lies in the
great number of incidents. Just as an
enormous number of falsehoods may
approach the truth, a great number
of realities may be a lie. Now
Schmaltz is supposed to be a type,
and therefore to be universally ap
preciated. His provincialism should
be national —or a good proportion of
his readers will appreciate him only
as an amusing atrocity.
Characterization Drawn Out
There is far too much of him here,

and there are far too many "typical
touches" in this book. We feel it
should be a very significant person-1
ality to compensate for the dullness
of the interminable pages of charac
ter. A record told through monologue
form may be a tricky piece of tech
nique, and well-done, a masterpiece— i
but there are so few characters that
can stand more than ten pages!
Personally we are one of those be- j
niglited individuals who have a very |
definite prejudice against Sinclair
Lewis, considering him a faulty
craftsman, a poor narrator, and un-;
pardonably bigoted. In short, we find
him a soap-boxer, waving vindica- j
tively a large flag at every oppor- j
tunity—a flag with LEWIS printed
upon it. Booth Tarkington is as j
amused and interested in the class j
of society that attracts this estimable ,
Lewis, but Tarkington is a gentleman |
and more fastidious than an ordinary
photographer. The artistic value of
them both is a controversial subject,
but we do know that if we must have
a picture of our friends, we prefer a
Baron de Meyer to a passport snap
shot.
Lewis Hailed as Satirist
More learned and intelligent critics j
than ourselves herald Lewis as one
of the great satirists of America, who
will outlive his contemporaries, etc.
Out of deference to these authorities,
therefore, we call your attention to
this new statuette of the genus Amer
ican Rotarianus. —Hallie Keating.
