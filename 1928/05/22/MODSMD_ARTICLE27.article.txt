Oh Lady of the Saccharine Tongue
Your sweetness is too sweet for me.
When I met you, we were so young
Oh Lady of the Saccharine Tongue
And down my virgin heart I flung
For you to break so carelessly
Oh Lady of the Saccharine Tongue

Archie hasn't sobered up enough
from last week-end to be able to tell
us where he put Lotta Fervor's great
thriller, "Three Buckets of Blood, or
The Mystery of the Butchershop."
We've ironed him out with two Turk
ish baths, fed him five gallons of
tomato juice and three of black cof
fee—and still the gibbering boob
keeps sputtering, "Ah faw down!"
"Snakes! Whoopee!" "Just missed!"
and "Which of these two drinks is
the chaser?" We hope to find the
missing manuscript within the next
couple of days. It must be said for
the good name of the University that
Archie is not a Stanford man in order
to agree with that great temperance
authority, Officer Olsen.

TO A SWEET "MAMA"
By L.A.B.
Oh Lady of the Saccharine Tongue
Your sweetness is too sweet for me.
When I met you, we were so young
Oh Lady of the Saccharine Tongue
And down my virgin heart I flung
For you to break so carelessly
Oh Lady of the Saccharine Tongue
Your sweetness is too sweet for me.

HOLD YOUR SEATS!
Archie hasn't sobered up enough
from last week-end to be able to tell
us where he put Lotta Fervor's great
thriller, "Three Buckets of Blood, or
The Mystery of the Butchershop."
We've ironed him out with two Turk
ish baths, fed him five gallons of
tomato juice and three of black cof
fee—and still the gibbering boob
keeps sputtering, "Ah faw down!"
"Snakes! Whoopee!" "Just missed!"
and "Which of these two drinks is
the chaser?" We hope to find the
missing manuscript within the next
couple of days. It must be said for
the good name of the University that
Archie is not a Stanford man in order
to agree with that great temperance
authority, Officer Olsen.
