breach of etiquette to hurt the ser
pent in any manner.
When the unsuspecting frosh en
ters his room he may be confronted
with a huge and vicious looking rep
! tile. It may be planted upon his bed
or be lying coiled under the dresser
i or some other place. After being half
scared to death, the victim is ex
pected to retain an angelic disposi
tion merely because the offender is
jof an ordinary harmless species of
igopher snake.
The renowned snake-charmer then
; proceeds to put his protege through
its act. Beginning by grabbing the
