# FIRE DEPARTMENT ON CAMPUS WILL PUT IN ALARM BOX SYSTEM
## 
### 
The campus fire department is going to
have a modern alarm box system to re
place the present arrangement of tele-!
phone calls and power house whistle sig-1
nals, which has served well enough in the
past with its smaller community, but has.
its disadvantages in delay and confusion
sometimes.
By the time college opens for the fall
term next October, the householder upon
discovering flames in his home, instead of
calling central and babbling implorations
for speedy help will streak for the near
est red box and start an automatic chain
of mechanical operations that will tell the
fire department exactly where to go.
There will be nineteen fire alarm boxes
covering the whole campus, including the
Convalescent Home, all connecting with
a central fire alarm station, and the box
number will be sounded on a gong and
registered visibly on a dial. The central
station will be housed in a concrete build
ing just outside the fire house.
All the equipment is of latest design,
and the boxes are so arranged that aux
iliary lines can be run from them, extend
ing the system indefinitely, as required.
Each box can also be connected instantly
with the telephone system, making it pos
sible to telephone from there to any point.
The system is being installed by the Uni
versity electricians.
When the new scheme is in operation,
the power house blasts will cease. With
the present organization of the fire de
partment there is not the need that used
to exist for notifying the whole commun
ity in order to call in volunteer help.
