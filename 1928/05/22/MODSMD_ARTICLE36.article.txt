# BITTER ATTACKS MADE ON HOOVER, SMITH IN DEBATES IN CONGRESS
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 21—(U.P.)—
Daily debates in Congress point to a
presidential campaign if Secretary
Hoover and Governor Smith are nomi
nated filled with the most bitter per
sonalities the country has heard in
years.
Senator Ilefiin's almost daily Senate
attacks on Smith have become an in
stitution here. Hefiin was attacking
Smith in North Carolina today and
two other Democrats —Senators Reed
of Missouri and Blease of South Caro
lina, substituted here with sarcastic
speeches on Hoover.
Accuses Mellon
Blease, after accusing Secretary
Mellon with "trying to conceal thiev
ery by officials of the Federal Land
Bank at Columbia, jp.C.," applied his
talents to Hoover.
He charged Hoover with "pro-mot
ing race equality in the Commerce
Department," by ordering negro segre
gation discontinued in the Census
Bureau.
"This man in the Cabinet is white
in skin only," Blease said. "I hope the
Republican Party will not disgrace
itself by nominating him for the presi
dency, even if he would be the easier
man for the Democratic Party to de
feat."
Reed made his attack on Hoover
while advocating a farm relief deben
ture plan as an amendment to the
tax bill. He reviewed the history of
Hoover's food control activities, charg
ing that the farmer was prevented
from reaping the profits to which he
was entitled by the heavy European
demand.
Hoover Called "Alien"
"It was a brazen usurpation of
power," Reed continued. "I say this
not because he is a candidate for
president. I made the same charge
in 1917 when no one dreamed he
would have the brazen audacity to
offer himself for that post.
"Two Europeans came to this coun
try during the war seeking supplies
at low prices. One was Lord North
cliffe, who wanted cheap copper and,
like an English gentleman, said so.
The other was Herbert Hoover, who
used somewhat different methods."
The feeling displayed against
Hoover by these two senators is only
eo.ualled by that which Heflin has dis
played against Governor Smith, whom
he has assailed in the same kind of
language.
Campaign To Be Bitter
All of it is indicative of the type of
campaign to which both men will be
subjected if they are nominated and
what United States senators say is as
mild as the chirping of a bird com
pared with what will be said by
mouth to ear workers. They will be
restrained only by their limitations
in the use of the English language.
There is one hopeful spot. Both
Hoover and Smith are without blem
ish in their personal morality. Thus
far the gossips have failed to make
any attack in that direction. Other
wise the things that have been said,
the scurrility to which both have been
subjected, is enough to make one won
der why anybody should pay such a
price for a chance at the presidency.

years.
Senator Ilefiin's almost daily Senate
attacks on Smith have become an in
stitution here. Hefiin was attacking
Smith in North Carolina today and
two other Democrats —Senators Reed
of Missouri and Blease of South Caro
lina, substituted here with sarcastic
speeches on Hoover.
Accuses Mellon
Blease, after accusing Secretary
Mellon with "trying to conceal thiev
ery by officials of the Federal Land
Bank at Columbia, jp.C.," applied his
talents to Hoover.
He charged Hoover with "pro-mot
ing race equality in the Commerce
Department," by ordering negro segre
gation discontinued in the Census
Bureau.
"This man in the Cabinet is white
in skin only," Blease said. "I hope the
Republican Party will not disgrace
itself by nominating him for the presi
dency, even if he would be the easier
man for the Democratic Party to de
feat."
Reed made his attack on Hoover
while advocating a farm relief deben
ture plan as an amendment to the
tax bill. He reviewed the history of
Hoover's food control activities, charg
ing that the farmer was prevented
from reaping the profits to which he
was entitled by the heavy European
demand.
Hoover Called "Alien"
"It was a brazen usurpation of
power," Reed continued. "I say this
not because he is a candidate for
president. I made the same charge
in 1917 when no one dreamed he
would have the brazen audacity to
offer himself for that post.
"Two Europeans came to this coun
try during the war seeking supplies
at low prices. One was Lord North
cliffe, who wanted cheap copper and,
like an English gentleman, said so.
The other was Herbert Hoover, who
used somewhat different methods."
The feeling displayed against
Hoover by these two senators is only
eo.ualled by that which Heflin has dis
played against Governor Smith, whom
he has assailed in the same kind of
language.
Campaign To Be Bitter
All of it is indicative of the type of
campaign to which both men will be
subjected if they are nominated and
what United States senators say is as
mild as the chirping of a bird com
pared with what will be said by
mouth to ear workers. They will be
restrained only by their limitations
in the use of the English language.
There is one hopeful spot. Both
Hoover and Smith are without blem
ish in their personal morality. Thus
far the gossips have failed to make
any attack in that direction. Other
wise the things that have been said,
the scurrility to which both have been
subjected, is enough to make one won
der why anybody should pay such a
price for a chance at the presidency.
WASHINGTON, May 21—(U.P.)—
Daily debates in Congress point to a
presidential campaign if Secretary
Hoover and Governor Smith are nomi
nated filled with the most bitter per
sonalities the country has heard in
years.
