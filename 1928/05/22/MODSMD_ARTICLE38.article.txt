# BATTING RALLY GIVES PHI DELTS MURAL WIN OVER PHI KAPPA PSI
## 
### 
Ry a last-inning rally which netted
them three runs, the Phi Delta Theta
baseball team yesterday defeated the Phi
Kappa Psi nine by a score of 7 to 5
after trailing during the majority of the
game. This victory advances them to the
semi-final round of the intramural base
ball tournament, which will be played to
morrow.
Kenneth Sampson, Phi Kappa Psi. and
Albert Purkiss, Phi Delta Theta, led in
the hitting, each collecting four hits in
four times at bat. Clark of the Phi Delts
took scoring honors with three runs to
his credit.
Tied at three all, a run in the fourth
inning put the Phi Delts in the lead,
which they were unable to hold for long,
the Phi Psi's scoring two more tallies in
the following inning. A last-inning rally,
however, scored three runs for the Phi
Delts and gave them the victory.
