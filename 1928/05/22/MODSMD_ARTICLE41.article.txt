# SPORTS OF 1928
## Two of Stanford's Best 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Again the "Dangerous Curves
Ahead" sign is out for the caravan
of Eastern college track teams that
will wend their way to the annual
1.C.-4A. meet at Cambridge, Mass., on
or before May 25. In recent years the
danger that the sign warned of has
proved all too fatal. The blue and
gold "C" of the University of Cali
fornia was the curve that wrecked
the Eastern teams in 1921, 1922, and
1923, and in 1925 and 1926 the dan
gerous Western curves of "U.S.C."
shattered the hopes of the Atlantic
seaboard. Last year the "S" of Leland
Stanford was the omen of defeat for
the East, and once more the red sign
of danger is out, as Coach Dink Tem
pleton is bringing back an even
stronger aggregation than the one
that won on Franklin Field a year
ago.
Led by Captain Emerson "Bud"
Spencer, that remarkable athlete who
runs quarter-miles in 48 seconds or
better, the Palo Alto institution will
be represented by the most imposing
array of potential title-holders and
record-breakers that ever invaded the
East to take part in an 1.C.-4A. meet.
Captain Spencer, who lost the sight
of one eye in an auto accident in
1924, and was made over by Coach
Templeton into a 440-yard man from
a hurdler, will not be shut out in the
preliminary beats as he was last year.
Bob King looks good to recapture his
high jump crown, which he won in
1926, and as for the weight men, Tem
pleton has developed five shot-putters
who throw the 16-pound brass ball
more than 47 feet! Krenz, the giant
sophomore who is the National Discus
Throw champion, has a mark of over
49 feet, as has Rothert, while Forster
has put 48 feet 6 inches and Way and

Fleishhacker more than 47.
Then there's Edmonds in the pole
vault and Nichols in the hurdles and
Zombro and Dyer in the broad jump
—how are you gonna stop 'em?

Again the "Dangerous Curves
Ahead" sign is out for the caravan
of Eastern college track teams that
will wend their way to the annual
1.C.-4A. meet at Cambridge, Mass., on
or before May 25. In recent years the
danger that the sign warned of has
proved all too fatal. The blue and
gold "C" of the University of Cali
fornia was the curve that wrecked
the Eastern teams in 1921, 1922, and
1923, and in 1925 and 1926 the dan
gerous Western curves of "U.S.C."
shattered the hopes of the Atlantic
seaboard. Last year the "S" of Leland
Stanford was the omen of defeat for
the East, and once more the red sign
of danger is out, as Coach Dink Tem
pleton is bringing back an even
stronger aggregation than the one
that won on Franklin Field a year
ago.
Led by Captain Emerson "Bud"
Spencer, that remarkable athlete who
runs quarter-miles in 48 seconds or
better, the Palo Alto institution will
be represented by the most imposing
array of potential title-holders and
record-breakers that ever invaded the
East to take part in an 1.C.-4A. meet.
Captain Spencer, who lost the sight
of one eye in an auto accident in
1924, and was made over by Coach
Templeton into a 440-yard man from
a hurdler, will not be shut out in the
preliminary beats as he was last year.
Bob King looks good to recapture his
high jump crown, which he won in
1926, and as for the weight men, Tem
pleton has developed five shot-putters
who throw the 16-pound brass ball
more than 47 feet! Krenz, the giant
sophomore who is the National Discus
Throw champion, has a mark of over
49 feet, as has Rothert, while Forster
has put 48 feet 6 inches and Way and

Fleishhacker more than 47.
Then there's Edmonds in the pole
vault and Nichols in the hurdles and
Zombro and Dyer in the broad jump
—how are you gonna stop 'em?
