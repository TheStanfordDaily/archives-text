## 
### 
Committees from A.W.S. and W.A.A.
are to meet jointly with Comptroller
Roth tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
o'clock for the purpose of furthering
plans for the proposed women's gym
nasium. Tentative plans that were
drawn at a meeting of the commit
tees with the staff of the Physical
Education Department last Friday are
to be submitted to Comptroller Roth.
The next step is to submit them to
an architect who will begin work as
soon as possible.
