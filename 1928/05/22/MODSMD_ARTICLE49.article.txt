### 
MATHER, Pa., May 21.—( U.P.) —!
Fire added to the horror of the Mather!
mine disaster as the known death list
mounted to 61 late today and the rescue ;
workers labored to reach the approxi-!
mately 140 living or dead men still en- [
tombed in the depths.
The fire started about half a mile fromi
the foot of the shaft 300 feet below the
surface and temporarily halted rescue, j
The relief crews were forced by the gag- j
ging fumes to flee to the top.
With the use of fire extinguishers, the j
flames were brought under control with-1
out additional injuries reported.
The flames were believed to have
smouldered in a section of the pit since •
the explosion Saturday and to have been
revived when air was pumped into the
compartment by rescuers. Mining experts
fear other fires may flare up from time to;
time through the workings.
