the lists today or tomorrow. As things j
: stand now, horses for the steeple- I
chase, half-mile, and jumping events '
will have to be allotted by drawing
numbers.
Prepare for Show
It has been arranged to let students
have their mounts every week day
from 10 to 11:30 o'clock so that they j
may train them and become familiar ;
with the jumps and courses. A gang '
| of men is working on the Encina polo 1
! field grading it and getting the ground j
j
in shape.
There will be two new field events i
I 1
| this year: men's musical chairs, and j
| pair jumping. The musical chairs is
j one of the best events which can be
! put on at a horseshoe.
Play Musical Chairs
i The procedure is to have a circle of;
chairs numbering one less than the
number of mounted contestants. The ;
horsemen ride around the outside of
! the circle to the accompaniment of;
! band music. When the music stops
j abruptly, each dismounts and dashes
for a chair. One man is eliminated and I
a chair is removed until only two con
testants and one chair remain. The
Stanford band will play.
Pair jumping will consist of two 1
men going over a course of eight j
jumps together. They will be judged
on performance, teamwork, co-ordi
nation, tips, and knockdowns.
Blue, red, and yellow ribbons will
be given for first, second, and third
places. Also an attractive array of
prizes is being got up. There will
| be awards for first, and possibly sec
ond, places, in the shape of spurs,
j bridles, and other equestrian equip
! ment.
