SPORT SHOES--NOW
Men used to tliink that a sport shoe was effeminate
â€”a shoe to be worn by a "gentleman loafer." Before
that time we had an era of black suits saved for
Sundays and funerals.
Nowadays men dress for comfort. And sport shoes
are comfortable (good looking, too). You'll want a
pair this vacation. The new models are here. Why
not choose yours NOW?
