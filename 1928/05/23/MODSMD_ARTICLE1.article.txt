# SPENCER RUNS 660 IN NEARLY RECORD TIME
## Weight Men Show Poor Form At Chicago; Nichols Has Hay Fever Attack Launcelot Ross, Yale Star, Promises Spencer Stiff Competition 
### Bob Speers 
Bud Spencer, fleet Cardinal
skipper, raced through the 660-
yard run in 121 4-5 seconds on the
Harvard cinderpath to come with
in 3-5 seconds of tying the world's
record, in his final practice be
fore entering the 1.C.-4A. trials
Friday, according to a telephone
report from the San Francisco
Examiner. The world's record of
121 1-5 seconds is held by Jake
Driscoll, who was running under
the colors of the Boston Athletic
Association.
CHICAGO, 111., May 22.—(Spe
cial to the Stanford Daily)— Sta
nford's famous weight - heaving
crew, bound for Boston and the
1.C.-4A., seemed a bit off form as
the boys worked out on Stagg
Field here today. Ross Nichols,
star high hurdler, is suffering
from a slight attack of hay fever.
The remainder of Templeton's
squad seemed in first-rate shape.

There exists a certain young gen
tleman with a medieval name and a ;
Grecian physique, who is receiving a j
great deal of attention lately as the i
possible conqueror of Captain Binl |
Spencer, lank Cardinal skipper, star !
quarter miler, and world's 400-meter j
titleholrler.
Launcelot. Ross, a son of old Eli, is
the man in question. Last year Ross j
was just one yard behind the winner j
of the 440, Alderman of Michigan
State, who crossed the tape first in
48 3-10 seconds.
440 Spectacular
Launcelot, it seems, has been doing
big things for Yale this year, and is
counted on as a powerful contender
for first in what promises to be one
of the most spectacular races of the
meet. He lias improved in every race,
and all Eastern critics point to him
as Captain Spencer's most dangerous
I rival.
Spencer, handicapped by poor vi
sion, coasted in during the trial heats
last year, and let enough rivals slip
by him to bar him from the finals.
Overtraining, too, is said to have con
tributed to his lack of success.
Whatever the cause, it seems cer
tain that Spencer will not let history
repeat itself. He has guarded against
too much work, and after a series of
scintilating races in the 440-yard
event this season, he startled fandom
recently by beating the world's record
in the 400-ineter run during the Olym
pic Tryouts in the Stanford Stadium.
Ray Barbuti Promising
Another Easterner who promises to
give Spencer something to think about
is Ray Barbuti, Syracuse gridiron and
track star. Barbuti crossed the tape
just a pace behind Launcelot Ross at
the 1.C.-4A. last May, and like his
Yale rival is said to have shown im
provement in all competition this sea

son.
Dartmouth, too, has a fast quarter
miler in Gerard Swope. As a sopho
more, tbis fleet New Hampshireman
crowded out some seasoned runners
to cop fifth at Franklin Field. This
year Swope, now a junior with more
speed and more power, seems a pos
sibility as a surprise element in the

440.
Westerners and others are confi
dent that Bud Spencer will be vic
torious. Loud disagreement may be
heard in other quarters, but everyone
agrees that the 440, with names liko
Spencer, Ross, Barbuti, and Swope
on the roster, wlil be a history mak
ing battle.
