# SENIORS MAY SECURE ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM STANFORD BOOKSTORE
## 
### 
Graduation announcements, recent
ly ordered by seniors, will be ready
for distribution from the Stanford
Bookstore Monday, May 28, from 8
until 5 o'clock, states Greg Davis,
chairman of the announcements com
mittee. There will be no souvenir
programs available at that date, he
said, these arriving a week later.
There are a few announcements
available for those seniors who failed
to place orders earlier; but they can
not be held at the Bookstore by pre
arrangement now, says Davis, and
must be bought at the day of the sale.
Extra souvenir programs will also be
on sale when they arrive.
