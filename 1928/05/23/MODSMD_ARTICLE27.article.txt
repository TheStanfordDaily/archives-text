# Social Prohibition
## 
### 
Yesterday morning it was to be noted in the Daily that a committee
of women was appointed to look over and revise the AAV.S. constitution,
and that several other committees were appointed for various other pur
poses. We are wondering why the women can't or don't look over some
of the rather puerile social rules they have. To be more specific, we'll
point out one which raises a hearty editorial guffaw.
It seems that in some, or all, forms of social probation, a Stanford
woman is required, when the onus of "social pro" is cast upon her, to
speak socially to no man on the campus. And, as she talketh not, neither
doth she spin; nay, auto rides and all contacts with men must sedulously
be cut off; that is, in a social way.
Now, one of the members of Women's Council advises that by no
speaking, it is meant that a girl may say "Hello" or some other such in
nocuous little thing. But suppose a gallant young Stanford man sidles
pleasantly up to the young lady in question and starts walking along the
red and white blocks that pave our Quad. What must she do ? Shall she
say in a coy. petite manner, "Kind sir, 1 am 011 social probation. You must
not walk and talk with me," or shall she run away, or may she just con
tinue on and be nice?
In other words, just how far may the "young lady in question" (hence
forth referred to as the Y.W.1.Q.) go? Certainly, if a corrector or young
instructor were to encourage a little apple polishing, she shouldn't be de
prived of such opportunities, rare though they may not be.
And what would be done about the woman who, like "One of the Five
Hundred," wrote in about the poor quality of the Stanford men's dancing,
and doesn't care about having them around if they can't dance? She prob
ably wouldn't give a hoot whether she talked with one of the rugged
roughs or not. So where would be the punishment in such a case? Maybe
a better one would be to make her dance with some of the men every day
for a week.
Remember the good old grammar school days when teacher made you
stand in the corner all morning for being a naughty boy or girl, and the
fun you used to have making faces at her back, and tickling all the other
kids? Well, this rule is very, very similar in its idea and methods.
But the rule ought to please the men greatly, just think what big fine
fellows all Stanford men must be, that it is considered a terrible punish
ment not to be able to talk to them.
No, girls, if you would not have more Turkels casting remarks about
in the East, or other campus men saying "The Five Hundred" with tongues
in their cheeks, you would do well to put in some other means of pun
ishment.
