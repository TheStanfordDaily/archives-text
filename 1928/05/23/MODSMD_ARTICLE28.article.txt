# Prejudices

America, say critics like H. L. Mencken and, indeed, even less sour
ones than he, is a bundle of prejudices. The national mind is so biased on
many important subjects that it is almost childish. "Very well," replies the
college student when his attention is called to the fact, "but don't complain
to me; I am one of the elect and I know how false mass opinions are. You
won't find prejudice in my mind."
We should like to believe that, but we do not feel we can. Let us, for
example, consider the mental cast of the ordinary Stanford student. How
many biased thoughts clog his mind after one, two, three, or four years
in the University? Has his freshman idealism turned to senior cynicism?
Or has he been fairly rational in fixing his opinions of the problems the
world presents? Will he, when he goes into business or a profession, be a
bigot, or a clear, broad-minded thinker?
Of course, one would like to answer that every Stanford man is the
latter, but one cannot. Probably there are as many unreasonable and in
excusable prejudices represented on this campus as in some of the most
backward rural districts or even (though God forbid) as in Congress.
Our prejudices are different, to be sure, from those of such other places,
but still they exist.
How superior, for example, to U.S.C. we regard ourselves; how wil
fully blind we are to the good qualities of other living groups than our
own; we gravely mistrust the League of Nations, yet we have never read
its constitution; we are quite certain we shall for years to come beat Cali
fornia in football, because Stanford "fight" will always be better than
California "spirit"; we vote straight Hall tickets or straight Row tickets
in student elections simply because we imagine that the candidates of the
opposite side, if put into office, would favor their partisans too much.
And so it is that no one's rule of conduct here is to act reasonably in all
things. Probably only in solving class-room problems are we sensible; our
own immediate ones we solve without regard to reason. Suspicion of the
new thing, of the other fellow's motives, of the opposite side seemingly
cannot be shut out of our minds.
