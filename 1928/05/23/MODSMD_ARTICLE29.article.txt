Every so often, particularly when the love nest exposures are dragging
a hit, something really delightful gets into the daily press, like the story
about the big business man from Chicago visiting in New York who, upon
emerging from one of the speakeasies of that city in a very befuddled
condition, hailed a passing patrol wagon, mistaking it for a taxi. The
jovial police rolled him home to his hotel, doing the sporting thing.
Such things, while they perhaps do not represent the higher activities
of mankind, must go a long ways toward making metropolitan life more
livable.
