# HEADS UP, ROUGHS! WOMEN JOIN RANKS OF STUDENT FLIERS

"Jiggers! A woman!" The cry
went up from the throats of
watchers at the Palo Alto School
of Aviation the other day when
Margaret Willis took control of
one of Lieutenant Norman A.
Goddard's biplanes while up with
him on her first flight.
Miss Wills immediately went
to Oakland, passed her physical
' examination, and won the "Co-ed
Prize" of getting the primary
course in flying at half price by
being the first to enroll.
Goddard reports that three
other campus women, inspired
with the same idea, rushed in
I yesterday, got the doctor's ad
dress, and were off for Oakland
j to see if they were qualified to
I enroll in the course, regardless
of prize or propriety.
