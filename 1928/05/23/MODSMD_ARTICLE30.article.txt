OUR DEEP SLEEP
"New York," observes Mr. Heywood
Broun, "needs a liberal newspaper."
He isn't sure enough liberals exist in
the city to support such an undertak
ing, but thinks it is worth a try.
"Liberals need not be born," he specu
lates. "They can be trained by care
and kindness."
New York undoubtedly needs a lib
eral paper, but not half as badly as
Stanford needs some liberal thought.
This place takes all prizes for con
servatism. The vital problems of the
day and of the future, political, social,
moral, and intellectual, excite the in
terest of Stanford students as a
group less than the most ordinary of
the 'planes which drone back and
forth above the campus. Why?
Needed Inspiration Lacking
The reason for the profound depth
of our little rut of conservatism is
fairly apparent. The student body, for
one thing, is largely drawn from the
contented middle class—the group
which believes in keeping "cool with
Coolidge" even if the price of cool
ness is one oil scandal more or less.
In the second place, the University
shelters its flock from controversial
subjects to such an extent that the
needed inspiration for new thinking
is cut off at the source. The first con
dition cannot be changed, nor would
we desire to change it, but, if we
adopt Broun's thesis that liberals can
be trained by care and kindness, we
certainly can find fault with the
closed-door situation on the campus.
Transition Period
It would seem that today we are
in a transition period. Old institutions
are no longer sacred merely because
of their age. The rising generation
would carefully scan and question. To
quote R.J.W. in Judge:
"Will Durant in a recent lecture on
Progress said, 'The younger genera
tion has two virtues which make up
for all their petty vices, their auda
city in the face of prohibition and
their tremendous intellectual hunger,
j They are forcing us to make decisions
i on the basis of natural biological
j ethics instead of supernatural ethics.'
In short, they are doing not what peo

pie tell them they ought to do, but
what their own common sense dic
tates .... It is this very insistence
on individual conscience which makes
the Generation quite the most hopeful
force in a world long enslaved by tlio
taboos of mass morality."
Turns a Deaf Ear
What of the issues, marriage, di
vorce, religion, morals, politics? What
of democracy, and what of its chal
lenging opposites, Fascism and Bol
shevism? And what about the graft,
favoritism, and other numerous im
perfections in our political life? To
all these matters Stanford politely
turns a deaf ear, when, as a high
grade educational institution, it
should be bringing them to the at
tention of the students.
Granted that these are live issues
and worthy of intelligent considera
tion, why not, then, some discussion
of them? Why not a few live speakers
speaking something besides the con
ventional blah? True enough, we have
our Tuesday evening lectures, worthy
and entertaining affairs, perhaps, but
quite harmless. Then we had our
Maude Royden with much publicity
about her liberalism, and the Univer
sity thought she was devilish because
she smoked cigarettes. That, and
nothing more.
An Antique Rule
The reason for this impossible con
dition is, as most everybody knows,
an old trustee rule which denies the
use of any University building to a
speaker addressing any public gather
ing on a controversial subject. This
ridiculous rule, which defeats one of
the fundamental purposes of a college
education, has been a pall upon the
campus so long that all opposition
to it seems to be perpetually beaten
down, and anything which smacks of
liberal discussion around here is
about as hard to visualize as a flock
of dodo birds.
The rule is clear out of date, if it
ever was in date, and should be re
moved as quickly as possible if Stan
ford students are to be graduated into
the world with an intelligent opinion
on some of the problems of the world.
