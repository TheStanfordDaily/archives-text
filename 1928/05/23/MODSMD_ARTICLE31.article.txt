Guldbrand de Waldoza
We cxpected Dr. Waldoza's experi
ments to verge on the metaphysical and
mystical side of auto-suggestion, but at
his lecture Monday night at the Masonic
Hall in Palo Alto, there was absolutely
nothing of this element. Hypnosis has a
bad flavor around these environs, not only
because of the opinions of our own psy
chology department, but because the Palo
Alto city charter classes and bans hyp
nosis along with crystal gazing, etc.
These experiments however were very
interesting indeed, and as he will lecture
again Wednesday, it is worth calling
your attention to.
Unusual Performance
The first part of the program he occu
pies with some tricky muscle-reading ex
periments, consisting of the usual hiding
of bills, watches, and rings in the audi
ence, in a rather more elaborate manner,
and blinded, finding them, with only the
assistance of empathy of his companion.
He then gives the good old pendulum
test, and several such, to determine what
volunteer subjects from his audience are
most adaptable to suggestion.
The performance here progresses
sharply from the ordinary. In the first
place, the subjects were not hired before
hand, or instructed. They were, in the

majority, Stanford roughs, who had evi
dently predetermined to break up the
meeting, and stayed because they were
interested. Waldoza, through thought
suggestion, or something, visited on these
several gentlemen shades of amnesia, of
balancing, of suggestive cramps, etc.
Experiments Convincing
Then he began on their sense of taste.
One poor youth was convinced that the
cigarette he was smoking was unbearable,
and had to be brought out of his trance
quickly for fear of illness. Another poor
lad was basely deceived into thinking that
the water he \va«: drinking was cognac,
and fell into a jag that was far too real
istic to be anything but enviable. He also
obligingly chased rats, mice, chickens.
The most convincing experiment was
when one medical student allowed Wal
doza to pierce his cheek with a hatpin,
after "anaesthetizing" his sense of pain
by suggestion.
Waldoza's personality is an interesting
one, and his manner of handling the large
rather boisterous group of roughs, a trib
ute to unusual talent. Whether you are
skeptical or curious, the lecture Wednes
day evening is well worth making an ef
fort to attend. At least, it will be pleas
antly free from incense, crystal balls,
robes, and such.

Guldbrand de Waldoza
We cxpected Dr. Waldoza's experi
ments to verge on the metaphysical and
mystical side of auto-suggestion, but at
his lecture Monday night at the Masonic
Hall in Palo Alto, there was absolutely
nothing of this element. Hypnosis has a
bad flavor around these environs, not only
because of the opinions of our own psy
chology department, but because the Palo
Alto city charter classes and bans hyp
nosis along with crystal gazing, etc.
These experiments however were very
interesting indeed, and as he will lecture
again Wednesday, it is worth calling
your attention to.
Unusual Performance
The first part of the program he occu
pies with some tricky muscle-reading ex
periments, consisting of the usual hiding
of bills, watches, and rings in the audi
ence, in a rather more elaborate manner,
and blinded, finding them, with only the
assistance of empathy of his companion.
He then gives the good old pendulum
test, and several such, to determine what
volunteer subjects from his audience are
most adaptable to suggestion.
The performance here progresses
sharply from the ordinary. In the first
place, the subjects were not hired before
hand, or instructed. They were, in the

majority, Stanford roughs, who had evi
dently predetermined to break up the
meeting, and stayed because they were
interested. Waldoza, through thought
suggestion, or something, visited on these
several gentlemen shades of amnesia, of
balancing, of suggestive cramps, etc.
Experiments Convincing
Then he began on their sense of taste.
One poor youth was convinced that the
cigarette he was smoking was unbearable,
and had to be brought out of his trance
quickly for fear of illness. Another poor
lad was basely deceived into thinking that
the water he \va«: drinking was cognac,
and fell into a jag that was far too real
istic to be anything but enviable. He also
obligingly chased rats, mice, chickens.
The most convincing experiment was
when one medical student allowed Wal
doza to pierce his cheek with a hatpin,
after "anaesthetizing" his sense of pain
by suggestion.
Waldoza's personality is an interesting
one, and his manner of handling the large
rather boisterous group of roughs, a trib
ute to unusual talent. Whether you are
skeptical or curious, the lecture Wednes
day evening is well worth making an ef
fort to attend. At least, it will be pleas
antly free from incense, crystal balls,
robes, and such.
