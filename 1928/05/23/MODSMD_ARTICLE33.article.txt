The Editor, Sir:
There are many of us who are
going to the Senior Ball who would
like to send a formal engraved an
, nouncement of the dance to tiie girl
that we are taking. The engraved
bids are absolutely necessary for ad
mittance and we have to hang onto
them. By the time of the dance the
j bid has a hole punched into it for
programs, and once taken at the door,
the bid is gone forever. It isn't too
late now to print a cheap two-by-four
card that would be given to us for i
presentation and collection at the
door of Toyon for admittance. The
admittance ticket could be printed in
a day and Miss Stevens at the Union
: could give one to him who presents
j his engraved bid at the same time
checking him off as having received
| it. At. least may we hear from the
j Dance Committee chairman about
this? Yours very truly,
Jay G. Lissner, '28.
The Editor, Sir:
Conscious as I am of the sterling and
admirable qualities of the Stanford man,
I am constrained to add a mite of corrob
oration to yesterday's Campus Opinion
that dancing is not one of these sterling
and admirable ones.
Until yesterday, there was nothing very
I reprehensible in this deficiency; but now
! that they have been advised of the fact,
unless definite corrective measures are
taken, they can expect nothing but un
happiness and harping on the part of the |
feminine contingent.
Probably unbeknownst to the men, the
first question any woman puts to any
other woman in regard to the man she
was out with the night before is not "Is '
he good-looking?" nor "Does he pet?" nor
"What kind of a car does he drive?"—
I not any of thesw, but "Is he a good danc-,
jer?" This is the sine qua non of the eli
|gible man. This is what will successfully
compensate for lack of car, lack of funds
(where have we heard those words be
fore!), lack of looks, lack, in fact, of
almost anything.
The Personality School Ad writer
coined the right phrase when lie said that
all doors were open to the ojie who has
"it." Verily, the good dancer is assured
of that enviable article—entree (perhaps
of "It," too).
Far be it from me to propose myself as
a teacher for these deficient brethren, but
there is more than one of us jolly-up!
goers who would appreciate a bit, nay, a I
deal, of improvement in the dancing of j
the masculine portion of the campus. j

The Editor, Sir:
Conscious as I am of the sterling and
admirable qualities of the Stanford man,
I am constrained to add a mite of corrob
oration to yesterday's Campus Opinion
that dancing is not one of these sterling
and admirable ones.
Until yesterday, there was nothing very
I reprehensible in this deficiency; but now
! that they have been advised of the fact,
unless definite corrective measures are
taken, they can expect nothing but un
happiness and harping on the part of the |
feminine contingent.
Probably unbeknownst to the men, the
first question any woman puts to any
other woman in regard to the man she
was out with the night before is not "Is '
he good-looking?" nor "Does he pet?" nor
"What kind of a car does he drive?"—
I not any of thesw, but "Is he a good danc-,
jer?" This is the sine qua non of the eli
|gible man. This is what will successfully
compensate for lack of car, lack of funds
(where have we heard those words be
fore!), lack of looks, lack, in fact, of
almost anything.
The Personality School Ad writer
coined the right phrase when lie said that
all doors were open to the ojie who has
"it." Verily, the good dancer is assured
of that enviable article—entree (perhaps
of "It," too).
Far be it from me to propose myself as
a teacher for these deficient brethren, but
there is more than one of us jolly-up!
goers who would appreciate a bit, nay, a I
deal, of improvement in the dancing of j
the masculine portion of the campus. j

The Editor, Sir:
There are many of us who are
going to the Senior Ball who would
like to send a formal engraved an
, nouncement of the dance to tiie girl
that we are taking. The engraved
bids are absolutely necessary for ad
mittance and we have to hang onto
them. By the time of the dance the
j bid has a hole punched into it for
programs, and once taken at the door,
the bid is gone forever. It isn't too
late now to print a cheap two-by-four
card that would be given to us for i
presentation and collection at the
door of Toyon for admittance. The
admittance ticket could be printed in
a day and Miss Stevens at the Union
: could give one to him who presents
j his engraved bid at the same time
checking him off as having received
| it. At. least may we hear from the
j Dance Committee chairman about
this? Yours very truly,
