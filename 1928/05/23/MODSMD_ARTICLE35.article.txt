# Hypnotist Tells Reporter Methods, Medical Use Of Thought Transfer

### Milton Silverman 
We finally rcached peace, quiet, seclu
sion—and back stage. Compared to the
room out in front, where the excited,
curious crowd had been milling about the
slim blond lecturer, the stage was abso
lutely quiet. * And that was just what we
were seeking—some quiet, three chairs,
and a chance to pass the cigarettes and
pop the questions to De Waldoza, "Emi
nent European Psychologist."
"What's hypnotism?"
"Hypnotism, it is what you call a kind
of sleep. There is also the subconscious
mind or state, which resembles sleep, and
is almost the same. A person can use dif
ferent methods to obtain this condition,
but the result is always the same. Auto
suggestion—what Coue taught in France
—is like that. An object—what you call
it?—very bright?—causes a feeling of
tiredness.
"All the passes before the eyes, the
moving images are only methods. They
are not always necessary. But they bring
the same thing. Drowsiness, a loss of
certain feelings—that means the hypnosis
has begun."
Senses Numbed
And what happens when the hynosis is
completed ? Certain senses are numbed.
Others are made more keen. The senses
of feeling and touch are improved. "Hyp
notism is of considerable practical val
ue," he continued. "Minor operations and
imaginary hurts—there is where the hyp
notism can be used."
Concentration Needed
"All people, you can hypnotize. For
some, of course, it is hard the first time.
Force is necessary in some cases; in oth
ers it is impossible. Great knowledge is
needed, and also great practice and ex
perimentation."
The young man, who modestly admit
ted that he had hypnotized between fifty
and sixty thousand people, claims that all
success depends on the manner of ap
proach. The supernatural element—with
frequent repetition of "strange" and

"mysterious" in the prescribed ritual—is
just so much wasted breath. Concentra
tion, a powerful will, confidence, and
considerable intelligence in the person are
the requirements.
Ue Waldoza, who studied first in Den
mark, spent several years at the Univer
sity of Upsala in Sweden while working
on experimental psychology. He has been
in America for less than eight months—
as he explains when he asks us to repeat
our questions a bit slower.

The lack of interest in hypnotism in
America is clue to the number of so-called
hypotists who travel the country on
vaudeville circuits, guaranteeing to put
their subjects to sleep in one-tenth the re
quired time, and make them act extremely
phenomenally.

The best of the lot, he assured us, are
college students. "They are good subjects
because they are more interested. They
know something of hypnotism. They are
more intelligent." At which point, feeling
greatly pleased, we bade him good-night,
and headed for home.
