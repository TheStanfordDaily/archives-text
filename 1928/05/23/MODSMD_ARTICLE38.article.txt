THE FATHER OF MODERN DIVING
Although a great many Stanford
men around Encina pool are fasci
nated by watching the divers work
ing out, few realize that the man who
coaches them into world-famous
champions is something a great deal
more than a passer-on of rules and
theories of the springboard art.
Ernst Brandsten, Stanford diving
mentor, American Olympic diving
team coach, and former champion in
this field of sport, is the father of
modern diving. Brandsten is the one
man who has codified the rules, im
proved diving equipment, perfected
training and coaching methods, and
placed the United States and Stan
ford on the map in acquatic circles.
"Ernie," as he is universally known,
evolved and invented the modern div
ing board with its moveable fulcrum,
tapered end, and permanent mount
ing. This board, as designed by A1
White, has been patented and ac
cepted as standard by all the notable
diving organizations of the world, in
cluding the 1928 Olympic Games com
mittee at Amsterdam. The advantages
of this apparatus are that wherever
a diver may go, he will have exactly
the same equipment to perform on.
The sandpit method of training is
another revolutionary idea, original
to Brandsten, which has proven en
tirely successful.

But probably his greatest achieve
ment was consummated last year
when he had the Olympic Games div
ing rules made the same as those
used by the United States. The per
fection of an international standard
by which the competitors could meet
on equal terms, having trained under
similar regulations, is worth more
than its apparent value.

At present there are men from all
over the United States who have
come to Stanford to benefit by Ernie's
coaching for the coming Olympic
Games and to take advantage of the
training facilities offered at Sears
ville Lake. Brandsten draws these
men from all over the country be
cause of his wonderful record in turn
ing out winning material and of dis
covery of the principles of the art of
diving. The necessity of balance and
height of spring were unrealized fac
tors in the days when a plank mount
ed on buggy springs was the last
word in springboards. And, of course,
it is not easy to overlook the fact
that A1 White, Pete Desjardins, Dave
Fall, and Clarence Pinkston —all hold
ers of the run of Olympic diving titles
—were and still are Brandsten's
pupils and Stanford men.

The difficulty in training for the
Olympic Games, caused by the scar
city of 10-foot springboards in the
United States, is realized by few peo
ple. Stanford is one of the few col
leges to have a good high-board. For
this reason the 3-foot height still re
mains standard for intercollegiate
competition in this country. Univer
sities would offer more Olympic ma
terial if ten-foot boards were more
prevalent. The higher boards require
plenty of ceiling room, and as most
pools are indoor, they generally have
to use the lower standard.
At the Searsville Lake training
camp for divers there is a well-con
structed high-dive platform of regula
tion dimensions with fifty feet of
water beneath it. This, with the warm
temperature and ideal weather con
ditions, makes it the best place in
the United States for high-dive train
ing. —Bill Grace.
