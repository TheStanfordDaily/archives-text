# PERSIA CALLED GREAT FOUNTAIN SOURCE OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
## Nation Is Most Adequately Revealed in Art, Says Arthur Pope 
### 
"Persia is one of the great fountain'
sources which has enriched civilization," j
said Arthur Upham Pope, who is advisory i
curator of Mohammedan art at the Art \
Institute of Chicago, in his discussion of ;
Persian Art last night in the Little The
atre. "Persia is most adequately revealed i
in its art."
Pope in the first of his lecture traced
the history of Persian art and stressed its
importance in affecting the art of India
and China. He also stated that Scandi
navian and Russian art have been ac
quired from Persia.
The peak in the art of pottery was
reached by the Persians in the fourteenth j
and fifteenth centuries, according to Pope. |
"They were masters in the art of deco
rating metals, by inlaying and chiseling, j
They were first in textile and carpet
weaving."
The main part of his lecture was il- j
lustrated by pictures and slides showing ;
various articles of Persian art. Pope
claims that the Persians have a great love j
of decoration, and in the midst of sparse- i
ly adorned sections are placed decorations
of the richest kind.
The 'slides showed beautifully decora-!
ted bowls, and the works of architecture:
towers, mosques, and ruined palaces. "All
of these show great technical skill,
strength, and energy. Their work is sim- j
pie, but at the same time impressive," he
stated.
He explained the beautiful decoration
of the bowls by the fact that the Persians
consider water exceedingly precious and
valuable. Pope concluded by saying that:
it is the task of the artist to convey tra-;
ditions as perfectly as possible.
