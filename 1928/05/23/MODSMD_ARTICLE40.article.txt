# SPORTS OF 1928
## Tennis Alphabet 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"How doth the little Busy 'B'" do
in the world of base-lines, net bands,
and tennis balls? Pretty well, thank
you:—witness the three Frenchmen,
Borotra, Brugnon, and Boussus, re
cently returned from a trip to Aus
tralasia, where they lost about two
matches out of fifty-two. Witness also
two of Helen Wills' strongest rivals
Eileen Bennett, of England, and Kea
Boumaa, of Holland, both considered
two of Helen Will's strongest rivals
in the European play this summer.
And also give heed to the fact that
John and Horace Barton, of Sioux
Falls, S.D., are the national Father
and Son doubles champions, while
Fred C. Baggs and partner won the
national veterans doubles title last
year.
One of the greatest names in all
tennis begins with the second letter
of the alphabet—Bundv. Tom Bundy
was three times doubles champion
of the United States, with Marie Mc-
Loughlin as partner, and May Sutton
Bundy, before her marriage, was
singles champion of England and
America. Another famous sports
woman, Mary Browne, was singles

champion of the U.S.A. in 1912, and '
1913, and 1914, and four times doubles
and mixed doubles champion.
Another titan of tennis must be :
included in this list of B-players, and |
in many ways he was the greatest of
all. Norman Brookes, the "Old
Master," helped carry the Davis Cup
back to America from England in I
1907, and played in the historic cup
series until 1920. In 1924 he put out
Francis T. Hunter at Wimbledon in
a last gallant stand for the title
which he had won in 1907 and 1914. !
Jean Borotra, the bounding Basque
of France, won the Wimbledon tour
nament in 1924 and 1926.
