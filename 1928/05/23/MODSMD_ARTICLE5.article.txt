WASHINGTON, D.C., May 22. —
(U.P.) —In the event that he wins the!
! Republican presidential nomination, Sec-!
! rotary of Commerce Hoover will resign I
j his office in the cabinet and go to Palo |
! Alto, California, where he has a home on j
| the campus of Stanford University.
There he would prepare his speech of ac-1
iceptance which constitutes the candidate's;
platform. The notification ceremonies!
| would be held there. Then he would re- j
; turn and take up residence in his tem
' porary campaign home, which will be at
some point convenient to Chicago. From j
, there he will conduct a front porch cam- I
paign.
Several mid-west locations for a cam
paign residence have been suggested. Lake
Geneva, Wisconsin, a short distance out
of Chicago, is being urged as a favor
able spot. In any event Hoover probably
will go to some point in Wisconsin, Mich
igan, or the North Shore outside of Chi
cago and receive front porch delegations
which he would address with radio hook
ups cut in. Some outside speeches will l>e
inevitable, but Hoover's dislike of public
speaking will cause this activity to be
I held at a minimum.
