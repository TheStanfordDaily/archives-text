Both pitchers had plenty on the i
ball, Godet fanning eleven men and
! allowing only one walk, and Reynolds j
of Phi Delta Theta fanning seven and
! allowing five walks. The Alpha Tau
Omega fielders seemed to have a
great deal of trouble getting under
I the hits of the Phi Delt sluggers,
i most of which landed in the farthest
! corners of the diamond.

In the second game of the day, the
Delta Chi team had little trouble dis
- posing of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
nine, which seemed unable to get
men around the bases, three of the
j six who did reach first being put out
| before getting beyond second and one
dying on third.
The majority of the Delta Chi runs
were due to walks or errors on the
part of their opponents, six being
called against them during the seven
innings. Five Delta Clii men reached
first on walks.
