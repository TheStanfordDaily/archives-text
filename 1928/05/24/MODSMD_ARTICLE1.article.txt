# KING, MAYNARD AGAIN RIVALS IN I.C.-4A. MEET
## Card, Dartmouth Jumpers Each To Try Title Leap In Trials Friday Edmonds, Barnes, Carr Will Contest First Honors In Pole Vault 
### Bob Speers 
One of the most interesting duels
of the 1.C.-4A. meet in the Harvard
stadium this coming week-end prom
ises to be that between Stanford's
Tiigh-jumping ace, Bob King, and one
Tom Maynard from Dartmouth.
"Cocky" Bob assured himself a
name in the Athletic Hall of Fame
two years ago when, as a sophomore,
he neatly outleaped all opponents for
the National Intercollegiate Title.
Last season, however, another young
man entered the 1.C.-4A. who was no
mean jumper himself. In fact, when
the well-known smoke of battle
cleared away, Mr. King was minus
the crown, the headgear being upon
the aforementioned Tom Maynard's
head.
King Tied Coggeshall
The event was won, last year, with
a jump of G feet 4V 2 inches. King tied
with Coggeshall, of Southern Califor
nia, for second at 6 feet 3 3-8 inches.
Now that 1928 is here, it looks as if
Stanford's blond star and Maynard
are due to stage a real battle. King's
"best mark this season is painfully
close to 6 feet 6 inches â€”6 feet 5 15-16
inches, and it will take some unex
pectedly excellent work on the part
of Maynard to crowd Bob out of the
national title a second time.
A no less important contest looms
when altitude men of Stanford, Yale,
and Southern California vie for first
honors in the pole vault. Edmonds,
the Card, Barnes, the Trojan, and j
Carr, of old Eli. are all competing for
the title, and all have a real chance
of copping it.
Edmonds Won Crowd
Ward Edmonds, a sophomore last
year, and practically unheard of, won
over the Eastern crowd at the 1.C.-4A.
with his plucky fight against the more
experienced Barnes and Carr. The lat
ter, soaring over the bar at 14 feet
for a new intercollegiate and world's
record, triumphed. But these two
"Westerners, Edmonds and Barnes,
liave both come so close this season
to Carr's mighty leap that either of
them may humble the Yale star in
Saturday's competition.
