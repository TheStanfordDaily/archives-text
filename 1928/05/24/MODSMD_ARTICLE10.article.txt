## Sequoia, El Toro, Delta Chi Leading in Intramural Track Standing 
### 
Preliminary heats for the all-Uni
versity eight-man mile relay were run
off yesterday with five teams qualify
ing for the final heat to be run to
morrow afternoon at 4:15 o'clock. All
of the times were slow, with the
Breakers team running the fastest
mile in 3 minutes 16 2-5 seconds,
5 7-10 seconds slower than the record
set by a Breakers team two years ago.
The first heat was won by El Toro
in 3 minutes 18 seconds; the second
by Sigma Chi in 3 minutes 28 3-5 sec
onds; the third by Breakers; the
fourth by'Theta Xi in 3 minutes
19 4-5 seconds; and the fifth by Delta
Chi in 3 minutes 20 4-5 seconds. Few
of these teams were pressed to win,
and this fact explains the slow times.
The BSO-yard run and the discus,

Practice Oval, beginning at 2 o'clock.
The records in these two events, 1

be bettered this afternoon.
