### 
Freshmen won the Interclass Cham
pionship for this year yesterday in
the deciding contest, which was a soc
cer game between them and the
juniors. The freshmen made two goals
and prevented the juniors from mak
ing any. Besides receiving the Inter
class Trophy, the members of the
team will be presented with their
class numerals.
Both of the goals were made in the
first half. Bill Nichols kicked the first
goal which went in on a queer roll
with the aid of a rush made by
George Eberhart. In the last two min
utes of the first half, Wilfred Mujika
made a beautiful kick from the corner
which sailed right to the goal and
settled down in front of it, where
Eberhart again proved his worth by
knocking the ball into the goal with
his chest.
Throughout the game the freshmen
showed excellent teamwork, with ac
curate passes and corner kicks. In
the first half, the juniors explained
their inability to score, by the ab
sence of Captain A1 Gibbs, who was
performing in the Intramural Track
Meet. However, there seemed to be
no remarkable change in their efforts
when Gibbs came in at the beginning
of the second half.
Bill Nichols, Takazo Domoto, and
Wilfred Mujika proved to be valuable
players, and they all made some beau
tiful kicks and passes. George Eber
hart also deserves credit for being
on hand at the proper moments.
A1 Gibbs, Jakunin, and Roy Morris
showed good individual playing but
complete co-operation seemed to be
lacking, so that no scores were made.
