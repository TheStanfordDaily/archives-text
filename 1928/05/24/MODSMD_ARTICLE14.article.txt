# McNARY-HAUGEN BILL VETOED BY COOLIDGE AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL

### 
WASHINGTON, May ).—(U.P.) —
In a veto message that may yet rock
the Republican Party to its founda
tions, President Coolidge today sent
the McNary-Haugen farm relief bill
back to Congress, denouncing it as
an unconstitutional, cruelly deceptive
piece of folly, to use his mildest
words.
His 5,000-word veto message is a
compact document of denunciation
the like of which has not come out of
the White House since Woodrow Wil
son laid down his caustic pen. It al
most defies fragmentary quotation, so
packed Is it from beginning to end
with condemnation.
The President expressed the hope
that his previous recommendations
for co-operative farm marketing legis
lation might be enacted so the farmer
could get some practical relief. This
seems out of the question with Con
gress ready to adjourn in a few days.
