semi-final game they were only able
to account for six hits. Most of their
runs were due to errors.
The Phi Delts will enter the field
with the strongest battery that has
been exhibited by an intramural team
in the tournament. Mike Reynolds,
varsity relief pitcher, has shown ex
cellent form, allowing few hits. Chuck
Smalling is a first-rate relief, allow
ing few hits and walks in the con
tests he has pitched. He shut out the
Phi Kappa Sigs with three hits in
the tie play-off. Both men are strong
hitters, averaging over .500 in the
tournament hitting.
Salisman Is Hurler
Salisman is the main hurler for the
Delta Chi nine. He has pitched steady
ball in all his games, allowing the
opponents few hits. He is backed up
with a strong team that has made
few errors. Delta Chi has not lost a
game during the entire tournament
competition.
Both teams went through strenuous
practice yesterday to wipe out the
rough spots. They both showed the
best of form, making promise for a
battle that may go into extra innings.
Smalling and Reynolds are working
out for the Phi Delts but it is prob
able that Reynolds will start the con
test with Smalling in the field.
The probable lineups announced by
the teams are as follows:
Phi Delta Theta Delta Chi
Long ss Jeffers
Clark 2b Hay
Purkiss c Biaggini
Reynolds p Salisman
Smalling If Goodcell
Frazee lb McAdoo
Fletcher rf Campbell
Combs cf Robinson
Strong 3b Hall

nary games, Phi Delta Theta and
Delta Chi will close the intramural
baseball season this afternoon with a
contest to decide the all-University
championship. The game is scheduled
to start at 4 o'clock on the varsity
diamond.
Phi Delta Theta entered the finals
after defeating Alpha Tau Omega
Tuesday. They entered the champion
ship play-off by defeating both Phi
Sigma Kappa and Sigma Kappa in a
triple tie for the championship of
League VI. Delta Chi defeated Sigma
Alpha Epsiion to become eligible.
r l he Phi Delts have the more impos
ing record, winning all their games
by good margins and connecting for
many circuit hits.
Delta Chi Has Record
Delta Chi has also a strong record
but lacks the hitters and support that
their opponents have shown. In their
semi-final game they were only able
to account for six hits. Most of their
runs were due to errors.
