# Moot Court

### 
I his Moot Court that has been in session on and off over at the Law
School since the beginning of the fall quarter has caused quite a little
interest among both students and faculty. The main idea of the plan is,
of course, to give the students some practical experience in presenting cases
before a judge. And, in order to stimulate more fervor in the work, a
prize was offered to the pair of potential lawyers who could beat out the
others on a competitive basis. The competition was run much on the same
basis as tennis elimination tournaments, in which the winners of each case
went on and tried another case against the winners from another quartet.
Such work is obviously of infinite value to men studying law. True, it
is often a lawyer may never appear in court at all, but one seldom knows
this beforehand, and the majority of attorneys do have a certain amount of
practice in court#. Men who are studying medicine, after they have ad
vanced sufficiently far, get practical experience; so, also, do geologists,
engineers, etc. It is admitted that too little stress is laid on the practical
side of such things as business administration and law. Both schools are
now trying to overcome this difficulty, and to this extent the Moot Courts
are very beneficial.
But, by its very plan, the court system this year obviates the men who
seem most to need the practice from continued activity. Each pair of men
who lose out in their first case are automatically dropped from the compe
tition. Last fall the promoters of the work tried to keep the losers in 011
a consolation tournament, but this did not prove very satisfactory; they
didn't want consolation.
What is needed, it would appear, is some form of Law School credit.
If the men knew they would receive units for the time spent then they'd
feel justified in continuing, even if they lost all of their cases. Say what
you will about a man working for the good of his soul or the development
of his capabilities, it does have considerable effect on his vim and vigor if
he has something a little more tangible and immediate to work for.
