# A 						Tennis Tour
## 
### 
Proposal will be made to the Board of Athletic Control tonight to send
Captain Alan Herrington and Ralph McElvenny of the tennis varsity on
an eastern tour this summer. No two Stanford tennis players, of recent
years at least, have more deserved to be sent. Herrington and McElvenny
have gone through the present season as a doubles team without losing a
set, and in the singles, each has lost but one match.
There are few universities that can boast of ever having made such a
record of sweeping victories 011 the courts as Coach Hal Davis' team has
made this spring. U.C.L.A., U.S.C., Occidental, Pomona, Oregon, and
California have been defeated in dual meetings, and victories also have
been scored in the California Intercollegiate and Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate tournaments.
One of the greatest indications of the improvement of Stanford teruiis
is to be found in the fact that two years ago, when Herrington and McEl
venny were sophomores, Stanford won from California by a match-score
of 3-2, to annex her first tennis victory in fifteen years. Last year, the
Cardinal team won 4-1, and this year, five matches to none.
The two stars are now in the peak of form for a summer's campaign
ing. There are ten major eastern tournaments which they hope to enter.
Last year they both landed among the first ten in the intercollegiate ranking.
A record Stanford can be proud ofâ€”and one which ought to entitle Her
rington and McElvenny to a trip this summer.
