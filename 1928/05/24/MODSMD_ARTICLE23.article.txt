# Student Drinkers

### 
Pursuant to Traffic Officer Olsen's statement in regard to student
drinkers and traffic violators last week, the Palo Alto Times Tuesday
afternoon ran the following editorial, which is very much in accord with
the views recently expressed by Dr. Wilbur and heartily endorsed by The
Stanford Daily.
In Saturday's Times, John Olsen, traffic officer on the Stanford campus,
says he hasn't found any student driver under the influence of liquor. He
would if there were any such, for it is his business to catch violators of the
automobile regulations on the campus, and liquor is the most productive
source of such violations. Officer Olscn catches a considerable number of
drivers breaking various regulations, too, so that it is not that he doesn't
see anything wrong that may be going on.
Every oncc in a while a college student docs get arrested for speeding or
some similar violation of the automobile law off the campus, and some of
these violators are accused of having been drinking. Some college students
drink, some are arrested for reckless or too speedy driving. But the rather
prevalent idea that collcgc boys have a fixed habit of drinking alcohol as a
customary part of their automobile trips off the campus or 011 the campus
is one of the myths which become fixed as fact and which stick in spite of
all the disproofs that can be brought against them.
If college youths drank one-tenth the amount that these fairy tales
assume, there would long ago have arisen the necessity of special and drastic
regulations in the matter. It is merely a matter of ordinary sense to perceive
that necessarily what Officer Olsen says must be the actual situation, and yet
many good people will receive his words with surprise, and a considerable
proportion of them with incredulity, preferring to cling to the fiction which
comports better with their notion of what a "college boy" is than do the facts.

Them are two kinds of discontent, in this world: the discontent thai
•works, and the discontent that. wrings its hands. The first gets what 11 wants,
nnd the second loses what It. hns. There's no cure for the first, but sncceßfr;
bnd there's no cure at all for the second. —GORDON GItAIIAM.
