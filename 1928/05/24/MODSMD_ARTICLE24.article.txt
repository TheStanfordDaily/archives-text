"Spring Tide," Octavus Roy Cohen.
D. Appleton & Co.
It seems that a young man, named
Dudley Waring, is tricked into a real
estate venture, which his distaste for
commercial affairs would otherwise
have prevented him from entering,
and at the same time falls in love
with the tricker. Moreover, it seems
that this real estate is in Florida,
centering around his magnificent
Florida "shooting box." The time is
the 1925 boom, and the complicating
action, a group of cracker squatters.
This all makes an amusing enough
tale, but light, pitifully light. It is
the kind of present people give for
bon voyage—reading it will not fa
tigue in the least. It is the kind of
book to which the adjective "delight
ful" is applied. It is the kind of book
to lend to your friends at summer re
sorts —once read, it is finished, and
no one cares particularly if it is
never returned.
One decidedly disappointing thing,
however, is that Octavus Roy Cohen's
name on the front of the book means
little that can be expected of it. His
negro short stories have become al
most household words in every little
home in which that pillar of Ameri
can literature, The Saturday Evening
Post, is worshipped and fought over.
There is not one single word of dia
lect in the whole volume. Evidently
Cohen's Ethiopian imagination is re
served exclusively for the Curtis Pub
lishing Co.
Nevertheless "Spring Tide" is
amusing. The several adventures, the
few lyrical interludes, and the .South
ern atmosphere, make it adequate en
tertainment for a warm afternoon.
There are some people who can be
thrilled over the love troubles of even
such a thoroughly respectable and
well-labeled-hero young man as this
Dudley Waring.—Hallie Keating.
"The Great American Band Wagon,"
Charles; John Day Co.
In his "study of exaggerations"
Charles Merz has produced a subtly

hilarious picture of Babbittry with a
completeness that includes all the
ridiculous but humorous phases of
contemporary American life. His
criticisms are nothing new; they are
attacks on the same subjects that
most popular satirists have chosen
for the past few years and are writ
ten with the same scrutinizing eye,
but they leave a better taste in the
reader's mouth because of their ab
sence of malice.
"The Great American Band Wagon"
is a collection of essays (some of
which have been previously published
in "Harper's" and "Outlook") exag
gerating popular conceptions, institu
tions and realities. Murder trials,
newspaper headlines, secret societies,
golf, motoring, beauty contests,
radios, college education, and numer
ous other lucrative subjects all are
subjected to the critical eye and witty
pen of Mr. Merz. He supports most
of his humorous conclusions with sta
tistics.
Speaking of colleges, Mr. Merz (a
Yale graduate) says, "A catalogue of
modern courses reads like the front
page of a newspaper plus the table
of contents in a house and garden
magazine .... Banking, Bee-keeping,
Practical Poultry Raising, Elementary
Millinery, and the Care of Lawns,"
are all included, he says.
In his chapter, "Sweet Land of Se
crecy," he expresses the opinion that
secret societies will continue to exist
"as long as life is drab enough for
grown men to play Indian." Treating
"Headline Heroes," Mr. Merz relates
that "This is the day of the non-stop
flight, the million-dollar gate, the mov
ing picture queen, the new Ford, the
White House Spokesman, and the
English Channel." Such an excerpt
gives an idea of the up-to-dateness of
the book.
The very least we can say of this
book is that it is extremely humorous,
entertaining, and refreshing—and a
relief from the usual run of best
sellers. —C. O'M.
