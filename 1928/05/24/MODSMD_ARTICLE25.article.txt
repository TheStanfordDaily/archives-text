Here's a little pome that Gus, our jani- :
tor, found in a Toyon wastepaper basket, i
"Mebbe you don't tink I got pity for dot i
guy 1" chuckled Gus as he made a half
hearted swipe at our floor with a dust
mop. "I once lost a girl to the Navy
myself!"
Gawd help the poor sailors
On a night like this!
The port was full of females,
And wine brings joyful bliss.
The street lamps lit the foggy scene
And sputtered in the wind.
The fleet came in the day before—
The sailors all had sinned.
Gawd help that sailor boy!
His name they said was "Earl."
I'd kill the dirty beggar,
'Cause he ran off with my girl!

rive."
