Dear Sir:
Can you help a fellow in distress?
I need a date for the Senior Ball. I
have a Packard car, plenty of simole- j
ons, pleasing personality, a Block
"S" —but unfortunately I don't dance
well enough to rate a date with Stan
ford women. My only dancing experi
ence was a short engagement last
summer as dancing partner for a
famous movie star who was doing a
turn on vaudeville. I also have a
couple of cups that I picked up in a
Hollywood hotel, but you know those
Biltmore hicks can't slide a sandal too
well.
Try to find me a girl that won't be
too particular—the worst dancer of
the Five Hundred if you can find her.
It will be a hard job to find the worst
one, I mean, since they are all per
fect in their own estimation. Let me
know within the next few days if pos
sible as I will have to ask some
Mills gal that don't know nothing of
the terpsichorean art either.
Yours truly,
Carl Campus.
