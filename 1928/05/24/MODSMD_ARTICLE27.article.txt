"Sleep no more!" continued the
hollow voice. "The Pig Is pickled, and i
the Pickled Pip's feet are wobbly. |
Who knows whither he may wander?"
"Oh, Hot in my bedroom!" shrieked
Geranium. "What would my dear
mother say?"
"You nniHt stick to her, my boy,
in sorrow or in joy, though she wears
silk dresses and you wear corduroy,"
chanted the voice coining in through
the window and Boon followed by its
owner through the door.
"Who are you?" hissed tfezakiah |

with a hiss.
"Yes, who fire you?" gasped Gera
nium with a gasp.
"I'm a merry little suubeam!" gur
gled the strange-looking man, face
tiously. Then he added solemnly,
"Hark! I seek the Pickled Fig. Ask
no more."
"But what IS the Pickled Pig?" de
manded Hezakiah Hinklebluffer with
great determination.
"Ask me no questions and I'll tell
you no lies," chuckled the mysterious
stranger.
"You nasty man," sobbed little Ger
anium, her double chin throbbing
feverishly. "I'll tell my papa on you."
"Aha! And where is your father,
my fine young lady?" gleefully asked
the Man with the Hollow Voice.

Pig what we think it is? I don't know
either. Ditto. We hope so. Watch for
