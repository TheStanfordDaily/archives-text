# Camera Fiend, 'How Lovely' Maiden Observe Varied Views Of University

Stanford University as visitors see
It is a different place from the one
we know. Every afternoon the "per
sonally conducted" goes through the
Memorial Church with sightseers
anxious to learn about our campus.
They see there what the Stanford
student sees least of anything on the
Farm.
All types come in these parties.
There is the camera fiend who al
ways stops to take pictures of the
arches, of the palms, and of any
"typical Stanford student" who hap
pens to be walking in the inner quad.
There is the sentimental middle-aged
maiden who sighs, "O my, how love
ly."
There are the people who appreci
ate what they are seeing, and those
who know nothing whatever about it.
And always there are the parents of
hopeful future Stanford students com
ing to investigate the desirability of
sending "Junior" or little "Janie" here
to school.
The visitors are taken only through
the Memorial Church. For the further
education of students already here
we give a summary of the lecture
The Chapel was built in Episco

palian style by Mrs. Stanford in
memory of Senator Stanford. The col
lection of mosaics is the largest in
America. Those on the outside of the
church represent the Sermon on the
Mount; inside a series of Bible
stories is pictured. The stained glass
windows show incidents in the life
of Christ. The mosaic above the altar
is "The Last Supper." It is the only
copy allowed to be made from the
original by Roselli in the Sistine
Chapel in Rome. This is undoubtedly
the finest of the collection.
Then start the questions, sensible
and otherwise. "Is there really a mil
lion dollars' worth of gold in the mo
saics?" "This is Stanford University,
but where is Leland Stanford Junior
College?" Standing in the inner quad
rangle, someone will say, "Where is
the campus?" There is always the
query, "How about Stanford women?
How do they rate?" The visitors also
ask about the cost of attending the
University, about the curriculum, the
number of hours, and do you have to
work hard?
But one and all, when they leave,
declare it is the prettiest campus
with the best setting that they have
visited ,and they all remark how
lucky we are to belong here.
