# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Last year the American league club
of St. Louis was a colorless lot, a
drab seventh-place outfit almost all
season long, but with the house clean
ing that Phil Ball and Dan Howley
have done came also a bit of interior
decorating that added at least two
touches of color to the 1928 model.
Rice Galloway and Van Gilder, you re
member, were traded to Detroit for
Heinie Manush and Lu Blue, and
Bing Miller was sent to the Athletics
for Sammy Gray.
With the acquisition of "the Blue
and the Gray" the Browns, instead of
being split by a civil war, pepped up
immediately and blasted their way
up into the first division where they
are at this writing, more than a month
after the opening of the season.
Mr. Blue , it will be noticed, is hit
ting around .300, while the famous
Mr. Sisler whom he succeeded, is
barely hitting his weight, if that
much, for Washington. Mr. Gray, the
big right-hander from Texas has won
some half a dozen games while los
ing two or three. Mr. Blue, a left
handed first baseman who bats from
either side of the plate, hit .311 for

. the Tigers in 1924 and has come
clown steadily since then, reaching a
low mark of .260 in 1927, so it seems
that a change of scenery did him
some good. Mr. Gray, a knockout in
1925 until he hurt his thumb, won 44
and lost 33 games for Connie Mack
in four years. He tried to beat his
old team mates on May 11 but was
knocked out of the box.
It will be interesting to see to what
rosy heights the Browns soar with
the help of Blue and Gray.
