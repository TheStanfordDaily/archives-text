# GREATEST WAVE OF CRIME SPREAD OVER FARM IN 1915
## Tales of Midnight Prowlers Lurking in Darkness Read Like Modern Mystery Novel; Strange Thefts at Chi O, Sigma Kappa, Theta Delt Houses Revealed 
### 
Night prowlers and burglars reached
j their heydey on the campus back in
the dear dead days of 1915.
Marauders invaded sorority houses
j and gave the sisters thrills and
j shivers in the spine, nor did the
brothers escape unscathed.
For instance, there was the ama
teur who invaded the Chi O house.
His visit might never have been
known, but he left muddy footprints
on the window sill, after gaining en
trance by way of a new fire escape
which was the pride of the Chi
Omega's hearts. For a man —and the
muddy footprints looked distinctly
masculine —he had rather a feminine
taste. He confined his theft to four
pairs of shoes, an equal number of
kid gloves, an initialed hand mirror,
a small ring, a book, and twenty
cents. He must have been an amateur
for he left some valuable jewelry and
a purse with a considerable sum of
money in it.

Then there was the daring soul who
escaped during a heated debate at
the Sigma Kappa house over whether
i the <Chi Psi's or D.U.'s should be
! called to drive off the bold thief. The
! Chi Psi's were favored because they
| were better dancers and had more
i members in the Glee Club, but the
I D.U.'s were regarded as being hus
-1 kier. A little pledge was instructed
! to call them, but instead of saying
1-1-1-2 she was so frightened she stut
| tered one-one-one-one, and the oper
-1 ator connected her with 1-1-1-1, none
! other than the Chi Psi's. Over came
the pajama-clad Chi Psi's —or did they
wear night shirts in those days?
They upturned the Sigma Kappa
house from chimney to cellar. Every
room, every door, all the cupboards,
j all the drawers, all the chests were
| hurriedly opened and examined in the
! hope of finding something that should
n't b« there. Nothing was, and there
is reason to believe that the sisters |
were aroused by a stealthy drip of;
the kitchen faucet.
But don't think the women were
the only ones to suffer from these
shady workers.
imagine the plight of the Theta :
Delta Chi freshman when a woman j
jumped at him from behind the por-1
tieres while he was answering the!
telephone late one night. Why she j
jumped is not recorded, but It is re- i
corded that after a brief struggle he
overpowered her, and found that she
had the house silverware wrapped up
in a napkin from the dining-room
table.
She began crying softly, saying she ;
was a junior living at Madrona, and
was a kleptomaniac. Begging for j
secrecy, she walked out of doors, but i
' the Theta Dclt followed. Once outside !
j she evidently became conscience- |
j stricken, admitting she was not a stu-!
| dent. This convinced her captor she j
was but a designing adventuress, so j
he dragged her back in. The unfor- ;
tunate woman tried to commit suicide j
by drinking a bottle of chloroform 1
fhe had convenient in her pocket. But
: with great presence of mind he ;
; dashed the bottle from her hand, sav-1
ing the situation, not to mention the 1
woman.
By this time the men were all
aroused, and' held a council of war.
1 The soft-hearted brothers decided to
release her to avoid notoriety.
Then they called the police, who,
so far as is known, are still looking
j for her.
