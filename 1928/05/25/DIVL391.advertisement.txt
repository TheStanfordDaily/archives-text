Gentlemen:
I sure get some riled when I see
where some fellow is crowing over the
fact that being older, and having run
into Edgeworth sooner than his less
fortunate compatriots, he challenges
the world as the champion long-time
member of the Edgeworth Club.
Ho doesn't deserve any medals. He
got his reward in the enjoyment of his
smoking for the added number of years.
He was just lucky in starting sooner,
that's all.
However, if you care to delve into
ancient history, look up when they
first started to pull down the old Grand
Central Station in New York,* then
add at least sijc months to that, and
you will arrive at the approximate
time when I first joined the club.
I have smoked at least one pipeful
of every other tobacco I have seen
advertised, sometimes through neces
sity, but most of the time to prove to
myself that I have been right in stick
ing to the old blue tin.
Yours truly,
H. M. Wittridge
