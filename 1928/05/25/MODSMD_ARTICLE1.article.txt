Today will see the curtain drawn
on 1928's greatest athletic drama —
the 1.C.4-A. Robert L. Templeton and
his Cardinals, chief players, stand in
the wings, ready for the most scintil
lating performance of their careers.
Perhaps today's work might he bet
ter called a dress rehearsal, for it is
tomorrow that the principal business
is begun. But the success of the real
drama, from a Stanford viewpoint at
least, depends upon the polish and
technique shown by the Cards this
afternoon.
Last Year's Trials
Last year the trials proved some
what of a disappointment to Stanford
fans. Several of the outstanding men
failed to come through as expected,
and things looked rather dark for
Cardinal chances next day. However,
the teani succeeded and the 1.C.4-A.
title came back West with them.
It is the purpose of Templeton and
his charges this afternoon to remove
all such unnecessary mental anguish
by booming through the trial heats.
That is a story which won't be told
very definitely until the whole thing
is finished. It seems likely that last
season's misfortune will put the
Cardinals sufficiently on edge to make
them perform with absolute precision.
Dink, it appears, gives his team 35
points in the finals tomorrow, which
certainly indicates that he doesn't ex
pect them to fail today. And Temple
ton is usually right. There are plenty
of those, however, that believe he is
"wrong in his prediction—wrong in not
"being optimistic enough. According to
the majority of typewriter tracksters
Stanford should score at least 40
points against the field tomorrow, and
that guess doesn't seem far off.
Some idea of Stanford's strength
and of the numerous championship
prospects which loom tomorrow may
he seen in the following array of
powerful contenders:
High jump—Bob King, Stanford;
and Tom Maynard, Dartmouth; na
tional titleholders of 192G and 1927
respectively.
Shotput—Eric Krenz and Harlow
Rothert, Stanford; and Dace Adel
man, Georgetown, not to mention the
various and sundry Card weight
heavers who will be on deck.
Broad jump—Zombro and Dyer,
Stanford, and A1 Bates, University of
Pennsylvania.
High hurdles —Nichols, Stanford;
Wells, Dartmouth; Collier, Brown.
Quarter Mile —Spencer, Stanford;
Ross, Yale; Barbuti, Syracuse.
Javelin —Sparling, Stanford; Hines,
Georgetown.
Pole Vault —Edmonds, Stanford;
Barnes, Southern California; Carr,
Yale.
This brief compilation does not in
clude the several other Cardinal
names on the roster which may be
written in capital letters when the
thing is over. There is Henry Coe,
lank two-miler; Clarence West, low
hurdler; Forster and Fleishhaoker, ;
weight stars; Kibby and Joaquin, '
javelin throwers; and John Morrison, i
quarter-miler.
