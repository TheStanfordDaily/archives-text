# CONGRESSMEN EVASIVE WHEN OUIZZED ABOUT McNARY-HAUGEN VETO

### 
WASHINGTON, May 24.— (U.P.) —
As if in resentment at President
Coolidge's scathing veto of the farm
bill, Congress today overrode other
vetoes of his in five rapid-fire votes,
four in the Senate and one in the
House. One attempt in the Senate
failed. Only once before, on the sol
dier bonus has Congress disregarded
a Coolidge veto.
Meanwhile farm leaders in the Sen
ate, still indignant over the Presi
dent's emphatic denunciation of the
McNary-Haugen bill, considered
whether to attempt to pass it over
the vetto. The Senate Agriculture
Committee may decide Friday wheth
er to make the effort. Opinion is di
vided. One Senate leader who voted
for the bill and knows the mind of
the Senate better than any other
member, said positively today that the
veto would be sustained if it is forced
to a test. What senators have switch
ed their votes to make this possible
he would not reveal.
