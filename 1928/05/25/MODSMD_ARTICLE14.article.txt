# DELTA CHI TRIMS PHI DELT NINE, TAKES TITLE
## Robinson, Winning Pitcher, Is Day's Individual Star, Fans Eleven Men 
### Whitney Wright 
By Whitney Wright

Taking advantage of every break
and playing an airtight brand of
baseball, the Delta Chi nine yester
day captured the 1928 intramural
baseball championship by defeating
the Phi Delta Theta team 5 to 1 in a
hard-fought game, marred only by an
injury to Chuck Smalling, Phi Delt
pitcher, in the sixth inning.
Edwin Robinson, Delta Chi liurler,
was the individual star of the day, his
excellent pitching and clear head
work contributing greatly to his
team's victory. Robinson fanned
eleven men in the seven innings and
allowed only one walk.
First Innings Close
The first four innings were nip-and
tuck affairs, each team scoring but
one run. The Phi Delts were the first
to put a man across the home plate,
Reynolds scoring when Robinson
weakened for a minute in the first
half of the second inning and al
lowed two hits, the only ones per
mitted by the Delta Chi pitcher dur
ing the game.
Their opponents retaliated in the
second half of the inning, however,
\ when Don Goodcell advanced around
j the bases on three errors committed !
I in quick succession by the Phi Delt
| infield. Smalling then tightened up
! and fanned the next two men to re
< tire his opposition.
Third, Fourth Uneventful
The third and fourth innings were
uneventful, but in the fifth Robinson
reached first on an error by Long of
Phi Delta Theta and scored a minute
later when A1 Biaggini knocked a long |
fly through the arms of Frost, Phi
Delt center-fielder, and galloped
three-fourths of the way around the
j circuit before the ball was returned. ;
This catastrophe would not have i
I been sufficient to defeat the ;
Phi Delts, but troubles never come
! singly and in the sixth inning Small
ing suffered a painful injury to his
foot on sliding into first base and
was forced to retire from the game.
I Up to this time Smalling had played !
an airtight game and had aided great- j
iy in keeping the Delta Chi score
down by allowing only one hit and i
striking out five men.
I Mike Reynolds was substituted but i
I seemed unable to hit his stride, the 1
i Delta Chi batters ran riot, pounding
the horsehide to every corner of the
field before the end of the inning.
During this time three Delta Chi men
crossed the home plate, finishing the
i scoring.
