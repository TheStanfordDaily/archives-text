## Two More Small Feminine Parts Are Still To Be Assigned on Cast 
### 
Casting for "One of the Family,"
senior farce to be given June 13, has
been practically completed, an
nounces Anna May Price, dramatic
director. Only two minor women's
roles remain to be assigned.
Dorothy Garnier plays the part of I
Joyce Smith, the leading role. Doug
las Gregg plays opposite her as
Henry Adams, older brother in the
Adams family of Boston, which is
"The Family" in the play.
Sarah Margaret Burns will be
Priscilla Adams, the maiden aunt and
guiding force in the Adams family, j
This, and the part of an old family I
servant, are the two character roles |
in the play.
Penelope Adams, the younger sister i
flapper who values her two brothers j
chiefly as check-book substitutes, will
be played by Helen Thompson. Kath
leen Fitz has been cast in the role
of Irene, the rather baby-doll wife of
George Adams. The parts of Lucy, j
older sister of Penelope, and of Mag- j
gie, the family retainer, will be an- j
nounced later.
George Adams, Henry's younger
ln-other, will be played by David Haw
ley. Hal Boomer will take the part of
Frank Owens, handsome young trifler,
and nephew to Martin Burke. Burke,
to be played by John Atwill, is the
successful middle-aged business man
and the prospective boss of Henry
Adams.
This play, which has just completed
a popular season in New York, is new |
to the West coast. The story con
cerns the reception the Boston
Adamses, steeped in the old tradi
tions, give to Henry's bride, and the
situations resulting. Joyce Smith is
to them a mere nobody, most parti- j
cularly to Aunt Priscilla, who there
upon undertakes to persuade Henry
of his mistake. The complications fol
lowing the Adams' resolve to make
Joyce "one of the family" form the j
basis for the amusing plot.
