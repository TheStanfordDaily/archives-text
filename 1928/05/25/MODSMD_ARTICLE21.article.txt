# PETITION PROTESTS BAN ON MUD-FIGHT BY EX COMMITTEE
## 
### 
A petition has been drawn up
with fifty names attached to op
pose the action taken by the Ex
Committee last fall to discon
tinue the annual mudfight in fa
vor of a tie-up. The written pro
test has been handed to the Ex
Committee and action will be
taken on it Tuesday. The peti
tion is an instrument purporting
to show that the sentiment of
the student body is for adhering
to the mud-fight tradition.
The mud-fight was abandoned
last fall quarter by the Ex Com
mittee partly because of a letter
received from President Wilbur
strenuously opposing it.
