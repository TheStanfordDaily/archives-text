As practice for the Junior National
Ten-foot Outdoor Diving Champion
! ship draws to a close, three men,
Herman Ringler, Ed Throndson, and
I Herb Marsh, are closely grouped as
j the leading contenders, with Ringler
a slight favorite. The contest will be
held in Encina Pool today at 3 o'clock,
admission by student body cards or
fifty cents.
Ringler, Middle-Atlantic champion,
is at tip-top form, due to his hard
work during the past week, and
; shows marked improvement since his
arrival here from the Pennsylvania
Athletic Club. Ringler has polished
up his gainer and hack take-off dives
which were his weak points, and
looks like a strong bid for the title
today.
Throndson Has Advantage
Ed Throndson, varsity diver of last
quarter who is now competing unat
! tached, has the advantage of per
forming in his home tank on a famil
iar board. He is diving well, and
judging by the way he showed up
i against A1 White at the Olympic Club
; last Sunday, Throndson should give
i Ringler a good run for his money.
The third man favored is Herb
Marsh, Stanford freshman. Marsh
came here without any previous train
ing, quickly proved himself to be
championship material, and has de
veloped remarkably under Coach
Ernst Brandsten's instruction. Marsh
has been handicapped this week by
I a bad cold which has kept him out
of practice and weakened him some.
Despite his lack of competitive experi
! ence, performance in practice has
shown that there is a very small mar
gin between him and the other two
leaders.
Ileinie Gron, Big-Ten champion, is
definitely out of the running due to
his back injury. A1 Stariha, veteran
diver of the bay region who is now
with the Olympic Club of San Fran
cisco, will enter the meet favored by
long experience on the springboard.
Bill Pomeroy, another entry from the
same club, is a newly developed diver
of whom little is known except that
lie shows considerable promise. The
other entries' names have not been
released yet by the officials.
Stanford students will be given an
opportunity to see the greatest group
of divers, past and present, who have
ever been brought together. Not even
the national championship meet has
been able to offer such a variegated
assembly of championship titleholders
from 1920 on, as will be seen today,
due to the fact that it has been un
able to attract past Olympic Games
champions.
A1 White has promised to be here.
Pete Desjardins, Dave Fall, Louie Bal
back, Wally Colbath, and Walter
Krissel will all give an exhibition.
Bob Hallaran, member of the Illi
nois Athletic Club championship re
lay team, will race in the 50-yard dash
against Harrison, Thomas, Brown,
and Lucy, of Stanford. Hallaran will
take on Hadley Bramel in the 100-
yard dash, and in the century breast
stroke race Burns, Ophuls, and Cun
dall will compete. There will be a
200-foot backstroke race between
Driggs, Smiih, and Brown, and the
swimming exhibition will end with a
4-man relay race between Stanford
and an All-Star team, each man swim
ming one lap.
Pete Desjardins and Wally Colbath
will put on the famous comedy act
which they have performed all over
the country with great success.
