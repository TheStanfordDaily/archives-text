# Fraternity Laws

### 
Last night members of the lnterfraternity Board of Control and the
President and Secretary-Treasurer of the Council were elected by fra
ternity representatives. Whether or not these men realize it now, they
have a good job all lined up for them. This job is to see that the present
rules regarding rushing are straightened out, and that they are observed.
In the past years there have been rushing rules and there have been
violations of those rules just as much as in the present year. But a man
was afraid to turn in the violations he saw for fear that someone in his
own fraternity had done much the same thing and that the house he was
accusing would come back at his ownâ€”and there you were.
But it has been shown this year that that attitude will not continue.
Several houses were turned in, and received penalties. 1 his was as it
should be. But in the case of one fraternity, it is claimed that a freshman
came up to a couple of the brothers when all three were at a party down
South, and started talking to them. They, naturally, did not snub the kid,
and a conversation ensued. Well, a member of another fraternity happened
to be at the same place, and saw this flagrant digression. The affair was
turned in, the house confessed its sins, and was docked a week's rushing
privileges. This is nearly as silly as the rule about women's social pro
bation, mentioned in this column yesterday.
Perhaps this was not a direct violation of a specific rule. In fact, we
interpret it as not being. But the difficulty is, the code of rules is so
poorly worked out and worded that it is hard to say just what acts are
prohibited, and what should be done in a given case when it is decided
that the act is prohibited. There is no difficulty in telling whether a thing
is against the spirit of the code, but legal minds will work, and this makes
it necessary for all rules to be specific and easily interpreted.
An unfortunate matter came up during the first week of rushing, the
period during which the houses penalized were not allowed to rush. These
fraternities asked that some additional days be put on the second or third
period, in order, they said, that they might more easily finish off their
courtesy dates. Well, whether or not this was the purpose, the question
was not met with approval by the other members of the Council. It was
well, for if the Council is going to have penalties, and these seem neces
sary, then they must be lived up to or the whole thing will go on the rocks.
If fraternities are going to maintain the respect they now have they
must show an ability to handle their own affairs, and to do this, the laws
under which they operate must be revised and then enforced. It is up to
next year's officers to see that these things are done.
