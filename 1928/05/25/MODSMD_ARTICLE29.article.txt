# Outlook Promising

A story in yesterday's Daily announced the fact that tentative plans for
the long-awaited new women's gymnasium were submitted to Comptroller
A. E. Roth at a meeting on Wednesday of A.W.S. and W.A.A. com
mittees working on the laudable project.
The first step, then, toward replacing the barn which for thirty-seven
years has served Stanford women's physical education needs has been
made. Thirty-seven years of temporariness is about all any wooden shack
should be permitted to endure.
The likelihood of a gym's being erected seems fairly promising. The
Board of Athletic Control was recently approached by the committees, with
Miss Helen Masters Bunting, director of women's physical education, as
chairman, in an effort to solicit financial support. The Board replied that
when definite plans were at hand, it would consider contributing to the
cost of the plant.
In compliance with the request of the 8.A.C., the gymnasium com
mittees have asked Comptroller Roth to have Bakewell and Brown, Uni
versity architects, draw up plans for the gym. Miss Bunting estimates
that the building will cost approximately $350,000. Provision will be made
for the following units: dance studio, corrective clinic, sun porch to be
used as a rest room, gymnasium, two outdoor swimming pools, offices fqj*
the teaching staff, and two class rooms and a library for the work of the
students majoring in physical education. Two swimming pools will be
needed, according to Miss Bunting, so that women may use one for rec
reational swimming and one for swimming classes.
The women of the University hope that the Board of Athletic Control
will approve of the plans and find itself able to make the new gym pos
sible. Although they have no right to expect aid from the Board, they
believe that in view of their financial helplessness the Board, if it is able,
should be willing to help them as members of the University. Certainly not
an unreasonable request.
