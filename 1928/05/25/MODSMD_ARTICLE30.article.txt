# Louie Lose Muey

Broadway and Hollywood favorites arc not the only ones who have
their names used in gold brick hoaxes. Up in San Francisco there is poor
Dr. Y. Q. Gin, a gullible soul who was much smitten by the dainty Chinese
actress Mucy Mo Jing, who had been appearing at the Mandarin Theatre.
His attentions being refused by the young lady, a would-be matchmaker,
Louie I'oy by name, offered to fix it up with Miss Jing for a handsome fee,
and some jewelry for the suitee.
Louie is now lodged in the city prison, Mucy is on the high seas, and
the doctor is out about $15,000.
Evidently our prognostication of recent date that the Chinese would
become hardened to seeing women on their stages, and that the fair ones
would be exploited in much the same manner as those of our own stages,
i starting to see fulfillment.
