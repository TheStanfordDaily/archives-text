WE WOULD RESTORE THE
MUD-FIGHT TO GLORY
Last January, now some time ago,
the Ex Committee decided that the
mud-fight was due to join the ragged
ranks of outworn Stanford traditions.
It joined. In its place our local law
makers substituted the tie-up, a worthy
enough sport, perhaps, but one not
half as exciting or spectacular as the
banished mud battle.
Poor Management
The mud-fight last October seems
to have been something of a wash
out, and that is what led the Ex Com
mittee to reinstall the institution of
the tie-up which had been discarded
in favor or the mud-fight back in
1923. The most recent foray was a
failure for various reasons, but main
ly because of poor management and
poor sportsmanship. Reading the ac
count in the Daily of October 10, we
learn that "some men were complete
ly stripped during the course of the
fighting .... Though almost three
quarters of an hour late in starting,
the fight dragged on indefinitely. . . .
Violations of the 'rules' were as com
mon as burrs in the Lagunita lake
bottom."
Grievous Faults
These, we agree with the Ex Com
mittee, are grievous faults. But did
not a committee appointed by the Ex
Committee have charge? Surely some
of the failure must be charged to the
lack of adequate organization and in
struction before the fight began. Was
the management very clever that let
the opposing forces arrive nearly an
hour late upon the scene? Hardly.
The freshmen, for instance, were told
to assemble in front of Encina for
war paint and instructions at 2 o'clock
on the afternoon of the fight, just
one-half of an hour before the fray
was scheduled to begin. Who could
expect such an inexperienced and ex
cited rabble to organize, listen to in
structions, march over to the lake
bottom, listen to more instructions,
and be ready to fight in thirty min
utes? Naturally the fight was late in
starting.
Avoided the Issue
As we see it, the Ex Committee
weakly avoided the issue. Instead
of making a valiant effort to
straighten out the mud-fight, they
threw it overboard, for what?
For something which has but a
fraction of the excitement for the
participants and the spectators,
and which, nevertheless, has a
predisposition for all the evils in
herent in the mud-fight and pos
sibly for a few more of its own.
Clean and Pure —Maybe
If there was poor sportsmanship in
the mud-fight, does this mean that
the tie-up will be clean and pure? If

there was a little involuntary exliibi- '
tionism in the mud-fight, does this
assure the timid ones that no clothes I
can be possibly torn off in the tie-up?
If the committee in charge was unable
to handle the mud-fight, will it be any j
more likely to cope with a mass of
writhing humanity trying to tie one
another up like so many fallen
steers? We think not.
In passing we would like to com- j
ment that hemp, when wrapped about
bare tissues, even in playful circum- j
stances, is quite capable of cutting I
and otherwisely lacerating said tis
sues. In the heat of the melee who is
going to do his tieing carefully and
considerately? Nobody. In the excite
ment somebody will probably get a
rope tied around his neck instead of
his arms. What fun.
Needs Leadership
The mud-fight can be run clean. J
What is needed is adequate and well- j
organized leadership on the part of i
the upperclassmen in charge. The j
sophomores need not be told more
than once; they have been at Stan- |
ford long enough to realize that honor
and sportsmanship must irrevocably
be given first place in any activity;
the freshmen, being so new, must
have these facts constantly repeated
to them before the fight. If both sides
are fully and properly appraised that :
the continuance of the last and per- I
haps the most colorful of the old j
Stanford traditions depends solely j
upon their good conduct, and if the j
rules are clearly explained and un- I
derstood beforehand (not merely re- j
cited in the tumult preceding the hos- |
tilities), there is every reason to be
live that the game will be played
fairly, excepting, of course, a few in
fractions which must always be ex
pected in over-excited combat.
Against Tie-Up
We have yet to talk with a per
son who does not want to see the
mud-fight returned. Some fresh
men go so far as to say that their
class is for the mud-fight to a
man, and they freely predict that
few of their number will turn out
for a tie-up, if one is held next
October.
Because we are just sentimental
enough to want at least one memento
of the days which are past, we hate
to see the mud-fight go. It doesn't
matter so much who wins, it is the
spirit, the color, and the excitement
of the thing that counts. We have i
seen tie-ups, and they don't compare |
in excitement. Hence, we prophecy j
that hardly anybody will take the
trouble to stand in a hot lake bottom
for an hour to see a tie-up, and then
the tie-up will pass, and so will our
j last tradition.

WE WOULD RESTORE THE
MUD-FIGHT TO GLORY
Last January, now some time ago,
the Ex Committee decided that the
mud-fight was due to join the ragged
ranks of outworn Stanford traditions.
It joined. In its place our local law
makers substituted the tie-up, a worthy
enough sport, perhaps, but one not
half as exciting or spectacular as the
banished mud battle.
Poor Management
The mud-fight last October seems
to have been something of a wash
out, and that is what led the Ex Com
mittee to reinstall the institution of
the tie-up which had been discarded
in favor or the mud-fight back in
1923. The most recent foray was a
failure for various reasons, but main
ly because of poor management and
poor sportsmanship. Reading the ac
count in the Daily of October 10, we
learn that "some men were complete
ly stripped during the course of the
fighting .... Though almost three
quarters of an hour late in starting,
the fight dragged on indefinitely. . . .
Violations of the 'rules' were as com
mon as burrs in the Lagunita lake
bottom."
Grievous Faults
These, we agree with the Ex Com
mittee, are grievous faults. But did
not a committee appointed by the Ex
Committee have charge? Surely some
of the failure must be charged to the
lack of adequate organization and in
struction before the fight began. Was
the management very clever that let
the opposing forces arrive nearly an
hour late upon the scene? Hardly.
The freshmen, for instance, were told
to assemble in front of Encina for
war paint and instructions at 2 o'clock
on the afternoon of the fight, just
one-half of an hour before the fray
was scheduled to begin. Who could
expect such an inexperienced and ex
cited rabble to organize, listen to in
structions, march over to the lake
bottom, listen to more instructions,
and be ready to fight in thirty min
utes? Naturally the fight was late in
starting.
Avoided the Issue
As we see it, the Ex Committee
weakly avoided the issue. Instead
of making a valiant effort to
straighten out the mud-fight, they
threw it overboard, for what?
For something which has but a
fraction of the excitement for the
participants and the spectators,
and which, nevertheless, has a
predisposition for all the evils in
herent in the mud-fight and pos
sibly for a few more of its own.
Clean and Pure —Maybe
If there was poor sportsmanship in
the mud-fight, does this mean that
the tie-up will be clean and pure? If

there was a little involuntary exliibi- '
tionism in the mud-fight, does this
assure the timid ones that no clothes I
can be possibly torn off in the tie-up?
If the committee in charge was unable
to handle the mud-fight, will it be any j
more likely to cope with a mass of
writhing humanity trying to tie one
another up like so many fallen
steers? We think not.
In passing we would like to com- j
ment that hemp, when wrapped about
bare tissues, even in playful circum- j
stances, is quite capable of cutting I
and otherwisely lacerating said tis
sues. In the heat of the melee who is
going to do his tieing carefully and
considerately? Nobody. In the excite
ment somebody will probably get a
rope tied around his neck instead of
his arms. What fun.
Needs Leadership
The mud-fight can be run clean. J
What is needed is adequate and well- j
organized leadership on the part of i
the upperclassmen in charge. The j
sophomores need not be told more
than once; they have been at Stan- |
ford long enough to realize that honor
and sportsmanship must irrevocably
be given first place in any activity;
the freshmen, being so new, must
have these facts constantly repeated
to them before the fight. If both sides
are fully and properly appraised that :
the continuance of the last and per- I
haps the most colorful of the old j
Stanford traditions depends solely j
upon their good conduct, and if the j
rules are clearly explained and un- I
derstood beforehand (not merely re- j
cited in the tumult preceding the hos- |
tilities), there is every reason to be
live that the game will be played
fairly, excepting, of course, a few in
fractions which must always be ex
pected in over-excited combat.
Against Tie-Up
We have yet to talk with a per
son who does not want to see the
mud-fight returned. Some fresh
men go so far as to say that their
class is for the mud-fight to a
man, and they freely predict that
few of their number will turn out
for a tie-up, if one is held next
October.
Because we are just sentimental
enough to want at least one memento
of the days which are past, we hate
to see the mud-fight go. It doesn't
matter so much who wins, it is the
spirit, the color, and the excitement
of the thing that counts. We have i

pected in over-excited combat.
Against Tie-Up
We have yet to talk with a per
son who does not want to see the
mud-fight returned. Some fresh
men go so far as to say that their
class is for the mud-fight to a
man, and they freely predict that
few of their number will turn out
for a tie-up, if one is held next
October.
Because we are just sentimental
enough to want at least one memento
of the days which are past, we hate
to see the mud-fight go. It doesn't
matter so much who wins, it is the
spirit, the color, and the excitement
of the thing that counts. We have i
seen tie-ups, and they don't compare |
in excitement. Hence, we prophecy j
that hardly anybody will take the
trouble to stand in a hot lake bottom
for an hour to see a tie-up, and then
the tie-up will pass, and so will our
j last tradition.

WE WOULD RESTORE THE
MUD-FIGHT TO GLORY
Last January, now some time ago,
the Ex Committee decided that the
mud-fight was due to join the ragged
ranks of outworn Stanford traditions.
It joined. In its place our local law
makers substituted the tie-up, a worthy
enough sport, perhaps, but one not
half as exciting or spectacular as the
banished mud battle.
Poor Management
The mud-fight last October seems
to have been something of a wash
out, and that is what led the Ex Com
mittee to reinstall the institution of
the tie-up which had been discarded
in favor or the mud-fight back in
1923. The most recent foray was a
failure for various reasons, but main
ly because of poor management and
poor sportsmanship. Reading the ac
count in the Daily of October 10, we
learn that "some men were complete
ly stripped during the course of the
fighting .... Though almost three
quarters of an hour late in starting,
the fight dragged on indefinitely. . . .
Violations of the 'rules' were as com
mon as burrs in the Lagunita lake
bottom."
Grievous Faults
These, we agree with the Ex Com
mittee, are grievous faults. But did
not a committee appointed by the Ex
Committee have charge? Surely some
of the failure must be charged to the
lack of adequate organization and in
struction before the fight began. Was
the management very clever that let
the opposing forces arrive nearly an
hour late upon the scene? Hardly.
The freshmen, for instance, were told
to assemble in front of Encina for
war paint and instructions at 2 o'clock
on the afternoon of the fight, just
one-half of an hour before the fray
was scheduled to begin. Who could
expect such an inexperienced and ex
cited rabble to organize, listen to in
structions, march over to the lake
bottom, listen to more instructions,
and be ready to fight in thirty min
utes? Naturally the fight was late in
starting.
Avoided the Issue
As we see it, the Ex Committee
weakly avoided the issue. Instead
of making a valiant effort to
straighten out the mud-fight, they
threw it overboard, for what?
For something which has but a
fraction of the excitement for the
participants and the spectators,
and which, nevertheless, has a
predisposition for all the evils in
herent in the mud-fight and pos
sibly for a few more of its own.
Clean and Pure —Maybe
If there was poor sportsmanship in
the mud-fight, does this mean that
the tie-up will be clean and pure? If

there was a little involuntary exliibi- '
tionism in the mud-fight, does this
assure the timid ones that no clothes I
can be possibly torn off in the tie-up?
If the committee in charge was unable
to handle the mud-fight, will it be any j
more likely to cope with a mass of
writhing humanity trying to tie one
another up like so many fallen
steers? We think not.
In passing we would like to com- j
ment that hemp, when wrapped about
bare tissues, even in playful circum- j
stances, is quite capable of cutting I
and otherwisely lacerating said tis
sues. In the heat of the melee who is
going to do his tieing carefully and
considerately? Nobody. In the excite
ment somebody will probably get a
rope tied around his neck instead of
his arms. What fun.
Needs Leadership
The mud-fight can be run clean. J
What is needed is adequate and well- j
organized leadership on the part of i
the upperclassmen in charge. The j
sophomores need not be told more
than once; they have been at Stan- |
ford long enough to realize that honor
and sportsmanship must irrevocably
be given first place in any activity;
the freshmen, being so new, must
have these facts constantly repeated
to them before the fight. If both sides
are fully and properly appraised that :
the continuance of the last and per- I
haps the most colorful of the old j
Stanford traditions depends solely j
upon their good conduct, and if the j
rules are clearly explained and un- I
derstood beforehand (not merely re- j
cited in the tumult preceding the hos- |
tilities), there is every reason to be
live that the game will be played
fairly, excepting, of course, a few in
fractions which must always be ex
pected in over-excited combat.
