"The Lilies of the Field." Columbia
Theatre.
Here is a play your proverbially inno
cent sixteen-year-old sister would enjoy,
for despite the provocative title it is
amazingly nai\e and pleasantly innocu
ous. "Wings" has finally ended its long
run, and the Moroni Olsen Players are
presenting an evening of good, clean fun
(we mean this absolutely literally!) which
I will not offend the most fastidious. It is
! the same type of play as "The Romantic
Young Lady," and if you liked that cam
pus production you will doubtless enjoy
the new show at the Columbia.
The lilies of this field are not the kind
that appeared in the picture of the same
name. We have memories of Corinne
Griffith and other beauties toiling and
spinning not as sophisticated Broadway
chorines. But the stage version deals
with two homespun twins who are daugh
ters of a minister and live in an English
country vicarage. Much is made of their
< schemes, but it is hard for us to get ex
{cited or shocked at their attempts to pro
vide themselves with husbands. 1 here
are frequent laughs in all three acts, but
the comedy is never uproariously funny
nor smartly satirical.
The plot is not complicated and yet is
amusing. The twins must undergo a test
to see which birthday present their rich
grandmother will give to each. Ten yards
of the finest crepe dc chine and a season
in London high society arc the prizes, and
the casual visit of an antique collector to
ithe vicarage provides a means of settling
which twin is to get the most desirable
i present—the London trip. The grand
mother decides that the girl who makes
the biggest hit with the visitor shall go
back to the city with her.
One twin affects flapper garb and line,
the other goes Victorian and completely
captivates the antiquarian with her long
dresses, demure ways, and deep curtsies.
The fun conies in when she goes to Lon
don and is forced to keep up her mas
querade as an old-fashioned girl. She
bccomes the belle of the city because of

her quaint manners and costumes. Then
Love steals into her life, the antiquarian
who preferred her to her flapper sister
proposing marriage—the goal for which
she has been aiming. He admires her for
her Victorianism, and so the climax is
What to Do? Confess her deception and
risk losing him or go on playing the nine
teenth-century model all her life?
Need we add that true love conquers all
eventually ? It seems to us that there are
much greater possibilities to this plot than
the author, Joseph Hastings Turner, has
utilized. Dorothy Adams and Marion
Clayton save the play by their vivacious
portrayals of the twins, and Janet Young
is interesting as the grandmother.
We understand that this company has
been playing together five years, present
ing "The Lilies of the Field" for a year
in London ; yet to us the other members
of the cast, aside from those mentioned,
were merely adequate. And the show is
satisfactory if you insist upon good, clean
fun 1
