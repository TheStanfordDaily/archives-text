# ZOOLOGY GRADUATES DOING WORK IN FIELD OF FISH RESEARCH
## 
### 
Graduate students in the Zoology
department are doing field work re
lating to fish researches which are
connected with both the State Fish
and Game Commission and the United
States Bureau of Fisheries. This sum
mer program co-ordinates with in
vestigations that have been going on
for a long time.
The summer operations in field
work extend all the way from the
southern boundaries of California to
northern Alaska. The work will con
sist of studies of salmon, trout, hali
but, sardines, and other fishes, be
sides the investigations of the life
history of some forms of Pismo clams
and spiny lobster.
H. B. Holmes and Seymour P.
Smith have just departed for Kodiak
Island, Alaska, for the summer.
H. C. McMillin is investigating the
oysters on the Washington coast. G.
H. Clark is engaged in a study of the
salmon of the Columbia River basin.
A. C. Taft is working on the salmon
in Alaska. E. C. Seofield is investi
gating the striped perch of California.
Ludwig Herz is working on the sar
dines in the southern part of the
state and will be located at the state
fisheries laboratory at San Pedro.
Richard Cutter will be making obser
vations on the salmon of the Colum
bia River. W. J. Chamberlin is in
vestigating aquatic insects during the
summer on Dean T. J. Hoover's
ranch.
The salmon work in Alaska is un
der the direction of Dr. Willis H.
Rich, formerly a lecturer in zoology
at Stanford, and now officially con
nected with the United States Bureau
of Fisheries.
