# TRYOUTS FOR CONCERT MANAGERS OF 1929-30 SERIES BEGIN MONDAY
## 
### 
Tryouts for concert manager for the
1929-30 A.S.S.U. series will start Mon
day night at H o'clock, in the student body
office in the Old Union, announces Sidney
Madden, manager for next year's con
certs.
Two positions of fairly equal responsi
bility arc open, that of concert manager,
who will have principal charge of the
tickets, and of house manager, who will
conduct the staging of the concerts.
These managers will be chosen at the
end of next winter quarter.
Both men and women are eligible to
try out, and should be juniors next year,
although this is not imperative. Tryout
work this quarter will consist in selling
tickets and obtaining pledges for next
year's series during the coming week only.
Points will be given in accordance with
the work done, and will be carried over
next fall. Tryouts will be open at that
time also, but those coming out now will
have a decided advantage, says Madden.
Tryout work for these positions will
include handling and distributing tickets,
office work, management of the pavilion,
and the like. Any persons who would be
able to do publicity work in connection
with the concerts are particularly urged
by Madden to try out.
