"California absentee voting privi
leges cannot be extended to students,"
declared Attorney General U. S. Webb
in a letter to Professor E. A. Cottrell
of the Political Science department.
"Students who registered in their
home districts and cast ballots at the
recent election £ts an absentee voter
did so illegally."
An amendment to the state en
franchisement act states that absen
tee voting privileges will be extended
only to those who are: by nature of
occupation forced to travel; engaged
in military, naval, civil, or congres
sional duties; or physically unable to
go to the polls.
"It is obvious," states Webb, "that
students do not qualify in any of
these three classes." The Attorney
General expressed his regret that
there is no provision for student vot
ing and feels that steps should be
taken to provide such a measure.
General uncertainty among student
voters on the campus concerning
their political status caused Professor
Cottrell to write to Webb requesting
his opinion on the matter.

The tallest and shortest men at the
University of Oklahoma were found
to be six feet eight and five feet four
respectively.
