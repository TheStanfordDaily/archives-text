Graham H. Stuart, professor of politi
cal science, has finished revising and re
editing his book "Latin America and the
United States," which was published by
the Century Company six years ago,
bringing the work up to date even with a
thorough consideration of the recent Ha

The book has met with favor in high
schools and colleges throughout the na

as well as for popular reading.
