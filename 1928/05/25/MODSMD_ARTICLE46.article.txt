# SPORTS OF 1928
## Bent-on Winning 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"What's wrong with this pitcher?"
you may ask, and I won't be wrong
when I say, "Not a thing," for Larry
Benton, of the Giants, is one of the
neatest hurlers in the National league.
There certainly are few who will
doubt that statement, while on the
other hand there may be some who
object to my saying that the Giant
pitching staff is any good at all.
True, recent developments in the
West were not all to the liking of
John McGraw, but then, even a
Christy Mathewson was beaten now
and then.
Lawrence James Benton, who leads
all Giant hurlers at this writing in
number of games won, was born in
Cincinnati, Ohio, on November 20,
1897, and first played baseball with
Portsmouth of the Virginia league in
1920. He came to the majors in 1923,
winning five games and losing nine
for the Boston Braves. In 1924 he
won five again and lost seven, lost
seven again the following year but
won twice as many, split even four
teen wins and the same number of
losses in 192G, and then was traded
to the Giants in June, 1927, with Tay

lor and Thomas, for McQuillan, Far
rell and Greenfield, finishing the
season with 17 victories and 7 de
feats.
Resides being a good pitcher, Ben
ton is observant and uses his head.
; In an interview in the Baseball Maga-
I zine about a year ago, Larry divided
pitchers into four general classes, or
groups, as follows: One, those rare
hurlers who seem to have everything;
Two, the fellows with uncommon
stuff; Three, those who depend up
on control; and Four, the poor dubs
who are good one day and bad the
next, or perhaps never too good. He
also makes the interesting observa
tion that many a pitcher has had
his greatest years after hi 3 fast ball
has lost its zip.
