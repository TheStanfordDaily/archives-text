# MODERATE COST FOR MEDICAL CARE TO BE INVESTIGATION TOPIC
## 
### 
Plans for a five-year program of re
search by a committee of eminent phy- j
sicians, sanitarians, economists, and lay- j
men for the purpose of solving the prob- I
lem of adequate medical attention for
families with moderate means, were an
nounced yesterday by Dr. Wilbur, chair- j
man of the committee, according to press j
dispatches from Washington, D.C.
"The importance of the problem may be ,
better appreciated," said Dr. Wilbur, j
"when it is realized that the present cost j
of illness to the people of the United j
States is probably over $5,000,000,000 per j
year."
This will be the first such investigation j
ever attempted, and will be carried on
jointly by the American Medical Asso- j
ciation, the Metropolitan Life Insurance |
Company, the public health service, and j
other agencies. Financial support has been j
supplied by the Carnegie Corporation, the !
Milbank Memorial Fund, the Russell J
Sage Foundation, and the Twentieth Cen
tury Fund.
"Complaints of high charges are becom
ing frequent," Dr. Wilbur declared, "and
I fear some of them are justified." The
system of charging, and not the individual
physicians, is blamed by him for the ex-1
isting conditions.
