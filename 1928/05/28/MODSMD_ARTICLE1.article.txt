## Ed Throndson Rated Second In Junior National Meet Held Here Friday Al White, Dave Fall, Pete Desjardins Stage High Class Exhibition 
### William Grace 
Herman Ringler, national inter
scholastic champion from the Penn
Athletic Club, won the Junior Na
tional Ten-foot Outdoor diving title
in competition against four other men
before a capacity crowd at Encina
pool Friday afternoon.
Second honors were taken by Ed
Throndson, former varsity diver, who
competed unattached, and A1 Stariha,
of the San Francisco Olympic Club,
was given third place. Herb Marsh,
Stanford freshman, was rated fourth.
There was some heated discussion
when the judges announced Marsh as
being out of the money. Coach Ernst
I3randsten said, "I considered Herb
as being third man without any ques
tion. Ringler was a fair winner, and
Throndson's performance warranted
second, but Herb was easily the next
man after him." Jo Kelleher, of the
Olympic Club, lost his chance to place
when he fell down on two dives.
Ringler Consistent Diver
Ringler dove with consistent abil
ity. In the compulsory dives, he did
fairly well, showing above the others
only in his one-and-one-half gainer.
In the optional dives Ringler showed
his skill, doing a double gainer, back
one-and-one-half somersault, and jack
with a full twist in excellent form.
Throndson started his optionals with
a well-executed full gainer, and
starred again with his cut-away one
and-one-half.
The preliminary exhibition started
with a 100-yard breaststroke race be
tween Burns, Cundall, and Ophuls,
all of Stanford. It was swum in
1:15, with Burns in the lead. Next
came the diving exhibition by such
celebrities as A1 White, Pete Desjar
dins, Dave Fall, Wally Colbath, Payne
Thebaut, Wally Krissler, and Louie
Balbach. Desjardins and White drew
the greatest applause by their per
formance on the springboard, while
Fall did some good diving from the
high platform. Colbath gave the
crowd its biggest thrill by pulling his
spotter one-and-one-half somersault
dive.
Century Is Feature
Ogden Driggs won the 220-yard race
over Walt Brown, and Thomas won
the 50-yard dash. The best race of the
day was the century dash between
Reggie Harrison, sprint star of the
Stanford varsity, and Bob Hallaran,
member of the Illinois Athletic Club's
championship relay team, ending in a
dead heat, the time being 57 seconds
flat. Sandy Smith won the two
lengths backstroke race.

In the optional dives Ringler showed
his skill, doing a double gainer, back
one-and-one-half somersault, and jack
with a full twist in excellent form.
Throndson started his optionals with
a well-executed full gainer, and
starred again with his cut-away one
and-one-half.
The preliminary exhibition started
with a 100-yard breaststroke race be
tween Burns, Cundall, and Ophuls,
all of Stanford. It was swum in
1:15, with Burns in the lead. Next
came the diving exhibition by such
celebrities as A1 White, Pete Desjar
dins, Dave Fall, Wally Colbath, Payne
Thebaut, Wally Krissler, and Louie
Balbach. Desjardins and White drew
the greatest applause by their per
formance on the springboard, while
Fall did some good diving from the
high platform. Colbath gave the
crowd its biggest thrill by pulling his
spotter one-and-one-half somersault
dive.
Century Is Feature
Ogden Driggs won the 220-yard race
over Walt Brown, and Thomas won
the 50-yard dash. The best race of the
day was the century dash between
Reggie Harrison, sprint star of the
Stanford varsity, and Bob Hallaran,
member of the Illinois Athletic Club's
championship relay team, ending in a
dead heat, the time being 57 seconds
flat. Sandy Smith won the two
lengths backstroke race.
Herman Ringler, national inter
scholastic champion from the Penn
Athletic Club, won the Junior Na
tional Ten-foot Outdoor diving title
in competition against four other men
before a capacity crowd at Encina
pool Friday afternoon.
Second honors were taken by Ed
Throndson, former varsity diver, who
competed unattached, and A1 Stariha,
of the San Francisco Olympic Club,
was given third place. Herb Marsh,
Stanford freshman, was rated fourth.
There was some heated discussion
when the judges announced Marsh as
being out of the money. Coach Ernst
I3randsten said, "I considered Herb
as being third man without any ques
tion. Ringler was a fair winner, and
Throndson's performance warranted
second, but Herb was easily the next
man after him." Jo Kelleher, of the
Olympic Club, lost his chance to place
when he fell down on two dives.
Ringler Consistent Diver
Ringler dove with consistent abil
ity. In the compulsory dives, he did
fairly well, showing above the others
only in his one-and-one-half gainer.
