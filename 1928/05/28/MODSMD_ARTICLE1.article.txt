Herman Ringler, national inter
scholastic champion from the Penn
Athletic Club, won the Junior Na
tional Ten-foot Outdoor diving title
in competition against four other men
before a capacity crowd at Encina
pool Friday afternoon.
Second honors were taken by Ed
Throndson, former varsity diver, who
competed unattached, and A1 Stariha,
of the San Francisco Olympic Club,
was given third place. Herb Marsh,
Stanford freshman, was rated fourth.
There was some heated discussion
when the judges announced Marsh as
being out of the money. Coach Ernst
I3randsten said, "I considered Herb
as being third man without any ques
tion. Ringler was a fair winner, and
Throndson's performance warranted
second, but Herb was easily the next
man after him." Jo Kelleher, of the
Olympic Club, lost his chance to place
when he fell down on two dives.
Ringler Consistent Diver
Ringler dove with consistent abil
ity. In the compulsory dives, he did
fairly well, showing above the others
only in his one-and-one-half gainer.
In the optional dives Ringler showed
his skill, doing a double gainer, back
one-and-one-half somersault, and jack
with a full twist in excellent form.
Throndson started his optionals with
a well-executed full gainer, and
starred again with his cut-away one
and-one-half.
The preliminary exhibition started
with a 100-yard breaststroke race be
tween Burns, Cundall, and Ophuls,
all of Stanford. It was swum in
1:15, with Burns in the lead. Next
