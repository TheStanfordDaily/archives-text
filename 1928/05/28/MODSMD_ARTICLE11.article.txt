EUGENE. Ore., May 27.—(P.1.P.)—
Courses offered at the University of
Oregon form the principal reason
! which students have for enrolling
hore, according to a survey recently
completed by Hush Biggs, research
! assistant to President Arnold Ben
j nett Hall.
Out of the 690 freshmen who en
| tered the questionnaire, R95 stated
j that they came to the University of
. Oregon because they believed certain
courses offered here to be superior,
that certain faculty members were
superior, or that certain of the profes
sional schools excelled those of other
institutions. The geographical loca
tion of the University of Oregon, the
j influence of alumni, relatives, or
friends, and financial considerations
| were other reasons given for the at-
I tendance of some students.
