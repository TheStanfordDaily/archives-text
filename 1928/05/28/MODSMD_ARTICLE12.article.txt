# Search For Italia With Crew Of 16 Begun By Eskimo
## Polar Wastes Silent Since Message From Ship Friday Morning 
### 
KING'S BAY, May 28. — (Monday)
— (U.P.) —All man's mechanical de
vices having thus far failed, search
j for the transpolar dirigible Italian and
her crew of sixteen, including General
Umberto Nobile, turned today to the
: primitive methods of the Northland.
Sometime today a Norseman named
Moy, familiar with the hardships of
h<s native land and sea, is to set out
ihy dog-sled from Bidge Bay in an
effort to reach the spot where the
Italia was last heard from nearly
' three days ago.
No word has been received from
j the Italia since Friday morning, and
j men familiar with the ship, who were
| left behind here with the Italia's base,
are now inclined to believe that it
| was wrecked or forced down —or both
J —immediately after sending that last
j message.
The last message described a ter
rific storm which was forcing the
Ttalia to head into the Polar wastes
i after it had come to within a com
paratively short distance of Spitzber
j gen, the base to which it was headed
after circling the North Pole so
| gloriously.
