### 
EUGENE, Ore., May 27.— (P.I.P.)—
The continuous rivalry existing be
tween the lawyers and the journalists
on the University of Oregon campus
was settled temporarily Wednesday
when the lawyer baseball team
trounced the scribes 10-0. At the be
ginning of the contest Dean Carpen
ter of the law school struck out Pro
fessor Turnbull of the school of jour
nalism. The journalists promptly
challenged the barristers to a track
meet, but that has not yet material
ized.
