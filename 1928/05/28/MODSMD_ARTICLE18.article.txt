# VARIETY OF LITERARY GEMS INCLUDED AMONG CLASS DESK CARVINGS
## Inscriptions Seem Conceived Out of Infinite Space Or Perfect Vacuum 
### Ethel Palmateer 
Many and varied are the literary
gems inscribed on classroom furni
ture by students who might otherwise
disturb the general peace by emitting
various nasal or guttural sounds from
their olfactory appendages.
Some inscriptions seem merely to
have been conceived out of infinite
space, or perhaps vacuum would be a
more appropriate word. These idle
sayings, such as "OKMNX from con
tented pigs" and the more unique
"Cream from contented creamatories"
are doubtless the work of a brain be
numbed by World War history or
English "comp."

Other phrases almost seem to have
been inspired by some thought. For
instance, "Les givup," carved in faint,
wobbly letters, might be the expres
sion of real despair on the part of
some baffled knowledge seeker.
"Nobody loves me" was the prevail
ing sentiment on one desk, and "Non
interference" was also written there
on. It may be that the disconsolate
writer believed that a policy of non
interference might be more favorable
to his amorous ventures.

Along the same line was the cyni
cal expression written in French,
which translated means "Man is born
free, but now he finds himself in
chains." Coupled with this pessimis
tic slogan was the word "Sally" writ
ten with the same variety of ink.
Could it be that Sally had applied the
lamented chains? Such topics indeed
form interesting food for speculation.
One desk, evidently occupied by
some ambitious soul, had the word
"Thoughts" carefully carved upon its
surface, and underneath this word
was space to neatly tabulate the
"thoughts." However, these had evi
dently not been forthcoming, and
space was all there was. i
