# POWERFUL STANFORD TRACK TEAM RETAINS I.C.A.A.A.A CHAMPIONSHIP
## Eric Krenz, Ross Nichols, Take Three Titles As King Recaptures High Jump Crown; Spencer Finishes Second In 440 
### ROBERT SPEERS 
YTATIONAL champions again! That is the sweet music ringing in the ears
of Dink Templeton's Cardinals who splashed their way to an impressive
victory in the 1.C.4-A.'s at Harvard Saturday.
Piling up the higgest margin made by a victorious team in thirteen years,
the Cards garnered 43 points, while Yale, the Eastern threat, made 25 1-3.
Cornell and Penn State tied for third with 16 points apiece.
Sheets of rain and a slimy track made Stanford's victory all the more
outstanding. Absolutely unused to competing under such conditions, Temple
ton's men would, it seemed, have a tough struggle to succeed against the
experienced mudsters of other schools.
But with Stanford's sensational sophomore weight-man, Eric Krenz, in
the van, the Cards lived up to every expectation for an impressive Western
triumph. Krenz shared honors with the Syracuse star, Ray Barbuti, for
high-point honors of the day. Eric clinched first in the discus and the shot
with record-breaking tosses in the preliminaries Friday; Barbuti wrote his
<s>name in big letters when he nosed

out Stanford's captain in a thrilling
quarter-mile battle, and a little later
came home first in the 220.
Nichols Is Winner
Another feature of the day was
Ross Nichols' victory in the high
sticks. Stanford's captain-elect was
considered doomed when Jupiter
Pluvius commenced making himself
conspicuous, but the fleet Card per
formed as if a sloppy track were on
his daily menu, neatly defeating the
Eastern favorite, Collier, or Brown.
Bob King, one-time national high
jump champ, regained his crown, and
defeated his rival, Maynard ,of Dart
mouth, who copped the title last year.
Harlow Rothert, another of Temple
ton's sophomore prodigies, came
through nicely by picking up a second
in the shot, while his teammate, For
ster, took a fifth in the same event.

Edmonds Ties for Third

The Card spearmen, Kibby and
Sparling, were responsible for some
valuable points when they got a third
and a fourth in the javelin. Dyer and
Zombro were second and third respec
tively in the broad jump, and Ward
Edmonds, plucky Stanford vaulter,
tied for third with two others in his
event. Sabin Carr, Yale star, won, and
Lee Barnes, of U.S.C., was second.
Captain Bud Spencer lost a game
fight for first in the quarter when he
lead the field for lamost the entire
distance, only to be passed by Barbuti
thirty yards from the tape. Spence
wasn't at his best in the mud, while
his heavy-set rival plowed through
with no trouble at all. Johnny Mor
rison, after winning a special qualify
ing heat yesterday, drew the ninth
lane and couldn't land in the money.
Coe Is Defeated
Hank Coe, Stanford's eight-lap ace,
failed to place under the handicap of
mud end a crowded field. He came in
seventh, ten yards behind the fifth
man.

Nichols Is Winner
Another feature of the day was
Ross Nichols' victory in the high
sticks. Stanford's captain-elect was
considered doomed when Jupiter
Pluvius commenced making himself
conspicuous, but the fleet Card per
formed as if a sloppy track were on
his daily menu, neatly defeating the
Eastern favorite, Collier, or Brown.
Bob King, one-time national high

defeated his rival, Maynard ,of Dart

Harlow Rothert, another of Temple
ton's sophomore prodigies, came
through nicely by picking up a second
in the shot, while his teammate, For

Edmonds Ties for Third

The Card spearmen, Kibby and
Sparling, were responsible for some
valuable points when they got a third
and a fourth in the javelin. Dyer and
Zombro were second and third respec
tively in the broad jump, and Ward
Edmonds, plucky Stanford vaulter,
tied for third with two others in his
event. Sabin Carr, Yale star, won, and
Lee Barnes, of U.S.C., was second.
Captain Bud Spencer lost a game
fight for first in the quarter when he
lead the field for lamost the entire

Coe Is Defeated
Hank Coe, Stanford's eight-lap ace,
failed to place under the handicap of

YTATIONAL champions again! That is the sweet music ringing in the ears
of Dink Templeton's Cardinals who splashed their way to an impressive

Piling up the higgest margin made by a victorious team in thirteen years,
the Cards garnered 43 points, while Yale, the Eastern threat, made 25 1-3.
Cornell and Penn State tied for third with 16 points apiece.
Sheets of rain and a slimy track made Stanford's victory all the more

experienced mudsters of other schools.
But with Stanford's sensational sophomore weight-man, Eric Krenz, in
the van, the Cards lived up to every expectation for an impressive Western
triumph. Krenz shared honors with the Syracuse star, Ray Barbuti, for
high-point honors of the day. Eric clinched first in the discus and the shot

YTATIONAL champions again! That is the sweet music ringing in the ears
of Dink Templeton's Cardinals who splashed their way to an impressive
victory in the 1.C.4-A.'s at Harvard Saturday.
Piling up the higgest margin made by a victorious team in thirteen years,
the Cards garnered 43 points, while Yale, the Eastern threat, made 25 1-3.
Cornell and Penn State tied for third with 16 points apiece.
Sheets of rain and a slimy track made Stanford's victory all the more
outstanding. Absolutely unused to competing under such conditions, Temple
ton's men would, it seemed, have a tough struggle to succeed against the
experienced mudsters of other schools.
But with Stanford's sensational sophomore weight-man, Eric Krenz, in
the van, the Cards lived up to every expectation for an impressive Western
triumph. Krenz shared honors with the Syracuse star, Ray Barbuti, for
high-point honors of the day. Eric clinched first in the discus and the shot
with record-breaking tosses in the preliminaries Friday; Barbuti wrote his
<s>name in big letters when he nosed

out Stanford's captain in a thrilling
quarter-mile battle, and a little later
came home first in the 220.
Nichols Is Winner
Another feature of the day was
Ross Nichols' victory in the high
sticks. Stanford's captain-elect was
considered doomed when Jupiter
Pluvius commenced making himself
conspicuous, but the fleet Card per
formed as if a sloppy track were on
his daily menu, neatly defeating the
Eastern favorite, Collier, or Brown.
Bob King, one-time national high
jump champ, regained his crown, and
defeated his rival, Maynard ,of Dart
mouth, who copped the title last year.
Harlow Rothert, another of Temple
ton's sophomore prodigies, came
through nicely by picking up a second
in the shot, while his teammate, For
ster, took a fifth in the same event.

Edmonds Ties for Third

The Card spearmen, Kibby and
Sparling, were responsible for some
valuable points when they got a third
and a fourth in the javelin. Dyer and
Zombro were second and third respec

Edmonds, plucky Stanford vaulter,
