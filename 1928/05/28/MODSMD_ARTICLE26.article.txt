# Here's An Idea

Stanford needs a new theatre. That's a point that doesn't require
arbitration. But the ways and means don't seem to be available or
forthcoming. Now football teams have earned money and built a
stadium, kept other sports going financially, helped to build dormitories
and physical education buildings. Except for one reason, the Dramatic
Council itself could construct its own theatre. This reason is that campus
productions may be played only at Stanford.
Recently an editorial in this column pointed out th.e advantages of
having some of the best plays taken to nearby cities purely for the benefit
of the student players and Stanford. Now, we bring this up as a good
business proposition to give the campus a decent place in which to
produce plays. .
'i he main expenses of these shows come in the items of stage sets,
electrical apparatus, costumes, royalties for the book, and salaries for
the director, property people, and stage and electrical assistants, with
the sets usually constituting the largest single item. Most of these things
are just as great for one. production as they would be for four or five.
The salaries would have to be increased slightly for extra performances,
and there would be the matters of renting a playhouse, transporting sets
and cast, and sometimes, extra costume rental.
But these small increases in expense would not begin to eat up the
extra money that would be made by the additional performances. And
there would be money taken in. Stanford dramatics have a splendid
reputation, not only on the Peninsula, but all over the Coast and through
out amateur dramatic circles. There are plenty of people in San Fran
cisco, Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose, Fresno, and many other towns easily
accessible, who would be glad to see Stanford plays, as well as to see
popular plays adequately presented, as for the purely sentimental reason
that they are interested in Stanford.
Such a plan would kill three birds with one stone; it would be
invaluable experience for the students in dramatics, it would show
people outside of Stanford that the University is interested in things
other than athletics, and, above all, it would go at least a long way
toward building a new theatre.
