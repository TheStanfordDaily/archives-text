# Cacophonous Cacklings
## 
### 
The Board of Athletic Control finally scraped together enough money
for a system of loudspeakers to be installed in the Stadium. Organized
public opinion, in the form, chiefly, of the San Francisco Chroniclc, has
for several years been urging that the electric megaphones be provided.
People want to know, they say, who carried the ball, how many yards he
gained, who was hurt, and all the sidelights, including reports of the
weather, which we are accustomed to learn from the radio broadcasts
of football games.
Probably 110 great huzzas will go up from the Stanford student body
at the announcement that we are to have Cacophones (which is not, but
ought to be, their name). Our eyes are good and our interest in the play
such that we like the mental exercise of figuring out the plays and
determining who are the players, without listening to a crackling voice
drawl about action which has long since transpired. However, as was
long ago discovered, football games aren't staged for our benefit, but
for that of the alumni and the general public. Since the latter groups
have clamored for the cacophones, we shall have to resign ourselves and
pray that the announcer at least won't be garrulous.
