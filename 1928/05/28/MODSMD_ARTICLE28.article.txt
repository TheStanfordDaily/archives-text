True to expectation, Dink Templeton's, not to say Stanford's,
1.C.4-A. track squad crashed through with better than the forty points,
winning the meet by plenty of margin and with some mighty fine show
ings. This clearly proved our prediction that Stanford has the best
college aggregation of trackmen in the country. We hate to be boasting
in this way, but we are glad we can so heartily congratulate the team.
Probably the honors cannot be split up among the members of the
squad, but if they can, Eric Krenz, who put up two new records, shot
and discus, leads the list, and he's a sophomore at that. Another sopho
more who deserves a little special note is I larlow Rothert, who has made
about the greatest strides in shot-putting that has been seen here in some
time. I'ecause of the wet track, Captain Spencer was not able to come
through with that record it was thought he might make, but that was
just a tough break, and he's still got a good chance.
Why should we call ourselves men, unless it be to succeed in everything,
everywhere? Say of nothing, "This is beneath me," nor feel that everything
is beyond our powers. Nothing is impossible to the' man who can will,
t—MIRABEAU.
One fact stands out in bold relief in the history of men's attempts for
betterment. That is that when compulsion is used, only resentment is
aroused, and in the end is not gained. Only through moral suasion and
appeal to men's reason can a movement succeed. —SAMUEL GOMPEItS.
All women members of the Daily staff will meet at 1 o'clock today
in the office.
