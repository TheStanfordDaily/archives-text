"Red Rust," Cornelia James Cannon.'
Little, Brtfwn & Co.
"Reeds and Mud," Vincente Blasco
Ibanez. E. P. Dutton & Co.
Not a Window Display
This is a story of Matt Swenson,
j Minnesota farmer, and his struggles
: with the period immediately after the
j first pioneers. It is one of these novels
where the characters struggle amaz- ;
ingly with the elements of nature,
but in spite of the subject matter —
which in the last two or three years
the American public has become ex
posed too far too often —beautifully
done. No unusual emphasis is placed
on the psychological aspects of these
farmers, and we find this a very good
thing. We personally are very tired
! of hearing of Swedes, interpreted by
' authors who have never been nearer
a ranch than the window displays of
baby chicks at Easter Time.
There is a prevalent convention of
thought today in regard to the meth
od of novel-writing—to-wit, that the
triangle situation is always the most
j popular, and the most personal and
the most interesting. Mrs. Cannon, in -
"Red Rust," refutes by illustration j
this fallacy. She has used all the
tools of narrative — love, hunger,
struggle with elements, jealousy,
hate, and so on —but has gone be
yond them. The dreams of man are
I fairly universal, and differ but little |
with temperament. Novels about
dreams are too often metaphysical
and hystericcaly mystical, but "Red (
Rust" deserves its present popularity, j
not only from technical angles, but i
for the personality of the book.
Although "Reeds and Mud" is one
of the earlier Ibanez novels, written
before he reached his phenomenal no
toriety with the "Four Horsemen,"
this is the first American translation.
An Ibanez book at its best is so far
above most of our American emotion
al sandwiches that it is not surpris
ing this translation is listed as the
Dutton book of the month.
"Reeds and Mud" concerns itself
with a group of peasants in a pictur
i esque Spanish fishing village in the i
i seaside marsh country near Valencia. !
Its chief significance is in the inter
| pretation of the desperate existence
| of these almost primitive people—an
existence in which the ordinary emo
tions of living are too apt to be
merely distracting nuisances from
the mere gathering of food.
Not Swaggering Romance
There is not the swaggering ro
j mance to these characters that, from
j the influence of the movies, we. gen
| erally expect from an Ibanez novel,
j The people here are the Wallace
j Beery-Emil Jannings types. The loves
! here are none of your chivalric Pro
vencal affairs, with guitars and moon
! light. If there is any moonlight in the
| pages of this book, the stench of
I decaying eels is strong enough to
draw your attention from such light
things; and if there is any music, it.
I is because the fishermen are carous
ing on liquor much stronger than
f French wine.
The climax is one of the strongest
but most horrible we have encoun
j tered in any reading, in mood with
| the animal, almost-bestial tone of the
, story. "Reeds and Mud" is not a civi
i lized novel. It is the superstitious,
cruel story of the early ballads. Only
j —told by a master of prose.
—Hallie Keating.

"Red Rust," refutes by illustration j
this fallacy. She has used all the

not only from technical angles, but i
for the personality of the book.

"Reeds and Mud" concerns itself
with a group of peasants in a pictur

Its chief significance is in the inter

existence in which the ordinary emo

merely distracting nuisances from
the mere gathering of food.

This is a story of Matt Swenson,

where the characters struggle amaz- ;
ingly with the elements of nature,

which in the last two or three years
the American public has become ex
posed too far too often —beautifully
done. No unusual emphasis is placed
on the psychological aspects of these
farmers, and we find this a very good
thing. We personally are very tired

' authors who have never been nearer
a ranch than the window displays of
baby chicks at Easter Time.
