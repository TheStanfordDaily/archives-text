# Davis Returns To Stanford; Praises Drama In Europe
## Feels Universities Can Supply Equivalent of Foreign State Theatres 
### 
"University dramatics can do a
great deal to approximate the cul
tural value the people in Europe get
out of their state theatres," says Gor
don Davis, director of dramatics at
Stanford, who has just returned to
the campus after traveling abroad
since October.
Davis says he found the difference
in attitude toward the drama here
and in Europe very significant. "The
theatre is a very vital thing in the
lives of the people over there, par
ticularly in central Europe. The re
spect they accord the drama is tre
mendous, and they go to hear the
classics — Shakespeare, Schiller,
Goethe —as we would go to the
movies. It is something they live by."
Have State Theatres
An expression of this is found in
the fact that they have state theatres,
supported like state universities, and
regarded as just as important, says
Davis. "I wish we had the same thing
here, and I feel that the time is com
ing when we will have. The nearest
we can come to it now is in the
university theatres, which can be
come the same sort of beacons in the
commercial field."
Gordon Davis found interest and
progress in the drama at its height in
central Europe, in Germany, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, and Austria. "They
are extremely alert for the modern,
experimental things, and particularly
in Germany the theatre has never
been so free from convention. Every
thing is being given a try, though
the radical expressionism that pre
vailed for awhile is settling down to
something more solid."
New York Leads
America is taking her place too, in
drama. "New York is the theatre cen
ter of today because of our money.
The standard of taste is raising stead
ily, and New York is drawing the
best from England, France, Russia,
and Germany. The effect of this
in making our stage more cosmopoli
tan is splendid for us." On the other
hand, the European writers are low
ering their own standards by keeping
an eye on Broadway, Davis says,
quoting a renowned Hungarian critic.
