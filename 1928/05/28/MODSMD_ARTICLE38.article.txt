# SPORTS OF 1928
## Tennis Alphabetâ€”C 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"C" who's here! There are "C's"
aplenty for this alphabet of tennis
stars from the veteran Mrs. Lambert
Chambers of England down to 16-
; year-old "Junior" Coen, of Kansas
j City, who is figuring in this year's
, Davis Cup play in the American zone.
; And before passing on let me say here
: that Mrs. Lambert Chambers has one
i of the most reanarkable records of
! any woman in tennis. As Dorothea
Douglas, she made her debut at Wim
! bledon, winning the championship the
j following year. In 1925, after win
ning the British title seven times
(one more than Suzanne) she came
! to America as manager of the British
I Wightman cup team, still able to play
J good tournament tennis.
i
j Henri Cochet of France is the most
! famous "C" player. As one of the
"Four Musketeers" of France, he
helped win the Davis Cup from the
i United States at Philadelphia last
| September, and at Wimbledon ear
lier in the year defeated Big Bill
] Tilden after the American had won
' the first two sets and had a command
ing lead in the third. And it was this
1 same Cochet who a year earlier at
Forest Hills prevented Tilden from
winning his seventh National cham
| pionship.
The Chapins are the highest rank
as both A1 and his wife, the former
| Charlotte Hosmer of San Francisco,
; are veterans of many big tournaments
and have won numerous champion
| ships separately and as a mixed
doubles team together. J. Crawford
| is the yoOng Australian who defeated
both Borotra and Brugnon when those
famous Frenchmen were playing
: "down under" not so long ago. "Bud"
i Chandler twice won the Intercolle-
I giate title while a student at the Uni-
I versity of He is looked

upon as a promising Davis Cup player
of the future.
O. S. Campbell won the U.S. singles
title in 1890, '91, and '92, and William
J. Clothier in 1906, while Miss Mabel
Cahill wa,s women's champion in 1891
and *92.
"By the C by the C, by the beauti
ful C!"
