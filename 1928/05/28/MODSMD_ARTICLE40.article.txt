be priced at $3.50 for students, and
$5 for adult admission for the five

fore Thursday, and it is planned to
sell them on this day only. A drive
will be made to sell out the entire
Pavilion, and on this day canvasses I
will be made of all the living groups J
on the campus. . j
Because of the high quality of con- j
cert artists available to the West next ;
season, it is felt the coming series j
will be the most popular and success- j
ful yet to be given here. This will be j
the third year in which the Stanford
student body has sponsored the con
cert series.
Lawrence Tibbett, baritone, will |
give the first, concert, appearing here
the last week in October. The next j
program will be given in November, :
by Sousa and his Band. Efrem Zim- j
balist, violinist, will give a recital in 1
January, and will be followed later ,
in the quarter by Margarete Matzen- |
auer, soprano. In the spring the final '
concert will be given by Alfred ;
Hertz's San Francisco Symphony.
