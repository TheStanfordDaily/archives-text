# MASTERS CONTRACTS FOR PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM IN STADIUM
## 
### 
Stanford, first of the universities in
central California to make a move for
the betterment of conditions as far
as the spectators are concerned, will
| install the Public Address System in
| the Stanford Stadium at a cost of
: $21,000.
A contract was signed Friday by
' A1 Masters, graduate manager, and a
I representative of the Western Elec
! trie Company, under the terms of
; which the Public Address System will
be installed in time for the first foot
ball game of the season between
Stanford and Army of Presidio on
Saturday, September 22.
Backed by Alumni
i The Stanford Club of Oakland and
! similar organizations indorsed this
I movement, arguing that not only
] would it add to the pleasure of the
; spectators but would increase sports
! interest in general.
At present there are similar ad
dress systems installed in the Coli
seum at Los Angeles and in the Uni
j versity of Washington stadium at
Seattle. The system is arranged with
; a series of wires running from the
: main control station, which will be
' located in a booth at the Stanford
Stadium directly opposite the booth
I occupied by KPO.
Twelve Horns To Be Used
At one end of the Stadium, twelve
' horns will be provided, each working
at a slightly different angle, so the
entire stadium can be reached. By
means of electrical current the voice
of the announcer, who will follow the
football game or track meet in detail,
will be carried through the horns and
j to the audience.
Work of the survey by the contract
ing company will commence at once.
That portion of the construction will
! take probably two months, after
which the installation proper will
! start.
