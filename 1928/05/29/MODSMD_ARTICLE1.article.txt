# THREE NATIONS SEEK ITALIA IN POLAR REGION
## Airplanes, Dog Teams, Ships Co-operate in Search For Lost Fliers Nobile's Auxiliary Vessel Tries to Break Way Into Ice Field 
### 
OSLO, May 28— (U.P.)— Expedi
tions by air, water, and land to search
for General Umberto Nobile and the
dirigible Italia were under way to
night by three governments and
orders had been sent by radio to
wireless stations and ships through
out the North to lend aid.
Lieutenant Luetzow Holm, Norwe
gian flyer, left for Tromsoe with a
naval plane to board the sturdy ice
ship Hobby for the waters about
North Spitzbergen where reconnai
sance flights will be made.
The Italian government was rush
ing plans for a relief expedition and
Russia announced readiness to send
ships or planes over the Arctic
wastes to search for the flyers, now
nearly six days out from Kings Bay.
Eskimos and dog sleds under com
mand of a Norwegian huntsman
named Moy will search the ice to 31
degrees northern latitude and swing
in wide circles in a hunt which is
believed more full of promise than
that by air or water. Moy has lived
long in the northern wastes and is
said to be capable of great speed and
endurance.
TROMSOE, Norway, May 28. —
(U.P.) —A sealing ship operating west
of Franz Josef land heard very weak
signals for help believed to have been
from the dirigible Italia, according to
a report received here tonight.
Like other rumors reporting con
nection with the Italia, the report
was wholly without confirmation.
CORDOVA, Alaska, May 28— (U.P.)

ship, the Citti di Milan, was north of
the Bering Cape in its search for the
missing dirigible Italia at 4:25 P.M.
(Pacific Coast Time) today, according
to a message from the vessel inter
cepted here.
"We are trying to open up a pas
sageway toward the east," the mes
sage said. "We have encountered end
less blocks of ice and snow."
The position of the Citti di Milan at
that time was about 30 degrees lati
tude north, the operator said.
WASHINGTON, May 28.—( U.P.) —
Although navy officials have been
considering the advisability of send
ing the dirigible Los Angeles to aid
in the search for General Nobile's
missing Palia, Secretary of Navy
Wilbur said today it was unlikely the
airship would be utilized in the search
as it would be too hazardous.

nearly six days out from Kings Bay.
Eskimos and dog sleds under com
mand of a Norwegian huntsman
named Moy will search the ice to 31
degrees northern latitude and swing
in wide circles in a hunt which is
believed more full of promise than
that by air or water. Moy has lived
long in the northern wastes and is
said to be capable of great speed and
endurance.
