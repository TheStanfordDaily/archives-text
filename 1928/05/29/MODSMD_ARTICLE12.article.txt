# CONGRESS TUESDAY ADJOURNMENT PLAN HALTED BY SENATE
## DAWES FOILS TIE VOTE Senator Johnson Has Hope Of Stopping Filibuster By Holding Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON. D.C., May 28. —
(U.P.) —Plans of Congressional leaders 1
for a final adjournment of the present!
I session Tuesday night at 5 o'clock were!
completely upset today when the Senate!
refused to concur in this program, pre
viously accepted by the House.
The opposition was led by those back
ing the Boulder Dam bill with support
from friends of other legislation which
would be lost in an early adjournment.
The Senate vote on adjournment Tuesday
was a tie and Vice-President Dawes cast i
the deciding vote against adjournment.
Republican Leader Curtis and Democratic
Leader Robinson both voted for adjourn
ment.
This action was a defeat for those fili
bustering against the Boulder Dam bill.!
They had been confident of being able to j
prevent a vote on it by talking until!
Tuesday night but with adjournment plans j
left indefinite they are in danger of being j
put to an exhaustive endurance test.
Senators Retain Hope
Senate 'leaders have not completely
given up hope of later persuading the
Senate to adjourn Tuesday. Conferences
went on during the afternoon. Although j
it was necessary only to get one vote
switched to force adjournment, the Senate
leaders found that a difficult task. Once 1
they got the necessary switch but at the i
same time a Democratic senator who had (
voted with them deserted to the other
side leaving the tie as it was before.
Senator Johnson plans to hold the Sen
ate in continuous session as long as he
can to wear down the filibuster against
his Boulder Dam bill. Leaders hoped that j
after an all-night session tonight the sena-!
tors might be more anxious to quit Tues- j
day night.
Meanwhile, the House, having complet-!
Ed its legislative program, is waiting <
around for the Senate to quit. Neither j
house can adjourn without the other.
