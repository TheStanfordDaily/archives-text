# To Start Drive This Week For Concert Series
## Will Canvass on Thursday To Secure Pledges of Ticket Purchases 
### 
A canvass will be made Thursday
of all eating and living groups in a
drive to secure pledges for. season
tickets to next year's A.S.S.U. concert
series. Since the West Coast, and
particularly San Francisco, is known
as a music center, an unusual selec
tion of arts is available, and the pro
gram for next season promises to be
the most popular of the three given
thus far.
Lawrence Tibbett, baritone, heads
the list, and will appear here the last
part of October. Tibbett is a native
Californian, and is hailed as one of
the few artists .of the first rank who
have received all their vocal training
in this country. One of his most suc
cessful roles was in the revival of
"Falstaff" at the Metropolitan Opera
House in New York, when he was
given a wildly enthusiastic ovation.
Sousa and his Band will give the
Becond concert at Stanford, in No
vember. John Philip Sousa has been
director of his world-famous band
since 1892, and has received decora
tions of honor in various European
countries. His band has made several
world tours, as well as frequent tours
of Europe where he is as popular as
in this country.
The last three concerts, two of
which will be given in winter quarter
and the final one next spring, will be
by Efrem Zimbalist, violinist of na
tfonal repute, the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, and Margarete Mat
zenauer, Hungarian soprano, who has
won world fame.
Tickets for students, members of
the faculty and University employees
will be $3.50, and those for the gen
eral public $5. No sale of tickets will
be made before Thursday.
