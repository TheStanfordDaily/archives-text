FAIRBANKS, Alaska, May 28. —
(U.P.) — Elngine trouble developed
after Noel Wien and four companions
left Wiseman in two airplanes two
weeks ago Sunday, according to first
word of the missing airmen that came
out of the bleak Northland today.
The two pilots and their three pas
sengers were seen by a prospector
who was on the north fork of the
Koyukuk river when they started the
perilous part of their trip from Wise
man to Point Barrow across the
Brooks range of mountains.
The motor of Wien's plane was ap
parently missing and his ship was
barely skimming the tops of the high
peaks, the prospector reported. The
other craft, piloted by R. H. Merrill,
was flying much higher at the time.
The prospector walked from the
river to Wiseman and his message
was brought here by Ed Young, an
aviator.
