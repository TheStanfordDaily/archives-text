# LARGE SUM GIVEN TO RYAN LABORATORY FOR HIGH VOLTAGE TESTS
## 
### 
During the past year from $20,000
to $30,000 has been given to the Ryan
High Voltage Laboratory for the pur
chase of test specimens and for fa
cilitation of their mounting. With
operation proceeding upon such a
large scale as that used in the labora
tory, a knowledge and understanding
of the apparatus and its working has
occupied a great deal of time.
Among the teat specimens received
at the Ryan laboratory are stranded
copper conductors, constructed with
diameters of 1 1-10 inches, 2 inches
and 4 inches for studies of losses oc
curring in the 220,000, 440,000, and
880,000 voltage groups respectively.
The 4-inch conductors are made of
aluminum only due to the great
weight that the use of copper would
occasion. Specially constructed copper
conductors have been presented by
the Anaconda Copper Company and
corresponding conductors will be re
ceived from the Aluminum Company
of America in the near future.
