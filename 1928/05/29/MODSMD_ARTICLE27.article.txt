# Old Problemâ€”New Method
## 
### 
For some years it has been pretty generally recognized that the system
of electing the Editor of The Stanford Daily was at fault. The process
was like this: about a month before an election was to take place, those
interested started interviewing all and sundry on the staff to see how the
land lay, then someone would promise a fat job to someone else if he'd
act as political manager, then the whole thing went down the line in a
fine apple-polishing and vote-getting campaign.
On the day the staff voted (a weighted system of votes was used on
the basis of length of service), it was necessary for a man to get one
third of the votes to be nominated, and if one man got more than two
thirds, he was automatically elected. But in case more than one got a third,
those men were nominated and the candidates put on Student Body ballots
for a Quad election.
Now the faults of this method were these: in the first place, the Student
Body as a whole admittedly does not know who the best man is, and his
election in case of a Quad vote is apt to depend largely on politics; in the
second place, the spoils system involved was most detrimental to the peace
of mind of the staff members, disrupted work on the paper to a very large
degree, and decreased the efficiency of those intending to run for office,
besides making it possible for men not so competent to get positions to
which they were not entitled; thirdly, it could be mentioned that staff
members who had not been on long enough to vote intelligently might swing
the election because of political string-pulling.
During the past some months the Daily editors and Publications
Council have been trying to work out some plan to eliminate as many of
these difficulties as possible. To do this many compromises had to be
made, but it is thought that the plan adopted by Publications Council yes
terday, which is in effect unless the Executive Committee disapproves the
by-law, will obviate most of the objectionable features of the past system.
In order to cut out the political pot-boiling, and the spoils system, it
has been provided that an Editorial Board, consisting of the Women's
Editor, the Managing Editor, and the Associate Editors, acting with the
Editor, will make all appointments for the ensuing term, before the Editor
himself is elected. This will automatically make it nearly impossible for
a probable candidate to promise jobs.
Then, as to the Editor's election, the nominating will be done by the
Board and the present Editor at the same time the appointments are made.
After nominations, the names of the candidates will be listed for the staff
to ponder for a week, at the end of which time all members who have been
in service for three full quarters will vote (those having six quarters' serv
ice have two votes) on the candidates. In case of a deadlock on the staff
(more than one man getting a third of the votes), the decision will go to
the Publications Council (instead of the Student Body) on the same day
as the staff election.
This plan takes the last appeal away from the Quad vote, reduces the
political pan-handling to as great an extent as appears at this time possible,
and insures a more equitable appointment to the higher offices.
There are a few other minor provisions to safeguard both the Editor
and the staff: one is to the effect that the staff itself may nominate by
signing a petition and presenting it to the Election Board, and another is
that the Editor shall have complete control of the staff while in office,
except that he may not appoint more than four members of the Editorial
Board, unless Publications Council approves.

to ponder for a week, at the end of which time all members who have been
in service for three full quarters will vote (those having six quarters' serv
ice have two votes) on the candidates. In case of a deadlock on the staff
(more than one man getting a third of the votes), the decision will go to
the Publications Council (instead of the Student Body) on the same day
as the staff election.
This plan takes the last appeal away from the Quad vote, reduces the
political pan-handling to as great an extent as appears at this time possible,
and insures a more equitable appointment to the higher offices.
There are a few other minor provisions to safeguard both the Editor
and the staff: one is to the effect that the staff itself may nominate by
signing a petition and presenting it to the Election Board, and another is
that the Editor shall have complete control of the staff while in office,
except that he may not appoint more than four members of the Editorial
Board, unless Publications Council approves.
For some years it has been pretty generally recognized that the system
of electing the Editor of The Stanford Daily was at fault. The process
was like this: about a month before an election was to take place, those
interested started interviewing all and sundry on the staff to see how the
land lay, then someone would promise a fat job to someone else if he'd
act as political manager, then the whole thing went down the line in a
fine apple-polishing and vote-getting campaign.
On the day the staff voted (a weighted system of votes was used on
the basis of length of service), it was necessary for a man to get one
third of the votes to be nominated, and if one man got more than two
thirds, he was automatically elected. But in case more than one got a third,
those men were nominated and the candidates put on Student Body ballots
for a Quad election.
Now the faults of this method were these: in the first place, the Student
Body as a whole admittedly does not know who the best man is, and his
election in case of a Quad vote is apt to depend largely on politics; in the
second place, the spoils system involved was most detrimental to the peace
of mind of the staff members, disrupted work on the paper to a very large
degree, and decreased the efficiency of those intending to run for office,
besides making it possible for men not so competent to get positions to
which they were not entitled; thirdly, it could be mentioned that staff
members who had not been on long enough to vote intelligently might swing
the election because of political string-pulling.
During the past some months the Daily editors and Publications
Council have been trying to work out some plan to eliminate as many of
these difficulties as possible. To do this many compromises had to be
made, but it is thought that the plan adopted by Publications Council yes
terday, which is in effect unless the Executive Committee disapproves the
by-law, will obviate most of the objectionable features of the past system.
In order to cut out the political pot-boiling, and the spoils system, it
has been provided that an Editorial Board, consisting of the Women's
Editor, the Managing Editor, and the Associate Editors, acting with the
Editor, will make all appointments for the ensuing term, before the Editor
himself is elected. This will automatically make it nearly impossible for
a probable candidate to promise jobs.
Then, as to the Editor's election, the nominating will be done by the
Board and the present Editor at the same time the appointments are made.
After nominations, the names of the candidates will be listed for the staff
to ponder for a week, at the end of which time all members who have been
in service for three full quarters will vote (those having six quarters' serv
ice have two votes) on the candidates. In case of a deadlock on the staff
