# The 						Righteous and Obscene
## 
### 
All diligent readers of this editorial column (and we trust you are all
—all diligent readers) may remember the case of David Gordon, who was
tried in New York on the charge of obscenity because he published an
article denouncing America, and who was sentenced to three years in jail
for the offense. Well, the lad has been given leniency by the Parole Board,
and will serve only thirty-five days of this sentence.
Three years in prison just because he did not like some of the Ameri
can institutions, and said so in terms which did not sit well on many minds,
was an incredulously stiff sentence. Ifeywood Broun, in The Nation, was
the first to point out the poor taste of the judges, and then the battle was
taken up by the New York World and carried to a victorious finish—
victorious for the proponents of freedom of expression and the opponents
of bigoted censorship. Broun and the World are to be congratulated on
their work.
In commenting upon the use of "obscene" language, Broun has a few
remarks that are quite to the point. lie observes: .. . the high-minded
citizen who wrote to the World used a phrase meaning exactly the same
thing as that employed by the I>oy who went to jail, but the righteous man
will not be indicted for obscenity. As it happens he chose his word a shade
more carcfully and picked for his qualifier an expression which has grown
a trifle archaic, or at least a little literary This is puzzling to me.
If one uses such dirty words as happen to l)e casual and common then he
is obscene and subject to the punishments prescribed by law, but artful folk
who can think up fancy names escape scot-free."
And there you are.

A SPECIAL meeting of the editorial staff will be held this afternoon
at 1 o'clock.
