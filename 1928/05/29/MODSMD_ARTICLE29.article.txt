HALF-KNIFE, HALF-WORK
This recent story in the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, copied from the
Christian Science Monitor, comes to
our attention as a significant illustra
tion of modern thought:
"Arbiters of table etiquette have
been asked to do something about
sanctioning the use of a knife for cut
ting iceberg lettuce, because the solid
crisp nature of this vegetable makes
it almost impossible to reduce to edi
ble proportions with the customary
fork provided for salads. The com
plaint comes largely from editors and
reporters, who, attending banquets
and important functions, have grown
tired of chasing iceberg lettuce
around the plate with forks and get
ting nowhere in the process. To make
matters worse, this variety usually is
served with a dressing of more or
less viscuous consistency which adds
to the elusiveness of the pursuit.
There are cases on record where a
gentleman has had the discomfiture
of chasing the lettuce off his plate
and into his lap, being forced, mean
while, to smile and remain perfectly
composed.
"The demand for a lettuce knife is
no unorganized one. J. T. Saunders,
of the Southern Pacific Company, who
handles vast quantities of iceberg
lettuce, is prepared to ask writers of
etiquette books that a special knife
be sanctioned, or forks, half-fork and
half-knife, be made to meet the emer
gency and thus save a budding and
prosperous industry from skidding
into the lap of obscurity."
Not a Capitalistic Move
This may seem at first another of
these capitalistic endeavors to pro
mote a special industry at the ex
pense of the public, or another evi
dence of the over-organization of the
United States. More, it may be an
other move of women's clothes manu
facturers, that they may keep on
selling perishable and not easily
cleaned fabrics.
But it seems to us an interesting
and, probably, sincere move on the
part of trained observers to remove
the ugly, awkward aspects of Ameri
can social life. For a long time we

have been following a certain code
of conventional etiquette, inherited
from the eighteenth century. This has
been particularly true in the province
of eating, and we have followed rules
that belonged to generations that had
no artichokes to eat, or had been
advertised to the value of sunkist
oranges. When new vegetables be
came popular, they were adapted to
the old code —no new rules were
made. Asparagus is a striking evi
dence of difficulties arising from this
situation.
Etiquette Adequate to Food
With the thousands of agricultural
and scientific colleges about, we have
prospects of still further complica
tions when innumerable new vege
tables are introduced to our tables.
So a move in the direction of making
etiquette adequate to food should be
greeted with cheers.
There is one serious difficulty in
this proposal for a new type of fork,
however. Must we look forward to our
future tables, set with an armory of
silver? Will there be forks to the
right of us, knives to the left of us,
spoons in front of us, labeled to be
distinguishable? Will we have to take
statistic courses in college to learn
the infinite variety of names? Will
our family training be sufficient to
teach us the delicate balancing and
use of this enormous number of im
plements?
Simplified Weapons
Seriously, though, the fact that
people are beginning to protest for
efficient tools for food ,is of a great
deal of significance. It is the result
of a nation trained to the use of the
! mechanical conveniences. If this move
were also in the direction of simplify
ing table weapons and their usage, it
would be of considerable economic
and sociological value. Consider the
amount of time spent in eating! —
