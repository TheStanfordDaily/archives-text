I "My Life," Isadora Duncan. Boni &
Liveright.
This amazing siory careens back
! and forth between the sublime and
j the ridiculous, now out-rivaling the
; most bizarr" of true-confession
stories, now skimming the heights of
earthly experience and wisdom.
"Virtuous people," says Isadora, the
eccentric, "are simply those who have
either not been tempted sufficiently,
i because they live in a vegetative
state, or because their purposes are
so concentrated in one direction that
they have not had the leisure to
glance around them." Isadora never
lacked for temptation, nor did she
live in a vegetative state, nor were
her purposes so concentrated that she
could not glance around.
Isadora the Rebel
From the very start Isadora was a
rebel against the commonplace inani
ties of life. While yet a mere child
she was thrown out of school for
loudly denying the Santa Claus
myth. "I don't believe lies," she pro
tested. In subsequent passages she
further indicts the public schools,
most of which criticism they well
enough merit.
The first part of the books chroni
cles the trying struggles of her child
hood and early youth. Audacity, cour
age, and boundless energy slowly, and
with many near-defeats, conquer pov
erty, and we find Isadora in England
on the eve of a career which was to
make her one of the outstanding
artists of this age and one of the most
talked-about women in the world.
Europe Hails Her
Europe was generous with its ap
plause for the revival of the Greek
dance, and the fame and wealth which
she so well merited came to Isadora.
Then came a procession of the most
prodigious and ardent love affairs
which serve mightily to enliven
things throughout the remainder of
the book.
Isadora loved with the true tem
peramental ardor and recklessness.
She did not believe in marriage; so
she had her children, all apparently
brilliant, beyond the bounds fixed by
convention. It is impossible to believe
that any conventionally married
mother could have loved her offspring
more than Isadora loved hers, nor
could any grief be more devastating
than that of Isadora's when her first
(wo children died in an accident and
when the third child died shortly
after birth.
We Admire Her
However doubtful we are of the
social values of Isadora's ideas on
love, marriage, and such, at this stage
of civilization, at least, we cannot
but admire her for the courage with
which she carried out her convictions.

Living above convention is one tiling
to talk about and another thing to do.
But we can't quite forgive her for
some of her promiscuity.
Overlooking numerous contradic
tions, some strange reasoning, and
various other imperfections, we find
"My Life" most excellent reading, and
at times almost inspiring.

"Virtuous people," says Isadora, the
eccentric, "are simply those who have
either not been tempted sufficiently,
i because they live in a vegetative
state, or because their purposes are
so concentrated in one direction that
they have not had the leisure to
glance around them." Isadora never
lacked for temptation, nor did she
live in a vegetative state, nor were
her purposes so concentrated that she
could not glance around.
Isadora the Rebel
From the very start Isadora was a
rebel against the commonplace inani
ties of life. While yet a mere child
she was thrown out of school for
loudly denying the Santa Claus
myth. "I don't believe lies," she pro
tested. In subsequent passages she
further indicts the public schools,
most of which criticism they well
enough merit.
The first part of the books chroni
cles the trying struggles of her child
hood and early youth. Audacity, cour
age, and boundless energy slowly, and
with many near-defeats, conquer pov
erty, and we find Isadora in England
on the eve of a career which was to
make her one of the outstanding
artists of this age and one of the most
talked-about women in the world.
Europe Hails Her
Europe was generous with its ap
plause for the revival of the Greek
dance, and the fame and wealth which
she so well merited came to Isadora.
Then came a procession of the most
prodigious and ardent love affairs
which serve mightily to enliven
things throughout the remainder of
the book.
Isadora loved with the true tem
peramental ardor and recklessness.
She did not believe in marriage; so
she had her children, all apparently
brilliant, beyond the bounds fixed by
convention. It is impossible to believe
that any conventionally married
mother could have loved her offspring
more than Isadora loved hers, nor
could any grief be more devastating
than that of Isadora's when her first
(wo children died in an accident and
when the third child died shortly
after birth.
We Admire Her
However doubtful we are of the
social values of Isadora's ideas on
love, marriage, and such, at this stage
of civilization, at least, we cannot
but admire her for the courage with
which she carried out her convictions.

Living above convention is one tiling
to talk about and another thing to do.
But we can't quite forgive her for
some of her promiscuity.
Overlooking numerous contradic
tions, some strange reasoning, and
various other imperfections, we find
"My Life" most excellent reading, and
at times almost inspiring.
