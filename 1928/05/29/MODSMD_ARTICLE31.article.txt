The Editor, Sir:
I wish to state the Ex Committee's
reasons for changing the form of inter
class fight from mud-fight to tie-up, six
months ago, aiter a quarter's delibera
tion.
The fight should be primarily a sports
manlike, fairly safe contest for supremacy
between rival classes—not primarily a
Roman holiday spectacle for a jaded
"public." This consideration has been the
motive in past reforms. It is the motive
now.
The mud-fight is not an old tradition.
It was substituted in 1923-24 for the
Poster Fight which was held at one o'-
clock in the morning—the fight that made
pneumonia famous. A tie-up was held in
the afternoon of the same day for those
who survived the Searsville intromcr
sion. The tie-up is the older tradition,
though recently dormant.
The chief danger in the mud-fight is
that of some guy who is "out" going into

the tank and staying under, unobserved,
in the excitement, confusion, and mud,
until he is gotten out —too late. The
chance is not remote. Ask some recent
competitors.
The hard rough lake-bottom limits fast
aggressive tactics and causes severe body
lacerations that may become badly in
fected from the slime.
As for the recent dishabille of some
mud-fighters, we personally have no quar
rel with the practice of gentlemen losing
clothes in a fight. It gives such a quaint
atmosphere to the campus. But the tie-up
will be a poor substitute for strip poker.
Present plans are to hold the tie-up on
a turf field such as the stadium; to allow
only soft-soled gym shoes to be worn by
contestants; to use soft cotton rope such
,as window-cord; duration of fight to be
twenty minutes or less, timed by major
sport managers; policing to be by Encina
sponsors or honor societies or both. En
emy Houdinis are to be tied up, carried to
a bull-pen, and branded with paint. The
side with the most unmarked men on the
field at the finish to be the winner. These
plans permit a strenuous, decisive battle
without extraordinary danger, one that
permits fast organized tactics on the turf
field, and no doubt as to who is the win
ner.
The indifference of some honor soci
eties when requested to help conduct the
fights has been noted in the past. Their
help is needed in the future.
Constructive suggestions are welcome.
Respectfully yours,
JOHN VAN AMRINGE,
Acting Chairman, Ex Committee

The Editor, Sir:
L. V., the "Jolly-up goer," evidently
assumes that most, if not all of the
500, are above criticism regarding
their dancing. Perhaps it would en
lighten her to know that the question
of a woman's dancing is also of first
importance to the Stanford queener.
A woman can be a knockout as far
as her appearance goes, bujt if she
insists on riding around on your toes
most of the evening she may as well
confine her dates to canoe rides in
the moonlight—and to jolly-ups!
The "jolly-up goer" can be sure of
"trying her wings" at the class
dances. Most Stanford men —even the
roughs—will take one chance there,
because they can always transfer if
they find the going too tough.
The small percentage of the femi
nine contingent at Stanford makes it
imperative that they at least be good
dancers. Though we don't say all
Stanford women are "toe-jammers"
we believe that L. V. has not consid
ered the fact that the woman may be
to blame.
Despite the fact that most sorority
and Roble Hall women practice the
art of terpischore after every meal
