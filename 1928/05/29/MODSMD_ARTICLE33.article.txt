# PERSONALITY OF DALE WINTER, DUFFY STAR, CAPTIVATES REPORTER
## High Theatre Ticket Rates in Eastern Cities Are Told by Actress

Diplomacy is a prime requisite for
an interviewer, but for once I'm ven
turing to be slightly indiscreet and
make a comparison. Whereas Elsie
Janis was colorless and unimpressive
when met without benefit of footlights
or grease paint, Dale Winter, star of
"The Lady Next Door," the new
Henry Duffy show at the Alcazar, is
personality plus both on and away
from the stage.
Miss Winter is the Billie Dove type,
having dark eyes and hair, a trim
figure, a flair for style, and being most
attractive to the eye. Above all she
is congenial, and a most charming
conversationalist. We talked in her
dressing-room after a matinee per
formance, and cross-my-heart she is
as interesting a person as you'll find
in the theatre business.
Away Ten Months
"It has been ten months since my
last appearance here," she told me,
referring to the hilarious "The Patsy"
of last summer. "In the meantime I've
been playing in our other theatres,
but since our home is in Hillsborough
the Alcazar is always home to me."
As you no doubt know. Miss Winter
is really Mrs. Henry Duffy. She came
to this city with her husband about
three years ago when he took over
the Alcazar. Since then she has be
come the most consistently popular
actress on the San Francisco stage,
and her husband has acquired a chain
of eight theatres up and down the
Coast. Next fall they will open the
Duffwin, using both their names for a
beautiful playhouse in Oakland.
Pays $16 For Tickets
"Mr. Duffy and I just returned from
New York and you certainly pay for
your theatre seats there!" she said,
when I remarked that college students
appreciated the Duffy moderate-price
admission policy. "We had to pay six
teen dollars apiece for tickets, and
they are not for sale at the theatre
box-offices but at the brokers.'
"We have a definite standard in all
our theatres —no plays which are not
suitable for all members of the fam
ily. There are no huge profits because
our prices are moderate, but as long
as we can pay expenses and make a
fair return we are satisfied.
"Musical comedies? Yes, "Irene"
was very successful, but I doubt if
we shall do many. It is practically
impossible to stage musical shows
well and not raise our prices."
Miss Winter is well acquainted with
the campus, having attended the
graduation of a cousin here last year.
She was especially interested in learn
ing about our dramatics. "One of my
dreams is the establishment of a fine
training school for actors," she said.
"Not a mediocre one, but a school
comparable to the Sargent Dramatic
School in New York. There is a great
field here, and we could give the
graduates practical work since our
eight theatres are always needing
new actors for roles."
Desire Ranch Home
The Duffys' other desire is for a
ranch home. They like living on the
peninsula .though, and often drive
down to Stanford on Sundays. They
have firmly established themselves on
the Coast as producers of excellent
plays and as actors —Mr. Duffy will
again appear in a play when he gets
his theatre chain working smoothly.
Miss Winter speaks with knowledge
not only about theatre managing, but
about all the latest plays and moving
pictures. She has no desire to play
in the East again, nor, she says, has
her husband. California appeals to
them as much as they do to it.
She is a person one would
like to have as a neighbor, but as
one can't the only alternative is to
see her play-act "The Lady Next
Door." Her personal sincerity and
realness gets across as captivatingly
to the audience as it did to this inter
viewer.

The first combined show of Univer
sity of Washington suffered an ap
proximate loss of $4,000.
