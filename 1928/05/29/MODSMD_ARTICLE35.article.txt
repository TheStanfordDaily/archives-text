## 'Ray For Reigh and Ray 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Saturday, May 19, was a great day
for the Rays. Reigh Count, who spells
his first name a little more "high hat,"
as it were, though it is pronounced
the same, galloped his way through
the mud at Churchill Downs to win
one of the most spectacular Kentucky
Derbies ever run. Joie Ray, about a
sixth as large as Reigh Count but
with a heart just as big, ran twenty
one times as far to win the annual
Long Beach Marathon, breaking the
record, and accomplishing one of the
most dramatic feats in the history of
distance running.
About the same time a lack of the
sun's rays caused Tex Rickard, long
known as the luckiest of promoters,
thrice to postpone the Mandell-Mc-
Larnin championship fight. Thousands
of out-of-town customers, unable to
stay over the week-end, were forced
to turn in their tickets and depart,

but, on the other hand, many who had
gone to Louisville to see Reigh Count
win were back in time to see Sammy
beat up Jimmy on Monday night. The
sun's rays do count, eh Tex?
To get back to Ray and Reigh, the
one assured himself of a trip to Am
sterdam to compete in the historic
Marathon race, blue ribbon event of
the Olympic Games; the other is
being rushed to New York to take
part in the historic Belmont and
other big races. Reigh Count won
$55,000 and a cup for his owner. Joie
Ray won a big cup for himself, with
nothing to put in it. Four-legged
Reißh, only three years old, could
easily defeat two-legged Ray, thirty
years old, at a mile, even though Ray
is co-holder of the world's indoor
record. Maybe if Joie Ray ate grass,
oats, bran and hay, he could run a
mile in 1:35 too!
