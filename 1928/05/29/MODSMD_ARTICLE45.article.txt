EUGENE, Ore., May 27.—(P.1.P.)—
The "Little Emerald," house organ of
the staff of the Oregon Dally Emer
ald, claims the distinction of being
one of the few monthlies that ever
scooped a daily on a big news story.
At 10:45 Wednesday night, three
quarters of an hour after the last bal
lot was counted, the May issue of the
small publication was being distribu
ted on the campus, carrying the news
of the student elections. The returns
came several hours too late for
Eugene and Portland evening papers,
and the "Little Emerald" was out
several hours before the Daily Emer
ald or any of the state morning
papers.
