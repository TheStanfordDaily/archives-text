# CONTINENTAL TRADING DEAL CALLED "THEFT" IN COMMITTEE REPORT
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 28. —
(U.P.) —"A contemptible private steal"
was the characterization given the Con
tinental Trading Company oil deal of
1921 in a report adopted late today by the
Senate Public Utility Lands Committee,
which conducted the Teapot Dome in
vestigation.
The report said there was no evidence
that the $3,050,000 Continental fund was
assembled for political purposes, as had
been suspected.
"It seems to have been the ill-gotten
gains of a contemptible private steal," the
report declared, "the peculations of trust
ed officers of great industrial houses pil
fering from their own companies, robbing
their own stockholders, the share of the
boodle coming to one of the freebooters
serving as the price of perfidy of a mem
ber of the President's cabinet."
Formation Remains Mystery
The committee admitted its inability to
penetrate behind the mystery of the for
mation of the sham company and gave as
the reason "because Robert W. Stewart,
chairman of the Standard Oil Company
of Indiana, and Harry Sinclair refused
to tell."
The report said both could tell if they
so desired.
A second reason why the committee
was unable to ascertain the reason for
formation of the company was that two
other participants, H. W. Blackmer and
James E. O'Neil, had fled the country,
the report continued.
