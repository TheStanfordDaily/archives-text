# "DINK" GIVES CARD TRACK STARS WORK OUT IN EAST
## Stanford To Meet New York Athletic Club on Open Track Saturday Krenz To Have Competition From Hoffmeister of Hanover in Europe 
### Bob Speers 
Although Stanford's Cardinal track
and field warriors have the national
intercollegiate title comfortably be
neath their belts, they are not resting
on their laurels to the extent of going
stale and endangering chances for
further glory.
Such is indicated, anyway, by the
fact that their sagacious guardian,
Dink Templeton, has arranged at
least one practice tilt for them before
the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation meet in Chicago early next
month.
Cards to Meet N.Y.A.C.
Saturday the Cards will meet the
New York Athletic Club stars on an
open track, In the meantime, Stan
ford's team has arrived at the big
city and the boys are putting in their
time seeing sights.
This New York affair shouldn't
amount to much after the rock
crusher methods used by Stanford in
overwhelming the nation's best colle
giate tracksters at Harvard last week
end. It will serve as a good workout,
however, and that is what Templeton
is seeking.
Incidentally, some rough weather is
being anticipated for young Eric
Krenz, sensational Card sophomore,
who has been tossing the discus and
shot all over the eastern part of the
United States. Krenz is, of course,
considered practically a lead pipe
cinch to visit Amsterdam> this sum
mer as America's star weight heaver.
German Is Opponent
A certain German youth, however,
is expected to contribute this afore
mentioned rough weather at the
Olympics. His name is Hoffmeister,
hailing from Hanover, and he has
thrown the discus farther than any
American other than Houser and
Hartranft —all of which will make
Mr. Krenz hump.
That is some months off, though,
and Eric has several big things
mapped out for him before he need
worry about the German threat. Also,
Stanford's sophomore has very satis
factorily demonstrated his ability to
bear up under any sort of competi
tion, and it seems more than likely
that Mr. Hoffmeister will have plenty
on his hands during the Amsterdam
affair.
