# HELENE TURNER GETS PART IN SENIOR PLAY "ONE OF THE FAMILY"
## 
### 
Helcne Turner has been chosen by
Anna May Price, dramatic director, to
take the part of Irene Adams in "One of
the Family," senior farce. This was to
have been played by Kathleen Fitz, who
was not able to take it because of illness.
Miss Turner took part in damatics at San
Mateo Junior College before coming to
Stanford. This is her first campus role.
Irene is the young wife of George
Adams, and since she and her husband
live at the old Boston family home, she is
very resentful of the supervision of the
maiden aunt and two sisters. Behind a
care fidly ingenuous exterior she is quite
calculating and selfish, and willing to
amuse herself by indulging in a romantic
intrigue. When the affair gets into "Town
Talk," and her sister-in-law gets accused
of being the guilty one, and Irene is silent,
things happen.
This farce, which is a popular New
York show by Kenneth Webb, will be
given Wednesday night, June 13.
