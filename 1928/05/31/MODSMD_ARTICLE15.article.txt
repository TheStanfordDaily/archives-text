# Stanford Men In Olympic Trials At Fleishhacker Pool For Diving Titles
## Al White, World's Champion, Starts Team framing At Campus Pool 
### 
By Bill Grace
Five Stanford men will be the promi
nent entries in the Olympic Games diving
tryouts which are to be held June 7 and
10 at Fleishhacker pool, San Francisco,
and at least one man, Ogden Driggs, will
enter the Senior National Outdoor A.A.U.
swimming championships, which will be
held at the same time.
All five divers are at Stanford now,
training at Encina pool and at Searsville
Lake under the instruction of Coach
Ernst Brandsten, American Olympic div
ing coach. A1 White, world champion
diver and Stanford graduate, came to the
campus yesterday to start training in
which he expects to concentrate his efforts
at working on the sandpit board. This
method of training and developing spring
in the sandpit is a device which origi
nated from Stanford when Brandsten in
vented the idea. White attributes a great
deal of his success to this idea.
Desjardins in Competition
Pete Desjardins, former Stanford
freshman, has proved by winning the na
tional championship four times in suc
cession that he is premier diver in Amer
ica next to White, who, as he has not
competed against Pete for three years, is
comparatively an unknown quantity. Ev
eryone concedes that Pete is very nearly
perfect, but it must be remembered that
White beat him in the 1924 Olympics,
several times afterward, and was fa
vored over Desjardins when they last met
at Fleishhacker pool in 1925, so the odds
look about even.
Dave Fall, another Stanford grad, was
second to A1 White at platform diving in
the last Olympic Games, and is concen
trating his efforts at high-tower work in
practice. Fall has had his first real op
portunity to give practice the time it
needs, and at present is in excellent form.
Ed Throndson, of Stanford, who will
dive unattached, looks as though he
would show up well at Fleishhacker. He
was not quite up to form in the Junior
National Championships at Encina pool
Friday, but this will serve as an incentive
to drill on his weak points.
The fifth entry is Herb Marsh, Stan
ford freshman. Brandsten feels that al
though he failed to hit his stride in the
Junior Nationals, Marsh has a not-too
remote chance, if he "gets going," of be
ing one of the five divers who will repre
sent the United States at Amsterdam
next summer.
Ogden Driggs, varsity swimmer, ex
pects to enter the Junior National mile
swim, and will be in competition against
Walton, of the Olympic Club of San
Francisco, and Hargreaves of U.C.
Driggs' best time is 24 :40, and his chance
of winning is good.

Five Stanford men will be the promi
nent entries in the Olympic Games diving
tryouts which are to be held June 7 and
10 at Fleishhacker pool, San Francisco,
and at least one man, Ogden Driggs, will
enter the Senior National Outdoor A.A.U.
swimming championships, which will be
held at the same time.
All five divers are at Stanford now,
training at Encina pool and at Searsville
Lake under the instruction of Coach
Ernst Brandsten, American Olympic div
ing coach. A1 White, world champion
diver and Stanford graduate, came to the
campus yesterday to start training in
which he expects to concentrate his efforts
at working on the sandpit board. This
method of training and developing spring
in the sandpit is a device which origi
nated from Stanford when Brandsten in
vented the idea. White attributes a great
deal of his success to this idea.
Desjardins in Competition
Pete Desjardins, former Stanford
freshman, has proved by winning the na
tional championship four times in suc
cession that he is premier diver in Amer
ica next to White, who, as he has not
competed against Pete for three years, is
comparatively an unknown quantity. Ev
eryone concedes that Pete is very nearly
perfect, but it must be remembered that
White beat him in the 1924 Olympics,
several times afterward, and was fa
vored over Desjardins when they last met
at Fleishhacker pool in 1925, so the odds
look about even.
Dave Fall, another Stanford grad, was
second to A1 White at platform diving in
the last Olympic Games, and is concen
trating his efforts at high-tower work in
practice. Fall has had his first real op
portunity to give practice the time it
needs, and at present is in excellent form.
Ed Throndson, of Stanford, who will
dive unattached, looks as though he
would show up well at Fleishhacker. He
was not quite up to form in the Junior
National Championships at Encina pool
Friday, but this will serve as an incentive
to drill on his weak points.

ford freshman. Brandsten feels that al
