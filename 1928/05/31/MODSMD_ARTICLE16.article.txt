GETTYSBURG, Pa., May 30.—( U.P.)
—From a platform overlooking the fields
of Gettysburg where war was at its
worst, President Coolidgc today expressed
the hope that America's efforts to outlaw
war among civilized nations might be suc
cessful.
The trend of civilization is undoubtedly
toward peace, the President said in his
annual Memorial Day address.
"War means the application of force,"
he emphasized. "Peace means the appli
cation of reason. War is complete law
| lessness. Peace is the rule of law.
"The great conflict which raged upon
this battlefield had for its ultimate deci
sion the question of whether the power
of the sword or the power of the con
stitution was to be supreme."
The President declared it was the hope
of mankind that arbitration and concilia
tion treaties would eventually induce con
sciousness and action that would result in
the prevention of war.
