# STANFORD PREPARES FOR ARMY FOOTBALL CLASH IN NEW YORK
## Series of Two Games Between West Point, Cardinals Awaits Sanction Negotiations For Grid Battle With Cadets Progress Over Long Period 
### 
Possibilities of a scries of two Stan
ford-West Point football games, one to
be played at the Stanford Stadium and
one at New \ork, were boosted Tuesday
when announcement came that Secretary
of War Davis has authorized a game be
tween the Cadets and Stanford. Although
no official agreement is known to exist, it
is understood that Stanford and West
Point authorities have already decided
upon the details and have awaited only
the sanction from Secretary of War and
the approval of West Point superintend
ents.
Game Sites Undecided
It was originally understood that two
games would be played, with Stanford
making a trip East in the fall, perhaps
the week following the Stanford-Califor
nia game, and the Cadets coming to the
Coast late in the fall of 1929. Word from
Washington, however, indicates authori
zation for the Cadets to visit California
this year, with the probability that the
game will be played during the Christmas
holidays. If that is the plan adopted, it
will mean Stanford will have to make an
Eastern trip in 1929.
Don Liebendorfer, director of publicity
for Stanford Board of Athletic Control,
said today that whether West Point
should come here first or the Cards should
go East for the first game, the Eastern
game would have to be played at a New
York stadium as the Army bowl would
not accommodate the crowd.
Pop Warner Glad
That Stanford has been negotiating for
a game with West Point has been known
for some time, but the announcement from
Davis is the first indication that the plans
are progressing.
Pop Warner said the Cardinal squad
would be glad to play the West Point
cadets anywhere and Major-General
Smith, commandant of the military acad
emy, indicated that negotiations for the
games were proceeditg favorably.
If the plans for the home-and-home
series are brought to a successful close,
it will be the first time in history that
West Point has arranged a game with
an institution farther west than Chicago,
where they played the Navy in 1926.
