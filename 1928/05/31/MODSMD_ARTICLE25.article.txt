Next year will be the test of whether or not the A.S.S.U. concert series
shall continue. The two series to the present time have lost money, so much
money that the Executive Committee was very doubtful if the Student
Body should undertake this project again. But after much discussion and
appeals from interested students, it was decided to give the musicales an
other trial.
Today, a general canvass of eating and living groups will be made to
secure pledges for tickets for next year. Much of the success of the under
taking depends upon student support, so it will behoove those interested
to see that they signify their desire to purchase tickets at this time.
From the standpoint of cost, the students—and others, for that matter,
even though they pay more—are getting a real bargain. Balcony seats
couldn't be obtained for even two of the five concerts that may be heard
for the $3.50, if one were to go to San Francisco to hear them singly.
Probably the outstanding number of interest to students is Sousa's
Band. This band has been popular since the present younger generation
first bit teething rings, and has been the sine qua non of bands since we
can remember. Other concerts will be given by Lawrence Tibbett, a native
of California and known for his splendid work in the revival of "FalstalT"
in the Metropolitan Opera House, Efrem Zimbalist, nationally known vio
linist, the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and Margarete Matzenauer,
Hungarian soprano.
It is a splendid thing that we are able to have a series of this sort, but
if the students are not interested enough in good music to go to the
concerts, they will have to be discontinued.
