"From Greenland's icy mountains to Afric's coral strand" brings to
mind no more antipodes upon the earth than the relative position of longi
tude and latitude in which a number of Stanford athletes will this summer
find themselves. For the baseball team will be in Australasia and a few
members of the track team, along with Coach Dink Templeton, will be in
Amsterdam.
Stanford can take a lot of satisfaction in these facts, because it can
feel sure that wherever its athletes go they will give good accounts of them
selves not only on the field of sport, but at banquets and the other social
occasions they will attend. Honor will be brought to the University's4iame
in Australia and New Zealand by a representative baseball nine and at the
Olympic Games by men who are among the best athletes in the world.
Stanford, it would seem, has a chance of placing more men on the American
Olympic team than any other college, and surely that is a credit to Dink
and to his men.
With Alan Herrington and Ralph McElvenny of the tennis varsity
going about the East this summer also, the Daily believes that there is
every likelihood of Stanford's stock being raised still higher as a result of
these several invasions.
