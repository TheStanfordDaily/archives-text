# Vot—Gamblink Again?

Some of the baseball boys had a lot of fun the other day. There were
four of them evidently eligible to take the Australian trip, but only the
money for one was forthcoming. This put the coach in an awful quandary
—one of four, one of four, one of four, what the deuce would he do ? Well,
being a real sport and fond of taking chances (as any man with sporting
blood is), he decided to have the boys cut cards. They did, and the man
who cut a king took the cake.
Obviously, if all the men were of equal abilities, and no one knows that
better than the coach, some such method was just about the fairest and
most impartial way of making the decision. But certainly the splendid
success of the baseball team this year has not been due to cutting the cards
every time a man was needed to play in a game. Of course not; this was
only an isolated case where the coach was in the position of picking one
man out of four who were equal. It's just kinda fun to ponder about,
that's all.
