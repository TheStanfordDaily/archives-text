# Freedom of Sleep
## 
### 
Wednesday night the students in Fayerweather and Wright halls, at
Yale University, were disturbed from their sweet and innocent slumbers
by the rude noises of a sewer machine working in the wee hours in the
street beside the dormitories. Suddenly there was the crash of a bottle
against the machine, then a bedlam ensued with glassware being flung from
all sides. The students made a rush for the campus and in a short time
about 500 men lined the streets.
A flying squadron was sent from police headquarters, and they nablxxl
one student, only to be surrounded by a frenzied mob (as the tabloids
express it) of students who endeavored to rescue their comrade from the
clinging clutches of the dicks. Some more students were arrested (a total
of six) and then they armed themselves with sticks and stones and brick
bats, and stormed headquarters, in a last desperate effort. But they were
repulsed by a reserve force of police, and finally dispersed.
Which all goes to show that Chicago and Mexico aren't the only storm
centers. But we do hope for the benefit of the students next day that they
didn't throw any full bottles out of the window by mistake.
All women members of the Daily staff will meet at 1 o'clock today
?n the office.
