ROUND TWO: THE MUD-FiGHT
VS. THE TIE-UP
Last week, after seeking the opin
ions of many of our undergraduates,
we urged the return of the mud-fight.
Proper supervision, we believed,
would save the day. Still fully con
vinced that the mud-fight, if run as
it should be run, is superior to the
tie-up, we turn to Mr. Van Amringe's
letter in Tuesday's Daily in which is
set forth the other side of the ques
tion, a most honest difference of
opinion.
"The fight," writes Mr. Van Am
ringe, "should be primarily a sports
manlike, fairly safe contest for supre
macy between rival classes." We not
only agree but insist that it should
be a sportsmanlike contest, as it also
should be a safe contest. But on the
matter of supremacy, we agree not at
all. The Ex Committee is obsessed
with the idea that somebody MUST
win; it says the rush is primarily for
that purpose.
Win or Bust
Why all this price on mere victory?
This tendency in American sport that
there must be a winner at all costs
should be deplored. We feel that the
class rush serves its greatest purpose
in unifying the two lower classes,
particularly the entering freshmen,
and whether neither wins, this end
is most satisfactorily accomplished
with the mud-fight. If there must be
a winner, however, the mud-fight can
be made to produce one just as easily
as the tie-up. It's all in the way it is
managed.
The chief danger with the mud
fight, observes the Ex Committee, is
that somebody may get drowned.

With an energetic committee of up
perclassmen in charge of the mud
holes, this remote contingency, in
stead of being a "chief danger," be
comes practically an impossibility,
something to be less expected than
getting a rope around your neck in
a tie-up.
Turf For The Mud-Fight
The objection voiced against the
rough lake-bottom as a field of opera
tions is well-made, both in the case
of a tie-up and in the case of the
mud-fight. If the projected tie-up is to
be held on turf and played with tennis
shoes, we claim the same privilege
for the mud-fight.
Yesterday we went down and care
fully looked over the freshman foot
ball field. It is an ideal place to hold
the mud-fight. There is plenty of room
to construct the pits clear of the
playing field, and the field itself,
which is turf, is just about the cor
rect width for a combat of this sort.
The pits would in no way interfere
with football practice, and if care
fully filled after the fight nothing
would remain in a couple of days to
indicate that there ever had been a
mud-fight in that vicinity.
Open To Conviction
While open to conviction, we are
still of the opinion that the mud-fight
was thrown overboard without being
given a fair chance. Those in charge
fell down, and the whole thing was
weakened. Without decent supervi
sion, the tie-up will fail, too. If the
Ex Committee has high hopes of run
ning a tie-up as one should be run,
why not, out of fairness, does it not
try to run a mud-fight as one should
be run? â€”Jack Springer.
