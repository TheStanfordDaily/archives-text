# YOUTH HELD BY POLICE AFTER SORORITY VISIT
## 
### 
Ah a result of his self-invited visit
to a Stanford Borority house Saturday
night and his annoying actions there,
a young man, who gave his name as
Everette Robert Dowdle and his ad
dress as West-Oakland, is being held
in the psychopathic ward in Santa
Clara by county police and hoalth j
authorities.
Dowdle went to the house and ;
asked for "Ruth." Then ho insisted
on demonstrating his athletic prowess
and claimed high honors in that field.
Police were summoned when his ac
tions became suspicious. Authorities
believe that he may be a drug addict.
