"Iron and Smoke," Sheila Kaye-Smith,
E. P. Dutton & Co.
There is a popular conception that
Sheila Kaye-Smith is too discursive
to be pleasurable reading but this last
book of hers is told with almost
classic simplicity. Those of us who
have a taste for her work will find
here the same beauty and strength
we have been satisfied with formerly,
and light sippers of print need not be
frightened away by the bugaboo of in
tricacy.
A resume of a novel is a very
anemic way of recommending a book
—as futile and thin as enjoying a
ghost of murder, through vicarious
experience. Jenny Barstow is a wo
man whom life passes by, though not
without touching her with its chill,
tragic fingers. And she belongs, in her
frame of "Iron and Smoke" with the
women of "Tamarisk Town," and
"Green Apple Harvest" in the gallery
of near-immortals.
And as always Sheila Kaye-Smith's

talent for words tapestries the pages,
in beautiful phrases, in colors, som
ber and bright, in tableau, in exqui
site sentences. The power of sugges
tion is a gift that too few possess,
scorned by too many for the intoxica
tion of the explicit. Kaye-Smith is one
of the few. Sentences live outside
the mere covers of books when they
are like these: "She found her own
love of explanation and re-explana
tion was not shared by the more
strong-minded of her contemporaries
. ... it belonged to the order of
childish things to put away." . . . "the
restfulness of an occasional unsophis
tication." .... "Friendship comes
out of a community of interest, not
an identity of habits."
The sterner stuff of economic is
sues is not neglected—nor, thank
heaven, are they here over-empha
sized. And through the entire novel
runs the sinister curse of the earth
on the miners, on all who delve in
the under parts of the earth —the
Rape of Demeter. —H.J.K.
