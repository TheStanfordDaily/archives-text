# AND THEN OUR LITTLE SALLY

It really is the strangest way the
government of this country seems to
get all mixed up at the wrong mo
ments with college affairs. That is,
they don't realize just how much a
government can upset things for the
poor students.
Of course, speeding and all the
things that go with that can be very
nicely handled by most educated peo
ple, because they have been taught
the way to use psychology.
But when it comes to income taxes
for eight years back, it would really
seem that something new should hap
pen to the government. I mean to
say, that when it has left the poor

little Bookstore all alone without
taxes for so long, and then to sudden
ly demand them almost for eight
years, why what can be done?
That is, think of all the poor con
scientious students who have been
saving refund slips when the store
can't pay them any more with so
many taxes.
Of course, I don't understand very
much about financiers, I mean
finances, and I wish someone would
really investigate and explain all the
details. It really would help, if you
know what I mean.
And then why should governments
really allow intelligent people to be
fooled by such a silly mistake.
