Poor Geranium looked blank; her -
mind felt blank; in fact her mind
was blank. Then she raised her eyes '
heavenward and called, "Chloe! j
Chloe! —'Oo darlin' puppy, now show
'ure muvver where 'ure grandpa is." j
Chloe, a beautiful Spaniel only
slightly suffering with the mange,
sniffed the floor of the butcher shop j
and then with a sigh lay
down and went to sleep. I

Hezakiah Hinklebluffer smiled his
toothless smile. (He had lost his
teeth by diving in shallow water, and
he refused to have them replaced, be
cause he thought that no teeth added
to his personality.) "I knew the mutt
was no good," he said.
"You brute! I hate you!" cried the
heart-broken Geranium.
"Hark! I hear sounds," whispered
the Man with the Hollow Voice.
(What are the sounds? Sit tight un
til the next chapter.)
A camera made and used about
1865 and photographs taken at the
same time have been presented to
Ohio State University. An Indian
canoe made of birch bark in 1850 has
also been given to the school.
