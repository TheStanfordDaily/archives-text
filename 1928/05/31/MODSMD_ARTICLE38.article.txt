NEW HAVEN, May 30.—( U.P.) —
I More than two hundred Yale students
fought fifty police in the attempt to
rescue six of their leaders, who had
been arrested for disturbing the
peace, in early morning hours today.
The riot, termed the worst in the
history of the city, started when a
sewer machine awoke sleeping resi
dents. The students pouring from
dormitories soon had the machine's
operations stilled and street car trol
leys pulled from the wires.
Oklahoma's tobacco-juice spitters
met in a contest to determine best
| distance and most accurate spitter.
