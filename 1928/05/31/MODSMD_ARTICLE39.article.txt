### 
Murdered, kidnapped, lost or
drowned. Such were the explanations
offered by friends of Ulrich Graff, '31,
for his mysterious disappearance last
Thursday evening.
When Graff did not appear at his
room in Encina Tuesday night, little
commotion resulted. "Probably gone
home for the week-end," his room
mate suggested, but that theory was
exploded when they discovered that
his suitcase and all of his clothes re
mained in the room. When Sunday
arrived and still no trace was found
of the msising man his "roomies"
thought of telephoning to his home,
but they did not do that for fear he
wouldn't be there an dthat would de
stroy all hope of his being alive. Late
that night it developed that eye-wit
nesses had on the fateful day seen
Graff wearing a swimming suit and
heading toward Lagunita. It was then
believed that Graff had drowned. In
the meantime the Dean's Office was
notified, and definitely established the
fact that Graff's folks had not seen
him since his disappearance.
The mystery was solved on Tues
day, the sixth day of anxiety, when
the missing man walked into his En
cina room. He had been confined in
the Isolation Hospietl.
