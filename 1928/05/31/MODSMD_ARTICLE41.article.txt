### 
First copies of a recent publication
of the Commercial Press, L't'd., Shang
hai, China, have recently arrived in
this country. The book is entitled,
"A Study of Chinese Alchemy," and
the author is Dr. Obed S. Johnson,
instructor in Chinese Language and
Civilization at Stanford. The foreward
is by Professor R. T. Williams of the
University of California.
The book is in the nature of an
historical investigation of the origin
and development of Chinese Alchemy
and deals with a subject heretofore
practically unexplored by Western
scholars.
Both the facts adduced and the con
clusion are primarily the result of a
fctudy of original Chinese sources.
The author maintains that Chinese
Alchemy originated in the teachings
of early Taoist philosophy and that
in time it developed along two main
lines, the alchemy of prolonging life
and the alchemy of transmitting
metals.
