# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is a young man who lives up
to his middle name, which is Ernest.
From the sandlots of Cleveland into
a major league uniform he jumped in
1919 when he was twenty-one years
old, and since that time he has been
a *hard and earnest worker, toiling
diligently at his trade of pitching for
the Cleveland Indians. Starting with
ten games won in 1919, as against
five lost, George Ernest Uhle gradu
ally worked his percentage up to 26
victories and 16 defeats in 1923. The
following year he slumped, picked up
a bit in '25, and 1926 saw him come
into his own again with 27 wins and
only 11 losses.
I mention his record of two years
ago in detail because every fan is
interested in whether or not George
Uhle is going to equal that mark
again this year. Uhle, in 1926, won
the most games of any league hurler,

took part in the most innings, and
struck out 160 men, being second
only to Left Grove of the Athletics
in that respect. He also had an earned
run average of 2.83, the lowest he'd
ever made. In 1927, handicapped by
illness, he won only eight games and
lost nine. Now he is back in fine form
again, and, with Grove, Walberg, Pen
nock, and Pipgras, is setting a far
better record in the American league
than any National league hurler.
On May 8 of this year, Uhle, who
beat the Yanks six straight times in
1926, shut out the champions 3 to 0
with only four hits. On May 13 he
pitched a one-hit shutout against the
Athletics, and on May 17 he defeated
the Senators 8 to 3, batting in four
runs himself. The big Cleveland right
hander has alway been a powerful
batter, and hit the ball on the nose
for a .300 average for several years.
