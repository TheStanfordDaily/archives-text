SAN FRANCISCO, May 30— (U.P.)
—A radio message bearing the signa
ture of "Nobile" has been intercepted
at Cordova, Alaska, and has revived
hope that Gen. Umberto Nobile and
his dirigible Italia had landed after
being disabled by a storm.
It was not definite, however, that
the commander of the Italia had
signed the message quoted in the dis
patch to the United Press. It was
known, however, that the brother of
Nobile was aboard the "Citta di Mi
lano," relief ship, and it was pointed
out that the message may have been
signed by him.

which has been missing near the
North Pole.
"Nobile I heard your transmitter on
about 33 meters. Go ahead," the
Vladivostok operator said.
