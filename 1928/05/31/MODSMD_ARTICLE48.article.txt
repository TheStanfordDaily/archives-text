# ENTERTAINERS TO AID BURT KING ORCHESTRA FOR SENIOR FORMAL
## 
### 
Burt King's eight-piece orchestra,
i playing at the Claremont Hotel, Berkeley,
I under the direction of Horace Heidt, will
j furnish the music for the Senior Ball, ac
| cording to word received yesterday by
; Malcolm MacQuiddy, chairman of the
j music committee. The orchestra will be
supplemented by Heidt's three lead men,
now performing at the Grand Lake Thea
ter, Oakland, who star in string solo, soft
shoe, gags, and singing trio work. The
latter will be at the dance from 12 until
3 o'clock.
Since the 160 Senior Ball bids have all
been sold, and there is already a waiting
list of eight, seniors not accommodated
are urged to sign up.

The most radical departure from
present systems is the university's
attempt to "measure progress toward
the bachelor's degree in terms of real
achievement, rather than in terms of
prescribed courses, or hours, or
points, or anything of the kind."
