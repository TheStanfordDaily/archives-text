OAKLAND AIRPORT, Oakland,
May 29.—( U.P.) —The dare of the Pa
cific Ocean that has lured ten aviators to
death and has been overcome by eight
others will he answered again Thursday
morning, providing weather conditions are
favorable, by Captain Charles Kingsford-
Stnith and litis three companions.
The Australian aviator's three-motored
Fokker monoplane, similar to the craft
used by the army in the first successful
flight to the islands, was receiving its final
grooming here tonight for the start, which
is scheduled for Thursday morning.
Only the final motor tests and the
minute checking of instruments remained
for the crew and mechanics of the plane
before it is capable of starting the ambi
tious venture from here to Australia by
way of Honolulu.
