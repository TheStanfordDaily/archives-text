# MARIE EMERY CHARMS TUESDAY GATHERING IN CLASSICAL SELECTIONS
## 
### A. I 
Gretchaninotf's "Lullaby" with a
sweet, quiet melody well suited to
the soprano voice of Marie de Forest
Emery was the best selection of the
concert given by this musician and
Helena Munn Redewill, pianist, Tues
day night in the Little Theatre. Mrs.
Emery's voice shows to much more

' advantage in a composition of this
j style than in one like Rachmaninoff's
, "Floods of Spring," which she also
sang.
"Cadiz," a brilliant Spanish compo
l sition by Albeniz, was the best of the
piano selections by Helena Redewill,
but her interpretation offered little
j variation of expression, and her solos
thus became somewhat monotonous,
i Miss Redewill is much better as an
| accompanist than as a soloist.
