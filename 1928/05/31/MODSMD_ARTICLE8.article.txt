# Thirteen Players Of Stanford Ball Squad Named On Australian Team
## Paxton Cuts The Cards With Three Others to Decide Thirteenth Place 
### Frank Whiteley 
The lineup of the varsity baseball
squad to make the trip to Australia
and New Zealand this summer was
announced yesterday by Coach Harry
Wolter. The following thirteen play
ers will go: Bill Maguire, first base;
"Garry" Garibaldi, second base; Bill
Laird, third base; J. E. Busch, short
stop; Harry Berg and Roger Paxton,
catchers; "Spud" Harder, right field;
Jack Levin, left field; Frank Wilton,
center field; Gene Kern, Bob Philippi,
Doug Lewis, and "Rudy" Riese,
pitchers.
This group, though lacking three
regulars, "Cook" Sypher, John So
bieski, and Bob Sims, who are unable
to go, should be able to win more
than their share of games against the
Australians and New Zealanders.
Cards Strong in Pitching
The Cards are particularly strong
lin the pitching department. Kern,
Lewis, and Philippi are all first-rate
; moundsmen and were frequently in
the box for Stanford during the past
season. Riese, though playing in but
j one or two games during this year, is
a fairly consistent hurler and a good
fill-in man.
j Berg and Paxton will alternate at
! the receiving position in place of
! Sypher. Berg is a heavy hitter and
! has performed satisfactorily in the
two games, but in practice looked like
i a good man. Paxton drew cards to de-
I cide the thirteenth man on the squad.
The players suffering from Lady
j Luck's misfortunes were Reynolds,
| Don Story, and Perry Taylor.
The remainder of the lineup, with
: the exception of the right field posi
; tion which will be filled by Harder,
! will be the same. Harder has been
in the Cardinal lineup for three years
and has proven especially valuable as
a hitter in the pinches.
The players will be accompanied by
I Coach Wolter, Mrs. Wolter, and a
i faculty representative, not as yet
I named.
