Finds Tobacco
for "Breaking
; In" a Pipe
Columbus, Ohio
March 10, 1927
Larus & Bro. Co.
Richmond, Va.
Gentlemen:
Two years ago my wife gave me an
expensive pipe. I smoked it a great
deal for two or three weeks, put it aside,
then began smoking it again. This
time it was very strong. Veterans told
me that it had been smoked too hard
for a new pipe and should be put away.
The pipe was laid away again. A
short time ago I got it out and smoked
one of the common brands of tobacco
in it. The results were disappointing.
I told the druggist of my experience
with it. He asked if I had tried Edge
worth. I told him I never had. I fol
lowed his suggestion, and I am honest
when I say that it has restored the
sweetness to the pipe, and has made
me wonder. Was it the pipe or the
brand of tobacco that caused me to
lay it away for the long period of time?
As a novice, I prefer Edgeworth. I
am going to stick to it, as I feel satis
fied that there is none better on the
market.
Sincerely yours,
Philip C. Shera

Finds Tobacco
for "Breaking

Columbus, Ohio
March 10, 1927
Larus & Bro. Co.
Richmond, Va.
Gentlemen:
Two years ago my wife gave me an
expensive pipe. I smoked it a great
deal for two or three weeks, put it aside,
then began smoking it again. This
time it was very strong. Veterans told
me that it had been smoked too hard
for a new pipe and should be put away.
The pipe was laid away again. A
short time ago I got it out and smoked
one of the common brands of tobacco
in it. The results were disappointing.
I told the druggist of my experience
with it. He asked if I had tried Edge
worth. I told him I never had. I fol
lowed his suggestion, and I am honest
when I say that it has restored the
sweetness to the pipe, and has made
me wonder. Was it the pipe or the
brand of tobacco that caused me to
lay it away for the long period of time?
As a novice, I prefer Edgeworth. I
am going to stick to it, as I feel satis
fied that there is none better on the
market.
Sincerely yours,
Philip C. Shera
