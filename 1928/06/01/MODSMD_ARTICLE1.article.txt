### 
Hildur Richardson was yesterday ap
pointed business manager of the 1930
Quad at a meeting of the Publications
Council. Adcle Gist was made women's
manager. Miss Richardson will have
the post of Mac Lewis, present business
manager, and Miss Gist will have the po

This is the first time a woman has ever
held the position of business manager of
the Quad* since the leading woman try
outee is customarily appointed women's
manager. The excellence of Miss Rich
ardson's work during the year caused her
to be given this posiiton.
Other positions to be filled are those of
advertising manager and circulation man
ager for the 1930 Quad. Thes? appoint
ments are to be made by Miss Richardson,
and will be announced later. They will
be chosen from the remaining four try
outees, one woman and three men. All
three women ranked higher than the men
in this year's tryoutee competition.
