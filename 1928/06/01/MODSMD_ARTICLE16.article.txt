# WEISMULLER SHOWS FAST QUARTER-MILE TIME IN ENCINA POOL
## 
### 
Fastest time in the quarter-mile
ever made in Encina Pool was shown
Wednesday night when Johnny Weis
muller, famous record-smashing swim
mer from the Illinois Athletic Club,
easily made the distance in 5 minutes.
Weismuller is now in San Francisco
practicing in the Fleishhacker salt
water pool for the Senior National
Outdoor A.A.U. swimming champion
ship to be held at the pool June 7 to
June 10.
Milton Burns, 'SI, is a strong en
trant for Stanford in the 400-meter
breaststroke in this meet. Burns has
made the 220-yard breaststroke in 3
minutes 4 seconds, remarkably good
time, and another record for Encina
Pool. He will probably place at
Fleishhacker, and in this event he
may make the trip to the Olympic
Games. His biggest rival in the
A.A.U. meet will be Walter Spence
of the Brooklyn Y.M.C.A. who cannot
compete for the United States at Am
sterdam because he is a native of the
West Indies and a British citizen.
Ogden Driggs, varsity swimmer, will
enter the mile. His best time is 24:40,
and swimming against Walton of the
San Francisco Olympic Club, and
Hargreaves of U.C., he has a good
chance of winning the event.
Wally O'Connor, ex-'26, is now
swimming for the Illinois Athletic
Club and will arrive here tomorrow,
after having trained at Yosemite for
(he A.A.U. meet. Ho and Weismuller,
with Bob Halloran and Paul Samson
will make the I.A.C. relay team,
which is expected to win this event
at the Fleishhacker pool. The Illinois
team will be in San Francisco tomor
row, and may be seen in action at
Stanford next week.
