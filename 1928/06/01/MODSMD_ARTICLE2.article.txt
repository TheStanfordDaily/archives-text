# Five Hundred Limit Made In Amendment To University Grant
## 
### Joan Nourse 
Limitation of the number of women at
Stanford was not included in the original
founding grant. There is no mention
made concerning the number of women to
be admitted, until the amendment to the
grant formulated on May 31, 189Â£, by
Mrs. Stanford, because of the increasingly
large number of women applying for en
trance. To quote the amendment as pre
sented to the Board of Trustees at the
time, "Whereas the University was found
ed in memory of our dear son Leland, and
bears his name, I direct, by the power
given me in the original grant, that the
number of women attending the Univer
sity as students shall at no time exceed
five hundred."
Stanford Names Board
The first Board of Trustees was named
by Senator Stanford himself. Among
those on the board were James McM.
Shafter, commander-in-chief of the troops
in the invasion of Cuba; Lorenzo Sawyer,
justice of the Supreme Court; Irving M.
Scott, president of the Union Iron Works
that built the "Oregon," the ship which
won the battle of Santiago; William M.
Stewart, senator from Nevada; Stephen
J. Field, appointed by President Lincoln
during the Civil War to the United States
Supreme Court as the first justice from
the West; T. B. McFarland, judge of the
California Supreme Court; and Horace
j Davis, a former president of the Univer
| sity of California. As vacancies occurred
! others were appointed. Among these
were Horatio Stebbins, father of Horatio
W. Stebbins, professor of Mechanical En
gineering at Stanford; Edward R. Tay
lor, a former mayor of San Francisco;
Whitlaw Reid, at one time ambassador to
Great Britain; Josiah W. and Thomas W.
Stanford, brothers of Senator Stanford.
Twenty-three Serve
The board was first composed of twen
ty-three members. It was cut to twenty,
and because of an amendment made by
Mrs. Stanford, to fifteen. The amend
ment directed that no persons be ap
pointed to fill vacancies until the number
was reduced, and that the new ones serve
terms of ten years. As a result of this
there are only two life members on the
present board, Timothy Hopkins, ap
pointed in 1885, and Joseph D. Grant, ap
pointed in 1891.
The first business manager was Diaries
G. Lathrop, a brother of Mrs. Stanford.
He retired, and Vanderlynn Stow took
his place. This proved unsatisfactory
since both were trustees. Finally Almon

E. Roth was appointed comptroller. A
ruling was then put through that neither
president nor comptroller should be trus
tees.
Of the present members of the board,
five are Stanford graduates. The first of
these to be appointed was Herbert C.
Hoover, '95, former graduate manager at
Stanford; T. T. C. Gregory, '99, manager
of the track team while at Stanford;
John T. Nourse, '00, editor of the Daily
in 1900, and graduate manager; Leland
W. Cutler, '06, a manager of the band and
member of the Daily reportorial staff;
and Ira S Lillick, '97, now the best
known admiralty lawyer on the coast.

Yale student council has decided
not to attempt any longer to enforce
the honor system.
