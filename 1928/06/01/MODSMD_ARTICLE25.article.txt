# Where The Blue Begins
## 
### 
Once a year the women of the Daily staff put out an edition of the
paper without the assistance of the men. It is customary on this occasion
to head the editorial cfolumn with apologia for the edition.
This time we have very little to say. The only new features in this
blue edition are the appearance of the women's paper the day after
Women's Field Day instead of before, and the cutting of the razz element
to a minimum. We have tried to produce a newspaper on a par with the
usual Stanford Daily rather than a razz sheet.
Whether we have succeeded or failed in this aim is for you to judge.
So here is the women's edition of 1928, presented to you with the hope of
meeting your approval.
