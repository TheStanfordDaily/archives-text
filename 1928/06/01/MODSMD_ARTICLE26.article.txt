# On The Near Horizon

### 
For years Stanford women have looked to a new gymnasium as a dim
and distant possibility," somewhere beyond the blue, and have despairingly
cried out for action, but without hope of immediate concrete results. Now
the situation is slightly changed. The new building is no longer a remote
contingency, but a near possibility.
Plans for the proposed new edifice are actually being drawn by the
University architects. It may be a long way from plans to the finished
structure, but it isn't nearly as far as it seemed to be from the desire to the
plans. The women have agitated long and well, and now they have
achieved a long step forward.
Now what is needed is more and stronger agitation until the corner
stone of the new gymnasium is laid. That cornerstone should be firmly
put in place sometime next year, after which the building should go up in
record time. Once construction is started in earnest, Stanford thorough
ness ought to put the whole thing through in a big hurry.
The main question is finance. However, as we were recently told, when
there is a worthy cause, the money can somehow be found on the campus
for it. Already the Ex Committee has matched W.A.A.'s fund for the
new building. The Board of Athletic Control has been approached and has
expressed sympathy with the project. Whether the Board sees its way
clear to financing the building or even to contributing, or not, its interest
will bear influence with other possible contributors.
There is no really good reason why everyone in Lower Division now
should not see the completion of a new women's gymnasium before he
or she graduates.
