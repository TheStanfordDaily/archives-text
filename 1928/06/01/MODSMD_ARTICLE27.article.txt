# For Today
## 
### 
While Stanford intercollegiate athletics are either over or looking to
the future, there is today on the campus an event to which the eyes of
sport fans might wll be turned. The annual R.O.T.C. Morse Show takes
place at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon at the Encina polo field.
The Horse Show is an all-University affair, all men students being
eligible. The entry lists are usually well filled. That means that almost
everyone on the campus who is not entered is bound to have some friend
or acquaintance who will be performing in the show. It is also no mean
exhibit of skill in riding, and for that alone is worthy of attention. There
is thus a double incentive for all of Stanford to attend.
No other interests conflict with the Horse Show. It is quite in the
limelight for today, and merits the interest which, judging by past Horse
Shows, it will probably arouse.

Monday's Daily will be the last issue of the quarter. All notices, there
fore, for the rest of the quarter, must be published on that date. Such
notices will be accepted up to 9 o'clock Sunday night.

There will be a meeting of all new members of the Business Staff at
one o'clock sharp today. The meeting will be short, but it is important that
every member be present.
