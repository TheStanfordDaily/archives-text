# NERVE CURRENT SENT FROM HUMAN MUSCLE OVER AIR HEARD HERE
## 
### 
The broadcasting of nerve currents
from the acting muscles of a human being
were heard recently at the University of
lowa by Dr. W. R. Miles, professor of
Experimental Psychology at Stanford.
These currents were broadcast from sta
tion WSUI by Dr. Lee Travis, director of
the speech clinic at the University of
lowa.
Every muscle when it acts creates a
current, according to Dr. Miles. In this
experiment electrodes, put on a man's leg
above the knee, were led to an ampli
fier. The noises were amplified 800,000
times, sounded into the microphone, and
broadcast. Other bits of action were also
turned in broadcast waves. The front of
the knee was tapped to get a reflex action,
and there was a loud roar caused by the
volley of impulses sent over the nerve to
the muscle. The electrical currents in the
nerve were amplified during this action
by the resistance coupled set, gave a short
roar in the microphone, and were sent out
on the air.
This experiment is the first in which
the action currents of the muscle have

been broadcast. They have been measured
and taken into account in studying speech
defects, and Dr. Travis has found that a
stammerer during stammering has a very
marked quickening in the beginning of
the electrical response when tapped on
the knee. This result opens a new inter
pretation of nervous connections having
to do with reflexes.
• Dr. Miles, with Dr. Robert Seashore,
National Research Fellow in Psychology
at Stanford, is starting work of the same
nature in the Psychology department,
which is being done with the string gal
vanometer.
