### 
ROME, May 31—(U.P )—An official
communique issued today advanced
the opinion that General Umberto
Nobile had ended his flight In the
dirigible Italia "perhaps violently" be
tween Wiejde Bay and Henlopen
Straits, "not less than 60 nor more
than 190 kilometers from Kings Bay."
This was the first official statement
issued by any government since the
Italia was lost. The Italian Govern
ment, apparently after consulting ex
perts, outlined relief expeditions
planned In collaboration with Nor
way, Sweden, and Russia, and gave
precise calculations of time and place
the Italia went down.
Summarizing Nobile's situation, the
communique says the accident oc
curred at 10:27 A.M., May 25, "and
it can be calculated that the flight
was unexpectedly, perhaps violently,
interrupted In tho space of ten min
utes from the last radio call.
"If it is not possible to roach the
survivors by sea, relief will be organ
ized by land. These expeditions will
be ready to move as soon as it is
definitely learned where Nobile Is
located.
