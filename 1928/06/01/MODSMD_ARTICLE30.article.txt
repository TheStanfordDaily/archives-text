WHAT PRICE ACTIVITES
With the No-Checks-Cashed sign
going up in the Union as a patent re
minder that the end of the year is
very near, the time for closing our
undergraduate books also approaches.
Since the matter of our scholastic
achievements and assets of these
three quarters is a matter personal
to each student, the faculty, and God,
the chief commodity our figurative
accounting systems deal in is time.
Innumerable estimates may be
made of the value of the hours spent
at college, but the simplest measure
for valuation is the rate student labor
is paid by employers—or fifty cents
an hour. Taking a rough estimate,
with a nine-hour-a-night average for
sleep, and four hundred and ninety
five hours for scholastic work, Ave
have then about 660 hours for eating,
playing, and activities, a quarter. The
question is, do we get, vulgarly and
mundanely speaking, our money's
worth for this time? Or, more parti
cularly, since this is the Women's
Edition, what price activities for the
Five Hundred?
Woman's Place Rises
Time was when the only places
women had in the collegiate activities
of this University were restricted to
office routine work, and minor execu

tive positions—excepting dramatics
and social activities, to be sure. But
in the last two years some admirable
precedents liave been set and three
offices of responsibility, at least, are
open—concert manager, literary edi
torships, and Quad manager.
Activities, on this campus, are very
much like the drug habit. You can
recognize a tryoutee, and the length
of his period of work, by the depth of
the circle under his eyes. You can
recognize a tryoutee by the blisters
on his hands (from sweeping the base
ment of the Assembly Hall), or on his
typing ability. In the summer, you can
identify him by his conversation —
the who's who chronological order
attitude. Are activities here worth the
expense?
Value to Individuals
To our mind the chief value of the
time and labor expended on extra-cur
riculum activities is to the individu
als. If a perspective can be kept, and
a normal average of sleep, they are
surely worth cultivating. They are
surely not worth the five or six thou
sand dollars our estimate gives, but
with discretion, every woman in the
Five Hundred can now afford to give
$200 or so of her time in the pursuit
of the filing catalogue. More power to
the women! —H. J. K.

much like the drug habit. You can
recognize a tryoutee, and the length
of his period of work, by the depth of
the circle under his eyes. You can
recognize a tryoutee by the blisters
on his hands (from sweeping the base
ment of the Assembly Hall), or on his
typing ability. In the summer, you can
identify him by his conversation —
the who's who chronological order
attitude. Are activities here worth the
expense?
Value to Individuals
To our mind the chief value of the
time and labor expended on extra-cur
riculum activities is to the individu
als. If a perspective can be kept, and
a normal average of sleep, they are
surely worth cultivating. They are
surely not worth the five or six thou
sand dollars our estimate gives, but
with discretion, every woman in the
Five Hundred can now afford to give
$200 or so of her time in the pursuit
of the filing catalogue. More power to
the women! —H. J. K.
WHAT PRICE ACTIVITES
With the No-Checks-Cashed sign
going up in the Union as a patent re
minder that the end of the year is
very near, the time for closing our
undergraduate books also approaches.
Since the matter of our scholastic
achievements and assets of these
three quarters is a matter personal
to each student, the faculty, and God,
the chief commodity our figurative
accounting systems deal in is time.
Innumerable estimates may be
made of the value of the hours spent
at college, but the simplest measure
for valuation is the rate student labor
is paid by employers—or fifty cents
an hour. Taking a rough estimate,
with a nine-hour-a-night average for
sleep, and four hundred and ninety
five hours for scholastic work, Ave
have then about 660 hours for eating,
playing, and activities, a quarter. The
question is, do we get, vulgarly and
mundanely speaking, our money's
worth for this time? Or, more parti
cularly, since this is the Women's
Edition, what price activities for the
Five Hundred?
Woman's Place Rises
Time was when the only places
women had in the collegiate activities
of this University were restricted to
office routine work, and minor execu

tive positions—excepting dramatics
and social activities, to be sure. But
in the last two years some admirable
precedents liave been set and three
offices of responsibility, at least, are
open—concert manager, literary edi
torships, and Quad manager.
Activities, on this campus, are very
