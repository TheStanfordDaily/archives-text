"Dead Lovers Are Faithful Lovers,"
Frances Newman; Boni & Live
right.
"A Man of Learning," Nelson Antrim
Crawford; Little Brown & Co.
This latest novel by Frances New
man, author of "The Hard-Boiled Vir
gin," has been attracting attention on
the bookstands lately with its exotic
purple dust cover, and surprising title.
Between the cove'rs, however, it is a
trifle disappointing. In the first place,
Miss Newman has changed from the
style in her previous book, to a much
more garrulous one. She has also
used a rather unique type of "stream
of consciousness" narrative that is
perhaps more self-conscious than any
thing else.
The parallel reactions of Eveleyn
Page Cunningham and Isable Ram
say to Charlton Cunningham's love
are traced with minute and careful
detail. There are a number of refer
ences that will be too esotpric for the
majority of masculine readers, but
will amuse the fairer sex. We are
almost tempted to give the page num
bers of these to save you from read
ing the book entirely through—for it
is tedious. This reaction of ours is
tempered by the fact that finals are
far too close to allow anyone to enjoy
much reading, and perhaps this book
would be far more enjoyable with a
summer of leisure ahead.
Miss Newman has, however, a pleas
ant cynicism that is the result of di
rect observation. She is quite con
scienceless about using the gossip and
family history of her acquaintances,
and anyone familiar with Atlanta,
Georgia, will be scandalized' and de
lighted at the aspects in which it ap
pears through her pages. She is also
very well acquainted with the reac
tions of young Southern girls, and of
respectable Southern ladies — and
equally merciless about using this
knowledge. There is a saying that the
chief exports of Georgia are peaches
and pretty wives—but if Miss New
man persists in her novel career, we
anticipate a decided drop in the lat
ter industry.

Crawford, the author of "The Man
of Learning," Is evidently motivated
by the same type of cynicism that
Miss Newman is liable to, but his

creation, Dr. Arthur Patrick Redfield,
Ph.D., L.L.D., is treated In a far dif
ferent manner —and a more amusing
one. Dr. Redfield is one of the estima
ble gentlemen wh6 have raised
American academic life to the broth
erhood and level of the Rotarians. He
is first in the path of righteousness,
profit, and Christian ideals, first in
the path of service to God's children,
American ideals, and publicity.
This biography of Redfield, who
"applied education to its noblest
needs —idealistic American business,"
does not stop at merely satirizing
university organizations, but com
ments on most of the conspicuous as
pects of our life. The whole work is
such beautifully concealed irony that
we have even heard of one fairly esti
mable gentleman who absorbed it
seriously, from cover to cover; and
then asked who this man Redfield
was, as the name sounded familiar!
It is a book difficult to review in a
limited space, but this burlesque of
the successful college senior's record
may serve to give a conception of the
work: "The list of his distinctions
printed in the Junior Annual of his
class —which list was incomplete, due
to his modest desire not to appear to
outshine his fellow students —shows
the variety of his work: Member Chi
Delta; Member Philomathian Literary
Society; Member University Writers'
Club; President, Athletic Association;
Manager, Men's Glee Club; Chairman.
Sophomore Cotillion Committee;
Chairman, Junior Prom Committee;
Intercollegiate Debating Team; Win
ner. Sophomore Oratorical Contest;
Secretary, Scientific Club; Chairman,
Student Committee on Beautification
of the Campus; Editor, 'The Univer
sity Clarion'; Associate Editor, 'The
Voice'; Chairman, Interfraternity
Committee on Scholarship; Member,
Y.M.C.A. Cabinet; President, The Ivy
Vine."
Senior records are noble monu
ments on the grave of four years of
scholarly pursuit—Redfield was fore
most in the pursuit. The satire of "A
Man of Learning" is so close to the
situations on our own campus that it
would be more flattering to believe
Stanford was the object, than the con
clusion we are forced to admit —that
even Stanford is after the general
pattern.—l-lallie Keating.
