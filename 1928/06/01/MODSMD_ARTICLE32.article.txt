# AND THEN OUR LITTLE SALLY

### 
When thoy told me this was going
to be the Women's Edition and that
it was going to be light blue, I was
so excited. I mean, when the girls all
get together with a purpose, why
things are bound to happen.
Someone told me that the roughs
liad a hard time making dates around
here good ones, but I really don't
seem to gather just what they meant.
Why, when girls can put out a whole
paper, they certainly are open to sug
gestion.
But, of courso, men alwnys object
to the people who are around them.
That is to say, they seem to want
something farther off. I guess it is
because it helps them to keep their
self-respect.
The women on this campus roally
think the roughs are quite nice. They

can't be anything else. I mean, they
are such innocent young men it would
take a bomb or an import to put any
fire Into them. It really is a shame the
way they wander around in a daze.
I guess they don't realize all the
things they are missing. Hut after
they read this edition and understand
what campus girls really can do, If
they get a break, there should bo
something new in tho way of scandal.
That is, someone will writo in and
say what a mess girls make of things,
but we will have the laugh, if you
know what I mean.

The annual State College of Wash
ington Campus Day, during which the
students turn out en masse to clean
up the campus, was staged Friday,
May 18.
