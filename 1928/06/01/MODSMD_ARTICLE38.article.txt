# FRANCES WILLIS HAS DIFFICULT CONSULAR POST, AVERS STUART
## Women at Disadvantage in Trying for Positions in Foreign Service 
### Adele Smith 
"A woman could hardly hold a more
difficult position than Frances Willis, '20,
now has as American vice-consul at Val
paraiso," said Professor Grtdiam Stuart
in an interview yesterday. "The west
coast of South America is especially iso
lated and her post is far removed from
Washington."
Frances Willis is one of the three out
standing women in our foreign service,
and the second to gain such an important
appointment in American, consular serv
ice. The others are Lucile Atchison, who
is secretary of legation at Geneva, and
Pattie Field, who is a vice-consul. Miss
Willis took her Ph.D. at Stanford. She
then taught history at Goucher College,
and later, political science at Vassar. Her
appointment is considered one of the best
openings of the year.
Use Merit Basis
Professor Stuart went on to discuss the
status of women in foreign service. "Dur
ing the last few years the foreign serv
ice has been judging all candidates strict
ly on a merit basis," he said. Frankly,
however, all other considerations being
equal, a woman usually has a harder time
getting in. At first, women were sent only
to posts where they were considered on
an equal basis with men. Our first wom
en in consular service were sent to Hol
land and Switzerland."
The idea of women holding important
positions in foreign service is not new.
Louis XIV was one of the first to place
this responsibility on a woman by sending
one as an ambassador to Poland. Later
a Russian woman, Kollontay, was sent to I
Norway. Here she achieved outstanding
distinction through a commercial treaty 1
which she negotiated with Norway. It j
was especially remarkable in that, in spite j
of great opposition, it secured practically 1
every advantage to Russia. In later years j
Uruguay and Bulgaria have intrusted
women with important consular and diplo- j
matic positions.
"More women enter foreign service as
clerks than as consuls or diplomats,"
stated Professor Stuart. "Many men have
advanced into foreign service proper from j
this position. It offers many opportunities j
for women."
"Another effective way for a woman j
to enter diplomatic service," he suggested,
"is to marry into diplomatic circles. There j
is no field in which family connections:
count for so much. Social duties con
stitute the main part of the diplomat'sj
life.
Examinations Stiff
"All applicants have to take examina- 1
tions, one written, which is held each year!
at certain centers throughout the United
States, and one oral, which takes place at!
Washington, D.C. These are extremely I
difficult, covering international law; one
modern language, which includes French,;
Spanish, or German; political economy;!
natural, industrial, and commercial re- 1
sources, one of the hardest and most j
stiffly rated; political and commercial
geography; American history, govern-1
ment, and institutions; and modern his- J
tory of Europe, Latin America, and the j
Far East."
After passing the examinations, the ap- j
plicants spend six months at the State
Department on half salary familiarizing I
themselves with its methods and proce- i
dures.
In comment on Miss Willis' position, !
Professor Stuart concluded: "A consul
must be able to meet all sorts of situations !
as they arise, must watch out for Ameri-'
can interests, vise passports and keep j
track of immigration records. Moreover,'
a consul must not only protect American
trade but must watch for opportunities for
furthering its interests. It is altogether a
real job, and a splendid achievement for
a woman."

Americans, it is said, need to enun
ciate more distinctly.

In comment on Miss Willis' position, !
Professor Stuart concluded: "A consul
must be able to meet all sorts of situations !
as they arise, must watch out for Ameri-'
can interests, vise passports and keep j
track of immigration records. Moreover,'
a consul must not only protect American
trade but must watch for opportunities for
furthering its interests. It is altogether a
real job, and a splendid achievement for
a woman."

Americans, it is said, need to enun
ciate more distinctly.
"A woman could hardly hold a more
difficult position than Frances Willis, '20,
now has as American vice-consul at Val
paraiso," said Professor Grtdiam Stuart
in an interview yesterday. "The west
coast of South America is especially iso
lated and her post is far removed from
Washington."
Frances Willis is one of the three out
standing women in our foreign service,
and the second to gain such an important
appointment in American, consular serv
ice. The others are Lucile Atchison, who
is secretary of legation at Geneva, and
Pattie Field, who is a vice-consul. Miss
Willis took her Ph.D. at Stanford. She
then taught history at Goucher College,
and later, political science at Vassar. Her
appointment is considered one of the best
openings of the year.
Use Merit Basis
Professor Stuart went on to discuss the
status of women in foreign service. "Dur
ing the last few years the foreign serv
ice has been judging all candidates strict
ly on a merit basis," he said. Frankly,
however, all other considerations being
equal, a woman usually has a harder time
getting in. At first, women were sent only
to posts where they were considered on
an equal basis with men. Our first wom
en in consular service were sent to Hol
land and Switzerland."
The idea of women holding important
positions in foreign service is not new.
Louis XIV was one of the first to place
this responsibility on a woman by sending
one as an ambassador to Poland. Later
a Russian woman, Kollontay, was sent to I
Norway. Here she achieved outstanding
distinction through a commercial treaty 1
which she negotiated with Norway. It j
was especially remarkable in that, in spite j
of great opposition, it secured practically 1
every advantage to Russia. In later years j
Uruguay and Bulgaria have intrusted
women with important consular and diplo- j
matic positions.
"More women enter foreign service as
clerks than as consuls or diplomats,"
stated Professor Stuart. "Many men have
advanced into foreign service proper from j
this position. It offers many opportunities j
for women."
"Another effective way for a woman j
to enter diplomatic service," he suggested,
"is to marry into diplomatic circles. There j
is no field in which family connections:
count for so much. Social duties con
stitute the main part of the diplomat'sj
life.
Examinations Stiff
"All applicants have to take examina- 1
tions, one written, which is held each year!
at certain centers throughout the United
States, and one oral, which takes place at!
Washington, D.C. These are extremely I
difficult, covering international law; one
modern language, which includes French,;
Spanish, or German; political economy;!
natural, industrial, and commercial re- 1
sources, one of the hardest and most j
stiffly rated; political and commercial
geography; American history, govern-1
ment, and institutions; and modern his- J
tory of Europe, Latin America, and the j
Far East."
