## Ten Events Are Included in Program Sponsored by Military Society 
### M. L. R 
Ten events are included in the pro
gram for the Ninth Annual R.O.T.C.
Horse Show, which will be held on the
Encina Polo Field at 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon, under the sponsorship of
Scabbard and Blade.
First in the order of events will be
the Roman Race, in which each con
testant stands on two horses. Ralph
Mossman, last year's winner, is the
favorite, although Wesley Cox and
'Tex" Thompson, also veterans from
last year, are expected to be strong
contenders.
Mystery Team Favored
In the Mounted Tug of War, which
comes next, a mysterious team going
under the name of the "Texans" is
reported to have the upper hand.
Charles Gorham and Wesley Cox
seem likely winners in the Pair Jump
ing event, riding "Gatley" and
"March."
Musical Chairs is the fourth event.
In the Half-Mile Race, which is one
of the most popular events, Irwin
Warner, on "Edwards," Jack Dales,
on "Haig," and Jo Bitterlin on "Con
ner," appear to bo the strongest con
tenders.
Wrestling Included
Mounted Wrestling comes sixth,
followed by the Cossack Race, in
which the contestants stand upright
in their stirrups which are crossed
over the saddle.
Military Jumping is eighth, and the
Horsemanship contest ninth. In the
latter a handsome silver cup Is at
stake, as "Tex" Thompson has won
this event for the past two years and
a third victory would mean his per
manent possession of the trophy.
Steeplechase Last
Concluding the show will be the
Steeplechase, after the traditional ,
English sport consisting of a one- j
mile course over eight jumps. Larry j
Weymouth, riding last year's winner,
"Austin," and Mard Black riding
"Lassiater" have been the favorites
in this event. However, the entry j
Thursday of A1 Goodspeed on "Blue"
means that they will have strong
competition.
All contestants in the show are re- j
quested by Lieutenant Whitmore to j
appear on the field in white shirts, |
for the sake of uniformity.
