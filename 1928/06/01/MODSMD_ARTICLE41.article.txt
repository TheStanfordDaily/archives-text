# Faculty Club Will Hold Monthly Meeting Tonight
## 
### 
The Faculty Club will hold its monthly
meeting at 8 o'clock tonight in the Fac
ulty Clubhouse. The meetings are social
and very informal.
The club has been in existence since
the opening of the University, and owns
seven or eight acres of land, billiard and
pool rooms, three tennis courts, and
bridge and chess rooms.

There are more college students in
America than in all other countries
combined.
