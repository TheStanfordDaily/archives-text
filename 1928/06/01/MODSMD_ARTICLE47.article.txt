Light in point of view, amusing in
lines, and offering opportunity for
varied characterization, "One of the
Family" is an excellent choice for the
1928 Senior Farce. George C. Warren,
dramatic critic on the Chronicle,
recommended it particularly for Stan
ford production.
In New York City, where it bad a
long and successful run, it played
first at the Forty-ninth Street Theatre,
and later moved to the Eltinge Thea
tre .Kay Johnson had the part of
Joyce Smith, the lead; and Grant
Mitchell played opposite her as Henry
Adams.
The plot is built up around the
amusing and sometimes distressing
situations which arise when too many
in-laws attempt to direct the activi
ties and ideas of a newly married
couple. Disturbances and difficulties
are bound to arise, as they do here,
and sometimes disaster. How serious
this can sometimes become is well,
and at the same time amusingly,
brought out.
The comedy is light clear through,
but this does not exclude opportunity
for moments of real tension and ex
citement, The family is taken care of
in quite a satisfactory manner at the
last, however, and the young wife
even gets rid o fthe wedding presents.
