# CHAPPIE TAKES POLICY OF EQUALITY OF SEXES
## 
### 
Chaparral's Parody Number, con
cluding issue of the year which will
appear on the Quad next Wednesday,
reflects a policy which the Old Boy
has, after due deliberation, adopted:
"Equality of the sexes is all right,
but we don't favor pants on women."
"For the ninth and last time, allow
me to insist that this is the year's
best issue of Chaparral," declared
Winston Norman, retiring editor.
"Norman is too modest," said Jack
Slioup, editor-elect. "It is undoubtedly
the best Issue of this or any year."
Robert Philippi drew the cover for
the number. It makes fun 6f the
graduating seniors, is entitled "Among
My Souvenirs," and uses daring color
combinations. The Issue contains nu
merous full-page features, among
them "Our Prehistoric Playmates,"
with verses by George F. Olsen
quaintly illustrated by Hardie Gram
atky. Another is the "Cobb's Corners
Clarion," parody of a country news
paper.
