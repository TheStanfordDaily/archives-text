# BOOKSTORE DIVIDENDS MAY BE PAID IF TAX DISPUTE IS SETTLED
## 
### 
Bookstore dividends may still be paid
this year, if the dispute over the income
tax is ended in favor of the store. The
argument has been going on for four or
five months and is still unsettled, with the
chances of outcome about even. In case
the store is forced to pay the eight years'
arrears of tax at Iper cent, it will be
unable to make returns.
Receipts will still be accepted and divi
dends paid by the private organization of
Leigh Thornton and William Hollings
worth, who have been giving 5 per cent
on the receipts this year.
