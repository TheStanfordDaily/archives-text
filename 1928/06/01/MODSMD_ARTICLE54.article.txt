# RYAN DEVOTES YEAR TO MEASUREMENT OF LABORATORY VOLTAGE
## 
### 
"This year our efforts have been
directed toward determining means
of measuring high voltages developed
by our equipment," declares Harris J.
Ryan, professor of electrical engineer
ing at the Ryan Laboratory. "For
merly facilities for the measurement
of such high voltages were lacking,
but lately we have met with success.
"At present we are engaged in the
study of the characteristic nature of
electric current discharges which oc
cur when the atmosphere about high
voltage conductors fails,"" he con
tinued. "Many of the 'spark-over" phe
nomena have been found to be identi
cal with those of lightning and thun
derstorms."
Ryan told of the lightning conserva
tory on Carson Spur, California, on
Kit Carson's old trail. Investigations
last summer proved that electricity
from a high voltage impulse generator
are the same as lightning flashes.
An anonymous patron lias given
some new equipment to the Ryan
Laboratory. It will be set up during
the summer, and will be ready for
use next year. It includes the con
struction of twelve towers.
