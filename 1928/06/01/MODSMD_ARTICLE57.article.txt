# ALARMS GET LONG REST Stanford Men Crave Sleep STORES SHOW LAZINESS
## 
### 
A large number of Stanford students
are linable to wrest themselves from the
soothing clasp of the sandman in time to
make their appearance at the various din
ing halls on the Campus, judging by
reports frorft the Cellar, the Roost, and
Encina Store.
The sleepy stragglers come into these
godsends at any hour of the morning.
The Cellar provides breakfast for an av
erage of forty people a day. The Roost
rescues many more from the pangs of
hunger, furnishing 250 cups of coffee,
twenty-five dozen doughnuts, and twenty
dozen snails daily. About 160 cups of
col Tee and twelve dozen "sinkers" is En
cina Store's contribution to the worthy
cause of nourishing those individuals who
simply have to stay in bed one more
minute.
