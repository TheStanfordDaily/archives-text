# SPORTS OF 1928
## A 						Fighting Champion 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
If more champions were like Tommy
Loughran, what a pleasant world this
would be for followers of fisticuffs!
While Bud Taylor is removed from the
bantamweight throne by the N.B.A. for
"inactivity," Tommy Loughran is pre
paring for a brace, and perhaps a trio of
battles in defense of his crown.
Signed by Humbert Fugazy to box
Pete Latzo, former welterweight cham
pion of the world, at Ebbets field, Brook
lyn, on May 30, Tommy must also meet
Jimmy Slattery, formerly recognized by
the National Boxing Association as light
heavy champion, on June 14, in a bout
sponsored by Tex Rickard at the Yankee
Stadium. The New York State Athletic
Commission has just ordered this date for
the bout, moving it back a week from the
original date, June 7. This leaves stand
ing Loughran's engagement to fight Leo
Lomski on June 13, but the State Com
mission will suggest to Fugazy that the
Lomski bout be postponed for about two

weeks. Loughran has been ordered to
post weight and appearance forfeits for
each of these three fights and he is liable
to suspension if he fails to fulfill any one
engagement.
The fight on May 30 shouldn't be so
tough, as Latzo is not a light-heavy
weight, and hasn't looked so good since he
lost his welterweight title to Joe Dundee.
Tom is itching to battle Jack Delaney—
would probably be glad to fight him for
nothing—and, after the French-Canuck's
one-round K.O. at the hands of Sharkey,
it seems there is no reason why he
shouldn't want to fight him. But Slattery
and Lomski, against both of whom he
defended his title last winter, are not set
ups by any stretch of the imagination.
Lomski, it will be remembered, had
Loughran on the floor twice in the first
round of their bout in the Garden.
Is Tommy worried? Didn't he beat the
tough Joe Sekyra in Louisville on May
18? He has to keep his hand in, you see 1

Is Tommy worried? Didn't he beat the
tough Joe Sekyra in Louisville on May
18? He has to keep his hand in, you see 1

If more champions were like Tommy
Loughran, what a pleasant world this
would be for followers of fisticuffs!
While Bud Taylor is removed from the
bantamweight throne by the N.B.A. for
"inactivity," Tommy Loughran is pre
paring for a brace, and perhaps a trio of
battles in defense of his crown.
Signed by Humbert Fugazy to box
Pete Latzo, former welterweight cham
pion of the world, at Ebbets field, Brook
lyn, on May 30, Tommy must also meet
Jimmy Slattery, formerly recognized by
the National Boxing Association as light
heavy champion, on June 14, in a bout
sponsored by Tex Rickard at the Yankee
Stadium. The New York State Athletic
Commission has just ordered this date for
the bout, moving it back a week from the
original date, June 7. This leaves stand
ing Loughran's engagement to fight Leo
Lomski on June 13, but the State Com
mission will suggest to Fugazy that the
Lomski bout be postponed for about two

weeks. Loughran has been ordered to
post weight and appearance forfeits for
each of these three fights and he is liable
to suspension if he fails to fulfill any one
engagement.
The fight on May 30 shouldn't be so
tough, as Latzo is not a light-heavy
weight, and hasn't looked so good since he
lost his welterweight title to Joe Dundee.
Tom is itching to battle Jack Delaney—
would probably be glad to fight him for
nothing—and, after the French-Canuck's
one-round K.O. at the hands of Sharkey,
it seems there is no reason why he
shouldn't want to fight him. But Slattery
and Lomski, against both of whom he
defended his title last winter, are not set
ups by any stretch of the imagination.
Lomski, it will be remembered, had
Loughran on the floor twice in the first
round of their bout in the Garden.
