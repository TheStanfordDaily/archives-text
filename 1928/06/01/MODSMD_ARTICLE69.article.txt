Professor Lutz will be prevented by
his work at the Stanford summer quarter

attend part of the sessions, and to deliver
a lecture on the work and facilities of the
Hoover War Library as a means of inter

Other lecturers will include several of the

Professor Stuart will lead the round
table on Latin-American affairs, and Pro

round table on international commerce.
The round tables will convene every
morning.

Daily afternoon conferences will con
sider such subjects as international edu
cation, research in international relations,
trade and finance, Great Britain and the
United States, and international social
and welfare work.
"The Institute has for its purpose,"
quoting the Executive Secretary, Dean
Charles E. Martin of the University of
Washington, "the serious study of the
problems involved in international rela
tions, in the belief that an understanding
of such problems is perhaps the greatest
single need of the present decade. It is
an attempt to provide for the people of
the Pacific Coast such opportunities for
instruction and discussion as are provided
through the Institute uf Politics at Wil
liamstown, Massachusetts, and the Insti
tute of Pacific Relations at Honolulu,
Hawaii."

"Fireproof," a movie, has just been
released by amateurs in Minneapolis
and St. Paul.
