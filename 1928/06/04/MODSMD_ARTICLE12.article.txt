# TENTATIVE DEBATING SCHEDULE INDICATES BUSY FORENSIC YEAR
## 
### 
Stanford is to have a busy year in
debating next year, for besides meet
ings with U.S.C., Cal-Tech, and Oc
cidental, there will probably be de
bates with Australia, Oregon, Wash
ington, and California, says Steve
Halsted, next year's debate manager.
A tentative schedule was arranged
by Halsted during a visit to some of
the colleges in Southern California
last week. He is also enthusiastic
over the possible adoption of a squad
system for men's debating next year.
This system is in use and works very
successfully at U.S.C., Cal-Tech, and
Occidental, Halsted reports. Fall
quarter a meeting of all men debaters
will be held to discuss the inaugura
tion of a debate squad system.
All men who participated in debat
ing this year are requested by Pro
fessor James G. Emerson to send him
their names and summer addresses
this week. Installation of a tryoutee
system for debate manager will begin
fall quarter.
