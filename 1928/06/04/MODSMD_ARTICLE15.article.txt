# CARDINAL ATHLETES WILL STRIVE FOR GLORY OF U. S. STANFORD DURING SUMMER MONTHS
## King, Kibby Surpass Former Marks in N.Y. Athletic Club Track Meet Team Entrains For Chicago To Clash With Middle Western Squads 
### Bob Speers 
Two Stanford men did big things
last Saturday afternoon in the annual
spring games of the New York Ath
letic Club at the club track on
Travers Island. They were Bob King
and Leo Kibby, both of whom sur
passed all their previous marks. King
cleared 6 feet 6 inches in the high
jump, and Kibby hurled the javelin
209 feet.
Though most of Templeton's men
were below their season averages,
the Cardinals took four first places.
No team scores were compiled, and
the contest was made erratic by the
system of handicaps used.
Kibby Is Surprise
Kibby surprised everyone, perhaps
including himself, at his mark-setting
throw. Bill Sparling, with a second
best throw of 196 feet 11% inches,
was given third. Despite handicaps,
Kim Dyer leaped 24 feet 6 5-8 inches
for first place in the broad jump.
Five thousand spectators, interested
primarily in watching Kric Krenz and
Harlow Rothert perform, were dis
appointed when the young weight
stars failed to approach their 1.C.4-A.
marks in shot or discus.
Weight Men Disappoint
Because of handicaps neither man
placed in the shot, though Rothert
tossed 47 feet 6% inches and Krenz
threw 46 feet 7% inches. Krenz won
the discus at 145 feet. Rothert
heaved the platter 125 feet 11V4
inches which, with a 15-foot allow
ance, gave him third. A1 Forster, with
the aid of a 2%-foot handicap, placed
second in the shot.
Captain Bud Spencer, not yet in
form, was second to Joe Tierney, for
mer Holy Cross star, in the 440. The
time was 48 4-5. Ross Nichols won
his heat in the high hurdles but
tripped in the final and failed to place.
Clarence West took second.
Prepare For Chicago Meet
Templeton's team is staying at the
New York Athletic Club Spring Sports
Clubhouse at Travers Island, and will
remain there until Thursday morning,
when the team will entrain for Chi
cago and the N.C.A. meet to compete
against the powerful middle western
squads that did not enter the 1.C.4-A.
The Cards leave Chicago Sunday
afternoon for Bowdoin College, in
Brunswick, Maine, where they will
train until the American Olympic
team tryouts to be held in Boston
July 6 and 7.
