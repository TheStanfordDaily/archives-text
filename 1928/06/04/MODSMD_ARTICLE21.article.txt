### Burnell Gould 
Sons of the Stanford Red will bid
for places in the athletic sun this
summer, as representatives in four
sports compete for honors in three
parts of the known world, while Stan
ford coaches will aid in building a
United States victory at Amsterdam.
With Cardinal track and field men
aspiring for berths on the American
team for the Olympic Games, with
Stanford ansl ex-Stanford swimmers
and divers foremost in tryouts for the
international competition at Amster
dam, with the Redshirt baseball team"
carrying the Cardinal colors in a
barnstorming tour of Australia and
New Zealand via Hawaii and Samoa,
and with two local tennis stars mov
ing from tournament to tournament
on the Atlantic Coast, the name of
Stanford should be blazoned in large
letters across the world's sport page
for 1928.
Stanford Sends Coaches
Two coaches, Ernst Brandsten and
Dink Templeton, will assist in pre
paring the United States Olympic
teams. Brandsten will be head coach
of the American divers for the Games,
while the "boy wonder" will assist
Lawson Robertson wit hthe American
track and field squad for the interna
tional battle.
Triumphant in the T.C.4-A. meet at
Cambridge, the Stanford spikesters
are keeping in trim, through the me
dium of the New York Athletic Club
meet, held Saturday at Travers Island,
and the N.C.A. clash with middle
western squads at Chicago next Sat
j urday, for the Olympic Games tryouts
| at Boston, June 6 and 7.
Trackmen Show Promise
I Captain Bud Spencer, brilliant
i quarter-miler, who smashed the long
standing record of Ted Meredith in
! the 400-metre race, making the dis
tance in 47 seconds; Eric Krenz and
j Harlow Itothert, hefty weight tossers;
Ward Edmonds, potential record
! breaker in the pole vault; Ross Nich
' ols, flashy timber-topper, and his
! hurdling teammate, Clarence West;
j Bob King, who is topping 6'6" in the
high jump; and Bill Sparling and Leo
Kibby, both of whom have flung the
javelin more than 200 feet —all will
be strong contenders for the Ameri
can team.
Divers Will Compete
Pete Desjardins, *31, A1 White, '25,
| and Dave Fall, '27, will undoubtedly
: be at the fore in the diving events for
i the Games. Desjardins will be after
! the title which A1 White captured in
1924. Desjardins has won the national
title for the fourth successive time,
and will be a distinct threat to White
in the fancy springboard events, just
as Dave Fall will offer real competi
tion in the fancy platform diving.
Herb Marsh, promising freshman, and
Ed Throndson, platform star, will also
try out.
Stanford will send two men —Reg-
gie Harrison and Ogden Driggs—to
the Games on the water polo team.
The pair were with Captain Cal
Strong's agua agitators who won the
national intercollegiate water polo
title this year. Strong will not go to
Amsterdam. Driggs plans to enter the
Junior National Mile Swim at Fleish
hacker Pool next week-end. If he fails
to make the team on his performance
there, he will go as alternate with the
American water poloists.
Leave For Australia
Coach Harry Wolters' fast team will
meet the best nines in the Pacific
Archipelago during the summer, re
turning September 13. Though Cap
tain Cook Sypher (who is now with
the Mission Bells), John Sobieski, and
Bob Sims will not make the trip the
Cardinals will have a strong squad.
Four effective pitchers—Gene Kern,
Bob Philippi, Doug Lewis, and Rudy
Riese will bolster the Card nine, with
Harry Berg and Roger Paxton ready
to receive their assorted slants. The
1928 Stanford infield —Bill Maguire,
first base; Don Garibaldi, second

base; Jimmy Busch, shortstop; and
Bill Laird, third base, along with the
outfield of Jack Levin, Frank Wilton,
and Spud Harder, will complete the
playing squad.
Netmen To Go East
Pacific Coast singles and doubles
champions, A1 Herrington and Ralph
McElvenny, will seek new tennis
honors in the East, leaving the cam
pus a week from Tuesday for the na
tional intercollegiates at the Merion
Cricket Club in Philadelphia June 25.
The Stanford racquet experts will
then compete in major tournaments
on the Atlantic seaboard, ending their
season in September with the nation
al singles and doubles competition at
Forest Hills, New York.

Pete Desjardins, *31, A1 White, '25,

: be at the fore in the diving events for
i the Games. Desjardins will be after
! the title which A1 White captured in

title for the fourth successive time,
and will be a distinct threat to White
in the fancy springboard events, just
as Dave Fall will offer real competi

Herb Marsh, promising freshman, and
Ed Throndson, platform star, will also

Stanford will send two men —Reg-

carrying the Cardinal colors in a
barnstorming tour of Australia and
New Zealand via Hawaii and Samoa,
and with two local tennis stars mov
ing from tournament to tournament

Dink Templeton, will assist in pre

Trackmen Show Promise
I Captain Bud Spencer, brilliant
i quarter-miler, who smashed the long
standing record of Ted Meredith in
! the 400-metre race, making the dis
tance in 47 seconds; Eric Krenz and
j Harlow Itothert, hefty weight tossers;
Ward Edmonds, potential record
! breaker in the pole vault; Ross Nich
' ols, flashy timber-topper, and his
! hurdling teammate, Clarence West;
j Bob King, who is topping 6'6" in the
high jump; and Bill Sparling and Leo
Kibby, both of whom have flung the
javelin more than 200 feet —all will
be strong contenders for the Ameri
can team.
Divers Will Compete
Pete Desjardins, *31, A1 White, '25,
| and Dave Fall, '27, will undoubtedly
: be at the fore in the diving events for
i the Games. Desjardins will be after
! the title which A1 White captured in
1924. Desjardins has won the national
title for the fourth successive time,
and will be a distinct threat to White
in the fancy springboard events, just
as Dave Fall will offer real competi
tion in the fancy platform diving.
Herb Marsh, promising freshman, and
Ed Throndson, platform star, will also
try out.
Stanford will send two men —Reg-
gie Harrison and Ogden Driggs—to
the Games on the water polo team.
The pair were with Captain Cal
Strong's agua agitators who won the
national intercollegiate water polo
title this year. Strong will not go to
Amsterdam. Driggs plans to enter the
Junior National Mile Swim at Fleish
hacker Pool next week-end. If he fails
to make the team on his performance
there, he will go as alternate with the
American water poloists.
Leave For Australia
Coach Harry Wolters' fast team will
meet the best nines in the Pacific
