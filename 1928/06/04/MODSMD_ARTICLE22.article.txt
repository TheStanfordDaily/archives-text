# FAVORABLE WEATHER FOR FLIGHT AWAITED BY WOMAN, TWO MEN
## 
### 
HALIFAX, N.S., June 3.— (U.P.)—
Two men and a woman, all experi
enced aviators, were waiting here to
night for favorable weather in which
to attempt a flight across the Atlantic
Ocean from Newfoundland to London.
They hope to land on the Thames
River.
The three are Wilmer Stultz, one of
the best-known of American aviators,
Miss Amelia Earhart, a Boston avia
trix who has a record of 500 flying
hours, and Lew Gordon, mechanic.
They will fly in the big tri-motored
Fokker plane (equipped with pon
toons) which Commander Richard E.
Byrd had intended using on his flight
to the South Pole.
The trio arrived here this evening
completely unannounced, landing with
the help of their pontoons just out
side Halifax. A heavy bank of fog
was responsible for the landing here.
As Stultz, Miss Earhart, and Gor
don were welcomed they refused at
first to admit the nature of their
flight, stating merely that they were
en route to St. Johns, N.F., to take
on more fuel when the fog forced
them down.
Dispatches from New York, how
ever, tended to confirm reports they
were starting a transatlantic flight
and Stultz finally admitted such were
his plans.
