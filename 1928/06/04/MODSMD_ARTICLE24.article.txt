Oscar Wilde once wrote a book entitled, "Dorian Gray.".. Now
Dorian was a beautiful young man, so beautiful that an artist friend of
his wanted to paint his picture. The picture was painted, giving all the
youth and freshness of Dorian, who was at the time spotless, clear-souled,
tranquil. We forget just why, but after the picture was done, he started
to "run the gauntlet," in a little different sense than Dr. Jordan uses the
term. He started a life of debauchery and wickedness. One day he
noticed that the picture was beginning to show signs of a smirk, and lie
rushed to the mirror to look at himself. looking back at him was the
same clear-eyed Dorian that had always been.
So he watched the picture, and as he became more and more disso
lute, the picture of himself became more hideous and terrible. He hid
the picture, and tried to keep away from it, but he was fascinated and
could not stay away. Finally, after years of crime, he did something
just a bit worse than ever before. His own features remained the same,
but lie went up to the picture, and it had become such a monstrosity,
euch a gruesome, gory gargoyle of a human being he could stand it no
longer. He took a dagger and ripped the thing to pieces. His servants
heard a blood-curdling scream and rushed to the room. They found the
destroyed picture, with a grisly, life-eaten old man lying dead before it.
This is a pretty strong comparison to draw, but the editor minds the
time he started in here as a freshman, fresh (and how), innocent (we
hope), guileless (oh my). As the four years have rolled themselves off
one by one, he has watched other members of the Class of '28 grow old
and feeble, and has had a feeling of superiority that he was staying young
and enthusiastic as ever.
But now as the last Daily goes to press, the final days approach, he
looks at the picture again and sees that the picture has all those marks of
age and decrepitude. This paper is his dagger, and today as it comes
out you hear his final wail. Tomorrow he will be a hoary, white-whiskered
old has-been.
However, we understand that a man falling from a precipice, or in
his last few minutes, thinks back over all the events of his life in just
those few moments. Let us look back.
When we started in, this was a six-column paper called The Daily
Palo Alto being published by the students of Stanford University five
afternoons a week. Not long afterwards, this paper was changed to a
morning edition with seven columns. The change allowed more timely
news to be run, for much that occurs of interest to the campus happens
late in the afternoon or in the evening. It also gave the students a
better appearing newspaper.
Last spring, after years of becoming confused with the Palo Alto
Times, the name of the publication was changed from The Daily Palo
Alto to The Stanford Daily. Obviously, this was a great improve
ment. The old name started in the days when it was the style to name
a paper after a flower or tree, or some such thing, and the Palo Alto tree
struck the esthetically inclined as being appropriate. Well, that day has
passed. Now we have a paper that people know is published at Stanford.
Then again last fall, another addition was made. World and national
news became a regular feature, in order that the students might obtain
a brief summary of the more important current events, without reading
over volumes of daily papers. This spring, a pictorial section was first
run, to break away from too complete similarity of issues. It has been,
thus, a gradual evolution to a larger, newsier, more representative, more
interesting Daily.
As to editorial policy, the bright young fella has had the idea that in
general things work out pretty well without too much blowing, but at
times a little wind is necessary. So he has tried not to blow when rain
wasn't needed, but to whisk the clouds over the barren spots, when the
ground seemed too dry, or the crops were beginning to burn. Sometimes
there hasn't been enough rain, sometimes too much. We can look back,
however, and see that there haven't been any real famines, or plagues.
And now, with our last breath, we should like to call the children to
our bedside, and ask them to remember that many jobs are necessarily
left unfinished. They inherit the fortune, the means of finishing or
continuing the work on those jobs. But we also ask them to remember
not to take student government too seriously and not to blush with shame
at every criticism.
And then we ask the children to tell those old friends that we have
enjoyed knowing them, and having them tell us our faults.
With these few words we give our final gasp, and leave the remains
to be picked up and carted away to the place where all good (or bad—
because they all go the same way) editors go.

continuing the work on those jobs. But we also ask them to remember
not to take student government too seriously and not to blush with shame
at every criticism.
And then we ask the children to tell those old friends that we have
enjoyed knowing them, and having them tell us our faults.
With these few words we give our final gasp, and leave the remains
to be picked up and carted away to the place where all good (or bad—
because they all go the same way) editors go.

Oscar Wilde once wrote a book entitled, "Dorian Gray.".. Now
Dorian was a beautiful young man, so beautiful that an artist friend of
his wanted to paint his picture. The picture was painted, giving all the
youth and freshness of Dorian, who was at the time spotless, clear-souled,
tranquil. We forget just why, but after the picture was done, he started
to "run the gauntlet," in a little different sense than Dr. Jordan uses the
term. He started a life of debauchery and wickedness. One day he
noticed that the picture was beginning to show signs of a smirk, and lie
rushed to the mirror to look at himself. looking back at him was the
same clear-eyed Dorian that had always been.
So he watched the picture, and as he became more and more disso
lute, the picture of himself became more hideous and terrible. He hid
the picture, and tried to keep away from it, but he was fascinated and
could not stay away. Finally, after years of crime, he did something
just a bit worse than ever before. His own features remained the same,
but lie went up to the picture, and it had become such a monstrosity,
euch a gruesome, gory gargoyle of a human being he could stand it no
longer. He took a dagger and ripped the thing to pieces. His servants
heard a blood-curdling scream and rushed to the room. They found the
destroyed picture, with a grisly, life-eaten old man lying dead before it.
This is a pretty strong comparison to draw, but the editor minds the
time he started in here as a freshman, fresh (and how), innocent (we
hope), guileless (oh my). As the four years have rolled themselves off
one by one, he has watched other members of the Class of '28 grow old
and feeble, and has had a feeling of superiority that he was staying young
and enthusiastic as ever.
But now as the last Daily goes to press, the final days approach, he
looks at the picture again and sees that the picture has all those marks of
age and decrepitude. This paper is his dagger, and today as it comes
out you hear his final wail. Tomorrow he will be a hoary, white-whiskered
old has-been.
However, we understand that a man falling from a precipice, or in
his last few minutes, thinks back over all the events of his life in just
those few moments. Let us look back.
When we started in, this was a six-column paper called The Daily
Palo Alto being published by the students of Stanford University five
afternoons a week. Not long afterwards, this paper was changed to a
morning edition with seven columns. The change allowed more timely
news to be run, for much that occurs of interest to the campus happens
late in the afternoon or in the evening. It also gave the students a
better appearing newspaper.
Last spring, after years of becoming confused with the Palo Alto
Times, the name of the publication was changed from The Daily Palo
Alto to The Stanford Daily. Obviously, this was a great improve
ment. The old name started in the days when it was the style to name
a paper after a flower or tree, or some such thing, and the Palo Alto tree
struck the esthetically inclined as being appropriate. Well, that day has
passed. Now we have a paper that people know is published at Stanford.
Then again last fall, another addition was made. World and national
news became a regular feature, in order that the students might obtain
a brief summary of the more important current events, without reading
over volumes of daily papers. This spring, a pictorial section was first
run, to break away from too complete similarity of issues. It has been,
thus, a gradual evolution to a larger, newsier, more representative, more
interesting Daily.
As to editorial policy, the bright young fella has had the idea that in
general things work out pretty well without too much blowing, but at
times a little wind is necessary. So he has tried not to blow when rain
wasn't needed, but to whisk the clouds over the barren spots, when the
ground seemed too dry, or the crops were beginning to burn. Sometimes
there hasn't been enough rain, sometimes too much. We can look back,
however, and see that there haven't been any real famines, or plagues.
And now, with our last breath, we should like to call the children to
our bedside, and ask them to remember that many jobs are necessarily
left unfinished. They inherit the fortune, the means of finishing or
continuing the work on those jobs. But we also ask them to remember
not to take student government too seriously and not to blush with shame

wasn't needed, but to whisk the clouds over the barren spots, when the
ground seemed too dry, or the crops were beginning to burn. Sometimes
there hasn't been enough rain, sometimes too much. We can look back,
however, and see that there haven't been any real famines, or plagues.
And now, with our last breath, we should like to call the children to
our bedside, and ask them to remember that many jobs are necessarily
left unfinished. They inherit the fortune, the means of finishing or
continuing the work on those jobs. But we also ask them to remember
not to take student government too seriously and not to blush with shame
at every criticism.
And then we ask the children to tell those old friends that we have
enjoyed knowing them, and having them tell us our faults.
With these few words we give our final gasp, and leave the remains
to be picked up and carted away to the place where all good (or bad—
because they all go the same way) editors go.

Oscar Wilde once wrote a book entitled, "Dorian Gray.".. Now
Dorian was a beautiful young man, so beautiful that an artist friend of
his wanted to paint his picture. The picture was painted, giving all the
youth and freshness of Dorian, who was at the time spotless, clear-souled,
tranquil. We forget just why, but after the picture was done, he started
to "run the gauntlet," in a little different sense than Dr. Jordan uses the
term. He started a life of debauchery and wickedness. One day he
noticed that the picture was beginning to show signs of a smirk, and lie
rushed to the mirror to look at himself. looking back at him was the
same clear-eyed Dorian that had always been.
So he watched the picture, and as he became more and more disso
lute, the picture of himself became more hideous and terrible. He hid
the picture, and tried to keep away from it, but he was fascinated and
could not stay away. Finally, after years of crime, he did something
just a bit worse than ever before. His own features remained the same,
but lie went up to the picture, and it had become such a monstrosity,
euch a gruesome, gory gargoyle of a human being he could stand it no
longer. He took a dagger and ripped the thing to pieces. His servants
heard a blood-curdling scream and rushed to the room. They found the
destroyed picture, with a grisly, life-eaten old man lying dead before it.
This is a pretty strong comparison to draw, but the editor minds the
time he started in here as a freshman, fresh (and how), innocent (we
hope), guileless (oh my). As the four years have rolled themselves off
one by one, he has watched other members of the Class of '28 grow old
and feeble, and has had a feeling of superiority that he was staying young
and enthusiastic as ever.
But now as the last Daily goes to press, the final days approach, he
looks at the picture again and sees that the picture has all those marks of
age and decrepitude. This paper is his dagger, and today as it comes
out you hear his final wail. Tomorrow he will be a hoary, white-whiskered
old has-been.
However, we understand that a man falling from a precipice, or in
his last few minutes, thinks back over all the events of his life in just
those few moments. Let us look back.
When we started in, this was a six-column paper called The Daily
Palo Alto being published by the students of Stanford University five
afternoons a week. Not long afterwards, this paper was changed to a
morning edition with seven columns. The change allowed more timely
news to be run, for much that occurs of interest to the campus happens
late in the afternoon or in the evening. It also gave the students a
better appearing newspaper.
Last spring, after years of becoming confused with the Palo Alto
Times, the name of the publication was changed from The Daily Palo
Alto to The Stanford Daily. Obviously, this was a great improve
ment. The old name started in the days when it was the style to name
a paper after a flower or tree, or some such thing, and the Palo Alto tree
struck the esthetically inclined as being appropriate. Well, that day has
passed. Now we have a paper that people know is published at Stanford.
Then again last fall, another addition was made. World and national
news became a regular feature, in order that the students might obtain
a brief summary of the more important current events, without reading
over volumes of daily papers. This spring, a pictorial section was first
run, to break away from too complete similarity of issues. It has been,
thus, a gradual evolution to a larger, newsier, more representative, more
interesting Daily.
As to editorial policy, the bright young fella has had the idea that in
general things work out pretty well without too much blowing, but at
times a little wind is necessary. So he has tried not to blow when rain
wasn't needed, but to whisk the clouds over the barren spots, when the
ground seemed too dry, or the crops were beginning to burn. Sometimes
