RANDOM IMPRESSIONS OF A
COLLEGE EDUCATON
I
While yet a participant we feel
moved to make a few remarks on the
great American education system.
Looking back over eight years of
grammar school, four years of high
school, and four years of university,
we can find one impression which
holds for the entire sixteen years:
the grand old idea of "Keep in step!"
In grammar school, keeping in step
meant going no faster than the pace
set by the members of the class. High
school was much the same: junior
babbittism, petty virtue, and "Yes, yes
teacher" stuff being the order of the
day. The password to a principal's
recommendation for college was "I
kept in step."
In college the song is written in a
different key and the words are dif
ferent, but it is still something of the
same tune. College students are a
painfully conservative group, all opin
ions of the general public to the con
trary. They live in a more free and
independent atmosphere than that of
the high school, to be sure, but in ao
atmosphere which, nevertheless, is
not nearly as free, as independent, as
}<een, and as liberal as it should be.
The mark of the lockstep is still
plainly visible.
II
Too many college courses fall short
of their inherent possibilities. Some
times the matter is too dry, but most
often the professor is at fault. Either
his personality is inadequate, his
grasp of the subject is inadequate, or,
though possibly an expert in his line,
he lacks the ability to put it across
to his students.
Looking back at the end of the
senior year only a few of the thirty
to fifty courses taken in the four
years stand out, and some make so
little impression that they are re
called with difficulty or not at all.
111
Most everybody, at one time or the
other, is convinced that the college
grading "system" is not all that it
might be. While in general the good,
the virtuous, the energetic are re
warded, and the bad, the "night-be
fore-Phi-Betes," and those whose pens

run dry in an ex are punished, there
are times when such is not the case,
particularly under the student cor
rector plan.
Mere grades lost lustre in our eyes
two years ago when, in wide-eyed
wonder, we watched a corrector slash
his way through some History 11
papers. It was still early in the eve
ning, about 11 o'clock, when he said
savagely: "Well, it's all right for
those whose papers come now, but I
sure pity those I get along about 2
or 3 o'clock in the morning."
IV
Prospective college students might
well prepare for college by eating in
a lumber camp or on tramp steamer
for six months; then they would not
be disappointed in the food they will
have set before them during their
four years' sojourn in collegiana.
This feature of collegiate existence
should receive more attention. What
is needed is not more can-openers but
more scientific knowledge on the se
lection and preparation of food —and
a little imagination in the kitchen! It
is strange that people who are sup
posed to be so intelligent can put up
with such unintelligent cooking.
V
The college campus, and this is par
ticularly so with Stanford, haß an op
portunity to develop a distinctive and
delightful social life. It is to be re
gretted that the present currents of
our social activity run toward off
campus attractions.
VI
Our idea of a successful college
education is one that can measure up
to this quotation from James Harvey
Robinson:
"Of all human ambitions an
open mind eagerly expectant of
new discoveries and ready to re
mould convictions in the light of
added knowledge and dispelled
ignorance and misapprehensions,
is the noblest, rarest, and most
difficult to achieve."
We have objected to the dull con
| servatism of the Stanford campus in
; the past and we object to it now be
cause we believe that it tends to de
feat this ideal of an open mind, cor
rectly described as "the noblest of
human ambitions."

RANDOM IMPRESSIONS OF A

While yet a participant we feel
moved to make a few remarks on the
great American education system.
Looking back over eight years of
grammar school, four years of high
school, and four years of university,
we can find one impression which
holds for the entire sixteen years:
the grand old idea of "Keep in step!"
In grammar school, keeping in step
meant going no faster than the pace
set by the members of the class. High
school was much the same: junior
babbittism, petty virtue, and "Yes, yes
teacher" stuff being the order of the
day. The password to a principal's
recommendation for college was "I
kept in step."
In college the song is written in a
different key and the words are dif
ferent, but it is still something of the
same tune. College students are a
painfully conservative group, all opin
ions of the general public to the con
trary. They live in a more free and
independent atmosphere than that of
the high school, to be sure, but in ao
atmosphere which, nevertheless, is
not nearly as free, as independent, as
}<een, and as liberal as it should be.
The mark of the lockstep is still
plainly visible.
II
Too many college courses fall short
of their inherent possibilities. Some
times the matter is too dry, but most
often the professor is at fault. Either
his personality is inadequate, his
grasp of the subject is inadequate, or,
though possibly an expert in his line,
he lacks the ability to put it across
to his students.
Looking back at the end of the
senior year only a few of the thirty
to fifty courses taken in the four
years stand out, and some make so
little impression that they are re
called with difficulty or not at all.
111
Most everybody, at one time or the
other, is convinced that the college
grading "system" is not all that it
might be. While in general the good,
the virtuous, the energetic are re
warded, and the bad, the "night-be
fore-Phi-Betes," and those whose pens

run dry in an ex are punished, there
are times when such is not the case,
particularly under the student cor
rector plan.
Mere grades lost lustre in our eyes
two years ago when, in wide-eyed
wonder, we watched a corrector slash

ferent, but it is still something of the
same tune. College students are a
painfully conservative group, all opin
ions of the general public to the con
trary. They live in a more free and
independent atmosphere than that of
the high school, to be sure, but in ao
atmosphere which, nevertheless, is
not nearly as free, as independent, as
}<een, and as liberal as it should be.
The mark of the lockstep is still
plainly visible.

Too many college courses fall short
of their inherent possibilities. Some
times the matter is too dry, but most
often the professor is at fault. Either
his personality is inadequate, his
grasp of the subject is inadequate, or,
though possibly an expert in his line,
he lacks the ability to put it across
to his students.
Looking back at the end of the
senior year only a few of the thirty
to fifty courses taken in the four
years stand out, and some make so
little impression that they are re
called with difficulty or not at all.

Most everybody, at one time or the
other, is convinced that the college
grading "system" is not all that it
might be. While in general the good,
the virtuous, the energetic are re
warded, and the bad, the "night-be
fore-Phi-Betes," and those whose pens

run dry in an ex are punished, there
are times when such is not the case,
particularly under the student cor
rector plan.
Mere grades lost lustre in our eyes
two years ago when, in wide-eyed
wonder, we watched a corrector slash
his way through some History 11
papers. It was still early in the eve
ning, about 11 o'clock, when he said
savagely: "Well, it's all right for
those whose papers come now, but I
sure pity those I get along about 2
or 3 o'clock in the morning."

Prospective college students might
well prepare for college by eating in
a lumber camp or on tramp steamer
for six months; then they would not
be disappointed in the food they will
have set before them during their
four years' sojourn in collegiana.
This feature of collegiate existence
should receive more attention. What
is needed is not more can-openers but
more scientific knowledge on the se
lection and preparation of food —and
a little imagination in the kitchen! It
is strange that people who are sup
posed to be so intelligent can put up
with such unintelligent cooking.

The college campus, and this is par
ticularly so with Stanford, haß an op
portunity to develop a distinctive and
delightful social life. It is to be re
gretted that the present currents of
our social activity run toward off
campus attractions.

Our idea of a successful college
education is one that can measure up
to this quotation from James Harvey
Robinson:
"Of all human ambitions an
open mind eagerly expectant of
new discoveries and ready to re
mould convictions in the light of
added knowledge and dispelled
ignorance and misapprehensions,
is the noblest, rarest, and most
difficult to achieve."
We have objected to the dull con
| servatism of the Stanford campus in
; the past and we object to it now be
cause we believe that it tends to de
feat this ideal of an open mind, cor
rectly described as "the noblest of
human ambitions."
