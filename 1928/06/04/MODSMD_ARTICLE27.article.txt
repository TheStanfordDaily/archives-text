"The Constant Wife." Curran The
atre.
This is a high society comedy of
the smartest and most sophisticated
type;'finely turned epigrams are nu
merous in all three acts. Written by
W. Somerset Maugham, it is bound
to be clever, as those who remember
his "Lady Frederick" and "The Cir
cle" will realize.
Ethel Barrymore as the fascinating
and ultra-modern wife is beyond criti
cism, except of the most complimen
tary kind. Her diction is particularly
splendid; at all times she is the per
fect actress. The play centers around
her role, and she gets all the subtle
sayings over extremely well. The
story starts out like the usual tri
angle plot, but the wise wife settles
the waves that threaten the matri
monial ship by adding a fourth angle.
"Yesterday's mutton can never be
made over into tomorrow's lamb
chops," she assures her husband
when he tries to re-establish friendly
relations. And again, "I may be an
unfaithful wife, but no divorce for
me —I shall always be constant," she
admonishes the muchly - squelched
man. According to her figuring, happy

marriages result when husband and
wife fall out of love at the same time.
This reasoning is unique, but vastly
entertaining.
Supporting the star is the original
New York cast. We advise you to
see this highly polished comedy of
the year.

"Sunrise." St. Francis Theatre.
Very urgently requested to review
his new Fox super-picture, we saw
it again to determine if it was as
Tood as we thought when we saw it
it high prices in Los Angeles last
Christmas. Although we are taking a
errific risk, because of the widely
divergent opinions as to its worth,
we say that in our opinion it is way
above the average. The direction is
excellent, Janet Gaynor and George
O'Brien are fine in the stellar roles.
We particularly liked "Sunrise" be
cause at all times the characters are
subordinated to the story—which is a
very human and interesting one. The
Fox Movietone accompaniment is not
so good as an orchestra, but all in all
this is one of the best pictures we
have ever seen.
