# AND THENOUR LITTLE SALLY

### 
I think the week just before finals
is more fun than a picnic. I mean, so
many nice little systems get shocks
and are all upset. I wonder if profes
sors really have such hilarious senses
of humor as they seem to have.
A philosophy course helps a lot
around this time. That is, one begins
to appreciate so many new things.
And you can't help but realize that
after all, skepticism is a lazy attitude.
But I don't understand some peo
ple at all. They start going to church
and they almost pray. Why, what
good is religion in a case like finals?
It would Boom that peoplo only got
that way when they are in trouble.
And even if one could get facts and
things right out of the air, most peo
ple wouldn't know how to go about
putting them down on paper. I mean,
luck may be faith, but who ever gots
a break unlesß ho has angled for it?
But I think most p«oplo would ap
preciate not having examinations at

all. It would be so much easier on
everyone. The correctors wouldn't
have to bother reading silly papers.
And it is getting too warm to ap
preciate much except out-of-doors,
and gnats and mosquitoes are such
good company.
