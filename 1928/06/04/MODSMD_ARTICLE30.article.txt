The Editor, Sir:
You are right, B. and S. Women's
dancing at Stanford can stand im
provement and should get it.
But there is another angle to this
problem. The women at least recog
nize that they must above all be good
dancers if they want to "rate." In all
probability 9 out of 10 cases of the
"toe riders" to which the last campus
opiner refers is due to an inherent
capacity for dancing.
There isn't must question about
women not desiring to be good
dancers. They want to badly enough,
but some of them are simply not
built for it. It is with them a con
stitutional handicap—and they are not
to blame. They would certainly have
it differently if they could.
On the other hand, how much of
the men's poor dancing is due to
sheer indifference, we wonder —to a
deliberate refusal to acknowledge it
essentially. That is what hurts. Can
the men understand this? It should
remove the greatest part of the sting
from the previous criticisms of their
dancing, for it implies that they are
inferior from choice, not from neces
sity (as are the women, poor things).
It is not that Stanford women are
complaining of rotten dancers so
much that they are distinctly out
of sympathy with the attitude of so
many men toward dancing—an atti
tude which can be interpreted only as
a result of laziness, or conceit, or a
lack of sense of values.
It is this last point which really
matters, and which will undoubtedly
be most challenged.
This is what we maintain: That
possession of a proper sense of values
means a clear recognition of the
necessity of participating in the so
cial life of the college, that dancing
is the biggest factor in the social life
on this campus. Therefore, a poor
dancer is a failure socially—and fails
to a corresponding extent in his edu
cation.

opiner refers is due to an inherent
capacity for dancing.
There isn't must question about
women not desiring to be good
dancers. They want to badly enough,
but some of them are simply not
built for it. It is with them a con
stitutional handicap—and they are not
to blame. They would certainly have
it differently if they could.
On the other hand, how much of
the men's poor dancing is due to
sheer indifference, we wonder —to a
deliberate refusal to acknowledge it
essentially. That is what hurts. Can
the men understand this? It should
remove the greatest part of the sting
from the previous criticisms of their
dancing, for it implies that they are
inferior from choice, not from neces
sity (as are the women, poor things).
It is not that Stanford women are
complaining of rotten dancers so
much that they are distinctly out
of sympathy with the attitude of so
many men toward dancing—an atti
tude which can be interpreted only as
a result of laziness, or conceit, or a
lack of sense of values.
It is this last point which really
matters, and which will undoubtedly
be most challenged.
This is what we maintain: That
possession of a proper sense of values
means a clear recognition of the
necessity of participating in the so
cial life of the college, that dancing
is the biggest factor in the social life
on this campus. Therefore, a poor
dancer is a failure socially—and fails
to a corresponding extent in his edu
cation.
