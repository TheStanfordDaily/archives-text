# UNIVERSITY, 'LINDY' GET SOUND RAZZING IN JUNE CHAPARRAL
## 
### 
Stanford University, Colonel Lind
bergh, and various other well-known
institutions do not escape a razzing
in the June Chappie, which will go on
sale either Wednesday or Thursday
of this weok. Fraternity newspapers
take a beating, and throughout the
issue various forms of advertising are
lampooned.
Another parody is the "Cobb's Cor
ner Clarion," tabloid edition of a
quaint country newspaper, a feature
of which is a battle over the spittoons
in the Cobb's Corner city hall.
"The cover of this issue, in brilliant
colors, is perhaps the most successful
of the year," said Winston Normnn,
outgoing Old Boy. "Perhaps it 1h the
host issue of the year."
Commencement exercises start Juno
6 at the University of Indiana.
