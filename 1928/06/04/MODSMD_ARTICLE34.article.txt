# SPELLING REFORMERS DEVISE ALPHABET OF FORTY-TWO LETTERS
## Present Alphabet Attempts To Carry Too Many Soundsâ€”Kennedy 
### 
Forty-two letters, one for each of
the sounds in the English language,
comprise a new alphabet announced
by the Spelling Reform Association
recently. In the new alphabet are 23
letters from the present alphabet,
15 new characters, and four diph
thongs.
Professor Arthur G. Kennedy, Stan
ford philologist, when asked about
the new alphabet, said:
"Certainly it is a much-to-be-de
slred thing. We are trying to carry
about 42 sounds with 26 letters, and
foreigners learning the language have
a good deal of difficulty."
Alphabet Not New
Professor Kennedy pointed out that
a number of years ago a group of
American scholars prepared for scien
tific use a similar alphabet which has
since been used in the Standard dic
tionary for phonetic representation.
"This latest alphabet," said Profes
sor Kennedy, "is apparently an at
tempt to prepare the old scientific
one for popular consumption."
Ask Adoption of Plans
It is the hope of the Simplified
Spelling Board and the Spelling Re
form Association that the new alpha
bet will eventually be adopted in the
elementary schools. The claim is
made that a whole year will be cut
off of the time necessary for a grade
school education if the new alphabet
Is used.
English now has 503 separate com
binations of letters for the 42 sounds,
according to a recent computation.
There are 29 possible ways of repre
senting the sound of "i" in "it" alone.
The fifteen new characters have
been designed by Frederick William
Goudy, well-known eastern printer,
who declares them to be well adapt
ed to commercial uses.
