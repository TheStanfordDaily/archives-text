"Chinese students are more serious
minded than American students," ac
cording to a member of the Stanford
Chinese Club. "The reason is that
the Chinese are trained in an atmos
phere of troubled national affairs, and
even in high school the students have
political party allegiances," he said.
The Chinese Club is composed of
thirty-five students, a majority of
whom are graduate students. Most of
them expect to return to China, where
they will teach for a few years be
fore taking positions of leadership in
their special field. Three of the mem
bers of the club are political leaders
in San Francisco and hold the posi
tion of editor-in-chief of Chinese pa
pers there. About fifteen come from
Tsing-Hua College which is supported
by the Boxer indemnity fund refused
by the United States in 1900.
In spite of the many dialects in
China, all the Chinese students here
are able to understand each other ex
cept the seven Cantonese, who must
converse with the others in English.
The Chinese do not have bull ses
sions in the sense used by Americans.
There is too much difference in view
points to discuss diplomatic and in
ternational affairs. There is a radical
group studying Marxian principles
and in sympathy with the Communist
party in China.

ferent idea of recreation," he conclud

but occasionally go to picture shows.
