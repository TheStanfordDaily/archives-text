This play by Kenneth Webb, which
was one of the recent Broadway suc
cesses, is a delightfully funny satire
on domestic life which has become a
little too domestic for harmony. One
woman in a family is enough to run
things, and when there are wives and
sisters and aunts all trying to boss,
complications are bound to result.
They do in "One of the Family."
Nor are members of a family, espe
cially during times of difficulty, in
clined to be too complimentary to
ward each other. The rapidly moving
lines, pointed with sting and humor,
supplement the amusing situations,
making of the whole a delightful
farce comedy.
The trouble starts when Henry
Adams, eldest son of the Boston
Adams, dares to bring home a bride
of his own choosing and without hav
ing let "the family" know about it
beforehand. Aunt Priscilla has al
ways taken care of Henry, and all the
rest of them, and she starts in imme
diately to make over Joyce into a fit
wife for Henry. Joyce, however, has a
will of her own, and when she and
Aunt Priscilla clash, things happen.
Gordon Davis, who saw the New
York production, recommends the
show as highly amusing. It is new to
the West coast. Though typical Amer
ican parts predominate, there is op
portunity for clever and varied char
acterization. "One of the Family"
inaugurates this year's Senior Week
program.
