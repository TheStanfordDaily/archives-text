# LONG EXPLAINS TESTS FOR RATING STUDENTS IN PHYSICAL EXERCISE
## Correlate Various Results To Determine Motor Capacity of Men 
### 
The experimental tests used by the
Stanford Department of Physical Ed
ucation and Hygiene to classify and
rate students' ability to perform av
erage exercises were explained re
cently by Royce R. Long, associate
professor in that department. "In
structors of physical education have
been faced for many years with the
problem of classifying students, and
in our work at Stanford we have ap
proached a solution in a series of
tests given to individuals in physical
education classes."
Tbe tests given are an ingenious
mixture of a number of individual
tests devised by several different
physical education authorities com
bined with some originated by Pro
fessor Long. They are intended to
test not only the actual strength of
the subject, but also the co-ordination
between certain muscles and the
brain. In this manner the tests be
come of a psychological nature.
Long Tells Purpose
The chief aim is to find the motor
capacity of the subject by correlations
ot the various results.
The complete series of tests con
sists of the following parts:
Rope climb (18 feet) for speed;
lung capacity; Sargent test for jump
ing ability; single standing jump for
height; measurement of weight and
height; Martin strength test.
The Sargent test consists of meas
uring the number and height of jumps
that the subject is able to make in 15
seconds. To this Professor Long has
added a single standing jump for
height. The Martin tests are eight
measurements of the strength of the
muscles of the arms and thighs. The
total of strength shown in these eight
tests is approximately 15 per cent of
the total strength of all the muscles
of the body. The Martin strength
tests are the creation of Professor
Emeritus Martin of the Stanford Psy
chology department.
Rope Climb Difficult
In the rope climb, 10 per cent of
the men tested could not climb to
the top of the rope. Two required
sixty seconds for the task while the
rest of the men tested made the dis
tance in times varying from six to
30 seconds. The average time was
14.9 seconds.
The experiment has not been car
ried far enough as yet to warrant a
statement as to its success as a test,
according to Professor Long. A list
will be posted as soon as possible in
order that the men tested may find
their rating.

the top of the rope. Two required
sixty seconds for the task while the
rest of the men tested made the dis
tance in times varying from six to
30 seconds. The average time was
14.9 seconds.
The experiment has not been car
ried far enough as yet to warrant a
statement as to its success as a test,
according to Professor Long. A list
will be posted as soon as possible in
order that the men tested may find
their rating.
The experimental tests used by the
Stanford Department of Physical Ed
ucation and Hygiene to classify and
rate students' ability to perform av
erage exercises were explained re
cently by Royce R. Long, associate
professor in that department. "In
structors of physical education have
been faced for many years with the
problem of classifying students, and
in our work at Stanford we have ap
proached a solution in a series of
tests given to individuals in physical
education classes."
Tbe tests given are an ingenious
mixture of a number of individual
tests devised by several different
physical education authorities com
bined with some originated by Pro
fessor Long. They are intended to
test not only the actual strength of
the subject, but also the co-ordination
between certain muscles and the
brain. In this manner the tests be
come of a psychological nature.
Long Tells Purpose
The chief aim is to find the motor
capacity of the subject by correlations
ot the various results.
The complete series of tests con
sists of the following parts:
Rope climb (18 feet) for speed;
lung capacity; Sargent test for jump
ing ability; single standing jump for
height; measurement of weight and
height; Martin strength test.
The Sargent test consists of meas
uring the number and height of jumps
that the subject is able to make in 15
seconds. To this Professor Long has
added a single standing jump for
height. The Martin tests are eight
measurements of the strength of the
muscles of the arms and thighs. The
total of strength shown in these eight
tests is approximately 15 per cent of
the total strength of all the muscles
of the body. The Martin strength
tests are the creation of Professor
Emeritus Martin of the Stanford Psy
chology department.
Rope Climb Difficult
In the rope climb, 10 per cent of
the men tested could not climb to
the top of the rope. Two required
sixty seconds for the task while the
rest of the men tested made the dis
tance in times varying from six to
30 seconds. The average time was
14.9 seconds.
