# WEST POINT – AND HARRY WILSON
## 
### Feg Murray 
This is about West Point, Football
Coach "Biff" Jones —and Harry Wil
son, one of the finest sportsmen and
greatest all-around athletes that ever
enrolled as a cadet at the United
States Military Academy. Established
on the recommendation of George
Washington in 1794, West Point has
grown to be a place of surpassing in
terest and beauty, and it was with
great pleasure that your humble car
toonist recently spent a
amid its bold scenery on one of the
grandest river passes in the world.
And speaking of passes, this brings
us back to "Biff" Jones and Harry
Wilson, for "Biff" is one of the
smartest schemers of defenses for
forward passes, and Harry one of the
grandest intercepters thereof, that
ever combined to wreck an opposing
team's attack. After a snappy ses
sion at handball, in which "Biff" and
"Moose" McCormick, former Giant
outfielder and pinch-hitter, now base

ball coach at the Point, defeated the
writer and his host, Captain Jerry
Counts, we sought refreshment and
rest in the comfortable abode of hos
pitable Frank Wandle, official trainer
of West Point's athletes.
"How will your team line up next
fall, Biff?" I asked. "Approximately
this way: Murrel, full; Cagle and
Hutchinson, halves; Nave, quarter;
Messenger and Malloy or Kenney,
ends; Sprague and Perry, tackles;
Hannock and Humber, guards; and
Hall, center," the coach replied. (In
cidentally Sprague, the captain-elect,
had just broken the Army shot-put
record for the third successive time
that afternoon.) Biff next admitted
that he might have made a mistake
in taking on the strong Southern
Methodist University team for his
second game of the 1928 season.
"They're tough," went on the coach,
"and scientific, too. They have seen
movies of all the Army's last year's
games. They take the sugar content

of each member of their team on
Thursday before a game, and see that
he eats the proper amount before
Saturday.
"Lacrosse? Say, there's a great
game for spring training for football
players. Better than track, for it of
fers team play, body contact, dodging,
change of pace, and puts the players
in great condition. Seven of my last
year's team are out there playing la
crosse now. Let's go look 'em over."
Which brings us down to Harry Wil
son.
"Harry Wilson," said "Biff," is the
best open-fleld runner I've had since
I've been at the Point. And he is as
fine a lacrosse player as he is a foot
ball man." We saw the redoubtable
Harry after the game. "Gee, it's
hot," he opined. "I lost eight pounds
out there this afternoon. And say,
my dogs are sore. I'll have to get
excused from marching to chapel in
the morning."
Maybe Harry's "dogs" were sore,

but boy, you should have seen him
step at the cadet hop that night!
Wilson graduates soon now, and the
Navy will no doubt be glad to see
him go. He was sinking them as far
back as 1923 when, as a student at
Penn State, he scored three times
against the middies, with runs of
55, 95, and 80 yards, and now, on
June 2, he meets them again at la
crosse. Incidentally, this is the last
time that the two service schools
meet in athletics, until the unfor
tunate breach between them is
patched up.
I am sorry that space will not per
mit more than a mention of Major
Fleming, Capt. Charley Gerhardt,
Lieut. Hewitt, and Cadet Horn.

Hutchinson, halves; Nave, quarter;
Messenger and Malloy or Kenney,
ends; Sprague and Perry, tackles;
Hannock and Humber, guards; and
Hall, center," the coach replied. (In
cidentally Sprague, the captain-elect,
had just broken the Army shot-put
record for the third successive time
that afternoon.) Biff next admitted
that he might have made a mistake
in taking on the strong Southern
Methodist University team for his
second game of the 1928 season.
"They're tough," went on the coach,
"and scientific, too. They have seen
movies of all the Army's last year's
games. They take the sugar content

of each member of their team on
Thursday before a game, and see that
he eats the proper amount before
Saturday.
"Lacrosse? Say, there's a great
game for spring training for football
players. Better than track, for it of
fers team play, body contact, dodging,
change of pace, and puts the players
in great condition. Seven of my last
year's team are out there playing la
crosse now. Let's go look 'em over."
Which brings us down to Harry Wil
son.
"Harry Wilson," said "Biff," is the
best open-fleld runner I've had since
I've been at the Point. And he is as
fine a lacrosse player as he is a foot
ball man." We saw the redoubtable
Harry after the game. "Gee, it's
hot," he opined. "I lost eight pounds
out there this afternoon. And say,
my dogs are sore. I'll have to get
excused from marching to chapel in
the morning."
Maybe Harry's "dogs" were sore,

but boy, you should have seen him
step at the cadet hop that night!
Wilson graduates soon now, and the
Navy will no doubt be glad to see
him go. He was sinking them as far
back as 1923 when, as a student at
Penn State, he scored three times
against the middies, with runs of
55, 95, and 80 yards, and now, on
June 2, he meets them again at la
crosse. Incidentally, this is the last
time that the two service schools
meet in athletics, until the unfor
tunate breach between them is
patched up.

This is about West Point, Football
Coach "Biff" Jones —and Harry Wil
son, one of the finest sportsmen and
greatest all-around athletes that ever
enrolled as a cadet at the United
States Military Academy. Established
on the recommendation of George
Washington in 1794, West Point has
grown to be a place of surpassing in
terest and beauty, and it was with
great pleasure that your humble car
toonist recently spent a
amid its bold scenery on one of the
grandest river passes in the world.
And speaking of passes, this brings
us back to "Biff" Jones and Harry
Wilson, for "Biff" is one of the
smartest schemers of defenses for
forward passes, and Harry one of the
grandest intercepters thereof, that
ever combined to wreck an opposing
team's attack. After a snappy ses
sion at handball, in which "Biff" and
"Moose" McCormick, former Giant
outfielder and pinch-hitter, now base

ball coach at the Point, defeated the
writer and his host, Captain Jerry
Counts, we sought refreshment and
rest in the comfortable abode of hos
pitable Frank Wandle, official trainer
of West Point's athletes.
"How will your team line up next
fall, Biff?" I asked. "Approximately
this way: Murrel, full; Cagle and
Hutchinson, halves; Nave, quarter;
Messenger and Malloy or Kenney,
ends; Sprague and Perry, tackles;
Hannock and Humber, guards; and
