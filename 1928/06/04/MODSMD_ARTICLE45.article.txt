# CARMEL ASSOCIATION WILL GIVE EXHIBIT IN CAMPUS ART GALLERY
## 
### 
Carmel will present an exhibition
of its best art under the auspices of
the Carmel Art Association in the
Stanford Art Gallery from Sunday,
June 3, to June 24. Many well-known
artists of California have their work
represented in the showing.
Oils and water colors of about
twenty-five members of the Carmel
artists' colony make up the exhibi
tion. The variety in subject matter,
method, color, and tone well repre
sent the versatility of California's art
school at Carmel-by-the-Sea.
"Cloudy Day" by Cornelius Botke
depicts a feathery mass of clouds in
the blue of the sky which give the
composition a dreamlike atmosphere.
"Coast near Monterey" by Percy
Grey shows strength and power al
though it is a water-color.
