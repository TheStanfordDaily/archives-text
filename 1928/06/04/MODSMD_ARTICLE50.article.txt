# 'Tex' Thompson Wins High Honor At R.O.T.C. Show
## 
### Bill Grace 
The Ninth Annual R.O.T.C. Horse
Show, staged Friday afternoon on
the Encina polo field by Scabbard and
Blade before a crowd which filled the
bleachers and lined one whole side
of the field, was declared by Lieu
tenant Charles S. Whitmore, chair
man of the officials committee, to be
the most successful event of this
kind which has ever been staged
here. The show was run off smoothly
with more skill than usual on the
part of both horses and riders.
Individual honors for the day were
divided between Lazare Bernhard,
who won three first places, and "Tex"
Thompson, who won the horseman
ship contest for the third consecu
tive time, which gives him permanent
possession of the Scabbard and Blade
Perpetual Trophy. Bernhard took
first in the musical chairs, Cossack
race, and military jumping events.
Thompson, riding Colonel McCabe's
mare, "Lady," rode so well and han
dled his mount so expertly that there
was no doubt about his right to the
horsemanship trophy.
Lack of Casualties
As compared with last year, there
was a notable absence of casualties.
Robert Howe, in the mounted wres
tling event, was kicked by an excited
horse after being dismounted. Except
for serious bruises, Howe seems to
have suffered no permanent injury.
A1 Goodspeed, riding one of the mean
est animals on the picket line, was
thrown when his horse reared and
fell back on its rider. Goodspeed was
not hurt, and drew the applause of
the crowd by getting up from his
fall and winning second place in the
military jumping with the same
mount.
Mard Black won first in the steeple
chase after a close race with Joe
Bitterlin.
