# ROOM ASSIGNMENTS IN ENCINA NOT AFFECTED BY FEWER FRESHMEN
## 
### 
"Assignment of Encina rooms will
not in any way be affected by the de
crease in the number of freshmen
entering next fall." That was the
opinion expressed by Dean George B.
Culver yesterday when he said that
the crowded conditions in the Hall
had always been a source of annoy
ance, and that the decrease in the
number of entering men will result
in improving living conditions con
siderably.
Upperclassmen will not be allowed
to encroach upon the lower floors of
the building, which have always been
reserved for freshmen. The upper
floor will be assigned to upper divi
sion men as heretofore.
Another problem due to the policy
of restricting the number of lower
division students in the University is
that of maintaining the Encina Com
mons dining halls. This year there
are fewer men eating in the Com
mons than at any other time since
they were constructed. Comptroller
Roth and Miss Etta Handy, director
of the dining halls, have conferred re
garding the matter but have not
made any definite decision.
