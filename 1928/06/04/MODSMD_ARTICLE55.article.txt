The Managerial Staff tryoutees will
meet tonight at 8:30 o'clock in the
Quad office of the Old Union for the
last meeting of this year. This will be
a very important meeting and both
men and women are requested to be
present, according to Homer Craig,
Business Manager.
The selling of advertisements will
be discussed in order that the stu

ments during the summer. Any peo
ple who have not attended the try
outee meetings before, and wish to
try out for the business staff, may at
tend this meeting. The tryoutees have
not done any work yet, so that those

basis as those who have been to the
meetings before.
