LOS ANGELES, June 3.—(P.1.P.)
—On the average extra-curricular ac
tivities do not interfere with or de
tract from good scholarship, but are
carried on in addition to rather than
in place of class work, according to
the results of a study conducted by
Dean Earl J. Miller of the University
of California at Los Angeles.
Among other conclusions drawn
from the results of the investigation
is that men students engaged in
outside activities make slightly high
er grades than those students who
are not.
Dean Miller also found that men
working their way through college
make higher records scholastleally
than those who are not working.
Twelve per cent of the men not doing
extra-curricular work have to be dis
missed from the university because
of deficient scholarship. Only 6 per
cent of the activity men were dropped
for this reason.
