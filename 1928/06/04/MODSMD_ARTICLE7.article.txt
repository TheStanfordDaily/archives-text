# DR. JORDAN ASKS WOMEN TO HELP WAR PREVENTION
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan wrote an appeal to the
outgoing senior women of Stanford
which was read at a meeting of a
group of them Thursday night. Fol
lowing is the content which is a
message not only to the senior
women, but to all women of the Uni
versity:
AN APPEAL TO YOUNG WOMEN
OF STANFORD
To you, girls of the present, moth
ers of the future, I send this message
concerning the most vital issue of
your century, and the one nearest my
own heart.
Little by little arises the great ap
peal of the heart and mind of uni
versal humanity, the appeal to keep
unreasoning anger out of the councils
of the world, to make the use of vio
lence no longer a resort in interna
tional disputes. In this movement
devoted women are more and more
taking their natural part. Through
out the ages, women have borne the
real brunt of war.
It was a brave woman of Austria,
Bertha von Suttner, who first gave to
the world the story of war, its pa
triotism, real or simulated, its in
trigues, its brutalities, from the wom
an's side. This story of crime and
suffering in "Waffen Nieder" turned
the current of thought for millions of
other women. It gives the vision of
a better world, one ruled by ideas, not
by guns, bayonets, and poison gas.
Today, more than ever, we depend
on the women of our world to plead
effectively for the sacredness of hu
man life and for the final outlawry
of all war.
DAVID STARR JORDAN
