# BILL NICHOLS LEADER IN SOCCER DECATHLON SCORE; GIBBS SECOND
## 
### 
With seven of the ten events of
the soccer decathlon played off, Bill
Nichols leads with 366 1-9 points. His
nearest competitor, A1 Gibbs, has
earned 315 points, and Ed Robinson
takes third place with 250 5-7. Friday
afternoon the two events were throw
ing for distance and accuracy and the
run up and kick for goal. The three
events which will decide the winner
of the gold soccer ball are to be
played off this afternoon.
In the run up and kick for-goal each
man was given three trials. Nichols,
Wilfred Mujica, and Roy Morris tied
for first with perfect scores. Bob
Burns and Dave Jacobson each kicked
two goals, while fourteen men made
one goal.
A1 Gibbs won the throw for dis
tance and accuracy by tossing the
ball 74 feet 1 inch. Takazo Domoto
took second place when he threw the
ball 73 feet 9 inches.
A scoring system has been worked
out this year by which the first ten
men in each event receive points.
The first man is given 100 points, the
second 90, etc. Thus far Bill Nichols
has placed in every event and has
shown some real all-around ability.
By this scoring system Nichols' po
sition is far from definite for if he
should fall down in one of the three
events this afternoon one of the other
high men may easily pass him.
