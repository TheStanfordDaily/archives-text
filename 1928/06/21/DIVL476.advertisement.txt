The Traveler's Money
It adds much to the satisfaction and comfort of the traveler to know that
his funds are safe and immediately available when needed. Trouble and
anxiety are apt to disturb an otherwise pleasurable journey unless this im
portant detail is transacted before leaving home. An American Trust Com
pany Letter of Credit meets all the traveler's requirements and besides it is
much safer to carry than actual cash. American Trust Company Letters of
Credit are accepted the world over.
