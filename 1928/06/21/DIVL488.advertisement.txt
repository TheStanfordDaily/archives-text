Announcing a special membership plan in our cir
culating library for Stanford summer students.
$1.50 will give you the privilege of drawing one
book a day for 3 months. You may keep the books a
week. Could anything be fairer than that?
And .... more than that .... we're going to be
open evenings this summer.
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday from 7:30 un
til 9:00.
Drop in some evening.
