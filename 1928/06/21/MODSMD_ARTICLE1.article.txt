# LA 						HONDA TRIP IS SCHEDULED FOR SATURDAY
## First Regular Weekly Motor Excursion to Be Over Scenic Route Will Be of Great Interest to New People; Starts at 10 o'Clock 
### 
The first of the regular weekly
summer automobile excursions will
leave from the front of the Stanford
Union at 10 o'clock, Saturday. This
will be to La Honda and Pebble

Beach.
Scheduled summer automobile trips
are planned by the Fortune Yellow
Cab Company of Palo Alto, in co
operation with the University. The
trips are to afford opportunity to
those who are new at Stanford to
see many of the interesting and scenic
points in the nearby country. Nine
excursions are planned for this sum
mer, all on Saturdays.

Transportation on the trips is by
means of seven-passenger cars. Mem
bers of each party will provide their
own luncheons.

The trip to La Honda and Pebble
Beach is of great interest, especially
to those who are more or less unfa
miliar with this country. From the
summit of the La Honda grade one
can look down on the entire penin
sula. The tour then goes back
through the redwoods, and on down
to the ocean. It will return to the
Campus between 4 and 5 o'clock.

Reservations for the first or any
of these tours must be made and the
fares deposited two days in advance.
This may be done in the office of the
Director of the Summer Quarter,
Room 173, Administration Building.
The fare for the trip to La Honda
will be $2.50.
