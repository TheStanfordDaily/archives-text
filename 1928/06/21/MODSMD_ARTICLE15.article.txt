# HOOVER EXPECTED TO ARRIVE AT STANFORD HOME EARLY IN JULY
## Republican Leaders Suggest Nomination Notice Be Given in Stadium 
### 
Reports from Washington indicate
that Herbert Hoover, '95, Republican
nominee for the presidency, is ex
pected to leave the national capital
for his campus residence on San Juan
hill before long, and that he will re
ceive formal notification of his can
didacy here early in July.

It has been suggested by Repub
lican party leaders, who are making
plans for this notification, that the
ceremony might take place in the
Stanford stadium, which would give
ample space for all local people to
hear and see the event, and from
which radio connections would en
able the speeches to be broadcast to
all parts of the country.

If the ceremonies took place at
Stanford late in the afternoon the
speeches could be received by radio
at convenient times for all sections
of the nation.

Arrangements have been made to
set up loud-speaker equipment in the
stadium for the benefit of the foot
ball crowds next fall, but it is not
known that this installation could be
completed in time for use at the for
mal notification speeches of the Re
publicans in July.
Secretary Hoover's plans for the re
mainder of the summer, after his no
tification, are not known, nor has it
been officially announced whether he
will resign his cabinet position soon
or continue with those duties until
nearer the election. It is reported that
he will probably visit President Cool
idge at his Wisconsin summer home
on his way West, and presumably
the President's wishes will guide
Hoover in this respect.
