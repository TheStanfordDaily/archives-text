# FIRST TRYOUTS TOMORROW FOR COMING PLAYS
## Gordon Davis Summons All Who Seek Parts During Summer Quarter Must Cast Immediately, as First Production Will Be Given July 6 
### 
All summer students interested in
dramatics are urged to appear in the
Assembly Hall for tryouts at any of
the following times: tomorrow from
3 to 5 o'clock in the afternoon, or from
7 to 9 o'clock in the evening; or Sat
urday from 9 to 12 o'clock in the
morning or between 1 and 3 o'clock
in the afternoon.

"We are anxious to have a large
number of men and women at these
tryouts," said Gordon Davis, director,
who recently returned from Europe.
"The first play of the season, to be
presented July 6, requires a diversity
of characters. Previous experience is

not essential."
"While casting this first play, I will
also be watching for types suitable
for the other summer quarter produc
tions," Mr. Davis announced. "There
fore this will be in the nature of a
tentative casting for the entire sum
mer season, and those who do not

receive parts in the opening produc
tion arq likely to be favored for
places in later casts."
Dramatics is the only extra-curricu
lar activity at Stanford during the
Summer Quarter, and will receive par
ticular attention.
Mr. Davis, while touring this coun
try and Europe last year, acquired
many new ideas which he feels will
be of value to dramatics at Stanford.
"I am confident that this summer will
be the strongest season which we
have ever had," he predicts.
