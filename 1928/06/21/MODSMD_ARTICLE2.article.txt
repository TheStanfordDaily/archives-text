Teachers who are interested in Girl
Scout work and other extra-curricu
lar activities and students who are
looking forward to leadership of Girl
Scout troops will have an opportunity
to get first hand information on this
work in a course in Girl Scout Lead
ership to be given by Sue Dyer. Miss
Dyer has been associated with Girl
Scout work throughout the country
and has been an active worker in this
locality.

The number of the course is Edu
cation 110 and it will nieet from 1:30
to 3 o'clock Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons in Room 200J during the
first term. One and one-half units
credit will be given for the course.

will be to acquaint the class with the
leisure time needs of the adolescent
girl, and how to take care of them.
Students will be instructed how to
organize and carry on a Girl Scout
troop, and to adept these methods in
working with girls, either in school
or not.
