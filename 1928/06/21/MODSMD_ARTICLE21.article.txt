# Stanford's Hello
## 
### 
Stanford is widely known for its "hello custom." Stanford men and
women need wait for no introduction to speak to each other. They are
members of the family; residence on the Farm as students or faculty
makes them that and is all the introduction needed.

That spirit grows out of our living here in our own little city and is
just one phase of the Stanford character of community of purpose and
of effort. All Stanford people are accustomed to work together for the
common purpose, naturally and without any sense of having to strive for
co-operation. The sense of fellowship is an inherent part of our life here.
This applies to all Stanford people. The fact that there is a larger pro
portion of "new" Stanford people in the University during the Summer
Quarter than in other quarters does not in the least change the fact. Every
Stanford student is a full citizen of the red-tiled principality, with all its
rights and privileges.

But every citizen must exercise his rights and privileges if he is to
enjoy them. Nobody will or can force him to take advantage of his oppor
tunities. Any new student will be welcomed into the life here, and his
participation is eagerly sought in all Stanford affairs, but it remains with
him whether he will reap the full benefit of our community activities.
We old-timers on the campus urge all newcomers to start at once as
full-fledged, whole-hearted Stanford men and women. To every one we
give a cordial Stanford "Hello."
