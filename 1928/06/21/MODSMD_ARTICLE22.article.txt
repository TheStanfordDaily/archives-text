The Stanford Daily is a community newspaper for Stanford people.
Its aim and purpose is to tell you what is going on and to inform you
about what is planned that concerns you as members of the community.
The Daily serves also as a centralizing influence; its columns are open to
all who have not only news but ideas and opinions of interest and value to
others. The Daily eagerly welcomes communications from its readers
concerning anything that can profitably be brought before students and
faculty for consideration.

There is, of course, an anomaly in calling a paper that appears twice
a week "the Daily," but the Daily is its name and we are used to it; so
we let it stand, for it is the same paper as that which appears during the
other quarters and its name is officially fixed.
Every student who registers at Stanford becomes automatically a sub
scriber of the Daily, and we urge every student to read it. From it you
will gain information that you might otherwise miss, and from it we trust
you will gain also a sense of the life and spirit of Stanford that you ought
not to miss.

Those who are not registered students may have it sent to them regu
larly upon payment of the dollar subscription for the quarter, and we
think that would be a dollar well spent. The name and office address of
the circulation manager appears at the top of this column. That is a useful
address to keep in mind, also, if you do not get your copy of the Daily
promptly. It is his business to see that you do.
