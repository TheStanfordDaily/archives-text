Stanford will have a large number
of athletes in different parts of the
world this summer, some lighting for
glory of Stanford and others fighting
for the glory of the United States,
which will also give Stanford no small
amount of credit. Not only is Stan
ford sending several athletes to the
Olympic Games, but the Cardinals
will be represented by two coaches,
Dink Templeton and Ernie Brandsten.

Cardinal trackmen made history
this year by their triumphant inva
sion of the East. They have won the
title of being the greatest college
track team in America and are ac
corded the further honor by most
track experts of being the greatest
college team in track history.

Easterners half-feared and half
jeered the Stanford tracksters before
the 1.C.4A meet, feeling that they
couldn't be as good as they were
claimed to be. But the Cards won the
meet easily, and the East had to ad
mit that they were pretty good. Then
the Cardinals won the N.C.A. meet
in a walkaway, further proving their
superiority.

Now the Cardinals are preparing to
give the East another thrill in the
Olympic Games tryouts, July 6 and 7.
At least four Cardinals have prac
tically cinched their tickets for Am
sterdam: Eric Krenz, Harlow Roth
ert, Bob King, and Captain Bud Spen
cer. Krenz and Rothert were the big
surprises in the East, where a 45-foot
shotputter is considered good. Each
is capable of 49 feet consistently.

Krenz tosses the discus around 155
feet, which will win him a place in
this event. He has been threatening
the world's record for some time, and
the strong competition he will face
in meeting the best in the world may
make him do it. Bud Houser, holder
of the world's record, will be on deck
to guard his title and set a new one
if he can, so this should be an inter
esting battle.

Rothert started from Stanford an
unknown athlete in national circles,
and has succeeded in his quiet man
ner in getting his name in every paper
in the United States. There are many
who say, and with good reason, that
before Rothert leaves Stanford he
will be holder of the world's record
in the shot. He is a natural athlete
and a natural shotputter, and it will
be no surprise to anyone if he should
near the world's mark before the sum
mer is over.

Captain Bud Spencer deserves a
paragraph by himself. The Cardinal
skipper went East in the spring of
1927 and failed to place in the 1.C.4A.
This year he took second because he
was running on a muddy track, unfa
miliar conditions for a runner from
sunny California. He redeemed hint
self in the N.C.A. meet, winning in the
fast time of 47.7, a new record. He
will enter the trials, which will be on
July 4, a favorite. He is sure to be
chosen for the Olympics, for he would
be picked for the relay team if by
any chance he should fail to place in
the 440 tryouts.

Bob King is the other Stanford man
who is a cinch to make the team. He
is the outstanding high jumper of the
United States. Ward Edmonds has a
strong chance in the pole vault, but
cannot be considered a certainty.
Ross Nichols will be sure to make the
team in the high hurdles if he is
"right" the day of the trials, for he
rates among the best. He has had
tough luck tripping over hurdles.
Since he will have to run in more
than one race in the tryouts, he can
only be considered a possibility.

Kim Dyer may broadjump himself
to Amsterdam. He has been doing
around 24 feet 6 inches, but there are
a number of broadjumpers he will
face that are capable of the same
distance. Dyer has done better this
year, and if he reaches his earlier
marks .should make the team. There
are three men who have done 25
feet, so Dyer will have to jump far
to get an ocean voyage. Kibby and
Sparling, javelin throwers, have out
side chances of placing on the team.
Kibby has thrown 209 feet, and if he
repeats this performance may qualify.

The Cards who go across the ocean
to show the world what kind of ath
letes the West produces will be right
at home, for they will have their own
track coach, Dink Templeton, along
to tell them what is wrong with them
and how they can improve. Temple
ton will assist Lawson Robertson in
coaching the American team.

Tracksters are not the only ones to
be accompanied by their own coach,
for Ernie Brandsten, who baa made
Stanford famous for aquatic teams,
will go along to direct the United
States swimming team. Reggie Har
rison is the only man that has already
won a berth, but Pete Desjardine,
freeshman diver, is a cinch. A1 White
and Dave Fall, former Stanford mer

men, will also probably accompany
Bransten. Wally O'Connor is another
Stanford man who should make the
team.

While the trackmen and swimmers
are looking forward to a voyage
across the Atlantic, another team will
have its eyes turned toward the West
with visions of the Fiji Islands, New
Zealand and Australia. Coach Harry
Wolter and his baseball squad will
leave on July 5 to demonstrate their
ability in the great American pas
time, or possibly take a few lessons
from the natives.

And that's not all. Three Stanford
tennis players are in the East at pres
ent, making themselves dangerous to
the country's best. Captain A1 Her
rington, Ralph McElvenny and Cap
tain-elect John Wheatley all had suc
cessful seasons and should show the
Easterners a thing or two. All three
will play singles, and McElvenny
and Herrington as a doubles team
are a duo that should be hard to
beat. They went through the season
without losing a set, and now wear
the Pacific Coast crown. Herrington
defeated McElvenny for the singles
title, which made the Coast tourney
sort of a family affair.

Easterners will be looking forward
to the Army-Stanford game next sea
son. This promises to be one of the
classics of the year. It will be a con
flict between two schools of high scho
lastic as well as athletic rating, and
will be a battle of wits between two
of the best coaches in the United
States.

mer is over.

Captain Bud Spencer deserves a
paragraph by himself. The Cardinal
skipper went East in the spring of
1927 and failed to place in the 1.C.4A.
This year he took second because he
was running on a muddy track, unfa
miliar conditions for a runner from
sunny California. He redeemed hint
self in the N.C.A. meet, winning in the
fast time of 47.7, a new record. He
will enter the trials, which will be on
July 4, a favorite. He is sure to be
chosen for the Olympics, for he would
be picked for the relay team if by
any chance he should fail to place in
the 440 tryouts.

Bob King is the other Stanford man
who is a cinch to make the team. He
is the outstanding high jumper of the
United States. Ward Edmonds has a
strong chance in the pole vault, but
cannot be considered a certainty.
Ross Nichols will be sure to make the
team in the high hurdles if he is
"right" the day of the trials, for he
rates among the best. He has had
tough luck tripping over hurdles.
Since he will have to run in more
than one race in the tryouts, he can
only be considered a possibility.

Kim Dyer may broadjump himself
to Amsterdam. He has been doing
around 24 feet 6 inches, but there are
a number of broadjumpers he will
face that are capable of the same
distance. Dyer has done better this
year, and if he reaches his earlier
marks .should make the team. There
are three men who have done 25
feet, so Dyer will have to jump far
to get an ocean voyage. Kibby and
Sparling, javelin throwers, have out
side chances of placing on the team.
Kibby has thrown 209 feet, and if he
repeats this performance may qualify.

The Cards who go across the ocean
to show the world what kind of ath
letes the West produces will be right
at home, for they will have their own
track coach, Dink Templeton, along
to tell them what is wrong with them
and how they can improve. Temple
ton will assist Lawson Robertson in
coaching the American team.

Tracksters are not the only ones to
be accompanied by their own coach,
for Ernie Brandsten, who baa made
Stanford famous for aquatic teams,
will go along to direct the United
States swimming team. Reggie Har
rison is the only man that has already
won a berth, but Pete Desjardine,
freeshman diver, is a cinch. A1 White
and Dave Fall, former Stanford mer

men, will also probably accompany
Bransten. Wally O'Connor is another
Stanford man who should make the
team.

While the trackmen and swimmers
are looking forward to a voyage
across the Atlantic, another team will
have its eyes turned toward the West
with visions of the Fiji Islands, New
Zealand and Australia. Coach Harry
Wolter and his baseball squad will
leave on July 5 to demonstrate their
ability in the great American pas
time, or possibly take a few lessons
from the natives.

And that's not all. Three Stanford
tennis players are in the East at pres
ent, making themselves dangerous to
the country's best. Captain A1 Her
rington, Ralph McElvenny and Cap
tain-elect John Wheatley all had suc
cessful seasons and should show the
Easterners a thing or two. All three
will play singles, and McElvenny
and Herrington as a doubles team
are a duo that should be hard to
beat. They went through the season
without losing a set, and now wear
the Pacific Coast crown. Herrington
defeated McElvenny for the singles
title, which made the Coast tourney
sort of a family affair.

Easterners will be looking forward
to the Army-Stanford game next sea
son. This promises to be one of the
classics of the year. It will be a con
flict between two schools of high scho
lastic as well as athletic rating, and
will be a battle of wits between two
of the best coaches in the United
States.

Co-eds of Sioux Falls College, South
Dakota, have started the fad of adopt
ing frogs as pets.

Co-eds cannot ride on the rear of
policemen's motorcycles, says the
University of Nebraska.

The brick building just inside the
College Terrace border of the campus
on the road that runs from Branner
Hall, was for a time used as the lab
oratory of the psychology department.
It was built before the University by
Peter Coutts, "the Frenchman" around j
whom legends cluster, as a library
for his collection of valuable books.

Women once lived in Encina Hall,
long devoted to men exclusively as
was the original plan and now the
freshman quarters. In the first days
of the University, before there were
sufficient houses on the campus for
the faculty some faculty men with
their wives lived for a short time in
Encina.
Stanford will have a large number
of athletes in different parts of the
world this summer, some lighting for
glory of Stanford and others fighting
for the glory of the United States,
which will also give Stanford no small
amount of credit. Not only is Stan
ford sending several athletes to the
Olympic Games, but the Cardinals
will be represented by two coaches,
Dink Templeton and Ernie Brandsten.

Cardinal trackmen made history
this year by their triumphant inva
sion of the East. They have won the
title of being the greatest college
track team in America and are ac
corded the further honor by most
track experts of being the greatest
college team in track history.

Easterners half-feared and half
jeered the Stanford tracksters before
the 1.C.4A meet, feeling that they
couldn't be as good as they were
claimed to be. But the Cards won the
meet easily, and the East had to ad
mit that they were pretty good. Then
the Cardinals won the N.C.A. meet
in a walkaway, further proving their
superiority.

Now the Cardinals are preparing to
give the East another thrill in the
Olympic Games tryouts, July 6 and 7.
At least four Cardinals have prac
tically cinched their tickets for Am
sterdam: Eric Krenz, Harlow Roth
ert, Bob King, and Captain Bud Spen
cer. Krenz and Rothert were the big
surprises in the East, where a 45-foot
shotputter is considered good. Each
is capable of 49 feet consistently.

Krenz tosses the discus around 155
feet, which will win him a place in
this event. He has been threatening
the world's record for some time, and
the strong competition he will face
in meeting the best in the world may
make him do it. Bud Houser, holder
of the world's record, will be on deck
to guard his title and set a new one
if he can, so this should be an inter
esting battle.

Rothert started from Stanford an
unknown athlete in national circles,
and has succeeded in his quiet man
ner in getting his name in every paper
in the United States. There are many
who say, and with good reason, that
before Rothert leaves Stanford he
will be holder of the world's record
in the shot. He is a natural athlete
and a natural shotputter, and it will
be no surprise to anyone if he should
near the world's mark before the sum
mer is over.

rison is the only man that has already
won a berth, but Pete Desjardine,
freeshman diver, is a cinch. A1 White
and Dave Fall, former Stanford mer

men, will also probably accompany
Bransten. Wally O'Connor is another
Stanford man who should make the
team.

While the trackmen and swimmers
are looking forward to a voyage
across the Atlantic, another team will
have its eyes turned toward the West
with visions of the Fiji Islands, New
Zealand and Australia. Coach Harry
Wolter and his baseball squad will
leave on July 5 to demonstrate their
ability in the great American pas
time, or possibly take a few lessons
from the natives.

And that's not all. Three Stanford
tennis players are in the East at pres
ent, making themselves dangerous to
the country's best. Captain A1 Her
rington, Ralph McElvenny and Cap
tain-elect John Wheatley all had suc
cessful seasons and should show the
Easterners a thing or two. All three
will play singles, and McElvenny
and Herrington as a doubles team
are a duo that should be hard to
beat. They went through the season
without losing a set, and now wear
the Pacific Coast crown. Herrington
defeated McElvenny for the singles
title, which made the Coast tourney
sort of a family affair.

Easterners will be looking forward
to the Army-Stanford game next sea
son. This promises to be one of the
classics of the year. It will be a con
flict between two schools of high scho
lastic as well as athletic rating, and
will be a battle of wits between two
of the best coaches in the United
States.

Co-eds cannot ride on the rear of

The brick building just inside the
College Terrace border of the campus
on the road that runs from Branner
Hall, was for a time used as the lab
oratory of the psychology department.
It was built before the University by
Peter Coutts, "the Frenchman" around j
whom legends cluster, as a library
for his collection of valuable books.

Women once lived in Encina Hall,
long devoted to men exclusively as
was the original plan and now the

Encina.
Stanford will have a large number
of athletes in different parts of the
world this summer, some lighting for
glory of Stanford and others fighting
for the glory of the United States,
which will also give Stanford no small
amount of credit. Not only is Stan
ford sending several athletes to the
Olympic Games, but the Cardinals
will be represented by two coaches,
Dink Templeton and Ernie Brandsten.

Cardinal trackmen made history
this year by their triumphant inva
sion of the East. They have won the
title of being the greatest college
track team in America and are ac
corded the further honor by most
track experts of being the greatest
college team in track history.

Easterners half-feared and half
jeered the Stanford tracksters before
the 1.C.4A meet, feeling that they
couldn't be as good as they were
claimed to be. But the Cards won the
meet easily, and the East had to ad
mit that they were pretty good. Then
the Cardinals won the N.C.A. meet
in a walkaway, further proving their
superiority.

Now the Cardinals are preparing to
give the East another thrill in the
Olympic Games tryouts, July 6 and 7.
At least four Cardinals have prac
tically cinched their tickets for Am
sterdam: Eric Krenz, Harlow Roth
ert, Bob King, and Captain Bud Spen
cer. Krenz and Rothert were the big
surprises in the East, where a 45-foot
shotputter is considered good. Each
is capable of 49 feet consistently.

Krenz tosses the discus around 155
feet, which will win him a place in
this event. He has been threatening
the world's record for some time, and
the strong competition he will face
in meeting the best in the world may
make him do it. Bud Houser, holder
of the world's record, will be on deck
to guard his title and set a new one
if he can, so this should be an inter
esting battle.

Rothert started from Stanford an
unknown athlete in national circles,
and has succeeded in his quiet man
ner in getting his name in every paper
in the United States. There are many
who say, and with good reason, that
before Rothert leaves Stanford he
will be holder of the world's record
in the shot. He is a natural athlete
and a natural shotputter, and it will
be no surprise to anyone if he should
near the world's mark before the sum
mer is over.

Captain Bud Spencer deserves a
paragraph by himself. The Cardinal
skipper went East in the spring of
1927 and failed to place in the 1.C.4A.
This year he took second because he
was running on a muddy track, unfa
miliar conditions for a runner from
sunny California. He redeemed hint
self in the N.C.A. meet, winning in the
fast time of 47.7, a new record. He
will enter the trials, which will be on
July 4, a favorite. He is sure to be
chosen for the Olympics, for he would
be picked for the relay team if by
any chance he should fail to place in
the 440 tryouts.

Bob King is the other Stanford man
who is a cinch to make the team. He
is the outstanding high jumper of the
United States. Ward Edmonds has a
strong chance in the pole vault, but
cannot be considered a certainty.
Ross Nichols will be sure to make the
team in the high hurdles if he is
"right" the day of the trials, for he
rates among the best. He has had
tough luck tripping over hurdles.
Since he will have to run in more
than one race in the tryouts, he can
only be considered a possibility.

Kim Dyer may broadjump himself
to Amsterdam. He has been doing
around 24 feet 6 inches, but there are
a number of broadjumpers he will
face that are capable of the same
distance. Dyer has done better this
year, and if he reaches his earlier
marks .should make the team. There
are three men who have done 25
feet, so Dyer will have to jump far
to get an ocean voyage. Kibby and
Sparling, javelin throwers, have out
side chances of placing on the team.
Kibby has thrown 209 feet, and if he
repeats this performance may qualify.

The Cards who go across the ocean
to show the world what kind of ath
letes the West produces will be right
at home, for they will have their own
track coach, Dink Templeton, along
to tell them what is wrong with them
and how they can improve. Temple
ton will assist Lawson Robertson in
coaching the American team.

Tracksters are not the only ones to
be accompanied by their own coach,
for Ernie Brandsten, who baa made
Stanford famous for aquatic teams,
will go along to direct the United
States swimming team. Reggie Har
rison is the only man that has already
won a berth, but Pete Desjardine,

the faculty some faculty men with
their wives lived for a short time in
Encina.
Stanford will have a large number
of athletes in different parts of the
world this summer, some lighting for
glory of Stanford and others fighting
for the glory of the United States,
which will also give Stanford no small
amount of credit. Not only is Stan
ford sending several athletes to the
Olympic Games, but the Cardinals
will be represented by two coaches,
Dink Templeton and Ernie Brandsten.

Cardinal trackmen made history
this year by their triumphant inva
sion of the East. They have won the
title of being the greatest college
track team in America and are ac
corded the further honor by most
track experts of being the greatest
college team in track history.

Easterners half-feared and half
jeered the Stanford tracksters before
the 1.C.4A meet, feeling that they
couldn't be as good as they were
claimed to be. But the Cards won the
meet easily, and the East had to ad
mit that they were pretty good. Then
the Cardinals won the N.C.A. meet
in a walkaway, further proving their
superiority.

Now the Cardinals are preparing to
give the East another thrill in the
Olympic Games tryouts, July 6 and 7.
At least four Cardinals have prac
tically cinched their tickets for Am
sterdam: Eric Krenz, Harlow Roth
ert, Bob King, and Captain Bud Spen
cer. Krenz and Rothert were the big
surprises in the East, where a 45-foot
shotputter is considered good. Each
is capable of 49 feet consistently.

Krenz tosses the discus around 155
feet, which will win him a place in
this event. He has been threatening
the world's record for some time, and
the strong competition he will face
in meeting the best in the world may
make him do it. Bud Houser, holder
of the world's record, will be on deck
to guard his title and set a new one
if he can, so this should be an inter
esting battle.

Rothert started from Stanford an
unknown athlete in national circles,
and has succeeded in his quiet man
ner in getting his name in every paper
in the United States. There are many
who say, and with good reason, that
before Rothert leaves Stanford he
will be holder of the world's record
in the shot. He is a natural athlete
and a natural shotputter, and it will
be no surprise to anyone if he should
near the world's mark before the sum
mer is over.

Captain Bud Spencer deserves a
paragraph by himself. The Cardinal
skipper went East in the spring of
1927 and failed to place in the 1.C.4A.
This year he took second because he
was running on a muddy track, unfa
miliar conditions for a runner from
sunny California. He redeemed hint
self in the N.C.A. meet, winning in the
fast time of 47.7, a new record. He
will enter the trials, which will be on
July 4, a favorite. He is sure to be
chosen for the Olympics, for he would
be picked for the relay team if by
any chance he should fail to place in
the 440 tryouts.

Bob King is the other Stanford man
who is a cinch to make the team. He
is the outstanding high jumper of the
United States. Ward Edmonds has a
strong chance in the pole vault, but
cannot be considered a certainty.
Ross Nichols will be sure to make the
team in the high hurdles if he is
"right" the day of the trials, for he
rates among the best. He has had
tough luck tripping over hurdles.
Since he will have to run in more
than one race in the tryouts, he can
only be considered a possibility.

Kim Dyer may broadjump himself
to Amsterdam. He has been doing
around 24 feet 6 inches, but there are
a number of broadjumpers he will
face that are capable of the same
distance. Dyer has done better this
year, and if he reaches his earlier
marks .should make the team. There
are three men who have done 25
feet, so Dyer will have to jump far
to get an ocean voyage. Kibby and
Sparling, javelin throwers, have out
side chances of placing on the team.
Kibby has thrown 209 feet, and if he
repeats this performance may qualify.

The Cards who go across the ocean
to show the world what kind of ath
letes the West produces will be right
at home, for they will have their own
track coach, Dink Templeton, along
to tell them what is wrong with them
and how they can improve. Temple
ton will assist Lawson Robertson in
coaching the American team.

Tracksters are not the only ones to
be accompanied by their own coach,
for Ernie Brandsten, who baa made
Stanford famous for aquatic teams,
will go along to direct the United
States swimming team. Reggie Har
rison is the only man that has already
won a berth, but Pete Desjardine,
freeshman diver, is a cinch. A1 White
and Dave Fall, former Stanford mer

men, will also probably accompany
Bransten. Wally O'Connor is another
Stanford man who should make the
team.

While the trackmen and swimmers
are looking forward to a voyage
across the Atlantic, another team will
have its eyes turned toward the West
with visions of the Fiji Islands, New
Zealand and Australia. Coach Harry
Wolter and his baseball squad will
leave on July 5 to demonstrate their
ability in the great American pas
time, or possibly take a few lessons
from the natives.

And that's not all. Three Stanford
tennis players are in the East at pres
ent, making themselves dangerous to
the country's best. Captain A1 Her
rington, Ralph McElvenny and Cap
tain-elect John Wheatley all had suc
cessful seasons and should show the
Easterners a thing or two. All three
will play singles, and McElvenny
and Herrington as a doubles team
are a duo that should be hard to
beat. They went through the season
without losing a set, and now wear
the Pacific Coast crown. Herrington
defeated McElvenny for the singles
title, which made the Coast tourney
sort of a family affair.

Easterners will be looking forward
to the Army-Stanford game next sea
son. This promises to be one of the
classics of the year. It will be a con
flict between two schools of high scho
lastic as well as athletic rating, and
will be a battle of wits between two
of the best coaches in the United
States.
