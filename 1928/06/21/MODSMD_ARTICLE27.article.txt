this summer in a series of lectures by a
peculiarly well qualified exponent, Dr.
Jose Vasconcelos, formerly minister of
public instruction in the Mexican govern-

ment.
This subject of timely interest in view
of the development of South American
republics and of the increasingly close
relations between these countries and the
United States will be expounded by a
man thoroughly acquainted .with the
background and present situation of the
Latin-American nations and able to in
terpret them to American listeners, for
I)r. Vasconcelos is not only a student of
the subjects he will handle but in addi
tion has had experience in presenting
them to the peoples of other countries.
He has recently returned from a lecture
tour in Europe and comes to Stanford
from the University of Chicago, where
he has been giving a course covering
the same ground.

The first lecture in the series will be
presented next Thursday afternoon at
4:15 o'clock, the title being "Civilizing
Influences in Latin America and Ob
stacles Met." Four other lectures will
follow closely, the whole series being
completed on July 12.

The subjects of these four will be
"The Present Day Situation of Latin
America Regarding Pan-Americanism,"
"Latin America Today," "Modern Cur
rents of Thought in Latin America," and
"Bolivar and the Revival of Latin Amer
icanism." The address on "Latin America
Today" will be given on the evening of
July 10, presenting contemporary con
ditions in Central and South America
as one of the Tuesday evening series of
discussions of matters of current inter
est. The other four will be given in the
afternoon.
In addition to this series in English,
Dr. Vasconcelos will give three lectures
in Spanish at 10 o'clock in the morning,
an hour when no classes are scheduled
for students of Spanish. The titles of
the three lectures in this group are "The
Theory of Nationalities and the Tend
ency to Federation and Unity," "The
Educational Policy of the Spanish in
America," and "The Philosophy of the
Conquerors and the Missionaries."
