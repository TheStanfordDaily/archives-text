# OFFER GREAT VARIETY IN TUESDAY PROGRAMS FOR SUMMER QUARTER
## 
### 
Tuesday evening programs will of
fer a great variety during the Summer
Quarter, with several particularly no
table contributions.

On the evening of July 3 Senorita
Eliza Espinel will present a series of
"Vivid Songs of Spain," in the Union
court, providing an evening of Span
ish atmosphere in this court which
lends itself to this spirit. A Spanish
evening in the Union court is a fea
ture of every Summer Quarter.

Another outstanding Tuesday eve
ning will be provided by Dr. Jose
Yasconcelos, the eminent Mexican
scholar who will be at Stanford to
give two series of lectures on Latin-
American affairs. His Tuesday eve
ning lecture will be on "Latin Amer
ica Today."

Added interest may be expected in
the lecture by Dr. David S. Muzzey,
of the faculty of political science at
Columbia Univeresity, from the fact
that he is author of textbooks in his
tory which were sensationally at
tacked by Mayor Thompson of Chi
cago as un-American and destructive
of loyalty and patriotism, but which
are still employed in California pub
lic schools.

Derby hats are becoming more and
more popular with university and col-

ege students
