# DAVIS TELLS IMPRESSIONS OF DRAMA IN EUROPE, U.S.
## 
### 
Gordon Davis, director of dra
matics at Stanford, who some
years ago left the legitimate stage
to accept the position which he
now holds, has recently returned
from a year's travel during which
he observed stage methods and
productions throughout the United
States and Europe.
On his way to the Continent last
fall, Davis stayed for a number of
weeks in Detroit, directing for the
Bonstelle Civic Theatre of that
city.
Saw European Theatres
His European itinerary included
London, Paris, Rome, Vienna,
Budapest, Munich, Dresden, Ber
lin, and other centers of the Con
tinental stage. In these cities he
not only saw productions from the
viewpoint of the audience, but from
backstage, observing the new tech
nique and meeting many players.

"The magnificent state theatres

of central Europe particularly impressed me," said Davis, "by their organiza
tion, their ideals and their standards. It seems to me that the American
universities can, by striving, someday hold a relatively high position."
Praises Yale Dramatics
On his return Davis visited a number of university theatres and dramatic
schools. "The Yale school of dramatics, with its stage and equipment, is a
model which other colleges should emulate," he remarked.
He will give a lecture at 8 o'clock Tuesday in the Little Theatre on "The
Trend of the Theatre in Central Europe Today."
With him comes Harold Helvenston as Stanford's new art and technical
director and instructor in Theatre Workshop. Helvenston has had years of
rigorous traifffng through designing for professional productions in New York,
and previously in Yale's famous Theatre Workshop 47 class under George
Pierce Baker.
