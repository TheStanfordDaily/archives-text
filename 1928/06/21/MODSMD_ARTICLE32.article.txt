# FRENCH AND SPANISH CONVERSATION TABLES ARE OPENED AT UNION
## Linguists May Eat in Groups Exclusively Speaking These Languages 
### 
Students of French and Spanish
have the opportunity to take their
meals at tables at which only these
languages will be spoken during the
quarter. A special dining room has
been set aside for their use in the
Union, and the tables will be headed

in this country.
Experienced Instructors

born in France, received an A.B. de
gree at the University of Bordeaux
and also later from Western College
at Oxford, Ohio, and holds the di
ploma de professeur de francaise a
l'etranger, which certifies to her abil
ity to impart her language to those
not born in France. She is on the
teaching staff of the Department of
Romanic Languages this summer.
Senorita Perez is a graduate of the

Master's degree from the University
of Kansas. She is taking advanced
work at Stanford this quarter.

The first meal for these groups will
