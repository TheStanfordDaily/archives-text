# WILBUR TELLS STUDENTS OF OPPORTUNITIES AT STANFORD
## 
### 
Stanford, like many American

Universities, is in a constant state
of change and development. You
will find many things of interest
on the campus outside of the im
mediate field in which you are
working. You are urged to take
advantage of the opportunity af
forded by your stay to get to know
the University, in addition to fol
lowing the regular program.

Over half of the enrolment in the
Summer Quarter is composed of
graduate students. It will be in
teresting for many of you to know
what are some of the problems
which they are working on, and
the facilities which we have here

for them.
The student-body is made up of
representatives of most of the
Union, and several of the foreign
countries. Stanford is a residence
University and an unusual oppor
tunity is afforded students to know
which is fostered by our campus lil

one another and to enjoy the relationship
ife. â€”RAY LYMAN WILBUR.
