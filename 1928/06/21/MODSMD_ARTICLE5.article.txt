# Sellards Urges Students To Share In All Summer Quarter Activities
## 
### 
Most of you have come to Stanford
for some definite course of study. You
also have an opportunity here to ex
tend the scope of your interests and
to take advantage of the opportunities
which the community offers in sum-

mer.
There will be frequent public lec
tures on many subjects. A group of
visiting preachers of various denomi
nations will deliver the sermons at
the Memorial Church. A series of
musical programs has been arranged
in addition to the organ recitals in
the Memorial Church.

In addition to the various concerts
and recitals which the University will
provide for those on the campus,
many Summer Quarter students will
welcome the opportunity to attend a
series of Sunday afternoon Symphony
Concerts in the open air at Hills
borough, near Stanford. These con

certs will begin on June 24th, and the
programs will be given by members
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra under the direction of dis
tinguished conductors. A special low
rate for tickets has been made for
Stanford students, and for those who
have no cars there is direct automo
bile service from the campus to the
Woodland Theatre.

In order that those of you who are
newcomers may see the principal
points of interest in this region of
California with congenial compan
ions, automobile excursions have been
arranged for week-ends throughout

the quarter.
We hope that in addition to ac
complishing the work which has
brought you to Stanford, you will
have a pleasant and satisfactory sum
mer with us.
JOHN A. SELLARDS.
