Protect Your Belongings |
During Vacation Period I
Worry and anxiety are not desirable companions on a vacation
that is intended for pleasure and recreation. One of the chief causes
of uneasiness when away from home is the constant fear that some
thing might happen to valuable articles that of necessity are left be
hind. In their haste to get away to the mountains or seashore, many
persons overlook the importance of providing protection for their
personal belongings. •
A small investment in an American Trust Company safe deposit
box offers a certain safeguard against loss by fire or robbery. Bulky
articles, trunks, suitcases, etc., also may be stored in American Trust
Company vaults at nominal expense during the vacation period. A
trifling cash outlay now may prevent the loss of or destruction of
treasured possessions.
