By Italian Author
"Right You Are —If You Think You
Are" will be presented on August 17.
This final production of Stanford's
summer season is from the pen of Pi
randello, foremost of Italian dra
matists, creator also of "Seven Char

with a varied dish of dramatics,
abundantly seasoned with laughs,' is
the promise of the Dramatic Council.
