# EDUCATION DEPARTMENT PLANS TEXT EXHIBITION
## 
### 
The Department of Education will
hold its annual textbook exhibit July
9 to 14 in Room 300. This exhibit,
always of special interest to educa
tional workers, will be quite complete.
Many requests for space have already
been received from the various pub
lishing houses, some twenty-two com
panies having signified their intention
of participating in the exhibit.
The general public will be wel
comed to the display. It may be noted
that there will be many titles having
a general appeal aside from their
value as texts.
