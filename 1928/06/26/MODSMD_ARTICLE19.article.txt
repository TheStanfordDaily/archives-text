The Summer Quarter is on exactly the same academic plane as the
other quarters; there is no let-down whatever in requirements in scholar
ship and no tendency toward the superficial character that used to mark the
old-time "summer school" of some colleges. The Summer Quarter offers
and calls for regular university work—and on account of the high quali
fications and earnestness of the typical Summer Quarter student the level
of scholarly performance is in some respects even higher than the usual
normal, lending that much additional power to the competitive spirit in
scholarly achievement.
But at the same time the Summer Quarter has its own distinctive char
acter. The very season of the year has its influence. Summer is a normal
time for recreation, and this must not be wholly overlooked. Many Sum
mer Quarter students are spending here what would otherwise be their
vacation, and must return to their regular pursuits soon after the close of
the term.
There is no real conflict or difficulty in these two needs—high scholarly
effort and recreation of body and mind. Study is easy on the Stanford
campus in the summer; there is none of the lassitude that flattens those
who try to work in less favorable places. Recreation is gained by changing
work even more successfully than by quitting work altogether.
Particularly is recreation, renewal of freshness for the routine work of
the rest of the year, made available at Stanford during the summer through
the variety of opportunities that are offered in lectures on many topics, in
musical programs, and in excursions to neighboring points of interest.
These are not "courses" but they bring to the mind new and inspiring
ideas, and they lend to the spirit the uplift that comes from exercise. A
student can carry on his class work with greater zest if he takes the time
for a lecture, or for an hour of music, or for a day in the redwoods and
on the seashore.
True wisdom will make students realize that these offerings which do
not appear in the Announcement of Courses and for which "credit" is not
given are just as much a part of education, nevertheless —in some respects
a more important part. A sensible Summer Quarter schedule of time will
make definite provision for these extra-curricular opportunities and not
leave them as merely items that will be included if nothing else interferes.

ideas, and they lend to the spirit the uplift that comes from exercise. A
student can carry on his class work with greater zest if he takes the time
for a lecture, or for an hour of music, or for a day in the redwoods and
on the seashore.
True wisdom will make students realize that these offerings which do
not appear in the Announcement of Courses and for which "credit" is not
given are just as much a part of education, nevertheless —in some respects
a more important part. A sensible Summer Quarter schedule of time will
make definite provision for these extra-curricular opportunities and not
leave them as merely items that will be included if nothing else interferes.
