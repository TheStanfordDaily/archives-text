# Campus Traffic Rules
## 
### 
The roads on the campus are public roads so far as the operation of the
state motor vehicle act is concerned, and the same regulations as to speed
limits and conduct apply. But the enforcement of those rules so far as
students are concerned rests in the hands of the student councils, backed
by the University and recognized by the police.
A student, therefore, who receives a tag from the traffic officer on the
campus is cited to appear before the Men's Council or the Women's Coun
cil rather than before an off-campus judge. The University has endowed
these student organizations with this power, and the power is theirs, sub
ject only to the final approval of the President of the University.
I f a student drives on the campus as he ought to drive everywhere he
will have no personal contact with this disciplinary body, but it might be
well to glance at the information given in another column of the Daily,
just on general principles. Then bear in mind that there is no question of
the authority of the University and of its power to exact the penalties on
all students so long as they remain students. This authority, growing out
of the power to cancel registration for cause, does not apply to any but
students, but it applies completely and finally to them.
