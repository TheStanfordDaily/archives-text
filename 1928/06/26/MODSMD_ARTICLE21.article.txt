# Hoover Legends
## 
### 
Around Herbert Hoover, Republican candidate for the presidency, are
gathering stories that already are partaking of the nature of legends, as is
natural in view of the American fondness for idealizing its conspicuous
figuresâ€”and for idealizing them according to the accepted formula in such
cases. For example, since it is a fact that Hoover worked his way through
Stanford the legend must necessarily be that he waited on tables. That is
the accepted mode for a legend about a great man who earned his way
through college. Hoover did support himself during his Stanford student
days; he had to. But, being Hoover, he devised his own scheme for earn
ing money. He was Hoover then as he is Hoover now, and a chief Hoover
characteristic is the inclination to accomplish a necessary end by new and
better methods than the usual. Hoover organized the first laundry agency
on the campus. That called for exactness, brought good money, and left
his time more at his disposal for other things. He worked for the head of
his major department, John Casper Branner, around the office. That
afforded opportunity for educational contacts as well as money.
With the time he did not have to put in waiting on tables Hoover was
able to have a little leisure for citizenship duties in the Stanford commun
ity, and naturally he found a chief interest in the improvement of organi
zation methods and executive duties. He made over the system of financial
and athletic management. Being Hoover, he did the job so well that it
stood the test of time.
True Hoover stories fit Hoover as he is. The legends may be good
stories, but they don't always fit Hoover, even though they may fit the
average American.
