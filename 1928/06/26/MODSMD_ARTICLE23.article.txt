Unforbidden Fruit, by Warner Fa
bian: Boni and Liveright; New
York (1928). $2.00.
Warner Fabian, the author of
"Flaming Youth" and "Summer Bach
elors," has produced a new book un
der the title of "Unforbidden Fruit."
The book, as the title suggests, is
psuedo-sophisticated, trite modern
ism. It is the story of a girls' college,
a picture of esoteric types that Mr.
Fabian believes to exist, and a 319-
page informal dissertation on female
virginity stressed in vocal action. A
fairly well written, frothy novel wrap
ping up a lot of sophomoric conversa
tions, soppy with college-worldliness
and modern story-banality—this is all
that one can say of "Unforbidden
Fruit." It is a maslin of unprofound,
momentary philosophy. The major
criticism of the book is that it is
about as unusual and different as a
government mail box.
As usual, Fabian has failed to pro
duce an individual; all the characters
are types who have merely been
graced with a few exceptionalities of
character composition to save them
from being commonplace. There are
the same standard impeti, and the
same accepted reactions to them;
again the reader meets the same prob
lems and discovers the same solu
tions. It is an average modern novel.
What a damning statement.

Fabian again returns to his old
mistress, Sex. Yet he has had the
good taste, as always, to refrain from
brewing a mess of soul-tearing, ultra
real sex problems; he has only skim
med off the bubbles. No one minds
them, for they have no consistency
and leave no after-taste.
The book is written in Fabian's ex
pected style: the efforts of a con
scious stylist, and the conversational
reproductions of a realist who is
driven to refurbish to remain scintil
lating. The work never palls, for it
has the charm that comes with wit.
and natural effervescence. One may
turn adverse criticism against this
type of presentation, but the execu
tion bears praise.
The characters are interesting, just
as the objects of backyard-gossip are
interesting, but there is not one strik
ingly outstanding personage, nor is
there one that is blessed with the en
chanting virtue of originality. Either
women are very much the same in
their attitude toward virginity, or all
authors have the same mistaken idea.
"Unforbidden Fruit" is filled with con
ventional unconventional characters.
The book, in my opinion, is Warner
Fabian's best work. This, however,
does not make it a masterpiece. If
you have time to waste, play bridge;
if you cannot play bridge, read "Un
forbidden Fruit."
—LAIRD DOYLE.
