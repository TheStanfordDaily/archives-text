# PENDRAGON PLAYERS STAR CAMPUS ACTORS IN COMIC PRODUCTION
## Anna May Price Directs "The Bad Man" in Absence of Mrs. Kisich 
### Laird Doyle 
The Pendragon Players presented
Porter Emerson Browne's famous
satirical comedy, "The Bad Man," in
the Palo Alto High School auditorium
Saturday night. With a cast almost
entirely of present or past campus
players under the direction of Anna
May Price, the production was pre
sented to a full house.
Miss Price, in the absence of Mrs.
Kisich, Pendragon director, took over
the directorship, and with two of her
former stars, Lucie Bentley and Ray
Haizlip, and many other well known
and experienced amateur actors un
der her, created one of the best dra
matic presentations to be seen on the
campus or in its vicinity for some
time.
Haizlip Takes Role
Ray Haizlip who played the part of
Caesar in the recent campus play,
"Caesar and Cleopatra," also ap
peared in the Broadway production
of "The Bad Man" with Hobart Blinn.
His performance as Morgan Pell was
perhaps the most finished of the
characterizations. However, James
Quinby, Stanford '18, stole the show
with his work as Pancho, the bad
man. It even surpassed his remark
able portrayal in "What Price Glory."
Lucie Bentley, whose parts in "The
Lady and the Rose" and "Dear Bru
tus" gained her popularity as a cam
pus actress played a weak part ex
tremely well. Other campus actors

I of both past and present years were:
! Guido Marx, George Hays, Walter
Hays, Malcolm McGilvray, and A. L.
Crawford. All played their parts to
advantage, particularly Malcolm Mc-
Gilvray who took the character,
Pedro.
Lighting Very Effective
Le√üoy Stransky, who has done un
usual staging on the Stanford stage
as well as elsewhere, did an almost
perfect job of set creation and light
ing. This set will be his last work in
California as he is going in the pro
fessional field in the east.
The exceptional abilities of Miss
Price, the experienced talent, and the
fortunate selection of a play, all made
for a wonderful wind-up of the Pend
ragon season.
