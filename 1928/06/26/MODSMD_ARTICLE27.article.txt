# SANTA CRUZ WILL BE DESTINATION OF TRIP OVER SCENIC ROUTE
## Excursion Is to Be Through Giant Redwoods; Tour of "Beauty Ahead" 
### 
The second weekly excursion to
places of interest on the peninsula
will leave from the Stanford Union
Saturday morning at 8 o'clock. This
trip will be over the Lqs Gatos grade,
through the redwoods to Santa Cruz,
about fifty miles south of here, and
will take in the cliff drive just
beyond Santa Cruz which is noted
for its scenic beauty.
Santa Cruz has an excellent beach
and those who wish may go swimming
although most tourists prefer to spend
their time in sight-seeing.
The fare for the trip will be three
dollars, and should be deposited in
advance. Reservations may be made
in the office of the Director of the
Summer Quarter and must be in by
5 o'clock Thursday afternoon. Pas
sengers will take their own lunch.
The cars will return to the campus
at about 4 o'clock.
Last Saturday a trip was made to
Pebble Beach via La Honda and San
Gregorio. Pebble Beach is three miles
beyond Pescadero on the coast, about
25 miles from Stanford.
As is not unusual with the first off
campus excursion of the Summer
Quarter, the number taking the trip
to La Honda Saturday was small, but
those who took it are recommending
to their friends that they drive over
the mountains to the ocean by this
route before the summer is over if
they have not done so before. The
trip to Santa Cruz offers much the
same type of scenery.
Airplane rides for each graduating
senior is the latest feature of Senior
Week at the University of Colorado.
