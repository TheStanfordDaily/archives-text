# DISEASE MADE AID TO WORLD BY SCIENTISTS
## Lecturer Tells How Ergot Was Transformed Into Valuable Drug 
### 
How an old foe of mankind has been
transformed by science and made use
ful to the world and humanity was
the story told by Dr. George Barger,
professor of chemistry in relation to
medicine at Edinsburgh and Fellow
of King's College, Cambridge, who
lectured in the Little Theater last
Friday afternoon on "Ergot and Ego
tism." This was the first of a series
of popular lectures by well-known
scientists.
Although the cause of terrible suf
fering in early times, science has
found ergot a great boon to humanity,
he explained, when used as a drug.
Defining ergot as an infection of rye
which poisons grain, causing at times
a constriction of the blood vessels
and resulting in purification of mem
bers of the body which drop from
the body, Dr. Barger pointed out that
as early as the sixteenth century it
was discovered this infection of rye
was useful in stopping hemorrhages.
Ergot, on analysis, is found to be
an alkaloid which stimulates action
of the muscles which, at the same
time, causes a constriction of the
blood vessels. Certain American doc
tors have found it of value in the
field of obstetrics.
Doctor Barger, who is also Profes
sor of Chemistry, Royal Holloway
College, University of London, and
chemist with the Committee on Medi
cal Research during the World War,
is in America lecturing at several
American universities and serving as
visiting professor at Cornell.
Speaking historically of ergot and
ergotism, Dr. Barger noted that in
medieval times rye was the most im
portant food of central Europe. In
years of lean harvest when the grain
became infected with ergot, plague
followed. In Aquitania 40,000 people
succumbed to ergotism in the year
944. The last great epidemic came in
1770, when one-third of the grain was
found to be poisoned. Once the cause
of the disease was found, its rages
were checked, but modern days have
not been entirely free, as in these post
war days Liverpool authorities found
Russian immigrants suffering from
ergotism.
Lacking scientific knowledge of the
malady, the people of the Middle
Ages attributed it to supernatural
causes. Translating the Latin freely,
they said, "It causes a pitiable calam
ity, striking the members like a sword
of holy fire." St. Anthony became in
terested in medicine and the relief of
the plague, so the peasants finally re
ferred to it as St. Anthony's fire.
About 1093 people expected the mil
lennium. It was the beginning of the
Crusades, and crops were neglected.
Therefore a terrible plague followed.
Pope Urban II founded the Order of
St. Anthony at Vienna, where the
bones of the saint had been buried.
The convent of this order became a
refuge for sufferers from "St. An
thony's Fire."
Germany plans to send 280 to the
Olympic Games at Amsterdam, about
60 of which will be women athletes.

malady, the people of the Middle
Ages attributed it to supernatural
causes. Translating the Latin freely,
they said, "It causes a pitiable calam
ity, striking the members like a sword
of holy fire." St. Anthony became in
terested in medicine and the relief of
the plague, so the peasants finally re
ferred to it as St. Anthony's fire.
About 1093 people expected the mil
lennium. It was the beginning of the
Crusades, and crops were neglected.
Therefore a terrible plague followed.
Pope Urban II founded the Order of
St. Anthony at Vienna, where the
bones of the saint had been buried.
The convent of this order became a
refuge for sufferers from "St. An

How an old foe of mankind has been
transformed by science and made use
ful to the world and humanity was
the story told by Dr. George Barger,
professor of chemistry in relation to
medicine at Edinsburgh and Fellow
of King's College, Cambridge, who
lectured in the Little Theater last
Friday afternoon on "Ergot and Ego
tism." This was the first of a series
of popular lectures by well-known
scientists.
Although the cause of terrible suf
fering in early times, science has
found ergot a great boon to humanity,
he explained, when used as a drug.
Defining ergot as an infection of rye
which poisons grain, causing at times
a constriction of the blood vessels
and resulting in purification of mem
bers of the body which drop from
the body, Dr. Barger pointed out that
as early as the sixteenth century it
was discovered this infection of rye
was useful in stopping hemorrhages.
Ergot, on analysis, is found to be
an alkaloid which stimulates action
of the muscles which, at the same
time, causes a constriction of the
blood vessels. Certain American doc
tors have found it of value in the
field of obstetrics.
Doctor Barger, who is also Profes
sor of Chemistry, Royal Holloway
College, University of London, and
chemist with the Committee on Medi
cal Research during the World War,
is in America lecturing at several
American universities and serving as
visiting professor at Cornell.
Speaking historically of ergot and
ergotism, Dr. Barger noted that in
medieval times rye was the most im
portant food of central Europe. In
years of lean harvest when the grain
became infected with ergot, plague
followed. In Aquitania 40,000 people
succumbed to ergotism in the year
944. The last great epidemic came in
1770, when one-third of the grain was
found to be poisoned. Once the cause
of the disease was found, its rages
were checked, but modern days have
not been entirely free, as in these post
war days Liverpool authorities found
Russian immigrants suffering from
ergotism.
Lacking scientific knowledge of the
malady, the people of the Middle
Ages attributed it to supernatural
causes. Translating the Latin freely,
