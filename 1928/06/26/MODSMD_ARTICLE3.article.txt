# ROBLE JOLLY-UP TO JOLLY WELL MAKE STUDENTS JOLLIER
## 
### 
Every Summer Quarter student is
invited to a Jolly-Up to be held Fri
day evening, June 29 at Roble Hall
from 9 until 1 o'clock. The reception
will be strictly informal according to
John H. Sellards, Director of the Sum
mer Quarter, who is sponsoring the
get-together.
For those who do not care to dance,
card tables will be provided in the
lobby. George Tackabury's orchestra
of five pieces will play for the danc
ing, which will take place in the
dining room of the Hall.
It is urged by Director Sellards and
Miss Olivia Boezinger, Social Director
of Roble Hall, that all the Summer
students attend the reception and
make it a real "jolly-up" affair.
