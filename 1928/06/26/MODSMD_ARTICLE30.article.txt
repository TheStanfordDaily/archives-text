# CARE IN ADDRESSING MAIL WILL PREVENT POST OFFICE DELAYS
## Schedule for Distribution Collection Announced by Authorities 
### 
Postmaster W. C. Werry of the
Stanford postoffice asks that students
and faculty members have their mail
addressed to General Delivery, box
numbers, or street addresses, rather
than to the halls and dormitories, as
there is no delivery service to these
living quarters. Postmaster Werry
said yesterday that there will be little
or no delay in service if the students
will meet this request.
Old forwarding addresses should be
canceled if students do not wish their
mail to be sent to the last address
given. Failure to do this may result
in delayed delivery.
The campus postoffice has just re
ceived notice that beginning July 1
post cards, including private mailing
cards, will be sent at the rate of one
cent when addressed to the United
States, Mexico, Spain, Panama, Ar
gentine, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador,
Guatemala, Haiti, Republic of Hon
duras, Newfoundland, Nicaragua,
Paraguay, Peru, Salvador, Dominican
Republic, and Uruguay. The rate was
formerly two cents.
