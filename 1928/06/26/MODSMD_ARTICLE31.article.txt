# FOOD RESEARCHERS GIVE REGISTRATION MEAL TO WISE BIRD
## 
### 
Further evidence that the owl is a
very wise bird was borne out on
registration day, for a lusty young
barn owl canvassing the University
established himself in the Food Re
search Institute and found that he
| was in the right place.
After a short search this young and
i enterprising bird secured a fine meal
i of minced beef stake on a window
I sill of the Institute. The reception
j accorded the visitor by Dean Culver
j and Professor Alonzo Taylor was
j more than appreciated by the owl, for
when the day's work was over and all
had gone home, he forced his way
back into the Institute via the tran
som.
This infraction of University rules
has -resulted in the ejection of the
ambitious bird from the University.
When last seen he was wending his
way toward the University barns. It
is believed that he is going home to
get the rest of the family to take the
food research course.
Deaf children will have a chance
to learn lip-reading in a special free
class at the University of California
during the summer session.
