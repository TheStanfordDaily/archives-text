# HOLBROOK BLINN, '95, FAMOUS ACTOR, DIES IN EAST FROM INJURY
## 
### 
Holbrook Blinn, Ex-'95 famous actor
and former Stanford student, died at
"Journel's End," his country home on
the Hudson River, from blood poison
ing which developed Sunday night
from an injury to his right arm sus
tained when he fell from his horse
two weeks ago.
Blinn was born in San Francisco in
1572 and entered Stanford in 1892
where he became the sole editor and
manager of the first Stanford publi
cation, The Sequoia, a literary maga
zine, as well as president of the
sophomore class. Chester Fernald,
noted playwrite who later wrote "The
Cat and the Cherub" in which Blinn
appeared in its first production in
London was to enter Stanford and
aid Blinn in the editorship of The
Sequoia; however Fernald failed to
register and Blinn carried out his idea
alone. Working under Blinn at this
time were two students who were
later to become famous: Charles K.
Field, editor of The Sunset Maga
zine, and Frank Norris, popular novel
ist. During some controversy over
the material that should appear in
The Sequoia between the faculty and
Blinn, the famous Ambrose Bierce
came to the defense of the young
editor. The first editorial written by
Blinn was one that predicted that
Stanford would be the greatest col
lege in the West.

In 1593 Blinn left Stanford to be
gin his career as an actor. He ob
tained a part on Broadway in The

New South and from tliat time oil
climbed to the position he held in the
regard of the public at the time of
his death â€”one of the most popular
actors on the American and English
stages. His work in Browne's satiri
cal play, "The Bad Man," gained for
him great recognition which was
sustained by his last play, "the Dove."
Blinn's creations on the legitimate
stage as well as in motion pictures
commanded for him high praise from
American and foreign critics.
