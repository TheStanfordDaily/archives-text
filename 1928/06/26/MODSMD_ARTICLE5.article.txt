# KOECHLIN PRESENTS PLEASING PROGRAM IN BRANNER LOBBY
## 
### 
Branner Hall dining room was pro
vided with a musical setting yester
day afternoon, when M. Charles
Koechlin, eminent composer and
critic, gave a lecture-recital on con
temporary French music, assisted by
Miss Catherine Urner.
"A musical theme always means
something," M. Koechlin declared.
"It cannot be a bare succession of
notes." He expressed himself in pro
found sympathy with the younger
group of French composers, especially
those known to Paris as "The Six":
Milhaud, Poulene, Auric, Tailleferre,
Buret, and Homegger.
They are characterized by the use
of tonality, successive chords, and
modulation. Their art is dynamic, in
spired largely by the sense of speed
and violence that machinery gives to
modern life. M. Koechlin, however,
finds in the work of these men an
underlying motif of real human feel
ing that ranges from the humorous
to great suffering.
Miss Catherine Urner in her recital
of modern French songs provided an
interesting interpretation of the
theories set forth by M. Koechlin.
She sang the following groups:
1. Birth of Buddha —Delage.
2. Songe—Henri Sauget.
3. Venice —poem by Be Musset, mu
sic by Ren^e-Philippart.
4. The Potter —from Sheherazade,
poem by Tristan Klingsor, set to
music by Charles Koechlin, and
among his most recent composi
tions.
