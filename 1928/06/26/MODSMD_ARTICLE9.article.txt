Sttudent control of the campus
traffic situation went into effect Dec

and arranged the proper locations
for the officers in order to most
efficiently handle campus traffic.

the Summer Quarter will be under the
jurisdiction of the Men's Council as
usual. The women residing in Roble

Hall will be under the supervision of
the Roble Committee of Five. All
women living outside the Hall will
be under the direct control of Dean
Mary Yost.
The Men's Council is composed of
Clark Cypher, Chairman; Templeton
Peck, who is also Student Body Presi
dent for the Summer Quarter, Harry
Call, and Edward Smith.
Jean Stewart is president of the
Committee of Five. Elizabeth Clark
and Mary Virginia Cooper are the
only others which heve been chosen.
Roble Club will elect the other two
members in two weeks.
Campus traffic violations by the
men will be handled through the
Men's Council. Any violations by the
women will be in the hands of the
Dean of Women, who have been voted
this power for the summer by the
outgoing Women's Council.
