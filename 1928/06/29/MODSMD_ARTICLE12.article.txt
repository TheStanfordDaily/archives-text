# JULY 4 FEATURED IN SUNDAY ORGAN RECITAL BY WARREN D. ALLEN
## 
### 
Anticipating Independence Day,
Warren D. Allen, university organist,
will repeat the "Hands Across the
Seas" recital that he played last
Thursday afternoon at the regular
Sunday evening recital at 7:30 o'clock.
English and American music will be
featured. The opening number will be
"The Bells of St. Anne de Beaupre,"
by Russell.
An interesting feature of the pro
gram will be the Andante from the
"London Symphony" by Ralph
Vaughan-Williams. The entire sym
phony, from which this slow move
ment is taken, was played at the open
ing of the summer concerts at Hills
borough. A prize composition, the
Legende from the "Suite in B Minor,"
by Ernest Douglas, will also appear
on the program. The composer re
sides in Southern California. Edward
Bairstow's popular favorite "Evening
Song" will be played. The concert
ends with the Finale from the "Third
Suite" by Edward Shippen Barnes,
who is at St. Stephens', Philadelphia.
This swinging, brilliant number truly
justifies his being called one of the
great exponents of the modern Ameri
can school of music.
