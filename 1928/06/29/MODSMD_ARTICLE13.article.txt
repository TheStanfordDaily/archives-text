# "STANFORD TWINS" TO GIVE WEEKLY PROGRAM
## 
### 
Ralph H. Richardson, '28, and
George C. Richardson, '26, have now
become radio artists. After their trip
south with the Stanford Glee Club
this spring, the two brothers appeared
over stations KGO in Oakland and
KQW at San Jose. At present they
may be heard every Monday night
from 10 to 12 o'clock over radio KPO
at San Francisco. They appear under
the names of Nip and Jonah, the
Stanford Twins, and have already
made a name for themselves as radio
entertainers through their popular
programs of harmonica and harmony.
