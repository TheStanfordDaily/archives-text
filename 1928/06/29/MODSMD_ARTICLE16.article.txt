# SPECIALTIES FEATURE CHANGES IN SPANISH AND FRENCH TABLES
## To Have Two Meals Per Day; Students May Sign Up For One or Both 
### 
The French and Spanish Tables
have been reorganized on a new five
day basis with only lunch and dinner
being served. Students may sign for
one or two meals a day. Students
signing up under this new plan will
be at liberty to eat wherever they
wish on week-ends, but they will be
required to pay for either the ten
weeks' term or the six-weeks' term in
advance.
For those who have signed for the
Spanish table, Senorita P6rez, di
rector of the table, is planning to en
tertain the table with Spanish music
and dancing, with regular Spanish
regalia. Spanish newspapers are
available.
"If you would like to feel for a
while that you are in Spain, you
should visit the Spanish table at the
Stanford Union. The every-day speech
of the street, with bits of â€¢ Spanish
slang, as well as the pure Castillian
is heard. There, you have a chance
to train your ear to the swing of a
foreign tongue. You will learn many
things connected with your interests
as a student, as a teacher, or as a
scholar of the Cervantes speech,"
says Senorita P<srez.
Beginning Monday, July 2, the rate
for the ten-weeks' term will be $27
for one meal per day, and $54 for two
meals per day. The rate for the six
weeks' term will be $15 for one meal
per day and $30 for two meals per
day.
Information in regard to the French
table will appear in an early issue.
