# GORDON DAVIS CHOOSES CAST OF FIRST PLAY
## Announce Three Changes; to Present Queen's Husband Next Friday Rehearsals Now Under Way for Sherwood's Satire on Royal Life 
### 
Gordon Davis yesterday announced
that the cast for the first play of the
Summer Quarter, "The Queen's Hus
band" has been finally selected and
rehearsals are now well under way.
The Sherwood comedy-satire will be
presented in the Assembly Hall next
Friday night. Yesterday's announce
ment disclosed three changes in the
play's casting.
Mrs. Corinne Franklin is the final
choice for the part of Princess Anne,
whose mother, the Queen, arranges a
"highly advantageous" betrothal be
tween her and Prince William of
Greek, dissolute heir to a neighbor
ing throne. Secretly the Princess
loves the King's secretary, a com
moner and son of a plumber.
The Princess' lover, Frederick
Granton, will be portrayed by Rich
ard Stewart. The romance between
these two serves to demonstrate that
biology is mightier than monarchy.
Harold Brownson, who last summer
appeared in "Loyalties" and took the
leading male role in "Craig's Wife,"
has been cast as Lord Birten, suave
Foreign Minister and one of the lead
ers of the tottering conservative gov
ernment.
The author of "The Queen's Hus
band" has woven some delightful phil
osophy with the laughs, which are
frequent and well placed. He has
handled skilfully the scenes during
which the mild King Eric VIII, played
by Gordon Davis, drags the royal pre
rogative from its "stable" and gives
it some "much-needed exercise." A
bombardment of the palace during
Act II employs several unique tricks
of off-stage technique.
Tickets for this first production of
the summer season will be placed on
general Quad sale next Tuesday
morning.
