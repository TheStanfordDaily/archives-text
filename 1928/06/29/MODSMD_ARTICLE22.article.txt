# Eliminate Thievery
## 
### 
On this page will be found a letter from a Stanford student. This
letter is in regard to a petty theft, a theft involving little monetary con
sideration, but much annoyance and disgust. Needless to say, such affairs
as this should not happen on a college campus, particularly, that of a
college whose reputation and traditions stand as firm against such conduct
as do Stanford's.
This letter calls attention to only one of the numerous cases of thievery
on the campus of late. It is very possible and indeed, probable, that these
thefts are the work of people from off campus. If so, it is the duty of
every Stanfordite to keep watch and immediately report anyone on the
campus who is not acting up to the requirements set for the "Stanford
gentleman."
If it is true, and we hate to admit even the possibility, that the Stan
ford students themselves are the guilty ones, it should be sufficient to re
mind these students that the spirit of the honor system applies to conduct
outside as well as inside the classrooms. If these students are beyond the
point where an appeal to the honor sytem is of any avail, it becomes the
duty of all of us to watch for infractions and report them to the proper
authorities.
