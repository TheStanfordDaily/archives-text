The Summer Quarter Daily, which comes out Tuesdays and Fridays,
is an afternoon paper instead of a morning paper as is the regular Daily.
There was some irregularity in the distribution of the first two issues,
which was caused by the large number of late registrations. Hereafter the
paper will appear at the same hour each publication day, and will be sent
to all subscribers.
Distribution will be made by carrier to all halls and living groups, and
the papers will be out not later than 5 o'clock. Papers for Palo Alto and
campus distribution will be sent by mail and, through the courtesy of the
post office authorities, will be obtainable after 5 o'clock.
Students pay for the paper in their "community fee" on registration
day. Faculty members and others who wish to subscribe can mail their
subscriptions to The Stanford Daily, Box 3014, Campus, or telephone
the Daily, Palo Alto 1074.
Subscribers who do not get their papers are asked to telephone the
Daily. We would appreciate subscribers telling their complaints to us
instead of to their friends.
