# Come and Get Acquainted
## 
### 
Roble Hall will hold an All-University jolly-up and dance tonight to
provide an opportunity for the men and women of the University to get
acquainted. Bridge playing will be in order for those who do not care to
dance.
If you can't dance and don't play bridge, come anyway. You will have
some fun watching people who think that they can dance go through the
motions, and listening to some of the people who learned to play bridge
over radio expound their theories. Furthermore refreshments will be
served.
Everyone is assured of a good time for jolly-ups are informal affairs
where everyone knows everyone else without being introduced, and will
start a conversation on the slightest provocation. For the benefit of the
more conventional, or shall we say bashful, a committee has been ap
pointed to see that everyone gets acquainted and has a good time.
