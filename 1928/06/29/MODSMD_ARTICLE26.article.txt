# STANFORD TIDE-MARKS
## 
### 
To the newcomer at Stanford—even
to some who call themselves old-timers
—much can be seen of the past eras of
the University, written in the physical
structures of the campus, if he has as
his guide a man who can interpret these
evidences as an archaeologist or pale
ontologist reads the records of antiqui
ties in the earth's antiquities.

In the early days "the Row" meant
Alvarado Row and was an abbrevia
tion of "Faculty Row," since the first
faculty houses were built on that
street, which was hurriedly scraped
out of wheat fields for the purpose.
Lasuen street, "Fraternity Row," is
now "the Row."

Sequoia Ilall is the original Roble. The
searcher for prehistoric remains will find
over in the back of Sequoia a big de
pression which was dug to be the base
ment of a girls' dormitory matching En
cina in size. The Founders' desire to
have a dormitory of some sort for the
women after it became clear that there
would not be time to erect the proposed
big building before the University
opened its doors for the first time led to
the hurried erection of the smaller struc
ture.

The Museum building and Sequoia
Hall were among the first concrete

buildings ever built. Tradition is that
the Museum was the very first structure
built by this then new process. Sequoia
was made of concrete instead of stone in
order to save time in the attempt to
have a dormitory ready for the women
when the first students came.

Lagumta, which is so picturesque a
feature of campus landscape and campus
life, was created as a reservoir for irri
gation purposes on the Palo Alto ranch
long before the idea of a university had
entered the Stan fords' minds. Its waters
are still useful for irrigation when the
lake begins to dry up.

The oldest thing on the campus in the
way of buildings in the Eoble gym. Com
paring this weather-beaten, woodpecker
perforated wooden survival of the Uni
versity's first year with the equipment of
the men's physical education department
shows why not only the women but all
others of Stanford's population arc try
ing to find a way to secure a new gym
for the Five Hundred.

In the first days and for a consid
erable number of years the building
now occupied by the German depart
ment was the administration building.
It comfortably housed the offices of
the president and the registrar and
all their staffs and files. President
Wilbur's first office was in this build
ing.
