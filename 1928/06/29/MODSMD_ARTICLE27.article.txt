## Traditions at Stanford 
### 
There are few traditions at Stan
ford, hut these few deserve mention
because they are the survivors of the
many that have been started at dif
ferent times during the history of the
University. Some of these died a nat
ural death because there was no sense
In having them, and others were killed
by certain students who brought fea
tures into these traditions that made
them so disgusting that the Adminis
tration abolished them.
Stanford is somewhat different from
some universities in that the students
think for themselves instead of doing
what has been the custom in years
past. Whenever a tradition has out
lived its usefulness and become ted
ious it is discarded. Stanford was
one of the first to abolish sophomore
discipline or freshman hazing, which
is still a custom in some colleges.
Then the class of 1929 rebelled
against the petty rules which fresh
men were supposed to follow, but
rarely did, and now there only remain
a couple of the more frivolous tradi
tions.
There are a larger number of the
more serious traditions which are
still in force, although some are on
the wane. These all have a purpose
and should be followed by summer
students. The more frivolous are still
in force and should be followed, to
give the glamor of regular college
days if for no other reason.
No attempt is made to enforce any
tradition at Stanford as it is all left
up to the student. You can make
yourself a part of the University by
knowing these traditions and living
up to them. If you do not follow them
you will be hurting no one, but you
will be losing a part of what Stanford
has to offer you.

The Hello Tradition has been men
tioned before in the editorial columns.
It is one tradition that is really a
Stanford tradition and is only one
sign of the democratic spirit at Stan
ford. In regular quarters there are so
many students that it is becoming in
convenient, and it will probably not
be a great many years until it passes
into that final resting place where
good traditions go, for it is one tradi
tion that is typical of the University
and one that could not suffer degra
dation at the hands of students who
go "too far." In Summer Quarter,
however, there are few enough stu
dents so that it is possible to say
"Hello."
Some people have got the Hello
idea but the majority seem afraid to
speak. We advise these people to
"get on the boat" for they will make
a great many more acquaintances and
have a much pleasanter quarter if
they carry out this idea. So start out
the day tomorrow by learning the
Hello habit.

"No Smoking on the Quad" was the
request of Mrs. Stanford and was
probably one of Stanford's first tradi
tions. It is certainly not a difficult
tradition to comply with and keeps
the Quad from being littered with
cigarette butts, although Mrs. Stan
ford probably didn't have this in mind
when she made the request. It also
creates a better impression on vis
itors, who do not see groups of young
collegians standing around in front
of classrooms with cigarettes dang
ling from their mouths.

The Honor System cannot strictly
be called a tradition for it is also an
institution because it is not voluntary
and violators are punished. Reliance
is placed on the honesty of students
not to cheat in examinations or class
work. The Men's Council and the
Roble Committee of Five will handle
violations and punish offenders. The
Honor System does not need any
words of praise for it is the only wise
plan to follow among University
students.
Violations of the Honor System are

more important, however, than viola
tions of any tradition for the offender
not only hurts himself but he cheats
someone else. Most courses in the
University are graded on the "class
average" plan and the man or woman
who cheats forces another person to
take a lower .grade, in securing a
higher one for himself.

There are a number of other tradi
tions that have no connection with
summer quarters, such as rules gov
erning conduct at athletic contests,
so we will pass over these without
mention. The only frivolous tradi
tions that are worth mentioning are:
women and freshmen shall not walk
up or down the Law Steps or hang
around them, and underclassmen
shall not wear cords.

To our knowledge at least one
woman has used the Law Steps and
received the applause and hand-clap
ping which is accorded this action in
regular college times. To prevent
further embarrassment to members
of the weaker sex, and to prevent any
freshmen from hanging around the
Law Steps and listening to the
learned conversation which takes
place there, it must be explained that
the Law Steps are directly opposite
the Library, slightly to the right, and
have a cement stone at the bottom.
It might also be added, for the
benefit of the weaker sex, that walk
ing down the Law Steps is a very
easy way of attracting attention.

The custom of not allowing under
classmen to don cords is one that is
followed in most colleges. The writer
has been told of a couple of cases this
quarter where underclassmen were
wearing cords, not because they
didn't know about the tradition but
because they thought that they were
getting away with something.
As far as the writer is concerned
these young "freethinkers" may wear
cords all day and sleep in them at
night, if it makes them feel any
smarter. It is our guess that very
few people will be fooled into believ
ing that they are upperclassmen, and
a great many will think that they are
high school boys.

woman has used the Law Steps and
received the applause and hand-clap
ping which is accorded this action in
regular college times. To prevent
further embarrassment to members
of the weaker sex, and to prevent any
freshmen from hanging around the
Law Steps and listening to the
learned conversation which takes
place there, it must be explained that
the Law Steps are directly opposite
the Library, slightly to the right, and
have a cement stone at the bottom.
It might also be added, for the
benefit of the weaker sex, that walk
ing down the Law Steps is a very
easy way of attracting attention.

The custom of not allowing under
classmen to don cords is one that is
followed in most colleges. The writer
has been told of a couple of cases this
quarter where underclassmen were
wearing cords, not because they
didn't know about the tradition but
because they thought that they were
getting away with something.
As far as the writer is concerned
these young "freethinkers" may wear
cords all day and sleep in them at
night, if it makes them feel any
smarter. It is our guess that very
few people will be fooled into believ
ing that they are upperclassmen, and
a great many will think that they are
high school boys.

There are few traditions at Stan
ford, hut these few deserve mention
because they are the survivors of the
many that have been started at dif
ferent times during the history of the
University. Some of these died a nat
ural death because there was no sense
In having them, and others were killed
by certain students who brought fea
tures into these traditions that made
them so disgusting that the Adminis
tration abolished them.
Stanford is somewhat different from
some universities in that the students
think for themselves instead of doing
what has been the custom in years
past. Whenever a tradition has out
lived its usefulness and become ted
ious it is discarded. Stanford was
one of the first to abolish sophomore
discipline or freshman hazing, which
is still a custom in some colleges.
Then the class of 1929 rebelled
against the petty rules which fresh
men were supposed to follow, but
rarely did, and now there only remain
a couple of the more frivolous tradi
tions.
There are a larger number of the
more serious traditions which are
still in force, although some are on
the wane. These all have a purpose
and should be followed by summer
students. The more frivolous are still
in force and should be followed, to
give the glamor of regular college
days if for no other reason.
No attempt is made to enforce any
tradition at Stanford as it is all left
up to the student. You can make
yourself a part of the University by
knowing these traditions and living
up to them. If you do not follow them
you will be hurting no one, but you
will be losing a part of what Stanford
has to offer you.

The Hello Tradition has been men
tioned before in the editorial columns.
It is one tradition that is really a
Stanford tradition and is only one
sign of the democratic spirit at Stan
ford. In regular quarters there are so
many students that it is becoming in
convenient, and it will probably not
be a great many years until it passes
into that final resting place where
good traditions go, for it is one tradi
tion that is typical of the University
and one that could not suffer degra
dation at the hands of students who
go "too far." In Summer Quarter,
however, there are few enough stu
dents so that it is possible to say
"Hello."
Some people have got the Hello
idea but the majority seem afraid to
speak. We advise these people to
"get on the boat" for they will make
a great many more acquaintances and
have a much pleasanter quarter if
they carry out this idea. So start out
the day tomorrow by learning the
Hello habit.

"No Smoking on the Quad" was the
request of Mrs. Stanford and was
probably one of Stanford's first tradi
tions. It is certainly not a difficult
tradition to comply with and keeps
the Quad from being littered with
cigarette butts, although Mrs. Stan
ford probably didn't have this in mind
when she made the request. It also
creates a better impression on vis
itors, who do not see groups of young
collegians standing around in front
of classrooms with cigarettes dang
ling from their mouths.

The Honor System cannot strictly
be called a tradition for it is also an
institution because it is not voluntary
and violators are punished. Reliance
is placed on the honesty of students
not to cheat in examinations or class
work. The Men's Council and the
Roble Committee of Five will handle
violations and punish offenders. The
Honor System does not need any
words of praise for it is the only wise
plan to follow among University
students.
Violations of the Honor System are

more important, however, than viola
tions of any tradition for the offender
not only hurts himself but he cheats
someone else. Most courses in the
University are graded on the "class
average" plan and the man or woman
who cheats forces another person to
take a lower .grade, in securing a
higher one for himself.

There are a number of other tradi
tions that have no connection with
summer quarters, such as rules gov
erning conduct at athletic contests,
so we will pass over these without
mention. The only frivolous tradi
tions that are worth mentioning are:
women and freshmen shall not walk
up or down the Law Steps or hang
around them, and underclassmen
shall not wear cords.

The Honor System cannot strictly
be called a tradition for it is also an
institution because it is not voluntary
and violators are punished. Reliance
is placed on the honesty of students
not to cheat in examinations or class
work. The Men's Council and the
Roble Committee of Five will handle
violations and punish offenders. The
Honor System does not need any
words of praise for it is the only wise
plan to follow among University
students.
Violations of the Honor System are

more important, however, than viola
tions of any tradition for the offender
not only hurts himself but he cheats
someone else. Most courses in the
University are graded on the "class
average" plan and the man or woman
who cheats forces another person to
take a lower .grade, in securing a
higher one for himself.

There are a number of other tradi
tions that have no connection with
summer quarters, such as rules gov
erning conduct at athletic contests,
so we will pass over these without
mention. The only frivolous tradi
tions that are worth mentioning are:
women and freshmen shall not walk
up or down the Law Steps or hang
around them, and underclassmen
shall not wear cords.

To our knowledge at least one
woman has used the Law Steps and
received the applause and hand-clap
ping which is accorded this action in
regular college times. To prevent
further embarrassment to members
of the weaker sex, and to prevent any
freshmen from hanging around the
Law Steps and listening to the
learned conversation which takes
place there, it must be explained that
the Law Steps are directly opposite
the Library, slightly to the right, and
have a cement stone at the bottom.
It might also be added, for the
benefit of the weaker sex, that walk
ing down the Law Steps is a very
easy way of attracting attention.

The custom of not allowing under
classmen to don cords is one that is
followed in most colleges. The writer
has been told of a couple of cases this
quarter where underclassmen were
wearing cords, not because they
didn't know about the tradition but
because they thought that they were
getting away with something.
As far as the writer is concerned
these young "freethinkers" may wear
cords all day and sleep in them at
night, if it makes them feel any
smarter. It is our guess that very
few people will be fooled into believ
ing that they are upperclassmen, and
a great many will think that they are
high school boys.

There are few traditions at Stan
ford, hut these few deserve mention
because they are the survivors of the
many that have been started at dif
ferent times during the history of the
University. Some of these died a nat
ural death because there was no sense
In having them, and others were killed
by certain students who brought fea
tures into these traditions that made
them so disgusting that the Adminis
tration abolished them.
Stanford is somewhat different from
some universities in that the students
think for themselves instead of doing
what has been the custom in years
past. Whenever a tradition has out
lived its usefulness and become ted
ious it is discarded. Stanford was
one of the first to abolish sophomore
discipline or freshman hazing, which
is still a custom in some colleges.
Then the class of 1929 rebelled
against the petty rules which fresh
men were supposed to follow, but
rarely did, and now there only remain
a couple of the more frivolous tradi
tions.
There are a larger number of the
more serious traditions which are
still in force, although some are on
the wane. These all have a purpose
and should be followed by summer
students. The more frivolous are still
in force and should be followed, to
give the glamor of regular college
days if for no other reason.
No attempt is made to enforce any
tradition at Stanford as it is all left
up to the student. You can make
yourself a part of the University by
knowing these traditions and living
up to them. If you do not follow them
you will be hurting no one, but you
will be losing a part of what Stanford
has to offer you.

The Hello Tradition has been men
tioned before in the editorial columns.
It is one tradition that is really a
Stanford tradition and is only one
sign of the democratic spirit at Stan
ford. In regular quarters there are so
many students that it is becoming in
convenient, and it will probably not
be a great many years until it passes
into that final resting place where
good traditions go, for it is one tradi
tion that is typical of the University
and one that could not suffer degra
dation at the hands of students who
go "too far." In Summer Quarter,
however, there are few enough stu
dents so that it is possible to say
"Hello."
Some people have got the Hello
idea but the majority seem afraid to
speak. We advise these people to
"get on the boat" for they will make
a great many more acquaintances and
have a much pleasanter quarter if
they carry out this idea. So start out
the day tomorrow by learning the
Hello habit.

"No Smoking on the Quad" was the
request of Mrs. Stanford and was
probably one of Stanford's first tradi
tions. It is certainly not a difficult
tradition to comply with and keeps
the Quad from being littered with
cigarette butts, although Mrs. Stan
ford probably didn't have this in mind
when she made the request. It also
creates a better impression on vis
itors, who do not see groups of young
collegians standing around in front
of classrooms with cigarettes dang
