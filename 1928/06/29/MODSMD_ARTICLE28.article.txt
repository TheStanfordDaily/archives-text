Gee! But I'm mad . . . just boiling
. . . and I don't care who knows it.
Tuesday night I left my car parked
on the campus between the hours of
6 and 1:20. Well, after the gabfest
was over I blithely stepped into my
car, reached to shift the gears and to
my utter dismay my hand did not
touch the familiar smooth agate sur
face it was used to. Instead there was
only a sharp greasy stub to shift with.
Seems to me that's a mighty small
(and I say it with a sneer) thing to
do.
It wasn't much, no, but Gee, I was
proud of that gear top. I suppose you
say why raise such a fuss over so in
significant a thing. I won't hide by
replying, "It's the principle of the
thing!" I want that agate top to my
gear shift returned and the guilty per
son will find my car parked in the
same spot from 8:30 to 9:30 Friday
night. No, I won't watch for you
either . . . HONEST!
