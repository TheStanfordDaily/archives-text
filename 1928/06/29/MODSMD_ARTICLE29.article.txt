# DAVIS SPEAKS AT TUESDAY LECTURE
## Recent Trip Through Europe Gives Intimate Touch to Talk on Theaters 
### 
In an informal talk at the opening
of the Tuesday evening lecture series
for the Summer Quarter, Gordon
Davis, director of dramatics, gave his
impressions of the theater received
while travelling in Europe. After see
ing the New York productions, Davis
spent several weeks in London. "On
the whole, play production and acting
proved disappointing," he said. "Lit
tle effort was spent on lighting effects
and scenery, and the serious dramatic
acting had a tendency to be over
done."
Davis, however, paid due tribute to
the English in their development of
the drawing-room comedy. "Progress
is sometimes retarded by the extreme
loyalty of the English audiences to
their famous thespians, who, past
their prime, have become set in their
mode of acting."
Davis Sees Improvement
Davis predicted great improvement
through the activities of the many
theatrical societies which are doing
for England what the Little Theatre
movement has done for the United
States. "It is interesting to note that
the Festival Theatre at Cambridge is
run along the same progressive lines,"
he said.
Davis said that he reached the cli
max of his trip in Central Europe.
"It was there that I found the peak
of dramatic perfection. With the gov
ernment subsidizing the theater, di
rectors have a freer rein in produc
tion, as they are not so limited by
box-office receipts."
Predicts State Theater
"The day will come when it will be
deemed as legitimate for the taxpayer
to support a state theater as for him
to support a state university, for it is
a sure means of spreading culture
and education, and has a tremendous
socializing influence," Davis said.
Davis approved of the popularity
of the revues in England and on the
continent because they often serve
as an excellent medium for experi
mental stage-craft, many novelties
being introduced.
