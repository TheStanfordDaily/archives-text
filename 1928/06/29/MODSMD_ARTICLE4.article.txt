# Draper Returns From East; Tells Of Card Possibilities For Olympics
## 
### 
Murray Draper, Stanford track man
ager and president of the A.S.S.U.
last year, has returned to the campus
after traveling east with the cham
pionship Cardinal track team. Draper
traveled a total of 10,000 miles and
returns here to rest a week before
starting on a 17,000-mile trip to Aus
tralia with the baseball team.
Draper is enthusiastic over the suc
' cess of the Stanford trackmen in the
east and predicts that Stanford will
place at least six men on the Ameri
can Olympic games team, although
he feels that all of the eleven Cards,
now in the east, are strong contenders
for places on the team.
Seven Strong Candidates
"Templeton picks seven of the
Stanford men as outstanding candi
dates, but figures that at least one of
these men will fail because of illness,
injury or the rise of some unknown
star. He feels certain that he will
take six of his championship team
with him," said Draper.
"Bob King, Eric Krenz, Ward Ed

| monds, Harlow Rothert, Kim Dyer,
| Captain Bud Spencer, and Captain
! elect Ross Nichols, are the men
! picked by Templeton as having pretty
nearly sure chances of investigating
the wooden shoe story at the expense
of the Olympic Games Committee this
summer. Dink figures that he is being
unnecessarily pessimistic in counting
out one of these seven men, for he
feels that one or two of the other
four Cards should come through."
Others Have Chance
In discussing the chances of the
other four Cardinals who will compete
in the Olympic Games tryouts for
places on the team, Draper said,
"Kibby and Sparling are both capable
of throws which will qualify them.
However, the field in this event ap
pears to be the strongest of the meet,
and competition wiU be unusually
keen if the entrants equal their best
marks of the season. Kibby has been
handicapped in his training at Bow
doin by an attack of measles, which
sent him to the college infirmary two
days ago. However, he is now able
to work out again and should be in
shape for the trials.
Forster Is Possibility
"A1 Forster has possibilities of
equaling the performance of his team
mates in the shot. But it is a matter
of circumstance whether he has his
good day at the trials. Clarence West
will enter the 400-meter hurdles. Al
though he has never run a full 400-
meter hurdles race for time, he is
capable of 50 seconds in the quarter,
and should be able to do fairly well
with the work he is doing at Bowdolu
to prepare him."
Draper said that the Olympic
Games Committee decided that the
first three men in each event in the
trials next week will make the trip
to Amsterdam. A fourth man will be
chosen in each event. This fourth
man will be chosen on the basis of
his past record, or may win his place
on the merit of his performance in
the trials.
Will Pick Three
Each country entering a team in the
Olympics will be allowed to enter
only three men in each event. The
United States team will be made up
of the full quota plus an alternate in
each event. The coaches may not de
cide which of the four men will be
the alternate until they reach Amster
dam.

A hitherto unknown primitive race
which lived in Algeria, Northern
Africa, at least 25,000 years ago, has
been discovered.

Nine and a quarter million Italians
live outside the mother country.

starting on a 17,000-mile trip to Aus
tralia with the baseball team.
Draper is enthusiastic over the suc
' cess of the Stanford trackmen in the
east and predicts that Stanford will
place at least six men on the Ameri
can Olympic games team, although
he feels that all of the eleven Cards,
now in the east, are strong contenders
for places on the team.
Seven Strong Candidates
"Templeton picks seven of the
Stanford men as outstanding candi
dates, but figures that at least one of
these men will fail because of illness,
injury or the rise of some unknown
star. He feels certain that he will
take six of his championship team
with him," said Draper.
"Bob King, Eric Krenz, Ward Ed

| monds, Harlow Rothert, Kim Dyer,
| Captain Bud Spencer, and Captain
! elect Ross Nichols, are the men
! picked by Templeton as having pretty
nearly sure chances of investigating
the wooden shoe story at the expense
of the Olympic Games Committee this
summer. Dink figures that he is being
unnecessarily pessimistic in counting
out one of these seven men, for he
feels that one or two of the other
four Cards should come through."
Others Have Chance
In discussing the chances of the
other four Cardinals who will compete
in the Olympic Games tryouts for
places on the team, Draper said,
"Kibby and Sparling are both capable
of throws which will qualify them.
However, the field in this event ap
pears to be the strongest of the meet,
and competition wiU be unusually
keen if the entrants equal their best
marks of the season. Kibby has been
handicapped in his training at Bow
doin by an attack of measles, which
sent him to the college infirmary two
days ago. However, he is now able
to work out again and should be in
shape for the trials.
Forster Is Possibility
"A1 Forster has possibilities of
equaling the performance of his team
mates in the shot. But it is a matter
of circumstance whether he has his
good day at the trials. Clarence West
will enter the 400-meter hurdles. Al
though he has never run a full 400-
meter hurdles race for time, he is
capable of 50 seconds in the quarter,
and should be able to do fairly well
with the work he is doing at Bowdolu
to prepare him."
Draper said that the Olympic
Games Committee decided that the
first three men in each event in the
trials next week will make the trip
to Amsterdam. A fourth man will be
chosen in each event. This fourth
man will be chosen on the basis of
his past record, or may win his place
on the merit of his performance in
the trials.
Will Pick Three
Each country entering a team in the
Olympics will be allowed to enter
only three men in each event. The
United States team will be made up
of the full quota plus an alternate in
each event. The coaches may not de
cide which of the four men will be
the alternate until they reach Amster
dam.
