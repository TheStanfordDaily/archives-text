# Draper Returns From East; Tells Of Card Possibilities For Olympics
## 
### 
Murray Draper, Stanford track man
ager and president of the A.S.S.U.
last year, has returned to the campus
after traveling east with the cham
pionship Cardinal track team. Draper
traveled a total of 10,000 miles and
returns here to rest a week before
starting on a 17,000-mile trip to Aus
tralia with the baseball team.
Draper is enthusiastic over the suc
' cess of the Stanford trackmen in the
east and predicts that Stanford will
place at least six men on the Ameri
can Olympic games team, although
he feels that all of the eleven Cards,
now in the east, are strong contenders
for places on the team.
Seven Strong Candidates
"Templeton picks seven of the
Stanford men as outstanding candi
dates, but figures that at least one of
these men will fail because of illness,
injury or the rise of some unknown
star. He feels certain that he will
take six of his championship team
with him," said Draper.
"Bob King, Eric Krenz, Ward Ed

| monds, Harlow Rothert, Kim Dyer,
| Captain Bud Spencer, and Captain
! elect Ross Nichols, are the men
! picked by Templeton as having pretty
nearly sure chances of investigating
the wooden shoe story at the expense
of the Olympic Games Committee this
summer. Dink figures that he is being
unnecessarily pessimistic in counting
out one of these seven men, for he
feels that one or two of the other
four Cards should come through."
Others Have Chance
In discussing the chances of the
other four Cardinals who will compete
in the Olympic Games tryouts for
places on the team, Draper said,
"Kibby and Sparling are both capable
of throws which will qualify them.
However, the field in this event ap
pears to be the strongest of the meet,
and competition wiU be unusually
keen if the entrants equal their best
marks of the season. Kibby has been
handicapped in his training at Bow
doin by an attack of measles, which
