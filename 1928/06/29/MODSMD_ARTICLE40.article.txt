Those who are intending to take
the Saturday excursion trip to Santa
Cruz might be interested to know
that in a garden at Logan Heights
within the shadow of Santa Cruz the
loganberry was originated. Its origi
nation was the accidental and unex
pected result of an experiment to pro
duce a new and cultivated blackberry.
In the fall of 1880, the Hon. Judge
James J. H. Logan, an amateur florist
and pomologist of more than local re
nown, after whom the new berry was
named, commenced some experiments
in his home garden to find a new and
perfect blackberry.
Judge Logan planted the Texas
Early, a domestic blackberry that was
an early bloomer —blooming at the
same time as the wild blackberry—
in the first row, and the wild black
berry in the second row to secure a
cross between the two. In the third
row he planted an old form of rasp
berry known as the Red Antwerp, and
through the natural crossing of the
raspberry and the blackberry, the
loganberry resulted. He also secured
the mammoth blackberry, the object
of the experiment.
