Sunset Gun, by Dorothy Parker: Boni
Liveright; New York, (1928).
"Sunset Gun" is a refreshing col
lection of poems written in Dorothy
Parker's usual cynical yet whimsical
tone. The easy cadence seems to be
the result of ephemeral spontaneity;
even the profpund is not ponderous.
If you wish some idea of the style,
take the compositional endings of
Adams, the syclironization of Hous
man; and the enamoring, studied
resignation of Millay. This might be
a superficial definition of Parker's
work.
The rather bitter philosophy is
framed either in an exotic reaction to
an incident, or in a mode of presenta
tion bordering almost on flippancy—a
bar of soap in a candy wrapper. The
grace of the lines is never distorted
by the solidness of their meaning,
for the subject-treatment tempo lends
itself to the manner structured. Doro
thy Parker never forgets that she is a
poet.
This is the whole of a poem called
"Two-volume Novel";
"The sun's gone dim, and
The moon's turned black;
For I loved him, and
He didn't love back."
One may gleam from this the obvious
subtlety which gains, by its very
sheerness and directness, the pathos
of emotion. Dorothy Parker makes a
passive demand for the appreciation
of attitude.
The lines are devoid of that weary
lean which is so palpable in lines that
have been battered into conformity.
By some occultness, they fall into a
formation of lyric naturalness; it con
tains that something called "effort
less art."

Many who read her preceding book, |
"Enough Rope," feared that another j
collection might prove that she could !
not maintain her succinct charm, but
"Sunset Gun" dispels all fears; it has
all the power and beauty of her
former work.
The first poem in the book, "God
mother," is the best; perhaps it is the ;
most superior piece of poetry that
Dorothy Parker has ever written.
The simplicity, the rhythmical flow
of language, the thought conveyed,
and the natural as well as formal ca
dence, when found as a mass, creates
a most finished impression. Were this
poem all, the book would be a success.
The sad-faced humor of Dorothy
Parker is humor of a droll and
pointed character. Ironical wit sea- |
sons the entire work, but how far it
is from being ribald.
"Sunset Gun" is an interesting col
lection of clever, well written, clear
headed, lyrical po,ems.

tion bordering almost on flippancy—a
bar of soap in a candy wrapper. The
grace of the lines is never distorted
by the solidness of their meaning,
for the subject-treatment tempo lends
itself to the manner structured. Doro
thy Parker never forgets that she is a
poet.
This is the whole of a poem called
"Two-volume Novel";
"The sun's gone dim, and
The moon's turned black;
For I loved him, and
He didn't love back."
One may gleam from this the obvious
subtlety which gains, by its very
sheerness and directness, the pathos
of emotion. Dorothy Parker makes a
passive demand for the appreciation
of attitude.
The lines are devoid of that weary
lean which is so palpable in lines that
have been battered into conformity.
By some occultness, they fall into a
formation of lyric naturalness; it con
tains that something called "effort
less art."

Many who read her preceding book, |
"Enough Rope," feared that another j
collection might prove that she could !
not maintain her succinct charm, but
"Sunset Gun" dispels all fears; it has
all the power and beauty of her
former work.
The first poem in the book, "God
mother," is the best; perhaps it is the ;
most superior piece of poetry that
Dorothy Parker has ever written.
The simplicity, the rhythmical flow
of language, the thought conveyed,
and the natural as well as formal ca
dence, when found as a mass, creates
a most finished impression. Were this
poem all, the book would be a success.
The sad-faced humor of Dorothy
Parker is humor of a droll and
pointed character. Ironical wit sea- |
sons the entire work, but how far it
is from being ribald.
"Sunset Gun" is an interesting col
lection of clever, well written, clear
headed, lyrical po,ems.

Sunset Gun, by Dorothy Parker: Boni
Liveright; New York, (1928).
"Sunset Gun" is a refreshing col
lection of poems written in Dorothy
Parker's usual cynical yet whimsical
tone. The easy cadence seems to be
the result of ephemeral spontaneity;
even the profpund is not ponderous.
If you wish some idea of the style,
take the compositional endings of
Adams, the syclironization of Hous
man; and the enamoring, studied
resignation of Millay. This might be
a superficial definition of Parker's
work.
The rather bitter philosophy is
framed either in an exotic reaction to
an incident, or in a mode of presenta
tion bordering almost on flippancy—a
bar of soap in a candy wrapper. The
grace of the lines is never distorted
by the solidness of their meaning,
for the subject-treatment tempo lends
itself to the manner structured. Doro
