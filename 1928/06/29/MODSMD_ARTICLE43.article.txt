"American literature has a future,"
says Professor Fernand Balden
sperger, who is here for the Summer
Quarter to give several courses in
French literature.
Professor Baldensperger is profes
sor of Comparative Literature in the
Sorbonne University of Paris, editor
of the French magazine, "La Revue
de la Litterature Comparee" and is
also a member of the Institute of
France. This is his third visit to
America in the capacity of visiting
professor. He was at Harvard the
first time and some time later he
came to Columbia by special invita- I
tion of President Butler.
The professor speaks English with
great fluency and has written several
essays on American authors. He is
specially interested in Edgar Lee Mas

ters, of Spoon lliver Anthology fame,
and Eugene O'Neill the playwright.
He is watching the development of
American literature with great inter
est and sees in it a likeness to the
French literature after the period of
Zola.

Moscow, Russia, has just seen fo
the first time a "quick-lunch'! countei
of the type familiar to Americans.
