## 
### 
"Our education has too much been
stereotyped along narrow scholastic
and academic lines," said President
Wilbur in an address to the national
conference on state parks in the
Mark Hopkins Hotel, San Francisco,
yesterday morning. "To my mind, it
shows better education to know the
number and the width of the rings in
a great tree and their significance
than to know the number and dispo
sition of the wives of Henry VIII.
"The state parks offer a great field
to the scientist and the student. Sim
ply from the standpoint of education
and the development of science, we
need these state and national parks."
President Wilbur urged the preser
vation of natural beauty spots in our
rapidly expanding life. "We shall
have a sounder population if we can
give our people memories of trees
and trails instead of cabarets and
can openers," he said.
