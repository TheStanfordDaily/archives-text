# CARD NINE TO SAIL THURSDAY FOR AUSTRALIA
## Wolter To Take 13 Players With Him on Tour to The Antipodes First Two Games Will Be Played at Pago-Pago In Fiji Islands 
### 
Led by Coach Harry Wolter and
Captain-elect Frank Wilton, the Stan
ford baseball team, comprising a
party of seventeen, will set sail from
San Francisco next Thursday noon,
aboard the liner Sierra, for
Australia. The Cards will be the first
college baseball team, and with the
exception of the New York Giants,
who visited Australia on their round
the-world tour of 1908, the only
American baseball team that has ever
toured that country.
Before the team returns they will
have covered approximately 17,000
miles. Their first stop after leaving
San Francisco will be Honolulu. They
will arrive there the morning of the
eleventh, and leave at 4 o'clock that
afternoon. The first game will be
played at Pago-Pago, one of the isl
ands of the Fiji group, when the team
arrives there on July 16. Their oppon
ents will be a mixed team made up
of natives and United States sail
ors stationed in that vicinity.
On the twenty-sixth the team ar
rives in Sidney. Two days later they
tackle the New South Wales or a Vic
toria team. On the thirtieth they meet
the South Australians. On Wednesday,
August 1, they play the Metropolitan
nine, and on the fourth, the Austra
lian team. On the following Monday,
they tackle the Sidney University
team. Wednesday, the eighth, they
meet a team representing the city of
Sidney, and on the following Satur
day they play a second game with the
Australian team. These are all the
games that have been definitely sche
duled to date.
To Play Only Amateurs
With the exception of the Univer
sity of Sidney, every team on the
schedule will be made up of amateur
all-stars. Baseball in Australia is a
comparatively new game, but these
people are learning it rapidly. New
ball fields are being laid out, and
children are being encouraged to
learn the game. In the course of time
it may replace, at least partly, their
present national game of cricket.
No games have been definitely
scheduled for New Zealand, but it is
probable that the team will spend
several days there on their return trip
as they are scheduled to return via
Auckland. If no games are scheduled
with Hawaiian teams for the return
trip, the team will leave Australia
about August 20, returning via New
Zealand and Hawaii to arrive in San
Francisco Thursday, September 13.
Take Four Pitchers
The following members of the team
will make the trip: Wilton, outfielder;
Berg, catcher and outfielder; Lewis,
pitcher; Kern, pitcher; Pliilippi,
pitcher; Riese, pitcher and utility;
Maguire, first baseman; Garibaldi,
second' baseman; Busch, shortstop;
Laird, third baseman; Levin, out
fielder; Harder, outfielder; Paxton,
catcher.
Besides the players, there will be
Coach Wolter and Mrs. Wolter, Mur
ray Draper, who will act as manager,
and Alexis Ehrman, baseball manager
for 1929.

comparatively new game, but these
people are learning it rapidly. New
ball fields are being laid out, and
children are being encouraged to
learn the game. In the course of time
it may replace, at least partly, their
present national game of cricket.
No games have been definitely
scheduled for New Zealand, but it is
probable that the team will spend
several days there on their return trip
as they are scheduled to return via
Auckland. If no games are scheduled
with Hawaiian teams for the return
trip, the team will leave Australia
about August 20, returning via New
Zealand and Hawaii to arrive in San
Francisco Thursday, September 13.

will make the trip: Wilton, outfielder;
Berg, catcher and outfielder; Lewis,

Led by Coach Harry Wolter and
Captain-elect Frank Wilton, the Stan
ford baseball team, comprising a
party of seventeen, will set sail from
San Francisco next Thursday noon,
aboard the liner Sierra, for
Australia. The Cards will be the first
college baseball team, and with the
exception of the New York Giants,
who visited Australia on their round
the-world tour of 1908, the only
American baseball team that has ever
toured that country.
Before the team returns they will
have covered approximately 17,000
miles. Their first stop after leaving
San Francisco will be Honolulu. They
will arrive there the morning of the
eleventh, and leave at 4 o'clock that
afternoon. The first game will be
played at Pago-Pago, one of the isl
ands of the Fiji group, when the team
arrives there on July 16. Their oppon
ents will be a mixed team made up
of natives and United States sail
ors stationed in that vicinity.

lian team. On the following Monday,
they tackle the Sidney University
team. Wednesday, the eighth, they
meet a team representing the city of
Sidney, and on the following Satur
day they play a second game with the
Australian team. These are all the
games that have been definitely sche
duled to date.

With the exception of the Univer
sity of Sidney, every team on the
schedule will be made up of amateur
all-stars. Baseball in Australia is a
