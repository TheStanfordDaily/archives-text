# HOLMAN, LAST YEAR'S CAPTAIN, NEW PACIFIC COAST TENNIS CHAMP
## 
### 
Cranston Holman, '27, three years
member of the Stanford tennis team
and last year's captain, is now Pacific
Coast tennis champion. He has claim
to this title by right of his defeat of
Robert Seller, University of Califor
nia player, in a match held last Sun
day on the Berkeley Tennis Club
courts. The games score was 6-3, 7-5,
3-6, 6-1.
Due to the retirement of William
Johnston, last year's champion, the
title has been able to pass into new
hands. Holman has had the distinc
tion of being one of the outstanding
players on the coast for the past six
years.
The former Stanford star worked
himself up to the finals by success
fully defeating some of the coast's
foremost stars. He displayed the
same game that won for him the na
tional junior title in 1925, and never
during the entire tournament was he
in danger of being defeated.
Paired with Gerald Stratford, Hol
man reached the finals of the Pacific
Coast doubles, and only after three
hard-fought sets was he and his part
ner forced to acknowledge defeat to
Robert Seller and Neil Brown.
Holman at present is studying medi
cine in San Francisco. Because of his
work he is unable to go East for the
summer tournaments.
