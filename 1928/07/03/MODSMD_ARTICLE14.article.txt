# Senorita Espinel Presents Spanish Program Tonight
## Brilliant Background Will Form Setting For Folk Songs of Old Spain 
### Louise Lambert 
In the beautiful costumes of the
people of the Spanish provinces Seno
rita Luisa Espinel will sing folk-songs
of Spain from a balcony of the Stan
ford Union court tonight at 8:30
o'clock. This is a regular Tuesday
program, and the first of a series of
summer concerts. There will be no
charge.
Soft colored lights, a summer sky,
and the arches and balconies of the
court make a perfect setting for a
Spanish program. The senorita is ac
customed to creating the illusion of
Spain in the conventional auditorium
with a simple curtain as a back wall,
but she has said in her cultivated
English that she would like for her
songs a patio, a garden, a brilliant
sky. Here, then, will be found such a
setting.
Costumes Add Effect
The interesting variation between
the regions of Spain is set forth by
the clever artist in folk-songs from
Castile, from Galicia, and from Valen
cia. Beautiful costumes of brilliant
color characterize each group.
Dressed in an Austrian peasant cos
tume Senorita Espinel sings "Ro
mance del Lindo del Lindo Amigo"
from Asturia, "Muineira" from Gali
cia, "Los Pastores" from Castile,
"Resalada" from Mt. Gredos, "Canto
de Pandeira" from Galicia; and a
Valencian peasant costume makes
"Jota" from Valencia, "Canto de la
Trilla" from Murcia, "Canto de Ser
eno" from Valencia, and "El Platero"
from Murcia more colorful.
Sings California Songs
Early California songs include "Ro
mance de Elena," "Un Pajarito," and
"El Zapatero."
The last group—"El Vito," Nin;
"Madrigal Espanol," Huarte; and an
air from : :a Hijas de Zebedec," Chapi
—is sung in an Andalucian gypsy cos
tume.
Before singing these folk-songs,
which are accompanied by Margot
Hughes at the piano, the Senorita
translates them, and they are far from
the usual Spanish program of music
with its "La Paloma," its "Habanera."
Highly Praised
A Madrid newspaer calls Luisa Es
pinel's New York concert "a lesson in
good taste" and adds, "Spanish danc
ers and singers who apear on foreign
stages, even the most-renowned, are
prone to show themselves dominated
by the spirit of the inevitable tam
bourine, with that exotic costuming
that seems to be made to order (for
our enemies) for exportation. The
classic costumes and adornments of
the different Spanish provinces, so
beautiful and so characteristic, are
rarely seen outside of Spain, because
the Spaniards themselves seem to be
bent upon doing everything possible
to prevent these things from being
known to the world.
"Luisa Espinel, who delighted us
with the pure timbre of her voice,
and with her art of exquisite enchant
ment, arrayed herself in our authen
tic provincial costumes without one
concession to the conventionalism so
lamentably adopted by almost all the
Spanish artists. This enchanting
North American, granddaughter of
Spaniards, who has baptized herself
with the very Spanish name of Luisa
Espinel, has said that she hopes only
to offer her countrymen living exam
ples of the old songs of Spain."
Despite his 80 years, Dan O'Leary,
one of the greatest pedestrians of all
times, covers fifteen miles every day
just for the fun of it.

"Resalada" from Mt. Gredos, "Canto
de Pandeira" from Galicia; and a
Valencian peasant costume makes
"Jota" from Valencia, "Canto de la
Trilla" from Murcia, "Canto de Ser
eno" from Valencia, and "El Platero"
from Murcia more colorful.
Sings California Songs
Early California songs include "Ro
mance de Elena," "Un Pajarito," and
"El Zapatero."
The last group—"El Vito," Nin;
"Madrigal Espanol," Huarte; and an
air from : :a Hijas de Zebedec," Chapi
—is sung in an Andalucian gypsy cos
tume.
Before singing these folk-songs,
which are accompanied by Margot
Hughes at the piano, the Senorita
translates them, and they are far from
the usual Spanish program of music
with its "La Paloma," its "Habanera."
Highly Praised
A Madrid newspaer calls Luisa Es
pinel's New York concert "a lesson in
good taste" and adds, "Spanish danc
ers and singers who apear on foreign
stages, even the most-renowned, are
prone to show themselves dominated
by the spirit of the inevitable tam
bourine, with that exotic costuming
that seems to be made to order (for
our enemies) for exportation. The
classic costumes and adornments of
the different Spanish provinces, so
beautiful and so characteristic, are
rarely seen outside of Spain, because
the Spaniards themselves seem to be
bent upon doing everything possible
to prevent these things from being
known to the world.
"Luisa Espinel, who delighted us
with the pure timbre of her voice,
and with her art of exquisite enchant
ment, arrayed herself in our authen
tic provincial costumes without one
concession to the conventionalism so
lamentably adopted by almost all the
Spanish artists. This enchanting
North American, granddaughter of
Spaniards, who has baptized herself
with the very Spanish name of Luisa
Espinel, has said that she hopes only
to offer her countrymen living exam
ples of the old songs of Spain."
Despite his 80 years, Dan O'Leary,
one of the greatest pedestrians of all
times, covers fifteen miles every day
just for the fun of it.
In the beautiful costumes of the
people of the Spanish provinces Seno
rita Luisa Espinel will sing folk-songs
of Spain from a balcony of the Stan
ford Union court tonight at 8:30
o'clock. This is a regular Tuesday
program, and the first of a series of
summer concerts. There will be no
charge.
Soft colored lights, a summer sky,
and the arches and balconies of the
court make a perfect setting for a
Spanish program. The senorita is ac
customed to creating the illusion of
Spain in the conventional auditorium
with a simple curtain as a back wall,
but she has said in her cultivated
English that she would like for her
songs a patio, a garden, a brilliant
sky. Here, then, will be found such a
setting.
Costumes Add Effect
The interesting variation between
the regions of Spain is set forth by
the clever artist in folk-songs from
Castile, from Galicia, and from Valen
cia. Beautiful costumes of brilliant
color characterize each group.
