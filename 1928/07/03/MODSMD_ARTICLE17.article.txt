# VICTORY LOOMS FOR CARDS IN EASTERN TRIP
## Spencer to Run 400 Meter Race; West May Enter Low Hurdle Event Templeton Believes Seven Stanford Stars Sure Of Olympic Trip 
### 
With a field of stars headed by Bud
Spencer, Stanford captain, the 400-
meter race will feature the first two
days of the National Championships
and Olympic track and field tryouts
to be held at Philadelphia today and
tomorrow. Spencer will attempt to
prove to members of the American
Olympic Games Committee, as well
as the country at large, that it was
through no fluke that he broke the
record in that event here a few
months ago.
Heats and finals for the 400-meter
hurdles race will also take place dur
ing the first two days. Clarence West,
one of Spencer's teammates, and an
other member of the famous Card
track team may run in this event.
The decision as to whether Westy
will run in this race or the 110-meter
high hurdles the latter part of the
week, or both, rests upon the opinion
of Dink Templeton. Westy has shown
up well in practice at Bowdoin Col
lege, Maine, where the team has been
training, and although he has never
run a full 400-meter hurdle race
against time, he is capable of doing
50 seconds in the quarter.
The rests of the events will take
place Friday and Saturday. All of the
eleven Cards now training in the
East are strong contenders for places
on the Olympic team, but Coach Tem
pleton picks seven of them as out
standing candidates. He figures that
one of these men may fail because of
illness, injury, or the rise of some
unknown as a star, and concludes that
he is certain of taking seven members
of his championship team to Amster
dam with him.
The seven sure shots named by
Templeton are Bob King, high jump
er; Eric Krenz, shotputter and dis
cus thrower; Harlow Rothert, shot
putter; Ward Edmonds, pole vaulter;
Kim Dyer, broad jumper; Captain Bud
Spencer, quarter-miler; and Captain
elect Ross Nichols, high hurdler.
