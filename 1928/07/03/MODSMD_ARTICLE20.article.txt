Following all too closely after the Campus Opinion which appeared in
the last issue of the Daily conies another with charges of a more serious
nature. The first reported a theft of a very petty nature, complaining
chiefly'of the annoyance of such small pilfering. The Campus Opinion
of today tells of three cases of the loss of articles of value—the theft of
spare tires from automobiles parked near Toyon.
We do not believe that students are doing their share to stop these
petty thefts, but on the other hand we think that the campus authorities
might take greater precautions in the matter.
Sudents should report every case of theft to the office of the Dean of
Men or the Comptroller, and furthermore should employ every safe
guard, such as securing their spare tires against removal and, in the case
of enclosed cars, locking them at night.
The last of the lights on the campus are turned off at 2 o'clock in the
morning and probably the majority of these thefts take place between that
hour and dawn. The added cost of burning these lights until dawn dur
ing the summer would, we believe, be justified as a step in eliminating
thievery.
It would help, too, for the night watchman to arrange his schedule of
patrolling so that he would strike the parking areas at least twice between
midnight and dawn, and vary his schedule from night to night so that he
reaches different spots at different times from night to night.
We believe that if these suggestions are followed out and students and
police co-operate, that this exasperating thievery can soon be stopped.
