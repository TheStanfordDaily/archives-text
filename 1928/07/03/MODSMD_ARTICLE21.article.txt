# The
						Glorious Fourth
## 
### 
e Tomorrow is the Fourth of July, the hundred and, fifty-second birth
day of the nation. In 1777 Congress held the first formal observance of
Independence Day, with all the officials of the year-old nation's govern
ment participating. The following year the celebration extended to in
clude all the people within the narrow boundaries of the United States.
The old records tell of military salutes at sunrise, high noon, and sunset,
parades throughout the day, banquets with oratory and all manner of
demonstrations of patriotism.
The fashion of fireworks and speech-making has faded only in recent
years. It is just as well. It would be unsuitable for us to pursue our usual
avocations on this day, but we can celebrate properly merely by remem
bering our good fortune in being a part of this still young and grow
ing nation.
