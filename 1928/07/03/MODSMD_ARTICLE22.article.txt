Judge Kavanaugh of Chicago recently presented statistics to the
Maryland State Bar Convention showing that there was one murder com
mitted in the United States every forty-four minutes last year. He
stated that the odds are seven to one that the murderer will never be ar
rested, and fifteen to one against his conviction if he is arrested. London,
with its 8,000,000 inhabitants, had twenty-seven murders last year. Chi
cago had 274.
And we in America see, know, and yet do nothing about a condition
which no other nation would tolerate. Individually we feel an impotence
to change the condition. As a mass we do nothing, although the power is
ours. Here, in the University, is where leaders should be developed who
can realize the value of mass action and appreciate its power.
