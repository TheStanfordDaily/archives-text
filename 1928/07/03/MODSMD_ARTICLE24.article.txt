# Toyon To Give Jig
## 
### 
The Summer Toyon Club will give an all-University informal dance
on Friday the Thirteenth. As the name implies this is an affair to which
all summer students are welcome, providing they purchase the necessary
ticket. The ticket sale, which has already started will be limited, so all
who wish to attend should buy tickets immediately.
