The Sidewalks of New York. By Nat
J. Ferber. (Chicago: Pascal Covici.
1928.)
"The Sidewalks of New York" is
the story of a misshapen Jew, born
under embarrassing circumstances,
who wanders through a series of un
lovely incidents —this life. It is plot
less almost as a biography is plot
less; yet, clinging fast to its simple
directness, is enough bitterness, tra
gedy, and pathetic humor to frame a
thousand stories. If there is one gleam
of beauty throughout the story it is
the passive love of Posternoch, the
central figure, for Goldie, an uncon
ventional little Jewess, born with the
same stigma. It is a story of the
Ghetto so damningly real that it casts
a feeling of repugnance which over
shadows sympathy.
Ben Hecht said that the book has
caught the soul of New York. Mr.
Hecht, of course, must either praise
or pan to excess. However, it is true
that it has caught the soul of the
East Side and held it fast to reveal its
ugliness. It has been generally con
sidered that, whatever the weakness
of the book may be, the story is a
true picture of "these charming peo
ple" of the Ghetto.
Nat Ferber as a technician is bad —

very, very bad. He handles his book
with the finesse of a plumber fitting
a joint; he batters his situations irto
place; he does amazing things with
the English language; yet, he has the
good grace to write it simply—this
simple style strengthens his realism.
"The Sidewalks of New York" is a
strong book. It is real, hard-finished,
and raw. It preaches no sermon, ren
derns no conclusion, and flaunts no
theory. Ferber has thrown it down
and said, "There it is." He is a realist
of the type which does not spare
the reader any of the nastiness —if
anything must be omitted, omit the
lovely—the sort of a person who
would describe a woman by saying
she had permanent goose-pimples on
her elbows. Ferber is not a conscious
realist; his ability is not descriptive
but photographic. This, coupled with
his unornate directness, makes for
force. It seems obvious that he
knows the subject about which he
writes.
If you care to be told "in mournful
numbers," if you are interested in
seeing life in its most futile setting,
if you want to read a bit of rude,
well-done realism —then I could
recommend this book.
—Laird Doyle.
