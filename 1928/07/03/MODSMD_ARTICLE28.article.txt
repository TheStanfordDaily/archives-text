# NOTED ART DIRECTOR BROUGHT TO STANFORD TO AID IN DRAMATICS
## Yale Graduate, Famous For Eastern Successes, in Charge Here Now 
### 
Harold Helvenston, who is engaged
at present in creating the set for
"The Queen's Husband," recently ar
rived from the East with Gordon
Davis to assume the position of Art
and Technical Director of dramatics
at Stanford. Helvenston is to be per
manently in charge of the staging de
partment of the Stanford stage.
Helvenston graduated with honors
from the famous Yale School of Dra
matics and worked under the noted
George Pierce Baker. He has gained
recognition in both amateur and pro
fessional fields; among his most noted
sets are those done for the Comedy
Club of New York and for The Uni
versity Players in their professional
presentations in Southampton summer
colony. Helvenston was the costume
and set designer for the first Chinese
contemporary play given in America,
"Pekin Politics." His set for the sec
ond production in the world of Ibsen's
"Brand" was commented upon and il
lustrated in "Arts," "The Theater,"
and other drama magazines.
Lighting Innovations
In "Eve's Complaint," which was
written and directed by Hugh Os
borne, Helvenston introduced several
innovations in the field of set crea
tion and lighting which he expects to
use in the production of "The Queen's
Husband."
The set and costumes for "The
Queen's Husband" are valued at over
fifteen hundred dollars. The framing
of the play will be the most elaborate
and unusual ever seen on a Stanford
stage. Work in plaster of paris and
papier-mache, perforated woodwork,
fringed velvet hangings, authentically
reproduced medallions, and imitation
carved woodwork have been created
for the play. The furniture is original
Louis XV, as well as the fixtures. The
whole set is in keeping with the
period.
New Sound Effects
Helvenston has planned off-stage
sounds, of which there are many in
"The Queen's Husband," by means
of many new contrivances. The light
ing has been arranged in such a way
that the spectacular setting and cos
tuming may be shown to the best ad
vantage.

Helvenston, when asked about liis
work, said, "The co-operation I have
received from my helpers as well as
others during the short while I have
been at Stanford is remarkable, and
I am looking forward to my future
work at Stanford with great anticipa
tion." When further questioned about
the set Helvenston stated that every
thing except the furniture had been
created in the workshop which has a
dyeing, casting, property, modeling,
and lighting department.

period.
New Sound Effects
Helvenston has planned off-stage
sounds, of which there are many in
"The Queen's Husband," by means
of many new contrivances. The light
ing has been arranged in such a way
that the spectacular setting and cos
tuming may be shown to the best ad
vantage.

Helvenston, when asked about liis
work, said, "The co-operation I have
received from my helpers as well as
others during the short while I have
been at Stanford is remarkable, and
I am looking forward to my future
work at Stanford with great anticipa
tion." When further questioned about
the set Helvenston stated that every
thing except the furniture had been
created in the workshop which has a
dyeing, casting, property, modeling,
and lighting department.
Harold Helvenston, who is engaged
at present in creating the set for
"The Queen's Husband," recently ar
rived from the East with Gordon
Davis to assume the position of Art
and Technical Director of dramatics
at Stanford. Helvenston is to be per
manently in charge of the staging de
partment of the Stanford stage.
Helvenston graduated with honors
from the famous Yale School of Dra
matics and worked under the noted
George Pierce Baker. He has gained
recognition in both amateur and pro
fessional fields; among his most noted
sets are those done for the Comedy
Club of New York and for The Uni
versity Players in their professional
presentations in Southampton summer
colony. Helvenston was the costume
and set designer for the first Chinese
contemporary play given in America,
"Pekin Politics." His set for the sec
ond production in the world of Ibsen's
"Brand" was commented upon and il
lustrated in "Arts," "The Theater,"
and other drama magazines.
Lighting Innovations
In "Eve's Complaint," which was
written and directed by Hugh Os
borne, Helvenston introduced several
innovations in the field of set crea
tion and lighting which he expects to
use in the production of "The Queen's
Husband."
The set and costumes for "The
Queen's Husband" are valued at over
fifteen hundred dollars. The framing
of the play will be the most elaborate
and unusual ever seen on a Stanford
stage. Work in plaster of paris and
papier-mache, perforated woodwork,
fringed velvet hangings, authentically
reproduced medallions, and imitation
carved woodwork have been created
for the play. The furniture is original
Louis XV, as well as the fixtures. The
whole set is in keeping with the
period.
