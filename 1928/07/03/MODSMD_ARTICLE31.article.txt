The Editor, Sir:
Three students who habitually park
their cars in the enclosure south of (
Toyon Hall, reported today that !
spare tires had been stolen from thern |
on Saturday night. I was one of them, !
and when I reported the theft to the |

j Palo Alto police sergeant, he said
that there has been a number of com--
plaints of thievery coming from the
' University.
Since, however, it is the duty of
the Campus Cop, rather than of the
Palo Alto police, to prosecute thieves
who work on the campus, I appeal
ito the Daily to see that action is
taken in the interest of stopping these
immoral orgies of tire-stealing.
Sincerely, Templeton Peck.
A plan to rejuvenate the wrinkled
I face of prunes has been discovered.
