# SECOND SYMPHONY PLEASES AUDIENCE
## Coates Given Ovation As He Concludes Final Pacific Coast Engagement 
### Horace Bristol 
Piquant in program, interpreted
with delicacy and verve, the Sunday
afternoon symphony concert at Hills
borough, under the direction of Al
bert Coates, was picturesquely vola
tile.
His selections were refreshing with
a spirit of vernal newness. Ranging
from moments of light caprice to
such serious depths as in the Scria
bine "Le Poeme De 'Extase," Coates'
program was unusual. It was intri
guing; intellectually satisfying.
One Familiar Number
Out of the crowded afternoon's pro
gram, only one number, Mozart's
"The Marriage of Figaro" overture
was generally familiar. It was the
first local performance of the Ilossini-
Resphigi ballet, "La Boutique Fan
tasque"; Scriabine's "Le Poeme de
L'Extase"; "The Love of Three Or
anges," by Prokofieff; an orchestral
arrangement of the "Song of the Vol
ga Boatmen," by Glazounow, and the
Elgar "Enigma" variations.
Programatically, the concert was
fascinating. Beneath the whimsy, the
light fantasy of the compositions is a
very definite and philosophical inter
pretation. Especially in the Scriabine
work, and in episodes of the "Enig
ma" variations the composer has at
tempted to express something of the
emotional (and therefore musically
communicable) side of his philosophy
of life.
Enthusiastic Applause
Outstanding in a group of outstand
ing orchestral readings, Coates gave
the Hillsborough audience all the
original power of ecstasy and feeling
that marks "Le Poeme de L'Extase."
Following him through the tense emo
tional development of the poem, the
audience was enthusiastic in their
applause at the conclusion of the se
lection, as well as the prolonged
demonstration given the director at
the close of his concert, which was
his last appearance in the bay region
this year.
Henri Pontbriand, singing two num
bers, "Questa Quella," from Rigoletto,
and the flower song from "Carmen"
was well received. Mr. Pontbriand is
soloist with Albert Coates.
Bernardino Molinari will direct the
San Francisco Symphony at the Wood
land theatre at the Sunday concert
next week.

tempted to express something of the
emotional (and therefore musically
communicable) side of his philosophy
of life.
Enthusiastic Applause
Outstanding in a group of outstand
ing orchestral readings, Coates gave
the Hillsborough audience all the
original power of ecstasy and feeling
that marks "Le Poeme de L'Extase."
Following him through the tense emo
tional development of the poem, the
audience was enthusiastic in their
applause at the conclusion of the se
lection, as well as the prolonged
demonstration given the director at
the close of his concert, which was
his last appearance in the bay region
this year.
Henri Pontbriand, singing two num
bers, "Questa Quella," from Rigoletto,
and the flower song from "Carmen"
was well received. Mr. Pontbriand is
soloist with Albert Coates.
Bernardino Molinari will direct the
San Francisco Symphony at the Wood

Piquant in program, interpreted
with delicacy and verve, the Sunday
afternoon symphony concert at Hills
borough, under the direction of Al
bert Coates, was picturesquely vola
tile.
His selections were refreshing with
a spirit of vernal newness. Ranging
from moments of light caprice to
such serious depths as in the Scria
bine "Le Poeme De 'Extase," Coates'
program was unusual. It was intri
guing; intellectually satisfying.
One Familiar Number
Out of the crowded afternoon's pro
gram, only one number, Mozart's
"The Marriage of Figaro" overture
was generally familiar. It was the
first local performance of the Ilossini-
Resphigi ballet, "La Boutique Fan
tasque"; Scriabine's "Le Poeme de
L'Extase"; "The Love of Three Or
anges," by Prokofieff; an orchestral
arrangement of the "Song of the Vol
ga Boatmen," by Glazounow, and the
Elgar "Enigma" variations.
Programatically, the concert was
fascinating. Beneath the whimsy, the
light fantasy of the compositions is a
very definite and philosophical inter
pretation. Especially in the Scriabine
work, and in episodes of the "Enig
ma" variations the composer has at
tempted to express something of the
emotional (and therefore musically
communicable) side of his philosophy
of life.
