# REV. CARL S. PATTON GIVES SUNDAY SERMON ON 'HOMELY VIRTUES'
## Chicago Clergyman Stresses Faithfulness, Sympathy, Economy, Patience 
### 
"The Homely Virtues" was the sub
ject of the address given by the
Rev. Carl S. Patton, D.D., of Chicago,
in the Memorial Church Sunday. Dr.
Patton mentioned four homely vir
tues: economy, patience, faithfulness,
and sympathy.
"The whole round world rests on
the shoulders of the people who prac
tice these virtues," said Dr. Patton.
"They are not virtues of the spark
ling variety like optimism and pa
triotism, but the little everyday vir
tues, seemingly unimportant.
"The first and homeliest virtue I
can think of is economy . . . economy
as distinguished from meanness and
stinginess . . . the kind that makes
for stability. Extravagance is a kind
of senseless selfishness; it's spending
on yourself more than you're worth."
When speaking of patience, the
second homely virtue, Dr. Patton
said: |
"It's not so much the style now that
we have automobiles and can get
Chicago on the radio, but with the
wise it will never go out of date. Job
got a world-wide reputation that last
ed 3000 years on that quality alone.
"The third homely virtue is faith
fulness, not faithfulness to some high
and lofty ideal, but to the hundred

and one demands of everyday life. It
is this kind of faithfulness that makes
the world go round.
"One other virtue is sympathy, not
the handkerchief kind, but feeling
with people and seeing with them . . .
a virtue homely in the sense that it
makes a man feel at home in the
world. As we practice these homely
virtues," he said, "they gradually be
come beautiful to us, and we are able
to derive a satisfaction from them for
their own sake."
