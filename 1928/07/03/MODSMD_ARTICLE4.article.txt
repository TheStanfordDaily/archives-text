# MANAGERSHIP OF THE OLYMPIC TRACK TEAM DECLINED BY MALONEY
## Business on Campus Makes Acceptance Impossible, Mentor Declares 
### 
Harry Maloney, Associate Director
of Encina Gymnasium and President
of the Pacific Athletic Association of
the A.A.U., who was recently offered
a position as Assistant Manager of
the track team which will represent
the United States in the Olympic
Games at Amsterdam, received a sec
ond telegram yesterday morning urg
ing him to accept the position.
Maloney has declined both the
fers, saying that if the offer had been
received at an earlier date when the
proper arrangements could have been
made so that it would not have been
ncessary that he remain at the gym
this quarter, he would have been de
lighted to accept.
Maloney has had extensive ex
perience with United States teams in
Europe. In 1919 he was track coach
and trainer of the U.S. Track Team
in the Inter-Allied Games at Paris,
France, and in 1920 he was trainer
and rugby commissioner of the rugby
teams in the Olympic Games at Ant
werp, Belgium.
