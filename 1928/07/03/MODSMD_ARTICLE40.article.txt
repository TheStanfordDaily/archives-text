# WARREN D. ALLEN TO STRESS INDEPENDENCE DAY IN ORGAN RECITAL
## Selections by MacDowell, Gillette, Elgar, Will Be on Program 
### 
In commemoration of the Fourth
of July, Warren D. Allen, University
organist, will present the following
program in the Memorial Church at
4:15 o'clock this afternoon. Of spe
cial interest is the opening number,
"Suite from the Royal Fireworks
Music," by Handel, as Mr. Allen has
transcribed it from the orchestral ar
rangement for this occasion. No pro
gram typifying American sentiment
would be complete without composi
tions by Edward MacDowell. His
"A.D. 1620," from the "Sea Pieces"
and his "Told at Sunset" from the
"Woodland Sketches" will be played.
A present-day composer, Jas. R. Gil
lette, who is at Carleton College in
Minnesota, furnishes the next num
ber, "From the South." This interest
ing composition is based upon the
song of a negro carpenter which the
composer heard while in Georgia. The
recital closes with that favorite
march, "With Pomp and Circum
stance," by Elgar.
Thursday's recital at the same
hour will open with Sigfrid Karg-
Elert's "Sunset," followed by "Star
light" by the same composer. Two
toccatas by French composers are on
the program: one is taken from the
"Oedipus in Thebes" written by Le
Froid de Mereaux, and the other is
written by Augustin Barie, a gifted
modern French writer for the organ.
Bach's "Prelude and Fugue in A Ma
jor," and "Sapphic Ode," by Johannes
Brahms, are also to be heard.
FIREMEN EXPLAIN TACTICS
Demonstrating the tactics of the
well-trained fireman, a squad of smoke
eaters from the Chicago fire depart
ment made the first actual use of the
newly dedicated $10,000 training
tower recently as the feature of the
day's performance at the firemen's
short course at the University of Il
linois.
