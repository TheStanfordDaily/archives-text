# Thursday Is Last Day to Make Study List Changes
## 
### 
The Registrar's office sends out a
final warning that Thursday, the day
after the Fourth, is the final date for
making any changes in study lists
without fine. Full courses for the
whole quarter must be filed at this
time, and any alterations after Thurs
day will incure a fine.- Some students
have entered their courses for the
first half only, although they have
registered in the University for the
whole term.
