# "THE QUEEN'S HUSBAND" TO BE PRESENTED FRIDAY NIGHT
## Sherwood Satire Promises to Be Finished Work; Sets Are Clever 
### Laird Doyle 
The rehearsals for "The Queen's
Husband's" first production on any
amateur American stage indicate that
the presentation on Friday night will
be a most finished work. Robert Sher
wood's artful satire will be treated
to bring out all its cleverness.
Helvenston's set will be one of
the finest and most unusual ever
built on a Stanford stage; also,
the auditory off-stage effects should
be the most realistic introduced in
any amateur production. The mem
bers of the cast have been taking an
intense interest in the show and this,
coupled with the exceptional talent
available, should go to make the pro
duction a remarkable one.
Phipps, the footman and crony of
King Eric VIII, is played by Leaven
worth Colby who furnishes dry and
amusing humor from a height of six
feet five. Gordon Davis, portraying
King Eric, characterizes a mild-man
nered ruler who is sure that he is a
good king because he is never late
to functions and always wears the
correct clothing. Betty Wilbur creates
a most difficult character in portray
ing a beautiful and regal queen as
well as a nagging and dogmatic wife.
Her presentation promises to be one
of the high lights of the show. Prince
William of Greece, Irvin Rosenblatt,
is a rounder of the royalty whose
morals are questionable and whose
attitudes and piquant opinions about
matters lends a charming and amus
ing tone to the most serious of mat
ters.
"The Queen's Husband" is a humor
ously daring satire, a take-off on the
rule of modern monarchs. It is a
sophisticated play of the lighter type
and has the outstanding prerequisite
of having a line arrangement to sus
tain the interest throughout. The sub
ject of this satire is of such general
and current interest that a wide ap
peal and universal appreciation is
insured.
The movement of the play is rapid,
for diplomacy, love, revolutions, and
bombardments, can not exist without
action. The small kingdom is "charged
with liberalists, radicals, anarchists,
dissipated princes, and charming la
dies; such combinations give promise
of explosive developments and inter
esting character portrayal.

amateur American stage indicate that
the presentation on Friday night will
be a most finished work. Robert Sher
wood's artful satire will be treated
to bring out all its cleverness.
Helvenston's set will be one of
the finest and most unusual ever
built on a Stanford stage; also,
the auditory off-stage effects should
be the most realistic introduced in
any amateur production. The mem
bers of the cast have been taking an
intense interest in the show and this,
coupled with the exceptional talent
available, should go to make the pro
duction a remarkable one.
Phipps, the footman and crony of
King Eric VIII, is played by Leaven
worth Colby who furnishes dry and
amusing humor from a height of six
feet five. Gordon Davis, portraying
King Eric, characterizes a mild-man
nered ruler who is sure that he is a
good king because he is never late
to functions and always wears the
correct clothing. Betty Wilbur creates
a most difficult character in portray
ing a beautiful and regal queen as
well as a nagging and dogmatic wife.
Her presentation promises to be one
of the high lights of the show. Prince
William of Greece, Irvin Rosenblatt,
is a rounder of the royalty whose
morals are questionable and whose
attitudes and piquant opinions about
matters lends a charming and amus
ing tone to the most serious of mat
ters.
"The Queen's Husband" is a humor
ously daring satire, a take-off on the
rule of modern monarchs. It is a
sophisticated play of the lighter type
and has the outstanding prerequisite
of having a line arrangement to sus
tain the interest throughout. The sub
ject of this satire is of such general
and current interest that a wide ap
peal and universal appreciation is
insured.
The movement of the play is rapid,
for diplomacy, love, revolutions, and
bombardments, can not exist without
action. The small kingdom is "charged
with liberalists, radicals, anarchists,
dissipated princes, and charming la
dies; such combinations give promise
of explosive developments and inter
esting character portrayal.
