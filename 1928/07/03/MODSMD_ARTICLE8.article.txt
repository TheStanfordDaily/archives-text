# REGISTRAR STRESSES CREDIT LIMITATIONS
## 
### 
From the enrollment cards of some
Summer Quarter students the Regis
trar's office suspects that they do not
know that there is a limit on the
number of hours for which credit will
be granted to undergraduates. The
Registrar calls attention to the fact
that the normal maximum of hours
for credit for undergraduates is 18
for the whole quarter and 9 for the
first half. The minimum is 13 for the
quarter and 7 for the first half.
All new Lower Division students
and all undergraduates who failed in
a course last quarter, received a con
dition or withdrew from a course
without permission are limited to a
maximum of 16 units for the whole
quarter and 8 for the half, the mini
mum requirements being the same as
for other undergraduates.
There is no maximum limit for
graduate students, but they may take
no less than 8 hours for the full quar
ter or half that amount for the half.
Students are allowed to register for
as many hours as they choose, but
credit for the work is limited to the
specified number of units unless per
mission is granted in advance.
