# GORDON DAVIS PRESENTS FIRST SUMMER PRODUCTION TONIGHT
## Betty Wilbur, Former Campus Star, Will Play Part Opposite Director Brilliant Costumes Will Add To Effectiveness of "Queen s Husband" 
### 
The last rehearsal for "The Queen's
Husband" took place last night and
from all indications tonight's perform
ance will be another big Gordon
Davis success.
Latest French gowns, selected from
the large stock of Hale Brothers, San
Francisco firm, will be worn by the
women of the cast. Probably the most
beautiful and ultra-stylish creation is
a bridal costume worn by Corinne
Franklin as Princess Anne.
Clever Satire
"The Queen's Husband" is a clever
but not a bitter satire on modern mon
archies, however, within the play
there is an ironical situation concern
ing the idea of royal marriages. Prin
cess Anne is almost forced by her
mother, Queen Martha, into a loveless
marriage for the sake of diplomacy;
this was the same condition under
which the Queen was married and she
is extremely resentful because of it,
but nevertheless insists that her
daughter go through the same ordeal.
The play is filled with interesting
character parts and the most out
standing of these are King Eric VIII
and Queen Martha. Gordon Davis
plays the part of a dry, old king who
manages his kingdom despite hisgjvvife.
Betty Wilbur as Queen Martha plays
a consistent yet unlovable role. Her
constantly recurring question: "Ma
jesty, where have you been?" becomes :

an argument against royal marriages.
The interpretation of these two parts
is the foundation of the play, and if
tonight's performance goes as is ex
pected, it will have a most solid
foundation.
Has Strong Characters
A successful production of "The
Queen's Husband" does not depend
entirely on the brilliant lines; char
acter portrayal is its main strength.
Leavenworth Colby, who plays Phipps,
the quince-faced, lengthy footman,
gives promise of creating an amusing
character in the play, for it carries
not only the humor, but also the seri
ous theme of the story. Dick Stewart
is cast as Granton, the unexpectedly
successful lover, and he and Corinne
Franklin furnish the love Interest op
posed by the unspeakable Prince
William of Greek, Irving Rosenblatt.
Has New Lighting
Harold Helvenston announced to
day for the first time that he would
introduce the use of contrapuntal
lighting. This form of lighting con
sists of throwing warm and cold
lights from opposite sides of the
stage; the advantage of this type of
lighting is that a character on the
stage has two distinct light vibrations
playing upon him to give different
types of shadow and to allow a great
er amount of facial mobility. Helven

foundation.
Has Strong Characters
A successful production of "The
Queen's Husband" does not depend
entirely on the brilliant lines; char
acter portrayal is its main strength.
Leavenworth Colby, who plays Phipps,
the quince-faced, lengthy footman,
gives promise of creating an amusing
character in the play, for it carries
not only the humor, but also the seri
ous theme of the story. Dick Stewart
is cast as Granton, the unexpectedly
successful lover, and he and Corinne
Franklin furnish the love Interest op
posed by the unspeakable Prince
William of Greek, Irving Rosenblatt.
Has New Lighting
Harold Helvenston announced to
day for the first time that he would
introduce the use of contrapuntal
lighting. This form of lighting con
sists of throwing warm and cold
lights from opposite sides of the
stage; the advantage of this type of
lighting is that a character on the
stage has two distinct light vibrations
playing upon him to give different
types of shadow and to allow a great
er amount of facial mobility. Helven
ston also stated that he has developed
The last rehearsal for "The Queen's
Husband" took place last night and
from all indications tonight's perform
ance will be another big Gordon
Davis success.
Latest French gowns, selected from
the large stock of Hale Brothers, San
Francisco firm, will be worn by the
women of the cast. Probably the most
beautiful and ultra-stylish creation is
a bridal costume worn by Corinne
Franklin as Princess Anne.
Clever Satire
"The Queen's Husband" is a clever
but not a bitter satire on modern mon
archies, however, within the play
there is an ironical situation concern
ing the idea of royal marriages. Prin
cess Anne is almost forced by her
mother, Queen Martha, into a loveless
marriage for the sake of diplomacy;
this was the same condition under
which the Queen was married and she
is extremely resentful because of it,
but nevertheless insists that her
daughter go through the same ordeal.
The play is filled with interesting
character parts and the most out
standing of these are King Eric VIII
and Queen Martha. Gordon Davis
plays the part of a dry, old king who
manages his kingdom despite hisgjvvife.
Betty Wilbur as Queen Martha plays
a consistent yet unlovable role. Her
constantly recurring question: "Ma
jesty, where have you been?" becomes :

an argument against royal marriages.
The interpretation of these two parts
is the foundation of the play, and if
tonight's performance goes as is ex
pected, it will have a most solid
foundation.
