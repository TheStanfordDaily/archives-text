# TOYON DANCE BIDS MAYBE OBTAINED AT A.S.S.U. OFFICE
## 
### 
Tickets for the Toyon all-University
summer dance are now being sold in
the A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union.
Students are reminded by the Toyon
dance committee that this dance is
open to all students, regardless of
whether or not they live in Toyon
Hall. Bids will be sold for $2.00.

July 13 falls on Friday about once
every six years but every effort is
being made to make this Toyon
dance the kind of affair that comes
only once in a life-time. The Friday
jinx idea will be carried out as far
as possible.

Music for the dance will be fur
nished by George Tackabury's orches
tra. This is the same orchestra that
played for the Roble jolly-up, but will
have two more pieces next Friday
night.
The Toyon Club dance last sum
mer was declared the oustanding
social event of the quarter. Bob
Fraser, Toyon Club manager, says
that no effort will be spared to make
this year's dance an equally great
success.
