## 
### 
The third of the series of concerts
in the Woodland Theatre at Hills
borough will be given Sunday after
noon at 3 o'clock, with Bernardino
Molinari, the eminent Italian conduc
tor, making his Pacific Coast debut,
directing the personnel of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
Mr. Molinari arrived last Monday
morning, coming directly from Rome,
and has been rehearsing his first pro
gram with the orchestra every day
during the past; week.
Conducts in Rome
As conductor of the famous orches
tra of the Augusteo of Rome, Molinari
is known in all the musical centers
of Europe. His first American appear
ances were made only last winter
when he was guest conductor of the
St. Louis Symphony Orchestra for
five weeks and in January directed
the New York Philharmonic Orches
tra for a week of concerts, llis in
stant success last season prompted


Bernardino Molinari, of Rome, who;.
I '
will lead the San Francisco Symphony ,
Orchestra in its third concert in the
Wood'and Theatre Sunday. 1
the managements of the Woodland
Theatre, the San Francisco Summer
Symphony series, the Hollywood
Bowl, and the New York Stadium to
secure Molinari for the summer con-

certs and consequently at the end of
his season in Rome he left almost
immediately for California.
Able Symphony Director
Molinari did much during his brief
stay in this country last season to
dispel an impression of long stand
ing that Italians were interested only
in opera. His illustrious compatriot,
Toscanini, has done much to disabuse
the musical world of the belief that
Italian conductors are to be reckoned
with only when directing an orches
tra in the pit and facing a battalion
of singers interpreting the melodies
of Verdi, Puccini, Rossini, and the
rest, and Molinari has also most ably
demonstrated that he is equally at
home interpreting symphonic music.
Not only is Molinari a. conductor
of distinction but he also has many
compositions to his credit, several of
which will be included in the pro
grams he will conduct in the Wood
land Theatre.
The complete program for Sunday
is as follows:
Suite for Strings and Orchestra
Corelli
Symphony No. 5 in C Minor
Beethoven
Tone poem—Death and Trans
figuration Strauss
Overture —William Tell Rossini
a synthetic white light which is to
be used in the staging of "The

Ed Smith, Dramatic Manager, an

seats obtainable at his office in the
Old Union and at Crandall's. The box
