# CIVILIZATIONS OF OLD MEXICO, TEXT OF FIRST TALK BY VASCONCELOS
## Prophesies Great Advance For Central, South America In Near Future 
### 
Mexico, a country of hope—a coun
try of the past —a country of the fu
ture —so the story of the changing
civilizations of Mexico, was told by
Dr. Jos6 Vasconcelos to an interested
audience in the Little Theatre yes
terday afternoon. This is the first of a
series to be delivered in English dur
ing Vasconcelos' stay at Stanford.
Mexico seems to have been the cen
ter of several waves of culture en
tirely apart from each other, leaving
no lesson for the succeeding civiliza
tion, so distinct are they from each
other as to be termed lost civiliza
tions. In this it has been unlike Euro
pean culture that has formed a con
tinuous chain.
Concerning the present civilization
in Mexico today—that of the Spanish,
Dr. Vasconcelos traced its difficulties
with the nature of the country, the
mountains, and the tropics. By dint
of great labor the mountains have
been conquered, and made to yield up
their toll of precious metal that has
supplied the marts of European trade
for two hundred years. The people
have been educated and taught the
lessons of industry and agriculture.
The one insurmountable difficulty
heretofore has been the tropics with
its miasma, malaria, and fevers. Sci
ence is now solving these difficulties
and soon the coast will be made the
most productive and healthful spot
on earth.
Dr. Vasconcelos prophecies that the
near future will see great develop
ments, especially in Brazil and the
Amazon valley, due to drainage and
the natural productivity of the region.
