# ALLEN TO GIVE ORGAN RECITAL SUNDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Sunday evening at 7:30 o'clock in
the Memorial Church Warren D. Al
len, University organist, will repeat
the recital that he played Thursday
afternoon. Two of the numbers on
the program, "Sunset" and "Star
light," are by Sigfrid Karg-Elert, the
most important figure in modern Ger
man organ music. His compositions
show the inspiration of Bach, Brahms,
and Reger. The "Toccata in B Minor,"
by Augustin Bari6, is a brilliant num
ber by one of the most gifted modern
French writers for the organ. This

composition is a combination of the
Bach style with harmony suggestive
of Debussy and his school.

Bach, himself, is represented on the
program by his "Prelude and Fugue
in A Major." The Toccata from "Oedi
pus in Thebes," and the "Sapphic
Ode," by Johannes Brahms, are also
included in the group of numbers to
be played.
