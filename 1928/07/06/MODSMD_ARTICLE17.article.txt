# CAPTAIN BUD SPENCER TAKES PLACE ON U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM
## 400 Meter Star First Man On Card Track Squad To Cinch Berth Other Members to Display Ability at Cambridge Today, Tomorrow 
### 
Although handicapped by an illness
Wednesday morning, which threatened to
keep him from entering the meet at
Philadelphia that afternoon, Bud Spen
cer, Card captain, placed fifth in the Na
tional Championship 400 meter race. A
little earlier in the afternoon Spencer had
cinched a place on the U. S. Olympic
team placing third in one of two heats
run as Olympic tryouts in the 400 meter
dash. In placing third he qualified as one
of the four men who will represent
America in the 1600 meter relay at the
Games in Amsterdam.

So far Spencer is the only member of
the Stanford to exhibit his wares, and
the first of the seven whom Coach Dink
Templeton predicts as "sureshots" for the
Dutch treat.

j Today and tomorrow will see the bal
j ance of the team in action at Cambridge,
| Massachusetts. Among the array of Card
| stars expected to come through are Bob

King, high jumper, who won the
I.C.A.A.A.A. championships in 1916 and
1928 and tied for second place in 1927.
King was also winner of this year's
N.C.A.A. championship, and holds the
I.C.A.A.A.A. record. This season, King
has been consistently above six feet five
inches, and has set up a best mark of six
feet six and five eighths inches.

Eric Krenz should show to better ad
vantage in the discus 'throw than in the
shot put. His throws consistently better
150 feet, and Bud Houser, former U.S.C.
star, is the closest rival of the Stanford
hurler, who holds the I.C.A.A.A.A. and
N.C.A.A. discus records after his first
season of varsity competition. Krenz also
I is a probability in the shot put, although
jit is doubtful whether he will equal his
I.C.A.A.A.A. record mark of fifty feet
I one inch in the Olympic tryouts at Cam
| bridge. Harlow Rothert should be close
to fifty feet in the Olympic tryouts, and
should have little trouble in qualifying as
one of the American shotputters. Roth
ert's work has been sensational since he
I got into competition late in the dual meet
I season, and he now holds the N.C.A.A.
I championship and a well-earned second
(place in the I.C.A.A.A.A. shot put.
Ward Edmonds is back in his best
form again after a brief lapse in the !
I.C.A.A.A.A. meet and in the New York
Athletic Club meet the following week, j
He is one of the three outstanding vault- j
ers in the country, and at any time may j
produce the slight improvement neces- !
sary to place him ahead of Carr of Yale j
and Barnes of U.S.C. Ward holds the |
| N.C.A.A. record at thirteen feet six and '
five-eighths inches.
Kim Dyer's broad jumping has been
'consistently good all season. In his last j
six meets he has bettered twenty-four !
feet in each competition, and has made
this record for consistency in the face of
adverse conditions of all sorts.
Ross Nichols is one of the two or three
| ranking high hurdlers in the country,
i Unless he falls over a barrier, he should
j be out in front at the finish.
Clarence West, his teammate, will also
I enter this event. He was kept out of the

1400 meter hurdles because Coach Tem
pleton believes that he has at last found
himself in this race.
Leo Kibby and Bill Sparling, javelin
throwers, are capable of throws which
will qualify them. However, the field in
1 this event appears to be the strongest of
the meet and competition will be unusu
ally keen if the entrants equal their best
marks of the season. Kibby, who has
been handicapped by illness, is now able
to work again, and should be in shape for
the trials.
A1 Forster has possibilities o fequal
ing the performances of his team
mates in the shotput, but it is a
matter of circumstance whether he
has his good day at the trials.
