# Entertainment of Value
## 
### 
Many summer students will have their first opportunity tonight to
witness a production upon the Stanford stage. "The Queen's Husband"
is a particularly ambitious effort for an amateur group; yet in the opinion
of those who have been present at dress rehearsals, this performance will
he of a calibre equal to, if not higher than, that of previous Campus
dramatizations.
Stanford dramatics are well known throughout the country, and
especially on the Pacific Coast, where they are regarded highly by critics.
But more important than this achievement, and more important than
resultant prestige for the University, is the proven educational value of
the Stanford stage.

From this stage, fortified by practical experience during their under
graduate days, numerous former students have graduated to professional
success. Two of these, Gordon Davis and Elizabeth Wilbur, will take
part in "The Queen's Husband" tonight. Another is Lester Vail, who
has won honors on the legitimate stage in the East. Lloyd Nolan has just
been playing in the cast of "The Queen's Husband" in Hollywood.
Delmar Daves, recently graduated, has chosen the motion pictures. He
has advanced rapidly under James Cruze.

The postgraduate histories of these and many other former students
serve to demonstrate that in addition to furnishing entertainment, Stan
ford dramatics occupy a definite and important place in the educational
life of the University.
