# The 						Flying Field
## 
### 
Some residents of the district of Palo Alto across the highway from
the field of the flying school on the Campus have petitioned to the city
council to take action against it on the grounds that it is dangerous to
residents of the city and a nuisance through the noise and dust it pro
duces. Other residents of Palo Alto are opposing this petition and urging
that no adverse action be taken.

While everybody will sympathize with those who feel that they are
inconvenienced in any way by the proximity of the flying field to their
residences, it seems that the menaces have been exaggerated. As for the
danger from the flights of the Palo Alto ships certainly there is exag
geration. The planes and their fliers are both guaranteed by the most
thorough tests. There is already an ordinance against flying over the city
at low elevations, which is the chief cause of danger to those underneath.
Airplanes do certainly make some noise, but unless we are going to bar
them altogether from ou>- neighborhood we shall have to endure this—
and to most people that is not too difficult. The dust from the runway
has been a genuine nuisance, but it is one that is readily remedied, and
the remedy is promised quickly here.
