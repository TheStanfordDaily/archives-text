# The 						Olympic Finals
## 
### 
Today and tomorrow the Stanford men who are candidates to repre
sent the United States in the Olympic games at Amsterdam in August
undergo their final tests, and we here still have the same confidence in
their ability that we have held all along. The records that successful
aspirants must match this year are higher than they ever were before,
but the Stanford group can match the best. "Bud" Spencer, who we
continue to believe firmly is the best quarter-miler in the country, will
go to Amsterdam even though, a sick man, he could not place in a quarter
mile that was won in far slower time than he can do without trying
when he is himself. He goes with the American team as a relay runner,'
and will show on the other side of the ocean that he ranks with the best
in the world. Our other men will prove their mettle this week-end.
Here's to them!

And here, too, is to Marion Holley, a Stanford girl who will be among
the American women competing in the Olympic games.
And since Stanford has no crew to offer in competition, here's to the
University of California varsity eight and our most ardent hopes that it
wins the right today to represent the country on the water.
