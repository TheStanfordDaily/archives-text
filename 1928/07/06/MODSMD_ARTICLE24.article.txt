# That All May Know

Four speeders were fined at the last meeting of the Men's Council.
It is possible that a few of this nunj(ber did not know that they were
breaking the law, as the chairman of the council said that all of the
transgressors met their doom on Palm Drive.
Although Palm Drive looks like an invitation to use a few extra
horsepower, such antics are likely to prove disastrous. The speed limit
is forty miles an hour, except at intersections, where it is fifteen. Unfor
tunately these intersections are inconveniently located, and it is rather
impossible to travel the legitimate forty miles an hour on any part except
the last few hundred yards.
