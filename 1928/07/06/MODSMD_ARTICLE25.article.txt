"Home to Harlem," by Claude McKay.
Harpers (1928).
"Home to Harlem" is a negro story
written by a negro about negroes. It
is a tale of Harlem life and the black
race as a member of that race sees
it. Dramatic tragedy, vulgar comedy,
jazz music, cheap rooming-houses,
gin, razors, saloons, cabarets, love,
and disease: compile these and you
have the foundation of "Home to Har
lem." From this one might imagine
that it is a real, sordid, smelly story
preaching the usual trite sermon on
the negro problem. It isn't. It is a
phantasy of pathos; it is a story as
intangible as the laugh of the black
man and as bizarre as the mysterious
country from whence he came. Mc-
Kay makes a beautiful statue of gut
ter mud, perfect in form, but of filthy
material.
A negro meets a woman and falls
in love with her, spends one night
with her, forgets her name and ad
dress because he is drunk, searches
for her, and after a long period of
time finds the object of his love. This
is the plot; it is a poor one and suf
fers from an anti-climax.

Had this story more finesse, it
would be a powerful novel; and had it
more finesse, it would be as the
myriad of other negro stories that
have been so prolifically produced
with the palling sameness. Hence it
is neither finished nor powerful, but
it has that something which Carl
Sandburg calls guts.

McKay pasquinades his race; he
exaggerates its libidinousness, extolls
its virtue, intricates its occultness,
and does not expound its problems.
He has painted a revealing picture
and then smeared it with the mystic
unrealness of a jungle mind. This is
why it is not sordid —moonlight on
mud.

Portions of the book are almost
written in rhythm. Lyrically beauti
ful passages are broken by the ver
nacular of Harlem. Child-like sim
plicity often holds deep attitudes, and
profound expressions are often hut
words. The book is an odd contradic
tion.

There is more gin consumed and
more seductions per page than any
book that I have ever read, excepting
of course, Dreiser's "The Genius."
Yet it is not gross—it is hazed by the
wildness of a savage mind. It is
charged with animal pathos which
carries with it a pro-human sympathy.

Claude McKay has been called the
leader of the "Negro literary renais
sance" and "Home to Harlem" is the
first book that he has produced for
the last five years. Into it he has
poured the pent-up expression of that
time.

"Home to Harlem" is an intense
book with an inadequate plot charm
ingly although often poorly written.
It is one of the most interesting
books produced this year. You may
not like it, but you will find it inter
esting. —Laird Doyle.
