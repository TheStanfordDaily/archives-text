# ROMANCE AND BEAUTY OF SPAIN PORTRAYED IN TUESDAY CONCERT
## Charm of Senorita Espinel Delights Large Group Of Music Lovers

"Vivid Song Pictures of Spain"—
How vivid they were, filled with the
romance and beauty of Spain. The
perfect calmness of the early evening,
colored lights, balconies, and dra
peries—all served to create such an
atmosphere. Into this perfect back
ground came a descendant of old
Spain, a girl in an Asturian peasant
costume. From the moment Senorita
Luisa Espinel appeared the large
audience was held spellbound. She is
not only a charming singer and
dancer —she is an actress as well. In
deed, those who had the opportunity
of attending the concert Tuesday eve
ning saw and heard a versatile artist
of rare talent. The numbers on the
program were ballads, made beauti
ful by a rich personality and sweet
simplicity.
Particularly delightful was "The
Watchman's Call" which was sung
from the balcony of the Court. How
picturesque she appeared and how
gratifying it was to hear her sing
another song from the balcony. Typi
cal of her naiveness was the state
ment —"I like so well to sing here
that I shall sing another." By that
childlike statement she won the
hearts of all. Clear, appealing, and
sweet, her voice rang out on the still
air.
The songs were all sung in Spanish
with a finish and fineness of feeling
that made a deep impression on all
who had come to hear. Each selection
was first interpreted in English by
the artist.
The audience was first transported
to Spain, taken not to the glamour
of courtly splendor, but to the scenes
of peasant life. Then skillfully
brought back to the romantic days
of early California through the "Ro
mance de Elena" and the humor of
"Un Pajarito."
