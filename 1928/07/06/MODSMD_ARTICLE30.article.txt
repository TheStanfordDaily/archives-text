# BETTY WILBUR REFUSES PROFESSIONAL PART TO WORK HERE WITH DAVIS
## Says Training at Stanford Equal to Experience in City Productions 
### 
Miss Elizabeth Wilbur, feminine
lead in "The Queen's Husband," let
it be known today that she refused
a professional engagement to again
play on a Stanford stage. Miss Wilbur
said, " 'The Queen's Husband' is a
most amusing play and I am enjoying
my part in it immensely; 1 could not
resist turning down a professional
part to work on the campus again
under Gordon Davis in such a play."
Miss Wilbur left Stanford in 1927
to take a part in "Daddy Goes A
Hunting" in which she played sub
lead to Marjorie Rambeau; this was
the first of a long series of produc
tions in which she played with the
famous actress. The most outstanding
of her presentations have been in
"Declasse," "Just Life," and "The
Vortex." Her work with Ruth Renick
in the popular play, "The Last of
Mrs. Cheney," gained her many flat
tering comments from the critics.

Miss Wilbur, while discussing Stan
ford dramatics, said, "I think that the
best answer to a question about the
quality of Stanford dramatics would
be to cite the numerous people who
have left the campus stage to enter
the professional fields." She also com
mented upon the good fortune of Stan
ford to have the services of Gordon
Davis, and remarked that in profes
sional dramatics training under him
is considered to be on the same level
as professional experience.
George C. Warren, the most noted
dramatic critic of the Pacific Coast,
said of Miss Wilbur after seeing her
while playing-in San Francisco, "She
plays with a suavity and strength that
will carry her far in the field in which
she has chosen her career. Her
aplomb and poise is remarkable to
be found in one so young." The dra
matic world has made many state
ments predicting an advancement far
beyond her present success.
Praises Miss Rambeau
Miss Wilbur is strong in her praise
of Marjorie Rambeau and her work
as an actress. "Marjorie Rambeau is
a great actress and a wonderful wo
man. She is interested in every young
actor and often goes out of her way
to help some neophyte. I was most
fortunate to have the opportunity of
playing with her."
While at Stanford Miss Wilbur was
prominent in dramatics and played
leads in "Oedipus Rex," "Aren't We
All," "The Angel In The House," and
many other productions. Her work in
the Greek dramas first focused the
attention of producers upon Miss Wil
bur.

playing with her."
While at Stanford Miss Wilbur was
prominent in dramatics and played
leads in "Oedipus Rex," "Aren't We
All," "The Angel In The House," and
many other productions. Her work in
the Greek dramas first focused the
attention of producers upon Miss Wil
bur.
Miss Elizabeth Wilbur, feminine
lead in "The Queen's Husband," let
it be known today that she refused
a professional engagement to again
play on a Stanford stage. Miss Wilbur
said, " 'The Queen's Husband' is a
most amusing play and I am enjoying
my part in it immensely; 1 could not
resist turning down a professional
part to work on the campus again
under Gordon Davis in such a play."
Miss Wilbur left Stanford in 1927
to take a part in "Daddy Goes A
Hunting" in which she played sub
lead to Marjorie Rambeau; this was
the first of a long series of produc
tions in which she played with the
famous actress. The most outstanding
of her presentations have been in
"Declasse," "Just Life," and "The
Vortex." Her work with Ruth Renick
in the popular play, "The Last of
Mrs. Cheney," gained her many flat
tering comments from the critics.
Commends Davis
Miss Wilbur, while discussing Stan
ford dramatics, said, "I think that the
best answer to a question about the
quality of Stanford dramatics would
be to cite the numerous people who
have left the campus stage to enter
the professional fields." She also com
mented upon the good fortune of Stan
ford to have the services of Gordon
Davis, and remarked that in profes
sional dramatics training under him
is considered to be on the same level
as professional experience.
George C. Warren, the most noted
dramatic critic of the Pacific Coast,
said of Miss Wilbur after seeing her
while playing-in San Francisco, "She
plays with a suavity and strength that
will carry her far in the field in which
she has chosen her career. Her
aplomb and poise is remarkable to
be found in one so young." The dra
matic world has made many state
ments predicting an advancement far
beyond her present success.
Praises Miss Rambeau
Miss Wilbur is strong in her praise
of Marjorie Rambeau and her work
as an actress. "Marjorie Rambeau is
a great actress and a wonderful wo
man. She is interested in every young
actor and often goes out of her way
to help some neophyte. I was most
fortunate to have the opportunity of
playing with her."
