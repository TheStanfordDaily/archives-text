# CHARACTER, SPIRIT OF STANFORD LIKE OLD DAYS, SAYS PROFESSOR SHELDON
## University Has Not Changed From Course Laid Down At Its Founding 
### 
Stanford University today is essen
tially the same in character, spirit,
objectives, and ideals as it was in
the first years after its founding, de
clares Henry D. S lie Id on, president
of the Associated Students in 1896
and professor in the School of Edu
cation in the Summer Quarter. "The
thing that strikes an old Stanford
man returning to the University," he
says, "is the continunity of purpose
that makes Stanford the same now
as it was in its early days."
Dr. Sheldon's estimate is based not
only on his intimate knowledge of his
own university as an undergraduate
and graduate student and through
close observation since, but also on
his study of other colloges. For he
knows the colleges of other nations
and has published a book on "Student
Life and Customs in Foreign Coun
tries." He is Dean of the School of
Education at the University of Ore
gon, where he has built up an insti
tution of distinctive character.
Was Class of '96
Professor Sheldon was a classmate
of President W T ilbur at Stanford and
was associated with him in student
activities and in leadership of their
class, 1896. He won special distinction
as an intercollegiate debater.
"Stanford life is a little more for
mal than it used to be," he says, "but
that Is a natural result of its increase
in age and in size. The spirit is the
same. Stanford had a plan from the
beginning and this plan has been fol
lowed with remarkable fidelity. What
strikes a man who has visited many
university campuses is the system and
completeness of Stanford in architec
ture and arrangement of buildings.
Upholds Early Ideals
"The original ideals and purposes
of the Founders and Dr. Jordan have
been followed with the same close
ness. In the very first days Dr. Jor
dan and the faculty he selected, gave
a great impetus to science and re
search here. Ever since then, and
especially in the last decade, that im
petus has been continued and em
phasized, so that Stanford, now the
foremost institution in that direction
on the Pacific Coast, is also nationally
famous.
"There is direct continuity also in
the way that the University's student
represents all parts of the coun
try, making it a national institution
in that way. In the first student body
of about 400 there were 150 from
east of the Rockies and I note that

in the School of Education this sum
mer a considerable number come
from the East and Middle West. 0
Praises Dr. Jordan

"Dr. Jordan made Stanford. Every
one who comes into contact with bi m
is impressed with his simple and
fundamental greatness. Some may
differ from him in particular instances
of opinion, but all must come around
to agreement with his foundational
ideas."

Professor Sheldon credits President
Wilbur with following Dr. Jordan's
ideals and plans in directing Stan
ford's development since he has been
head of the University. "I don't know
any man," he says, "who has con
tinued to exhibit more unbrokenly the
same qualities and energies that he
has. Experience has made him more
valuable, but the same qualities that
made him a leader as an undergradu
ate still make him outstanding as a
man, and as a university president.
As a disciple and admirer of Dr. Jor
dan, he has devoted that energy at
Stanford to carrying on and develop
ing the work which Stanford's first
president began here."
