# BATS BATTED OFF IN ASSEMBLY HALL AT PLAY REHEARSAL
## 
### 
The Stanford stage may now take
its place with the better theatres, for
it was a haunted property room. Late
last night while a few of the techni
cal crew were still working on the
set for "The Queen's Husband," from
the depths of a basement property
room came odd noises. It might have
been the ghost of a character played
long ago and now forgotten; it might
have been a denuded play looking for
its set, or it might have been the
e*ho of missed cues; but it wasn't.
It was a small herd of bats.

A family of bats had established
themselves in the gloomy shadows of
the property room and resented the
disturbance created by the rehearsal
for the off-stage noises. In fact they
became quite peeved about these dis
concerting sounds and illustrated it
by attacking the members of the stage
crew. The bats were violently routed
and the rehearsal continued.
