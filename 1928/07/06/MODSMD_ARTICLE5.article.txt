# CARD BASEBALL SQUAD BOUND FOR AUSTRALIA; LEFT YESTERDAY NOON
## Party of 17 Makes Trip to Antipodes; To Be Gone Over Two Months 
### 
Amid the cheers of a few friends
and alumni who accompanied them
to the dock, the Card baseball squad
sailed at noon yesterday, aboard the
steamer Sierra, en route to Australia,
where they will meet the best the
Australians have to offer in the way
of baseball teams.

The seventeen members of the
party making the trip to the Anti
podes are: pitchers, Kern, Pliilippi,
Lewis, and Riese; outfielders, Wilton,
Levin, and Harder; infielders, Busch,
Laird, Maguire, and Garibaldi; catch
ers, Berg and Paxton; Manager Mur
ray Draper; Alexis Ehrman, baseball
manager for 1929, and Coach and Mrs.
Wolter.

This is one of the longest trips
taken by a college team in any sport.
Before the team returns they will
have covered over 17,000 miles. Sev
eral members of the team, Busch,
Maguire, and Garibaldi, accompanied
the '26 baseball team on their tour
of Japan. This lucky trio, during their
college career, have probably traveled
over 35,000 square miles as guests of
varsity baseball teams.

The Cards will play about fifteen
or twenty games on the trip. The
first will be played en route when the
steamer stops for a short time at
Pago-Pago, an island of the Fiji group.
The team arrives in Sydney, July 26.
For the next month they will play a
series of games with Australian
teams.
Leaving Australia August 20, the
Cards will stop in New Zealand where
they may play several games. From
New Zealand they will go to Hawaii,
and thence to San Francisco, arriving
there about September 13.
