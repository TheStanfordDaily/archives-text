# Abas Quartet To Present Program In Branner Hall
## To Be At 8 O'clock Monday Night; Group Includes Talented Artists 
### 
The Abas String Quartet will pre
sent the first of its two concerts in
Branner Hall Monday night at 8
o'clock. This is the second of a series
of concerts to be given here during
the Summer Quarter. There will be
no charge for admission. The quartet
is composed of men from the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra who
are of well-known musical ability.
Talented Personnel
Nathan Abas, first violinist and
leader of the quartet, was born in
Amsterdam, Holland, and received his
musical education there. During the
war he came to America and gave
various successful recitals in the East.
William Wolski, the second violin
ist, also has studied abroad and has
given concerts extensively through
out Europe and America.

Michel Penha, cellist, has been solo
cellist with the Philadelphia Sym
phony Orchestra for five years, and
for the last three years he has been
connected with the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra in the same ca
pacity.

Romain Varney, who plays the
viola, studied music in Paris and was
a prize pupil of the Conservatoire in
that city. He has been soloist during
the past years with the Opera Com
ique and the New York Symphony
Orchestra.
Well Mixed Program
The program which has been ar
ranged for Monday evening includes
Beethoven's "Quartet Opus No. 2,"
which is considered one of the compo
sitions which stand at the apex of
his monumental art. "Lento" from
Debussy's single string quartet is also
to be played, and its delicately lovely
music clarifies better than explana
tion the meaning of the word "im
pressionism," which has generally
been applied to Debussy's style.
"Italian Serenade," one of Hugo
Wolf's many songs, will be played,
and also Smetana's "Quartet in E
Minor."
Smetana, through will and ability,
has created a national Bohemian
school of music. He achieved his na
tionalistic purpose by involving in his
compositions traditional folk songs
and dances. His "E Minor Quartet"
is autobiographical and tells a tragic
story of difficulty, labor, and afflic
tion. His life ended in deafness and
insanity.

Debussy's single string quartet is also
to be played, and its delicately lovely
music clarifies better than explana
tion the meaning of the word "im
pressionism," which has generally
been applied to Debussy's style.
"Italian Serenade," one of Hugo
Wolf's many songs, will be played,
and also Smetana's "Quartet in E
Minor."
Smetana, through will and ability,
has created a national Bohemian
school of music. He achieved his na
tionalistic purpose by involving in his
compositions traditional folk songs
and dances. His "E Minor Quartet"
is autobiographical and tells a tragic
story of difficulty, labor, and afflic
tion. His life ended in deafness and
insanity.
The Abas String Quartet will pre
sent the first of its two concerts in
Branner Hall Monday night at 8
o'clock. This is the second of a series
of concerts to be given here during
the Summer Quarter. There will be
no charge for admission. The quartet
is composed of men from the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra who
are of well-known musical ability.
Talented Personnel
Nathan Abas, first violinist and
leader of the quartet, was born in
Amsterdam, Holland, and received his
musical education there. During the
war he came to America and gave
various successful recitals in the East.
William Wolski, the second violin
ist, also has studied abroad and has
given concerts extensively through
out Europe and America.

Michel Penha, cellist, has been solo
cellist with the Philadelphia Sym
phony Orchestra for five years, and
for the last three years he has been
connected with the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra in the same ca
pacity.

Romain Varney, who plays the
viola, studied music in Paris and was
a prize pupil of the Conservatoire in
that city. He has been soloist during
the past years with the Opera Com
ique and the New York Symphony
Orchestra.
Well Mixed Program
The program which has been ar
ranged for Monday evening includes
Beethoven's "Quartet Opus No. 2,"
which is considered one of the compo
sitions which stand at the apex of
his monumental art. "Lento" from
Debussy's single string quartet is also
to be played, and its delicately lovely
music clarifies better than explana
tion the meaning of the word "im
pressionism," which has generally
been applied to Debussy's style.
"Italian Serenade," one of Hugo
Wolf's many songs, will be played,
and also Smetana's "Quartet in E
