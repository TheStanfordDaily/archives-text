# DAVIS TO HOLD PLAY TRYOUTS ON MONDAY
## 
### 
Tryouts for the second play of
the Summer Quarter will be held
in the Assembly Hall Monday
afternoon from 2 to 4 o'clock and
Monday night from 7 to 9 o'clock.
Gordon Davis announced that he
wished a large turnout as the
play demands a large cast and
there is a good opportunity for
any student who wishes to try
out.
