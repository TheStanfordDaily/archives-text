The story of the child's six copper coins, unearthed from the debris of
ancient Carthage, is frequently quoted to emphasize the amazing
possibilities of compound interest. It has been calculated that the
coins would today amount in dollars to a sum represented by 36
followed by 59 ciphers if they had been earning compound interest
from the year 500 B.C. The figure is beyond comprehension, but it
suggests how money grows when usefully employed. Gratifying results
reward the efforts of systematic savers whose money in American
Trust Company savings accounts earns four per cent interest, com
pounded semi-annually.

The story of the child's six copper coins, unearthed from the debris of
ancient Carthage, is frequently quoted to emphasize the amazing
possibilities of compound interest. It has been calculated that the
coins would today amount in dollars to a sum represented by 36
followed by 59 ciphers if they had been earning compound interest
from the year 500 B.C. The figure is beyond comprehension, but it
suggests how money grows when usefully employed. Gratifying results
reward the efforts of systematic savers whose money in American
Trust Company savings accounts earns four per cent interest, com
pounded semi-annually.
