# DAVIS CHOOSES TEXT OF NEXT CAMPUS PLAY
## "The Chief Thing" Will Be Presented in Assembly Hall on July 27 Claimed To Be Most Bizarre Production Attempted Here at Stanford 
### 
Gordon Davis announced today that
July 27 will be the date of his next
play, which is to be "The Chief
Thing," by Nicholas Evreinoff, the
famous Russian playwright. Davis has
requested that all those interested in
trying out for the play do so either
this afternoon, or tonight from 7 until
9 o'clock at the Assembly Hall. There
will be no restrictions on the eligibil
ity of those taking part in the pro
duction, and those who have had parts
in previous places are requested to
again try out.
"The Chief Thing" is an exotic
drama; it will be the most bizarre of
any play ever presented on the cam
pus. Evreinoff has put together an odd
mixture of droll humor, fascinating
philosophy, and fantastic situations,
to create this work. It will call foT an
impressionistic setting and grotesque
•costumes.
"The Chief Thing" is a blatant story
of unusual characters found among a
group of Russian actors. It has a mul
titude of plots all connected, but only
by a very slight thread of interest.
The most interesting feature of the
play is a series of character develop
ments. It is riotous, amusing, comical,
pathetic, and ironical; it is one of
the most modern of modern plays, but
contains the charm of melodrama.
