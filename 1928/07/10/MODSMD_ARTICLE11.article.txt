# ABAS QUARTET PLEASES WITH FINE PROGRAM
## Selections From Beethoven, Debussy, Wolf Feature Evening's Concert 
### 
Four members of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra, organized as
the Abas String Quartet, gave the sec
ond of the series of summer series
programs last night at Branner Hall.
"Quartet Opus No. 2," the first piece
of chamber music, composed by
Beethoven, clearly showed the influ
ence of Mozart and Hayden. The naive
charm of the Allegro is succeeded by
an equally naive gravity in the fol
lowing movements. Lyric passages in
the violin alternate with the vigor of
the ensemble.
Debussy's "Lento from String Quar
tet," with its impression of vague
sweetness and mystery, formed a de
cided contrast to the firm structure of
the Beethoven selection; the Abas
Quartet offered a more sympathetic
interpretation of the modernist, De
bussy.
"Italian Serenade," composed by
Wolf, is free from the sentimentality
usually associated with Mediterranean
courtship. It is almost humorous in its
gayety and strongly marked rhythm.
The last number of the program,
"Quartet in E Minor," by the Bo
hemian, Smetana, is autobiographical
in character. The first movement is
marked by a fiery, restless energy,
and even in quieter moments, an un
dercurrent of nervous intensity can
be felt. The succeeding movement is
energetic as well, but a swinging
rhythm introduces a note of greater
brilliancy. The final movements alter
nate between tranquility and a grow
ing fervor.
A second concert will be given by
the Abas String Quartet on Monday,
July 30, at Branner Hall. The program
will consist of Mozart's "Quartet in D
Major," "In the Mountains," by Ernest
Bloch, and Dvorak's" Quartet in E
Flat."
