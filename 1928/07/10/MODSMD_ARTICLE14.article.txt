# Bernardino Molinari Gives Pleasing Program In Debut At Hillsborough
## 
### Horace Bristol 
Those who braved the elements, so
to speak, and ignored the threat of
inclement, weather to hear Bernardino
Molinari in his Pacific Coast debut at
the Woodland Theatre Sunday after
noon were rewarded by a program of
studied excellence. That more than
2000 music lovers of the peninsula as
sembled at the Hillsborough amphi
theatre, in spite of the overcast sky,
was a decided testimony to the popu
larity of Signor Molinari, who is con
ductor of tlie Home Augusteo.
In his first appearance here on the
coast, Molinari offered most accept
able proof that his international
music reputation is deserved. His or
chestrations were full of fire and
verve, masterful in their delicate
nuances of feeling.
Mis first selection was a Corelli

Suite for strings. Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony, although well-known to
his audience, was the piece de resist
ance of the afternoon. In this univer
sally popular symphony, which offers
Beethoven at his best, the mastery
of Molinari was most evident. Through
the infinite repetition in the many
voices of the orchestra were all the
gradations and dainty shadings of
emotional tone.
The Strauss opus, "Death and
Transfiguration," while serious in
general mood and spirit was nicely
balanced by Rossini's "William Tell"
overture.
Signor Molinari, who must have
been pleased witli the ovation given
him at the close of the concert, will
again direct the Rnn Francisco Sym
phony at the afternoon program next
Sunday at 3 o'clock.
