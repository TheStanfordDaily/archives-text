# "QUEEN'S HUSBAND" IS ONE OF BIGGEST HITS OF STANFORD STAGE
## Gordon Davis, Betty Wilbur Star; Elaborate Sets Used Throughout 
### Laird Doyle 
"The Queen's Husband" was a huge
success, perhaps one of the biggest
hits that has ever been scored on the
i Stanford stage. The ovation and com
ments of a usually hyper-critical audi
ence deemed a triumph for the pro
duction. The play received more cur
tain calls than any campus produc
tion ever has before. It was an en
thusiastic recognition of a remark
able piece of work. Sherwood's satire
was completely interpreted and given
to the audience in a most finished
manner. The rough places are hardly
worthy of mention, as they were not
in excess of the number expected in
any first presentation.
Gordon Davis' cast and direction,
Helvenston's set, and Robert Sher
wood's play, were inseparable in cre
ating this finished production. Suc
cess was due to such a fortunate com
bination.
Davis, Wilbur Shine
Gordon Davis created a character
in King Eric which will be long re
membered. His portrayal might have
been done rudely and yet have been
successful. He deserves credit not for
the demanded character work, but for
his characterization of the part. He
drifted from piquant cynicism into
whimsical pathos without losing the
dry, weary resignation that formed
the foundation of his character;
subtle transition on a constant back
ground. Much was expected from Gor
don Davis and he surpassed expecta
tions.
