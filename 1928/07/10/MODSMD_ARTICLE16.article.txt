# "QUEEN'S HUSBAND" IS ONE OF BIGGEST HITS OF STANFORD STAGE
## Gordon Davis, Betty Wilbur Star; Elaborate Sets Used Throughout 
### Laird Doyle 
"The Queen's Husband" was a huge
success, perhaps one of the biggest
hits that has ever been scored on the
i Stanford stage. The ovation and com
ments of a usually hyper-critical audi
ence deemed a triumph for the pro
duction. The play received more cur
tain calls than any campus produc
tion ever has before. It was an en
thusiastic recognition of a remark
able piece of work. Sherwood's satire
was completely interpreted and given
to the audience in a most finished
manner. The rough places are hardly
worthy of mention, as they were not
in excess of the number expected in
any first presentation.
Gordon Davis' cast and direction,
Helvenston's set, and Robert Sher
wood's play, were inseparable in cre
ating this finished production. Suc
cess was due to such a fortunate com
bination.
Davis, Wilbur Shine
Gordon Davis created a character
in King Eric which will be long re
membered. His portrayal might have
been done rudely and yet have been
successful. He deserves credit not for
the demanded character work, but for
his characterization of the part. He
drifted from piquant cynicism into
whimsical pathos without losing the
dry, weary resignation that formed
the foundation of his character;
subtle transition on a constant back
ground. Much was expected from Gor
don Davis and he surpassed expecta
tions.
Betty Wilbur's work was difficult,
yet clear, and constant. She was vic
toriously disagreeable. To her belongs
the bow for the best piece of acting
throughout the presentation. The
scene between the King and Queen
where they are discussing their mar
riage is the point at which Betty
Wilbur drove her forcefulness into
the audience. Without words, without
pantomime, and with barely percep
tible facial mobility of the most subtle
strength she captured sympathy from
her character in a second's acting.
Betty Wilbur squeezed from her part
every drop of power.
Minor Parts Well-Played
Dick Fisher played a straight char
acter part with a definity which gave
the play that concreteness which
every play must have to keep it from
losing shape. Harold Brownson, play
ing Lord Burton, was not very con
sistent about his a's; he was never
sure whether they were broad or not.
Nevertheless he played a weak part
for all it was worth.
Leavenworth Colby and Burt Davis
were convincing footmen; they were
a little too prompt on their entrances,
but one can forgive that, for Colby
produced the sourest face that ever
fascinated an audience and Davis was
a complete enigma.
Dick Stewart and Corinne Franklin
played a minor love plot charmingly.
What they lacked in intensity was
made up by Stewart's appearance and
by Miss Franklin's vivaciousness and
her dependable steadiness. Much
credit is due them, for they fitted
themselves into the major plot with
out trying to overweigh their own sub
interest.
Irving Rosenblatt as Prince William
of Greek was a perfect ass. His dic
tion, attitude, and reactions were con
sumate. He did the best straight
character part in the entire play.
Elmo Robinson, who played the
part of the Liberal leader, lacked
drive and distinctness, but there can
be little adverse criticism about his
work, for he put his lines over. Laker,
the anarchist, Played by Byron Snow,
was a good part to which he did not
do full justice. His nervous strides
across the stage reminded one more

of the comic strip cat and then a
blood-letting anarchist.
Louise Shoup and Mildred Willis
were pleasant to look at, and if they
could have been heard, probably
would have been charming to listen
to. However, they convinced the audi
ence of their timidity before the

Queen, so It didn't make much dif
| ference.
Bob Sears as a captain of the army
lent snap to the production, same can
be said of his army—both of them.
Harold Helvenston deserves great
praise for his creations. The auditory
; offstage business, the harmonizing of

I set and costumes, the contrapuntal
t lighting innovation, the startling sets
I and costumes, all are evidences of his
j ability. Helvenston has proved to the
! campus that his reputation is war
ranted.

a little too prompt on their entrances,
but one can forgive that, for Colby
produced the sourest face that ever
fascinated an audience and Davis was
a complete enigma.
Dick Stewart and Corinne Franklin
played a minor love plot charmingly.
What they lacked in intensity was
made up by Stewart's appearance and
by Miss Franklin's vivaciousness and
her dependable steadiness. Much
credit is due them, for they fitted
themselves into the major plot with
out trying to overweigh their own sub
interest.
Irving Rosenblatt as Prince William
of Greek was a perfect ass. His dic
tion, attitude, and reactions were con
sumate. He did the best straight
character part in the entire play.
Elmo Robinson, who played the
part of the Liberal leader, lacked
drive and distinctness, but there can
be little adverse criticism about his
work, for he put his lines over. Laker,
the anarchist, Played by Byron Snow,
was a good part to which he did not
do full justice. His nervous strides
across the stage reminded one more

of the comic strip cat and then a
blood-letting anarchist.
Louise Shoup and Mildred Willis
were pleasant to look at, and if they
could have been heard, probably
would have been charming to listen
to. However, they convinced the audi
ence of their timidity before the

Queen, so It didn't make much dif
| ference.
Bob Sears as a captain of the army
lent snap to the production, same can
be said of his army—both of them.
Harold Helvenston deserves great
praise for his creations. The auditory
; offstage business, the harmonizing of

I set and costumes, the contrapuntal
t lighting innovation, the startling sets
I and costumes, all are evidences of his
j ability. Helvenston has proved to the
! campus that his reputation is war
ranted.
"The Queen's Husband" was a huge
success, perhaps one of the biggest
hits that has ever been scored on the
i Stanford stage. The ovation and com
ments of a usually hyper-critical audi
ence deemed a triumph for the pro
duction. The play received more cur
tain calls than any campus produc
tion ever has before. It was an en
thusiastic recognition of a remark
able piece of work. Sherwood's satire
was completely interpreted and given
to the audience in a most finished
manner. The rough places are hardly
worthy of mention, as they were not
in excess of the number expected in
any first presentation.
Gordon Davis' cast and direction,
Helvenston's set, and Robert Sher
wood's play, were inseparable in cre
ating this finished production. Suc
cess was due to such a fortunate com
bination.
Davis, Wilbur Shine
Gordon Davis created a character
in King Eric which will be long re
membered. His portrayal might have
been done rudely and yet have been
successful. He deserves credit not for
the demanded character work, but for
his characterization of the part. He
drifted from piquant cynicism into
whimsical pathos without losing the
dry, weary resignation that formed
the foundation of his character;
subtle transition on a constant back
ground. Much was expected from Gor
don Davis and he surpassed expecta
tions.
Betty Wilbur's work was difficult,
yet clear, and constant. She was vic
toriously disagreeable. To her belongs
the bow for the best piece of acting
throughout the presentation. The
scene between the King and Queen
where they are discussing their mar
riage is the point at which Betty
Wilbur drove her forcefulness into
the audience. Without words, without
pantomime, and with barely percep
tible facial mobility of the most subtle
strength she captured sympathy from
her character in a second's acting.
Betty Wilbur squeezed from her part
every drop of power.
Minor Parts Well-Played
Dick Fisher played a straight char
acter part with a definity which gave
the play that concreteness which
every play must have to keep it from
losing shape. Harold Brownson, play
ing Lord Burton, was not very con
sistent about his a's; he was never
sure whether they were broad or not.
Nevertheless he played a weak part
for all it was worth.

Gordon Davis' cast and direction,
Helvenston's set, and Robert Sher
wood's play, were inseparable in cre
ating this finished production. Suc
cess was due to such a fortunate com
bination.
Davis, Wilbur Shine
Gordon Davis created a character
in King Eric which will be long re
membered. His portrayal might have
been done rudely and yet have been
successful. He deserves credit not for
the demanded character work, but for
his characterization of the part. He
drifted from piquant cynicism into
whimsical pathos without losing the
dry, weary resignation that formed
the foundation of his character;
subtle transition on a constant back
ground. Much was expected from Gor
don Davis and he surpassed expecta
tions.
Betty Wilbur's work was difficult,
yet clear, and constant. She was vic
toriously disagreeable. To her belongs
the bow for the best piece of acting
throughout the presentation. The
scene between the King and Queen
where they are discussing their mar
riage is the point at which Betty
Wilbur drove her forcefulness into
the audience. Without words, without
pantomime, and with barely percep
tible facial mobility of the most subtle
strength she captured sympathy from
her character in a second's acting.
Betty Wilbur squeezed from her part
every drop of power.
Minor Parts Well-Played
Dick Fisher played a straight char
acter part with a definity which gave
the play that concreteness which
every play must have to keep it from
losing shape. Harold Brownson, play
ing Lord Burton, was not very con
sistent about his a's; he was never
sure whether they were broad or not.
Nevertheless he played a weak part
for all it was worth.
Leavenworth Colby and Burt Davis
were convincing footmen; they were
a little too prompt on their entrances,
but one can forgive that, for Colby
produced the sourest face that ever
fascinated an audience and Davis was
a complete enigma.
Dick Stewart and Corinne Franklin
played a minor love plot charmingly.
What they lacked in intensity was
made up by Stewart's appearance and
by Miss Franklin's vivaciousness and
her dependable steadiness. Much
credit is due them, for they fitted
themselves into the major plot with
out trying to overweigh their own sub
interest.
Irving Rosenblatt as Prince William
of Greek was a perfect ass. His dic
tion, attitude, and reactions were con
sumate. He did the best straight
character part in the entire play.
Elmo Robinson, who played the
part of the Liberal leader, lacked
drive and distinctness, but there can
be little adverse criticism about his
work, for he put his lines over. Laker,
the anarchist, Played by Byron Snow,
was a good part to which he did not
do full justice. His nervous strides
across the stage reminded one more

of the comic strip cat and then a
blood-letting anarchist.
Louise Shoup and Mildred Willis
were pleasant to look at, and if they
could have been heard, probably
would have been charming to listen
to. However, they convinced the audi
ence of their timidity before the

Queen, so It didn't make much dif
| ference.
Bob Sears as a captain of the army
lent snap to the production, same can
be said of his army—both of them.
Harold Helvenston deserves great
praise for his creations. The auditory
; offstage business, the harmonizing of

I set and costumes, the contrapuntal
t lighting innovation, the startling sets
I and costumes, all are evidences of his
j ability. Helvenston has proved to the
! campus that his reputation is war
ranted.
