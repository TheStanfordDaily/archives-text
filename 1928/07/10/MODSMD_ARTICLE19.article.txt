# FOUR CARDS MAKE AMSTERDAM TRIP WITH U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM
## Team Shows Up Well After Period of Training and Long Eastern Trip Ross Nichols Leading Field Trips Over Last Hurdle And Loses Final 
### 
Telephone reports at the time
the Daily was going to press in
dicated that the Olympic Games
Track Committee had not recon
sidered its action in eliminating
Eric Krenz from the discus throw
and Ross Nichols from the hurdles.
The reports indicated that the
possibility was slight that these
men would compete in these
events, although Krenz will go to
Amsterdam since he qualified in
the shot put.

With Ross Nichols. Card captain
elect, definitely out of the running,
only four members cf the Champion
ship Stanford Track team will make
the trip to Amsterdam at the expense
of the U.S. Olympic Games Commit
tee. Those who have cinched places
for themselves are Captain Bud Spen
cer, as a member of the 1600-meter
r:i!ay team; Bob King, winner of the
high jump finals and one of the
American hopes for a first place in
that event; Harlow Rothert, second
in the shotput tryouts and a cinch for
a place in the Games; Eric Krenz,
fourth in the shot, and if he's right
when the team hits the Lowlands, it
will mean two places in this event.
Long Season Handicaps
Although failing to live up to the
expectations of Coach Dink Temple
ton, the team did exceptionally well
considering the lengthy season they
have gone through, the long trip east,
and their six weeks' stay on the At
lantic coast before the tryouts. Sick
ness, too, handicapped several mem
bers of the team. This, no doubt, was
caused by different climatic condi
tions. These reasons are not given as
an alibi, for surely no college squad
who can place four of its members on
an international team should be
forced to give one of those things.
Captain-elect Ross Nichols con
tinued his record as the original hard
luck kid, when after winning all of
his heats and tying the world's record
in one of them, he fell over the last
hurdle as he was leading the field in
his favorite event, the 110-meter high
hurdle race. Nick was the victim of
a bad break it developed afterwards,
for it was later announced by officials
that the hurdle over which he tripped
was slightly out of place, just enough
to cause him to trip in allowing a
minimum of clearance over the last
hurdle between him and a journey to
the Dutch Sweepstakes.
Then there was Bob King, the lanky
Card high jumper, who in the final
jump-off leaped 6 feet 6 inches to beat
out Charley McClinnis, Chicago A.A.
star.
Weight Men Come Through
Harlow Rothert came through in
regular style by copping a second in
the shotput, while his teammate Eric
Krenz was holding down a fourth
place in the same event. Krenz, who
was doped to be up among the leaders
in the discus throw, was reported not
to have placed in that event in the
early editions following the meet. It
was later found that a mistake had
been made in measuring his first toss
which was approximately 150 feet.
After being convinced of this fact, of
ficials gave him another chance where
upon Eric proceeded to throw said
platter some 147 or 148 feet which
would have placed him a good third
in the regular tryouts. But, strange to
say, the officials completely ignored
this proof of his ability, so Krenz will
represent the U.S. only in the shotput.
Last but not least, is Captain Bud
Spencer, who qualified as a member
of the 1600-meter relay team in the
trials last Wednesday.
Alumnus Makes Team
A Stanford alumnus, and member
of Coach Templeton's 1926 track team,
Chuck Harlow, now under the colors
of the Los Angeles A.C. team, came
through in the javelin throw with a
toss of 201 feet 3 inches, which gave
him a second place in that event, and
a big trip to boot.

No significant differences exist in
the basic sensory musical capacities
of whites and negroes, according to
experiments conducted by Dean Carl
E. Seashore of the Department of
Psychology of lowa University.

ficials gave him another chance where
upon Eric proceeded to throw said
platter some 147 or 148 feet which
would have placed him a good third
in the regular tryouts. But, strange to
say, the officials completely ignored
this proof of his ability, so Krenz will
represent the U.S. only in the shotput.
Last but not least, is Captain Bud
Spencer, who qualified as a member
of the 1600-meter relay team in the
trials last Wednesday.
Alumnus Makes Team
A Stanford alumnus, and member
of Coach Templeton's 1926 track team,
Chuck Harlow, now under the colors
of the Los Angeles A.C. team, came
through in the javelin throw with a
toss of 201 feet 3 inches, which gave
him a second place in that event, and
a big trip to boot.

No significant differences exist in
the basic sensory musical capacities
of whites and negroes, according to
experiments conducted by Dean Carl
E. Seashore of the Department of
Psychology of lowa University.
Telephone reports at the time
the Daily was going to press in
dicated that the Olympic Games
Track Committee had not recon
sidered its action in eliminating
Eric Krenz from the discus throw
and Ross Nichols from the hurdles.
The reports indicated that the
possibility was slight that these
men would compete in these
events, although Krenz will go to
Amsterdam since he qualified in
the shot put.

With Ross Nichols. Card captain
elect, definitely out of the running,
only four members cf the Champion
ship Stanford Track team will make
the trip to Amsterdam at the expense
of the U.S. Olympic Games Commit
tee. Those who have cinched places
for themselves are Captain Bud Spen
cer, as a member of the 1600-meter
r:i!ay team; Bob King, winner of the
high jump finals and one of the
American hopes for a first place in
that event; Harlow Rothert, second
in the shotput tryouts and a cinch for
a place in the Games; Eric Krenz,
fourth in the shot, and if he's right
when the team hits the Lowlands, it
will mean two places in this event.
Long Season Handicaps
Although failing to live up to the
expectations of Coach Dink Temple
ton, the team did exceptionally well
considering the lengthy season they
have gone through, the long trip east,
and their six weeks' stay on the At
lantic coast before the tryouts. Sick
ness, too, handicapped several mem
bers of the team. This, no doubt, was
caused by different climatic condi
tions. These reasons are not given as
an alibi, for surely no college squad
who can place four of its members on
an international team should be
forced to give one of those things.
Captain-elect Ross Nichols con
tinued his record as the original hard
luck kid, when after winning all of
his heats and tying the world's record
in one of them, he fell over the last
hurdle as he was leading the field in
his favorite event, the 110-meter high
hurdle race. Nick was the victim of
a bad break it developed afterwards,
for it was later announced by officials
that the hurdle over which he tripped
was slightly out of place, just enough
to cause him to trip in allowing a
minimum of clearance over the last
hurdle between him and a journey to
the Dutch Sweepstakes.
Then there was Bob King, the lanky
Card high jumper, who in the final
jump-off leaped 6 feet 6 inches to beat
out Charley McClinnis, Chicago A.A.
star.
Weight Men Come Through
Harlow Rothert came through in
regular style by copping a second in
the shotput, while his teammate Eric
Krenz was holding down a fourth
place in the same event. Krenz, who
was doped to be up among the leaders
in the discus throw, was reported not
to have placed in that event in the

been made in measuring his first toss

for it was later announced by officials
that the hurdle over which he tripped
was slightly out of place, just enough
to cause him to trip in allowing a
minimum of clearance over the last
hurdle between him and a journey to
the Dutch Sweepstakes.
Then there was Bob King, the lanky
Card high jumper, who in the final
jump-off leaped 6 feet 6 inches to beat
out Charley McClinnis, Chicago A.A.
star.
Weight Men Come Through
Harlow Rothert came through in
regular style by copping a second in
the shotput, while his teammate Eric
Krenz was holding down a fourth
place in the same event. Krenz, who
was doped to be up among the leaders
in the discus throw, was reported not
to have placed in that event in the
early editions following the meet. It
was later found that a mistake had
been made in measuring his first toss
which was approximately 150 feet.
After being convinced of this fact, of
ficials gave him another chance where
upon Eric proceeded to throw said
platter some 147 or 148 feet which
would have placed him a good third
in the regular tryouts. But, strange to
say, the officials completely ignored
this proof of his ability, so Krenz will
represent the U.S. only in the shotput.
Last but not least, is Captain Bud
Spencer, who qualified as a member
of the 1600-meter relay team in the
trials last Wednesday.
Alumnus Makes Team
A Stanford alumnus, and member
of Coach Templeton's 1926 track team,
Chuck Harlow, now under the colors
of the Los Angeles A.C. team, came
through in the javelin throw with a
toss of 201 feet 3 inches, which gave
him a second place in that event, and
a big trip to boot.

No significant differences exist in
the basic sensory musical capacities
of whites and negroes, according to
experiments conducted by Dean Carl
E. Seashore of the Department of
Psychology of lowa University.
