# FOUR CARDS MAKE AMSTERDAM TRIP WITH U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM
## Team Shows Up Well After Period of Training and Long Eastern Trip Ross Nichols Leading Field Trips Over Last Hurdle And Loses Final 
### 
Telephone reports at the time
the Daily was going to press in
dicated that the Olympic Games
Track Committee had not recon
sidered its action in eliminating
Eric Krenz from the discus throw
and Ross Nichols from the hurdles.
The reports indicated that the
possibility was slight that these
men would compete in these
events, although Krenz will go to
Amsterdam since he qualified in
the shot put.

With Ross Nichols. Card captain
elect, definitely out of the running,
only four members cf the Champion
ship Stanford Track team will make
the trip to Amsterdam at the expense
of the U.S. Olympic Games Commit
tee. Those who have cinched places
for themselves are Captain Bud Spen
cer, as a member of the 1600-meter
r:i!ay team; Bob King, winner of the
high jump finals and one of the
American hopes for a first place in
that event; Harlow Rothert, second
in the shotput tryouts and a cinch for
a place in the Games; Eric Krenz,
fourth in the shot, and if he's right
when the team hits the Lowlands, it
will mean two places in this event.

Although failing to live up to the
expectations of Coach Dink Temple

considering the lengthy season they
have gone through, the long trip east,
and their six weeks' stay on the At
lantic coast before the tryouts. Sick
ness, too, handicapped several mem
bers of the team. This, no doubt, was
caused by different climatic condi
tions. These reasons are not given as
an alibi, for surely no college squad
who can place four of its members on
an international team should be
forced to give one of those things.
Captain-elect Ross Nichols con
tinued his record as the original hard
luck kid, when after winning all of
his heats and tying the world's record
in one of them, he fell over the last
hurdle as he was leading the field in
his favorite event, the 110-meter high
hurdle race. Nick was the victim of
a bad break it developed afterwards,
for it was later announced by officials
that the hurdle over which he tripped
