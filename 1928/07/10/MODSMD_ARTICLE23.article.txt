# Remove The Cause
## 
### 
Two more people killed trying to beat a train to a crossing. Many
people will read of the foolish attempt of the young man to beat the
train, will make some comment, and will forget the incident. There
are so many deaths caused in exactly this same manner that they are
becoming commonplace.
Unfortunately everyone seems to be too busy to learn the lesson
that the death of these two people teaches. Some day the public will
learn, and the railroads will learn that it is not enough to take ordinary
precautions against such accidents. Such precautions as are being
taken now only offer protection to people who are endowed with com
mon sense.
These people do not need protection for they can take care of
themselves. The protection must be for those who are not endowed
with enough common sense to realize that it is foolish to wager two
lives against a few brief seconds of waiting.
We suggest that every attempt be made to eliminate dangerous
crossings, either by making them elevated or underground or building
the main roads so that they cross railroads as few times as is possible.
We might point out that a person can travel from Palo Alto to San
Francisco without crossing the main line at all. Crossings which are
not so dangerous should be protected by gates. Deaths would prob
ably continue, but they would be cut down to a minimum.
