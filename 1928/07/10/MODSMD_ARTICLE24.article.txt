# Play At Home

We learn that tickets to the Toyon all-University dance have not
been selling very rapidly. We regard this as unfortunate as it will be
the only campus dance during the first six weeks of the quarter.
Enough tickets have been sold to guarantee the social success of the
dance but they were priced lower than in regular quarters so that
it would be possible for a larger number to attend. It was expected
that with a lower price and a larger crowd the dance would pay
expenses. Toyon dances are not run for profit but are expected to
make expenses. If the first dance is not a financial success it is
improbable that a second one will be given.
Possibly the small ticket sale is due to the fact that students do
not understand that the tickets are not restricted to men living in
Toyon but may be purchased by anyone. On the other hand it may
be due to the fact that students would rather satisfy their social
desires off-campus, presumably San Francisco. We hope that this is
not the case as we believe that students will get more fun out of
Summer Quarter if they have part of their social diversion with the
people with whom they work each day.
