From the finals of the Olympic Trials comes the word that four
Cardinals have definitely.been named for the United States Olympic
Games track team. We congratulate these men on their success and
sympathize with the Cards who failed to make the team. Some of
those who failed were not in good condition after their long season,
some were nosed out by men who came through with better marks
than they were expected to make, and others had tough luck.
Ross Nichols and Eric Krenz are the two men that seem to have
been eliminated by tough luck. Krenz will make the trip but was not
picked in the discus, his strongest event. It is possible that the
officials will change their minds again and take Nichols on the team
and allow Krenz to enter the discus.
In the hopes that they will realize their error, we will not berate
the officials who made these judgments. We believes that both Krenz
and Nichols are among the first three in the United States in their
respective events and believe that the United States team will be
weakened if they are not picked.
We also congratulate the California crew on their wonderful
showing in the East.
