# Remedy On Way
## 
### 
The Campus Opinion which appears today regarding traffic condi
tions on the campus makes a good point concerning arterial stop
signs on the campus, although the writer is unnecessarily sarcastic in
his statement of affairs. For the benefit of '26, we will say that
campus authorities have promised to remedy this situation, and hope
to have it done by this Sunday.
