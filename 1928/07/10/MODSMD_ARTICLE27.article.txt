There are many interesting places
and picturesque scenes in San Fran
cisco if the visitor only knows where
to find them. These are not the ordi
nary "points of interest" which every
town uncovers or builds for the bene
fit of its out-of-town visitors, but are
world-renowned institutions, monu
ments to the work of man and nature.
It is the purpose of this column to
point these out to the summer session
student so that he can take advan
tage of his nearness to them.

The most famous of all San Fran
cisco's show places is the Golden
Gate. If a person stands on the cliff
just below the Presidio, and looks
over the water toward the other side,
he has before him the entrance to

one of the greatest and most import
ant bays, and the most famous "gate"
in the world. It receives its name from
the golden glow which the setting sun
casts upon it.

The Embarcadero is San Francis
co's water front, and is the scene of
a very active shipping business.
Trucks with all kinds of products
bump along this rough cobblestone
road. Stevedores, bums, vegetable
vendors, and all sorts of humanity
wander aimlessly around, or else walk
with the hurried, precise step of a
man who lias a destination of im
portance. Large and small boats are
docked at piers along the Embarca
dero, and they are either loading or
unloading, either bringing or taking
away. This street is the center of San
Francisco's great prosperity.
