The Editor, Sir:
All of us are bothered by the super
abundance of gnats or small mosqui
toes or whatever they are. This pest
appears annually on the campus. The
cause is as obvious as it is prevent
able —we refer to that stagnant mud
puddle which in its prime is Lagunita.
Be it known that we are not ob
jecting to Lagunita but to the slow
manner in which it is drained. Could
n't the drainage process be speeded
up somewhat? This foul pool which
is cherished for so long a time is a
menace to the health of the campus
in general, and to Roble in particular.
Yours for fewer bugs,
'29 and '30.

The Editor, Sir:
During the past few weeks there
have appeared in these columns many
objections to the present system of
traffic regulation on this campus. As
far as I know, not one of these criti
cisms has accomplished one iota of
good and I do not doubt but that this
one will also fail to penetrate. My
criticism is that the "Arterial Stop"
signs are sprinkled over the campus
indiscriminately. Some cow path that
is frequented by two automobiles a
month is sure to have its stop sign,
yet the most dangerous corner on the
campus has no warning sign what
ever. The place I refer to is at the
corner of Lagunita Drive and May
field avenue.
At this corner five streets come to
gether. The traffic is heavy, espe
cially on Sundays and holidays. Trees
and buildings cut off the vision of
the drivers, yet there isn't even a
sign there that says "Speed Limit 15
Miles on Intersection." For several
years collisions have been frequent at
this point yet nothing is ever done
about it. During the last days of
spring quarter two cars belonging to
students collided head-on at this cor
ner and serious damage was done to
both of them. A week ago last Sunday,
the writer observed two accidents
there within the space of an hour.
Neither was very serious, but both
came very near being so. In one in
stance a delapidated Ford went
careening into a new car belonging to
a very prominent member of our fac
ulty.
Whoever was responsible for deter
mining the 'locations of the "Arterial
Stop" signs was either tremendously
thick-headed or knew nothing of cam
pus traffic conditions. This corner will
continue to be a dangerous menace
until at least three of these signs are
judiciously placed there, and this can
be done without purchasing any new
signs. —'26.
