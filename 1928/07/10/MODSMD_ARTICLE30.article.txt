# VASCONCELOS TALKS ON MONROE DOCTRINE AT MONDAY LECTURE
## Has Important Knowledge of Happenings in States Of South America 
### 
Doctor Vasconcelos in a lecture yes
terday at the Little Theatre discussed i
the effect of the Monroe Doctrine on |
Latin America in a very able and
familiar manner. Doctor Vasconcelos
evinced much first-hand information
concerning happenings in the South
American republics that gave added
weight to his lecture.
At the time it was proclaimed, said
Doctor Vasconcelos, the United States
was not in a position to guarantee its
absolute enforcement in the face of
European aggression, but it served as
a guarantee of sympathy between the
nations. Mexico, not being in the marts
of trade as was Brazil and Argentina,
must of necessity depend on the
friendship of the United States.
In the case of Brazil and Argentina,
two nations that have established an
international policy, have maintained
relations of trade and immigration
with Europe and have grown to pro
portions of wealth and power. The
other South American republics have
adTtnced but slowly, yet because of
the character of their people, educa
tion must be their first concern, and
government stability and nationalism
will advance.
The effort made by Mr. Blaine to
establish a policy of friendship among
the Pan American republics was met
with but partial favor among them.
They were, however, successful in es
tablishing much helpful trade rela
tions, though little governmental un
derstanding could be decided on in
an organization consisting of one
strong and twenty weak members,
other than the relations of depend
encies and a recognition of the Big
Brother policy of the United States.
Mr. Wilson's announcements on the
i situation, which Doctor Vasconcelos
read, were pronounced fair enough,
but Mexico realizes that if she is ever
to rise to a newer outlook she must
develop her own internal resources,
educate her population, and ibeet the
friendly spirit of the United States
with hearty co-operation.
Dr. Vasconcelos will speak again
this afternoon in the Little Theatre
at 4:15 o'clock on the subject, "Latin
America Today."
