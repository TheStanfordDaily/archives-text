# MOVING PICTURES ARE OUTGROWTH OF EARLY TESTS AT STANFORD
## Argument Over Horses' Pace Leads to Experiments In Photography 
### 
Now that movies have taken a step
in advance from the common variety
to the "talkies," it is interesting to
remember that the original idea of
moving pictures was developed right
here at Stanford—not in the Univer
sity's laboratories, but at a time long
before it was dreamed that "the
farm" would be turned into an educa
tional center.
As Governor Leland Stanford's
hobby was the raising of fine steeds,
he naturally had his own opinions
concerning the horse. He differed
from the notions of James R. Keene
and Frederick MacCrellish in the be
lief that at various gaits a horse at
full speed took all of his four feet off
the ground at once. To settle this
argument it necessarily needed proof,
but a scientific solution could not rest
upon the work of artists or sculptors,
so Stanford resorted to photography,
employing a San Francisco photogra
pher, Eadweard Muybridge, who was
probably known to the Governor by
his outstanding photographs of Alaska
which helped to justify the purchase
of "Seward's Folly."
First Work Fails
The experimental work of 1872
which was done in Sacramento was
a decided failure, as the briefest ex
posure then practical, a twelfth of a
second, caused a trotting horse to
give but a blur for a picture. Five
years later the chemistry of photo
graphy developed so that the move
ments of the speeding horse could be
pictured. The problem now consisted
of so timing the exposure so that the
whole horse would be shown on the
plate.
By sheer chance out of hundreds of
attempts there were a few pictures
that showed a horse with its feet off
of the ground. These costly pictures,
however, could not be arranged in the
sequence of the gait, for they were
not all the same horse. Governor
Stanford then instructed Muybridge
to try a row of cameras. As the horse
progressed down the line, he was ex
pected to take his own picture by j
snapping strings attached to the
shutters. This method proved unsatis
factory due to the horse frightening
itself.
Use Electric Circuit
The work was then put under the
charge of John D. Isaacs, a member
of the engineering staff of the Cen
tral Pacific. After some laboratory
studies of the motion of a rolling
wheel, he obtained successful results
by stretching wires across part of the
race track here on the Stanford farm.
The cameras were set off when the
electric circuit was closed by the
steel wheels of the racing sulky. To
get pictures of the running horse with
no vehicle to close the circuit, a
cylinder with projecting pins like that
of a music box took successive pic
tures as the pins one after the other
closed contacts. Excellent results
were obtained so the battery of cam
eras was increased from five to twen
ty-four, and the horse was photo
graphed against a screen resembling
cross-section paper. This latter im
provement enabled an accurate de
termination of the relation of the hoof
to the track at any instant of expo
sure. Muybridge then took up Isaac's
work and photographed any animal
he could get in front of the cameras.
Subject of Two Books
Stanford had now invested approxi- |
mately $40,000 in his horse pictures
which proved the subject for two
books, "The Horse in Motion, as
Shown by Instantaneous Photogra
phy," by Dr. J. D. B. Stillman, and
copyrighted by Leland Stanford in
1881; and "Descriptive Zoopraxo
graphy —or the Science of Animal Lo
comotion," by E. Muybridge. This
latter book in a de luxe edition ranged
in price from one hundred to five
hundred dollars, and comprised a set
of eight volumes each the size of an
ordinary newspaper file.
Get Microscopic Detail
Governor Stanford sent Muybridge
to France with the pictures to see
Meissonier, an artist noted for his
microscopic detail. These pictures of
horses, dogs, and deer in action
caused a great deal of heated argu
ment among Parisian creative work
ers. To prove that these pictures were
genuine, Meissonier had them con
verted into transparencies and applied
them to the zoetropic machine con
sisting of a glass disc, projecting
lense, and a shutter so arranged that
a glimpse of some phase of motion
was supplanted by another. This de
vice with the Stanford-Isaacs-Muy
bridge pictures became known by the
impressive name of Zoopraxiscope,
and unrefutably showed that these so
called awkward hoof positions fit into
the gait. The University of Pennsyl
vania entered an exhibit of the pic
tures including those on the Zoopraxi
scope at Zoopraxographical Hall at
the Columbian Exposition in Chicago
in 1893, and 10, the moving picture
was presented to the world.

mately $40,000 in his horse pictures
which proved the subject for two
books, "The Horse in Motion, as
Shown by Instantaneous Photogra
phy," by Dr. J. D. B. Stillman, and
copyrighted by Leland Stanford in
1881; and "Descriptive Zoopraxo
graphy —or the Science of Animal Lo
comotion," by E. Muybridge. This
latter book in a de luxe edition ranged
in price from one hundred to five
hundred dollars, and comprised a set
of eight volumes each the size of an
ordinary newspaper file.
Get Microscopic Detail
Governor Stanford sent Muybridge
to France with the pictures to see
Meissonier, an artist noted for his
microscopic detail. These pictures of
horses, dogs, and deer in action
caused a great deal of heated argu
ment among Parisian creative work
ers. To prove that these pictures were
genuine, Meissonier had them con
verted into transparencies and applied
them to the zoetropic machine con
sisting of a glass disc, projecting
lense, and a shutter so arranged that
a glimpse of some phase of motion
was supplanted by another. This de
vice with the Stanford-Isaacs-Muy
bridge pictures became known by the
impressive name of Zoopraxiscope,
and unrefutably showed that these so
called awkward hoof positions fit into
the gait. The University of Pennsyl
vania entered an exhibit of the pic
tures including those on the Zoopraxi
scope at Zoopraxographical Hall at
the Columbian Exposition in Chicago
in 1893, and 10, the moving picture
was presented to the world.
Now that movies have taken a step
in advance from the common variety
to the "talkies," it is interesting to
remember that the original idea of
moving pictures was developed right
here at Stanford—not in the Univer
sity's laboratories, but at a time long
before it was dreamed that "the
farm" would be turned into an educa
tional center.
As Governor Leland Stanford's
hobby was the raising of fine steeds,
he naturally had his own opinions
concerning the horse. He differed
from the notions of James R. Keene
and Frederick MacCrellish in the be
lief that at various gaits a horse at
full speed took all of his four feet off
the ground at once. To settle this
argument it necessarily needed proof,
but a scientific solution could not rest
upon the work of artists or sculptors,
so Stanford resorted to photography,
employing a San Francisco photogra
pher, Eadweard Muybridge, who was
probably known to the Governor by
his outstanding photographs of Alaska
which helped to justify the purchase
of "Seward's Folly."
First Work Fails
The experimental work of 1872
which was done in Sacramento was
a decided failure, as the briefest ex
posure then practical, a twelfth of a
second, caused a trotting horse to
give but a blur for a picture. Five
years later the chemistry of photo
graphy developed so that the move
ments of the speeding horse could be
pictured. The problem now consisted
of so timing the exposure so that the
whole horse would be shown on the
plate.
By sheer chance out of hundreds of
attempts there were a few pictures
that showed a horse with its feet off
of the ground. These costly pictures,
however, could not be arranged in the
sequence of the gait, for they were
not all the same horse. Governor
Stanford then instructed Muybridge
to try a row of cameras. As the horse
progressed down the line, he was ex
pected to take his own picture by j
snapping strings attached to the
shutters. This method proved unsatis
factory due to the horse frightening
itself.
Use Electric Circuit
The work was then put under the
charge of John D. Isaacs, a member
of the engineering staff of the Cen
tral Pacific. After some laboratory
studies of the motion of a rolling
wheel, he obtained successful results
by stretching wires across part of the
race track here on the Stanford farm.
The cameras were set off when the
electric circuit was closed by the
steel wheels of the racing sulky. To
get pictures of the running horse with
no vehicle to close the circuit, a
cylinder with projecting pins like that
of a music box took successive pic
tures as the pins one after the other
closed contacts. Excellent results
were obtained so the battery of cam
eras was increased from five to twen
ty-four, and the horse was photo
graphed against a screen resembling
cross-section paper. This latter im
provement enabled an accurate de
termination of the relation of the hoof
to the track at any instant of expo
sure. Muybridge then took up Isaac's
work and photographed any animal
he could get in front of the cameras.

attempts there were a few pictures
that showed a horse with its feet off
of the ground. These costly pictures,
however, could not be arranged in the
sequence of the gait, for they were
not all the same horse. Governor
Stanford then instructed Muybridge
to try a row of cameras. As the horse
progressed down the line, he was ex
pected to take his own picture by j
snapping strings attached to the
shutters. This method proved unsatis
factory due to the horse frightening
itself.
Use Electric Circuit
The work was then put under the
charge of John D. Isaacs, a member
of the engineering staff of the Cen
tral Pacific. After some laboratory
studies of the motion of a rolling
wheel, he obtained successful results
by stretching wires across part of the
race track here on the Stanford farm.
The cameras were set off when the
electric circuit was closed by the
steel wheels of the racing sulky. To
get pictures of the running horse with
no vehicle to close the circuit, a
cylinder with projecting pins like that
of a music box took successive pic
tures as the pins one after the other
closed contacts. Excellent results
were obtained so the battery of cam
eras was increased from five to twen
ty-four, and the horse was photo
graphed against a screen resembling
cross-section paper. This latter im
provement enabled an accurate de
termination of the relation of the hoof
to the track at any instant of expo
sure. Muybridge then took up Isaac's
work and photographed any animal
he could get in front of the cameras.
Subject of Two Books
Stanford had now invested approxi- |
mately $40,000 in his horse pictures
which proved the subject for two
books, "The Horse in Motion, as
Shown by Instantaneous Photogra
phy," by Dr. J. D. B. Stillman, and
copyrighted by Leland Stanford in
1881; and "Descriptive Zoopraxo
graphy —or the Science of Animal Lo
comotion," by E. Muybridge. This
latter book in a de luxe edition ranged
in price from one hundred to five
hundred dollars, and comprised a set
of eight volumes each the size of an
ordinary newspaper file.
Get Microscopic Detail
Governor Stanford sent Muybridge
to France with the pictures to see
Meissonier, an artist noted for his
microscopic detail. These pictures of
horses, dogs, and deer in action
caused a great deal of heated argu
ment among Parisian creative work
ers. To prove that these pictures were
genuine, Meissonier had them con
verted into transparencies and applied
them to the zoetropic machine con
sisting of a glass disc, projecting
lense, and a shutter so arranged that
a glimpse of some phase of motion
was supplanted by another. This de
vice with the Stanford-Isaacs-Muy
bridge pictures became known by the
impressive name of Zoopraxiscope,
and unrefutably showed that these so
called awkward hoof positions fit into
the gait. The University of Pennsyl
vania entered an exhibit of the pic
tures including those on the Zoopraxi
scope at Zoopraxographical Hall at
the Columbian Exposition in Chicago
in 1893, and 10, the moving picture
was presented to the world.
Now that movies have taken a step
in advance from the common variety
to the "talkies," it is interesting to
remember that the original idea of
moving pictures was developed right
here at Stanford—not in the Univer
sity's laboratories, but at a time long
before it was dreamed that "the
farm" would be turned into an educa
tional center.
As Governor Leland Stanford's
hobby was the raising of fine steeds,
he naturally had his own opinions
concerning the horse. He differed
from the notions of James R. Keene
and Frederick MacCrellish in the be
lief that at various gaits a horse at
full speed took all of his four feet off
the ground at once. To settle this
argument it necessarily needed proof,
but a scientific solution could not rest
upon the work of artists or sculptors,
so Stanford resorted to photography,
employing a San Francisco photogra
pher, Eadweard Muybridge, who was
probably known to the Governor by
his outstanding photographs of Alaska
which helped to justify the purchase
of "Seward's Folly."
First Work Fails
The experimental work of 1872
which was done in Sacramento was
a decided failure, as the briefest ex
posure then practical, a twelfth of a
second, caused a trotting horse to
give but a blur for a picture. Five
years later the chemistry of photo
graphy developed so that the move
ments of the speeding horse could be
pictured. The problem now consisted
of so timing the exposure so that the
whole horse would be shown on the
plate.
