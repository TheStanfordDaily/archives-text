# BOARD OF TRUSTEES APPROVES NEW PLANS AT AVIATION SCHOOL
## Three Runways Constructed For Use of Planes in Hoover Welcome 
### 
An oiled runway 300 feet wide and
4000 feet long is under construction
at the flying field of the Palo Alto
School of Aviation in order to take
care of the big twelve-passenger tri
raotor Fokker ship, owned by the
Richfield Oil Company, and other
planes that will be used by the recep
tion committee for the welcoming
home of Herbert Hoover, Republican
candidate for president.
Besides the long runway, two oth
ers, one 2400 feet long and one 1500
feet long, are being erected. The 4000-
foot runway will enable planes to
take off in the direction of prevailing
winds, and so enable them to clear
University buildings and residences.
The two smaller runways will catch
any direction of the wind.
The Board of Trustees of the Uni
versity approved the plan last Thurs
day and since that time a crew of 30
men has been at work on this project.
It is estimated the cost will be about
$1000.
Trees at the western end of the
field and a large oak near the middle
of the field are being removed. Addi
tional parking space for extra planes
is available at the northern end of
the field.
Roy H. Button, University superin
tendent of buildings and grounds,
who is in charge of the work, expects
the three runways, which are being
watered, rolled, and oiled, will be
ready for use by Thursday.

The absence of any firmly estab
lished cultural background in Ameri
can family life has been largely re
sponsible for the partial failure of
our education, according to Professor
Robert C. Angell of the University of
Michigan.
