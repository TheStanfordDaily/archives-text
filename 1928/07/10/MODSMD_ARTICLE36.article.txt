# SANDPAINTING MADE BY INDIAN TO BE PLACED IN STANFORD MUSEUM
## Making of Sandpaintings Is Connected Closely to Redmen's Religion 
### 
A sandpainting similar to those
shown at the Star ford Art Gallery
last April when five Navajo Indians
exhibited their handiwork there has
been made for the Museum by one of
ihe ndians. It has been placed in the
Early American room upstairs.
The making and destroying of sand
paintings, along with weaving and
pottery work, dates back to prehis
toric times. It is not a commercial
art, however, but is connected with
healing ceremonies, initiations, and
religious festivals, especially sun
worship. The Indian is extremely re
ligious and every act in his daily life
is expressed with the deepest sin
cerity.
Sun Is God
He believes the sun is the mother
of all living things and at break of
dawn greets her with a chant of
thanksgiving and asks for protection
and guidance throughout the day. An
appointed official, who has served a
long apprenticeship to fit him for his
task, "paints" a sacred picture in the
sand. This is done by superimposing
colored sand, obtained by pulverizing
white, yellow, and red rock, upon an
area of sand that has been smoothed
over to make an even surface. Grey
is obtained by mixing white sand and
black charcoal. One of the tenets of
Indian philosophy is that everything
that is created is destroyed, so, as a
symbol of this belief, the sandpaint
ing is destroyed at sundown.
Dance Expresses Mystery
Among other Indian ceremonials
are those to prove endurance and
ability to withstand pain, and those
having to do with planting of crops,
rain, harvesting, corn grinding, fish
ing, hunting, and thanksgiving. The
Indian expresses his sense of the

great mystery of all things through
the dance, there being a special one
for almost every occasion. He per
sonifies the mountains, trees, and
rivers, and worships. Living so close
to nature, his livelihood dependent
upon her bounty, he worships Nature,
or the Great Spirit. The expression
of his devotion takes an unusually
picturesque form.
According to Leon Bakst, prominent
international artist, the Indians pro
duce the finest real handicraft in
America, and their designs are among
the world's finest motifs.

of his devotion takes an unusually
picturesque form.
According to Leon Bakst, prominent
international artist, the Indians pro
duce the finest real handicraft in
America, and their designs are among
the world's finest motifs.
A sandpainting similar to those
shown at the Star ford Art Gallery
last April when five Navajo Indians
exhibited their handiwork there has
been made for the Museum by one of
ihe ndians. It has been placed in the
Early American room upstairs.
The making and destroying of sand
paintings, along with weaving and
pottery work, dates back to prehis
toric times. It is not a commercial
art, however, but is connected with
healing ceremonies, initiations, and
religious festivals, especially sun
worship. The Indian is extremely re
ligious and every act in his daily life
is expressed with the deepest sin
cerity.
Sun Is God
He believes the sun is the mother
of all living things and at break of
dawn greets her with a chant of
thanksgiving and asks for protection
and guidance throughout the day. An
appointed official, who has served a
long apprenticeship to fit him for his
task, "paints" a sacred picture in the
sand. This is done by superimposing
colored sand, obtained by pulverizing
white, yellow, and red rock, upon an
area of sand that has been smoothed
over to make an even surface. Grey
is obtained by mixing white sand and
black charcoal. One of the tenets of
Indian philosophy is that everything
that is created is destroyed, so, as a
symbol of this belief, the sandpaint
ing is destroyed at sundown.
Dance Expresses Mystery
Among other Indian ceremonials
are those to prove endurance and
ability to withstand pain, and those
having to do with planting of crops,
rain, harvesting, corn grinding, fish
ing, hunting, and thanksgiving. The
Indian expresses his sense of the

great mystery of all things through
the dance, there being a special one
for almost every occasion. He per
sonifies the mountains, trees, and
rivers, and worships. Living so close
to nature, his livelihood dependent
upon her bounty, he worships Nature,
or the Great Spirit. The expression
of his devotion takes an unusually
picturesque form.
According to Leon Bakst, prominent
international artist, the Indians pro
duce the finest real handicraft in
America, and their designs are among
the world's finest motifs.
