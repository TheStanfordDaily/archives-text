# LOCAL COP BOWLED INTO HORSE TROUGH BY BAWLING BOVINE
## 
### 
Automobiles are almost safe,
but cows . John Olsen, cam
pus traffic officer, today refused
to comment on the matter. Yes
terday while the bright sun was
shining, Fred Frehe, foreman of
outside property, and Officer Ol
sen took a little ride out back of
the campus.
Rounding a corner a strange
sight confronted our heroes.
None other than one of the bo
vine tenants of the campus had
her head caught in a watering
trough.
Quick to be of assistance,
Frehe and Officer Olsen stopped
their car and helped the animal
out of her rather uncomfortable
position.
Maybe it was the shiny but
tons on Officer Olsen's coat,
maybe it was just the mean dis
position of the cow, but would
you believe it she did nothing
else but take after her rescuers!
Frehe managed to sidestep, but
Officer Olsen in his attempt to
get out of the way backed up,
and right there he made his big
mistake. The watering trough
was right behind him! One big
splash and it was all over—all
over Officer Olsen.
