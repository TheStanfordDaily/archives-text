# OBSERVATORY TO BE VISITED IN NEXT TOUR
## Trip Will Give Oportunity To View Sky Through Great Telescope Will Leave Main Entrance of Union at 4 O'clock; To Return at Midnight 
### 
The Lick Observatory of the Uni
versity of California, located on Mount
Hamilton, is the point of interest for
the weekly excursion Saturday, which
will leave Stanford Union main en
trance at 4 o'clock and return about
midnight.
The observatory is due east from
San Jose, thirteen miles in a straight
line, and twenty-seven miles by stage
road.
The height of the marble floor of
the main building is 4209 feet above
mean sea-level. This allows distant
views of San Francisco Bay, Mount
Tamalpais, Mount Diablo, Half Dome,
Yosemite, and Santa Clara Valley.
The visitors will be admitted to
look through the great tclescope,
which has a magnifying power from
about 270 to 3000. The movable floor
in the seventy-five foot dome where
this telescope is located is the first
of its kind to be constructed and can
be raised or lowered through a dis
tance of sixteen and one-half feet to
bring the observer within convenient
reach of the eye end of the telescope.
Last year about eighty-five people
made this trip so reservations should
be made early Thursday in the office
of the Director of the Summer Quar
ter, room 173, Administration bulid- j
ing. The fare is $3.50.
