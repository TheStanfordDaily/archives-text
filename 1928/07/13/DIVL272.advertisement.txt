Protection
Unless wise precautions are taken to protect valuable papers and
other prized articles from fire and theft, there is always the possibility
that they will be destroyed or stolen. A small annual investment in
an American Trust Company safe deposit box will pay for itself many
times over in the freedom that it offers from worry. The smallest box,
which may be rented at trifling cost, will protect property worth many
thousands of dollars. American Trust Company safe deposit vaults
are fire-proof and thief-proof.
