Resists Corrosion
THIS picture, taken in the salt marshes near
Kearny, N. J., shows two lines of 30' inch Cast
Iron Pipe replacing pipe made of other material.
The alternate exposure to the action of salt water
and air is a severe test.
While the pipe shown in the picture is subjected to
unusual corrosive influences, all underground pipe
must be able to withstand corrosion to a greater or
less degree. Cast Iron Pipe has this quality. It does
not depend on its coating to resist rust; the material
itself is rust-resisting. The first Cast Iron Pipe ever
laid is in service today at Versailles, France, after
two hundred and sixty years' service.
