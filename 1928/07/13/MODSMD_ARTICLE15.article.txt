# CARD ATHLETES, COACHES BOUND FOR OLYMPICS
## Templeton, Brandsten Go As Coaches; One Stanford Girl on Team Nichols Makes Trip As Aide To McArthur, President Of Committee 
### 
Seven members of various Card
athletic teams, accompanied by
Coaches Dink Templeton and Ernie
Brandsten, sailed Wednesday from
New York aboard the S.S. President
Roosevelt bound for Amsterdam, as
.part of the greatest aggregation of
stars ever to represent this country
in the Olympic Games. The seven
making the trip to the land of the
windmills are: Marion Holley, as
member of the women's track team;
Captain Bud Spencer, Bob King, Har
low Rothert, Eric Krenz, as members
of the men's track team; Pete Des
jardins, in the diving events; and
Reggie Harrison, on the water polo
team. Coach Templeton will assist in
track, and Brandsten will have charge
of the diving.
After refusing to let Ross Nichols,
Card track captain-elect, make the
trip to Amsterdam although he had
tied the world's record in the semi
finals of his favorite event, the 110-
meter high hurdles, at the national
Olympic tryouts last Saturday, mem
bers of the U.S. Olympic Committee
have at last reconsidered the ques
tion. They have decided to let Nichols
go not as a competitor, but as an
aide to Major-General Mac Arthur,
president of the Committee.
Miss Holley first came to light as
a track star here at Stanford last
year when her ability to high jump
showed her as an Olympic possibility.
In the national tryouts held in New
ark, New Jersey, several weeks ago,
she tied for second place with a leap
of 4 feet 11 3-4 inches.
In speaking of high jumpers Bob
King must not be forgotten. Bob was
forced to jump approximately a foot
and a half higher than Miss Holley
in order to cinch a first place in the
national tryouts held for the men's
track team at Cambridge, Massachu
setts, last Saturday. He is doped to
take a first at the Games in this
event, but even if he fails to do this
he should be up among the leaders.
Harlow Rothert may be depended
on to come through with a place in
the sliotput, and Eric Krenz, although
kept out of his favorite event, the
discus throw, by a questionable deci
sion of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
may garner a few points in this event
if he's right when he reaches the Low
lands.

Captain Spencer, who will run in j
the American 1600-meter relay team,
will do his part in bringing home a
victory in this event. Spencer is one j
of the fastest 400-meter men in the
country, and although he failed to :
place in the finals of this event at i
Philadelphia, he will no doubt cover
his lap of the relay in record time at
the Games.
Pete Desjardins, diminutive Nation
al Junior Diving Champion, will meet
all comers in the Olympic diving
events. Although unusually small Pete
feels perfectly at home in big com
pany. He should make a strong bid
for first place.
The Cards' representative on the
U.S. water polo team will be Reggie
Harrison, also a member of the Stan
lord intercollegiate championship polo i
team. Reggie was the big star when
the Redshirts drubbed the best the
East had last spring.

The University of Texas recently
received checks totaling $146,505 for
oil royalties.

The national legislative body o
Poland is called the Sejm.
