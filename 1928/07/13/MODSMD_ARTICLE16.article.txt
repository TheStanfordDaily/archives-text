# VASCONCELOS FINISHES SERIES OF LECTURES ON SPANISH-AMERICA
## Former Head of Department Of Education in Mexico Scores Obregon 
### 
Dr. Jose Yasconcelos, former head
of the Department of Education of
Mexico, who has just completed a
series of lectures at Stanford in both
English and Spanish, leaves shortly
for Seattle where he will deliver lec
tures at the University of Washing
ton. He will spend the remainder of
the summer in lecturing at universi
ties in Texas, Kansas, and other
states.
Yesterday Doctor Vasconcelos gave
two lectures, morning and afternoon,
to complete the series he has been
delivering during the week at the
Little Theatre. At the morning lec
ture he reviewed the current of
thought of the recent writers and po
litical leaders of Latin American
countries. During the afternoon lec
ture he devoted his talk to Boliva and
the revival of Latin Americanism.
Native of Mexico
Doctor Vasconcelos is a native of
the City of Mexico, being a graduate
of the University of Mexico. He is
the author of several works on the
subject of education and sociology.
His rise to the head of the Depart
ment of Education of Mexico was
rapid and brilliant, marked by an in
sistence on honesty in the Depart
ment. His intolerance of dishonesty
was eventually the reason that he
resigned his position. Graft had be
come so prevalent that any curbing
of it was distasteful to those in
power. He has been away from his
native country for the last four years,
which have been spent in lecturing in
the various capitals of Europe and
America.
Doctor Vasconcelos says he has no
sympathy with the recent election in
Mexico. Most of the intellectual peo
ple of Mexico have no confidence in
the present government, nor in Presi
dent Obregon. Obregon represents the
army that has crushed Mexico, and
no relief is apparent in his election.
In Throes of Change
The South American countries,
Doctor Vasconcelos says, are in the
throes of a changing civilization, and
in the case of Mexico the revolution
has taken the country back to the
place it started from. The economic,
industrial, and civic misgovernment
of the national resources has discour
aged the people, destroyed the
church, and crippled the education of
the nation.
Opposed to this program of mis
management of Mexico the story of
Brazil and Argentine show the power
of a constructive policy. From the
same aboriginal people these coun
tries have added to what they origi
nally were by immigration and capi
tal from Europe, and have grown
from insignificant countries to power
ful and prosperous nations.
Population on Decrease
Mexico, says Doctor Vasconcelos, is
one of the few countries today that is
driving out its inhabitants. The popu
lation has decreased during the last

two decades from fifteen to twelve
million. The people are frantically
seeking refuge in the United States
and other countries where property is
secure and life safe.

of it was distasteful to those in
power. He has been away from his
native country for the last four years,
which have been spent in lecturing in
the various capitals of Europe and
America.
Doctor Vasconcelos says he has no
sympathy with the recent election in
Mexico. Most of the intellectual peo
ple of Mexico have no confidence in
the present government, nor in Presi
dent Obregon. Obregon represents the
army that has crushed Mexico, and
no relief is apparent in his election.
In Throes of Change
The South American countries,
Doctor Vasconcelos says, are in the
throes of a changing civilization, and
in the case of Mexico the revolution
has taken the country back to the
place it started from. The economic,
industrial, and civic misgovernment
of the national resources has discour
aged the people, destroyed the
church, and crippled the education of
the nation.
Opposed to this program of mis
management of Mexico the story of
Brazil and Argentine show the power
of a constructive policy. From the
same aboriginal people these coun
tries have added to what they origi
nally were by immigration and capi
tal from Europe, and have grown
from insignificant countries to power
ful and prosperous nations.
Population on Decrease
Mexico, says Doctor Vasconcelos, is
one of the few countries today that is
driving out its inhabitants. The popu
lation has decreased during the last

two decades from fifteen to twelve
million. The people are frantically
seeking refuge in the United States
and other countries where property is
secure and life safe.
Dr. Jose Yasconcelos, former head
of the Department of Education of
Mexico, who has just completed a
series of lectures at Stanford in both
English and Spanish, leaves shortly
for Seattle where he will deliver lec
tures at the University of Washing
ton. He will spend the remainder of
the summer in lecturing at universi
ties in Texas, Kansas, and other
states.
Yesterday Doctor Vasconcelos gave
two lectures, morning and afternoon,
to complete the series he has been
delivering during the week at the
Little Theatre. At the morning lec
ture he reviewed the current of
thought of the recent writers and po
litical leaders of Latin American
countries. During the afternoon lec
ture he devoted his talk to Boliva and
the revival of Latin Americanism.
Native of Mexico
Doctor Vasconcelos is a native of
the City of Mexico, being a graduate
of the University of Mexico. He is
the author of several works on the
subject of education and sociology.
His rise to the head of the Depart
ment of Education of Mexico was
rapid and brilliant, marked by an in
sistence on honesty in the Depart
ment. His intolerance of dishonesty
was eventually the reason that he
resigned his position. Graft had be
come so prevalent that any curbing
of it was distasteful to those in
power. He has been away from his
native country for the last four years,
