A letter in the Campus Opinion column today bemoans the fact
that tennis courts, the gymnasium, and the swimming pool are closed
at 12 o'clock on Sundays, and asks a reason for this situation, and
also a remedy.
The varsity tennis courts are locked at 12 o'clock because a large
number of the people who use them do not comply with the regula
tions. This is harmful to the courts, which are rather expensive to
repair. It would be necessary to hire a man to enforce these regula
tions and many of these courts are used by people who are not
students. However there are approximately ten other courts which
are not locked, and students can use them at any hour.
University authorities do not feel that there is enough demand to
justify keeping the gymnasium open Sunday afternoons. It hap
pens to be just as expensive to keep it open for five people as for fifty.
It is impossible to keep the swimming pool open because Sunday
is the only day which it can be cleaned without conflicting with
classes. It is possible to swim in Searsville Lake, a short distance
from here.
