# Officials' Folly
## 
### 
Ross Nichols, captain-elect of the Stanford track team, will go
to Amsterdam as an aide to Major-General Mac Arthur, president of
the American Olympic committee. We congratulate Nick on secur
ing the trip but we know that this is not the way in which he would
have liked to go, or in which any of us would have liked to see
him go.
It does seem a shame that such an outstanding athlete as Nichols
will not be allowed to compete for the American team at Amsterdam
when his failure to qualify was admittedly the fault of the meet
officials. After equalling the world's record in a preliminary heat
Nichols was disqualified in the finals by tripping over a hurdle which
the judges admit was misplaced. But they refused to give Nichols
anything but sympathy for their error.
Now, by taking Nichols along as an aide, they are again admitting
their error and are again showing the folly of a system whereby an
official's error can disqualify an athlete from the position he deserves.
The loss is America's. The fault is the officials.'
