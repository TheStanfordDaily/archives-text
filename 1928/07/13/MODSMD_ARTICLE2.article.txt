# SPECIAL RATES STILL IN FORCE FOR SUNDAY SYMPHONY CONCERTS
## Molinari to Lead Orchestra For Second Time in Coming Program 
### 
Director Sellards* office announces
that tickets for the Sunday Sympho
nies are still available at reduced
rates to students and faculty of the
Summer Quarter. Separate tickets are
fifty cents, and books of eight may be
had for four dollars. Although there
are only five more concerts any num
ber of the tickets in the book may be
used at any one concert.
The program which Maestro Ber
nardino Molinari has arranged for his
second appearance in the Woodland
Theatre at Hillsborough next Sunday
afternoon promises a rare treat for
those who journey to the sylvan set
ting of the open air theatre.
Molinari achieved an instant suc

audience greeted this distinguished
Roman conductor from the Augusteo,
on the occasion of his debut in Cali
fornia. The enthusiastic salvos of ap
plause that followed each number
were an eloquent tribute to the
artistry of this second guest conduc
tor in the summer concert series.
Aside from the second Symphony
in D major of Brahms, which is ever
a favorite with patrons of symphony
concerts, unusual interest is centered
in two of the numbers scheduled for
Sunday's program because they have
been transcribed for full orchestra by
the conductor, Molinari, himself.
The orchestration of Debussy's
"L'lsle Joyeuse," which was originally
written as a piano piece, was under
taken by Molinari following a sugges
tion from, and with the permission
of, the composer, and when intro
duced last season by Molinari at his
New York concerts, was the subject
of much laudatory comment.
The opening number of the pro
gram, preceding the symphony, will
be another of Molinari's arrange
ments, a composition by Geminiani,
an eminent Italian violinist and com
poser of the seventeenth century who
was a pupil of Corelli and Scarlatti.
Geminiani was not only a most tal
ented artist and composer, but author
as well of several treatises on the art
