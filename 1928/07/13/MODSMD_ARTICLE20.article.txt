Lagnuita received the blame for the superabundance of gnats or
mosquitoes on the campus in a Campus Opinion in the last issue of
the Daily. In fact '29 and '30, who sent in the viewpoint, said it was
as obvious as it was preventable that Lagunita was the cause.
We learn that they are wrong and Lagunita is all right. Stanford
is in a mosquito abatement district, and an inspector visits Lagunita
twice a week to make sure that its fair waters are not a breeding place
for annoying insects.
We also learned that there are fewer gnats on the campus than
last year, if that is any consolation to '29 and '30.
The lake is not drained immediately after the spring season
because the water is used for irrigation purposes. It will be com
pletely empty in about two weeks.
