# Make Checks Payable
## 
### 
Syllabus fees will be out today and must be paid by next Tues
day. After that time a fine of $2 will be levied. There is no reason
why any students should have to pay this fine, as the money must be
paid, and why not on time?
But there will be some who will have to fork over the $2 because
they were careless and forgot to send in the money. The Registrar's
office says that it is only a small group that pays these fines, but that
this small group is responsible for nearly all of the fines collected
for being late and for other troubles arising from carelessness.
These people will learn some day that they will lose more than $2
by being tardy. Why not learn to be on time now?
