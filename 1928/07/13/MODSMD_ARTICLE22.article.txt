Dear Editor:
Last Sunday, having completed only
a set and a half of tennis, we were
asked to leave as the courts closed
at 12 o'clock. Mr. Editor, why is this?
On Sunday afternoon, of all after
noons, the courts close at 12 o'clock.
Can't you find some remedy for this,
especially during the summer quar
ter?
Then we went to the gym to have
a shower and a swim. Again we were
disappointed. The pool was closed for
the day. A beautiful morning and
afternoon gone to . Can't some
thing be done about our recreation
on Sunday? If a remedy can't be
found, please tell us where we can
go, on Sunday, to find a nice swim
ming tank and a couple of tennis
courts— Anonymous.

The Editor, Sir:
For the benefit of the people who
did not see "The Queen's Husband,"
and a whole lot of us who would like
to see it again, I rise to remark that
it ought to be repeated. After read
ing the splendid criticisms in all the
papers, and after hearing the lucky
ones brag about how good it was,
those who did not see it are just
"r'arin' to go" and I have no doubt
there would be as good a house for
the second presentation as for the
first, if it were advertised. It seems
a pity to go to so much labor and
expense for only one presentation,
and especially as so many want an
other chance. Wouldn't this, which
was such a success, be the proper
one to try it out? Let's Go! —M.S.T.
