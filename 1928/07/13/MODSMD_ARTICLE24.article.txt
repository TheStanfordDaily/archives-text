"The Son," by Hildur Dixelius, trans
lated by Anna C. Settergren.
(New York: E. P. Dutton & Co.,
1928.)
"The Son," by Hildur Dixelius, is a
story of a family in the barren vi
carages and villages of Sweden a
hundred years ago. Anna's translation
might have withered the freshness of
the story, or perhaps Hildur's tale
was an obtuse production; something
is lacking, for the work is damned by
a vapid sameness which accentuates
the necessary pictorial montony.
There is an unfortunate synchroniz
ing of subject tone of structural style
and literary treatment. The mass im
pression which I gained was one of
stolid flatness aiming to portray real
ity, and stooping to the bovine to be
sure to attain the result.
The story deals with a society that
takes its religion seriously. What a
bore such people are. The ox-like
faith, the earthly ambitions, and the
bigoted attitudes are prompted by the
impetus of a mean soul —a soul that
is so tightly wrapped in narrowness
that life becomes petty even in love
and death. Murder, the consummate
in passionate gestures, carries the
stigma of being meager. One line
drags its detailed way after another,
drumming out a merry tune compar
able to that made by clods falling on
a casket —a dreary, dreary style.
It would take either a crystal gazer
or an engineer to unravel the plot
from the entangling sub-plots. To

infer that it even has a definite plot
is making a concession, but I don't
believe that the author would have
the conceit to write the thing for the
auditory effect of the words. If she
follows any rules of plot construction,
then she made them herself. A maslin
of broken, disconnected situations —
merely that.
The book is saved from being an
utter "washout" by one feature, and
that is found in its portrayals of char
acter and human nature, even though
it is distorted and exaggerated—this
shows a keen study by a critical mind.
There is an unconscious strain of
cynical and bitter insight; it is
blurred by the tone of mild resigna
tion, but basically it is either the ob
servations of a petty mind, or the con
temptuous recognition of a detail-con
scious one. This virtue is neither
charming nor interesting, yet it is a
virtue —it is surprising that it can
exist in solitary confinement.
The book suffers from an extreme
case of "toomanyism." There are too
many generations dealt with, there
are too many characters, too many
plots, and the cardinal sin is that
there are too many pages.
If you are not interested in the pro
vincial Swedish proletariat of a hun
dred years ago, don't read "The Son";
if you are don't read it anyway. Parts
of it may be fine in Swedish, but of
course I read the translation; when
read in English—well, it is "just one
of those things."—Laird Doyle.

the conceit to write the thing for the
auditory effect of the words. If she
follows any rules of plot construction,
then she made them herself. A maslin
of broken, disconnected situations —
merely that.
The book is saved from being an
utter "washout" by one feature, and
that is found in its portrayals of char
acter and human nature, even though
it is distorted and exaggerated—this
shows a keen study by a critical mind.
There is an unconscious strain of
cynical and bitter insight; it is
blurred by the tone of mild resigna
tion, but basically it is either the ob
servations of a petty mind, or the con
temptuous recognition of a detail-con
scious one. This virtue is neither
charming nor interesting, yet it is a
virtue —it is surprising that it can
exist in solitary confinement.
The book suffers from an extreme
case of "toomanyism." There are too
many generations dealt with, there
are too many characters, too many
plots, and the cardinal sin is that
there are too many pages.
If you are not interested in the pro
vincial Swedish proletariat of a hun
dred years ago, don't read "The Son";
if you are don't read it anyway. Parts
of it may be fine in Swedish, but of

read in English—well, it is "just one
of those things."—Laird Doyle.
"The Son," by Hildur Dixelius, trans
lated by Anna C. Settergren.
(New York: E. P. Dutton & Co.,
1928.)
"The Son," by Hildur Dixelius, is a
story of a family in the barren vi
carages and villages of Sweden a
hundred years ago. Anna's translation
might have withered the freshness of
the story, or perhaps Hildur's tale
was an obtuse production; something
is lacking, for the work is damned by
a vapid sameness which accentuates
the necessary pictorial montony.
There is an unfortunate synchroniz
ing of subject tone of structural style
and literary treatment. The mass im
pression which I gained was one of
stolid flatness aiming to portray real
ity, and stooping to the bovine to be
sure to attain the result.
The story deals with a society that
takes its religion seriously. What a
bore such people are. The ox-like
faith, the earthly ambitions, and the
bigoted attitudes are prompted by the
impetus of a mean soul —a soul that
is so tightly wrapped in narrowness
that life becomes petty even in love
and death. Murder, the consummate
in passionate gestures, carries the
stigma of being meager. One line
drags its detailed way after another,
drumming out a merry tune compar
able to that made by clods falling on
a casket —a dreary, dreary style.
It would take either a crystal gazer
or an engineer to unravel the plot
from the entangling sub-plots. To

infer that it even has a definite plot
is making a concession, but I don't
believe that the author would have
the conceit to write the thing for the
auditory effect of the words. If she
follows any rules of plot construction,
then she made them herself. A maslin
of broken, disconnected situations —
