ALWAYS A GENTLEMAN
Thg boat carrying the American
Olympic Games teams is on its way
to Amsterdam, leaving a large number
of disappointed men and women who
expected to make the trip. Stanford
is well represented with two coaches
and seven athletes. Ross Nichols was
finally allowed to go as an aide to the
president of the Olympic Games Com
mittee, not as an athlete.
** * »
Stanford also has one man who
was offered the trip to Amsterdam
and refused it. This man was Harry
Maloney. But he was one of the fac
tors in helping Ross Nichols get
across the sea. The fact that he
turned down an offer as assistant
track manager added weight to Ma
loney's protest.
* * *
When Harry heard the judges' de
cision on Nichols, it somewhat
angered him because it was against
his idea of the spirit of amateur
sports. He immediately started send
ing telegrams to all of the men who
had any authority, including the presi
dent of the Olympic Games Commit
tee. There is no doubt that these tele
grams had some effect because Ma
loney is president of the Pacific Asso
ciation of the A.A.U.
♦ * *
We believe that it is what Harry
said that helped Nichols to make the
trip. He told the judges actual facts,
and did not call them crooks and tell
them they were robbing the West. He
merely said, "You can do what you
want, but if you keep Nichols off the
team, you are doing it in the face of
strong opposition."
These words undoubtedly had more
appeal to the judges than some of :
the others that they received calling
them fifteen different kinds of crooks.
It also took away the sour-grape idea,
and left the judges without a come
back. They were naturally defending
their decision against all comers be
cause it seems to be the thing to do.
+ + *
As a matter of fact they were forced
to. If they had let Nichols go therft
would immediately have been argu
ments about Several other men, ac
cording to Maloney. He has a copy
of a paper which presents a signed
affidavit of one judge which declares
that the hurdle in dispute was not
out of place.
* * *
All fn all things were and still are
in a bad mess, but Maloney believes
that Nichols will get a chance to run
when he gets across the sea. "Just
watch. He'll run when he gets over
there," were Harry's words.
* ♦ ♦
We have a feeling that Harry is not
well pleased with the way our so
called amateur sports are working
out. The theory sounds fine, but the
actual thing is terrible. We feel that
the men at the head of amateur sports
are doing it more harm than good.
After all the main reason for sports
is to develop the body. If at the same
time they develop a crooked mind,
more harm than good has been done.
♦ * *
Harry Maloney likes to win, be
cause he happens to be quite human,

and it is only human to want to win.
But first of all, Harry is a gentleman
and demands fair play and clean
sportsmanship. He would rather his
teams lose all of their contests than
violate the code of good sportsman
ship. He is the type of man that we
would like to see on the American
Olympic Games Committee, because
we know that he would do his best
to see that everyone got an abso
lutely square deal and would impress
the managers of foreign teams that
he is a gentleman. • —Jack Hodges.

expected to make the trip. Stanford
is well represented with two coaches
and seven athletes. Ross Nichols was
finally allowed to go as an aide to the
president of the Olympic Games Com
mittee, not as an athlete.
** * »
Stanford also has one man who
was offered the trip to Amsterdam
and refused it. This man was Harry
Maloney. But he was one of the fac
tors in helping Ross Nichols get
across the sea. The fact that he
turned down an offer as assistant
track manager added weight to Ma
loney's protest.
* * *
When Harry heard the judges' de
cision on Nichols, it somewhat
angered him because it was against
his idea of the spirit of amateur
sports. He immediately started send
ing telegrams to all of the men who
had any authority, including the presi
dent of the Olympic Games Commit
tee. There is no doubt that these tele
grams had some effect because Ma
loney is president of the Pacific Asso
ciation of the A.A.U.
♦ * *
We believe that it is what Harry
said that helped Nichols to make the
trip. He told the judges actual facts,
and did not call them crooks and tell
them they were robbing the West. He
merely said, "You can do what you
want, but if you keep Nichols off the
team, you are doing it in the face of
strong opposition."
These words undoubtedly had more
appeal to the judges than some of :
the others that they received calling
them fifteen different kinds of crooks.
It also took away the sour-grape idea,
and left the judges without a come
back. They were naturally defending
their decision against all comers be
cause it seems to be the thing to do.
+ + *
As a matter of fact they were forced
to. If they had let Nichols go therft
would immediately have been argu
ments about Several other men, ac
cording to Maloney. He has a copy
of a paper which presents a signed
affidavit of one judge which declares
that the hurdle in dispute was not
out of place.
* * *
All fn all things were and still are
in a bad mess, but Maloney believes
that Nichols will get a chance to run
when he gets across the sea. "Just
watch. He'll run when he gets over
there," were Harry's words.
* ♦ ♦
We have a feeling that Harry is not
well pleased with the way our so
called amateur sports are working
out. The theory sounds fine, but the
actual thing is terrible. We feel that
the men at the head of amateur sports
are doing it more harm than good.
After all the main reason for sports
is to develop the body. If at the same
time they develop a crooked mind,
more harm than good has been done.
♦ * *
Harry Maloney likes to win, be
cause he happens to be quite human,

and it is only human to want to win.
But first of all, Harry is a gentleman
and demands fair play and clean
sportsmanship. He would rather his
teams lose all of their contests than
violate the code of good sportsman
ship. He is the type of man that we
would like to see on the American
Olympic Games Committee, because
we know that he would do his best
to see that everyone got an abso
lutely square deal and would impress
the managers of foreign teams that
he is a gentleman. • —Jack Hodges.
