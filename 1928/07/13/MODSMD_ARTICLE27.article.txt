# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY CONTAINS INVALUABLE DOCUMENTARY MATTER
## Material Aid to Students of International Politics And World War 
### 
The Hoover War Library, on the
right of the entrance to the main floor
of the library, contains one of the
most complete collections of war
documents and materials to be found
in the world. These materials are in
valuable aids to any students of in
ternational politics and the World
War, and are of interest even to
those whose interests are less aca
demic.
Shortly after the signing of the
armistice in 1918 Herbert Hoover, at
that time food administrator, cabled
President Wilbur that fifty thousand
dollars was available for an historical
collection on the War if a suiLable
commission was at once organized and
sent to Paris to undertake the work.
Professor Ephraim D. Adams was se
lected for the task and went to Eu
rope to begin the collecting
Professor Adams was able to se
cure government documents for the
period of 1914 to 1919 from forty
seven European, American, and Asi
atic powers that were quick and anx
ious to respond. In 1922 the Italian
government sent over a ton of docu
ments from Rome to Stanford Uni
versity.
Important Documents Received
Important documents were received
from the enemy states of Germany,
Austria Hungary, Bulgaria, and Tur
key. At Paris Professor Adams se
cured practically all the propaganda
of the unrecognized states, such as
"Ukraine, Korea, Carpatho-Russia,
Fiume, and Azerbaidjan.
In the library are also the secret
publications of organizations which
were suppressed by the war govern
ments of Germany, Austria, France,
and Great Britain, as well as the files
of the principal newspapers and
periodicals published during the war
in the belligerent states and in the
neutral capitals.
Contains Rare Publications
Possibly the most interesting group
of documents to the casual observer
is the collection of picturesque and
rare publications of the war, such as
pamphlets dropped over the enemies'
lines, posters, placards, war curren
cies, war stamps, trench papers, army
orders, and forceful documents of of
ficial propaganda. Many of these are
displayed in the glass-topped cases in
the foyer of the library.
Professor Frank A. Golder has been (
in the Near East and Russia for the
last two years working on the Hoover j
collection. He recently forwarded a
very large collection of material that
he obtained in Russia, probably the
most extensive collection to leave
Russia since 1914 and the most com
prehensive study of Bolshevik arch
ives in existence.
The Hoover library is under the
direction of Professor Ralph H. Lutz
of the history department.
