# PENINSULAR POINTS

Closely allied to the Gate itself
jis the Golden Gate Park, a most
delightful place to drive leisurely
through, and a most terrible
maze in which to get lost. It is a
forest which has been cultivated by
man. Roads have been cut in every
direction, innumerable lakes are with
in its boundaries, and fancy gardens
are everywhere. There are statues,
the Japanese Tea Garden, band re
citals, and many other things of in
terest.

The old Barbary Coast on Pacific
Street near the Embarcadero, the
scene of last generation's sins and
lust, is now a stark desolation, a place
of old beer signs and padlocked doors.
It is a sad evidence of the ravaging
effects of prohibition and reform, and
might interest those who have a mor
bid taste for deserted cemeteries, and
spots made famous by horrible acci
dents.

No description or San rrancisco is
complete unless it contains a few
words about the Hotel St. Francis
lobby. When anybody ever wants to
meet anyone else in San Francisco
they always use the lobby of the St.
Francis as a meeting-place. Conse
quently a large portion of the popula
tion of the city passes through this
room during a normal day.

Telegraph Hill is the Artist Colony
of San Francisco. Crazy, ramshackle,
wooden buildings cover the top of
this peak, and in these buildings are
to be found innumerable cheap stu
dios, the living and working quarters
of several hundred embryo artists.
Here is the cultural center of San
Francisco; ideas emanate from this
place—at least that is what one of
the inhabitants was heard to say.

But this column is not run for the
glorification of only San Francisco, as
there are many points of interest out
side of the city limits. The summit of
Mt. Tamalpais, which is across the
bay in Marin county, is the destina
tion of many khaki-clothed hikers.
Tamalpais is the Indian word for "re
clining lady," and the mountain was
so called because it's top resembles
such a figure.
