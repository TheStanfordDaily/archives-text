The 400-meter hurdle event is one
of the most spectacular on the Olym
pic program, and it is also one of the
most gruelling to the contestants. It
is hard enough to run 437.45 yards,
alone, but add ten hurdles three feet
high every forty meters and you have
a race that taxes the runners' skill
and energy to the utmost. As there is
no 200-meter low-hurdle event on the
Olympic program, many low hurdlers
from the colleges and clubs of Amer
ica go into this quarter-mile event,
and this year it looks as if one of
them was going to make it exceeding
ly hard for the two best 400-meter
hurdlers in America.
Frank Cubel, of the University of
lowa, won the National Collegiate 220-
yard low hurdles in 23 2-5 seconds,
remarkably fast time, and on June 23
at lowa City set a new world's record

of 53 2-5 seconds for the 400-meter
three-foot hurdle event. That broke
the new record set by Johnny Gibson,
formerly of Fordham University, by
one-fifth of a second. Gibson, in de
feating F. Morgan Taylor, of the Illi
nois Athletic Club, at Nebraska last
July to win the national champion
ship, ran the 440-yard hur'dles in
52 3-5 seconds, and, as this is two and
one-half yards more than 400 meters,
it is likely that Johnny will get credit
for both records.
Taylor is the present Olympic
champion, succeeding Frank Loomis,
of Chicago, who won in 1920. Taylor
was national champion in 1924, 1925,
and 1926, and only lost by a foot in
1927.

The bone commonly called the
knee-cap is known as the patella.
