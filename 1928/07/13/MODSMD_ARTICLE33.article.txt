# Southern Pacific Station Given New Coat Of Paint
## 
### 
A surprising sight will greet the old
Btudents who return in the fall when
they alight from their trains in Palo
Alto. It is the new coat of paint now
being applied to the depot by the able
staff of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. At present the station is of a
different color from that which one
has been used to seeing. It is not
certain, however, whether the present
color is to remain the permanent one.
In any case, nothing adds as much as
a coat of paint.
