# SHAKESPEARE IS TEXT OF WEDNESDAY TALK GIVEN BY FEUILLERAT
## Great Dramatist Was First a Poet; Gained Favor in Literary Circles 
### 
"We are prone to neglect Shake
speare the Poet, for Shakespeare the
Dramatist," said Dr. Feuillerat in his
first lecture on Wednesday. "This ten
dency may be natural, but in life
Shakespeare developed first as a poet
and then as a dramatist . A combina
tion of circumstances brought this
about."
August 1592 saw London life para
lyzed by the plague and Shakespeare
with others of the stage were forced
to leave London. Faced with the prac
tical problem of securing a patron
whose position and power would en
able him to become an established
member of court literary circles and
the salons, Shakespeare, in the spring
of 1593, wrote the poem known as
"Venus and Adonis." This poem es
tablished its writer in high favor with
certain influential groups comprising
court society and it was hailed with
wide approval by the critics.
"The literary England of Shake
speare's time was dominated by ro
mance, fantastic exaggeration, and an
overloaded artificial style. The court
of gallants set the canons of taste,
and worldly and material views domi
nated the public mind," said Dr. Feuil
lerat.
"The Rape of Lucrece," which fol
lowed "Venus and Adonis" at a later
date, shows Shakespeare well secured
in his position in court circles. The
poem borrows easily and without
stint from the terms of falconry, her
aldry, music, and the art of war.
Shakespeare is at home in the new
environment, the mind and the lan
guage of the nobility are his to use;
he is not the young, unsophisticated
poet of Avon, but a more cynical and
worldly man conversant with court
life and human vanities. Lucrece is
a finer piece of work than Venus and
Adonis for it carries a deeper philo
sophy, it is haunted with the melan
choly shadow of human wickedness,
it inveighs against lust and wrong
doing, and foretells retribution as the
natural consequence of sin, in the
opinion of Dr. Feuuerat.
Shakespeare's sonnets will be the
subject of Dr. Feuillerat's next lec
ture, which will be given next Wed
nesday.
