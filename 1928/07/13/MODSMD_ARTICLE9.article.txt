# DAVIS GIVES OUT LEAD CAST OF NEXT PLAY
## Julia North, Lucie Bentley Have Important Roles In Russian Play 
### 
Gordon Davis has made his selec
tions for the leads of "The Chief
Thing," the exotic Russian play by
Nicholas Evreinoff, to be presented in
the Assembly Hall July 27. The minor
parts, of which there are many, are
still under advisement.
Julia North, well-known campus
actress and opera star, has been given
the feminine lead; she is to play the
part of the Stenographer, a vapid
creature who blooms into a radiant
beauty under the influence of love.
Asa Douglas has been cast as the
Lover. Lucie Bentley, who played the
lead in the last Pendragon production,
"The Bad Man," and who has been
playing on the Stanford stage for sev
eral years, is to play the part of the
Dancer. To David Dahl has fallen the
part of Paraclete. This character will
call for an interesting interpretation
of an exaggerated character. Holmes
Stewart is cast for the Comedian.
The designs for the sets show that
they will be of true Russian character
and will merge into the realm of im
pressionism. The interior of a cheap
Russian theatre will be reproduced in
one set by the use of entirely bizarre
detailed impressionism. Helvenston
plans to build the furniture to con
form to true Russian type. The cos
tuming will range from the cheap
dress of the Russian actor on stage to
the exact character of typical cloth
ing.
"The Chief Thing" is a play full of
riotous, ribald comedy, but it is filled
with the melancholy philosophy of a
true Russian nature. A cheap troupe
of actors moves into a shoddy board
ing house which is filled with odd
people, all of whom are unhappy. By
the dint of their art, the actors take
these people and give them happiness.
The sardonic irony of the play lies in
the fact that all the happiness is
based on acting. The numerous char
acters give the production a desired
hysterical tone.
Gordon Davis, by bringing this play
to Stanford, will introduce the most
unusual presentation ever given here.
It is exotic throughout; the charac
ters are unique, the plot is grotesque,
the settings are ultra-Russian, the
whole play has a Cliauvre Sorie flavor.

people, all of whom are unhappy. By
the dint of their art, the actors take
these people and give them happiness.
The sardonic irony of the play lies in
the fact that all the happiness is
based on acting. The numerous char
acters give the production a desired
hysterical tone.
Gordon Davis, by bringing this play
to Stanford, will introduce the most
unusual presentation ever given here.
It is exotic throughout; the charac
ters are unique, the plot is grotesque,
the settings are ultra-Russian, the
whole play has a Cliauvre Sorie flavor.
Gordon Davis has made his selec
tions for the leads of "The Chief
Thing," the exotic Russian play by
Nicholas Evreinoff, to be presented in
the Assembly Hall July 27. The minor
parts, of which there are many, are
still under advisement.
Julia North, well-known campus
actress and opera star, has been given
the feminine lead; she is to play the
part of the Stenographer, a vapid
creature who blooms into a radiant
beauty under the influence of love.
Asa Douglas has been cast as the
Lover. Lucie Bentley, who played the
lead in the last Pendragon production,
"The Bad Man," and who has been
playing on the Stanford stage for sev
eral years, is to play the part of the
Dancer. To David Dahl has fallen the
part of Paraclete. This character will
call for an interesting interpretation
of an exaggerated character. Holmes
Stewart is cast for the Comedian.
The designs for the sets show that
they will be of true Russian character
and will merge into the realm of im
pressionism. The interior of a cheap
Russian theatre will be reproduced in
one set by the use of entirely bizarre
detailed impressionism. Helvenston
plans to build the furniture to con
form to true Russian type. The cos
tuming will range from the cheap
dress of the Russian actor on stage to
the exact character of typical cloth
ing.
"The Chief Thing" is a play full of
riotous, ribald comedy, but it is filled
with the melancholy philosophy of a
true Russian nature. A cheap troupe
of actors moves into a shoddy board
ing house which is filled with odd
people, all of whom are unhappy. By
the dint of their art, the actors take
these people and give them happiness.
