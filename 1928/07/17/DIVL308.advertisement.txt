a fine ink channel ground between the
prongs of the point (bringing capillary at
traction to the aid of gravity feed) is great
est writing improvement in years.
And Permanite, while Non-Breakable,
makes Duofolds 28% lighter in weight than
when made with rubber as formerly.
Why do most college students use it?
—try it yourself and know.
