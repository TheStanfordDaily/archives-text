# Molinari Pleases Audience With Sunday Concert at Hillsborough
## 
### Horace Bristol 
It was a gracious, if unconscious
icompliment to his audience, and to
the Woodland Theatre itself that
Molinari chose "The
Pines of Rome" as the concluding
[orchestration of the Sunday afternoon
i symphony concert at Hillsborough.
Ambassador of music from the Rome
Augusteo, his reading of Respighi's
tone poem, given under the canopy
,of California oaks and redwoods
linked the spirit of classic Rome to
present audience with harmonious
diplomacy.
Molinari's program was distinctly
Italian in flavor, opening with "An
dante Cantible" for strings and organ.
This colorful composition of the old
Italian school by Gemniani, a com
poser of the early eighteenth century,
was contrasted sharply with the clos
nig number, "The Pines of Rome."
The latter modern selection was writ
ten by Ottorino Respighi, who is a

close friend of Molinari, having writ
ten several compositions which had
their premier performances under his
direction.
The Brahms Second Symphony,
most popular work of this composer,
Moussorgsky's "Chovantchina," and
"L'lsle Joyeuse" by Debussy complet
ed the program for the afternoon.
Old-fashioned in comparison with
the modern style of Debussy and
Resphigi, the Second Symphony de
lighted with its mellowness of old
age. Molinari, who will be heard again
at Hillsborough next Sunday, offered
a Brahms of melody and power, as
well as an interpretation that was uni
formly excellent throughout the con
cert.
Sunday will be the fifth Symphony
of the summer series. It will be Moli
nari's third and last, appearance at
Hillsborough. Because of his ever
increasing popularity a large audi
ence is expected.
