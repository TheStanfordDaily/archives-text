# MODERN SELECTIONS WILL BE FEATURE OF ORGAN RECITAL TODAY
## 
### 
Three numbers: "The Fisherman
and the Genie," "Julamar of the Sea,"
and "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,"
have been selected from a new com
position, "Tales from the Arabian
Nights," by R. S. Stoughton as the
opening numbers of today's organ re
cital which will be played by Warren
D. Allen, University organist, at 4:15
o'clock in the Memorial Church.
Stoughton, an organist and business
man in Worchester, Mass., is a mod
ernist in composition and has written
many pieces of oriental color.
Alexander Scriabine, whose works
for piano and orchestra are among
the most notable contributions to
modern music, is represented on this
program by the colorful and "Chopin
esque" "Prelude in G Flat" which
was arranged for the organ by Harold
V. Milligan.
The first of two numbers by Men
delssohn to be played by Mr. Allen
is the Andante from the "Italian
Symphony." This whole symphony
was the result of his visit to Italy
in 1830-31, and is called Italian more
for its general character than its use
of local material. This Andante is
known in England as the "Song of
the Pilgrims." The second number of
Mendelssohn will be Nocturne from
"A Midsummer Night's Dream," the
immortal incidental music to Shake
speare's great comedy-drama.
The final number will be the March
from Wagner's "Die Meistersingers."
The recital to be given next Thurs
day afternoon and Sunday evening
will include "Vesper Processional" by
Harvey B. Gaul; and "Harmonies du
soir" by Karg-Elert, a modern com
poser. "Sea Surge" and "Sea Plaint,"
two selections from Nesbitt's "From
Hebrid Seas," will also be played; as
also the "Praeludium in F," by Armas
Jarnefelt, the eminent Finnish com
poser.
The program ends after the playing
of two numbers: Andante from the
"Gothic Symphony," and the Pontifi
cal March from the "First Symphony,"
both by C. M. Widor.
