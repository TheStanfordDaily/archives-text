# ROBLE CLUB TO GIVE DANCE ON WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
Roble Club will give a 7 to 8 o'clock
dance Wednesday evening on the
deck of the second floor. The affair
is strictly invitational but members
of the club are allowed to ask guests.
The deck is an awning-covered bal
cony projecting from the lobby of the
second floor of Roble Hall. A bevy of
lanterns will transform the platform
into a veritable fairyland.
George Tockabury's five-piece or
chestra will furnish music for the in
formal dance. Bridge tables will be
set up in the lobby at 8 o'clock so
that those who care to may play
bridue after the dance.
