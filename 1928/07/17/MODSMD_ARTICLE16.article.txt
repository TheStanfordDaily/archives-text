# DAVIS ANNOUNCES CHANGES IN CAST OF "THE CHIEF THING"
## Lloyd Nolan Chosen To Play Male Lead; Other Parts Will Be Changed Helvenston Will Construct Sets in Keeping With Air of Production 
### 
Gordon Davis announced today that
there would be changes in the cast
of "The Chief Thing." Lloyd Nolau,
who has just finished playing in the
professional production of "The
Queen's Husband" in Hollywood as
Laker, is to take the male lead.
Paraclete. Nolan has played with the
Pasadena Players for several seasons
and was prominent in Stanford dra
matics while attending here. His big
best Stanford success was in the
campus production of "The Green
Goddess." Nolan is leaving for the
East to take part in a Broadway pro
duction after the presentation of "The
Chief Thing." Nolan will take the
place of David Dahl, who is unable to
participate in the production.
Donald Cluxton is to play the part
of the Lover while Asa Douglas, who
was originally cast in this part, is
now playing the Student. Cluxton is
remembered for his work in the Foot
ball Show of 1925 and also for his act
ing on other amateur stages. Cluxton
is a member of the National Collegi
ate Players Society, an honorary dra
matic society of which Gordon Davis
is also a member. Cluxton is an ac
complished actor and is perfectly at
home behind the footlights.
Carol Wynn has been selected to
play the part of Lucian. Wynn carried
the lead in the last Opera to be pre
sented on the campus, and has been
noticed by those interested in dra
matics for some time.
The play has a strong and experi
enced cast. Julia North, Lloyd Nolan,
Donald Cluxton, and Lucie Bentley
are expected to furnish a firm founda
tion for "The Chief Thing." Virginia
Volland and Virginia Greene are to
make their first bow before a campus
audience, but despite their inexperi
ence they give promise of doing an
unusual bit of acting.
The rehearsals for the play have
been progressing with exceptional
speed and give indications of a fin
ished production. Gordon Davis has
done remarkably good work in mould
ing such a large cast into shape in
such a short while.
Helvenston is in the process of
building the most startling sets ever
to be used on the Stanford stage. The
eccentric sets are in harmony with
the bizarre play, and the combination
of the two should produce a fasci
nating result. It is a modernistic play
cast in an impressionistic setting. Hel
venston plans to introduce an expres
sionist set within a permanent set;
he believes that not only will this
have the desired result, but will facili
tate the shifting of scenes to such a
point that a minute's wait is all that
will be needed.

The "pants burglar" in England,
who steals his victim's trousers to
discourage pursuit, is believed to have
gotten his idea from the United
States.
