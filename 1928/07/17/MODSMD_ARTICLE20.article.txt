# Avoid Carelessness
## 
### 
Although the Stanford Fire Department has taken every reason
able precaution to prevent fires this year, the week-end brought two
grass fires on the Portola road behind the campus. Both of these
fires were evidently caused by carelessness on the part of people
passing in automobiles.
Every person knows, or should know, the inherent fire possibili
ties in a burning match or cigarette, and every person knows, or
should know, that dry grass is excellent tinder. Requests and warn
ings have been issued repeatedly since the beginning of the dry sea
son, but apparently many people have not sense enough to heed them.
This, we hope, is not true of us around Stanford.
