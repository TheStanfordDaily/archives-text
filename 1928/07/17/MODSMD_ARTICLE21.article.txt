The City Council of Palo Alto has approved the operations of
the Palo Alto School of Aviation, by refusing to act on the petition
to do away with the school on the grounds that it is a nuisance. This
is as it should be. If everything that annoyed anybody was done
away with, there would be little left to make this life worth living.
Lieutenant Goddard has assured the Council that everything possible
will be done to reduce the annoyance to a minimum. This is, after
all, all that can be reasonably expected.
Many things that have been accepted through usages are annoy
ances. People living on a much-used highway complain of the noise
of the motor cars. Street car lines in a big city are a great incon
venience to those whose houses front on the tracks. But we still have
street cars and we still have automobiles. Each of these nuisances
has been complained of in its time, but in each case progress lias won.
As Lieutenant Goddard points out, the aeroplane today holds
much the same position as the automobile twenty-five years ago. At
that time the automobile was considered a source of great danger.
Today it is considered a necessity. We laugh at the stories about how
they tried to chase automobiles off the streets. No doubt in another
twenty-five years the story of the petition against aeroplanes will be
an equal source of merriment.
