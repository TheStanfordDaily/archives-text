# The 						Favorite Son

### 
Next Friday afternoon will witness the homecoming of Stan
ford's most famous son, Herbert Hoover, '95, Republican candidate
for president. He will be welcomed back to his home and Alma
Mater by his many friends who live in this vicinity and by political
adherents from all parts of the country.
Hoover has made a name for himself in every line of work he
has attempted.
He has made thousands of friends throughout the world, and
especially right here near his old home. These people have
watched his phenomenal rise with pleasure. They were proud of
him when he first succeeded in the mining world, they were proud
when he was nominated for President of the United States. 1 hese
people would give Herbert Hoover, the man, the same hearty wel
come as they will give Herbert Hoover, the presidential nominee.
