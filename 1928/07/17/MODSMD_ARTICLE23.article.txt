Montgomery Street is fast becom
ing one of the country's largest finan
cial centers, and, with Bank of Italy
acting the way it has been, will soon
be the most notorious. Skyscrapers,
the latest San Francisco fad, are be
ing erected on this street, and each
new one seems to try and raise its
head higher than all around. During
the day, Montgomery is the busiest
thoroughfare in the city; messenger
boys racing from door to door, Italians
anxiously looking for the latest bank
stock quotations, and straw-hatted
brokers overflow the sidewalks and
half fill the street. At night, as though
by magic, everyone is gone; the finan
cial section is deserted, and only an
occasional automobile disturbs the
deep quiet and loneliness.

Russian Hill is another of San
Francisco's glorified sandpiles. It is
also another artists' colony; a
wealthier and more exclusive district
than Telegraph Hill, but not so in
teresting. Besides being an artists'

[ colony, it is covered with some of the
best and most ornate apartment
! houses in the city. Russian Hill is
i most famous, however, because Rob-
I ert Louis Stevenson's San Francisco
was located there.

Twin Peaks are at the southern end
of San Francisco. They, like other
elevations on the peninsula, "have a
view." San Francisco, Oakland. Pied
mont, Berkeley, and all the bay region
can be seen from these peaks on a
clear day. But most astounding is the
view of Market Street; straight as a
die from the foot of the peaks to the
Ferry Building, it looks like a tre
mendous mountain pass because of
the tall structures on either side.

Nob Hill, once San Francisco's
most exclusive and most beautiful
residential district, is now covered
with hotels and apartment houses.
The Mark Hopkins Hotel is the ren
dezvous for college students, particu
larly on Friday nights, when its dance
floor looks like a California-Stanford
reunion.
