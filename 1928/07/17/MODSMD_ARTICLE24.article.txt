A MORAL VICTORY?
"The Captive," characterized by
one San Francisco paper as vile, ob
scene, salacious, and everything else
of this nature, was stopped by the
police on the opening night. The po
lice interference came after a bitter
editorial battle by this certain paper.
The story appearing the next day car
ried a highly colored account of the
raid. A rival paper in San Francisco
gave a straight news account of what
happened. The reader receives two
'rather opposing impressions from the
two articles.
We don't care whether this play
is given or not. In fact, after all
the publicity it has received, we
believe it would be better if it
were not given. If it were to be
given now, a large number of peo
ple would go to the show and
hunt for something obscene, in
stead of trying to learn any moral
lesson that it might have to teach.
And we feel sure that a large
number that would attend for
that purpose would be the strict
moralists who are now condemn
ing it.
We are wondering just how many
San Francisco people are against this
•play. We do not believe that there is
a large number. The police, naturally,
are stopping the play because they
are forced to on account of the edi
torial campaign. To do this they had
to bring up an old ordinance. We
understand that in another city a new
ordinance had to be enacted to stop
it because it could not come under
the class of obscene plays. The main
criticism of "The Captive" is that it
deals with an unpleasant topic.
The topic "The Captive" deals
with is sex perversion. True, it is
an unpleasant subject. So are dis
-4 ease, murder, the dope evil, and
many other things. Isn't it pos
sible that plays can deal with
such subjects without coming
under the classifications that this
newspaper has placed this play?
We believe that it is, and that it
is foolish to take an antagonistic
attitude toward speaking of such
things.
Even though this side of the
sex problem is unpleasant, why is
San Francisco so up in arms as
this newspaper would have us be
lieve when sex has been treated
in other plays and in newspapers
in a much worse manner?
We found several people who at
tended the play in San Francisco. Our
first question was, "Did you believe
that 'The Captive' was obscene, judg
ing from as much as you heard?"
Their answers .were, "No." They said
that an unpleasant subject had been
handled wonderfully. The remark that
interested us most was this, "It was
well done, and a thousand times better
than the filth and trash that is pre
sented in most shows."

From time to time there have
been cases in San Francisco
whdre stories involving sex mat
ters arose. Did the newspapers
protect public morals by running
as little as possible of these
stories? No, they played them to
the limit. Was this not infinitely
worse than allowing this show to
go on? The newspaper articles
had no purpose except to bring
out every bit of filth in the trials.
This crime was greater than
that of the producers who are al
leged to be capitalizing on this
obscene play. The newspapers
went into every home, were sold
on the streets; they carried large
headlines to tell of the trash that
could be found down below. Very
few people thought that this was
disgusting, and we will wager that
any number of people with sup
pressed desires ate such stuff up.
Disgusting murders are played
up the same way, and the news
papers sell thousands of extras.

We believe that the moral standards
of the younger generation are lowered
a great deal more by the ordinary
smut and dirt that is in nearly every
popular play, most vaudeville acts,
and the daily papers than they would
be by "The Captive." In these, the
common, but nevertheless regrettable
vices, are placed before the people as
being ordinary things. Young people
see these plays, hear these vaudeville
acts, read newspapers, and find these
topics treated as If "they were very
common things. Their attitude
changes, they look on these things as
being rather usual, and not evil as
they always understood. Practicing
them is the next step.

Both papers said that the or
chestra played "The Star Span
gled Banner," forcing the audi
ence and police to stand at atten
tion until the last strains had
died away. One paper, the one
which is ambitious to protect pub
contemptible act. We believe that
lie morals, declared this to be a
it was rather poor taste, but we
believe that whoever did it had a
sense of humor, even though »t
was a little perverted.
It is just a little humorous to
have the police stopping a play
in the land of the free and the
home of the brave, especially
when it is doubtful whether a ma
jority of the people believe that
the play should be stopped.
