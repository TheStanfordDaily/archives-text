# DR. PATTON CONCLUDES SUNDAY SERMON GROUP
## 
### 
"Culture and Self-sacrifice" was the
subject of the last of a series of three
sermons delivered in the Memorial
Church Sunday by Dr. Carl S. Patton.
"By culture I mean the whole pro
cess of becoming what you make
'yourselfâ€”the development of your
personality," said Dr. Patton.
"By self-sacritice I mean the every
day kind, not the spectacular, the
whole process by which a man be
comes a distributor and a giver in
stead of a hoarder.
"Culture and self-sacrifice blended
make up the ideal of wholesome hu
man life, but you must have them
both. Self-sacrifice for its own sake
is absurd. The only justification of it
is the improvement of one's self or
somebody else. Culture is necessary
to make self-sacrifice worth anything."
