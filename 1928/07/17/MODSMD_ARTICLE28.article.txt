Boojum, by Charles Wertenbaker:
Boni Liverright; New York (1928)
"Boojum" is a college novel. I be
lieve that the story is written about
the University of Virginia; if it is,
the University ought to sue Werten
baker. He pictures collefee life as a
'cross between a nightclub and a Tia
juana saloon, and he typifies the col
lege student as an inebriated circus
clown whose language is comparable
!to that used by a mule-skinner ad
dressing his beast of burden. Another
novel like this and I'll almost be con
vinced that the younger generation is
indeed on the primrose path that
leads to perdition.
It is the story of a man who devotes
his life to a search for something
which he never finds; at the end of
the book one discovers that this
something is his true self. Although
the idea Wertenbaker wishes to con
vey is the futility of the man's life,
he devotes most of the book to his
escapes from his Pharisaical actions.
The book is filled with fatuity, var
nished with erroneous local color, and
is too obviously written to sell. How
ever, there is one feature of the book
that saves it from being impossible:
Wertenbaker * creates an individualist

in the main character, Stuart. In pro
ducing Stuart, he has created a per
sonage who is graced with such an
exotic complex of characteristics that
he cannot help being interesting, and
oddly enough the characterization is
convincing, or at least amenable to
comprehension.
The book has many weaknesses,
but the most outstanding is the way
in which he re-creates situations. In
cident after incident follows from a
single impetus; however, each action
change is produced without dramatic
fore-announcer. This breach in techni
cal formation coupled with his con
sistency in situation steals all sense
of freshness that the story might pos
sess.
"Boojum" contains but one bit of
literary accomplishment worthy of
note —the ending. Here Wertenbaker
has done a startling, but logical piece
of work in creating an ending which
is conclusive without being so definite
that it comes as a long-looked-for
period.
"Boojum" would have made an in
teresting short story, but aB a novel
it lacked force due to its being so
prolonged.
