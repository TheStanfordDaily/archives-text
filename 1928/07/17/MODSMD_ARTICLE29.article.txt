# CONVALESCENT HOME RECEIVES $300 FROM LAST YEAR'S SENIORS
## Dr. Gardner Originated Idea Of Institution Which Began in 1919 
### 
After cleaning up the bills and
other financial matters of the Class
of 1928, George Ellsworth, class treas
urer, finds that he has some $300 left.
This money will be given to the Stan
ford Convalescent Home, leaving them
free to use the money as they see fit.
The Convalescent Home owes its
origin to Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
Chaplin of the University. In 1919 he
conceived of the plan of caring for
convalesdfent children in a summer
camp here, where they could have the
benefit of the Peninsula's sunshine
and fine climate. Some one hundred
and twenty children were cared for
at this camp, with so much success
that the Stanford Hospital urged the
University to establish a Home for
the care of such children the year
round.
In 1920, under the leadership of Dr.
Gardner, the Stanford Convalescent
Home was a reality. The old Stanford
residence was the original Home, and
remained the sole building till 1923,
when the McLaughlin Unit, a gift of
Mrs. Henry Crocker of San Francisco
in honor of Mrs. Kate D. McLaughlin,
was added. This addition doubled the
capacity of the Home. In 1927 an ad
mission ward accommodating six chil
dren was added to the McLaughlin

unit. At present another unit, similar
to the McLaughlin unit, is being add
ed, and is about ready for occupation.
This latter is the Babcock unit, built
by a bequest from the estate of Mrs.
Harry Babcock. An Administration
and Dormitory building for the nurses
is the next building improvement that
is planned.
Money to administer the Home
comes from three sources, the inter
est from the original and specified en
dowments, the receipts from parents
of children who can afford to pay,
and from charitable institutions, and
the income from public contributions.
It is to this last source that the Class
of 1928's gift will be added.
The Stanford Convalescent Home is
an institution in the hearts of all the
alumni and students of Stanford. The
University once each year declares a
half-holiday at which time everyone
goes to the Home and does his bit in
aiding to clean up the grounds and
the like. It is urged that every sum
mer session student plan to visit the
Home before the quarter is over, so
that he may see the wonderful work
that is being done for the children
here, and thus too, feel a paÂ»t of
"Stanford's Own Charity."
