# "QUEEN'S HUSBAND" TO BE PRESENTED HERE ON AUGUST 10
## 
### 
Gordon Davis announced today that
"The Queen's Husband" will again be
presented at the Assembly Hall on
August 10, the night before Hoover's
formal acceptance. Davis said that
because of the insistency of the de
mand for another performance he
teels that he is justified in rendering
Sherwood's play for the second time.
The same cast which played in the
last presentation is to be used and
this should make for an even more
finished production than before.
The set used in the first production
of "The Queen's Husband" has been
preserved and Helvenstou says that
it can easily be re-framed.
The play on August 10 should bring
many San Francisco theatregoers be
cause of the publicity given it in city
dramatic pages.
