# GEOLOGISTS FIND KEGS OF LIQUOR ON BEACH
## 
### 
A professor of geology and several
students returned from a field trip to
Half Moon Bay recently, filled with
reminiscences of buccaneers and
treasure trove. But the pirates were
modern in this instance and the treas
ure was barrels of a certain liquid in
stead of pieces of eight.
Tliq party reported finding several
ten-gallon kegs of grain alcohol which
had floated ashore during the recent
lii-jacker and bootlegger war. This
find didn't come under any category
of geology so the group set a match
to the kegs. The contents burned with
a bright blue flame.
