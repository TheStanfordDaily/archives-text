The La Honda Lookout affords a
better view of the campus and all the
surrounding country than any other
accessible points nearby. Stanford,
Palo Alto, Mayfield, and Searsville
Lake are all spread in a vast pano
rama beneath the Lookout. The writer
of this column will not try to explain
the intricacies of finding the Lookout
for the simple reason that he has not
a very good sense of direction. But
this fact remains, anyone who "seeks
and finds" shall be well rewarded for
his efforts.

The American Legion of Honor
Building is, perhaps, San Francisco's
greatest cultural achievement. The
building itself, and many of the works
of art which it contains, were donated
by Adolph and Alma de Bretteville
Spreckels. A beautiful building, lo
cated in the midst of the green fair
ways of the Lincoln Park Golf Course,
it has innumerable creations which
are well worth seeing. The most fa
mous collection is that of Rodin's
works. Some of his most prominent
works represented there are The
Thinker, St. John the Baptist, Christ
and the Magdalene, and The Age of
Bronze. The Roghi, a work by Theo
dore Riviere, is also present. It is
noted for the immensity of its detail,
and the care with which it is carried
out.

A hermit is also known as an an
choret.
