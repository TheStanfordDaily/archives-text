at the Stanford Union. A serious dis
cussion of professional problems was
interspersed with fun, jokes, and
singing. Superintendent Walter L.
Bachrodt of San Jose presided.
Dr. John C. Almack, the speaker of
the evening, discussed some of the
aspects of the Teacher Tenure prob
lem. He pointed out that numerous
considerations which involve the
rights of the public, the boards of
education and the teachers make the
matter one difficult to adjust equi

teacher tenure in California at the

cussed problem in educational circles.
