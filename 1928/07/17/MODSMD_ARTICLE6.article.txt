# TRIO PLEASES IN CONCERT GIVEN AT BRANNER
## Compositions From Kreisler, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Mozart Played "Long, Long Ago" Sung With Great Feeling; Brings Tears to Audience 
### 
Miss Winifred Estabrook, soprano,
Miss Elizabeth Peirce, violinist, and
Austin Mosher, pianist, appeared in a
very pleasing concert, before a large
audience, at Branner Hall last eve
ning.
The opening number L'Amero Saro
Constante, a composition of Mozart,
sung by Miss Estabrook, showed finish
and perfection characteristic of Mo
zart. The violin obbligato by Miss
Peirce had bright and varied tone
color.
There was a slight distraction,
which seemed amusing to all, due to
the adjustment of a piano pedal, but
that was all right, as it was soon for
gotten when Miss Peirce appeared in
some group numbers. Her style of
playing was full of glow and showed
deep personal feeling, which in La
Gitana, one of Kreisler's composi
tions, brought out the brilliant part
of the composition.
Widmung, a song from the "Die
derkreis" series, an especially favorite
song of Schumann, sung by Miss Esta
brook brought out the great wealth
of melody. Her German accent was
good. The remarkable feature of the
song was the piano accompaniment
by Austin Mosher, which was as indi
vidual as the voice part.
The piano has its own work to per
form, expressing what the voice or
violin cannot and sometimes inde
pendent of them. Austin Mosher lived
up to all of this.
Mendelssohn's Wings of Song had
beauty and sentiment and was sung
with rare grace and perfection of
finish.
Both young ladies, after hearty ap
plause. responded to encores. "Long, !
Long Ago," sung with such feeling,
was very effective and brought tears
to the audience.
Miss Estabrook graduated from
Stanford in *24 and Miss Peirce of
the class of '25, is the daughter of
Professor G. J. Peirce of the Botany
department.
