# "THE CHIEF THING," NEXT PRODUCTION, IS UNUSUAL DRAMA
## Play Portrays An Ironical Situation of Happiness Based on Sham Helvenston Planning Russian Stage Consistency And Selective Lighting 
### 
"The Chief Thing," Evreinoff's fan
tastic creation, is not a realistic pro
duction; it is merely a philosophical
idea framed in bizarre dialogue. It is
the story of a man, Paraclete, who
wishes to become a director on the
larger stage of life rather than behind
the footlights of a theatre.
Nolan Cast in Lead
He employs a troupe of actors to
move into a boarding house filled
with fiat, unhappy, banal characters,
and by the dint of acting make them
into interesting personages. The
ironical situation of a happiness
based on a sham lends a rather mor
bid tone to the production which one
does not realize until its completion.
The part of Paraclete is being played
by Lloyd Nolan who has developed
the character to a point of highly
amenable comprehension.
Holmes Stewart, who is cast as the
Comedian, gives promise of creating
an unusual portrayal. Stewart gained
his experience with the Lodi Players
where he played many leads. His big
gest successes have been in "The
.Blimp" and "Take My Advice."
Lucie Bentley is to dance the first
Assyrian dance ever to be produced
on the campus. John Jago, who is an
accomplished pianist, is to render sev
eral pieces during the performance.
These two features should add to the
exotic effect of the play.
Greek Method To Be Used
Harold Helvenston said today that
he is going to use a modern adapta
tion of the old Greek method of
scene-changing known as eccyclema.
He has combined it with Russian
stage consistency which uses only the
barest possible essentials on the set.
He also intends to use a form of se
lective lighting in which only those
characters engaged in the positive ac
tion are cast in the concentrated light.
By all indications this production
should overshadow "The Queen's Hus
band" in attendance. Already the seat
sale is greater than that of the for
mer presentation.
Gordon Davis said tonight that the
play would be directed from a purely
philosophical aspect, and all the ac
tion would be framed along that line.
