# SECOND SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION GIVEN BY DR. LEPESCHKIN
## "Physiological Phenomena Topic of Lecture Given Here Yesterday 
### 
Yesterday afternoon in Room 4f>o
Professor W. W. Lepesclikin gave the
second of liis series of lectures. The
subject of this talk was "Physiologi
cal Phenomena from a Standpoint of
Chemistry and Physics," and was
made very clear and interesting by
demonstrations.
Professor Lepesclikin stated that
there is no great difference between
living organisms and dead nature. All
physiological phenomena can be di
vided into four classes: movement,
growth, multiplication, and trans
formation of substances.
Living Cell a Machine
"The living cell is a chemical ma
chine," said the lecturer. This was
explained by his saying that energy
is formed where needed and not trans
ported from place to place as one
might easily imagine.
The striking similarity between the
reactions of the living cell and phe
nomena seen in the realms of physics
and chemistry was brought out by
the experiments which he demon
strated.
Salts Made to Grow
Growth is not limited to proto
plasm, as Dr. Lepesclikin demon
strated by the use of crystalline chem
ical salts. They were made to grow
by placing them in a solution con
taining sodium silicate.
"Hence," concluded Dr. Lepesclikin,
"it is through a study of the chemical
and physical processes which produce
these reactions that we shall be able
to understand physiological pheno
mena."
First Lecture Tuesday
At the first lecture Tuesday eve
ning Doctor Lepesclikin spoke to a
large audience of visitors and stu
dents in the Little Theatre. The sub
ject, "The Cause of Death," was dis
cussed from the angle of death in the
protoplasm, rather than death in the
organism as a whole.
Carvel, according to Dr. Lepesclikin,
has kept tissue alive in a physiologi
cal solution for years beyond the nor
mal life span of the organism from
which it was takeji.
Can Prolong Cellular Life
Cellular life may be prolonged in
definitely in the laboratory and in
