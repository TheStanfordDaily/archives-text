# MARY NASH, DRAMATIC STAR, VISITS CAMPUS AS GUEST OF DAVIS
## Accompanied by Sister Looks Over Drama Program And Stage Sets 
### 
Mary Nash and her sister, Frances
Nash, were on the campus yesterday
by the invitation of Gordon Davis.
The two Nash sisters were shown
about the campus by Gordon Davis
and Professor Bassett, who is head
of the public speaking department at
Stanford. They were particularly in
terested in the courses dealing with
the different phases of dramatics
taught at Stanford.
Mary Nash is a noted actress who
is at present playing the lead in the
interestingly peccant production of
j "The Command to Love," which is
now in San Francisco. Her sister,
Frances Nash, is also a prominent
actress who has just arrived from the
East on a vacation. Both women have
been taking a keen interest in college

j dramatics.
"College dramatics are a boon to
: the professional stage, for from this
rank must come our actors and act
resses to play tomorrow's parts. The
drama of today demands training not
only in the field of acting, but in
other phases of education. The col
j lege is the only place where one may
: gain both stage coaching and a formal
education at the same time," Mary
Nash said when asked her opinion
about college dramatic training.
Miss Nash believes that the day of
; imitating the English pronunciation
on the American stage is passed. She
j expounded the idea that "American
j English" will be the language of the
stage in this country. "All the stage
J demands is that a voice be pleasing
land that the pronunciation be free
I from the stigma of provincial pecu
j liarities and the diction bo exact."
j were the words of Miss Nash.
