# Funeral Services For Mrs. Hoover's Father Will Be Held Today
## Charles D. Henry Came to Monterey to Establish First Bank There 
### 
The funeral of Charles D.
Henry, father of Mrs. Lou Henry
Hoover, who died at Placerville
Wednesday morning after a two
weeks' illness, will be held this
afternoon. The services will be
strictly private.
Mr. Henry was known and respect
ed by large numbers of people at
Stanford and in Palo Alto, having
made his home with the Hoovers and
with his other daughter, Mrs. Jean
Large, since the death of his wife.
He was on a camping trip with Mrs.
Large, when, on July 4, he was sud
denly stricken with paralysis.
Achieved Partial Recovery
Despite his 84 years, his vitality
was so strong that at first there were
strong indications to his physicians
that he would survive. Indeed, he did
achieve a partial recovery. Dr. Arthur
L. Bloomfield and Dr. Russel V. Lee
of the Stanford Medical School fac
ulty hurried to Placerville when lie
was first attacked and found his con
dition surprisingly encouraging. Presi
dent Wilbur also visited him and con
sulted with his local physician. Then
suddenly his condition became worse;
he lost the power of speech com
pletely and remained wholly uncon
scious until his death.
Mr. and Mrs. Hoover, upon this re
versal in his condition, abandoned the
schedule by which they were moving
westward and had their train made a
second section of the fast Overland
Limited, failing, however, to reach
his bedside before his death. Alan
Hoover, son of Mr. and Mrs. Hoover
and a Stanford senior, went from the
campus at once to aid his aunt, Mrs.
Large, in caring for Mr. Henry's com
fort.
Was Banker in Monterey
As a banker in Monterey, Mr.
Henry was for nearly thirty years one
of the leaders of business and civic
activities of that city. He went there
in 1892 to give the aid of his ex
perience in establishing the first
bank, having brought his wife and
two daughters, Lou and Jean, to
Whittier from lowa a few years be
fore. When the bank was in operation
he was persuaded to give up his idea
of leaving it and remained as its
guiding genius until he retired in
1920. When his wife died in the fol
lowing year he left Monterey and had
since made his home with his daugh
ters here.
Lover of Outdoors
Throughout his life he had been a
close companion of his two daughters
and his greatest delight from the time
of their early girlhood was to go
camping with them in the mountains.
It was while on such a trip with one
of them that he suffered the attack
that ended in his death. Mrs. Hoover
has gone on such an expedition with
him annually for a number of years,
with few exceptions .but had post
poned it this year, hoping to have
some opportunity during her stay in
California this summer.

When the seniors appear in caps
and gowns at the University of Mon
tana, the juniors don bathrobes and
march behind them in stately pro
cession.
