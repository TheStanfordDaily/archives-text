# BERNARDINO MOLINARI LEADS FIFTH SUNDAY SYMPHONY CONCERT
## First Selection Will Be His Transcription of Old Italian Classic 
### 
Bernardino Molinari, Italy's only
symphony orchestra conductor, will
give his third and last concert in the
open-air Woodland Theatre next Sun
day afternoon at 3 o'clock. As the
program is similar in make-up to that
of his two preceding concerts, it
promises to be another musical treat.
The Italian conductor has drawn
from the rich store of his country
men's compositions, and with rare
skill has enriched many of them with
his own arrangements for modern full
orchestra. He has done this in the
first number on the program, his own
concerto arrangement for strings,
cembalo, and organ of "Spring" from
Vivaldi's suite of "The Four Seasons."
Another promising number is the
Haydn Symphony in G major, known
as No. 13 in the Breitkopk and Hartel
classification.
Last Sunday Molinari proved him
self both familiar and sympathetic
with the "moderns" in his rendition
of Richard Strauss' Tone Poem. Death
and Transfiguration, and in this final
program he will again play a Strauss
composition, the Rondo "Till Eulen
spiegel's Merry Pranks."
The entire program for Sunday is
as follows:
"Spring" from "The Four Seasons"

(Concerto for strings, cembalo,
and organ transcribed by
Molinari)

that guarantees programs both inter
esting and entertaining.
