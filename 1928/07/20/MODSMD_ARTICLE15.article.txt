# Hoover Party Arrives On Campus; Nominee Retires Direct to Home
## Community's Sympathy Goes To The Hoover Family In Their Sorrow Representatives of Leading Newspapers Accompany Nominee's Party 
### 
Herbert Hoover arrived by special
train in Palo Alto this morning at 11
o'clock. The train, which had been
running as the second section of the
San Francisco Overland Limited on
the Southern Pacific, was routed by
way of Niles Canyon and the Dum
barton cutoff so as to arrive directly
in Palo Alto.
There was no public reception by
request of Hoover because of the
death of his father-in-law in Placer
ville. The presidential candidate was
greeted only by a silent though warm
ly sympathetic populace.
Go Directly to Home
After leaving the train the Secre
tary of Commerce and Mrs. Hoover
went directly to their home on San
Juan Hill accompanied by Mrs. Jean
Henry Large, sister of Mrs. Hoover,
and Allan Hoover, youngest son of
Mr. and Mrs. Hoover, who had joined
the party at Sacramento.
The body of C. D. Henry, the father
of Mrs. Hoover, was sent yesterday
from Placerville to Palo Alto, where
it arrived a short time before the
Hoover special.
Because of Henry's death Governor
C. C. Young cancelled plans for a
special train which had been arranged
to carry him and a group of promi
nent Republicans to greet Hoover at
Truckee.
Official notice of the change in
plans came late Wednesday in a tele
gram to Mayor James Rolph, Jr., from
North Platte, Neb., and read:
"On account of the death of Mrs.
Hoover's father, it will be necessary
to defer welcome in San Francisco
and go direct to Palo Alto for the
funeral services there."
President William Sproule of the
Southern Pacific Company sent a tele
gram to Hoover, placing the resources
of the railroad at his disposal and
asking for an expression of his
wishes.
Nation Sends Telegrams
Meanwhile telegrams of condolence
from all parts of the nation poured
in hourly to the Hoovers. Many of
them were received from people in
this vicinity who are intimately con
nected with the family. Mayor Frank
G. Hoge of Palo Alto, and Mayor
James Rolph, Jr., of San Francisco,
were among those who indicated their
sympathy.
More than a score of newspaper
men representing all the important
papers and press associations of the
country, accompanied the Hoover
party to Palo Alto. Office accommoda
tions have been made for them at the
Phi Kappa Psi House and the Gamma
Phi Beta House on the campus. Spe
cial telephone and telegraph lines
have been connected directly to these
houses, which are located but a few
yards from the nominee's home.
