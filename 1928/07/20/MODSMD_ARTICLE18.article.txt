# A 						Silent Hand-Grip

### 
Herbert Hoover and Lou Henry Hoover, whom a few days ago
we were preparing to greet in noisy pride as they returned once
more to the campus to receive here at their home the high honor
that has been prepared for them, came home today and we were
quiet, extending to them in silence the sympathy we have in their
deep personal grief.
These two we have come to regard as typical of the best that
Stanford can make of its sons and daughters, and as sons and daugh
ters of the same alma mater we feel a bond of affection for them
that makes our sorrow with them genuine and not mere seeming.
Words cannot help us to express our sympathy as we would have
them know it. We cannot find words to frame any adequate ex
pression. Words will not do it. We think they will understand.
