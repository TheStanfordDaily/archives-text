A report that the United States Army chemical warfare experi
ments have successfully used poison gases in combating the on
slaughts of the teredo, or marine borer, was confirmed yesterday by
Professor C. A. Kofoid, head of the zoology department at the
University of California.
During the war thousands of soldiers were killed by the deadly
fumes of this gas and thousands of dollars were expended in the
manufacturing of it for that sole purpose. The result was only
increased emnity between nations.
Today such products are experimented with in order to aid man
kind. Each year these marine borers destroy hundreds of thousands
of dollars' worth of piling and lumber. Now we find the remedy
to be the same gas that was used for killing men not so many years
ago. Every man-made article has a war-time and peace-time use.
Its use in war-time brings only destruction of life and property, and
hard times, while its use in peace often helps to promote good feeling
and prosperity between nations. World peace or antagonism can be
solved by answering such simple questions as whether it shall be
death to teredos or human beings in the future. At least this should
give some people food for thought.
