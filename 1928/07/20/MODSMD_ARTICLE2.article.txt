School of Education is to talk on
'•'The Nature of Humor," at the San
Jose State Teachers College, July 24.
Dr. Almack has made an extended

"Sense of Humor" test. He has sought
to detect, isolate, and rank the vari
ous elements which are the ingredi
ents of humor. From the psychologi
cal standpoint it might be said that
Dr. Almack is seeking the formulas
which control mirth.
Can it be premised that there are
elements common to every laugh-get
ting situation, picture, predicament,
or joke, if so, what are they? In what
ratios are they present? Do the ratios
and combinations vary widely or do
they tend to follow a fairly fixed ar
rangement? Do various elements have
a universal appeal and others a lim
ited appeal; if so, which are the more
popular ones? These are some of the
problems which Dr. Almack has
sought to answer.
