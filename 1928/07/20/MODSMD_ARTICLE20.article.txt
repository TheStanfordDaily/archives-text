A college student may have his fling once in a while, and yet
not be the proverbial Carl Campus so thoroughly overdone in the
movie versions of university life. These so-called flings are but a
small part of the four years he spends at his favorite institution â€”
and are the quickest to be forgotten. After those years he faces the
more serious things of life. Many of the antics which seemed so
humorous at the time they were enacted do not seem so funny later
on. This was exemplified in an incident which took place at Belle
fonte, Pennsylvania, recently.
Not long ago a well-dressed man registered at a hotel there. He
confided to the proprietor of the hotel that in 1 () 07 he and two of
his chums, who were then students at Pennsylvania State College,
were marooned in Bellfonte without a penny in their pockets. It
was late and they were then twelve miles from the college town.
Awaiting their opportunity, the boys stealthily made their way
into the hotel, crept into an unoccupied room, and spent the night,
getting out early before the landlord was up.
This former student, who had been a party in the "crime," said
that his conscience had been troubling him for twenty-one years
about the unpaid bill, and insisted on paying for the room he and his
chums had occupied.
