# PENINSULAR POINTS

### 
The Ferry Building at the end of
Market Street is the center of all
ferry traffic on the San Francisco
Bay. Commuters from the entire bay
region get up early in the morning,
grab a bite to eat, and take a ferry to
San Francisco. They all land at about
the same time. In the evening they
all leave for home at practically the
same time. Hence, about 8:30 and
about 5:30, the Ferry Building is the
scene of a most unusual activity. The
Ferry Building is always crowded to
capacity on Big Game Day when the
contest takes place in Berkeley.

Some enterprising person once
floated the Oregon Building from the
1915 World's Fair down the bay and
grounded it parallel to Belmont. This
large square structure was then
opened as the New Babylon Cafe, and
some very interesting parties were
held there until the community arose
in righteous indignation .and closed
this "hall of iniquity." Last December
another enterprising individual se
cured this place and advertised an
immense brawl on New Year's Eve. A
large crowd responded, and the place
was filled with diners on that night.
Everything went along smoothly
through the first course, when the
cover charge was collected. Then the

customers waited and waited for the
main course, but they waited in vain,
for unfortunately the promoter of this
wild affair had the presence of mind
to leave with the money in his pocket.
Since then the building has remained
vacant, a monument to public stupid
ity and private enterprise.

The Bayshore Cutoff is a fitting
monument to some promoter of Penin
sular progress. Anyone who wanted
to leave San Francisco by land, and
in an automobile, previously had to
go along the main highway. This road
stood the strain well from three to
four on Monday mornings, hut was
crowded the rest of the week. Then
the highway was widened, but Ford
invented his "five dollars down and
five dollars a week" plan, antl condi
tions remained as complicated as
ever. Finally some brave soul con
ceived the idea of another highway,
and this was realized as the Bayshore
Cutoff. It now goes as far down as
Broadway, and will eventually con
tinue on to San Jose. It is a beautiful
broad road, and relieves the traffic
strain considerably.
