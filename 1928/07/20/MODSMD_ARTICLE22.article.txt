The Editor, Sir: For a mosquito
abatement district this territory is
singularly alive with mosquitoes. You
say the lake is not the answer, well
then, what is? The information you
so laboriously dug up doesn't seem to
solve the problem, which we see, and
feel about us continually.
We admit that the mosquitoes are
not as much in evidence as they were
last year but what we want to know
is why they are in evidence at all?
The mere presence of an inspector
means nothing in the life of a mo
squito. How about a little action?
Bitten again,
