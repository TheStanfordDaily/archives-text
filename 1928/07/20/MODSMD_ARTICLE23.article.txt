In this letter, '29 and '30, who seem
to be regarded as particularly choice
food by mosquitoes, complain that the
answer given in the Daily to their
last viewpoint on mosquitoes was not
sufficient to induce them to suffer in
silence, and ask for a little action.
It is impossible for the few men
employed to make sure that there are
no mosquitoes breeding at all, but a
survey recently completed shows that
only a negligible number are bred on
this side.
Practically all the mosquitoes that
are proving so bothersome to '29 and
'30 come from across the bay. It
seems that the species that make
their home in the salt water marshes
are very hardy specimens. Not only
can they travel a longer distance than
the fresh water ones but they are
capable of biting much harder. When
these mosquitoes take it into their
minds to travel over here for a
change of diet they don't seem to re
gard any county lines or pay any at
tention to the inspectors.
These breeding-places are allowed
to go on because there is no one
whose duty it is to take care of them.
The mosquito abatement districts are
county and not state projects, and the
money for their upkeep is provided
by a special county tax. Santa Clara,
San Mateo, San Francisco, and Napa
counties are the only ones that have
done anything toward the mosquito
problem. It is practically impossible
for people in this vicinity to expect
very complete relief from mosquitoes
until the counties across the bay take
up this problem or the state takes it
over.

The letter does not specify whether
these annoying members of the fam
ily Culicidae did most of their dirty
work in the daytime or at night. If it
was at night, mosquito netting could
be used to good effect, we believe.
If it was in the daytime, we suggest
that '29 and '30 keep wide awake and
swat any mosquitoes that come within
swatting distance. This would be a
true service to humanity.
For the past bites we can do noth

ing, but the bitten can gain what
solace they may from the fact that
the mosquitoes certainly traveled a
long way for their little nip.

In this letter, '29 and '30, who seem
to be regarded as particularly choice
food by mosquitoes, complain that the
answer given in the Daily to their
last viewpoint on mosquitoes was not
sufficient to induce them to suffer in
silence, and ask for a little action.
It is impossible for the few men
employed to make sure that there are
no mosquitoes breeding at all, but a
survey recently completed shows that
only a negligible number are bred on
this side.
Practically all the mosquitoes that
are proving so bothersome to '29 and
'30 come from across the bay. It
seems that the species that make
their home in the salt water marshes
are very hardy specimens. Not only
can they travel a longer distance than
the fresh water ones but they are
capable of biting much harder. When
these mosquitoes take it into their
minds to travel over here for a
change of diet they don't seem to re
gard any county lines or pay any at
tention to the inspectors.
These breeding-places are allowed
to go on because there is no one
whose duty it is to take care of them.
The mosquito abatement districts are
county and not state projects, and the
money for their upkeep is provided
by a special county tax. Santa Clara,
San Mateo, San Francisco, and Napa
counties are the only ones that have
done anything toward the mosquito
problem. It is practically impossible
for people in this vicinity to expect
very complete relief from mosquitoes
until the counties across the bay take
up this problem or the state takes it
over.

The letter does not specify whether
these annoying members of the fam
ily Culicidae did most of their dirty
work in the daytime or at night. If it
was at night, mosquito netting could
be used to good effect, we believe.
If it was in the daytime, we suggest
that '29 and '30 keep wide awake and
swat any mosquitoes that come within
swatting distance. This would be a
true service to humanity.
