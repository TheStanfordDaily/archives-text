# POLIOMYELITIS VICTIM CONQUERS DREAD FOE IN BACTERIOLOGY 'LAB'
## 
### 
Mary Jane is the self-appointed
nursemaid for the bacteriology de
partment. She is at present busily
taking care of Pete during his conva
lescence.
One naturally wonders how these
two interesting "personages" hap
pened to take up residence on the
campus. It was made possible by the
fund created for the bacteriology de
partment for the study of poliomyeli
tis. This necessitates the use of mon
keys, of which the department has
about fifty, as they are the only ani
mals besides man that suffer from
this dread disease.
Pete happens to be a valuable
monkey, as he recovered from a slight
attack of "polio," thus making his

| serum valuable for studies of im
! munity. He has been rewarded with a
j name instead of being known as
! simply "A 20," or some other equally
! unindividualistic title.
Mary Jane, having formerly been
I a pet, was not put with the wild
monkeys. Instead she was placed in
I the cage containing the "patient."
The sight of this little paralyzed
i monkey pulled at her heartstrings and
she soon began to mother it, and Pete
i manifested his appreciation in child
i like affection. There are no monkey
shines in this cage, for Mary Jane is
busily helping a little invalid regain
his health.

There are more than thirty honor
| ary organizations created for the pur
j pose of urging students to do super
ior work in the various phases of
} campus activities to be found at U.S.O.
