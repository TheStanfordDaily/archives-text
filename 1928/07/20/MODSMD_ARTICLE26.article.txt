# FEUILLERAT TALKS ON "SONGS AND SONNETS" IN MID-WEEK LECTURE
## Chronology of Poems Can Be Solved by Comparison Of Construction 
### 
That Shakespeare's sonnets are not
merely literary exercises as has been
contended by certain groups of critics
was the thesis held by Dr. Feuillerat
in the second of his brilliant series of
lectures. Dr. Feuillerat claims that
the sonnets are true lyric poems for
they are filled with their author's
emotions and intimate feelings. They
are the only productions of Shake
speare's pen in which he uses the
pronoun "I."
Uses New Method of Attack
The proofs advanced by Dr. Feuil
lerat were numerous and made a
strong case. He said that efforts made
in the past to arrange the sonnets in
chronoligal order had failed because
the method of attacking the problem
was based on a study of the subject
content of the sonnets. Dr. Feuillerat
used a method of attack based on a
close analysis and comparative study
of the similarities and dissimiliarities
of technical construction and segre
gated certain characteristics of liter
ary composition. It might be explained
that the reason Shakespeare's son
nets were never originally arranged
in their chronological order can be at
tributed to the fact that these poems
were pirated and published by men
who had to take them as they could
get them. Shakespeare himself left
no statement which would aid in solv
ing the problem.
Fall Into Three Groups
Classified through the method of
fctudy used by Dr. Feuillerat the son
nets fall into three groups, each
group more finished than its prede
cessor. The periods of production are
approximately fixed as 1593 to 1594
for the first group, 1594 to 1595 for
the second group, and 1596 to 1599
for the third group.
"The sonnets of the third group are
the most perfect and unified," de
clared Dr. Feuillerat. "They are medi
tative in tone and the sub-breaks in
the theme and the metrical construc
tion coincide. They present three
claar-cut, separate theme parts all
bound and rounded into a polished
whole. No lines are forced nor does
the thought run riot, ignoring the
quatrain divisions, as is found to be
jthe case in some of the sonnets of
the second group. The sonnets of the
first group were written during the
period when Shakespeare was also
writing the Rape of Lucrece."

Dr. Feuillerat will give his next
lecture on "Shakespeare and Lyrical
Poetry, The Story in the Sonnets," at
4:15 o'clock Wednesday in the Little
Theatre.

Classified through the method of
fctudy used by Dr. Feuillerat the son
nets fall into three groups, each
group more finished than its prede
cessor. The periods of production are
approximately fixed as 1593 to 1594
for the first group, 1594 to 1595 for
the second group, and 1596 to 1599
for the third group.
"The sonnets of the third group are
the most perfect and unified," de
clared Dr. Feuillerat. "They are medi
tative in tone and the sub-breaks in
the theme and the metrical construc
tion coincide. They present three
claar-cut, separate theme parts all
bound and rounded into a polished
whole. No lines are forced nor does
the thought run riot, ignoring the
quatrain divisions, as is found to be
jthe case in some of the sonnets of
the second group. The sonnets of the
first group were written during the
period when Shakespeare was also
writing the Rape of Lucrece."

Dr. Feuillerat will give his next
lecture on "Shakespeare and Lyrical
Poetry, The Story in the Sonnets," at
4:15 o'clock Wednesday in the Little
Theatre.
That Shakespeare's sonnets are not
merely literary exercises as has been
contended by certain groups of critics
was the thesis held by Dr. Feuillerat
in the second of his brilliant series of
lectures. Dr. Feuillerat claims that
the sonnets are true lyric poems for
they are filled with their author's
emotions and intimate feelings. They
are the only productions of Shake
speare's pen in which he uses the
pronoun "I."
Uses New Method of Attack
The proofs advanced by Dr. Feuil
lerat were numerous and made a
strong case. He said that efforts made
in the past to arrange the sonnets in
chronoligal order had failed because
the method of attacking the problem
was based on a study of the subject
content of the sonnets. Dr. Feuillerat
used a method of attack based on a
close analysis and comparative study
of the similarities and dissimiliarities
of technical construction and segre
gated certain characteristics of liter
ary composition. It might be explained
that the reason Shakespeare's son
nets were never originally arranged
in their chronological order can be at
tributed to the fact that these poems
were pirated and published by men
who had to take them as they could
get them. Shakespeare himself left
no statement which would aid in solv
ing the problem.
