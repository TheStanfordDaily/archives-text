# PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY HEARS LECTURES ON TWO LITERARY TOPICS
## 
### 
Two subjects were presented at the
meeting of the University Philological
Association Thursday evening in the
Women's Clubhouse. Professor A. C.
Baugh discussed the "Romance of
Athelstan," a legend preserved in a
Fourteenth Century manuscript. The
material is thoroughly English and
shows a firmer unity than is usual in
English romances. The author, too, is
revealed as an artist in construction,
for the finished product is superior to
its sources.
Professor Fernand Baldensperger's
topic was: "Les difficulty d'6tablir
un texte de Vigny: le journal d'un
poete." Editors have interpreted Al
fred de Vigny according to their own
temperaments. Mistakes have been
made, also, through insufficient evi
dence, and through the difficulty of
reading the poet's idiosyncratic jot
tings in small notebooks.
Professor Baldensperger is not only
a critic, but a poet as well, and has
published several volumes of verse
under the name of Fernand Baldenne.
A number of the most recent poems
owe their inspiration to America.
