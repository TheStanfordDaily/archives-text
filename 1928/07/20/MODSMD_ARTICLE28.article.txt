# FIFTY COUPLES ENJOY ROBLE CLUB DANCE ON BALCONY WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
About fifty couples attended the 7
to 8 o'clock dance given by Roble
Club Wednesday evening. The infor
mal was held on the balcony which
projects out from a lobby and reading
room on the second floor of Roble
Hall. This porch is familiarly known
as "The Deck" and overlooks Lagu
nita.
Gay-colored lanterns were strung
from one balcony to another and fur
nished the chief lighting effect. Porch
swings and chairs added to the gen
eral impression of a summer informal.
George Tackabury's five-piece orches
tra supplied the music for the affair.
Arrangements were in charge of Anne
Mahoney assisted by a committee ap
pointed from women living in Roble
Hall. Other dances of a similar na
ture are planned during the Summer
Quarter.
