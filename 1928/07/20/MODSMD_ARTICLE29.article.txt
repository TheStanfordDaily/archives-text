EVA'S APPLES. By William Ger
hardi; Duffield & Co., New York
(1928).
The esoteric Mr. Gerhard! has pro
duced another sophisticated novel to
charm those who are, like their soph
istication, framed in satire, fantasy,
and humor. However, there is lacking
the palling note of weariness which
was so obvious in his novel, "Futility."
Perhaps William Gerhardi no longer
takes himself so seriously, or per
chance, his sense of humor refused
to be downed. Touches of a mad
gaiety season the rather bulky pill
of disillusionment.
The involved love affairs become
entangled to such an extent that one
is never definitely sure just exactly
who is having an affair with whom —
but it soon develops that it is a ques
tion of who is having affairs with
whom.
Gerhardi waxes a bit philosophical
and expounds the idea the "higher
life is attained by converting matter
into radiation, disintegrates the atom,
causing life to evaporate, to eat itself
up." He does not become eloquent or
verbose about his theories so they do
little harm. One has merely to skip
a few pages and go on with the story.
Many of his characterizations seem
very real, but no so conspicuously
human that they become detailed and
hence banal. The seemingly created

types are amusing and lend a charm
of freshness to the work. People
whose morals are, shall we say, a bit
tattered, always have the enchant
ment which comes with nonconform
ity. There are many tattered morals
in the.book, but they are treated with
a nonchalance and humorous tone of
resignation which lends an element
of naturalness to their exceptionali
ties.

"Eva's Apples" is well written and
at times slightly lyrical, but this does
not seem to be the product of obvious
effort. The style flows steadily and
only ripples over the rough places; it
is one of those books which just
seems to have happened without go
ing through the labor of conception.

There is something sardonical about
the work. The ironies are of the more
gentle sort, yet behind the kindly
cynicism one is aware of a bitterness
which is born of contempt. It is a
story written with a smile which
borders on a sneer, with a laugh
which evolves from a jeer. It is the
concept of a man who suffers from
a too keen power of observation.

This is a powerful book, because
the author did not intend it to be "a
smashing story." One feels that it
was not written to stir the souls of
men or to reveal life in its ugliness.
It is one of those books that interests
its readers. —Laird Doyle.
