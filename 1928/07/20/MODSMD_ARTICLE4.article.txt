given at Branner Hall oil Monday
evening at 8 o'clock, as the fourth
concert of the summer series by Dor
othy Crawford, Anna Young, and
Patricia Morbio. There will be no ad

The three singers, who call them
selves "The Throstles," an old Eng
lish word for thrushes, dress in old
time frocks, with an array of bobbing
curls and a "ribband" or two. The
stage pictures add much to the enter
tainment, for it seems as though
lovely portraits have stepped for a
moment from their gilt frames to as
sume the characters of the various
personalities in the ballads.
Songs in Keeping With Names
Deborah, Abigail, and Phoebe are
the quaint names by which the sing
ers appear on the program, and the
old English songs chosen are quite in
keeping with these names.

groups: rustic songs such as "It Was
a Lover and His Lass,", songs of ad
vice, solos, songs of battle, and dance
measures such as "Over the Hills"
and "If I Were King."

Praised in San Francisco
A recent concert was given by "The
Throstles" at the Fairmont Hotel In
San Francisco. The San Francisco
Examiner says of this concert:
"It was as if the ladies of 'Cran
ford' or 'Quality Street' had come into
a bequest and were making music out
of sheer gladness of heart for the
pleasure of their friends. There was
something of the archness of Dolly
Varden in it, a spice of Jane Austen,
with something added in the way of
piquancy that is pure American."

A recent concert was given by "The
Throstles" at the Fairmont Hotel In
San Francisco. The San Francisco
Examiner says of this concert:
"It was as if the ladies of 'Cran
ford' or 'Quality Street' had come into
a bequest and were making music out
of sheer gladness of heart for the
pleasure of their friends. There was
something of the archness of Dolly
Varden in it, a spice of Jane Austen,
with something added in the way of
piquancy that is pure American."
A program of old songs will be
given at Branner Hall oil Monday
evening at 8 o'clock, as the fourth
concert of the summer series by Dor
othy Crawford, Anna Young, and
Patricia Morbio. There will be no ad
mission charge.
The three singers, who call them
selves "The Throstles," an old Eng
lish word for thrushes, dress in old
time frocks, with an array of bobbing
curls and a "ribband" or two. The
stage pictures add much to the enter
tainment, for it seems as though
lovely portraits have stepped for a
moment from their gilt frames to as
sume the characters of the various
personalities in the ballads.
Songs in Keeping With Names
Deborah, Abigail, and Phoebe are
the quaint names by which the sing
ers appear on the program, and the
old English songs chosen are quite in
keeping with these names.
The songs are divided into five
groups: rustic songs such as "It Was
a Lover and His Lass,", songs of ad
vice, solos, songs of battle, and dance
measures such as "Over the Hills"
and "If I Were King."
Players Popular
Of "The Throstles," Dorothy Craw
ford is a pianist, actress, and com
poser, whose compositions are being
sung by Isa Kremer, Louis Graveure,
and Eva Atkinson.
Anna Young has sung in several
opera companies and was chosen to
sing Musetta in "La Bolieme" at the
first performance of the San Fran
cisco Opera Company.
Patricia Morbio was one of the most
popular singers in the overseas enter
tainment service during the war and
since then has been soloist with the
Los Angeles Philharmonic Society, at
one time singing Desdemona in
"Othello," with Lawrence Tibbett as
lago.
