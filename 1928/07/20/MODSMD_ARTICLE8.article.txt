# ALLEN WILL PRESENT NUMBERS FROM VARIED NATIONALITIES SUNDAY
## Selections Included From Jarnefelt, Karg-Elert, Nesbitt, and Widor 
### 
The organ recital to be given Sun
day evening at 7:30 o'clock in the
Memorial Church by Warren D. Allen,
University organist, opens with the
"Vesper Processional" by Harvey B.
Gaul. The following number, "Har
monies du soir," by Karg-Elert, illus
trates how this most important figure
in modern German organ music re
flects the French impressionistic
school.
Julian Nesbitt'a "From Hebrid
Seas" is represented on the program
by two selections: "See Plaint" and
"Sea Surge."
Of interest is the "Praeludium in
F," by Armas Jarnefelt, one of the
two eminent Finnish composers of
the present day. This sprightly orches
tral number is designed upon an ela
borate contrapuntal basis having as
jts foundation the "basso ostinato" of
(he early instrument writers upon
whose themes reiterated insistently
bar after bar an involved texture of
thematic entrances is invented.
Mr. Allen will also play the An
dante from Widor's "Gothic Sym
phony," and he will conclude this pro
gram with the massive and stately
Pontifical March from the "First Sym
phony," by Widor.
