The Service is the Same
JF you drove up to our station and just asked
for a tire valve, you would get the same cour
teous treatment as if you bought gasoline, had the
oil changed, had the car greased, had the car
washed, or bought a can of oil.
"Service That is Service and
Then Some" is Our Motto
We handle Richfield gasoline and oilâ€”
the best for your car.
