# HOOVER GREETED IN STUDENT RALLY
## LARGE CROWD OF ENTHUSIASTS JOIN PARADE TO WELCOME ALUMNUS ON RETURN TO STANFORD CAMPUS Impromptu Band Aids Former Yell-Leader Robert Fraser In Directing Songs and Yells; Nominee Addresses Procession 
### 
riIHE Stanford man, Herbert Hoover, was greeted last night by the students
of his alma mater. Standing on the front porch of his home on San Juan
Hill, amid the flares which revealed hundreds of enthusiastic people who
had turned out for this spontaneous demonstration, he expressed in a few
words his close feeling toward these students. "I deeply appreciate this
reception from my own college men," he said. "A man would rather receive
a welcome from his own university than from any other group."
The rally, for such it was, rivaled even many of the big football demonstra
tions held here in the last few years. An enthusiastic crowd gathered in the
Union court at 7 o'clock and, under the auspices of a committee appointed
by Templeton Peck, Summer Quarter student body president, was organized

>for the parade which was to march
up the Row a few minutes later. A
short talk was given by Bob Fraser,
former yell-leader and Rally Commit
tee chairman, on the purpose of the
rally. Several yells were given, then
the parade proceeded up the Row to
ward San Juan Hill aud the Hoover
home.
Band Leads Parade
An impromptu band, composed en
tirely of freshmen, led the parade.
Marching to the tune of various Stan
ford songs, the crowd continued up
Lasuen with more people joining the
procession at each cross-street. A.
huge sign with the words "Welcome
Home Hoover" was carried in the
parade and provided an excellent ex
ample of the spirit which prevailed
throughout the demonstration.
By the time the procession had
reached the summit of San Juan Hill,
darkness had set in. From then on
the march to the Hoover residence
was made by the light of flares. The
crowd proceeded through the garden
to the doorway of his home. Cheers
arose spontaneously from the throng,
and continued for several minutes.
Finally Herbert Hoover appeared on
the porch; the applause increased,
the light of the flares revealed on
this man's face an expression of evi
dent pleasure. He said but a few
words to the crowd which had gath
ered in a semi-circle in front of the
steps, but what he said was with pro
found sincerity and the group before
him realized it.
Mrs. Hoover Speaks
Hoover remained on the porch for
a short space of time while photo
graphers got a few close-up shots.
Finally Mrs. Hoover joined him; this
was the signal for another outburst
from the crowd. When they at last
quieted down, Hoover announced to
the throng that Mrs. Hoover would
do the talking for the family. In her
characteristically charming manner
she declared their happiness at re
ceiving a welcome of this kind from
the Stanford Student Body. "I am
sorry we cannot invite you all in for
a glass of lemonade and a piece of
cake, but there are too many of you
for us to be really hospitable," she
said.
The Republican candidate looked
better last night than he has at any
time since his arrival here. The rest
at home on the Farm seems to have
relieved the strain and pressure which
he lias been under for the past month.

the porch; the applause increased,
the light of the flares revealed on
this man's face an expression of evi
dent pleasure. He said but a few
words to the crowd which had gath
ered in a semi-circle in front of the
steps, but what he said was with pro
found sincerity and the group before
him realized it.
Mrs. Hoover Speaks
Hoover remained on the porch for
a short space of time while photo
graphers got a few close-up shots.
Finally Mrs. Hoover joined him; this
was the signal for another outburst
from the crowd. When they at last
quieted down, Hoover announced to
the throng that Mrs. Hoover would
do the talking for the family. In her
characteristically charming manner
she declared their happiness at re
ceiving a welcome of this kind from
the Stanford Student Body. "I am
sorry we cannot invite you all in for
a glass of lemonade and a piece of
cake, but there are too many of you
for us to be really hospitable," she
said.
The Republican candidate looked
better last night than he has at any
time since his arrival here. The rest
at home on the Farm seems to have
relieved the strain and pressure which
he lias been under for the past month.
riIHE Stanford man, Herbert Hoover, was greeted last night by the students
of his alma mater. Standing on the front porch of his home on San Juan
Hill, amid the flares which revealed hundreds of enthusiastic people who
had turned out for this spontaneous demonstration, he expressed in a few
words his close feeling toward these students. "I deeply appreciate this
reception from my own college men," he said. "A man would rather receive
a welcome from his own university than from any other group."
The rally, for such it was, rivaled even many of the big football demonstra
tions held here in the last few years. An enthusiastic crowd gathered in the
Union court at 7 o'clock and, under the auspices of a committee appointed
by Templeton Peck, Summer Quarter student body president, was organized

>for the parade which was to march
up the Row a few minutes later. A
short talk was given by Bob Fraser,
former yell-leader and Rally Commit
tee chairman, on the purpose of the
rally. Several yells were given, then
the parade proceeded up the Row to
ward San Juan Hill aud the Hoover
home.
Band Leads Parade
An impromptu band, composed en
tirely of freshmen, led the parade.
Marching to the tune of various Stan
ford songs, the crowd continued up
Lasuen with more people joining the
procession at each cross-street. A.
huge sign with the words "Welcome
Home Hoover" was carried in the
parade and provided an excellent ex
ample of the spirit which prevailed
throughout the demonstration.
By the time the procession had
reached the summit of San Juan Hill,
darkness had set in. From then on
the march to the Hoover residence
was made by the light of flares. The
crowd proceeded through the garden
to the doorway of his home. Cheers
arose spontaneously from the throng,
and continued for several minutes.
Finally Herbert Hoover appeared on
the porch; the applause increased,
the light of the flares revealed on
this man's face an expression of evi
