halls.

The school will be conducted for
one week. Classes are to last for an
hour and a half each, one hour for
lecture and a half hour for discussion.
Three courses are to be given this
year, "Membership Maintenance and
Finance," by Joseph F. Leopold, of
Ihe U.S. Chamber of Commerce; "The
Chamber of Commerce with a Small
Staff," by Colvin B. Browu, of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the

disposal. The tuition charged is fifty
dollars, which includes everything for
the week of instruction.
Classes are to be conducted in one
of the Encina dining halls. There are
