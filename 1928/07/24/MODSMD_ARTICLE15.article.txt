Last night's demonstration for Hoover was fine in that it was a spon
taneous show of student enthusiasm. With a little more co-operation,
however, the thing would have gone off more nearly with the smoothness
expected in such things at Stanford.
Whatever lack of co-operation there was. was occasioned by the fact
that a certain group of self-appointed leaders, unwittingly disregarding
the proper channels through which a rally should he organized, started out
yesterday morning to organize the affair.
Let it he understood here and now—that there is an organized Student
Body for the Summer Quarter. This Student Body has its own officers,
who are perfectly capable of handling the plans for any student under
taking that is to be held during the Summer Quarter. The President of
the Summer Quarter Student Body may be reached by phoning Palo Alto
2900 and asking for Temp Peck.
And let it be understood here and now —that when plans are under
taken for any sort of student affair the co-operation of every member of
the A.S.S.U. is needed to make these plans a success. We cannot half lie
walking in one direction and half in another, and expect to get anywhere.
Now let's get together and stay together. We all have a big job ahead
of us for the next few weeks, and it is going to be plenty of work.
