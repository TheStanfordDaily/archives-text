# Conduct Befitting
## 
### 
Stanford is famous for the hospitality she extends to all her guests.
People who come in contact with the University have never failed to men
tion it. We are proud of this reputation, and as the eyes of the nation will
be on us for the next three weeks, it is important that this reputation he
upheld.
Since his arrival. Herbert Hoover has already held conferences with
Governor C. C. Young, Senator Hiram Johnson, and Samuel Shortridge
and other prominent men of this state.
During Hoover's stay here prominent personages from all parts of the
country will confer with him at his home. Thousands of other people will
view the Campus before the notification date. Students will come in con
tact with them often.
Courtesy is such a small thing, and yet it always impresses, always
pleases. Everyone connected with Stanford is glad that Herbert Hoover
chose his alma mater for the official notification of his nomination for the
presidency. To show our pride in this famous alumnus, the least we can
do is extend every possible courtesy to his friends and visitors on the Cam
pus, and make them our guests as well as his.
