# An Example For Others
## 
### 
A group of Stanford students last night exhibited what seems to us to
be the "true Stanford spirit." This group of men, about eight in number
and so fat as we know all freshmen, on the spur of the moment organized
a band to lead the music for the Hoover rally. Not only did they organize
the band, but they did everything in their power throughout the evening to
carry out the instructions of the parade leaders.
This all seems to us to be worthy of the most sincere commendation.
We take this opportunity to thank them for their aid.
