Sunday a Japanese dirigible was forced to make a landing in the sea
off Kyushu. The crew was all taken off in small boats, with no casualties.
They stood by while one of the officers returned to inspect the air-ship.
This officer returned to ship, lit a candle, and began exploring the in
terior of the hydrogen filled bag. Result â€”explosion. Fortunately no one
was hurt.
There is no moral to this tale. At least, we won't try to make one.
