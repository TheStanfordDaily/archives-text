Stanford men and women gave a
great welcome to Herbert Hoover,
the Republican candidate for Presi
dent of the United States, and the
first Stanford alumnus to be nomi
nated for this high office. He is cor
rectly termed Stanford's Most Famous
Wan.
Hoover's history and the early his
tory of the University are closely
connected for the young University
left its imprint on Hoover just as
young Hoover left his imprint on the
University. He was an ordinary, nor
mal boy and had his difficulties just
the same as the college men of today
have their troubles,- but he handled
these difficulties in a wiser manner
than the average college man.
The fact that this was a new Uni
versity was probably what gave
Hoover his chance. He was a shy
youth, not yet seventeen, when he
first came to Stanford. He came here
because he could study under John
Casper Branner, one of America's
leading teachers of geology and min
ing, and because he would not have
to pay tuition.

He was a youth who thought*, who
was interested in Stanford, and who
always had the welfare of the Uni
versity at heart. He liked the air of
democracy at Stanford and strove
j successfully to protect it when he
1 thought certain things were arising
that endangered it. He did this by
entering into politics. When he en
) tered politics he was not in the lime
: light, hut had a position that required
| hard work, that of treasurer. He did
this job in the quiet, efficient manner
j that has characterized his work in
later life.
Herbert Hoover had to earn his
own way like many of the students
today. Unlike many of today's stu
dents he didn't do the customary
things that every student that works
his way through college is supposed
to do. Instead he thought up new
ways to make money. How he sold
San Francisco papers and organized
a laundry agency are things that are
in every story about Hoover. In doing
these things and in the other work he
| did he showed that, same capacity for
'organization which has carried him
so far.
Thn| seems to us to be the differ
! ence between Hoover and the average
student of today. He has a faculty for
organization which enables him to. do
a great deal more work in the same
amount of time. He worked his May

through college, did well in his class-1
work, and took an active interest in ,
rtudent activities. On the side he had
time for romance.
We were glad to know that Hoover
as a student had difficulty with cer
tain studies, the same as many stu- !
dents today. Hoover had difficulty '
with English and literature. He final- j
ly managed to get through the Eng- >
lish courses by hard work. He proh- j
ably had the same thoughts that
many of us have when we are taking
a course than we can't seem to "get."
We were glad to welcome Hoover, j
not because he is a man in the J
public eye, but because we believe j
that he is a typical Stanford man. ;
We felt glad of the opportunity to ;
greet him as a Stanford alumnus be- J
cause we know that he went through I
the same trials and tribulations that
we are now going through, and there- j
fore we have a common bond. The
only thing that we regret is that we
were not endowed with his genius—
his ability to work and to organize.
