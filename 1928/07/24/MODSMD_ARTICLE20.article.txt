# CHANGE IS NOTED IN ART WORK OF SIMON; FIERCE REALISM GONE
## 
### Laird Doyle 
Even the most casual of observers |
of the work of Howard Simon, now ;
on display at the Alcove Bookstore, :
would be able to distinguish the
change that his art has undergone, j
Gone are the fiercely realistic pic- !
turizations of his Paris days, the sor- j
did subjects of his year ift New York, '
and in their place has come an atten
tion to detail, a perfection of form,
and a high degree of delicacy about
his work.
One is still conscious of his exotic j
styles which almost seem to border |
on orientalism. He has not lost his
fascination for unusual characters.
There has always been and always
will be a strangeness about Simon's
work which is undefinable. He is pho
tographic, yet characterizes in an ex
pressionißtic manner.
Outstanding Pencil Sketch
The most outstanding picture in the !
exhibit is a pencil sketch, "The Mad
Sculpture." In this there is to be
found the strangeness which lends
enchantment to Simon's creations. It
is a picture cast in repose, however
one is aware of the madness sug
gested in the title merely by an odd
framing of the eyes. It is a depiction
of talent and insanity expressed by a
pair of eyes and a pair of hands.
Howard Simon, as a San Francisco
artist, has arrived with the publica- i
tion of his wood-block book, which j
will be put on sale sometime this fall.
He should be recognized as one of
the leaders in the field of contempor
ary workers in wood. This book, to
which the art critics are looking for
ward to with great expectancy, is
"Rabelais," which is being introduced
by the famous Windsor Press.
Deserts Color
Simon has deserted color, his old
mistress, and has found himself in
the realm of sketching and woodwork.
Nevertheless, he has been doing ex
ceptional work in San Francisco in
the field of portrait painting.
There is a distinctness about Si- j
mon's art which marks them as his; j
the heavy background, the positive !
lines, the line agreement, and decided
form, are all characteristic of Simon. !
There is a variety of subject, but a 1
consistency of treatment.

pair of eyes and a pair of hands.
Howard Simon, as a San Francisco
artist, has arrived with the publica- i
tion of his wood-block book, which j
will be put on sale sometime this fall.
He should be recognized as one of
the leaders in the field of contempor
ary workers in wood. This book, to
which the art critics are looking for
ward to with great expectancy, is
"Rabelais," which is being introduced
by the famous Windsor Press.
Deserts Color
Simon has deserted color, his old
mistress, and has found himself in
the realm of sketching and woodwork.
Nevertheless, he has been doing ex
ceptional work in San Francisco in
the field of portrait painting.
There is a distinctness about Si- j
mon's art which marks them as his; j
the heavy background, the positive !
lines, the line agreement, and decided
form, are all characteristic of Simon. !
There is a variety of subject, but a 1
consistency of treatment.
Even the most casual of observers |
of the work of Howard Simon, now ;
on display at the Alcove Bookstore, :
would be able to distinguish the
change that his art has undergone, j
Gone are the fiercely realistic pic- !
turizations of his Paris days, the sor- j
did subjects of his year ift New York, '
and in their place has come an atten
tion to detail, a perfection of form,
and a high degree of delicacy about
his work.
One is still conscious of his exotic j
styles which almost seem to border |
on orientalism. He has not lost his
fascination for unusual characters.
There has always been and always
will be a strangeness about Simon's
work which is undefinable. He is pho
tographic, yet characterizes in an ex
pressionißtic manner.
Outstanding Pencil Sketch
The most outstanding picture in the !
exhibit is a pencil sketch, "The Mad
Sculpture." In this there is to be
found the strangeness which lends
enchantment to Simon's creations. It
is a picture cast in repose, however
one is aware of the madness sug
gested in the title merely by an odd
framing of the eyes. It is a depiction
of talent and insanity expressed by a
pair of eyes and a pair of hands.
