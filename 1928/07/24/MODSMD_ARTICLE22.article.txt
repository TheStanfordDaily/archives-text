# COLLOIDS SUBJECT OF LECTURE BY VISITING SCIENCE PROFESSOR
## 
### 
Yesterday Professor Lepeschkin
lectured on the "Colloidal State of
Substances and Colloidal Properties
of Protoplasm." He said that colloid
nature explains many phenomena of
life and at the same time it explains
the phenomena of death. Every sub
stance can be transformed to a col
loidal state. Colloidal particles cannot
be seen under an ordinary microscope,
although certain varieties can be seen
under an ultra-microscope. Some col
loids can be dissolved in water. Those
which cannot be dissolved can be dis
persed by means of electricity. "Col
loids separate and are dispersed very
slowly in comparison with molecular
dissolved substances. The colloid par
ticles cannot spread in water," Pro
fessor Lepeschkin said.
The phenomena of colloidal proper
ties of proplasm are most-liquid. This
fact the scientists illustrated by
means of drawings and experiments.
He showed that it is the strong coagu
lation of protoplasm which causes it
to die. The weak coagulation will not
harm it.
Dr. Lepesclikin's Friday afternoon
lecture was devoted to a discussion of
living matter and its structure. "Liv
ing protoplasm," he declared, "is an
emulsion, the living cells uniting at
an angle of 120 degrees." It was for
merly thought that they were irregu
larly placed but the very regular form
of three angles constituting a center

is the uniform structure of the sex
tagional cells.
This afternoon Professor Lepesch
kin will continue with the lecture of
yesterday. He will discuss especially 1
the action of poisonous substances on ,
protoplasm and the colloidal solution
of substances forming protoplasm. |
