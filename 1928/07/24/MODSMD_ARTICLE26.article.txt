# ORGAN RECITAL TODAY AT MEMORIAL CHURCH TO FEATURE PRELUDES
## Allen Will Repeat Program Sunday in Addition to Request Numbers 
### 
j Today's organ recital, given in the
Memorial Church at 4:15 o'clock, is
! composed entirely of Preludes. The
! opening number is the Prelude to De
bussy's "The Blessed Damozel," which
|is a cantata for female voices and
won the Prix de Rome. The text is
, based on Rossetti's poem which tells
the story of the maid who looked out
"from the gold bars of Heaven." This
composition was arranged by Palmer
Christian who, it will be remembered,
played in recital here last November.
I Chopin's "Prelude in C Minor"; the
| Prelude from the "Ninth Violin So
! nata," by Corelli, the first great vio
jlinist; and a Prelude by Clerambault
jare included on this program. The
number by Clerambault is of interest
as he was a Parisian contemporary
of Bach, who will be featured in the
next recital.
! Wagner's Prelude to "Lohengrin"
I closes this recital. It is in this num
ber that Wagner's exalted romanti
cism finds an ideal expression. In this
Prelude there is but one theme, a con
templation of the hero, his coming
from Monsalvat, the domain of Parsi
fal, his father, and his return thence.
The recital on Thursday at 4:15
p.m. will consist of compositions by
Johann Sebastian Bach. The follow
ing numbers will be played: "The
Blessed Christ Is Risen Today," Re
joice Now, All Ye Christian Men,"
"March from 'Dramma per Musica',"
"Ariosa in A Major," "Chorale Pre
lude, In Thee Is Gladness."
This recital will be repeated Sunday
evening. At this time a few "request"
numbers will be added.
