# SMALL BOY UNINJURED AS CARS HIT BICYCLE
## 
### 
One small boy, name unknown, had
a miraculous escape from injury in an
accident last night on the highway
one mile south of Palo Alto.
Sunday autoists had begun the usual
procession back to San Francisco. On
a bridge south of Palo Alto one of
the San Francisco bound cars collided
with a southbound autoist. Between
the two cars was the youth on a bi
cycle.
Although one cars was de
molished and the - other oue went
through the bride rail, the boy was
tossed up in the air and alighted a
few feet from the crash unhurt. Three
people in the cars were slightly cut
by flying glass and traffic was held
up for three quarters of an hour be
fore a tow car could clear away the
wreckage.
There must be something in guar
dian angels after all!
