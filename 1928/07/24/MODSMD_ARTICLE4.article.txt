# "Throstles" Entertain With Program of Old French, English Songs
## Vocal Artists Are Effective Actors; Present Songs In Vivid Manner 
### 
With a simplicity that can be at
tained by only the most competent
and finished artists, "The Throstles"
took a Stanford audience in Branner
Hall last evening into the spirit of a
century ago through their program of
Old English and Old French songs
Not only are these three artists,
[ Dorothy Crawford, Anna Young, £<:»d
! Patricia Morbio, accomplished vocal
| artists, but they are effective actors
|as well, and they surrounded their
1 songs with the appropriate atmos
j pbere, whether the setting was the
; family drawing room or the decks o:
| battleships and pirate raiders.
The number that called out the
heartiest applause was the "Songs of
Battle" group, with its dramatic ap
peal to the imagination through voice
; and action, both presenting vividly
the stirring tide of pitched battle.
Most dramatic of all was the seat
fight between man-of-war and pirate
raider. At other times the mood was
that of a decorous family drawing
room, with songs for the guests, and
ladylike employement at the embroi
dery frame.
Versatility was demonstrated by
i the trio in the way that each at times
played the accompaniment, all sang
solos, and all united in various com
binations in duets.
The program was divided into five
groups, each characterized by appro
priate action and sung in a manner to
transport the listeners into the very
' heart of the characters whose lives
were interpreted in the old ballads.
The mother's advice to her daughters
in the "Songs of Advice" group was
as adequately brought out in voice
and gesture as was the forthright di
rectness of the old-time peasants in
their native folk-songs on heath and
in woods of Old England.
This program was the fourth of the
Monday evening music series offered
to the Summer Quarter students and
faculty in Branner Hall.
