# DIVERSIFIED PROGRAM MARKS LAST CONCERT OF ITALIAN DIRECTOR
## 
### 
Roguish humor, side by side with
sublime religious majesty, were two
component parts of Bernardino Mo
linari's diversified program Sunday
afternoon at the Woodland Theatre.
This concert, which was the fifth
of the San Mateo Philharmonic So
ciety's summer symphony recitals,
marked the final Hillsborough appear
ance this year of the distinguished
Italian conductor.
Although his first two orchestra
tions were historically and technically
interesting, Signor Molinari's reading
of the Strauss symphonic poem, "Till
Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks," and
the still better known overture to
"Tannhauser" captured the enthusias
tic approval of his audience, llis first
number, "Spring," from "The Four
Seasons," for string orchestra, organ,
and cembalo, by Vivaldi, is an original
transcription of Molinari's. The Haydn
Symphony in G major, with four move
ments, was well received.
Molinari, who proved himself Sun
day to be a specialist in tone quality,
rather than volume, gave a stirring
interpretation of the Wagner over
ture. The work adapts itself to sonor
ous treatment, and the Italian con
ductor brought out new and satisfying
nuances of color.
Richard Strauss, In his "Till Eulen
spiegel," at once propounded the
world's most humorous, and still un
solved, musical riddle at the same
time that he conceived his rollicking
programatic comedy of music. Molin
ari, in his direction of the Strauss
score, caught the spirit and animal hu
mor that predominates in the compo
sition.
Ossip Gabrilowitsch, conductor of
the Detroit Symphony, has been en
gaged by the Philharmonic Society
of San Mateo to conduct the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in the
next Sunday concert to be given in
the Woodland Theatre.
