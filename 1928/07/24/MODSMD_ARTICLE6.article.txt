# RUSSIAN PLAY PROMISES TO BE SUCCESS
## Davis Adds Finishing Touches To Friday's Production "The Chief Thing" 
### 
As the date for the presentation of
"The Chief Thing" draws near, it be
comes more obvious that Gordon
Davis will be able to claim a perfect
interpretation of the Russian play.
Unless some unforeseen trouble arises
the difficult philosophical comedy
will be handled to perfection. Davis
by the dint of intense reheajsal has
arranged to carry a cast of over thirty
people on the stage at one time and
to move them through their actions
without losing the balance.
Contrasting Characters
The force of the play not only lies
in its philosophical depth, but also in
its many contrasting characters. The
distinctive clarity of the play depends
upon the positiveness of these char
acterizations. Irving Frohlich, who is
playing the part of the stage director,
is doing an interesting portrayal.
There is a decisiveness about his
work which leads to a hardened char
acterization. Frohlich is at home be
hind the footlights and there is little
doubt that his performance on Friday
will not be one lacking in certainty.
Olga Spirito, who is to play a tem
peramental actress, is expected to
make a positive impression upon the
audience. There is a lack of conscious
effort about her work and a natural
ness which makes her most effective j
on a stage. In "The Lady and the
Rose" she created a concrete charac-1
ter which was outstanding; and again
she ought to furnish the same de
pendability.
Asa Douglas, who is to be intro
duced for the first time on any stage,
has developed to the place where he
should carry his part as well as any
member of the cast. He lacks the
confidence gained by experience, but
there is little doubt that his ability
will overcome this disadvantage.
Experienced Players in Leads
Lloyd Nolan, Lucie Bentley, Julia
North, and Donald Cluxton furnish
the true strength of the play. All of
them have been playing for some
time and all have carried leads. One
may feel safe that they will be able
to carry the weight of the play with
out wavering. However, "The Chief
Thing" is the type of a play which
can not be forced over by a few good
actors; if it is a success, it is due to
the entire cast. Its failure may de
pend on any one player.
In three weeks Harold Helvenston
has created the most unusual sets
ever exhibited on the Stanford stage.
He has not only built the set, but he
has made the costumes, constructed
the furniture, and developed a com
plicated system of selective lighting.
Fantastic Symbols Used
The decorative idea of the produc
tion is not only to embody the spirit
of the play and scenes, but the indi
vidual actors by the use of fantastic
symbols. The physical conception of
the set is often obliviated by the sheer
chromatic distribution. "The Chief
Thing," as far as sets are concerned,
will be the most startling and bizarre
ever used in a production of this type.
The lighting is so arranged that it
mystifies the observer.
In one set Helvenston promises to
produce two more doors than were
used in "Seven Keys to Baldpate."
Helvenston's work has far sur
passed that of any other creations
witnessed on the campus. This is the
first time that a set in its entirety
has been created by the technical de
partment. It is also the first time that
a college has introduced innovations
before the professional stages.
Ed Smith, dramatic manager, an
nounces that there will be a cast
dance after the performance Friday
which will be held in the Women's
Clubhouse after the play. The danc
ing will last until 1 o'clock.
