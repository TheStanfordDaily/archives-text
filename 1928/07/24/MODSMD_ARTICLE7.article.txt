# HOOVER FAMILY HEARS SUNDAY'S SERMON IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## Small Army of Cameramen Take Pictures of Party After the Service 
### 
A large congregation gathered Sun
day in the Stanford Memorial Church
to hear a sermon by the Rev. Boyce
Tupper. The church was filled early
with an unusual number of people for
the summer season, who, if they were
attracted by the prospect of seeing
Herbert Hoover and his family did
not evidence any undue curiosity in
that respect.
Secretary Hoover, with Mrs. Hoover
and their son, Allan, came in incon
spicuously during the singing of the
first hymn and took their seats quietly
in the pew occupied by President and
Mrs. Wilbur.
The Reverend Mr. Tupper, although
avowedly pro-Hoover, delivered a ser
mon which did not touch on politics.
"The Blessedness of the Godly" was
the Psalm he chose to read. For the
text of his sermon the Reverend Mr.
Tupper chose John vii; 17, "If any
man will do his will, he shall know
of the doctrine, whether it be of God,
or whether I speak of myself." He
went on to speak for a fuller accept
ance of "The consciousness of God,"
and declared college communities,
from the student standpoint particu
larly, too often based their beliefs
upon opinion rather than upon knowl
edge. Dignified reference to the sor
row of the Hoovers was made when
the Reverend Mr. Tupper asked the
comfort of religion "if there be any
r.orrow."
'Vhen the presidential candidate
and his family came out after the ser
mon they were besieged by a small
army of cameramen who insisted
upon several poses before the party
could proceed to the Hoover home.
