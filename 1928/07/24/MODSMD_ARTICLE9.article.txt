# Many Correspondents On Campus Handling News About Hoover
## Fraternity Houses Changed Into Headquarters For Journalists 
### 
Newspaper men sent, from news
agencies all over the United States
are on the campus during Hoover's
stay. The Phi Psi fraternity house
has been turned into a press building
where the Western Union and the
Postal Telegraph have branches.
Other correspondents are being
housed at the Gamma Phi, Sigma Nu,
Theta Xi, and Alpha Tau Omega
houses, while a few have their quar
ters at the Cardinal Hotel in Palo
Alto.
Fifteen reporters and four news
reel photographers came on the spe
cial train with Hoover from Wash
ington, D.C., according to W. J. Col
lins, assistant superintendent of the
United States Senate press gallery,
who was in charge of all the press
arrangements for the Hoover tour.
The newspaper men saw Hoover
about an hour every day. He kept
carefully off the subject of politics
and talked mostly of his personal ex
periences.
Gives Reminiscences
One of his reminiscences was of
the time he was working under the
U.S. Geological Survey. One of the
horses in the outfit died, and, making
out the affidavit required by the gov
ernment, Hoover gave as the cause
of the horse's death the fact that the
horse was scratching his head with
his hind foot and in doing so caught
his hoof in the harness. Hoover had
to stand the loss of the horse himself
because the government wouldn't
recognize the fact that a horse ever
scratches his head with his hind foot.
Visit Coolidge
Hoover and the newspaper men got
off to see Coolidge at Superior. They
described Coolidge's summer retreat
as being surrounded by three rows of
barbed wire fence and with several
systems of guards. Hoover staged two
days to talk with Coolidge and fish
with him. After one of these fishing
trips, when Hoover caught eighteen
fish, Coolidge admitted that the Sec
retary of Commerce was a better
fisherman than he.
Collins said that Hoover was a
changed man when the train finally
got on California soil. Before he was
a bit reserved but as soon as he
reached California he expanded and
became more genial as the proud host
showing someone through his home.
Crowds Mob Platforms
All along the trip police were
needed to keep people from crowding
too close to the platform during stops.
The biggest crowd gathered at
Cheyenne. Hoover had three stenogra
phers and his private secretary,
George Akerson, with him on the
train.
The press men will stay here as
long as Hoover does and will return
to Washington on the special train
with him.

The biggest crowd gathered at
Cheyenne. Hoover had three stenogra
phers and his private secretary,
George Akerson, with him on the
train.
The press men will stay here as
long as Hoover does and will return
to Washington on the special train
with him.
Newspaper men sent, from news
agencies all over the United States
are on the campus during Hoover's
stay. The Phi Psi fraternity house
has been turned into a press building
where the Western Union and the
Postal Telegraph have branches.
Other correspondents are being
housed at the Gamma Phi, Sigma Nu,
Theta Xi, and Alpha Tau Omega
houses, while a few have their quar
ters at the Cardinal Hotel in Palo
Alto.
Fifteen reporters and four news
reel photographers came on the spe
cial train with Hoover from Wash
ington, D.C., according to W. J. Col
lins, assistant superintendent of the
United States Senate press gallery,
who was in charge of all the press
arrangements for the Hoover tour.
The newspaper men saw Hoover
about an hour every day. He kept
carefully off the subject of politics
and talked mostly of his personal ex
periences.
Gives Reminiscences
One of his reminiscences was of
the time he was working under the
U.S. Geological Survey. One of the
horses in the outfit died, and, making
out the affidavit required by the gov
ernment, Hoover gave as the cause
of the horse's death the fact that the
horse was scratching his head with
his hind foot and in doing so caught
his hoof in the harness. Hoover had
to stand the loss of the horse himself
because the government wouldn't
recognize the fact that a horse ever
scratches his head with his hind foot.
Visit Coolidge
Hoover and the newspaper men got
off to see Coolidge at Superior. They
described Coolidge's summer retreat
as being surrounded by three rows of
barbed wire fence and with several
systems of guards. Hoover staged two
days to talk with Coolidge and fish
with him. After one of these fishing
trips, when Hoover caught eighteen
fish, Coolidge admitted that the Sec
retary of Commerce was a better
fisherman than he.
Collins said that Hoover was a
changed man when the train finally
got on California soil. Before he was
a bit reserved but as soon as he
reached California he expanded and
became more genial as the proud host
showing someone through his home.
Crowds Mob Platforms
All along the trip police were
needed to keep people from crowding
too close to the platform during stops.
