# STADIUM PLANS FOR AUGUST 11 PROGRESSING
## System of Amplifiers Being Installed; Speeches To Be Broadcast 
### 
Available information at this time
ahows that work and plans for the
Hoover notification ceremonies, which
will be held in the Stanford stadium
August 11, are now being pushed for
ward. Arrangements are being made
on the basis of a capacity crowd.
No tickets will be necessary to
gain entrance to the stadium. Alfred
R. Masters, Chairman of the Com
mittee on Policing, will use the same
system of parking and traffic control
that is used at the annual Big Game.
A large force of ushers will be on
hand to aid in seating the people in
the stadium.
Professor Frederick G. Tickell of
the mining department, with George
Jess of the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company, is supervising
the installation of an elaborate sys
tem of loud-speakers in the stadium.
Present plans call for all of the horns
to be placed over the speaker's stand
at the south end of the bowl. This
system will be tested, and if it is
found lacking other horns will be
placed wherever necessary in the
stadium.
Loud Speakers Only Temporary
The loud-speakers which are being
installed now are only temporary. A
permanent installation will be made
before the start of the football sea
son next fall. It was impossible to ob
tain the permanent equipment in time
for the notification.
The speaker's stand is being built
in at the south end of the stadium.
The stand will be like a stage set up
on the bank of the seats. From this
position the speakers will be visible
to all parts of the stadium. Hoover
and all of the members of the official
notification party will be seated on
the platform, and all of the speeches
will be made from there. The stage
will be large enough to seat about
one hundred people.
Speeches To Be Broadcast
Under the present plans the
speeches will be broadcast by radio
over the entire country, in the same
manner as was the Republican con
vention. Microphones will be placed
on the platform for the radio as well
as for the loud-speaker system.
The official party, or at least a part
of it, including Hoover, will probably
enter the stadium by automobile, com
ing down the track straightaway and
circling the stadium once before going
to the speaker's stand.
Highway May Be Closed
Masters announced yesterday that
if the highway officials will permit it,
the State Highway running through
Palo Alto will be closed during the
crowded hours, as it is on Big Game
Day. This will be a big help to the
handling of the traffic at the notifica
tion. The entire traffic problem will
be in the hands of the same men who
have controlled it for the California
and Pasadena games.
The exact time for the notification
has not as yet been announced. Pre
liminary plans were for 4 o'clock, but
it is now rumored that 5 o'clock will
be selected to make the Eastern
broadcasting of the speeches come
during a more favorable hour.

Hoover notification ceremonies, which
will be held in the Stanford stadium
August 11, are now being pushed for
ward. Arrangements are being made
on the basis of a capacity crowd.
No tickets will be necessary to
gain entrance to the stadium. Alfred
R. Masters, Chairman of the Com
mittee on Policing, will use the same
system of parking and traffic control
that is used at the annual Big Game.
A large force of ushers will be on
hand to aid in seating the people in
the stadium.
Professor Frederick G. Tickell of
the mining department, with George
Jess of the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company, is supervising
the installation of an elaborate sys
tem of loud-speakers in the stadium.
Present plans call for all of the horns
to be placed over the speaker's stand
at the south end of the bowl. This
system will be tested, and if it is
found lacking other horns will be
placed wherever necessary in the
stadium.
Loud Speakers Only Temporary
The loud-speakers which are being
installed now are only temporary. A
permanent installation will be made
before the start of the football sea
son next fall. It was impossible to ob
tain the permanent equipment in time
for the notification.
The speaker's stand is being built
in at the south end of the stadium.
The stand will be like a stage set up
on the bank of the seats. From this
position the speakers will be visible
to all parts of the stadium. Hoover
and all of the members of the official
notification party will be seated on
the platform, and all of the speeches
will be made from there. The stage
will be large enough to seat about
one hundred people.
Speeches To Be Broadcast
Under the present plans the
speeches will be broadcast by radio
over the entire country, in the same
manner as was the Republican con
vention. Microphones will be placed
on the platform for the radio as well
as for the loud-speaker system.
The official party, or at least a part
of it, including Hoover, will probably
enter the stadium by automobile, com
ing down the track straightaway and
circling the stadium once before going
to the speaker's stand.
Highway May Be Closed
Masters announced yesterday that
if the highway officials will permit it,
the State Highway running through
Palo Alto will be closed during the
crowded hours, as it is on Big Game
Day. This will be a big help to the
handling of the traffic at the notifica
tion. The entire traffic problem will
be in the hands of the same men who
have controlled it for the California
and Pasadena games.
The exact time for the notification
has not as yet been announced. Pre
liminary plans were for 4 o'clock, but
it is now rumored that 5 o'clock will
be selected to make the Eastern
broadcasting of the speeches come
during a more favorable hour.
