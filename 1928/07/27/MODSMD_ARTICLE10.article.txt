# HOOVER COMPLETES PREPARATIONS FOR FISHING EXCURSION
## 
### 
Secretary Hoover is overhauling his
fishing tackle in preparation for his
excursion to the Klamath river. Plans
for the trip, which will start early
Saturday morning, have been com
pleted in all details, including perti
nent advice to the newspaper "boys"
who will accompany the nominee.
The party will go in automobiles
driven by Stanford professors who
are familiar with the route. First stop
will be made at Bull Flat, on the Eel
river, where all hands will be taken
care of in a big camp. The second
day will be taken up with a drive
â€¢along the Redwood Highway into Ore
gon and back over the California line
to Yreka and thence to the Klamath
river fishing grounds. Then will come
a day or two of fishing and relaxation
and the party will return home, stop
ping the first night at Shasta City,
and then continuing to Stanford by
way of the Sacramento Valley. They
will arrive here about August 3.
The Hoover party will not travel
in a caravan but will meet at given
stops for the night and at the Hoover
camp on the Klamath. There will be
no speeches made en route, although
numerous towns along the way have
extended invitations to Hoover to
stop. George Akerson, Hoover's secre
tary, explained that in view of the
number of these invitations it would
be impossible to accept any of them,
as the secretary wishes to make this
trip one of complete rest.
The prospect of the excursion
seemed to put Hoover in a genial
mood, for in response to the query of
one of the reporters as to what they
should wear he said, "Wear what you
have on, but take a change in case
you should fall in the water."
