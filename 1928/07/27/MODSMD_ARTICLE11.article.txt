## 
### 
The Standard Oil Ford plane, "The
Standard of California," arrived at the
Palo Alto School of Aviation field yes
terday afternoon, and returned to
Mills field at 5 o'clock. The plane is
an all-metal tri-motored monoplane
capable of a cruising speed of 95 miles
per hour, and has accommodations
for fourteen passengers. The passen
gers have an unobstructed view of the
scenery because of the large windows.
A wash room in the rear of the plane
is one of the unique features.
This is the second big plane to use
the Palo Alto field since its enlarge
ment. Last week the Richfield twelve
passenger fokker brought Louis
Mayer, of the Metro-Goldwyn studio,
and his family from Los Angeles to
Stanford for luncheon with Herbert
Hoover at his home on the campus.
