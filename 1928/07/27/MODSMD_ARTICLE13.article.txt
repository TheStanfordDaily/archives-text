# PALO ALTO TO GREET HOOVER TODAY
## PARADE 10 TERMINATE TRIP BY MACHINE DOWN PENINSULA Route Outlined For Return Journey From San Francisco Gives Many Opportunity To See Presidential Nominee 
### 
Palo Alto will welcome Herbert C. Hoover, Republican nominee
for the presidency, this afternoon at 5 o'clock. This reception was
postponed from last Friday, the date of his arrival from Wash
ington. The Palo Alto ceremony will culminate a procession down
the peninsula. The route outlined for the Hoover caravan's en
trance into Palo Alto will give the maximum number of people an
opportunity to see the nominee. The automobiles will follow the
highway through Menlo Park, turning there into Ravenswood

'avenue and entering Palo Alto by the
Middlefield Road bridge, and coming
to the Circle via University avenue.
The point of an "official" homecom
ing reception with speeches having
been removed by the fact that Hoover
has been at his campus residence for
several days, his arrival at Palo Alto
this afternoon will be regarded mere
ly as his return to his own city from
his San Francisco visit, and the for
malities that were planned for his
actual homecoming and that were pre
vented by the death of Mrs. Hoover's
father will be dispensed with.
Mayor Frank G. Hoge will join the
Hoover party before it enters Palo
Alto and ride with it through the city.
The procession, preceeded by a police
guard and the band, will move slowly
down University avenue so that all
may have a chance to see and greet
the nominee.
San Francisco Receives
Today is the day set apart by the
candidate for his public receptions.
He will take a train for San Francisco
at Palo Alto at 10:51 o'clock, arriving
at the Third and Townsend depot at
11:35. From there a parade will take
him to the city hall where a brief
welcome will be given by Mayor
Rolph and acknowledged by Mr.
Hoover. The San Francisco reception
is a result of Mayor Rolph's visit to
Hoover on Tuesday afternoon. Rolph
said: "I am here to extend San Fran
cisco's compliments to the next presi
dent, and to invite him to a reception
in his honor to be held in San Fran
cisco Friday noon."
Hoover and his party will leave
San Francisco after the welcome and
return to Palo Alto in automobiles.
They will stop at Burlingame, where
the candidate will be the luncheon
guest of George T. Cameron, pub
lisher of the San Francisco Chronicle.
Another stop will be made at Red
wood City to allow Mayor Henry
Beeger to extend that city's greetings.
From there they will go directly to
Palo Alto.
Leaders Call
Hoover has been receiving the
visits of various Republican leaders
during the week, who bring him en
couraging reports. Among the callers
were Henry Robinson, former mem
ber of the Dawes Commission; Wil
liam J. Donovan, assistant to the
United States attorney general; and
Charles L. Neumiller, Chairman of
the California Republican Central
Committee.
Donovan expressed high hopes of
the candidate's success. He said, "Up
state New York is showing great en
thusiasm for Hoover. I think he will
carry New York because of this and
because he will cut into the city vote.
Women throughout the country are
interested in the coming election.
Chicago people are highly encour
aged by Hoover's showing. The East
takes the election result of California
for granted."

Chief Magistrate Wm. McAdoo of
New York is advocating fines for
"jay-walkers" as well as motorists.
