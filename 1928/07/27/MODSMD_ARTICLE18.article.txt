Stanford University is now one of
the news centers of the world, al
though the average student sees very
little difference from the day he first
entered. Long before Herbert Hoover
returned to his home on the campus,
work was going on to prepare frater
nity houses and homes into headquar
ters for newspaper men. Telephones
were installed, impromptu telegraph
offices were arranged, and everything
was planned for the convenience of
the reporters who were to follow
Stanford's first presidential candi
date.

i
•' Every day news is going out to
every place in the United States from
Stanford University. More than sixty
men are employed here to collect and
send out news to the outside world.
Some of these are newspaper men,
part of whom are sent by papers of
different parts of the country and part
by news services. Some are telegraph
operators and some are camera and
news-reel men.

The newspaper men have been fol
lowing politics for a long time and
have been with Hoover on his trip
West. Most of them have covered
other presidential campaigns and
know just what to expect. They know
a great deal about the two candidates
and have every possible issue firmly
in mind. Some of these men repre
sent one paper and others represent
two or three. These men must se. d
out at least one story a day of what
Hoover is doing or is going to do.
The men who work for news bureaus
must keep up with things for twenty
four hours a day. They must have
stories on the wire for the different
papers that their news bureau serves.

They seem to lead an easy life.
Nothing to do but write one story or
so a day, but their life isn't all a bed
of roses. Some of them have left
families «n the East to come out here
because it was part of their work.
Others are taking it as a lark or a
vacation. They all seem to be glad
to be at Stanford because they are
well-satisfied with the arrangements
that have been made for them. They
think Stanford is a fine University
and think the climate and the view is
wonderful.

Like every group they have their
practical joker who helps them to

pass away the time, although fre
quently his method is not so pleasant.
His favorite joke is to ring everyone's
bell at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Horseshoes, golf, viewing the scen
ery, playing pool, and talking are
among the pleasures that tlie news
papermen use to pass away the hours.

These men will follow Hoover until
the election is over and keep the
world informed of every move of
Stanford's most famous son. They all
seem to like Hoover which somewhat
fulfills the prediction that Hoover is
a man that you must know pretty
well to appreciate all of his qualities.
They say that they are gradually
finding it easier to talk to Hoover,
but their idea is that he is not a
politician and therefore does not like
all of the backslapping that is cus
tomarily expected of a candidate.
They say he will sell himself to the
United States on what he has done
and what he is capable of doing, not
on how well he can talk about it.

We are glad that all of the men
who are here to tell the world the
news are pleased with the reception
that they have received. Although
they consider that coming here is all
in a day's work and rather common
place, despite the fact that it seems
exciting to us, we hope that if they
are covering the next presidential
election four years from now that
they will look back and say, "Well, I
certainly enjoyed the time I spent at
Stanford University in the campaign
of 1928. I would like to go back to
that place sometime." We hope they
do pay us a visit sometime.

to be at Stanford because they are
well-satisfied with the arrangements
that have been made for them. They
think Stanford is a fine University
and think the climate and the view is
wonderful.

Like every group they have their
practical joker who helps them to

pass away the time, although fre
quently his method is not so pleasant.
His favorite joke is to ring everyone's
bell at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Horseshoes, golf, viewing the scen
ery, playing pool, and talking are
among the pleasures that tlie news
papermen use to pass away the hours.

These men will follow Hoover until
the election is over and keep the
world informed of every move of
Stanford's most famous son. They all
seem to like Hoover which somewhat
fulfills the prediction that Hoover is
a man that you must know pretty
well to appreciate all of his qualities.
They say that they are gradually
finding it easier to talk to Hoover,
but their idea is that he is not a
politician and therefore does not like
all of the backslapping that is cus
tomarily expected of a candidate.
They say he will sell himself to the
United States on what he has done
and what he is capable of doing, not
on how well he can talk about it.

We are glad that all of the men
who are here to tell the world the
news are pleased with the reception
that they have received. Although
they consider that coming here is all
in a day's work and rather common
place, despite the fact that it seems
exciting to us, we hope that if they
are covering the next presidential
election four years from now that
they will look back and say, "Well, I
certainly enjoyed the time I spent at
Stanford University in the campaign
of 1928. I would like to go back to
that place sometime." We hope they
do pay us a visit sometime.

Stanford University is now one of
the news centers of the world, al
though the average student sees very
little difference from the day he first
entered. Long before Herbert Hoover
returned to his home on the campus,
work was going on to prepare frater
nity houses and homes into headquar
ters for newspaper men. Telephones
were installed, impromptu telegraph
offices were arranged, and everything
was planned for the convenience of
the reporters who were to follow
Stanford's first presidential candi
date.

i
•' Every day news is going out to
every place in the United States from
Stanford University. More than sixty
men are employed here to collect and
send out news to the outside world.
Some of these are newspaper men,
part of whom are sent by papers of
different parts of the country and part
by news services. Some are telegraph
operators and some are camera and
news-reel men.

The newspaper men have been fol
lowing politics for a long time and
have been with Hoover on his trip
West. Most of them have covered
other presidential campaigns and
know just what to expect. They know
a great deal about the two candidates
and have every possible issue firmly
in mind. Some of these men repre
sent one paper and others represent
two or three. These men must se. d
out at least one story a day of what
Hoover is doing or is going to do.
The men who work for news bureaus
must keep up with things for twenty
four hours a day. They must have
stories on the wire for the different
papers that their news bureau serves.

They seem to lead an easy life.
Nothing to do but write one story or
so a day, but their life isn't all a bed
of roses. Some of them have left
families «n the East to come out here
because it was part of their work.
Others are taking it as a lark or a
vacation. They all seem to be glad
to be at Stanford because they are
well-satisfied with the arrangements
that have been made for them. They
