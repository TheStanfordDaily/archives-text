# FACULTY MEMBERS ASKED TO 'AT-HOME'
## 
### 
Members of the faculty are
especially invited to the Roble
tea next Tuesday afternoon from
3:30 to 5:30 o'clock. Women liv
ing in the hall are privileged to
ask instructors to the at-home.
In addition, Summer Quarter stu
dents and friends of Roble Club
are welcome.
About one hundred guests at
tended the last informal recep
tion on Tuesday. As a sideline
slant on the tea it has been re
ported that the dishes are washed
by the unfortunate women who
have received lock-outs and have
to atone for their misdemeanor.
