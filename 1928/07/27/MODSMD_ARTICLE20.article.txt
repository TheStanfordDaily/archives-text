# MRS. KAHN GIVES VIEWS ON WOMEN IN POLITICS AT TALK IN PALO ALTO
## Congresswoman Sees Victory For Republican Party In Coming Election 
### 
Whether or not women are practical
in politics depends on the precedent
established by those women who have
been the first to enter that field.
If, by hard work, ingenuity, and
diplomacy, women can prove that
they are just as capable as men in
enacting legislation, then there will
be more women representatives in
Congress. The women pioneering in
this field of activity can make or
break the future for women in poli
tics.
Describes Experiences
Thus Florence P. Kahn, Congress
woman from the Fourth District and
California's only woman member to
the United States Congress, started
in to describe her "Experiences in
Congress" when she visited Palo Alto
Tuesday and spoke before a luncheon
club.
"I feel a responsibility to all women
in America," Mrs. Kahn said, "because
what we pioneers in politics do now
will determine the success of other
women in this field. I think one of
the hardest things for any woman to
do is to eliminate the personal equa
tion. For some reason, women in gen
eral cannot segregate the personal
from the factual in any argument or
discussion."
Condemns Bloc-System
According to Mrs. Kahn one of the
worst state of affairs in politics today
is the bloc-system of voting. "It is a
most dangerous and most un-Ameri
can procedure," she declared em
phatically. "When one small group
with its special interest starts to
trade votes to get the support of an
other group and finally gets legisla
tion through, one of the foremost
principles of American democracy is
destroyed. There was a great deal of
that kind of log-rolling at this last
session of Congress, but it was only
temporary and I firmly believe that it
will be broken down entirely in this
next session.
"Surely, there is no question that
Herbert Hoover will carry the State
of California with a big majority.
With hard work and united party sup
port he should carry the entire United
States," she answered on being ques
tioned about the chances for a Repub
lican victory.
