# SHAKESPEARE POEMS ATTACKED FROM NEW ANGLE BY FEUILLERAT
## Lecturer Criticizes Sonnets From Classification of Group Structure 
### 
Dr. Feuillerat portrayed the Shake
spearean sonnets from a new angle
in his Wednesday lecture. He based
his interpretation on an original
classification of the sonnets made
through a critical study of the struc
ture of the poems.
Dr. Feuillerat traced the thread of
the story as it wound in and out
through the three groups of sonnets.
In the first group the story gets under
way and a conventional friendship
between the poet and his noble patron
is depicted. The imagery, while in
genious, is expressed in the stilted
artificial style of the day.
In the second group of poems the
friendship continues and becomes a
sincere reality based upon mutual lik
ing and respect. The style of the
poems at this stage becomes more na
tural and is free from the labored
forms of the first group.
The third group is composed in the
nature of an epilogue to the preceed
ing groups, and shows the poet's re
morse for the mistakes of his youth,
and the lessons he has learned from
them.
The Doctor pointed out that the
experiences related in the sonnets en
abled Shakespeare to write more ef
fectively in the plays, and to be espe
cially able in the treatment of the
ills of life and in interpreting the
passions. He said also that Shake
speare was the inventor of the high
est form of English sonnet, a new
form of art.
The subject of Dr. Feuillerat's lec
ture today will be "The Poetical Ele
ment in Shakespeare's Plays." It will
take place at 4:15 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
