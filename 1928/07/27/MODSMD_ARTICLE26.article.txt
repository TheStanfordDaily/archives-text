# FORMER CAMPUS STAR RETURNS TO PLAY IN PRODUCTION TONIGHT
## Lloyd Nolan Received Early Training at Stanford From Gordon Davis 
### 
Lloyd Nolan, who is playing the
lead in "The Chief Tiling," is a pro
fessional actor who has returned
again to play under Gordon Davis. He
is the second former Davis star to
come back to the Stanford stage this
summer; Betty Wilbur, who played
the part of the Queen in "The Queen's
Husband," turned down a profession
al engagement to appear again on the
stage where she was first presented.
Nolan is a member of the Class of
1926 who left Stanford in 1923 to play
a part in the Fulton Theatre. After
the conclusion of the production. No
lan took a trip around the world, and
on his return went on the Keith
vaudeville circuit with Arnold Bayley.
Bayley is an ex-Stanford man who
made a hit while on the campus with
a skit called "Radio Robut." The suc
cess of this skit at Stanford encour
aged him to take it on the profession
al stage where it met with approval.
Bayley is still playing the act on the
vaudeville stage.
Returns to Stanford
Nolan then returned to Stanford,
but not for long. He was offered a
part in "Evil Doers of Good," a play
presented in Los Angeles, and he left
the University to enter the profes
sional field of dramatics for the third
time.
Nolan's acting attracted the atten
tion of the noted Gilmore Brown of
the famous Pasadena Players and he
was given the lead in one of Clyde
Fitch's plays and in Howard Brown
son's hit, "Aristocracy." His work in
these productions warranted his be
ing given a part in the big production
of the Pasadena season, "Cyrano,"
written by Rostand. In this creation
Nolan played a most convincing vil
lain.
Plays Lead
His triumph in "Cyrano" was the
start of the number of leading parts
he played for the noted director. "The
Sunken Bell," "Wild Duck," "Bab
bitt," and "Devil's Den" were presen
tations in which Nolan played the
lead. His last work for the Pasadena
Players was "Two Gentlemen of Ve
rona." At the closing of this show he
left to play the part of Lacker in
"The Queen's Husband" with Edward
Evert Horton at the Vine Street thea
tre in Los Angeles.
After tonight's performance Nolan
plans to leave for the East where he
is going on the stage.
W T hile at Stanford Nolan scored
hits in "Captain Applejack," "The
Green Goddess," and "The Hottentot"
and other creations in which he
played the lead.
In speaking of Gordon Davis, Nolan
said: "Gordon Davis creates a sense
of tempo in his productions which is
seldom found in amateur presenta

tions. His sense of casting is remark
able and I believe Gordon Davis to
be one of the finest directors I have
ever worked under."
