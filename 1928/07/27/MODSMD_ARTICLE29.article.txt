# GOVERNMENTS OF NEW EUROPEAN REPUBLICS EXPLAINED BY REDLICH
## Says Ideal of Democracy Is Spreading Rapidly With Younger Nations 
### 
Doctor Joseph Redlich, political sci
j ence expert, and member of the Stan
ford Summer Quarter faculty, spoke
in the Little Theatre Tuesday evening
on the subject, "The Office of Presi-
Ident in the New Republics of Europe."
, "The presidency of the United
States has risen to a power and dig
nity never designed for it by the
founders of the republic," affirmed
Doctor Redlich. "Abraham Lincoln
lifted the office from the insignificant
position into which it had fallen just
prior to the Civil War to a dignity
unsurpassed since then," he said.
Europe and Democracy
Redlich went on to say that Europe
is fast moving away from an ideal of
monarchy to an ideal of democracy.
The new and untrained nations of
Europe, in struggling for autonomy,
have need of a strong hand to guide
the actions of groups that have not
exercised so much power previously.
It must be he who looks ahead for
political crises and prepares for dan
gers that the people can sense but
vaguely. If need be, he must some
times transcend his powers to save
the nation from serious mistakes. He
must have influence as well as power.
He must be capable of forming laws
in spite of opposition because of the
rapid transitions sometimes required
in a new state.
Present European Governments
According to Dr. Redlich the pres
ent government of Czechoslovakia is
undergoing a change from the form
that it at first dreamed of putting into
existence. It has had a strong guiding
hand at the head of the state govern
ment. It remains but half democratic,

and its success is due to the very ef
ficient governmental head. They have
followed in their new government,
standards set up by the republican
French and the democratic English.
Every government in Europe is un
dergoing a change. The vast socialis
tic unrest demands an outlet for its
pent-up energies. Governments must
meet these demands, not by granting
what it can ,but by the exercise of
strong executive power to hold in
check the experiments in government
that might prove too costly, is the
opinion of Dr. Redlich.

Never place a sponge in the sun to
dry, as this will cause it to rot.

opinion of Dr. Redlich.

Never place a sponge in the sun to
dry, as this will cause it to rot.
Doctor Joseph Redlich, political sci
j ence expert, and member of the Stan
ford Summer Quarter faculty, spoke
in the Little Theatre Tuesday evening
on the subject, "The Office of Presi-
Ident in the New Republics of Europe."
, "The presidency of the United
States has risen to a power and dig
nity never designed for it by the
founders of the republic," affirmed
Doctor Redlich. "Abraham Lincoln
lifted the office from the insignificant
position into which it had fallen just
prior to the Civil War to a dignity
unsurpassed since then," he said.
Europe and Democracy
Redlich went on to say that Europe
is fast moving away from an ideal of
monarchy to an ideal of democracy.
The new and untrained nations of
Europe, in struggling for autonomy,
have need of a strong hand to guide
the actions of groups that have not
exercised so much power previously.
It must be he who looks ahead for
political crises and prepares for dan
gers that the people can sense but
vaguely. If need be, he must some
times transcend his powers to save
the nation from serious mistakes. He
must have influence as well as power.
He must be capable of forming laws
in spite of opposition because of the
rapid transitions sometimes required
in a new state.
Present European Governments
According to Dr. Redlich the pres
ent government of Czechoslovakia is
undergoing a change from the form
that it at first dreamed of putting into
existence. It has had a strong guiding
hand at the head of the state govern
ment. It remains but half democratic,

and its success is due to the very ef
ficient governmental head. They have
followed in their new government,
standards set up by the republican
French and the democratic English.
Every government in Europe is un
dergoing a change. The vast socialis
tic unrest demands an outlet for its
pent-up energies. Governments must
meet these demands, not by granting
what it can ,but by the exercise of
strong executive power to hold in
check the experiments in government
that might prove too costly, is the
opinion of Dr. Redlich.

Never place a sponge in the sun to
dry, as this will cause it to rot.
