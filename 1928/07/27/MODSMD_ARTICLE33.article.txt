# CAST FOR NEXT PLAY TO BE CHOSEN MONDAY
## 
### 
Gordon Davis announced today that
tryouts for the next Campus produc
tion will be held in the Assembly Hall
July 30 from 3 to 5 in the afternoon
and from 7 to 9 In the evening. All
summer students are eligible and it is
hoped that a great number will turn
out, as an effort is being made to
reach all who are interested in dra
matics. "Right You Are if You Think
You Are" has some interesting char
acter parts that will require real tal
ent.
Stanford dramatics offer an unusual
opportunity for those interested in
plays and play production as Davis
and Helvenston are a team hard to
beat. Davis is throwing even more
than his usual vigor into his work and
acting under his direction is an edu
cation in itself, while Helvenston's
sets alone are almost enough to make
any play a success. "Right You Are
if You Think You Are" is to be the
last play of this quarter and is ex
pected to be a fitting one to cap the
climax of a most successful year.
