With Superintendent Harry R.

both instructive and enjoyable. Music
was furnished by both the women of
Pi Lambda Theta and the men's quar
tet led by Paul Brainerd. Creed F.
Bates, Principal of the Senior High

enlivened his remarks with a genuine
drawl from the South which gave his
humor an unusual tang.
The speakers of the evening were
Dr. Fred C. Ayer of the University of
Texas, and Dr. W. R. Smith of the
University of Kansas. Over one hun
dred attended the dinner.
