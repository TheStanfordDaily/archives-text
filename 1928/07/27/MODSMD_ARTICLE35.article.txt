# ABAS STRING QUARTER APPEARS SECOND TIME AT BRANNER MONDAY
## Program To Be Made Up Of Numbers From Mozart, Bloch, and Dvorak 
### 
As the last concert of the summer
series, the Abas String Quartet will
present its second program on the
campus Monday night at 8 o'clock in
Branner Hall. There will be no ad
mission charge.
The four members of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra who have
organized this quartet are Nathan
Abas, first violinist and leader; Wil
liam Wolski, second violinist; Michel
Penha, cellist; and Romain Verney,
who plays the viola.
An enjoyable concert was given by
these men at Branner Hall on July 9,
and the equally interesting numbers
which have been chosen for the final
program are Mozart's "Quartet in D
Major," Ernest Bloch's "In the Moun
tains," and Dvorak's "Quartet in E
Flat."
This is an age of quantity in com
mercial production, but conversely
the older composers were more pro
lific than have been the men of mod
ern times. Haydn wrote 100 sympho
nies, Mozart 40, Beethoven 9, and
Brahms 4.
The nineteenth century introduced
a new intensity and greater physical
dimension in music. Quantitatively
there is more thought and labor in a
modern symphony or string quartet
than in any similar work of the past.
In Mozart's "Quartet in D Major" the
improvisational lightness of the older
style is exemplified. But in the slow
movement Mozart rests a while from
his dancing elegance and creates a
deeper mood.
Bloch is recognized throughout the
world of music as a latter-day master.
He has for several years been artistic
director of the San Francisco Con
servatory of Music. The descriptive
pieces of "Dusk" and "Rustic Dance,"
which are a part of "In the Moun
tains," are among his many varied

smaller compositions.
Though Dvorak was the son of a
butcher, he lived to win himself and
his country international artistic
recognition. He carried on Smetana's
ambition to nurture a Bohemian
music. Well along in his life he
crossed national strains with the
American, and he was invited in the
nineties to conduct and teach in this
country. He became interested in
negro tunes as a folk foundation for a
national music here and wrote his
popular symphony "From the New
World."
