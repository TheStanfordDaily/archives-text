# GORDON DAVIS TO PRESENT "THE CHIEF THING" TONIGHT
## Production Is At Its Apex; Julia North and Lloyd Nolan Play Leads 
### 
As is usual after campus dra
matic productions, a cast dance
will be held following the play
tonight, according to Ed Smith,
dramatic manager. It will be
given in the Women's Clubhouse
and will last until 1 o'clock.

"The Chief Thing" is to be pro
duced tonight. The entire presenta
tion is at its apex; tonight is the
psychological time for it to be played.
If it fails, it will only be because of
one thing, and that is a complete dis
integration.
Julia North, who plays the part of
the Stenographer, should deliver the
most interesting interpretation of her
stage career. Miss North has long
been noted for her scintillating in
tensity, but this is the first time that
she has been cast in a part where
she could thrust her sheer force out
into the audience. Behind her light
and surface acting, which has won
her many leads, has crept a new
subtlety to lend added impetus to the
play.
Lloyd Nolan charges banal lines
with a startling ' (magnetism. His
scenes develop a drive which will
carry the weaker parts to a safe
foundation. Nolan, as Paraclete, will
undoubtedly deliver a creation to
show that his reputation is warranted.
Has Some Ability
Donald Cluxton has illustrated that
his long leave from the dramatic field
has not handicapped his ability. It
was feared at first that the jinks of
repression might have laid its hand
upon his work, and it took but a few
days for him to become the same
character known to the campus sev
eral years ago.
Irving Frohlich, by the dint of con
scientious study, has formulated a
characterization which should be mer
ited for its clarity and consistency.
Lucie Bentley, Carol Wynn, and Olga
Spirito are expected to render their
usual finished performance.
Fantastic Comedy
"The Chief Thing" is a wild, fan
tastic comedy, but more than that it
is a profound philosophical play. The
result is an oddly structured drama
