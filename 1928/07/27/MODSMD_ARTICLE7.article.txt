# Toyon Schedules Second Dance For Friday, August 3
## Popularity of First Dance Warrants Second; Bids Go on Sale Today 
### 
Toyon Club will give another all-
University dance next Friday, owing
to the large demand of everyone who
attended the first one. The informal
will celebrate the end of the first half
of summer school and give students
an opportunity to recuperate from
mid-quarters.
Tickets will go on sale beginning
today at the Associated Students Of
fice in the Old Union. They may also
be obtained from Bob Fraser in Room
218, Toyon Hall. Bids are available to
anyone attending summer school.
"If tickets sell as well as they did
for the first dance there is a strong
possibility that there will be none
available the night of the dance be
cause only enough bids to pay the
actual expenses of the informal are to
be sold. Consequently, I advise every
one to secure their tickets immedi
ately," Fraser said.
George Tackabury's seven-piece or
chestra, which proved to be such a
sensation at the first Toyon dance
this summer, has been engaged to
furnish the music for the informal.
The dance committee guarantees that
the dance next Friday night, to cele
brate the end of the first half of
Summer Quarter, will equal or be even
better than the last one which was
one of the best dances ever given on
the Stanford campus during the sum
mer.
