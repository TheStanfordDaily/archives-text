St. Matthew Passion presented by the
Detroit Orchestra and a choir of over
four hundred voices from several
choral clubs in New York City.
In writing of this performance, Olin
Downes in tke New York Times said,
"If Ossip Gabrilowitsch had done no
more than prepare the performance
of Bach's St. Matthew Passion which
he gave last night in Carnegie Hall,
he would have as his monument one
of the most impressive musical events
that has taken place in many seasons
in this city."
