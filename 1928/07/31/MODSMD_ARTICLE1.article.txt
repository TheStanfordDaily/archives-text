# "CHIEF THING" HELD SUCCESS IN EVERY WAY
## Nolan Scores in Character Interpretation; North Plays Hard Role Helvenston Creates Bizarre Sets of Great Detail And Complexity 
### Laird Doyle 
Qordon Davis successfully proved
that one may thumb his nose at the
conventional conception of what
should compose a play and still pro
duce a stage hit. "The Chief Thing"
was a success regarding every aspect;
from the intricated symbolism of the
sets to the playing of the profound
comedy, there was concreteness about
the play that held the scattered ma
terial together. The creation was a
patchwork of ideas from which one
could take what appealed. It was an
unreal play made real, a comedy
moulded into a philosophical idealism,
a profound expression in slang. Love,
greed, hate, idealism, and cynicisms
were so treated that they created an
atmosphere without delving into the
distorting intensity of positive action.
To Lloyd Nolan belongs the highest
praise. Nolan created three distinct
parts, yet they could not he called
three separate portrayals for he wove
through them the positiveness of a
single personality. Had he failed to
connect, it would have been three
finished characterizations, but hollow
in unity. Charlatan, monk, and polyga
mist composed in the character of a
single person, multi-action evolving
from a single impetus, one bit of
idealism expressed in many ways;
this is the part that he played. Nolan
made a complete interpretation from
this seemingly impossible maslin.
Julia North had many awkward
lines to fight against; Julia won. She
played her part in a manner which
indicated her experience; however,
this was the best piece of acting that
Miss North has ever done in her en
tire career on the stage. Pathos is a
delicate thing to handle on the stage,
for if it is overplayed it becomes
sticky with sentimentality and hence
loses its appeal, while if it is under
played it is too obscure. Miss North
struck the medium of expression.
Don Cluxton as The Lover did an
interesting piece of work in "The
Chief Thing." He drifted from noncha- j
lance into intensity with a profes- j
sional ease. It took finesse to play j
his part without becoming too obvi
ously a medium of transitions. His
adaptability is beyond reproach.
From the beginning of the play to
the end there was no character that j
marred the performance. Ethel Short, j
Virginia Volland, and Virginia Greene ;
handled a difficult scene with ease. •
Miss Greene in her few minutes on |
the stage did one of the cleverest :
pieces of acting throughout the pro- !
duction. She, as the Deaf Mute, ere- i
ated an impression with a grace and j
subtility that was remarkable. Miss j
Short was splendid in her art, but she j
possessed a single gesture which
rather blurred her superior treatment'
of the lines.
Holmes Stewart presented an over
acted characterization. This is not a j
criticism for it is due to direction.
Perhaps he might have done bis work
with more subtility, but it is also pos
sible that, had he failed to overact,
the result might have been a lack of
clarity. However, he did a solid por
trayal ; if there is any weakness in
his interpretation it is not due to
Stewart but to the direction.
Elizabeth Clark did a finished por- :
trayal. She added clarity to scenes

which might have been dimmed by
misconception. Josephson was a most
satisfying actor; his voice was out
-1 standing, but he had an odd type of
palsy which only affected the hand
which held the cane.
Olga Spirito handled her part in
a positive manner.
Lucie Bentley proved that she is a
master of stane mechanics and stage
action. She is a finished and depend
j able actress.
i To Harold Helvenston there cannot
Ibe too much praise given. Buying
i nothing, creating everything, and do
ing it. in less than three weeks, Hel
venston created the most detailed and
complex set ever seen on the Pacific
Coast. No set ever used on the Stan
ford stage has lent so much to the
production as this one did to "The
Chief Thing."

was a success regarding every aspect;
from the intricated symbolism of the
sets to the playing of the profound
comedy, there was concreteness about
the play that held the scattered ma
terial together. The creation was a
patchwork of ideas from which one
could take what appealed. It was an
unreal play made real, a comedy
moulded into a philosophical idealism,
a profound expression in slang. Love,
greed, hate, idealism, and cynicisms
were so treated that they created an
atmosphere without delving into the
distorting intensity of positive action.
To Lloyd Nolan belongs the highest
praise. Nolan created three distinct
parts, yet they could not he called
three separate portrayals for he wove
through them the positiveness of a
single personality. Had he failed to
connect, it would have been three
finished characterizations, but hollow
in unity. Charlatan, monk, and polyga
mist composed in the character of a
single person, multi-action evolving
from a single impetus, one bit of
idealism expressed in many ways;
this is the part that he played. Nolan
made a complete interpretation from
this seemingly impossible maslin.
Julia North had many awkward
lines to fight against; Julia won. She
played her part in a manner which
indicated her experience; however,
this was the best piece of acting that
Miss North has ever done in her en
tire career on the stage. Pathos is a
delicate thing to handle on the stage,
for if it is overplayed it becomes
sticky with sentimentality and hence
loses its appeal, while if it is under
played it is too obscure. Miss North
struck the medium of expression.
Don Cluxton as The Lover did an
interesting piece of work in "The
Chief Thing." He drifted from noncha- j
lance into intensity with a profes- j
sional ease. It took finesse to play j
his part without becoming too obvi
ously a medium of transitions. His
adaptability is beyond reproach.
From the beginning of the play to
the end there was no character that j
marred the performance. Ethel Short, j
Virginia Volland, and Virginia Greene ;
handled a difficult scene with ease. •
Miss Greene in her few minutes on |
the stage did one of the cleverest :
pieces of acting throughout the pro- !
duction. She, as the Deaf Mute, ere- i
ated an impression with a grace and j
subtility that was remarkable. Miss j
Short was splendid in her art, but she j
possessed a single gesture which
rather blurred her superior treatment'
of the lines.
Holmes Stewart presented an over
acted characterization. This is not a j
criticism for it is due to direction.
Perhaps he might have done bis work
with more subtility, but it is also pos
sible that, had he failed to overact,
the result might have been a lack of
clarity. However, he did a solid por
trayal ; if there is any weakness in
his interpretation it is not due to
Stewart but to the direction.
Elizabeth Clark did a finished por- :
trayal. She added clarity to scenes

which might have been dimmed by
misconception. Josephson was a most
satisfying actor; his voice was out
-1 standing, but he had an odd type of
palsy which only affected the hand
which held the cane.
Olga Spirito handled her part in
a positive manner.
Lucie Bentley proved that she is a
master of stane mechanics and stage
action. She is a finished and depend
j able actress.
i To Harold Helvenston there cannot
Ibe too much praise given. Buying
i nothing, creating everything, and do
ing it. in less than three weeks, Hel
venston created the most detailed and
complex set ever seen on the Pacific
Coast. No set ever used on the Stan
ford stage has lent so much to the
production as this one did to "The
Chief Thing."
