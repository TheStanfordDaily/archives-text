# "CHIEF THING" HELD SUCCESS IN EVERY WAY
## Nolan Scores in Character Interpretation; North Plays Hard Role Helvenston Creates Bizarre Sets of Great Detail And Complexity

Qordon Davis successfully proved
that one may thumb his nose at the
conventional conception of what
should compose a play and still pro
duce a stage hit. "The Chief Thing"
was a success regarding every aspect;
from the intricated symbolism of the
sets to the playing of the profound
comedy, there was concreteness about
the play that held the scattered ma
terial together. The creation was a
patchwork of ideas from which one
could take what appealed. It was an
unreal play made real, a comedy
moulded into a philosophical idealism,
a profound expression in slang. Love,
greed, hate, idealism, and cynicisms
were so treated that they created an
atmosphere without delving into the
distorting intensity of positive action.
To Lloyd Nolan belongs the highest
praise. Nolan created three distinct
parts, yet they could not he called
three separate portrayals for he wove
through them the positiveness of a
single personality. Had he failed to
connect, it would have been three
finished characterizations, but hollow
in unity. Charlatan, monk, and polyga
mist composed in the character of a
single person, multi-action evolving
from a single impetus, one bit of
idealism expressed in many ways;
this is the part that he played. Nolan
made a complete interpretation from
this seemingly impossible maslin.
Julia North had many awkward
lines to fight against; Julia won. She
played her part in a manner which
indicated her experience; however,
this was the best piece of acting that
Miss North has ever done in her en
tire career on the stage. Pathos is a
delicate thing to handle on the stage,
for if it is overplayed it becomes
sticky with sentimentality and hence
loses its appeal, while if it is under
played it is too obscure. Miss North
struck the medium of expression.
