# Enthusiastic Audience Welcomes Gabrilowitsch At Sunday Concert
## 
### Horace Bristol 
Ossip Gabrilowitsch, whose orches
trations have been the feature of
Hillsborough concerts since the in
ception of the summer symphonies,
was welcomed to California at the
Woodland Theatre last Sunday after
noon.
Enthusiastic applause, which was in
part a tribute to the man, part ap
preciation of the director, forced the
Russian conductor to respond time
after time before the large audience
would allow him to begin the program.
Creates Applause
When he did begin, it was only to
create more spontaneous applause
with each brilliant reading, until,
upon the conclusion of the concert,
the delighted audience refused to
leave the aphltlieater until Gabrilo
witsch reappeared.
Musically, the afternoon perform
ance was subordinated to the recep
tion given the conductor. Cesar

Franck's Symphony in D minor, which
was the most solid reading of the
program, emphasized the power and
control of the Russian musician. The
three movements, lento-allegro non
troppo, allegretto, and allegro non
troppo, are considered the ultimate in
joyous musical expression.
Tone Poem Pleases
It was the Debussy tone poem, pre
lude to "The Afternoon of a Faun,"
I
which caught the popular fancy. This
delightful fantasy of orchestral color,
utterly pagan in its pastoral sim
plicity, fitted in mood and spirit with
'the sylvan theater. Berioz's "Roman
! Carnival," from the opera based on
I the life of Benvenuto Cellini, and the
"Theme and Variations" from Tschai
j kowsky's Third Suite were the other
numbers of the afternoon.
Gabrilowitsch will direct the final
two concerts of the summer season
j for the San Mateo Philharmonic So
! ciety, which will begin at 3 o'clock
August sth and 12th.
