# KING WINS HIGH JUMP FOR U.S. AT AMSTERDAM
## Eric Krenz Takes a Fourth In Shot Put; Rothert Fails to Place Pacific Coast Stars Excel in Two Opening Events of Olympic Games 
### 
The Pacific Coast athletea, led by
Rob King, Card high jump star, on
Sunday, opened hte 1928 Olympic
Games witb a bang. The Dutch hosts,
as well as representatives of thirty
other nations, witnessed the proceed
ings in sad dismay, when a small
group of Western stars literally ran
away with the first two events by an
nexing twenty-eight of the thirty-five
points scored by the American team
that day.
King ended his college ca - v.r in a
blaze of glory by outjumping the field
in his favorite event with a leap of 6
teet 4 3-8 inches, beating out two
Eastern stars, one of whom was Har
old Osborn, defending champion com
peting under the colors of the Illinois
A ('. Many believed that King might
lenp to a world's record while visiting
Tulip Town, but he was greatly han
dicapped because of a slippery take
off.
Krenz Places
In the shot put event three men
broke the world's record of 51 feet
which has been held by Ralph Rose
of New York for many years. Two of
these men hail from the Pacific Coast,
they are John Kuck of the Los An
geles A.C., and Herman Brix, of the
University of Washington. The third
was Hirschfeld, a giant German. Kuck
won the event with a mighty toss ot'
52 feet 11-16 of an inch.
Eric Krenz, Card sophomore, took
a fourth in this event with a lieave
of over 49 feet. One of the big sur
prises of the day came when Krenz's
teammate, Harlow Rothert, who had
been doped to take at least a third in
the shot, was shut out. Rothert had
been a favorite to place ahead of
Krenz, but the best he could do was
a paltry 47 feet which didn't come
close to placing.
Other Cards to Compete
So far, members of the Stanford
track team have scored a total of
thirteen points. Before the end of the
week another Redshirt will compete
for America in the person of Captain
Bud Spencer, who will negotiate a lap
of the 400-meter relay.
Marion Holley, Stanford co-ed and
member of the American women's
track team. Pete Desjardins, diminu
tive Card diver, and Reggie Harrison,
water polo star, will also compete in
the near future for the glory of Amer
ica in the 1928 Olympics.
Further tryouts for the forth
coming play, "Right You Are, if
You Think You Are," will be held
today in the Assembly Hall from
3 to 5 o'clock and 8 to 9 o'clock.
Gordon Davis asks all who can to
try out.
