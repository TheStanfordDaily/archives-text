# The Chief Thing?

### 
Once again Gordon Davis has scored a success. This time by putting
on a most un-understandable play in an almost understandable fashion.
"The Chief Thing" was a masterpiece of directing, acting, and stage
setting. The seemingly impossible task of presenting a play with a cast
of forty campus actors has been accomplished. Davis has earned ap
plause. We take this opportunity to present it to him.
After the play we asked Davis how he happened to present this play,
when there are so many more palatable vehicles on the market. Again
Davis scored a success. "I picked this play," he said, "because it repre
sents a new type of action that is rapidly coming into vogue. I thought
it proper that we at Stanford have an opportunity to become familiar with
this new thought in dramatization." Rather than pick a sure-fire, can't
miss, tradition-bound play, Davis chose a text whose success was far
from assured, whose directing was difficult, whose interpretation, if any,
was superbly buried. He picked this play because he felt a duty to his
audience to acquaint it with the widest variety he could possibly select.
He is indeed to be congratulated in having succeeded with so difficult an
undertaking.
Another who is deserving of equal praise is Harold Helvenston,
technical director. We believe the sets for "The Chief Thing" were the
best and the most unusual that have ever been presented to the local
audience. We congrtulate Helvenston.
When the play was over we still wondered, "what is The Chief
Thing"? Now we know. The chief thing is that the play was a success.
