# The Cardinal Is Waving

### 
While Stanford is now the center of American political activities,
Amsterdam in Holland is the center of American athletic activities.
Sunday the 192S Olympic Games began. The finals in three events,
the 10,000-meter race, the shot put, and the high jump, were run off.
Stanford had entrants in two of these events and placed in both of them,
Bob King taking first in the high jump, and Eric Krenz a fourth in the
shot.
Bob was expected to cop a first, but a good many believed Krenz
would not place in the shot. It is interesting to note that Krenz is sup
posed to be weaker in this event than in the discus, yet he tossed the big
iron ball some forty-nine feet yesterday. Because of a fluke he did not
place in the discus when the Olympic tryouts were held in this country,
so we probably will not hear much more of the husky Card sophomore
for awhile.
In the meantime the Olympic Games will roll merrily along with
America bringing forth a lot of surprises for the rest of the world.
Stanford has five more representatives who will compete as members of
the American Olympic team. We hope that they will be as successful as
their teammates have been.
