One manâ€”one thousand women. How does that sound ? That is the
situation that will exist at Mount Holyoke College next fall, when the
son of one of the faculty members will take courses there preparatory to
entering Harvard,
At Stanford next fall there will be 500 women to about 2500 men.
Jn others words the odds are five to one against the men at Stanford.
At Mount Ilolyoke they will be one thousand to one in favor of the man.
Many of us here often complain of the shortage of women. Would
any of us change places?
