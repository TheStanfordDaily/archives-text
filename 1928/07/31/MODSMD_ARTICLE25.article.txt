WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Gene Tunney, who so ably defended
his heavyweight title last Thursday,
is through with the fight game, ac
cording to newspaper stories. One
story infers that he went into this
business, which was distasteful to
him, because he wanted to make
money. Now he has enough money
and will leave shortly for Europe to
study philosophy in one or more uni
versities over there.
At least he will look at the subject
of philosophy from a pleasant view
point for he will always be sure of
ihree meals a day and a cozy bed,
thanks to his unpleasant occupation.
No specific reasons were given for
the champion's retirement except
that he always disliked fighting. We
wonder what part or parts of it he did
not like. This question is especially
interesting because of the attempt
now going on to abolish this sport in
California.
Tunney should know all of the dis
advantages of this so-called barbarous
institution because he has worked his
way from the bottom to the top. Is
the whole sport rotten, as we would
be led to believe by its opponents?
It is quite easy to believe that it is
rotten because the fighters and man
agers are working to make money
and not for the glory of the affair.
Sorry, no hard feelings, Gene.
The radio story of the Tunney-
Heeney battle certainly sounded bru
tal. Although they were well paid for
their bruises, is this a very sane
amusement for a civilized country?
We do not believe that it is. However,
we do believe that fighting as an ama
teur sport should be encouraged.
But if this brutal form of amuse
ment, with all of the rotteness that
is said to be connected with it, is to
be stopped, it will probably be very
difficult to stop it with laws. The finan
cial result of the last fight is prob
ably the most effective argument that
has yet been struck. We do not know
whether the financial flop was an in
dication that the public is tired of
paying enormous sums to keep alive
a thing that should be dead or
whether it was because the fighters
did not seem equally matched.
Furthermore the fact that Tex
Rickard says that the next champion
ship battle will not be broadcast will
be a boomerang instead of a boon to
fighting, in our opinion. We also be
lieve that it is a very poor advertise
ment for this profitable business. The
argument seems to be that people
would rather sit and listen to the
fight than to go and see it. I? the
people who do not attend the fights,
either because they do not wish to
go or because they are unable to go,
are deprived of what thrill they may
get over radio, they will probably
lose all interest in the fracas.
As soon as the large mass of peo
ple lose interest in titular bouts
because money-loving promoters re
fuse to allow them to be broadcast
these fans will also lose interest in
ordinary bouts. If Rickard's idea is a
success from the standopint of build
ing up his bank account he will prob
ably use the same idea in elimination
contests.
Many people, who .ire only casually
interested in fighting and have no an

tagonism toward it, are perfectly will
ii ; to turn a knob on their radio so
that they can hear the round-by-round
story of the fracas and will discuss it
with their friends. If this is denied
them they will turn their interest to
other things, and prize-fighting will
be a forgotten sport.
We rather believe that Mr. Rick
ard's loss forecasts the doom of prize
fighting. Not the immediate doom,
it is true, but at least presages that
it is true, but at least it presages that
does that we believe that its death
will not be far distant.
When fighters learn that they will
not get fabulous sums for reverting
to the animal stage for a few brief
minutes to satisfy the savage instinct
of people who will cheer loudly as
one man or the other strikes a blow
that brings blood, then fighting will
die. The public has struck the first
blow. If it doesn't want prize-fighting
it can deal it another hard blow in
the first elimination bout.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?
Gene Tunney, who so ably defended
his heavyweight title last Thursday,
is through with the fight game, ac
cording to newspaper stories. One
story infers that he went into this
business, which was distasteful to
him, because he wanted to make
money. Now he has enough money
and will leave shortly for Europe to
study philosophy in one or more uni
versities over there.
At least he will look at the subject
of philosophy from a pleasant view
point for he will always be sure of
ihree meals a day and a cozy bed,
thanks to his unpleasant occupation.
No specific reasons were given for
the champion's retirement except
that he always disliked fighting. We
wonder what part or parts of it he did
not like. This question is especially
interesting because of the attempt
now going on to abolish this sport in
California.
Tunney should know all of the dis
advantages of this so-called barbarous
institution because he has worked his
way from the bottom to the top. Is
the whole sport rotten, as we would
be led to believe by its opponents?
It is quite easy to believe that it is
rotten because the fighters and man
agers are working to make money
and not for the glory of the affair.
Sorry, no hard feelings, Gene.
The radio story of the Tunney-
Heeney battle certainly sounded bru
tal. Although they were well paid for
their bruises, is this a very sane
amusement for a civilized country?
We do not believe that it is. However,
we do believe that fighting as an ama
teur sport should be encouraged.
But if this brutal form of amuse
ment, with all of the rotteness that
is said to be connected with it, is to
be stopped, it will probably be very
difficult to stop it with laws. The finan
cial result of the last fight is prob
ably the most effective argument that
has yet been struck. We do not know
whether the financial flop was an in
dication that the public is tired of
paying enormous sums to keep alive
a thing that should be dead or
whether it was because the fighters
did not seem equally matched.
Furthermore the fact that Tex
Rickard says that the next champion
ship battle will not be broadcast will
be a boomerang instead of a boon to
fighting, in our opinion. We also be
lieve that it is a very poor advertise
ment for this profitable business. The
argument seems to be that people
would rather sit and listen to the
fight than to go and see it. I? the
people who do not attend the fights,
either because they do not wish to
go or because they are unable to go,
are deprived of what thrill they may
get over radio, they will probably
lose all interest in the fracas.
As soon as the large mass of peo
ple lose interest in titular bouts
because money-loving promoters re
fuse to allow them to be broadcast
these fans will also lose interest in
ordinary bouts. If Rickard's idea is a
success from the standopint of build

be stopped, it will probably be very
difficult to stop it with laws. The finan
cial result of the last fight is prob
ably the most effective argument that
has yet been struck. We do not know
whether the financial flop was an in
dication that the public is tired of
paying enormous sums to keep alive
a thing that should be dead or
whether it was because the fighters
did not seem equally matched.
Furthermore the fact that Tex
Rickard says that the next champion
ship battle will not be broadcast will
be a boomerang instead of a boon to
fighting, in our opinion. We also be
lieve that it is a very poor advertise
ment for this profitable business. The
argument seems to be that people
would rather sit and listen to the
fight than to go and see it. I? the
people who do not attend the fights,
either because they do not wish to
go or because they are unable to go,
are deprived of what thrill they may
get over radio, they will probably
lose all interest in the fracas.
As soon as the large mass of peo
ple lose interest in titular bouts
because money-loving promoters re
fuse to allow them to be broadcast
these fans will also lose interest in
ordinary bouts. If Rickard's idea is a
success from the standopint of build
ing up his bank account he will prob
ably use the same idea in elimination
contests.
Many people, who .ire only casually
interested in fighting and have no an

tagonism toward it, are perfectly will
ii ; to turn a knob on their radio so
that they can hear the round-by-round
story of the fracas and will discuss it
with their friends. If this is denied
them they will turn their interest to
other things, and prize-fighting will
be a forgotten sport.
We rather believe that Mr. Rick
ard's loss forecasts the doom of prize
fighting. Not the immediate doom,
it is true, but at least presages that
it is true, but at least it presages that
does that we believe that its death
will not be far distant.
When fighters learn that they will
not get fabulous sums for reverting
to the animal stage for a few brief
minutes to satisfy the savage instinct
of people who will cheer loudly as
one man or the other strikes a blow
that brings blood, then fighting will
die. The public has struck the first
blow. If it doesn't want prize-fighting
it can deal it another hard blow in
the first elimination bout.
