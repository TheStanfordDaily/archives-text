The Editor, Sir:
I take this means of bewailing the
lark of enthusiasm and indifference of
the audience that viewed "The Chief
Thing" the other night.
Gordon Davis, Harold Helvenston,
and the cast outdid themselves in try
ing to make the play go over. But
the audience was apathetic and did
not respond much to their efforts.
This 1 consider disgraceful. The spec
tators at the last play, "The Queen's
Husband," made the thing a wow
with their handclapping and general
vivacity. When the audience is re
sponsive it arouses the actors to do
better work and so a better time is
had by all.
Whether the deadness of the audi
ence in this case was due to a natural
stolidity or to a mere disinterested
ness I don't know, but I do think that
everybody would have had more fun
if the spectators had shown more pep.
Perhaps an innovation in the way of
an organized rooting section or a
hired claque might be a good thing.
—Holdover.
The Administration building was the
gift of Thumas Welton Stanford, brother
of the Founder, and was the library. Be
fore its erection the University library
was housed in the building now used as
the law library, which is now too small
ieven for that use. A library building had
just been completed but had not been
occupied when the earthquake destroyed
it. The foundation of this building is
still visible in the field near the power
house.
