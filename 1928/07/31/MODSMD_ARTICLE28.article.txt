# POETICAL ELEMENT IN SHAKESPEARE IS TEXT OF FEUILLERAT TALK
## Playwright Holds Mirror To Life; Places Reality Above The Poetic 
### 
"The Poetical Element in Shake-
Bpeare's Plays," Dr. Feuillerat's title
for his fourth lecture, introduced a
most interesting story of struggle in
the life of one of the world's great
figures. The problem which Shake
speare, the dramatist, had to solve,
was within himself, for his natural
tendency was to give the "poet" un
limited sway and to neglect the rigid
requirements of the drama.
The playwright must hold the mir
ror up to life; he cannot seem to
exaggerate or distort reality; his prod
uct must be realistic, and if it can
also be great poetry, so much the
better. To effect such a synthesis,
Shakespeare had to go through a long
period of effort from which he
emerged a single, balanced, literary
personality in whom all elements
were in a harmonious equilibrium —
the great poetic dramatist.
Steps in Development
What are the steps in this develop
ment? Dr. Feuillerat states them to
be as follows: First, Shakespeare
wrote such poems as "Venus and
Adonis," "The Rape of Lucrece," and
the "Sonnets," which were poetical
and lyrical in style. Next come the
satirical comedies, the farces and
comedies of manners and they are an
obvious mixture of the poet and the
realist. From them Shakespeare
turned to the writing of the romantic
comedy, a favorite form with him. In
this field he excelled, combining ex
traordinary adventures, a happy set
ting, and a wide play of fancy, with
reality. In "As You Like It" and "The
Merchant of Venice," we find the
poet and dramatist in most perfect
balance.
Historical Plays Next
The historical plays were next writ
ten. This field of work affords less
freedom of treatment and Shake
speare surmounts the difficulty by
magnifying his characters, for by do
ing so he is enabled to introduce the
romantic and poetic elements. Dr.
Feuillerat says, however, that in
Richard 111 the poet predominates,
while in Richard 11, the dramatist pre
vails. In the "Henries," by making
the kings great heroes, the treatment
can be an epic in spirit but realistic
in effect. Thus the poet and the dra
matist are again brought into har
mony.
Two phases mark the writing of
the tragedies; a period of pre-tragedy
■ —man pitted against man —in which
was produced Hamlet and Othello,
and the period of his two greatest
tragedies, namely Macbeth and King
Lear. In these latter the idea of fate
mysteriously at work is to be noted.
Great poetry, philosophy, and analyti
cal psychology enter into these
dramas. The poet and the playwright
are one. King Lear is the summit of
all Shakespeare's productions, ac
cording to Dr. Feuillerat.

■ —man pitted against man —in which
was produced Hamlet and Othello,
and the period of his two greatest
tragedies, namely Macbeth and King
Lear. In these latter the idea of fate

Great poetry, philosophy, and analyti
cal psychology enter into these
dramas. The poet and the playwright
are one. King Lear is the summit of
all Shakespeare's productions, ac
cording to Dr. Feuillerat.
Dr. Feuillerat will lecture next
"Wednesday at 4:15 o'clock in the
Little Theatre. His subject will be
"New Light on Sir Phillip Sydney."
"The Poetical Element in Shake-
Bpeare's Plays," Dr. Feuillerat's title
for his fourth lecture, introduced a
most interesting story of struggle in
the life of one of the world's great
figures. The problem which Shake
speare, the dramatist, had to solve,
was within himself, for his natural
tendency was to give the "poet" un
limited sway and to neglect the rigid
requirements of the drama.
The playwright must hold the mir
ror up to life; he cannot seem to
exaggerate or distort reality; his prod
uct must be realistic, and if it can
also be great poetry, so much the
better. To effect such a synthesis,
Shakespeare had to go through a long
period of effort from which he
emerged a single, balanced, literary
personality in whom all elements
were in a harmonious equilibrium —
the great poetic dramatist.
Steps in Development
What are the steps in this develop
ment? Dr. Feuillerat states them to
be as follows: First, Shakespeare
wrote such poems as "Venus and
Adonis," "The Rape of Lucrece," and
the "Sonnets," which were poetical
and lyrical in style. Next come the
satirical comedies, the farces and
comedies of manners and they are an
obvious mixture of the poet and the
realist. From them Shakespeare
turned to the writing of the romantic
comedy, a favorite form with him. In
this field he excelled, combining ex
traordinary adventures, a happy set
ting, and a wide play of fancy, with
reality. In "As You Like It" and "The
Merchant of Venice," we find the
poet and dramatist in most perfect
balance.
Historical Plays Next
The historical plays were next writ
ten. This field of work affords less
freedom of treatment and Shake
speare surmounts the difficulty by
magnifying his characters, for by do
ing so he is enabled to introduce the
romantic and poetic elements. Dr.
Feuillerat says, however, that in
Richard 111 the poet predominates,
while in Richard 11, the dramatist pre
vails. In the "Henries," by making
the kings great heroes, the treatment
can be an epic in spirit but realistic
in effect. Thus the poet and the dra
matist are again brought into har
mony.
