# HENRY E. MUNROE TO ADDRESS LAW SCHOOL
## 
### 
Henry E. Monroe, president of the
San Francisco Bar Association, will
speak at a meeting of the Stanford
Law School Association at 7:30
o'clock Thursday evening. He will dis
cuss some of the problems with which
the young lawyer is confronted when
he leaves the law school and embarks
on his own practice. Mr. Monroe and
his family are living on the campus
this summer.
The Law School Association, which
is sponsoring the meeting, is made up
of all students registered in the law
school. The president of the associa
tion announces that all others who
may be interested are invited to this
meeting.
The new edition of Grove's "Dic
tionary of Music and Musicians" is,
according to the New York Times,
"so valuable that no one intelligently
interested in music ought to be with
out it."
