# FLOATING UNIVERSITY REGISTRATION CLOSES IN ONE MORE MONTH
## 
### 
Professor Henry David Gray of the
English department is anxious to re
mind Summer Quarter students that
there is only a month left in which to
register for the Floating University
which will leave New York October 6.
In order that there will be no un
certainty about accommodations this
year, the ship will be selected after
registration closes so that its size may
correspond to the number of students.
The minimum charge for the eight
months' cruise is $2500. This includes
every expenseâ€”passports, vises, tui
tion, and trips ashore. Regular univer
sity and pre-collegiate credit will be
given for courses completed during
the trip. Every course fitted to use
the travel facilities to educational ad
vantage will be given.
The faculty has been chosen from
universities and colleges all over the
United States and from four foreign
countries. Two of the faculty members
are Stanford professors: Henry David
Gray, professor of English, and Lee
Emerson Bassett, instructor in public
speaking.
All those desiring more detailed in
formation concerning the cruise are
urged to see Dr. Gray in Room 212 of
the English building as soon as pos
sible.
"I believe in the idea very heartily,"
said Professor Gray, speaking of the
Floating University. "I believe it is a
really great thing."
