# CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE INCENTIVE TO SUMMER STUDYING SAYS BAUGH
## Visiting Professor Notices Spirit of Co-operation Among Students 
### 
"I never have taught in any place j
before where the climate was so ideal :
for summer work." This is the way j
Professor A. C. Baugh, Acting Asso
ciate Professor of English, feels
about California summers.
Professor Baugh is a visiting profes- j
sor here this summer from the Uni- j
versity of Pennsylvania to teach Me
dieval Drama and the English Novel. !
"Some of the outstanding things
that I have noticed during my stay 1
here," he said, "are the democratic ,
spirit and the friendliness and co
operation of the Stanford students. I
I like the West because of the great !
open spaces where you can get away
from civilization without the difficulty
that you find in the East."
According to Professor Bangh, the
East is very individual and it takes
a person from the West or from the
Continent about a year to get ac
quainted. Each person has his own
little circle of friends and is very re
luctant to widen it and let in anyone
else. The American visitors on the ;
Continent also find this feeling preva- ,
lent.
Professor Baugh graduated from
the University of Pennsylvania and !
received his Ph.D. from his Alma '
Mater. He has recently published j
"Century Types of English Literature" j
and "Writing by Types." These books '

are entirely technical and are for the
use of persons making a study of
English Literature. An edition of
Hardy's "Return of the Native" with
an introduction by Baugh is now on
the press and will be out shortly.
