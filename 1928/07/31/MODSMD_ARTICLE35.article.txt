# SEQUOIA AND ENCINA NOW BEING REPAIRED
## 
### 
The annual overhauling of the j
freshman dormitories started last Fri- j
day with painters and tinters working ,
in both the Encina and the Sequoia
halls. The kitchen of Sequoia is also
I being repaired.
According to Roy Button, superin- t
' tendent of buildings and grounds, the
cost of repairs to Encina will be $3000
j and the Sequoia work is estimated to
lbe $2000. Both sums exceed the |
amount spent in similar work last
j year.
The cleaning of the Statue of Lib
erty now planned by the War Depart- I
1 ment will be a colossal job, as the '
i nose is nine feet long, the finger nails j
thirteen by ten inches, and the height 1
| one hundred eleven feet, six inches.
