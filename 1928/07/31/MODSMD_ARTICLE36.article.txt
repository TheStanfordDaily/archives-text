# CONSOLIDATED PRESS CORRESPONDENT GIVES VIEWS ON JOURNALISM
## Advises Writing For Several Papers As Best Way To Develop a Style 
### 
"Don't keep all your eggs in one
basket if you hope to be successful
and independent as a journalist," says
William Hard, a prominent news
paper man who is on the campus dur
ing Hoover's stay.
Mr. Hard is well qualified to give
advice on this subject for he has at
tained an enviable position in the
literary world both as a journalist and
an interpreter of political events. He
is a special representative of the Con
solidated Press Association and has
been a Washington correspondent for
eight years. He contributes also to
many different magazines which
range from radical to conservative,
and is well known to Nation readers
through his articles "Covering Wash
ington."
Believes in Journalism
In opposition to the verdict of the
hard-boiled newspaper man he be
lieves heartily in a journalistic career
as a preparation for serious writing
because of its varied contacts witn
life in the raw. "It teaches you to
know your own country and the
psychology of the people in it," he
says. But he advises against this sort
of work for those who are contem
plating the writing of fiction, "For,"
he says, "the cold hard facts in the

newspaper world ruin the writer's
thought and style."
Advises Small Paper
Hard advises starting in on a news
paper in a town of medium size to
gain general experience and then to
graduate to a large metropolitan
paper. But in order to preserve indi
viduality and freedom he counsels
against serving but one master. He
outlined two ways of doing this:
either to own your own paper, or to
keep some cards up your sleeve by
writing for as many different publica
tions as possible, so that if you are
fired from one you still have a chance
on another.
