# APPLICATION BLANKS FOR 1928 FOOTBALL TICKETS MAILED OUT
## Summer Students Not Here Next Fall Should See Alumni Secretary 
### 
Every application under all the
classifications, except students, for
football tickets this fall has been
mailed out, according to Jacob C. Ir
win, manager of the ticket depart
ment. These applications include the
tickets for the U.S.C.-Stanford game
at Los Angeles, on November 3; the
Washington-Stanford game at Stan
ford, November 17; and the Stanford-
California game at Berkeley, Novem
ber 24.
Students who are now registered
for the summer session and who will
not be here this fall, may get applica
tion blanks by going to the Alumni
Secretary's office and there paying
their dues. Blanks will be issued to
them then. Students who intend to
register the autumn quarter will re
ceive blanks on registration day for
the above-mentioned games. There
will be a sale of rooters' tickets in
the Old Union before the U.S.C. and
Washington games.
Irwin says that some 27,000 applica
tions have been sent out. The orders
for tickets will be filled as they are
received with respect to classification.
If anyone does not receive his appli
cation within the next few days, he
should communicate with the ticket
department in the new Board of Ath
letic Control building.
The Big Game this year will be held
at Berkeley, in the University of Cali
fornia's stadium. California's stadium
has a capacity of 78,000 persons, some
11,000 less than the Stanford stadium.
However, alumni and students are
certain to secure the seats allotted
to them if they follow the application
plans as stated above.
