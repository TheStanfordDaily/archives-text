# ABAS QUARTET PLEASES WITH FINE PROGRAM
## 
### 
One of the largest audiences to at-
I tend a summer concert in Brauner
Hall greeted the Abas String Quartet
| last night at their second appearance
011 the campus this quarter.
This was the last concert of the
series, and it proved a fitting climax
to the delightful programs which
have been given.
Nathan Abas and the three mem
bers of the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra who have organized this
quartet gave a performance which
was wholly satisfying to their highly
appreciative audience.
In Mozart's "Quartet in D Major"
there was not only wonderful tech
nique but excellent interpretaation.
The depth of tone of the cello added
foundation to the whole and the en
semble was perfect.
The weirdness of the descriptive j
music of Blocli's "In the Mountains" j
contrasted with the smooth harmony j
of the first number. "Dusk" seemed !
I
to give the picture of the inaccessible I
mountain heights of the composer's \
native Switzerland. There was a ;
primitive air in the music to the dying |
away of the last tones as night de- j
scended.
"Kustic Dance," also from "In the j
Mountains," had something of the j
swing and flair of a hilarious crowd ;
of mountain merrymakers, but there j
seemed an undercurrent of menace I
or threat of unseen danger.
Dvorak's "Quartet in E Flat" was !
very colorful.. The pizzicato part of
the cello was especially pleasing in
portraying the mood, and the whole i
was so harmonious that it seemed as j
if the four instruments were one, â– 
played by one master musician.
