# BALDENSPERGER WILL GIVE LECTURE TONIGHT
## 
### 
"Republics of Europe" will be the
subject of the lecture given by Fer
nand Baldensperger of the University
of Paris at 8 o'clock tonight in the
Little Theatre. Professor Baldensper
ger is a member of the visiting sum
mer faculty in the Romanic Lan
guages department. This will be his
only open lecture.
Professor Baldensperger is a close
friend of Clemenceau, and his lecture
will be more of a series of commen
taries on contemporary situations
than of a literary nature. He will dis
cuss in particular the young Clemen
ceau, and American reconstruction in
France.
