# PLANS OF HORSE SHOW NEARING COMPLETION
## Competing Stables Arriving For Participation in Saturdays Events 
### 
Arrangements for the Northern
California Horse Show Association's
second annual show are nearly com
pleted. On Saturday, the opening day,
a matinee and evening performance
will be held.
This year the show will not be held
on the Stanford baseball diamond. A
ring has been graded, and a platform
for boxes set up inside the stall en
closure, near the new runway of the
Palo Alto School of Aviation. Some
200 stables have been erected, all of
which are signed for.
To date two stables have arrived,
and are in their quarters. The Aaron
M. Frank stables of nine head, from
Portland, Oregon, arrived last Satur :
(lav, and the Mrs. M. C. Marston
stables of three head arrived Satur
day from San Diego. Today the Carna
tion Farm's stable of Pomona with
thirty head is expected. Most of the
others are expected Thursday and
Friday.
A. P. Fleming, manager of the show,
is well pleased with the plans so far.
As this show has grown to one of the
big five in the United States in one
year, with the large purse of $21,500,
the Stanford campus, and the penin
sula are anticipating a worth-while
exhibition.
