"Vo-dodeo Dough-dough,
Vodeo-dough." SHAKESPEARE
When all the bright young men and women have passed
their final examinations, the fun really begins. Com
mencement! Solemn robes! Solemn speeches! Solemn
parents!
But gaiety afterwards, you bet! Gather all your
friends and relatives together. Get out the food! And
get out the bottles of "Canada Dry" !
This fine old ginger ale has a joyous sparkle, a rare
dry flavor which makes it the choice of college connois
seurs all over the U. S. A. Its subtle gingery taste recom
mends it to particular palates. Its pleasing carbonation
makes it go down with a gurgle of goodness. Because
"Canada Dry" is made from pure Jamaica ginger and
does not contain capsicum (red pepper), it does not
bite the tongue or leave an unpleasant after-effect. Pure,
mild, mellow . . . drink "Canada Dry" and see how
good a ginger ale can be! It blends well with other
beverages.
