# Second Presentation of 'The Queen's Husband' To Be Given August 10
## 
### 
"The Queen's Husband" is to be
produced for the second time this
quarter on the night of August 10.
Gordon Davis said, when speaking of
the production, "The demand for an
other performance commands this
second presentation. This is the first
time that a summer play has been
recalled by popular request."
The cast will remain the same with
the exception of the part of Lord
Burton formerly played by Harold
Brownson. Jack Wiggin, popular cam
pus actor, is to be cast in this part
and is expected to give his usual
finished performance.
Recognized Success
The second production should have
an almost professional finish, for it
will have a more seasoned back
ground. The first night fears will be
gone and confidence will come from
the knowledge that the play is a
recognized success.
Helvenston believes that the set
will take little time from his work on
the set for "Right You Are If You
Think You Are." The same methods
of lighting will be used.
It is expected that there will be a
large attendance to this second per
formance, for the dramatic manager's
office has already been called upon to
send tickets when they go on sale.
The evening of the production is the
night before Hoover's official notifica
tion of his nomination.
Wilbur, Davis Expected to Star
Betty Wilbur and Gordon Davis are
expected to retain their laurels won
in the first presentation. Corrine
Franklin and Dick Stewart should
give their charming work the same
scintillating touch.
Everything indicates that Robert
Sherwood's satirical comedy will be
as well, if not better, played than
before. This is one of the few produc
tions about which a positive predic
tion of success can be made.
