of easy ascent.
The observatory, which was com

which gives a chance to see the Bay
region after night.
This telescope is the second largest
refracting telescope in the world, the
objective having a clear aperture of
36 inches, and is surpassed only by
the 40-inch telescope at the Yerkes
Observatory near Chicago.
The point of suspension of the tele
scope tube is 36 feet from the floor.
The dome, which has an exterior
diameter of 76 feet, is moved by
water power, as is the observation
platform.
