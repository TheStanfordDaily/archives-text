ever to take place on the Pacific
Coast.
Hundreds of letters are pouring in
each day to the notification headquar
ters in the Palace Hotel at San Fran
cisco, requesting information as to
seating arrangements, and announc
ing the intention of individuals or
delegations to be present. Men and
women high in Republican circles
will come from all parts of the coun

Actual plans for handling the large
crowd expected, are well under way.

Board of Athletic Control, who is re
garded as an expert in the handling
of Big Game crowds, will be in active
charge of all the special work on the
Stadium in preparation for this mo
mentous event, and will also be in
charge of the traffic situation.
Work is well under way on the
erection of loudspeakers. Represen
tatives of the National Broadcasting
Association, visited the Campus yes
terday in order to collaborate their
plans for the handling of this depart
ment. They emphasized the fact that
every person who attends the cere
monies will be able to hear every
word spoken by Hoover in his notifi
cation address.
The Stadium will accommodate
nearly 90,000 people. There will be
no admission charge, and all who
wish may attend. Everyone is urged
to come early so that the ceremonies
may start promptly at 3 o'clock. There
will be preliminaries to keep the early
comers busy until the ceremonies
commence.
"A capacity crowd is expected," ac
cording to Ed Loder, Chief Engineer
for the Board of Athletic Control, who
is also a member of the committee
on traffic for August 11.
The committee hopes to have 300
ushers, 250 traffic officers, 30 state
police, and 25 policemen from the
San Francisco police force on the
grounds to handle the crowd and to
take charge of automobile parking.
So far approximately 550 men have
been employed, which is fifty short
of the number needed. Anyone who
cares to usher or direct traffic is
urged to sign up immediately with
Mr. Loder in the Board of Athletic
Control Office.

for the Board of Athletic Control, who
is also a member of the committee

take charge of automobile parking.
So far approximately 550 men have

cares to usher or direct traffic is
urged to sign up immediately with
Mr. Loder in the Board of Athletic
