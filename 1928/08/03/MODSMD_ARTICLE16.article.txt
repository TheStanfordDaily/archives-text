# Bigger Than a Big Game

### 
The Stanford Stadium will be the setting of an event that no Big
Game ever equalled on August 11, the day of Hoover's official notifica
tion of his nomination for the presidency and of his official acceptance
and setting forth of the principles on which his campaign will be made.
The annual battle between Stanford and California holds the tense inter
est of the throngs in the stadium and of the whole Pacific Coast; this
ceremony will grip the close attention of the whole nation as it listens
to Hoover's words as they come over the radio. But only those who are
in the stadium will get the full flavor of the momentous occasion; they
will be in the very center of it, participants, while the millions at radios
will be on the outside listening in, missing the movement and color and
incidents, which no radio announcer can portray as vividly as the emo
tions of actual eye witnesses.
And there will be life and color. The occasion is one of national
significance and of impressive dignity, but the very fact that never before
in the history of the nation was a candidate notified and responded in the
presence of all his fellow-citizens who cared to join the audience will
add to the impressiveness and dignity and inevitably to the color.
"The Stanford band is marching in, with red coats and a giant drum
major with a great white shake on his head. They are playing a swing
ing march and the crowds are 011 their feet cheering. Hoover is watch
ing them intently with a half-smile on his face," the radio announcer will
tell the millions, but only the thousands in the stadium will get the first
hand thrill of actually seeing it.
There will be bands. Bands are needed when a ceremony is carried
tint 011 such an unprecedented scale as this. The Republican committee
in charge has not completed its full plans, but it has announced that it
will have a big San Francisco band and will call up from Pasadena the
famous American Legion fife and drum corps which has won prizes in
all contests it has been entered in, and they are many.
There will be flags 011 all the flag poles and in all the people's hands,
cheers and life and movement for a full hour before the moment when
quiet falls upon the thronged bowl as Governor Young steps forward to
the speakers' stand under the microphones and loud speaker horns to
begin the wholly serious program.
Everyone will be able to hear what is said, for a special announcing
system has been installed to carry to every part of the stadium. Which
makes that old gag that you can see and hear everything from every seat
a reality.
Preparations have been made to take care of any number. Stanford
officials are making even more complete arrangements than at Big Game
time. People who know how efficiently things are planned 011 such
occasions will be somewhat surprised at this. lint everything that coukl
possibly be arranged to make il easier for people to get in and out of the
stadium has been done. In fact, the officials have gone further than that,
for they will plan ways for people to get back to the highway and start
home.
