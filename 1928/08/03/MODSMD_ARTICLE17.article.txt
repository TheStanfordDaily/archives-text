Beginning today, Stanford will be the scene of great activity. Today
and tomorrow psychologists from all over the country are holding a con
vention here. Tomorrow the Palo Alto Horse Show begins with hun
dreds of valuable thoroughbreds entered from various parts of the state.
Next Thursday night, Gordon Davis will present again "The Queen's
Husband" which scored such a success when given before. The annual
session of the Western School for Commercial Secretaries will be held
at Brainier Hall.
But climaxing all these events will be the official notification of
Herbert Hoover to be held in the stadium August 11. The eyes of the
nation will be centered on Stanford during this event.
The old-time university was a sequestered retreat, the present-day
university is a part of the world.
