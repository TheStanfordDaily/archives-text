# Let Courtesy Prevail
## 
### 
In today's Campus Opinion Column appears a complaint regarding
the use of the varsity tennis courts. According to Elwyn Bugge, tennis
coach, the only restrictions on the use of tennis courts during the summer
apply to the eleven courts fronting Encina Gymnasium. These are all
reserved for class use after 3 o'clock on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays, and the first three are to be used for the University tournament
matches now being run off.
"These varsity courts should be available to any first string varsity
players now in college as is the practice at any other time in the year,"
lÂ»ugge said, "but certainly courtesy should be observed under all cir
cumstances."
Bugge asks that all complaints regarding the use of the tennis courts
be directed to him as he and his associates are making every effort to
accommodate all Stanford people wishing to play tennis.
