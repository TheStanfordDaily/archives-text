"THE TORCHES FLARE." By Stark
Young. Charles Scribner's Sons,
$2.50.
Mr. Young's second novel confirms
the opinions of the critics who praised
his first, "Heaven Trees." This is a
dyspeptic statement to make about a
good book, but the "Torches Flare"
so nearly approaches our definition
of a good novel, that we find the
usual blurb inadequate to the situa
tion. It is almost a crime to bring out
the good old standardized adjectives
to review it.
This story of Lena Dandridge is by
no means a great "epic," but it does
create a tapestry of figures. Moreover
the world in which they live is more
passionate, more sincerely emotional,
and lias more mental genuineness
than in the anemic psycopathic books
that have been flooding our "litera
ture" this year. We would not call
this the effect of realism, nor would
we place "Torches Flare" in that par
ticular classification of fiction, but
rather place the responsibility for this
quality in Stark Young's visualization
of the story.

His technique is not obtrusive. It
is not in any way mannered. Happiest
of all, it is a vehicle for the story,
and NOT the story's vehicle. This
matter of style has really been done
to death lately, and for awhile it
looked as though all of our novelists
were going to be "artistes." "Torches
Flare" goes ahead smoothly and co
herently, the continuity is consistent,
and while it is well-enough written,
your interest in the book is not being
constantly diverted by these beauti
ful passages that demand admiration.
The theme is fair enough—being
concerned with Lena Dandridge, a
Southern girl of some extraordinary
characteristics. Her affairs of the
heart conflict with the ties of her en
vironment, and she is unable to bal
ance her intellectual and emotional
desires with her materialistic world.
The whole thing is told from the view
of a young professor, who is close
enough in kinship and sympathy to
understand Lena's weaknesses as
well as her strength.
Really a good book, is this "Torches
Flare." We recommend it to your at
tention. —Hallie Keating.
