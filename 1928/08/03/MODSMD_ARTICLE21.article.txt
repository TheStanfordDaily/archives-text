The Editor, Sir:
An article appeared in this column
not long ago in regard to the closing
of the men's tennis courts at noon on
Sundays. This is in the form of an
other complaint.
Last Saturday morning, accompa
nied by my father, who incidentally
is enrolled here as a special student,
and a brother-in-law, who is an alum
nus of Stanford and an ex-varsity
football man, we played one set of
tennis in the first court. Before we
had finished the set. a student stopped
us and asked the score. We told him
we had almost finished our first set.
Then we continued to play, and when
we had finished it, this young fellow
came over to us and said, "These
courts are reserved for the varsity
players, would you mind taking an
other court?" In addition, the request
was not made in a very nice tone.
Mind you, there were four or five other
courts available, but this man and
his friend saw fit to disturb us and
our game so that they could play in
the first court.
Is it true that the first three courts
are reserved for varsity players the
whole year around, summer session
included? If they are, we are willing
to give them up providing we are
asked in the right manner. —G.B.
