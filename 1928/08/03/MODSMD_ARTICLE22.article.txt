The industrial section of San Fran
cisco smells. There is no doubt about
this. The air reeks with every known
aroma, and a few others. Canneries,
tanneries, and factories all fill the air
with their by-product, odor. Vet this
nauseating barrier is worth fighting
in order to see South San Francisco.
There are, in this district, some gi
gantic factories in which things are
done on a large scale. Here the re
sults of diminishing cost can be
plainly seen, and industry grows and
grows. Anyone who is the least curi
ous about, our economic life should
visit this district.
Yacht Harbor, on the Marina, is a
little cove in which a fleet of small
pleasure yachts are anchored. R-boats,
yawls, sloops, and star boats fill this
minute harbor on a foggy unpleasant
day, while on a clear day there are
only a few boats in the place, the
others being out on tours or* San
Francisco Bay. The writer of this
column has heard vague rumors that
some choice parties are given on
board ship in this port, but as these
are merely rumors he would rather
the reader did not hold this fact
against the reputation of the harbor.
