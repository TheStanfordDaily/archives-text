# STONE GIVES LECTURE AT TUESDAY MEETING OF PHI DELTA KAPPA
## Adult Education Advocated As Means to Increase Labor Efficiency 
### 
i Dr. Calvin P. Stone, of the Psych
i ology department, spoke on "Adult
Learning" at the Phi Delta Kappa
'meeting Tuesday. He presented the
| results of the study made by Dr. Ed
ward L. Thorndike of Columbia Uni
' versity and discussed their signifi
| cance to workers in education, espe
cially those engaged in night school
work.
Adults Should Study
No one under 45 years of age should
ibe afraid to try to learn anything
which he ought to learn; if he cannot
learn at 45, then he could not have
| age. In general, teachers of adults of
; ages 25 to 45 should expect them to
: learn at nearly the same rate and by
the same means as they would have
; learned the same thing at from 15 to
â€¢20 years of age, according to Dr.
| Stone.
I "Granting that adult learning is
I feasible and properly organized, dis
| locations in industry which may come
'about through changing techniques
and inventions can be minimized," he
i said. "The workers affected can read
ily be taught the altered methods or
j master new ones.
Advocates Adult Schools
"With proper adult schools it is
thought that many younger students
' now carried without profit through
| the public day schools could well be
! allowed to go to work and become
| producers. Later on, after their voca
! tional interests were more definitely
j developed, they could be given the
I opportunity to attend adult school."
Dr. Stone will leave Stanford on
j his sabbatical year of absence in Sep
; tember. He will go to the Institute of
Juvenile Research at Chicago, where
j he will work under Dr. Karl S. Lash
; ley, one of the foremost comparative
psychologists of America.

A newspaper, the "Exposition
1 Daily," will be published on the
| grounds at the Pacific Southwest Ex-
I position which will be held at Long
Beach, California, from July 27 until
September 3. This is believed to be
the first time that an international
fair has ever maintained its own
daily newspaper for the sole benefit
of visitors.
