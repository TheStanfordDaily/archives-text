# Film Depicting Finnish Life To Be Shown Here
## Ice-Breaking Steamers and Methods of Lumbering To Be Featured 
### 
A moving picture featuring Fin
land, and the country around Helsing
fors, the capitol, will be presented
Monday night in the Little Theatre
at 8 o'clock, under the auspices of the
Director of Summer Quarter. The
program consists of four parts, and
will not last more than one hour.
The film was loaned by the Lega
tion of Finland, in Washington, and
it is shown for the first time here.
Subsequently it will be used at other
schools and universities.
The picture depicts views of prin
cipal monuments, public buildings of
Helsingfors, and the life of the city.
One of the most interesting features
is the ice-breaking steamers, which
are shown plowing the channels in
the ice fields in order that harbor
and commercial shipping may con
tinue during the winter. A second
reel concerns the Finnish method of
lumbering, one of the principal in
dustries.
Views will also be shown of Finnish
universities and student life. The last
reel closes with the pictures of the
return of the prize-winning Olympic
team in 1924, and the ceremonies
given to them on their return.
