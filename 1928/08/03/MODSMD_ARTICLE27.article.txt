"Had Sir Philip Sidney not met
such an untimely death at the early
age of 32 years, he undoubtedly would
have rivalled the great Shakespeare,"
said Professor Feuillerat in his con
cluding lecture at the Little Theatre,
Wednesday afternoon.
"Possibly Sir Philip would not have
been as great as Shakespeare in draw
ing colorful characters, but certainly
his work shows a greater variety aud
depth of knowledge of the human soul
than that of the recognized master of
English literature. Shakespeare, him
self, was a docile pupil of the author
of the 'Arcadia' for in the portrayal
of his most subtle characters he has
drawn material from Sir Sidney's
work."
Professor Feuillerat has made a
transcription from a copy of the old
original revised edition which had
been lost to the world for many years.
The revision was not completed by
Sir Philip, but was published in 1590.
This "Arcadia" evidently was pub
lished against his sister's, the Count
ess of Pembroke's, wishes and in 1593
she brought out another publication
which she had augmented and tam
pered with. The alteration resulted in
a change of two episodes upon which
the conclusions rested. This form was
circulated freely and is the more gen
erally known of the revised forms.
