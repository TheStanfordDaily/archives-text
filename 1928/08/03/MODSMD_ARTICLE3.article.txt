# GABRILOWITSCH AGAIN CONDUCTS WOODLAND THEATER'S SYMPHONY
## Director, World-Famous As Concert Pianist, Offers Popular Program 
### 
Ossip Gabrilowitsch of the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra will conduct his
second symphony concert at the
Woodland Theater Sunday afternoon
at 3 o'clock. He is one of the most
popular conductors, besides being a
concert pianist of international fame.
As he is giving a program that offers
a good deal of interest in a popular
way as well as from a technical stand
point, a capacity crowd is again ex
pected.
Selections Are Varied
His first selection will be "Prelude
to Orestie," by Taneiev. This will be
followed by "Symphony No. 7 in A
Major, Opus 92." Beethoven; "Tone
Poem, 'Don Juan,' Opus 20," Strauss;
"Suite, 'Pictures from an Exhibition',"
Moussorgsky; and "Scherzo, 'The
Sorcerer's Apprentice'," Ducas.
Beethoven Interesting
Although the selections on the pro
gram are not primarily of the familiar
type, both the Strauss number and
that by Moussorgsky are always
greeted with pleasure by an audience.
The Beethoven number also promises
to be particularly interesting. Molnari,
guest conductor at the first of the
summer concerts at Hillsborough, re
cently conducted a Beethoven number
in the Hollywood Bowl, and music
lovers who had the privilege of hear
ing it will be eager to contrast the
interpretation of Beethoven by the
two conductors.
This concert is the next to the last
j of the series in the Woodland Thea
i ter. Special tickets may be secured
at Room 173, Administration build
ing.
