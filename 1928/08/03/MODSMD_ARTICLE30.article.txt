# MEMORIAL CHURCH IS ONE OF WELL-KNOWN POINTS OF INTEREST
## Facts Concerning Structure Are Not Known to Many Who Visit Campus 
### 
Stanford's Memorial Church is one
of the best-known points of interest
in California. It is indeed fortunate
that this beautiful piece of architec
ture is available to the students, but
there are many things about it that
the layman does not know.
The church is cruciform in plan
with a seating capacity of about 2000.
The exterior length of the church is
250 feet. The present cross on the
front is some 90 feet high. The
steeple, which was on the church be
fore the earthquake in 1906, was 186
feet high. In this steeple was housed
a clock, which could be seen from
almost any place on the campus, and
chimes similar to the chimes in the
Parliament House on the Thames in
England.
Has Good Acoustics
The bronze doors, at the entrance
to the church, cost $10,000. Perfect
acoustics are to be found in the church
and the organ is one of the finest in
the country, the recent improvements
placing it on a par with the famous
organ in the Mormon tabernacle in
Salt Lake City.
The stained glass windows, done by
J. and R. Lamb of New York, are
some of the most perfect in the
world. The windows are copies of
famous paintings which Mrs. Stanford
chose during her travels in Europe.
Some difficulty was experienced here
by the makers as most of the original
paintings were of greater length than
height, thus causing trouble when at
tempts were made to reproduce them
in the right proportions in glass.
Portray Life of Christ
The lower windows of the church
portray the life of Christ. Interesting,
too, is the fact that a woman's figure
is in almost every group of the lower
series, and in half of the cerestory
windows. By this it was Mrs. Stan
ford's wish to commemorate the up
lift which religion has given to wo
mankind.
The church is undenominational,
and compulsory chapel is not required
of the students. However, the certain
ty that an interesting sermon will be
heard each Sunday, coupled with the
beauty of the interior and the lure of
the organ music, has assured a good
attendance to its services.
