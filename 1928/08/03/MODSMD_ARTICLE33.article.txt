# WORK OF CLEMENCEAU IN U.S. IS SUBJECT OF TUESDAY LECTURE
## 
### 
"Clemenceau and his activities in
America during the days of the Re
construction period after the close of
the Civil War in America," was the
theme of a lecture by Baldensperger,
visiting Professor of French from the
University of Paris, on Tuesday eve
ning at the Little Theatre.
According to Dr. Baldensperger,
Clemenceau came to America when a
young man and began a series of let
ters to the Paris papers dealing with
the political situation as he found it
in America at the time. The letters
cover the period from 1865 to 1869,
and make a valuable contribution to
United States history. The Civil War
had just closed and the country was
torn with the assassination of Lin
coln and the impeachment of Johnson.
Young Clemenceau lived a Bohe
mian life in New York; frequenting
crowded restaurants, mingling in the
night life, and discussing with stu
dents, actors, and writers, political
questions, elections, and the rising
power of the masses.
After six years in America he re
turned to his native Paris, taking
with him his American bride, Mary
Plummer, whom he met while teach
ing French in a young ladies' academy
in Connecticut.
In speaking of the material of the
lecture Doctor Baldensperger said
that he had himself personally talked
with Clemenceau about the matter,
and having been told of these letters,
he had proposed to look them up. "It
was with some difficulty," he said,
"that we exhumed them from the old
files of the 'Temps' of Paris. They
were hard to recognize because they
were unsigned, but with the help of
the editors and Clemenceau himself
they were rescued from oblivion."

Portrait painters are out of patience
with short skirts because they are
putting full-length pictures in the dis
card.
