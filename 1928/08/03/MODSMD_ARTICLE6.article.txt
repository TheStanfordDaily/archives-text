# AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF STANFORD TAKEN
## 
### 
An aerial survey of Stanford Uni
versity and surrounding territory,
sponsored by the Board of Trustees,
was taken last Wednesday by H. A.
Erickson in a plane piloted by Lieu
tenant Norman A. Goddard, instructor
of the Palo Alto School of Aviation.
When completed, the aerial survey
of Stanford, taken at a height of
7200 feet, will be put in stereoscopic
form. Because permission was not
granted to fly low, Erickson was un
able to take close-ups of the Univer
sity.
It will be at least six weeks before
the pictures are finished, because of
the great amount of work required in
developing them.
