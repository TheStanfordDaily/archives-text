# Pirandello's "Right You Are" Will Be Presented August 17 By Davis
## 
### 
Gordon Davis' next presentation
will be Pirandello's parable play,
"Right You Are If You Think You
Are." It is a delightful, metaphysical
drama framed in a provincial Italian
setting. It is a thing of illusions and
truths, a slyly sadnoic play, an intel
truths, a slyly sardonic play, an intel
times.
"Right You Are If You Think You
Are" is an esoteric play expressed
through a provincial and local me
dium. It contains a profound theme,
yet it can not be called a truly philo
sophical play. However, there is an
odd and interesting philosophy ex
pressed. The most charming feature
of the play is the manner in which
this expression is made obvious to the
audience without a seemingly con
scious effort.
Play Is Unorthodox
Like "The Chief Thing" the play is
unorthodox, but in an entirely differ
ent. manner. It has a foreign setting
and a startling conclusion, yet unlike
"The Chief Thing" it does not ven
j ture so far into the realm of fantasy.
"Right You Are If You Think You
Are" demands a set of positive char

acterizations and actors who are capa
ble of formulating a convincing transi
tion. It is believed that Davis has se
lected such a cast. At any rate it is
certain that he has a talented group
which his direction can undoubtedly
mould into a suitable ensemble of
players capable of holding such a pro
duction.
Price Will Play
Davis has refused to give the list of
the final casting, but he did say that
it was to include two leads which are
to be played by Anna May Price and
Irving Rosenblatt. Miss Price is per
haps one of the most accomplished
actresses that has ever worked under
Gordon Davis. It is remembered that
she carried on Mr. Davis' work while
he was in Europe.
Irving Rosenblatt played the amus
ing part of the dissolute prince in
"The Queen's Husband" and is con
sidered to be a talented actor.
The rest of the cast, despite the
j fact that no definite announcements
lean be made, will be composed of peo
ple who should be able to carry t lie
production iu a manner to reflect the
! true spirit of the drama.

and a startling conclusion, yet unlike
"The Chief Thing" it does not ven
j ture so far into the realm of fantasy.
"Right You Are If You Think You
Are" demands a set of positive char

acterizations and actors who are capa
ble of formulating a convincing transi
tion. It is believed that Davis has se
lected such a cast. At any rate it is
certain that he has a talented group
which his direction can undoubtedly
mould into a suitable ensemble of
players capable of holding such a pro
duction.
Price Will Play
Davis has refused to give the list of
the final casting, but he did say that
it was to include two leads which are
to be played by Anna May Price and
Irving Rosenblatt. Miss Price is per
haps one of the most accomplished
actresses that has ever worked under
Gordon Davis. It is remembered that
she carried on Mr. Davis' work while
he was in Europe.
Irving Rosenblatt played the amus
ing part of the dissolute prince in
"The Queen's Husband" and is con
sidered to be a talented actor.
The rest of the cast, despite the
j fact that no definite announcements
lean be made, will be composed of peo
ple who should be able to carry t lie
production iu a manner to reflect the
! true spirit of the drama.
Gordon Davis' next presentation
will be Pirandello's parable play,
"Right You Are If You Think You
Are." It is a delightful, metaphysical
drama framed in a provincial Italian
setting. It is a thing of illusions and
truths, a slyly sadnoic play, an intel
truths, a slyly sardonic play, an intel
times.
"Right You Are If You Think You
Are" is an esoteric play expressed
through a provincial and local me
dium. It contains a profound theme,
yet it can not be called a truly philo
sophical play. However, there is an
odd and interesting philosophy ex
pressed. The most charming feature
of the play is the manner in which
this expression is made obvious to the
audience without a seemingly con
scious effort.
Play Is Unorthodox
Like "The Chief Thing" the play is
unorthodox, but in an entirely differ
ent. manner. It has a foreign setting
and a startling conclusion, yet unlike
"The Chief Thing" it does not ven
j ture so far into the realm of fantasy.
