# RECITAL BY ORGANIST BIDWELL TO FEATURE RUSSIAN COMPOSITIONS
## 
### 
IV\Jjjinii V/Uim vuiiivMw
Compositions of Russian Composers
will be played by Marshall Bidwell,
acting University organist, at his re
cital at 4:15 o'clock Thursday after
noon in the Memorial Church.

The program will open with Tschai
kowsky's "Marche Slave." It was writ
ten in 1876 for a benefit concert for
Serbian soldiers wounded in the war
between their country and Turkey. It
starts with the folk-song, "Come My
Dearest," which soon gives way to
brighter tunes, until finally as a
climax the former Russian Hymn is
thundered forth against a remarkable
harmonic background.
Three other Tschaikowsky numbers
will be played. They are "Dance of
the Mirlitons from 'Nutcracker
Suite'; "The Lark," and "Andante
Andante Contabile con alecuna licenza
Cantabile from Symphony V." This
is the second movement of the sym
phony and seems to foreshadow the
atmosphere of the Pathetique (Sym
phony VI).
Rachmaninoff's "Prelude in G
Minor," and "At the Convent," by
Borodin, are also included on this
recital program. Borodin was one of
the most naturalistic composers of
the Russian modern school. However,
he became famous not only as a musi
cian, but also as a scientist.
Mr. Bidwell will give a program of
compositions by Wagner next Sunday
evening.
