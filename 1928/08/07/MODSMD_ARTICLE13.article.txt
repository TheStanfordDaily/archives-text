# HOOVER DEFERS TRIP TO GREET VISITING AIDES
## PLANS FOR CAMPAIGN Davis, Crocker Confer With Presidential Candidate On National Issues 
### 
! Herbert Hoover, Republican nomi
-1 nee for President, has abandoned his
plan of a short pleasure trip to Yo
semite, and will remain here till after
I his notification which takes place in
the Stadium next Saturday afternoon.
The candidate's plans were halted on
iaccount of the number of prominent
friends and political associates who
I are scheduled to visit him before the
! official ceremonies begin.
Among the notables who visited
| Hoover were Secretary of War Dwight
j F. Davis, and William F. Crocker, Re
publican National Committeeman.
I .Davis, who is on his way to Hawaii
|to take part in the hundred and flf
j tieth anniversary of the discovery of
the Hawaiian islands, stopped to pay
| his regards to the presidential nomi
nee and report on the progress of the
Mississippi flood control committee,
which is in charge of the construction
of levees and dikes for the prevention
of future disasters along that river.
, Over $25,000,000 will be spent this
! summer on the project, with a total
i authorization of $325,000,000 to cover
; over a period of ten years.
In speaking of the political situa
tion, Davis declared, "The coming
election will be a battle between two
I strongly organized forces, but it looks
i like a victory for Hoover." He empha
' sized the fact that the good crops
which are prevalent throughout the
| Middlewest this year would be an aid
!to his party in the fall elections, as
! would the waterways being construct
|ed by the present administration for
| the transportation of these agricul
! tural products. Farm relief measures
' such as the waterways, he believes,
i will be of immeasurable value to the
| Republican party in carrying the
j states known as the farm belt area.
