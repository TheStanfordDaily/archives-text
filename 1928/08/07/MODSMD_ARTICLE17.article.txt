### 
For at least a decade the creative arts have been undergoing obvious
changes in manner of expression. Music, painting, sculpture, litera
ture, the drama, all have been breaking away from the obvious, seeking
new modes. Expressionism, futurism, symbolism—these are ways in
which the break with old traditions, the effort for liberality of treatment
have expressed themselves.
The stage has been late in yielding to this new order; the old tra
ditions die hard there, for behind the drama lie the strictest rules of
creation and form found in any class of developmental art. Yet the
change was inevitable there, too; the little theater movement and the
college productions are indications of the predestined event.
"The Chief Thing" and "Right You Are If You Think You Are"
are two plays that illustrate the new dramatic trend. Both plays discard
conventionality; they do not even conform to the standardized concep
tion of a play. The fact that such dramas are played to a cultured audi
ence demonstrates that they are not merely interesting because of their
oddity, but that they contain something deeper.
It is a cause for pride that Stanford can produce these plays and
rely on audiences that will appreciate them, regarding the new drama
not as a fad, but as a progressive transition.
