FOLLOWING THE CARDS
The Olympic Games track and field
events are over, which, all in all, is
a great relief. We won, but our men
did not do as well as they were ex
pected to do. This is certainly no
cause for pessimism, but the things
that have arisen out of our many de
feats is certainly cause for gloom.
Everyone seems to be accusing some
one else with having been in some
way responsible for what they think
was a poor showing on the part of
the United States.
It is entirely possible that many
of these charges are true, but this
is a poor time to hurl invectives.
Why not accept defeat in a gen
tlemanly manner? It was certain
ly no disgrace for American ath
letes to be forced to take seconds
and thirds in some events in
which they thought they should
have had firsts, for they « were
meeting the best in the world.
America should not feel that she
is entitled to all the honors, for
it must beremembered that we
have been victorious so long in
the Olympic Games that other
countries have had to gain what
satisfaction they can from these
Games by taking individual first
places.
Bud Spencer is certainly to be con
gratulated on his wonderful showing
in the 1600-meter relay. The Stanford
quarter-mile ace paced the 400 meters
in 47.7 to turn in the fastest time of
any member on the American team.
Barbuti, who conquered Spencer each
time he has run against him, again
showed himself a dependable runner,
by winning the United States' only
track victory. We would like to see
Barbuti and the Cardinal skipper bat
tle things out on the Stanford oval,
for Barbuti has been running in con
ditions which have been more favor
able to him than they have to Spen
cer. What a thrilling race this would
be.
Enough for track, for the Daily
has received news of the base
ball team in a letter from Frank
Wilton, captain-elect. The letter
was mailed at Pago-Pago and
gives a few incidents of the trip.
It seems that some of the men
were very poor sailors. Spud Har
der has vowed that hereafter he
will ride around the bay rather
than cross it by ferry.
t
It also seems that one member of
the team (name withheld) had nine
teen letters in his suitcase, one to be
read each day. No, the letters weren't
from his mother. Wilton closed by
saying that most of the men would
certainly like to have a glimpse of
the dear old U.S.A. —Jack Hodges.
