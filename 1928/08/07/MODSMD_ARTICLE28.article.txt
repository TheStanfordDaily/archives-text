### 
Genevieve Downs, who is playing
the lead in "Romeo and Juliet," is at
present working with the state psych
ology department where she is doing
interesting work in both playwriting
and psychology. The object of her
activity is to substitute dramatic in
terest for criminal activity. While in
southern California Miss Downs wrote
and directed a pJay, "His Birthday,"
which was presented under her direc
tion at the Whittier Reform School.
She has done the same work in sev
eral prisons and it has been met with
praise by students of criminology.
Miss Downs is not only a profes
sional actress but a playwright. She
did her first work in drama writing
with Mrs. Elizabeth Lanz, wife of
Professor Lanz of the Slavic depart
ment. She was also active in the or
ganization of the Pendragon Players
and it was with them that she did her
first acting.
Miss Downs has played with the
Indianapolis Players, the Carmel
Players, as well as on the profession
al stage. She played an important
role in Eric Von Stroheim's famous
presentation, "Greed."
Miss Downs said, in speaking of
the forthcoming production, "It has
been a long time since Mrs. Kisich and
I have worked together, and I am
sure that I will enjoy it. I am charmed
by Stanford."
In speaking of her present work,
she said, "I am convinced that chil
dren who have had their dramatic
tendencies stimulated and who have
been given an outlet for their emo
tions will not be criminals. Even the
convicted criminal is affected by this
treatment."
