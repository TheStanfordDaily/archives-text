# GABRILOWITSCH LEADS SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN COLORFUL CONCERT
## Brilliant Program Furnishes Entertainment to Large Audience Sunday 
### 
Ossip Gabrilowitsch, guest conduc
tor of the San Mateo County Philhar
monic Society, gave one of the most
colorful concerts of the season when
he appeared for the second time with
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra in the Woodland Theater at Hills
borough. One of the largest audiences
of the summer season attended the
unusually brilliant program of the
master.
Beethoven's "Symphony No. 7 in
A Major, Opus 92," depicted with pro
found sympathy, was the favorite of
the program, while the interpretation
of Strauss' "Don Juan" was the most
colorful, both in tone variation and
rendition, of the program.
"Scherzo, The Sorcerer's Appren
tice," by Ducas, the French composer,
was brilliantly interpreted, carrying
to the audience the spirit of the mas
ter. The realistic yet pictoral effect
of Moussorgsky's "Picture from an
Exhibition" was considered by some
to be the most striking number on
the program. "The Prelude to Orestie,"

by Taneiev, was presented in a novel j
and entertaining manner, full of I
vitality and beauty.
The concert will be repeated this
evening in the Dreamland Auditorium
in San Francisco.
