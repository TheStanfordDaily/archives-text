# UNIVERSITY LIBRARIAN COMMENTS ON TOUT'S THURSDAY LECTURE
## 
### 
When Professor Tout said that
American students waste time by
going to Europe for research work,
he was right in general, but possibly
exaggerated a little in his wish to
compliment our American universi
ties. This is the comment of Nathan
Van Patton, University librarian, in
discussing last Thursday's lecture by
Dr. T. P. Tout, distinguished historian
from Manchester College, England.
Dr. Tout said that a large part of
the work which the American student
does in Europe could be accomplished
in his home university with a saving
of time and expense. He considers sli
braries of American universities
superior to those of Europe for re
search purposes.
Mr. Van Patton says, "The Ameri
can library excels in physical equip
ment and the technical skill of its
staff, while the European library ex
cels (and it is largely the result of
their age) in manuscript and printed
sources for research in history, art,
literature, religion, and music."
He comments that it is true if one's
problem deals with material of the
eighteenth or nineteenth century, it
may be better solved at home. But
for work upon ancient times, old
manuscripts are necessary. While
some of the best known have been
reproduced, those cases are the ex
ceptions. The student's problem is
being met partly by the Library of
Congress which is now compiling a
guide to all the research material
available in this country.
The objective at the Stanford li
brary, according to Mr. Van Patton,
is dual: "Firsts to select and preserve
the best of current books and jour
nals necessary to the work of the
University, and second to acquire
such older standard works as our ex
perience indicates are needed to sup
plement our present resources."
