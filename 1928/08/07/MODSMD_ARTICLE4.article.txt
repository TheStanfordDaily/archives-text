# SATURDAY EXCURSION TO MOUNT HAMILTON DRAWS LARGE GROUP
## 
### 
The trip to Carmel, under the j
auspices of the Summer Quarter
Director, originally scheduled for
August 11, has been postponed to
August 25. The change was made
because of the conflict with the
Hoover notification speech this
Saturday.
Plans for the trip itself will re
main the same. The day will be
spent in Carmel, Monterey, and
the Monterey Presidio, returning
at night to Stanford.
The very large crowd which made
the trip to Mount Hamilton last Satur
day evening was duly rewarded by a
glowing sunset, starry heavens, and
the twinkling lights of the valley be
low.
The entertainment at the observa
tory centered about a two-ring circus
—the twelve- and thirty-six-inch tele
scopes; the performers being Alpha
Hercules and Saturn. Alpha Hercules
was best seen when magnified 140
times, showing it to be a double star
—a large red orb and a smaller
orange one. The colors of stars indi
as their present temperature. The
as their presen temperature. The
smaller yellow one is much younger
than its ruby companion, and as for
temperature it registers 4000 while
the larger one has cooled down to
2000 degrees.

Dr. I. C. Aikin, who has spent thirty
years studying binary stars, told how
the two stars composing Alpha Her
cules act as though joined by an
imaginary line, and are therefore con
sidered to be in a physical union as
the distance between them has not
appreciably changed since they were
first observed in 1729. As the parallax
between them is negative it may safe
ly be said that the distance between
them is 000 times the distance from
the earth and the sun, and that they
are 600 light years "away from us.
Dr. Joseph H. Moore was in charge
of the large telescope which he had
focused on the ever-popular Saturn
with its spinning rings and satellites.
A curious effect was the various ex
periences of the observers in viewing
| the brilliant planet, as some saw it
| clearly outlined in the sky, while the
vision of others was somewhat ob
! scured by a hypersensitivity to blue
' light.
A thirty-mile-an hour breeze caused
sufficient atmospheric disturbance to
make the 3000 magnification imprac
ticable, so that a magnifying power
of 270 was used.

smaller yellow one is much younger
than its ruby companion, and as for
temperature it registers 4000 while
the larger one has cooled down to
2000 degrees.
Aiken Explains Stars
Dr. I. C. Aikin, who has spent thirty
years studying binary stars, told how
the two stars composing Alpha Her
cules act as though joined by an
imaginary line, and are therefore con
sidered to be in a physical union as
the distance between them has not
appreciably changed since they were
first observed in 1729. As the parallax
between them is negative it may safe
ly be said that the distance between
them is 000 times the distance from
the earth and the sun, and that they
are 600 light years "away from us.
Dr. Joseph H. Moore was in charge
of the large telescope which he had
focused on the ever-popular Saturn
with its spinning rings and satellites.
A curious effect was the various ex
periences of the observers in viewing
| the brilliant planet, as some saw it
| clearly outlined in the sky, while the
vision of others was somewhat ob
! scured by a hypersensitivity to blue
' light.
A thirty-mile-an hour breeze caused
sufficient atmospheric disturbance to
make the 3000 magnification imprac
ticable, so that a magnifying power
of 270 was used.
The trip to Carmel, under the j
auspices of the Summer Quarter
Director, originally scheduled for
August 11, has been postponed to
August 25. The change was made
because of the conflict with the
Hoover notification speech this
Saturday.
Plans for the trip itself will re
main the same. The day will be
spent in Carmel, Monterey, and
the Monterey Presidio, returning
at night to Stanford.
The very large crowd which made
the trip to Mount Hamilton last Satur
day evening was duly rewarded by a
glowing sunset, starry heavens, and
the twinkling lights of the valley be
low.
The entertainment at the observa
tory centered about a two-ring circus
—the twelve- and thirty-six-inch tele
scopes; the performers being Alpha
Hercules and Saturn. Alpha Hercules
was best seen when magnified 140
times, showing it to be a double star
—a large red orb and a smaller
orange one. The colors of stars indi
