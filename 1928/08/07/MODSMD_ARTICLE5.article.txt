# WILBUR TO PLAY LEAD AGAIN IN "THE QUEEN'S HUSAAND"
## Splendid Characterization of King To Be Recreated By Gordon Davis Cast Is Being Put Through Strenuous Rehearsals For Presentation 
### Laird Doyle 
Elizabeth Wilbur, who Is playing
the Queen in the second presentation
of "The Queen's Husband," has re
fused for the second time a profes
sional engagement rather than weak
en Davis' production of Robert Sher
wood's satirical comedy.
Miss Wilbur was called to play with
Robert Warwick in "The Admirable
Cricliton" in Oakland. Her refusal to
leave an amateur play in order to
work on a professional stage came as
a surprise to those interested In dra
matics. It had been rumored that she
was to desert "The Queen's Husband"
for a more remunerative field, but
Miss Wilbur declared today that
"after accepting a part in 'The
Queen's Husband' I feel that it is my
duty to stay with the show until it
has completed its showing."
Cast Is Rehearsing
The cast for "The Queen's Hus
band," which is to be presented for
the second time on August 10, is at
present being put through strenuous
rehearsals. Gordon Davis is guarding
any laxity which might be caused by
over-confidence on the part of the cast
as a result of their first success.
Dick Fisher, who will also play in
"Right You Are If You Think You
Ai'e," is expected to again add force
to "The Queen's Husband" hy creat
ing the positive character of General
Nortlirup. Fisher's work is of a clear
cut nature and his performance will
strengthen both plays.
Davis Recreates King
Gordon Davis will undoubtedly re
create the splendid characterization
of the King done in the first presenta-
tion. It is the current concensus of
those who have witnessed Davis' play
ing for a number of years that his
interpretation of this part is the most
interesting work he has eve* done
behind the footlights.
Jack Wiggin is expected to add to
Bronson's interpretation of the part
of Lord Burton. In both acting ex
perience and ability Wiggin is super

ior to Bronson. and it is fortunate that
he is to play the part.
As Gordon Davis will correct the
errors made in the first production of
"The Queen's Husband," this play l
should be the most finished and pol-!
islied one seen on the campus for j
some time.

for a more remunerative field, but
Miss Wilbur declared today that
"after accepting a part in 'The
Queen's Husband' I feel that it is my
duty to stay with the show until it
has completed its showing."
Cast Is Rehearsing
The cast for "The Queen's Hus
band," which is to be presented for
the second time on August 10, is at
present being put through strenuous
rehearsals. Gordon Davis is guarding
any laxity which might be caused by
over-confidence on the part of the cast
as a result of their first success.
Dick Fisher, who will also play in
"Right You Are If You Think You
Ai'e," is expected to again add force
to "The Queen's Husband" hy creat
ing the positive character of General
Nortlirup. Fisher's work is of a clear
cut nature and his performance will
strengthen both plays.
Davis Recreates King
Gordon Davis will undoubtedly re
create the splendid characterization
of the King done in the first presenta-
tion. It is the current concensus of
those who have witnessed Davis' play
ing for a number of years that his
interpretation of this part is the most
interesting work he has eve* done
behind the footlights.
Jack Wiggin is expected to add to
Bronson's interpretation of the part
of Lord Burton. In both acting ex
perience and ability Wiggin is super

ior to Bronson. and it is fortunate that
he is to play the part.
As Gordon Davis will correct the
errors made in the first production of
"The Queen's Husband," this play l
should be the most finished and pol-!
islied one seen on the campus for j
some time.
Elizabeth Wilbur, who Is playing
the Queen in the second presentation
of "The Queen's Husband," has re
fused for the second time a profes
sional engagement rather than weak
en Davis' production of Robert Sher
wood's satirical comedy.
Miss Wilbur was called to play with
Robert Warwick in "The Admirable
Cricliton" in Oakland. Her refusal to
leave an amateur play in order to
work on a professional stage came as
a surprise to those interested In dra
matics. It had been rumored that she
was to desert "The Queen's Husband"
for a more remunerative field, but
Miss Wilbur declared today that
"after accepting a part in 'The
Queen's Husband' I feel that it is my
duty to stay with the show until it
has completed its showing."
