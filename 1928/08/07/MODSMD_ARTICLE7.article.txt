## 
### 
A crowd nuinhering about 800 at
tended the second evening perform
ance of the Palo Alto Horse Show
last night. The features of the show
were the $1000 stake for roadsters,
sponsored by the Palo Alto Chamber
of Commerce, and the $500 stake for
five-gaited stallions or geldings, spon
sored by Miss Cecilia Hoyt de Mi lie
of Hollywood. My Souvenir, owned by
Mrs. W. P. Roth of Woodside, won
the Chamber of Commerce stake, and
Carnation Chief, owned by the Carna
tion Farm Stables of Pomona, won
the de Mille stake. Miss Ruth Lans
burgh, *29, driving Merry Lou and
Honey Lou, owned by John Hubly,
placed second in the harness horses,
ladies' pairs, and also placed fourth
in the three-gaited saddle horses
event, riding Lady of Bronze, owned
by Mrs. G. Albert Lansburgh.
A large crowd marked the opening
of the second annual Palo Alto Horse
Show, Saturday afternoon, at the tan
bark on the Stanford campus. A spe
cially constructed ring furnished an
appropriate setting for the beautiful
thoroughbreds, many of which are in
ternationally famous.
The two features of the Saturday
program were both held in the eve
ning. They were the Miss Elinor Getz
$f>oo stake for fine harness horses, and
the Miss Josephine M. Thomas $500
stake for five-gaited mares.
The Why Worry Farm, Carnation
Farm, and other prominent stables
entered twelve horses in the harness
event. The winner was I. H. Hell
man with Ruth Lansburgli, a Stan
lord student, taking second and fifth
places in this event.
The five-gaited mare event also had
twelve entries, and will most likely
prove one of the best events of the
week. Carnation Farm Stable took
first, while two of Miss Lansburgh's
mounts gave her a second and third
place.
Western saddles, lariats, and
"chaps" added color to the'interesting
Heavyweight Stock Horses event.
One of the last events on Saturday's
list, the Five-Foot Jumping Perform
ance, proved exciting as the jumps
were so high that several of the
horses refused to take them. Luckily
no accidents occurred though one
horse and rider fell.
The show is to continue every night
of this week with a matinee Friday
afternoon. Tickets for these perfoi-m
-ances may be obtained at the gate.
General admission is $1. Boxes are
$2.50.
Jake Franklin announces that
all ushers and all who desire to
usher for Friday's production of
the "Queen's Husband," report at
the Assembly Hall that evening
at 7 o'clock.
