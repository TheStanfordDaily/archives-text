## 
### 
Flowers and colored lights turned
Toyon Hall into a romantic garden
for the second all-University Informal
Friday night. The success of the last
affair proved a drawing card for Fri
day's dance, and the Toyon floor was
well-filled with dancers.
The Informal capped the climax,
socially, for the six weeks' period of
the Summer Quarter, and to many
was in the nature of a farewell party.
The enthusiasm which greeted the af
fair augers well for the spirit of the
summer season.
The rythmic entertainment was the
contribution of George Tackahury and
his eight-piece orchestra with Neal
Spaulding at the piano. The orchestra
held forth in a corner on the main
floor and issued seductive strains of
jazz from behind a row of palms.
A novelty in the way of lighting ef
fects was furnished by Scott Quigley,
chief electrician, who mounted lights
on the balcony and flooded the
dancers with colors of variegated hue.
The host and hostesses were Mr.
and Mrs. Jacob Irwin. Mr. and Mrs.
Myron Sprague, and Clark Sypher and
Miss Mary Farrell.
