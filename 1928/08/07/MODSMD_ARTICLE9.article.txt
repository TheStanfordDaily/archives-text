# Davis Announces Cast For "Right You Are If You Think You Are"
## 
### 
The cast for "Right You Are If
You Think You Are" was announced
today. Gordon Davis stated that he
did not believe any further changes
will be made and that he had the best
available cast for the play. The pro
duction was a difficult one to cast,
for there are many character parts
and also several parts which call
for a definite characterization.
Volland Has Important Role
Virginia Volland has been given an
important role. Her work in "The
Chief Thing" was so satisfying that
it warranted her being placed in a
position where her ability could be
given a wider range. Miss Volland is
perhaps the best actress to be de
veloped this quarter and it is expected
that she will do an unusual piece of
work in "Right You Are If You Think
You Are."
Carol Wynn, who was also a mem
ber of the cast of "The Chief Thing"
and who is to play in the outdoor
production of "Romeo and Juliet," is
to portray a difficult role. Wynn—in
this part—should be able to .create a
polished impression. This is the big
gest part that he has ever had in
pure dramatic work, although he
played the lead in the last Junior
Opera.
Verna Hanra Has Talent
Verna Hanna, one of the Pacific
Players, is expected to handle her

part with ease. Miss Hanna is also a
member of Mrs. Kisich's cast of
"Romeo and Juliet." Her voice and
her appearance, as well as her talent,
point to her success in this presenta
tion.
Dick Fisher, who gained his popu
larity by his work in "The Queen's
Husband," has been given one of the
biggest parts. Fisher is another actor
who is taking his part with a great
deal of training behind him. Fisher
is one of the best character actors
that has been seen on the campus
stage this quarter.
Rosenblatt Given Lead
Irving Rosenblatt is cast in the
male lead. If he makes a success of
hiri role it will not only be to his
ability, but also due to Gordon Davis'
direction. This is the first time that
Rosenblatt has ever carried a part of
this nature. It is hoped that he will be
convincing, but it is difficult to judge,
for he has never done a characteriza
tion comparable to this.
Harold llelvenston has finished the
design of the set for "Right You Are
If You Think You Are." It will follow
a true Italian motif. It Is a realistic
set creating a contrast to his last
work for "The Chief Thing." Holven
ston's work is of such a nature that
to predict a success is to become
banal. The design indicates that the
set will be of an artistic nature.
