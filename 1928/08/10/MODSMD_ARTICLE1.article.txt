# HOOVER RETAINS FIRST INTEREST IN UNIVERSITY
## Became Member of Board of Trustees in 1912; Makes Home on Campus Entered With Pioneer Class; Activities in College Presaged Success 
### 
Herbert Hoover's association with
Stanford has dated from October 1,
1891, the first registration day of the
University. During his undergraduate
days he showed an enthusiastic inter
est in the conduct of student affairs.
Later, not only in his position as a
member of the Board of Trustees, but
in making his home upon the campus,
and in his activities as an alumnus,
lie has maintained a consistent inter
est in the affairs of the University.
For this reason his student days are
of significance since they illustrate
the same qualities of imagination,
executive ability, and interest in pub
lic affairs that have marked his
later career.
Hoover entered Stanford with the
Pioneer Class, attracted as much by
the picturesque romance surround
ing the new University, as by the
great reputation of Dr. Jolm Branner,
then head of the mining and geology
department. Tradition says that.
Hoover moved into Encina Hall a
fortnight before registration day, and
was the first student ever to sleep
there.
Secures Job
In spite of the chaos of the first
weeks. Hoover characteristically man
aged to secure the job of temporary
clerk to the registrar. This work
over, he looked around for other
means of adjusting the discrepancies
between a self-supporting boy's purse
and the new expenses of board and
fees. He secured the contract for San
Francisco newspapers on the campus,
and for a solid year kept daybreak
hours, and delivered papers before
breakfast. Hoover later incorporated
this route and sold it to make room
for his next enterprise, the laundry
agency, which was one of the most
successful of his business arrange
ments.
It is characteristic of Hoover that
his "business" projects as a student
were of an original type, demonstrat
ing the possession of business ima
gination as well as practical skill, en
hanced by his executive ability.
His freshman and sophomore years
were crowded ones for him, with the
triple struggle of his academic work,
his extra-curricular activities, and his
responsibilities of self-support.
Organizing Ability Shows
At the beginning of his junior year,
Hoover came back to college with his
first organization scheme. The early
student body was up to this time an
elastic body, nearly nebulous.
Hoover's new plan provided for an
executive organization, with all stu
dent activities under the control of
the body, and managed by a bonded
and double-audited treasurer. The
scheme had the essential characteris
tics of a "Hoover" organization, in
the "centralization of ideas, and de
centralization of execution."
The plan was adopted and went into
effect with Hoover as treasurer. Dur
ing his senior year he was absorbed
in three things: academic work, put
ting the final touches on this organiza
tion, and it was during this year that
he met Lou Henry, who later became
Mrs. Hoover.
In the years after his graduation, in
spite of work that took him to China,
Russia, and all parts of the world,
neither Hoover nor Mrs. Hoover let
their interest in Stanford lag, and in
1909 they established their permanent
home here.
Becomes Trustee
In 1912, Herbert Hoover became a
trustee of Stanford; the first alumnus
to be elected by the board to member
ship. He was elected not primarily as
an alumnus but because he had shown
exceptional executive ability and a
keen interest in the University. As a
trustee Hoover brought to the board
his own personal and active knowl
edge of Stanford. Shortly after his ap
pointment a formal statement was
made by the board as to the future
policy of the University. This policy,
followed closely ever since, empha
sized the principle tliat the Univer
sity would endeavor to raise the
standards and work of the existing
departments as high as possible with
the limits of the endowment, new
work, or establish new departments,
unless these were specifically en
dowed so as to insure a similar high
standard.
In recent years, although Hoover's
public duties have kept him largely
in the East, he has maintained a close

touch with the University, and con
sistently manifested the same eager
and active interest in its progress as
marked his undergraduate career
here.
Charles K. Field, '95, in the dedica
tion of the 1928 Stanford Quad, sums
up the attitude of Stanford Alumni
to Herbert Hoover: "We who were
with Hoover at Stanford saw him
sacrifice the accumulation of extra
marks that he might serve the or
ganization of student life. From Com
mencement, we watched him with
keen eyes of friendship, followed his
rapid rise and saw him forego extra
wealth that he might serve humanity.
Since then, we have looked on with
the rest of an appreciative world,
feeling that we of Stanford especially
can understand the spirit of Hoover."

an alumnus but because he had shown
exceptional executive ability and a
keen interest in the University. As a
trustee Hoover brought to the board
his own personal and active knowl
edge of Stanford. Shortly after his ap
pointment a formal statement was
made by the board as to the future
policy of the University. This policy,
followed closely ever since, empha
sized the principle tliat the Univer
sity would endeavor to raise the
standards and work of the existing
departments as high as possible with
the limits of the endowment, new
work, or establish new departments,
unless these were specifically en
dowed so as to insure a similar high
standard.
In recent years, although Hoover's
public duties have kept him largely
in the East, he has maintained a close

touch with the University, and con
sistently manifested the same eager
and active interest in its progress as
marked his undergraduate career
here.
Charles K. Field, '95, in the dedica
tion of the 1928 Stanford Quad, sums
up the attitude of Stanford Alumni
to Herbert Hoover: "We who were
with Hoover at Stanford saw him
sacrifice the accumulation of extra
marks that he might serve the or
ganization of student life. From Com
mencement, we watched him with
keen eyes of friendship, followed his
rapid rise and saw him forego extra
wealth that he might serve humanity.
Since then, we have looked on with
the rest of an appreciative world,
feeling that we of Stanford especially
can understand the spirit of Hoover."
Herbert Hoover's association with
Stanford has dated from October 1,
1891, the first registration day of the
University. During his undergraduate
days he showed an enthusiastic inter
est in the conduct of student affairs.
Later, not only in his position as a
member of the Board of Trustees, but
in making his home upon the campus,
and in his activities as an alumnus,
lie has maintained a consistent inter
est in the affairs of the University.
For this reason his student days are
of significance since they illustrate
the same qualities of imagination,
executive ability, and interest in pub
lic affairs that have marked his
later career.
Hoover entered Stanford with the
Pioneer Class, attracted as much by
the picturesque romance surround
ing the new University, as by the
great reputation of Dr. Jolm Branner,
then head of the mining and geology
department. Tradition says that.
Hoover moved into Encina Hall a
fortnight before registration day, and
was the first student ever to sleep
there.
Secures Job
In spite of the chaos of the first
weeks. Hoover characteristically man
aged to secure the job of temporary
clerk to the registrar. This work
over, he looked around for other
means of adjusting the discrepancies
between a self-supporting boy's purse
and the new expenses of board and
fees. He secured the contract for San
Francisco newspapers on the campus,
and for a solid year kept daybreak
hours, and delivered papers before
breakfast. Hoover later incorporated
this route and sold it to make room
for his next enterprise, the laundry
agency, which was one of the most
successful of his business arrange
ments.
It is characteristic of Hoover that
his "business" projects as a student
were of an original type, demonstrat
ing the possession of business ima
gination as well as practical skill, en
hanced by his executive ability.
His freshman and sophomore years
were crowded ones for him, with the
triple struggle of his academic work,
his extra-curricular activities, and his
responsibilities of self-support.
Organizing Ability Shows
At the beginning of his junior year,
Hoover came back to college with his
first organization scheme. The early
student body was up to this time an
elastic body, nearly nebulous.
Hoover's new plan provided for an
executive organization, with all stu
dent activities under the control of
the body, and managed by a bonded
and double-audited treasurer. The
scheme had the essential characteris
tics of a "Hoover" organization, in
the "centralization of ideas, and de
centralization of execution."
The plan was adopted and went into
effect with Hoover as treasurer. Dur
ing his senior year he was absorbed
in three things: academic work, put
ting the final touches on this organiza
tion, and it was during this year that
he met Lou Henry, who later became
Mrs. Hoover.
In the years after his graduation, in
spite of work that took him to China,
Russia, and all parts of the world,
neither Hoover nor Mrs. Hoover let
their interest in Stanford lag, and in
1909 they established their permanent
home here.

triple struggle of his academic work,
his extra-curricular activities, and his
responsibilities of self-support.
Organizing Ability Shows
At the beginning of his junior year,
Hoover came back to college with his
first organization scheme. The early
student body was up to this time an
elastic body, nearly nebulous.
Hoover's new plan provided for an
executive organization, with all stu
dent activities under the control of
the body, and managed by a bonded
and double-audited treasurer. The
scheme had the essential characteris
tics of a "Hoover" organization, in
the "centralization of ideas, and de
centralization of execution."
The plan was adopted and went into
effect with Hoover as treasurer. Dur
ing his senior year he was absorbed
in three things: academic work, put
ting the final touches on this organiza
tion, and it was during this year that
he met Lou Henry, who later became
Mrs. Hoover.
In the years after his graduation, in
spite of work that took him to China,
Russia, and all parts of the world,
neither Hoover nor Mrs. Hoover let
their interest in Stanford lag, and in
1909 they established their permanent
home here.
Becomes Trustee
In 1912, Herbert Hoover became a
trustee of Stanford; the first alumnus
to be elected by the board to member
ship. He was elected not primarily as
an alumnus but because he had shown
exceptional executive ability and a
keen interest in the University. As a
trustee Hoover brought to the board
his own personal and active knowl
edge of Stanford. Shortly after his ap
pointment a formal statement was
made by the board as to the future
policy of the University. This policy,
followed closely ever since, empha
sized the principle tliat the Univer
sity would endeavor to raise the
standards and work of the existing
departments as high as possible with
the limits of the endowment, new
work, or establish new departments,
unless these were specifically en
dowed so as to insure a similar high
standard.
In recent years, although Hoover's
public duties have kept him largely
in the East, he has maintained a close

touch with the University, and con
sistently manifested the same eager
and active interest in its progress as
marked his undergraduate career
here.
Charles K. Field, '95, in the dedica
tion of the 1928 Stanford Quad, sums
up the attitude of Stanford Alumni
to Herbert Hoover: "We who were
with Hoover at Stanford saw him
sacrifice the accumulation of extra
marks that he might serve the or
ganization of student life. From Com
mencement, we watched him with
keen eyes of friendship, followed his
rapid rise and saw him forego extra
wealth that he might serve humanity.
Since then, we have looked on with
the rest of an appreciative world,
feeling that we of Stanford especially
can understand the spirit of Hoover."
Herbert Hoover's association with
Stanford has dated from October 1,
1891, the first registration day of the
University. During his undergraduate
days he showed an enthusiastic inter
est in the conduct of student affairs.
Later, not only in his position as a
member of the Board of Trustees, but
in making his home upon the campus,
and in his activities as an alumnus,
lie has maintained a consistent inter
est in the affairs of the University.
For this reason his student days are
of significance since they illustrate
the same qualities of imagination,
executive ability, and interest in pub
lic affairs that have marked his
later career.
Hoover entered Stanford with the
Pioneer Class, attracted as much by
the picturesque romance surround
ing the new University, as by the
great reputation of Dr. Jolm Branner,
then head of the mining and geology
department. Tradition says that.
Hoover moved into Encina Hall a
fortnight before registration day, and
was the first student ever to sleep
there.
Secures Job
In spite of the chaos of the first
weeks. Hoover characteristically man
aged to secure the job of temporary
clerk to the registrar. This work
over, he looked around for other
means of adjusting the discrepancies
between a self-supporting boy's purse
and the new expenses of board and
fees. He secured the contract for San
Francisco newspapers on the campus,
and for a solid year kept daybreak
hours, and delivered papers before
breakfast. Hoover later incorporated
this route and sold it to make room
for his next enterprise, the laundry
agency, which was one of the most
successful of his business arrange
ments.
It is characteristic of Hoover that
his "business" projects as a student
were of an original type, demonstrat
ing the possession of business ima
gination as well as practical skill, en
hanced by his executive ability.
