# HOOVER RETAINS FIRST INTEREST IN UNIVERSITY
## Became Member of Board of Trustees in 1912; Makes Home on Campus Entered With Pioneer Class; Activities in College Presaged Success 
### 
Herbert Hoover's association with
Stanford has dated from October 1,
1891, the first registration day of the
University. During his undergraduate
days he showed an enthusiastic inter
est in the conduct of student affairs.
Later, not only in his position as a
member of the Board of Trustees, but
in making his home upon the campus,
and in his activities as an alumnus,
lie has maintained a consistent inter

For this reason his student days are
of significance since they illustrate
the same qualities of imagination,
executive ability, and interest in pub

Francisco newspapers on the campus,
and for a solid year kept daybreak
hours, and delivered papers before
breakfast. Hoover later incorporated
this route and sold it to make room
for his next enterprise, the laundry
agency, which was one of the most
successful of his business arrange
ments.
It is characteristic of Hoover that
his "business" projects as a student
were of an original type, demonstrat
ing the possession of business ima
gination as well as practical skill, en
hanced by his executive ability.
His freshman and sophomore years
were crowded ones for him, with the
triple struggle of his academic work,
his extra-curricular activities, and his
responsibilities of self-support.
Organizing Ability Shows
At the beginning of his junior year,
Hoover came back to college with his
first organization scheme. The early
student body was up to this time an
elastic body, nearly nebulous.
Hoover's new plan provided for an
