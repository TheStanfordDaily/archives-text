# TWO INSTITUTIONS OF UNIVERSAL VALUE FOUNDED BY HOOVER
## War Library, Food Institute Tribute to His Ability And Foresight 
### 
Through the efforts of Herbert
Hoover, '9.5, two institutions of na
tional and international value have
been established on the Stanford
campus. They are the Hoover War
Library, founded in 1919, and the
Food Research Institute, which began
its work in 1921.
Mr. Hoover provided the first funds
which made the War Library possi
ble, and four years ago gave the Li
brary a permanent endowment, which
is administered by a body of directors
under the chairmanship of Professor
E. D. Adams of the Stanford History
Department.
This Library is a part of there
search equipment of Stanford Univer
sity and the facilities it offers for his
torical research on the period of the
World War and Reconstruction are
duplicated nowhere in the world. In
five years it acquired over 125,000
items, half of which, being either un
printed or out of print, are irreplace
able.
The acquisition of all the important
government documents of every na
tion of the world throughout the war
period and the period of reconstruc
tion following the war is one part of
the program of the Hoover War Li
brary. About three-fourths of this ma
terial has already come to Stanford.
The collection includes both public
papers and many which were not in
tended for circulation.
The collection of official documents
is supplemented by publications of
the leading societies of every nation.
Documents concerning the League of
Nations, the Washington Conference,
and a number of other international
bodies have also been preserved.
Food Research
As a direct outcome of Hoover's
experiences as Food Administrator
during the World War, he proposed
the establishment of a Food Research
Institute to make a scientific investi
gation of food problems. This was
founded at Stanford University in
1921 with funds supplied by the Car
negie Corporation of New York.
In the Institute experimental re
search work is carried 011 in chemical
and botanical laboratories. Emphasis
Is placed 011 the economic phases of
food problems. The World War re
vealed not only the difficulties of
feeding nations on a large scale, but
also an appalling ignorance in regard
to food resources.
Phases of the investigation include
methods of crop estimating and re
porting, the determination of farm
production costs, the forces deter
mining wheat prices, the internation
al movement of wheat, and the eco
nomic problems of the baking indus
try.

is administered by a body of directors
under the chairmanship of Professor
E. D. Adams of the Stanford History
Department.
This Library is a part of there
search equipment of Stanford Univer
sity and the facilities it offers for his
torical research on the period of the
World War and Reconstruction are
duplicated nowhere in the world. In
five years it acquired over 125,000
items, half of which, being either un
printed or out of print, are irreplace
able.
The acquisition of all the important
government documents of every na
tion of the world throughout the war
period and the period of reconstruc
tion following the war is one part of
the program of the Hoover War Li
brary. About three-fourths of this ma
terial has already come to Stanford.
The collection includes both public
papers and many which were not in
tended for circulation.
The collection of official documents
is supplemented by publications of
the leading societies of every nation.
Documents concerning the League of
Nations, the Washington Conference,
and a number of other international
bodies have also been preserved.
Food Research
As a direct outcome of Hoover's
experiences as Food Administrator
during the World War, he proposed
the establishment of a Food Research
Institute to make a scientific investi
gation of food problems. This was
founded at Stanford University in
1921 with funds supplied by the Car
negie Corporation of New York.
In the Institute experimental re
search work is carried 011 in chemical
and botanical laboratories. Emphasis
Is placed 011 the economic phases of
food problems. The World War re
vealed not only the difficulties of
feeding nations on a large scale, but
also an appalling ignorance in regard
to food resources.
Phases of the investigation include
methods of crop estimating and re
porting, the determination of farm
production costs, the forces deter
mining wheat prices, the internation
al movement of wheat, and the eco
nomic problems of the baking indus
try.
Through the efforts of Herbert
Hoover, '9.5, two institutions of na
tional and international value have
been established on the Stanford
campus. They are the Hoover War
Library, founded in 1919, and the
Food Research Institute, which began
its work in 1921.
Mr. Hoover provided the first funds
which made the War Library possi
ble, and four years ago gave the Li
brary a permanent endowment, which
is administered by a body of directors
under the chairmanship of Professor
E. D. Adams of the Stanford History
Department.
