# Herbert Hoover, ’95
## 
### 
Thirty-eight years ago, a little while before Stanford opened its doors for
the first time, a youth hardly past boyhood, came to the campus alone,
unknown, with no friends to greet him. Today that same youth, now a man,
Herbert Hoover, is once more on the campus, known and loved throughout
the world, especially here at his own University and his own home.
Tomorrow he will be officially notified that he is his partyls choice for the
presidency of the United States and will announce to the nation the policies
and principles on which he will stand for election. Millions will listen to his
words, but we of Stanford will take special pride and satisfaction in being
in his actual presence when he speaks on this occasion.
From that first timid approach to the new University until this day Hoover
has been a Stanford man. The fresh young strength of the vigorous early
Stanford entered into him, and back to his University. As it has grown he
has given of the strength that he gained here. Stanford helped to make him
the man he is, and loyally and heartily he has expressed his gratitude and
affection in service.
At Stanford he found the girl, a fellow student in his major department
of Geology, who became his wife and partner in all his activities since they
left Stanford, has earned by her own achievements as fellow-worker with
him her own full share of the admiration and love that goes out to both
from all Stanford people.
Stanford today with deep sentiment hails Herbert Hoover, '95, and Lou
Henry Hoover, '98, known throughout the world but best-known here, honored
throughout the world but most eagerly honored here.
The astounding career of Herbert Hoover from the day he came to
Stanford until now has been told thousands of times. The point that interests
Stanford people is that his advancement has been continuous and is the
result of precisely the qualities that he exhibited as a student —and which we
may claim were brought out and developed by Stanford. Intent upon his
main job, in which he was so outstandingly capable, but not so completely
absorbed in that he did not have time and interest to devote his energies
to the benefit of his fellows —and with no selfish regard whatever for his own
profit. Able to perceive the heart of trouble at Stanford and to drive at the
very center of it with effective correction, strong enough to attract to his side
others to work with him in the common task, he was able to hold their
loyalty to the idea they sought to give substance in action. Quiet, modest,
self-contained; self-reliant but not self-seeking.
Ihe unsystematic conduct of student athletics and student finances and
of student government generally needed straightening out and putting on a
sound basis. Hoover, with the men he gathered to his side, did that and did
it completely—but Hoover refused the salary for being student body treasurer
though he was earning the money for his education. Graduated, he took a job
at the very bottom of his profession as a day laborer in a mine. In an
astoundingly brief time he was earning a salary as a mining engineer that
no man of his age had ever before reached. Soon he was wealthy, the fore
most mining engineer in the world, familiar with every corner of the world,
and with his personally directed enterprises in every part of the earth.
Meantime Stanford had remained the center of the world for the Hoovers,
wherever their duties called them. They held this as their home; their own
house was here, wherever they might for the time be living. Hoover was
elected by the Board of Trustees to their membership, the first alumnus so
elected. His counsel was immediately felt in Stanford affairs and has re
mained persuasive ever since.
The World War broke and Hoover, in London, immediately became the
agent, self-constituted to meet the need, to aid stranded Americans, unable
to get money for their passage home, to obtain the funds they needed for
ship passage. Belgium was invaded and Hoover, the American engineer with
the genius for organization, was made head of the Commission for Relief in
Belgium, which under his direction became practically an independent
government, with its own flag flying over its own ships, carrying food to the
stricken country, dealing with governments as would any government in
arranging for the loading and passage of these ships, having even its own
currency.
The United States entered the war aad Hoover was called home to take
the place most risky of all in its effect on popularity and carried it through
on a basis of voluntary co-operation throughout the nation with such effect
that he became the most-loved man in the nation. The war over, he was
once more at work in the relief of humanity in all parts of the world, not
only with the Commission for Relief in Belgium, but as head of the American
Relief Administration in all countries that were suffering, as a member of
the Supreme Economic Council, struggling with after-war problems, with the
European Children's Relief Council.
Harding became President and made Hoover his Secretary of Commerce,
and Coolidge retained him in that chair. That secretaryship he lifted from a
position of insignificance to a height of greatest importance in its bearing
on the business and industrial welfare of the nation. Moreover, the presi
dents came to rely upon him as an emergency man to deal with any particu
larly difficult problem, whether an industrial crisis or a devastating flood or
a dispute between states.
And now he has been named by the party in power to succeede to the
highest office in the nation when President Coolidge leaves it.
This is the world figure the world knows, but he is to us of his own
University, Herbert Hoover, Stanford, '95.

Stanford today with deep sentiment hails Herbert Hoover, '95, and Lou
Henry Hoover, '98, known throughout the world but best-known here, honored
throughout the world but most eagerly honored here.
The astounding career of Herbert Hoover from the day he came to
Stanford until now has been told thousands of times. The point that interests
Stanford people is that his advancement has been continuous and is the
result of precisely the qualities that he exhibited as a student —and which we
may claim were brought out and developed by Stanford. Intent upon his
main job, in which he was so outstandingly capable, but not so completely
absorbed in that he did not have time and interest to devote his energies
to the benefit of his fellows —and with no selfish regard whatever for his own
profit. Able to perceive the heart of trouble at Stanford and to drive at the
very center of it with effective correction, strong enough to attract to his side
others to work with him in the common task, he was able to hold their
loyalty to the idea they sought to give substance in action. Quiet, modest,
self-contained; self-reliant but not self-seeking.
Ihe unsystematic conduct of student athletics and student finances and
of student government generally needed straightening out and putting on a
sound basis. Hoover, with the men he gathered to his side, did that and did
it completely—but Hoover refused the salary for being student body treasurer
though he was earning the money for his education. Graduated, he took a job
at the very bottom of his profession as a day laborer in a mine. In an
astoundingly brief time he was earning a salary as a mining engineer that
no man of his age had ever before reached. Soon he was wealthy, the fore
most mining engineer in the world, familiar with every corner of the world,
and with his personally directed enterprises in every part of the earth.
Meantime Stanford had remained the center of the world for the Hoovers,
wherever their duties called them. They held this as their home; their own
house was here, wherever they might for the time be living. Hoover was
elected by the Board of Trustees to their membership, the first alumnus so
elected. His counsel was immediately felt in Stanford affairs and has re
mained persuasive ever since.
The World War broke and Hoover, in London, immediately became the
agent, self-constituted to meet the need, to aid stranded Americans, unable
to get money for their passage home, to obtain the funds they needed for
ship passage. Belgium was invaded and Hoover, the American engineer with
the genius for organization, was made head of the Commission for Relief in
Belgium, which under his direction became practically an independent
government, with its own flag flying over its own ships, carrying food to the
stricken country, dealing with governments as would any government in
arranging for the loading and passage of these ships, having even its own
currency.
The United States entered the war aad Hoover was called home to take
the place most risky of all in its effect on popularity and carried it through
on a basis of voluntary co-operation throughout the nation with such effect
that he became the most-loved man in the nation. The war over, he was
once more at work in the relief of humanity in all parts of the world, not
only with the Commission for Relief in Belgium, but as head of the American
Relief Administration in all countries that were suffering, as a member of
the Supreme Economic Council, struggling with after-war problems, with the
European Children's Relief Council.
Harding became President and made Hoover his Secretary of Commerce,
and Coolidge retained him in that chair. That secretaryship he lifted from a
position of insignificance to a height of greatest importance in its bearing
on the business and industrial welfare of the nation. Moreover, the presi
dents came to rely upon him as an emergency man to deal with any particu
larly difficult problem, whether an industrial crisis or a devastating flood or
a dispute between states.
And now he has been named by the party in power to succeede to the
highest office in the nation when President Coolidge leaves it.
This is the world figure the world knows, but he is to us of his own
University, Herbert Hoover, Stanford, '95.
Thirty-eight years ago, a little while before Stanford opened its doors for
the first time, a youth hardly past boyhood, came to the campus alone,
unknown, with no friends to greet him. Today that same youth, now a man,
Herbert Hoover, is once more on the campus, known and loved throughout
the world, especially here at his own University and his own home.
Tomorrow he will be officially notified that he is his partyls choice for the
presidency of the United States and will announce to the nation the policies
and principles on which he will stand for election. Millions will listen to his
words, but we of Stanford will take special pride and satisfaction in being
in his actual presence when he speaks on this occasion.
From that first timid approach to the new University until this day Hoover
has been a Stanford man. The fresh young strength of the vigorous early
Stanford entered into him, and back to his University. As it has grown he
has given of the strength that he gained here. Stanford helped to make him
the man he is, and loyally and heartily he has expressed his gratitude and
affection in service.
At Stanford he found the girl, a fellow student in his major department
of Geology, who became his wife and partner in all his activities since they
left Stanford, has earned by her own achievements as fellow-worker with
him her own full share of the admiration and love that goes out to both
from all Stanford people.

though he was earning the money for his education. Graduated, he took a job
at the very bottom of his profession as a day laborer in a mine. In an
astoundingly brief time he was earning a salary as a mining engineer that
no man of his age had ever before reached. Soon he was wealthy, the fore
most mining engineer in the world, familiar with every corner of the world,
and with his personally directed enterprises in every part of the earth.
Meantime Stanford had remained the center of the world for the Hoovers,
wherever their duties called them. They held this as their home; their own
house was here, wherever they might for the time be living. Hoover was
elected by the Board of Trustees to their membership, the first alumnus so
elected. His counsel was immediately felt in Stanford affairs and has re
mained persuasive ever since.
The World War broke and Hoover, in London, immediately became the
agent, self-constituted to meet the need, to aid stranded Americans, unable
to get money for their passage home, to obtain the funds they needed for
ship passage. Belgium was invaded and Hoover, the American engineer with
the genius for organization, was made head of the Commission for Relief in
Belgium, which under his direction became practically an independent
government, with its own flag flying over its own ships, carrying food to the
stricken country, dealing with governments as would any government in
arranging for the loading and passage of these ships, having even its own
currency.
The United States entered the war aad Hoover was called home to take
the place most risky of all in its effect on popularity and carried it through
on a basis of voluntary co-operation throughout the nation with such effect
that he became the most-loved man in the nation. The war over, he was
once more at work in the relief of humanity in all parts of the world, not
only with the Commission for Relief in Belgium, but as head of the American
Relief Administration in all countries that were suffering, as a member of
the Supreme Economic Council, struggling with after-war problems, with the
European Children's Relief Council.
Harding became President and made Hoover his Secretary of Commerce,
and Coolidge retained him in that chair. That secretaryship he lifted from a
position of insignificance to a height of greatest importance in its bearing
on the business and industrial welfare of the nation. Moreover, the presi
dents came to rely upon him as an emergency man to deal with any particu
larly difficult problem, whether an industrial crisis or a devastating flood or
a dispute between states.
And now he has been named by the party in power to succeede to the
highest office in the nation when President Coolidge leaves it.
This is the world figure the world knows, but he is to us of his own
University, Herbert Hoover, Stanford, '95.
Thirty-eight years ago, a little while before Stanford opened its doors for
the first time, a youth hardly past boyhood, came to the campus alone,
unknown, with no friends to greet him. Today that same youth, now a man,
Herbert Hoover, is once more on the campus, known and loved throughout
the world, especially here at his own University and his own home.
Tomorrow he will be officially notified that he is his partyls choice for the
presidency of the United States and will announce to the nation the policies
and principles on which he will stand for election. Millions will listen to his
words, but we of Stanford will take special pride and satisfaction in being
in his actual presence when he speaks on this occasion.
From that first timid approach to the new University until this day Hoover
has been a Stanford man. The fresh young strength of the vigorous early
Stanford entered into him, and back to his University. As it has grown he
has given of the strength that he gained here. Stanford helped to make him
the man he is, and loyally and heartily he has expressed his gratitude and
affection in service.
At Stanford he found the girl, a fellow student in his major department
of Geology, who became his wife and partner in all his activities since they
left Stanford, has earned by her own achievements as fellow-worker with
him her own full share of the admiration and love that goes out to both
from all Stanford people.
Stanford today with deep sentiment hails Herbert Hoover, '95, and Lou
Henry Hoover, '98, known throughout the world but best-known here, honored
throughout the world but most eagerly honored here.
The astounding career of Herbert Hoover from the day he came to
Stanford until now has been told thousands of times. The point that interests
Stanford people is that his advancement has been continuous and is the
result of precisely the qualities that he exhibited as a student —and which we
may claim were brought out and developed by Stanford. Intent upon his
main job, in which he was so outstandingly capable, but not so completely
absorbed in that he did not have time and interest to devote his energies
to the benefit of his fellows —and with no selfish regard whatever for his own
profit. Able to perceive the heart of trouble at Stanford and to drive at the
very center of it with effective correction, strong enough to attract to his side
others to work with him in the common task, he was able to hold their
loyalty to the idea they sought to give substance in action. Quiet, modest,
self-contained; self-reliant but not self-seeking.
Ihe unsystematic conduct of student athletics and student finances and
of student government generally needed straightening out and putting on a
sound basis. Hoover, with the men he gathered to his side, did that and did
it completely—but Hoover refused the salary for being student body treasurer
though he was earning the money for his education. Graduated, he took a job
