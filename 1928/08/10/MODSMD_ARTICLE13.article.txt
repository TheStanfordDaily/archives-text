Tonight "The Queen's Husband," under the direction of Gordon Davis, will
be presented on the campus for the second time this quarter. Judging by
the first, performance this should be another success for the Stanford
Dramatics department.
With Ctordon Davis and Betty Wilbur in the leading roles, recreating
the parts so adequately done by them in the first showing, and with the
production coming as a sort of prelude to the activities of tomorrow, a record
audience is expected.
At the presentations this summer there has been just one thing to draw
from interest of the productions. This one thing was the fault of certain
people in the audience.
There may be cause for five or six people to come late to a performance
but there is no good reason for forty or fifty people doing so. At the last
campus production, "The Chief Thing," almost the whole first act was
inaudible to people sitting back of the tenth row because of the noise made
by late comers.
Tonight's performance begins at S:2O o'clock. Don't be one of those
who are perpetually late. Think of the other fellow.
