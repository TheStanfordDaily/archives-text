The facts of Hoover's administra
tive and executive accomplishments
are not a new story. Everyone knows
of his success as a mining expert in
China, how he helped in the defense
of the foreign quarter at Tientsin dur
ing the Boxer siege, how at the out
break of the war he dropped all busi
ness activities to undertake the feed
ing of ten million Belgians and by the
sheer force of his character gained
the confidence and co-operation of
both allied and enemy governments
in his colossal task.
His accomplishments speak ade
quately of his character; but there
are also countless stories that tell of
the same thing in a more intimate
and vivid way. Today these stories
are being gathered together and are
assuming a new significance, as must
the reminiscences about any man
who has become a national figure.
They are all good stories and well
worth hearing.
There is a story that points to both
his whimsical sense of humor and his
natural bent for executive positions.
When he first arrived at Stanford he
inquired about available jobs, and was
told that the only job that seemed to
be "lying about loose" was that of
waiting on table. The idea didn't ap
peal to Hoover. "I suppose it's true
that 'they also serve who only stand
and wait,' "he is reported to have re
plied, adding that "I don't know that
I need depend on a job that is 'lying
about loose; I shouldn't wonder if I'd
have to look out for an opening that
hasn't been offered to every passerby
and become shop-worn."
He created brand new jobs for him
self, such as organizing the first laun
dry on the campus, and held various
executive positions in the student
body as well.
In "The Life and Letters of Walter
H. Page" an incident is related which
illustrates the rapidity and efficiency
with which Hoover works. Impressed
by the young engineer's quiet effi
ciency in returning Americans strand
ed in Europe at the outbreak of the
war, and realizing the need of the
starving Belgians for immediate re
lief, Page broached the subject to
Hoover.
In an interview at which five men
were present the matter was fully dis
cussed. The magnitude of a scheme
undertaking to feed an entire nation
for an indefinite period was pointed
out. The British Admiralty probably
would not permit relief ships through
the blockade for fear the food would
be appropriated by the German army.

Unless the British Government could
be convinced that this would not hap
pen it seemed as though the work
could not be undertaken, and the
question arose as to how this should
be accomplished.
"There is only one way," said Page.
"Some government must give its
guarantee that this food will get to
the Belgian people. And of course
there is only one government that
can do that. It must be the American
Government."
Page pointed out that a director
was needed who could take complete
charge of the enterprise, and added:
"Hoover, you're It!" To quote from
the book: "Mr. Hoover made no re
ply; he neither accepted nor rejected
the proposal. He merely glanced at
the clock, then got up and silently
Jeft the room. In a few minutes he
returned and entered again into the
discussion.
" 'Hoover, why did you get up and
leave us so abruptly?' asked Page,
a little puzzled over this behaviour.
" 'I saw by the clock,' came the
answer .... 'that there was an hour
left before the Exchange closed in
New York. So I went out and cabled,
buying several millions of bushels of
wheat —for the Belgians, of course.' "
The story was one of Page's favo
rites.
Hoover is not only an executive
wonder; he has the interests of the
scholar. While in London he and Mrs.
Hoover undertook the translation
from Latin of Agricola's "De Re
Metallica" —a new book now on ex
hibit in the upstairs cases of the
Library and in the Hoover War Li
brary.
"Who in the world was Agricola,
and what does he matter to you?"
Hoover was asked.
"Agricola, my dear fellow," replied
Hoover, "was the Latinized name of
a German mining engineer who lived
in the early part of the sixteenth cen
tury—a time when it was not only
the fashion to turn one's name into
Latin, but to write all books of any
importance in that language. He mat
ters a good deal to anyone who hap
pens to be especially interested in
the science of mining. This volume
we are at work on is the cornerstone
of that science."
"How does it happen that it has
never been translated before?" asked
the friend.
"It isn't a particularly easy job,"
replied Hoover, explaining that, as
Agricola's Latin was limited, only a
mining expert could possibly under
stand the book, and that most mining

experts, even if possessed of a suffi
cient knowledge of Latin, had some
thing more paying to do.
"I see," said the friend whimsically,
"you are doing this because you have
nothing more paying to do!"
"Yes," said Hoover quietly, "there
is nothing that is more paying than
the thing that is your work —because
you particularly want to do it."
There is another incident given in
"The Life and Letters of Walter H.
Page" which throws light on Hoover's
character; this time as the sympa
thetic Good Samaritan. During the
war an old Belgian woman with an
income of $15 a week reduced her
living expenses to $7.50 and with the
other half of the money bought milk
and, filling a basket with bottles,
went to the stations to give free milk
to hungry-looking babies.
Then one day the police refused
to admit her to the platforms because
she didn't belong to an organized re
lief committee. Hoover saw her, obvi
ously much troubled and, finding out
the situation, took her to headquar
ters. "Do you see this good old lady?"
he asked. "She puts you and me and
everybody else to shame —do you un
derstand?" The old lady was admitted
to the platforms again, and continued
to distribute milk.
Dr. Wilbur points out Hoover's
generosity with an illustration. A mu
tual friend had endeavored, without
success, to borrow money from vari
ous acquaintances. Wilbur warned
; Hoover against the man, but Hoover
had already lent him $50.
"Well, you'll never get it back,"
Wilbur said. "All right," replied
Hoover, "it was worth $50 to see him
smile."

character; this time as the sympa
thetic Good Samaritan. During the
war an old Belgian woman with an
income of $15 a week reduced her
living expenses to $7.50 and with the
other half of the money bought milk
and, filling a basket with bottles,
went to the stations to give free milk
to hungry-looking babies.
Then one day the police refused
to admit her to the platforms because
she didn't belong to an organized re
lief committee. Hoover saw her, obvi
ously much troubled and, finding out
the situation, took her to headquar
ters. "Do you see this good old lady?"
he asked. "She puts you and me and
everybody else to shame —do you un
derstand?" The old lady was admitted
to the platforms again, and continued
to distribute milk.
Dr. Wilbur points out Hoover's
generosity with an illustration. A mu
tual friend had endeavored, without
success, to borrow money from vari
ous acquaintances. Wilbur warned
; Hoover against the man, but Hoover
had already lent him $50.
"Well, you'll never get it back,"
Wilbur said. "All right," replied
Hoover, "it was worth $50 to see him
smile."

The facts of Hoover's administra
tive and executive accomplishments
are not a new story. Everyone knows
of his success as a mining expert in
China, how he helped in the defense
of the foreign quarter at Tientsin dur
ing the Boxer siege, how at the out
break of the war he dropped all busi
ness activities to undertake the feed
ing of ten million Belgians and by the
sheer force of his character gained
the confidence and co-operation of
both allied and enemy governments
in his colossal task.
His accomplishments speak ade
quately of his character; but there
are also countless stories that tell of
the same thing in a more intimate
and vivid way. Today these stories
are being gathered together and are
assuming a new significance, as must
the reminiscences about any man
who has become a national figure.
They are all good stories and well
worth hearing.
There is a story that points to both
his whimsical sense of humor and his
natural bent for executive positions.
When he first arrived at Stanford he
inquired about available jobs, and was
told that the only job that seemed to
be "lying about loose" was that of
waiting on table. The idea didn't ap
peal to Hoover. "I suppose it's true
that 'they also serve who only stand
and wait,' "he is reported to have re
plied, adding that "I don't know that
I need depend on a job that is 'lying
about loose; I shouldn't wonder if I'd
have to look out for an opening that
hasn't been offered to every passerby
and become shop-worn."
He created brand new jobs for him
self, such as organizing the first laun
dry on the campus, and held various
executive positions in the student
body as well.
In "The Life and Letters of Walter
H. Page" an incident is related which
illustrates the rapidity and efficiency
with which Hoover works. Impressed
by the young engineer's quiet effi
ciency in returning Americans strand
ed in Europe at the outbreak of the
war, and realizing the need of the
starving Belgians for immediate re
lief, Page broached the subject to
Hoover.
In an interview at which five men
were present the matter was fully dis
cussed. The magnitude of a scheme
undertaking to feed an entire nation
for an indefinite period was pointed
out. The British Admiralty probably
would not permit relief ships through
the blockade for fear the food would
be appropriated by the German army.

Unless the British Government could
be convinced that this would not hap
pen it seemed as though the work
could not be undertaken, and the
question arose as to how this should
be accomplished.
"There is only one way," said Page.
"Some government must give its
guarantee that this food will get to
the Belgian people. And of course
there is only one government that
can do that. It must be the American
Government."
Page pointed out that a director
was needed who could take complete
charge of the enterprise, and added:
"Hoover, you're It!" To quote from
the book: "Mr. Hoover made no re
ply; he neither accepted nor rejected
the proposal. He merely glanced at
the clock, then got up and silently
Jeft the room. In a few minutes he
returned and entered again into the
discussion.
" 'Hoover, why did you get up and
leave us so abruptly?' asked Page,
a little puzzled over this behaviour.
" 'I saw by the clock,' came the
answer .... 'that there was an hour
left before the Exchange closed in
New York. So I went out and cabled,
buying several millions of bushels of
wheat —for the Belgians, of course.' "
The story was one of Page's favo
rites.
Hoover is not only an executive
wonder; he has the interests of the
scholar. While in London he and Mrs.
Hoover undertook the translation
from Latin of Agricola's "De Re
Metallica" —a new book now on ex
hibit in the upstairs cases of the
Library and in the Hoover War Li
brary.
"Who in the world was Agricola,
and what does he matter to you?"
Hoover was asked.
"Agricola, my dear fellow," replied
Hoover, "was the Latinized name of
a German mining engineer who lived
in the early part of the sixteenth cen
tury—a time when it was not only
the fashion to turn one's name into
Latin, but to write all books of any
importance in that language. He mat
ters a good deal to anyone who hap
pens to be especially interested in
the science of mining. This volume
we are at work on is the cornerstone
of that science."
"How does it happen that it has
never been translated before?" asked
the friend.
"It isn't a particularly easy job,"
replied Hoover, explaining that, as
Agricola's Latin was limited, only a
mining expert could possibly under
stand the book, and that most mining

experts, even if possessed of a suffi
cient knowledge of Latin, had some
thing more paying to do.
"I see," said the friend whimsically,
"you are doing this because you have
nothing more paying to do!"
"Yes," said Hoover quietly, "there
is nothing that is more paying than
the thing that is your work —because
you particularly want to do it."
There is another incident given in

"Agricola, my dear fellow," replied
Hoover, "was the Latinized name of
a German mining engineer who lived
in the early part of the sixteenth cen
tury—a time when it was not only
the fashion to turn one's name into
Latin, but to write all books of any
importance in that language. He mat
ters a good deal to anyone who hap
pens to be especially interested in
the science of mining. This volume
we are at work on is the cornerstone
of that science."
"How does it happen that it has
never been translated before?" asked
the friend.
"It isn't a particularly easy job,"
replied Hoover, explaining that, as
Agricola's Latin was limited, only a
mining expert could possibly under
stand the book, and that most mining

experts, even if possessed of a suffi
cient knowledge of Latin, had some
thing more paying to do.
"I see," said the friend whimsically,
"you are doing this because you have
nothing more paying to do!"
"Yes," said Hoover quietly, "there
is nothing that is more paying than
the thing that is your work —because
you particularly want to do it."
There is another incident given in
"The Life and Letters of Walter H.
Page" which throws light on Hoover's
character; this time as the sympa
thetic Good Samaritan. During the
war an old Belgian woman with an
income of $15 a week reduced her
living expenses to $7.50 and with the
other half of the money bought milk
and, filling a basket with bottles,
went to the stations to give free milk
to hungry-looking babies.
Then one day the police refused
to admit her to the platforms because
she didn't belong to an organized re
lief committee. Hoover saw her, obvi
ously much troubled and, finding out
the situation, took her to headquar
ters. "Do you see this good old lady?"
he asked. "She puts you and me and
everybody else to shame —do you un
derstand?" The old lady was admitted
to the platforms again, and continued
to distribute milk.
Dr. Wilbur points out Hoover's
generosity with an illustration. A mu
tual friend had endeavored, without
success, to borrow money from vari
ous acquaintances. Wilbur warned
; Hoover against the man, but Hoover
had already lent him $50.
"Well, you'll never get it back,"
Wilbur said. "All right," replied
Hoover, "it was worth $50 to see him
smile."

The facts of Hoover's administra
tive and executive accomplishments
are not a new story. Everyone knows
of his success as a mining expert in
China, how he helped in the defense
of the foreign quarter at Tientsin dur
ing the Boxer siege, how at the out
break of the war he dropped all busi
ness activities to undertake the feed
ing of ten million Belgians and by the
sheer force of his character gained
the confidence and co-operation of
both allied and enemy governments
in his colossal task.
His accomplishments speak ade
quately of his character; but there
are also countless stories that tell of
the same thing in a more intimate
and vivid way. Today these stories
are being gathered together and are
assuming a new significance, as must
the reminiscences about any man
who has become a national figure.
They are all good stories and well
worth hearing.
There is a story that points to both
his whimsical sense of humor and his
natural bent for executive positions.
When he first arrived at Stanford he
inquired about available jobs, and was
told that the only job that seemed to
be "lying about loose" was that of
waiting on table. The idea didn't ap
peal to Hoover. "I suppose it's true
that 'they also serve who only stand
and wait,' "he is reported to have re
plied, adding that "I don't know that
I need depend on a job that is 'lying
about loose; I shouldn't wonder if I'd
have to look out for an opening that
hasn't been offered to every passerby
and become shop-worn."
He created brand new jobs for him
self, such as organizing the first laun
dry on the campus, and held various
executive positions in the student
body as well.
In "The Life and Letters of Walter
H. Page" an incident is related which
illustrates the rapidity and efficiency
with which Hoover works. Impressed
by the young engineer's quiet effi
ciency in returning Americans strand
ed in Europe at the outbreak of the
war, and realizing the need of the
starving Belgians for immediate re
lief, Page broached the subject to
Hoover.
In an interview at which five men
were present the matter was fully dis
cussed. The magnitude of a scheme
undertaking to feed an entire nation
for an indefinite period was pointed
out. The British Admiralty probably
would not permit relief ships through
the blockade for fear the food would
be appropriated by the German army.

Unless the British Government could
be convinced that this would not hap
pen it seemed as though the work
could not be undertaken, and the
question arose as to how this should
be accomplished.
"There is only one way," said Page.
"Some government must give its
guarantee that this food will get to
the Belgian people. And of course
there is only one government that
can do that. It must be the American
Government."
Page pointed out that a director
was needed who could take complete
charge of the enterprise, and added:
"Hoover, you're It!" To quote from
the book: "Mr. Hoover made no re
ply; he neither accepted nor rejected
the proposal. He merely glanced at
the clock, then got up and silently
Jeft the room. In a few minutes he
returned and entered again into the
discussion.
" 'Hoover, why did you get up and
leave us so abruptly?' asked Page,
a little puzzled over this behaviour.
" 'I saw by the clock,' came the
answer .... 'that there was an hour
left before the Exchange closed in
New York. So I went out and cabled,
buying several millions of bushels of
wheat —for the Belgians, of course.' "
The story was one of Page's favo
rites.
Hoover is not only an executive
wonder; he has the interests of the
scholar. While in London he and Mrs.
Hoover undertook the translation
from Latin of Agricola's "De Re
Metallica" —a new book now on ex
hibit in the upstairs cases of the
Library and in the Hoover War Li
brary.
"Who in the world was Agricola,
and what does he matter to you?"
Hoover was asked.
"Agricola, my dear fellow," replied
Hoover, "was the Latinized name of

was needed who could take complete
charge of the enterprise, and added:
"Hoover, you're It!" To quote from
the book: "Mr. Hoover made no re
ply; he neither accepted nor rejected
the proposal. He merely glanced at
the clock, then got up and silently
Jeft the room. In a few minutes he
returned and entered again into the
discussion.
" 'Hoover, why did you get up and
leave us so abruptly?' asked Page,
a little puzzled over this behaviour.
" 'I saw by the clock,' came the
answer .... 'that there was an hour
left before the Exchange closed in
New York. So I went out and cabled,
buying several millions of bushels of
wheat —for the Belgians, of course.' "
The story was one of Page's favo
rites.
Hoover is not only an executive
wonder; he has the interests of the
scholar. While in London he and Mrs.
Hoover undertook the translation
from Latin of Agricola's "De Re
Metallica" —a new book now on ex
hibit in the upstairs cases of the
Library and in the Hoover War Li
brary.
"Who in the world was Agricola,
and what does he matter to you?"
Hoover was asked.
"Agricola, my dear fellow," replied
Hoover, "was the Latinized name of
a German mining engineer who lived
in the early part of the sixteenth cen
tury—a time when it was not only
the fashion to turn one's name into
Latin, but to write all books of any
importance in that language. He mat
ters a good deal to anyone who hap
pens to be especially interested in
the science of mining. This volume
we are at work on is the cornerstone
of that science."
"How does it happen that it has
never been translated before?" asked
the friend.
"It isn't a particularly easy job,"
replied Hoover, explaining that, as
Agricola's Latin was limited, only a
mining expert could possibly under
stand the book, and that most mining

experts, even if possessed of a suffi
cient knowledge of Latin, had some
thing more paying to do.
"I see," said the friend whimsically,
"you are doing this because you have
nothing more paying to do!"
"Yes," said Hoover quietly, "there
is nothing that is more paying than
the thing that is your work —because
you particularly want to do it."
There is another incident given in
"The Life and Letters of Walter H.
Page" which throws light on Hoover's
character; this time as the sympa
thetic Good Samaritan. During the
war an old Belgian woman with an
income of $15 a week reduced her
living expenses to $7.50 and with the
other half of the money bought milk
and, filling a basket with bottles,
went to the stations to give free milk
to hungry-looking babies.
Then one day the police refused
to admit her to the platforms because
she didn't belong to an organized re
lief committee. Hoover saw her, obvi
ously much troubled and, finding out
the situation, took her to headquar
ters. "Do you see this good old lady?"
he asked. "She puts you and me and
everybody else to shame —do you un
derstand?" The old lady was admitted
to the platforms again, and continued
to distribute milk.
Dr. Wilbur points out Hoover's
generosity with an illustration. A mu
tual friend had endeavored, without
success, to borrow money from vari
ous acquaintances. Wilbur warned
; Hoover against the man, but Hoover
had already lent him $50.
"Well, you'll never get it back,"
Wilbur said. "All right," replied
Hoover, "it was worth $50 to see him
smile."

The facts of Hoover's administra
tive and executive accomplishments
are not a new story. Everyone knows
of his success as a mining expert in
China, how he helped in the defense
of the foreign quarter at Tientsin dur
ing the Boxer siege, how at the out
break of the war he dropped all busi
ness activities to undertake the feed
ing of ten million Belgians and by the
sheer force of his character gained
the confidence and co-operation of
both allied and enemy governments
in his colossal task.
His accomplishments speak ade
quately of his character; but there
are also countless stories that tell of
the same thing in a more intimate
and vivid way. Today these stories
are being gathered together and are
assuming a new significance, as must
the reminiscences about any man
who has become a national figure.
They are all good stories and well
worth hearing.
There is a story that points to both
his whimsical sense of humor and his
natural bent for executive positions.
When he first arrived at Stanford he
inquired about available jobs, and was
told that the only job that seemed to
be "lying about loose" was that of
waiting on table. The idea didn't ap
peal to Hoover. "I suppose it's true
that 'they also serve who only stand
and wait,' "he is reported to have re
plied, adding that "I don't know that
I need depend on a job that is 'lying
about loose; I shouldn't wonder if I'd
have to look out for an opening that
hasn't been offered to every passerby
and become shop-worn."
He created brand new jobs for him
self, such as organizing the first laun
dry on the campus, and held various
executive positions in the student
body as well.
In "The Life and Letters of Walter
H. Page" an incident is related which
illustrates the rapidity and efficiency
with which Hoover works. Impressed
by the young engineer's quiet effi
ciency in returning Americans strand
ed in Europe at the outbreak of the
war, and realizing the need of the
starving Belgians for immediate re
lief, Page broached the subject to
Hoover.
In an interview at which five men
were present the matter was fully dis
cussed. The magnitude of a scheme
undertaking to feed an entire nation
for an indefinite period was pointed
out. The British Admiralty probably
would not permit relief ships through
the blockade for fear the food would
be appropriated by the German army.

Unless the British Government could
be convinced that this would not hap
pen it seemed as though the work
could not be undertaken, and the
question arose as to how this should
be accomplished.
"There is only one way," said Page.
"Some government must give its
guarantee that this food will get to
the Belgian people. And of course
there is only one government that
can do that. It must be the American
Government."
Page pointed out that a director
was needed who could take complete
charge of the enterprise, and added:
"Hoover, you're It!" To quote from
the book: "Mr. Hoover made no re
