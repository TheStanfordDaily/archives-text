# DR. BECKER DELIVERS TUESDAY LECTURE ON HISTORICAL SUBJECTS
## Cornell Professor Stresses Importance of Knowing Daily Happenings 
### 
Dr. Carl Becker, head of the de
irtment of history in Cornell Univer
ty, spoke in the Little Theatre on
nesday evening on the subject,
ivery Man His Own Historian."
"A knowledge of every day happen
gs," said Dr. Becker, "is vital and
icessary to life. To live in a com
unity of ordered lives certain things
list be remembered if one engages
historical research of ordinary
ents.
One can get along without having
very comprehensive knowledge of
ents. Every one can extend his
lowledge of events as they deal
th his occupation, as far as his
riosity extends.
Dr. Becker recounted a very inter
ting story of how Agricola, an old
itin book that contained specific in
rmation concerning the location of
1 mines in Germany was laborious
translated by Herbert Hoover and
■ii Henry, two young students espe
illy interested in Geology and min
*. This translation afterward led
the discovery of rich mineral bear
? lodes on the old sites of the
nes that ha dso long ago been aban
ned and given up as worthless.
\ Hoover did this work because he
s to become a mining engineer and
was curious to know all about
nes, old as well as new. This was
extension of his occupation. He
ght have got along very well with
t this knowledge but he was inter
ed in extending his consciousness
history in connection with his fu
e occupation.
According to Dr. Becker, the more
iosity one has to broaden the past,
• present, and to look into the fu
e, the greater the enrichment of
■ conscious power, and consequent
the intelligence. What you can re
mber and use only is your own.
cts locked up in libraries will keep
cold storage well enough. History
a living thing, in the mind of him
o cares to entertain it. All history
only life.
