# "ROMEO AND JULIET" WILL BE PRESENTED TOMORROW NIGHT
## Spanish Atmosphere To Be Used at Production in Court of Union 
### 
"Romeo and Juliet" is to be pre
sented in the Union Court at 8:45
o'clock tomorrow night by Margret
Shedd Kisich's class in outdoor play
production with the aid of Genevieve
f)owns, Carol Wynn, and Donald Clux
ton.
The play is to have a Spanish
.setting and is treated from a modern
conception of a dramatic creation.
The production has been arranged in
eleven continuous scenes devoid of
intermissions. A group of women in
the double role of expositor chorus
and emotional commentary will be
used. The play is an experimental pre
sentation which calls for the introduc
tion of several other innovations in
the dramatic field. The most out
standing of these is the use of Span
ish costumes and background to point
up the modern aspects of the play.
Mrs. Kisich said, when speaking of
the performance, "We are hoping that
those who come to the play will come
merely to see a play, not Shakespeare.
Although we do not want to offend
anyone's preconceived ideas of Shake
spearean tradition we do want to
make them forget that tradition, if
possible, in the enjoyment of a vital,
youthful love story."
Many noted amateur actors and one
professional, Miss Downs, are in the
cast. Bob Kirkwood, Kitty Peck, Don
ald Cluxton, Carol Wynn, Verna Han
nah, and Glen Josephson are the most
outstanding of these.
