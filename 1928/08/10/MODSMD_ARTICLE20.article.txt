# ELIZABETH WILBUR TO PLAY IN PRODUCTION AT OAKLAND THEATER
## 
### 
Elizabeth Wilbur, who is playing
the role of the Qusen in "The
Queen's Husband," has accepted a
contract to play with Robert Warwick
in "Interference" at the Fulton Thea
ter in Oakland, it was announced yes
terday.
Miss Wilbur refused a part in "The
Admirable Crichton," a professional
production by Warwick's company,
last Tuesday, because it would mean
deserting the cast of "The Queen's
Husband."
The cast for "Interference" has not
been announced to the newspapers,
but is is rumored that she is to play
one of the leads. The play is one of
the biggest stage hits of the season
and Miss Wilbur's performance is ex
pected to be one of her best creations.
She is returning to the professional
stage after more than a month's ab
sence. Miss Wilbur left Marjorie
Rambeau's company to play with
Gordon Davis in "The Queen's Hus
band," expecting to return after its
presentation; but when public de
mand called for a second production,
she decided to cancel her contract
and remain with the show.
Elizabeth Wilbur is not a stranger
to patrons of the Fulton Theater, for
she played there for 27 weeks last
season. She is expected to leave
Stanford immediately after tonight's
showing of "The Queen's Husband"
to start rehearsals in Oakland.
