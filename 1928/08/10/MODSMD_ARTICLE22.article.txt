# TRAFFIC NEAR HOOVER HOME CAUSES PROBLEM
## 
### 
Even the campus speed cop has his
hands full since Hoover's nomination,
for the traffic in the vicinity of
Hoover's home has necessitated con
siderable attention. Officer John Olsen
says that from three to four hundred
cars circled about the Hoover resi
dence each week-end, the heaviest
traffic being in the afternoon. A spe
cial traffic director and police officer
are on duty all the time.
