# "Right You Are If You Think You Are" To Have Many Stars In Cast
## Helvenston Will Introduce Sets Which Enhance Interior Scheme 
### Laird Doyle 
"Right You Are If You Think You
Are," Pirandello's metaphysical melo
drama, can be said to be an avowed
intellectual drama of these syllogistic
times. It is not a subtle play, nor is it
an obvious work; it contains a pro
found thought wrapped in deft and
engaging foolery. It treats with hu
man illusions and disillusionment
scrambled in a mesh of sly, sardonic
mysteries.
Anna May Price is cast in the role
of Signora Ponza. This part is a por
trayal which calls for intense emotion
under restraint. To her has fallen a
piece of dramatic work which she can
handle in a most satisfying manner.
Murphy, Fisher in Cast
Pat Murphy is playing Ponza, while
Dick Fisher has been cast as Com
mendatore Agazzi. Both Murphy and
Fisher should lend a positive strength
to the play. However, Fisher is the
more experienced of the two.
Dr. Paul Clyde, who was acclaimed
for his work in the faculty play some
years ago at Stanford, is to again
tread hte boards. He has been cast
as the Prefect and is expected to be
an interesting characterization.
Salinger Is Pianist
Herman Salinger, a member of the
German department, is playing a role
comparable to one played by John
Jago. Jago was the pianist in "The
Chief Thing."
Louise Wilson and Edwina Ewing
of Palo Alto„are also in the cast. Miss
Wilson is a fine actress and has been
prominent in dramatics for some time.
Dick Fisher, Virginia Volland, Carol
Wynn, and Irving Rosenblatt are
familiar actors to the campus this
quarter. All of them have acted in
other campus performances this sum
mer. It is fortunate that Gordon
Davis is able to have them in the cast.
Stage Decorations Unique
"Right You Are If You Think You
Are" presents a different stage deco
ration than either "The Queen's Hus
band" or "The Chief Thing." One of
fered a chance for exaggeration of
Continental roccoco motif while the
other called for fantastic creation.
"Right You Are" demands neither of
these treatments; it necessitates an
approach from the scenic aspect—a
simplified but deft handling of the
characteristics of the Italian interior.
As in the New York setting for "The
Command to Love" the artist em
ployed a decorative use of a practical
stairway too small for use; so in the
set for "Right You Are" certain units
of decoration are being introduced
which will enhance the ornate scheme
of the interior. Helvenston will un
doubtedly develop a distinct contrast
to his other work.
