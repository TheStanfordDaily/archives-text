# HOOVER'S RELIEF WORK PRAISED BY FORMER GERMAN ARMY OFFICER
## 
### 
"Germany appreciated Hoover's re
lief work in Belgium and did its ut
most to aid him in it," said Dr. Bruno
Bruhn during a recent visit to the
University. Dr. Bruhn was a captain
in the German army in Belgium at
the time Hoover was carrying on his
work there, and he was appointed the
official contact man to work with
Hoover in arranging for the trans
portation of goods and in the facilita
tion of the relief work in general.
Captain Bruhn necessarily came in
frequent contact with Hoover in the
manifold projects of the Belgian Re
lief and was able to observe him at
close range. To him Hoover exempli
fies the best spirit of America in his
honesty, his industry, and his ability
to do what he set out to do.
"I admire Hoover." he said, "for his
efficiency, his impartiality, and his
will in directing the big relief or
ganization in its many functons. Not
talk but action was his strong point."
