# ALCOVE STORE EXHIBIT OF SIMONS WOODCUTS WILL END NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Kenneth Carnahan, former Stanford
man, who is sponsoring the exhibition
of the works of Howard Simon, fam
ous artist, at the Alcove Bookstore,
announced today that the exhibit
would close the last of next week.
Carnahan was fortunate in getting
the exhibit as this is the first time
that Simon's works have been shown
outside of an art gallery and the only
time that such a showing has been
held in Palo Alto.
The works are woodcuts and pencil
sketches of both French and American
scenes and characters. San Francisco
and Paris are the subjects for many
of the creations. The characteriza
tions are considered to be his finest
work.
An invitation has been extended to
all Stanford students interested in art
and it is necessary that they avail
themselves of this opportunity either
this or next week.
