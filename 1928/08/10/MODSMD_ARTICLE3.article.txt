# JORDAN AND WILBUR RECALL ASSOCIATIONS WITH HOOVER
## 
### 
As I recall Herbert Hoover, the
Stanford undergraduate, he was a
quiet, undemonstrative young
man, intent on his major interest
at Stanford, which was training
himself in geology and mining,
but able to find time for service
to his fellows, which took the
form of straightening out student
body finances from their first
chaos and organizing student
body business in an orderly
fashion.
The Herbert Hoover that I have
known during the years since his
student days has shown the same
traits and exercised the same
abilities on a scale that has grown
as he has grown in capacity
and opportunity. The field of his
operations has expanded from the
confines of the Stanford campus
to include the whole world. For
the last seven years, as Secretary
of Commerce and valued advisor
of two presidents, he has spent
all of his energies and his talents
in straightening out and reorgan
izing his department for the bene
fit of his own nation and fellow
countrymen.
Orderliness, directness, ability
to get at the real heart of a prob
lem and then to act rightly and
effectively characterized Hoover
the student and characterize
Hoover the government executive.
In between, those qualities
marked and colored his career as
engineer, business director, and
head of the greatest humanitarian
project history has ever known,
the Commission for Relief in BeJ
gium.
As Food Administrator he made
one of the most intricate and dif
ficult pieces of work seem almost
easy. As Secretary of Commerce
he has elevated a position which
previously was regarded as neg
ligible to a plane of infinite
significance in its helpful con
tacts with all elements of the
people.
—DAVID STARR JORDAN.

Herbert Hoover comes back to
Stanford the same man who came
here first at the time the Univer
sity opened and who has contin
ued to come back as often as his
duties have permitted. When he
entered Stanford in 1891 he be
came a Stanford man for all time.
Stanford became an integral part
of him and he has made himself
an integral part of Stanford.
As a student he placed the
stamp of his ability and convic
tions on the conduct of student
affairs so indelibly that it has
lasted through all the years. As a
trustee he has continued to help
hold Stanford to its own course
in moving ahead with the chang
ing world.
For years his home and his
heart have been at Stanford, but
his work in the world has kept
him away from here except for
such brief visits as he could
snatch. He has come back here
now only for a brief stay, to leave
once more in a few days for tasks
that await him elsewhere.
As a student Hoover won our
admiration and our pride in be
ing associated with him in enter
prises for the good of the Stan
ford student body. As a leading
American and as an outstanding
figure in promoting world welfare
he has earned the same admira
tion and pride from all who have
worked with him—from the peo
ples of all the world and especially
from the American people.
It is a rare opportunity that we
of Stanford enjoy—to have this
son of Stanford once more on the
campus, this time to receive of
ficially his notification as a candi
date for the greatest position in
the country, particularly since we
think of him as a man who be
longs to us in a personal way and
of whom we have been proud be
cause he has been most consist
ent in his sense of public service
and of human service.

himself in geology and mining,
but able to find time for service
to his fellows, which took the
form of straightening out student
body finances from their first
chaos and organizing student
body business in an orderly
fashion.
The Herbert Hoover that I have
known during the years since his
student days has shown the same
traits and exercised the same
abilities on a scale that has grown
as he has grown in capacity
and opportunity. The field of his
operations has expanded from the
confines of the Stanford campus
to include the whole world. For
the last seven years, as Secretary
of Commerce and valued advisor
of two presidents, he has spent
all of his energies and his talents
in straightening out and reorgan
izing his department for the bene
fit of his own nation and fellow
countrymen.
Orderliness, directness, ability
to get at the real heart of a prob
lem and then to act rightly and
effectively characterized Hoover
the student and characterize
Hoover the government executive.
In between, those qualities
marked and colored his career as
engineer, business director, and
head of the greatest humanitarian
project history has ever known,
the Commission for Relief in BeJ
gium.
As Food Administrator he made
one of the most intricate and dif
ficult pieces of work seem almost
easy. As Secretary of Commerce
he has elevated a position which
previously was regarded as neg
ligible to a plane of infinite
significance in its helpful con
tacts with all elements of the
people.

Herbert Hoover comes back to
Stanford the same man who came
here first at the time the Univer
sity opened and who has contin
ued to come back as often as his
duties have permitted. When he
entered Stanford in 1891 he be
came a Stanford man for all time.
Stanford became an integral part
of him and he has made himself
an integral part of Stanford.
As a student he placed the
stamp of his ability and convic
tions on the conduct of student
affairs so indelibly that it has
lasted through all the years. As a
trustee he has continued to help
hold Stanford to its own course
in moving ahead with the chang
ing world.
For years his home and his
heart have been at Stanford, but
his work in the world has kept
him away from here except for
such brief visits as he could
snatch. He has come back here
now only for a brief stay, to leave
once more in a few days for tasks
that await him elsewhere.
As a student Hoover won our
admiration and our pride in be
ing associated with him in enter
prises for the good of the Stan
ford student body. As a leading
American and as an outstanding
figure in promoting world welfare
he has earned the same admira
tion and pride from all who have
worked with him—from the peo
ples of all the world and especially
from the American people.
It is a rare opportunity that we
of Stanford enjoy—to have this
son of Stanford once more on the
campus, this time to receive of
ficially his notification as a candi
date for the greatest position in
the country, particularly since we
think of him as a man who be
longs to us in a personal way and
of whom we have been proud be
cause he has been most consist
ent in his sense of public service
and of human service.
