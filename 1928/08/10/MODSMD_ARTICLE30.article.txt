"Out of the splendid theatrical back
ground of California there is a won
derful opportunity for the writing of
many colorful plays," said Professor
Frederick H. Kqch in his lecture
Wednesday afternoon in the Little
Theatre. "The theatre is ultimately
related to the life of the people and
for that reason the only permanent
art is that which is essentially and
enthusiastically local. True art grows
out of the spirituality of the locality
and the time.
"There is in America today a Dra
matic Renaissance of which we are
a part. The schools and colleges have
a grave responsibility in this move
ment. They can not make genius, but
they can lose genius and talents. It is
the duty of the schools to so cherish
these talents that they may not be
lost. We need in America a serious
theatre by means of which we can be
uplifted and refreshed as well as
amused."
Professor Koch is an experienced
leader in communal play making. For
the past ten years he has been head
of the department of dramatics in the
University of North Carolina. That
one university has given four profes
sional playwrights to the United
States.
