# "QUEEN'S HUSBAND" PRESENTED SECOND TIME HERE TONIGHT
## Elaborate Costumes Will Be Featured Throughout; Davis, Wilbur Play 
### 
The second campus production of
"The Queen's Husband," which is to
be presented tonight, has a more
splendid costuming than before. Hale
,Brothers of San Francisco have again
turned over their gowns to the women
of the cast from which to select their
costumes. Miss Wilbur is to wear the*
type of purple gown made famous by
Queen Marie of Rumania and in the
final act she will be seen in a hand
made crystal gown, the first to be
worn in this country. Corinne Frank
lin will wear one of the newest and
most spectacular bridal dresses seen
this season. *-
If rehearsals can be used as an in
dication, tonight's showing will find
Miss F r anklip, the .Princess, and Dick,-
Stewart, the secretary to the King and"
the lover of the Princess, playing a
different interpretation than wit
nessed before. Miss Franklin gave a>
mechanically perfect portrayal in the
first presentation, but it was played
most unsympathetically. She played
a scintillating part with too much re
serve and this detracted from Stew-*
art's work. Tonight should find her>
playing with the same grace and ease*-
but lacking the restraint and coldness
noticed before; she has furnished her
part to co-ordinate with Stewart. <
Jack Wiggin will remove the pall
cast on the first showing by. Harold ■
Bronson's hyper-affected treatment of
the part of Lord Burton. Wiggin's
voice and ability, coupled with his
stage experience gained from playing
for four years under Gordon Davis'
direction, leads to the prediction that
he will create a skillful interpreta
tion. His entrance into the cast makes
it one comprised totally of seasoned
actors of both the professional and
amateur field.
Gordon Davis, the weary, henpecked
King, browbeaten by a•: belligerent
wife, played by Betty Wilbur, should
again charm the audience. The com
bination of Davis and Miss Wilbur
makes for a successful production.
The scene between them in .the sec
ond act was the outstanding bit of
work in the first production and un
less there has been a decided slump
it will again steal the show.
Helvenston will feature the set
which first introduced him to the
campus. He is to use the subtle light
ing effect produced by the contra
puntal treatment. It is unusual to find
this used on an amateur stage.
