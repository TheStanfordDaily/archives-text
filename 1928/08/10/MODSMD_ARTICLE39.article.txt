# PENINSULAR POINTS

Chinatown in San Francisco in the
most famous Chinese settlement' in
the world outside of China. Grant
street is covered with curio stores,
food markets, clothing stores, and all
of the places which should be in a
modern retail business district. The
only difference between it and any
other business district is that there
are Chinese clerks and proprietors in
the stores, and that the goods handled
are usually pseudo-Chinese. It is now
a prosaic, matter-of-fact Chinatown.
The Chinatown before the earthquake,
however, was an entirely different
place. Hop joints, white slave leagues,
toug wars, and all the institutions of
a real, romantic, dangerous China
town used to be there. More happened
below the ground than above and
daggers were used for other purposes
than window displays. The China
town of "Old San Francisco" was a
real place, a place of adventure, but
it has degenerated into a show place,
a sad imitation of its former self.
' The Palace Court is a magnificent
room. Tall, marble pillars and spark
ling chandeliers make it distant and
Rtately, tremendously aloof. It is one
of the few hotel dining rooms on the
Pacific Coast which is not the same
as every other one. And added to
this, excellent food is served, which
also distinguishes it from most hotel
dining rooms. This column is not a
liaid-for advertisement, so when the
writer suggests that anyone who
lunches in this room should order a
Palace Court salad, the reader may
be the writer speaks from
experience and not for a free meal.
The Agnew Sanitarium, located
about seven miles northeast of San
Jose, is an immensely interesting
place, for it is a fine example of a
self-supporting institution. The latest
figures show that approximately two
thousand mentally subnormal people
are cared for in this home. The au
thorities try to take few violent
cases, for, when possible, the inmates
are taught some simple trade. Thus
the bread used by the institution is
all made within, as are many other
necessities. In addition to being self
supporting, Agnew is noted as being a
pioneer in the use of the water cure.
This is the latest method of treating
mental disturbances, ai\d experiments
have proved it to be very efficacious.
No one can claim to have exhausted
all of San Francisco's points of inter
est without having eaten a shrimp
cocktail at Fisherman's Wharf. Here
the largest and juiciest shrimps in the
world are served in tremendous cock
tailes for the meager sum of fifteen
cents. Most of the fishermen in the
bay region land at this wharf, which
is located at the foot of Jones street,
and from this central market they dis
tribute their goods all over the city.
