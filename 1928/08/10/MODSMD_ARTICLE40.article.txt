# Hoover Highlights from Will Irwin's Biography
## 
### 
Will Irwin, intimate friend of Her
bert Hoover since their college days,
has given many interesting stories
about Hoover in his recent biography.
Following are a few of the highlights
on Hoover's life from the time he en
tered college until the present day:
"He was tall —just under six feet —
broad-shouldered, very lean of figure.
He wore one of those double-breasted
blue suits which have since become
almost a uniform with him. He had a
slight stoop which, you felt, came
rather from excess muscular develop
ment of the shoulders rather than
from midnight oil. He carried his
head a trifle to one side He
had mouse-colored hair, as stubbornly
straight as an Indian's .... his round
but powerful face had not a straight
line in it. He stood with one foot
thrust forward, jingling the keys in
his trousers pocket; a little nervous
trick which he has never overcome."
"His first creation in organization
. ... all student activities should lie
under control of the student body;
and the active manager should be a
bonded and double-audited student
body treasurer .... that was the es
sence of a constitution which, with
minor modifications, still governs the
student activities of Stanford and
which many another Western univer
sity has copied."
"One afternoon .... the Chinese
army suddenly went Boxer. Hoover
and his staff were the only engineers
in town, and to them fell the immedi
ate and pressing task of throwing up
barricades, transforming the village
(foreign settlement of Tientsin) into
a fortress."
"His journeys covered the world
from the equator to the arctic: but
always the home port was San Fran
cisco. His way of life in this period
has given rise to the peristent reports
that he was out of the country for j
twenty years. Even were that true, I
his career should be a matter of na- !
tional pride. Wherever he worked he
planted a nucleus of American meth- |
ods, created a demand for American
goods. But as a matter of cold fact
and record, he spent only one of these
years—l9o7—wholly out of the United
States By 1909, they were
spending more and more time at their j
base in California. And by 1912 they
tvere living in Palo Alto, San Fran- j

Cisco, or New York the better part
of each year."
"Finally, during those far-flung pro
ductive years Hoover's job impinged
always on statesmanship. He must
deal in Russia with the heart-breaking
czarist system, in China with 'spheres
of influence,' in Africa and the islands
of the Indian Sea with the imperial
ambitious, in Central America with
revolutionary parties. He had re
tained that interest in affairs stirred
up by the 'great frat-barb war" of his
Stanford days. Though as yet in no
wise a participant, he kept close and
interested touch with our domestic
politics: Washington was one of his
ports of call. And this gave the finish
to his unconscious apprenticeship for
a larger career. When suddenly life
thrust on him a world-wide responsi
bility, he was no stranger to chan
celleries and embassies, premiers and
foreign ministers. Still better, he un
derstood the economic resources, the
industrial methods, the business and
financial organizations of the twenty
nations or dependencies in which he
had operated. Among our formally ap
pointed diplomatic representatives
some naturally knew one or two for
eign countries better than he. But
none had such intimate acquaintance
with so many countries. He saw
them all the more profitably because
he remained Yankee of the Yankees —
as American as baseball or apple pie
—regarding them from the detached
view of the outsider who nevertheless
sits in on the game."
"Up to that time, the world had
never seen so great an operation in
public relief. When they grew larger,
Hoover led them. It was the first of
those food administrations which, be
fore the somewhat hazy sun of peace
rose, enveloped civilization. And the
Commission for Relief in Belgium
wrought a revolution in the adminis
tration of public benevolence. Hither
to, such operations had been hurried,
confused, wasteful —conceived and ad
ministered in the spirit of emergency
charity. This, from its first day, was
managed with the shrewdness, econ
omy, foresight, and judgment which
a well-organized corporation expects
of its executives. One line in the final
reports of its auditors tells the story."

planted a nucleus of American meth- |

ambitious, in Central America with
revolutionary parties. He had re
tained that interest in affairs stirred
up by the 'great frat-barb war" of his
Stanford days. Though as yet in no
wise a participant, he kept close and
interested touch with our domestic
politics: Washington was one of his
ports of call. And this gave the finish
to his unconscious apprenticeship for
a larger career. When suddenly life
thrust on him a world-wide responsi
bility, he was no stranger to chan
celleries and embassies, premiers and
foreign ministers. Still better, he un
derstood the economic resources, the
industrial methods, the business and
financial organizations of the twenty
nations or dependencies in which he
had operated. Among our formally ap
pointed diplomatic representatives
some naturally knew one or two for
eign countries better than he. But
none had such intimate acquaintance
with so many countries. He saw
them all the more profitably because
he remained Yankee of the Yankees —
as American as baseball or apple pie
—regarding them from the detached
view of the outsider who nevertheless
sits in on the game."
"Up to that time, the world had
never seen so great an operation in
public relief. When they grew larger,
Hoover led them. It was the first of
those food administrations which, be
fore the somewhat hazy sun of peace

Commission for Relief in Belgium
wrought a revolution in the adminis
tration of public benevolence. Hither
to, such operations had been hurried,
confused, wasteful —conceived and ad
ministered in the spirit of emergency
charity. This, from its first day, was
managed with the shrewdness, econ
omy, foresight, and judgment which
a well-organized corporation expects
of its executives. One line in the final
reports of its auditors tells the story."
Will Irwin, intimate friend of Her
bert Hoover since their college days,
has given many interesting stories
about Hoover in his recent biography.
Following are a few of the highlights
on Hoover's life from the time he en
tered college until the present day:
"He was tall —just under six feet —
broad-shouldered, very lean of figure.
He wore one of those double-breasted
blue suits which have since become
almost a uniform with him. He had a
slight stoop which, you felt, came
rather from excess muscular develop
ment of the shoulders rather than
from midnight oil. He carried his
head a trifle to one side He
had mouse-colored hair, as stubbornly
straight as an Indian's .... his round
but powerful face had not a straight
line in it. He stood with one foot
thrust forward, jingling the keys in
his trousers pocket; a little nervous
trick which he has never overcome."

Will Irwin, intimate friend of Her
bert Hoover since their college days,
has given many interesting stories
about Hoover in his recent biography.
Following are a few of the highlights
on Hoover's life from the time he en
tered college until the present day:
"He was tall —just under six feet —
broad-shouldered, very lean of figure.
He wore one of those double-breasted
blue suits which have since become
almost a uniform with him. He had a
slight stoop which, you felt, came
rather from excess muscular develop
ment of the shoulders rather than
from midnight oil. He carried his
head a trifle to one side He
had mouse-colored hair, as stubbornly
straight as an Indian's .... his round
but powerful face had not a straight
line in it. He stood with one foot
thrust forward, jingling the keys in
his trousers pocket; a little nervous
trick which he has never overcome."
"His first creation in organization
. ... all student activities should lie
under control of the student body;
and the active manager should be a
bonded and double-audited student
body treasurer .... that was the es
sence of a constitution which, with
minor modifications, still governs the
student activities of Stanford and
which many another Western univer
sity has copied."
"One afternoon .... the Chinese
army suddenly went Boxer. Hoover
and his staff were the only engineers
in town, and to them fell the immedi
ate and pressing task of throwing up
barricades, transforming the village
(foreign settlement of Tientsin) into
a fortress."
"His journeys covered the world
from the equator to the arctic: but
always the home port was San Fran
cisco. His way of life in this period
has given rise to the peristent reports
that he was out of the country for j
twenty years. Even were that true, I
his career should be a matter of na- !
tional pride. Wherever he worked he
planted a nucleus of American meth- |
ods, created a demand for American
goods. But as a matter of cold fact
and record, he spent only one of these
years—l9o7—wholly out of the United
States By 1909, they were
spending more and more time at their j
base in California. And by 1912 they
tvere living in Palo Alto, San Fran- j

Cisco, or New York the better part
of each year."
