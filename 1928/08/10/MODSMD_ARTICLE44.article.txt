# FAITH AND ADMIRATION OF CHINESE WERE WON BY HOOVER IN ORIENT
## 
### 
According to an article published
in the Shanghai Weekly some months
ago and later reprinted in the Con
gressional Record, Herbert Hoover's
career in China was one of marked
success. During his stay in China
for many years he engaged himself
in professional work in mine, railway,
and metallurgical work. In 1899 he
was chief engineer of the Chinese Im
perial Bureau of Mines and did very
extensive exploration in the interior
of China. In 1900 he was representa
tive of bondholders in the construc
tion of the Chinwantoo Harbor, and
in 1901 he became general manager
of the Chinese Engineering and Min
ing Company.
Hoover and bis wife went to China
prior to the Boxer uprising, and ac
cording to report widely published, he
was employed by the Chinese to con
duct a mining survey of Sliansi,
Shensi, and the Manchuria Provinces.
He was 25 years old at that time.
Soon after his arrival in North China
the Boxer trouble developed, and he
and Mrs. Hoover were bottled up in
Tientsin, and assisted in the defense
of that city against the Boxer forces.
The work of Hoover in China won
for him the faith and admiration of
the Chinese people. This may be best
illustrated in the following incident.
Shortly after the Boxer disturbances,
there was a general rumor of foreign
intervention on the coal beds at
Chinwantoo, more popularly known
as the Kaiping mines. There was a
strong chance of its being seized by
Russia or Japan at the time. In order
to prevent the possibility of that, the
Chinese officials transferred the
mines to Hoover's name, thus making
them technically American property.
