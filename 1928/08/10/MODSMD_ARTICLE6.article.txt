# Wife Of Nominee Wins Recognition By Own Abilities
## Winner of First Metallurgical Degree Ever Awarded To Stanford Woman 
### 
In the words of Will Irwin, Mrs.
Herbert Hoover "what with her
brains, her personality, and her large
understanding, is as much a person
as her husband."
She has achieved recognition on
her own merit, being Chairman of the
Board of Directors of the National
Girl Scouts, and member of the
American Association for the Ad
vancement of Science, the National
Geographic Society, the Royal Scot
tish. Geographical Society, and other
societies.
But let us think of her first not as
Mrs. Herbert Clark Hoover, wife of
the Republican nominee for President
of the United States, not as the lead
ing spirit in the Girl Scout movement,
and not as the gracious Washington
hostess, but as Lou Henry, student,
who won the first metallurgical degree
ever awarded to a woman at Stan
ford.
Hears Branner
During her senior year in high
school at Monterey, where her fam
ily had settled, a geology professor
from Stanford, Dr. Caspar Branner,
gave a lecture entitled "The Bones of
the Earth" as part of a series of uni
versity extension lectures. She at
tended aiul what he said fired her
imagination, for she already knew
something of those bones from tramps
about the country. Slie decided she
would go to Stanford, study under
Branner, and become a geologist her
self.
She registered at Stanford in 1894.
where she soon heard of Hoover, the
brilliant student who was the pride
of all his professors. Then one day,
according to Will Irwin's biography,
Dr. Branner was discussing with her
| some new specimens. "Hoover brought
I them in from the field," he said.
( "They've been called carboniferous,
j but I'll eat my hat if they aren't pre
] carboniferous. Isn't that your opinion,
Hoover?" Miss Henry looked up. Be
' side Branner stood a lean, immature
looking boy. Was this the great
j Hoover?"
Tbe young geologist examined the
rock and after giving his judgment
fell into conversation with Lou Henry
about the carboniferous period. The
next Friday night he put on his best
suit and called at Roble Hall. Their
acquaintance went steadily and se
renely toward its destined end.
Is Popular in College
According to Mrs. T. A. Storey, who
was a classmate and friend of Mrs.
Hoover during their four years at
Stanford, Lou Henry was an animated,
popular girl with many friends and
an instinct for sociability that has
feinained with her since school days.
Though sports were not so common
for women in those days, Lou rode
horseback and played basketball.
She belonged to the Kappa Kappa
Gamma sorority, which was housed at
Roble at that time.
The Hoover romance has been de
scribed by Charlotte Kellogg as "one
of the best arguments for co-education
I know." After Hoover had acquired
fame and fortune as a mining engi
neer in Australia and was assured of
his future he cabled his proposal to
Lou Henry. The answer went back "at
a speed which broke all records for
communication with our west coast."
Hoover returned to California and
they were married at a quiet cere
mony at the Henry home in Monterey,
sailing the same day for the Orient.
She now took up an existence that
was to lead her to some of the re
-1 motest parts on earth. She has trav
elled with her husband all over the
world, making a home for him in Man
dalay, Russia, Japan, and China. She
was barricaded in a house shared with
other Americans at Tientsin during
the Boxer rebellion where she served
tea daily during the siege, getting
sweetening from the sugar bags that
! formed the rampart before the build
ing.
Active for Welfare of Others
In 1914, when Hoover was asked
to undertake the feeding cf the Bel
gians, there was no doubt in Mrs.
Hoover's mind as to what he should
do. She not only urged him to accept
the work, but organized women's com
mittees that were an invaluable asset
in unifying the efforts of American
! women in the relief work.
When Hoover was appointed Food
i Administrator and they took up their

residence in Washington, a situation
came to Mrs. Hoover's attention
which she realized needed correction.
The city was crowded because of the
many war workers there, and hun
dreds of girls employed in the Food
Administration were living in
crannied, uncomfortable quarters. So
she rented a large house and con
verted it into a home-like club where
the girls of her husband's department
could obtain rooms at a minimum
rent.
Always anxious for the comfort of
others, Mrs. Hoover a few years ago
built a group of bungalows on the
Stanford campus which were designed
for people who wanted their own
homes without having to rent the
houses the campus then affoffrded â€”
large buildings demanding large
rents.
After the war she turned her ener
gies to another line of endeavor, that
of Girl Scout work. She writes all the
working material for their manuals,
plans their programs, and participates
in their camp life. This September
she is to be the leader of the National
Training Camp for Scout leaders to
be held for ten days in Ested Park,
Colorado. She is the First Vice-Presi
dent of the Scouts and Chairman of
the Board of Directors, having for
merly been the national president.
Is Charming Hostess
In spite of her activities Mrs.
Hoover is never, if she can help it,
in the limelight. She dislikes pub
licity as much as her husband does,
and accomplishes things in the same
quiet, unobtrusive way that is char
acteristic of Hoover. In spite of her
instinctive sociability she doesn't par
ticularly care for society in the for
mal sense of the word, and is seen at
social affairs perhaps less than any
other woman in Washington official
circles. But she has a host of friends
and keeps open house for them in
Washington where she entertains
them with a delightful spontaneity
and apparent lack of effort that is
marvelled at.
