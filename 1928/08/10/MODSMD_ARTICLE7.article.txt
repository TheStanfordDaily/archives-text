## 
### 
Representative Tilson, Republican
leader of the House, who has recently
been visiting Hoover to confer with
him on the coming campaign, has ex
pressed his opinion and appreciation
of Hoover and his candidacy in the
following special letter to the Daily.
Mr. Tilson has gone East and so will
not be able to be»present at the notifi
cation. His letter follows:
I gladly join with the Stanford
Daily in extending to the most dis
tinguished alumnus of Stanford Uni
versity my sincere congratulations
upon bis nomination as the Repub
lican candidate for the Presidency of
the United States.
Stanford does well to congratulate
and honor Herbert Hoover, for by his
notable achievements in many fields
of activity in many lands he has
brought honor and renown to his alma
mater. He has done more. In innumer
able ways he has contributed directly
and indirectly to the material welfare
and greater achievements of the Uni
versity.
I shall mention but one instance,
and this is the Hoover War Library,
a contribution to Stanford and to the
world, unusual in character and
unique in its completeness which will
ever remain as a monument to his
farsightedness, initiative, and practi
cal wisdom in carrying out a great
undertaking. This invaluable collec
tion if preserved will continue through
the centuries as the richest mine in
all the world for the future historian
who would seek from the original
sources the truth as it relates to the
great world war and make it avail
able for the use of succeeding genera
tions.
This work alone would rank as a
notable achievement deserving world
wide recognition, but for Herbert
Hoover it. was only an incident of bis
life at a time when he was feeding
the starving millions of suffering
countries and bearing such other bur
dens of responsibility as would have
i crushed most men. —John Q. Tilson.
