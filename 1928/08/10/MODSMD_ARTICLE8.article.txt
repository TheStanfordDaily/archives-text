mo MORROW afternoon in the Stanford Stadium Herbert Hoover will receive
formal notification of his nomination for presidency of the United States,

Senator George H. Moses of New Hampshire, chairman of the notification

Gates of the stadium will be opened

Ticket-holders are advised to come

be plenty of room for all, and that

Band, and will be assisted by bands
