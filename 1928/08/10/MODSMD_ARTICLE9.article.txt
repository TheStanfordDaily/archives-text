# Student Acquaintances Of Hoover Relate His Early Work On Campus
## Presidential Nominee Early Showed Traits Which Mark Him Today 
### 
That Herbert Hoover during his
student days showed the characteris
tics which in later years have brought
him to his present distinguished posi
tion, is clearly illustrated in the fol
lowing reminiscences of persons who
knew him as a student.
Professor Henry Davidson Sheldon,
acting professor of education during
the Summer Quarter, and a student j
at Stanford with Herbert Hoover, re- j
called the time when Hoover was
running for treasurer of the student !
body. Hoover won the election on the
platform that he represented the com
mon, ordinary student, rather than the
aristocrat.
"As treasurer," said Professor
Sheldon, "Hoover worked out an ef
ficient financial system, which en
abled the student body to rid itself
of debt and to stand on its own feet.
Before Hoover took charge, the vari
ous athletic teams and the Glee Club
had been fast losing money, but he
put them on a paying basis in a short
time."
Professor Jenkins, of the Physiology
department, remembered Herbert
Hoover as a student. "I knew both
Herbert Hoover and his wife very

as a student. "He was one of the best- j
known students here, not only very j
serious and earnest, but very busy.
He was a leader, and was regarded
as a man who had little time for
frivolities. His ability always recog

izer, and a young man who could be ,
depended upon to finish what he be- i
gan." I
"He was a practical man and his j
success in engineering, as a business
man, as a man of judgment of affairs, ,
and as a great administrator, were
simply the development, as the years
went on, of qualities which everyone j
recognized."
Charles David Marx. Professor
Emeritus of Civil Engineering at;
Stanford, tells a story of Hoover !
which he obtained from Mrs. Branner.
Mrs. Branner had gone to the office
of her husband, Dr. Branner, one day,
and there noticed a boy quietly at
work. When he went out, Dr. Branner
said of himi "I told this boy to pack
some books to send out. He didn't ask
me where to find a box and some
nails, and a hammer, but just went
