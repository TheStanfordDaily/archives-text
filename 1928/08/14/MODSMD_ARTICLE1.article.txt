Beginning: on Thursday morning,
delegates of the Chinese Students' Al
liance Convention, an organization
composed of college students from
the western section of America, will
come to the Stanford campus for its
twenty-sixth annual meet. They will
be guests here for a period of four
days during which time they will at
tend the program specially arranged
for them by the Alliance Executive
Board and the Stanford Chinese Stu
dents' Club.
The program includes a diversity
of activities such as debating, ora
tory, and essay contests, both in Chi
nese and in English. Discussion will
also take an important part, and spe
cial emphasis will be laid on two spe
cific problems, namely, "The Unifica
tion of China" and "Our Relations
with Japan." These two topics are
oustandingly significant in that for
the first time in her perplexing his
tory China is now substantially uni
fied under a central government al
ready recognized by the United States
and the League of Nations; and
China's relations with Japan are
growing more tense since the recent
occurrence in Shantung.
"In short," said the chairman of
the coming convention, "we are en
deavoring in this conference to pro
vide ample opportunity to study care
fully all the problems confronting our
country, to propagate helpful informa- i
lion, to discover openings, to permit J
expression in the fields interested,
and to form contacts through friend
ship."
Athletic events such as tennis, bas
ketball, and track, both for men and
women delegates, will contribute to
the program of the day, while social
activities will occupy the evenings.
The first evening program will be a
grand reception of the delegates, after
which there will be a stunt contest
between groups represented by dif
ferent universities. The second eve
ning will be devoted to the University
play, "Right You Are, If You Think
You Are," the third evening to the
Conference informal in Branner Hall,
and the fourth to the farewell banquet
in San Francisco.
About a hundred or more delegates
will be expected to come. Men dele
gates will be housed in Branner Hall,
and the women delegates in Roble
