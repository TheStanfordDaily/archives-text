# Gabrilowitsch Ends Concerts With Program Of Russian Selections
## 
### 
' Ossip Gabrilowitsch charmed a '
capacity audience at the final summer
I symphony concert at the Hillsborough ;
Theatre last Sunday. Each number on
the program consisting of Russian
compositions vied with the others to
1 be considered the supreme musical
I moment of the concert.
i None, of course, could surpass
I Tschaikowsky's "Concerto for Piano
! forte." It. was in this piece that Dr.
j Gabrilowitsch turned over his baton
: to Mishel Piastro, and showed his
I talent as a solo pianist.
I Gliere's symphonic .poem, "The
j Sirens," is the type of "program
[music" that is always appreciated by j
layman and music enthusiast. One had

'no difficulty in following the musical
interpretation of the well-known
j Greek myth. The composer's divisions
presented an individual picture, yet
there was a running continuity.
For those who revel in music with
| a distinctly modern spirit, the "Over
ture to 'Russian and Ludmilla'" by
Michael Glinka was more than satisfy
ing, as was the masterful interpreta
tion of Stravinsky's exotic "Suite from
the Ballet, 'The Fire Bird'."
The insistent applause of the audi
ence and its reluctance to leave as
sures a return engagement on next
year's summer series, of Detroit's dis
tinguished musician, Ossip Gabrilo
witsch.
