# SECOND PERFORMANCE OF 'QUEEN'S HUSBAND' PROVES SEASON'S HIT
## Gordon Davis, Betty Wilbur Again Star in Sherwood's Satirical Comedy 
### Laird Doyle 
j Friday's production of "The Queen's
Husband" confirmed the praise Riven
; it after the first presentation. Robert
Sherwood's satirical comedy was
| given a treatment, under Gordon
j Davis' direction, which squeezed out
| every bit of artistry which formulated
i the play. It is seldom that an amateur
play contains the consistency, definite
j characterizations, and rapid action
| which were so obvious in "The
! Queen's Husband."
Wilbur, Davis Star
Betty Wilbur and Gordon Davis
stole the show. The combination was
a perfect one, for each served as a
background of contrast to the .other;
neither shadowed the other. Miss Wli
bur, cast in the role of a woman
whose life is a constant recalcitration
to the attitude of her husband, did
an unusual piece of work, but her real
power was grasped by the audience
in her scene with Davis where the
discussion of their marriage took
place. In this scene she did a splendid
piece of surface acting combined with
a truly deep connotation.
Davis played his part to perfection.
He found the median between pathos
and comedy; yet he did not give the
trite interpretation comparable to
"the clown who hid a broken heart
beneath a painted smile." His ges
tures were executed with a grace
which were pleasing. Perhaps his un
derstanding of the play, added to his
ability, may account for the hit that
he scored in this show.
Fisher Gives Unusual Interpretation
Dick Fisher did an unusual inter
pretation. He played his part with in
tensity and embellished his portayal
with definite reactions. There was no
portion of his work which would not
suffer from deduction. Fisher has a
fine stage voice which lent well to
his character.
Jack Wiggin played his part with
ease. His work was smooth and all
his action blended into the mass im
pression without seemingly conscious
effort on his part.
Irving Rosenblatt played the scur
rilous Prince in an amusing manner.
His accent was typical of nowhere,
but it was an odd creation.
Corrinne Franklin and Dick Stewart
improved upon their work and much
of the lack of warmth noticed in the
first presentation was gone. Mrs.
Franklin still played her part in a
too mature manner, but she did suc
ceed in penetrating the audience with
her emotions. Stewart made an inter
esting lover.
The offstage business was very ef
fective and handled without a single
noticeable cue error. The set —the
same used in the first production —
was a finished and artistic creation.
The balance of the set was simple
yet complex in its structure. This pro
duction will t place another feather in
the cap of Helvenston.
