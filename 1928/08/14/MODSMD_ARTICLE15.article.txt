## Candidate Outlines Party Platform at Address In Stanford Bowl Spirit Rivaling Big Game Displayed; Radio Makes World Broadcast 
### 
Addressing: approximately 70,000
'people in the stadium and counties.*
1 more who heard him over the radio,
j Herbert Hoover last Saturday ac
;cepted his nomination as Republican
presidential candidate and outlined
his party's platform in a speech which
has been characterized as "a modern
political, moral, and spiritual magna
charta."
Hoover's acceptance followed im
mediately the formal notification de
livered by Senator George H. Moses
'of New Hahpshire, chairman of the
[notification committee, whose address
|in turn followed Governor Young's
I address of welcome and introduction
jOf Senator Moses. Crowds had com
| menced to enter the stadium at noon.
| coming from all over the state. The
| music and marching of four bands
[ and daytime fireworks entertained the
j spectators until the ceremonies at the
! flag-draped platform at the south end
ot the bowl commenced. As the vari
: ous notables entered the stadium they
i were announced. President Wilbur
j and Dr. Jordan receiving especially
| enthusiastic applause. The speeches
I were amplified so as to be clearly
j audible to the entire stadium.
Speaking of the forthcoming cam
paign, Hoover said: "It shall be an
I honest campaign; every penny will
jbe publicly accounted for. We shall
| use words to convey our meaning, not
j to hide it."
Outlines Farm Relief
"The working out of agricultural
I relief constitutes the most important
obligation of the next administration,"
j he said, and went on to outline a pro
gram embracing tariff protection and
| increased and cheaper transportation,
| chiefly by an extension of our water
| way system. "These improevements
! would mean so large an increment in
i farmers' prices as to warrant their
construction many times over,"
Hoover declared. The platform, he
| said, also pledges the creation of a
Federal Farm Board of representa
! tive farmers to be clothed with au
j thority to assist generally in solution
J of farm problems.
"In my mind most agricultural dis
cussions go wrong because of two
false premises. The first is that agri
culture is one industry. It is a dozen
distinct industries incapable of the
same organization. The second false
j premise is that rehabilitation will be
complete when it has reached a point
comparable with pre-war. Agriculture
was not upon a satisfactory basis be
fore the war."
Declares Stand on Prohibition
Hoover reiterated his views on pro
ihibition. "I do not favor the repeal
of the 18th Amendment. I stand for
the efficient enforcement of the laws
enacted thereunder. Whoever is cho
sen President has under his oath the
solemn duty to pursue this course.
"Change in the Constitution can and
must be brought about only by the
straightforward methods provided in
the Constitution itself," asserted
Hoover. "Modification of the enforce
ment laws which would permit that
which the Constitution forbids is nul
lification." He went on to say that no
one denies those who do not believe
in several provisions of the Constitu
tion the right to seek to amend it.
"They are not subject to criticism for
asserting that right."
Strikes Note of Idealism
"By blood and conviction I stand
for religious tolerance both in act
and in spirit. The glory of our Ameri
can ideals is the right of every man
to worship God according to the dic
tates of his own conscience."
"For many years I have been asso
ciated with efforts to save life and
health for our children." Declaring
that the greatness of any nation is
the direct quotient of the care of its
children Hoover said that every child
in America should have full opportun
ity for education, should be free from
injurious labor, and should have every
stimulation to accomplish the fullest
of its capacities. "I especially value
the contribution that the youth of the
| country can make to the success of
1 our American experiment in demo
i cracy. Theirs is the precious gift of
i enthusiasm."
Hoover emphasized the idea that
economic advancement is not an end
in itself, and that although a political
: platform necessarily deals with eco
■ nomic problems America is a nation
of homes, men, women, and children.
Every man and woman has a right to
j ask whether their happiness will be

better assured by the continuance of
the Republican Party in power, de
clared Hoover, and he proceeded to
trace the tremendous advance in pros
perity during the last eight years.
"No party ever accepted a more diffi
cult task of reconstruction than did
the Republican Party in 1921. The
record of these seven and one-half
years constitutes a period of rare
leadership and constructive actiou.
Never has a political party been able
to look back upon a similar period
with more satisfaction."
Commenting on the speech, T. T. C.
Gregory, San Francisco attorney and
Stanford trustee, said: "I think
Hoover put a real human soul into
the Republican platform. He has
struck the finest and highest social
chord that has been sounded in the
country in a generation." Clay Miller
of Palo Alto said that Hoover's ad
dress inspired confidence in the Na
tion's welfare under his administra
tion. "Especially as he has clear un
derstanding of the problems of agri
culture and he more than any other
man has the capacity to solve them."
The speech has brought forth tele
grams from ever ysectiou of the coun
try.

Outlines Farm Relief
"The working out of agricultural
I relief constitutes the most important
obligation of the next administration,"
j he said, and went on to outline a pro
gram embracing tariff protection and
| increased and cheaper transportation,
| chiefly by an extension of our water
| way system. "These improevements
! would mean so large an increment in
i farmers' prices as to warrant their
construction many times over,"
Hoover declared. The platform, he

Federal Farm Board of representa

j thority to assist generally in solution
J of farm problems.
"In my mind most agricultural dis
cussions go wrong because of two
false premises. The first is that agri
culture is one industry. It is a dozen
distinct industries incapable of the
same organization. The second false
j premise is that rehabilitation will be
complete when it has reached a point
comparable with pre-war. Agriculture
was not upon a satisfactory basis be
fore the war."
Declares Stand on Prohibition
Hoover reiterated his views on pro
ihibition. "I do not favor the repeal
of the 18th Amendment. I stand for
the efficient enforcement of the laws
enacted thereunder. Whoever is cho
sen President has under his oath the
solemn duty to pursue this course.
"Change in the Constitution can and
must be brought about only by the
straightforward methods provided in
the Constitution itself," asserted
Hoover. "Modification of the enforce
ment laws which would permit that
which the Constitution forbids is nul
lification." He went on to say that no
one denies those who do not believe
in several provisions of the Constitu
tion the right to seek to amend it.
"They are not subject to criticism for
asserting that right."
Strikes Note of Idealism
"By blood and conviction I stand
for religious tolerance both in act
and in spirit. The glory of our Ameri
can ideals is the right of every man
to worship God according to the dic
tates of his own conscience."
"For many years I have been asso
ciated with efforts to save life and
health for our children." Declaring
that the greatness of any nation is
the direct quotient of the care of its
children Hoover said that every child
in America should have full opportun
ity for education, should be free from
injurious labor, and should have every
stimulation to accomplish the fullest
of its capacities. "I especially value
the contribution that the youth of the
| country can make to the success of
1 our American experiment in demo
i cracy. Theirs is the precious gift of
i enthusiasm."
Hoover emphasized the idea that
economic advancement is not an end
in itself, and that although a political
: platform necessarily deals with eco
■ nomic problems America is a nation
of homes, men, women, and children.
Every man and woman has a right to
j ask whether their happiness will be

better assured by the continuance of
the Republican Party in power, de
clared Hoover, and he proceeded to
trace the tremendous advance in pros
perity during the last eight years.
"No party ever accepted a more diffi
cult task of reconstruction than did
the Republican Party in 1921. The
record of these seven and one-half
years constitutes a period of rare
leadership and constructive actiou.
Never has a political party been able
to look back upon a similar period
with more satisfaction."
Commenting on the speech, T. T. C.
Gregory, San Francisco attorney and
Stanford trustee, said: "I think
Hoover put a real human soul into
the Republican platform. He has
struck the finest and highest social
chord that has been sounded in the
country in a generation." Clay Miller
of Palo Alto said that Hoover's ad

j Herbert Hoover last Saturday ac
;cepted his nomination as Republican
presidential candidate and outlined
his party's platform in a speech which
has been characterized as "a modern
political, moral, and spiritual magna
charta."
Hoover's acceptance followed im

ot the bowl commenced. As the vari
: ous notables entered the stadium they
i were announced. President Wilbur
j and Dr. Jordan receiving especially
| enthusiastic applause. The speeches
I were amplified so as to be clearly
j audible to the entire stadium.
Speaking of the forthcoming cam
paign, Hoover said: "It shall be an
I honest campaign; every penny will
jbe publicly accounted for. We shall
| use words to convey our meaning, not
j to hide it."
Outlines Farm Relief
"The working out of agricultural
I relief constitutes the most important
obligation of the next administration,"
j he said, and went on to outline a pro
gram embracing tariff protection and
| increased and cheaper transportation,
| chiefly by an extension of our water
| way system. "These improevements
! would mean so large an increment in
i farmers' prices as to warrant their
construction many times over,"
Hoover declared. The platform, he
| said, also pledges the creation of a
Federal Farm Board of representa
! tive farmers to be clothed with au
j thority to assist generally in solution
J of farm problems.
"In my mind most agricultural dis
cussions go wrong because of two
false premises. The first is that agri
culture is one industry. It is a dozen
distinct industries incapable of the
same organization. The second false
j premise is that rehabilitation will be
complete when it has reached a point
comparable with pre-war. Agriculture
was not upon a satisfactory basis be
fore the war."
Declares Stand on Prohibition
Hoover reiterated his views on pro
ihibition. "I do not favor the repeal
of the 18th Amendment. I stand for
the efficient enforcement of the laws
enacted thereunder. Whoever is cho
sen President has under his oath the
solemn duty to pursue this course.
"Change in the Constitution can and
must be brought about only by the
straightforward methods provided in
the Constitution itself," asserted
Hoover. "Modification of the enforce
ment laws which would permit that
which the Constitution forbids is nul
lification." He went on to say that no
one denies those who do not believe
in several provisions of the Constitu
tion the right to seek to amend it.
"They are not subject to criticism for
asserting that right."
Strikes Note of Idealism
"By blood and conviction I stand
for religious tolerance both in act
and in spirit. The glory of our Ameri
can ideals is the right of every man
to worship God according to the dic
tates of his own conscience."
"For many years I have been asso
ciated with efforts to save life and
health for our children." Declaring
that the greatness of any nation is
the direct quotient of the care of its
children Hoover said that every child
in America should have full opportun
ity for education, should be free from
injurious labor, and should have every
stimulation to accomplish the fullest
of its capacities. "I especially value
the contribution that the youth of the
| country can make to the success of
1 our American experiment in demo
i cracy. Theirs is the precious gift of
i enthusiasm."
Hoover emphasized the idea that
economic advancement is not an end
in itself, and that although a political
: platform necessarily deals with eco
■ nomic problems America is a nation
of homes, men, women, and children.
Every man and woman has a right to
j ask whether their happiness will be

better assured by the continuance of
the Republican Party in power, de
clared Hoover, and he proceeded to
trace the tremendous advance in pros
perity during the last eight years.
"No party ever accepted a more diffi
cult task of reconstruction than did
the Republican Party in 1921. The
record of these seven and one-half
years constitutes a period of rare
leadership and constructive actiou.
Never has a political party been able
to look back upon a similar period
with more satisfaction."
Commenting on the speech, T. T. C.
Gregory, San Francisco attorney and
Stanford trustee, said: "I think
Hoover put a real human soul into
the Republican platform. He has
struck the finest and highest social
chord that has been sounded in the
country in a generation." Clay Miller
of Palo Alto said that Hoover's ad
dress inspired confidence in the Na
tion's welfare under his administra
tion. "Especially as he has clear un
derstanding of the problems of agri
culture and he more than any other
