# Let ’Em Alone

Historians and biographers seem t« get great pleasure in destroying
our illusions of famous men in American history. The latest one to do
so claims that poor old Patrick Henry didn't say the famous phrase that
made him so easy to remember when we were learning our history
lessons in grammar school. Some give poor old George Washington an
awful raking over the coals. Not content with denying that he cut down
the cherry tree and threw a silver dollar across the Potomac, they have
dug up a lot of other things which would lead one to believe that they
don't think George was a very nice man to be Father of the United
States.
They seem to base their right to trot out the family skeleton on the
argument that the youth of America should be told the truth. Fair
enough, but why not tell them the whole truth ? We certainly don't insist
that they tell falsehoods to cover up the peccadillos of our famous fore
fathers, but we do not believe that they should overplay them.
The historians and biographers are just as bad as the people that they
are criticizing. Instead of giving both sides of the argument they give
only their side. Instead of giving a fair picture of the man. they give
one which is just as distorted as the one they are trying to correct.
We have enough faith in our famous leaders to feel that any small
errors which they made would not destroy our faith in them, providing
these errors were presented in their proper light as compared with the
more important things they did. In fact we are glad to know that they
are human beings just like ourselves.
; But it isn't right for men purposely to tear down the idea that has
be£n built up about these men by belittling their good qualities. We
believe that it is a good thing for children whose minds are in the forma
tive stage to have a fair idea of these men; but in our opinion this should
not include an exaggerated account of certain things such as drinking. At
ihat time there was nothing particularly wrong with drinking, but now
it is regarded in a different light.
So why won't they spend their time attacking the many things that
are really wrong in this world, if they feel they simply must criticize, and
let us retain a few of our good thoughts about our grand old men in
history? At least it Would save people from reading editorials like this.
