Thursday morning the Western Section of the Chinese Students
Alliance will hold the first meeting of its 1928 session here. Chinese stu
dents from twelve of the Western states will gather to discuss "The
Political Problems of Present-day China."
This meeting comes at a most appropriate time, for the new united
Chinese Republic is still trembling from the sixteen years of chaos she
has just passed through. And still rather weak and timid, as the United
States was following the Revolutionary W T ar in 1780, China is fighting to
keep the position that she has finally won.
On July 25, the United States recognized this new united republic and
a few days later the League of Nations followed suit. Even with this
recognition China faces a great many major problems today. Some of the
more important ones are the Japanese in Manchuria, Japan's twenty-one
demands, the extraterritoriality, and tariff autonomy.
For the first time China finds herself in a position to determine her
own destiny.
Like his American neighbor, the welfare of his country comes first
with the Chinese student. Jo him his country's problems arc* his own.
W 7 e take the opportunity to welcome these -Chinese students who come
here as they do with mingled feelings as to the outcome of the present
administration in the country of their birth. We wish them all the success
possible in their conference here, and in their attempt to understand the
problems that confront their country in her great experiment.
