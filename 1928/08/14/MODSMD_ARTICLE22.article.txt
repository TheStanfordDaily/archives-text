Marshall Bidwell, acting University
[organist, will give his regular Thurs
day afternoon organ recital in the
Memorial Church at 4:15 o'clock.
Schubert is represented on the pro
gram by his "Ave Maria." and "Mili
tary March." Schubert wrote a num
ber of attractive marches, most of
them for piano duet of which the
first, in D, is the most popular.
"To a Wild Rose," from McDowell's
"Woodland Sketches" will be played.
This composer was a master of color
ful smaller forms. In this sketch he
has caught the imprisoned daintiness
of the New England wild rose, love
liest of the wildflowers of early sum
mer.
Seven of every 100 auto busses in
Greece are from America.
