TWO WORDS
It took Mr. Hoover only two words
in his acceptance speech to assure
the Republicans he would run on their
party ticket for the presidential office.
It was a regular Cal Coolidge com
ment; it contained no unnecessary
flourishes, no flowery phrases; it was
just "I accept." This is typical of
Hoover as we of Stanford know. It
was a statement of an ordinary Ameri
can who likes to say what he has to
say in the shortest way possible and
get it over with.
"American Democracy?"
With the modern theorists constant
ly pointing out the faults and short
comings of American democracy,
"America's great experiment," Mr.
Hoover called it, we were beginning
to believe that maybe the land of op
portunity was merely a land where
justice and fairness alike are only for
the rich, where the lowly born has no
opportunity to rise, where "pull" and
not honest endeavor counts.
But consider Mr. Hoover's career
and also that of his erstwhile oppon
ent, A1 Smith. Both of these men were
selected by their fellow countrymen
to run for the highest office the Na
tion affords. Both of these men rose
by sheer initiative and ability alone,
we are led to believe by their biogra
phers, and their respective records
show that they "got things done."
This ability was not overlooked as
they were selected out of some 120,-
000.000 people. Which leads us to be
lieve that after all American Demo
cracy is not,what the modern cynic
ists picture it.
When two men, one from an low.a
farm and one from the East Side of
New York, can work their way up,
competing wit hthe rich and the poor
alike, and aspire to the highest office
in the Nation, we cannot but believe
that American democracy is not such

a farce after all and perhaps "merit
does get its due reward."
Regardless of individual preference
for politics, Stanford men and women
should be proud of the comments
made on Mr. Hoover's acceptance
speech. With few exceptions ,the lat
est press quotations and editorials
from the various papers in the United
States are in accord with their praise
of the simpleness, frankness, and
earnestness of Mr. Hoover's speech.
A "Stanford Rough"
To us who know the background of
Hoover's life this comes as no sur
prise. The Hoover of his college days,
quiet, undemonstrative, with his abil
ity to tangle out student finances in
an undramatlc way, is the same as
Hoover, the presidential candidate.
He has been tempted as few men of
his time. He could have had the
laurels, the brightest medals of many
European nations. But he preferred
to remain as he was in his college
days, "A Stanford Rough."
Stanford men in the future may
justly look to Herbert Hoover, '95, as
combining all the ideals for which a
"Stanford Rough" has stood for in
this day of jazz palaces, short skirts,
drug-store cowboys, and prohibition.

show that they "got things done."
This ability was not overlooked as
they were selected out of some 120,-
000.000 people. Which leads us to be
lieve that after all American Demo
cracy is not,what the modern cynic
ists picture it.
When two men, one from an low.a
farm and one from the East Side of
New York, can work their way up,
competing wit hthe rich and the poor
alike, and aspire to the highest office
in the Nation, we cannot but believe
that American democracy is not such

a farce after all and perhaps "merit
does get its due reward."
Regardless of individual preference
for politics, Stanford men and women
should be proud of the comments
made on Mr. Hoover's acceptance
speech. With few exceptions ,the lat
est press quotations and editorials
from the various papers in the United
States are in accord with their praise
of the simpleness, frankness, and
earnestness of Mr. Hoover's speech.
A "Stanford Rough"
To us who know the background of
Hoover's life this comes as no sur
prise. The Hoover of his college days,
quiet, undemonstrative, with his abil
ity to tangle out student finances in
an undramatlc way, is the same as
Hoover, the presidential candidate.
He has been tempted as few men of
his time. He could have had the
laurels, the brightest medals of many
European nations. But he preferred
to remain as he was in his college
days, "A Stanford Rough."
Stanford men in the future may
justly look to Herbert Hoover, '95, as
combining all the ideals for which a
"Stanford Rough" has stood for in
this day of jazz palaces, short skirts,
drug-store cowboys, and prohibition.

TWO WORDS
It took Mr. Hoover only two words
in his acceptance speech to assure
the Republicans he would run on their
party ticket for the presidential office.
It was a regular Cal Coolidge com
ment; it contained no unnecessary
flourishes, no flowery phrases; it was
just "I accept." This is typical of
Hoover as we of Stanford know. It
was a statement of an ordinary Ameri
can who likes to say what he has to
say in the shortest way possible and
get it over with.
"American Democracy?"
With the modern theorists constant
ly pointing out the faults and short
comings of American democracy,
"America's great experiment," Mr.
Hoover called it, we were beginning
to believe that maybe the land of op
portunity was merely a land where
justice and fairness alike are only for
the rich, where the lowly born has no
opportunity to rise, where "pull" and
not honest endeavor counts.
But consider Mr. Hoover's career
and also that of his erstwhile oppon
ent, A1 Smith. Both of these men were
selected by their fellow countrymen
to run for the highest office the Na
tion affords. Both of these men rose
by sheer initiative and ability alone,
we are led to believe by their biogra
phers, and their respective records
show that they "got things done."
This ability was not overlooked as
they were selected out of some 120,-
000.000 people. Which leads us to be
