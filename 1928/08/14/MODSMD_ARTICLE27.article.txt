# NOTIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS
## 
### 
Perhaps not as thrilling, but un
doubtedly aB thrilled, as a crowd that
attends a football game, was the audi
ence in the stadium last Saturday. At
2:15 o'clock a gathering or people,
estimated at GB.OOO, from all over the
nation, had found places. They were
keenly listening to the ceremonies of
the official notification of Herbert
Hoover, by the Republican Party, as
their nominee for the President of the
United States.
Promptly at 2:30 o'clock Jack
Keough, KPO's official announcer,
stepped into the speaker's stand and
started the ceremonies with a greet
ing and a few preliminary announce
ments. In a few minutes the Stanford
Summer Band entered the field and
paraded about the oval playing,
"Come Join the Band."
The Official Notification Band fol
lowed, playing a melody of Southern
airs. Then the San Leandro Boys'
Marching Band, in blue and white uni
forms, played and drilled very com
mendably, followed by the crack band
of the Olympic Club of San Francisco.
In addition to the bands was the drum
and bugle corps of the Pasadena
American Legion, whose snap in drills
and playing added to the formality of
the whole affair.
Many notables arrived at the speak
ers' platform while the crowd's atten
tion was being focused on the band
maneuvers and the wonderful display
of day-fireworks that the committee
in charge of entertainment had ar
ranged. As nearly as possible Keough
would announce their arrival to the
audience. Among those mentioned
were Dr. Jordan and President Wil
bur who both received a large ovation
from the spectators.
At 3:20 o'clock the great radio
broadcast began. This broadcast, the
largest yet undertaken, reached the
entire world through the medium of
three broadcasting associations. The
Columbia Broadcasting Association,
the National Broadcasting Associa
tion, and the Hearst Broadcasting
Service were the three companies.
This was the first appearance of the
Columbia Broadcasting Association on
the Pacific Coast, and it is interesting
to know that this company did not
broadcast through any Western sta
tion, but carried the words direct to
the East over special telephonic con
nections, eventually to reach listeners
in Europe.
A distinguished collection of news
paper men sat in the press box direct
ly in front of the speakers' stand.
Every news syndicate, as well as the
leading newspapers, was represented.
Directly behind these, on a slightly
higher platform was the camera
stand. Here were men from every
news reel in the country. New to the
Stanford Stadium in this field was the
Fox Movietone, the latest develop
ment in the movie world, which takes
pictures of the movements as well as
records the voice of the speaker.
True to schedule, at 3:45 o'clock
Herbert Hoover, '95, Stanford's most
distinguished alumnus, and standard
bearer of the Republican party, ap
peared. The various bands gathered
in mass formation before the speakers'
stand and played "I Love You Cali
fornia," while the official car drove
about the oval. The distinguished
party received an ovation comparable
to any the Stanford stadium has heard.

Hoover drove to the Stadium in a
closed car and there he changed to
an open car to make the circuit of
the oval. Beside him on the rear seat
was Mrs. Hoover and in front of them
thei rson, Allen. As the car drove
slowly along with its escort of police
men, photographers rushed their
cameras over to get views of the can

didate as he acknowledged the cheers
of the throng by smiling and bowing.
The hurrahs of the crowd died
away as Hoover started to speak. He
stood on the speakers' platform con
fronted by the six microphones which
were to broadcast his words to the
world. Above the platform were the
loud speakers which enabled the mul
titude in the stadium to hear every
word distinctly. Even the occasional
slight coughs of the nominee were
clearly audible. He had his speech
enclosed in the familiar binder with
the Stanford seal upon it, and during
its reading he emphasized his words
by tapping his right hand upon the
stand in front of him. He smiled
broadly once when some enthusiast
yelled, "We're with you, Herbert,"
after he had announced his stand upon
the eighteenth amendment.

The speakers' stand was appropri
ate for the occasion. It was in the j
form of a tower with the loud speak
ers on top and was decorated in I
orange and green, the California j
colors. On the front and directly be
low the speaker was the historic seal
of California with its bear and stars. ;
Around the platform was a reserved
section where notable guests were j
seated.

The special press box for visiting
correspondents was situated directly
below the speakers' stand where
every detail of the notification could
be taken account of. In the box were
seventy-five men representing news
agencies and leading newspapers.
Telephone and telegraph lines were
at their side to aid them in sending
off their impressions. Often the tele
graph operator would be sitting next
to the correspondent clicking off the
words as fast as they were written on
the typewriter. Behind the newspaper
men on a raised stand were twenty
five cameramen who were constantly
active with their machines.

Little incidents occurred of a light
er nature than the main event: the
spectacle of a man and a boy fighting
over one of the flags that floated down
on a parachute; a motorcycle police
man getting hit in the eye with the
smoking shell of one of the daylight
bombs; students rushing ice water
to thirsty newspaper men and mem
bers of the band; amateur photogra- |
phers trying to snap Hoover with vest- j
pocket kodaks.
The speed with which the news-reel
photographers operate is illustrated
by the fact that movies of the notifi
cation were shown that same evening
in San Francisco theaters. The same j
pictures were shown last night at
Palo Alto.
