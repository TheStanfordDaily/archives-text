Three Stanford students competing
unattached in the track and field
meet at the South o' Market Boys'
annual picnic at Fairfax Park, Sun
day, took four places in three events.
Leon Carley won the two-mile from
a field of seasoned runners, and Doug
las Aiken placed fourth. Going into
the last lap of the half-mile on the
small 220-yard oval, Tex Crandall put
on a burst of speed which took him
from fifth place to second. He was
only beaten out by a few inches.
Crandall also placed fifth in the high
jump.
Harry Maloney refereed the meet.
