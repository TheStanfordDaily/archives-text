# "ROMEO AND JULIET" PLEASES AUDIENCE AT SATURDAY PRODUCTION
## Charm of Presentation Not Altered by Different Use of Settings 
### Laird Doyle 
"Romeo and Juliet" played a suc
cessful performance to a large audi
ence Saturday night. The production
proved that Shakespeare may be
treated in a manner foreign to the
traditional standards and still retain
its charm.
Margret Sliedd Kisich deserves the
highest praise for attempting such an
experiment and still higher regard for
carrying the idea through to a suc
cessful fruition.
Genevieve Downs, who played the
role of Juliet, did a charming interpre
tation of her part. She played a
Juliet charged with youthful intensity;
she did not permit the slightest trace
of sophistication to mar the freshness
of her characterization.
Robert Kirkwood, who played
Jtomeo, is perhaps the most interest
ing of the cast. Kirkwood took the
part a green actor about whom no
one knew enough to portend the out
come, but Saturday's performance un
covered talent which demands esteem.
Donald Cluxton, who was cast
in the part of Paris, carried his part
■with his usual power. His perfection
of voice modulation and physical
movement made his playing one of
the most successful bits of work done
in the show.
As the friar, Carol Wvnn developed
a more mature tone in his voice than
has ever been noticed before. In ad
dition he played his paYt with his
usual finesse.
Katherine Peck illustrated that her
popularity as an actress is based on
a solid foundation. Miss Peck played
a straight character part in a con
vincing manner.
Olga Spirito as Lady Capulet made
a beautiful picture of an old Spanish
matron. Her work, although not a
major part, added greatly to the play.
Wilbur Russell lacked the voice and
treated his part in a vapid manner;
it was Josephson, as Mercutio, who
saved him from being a flop by his
forceful playing. Josephson added
positiveness to all his scenes.
To Bill Baxter belongs the credit
for the lighting. He had a hard situa
tion to handle, but he succeeded in
transforming the Union Court into a
beautiful Spanish setting.
