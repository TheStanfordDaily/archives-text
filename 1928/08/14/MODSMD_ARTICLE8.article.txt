# RIGHT YOU ARE' IS SUMMER SEASON'S FINAL PRODUCTION
## Price, Volland, Rosenblatt To Star in Pirandello's Philosophic Play 
### Laird Doyle 
J The rehearsals for "Right You Are
II You Think You Are" have pro
gressed to such a point that one may
predict the probable result of the
creation. Pirandello's parable play is
the peculiar type of dramatic produc
tion which does not call for spectacu
lar acting, but demands intelligent
acting and line treatment. How well
it goes over —as to the philosopohy—
lies entirely with Gordon Davis and
his cast.
Volland Shows Ability
Virginia Volland, who has shown
more latent dramatic ability than any
other woman introduced to the cam
pus theater this quarter, is to play
an interesting part—interesting in
that her success in it will determine
her future in college dramatics. Miss
Volland should handle her part with
ease, for she has a power of interpre
tation seldom found in an inexperi
enced actress.
Verna Hannah is playing a most
difficult role, that of an elderly wo
man whose life is charged with con
flicts. Her characterization is a fldu
j ciary for a series of changing inter-
I'pretations. Her part calls for a great
| deal of ability and a good voice. She
I has the ability, but her voice will de
cide her success.
Difficult Role
Irving Rosenblatt has a difficult
role. His manner of playing will be
one of the major factors deciding the
success of tiie show. If Rosenblatt
1 outdoes himself, it will be a good in- 1
| terpretation; if he does his best, it ;
will be fair; but should he fail to fol- !
low Davis' direction, it will mar the j
entire production.
Pat Murphy is called upon to play i
an indistinct part distinctly. He, un- ,
less sr-txie unforeseen factor develops, j
will ploase a critical audience.
Dick Fisher has a part comparable
in many respects to the part he played
in "The Queen's Husband." He plays
the part of a petty official who is
garrulous. This garrulous quality will
undoubtedly strangle some of his |
power. Fisher can handle his part i
without effort and the role is inferior i
to his talent.
Louise Wilson plays the part of an
Italian flapper. It is an easy part and
if she fails to do a good job it will
be due to lack of ability.
Anne Mudge and Edwina Ewing are
playing the parts of old women, j
Merely old women —nothing more.
Anna May Price and Carol Wynn
are also in the cast and are expected I
to do work of a creditable nature. j
Miss Price is the most outstanding
actress in the production.
Italian Stage Setting
The idea of the stage decoration ;
in "Right You Are If You Think You j
Are" is to represent the feeling of
an Italian interior by the use of sug
gestive detail. However, the chromatic
representation will probably be done
in a slightly artificial manner so as
to present the particular mood of the
play. The technique employed by Har
old Helvenston will be interesting as
this is the first play in which he has
I)een able to employ naturalistic treat
ment.
