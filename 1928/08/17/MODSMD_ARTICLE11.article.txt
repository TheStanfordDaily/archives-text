# 'RIGHT YOU ARE' TO BE GIVEN TONIGHT.
## Murphy, Hannah, Rosenblatt Are Expected to Star In Italian Drama Last Two Rehearsals Have Developed Cast; Davis Pleased With Show 
### Laird Doyle 
Luigi Pirandello's play, "Right You
| Are If You Think You Are." is to be
i presented tonight. The last two re
hearsals have developed the cast be
; yond the expectations of those who
witnessed the first work Davis did on
I the play.
Life is what you see it to be. So is
! each person you may meet. Nothing
!is clear. Reality, truth are only mat
j ters of viewpoint. Hero or villain,
each of us may be one or both. This
i is the theme of "Right You Are If You
Think You Are," as expressed by the
author, who is an exponent of the
Italian school of so-called expression
j istic drama.
! Pat Murphy, who is playing the role
;of Ponza, will undoubtedly give an
interesting performance. He has one
lot' the most important parts and is
j considered to be perfectly cast.
Verna Hannah should make a name
for herself by her work in the last
part of the first act. This scene is the
I most difficult in the entire show, but
\ she handles it in an almost perfect
manner.
i Irving Rosenblatt, who made a hit
in "The Queen's Husband," is playing
I Lamberto Laudisi. He had a difficult
' time adapting himself to his part and
; it looked at first as if his interpreta
! tion would not be as finished as de
| sired, but last night's rehearsal indi
j cated that he will put on a superior
performance.
Commeudatore is being played by
j Dick Fisher. He has the voice to
I carry his part and he has also caught
j the tempo of the play. These things
'all go to make up a good playing of
the part.
! Dr. Paul Clyde, the Prefect, should
' do good work if one is to judge by his
i other work on the Stanford stage,
i Virginia Volland, playing Amelia, is
j doing more than justice to the char
| acter she is portraying. Her voice
j and her stage presence, coupled with
i her ability, makes her one of the
! most outstanding characters in the
j Play.
! Carol Wynn is to play Sirelli. Wynn
j is a dependable actor and there need
j be little doubt about his work.
Robert Steffens, Louise Wilson,
I Marguerite Louise, Anne Mudge, Ed
j wina Ewing, and Herman Salinger are
j also of the cast.
The setting to be used in the pro
duction is intended by Helvenston to
convey the mood of the drama and
also the locale, and present them in
an unobtrusive manner so as not to
distract from the action. Although
1 artificial in actual color the set will
j present a certain neutral quality in
front of which will be seen a moving
mass of more intense color of a som
ber hue, oftimes interspersed with
bits of brightness. Details diminutized
! smaller than those found in actuality
! are employed to serve only as a deco
j rative period keynote, and are obvi
j ously unintended for practical usage.

manner.
i Irving Rosenblatt, who made a hit

j cated that he will put on a superior
performance.
