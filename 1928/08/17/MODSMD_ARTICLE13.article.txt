# TORREY WILL DIRECT MEN'S HEALTH WORK
## Students to Receive Thorough Medical Examination by Enlarged Staff 
### 
Announcement was made Wednes
day that Dr. Harry Beal Torrey has
been appointed to the faculty in the
Physical Education Department to
take charge of Student Health Work.
Torrey, once a crack hurdler on
University of California track teams
and now one of the most distinguished
biological scientists of the country
and a graduate of the Cornell Univer
sity Medical School, will join the
Stanford Department of Physical
Education and Health Hygiene for
Men next year to head the enlarged
program of student health care to be
instituted by that department. His
appointment as professor of hygiene
and physical education was an
nounced from President Wilbur's of
fice today.
Thorough Physical Examination
Under Thomas A. Storey, head of
the department, the student health
service at Stanford will be greatly
extended next year. All men students
will be given a health examination
every year after this. In the past they
have been examined only at the time
of matriculation. The examinations
will be much more thorough than has
been possible with the limited staff
hitherto available, and they will be
followed up in every case calling for
further observation. In addition, capa
ble physicians will be on duty
throughout every day in the week for
consultation and advice instead of
only on certain hours on some days
as hitherto.
The object of the University is to
safeguard student health as fully as
possible. The new plan it is expected
will aid in detecting cases calling for
special attention early and permit
prompt advice for appropriate cor
rective and preventive measures.
There will be increased facilities also
for aiding students who are ill. To
cover the added expense of the new
program the fee for this health ser
vice will be set at $5, an increase of
$3.
Graduate of California
Dr. Torrey graduated from the
University of California in '95 and
received his M.S. fro mthere in '98.
Later he was awarded his Ph.D. from
Columbia and his M.D. from Cornell.
While attending California Torrey
was a well-known athlete. He there
devised a new form in hurdling where
by the runner cleared the bar by a
narrower margin that before. This
method made greater speed possible
and has since been extensively used
throughout the athletic world.
Torrey was on the University of
California faculty from 1895 until
1926 and has since taught at the Uni
versity of Oregon and at Reed Col
lege in Portland.
He has recently returned from an
extended trip to the Gulf of Mexico
and to his home in New York City
where he will remain until he comes
to the campus to take up his new
duties here the first of September.
