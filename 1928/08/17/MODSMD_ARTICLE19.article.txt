# A 						Good Example

### 
The Chinese Students Alliance, composed of college men and women
from the western section of the United States, opened its twenty-sixth
annual convention yesterday on the Stanford campus. A diversified pro
gram for the next four days includes debating, oratory, and essay contests,
and athletic and social events.
It is of the utmost significance that the subjects chosen for discussion
deal with China's national problems. The topics, "The Unification of
China" and "Our Relations with Japan," cover the two most serious
questions now facing that great country.
The delegates will be able to discuss these questions intelligently
because politics is one of the favorite pastimes of the Chinese student.
While the young American is thinking about everything else but national
affairs the Chinese are engaged in arguments that would put many of
our prominent legislators to shame. They are formed into political groups
and take their politics seriously.
What is more interesting and significant is that they do not stop at
mere discussion. They make demonstrations against things which they
believe unfair and have forced themselves to be considered as farmers of
public opinion.
Americans, both students and adults, would do well to follow the
example of the Chinese students. Young Americans take little interest in
f>olitics and the average adult's disinterested attitude is pitiful. Most of
the latter class dismiss the working of the government as a thing that
will be taken care of by politicians, whom they consider dishonest, and fail
to use their ballot to good effect. Most of them make no attempt to get a
corriplete understanding of the issues involved. If they do make any
attempt they read only one side. All of which is the reason that many
politicians are able to get away with graft and misconduct.
The nomination of Herbert Hoover and the fact that he has made his
campaign headquarters at Stanford for the past month has been a great
aid in interesting Stanford students in politics. Most of them know the
issues, and the stand of each candidate on these issues. They have found
that it really isn't such dry material after all, and that a very nice bull
session can develop when a group with conflicting ideas of the merits of
the candidates gets together. The United States will benefit if this inter
est does not die out but continues on into future years, for then Stanford
will send out a number of people who not only realize the faults of gov
ernment but will be in a position to remedy some of them

campaign headquarters at Stanford for the past month has been a great
aid in interesting Stanford students in politics. Most of them know the
issues, and the stand of each candidate on these issues. They have found
that it really isn't such dry material after all, and that a very nice bull
session can develop when a group with conflicting ideas of the merits of
the candidates gets together. The United States will benefit if this inter
est does not die out but continues on into future years, for then Stanford
will send out a number of people who not only realize the faults of gov
ernment but will be in a position to remedy some of them
The Chinese Students Alliance, composed of college men and women
from the western section of the United States, opened its twenty-sixth
annual convention yesterday on the Stanford campus. A diversified pro
gram for the next four days includes debating, oratory, and essay contests,
and athletic and social events.
It is of the utmost significance that the subjects chosen for discussion
deal with China's national problems. The topics, "The Unification of
China" and "Our Relations with Japan," cover the two most serious
questions now facing that great country.
The delegates will be able to discuss these questions intelligently
because politics is one of the favorite pastimes of the Chinese student.
While the young American is thinking about everything else but national
affairs the Chinese are engaged in arguments that would put many of
our prominent legislators to shame. They are formed into political groups
and take their politics seriously.
What is more interesting and significant is that they do not stop at
mere discussion. They make demonstrations against things which they
believe unfair and have forced themselves to be considered as farmers of
public opinion.
Americans, both students and adults, would do well to follow the
example of the Chinese students. Young Americans take little interest in
f>olitics and the average adult's disinterested attitude is pitiful. Most of
the latter class dismiss the working of the government as a thing that
will be taken care of by politicians, whom they consider dishonest, and fail
to use their ballot to good effect. Most of them make no attempt to get a
corriplete understanding of the issues involved. If they do make any
attempt they read only one side. All of which is the reason that many
politicians are able to get away with graft and misconduct.
The nomination of Herbert Hoover and the fact that he has made his
campaign headquarters at Stanford for the past month has been a great
aid in interesting Stanford students in politics. Most of them know the
issues, and the stand of each candidate on these issues. They have found
that it really isn't such dry material after all, and that a very nice bull
session can develop when a group with conflicting ideas of the merits of
the candidates gets together. The United States will benefit if this inter
est does not die out but continues on into future years, for then Stanford
will send out a number of people who not only realize the faults of gov
ernment but will be in a position to remedy some of them
