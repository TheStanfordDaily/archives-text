# BOYS SELL POSIES TO 'FIVE HUNDRED'
## 
### 
There are two young men on this
campus who are commercializing the
love of Roble women for flowers.
They do not give flowers to young
ladies. No sir, they sell them.
The two young gentlemen are Bill
Roth, 8-year-old son of Comptroller
Roth, and David Mackenzie, a 10-
year-old chum, who have established
a flower stand on the campus where
cut flowers are sold for two cents
apiece and potted plants may be or
dered.
Sometimes the proprietors make a
dollar a day; sometimes they make
nothing for they do business only
when the spirit moves them. At other
times they 101 l on the shady lawn
near their stand or retire to the com
forts of their private clubroom. They
have been selling flowers "off and on"
for several months. Their best pa
trons are Roble women, for their
stand is in front of the Roth house
which is across from the fire depart
ment.
"People can get too many free
flowers in the spring and summer,"
said Mackenzie. "They don't need to
buy 'em, so we only work once in
awhile."
"We buy things for our club
with the money," said young Roth,
pointing to a window of his house
which was plastered with stickers.
