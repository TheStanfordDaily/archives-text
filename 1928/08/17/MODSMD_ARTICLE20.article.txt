# Friendly Rivals
## 
### 
With the registration for the fall semester at the University of Cali
fornia already begun, and with another year of Card and Bear compe
tition in sight, we take this opportunity to speak of California's great
crew, for it was easily the outstanding group in the 1928 Olympic Games
held in Amsterdam this summer. Always consistent, winning race after
race, never faltering for a moment these men proved themselves not
only the best crew in the nation, but the best in the world.
From all indications it looks like Stanford is in for some hot recep
tions from our age old rival, the Bear, during the coming year. Although
Stanford has no crew, keen competition in all other sports have featured
the contests between these two universities in the last few years, and the
Bears are hopeful that next year will bring a change in their favor.
Although Stanford and California are rivals, a close friendship exists
between the two. Each is willing to admit the superiority of the other in
any division of competition providing that superiority really exists. They
represent the best on the Coast scholastically as well as in athletics. They
need bow to none in East or West.
