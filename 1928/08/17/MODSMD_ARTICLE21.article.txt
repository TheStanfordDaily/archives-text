# TWO STANFORD STARS PLAY ON WEST TEAM
## 
### 
Two Stanford tennis aces, Alan |
Herrington, '28, and Johnny Doeg, '31,
have been chosen to play on the West
team in the coming East-West tour
naments held today and tomorrow at
Forest Hills, New York.
The play will consist of five singles i
and three doubles matches for the |
two-day series. Both Herrington and i
Doeg have gained recognition as out- |
standing tennis stars during the sum- â€¢
rner. In the words of Bill Tilden, Doeg
so far this season has been in a j
slump, but is one of the most promis- 1
ing of the younger players.
Herrington was captain of last
year's varsity tennis team and Doeg
was captain of the freshman outfit.
