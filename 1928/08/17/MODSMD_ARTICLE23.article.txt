The Editor, Sir:
Away with every Stanford tradi
tion, if you will, yea, every one ex
cepting the first one, which is that
there will be no smoking on the
Quad. If the Stanford students are not
guilty of the cigarette patterns in
front of the Memorial Church, they
should see to it that the others are
a little more thoughtful, and squelch
the apparent ambition to imitate the
mosaics in discarded cigarette stubs.
It has long been a subject of ad
verse comment to see the ever-present
embellishments of cigarette butts on
the library steps, but when the
smokers treat the entrance to the
Memorial Church in a like manner,
someone should call attention to the
lapse of sentiment, or propriety, or
tradition, or to all three. -â€”E.A.
