TRiSTRAM. By Edwin Arlington Rob
inson. (New York: Macmillan &
Co., 1927.)
Take the old story of Tristam, mix
it with the cold brilliancy of the stars
and the heat and abandon of a forest
fire, put them on paper, and you have
Robinson's "Tristram." It is in this
poem we find that there is a crack in
his New England shell through which
occasional drops of humor seep; there
are weak seams in his Yankee armor
from which the flames of a passionate
soul scroll burning passages; but still
on the cold armor is written in a
pencil of steel the provincial contem
plations of somber, drear reflections
of propriety. Yet in this work he has
forgotten to search for "the dust be
neath the carpet"—most unusual for
Robinson.
The expression of passion at cer
tain points borders upon vulgarity—
not a vulgarity of expression but
rather a vulgarity of intensity. Yet
despite this slight excess one is able
to distinguish a slight flavor of go-to
hell-if-you-doism. Perhaps this is the
price one pays for the adoration of
Bryant, Robinson's early god.

I do not know exactly wljat com
poses "unrhymed organic cadence";
but if it is found in the mode of ex
pression used in this poem, it is beau
tiful. The free verse carries, through
out the whole work, a restraint of in
tangible, formal line meter; for the
rhythm of the line is so formulated
to defend it against unusual exaggera
tion. "Tristam" is one of the most
charming poetical works to hear pro
duced for a long time. It is compara
ble to Lanier's "Marshes of Glynn."
Despite the fact that it delves
deeply into the emotional, "Tristam"
saves itself by some miracle from be
coming sticky with sentimentality.
Perhaps the enchanting tempo of the
natural lines dulls the realistic pre
ception of the average reader; or
again, Robinson may have adopted
a delicate balance on the dividing
peak. Thus it is safe to say that he
has reached the maximum of emo
tional reaction without antagonizing
the reader.
"Tristam" is a work of art. It can
stand alone. To compare it would be
a detraction.
