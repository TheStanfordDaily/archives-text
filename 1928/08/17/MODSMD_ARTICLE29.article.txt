# 'PAGANISM OF MODERN WORLD' DISCUSSED BY VISITING PROFESSOR
## Present Day Conception of Religion Seen in Lives Of Tolstoi, Ibsen 
### 
"Are the Foundations of the Mod
ern World Pagan?" was the subject
of a lecture delivered Tuesday in the
Little Theatre by George Rebec, dean
of the graduate school at the Univer
sity of Oregon and at present acting
professor of philosophy here.
"In viewing the field of human be
havior our actions follow our intelli
gence. In the life of Shakespeare and
Michael Angelo we see the gigantic
mnfolding of these men. Every epoch
finds in some individual a summary
of itself and a forerunner of the next.
Follow the plays of Shakespeare and
find the earmarks of the thought that
produced them," declared Px-ofessor
Rebec.
"In them we find the idealistic
world that looked good to men, and
the glorious fantasy, the splendid
villain, the ardent lover; and in Julius
Caesar, the thought that men are
masters of their own fate. Later we
have the misgivings of a dying faith
in Hamlet and King Lear. If Shake
speare ever left the church he went
back to it. After he had passed
through the depths, he emerged a
mystic.
"In the works of Michael Angelo
we see the same development. In the
'Sleeping Cupids,' in 'David,' and in
the 'Last Judgment' we see the trag
edy of a great life. In the end Michael
Angelo also returned to the church.
"In modern times such lives as
those of Ibsen and Tolstoi show us
that religion is the modern concep
tion of life. Driven by ideal concep
tion man's problems are not simple.
Again we find ourselves returning to
the age-old question, will the unravel
ing of this intricate web lead back
to the church or to an 'unknown
God'?"
