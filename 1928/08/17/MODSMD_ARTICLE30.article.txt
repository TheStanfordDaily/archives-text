# ROBLE CLUB TO GIVE DINNER FOR FACULTY
## 
### 
Invitations have been issued by
Roble Club to a group of faculty
members for dinner Wednesday night.
This will be the second affair of its
kind given during the Summer Quar
ter, a first faculty dinner having
taken place at the beginning of the
session.
In addition to these functions, Roble
Club has entertained faculty guests
at one of its regular Tuesday after
noon teas. The dinner Wednesday
night will probably be the last oppor
tunity for women living in the Hall,
to have professors and their wives as
their guests before the end of the
quarter.
Phoebe Ward is in charge of ar
rangements for the dinner. Special
hostesses will be assigned to the
tables.
