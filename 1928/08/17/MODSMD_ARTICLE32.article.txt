The corner of Third and Howard
streets in San Francisco was made
famous by the notorious Howard
Street gangsters. It is now regarded
as the most dangerous spot in the
city after dark, and few people, ex
cept "those who belong," dare to walk
near this corner after 8 o'clock.
Therefore, if anyone is interested in
seeing this notorious corner, the
writer of this column would suggest
that, as a matter of personal safety,
he should inspect it under the light
of the sun. Even then it might be
wise to leave any valuables behind.
The Italian section of San Fran
cisco, more familiar to most people
as "Wop Town," is one of the most
famous amusement centers on the
Pacific Coast. Along Columbia street,
and in that general direction, are an
unbelievable number of cafes, speak
easies, and restaurants. How all these
places are supported is more than the
writer would care to guess; but sup
ported they must be, for the proprie
tors are always in evidence, looking
prosperous and smoking large cigars.
Saturday night is the time to go the
rounds of "Wop Town," because on
that particular night most of San
Francisco goes out for a good time,
and a large portion of the more lively
crowd goes to the Italian Section.
After a visit to several cafes located
in this part of town, anyone would re
ceive quite a jolt if he were to read
the Constitution, and were to get as
far as the Eighteenth Amendment.
The San Francisco bay is the only
body of water hereabouts suitable for
sailing and even there difficulties are
encountered. The bay down at this
end is shallow and muddy and is really
not much more than tide flats. The
bottom is of mud and the banks are
of mud for miles back. The only
means of getting into the bay proper
at the present time is a narrow and
twisting slough called the Palo Alto
Harbor.
The announcement of the formation

of the Palo Alto Yacht Club leads one
to consider the difficulties involved.
Sailboats cannot negotiate the slough
without a kicker motor or without
being towed. It is used now only by
tugboats which carry supplies to the
dredges at work in the bay and by
sundry duck hunters in their punts.
Once in the bay it is really neces
sary to go beyond the Dumbarton
bridge and the Dumbarton cut-off to
find decent sailing. To do this the
men on the bridges have to open the
draw bridges and pioneers in sailing
on this part of the bay have amusing
stories to tell of trying to make the
passage in a high wind while lines
of cars were kept waiting.
Anyone who has sailed from the
Port Palo Alto carries vivid memories
of thick adobe mud, clinging and
black, and of hours spent stranded
on mud banks waiting for the tide to
rise and float them again.
California has 276 state banks with
$1,851,998,023 resources.

The corner of Third and Howard
streets in San Francisco was made
famous by the notorious Howard
Street gangsters. It is now regarded
as the most dangerous spot in the
city after dark, and few people, ex
cept "those who belong," dare to walk
near this corner after 8 o'clock.
Therefore, if anyone is interested in
seeing this notorious corner, the
writer of this column would suggest
that, as a matter of personal safety,
he should inspect it under the light
of the sun. Even then it might be
wise to leave any valuables behind.
The Italian section of San Fran
cisco, more familiar to most people
as "Wop Town," is one of the most
famous amusement centers on the
Pacific Coast. Along Columbia street,
and in that general direction, are an
unbelievable number of cafes, speak
easies, and restaurants. How all these
places are supported is more than the
writer would care to guess; but sup
ported they must be, for the proprie
tors are always in evidence, looking
prosperous and smoking large cigars.
Saturday night is the time to go the
rounds of "Wop Town," because on
that particular night most of San
Francisco goes out for a good time,
and a large portion of the more lively
crowd goes to the Italian Section.
After a visit to several cafes located
in this part of town, anyone would re
ceive quite a jolt if he were to read
the Constitution, and were to get as
far as the Eighteenth Amendment.
The San Francisco bay is the only
body of water hereabouts suitable for
sailing and even there difficulties are
encountered. The bay down at this
end is shallow and muddy and is really
not much more than tide flats. The
bottom is of mud and the banks are
of mud for miles back. The only
means of getting into the bay proper
at the present time is a narrow and
twisting slough called the Palo Alto
Harbor.
The announcement of the formation

of the Palo Alto Yacht Club leads one
to consider the difficulties involved.
Sailboats cannot negotiate the slough
without a kicker motor or without
being towed. It is used now only by
tugboats which carry supplies to the
dredges at work in the bay and by
sundry duck hunters in their punts.
Once in the bay it is really neces
sary to go beyond the Dumbarton
bridge and the Dumbarton cut-off to
find decent sailing. To do this the
men on the bridges have to open the
draw bridges and pioneers in sailing
on this part of the bay have amusing
stories to tell of trying to make the
passage in a high wind while lines
of cars were kept waiting.
