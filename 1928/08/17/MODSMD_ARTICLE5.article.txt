# AIRSHIPS, MOTORCYCLES USED IN RUSHING FILM TO NATION'S THEATERS
## Paramount News Cameraman Explains Methods Used During Notification 
### 
Airplanes and motorcycles are used
to rush the delivery of news reel films
to the theaters.
So G. F. Schoedsack, Paramount
News cameraman who has been on
the campus during Hoover's stay, ex
plained the methods in use to let the
public see events on the screen as
soon as possible after they have hap
pened.
Pictures of the Hoover notification
were shown that same night in San
Francisco. Schoedsack and his two
assistants stationed themselves at
different points in the stadium to get
views of the crowd at various angles.
These pictures were completed before
the speech began.
Five minutes after Hoover started
speaking they had made the neces
sary shots of him and had given the
films to waiting motorcycle messen
gers who sped away to San Francisco
with them. There the films were de
veloped and prints made for the main
theaters on the Pacific Coast. The
negative was then sent by air mail
to New York to be shown there.
Close-ups of Hoover were taken
with special telephoto lenses since
the camera platform was at such a
distance from the speaker to prohibit
the use of an ordinary lense.
Schoedsack says that in cases
where extreme speed is desired the
films are developed in the airplane
that is carrying them to their destina
tion. This method was used to insure
rush delivery of the Kansas City con
vention pictures to New York.
