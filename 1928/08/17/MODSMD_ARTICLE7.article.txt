# Dr. David Muzzey Talks On Forces That Warp Truth
## 'History and Science,' Topic; Largest Audience of Quarter Gathers 
### 
Probably the largest audience which
has assembled in the Little Theatre
'this quarter was the one which
greeted Professor David S. Muzzey
when he spoke on "History and Sci
ence" Wednesday afternoon. This
Summer marks the first visit of the
well-known historian to the Pacific
Coast.
"History does not repeat itself, the
Professor declared. It is unique. It is
doubtful whether we can draw lessons
from the past. History is the total
story of all the relations of humans,
the most intricate work since the day
of creation. The so-called hfistorian of
the past generation was not a scien
tific scholar as we understand that
term to mean today. He was a liter
ary artist whose purpose was to pro
duce a literary masterpiece or effect."
Professor Muzzey placed emphasis
on the fact that we are living in an
age of scientific publications. History,
however, is not a true science because
it lacks the objectivity which pure
sciences have. In studying history we
can rely only on what documents we
can find and on what we can hear.
For that reason history can produce
just a small part of the truth.
"The historian of scientific learn
ing never prefers a less established
account to a more established one,"
he declared. "A memoir is never to be
used if contemporary documents are
available. People writing memoirs and
looking back through the refracting
medium of time see things as they
ought to have been rather than the
way in which they really occurred."
