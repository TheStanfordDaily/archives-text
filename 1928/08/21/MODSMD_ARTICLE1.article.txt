Letter Sent to Senator Kellogg

mittee of Foreign Relations was
formed and authorized the right to
send the following letter to Secretary
of State James J. Kellogg, expressing
their sincere appreciation for the
diplomatic efforts made by America
in behalf of their struggling Mother
land. The letter reads as follows:
"America has again proved the one
true friend of China —declaring in
spite of severe external pressure, a
foreign policy that insured China her
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
"The consummation of your new
treaty with China marks the addition
of a new and glorious page in the
growing book of friendship that em
braces both the Chinese and Ameri
can peoples. We, the students who
understand the gratitude of our fel
low-citizens, feel sure that this Ameri
can recognition of the New Chinese
Republic will impress the other na
tions and the other peoples with the
inherent justice and humanity of
China's demands and also firmly be
lieve that this policy of friendship to
wards China will inevitably result in
a tremendous increase of trade and
commerce between the two civiliza
tions."
