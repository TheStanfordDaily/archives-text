# LAST TEA OF QUARTER WILL BE GIVEN THIS AFTERNOON AT ROBLE
## 
### 
The last Roble tea of the Summer
Quarter will be given this afternoon
from 3:30 to 5:30 o'clock. Everyone is
invited and it is hoped that an espe
cially large number of faculty mem
bers, Summer Quarter students, and
friends of Roble Club will attend,
making this the largest tea of the
session.
Today's informal reception will be
the concluding number of a series of
similar affairs which Roble Club has
been sponsoring every Tuesday after
noon during the quarter. These teas
have been non-invitational and, while
intended primarily for women living
in Roble Hall, the entire campus pub
lic has been welcome.
Miss Olivia Boezinger, social direc
tor of the Hall, will preside at the
table this afternoon and a committee
appointed by Elizabeth Doyle will
serve.
