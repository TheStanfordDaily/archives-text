# Physical Examinations To Be Given Football Men, Students In Fall
## Encina Gymnasium s Medical Staff Enlarged; New Equipment Put In 
### 
"Every football player and every
new student who enters here in the
Fall quarter will be given a thorough
physical examination by as competent
a staff of physicians as it is possible
to assemble," said Dr. Storey, head
of the Physical Education department,
yesterday.
September 17 has been set as the
date on which all members of the
varsity and freshman football squads
will be examined. The regular medi
cal staff of the department, consist
ing of Doctors Torrey, Lindquist,
Roth, Kneble, Storey, Brown, and
several members of the School of
Medicine at San Francisco, as well as
Palo Alto dentists and physicians, will
examine. This will be the first time
that the new building has been used
for the examinations and as there is
a great deal of new equipment it is
believed that the staff will be able
to do the varsity squad and the fresh
man squad of 100 in one day.
New lower division and new upper
division students here September 28
for the aptitude test will be given
their physical examination on that
day. The remaining lower division
men will be examined October 1, and
all new upper division men and gradu
ates on October 2.
After next year every student will
be given an examination every year.
Until this is effective, however, any
upper division or graduate student
can secure such an examination by
applying to the medical advisor's of
fice.
