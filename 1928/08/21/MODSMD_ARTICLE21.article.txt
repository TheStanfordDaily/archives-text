### 
Facing one of the toughest sched
ules in Pacific Coast gridiron history,
the Stanford Varsity football team
will begin practice here on Septem
ber 15. Advanced sales, which have
been greater than ever before, prove
that a record crowd will see the Cards
in action during the 1928 season.
With only one week of practice the
Redshirts will meet the Presidio Army
team of San Francisco, and the
Y.M.I, team here on September 22,
and the following Saturday they will
clash with the strong Olympic Club
team.

The Cards will make four trips dur
ing the season, traveling over 8000
miles. Their longest trip will be to
New York where they will meet the
United States Military Academy's
team on December 1. Other trips in
clude the University of Oregon at
Eugene on October 6, Southern Cali
fornia at Los Angeles on November 3,
and California at Berkeley on Novem
ber 24. Following this game the team
will leave almost immediately for
New York to play the West Point
game which takes place the following
Saturday.
With the addition of three new men
Coach Pop Warner will have one of
the best football staffs in the coun
try. The three new men added dur
ing the past year are Ernie Nevers,
Card captain in '25, Ed Walker, star
