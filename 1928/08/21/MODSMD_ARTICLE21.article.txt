# FOOTBALL MEN BEGIN PRACTICE SEPTEMBER 15
## Varsity Squad Will Face One Of Hardest Schedules In History Nevers, Walker, Bradshaw, To Assist Pop Warner On Coaching Staff 
### 
Facing one of the toughest sched
ules in Pacific Coast gridiron history,
the Stanford Varsity football team
will begin practice here on Septem
ber 15. Advanced sales, which have
been greater than ever before, prove
that a record crowd will see the Cards
in action during the 1928 season.
With only one week of practice the
Redshirts will meet the Presidio Army
team of San Francisco, and the
Y.M.I, team here on September 22,
and the following Saturday they will
clash with the strong Olympic Club
team.
To Make Four Trips
The Cards will make four trips dur
ing the season, traveling over 8000
miles. Their longest trip will be to
New York where they will meet the
United States Military Academy's
team on December 1. Other trips in
clude the University of Oregon at
Eugene on October 6, Southern Cali
fornia at Los Angeles on November 3,
and California at Berkeley on Novem
ber 24. Following this game the team
will leave almost immediately for
New York to play the West Point
game which takes place the following
Saturday.
With the addition of three new men
Coach Pop Warner will have one of
the best football staffs in the coun
try. The three new men added dur
ing the past year are Ernie Nevers,
Card captain in '25, Ed Walker, star
end in '25 and '26, and Rabbit Brad
shaw, former University of Nevada
gridiron star. It is not known as yet
how these men will assist the present
staff of Thornhill, Winterburn, and
Hunt, but it is probable that this will
be decided upon Warner's return from
Europe early next month.
Eighteen Veterans Return
Eighteen letter men will return
Fall Quarter, the list inclules Captain
Biff Hoffman, Post, Kazanjian, Ro
beskv, Preston, Muller, Davidson,
Harder, Worden, Heinecke, Cook, i
Frentrup, Wilton, Sims, Sellman, Kla- ;
bau, Lewis, and Fleishhacker, as well j
as many prospects from last year's ;
freshman and "goof" squads. Such an
array of stars should give rival I
coaches plenty of cause for worry.
According to Jake Irwin, manager
of the ticket department, advanced 1
orders for tickets have surpassed all :
previous years. With the number re- j
served for students, team, coaches, [
and alumni set aside, only 3000 tickets j
remain from the Stanford Big Game
allotment of 27,000. Ticket applica-j
tions for the Washington and South- ;
ern California games are also coming
in faster than ever before. Rooters'
tickets will go on sale several days '
before each game.
Alumni or students who desire tick- j
ets for the West Point game should
make application direct to the Board j
of Athletic Control here. Each appli
cant is limited to six tickets. The !
general public must apply direct to
the West Point Athletic Board.
Tickets For Eastern Game
This year the stadium will be
equipped with loudspeakers, which
will be in operation for the first games j
on September 22. KPO will broadcast I

tail the important games for Stanford
I again this year.
California, Washington, Southern
| California, and Stanford have just
I signed a five-year agreement to meet
' each other on the gridiron every sea
j son from 1929 to 1933. "This agree
ment does not interfere with the pres
: ent Pacific Coast Conference in any
i way, but will probably give a better
j chance to decide the real winner of
the Conference championship," de
; clared A1 Masters, Graduate Manager,
! yesterday.
