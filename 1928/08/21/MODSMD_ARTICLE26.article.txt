# Try And Beat Them

As the quarter rapidly draws to a close, the summer student rarely
has the time to draw upon the stock of events that have piled up in his
memory during the past ten weeks. If, in a dull moment one slips into
a state of reverie, the past dramatic season vividly comes to mind if
you attended the productions.
No one of the three productions can lie compared with the other—
each was in a different sphere of thought and from the pen of authors
of different nationalities. This makes judgment of relative merits im
possible. In spite of this, the student who attended the productions bv
Gordon Davis is apt to believe that these plays underwent the process of
progressive evolution, and that the climax was reached with the presenta
tion of Pirandello's "Right You Are If You Think You Are."
Is that far wrong? When has a Stanford audience received such a
treat? True, it may have been less obvious in places, but few escaped
doing some pondering when the final curtain dropped.
Which of Mr. llelvenston's sets was the most pleasing? You wish
the truth? But in the light of Friday's performance one fears to be so
venturesome as to give it.
