Wtih the approach of the close of Stanford's 1928 Summer Quarter,
the Stanford Daily would step forward a pace to voice most respect
fully the sentiments of departing students and visiting faculty in paying
their respects to John A. Sellards, director of the summer session. In him
all recognize, who have come into personal contact with him. the stamp
of the true diplomat whose diplomacy and ardent desire for the welfare of
all has made this Summer Quarter a smooth-running machine.
Wtihout his careful preparations for the summer, and lacking his
wise and scholarly executive guidance of affairs throughout these recent
weeks, this might have been, all can well imagine, a less profitable, a less
enjoyable, and a less enlightening summer.
it was the office of John A. Sellards, of course, which arranged for
the week-end sight-seeing tours. It was the Director of the Summer
Quarter who arranged for the concerts in Branner Hall. It was with his
encouragement that three theatrical productions were promoted and ad
mirably staged on the Stanford campus. And when the Hoover notifica
tion ceremonies were about to take place he saw to it that Stanford folks
were adequately taken care of by passing out tickets in advance.
Some schools are satisfied with summer directors who serve as trouble
shooters merely, hut John A. Sellards has a different conception of the
job. lie takes the difficult role of host; summer students and visiting
faculty members are his guests. Ours is the summer director par
excellence.
