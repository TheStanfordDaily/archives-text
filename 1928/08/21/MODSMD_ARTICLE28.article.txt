SUMMER QUARTER HIGH LIGHTS
As this is the last edition of the
Summer Quarter Daily for 1928, and
as only two more weeks of school re
main, it is appropriate that we speak
of the outstanding events that have
so helped to make this an unusual
summer.
First and without doubt the most
outstanding was the brief visit of
Herbert Hoover, *95. Hoover returned
here to receive the official notification
of his nomination as the Republican
candidate for the presidency. This
honor, bestowed upon the man who
is probably Stanford's most famous
alumnus, leads all the other successes,
yet attained by him, either in busi
ness or in politics.
With Hoover came newspaper cor
respondents, photographers, and news
reel men from all parts of the United
States. For practically a month Stan
ford University appeared as a date
line for at least one front page story
on nearly every daily newspaper in
the country. The visiting newspaper
men were cordially and enthusiasti
cally welcomed and, as a result, their
feeling toward Stanford was reflected
throughout the civilized world.
August 11 was probably the biggest
day of the summer as far as Stanford
was concerned for on that day 70,000
people, the largest crowd ever to at
tend a political ceremony in the his
tory of the United States, heard Her
bert Hoover make his speech of ac
ceptance.
Notables from all parts of the
country mingled with the throng. It
was a gala day in the history of Cali
fornia, and one to be long remem
bered. Stanford should be proud that
this famous alumnus chose his alma
mater for the place of notification.
Stanford teams proved that sports
have become international and can
no longer be confined to a single
country or state, for while members
of the track team were battling to
ward an American victory at the
Olympics in Amsterdam. Holland, the
Stanford baseball team was cleaning
up the east side of Australia in the
great American pastime. Practically
12,000 miles separated these two
teams, yet the members of each team,
in the same manner, were establish
ing reputations as gentlemen and
good sportsmen in addition to ex
hibiting their athletic abilities; last
ing reputations of which Stanford will
be proud.
Gordon Davis returned from the
East early in the summer, bringing
with him a stage technician, and
graduate of the Yale Dramatic
School, Harold Helvenston. Together,
these two men have presented three
plays this quarter which would put
many professional productions to
shame. With Davis directing and Hel
venston in charge of the stage set
tings, this pair is hard to surpass.
The first presentation of the quar
ter, "The Queen's Husband," was a
clever satire on modern monarchies
in which Gordon Davis, as the King,
and Betty Wilbur, as the Queen, vir
tually stole the show.
"The Chief Thing" was the second
production. Erveinoft's fantastic crea
tion was presented as part of the
varied dramatic program for the Sum
mer Quarter. Davis borrowed it from
the New York stage in order that he

might acquaint the people of this vi
cinity with a new type of expression
istic thought which has lately pre
vailed in so many Eastern successes.
A cast of forty people carried this
unusual philosophical comedy through
to a brilliant finale.
In his third and final play of the
summer the Stanford director pre
sented Pirandello's metaphysical
melodrama, "Right You Are If You
Think You Are." The characteriza
tions of Verna Hannah, Pat Murphy,
and Irving Rosenblatt were especially
outstanding in this charming drama
of Italian life.

Among conventions to which Stan
ford played host this summer were:
The Western School of Commercial
Secretaries, the Western Division of
the American Psychology Association,
and the Western Division of the Chi
nese Students Alliance. These con
ventions brought people not only
from the West but from all parts of
the nation.

During the summer thousands of
people have visited Stanford Univer
sity. Many came because they were
curious; because they wanted to see
the Hoover home and perhaps a
chance to see the nominee himself.
Many were notables who had come
from all parts of the country to pay
their respects to the Republican can
didate. A great number came to at
tend the notification ceremonies, and
to hear Hoover's acceptance speech.
Others came to attend a special con
vention, some social function, or a
dramatic production.
All this goes to show that the '
present-day university has become a
part of the world. It brings new peo- j
pie and new ideas to its doors. No J
longer does it resemble the seques- 1
tered retreat of the old-time univer
sity. —Anson Reeder.
Bowles Hall, a dormitory for men
and the first at the University of j
California, the gift of Mrs. P. E. 1
Bowles, soon will be completed. Its 1
cost is about $350,000.

The summer vacation camps of the j
University of California Agricultural i
Extension Eervice were attended by
2744 boys and girls who are members I
of agricultural clubs in the state.

tory of the United States, heard Her
bert Hoover make his speech of ac
ceptance.
Notables from all parts of the
country mingled with the throng. It
was a gala day in the history of Cali
fornia, and one to be long remem
bered. Stanford should be proud that
this famous alumnus chose his alma
mater for the place of notification.
Stanford teams proved that sports
have become international and can
no longer be confined to a single
country or state, for while members
of the track team were battling to
ward an American victory at the
Olympics in Amsterdam. Holland, the
Stanford baseball team was cleaning
up the east side of Australia in the
great American pastime. Practically
12,000 miles separated these two
teams, yet the members of each team,
in the same manner, were establish
ing reputations as gentlemen and
good sportsmen in addition to ex
hibiting their athletic abilities; last
ing reputations of which Stanford will
be proud.
Gordon Davis returned from the
East early in the summer, bringing
with him a stage technician, and
graduate of the Yale Dramatic
School, Harold Helvenston. Together,
these two men have presented three
plays this quarter which would put
many professional productions to
shame. With Davis directing and Hel
venston in charge of the stage set
tings, this pair is hard to surpass.
The first presentation of the quar
ter, "The Queen's Husband," was a
clever satire on modern monarchies
in which Gordon Davis, as the King,
and Betty Wilbur, as the Queen, vir
tually stole the show.
"The Chief Thing" was the second
production. Erveinoft's fantastic crea
tion was presented as part of the
varied dramatic program for the Sum
mer Quarter. Davis borrowed it from
the New York stage in order that he

might acquaint the people of this vi
cinity with a new type of expression
istic thought which has lately pre
vailed in so many Eastern successes.
A cast of forty people carried this
unusual philosophical comedy through
to a brilliant finale.
In his third and final play of the
summer the Stanford director pre
sented Pirandello's metaphysical
melodrama, "Right You Are If You
Think You Are." The characteriza
tions of Verna Hannah, Pat Murphy,
and Irving Rosenblatt were especially
outstanding in this charming drama
of Italian life.

Among conventions to which Stan
ford played host this summer were:
The Western School of Commercial
Secretaries, the Western Division of
the American Psychology Association,
and the Western Division of the Chi
nese Students Alliance. These con
ventions brought people not only
from the West but from all parts of
the nation.

During the summer thousands of
people have visited Stanford Univer
sity. Many came because they were
curious; because they wanted to see
the Hoover home and perhaps a
chance to see the nominee himself.
Many were notables who had come
from all parts of the country to pay
their respects to the Republican can
didate. A great number came to at
tend the notification ceremonies, and
to hear Hoover's acceptance speech.
Others came to attend a special con
vention, some social function, or a
dramatic production.
All this goes to show that the '
present-day university has become a
part of the world. It brings new peo- j
pie and new ideas to its doors. No J
longer does it resemble the seques- 1
tered retreat of the old-time univer
sity. —Anson Reeder.
Bowles Hall, a dormitory for men
and the first at the University of j
California, the gift of Mrs. P. E. 1
Bowles, soon will be completed. Its 1
cost is about $350,000.

The summer vacation camps of the j
University of California Agricultural i
Extension Eervice were attended by
2744 boys and girls who are members I
of agricultural clubs in the state.
SUMMER QUARTER HIGH LIGHTS
As this is the last edition of the
Summer Quarter Daily for 1928, and
as only two more weeks of school re
main, it is appropriate that we speak
of the outstanding events that have
so helped to make this an unusual
summer.
First and without doubt the most
outstanding was the brief visit of
Herbert Hoover, *95. Hoover returned
here to receive the official notification
of his nomination as the Republican
candidate for the presidency. This
honor, bestowed upon the man who
is probably Stanford's most famous
alumnus, leads all the other successes,
yet attained by him, either in busi
ness or in politics.
With Hoover came newspaper cor
respondents, photographers, and news
reel men from all parts of the United
States. For practically a month Stan
ford University appeared as a date
line for at least one front page story
on nearly every daily newspaper in
the country. The visiting newspaper
men were cordially and enthusiasti
cally welcomed and, as a result, their
feeling toward Stanford was reflected
throughout the civilized world.
August 11 was probably the biggest
day of the summer as far as Stanford
was concerned for on that day 70,000
people, the largest crowd ever to at
tend a political ceremony in the his
tory of the United States, heard Her
bert Hoover make his speech of ac
ceptance.

shame. With Davis directing and Hel
venston in charge of the stage set
tings, this pair is hard to surpass.
The first presentation of the quar
ter, "The Queen's Husband," was a
clever satire on modern monarchies
in which Gordon Davis, as the King,
and Betty Wilbur, as the Queen, vir
tually stole the show.
"The Chief Thing" was the second
production. Erveinoft's fantastic crea
tion was presented as part of the
varied dramatic program for the Sum
mer Quarter. Davis borrowed it from
the New York stage in order that he

might acquaint the people of this vi
cinity with a new type of expression
istic thought which has lately pre
vailed in so many Eastern successes.
A cast of forty people carried this
unusual philosophical comedy through
to a brilliant finale.
In his third and final play of the
summer the Stanford director pre
sented Pirandello's metaphysical
melodrama, "Right You Are If You
Think You Are." The characteriza
tions of Verna Hannah, Pat Murphy,
and Irving Rosenblatt were especially
outstanding in this charming drama
of Italian life.

Among conventions to which Stan
ford played host this summer were:
The Western School of Commercial
Secretaries, the Western Division of
the American Psychology Association,
and the Western Division of the Chi
nese Students Alliance. These con
ventions brought people not only
from the West but from all parts of
the nation.

During the summer thousands of
people have visited Stanford Univer
sity. Many came because they were
curious; because they wanted to see
the Hoover home and perhaps a
chance to see the nominee himself.
Many were notables who had come
from all parts of the country to pay
their respects to the Republican can
didate. A great number came to at
tend the notification ceremonies, and
to hear Hoover's acceptance speech.
Others came to attend a special con
vention, some social function, or a
dramatic production.
All this goes to show that the '
present-day university has become a
part of the world. It brings new peo- j
pie and new ideas to its doors. No J
longer does it resemble the seques- 1
tered retreat of the old-time univer
sity. —Anson Reeder.
Bowles Hall, a dormitory for men
and the first at the University of j
California, the gift of Mrs. P. E. 1
Bowles, soon will be completed. Its 1
cost is about $350,000.

The summer vacation camps of the j
University of California Agricultural i
Extension Eervice were attended by
2744 boys and girls who are members I
of agricultural clubs in the state.
SUMMER QUARTER HIGH LIGHTS
As this is the last edition of the
Summer Quarter Daily for 1928, and
as only two more weeks of school re
main, it is appropriate that we speak
of the outstanding events that have
so helped to make this an unusual
summer.
First and without doubt the most
outstanding was the brief visit of
Herbert Hoover, *95. Hoover returned
here to receive the official notification
of his nomination as the Republican
candidate for the presidency. This
honor, bestowed upon the man who
is probably Stanford's most famous
alumnus, leads all the other successes,
yet attained by him, either in busi
ness or in politics.
With Hoover came newspaper cor
respondents, photographers, and news
reel men from all parts of the United
States. For practically a month Stan
ford University appeared as a date
line for at least one front page story
on nearly every daily newspaper in
the country. The visiting newspaper
men were cordially and enthusiasti
cally welcomed and, as a result, their
feeling toward Stanford was reflected
throughout the civilized world.
August 11 was probably the biggest
day of the summer as far as Stanford
was concerned for on that day 70,000
people, the largest crowd ever to at
tend a political ceremony in the his
tory of the United States, heard Her
bert Hoover make his speech of ac
ceptance.
Notables from all parts of the
country mingled with the throng. It
was a gala day in the history of Cali
fornia, and one to be long remem
bered. Stanford should be proud that
this famous alumnus chose his alma
mater for the place of notification.
Stanford teams proved that sports
have become international and can
no longer be confined to a single
country or state, for while members
of the track team were battling to
ward an American victory at the
Olympics in Amsterdam. Holland, the
Stanford baseball team was cleaning
up the east side of Australia in the
great American pastime. Practically
12,000 miles separated these two
teams, yet the members of each team,
in the same manner, were establish
ing reputations as gentlemen and
good sportsmen in addition to ex
hibiting their athletic abilities; last
ing reputations of which Stanford will
be proud.
Gordon Davis returned from the
East early in the summer, bringing
with him a stage technician, and
graduate of the Yale Dramatic
School, Harold Helvenston. Together,
these two men have presented three
plays this quarter which would put
many professional productions to
shame. With Davis directing and Hel
venston in charge of the stage set
tings, this pair is hard to surpass.
