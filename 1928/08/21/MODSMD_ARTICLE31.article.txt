# WHITTIER HONORS MRS. HOOVER WITH DEGREE
## 
### 
Mrs. Herbert Hoover was presented
with the honorary degree of Doctor
of Literature Friday by Whittier Col
lege which she attended forty years
ago when it was a small Quaker
academy. Dr. Walter F. Dexter, pres
ent head of Whittier, conferred the
degree. This is the first honorary de
gree ever given a woman by Whittier
College. The award was made "in
recognition of her friendly interests,
which have been deep and enduring
in national and international scope,"
according to Dr. Dexter.
Although Mrs. Hoover graduated
from Stanford, she attended Whittier
when it was a small preparatory
school, previous to her entrance here.
