Trestles and ruined sections of
I track can still be seen along the coast
! left from the old Coastline Railroad.
1 This was put in some time ago by
the Southern Pacific to carry the
produce from the truck farms in the
Colma and Half Moon Bay regions to
the city. It was subsequently aban
; doned because of the competition of
; auto trucks. The gaunt wooden tres
tles with their weather-beaten tim
bers are a silent reminder of this for
gotten line. In other places grades
and cuts through hills show the work
that was put into the venture. It was
one of the most scenic lines in the
country, running, as it did, right next
to the ocean with cliffs on one side
and the sea on the other. The relent
less power of the sea can plainly be
seen for in spots it has encroached
on the land and eaten away the old
roadbed.
The writer of this column doesn't
know much about it, but he picked
up a fellow who was waiting for a
ride down the highway the other day
who told him quite a bit on the sub
ject. This chap was a chainman in a
surveying gang that is working on it,
so he should be quite well informed.
At airy rate he said that a highway
is being constructed from San Fran
cisco to Santa Cruz, and that it will
run along the sea the whole way. It
will probably follow the bed of the
old railroad mentioned above as much
as possible. When it is completed,
this road will be a beautiful drive, for
it will lie between the mountains and
the sea. This surveyor said that the
land was so irregular that it was even
difficult to measure it, so consequent
ly it will be still more difficult to
build a road over it, and the highway
won't be finished for a long time. But
its completion is something toward
which we can all look forward.
The San Mateo-Hayward Bridge,
which is now over half constructed,
will be the longest vehicular bridge in
the world. It will be seven and one
tenth miles long. The Raymond Con
struction Company is building it, and
it is being financed by Eastern capi
tal. The cost will be $7,500,000, with
the provision that there will be a
bonus of $1200 for every day before
June 1, 1929, that the bridge is com
pleted, and that a similar premium
will be charged for every day required
past that date. At present the con
struction company expects to com
plete the work in the early part of
February. After fifty years to com
plete the work in the early part of
February. After fifty years of private
ownership the bridge will revert to
the state.

The dome of the San Francisco city
hall is in sad need of regilding. The
elements have succeeded in tarnish
ing its former splendor so that now
only a few bits of the original gold
i remain. Mayor Rolph boasts of its
I height being greater than that of the
one at Washington, D.C., but he can't
do much talking about its condition.
Searsville Lake attracts quite a
throng of people these hot days, espe
cially on Sunday. On that day it pre
sents an interesting spectacle for the
philosopher or student of human na
ture. The majority of the bathers are
workers from San Francisco and
South City who get their only touch
of nature in this way. They start
coming early in the morning and stay
ing on the beach. A corps of ten life
guards—all Stanford students —are
required to watch over this crowd,
and their alertness is often the means
of saving people from trouble who
swim out over their depth and get
into difficulty.
The spot where this lake is was
once the scene of mining activities.
Numerous tunnels can still be seen
which pierce the hills and give evi
dence of a quest for quicksilver. A
dam was later constructed to store
;up water for the irrigation of Stan
ford. Several years ago when the lake
went dry the remains of buildings
could be seen on the bottom —the
tombstones of an abandoned mining
camp.
