# COMMERCIAL LICENSES GIVEN STUDENT FLYERS
## 
### 
At present there are 40 Stanford
students taking courses at the Palo
Alto flying school and 23 of them have
received licenses as commercial
flyers. These licenses demand at least
50 hours of solo flying.
The number of students who signed
up for instruction in flying during the
last quarter has resulted in the addi
tion of Lieutenant Chiappino to the
present staff of instructors.
Arrangements have been made to
obtain additional planes in prepara
tion for the student flyers expected
to attend the school this fall.
