# TACKABURY, GILBERT WIN HANDBALL SERIES
## 
### 
George Tackabury and William Gil
bert defeated Leonard Avilla and
Fred Telonicher in the finals of the
University handball tournament which
were played last Friday afternoon.
The match was well-played with
Tackabury displaying excellent hand
hall ability.
No progress has been made in the
men's singles tournament but it is
hoped that the finals will be played
off by the beginning of next week.
Those matches that have not been
played to deetermine the semi-finalists
should be completed this week in
order that the tournament may be
finished before the end of the quarter.
