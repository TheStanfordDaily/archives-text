# BALDENSPERGER TALKS AT MEETING OF CLUB
## 
### 
The Stanford English Club was en
tertained on Monday afternoon at the
borne of Professor and Mrs. Kennedy
in Palo Alto. Doctor Baldensperger
was the speaker for the occasion. He
chose for the subject of his discus
sion, "Modern Anglo-French Intellec
tual Relations."
"English and French literature,"
said Doctor Baldensperger, "are con
tinuous. From the Loire River north
to the lowlands of Scotland, the in
habitants have formed one thinking
mass; different in detail, yet retroac
tive enough to have furnished a con
stant stimulus to each other."
"English has been admired and
translated into French, and French
into English. Novelists, poets, essay
ists, and dramatists have had audi
ences in both countries. Shakespeare
was not so heartily appreciated in
France as in England, but Dickens,
Milton, Byron, and Scott have each
had their admirers and imitators, as
also has French writers their influ
ence on English tastes and ideals."
