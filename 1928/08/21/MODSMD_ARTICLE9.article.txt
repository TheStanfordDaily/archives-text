# PIRANDELLO'S ITALIAN PLAY HELD SUCCESS
## Helvenston's Realistic Set Creates Atmosphere, Spirit in Drama 
### Laird Doyle 
Luigi Pirandello's play, "Right You
Are If You Think You Are," was the
finest production which Gordon Davis
has put on this quarter. It was also
the most difficult to handle from
every aspect, for it was a talky, in
volved, and philosophical play. It
dragged in places, but due to no fault
of the medium nor to the play script
—it is the type of drama which neces
saily palls in spots, for it has a func
tional situation treatment which calls
for a detailed formation.
Verna Hannah, playing the role of
Signora Frola, did an outstanding
piece of work. At first she seemed to
have a difficulty in keeping her voice
in character, but after she warmed to
her part she played with absolute
character. She created a difficult im
pression to produce, for the audience
could see the evidence of sanity and
insanity in her characterization with
out being obviously conscious of
either. In Miss Hannah's emotional
scenes she practiced a restraint which
stressed the intensity of her work
without losing the poise necessary to
her part.
Murphy Adds Strength
Irvin Murphy, as Ponza, was the
first one to catch the tempo of the
play. Until his entrance there was no
definite rhythm noticeable, but after
he had introduced this necessary at
tribute it was carried throughout the
play. There was nothing subtle in
Murphy's acting—it was all positive
and clear-cut. The vitality of his play
ing and the obviousness of his reac
tions made him one of the strongest
factors in determining the perform
ance's success.
Anna May Price, during her short
time on the stage, held the audience
as no other actor or actress had dur
ing the evening. She impregnated her
part with an enchanting mysterious
nesses which is seldom found on an
amateur stage. The use of her hands
was perhaps the most finished bit of
individual playing in the show.
Irving Rosenblatt did a good piece
of work. He was inclined to orate in
places, but he caught the characteriza
tion and gave the audience a perfect
awareness of the connotation of his
lines. His gestures were a little awk
ward and few; however, they typified
his part. Rosenblatt played his part
with a smoothness despite all this,
and was able to get over his vitality
without ruffling the smoothness. His
work was strong and he did not lose
his character once during the entire
performance. His reactions were the
best and most consistent of the show.
Like Murphy, Rosenblatt held the rest
of the cast to the tempo of the drama.
Volland Striking
Virginia Volland was striking in
her part. Her voice was beyond criti
cisms and her control over It is pro
fessional. There is an ease about her
playing that leads to a pleasing na
turalness.
Dick Fisher looked and acted the
character that he was portraying to
perfection. His voice has improved
greatly since his last performance in
"The Queen's Husband." He blended
his voice, gestures, and appearance
into a finish characterization.
Carol Wynn played his part in a
very satisfactory manner. Wynn acted
with enthusiasm which he transmitted
to the audience. There is a freshness
about his work which pleases those
who witness it.
Louise Wilson, who played the in
genue, was inclined to pose, but did
her part adequately. Edwina Ewing
had a slightly childish tendency in the
use of her feet and a slight gasp was

noticeable in her voice, but her re
actions were of the finest. Anne
Mudge did a perfect character part—
her work and make-up was ridiculous
ly funny.
Clyde in Unique Role
Paul Clyde as the Police Commis
sioner was perfect. It was the first
time that I have ever witnessed a
mustache really quiver with indigna
tion. He and Irving Rosenblatt as
Prince of Greek in "The Queen's Hus
band" vie for the honors of creating
the most amusing characterization of
this season.
Virgil Anderson, as Centuri, played
his part most convincingly. Marguer
ite Louise did her bit in a pleasing
manner. Robert Steffens, John Jago,
and Herman Salinger did their small
parts well.
The set was unusually good. Helven
ston caught the spirit and the atmos
phere of the play. His set added ma
terially to the show. The realist set
was one which was startlingly con
crete in appearance. There was not
one criticism to be made of it. Hel
venston has done three sets this quar
ter —all different —and this one proves
that he can do realistic work and
show the same talent.

the most difficult to handle from
every aspect, for it was a talky, in
volved, and philosophical play. It
dragged in places, but due to no fault
of the medium nor to the play script
—it is the type of drama which neces
saily palls in spots, for it has a func
tional situation treatment which calls
for a detailed formation.
Verna Hannah, playing the role of
Signora Frola, did an outstanding
piece of work. At first she seemed to
have a difficulty in keeping her voice
in character, but after she warmed to
her part she played with absolute
character. She created a difficult im
pression to produce, for the audience
could see the evidence of sanity and
insanity in her characterization with
out being obviously conscious of
either. In Miss Hannah's emotional
scenes she practiced a restraint which
stressed the intensity of her work
without losing the poise necessary to
her part.
Murphy Adds Strength
Irvin Murphy, as Ponza, was the
first one to catch the tempo of the
play. Until his entrance there was no
definite rhythm noticeable, but after
he had introduced this necessary at
tribute it was carried throughout the
play. There was nothing subtle in
Murphy's acting—it was all positive
and clear-cut. The vitality of his play
ing and the obviousness of his reac
tions made him one of the strongest
factors in determining the perform
ance's success.
Anna May Price, during her short
time on the stage, held the audience
as no other actor or actress had dur
ing the evening. She impregnated her
part with an enchanting mysterious
nesses which is seldom found on an
amateur stage. The use of her hands
was perhaps the most finished bit of
individual playing in the show.
Irving Rosenblatt did a good piece
of work. He was inclined to orate in
places, but he caught the characteriza
tion and gave the audience a perfect
awareness of the connotation of his
lines. His gestures were a little awk
ward and few; however, they typified
his part. Rosenblatt played his part
with a smoothness despite all this,
and was able to get over his vitality
without ruffling the smoothness. His
work was strong and he did not lose
his character once during the entire
performance. His reactions were the
best and most consistent of the show.
Like Murphy, Rosenblatt held the rest
of the cast to the tempo of the drama.
Volland Striking
Virginia Volland was striking in
her part. Her voice was beyond criti
cisms and her control over It is pro
fessional. There is an ease about her
playing that leads to a pleasing na
turalness.
Dick Fisher looked and acted the
character that he was portraying to
perfection. His voice has improved
greatly since his last performance in
"The Queen's Husband." He blended
his voice, gestures, and appearance
into a finish characterization.
Carol Wynn played his part in a
very satisfactory manner. Wynn acted
with enthusiasm which he transmitted
to the audience. There is a freshness
about his work which pleases those
who witness it.
Louise Wilson, who played the in
genue, was inclined to pose, but did
her part adequately. Edwina Ewing
had a slightly childish tendency in the
use of her feet and a slight gasp was

noticeable in her voice, but her re
actions were of the finest. Anne
Mudge did a perfect character part—
her work and make-up was ridiculous
ly funny.
Clyde in Unique Role
Paul Clyde as the Police Commis
sioner was perfect. It was the first
time that I have ever witnessed a
mustache really quiver with indigna
tion. He and Irving Rosenblatt as
Prince of Greek in "The Queen's Hus
band" vie for the honors of creating
the most amusing characterization of
this season.
Virgil Anderson, as Centuri, played
his part most convincingly. Marguer
ite Louise did her bit in a pleasing
manner. Robert Steffens, John Jago,
and Herman Salinger did their small
parts well.
The set was unusually good. Helven
ston caught the spirit and the atmos
phere of the play. His set added ma
terially to the show. The realist set
was one which was startlingly con
crete in appearance. There was not
one criticism to be made of it. Hel
venston has done three sets this quar
ter —all different —and this one proves
that he can do realistic work and
show the same talent.
Luigi Pirandello's play, "Right You
Are If You Think You Are," was the
finest production which Gordon Davis
has put on this quarter. It was also
the most difficult to handle from
every aspect, for it was a talky, in
volved, and philosophical play. It
dragged in places, but due to no fault
of the medium nor to the play script

saily palls in spots, for it has a func
tional situation treatment which calls
for a detailed formation.
Verna Hannah, playing the role of
Signora Frola, did an outstanding
piece of work. At first she seemed to
have a difficulty in keeping her voice
in character, but after she warmed to
her part she played with absolute
character. She created a difficult im
pression to produce, for the audience
could see the evidence of sanity and
insanity in her characterization with
out being obviously conscious of
either. In Miss Hannah's emotional
scenes she practiced a restraint which
stressed the intensity of her work
without losing the poise necessary to
her part.
Murphy Adds Strength
Irvin Murphy, as Ponza, was the
first one to catch the tempo of the
play. Until his entrance there was no
definite rhythm noticeable, but after
he had introduced this necessary at
tribute it was carried throughout the
play. There was nothing subtle in
Murphy's acting—it was all positive
and clear-cut. The vitality of his play
ing and the obviousness of his reac
tions made him one of the strongest
factors in determining the perform
ance's success.
Anna May Price, during her short
time on the stage, held the audience
as no other actor or actress had dur
ing the evening. She impregnated her
part with an enchanting mysterious
nesses which is seldom found on an
amateur stage. The use of her hands
was perhaps the most finished bit of
individual playing in the show.
Irving Rosenblatt did a good piece
of work. He was inclined to orate in
places, but he caught the characteriza
tion and gave the audience a perfect
awareness of the connotation of his
lines. His gestures were a little awk
ward and few; however, they typified
his part. Rosenblatt played his part
with a smoothness despite all this,
and was able to get over his vitality
without ruffling the smoothness. His
work was strong and he did not lose
his character once during the entire
performance. His reactions were the
best and most consistent of the show.
Like Murphy, Rosenblatt held the rest
of the cast to the tempo of the drama.
Volland Striking
Virginia Volland was striking in
her part. Her voice was beyond criti
cisms and her control over It is pro
fessional. There is an ease about her
playing that leads to a pleasing na
turalness.
Dick Fisher looked and acted the
character that he was portraying to
perfection. His voice has improved
greatly since his last performance in
"The Queen's Husband." He blended
his voice, gestures, and appearance
into a finish characterization.
Carol Wynn played his part in a
very satisfactory manner. Wynn acted
with enthusiasm which he transmitted
to the audience. There is a freshness
about his work which pleases those
who witness it.
Louise Wilson, who played the in
genue, was inclined to pose, but did
her part adequately. Edwina Ewing
had a slightly childish tendency in the
use of her feet and a slight gasp was

noticeable in her voice, but her re
actions were of the finest. Anne
Mudge did a perfect character part—
her work and make-up was ridiculous
ly funny.
Clyde in Unique Role
Paul Clyde as the Police Commis
sioner was perfect. It was the first
time that I have ever witnessed a
mustache really quiver with indigna
tion. He and Irving Rosenblatt as
Prince of Greek in "The Queen's Hus
band" vie for the honors of creating
the most amusing characterization of
this season.
Virgil Anderson, as Centuri, played
his part most convincingly. Marguer
ite Louise did her bit in a pleasing
manner. Robert Steffens, John Jago,
and Herman Salinger did their small
parts well.
The set was unusually good. Helven
ston caught the spirit and the atmos
phere of the play. His set added ma
terially to the show. The realist set
was one which was startlingly con
crete in appearance. There was not
one criticism to be made of it. Hel
venston has done three sets this quar
ter —all different —and this one proves
that he can do realistic work and
show the same talent.
Luigi Pirandello's play, "Right You
Are If You Think You Are," was the
finest production which Gordon Davis
has put on this quarter. It was also
the most difficult to handle from
every aspect, for it was a talky, in
volved, and philosophical play. It
dragged in places, but due to no fault
of the medium nor to the play script
—it is the type of drama which neces
saily palls in spots, for it has a func
tional situation treatment which calls
for a detailed formation.
