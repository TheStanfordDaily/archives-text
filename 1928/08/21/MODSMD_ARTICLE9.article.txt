# PIRANDELLO'S ITALIAN PLAY HELD SUCCESS
## Helvenston's Realistic Set Creates Atmosphere, Spirit in Drama 
### Laird Doyle 
Luigi Pirandello's play, "Right You
Are If You Think You Are," was the
finest production which Gordon Davis
has put on this quarter. It was also
the most difficult to handle from
every aspect, for it was a talky, in
volved, and philosophical play. It
dragged in places, but due to no fault
of the medium nor to the play script
—it is the type of drama which neces
saily palls in spots, for it has a func
tional situation treatment which calls
for a detailed formation.
Verna Hannah, playing the role of
Signora Frola, did an outstanding
piece of work. At first she seemed to
have a difficulty in keeping her voice
in character, but after she warmed to
her part she played with absolute
character. She created a difficult im
pression to produce, for the audience
could see the evidence of sanity and
insanity in her characterization with
out being obviously conscious of
either. In Miss Hannah's emotional
scenes she practiced a restraint which
stressed the intensity of her work
without losing the poise necessary to
her part.
Murphy Adds Strength
Irvin Murphy, as Ponza, was the
first one to catch the tempo of the
play. Until his entrance there was no
definite rhythm noticeable, but after
he had introduced this necessary at
tribute it was carried throughout the
play. There was nothing subtle in
Murphy's acting—it was all positive
and clear-cut. The vitality of his play
ing and the obviousness of his reac
tions made him one of the strongest
factors in determining the perform
ance's success.
Anna May Price, during her short
time on the stage, held the audience
