The great
grand-daddy
of your Fish
Brand Slicker
IT was made in 1836--a husky
piece of oilskin built to fit the
broad back of a Grand Banks
fisherman.
The modern descendants of
these old-time slickers are col
lege bred, sophisticated. But
under their stylish exterior is
the old, dependable stuff.
The "Varsity" model is big
and roomy, keeps your legs dry
right down to the ankles. Your
choice of colors and styles—but
tons or buckles —strap-collar or
plain.
