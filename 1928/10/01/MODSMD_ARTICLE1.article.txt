# WINGED "O" TRIUMPHANT OVER CARDS; SCORE 12-6
## Fumbles, Penalties Prove Disastrous in Second Period; Cardinals Lose Lead 
### Carroll O'Meara 
Pop Warner was pessimistic as to
his team's chances against the Olym
pic Club eleven Saturday. A glance
back at the results reveals that the
Old Fox's pessimism was fully justi
fied, for in addition to losing the
game by a 12-6 score, the Cardinals
have indefinitely lost the services of
Johnny Preston, stellar end whose
left forearm was fractured in the con
flict. Other injuries to Stanford play
ers are reported not as serious as
they were at first thought to be.
Frank Wilton, the little halfback
whose name was heard so frequently
from the new loudspeakers, was
scheduled last night to leave the hos
pital where he was treated for leg
injuries. Pop believes that Frank Wil
ton will be available for the game
with Oregon next Saturday at Eugene.
Both Biff Hoffman and Bill Clark have
recovered from their severe shakeups
received under similar circumstances.
Other players are badly bruised.
Cards Start Strong
At the start of Saturday's contest
the Cards gave promise of dispelling
the traditional early season gloom.
Stanford was the offensive team for
the entire first half, consistently
keeping the ball in Winged "O" ter
ritory. Time and again the Cards
plunged through the Club's veteran
line. Then came the famous Hoffman
to-Wilton pass, netting twenty-eight
yards. Three plays followed and Stan
ford scored with Hoffman carrying
the ball. Biff failed to convert.
Warner's men threatened again in
the second quarter, driving the ball
within two yards of the goal. A pen
alty for "backfield in motion" proved
disastrous. The score at the half was
6-0.
Winged "O" Stiffens
The Olympics made their strength
evident in the third quarter—the bad
news period for Stanford fans. The
Club's interference seemed reorgan
ized; its line suddenly toughened.
The whole team showed reserve
strength against the weakening Stan
ford eleven. In streaks Morton Kaer
shone as he did during his career at
S.C. A long pass from Kaer to Ford
netted the visitors their first score.
Allen's kick hit the crossbar and
bounced backwards.
A few minutes later Kaer scored
on a spectacular 68-yard run. After
receiving Hoffman's punt he reversed
his field, and his interference follow
ing suit allowed him to cross the line
without even being dangerously
threatened by a tackier. Again the
Club failed to convert. The score re
mained at 12-6, favoring the Olympics.
Stanford took the ball again but
lost it when Hoffman fumbled in a
temporary daze after a hard tackle.
A few minutes "before the game ended,
Bill Clark ran twenty-eight yards and
nearly scored after receiving the ball
on a triple pass. He was downed near
the Olympic goal and lost the ball
when he was tackled, as did Captain
Biff in the preceding quarter. Warner
came on the field to protest that the
ball was taken from Clark after he
was tackled. The referee ruled other
wise.
The statistical figures favor Stan
ford two-to-one even in the matter of
penalties. The Cards made ten first
downs to their opponents' five. The
Cards fumbled six times, the Club
three times. Stanford lost sixty-five
yards in penalties while the Olympics
lost thirty yards. Stanford completed
fourteen out of twenty-nine passes.
The Club threw eight passes, com
pleting only two.

the ball. Biff failed to convert.
Warner's men threatened again in
the second quarter, driving the ball
within two yards of the goal. A pen
alty for "backfield in motion" proved
disastrous. The score at the half was
6-0.
Winged "O" Stiffens
The Olympics made their strength
evident in the third quarter—the bad
news period for Stanford fans. The
Club's interference seemed reorgan
ized; its line suddenly toughened.
The whole team showed reserve
strength against the weakening Stan
ford eleven. In streaks Morton Kaer
shone as he did during his career at
S.C. A long pass from Kaer to Ford
netted the visitors their first score.
Allen's kick hit the crossbar and
bounced backwards.
A few minutes later Kaer scored
on a spectacular 68-yard run. After
receiving Hoffman's punt he reversed
his field, and his interference follow
ing suit allowed him to cross the line
without even being dangerously
threatened by a tackier. Again the
Club failed to convert. The score re
mained at 12-6, favoring the Olympics.
Stanford took the ball again but
lost it when Hoffman fumbled in a
temporary daze after a hard tackle.
A few minutes "before the game ended,
Bill Clark ran twenty-eight yards and
nearly scored after receiving the ball
on a triple pass. He was downed near
the Olympic goal and lost the ball
when he was tackled, as did Captain
Biff in the preceding quarter. Warner
came on the field to protest that the
ball was taken from Clark after he
was tackled. The referee ruled other
wise.
The statistical figures favor Stan
ford two-to-one even in the matter of
penalties. The Cards made ten first
downs to their opponents' five. The
Cards fumbled six times, the Club
three times. Stanford lost sixty-five
yards in penalties while the Olympics
lost thirty yards. Stanford completed
fourteen out of twenty-nine passes.
The Club threw eight passes, com
pleting only two.
Pop Warner was pessimistic as to
his team's chances against the Olym
pic Club eleven Saturday. A glance
back at the results reveals that the
Old Fox's pessimism was fully justi
fied, for in addition to losing the
game by a 12-6 score, the Cardinals
have indefinitely lost the services of
Johnny Preston, stellar end whose
left forearm was fractured in the con
flict. Other injuries to Stanford play
ers are reported not as serious as
they were at first thought to be.
Frank Wilton, the little halfback
whose name was heard so frequently
from the new loudspeakers, was
scheduled last night to leave the hos
pital where he was treated for leg
injuries. Pop believes that Frank Wil
ton will be available for the game
with Oregon next Saturday at Eugene.
Both Biff Hoffman and Bill Clark have
recovered from their severe shakeups
received under similar circumstances.
Other players are badly bruised.
Cards Start Strong
At the start of Saturday's contest
the Cards gave promise of dispelling
the traditional early season gloom.
Stanford was the offensive team for
the entire first half, consistently
keeping the ball in Winged "O" ter
ritory. Time and again the Cards
plunged through the Club's veteran
line. Then came the famous Hoffman
to-Wilton pass, netting twenty-eight
yards. Three plays followed and Stan
ford scored with Hoffman carrying
the ball. Biff failed to convert.
Warner's men threatened again in
the second quarter, driving the ball
within two yards of the goal. A pen
alty for "backfield in motion" proved
disastrous. The score at the half was
