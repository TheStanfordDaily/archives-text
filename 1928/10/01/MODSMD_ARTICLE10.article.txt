# WILBUR APPEALS FOR PASSAGE OF PARK AMENDMENT
## 
### 
Will California stand aside and let
i private interests exploit her unsur
j passed scenery and her numerous
; sites of historic interest and charm?
i This was the subject of a plea to the
j people of California to vote "Yes" on
| the state park bond issue, to appear
lon the ballot as Amendment Four,
i made of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, presi
dent of Stanford University and mem
! ber of the state park commission,
I Thursday evening when he spoke be
! fore the microphone at the studio of
KQW, San Jose.
Dr. Wilbur told of what is happen
ing to the most valuable spots of
beauty and historical interest and of
the effort, represented by the state
park bond issue, to arrest this de
struction before it is too late.
"California," to many, means a play
groundâ€”a place to be carefree and
happy and in which to regain the lost
buoyancy of body and of spirit, Dr.
Wilbur said. Because of the increase
in population at a rate of about
250,000 people a year, new conditions
have arisen and must be properly
solved. Dr. Wilbur explained that our
streams are being used for irrigation
and power; our beauty spots are at
tracting home-builders.
Governor Young has appointed a
new state park commission which will
have in its hands the task of formu
lating a park policy for the state.
Under its direction will be carried
out the State Park Survey.
The passage of Amendment Four
on November 6 will provide for a
sum of $6,000,000, which when
matched by an equal sum in private
donations, will be used to insure the
recreational future of California. Ac
cording to Dr. Wilbur, this increased
taxation will amount to only four
cents per person a year.
