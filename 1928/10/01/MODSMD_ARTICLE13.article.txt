# DELEGATES FROM JUNIOR COLLEGES MEET ON CAMPUS
## University Acts as Host at Organization Meeting Of Association 
### 
Stanford's interest in the junior
college movement was indicated by
its acting as host Saturday at the or
ganization meeting of the Northern
California Junior College Association.
More than fifty delegates represent
ing twenty-one junior colleges assem
bled to discuss informally the growth
of these institutions and to formulate
an organization of the junior colleges
in the northern portion of the state.
A similar association already exists in
southern California.
Wilbur Addresses Meeting
President Wilbur, in his speech to
the representatives at their luncheon
meeting, said, "The great increase of
population has been responsible for
the rapid and sound growth of the
junior college system." He stated that
large classes, and large and crowded
institutions of higher learning must go
by the board. Talking on the basic
elements of elementary education, he
listed as essential a reading and
speaking knowledge of American
language and literature, a knowledge
of American citizenship, contact with
laboratory subjects where the student
must find the facts out for himself,
and the ability of knowing how to use
a library intelligently.
These the junior colleges are better
able to do than are universities, he
believes, as the former "should be a
trying-out place for boys and girls
in their teens for testing their desire
and their ability for going on with
their education and specializing in
some profession."
Stanford Pro*, ssorp. Speak
William M. Proctor, professor of j
education, and John P. Mitchell, regis
trar, all of Stanford spoke before the
delegates.
Discussing "Prediction of the Jun
ior College Population for 1940," Pro
fessor Eells holds that the junior col
leges will have approximately twice
the number of registered students in
1940 as are now enrolled in them. One
factor in his conclusion is that the
state of California in 1940 will have }
a population of more than six million
where it now numbers more than four
million.
