# STUDENT BOARDS CONTROL TRAFFIC LAWS ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
Although the Stanford campus auto
traffic is not regulated by the Palo
Alto police department, both new and
old students will find themselves in
the uncomfortable toils of the law if
they follow a speed urge to "step on
the gas."
After a series of controversies, stu
dent control of automobile traffic on
the campus became operative on De
cember 1, 1927. Authority to try stu
dent offenders and to fix penalties
was delegated to the Councils by
Comptroller Roth.
Following is a partial list of the
schedule of campus speed and traffic
regulations which are now in effect:
Twenty miles per hour along the
Row, in the residential district, and
on areas adjoining quadrangle, halls,
and gymnasiums.
Fifteen miles per hour at all dan
gerous intersections.
Forty miles per hour on University
Avenue, except at crossings.
Driving with open mufflers is pro
hibited, as well as unnecessary sound
ing of horns, and any reckless driv
ing. ,
