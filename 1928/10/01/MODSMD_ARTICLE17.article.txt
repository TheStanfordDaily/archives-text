## 
### 
Frank Lombardi, star sprinter from
L.A. High School, and Akeley Quirk
were ohospn by the Class of 19.'!2 last
night as leaders in the tie-up between
the freshman and sophomore classes.
Thursday, October 4, is the tenta
tive day set by the Executive Com
mittee. The contest is scheduled to
start promptly at three o'clock, and
will last fifteen minutes. Though the
stadium was chosen as the scene of
action, the light may be staged 011
another football field. The Executive
Committee will definitely decide on
the battle ground at a meeting on
Tuesday night.
Mud Fight Abolished
The tie-up was reinstated as the
annual class rush last January after
continued discussion. Prior to 1923
the two classes went through poster
fights, hazing, tie-ups, and numerous
other assorted clashes. Then they
were replaced by the mud fighl on the
dry bed of Lagunita. This year the
Ex Committee abolished the fight.
Last year's fight was late in starting
and dragged out indefinitely. Poor
sportsmanship and violation of rules
also contributed to making the fray
a failure.
Block "S" men will manage the
tie-up and the rules will be rigidly
enforced. The captains of the major
sports and the student body president
will judge.
Freshmen Buy Rope
The freshmen are to buy the rope,
which will be of soft cotton cut in
three-foot strips. Conquered contest
ants must be tied hand and foot and
taken to the end of the field where
they will be marked with paint to
indicate elimination from the contest.
The class having the largest number
of men on the field at the end of
fifteen minutes will be declared the
winner.
Slugging and unfair play of any
sort will not be tolerated and any
violation of the rules may cause the
abolition of a class rush of any sort.
