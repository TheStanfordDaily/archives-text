# NEWCOMERS GIVEN RIGID EXAMINATION
## Staff of Forty Co-operates With Dr. T. A. Storey In New System 
### 
Instituting a more thorough and
! rigid physical examination of new
I Stanford students, Dr. Thomas A.
Storey, medical adviser of men, and
a staff of 40 assistants have been at
work during the past two weeks
examining more than 700 entrants.
A new system of examination is being
used this year. It is the desire of the
medical advisorial department to in
form every Stanford student with a
scientifically correct diagnosis of his
physical condition.
Fourteen rooms in the Administra
tion Building of the Board of Athletic
Control are being used during this
j analysis of student health conditions.
Commencing on September 17 when
j 170 candidates for varsity and fresh
j man football squads received their
: physical examinations, Dr. Storey and
! his staff have been busily engaged
! since. An individual record is made
; out by each student being examined,
i The tests include ear, nose, throat,
! teeth, vision, skin, bones, joints, blood
| pressure, heart, lungs, and abdomen,
j A record of height and weight is
I made.
Forty professional men from San
Francisco and this region are doftat
ing their services to assist Dr. Storey
and his staff in these examinations.
It is the desire of the department to
demonstrate to the individual student
methods of scientific health examina
tion, and also to establish confidence
and understanding between the stu
dent and his health advisers in these
prematriculation health examinations.
Various up-to-the-minute devices
have been installed by Dr. Storey to
facilitate handling the large number
of students being examined, and also
to enable the examinations to be car
ried on in the most scientific meth
ods. A special dark room is being
used for the ear, eye, nose, and throat
tests. An accurate system of charts
is being used to determine color
blindness. More people are unable to
distinguish red and green than any
other color, Dr. Storey explained. One
set of cards that is being used cannot
be read unless a student is color
blind.
Even in sterilizing and washing the
examiner's hands the latest of de
vices, a foot control, is used. This
makes it possible for a physician to
thoroughly clean his hands without
having to come in contact with the
handle of the faucet.
According to Dr. Storey, the first
examination is to be a rapid, expert,
objective test; while the last will be
a more leisurely one. The first exami
nations are scheduled to be completed
at 4 o'clock Wednesday afternoon.

blindness. More people are unable to
distinguish red and green than any
other color, Dr. Storey explained. One
set of cards that is being used cannot
be read unless a student is color
blind.
Even in sterilizing and washing the
examiner's hands the latest of de
vices, a foot control, is used. This
makes it possible for a physician to
thoroughly clean his hands without
having to come in contact with the
handle of the faucet.
According to Dr. Storey, the first
examination is to be a rapid, expert,
objective test; while the last will be
a more leisurely one. The first exami
nations are scheduled to be completed
at 4 o'clock Wednesday afternoon.
Instituting a more thorough and
! rigid physical examination of new
I Stanford students, Dr. Thomas A.
Storey, medical adviser of men, and
a staff of 40 assistants have been at
work during the past two weeks
examining more than 700 entrants.
A new system of examination is being
used this year. It is the desire of the
medical advisorial department to in
form every Stanford student with a
scientifically correct diagnosis of his
physical condition.
Fourteen rooms in the Administra
tion Building of the Board of Athletic
Control are being used during this
j analysis of student health conditions.
Commencing on September 17 when
j 170 candidates for varsity and fresh
j man football squads received their
: physical examinations, Dr. Storey and
! his staff have been busily engaged
! since. An individual record is made
; out by each student being examined,
i The tests include ear, nose, throat,
! teeth, vision, skin, bones, joints, blood
| pressure, heart, lungs, and abdomen,
j A record of height and weight is
I made.
Forty professional men from San
Francisco and this region are doftat
ing their services to assist Dr. Storey
and his staff in these examinations.
It is the desire of the department to
demonstrate to the individual student
methods of scientific health examina
tion, and also to establish confidence
and understanding between the stu
dent and his health advisers in these
prematriculation health examinations.
Various up-to-the-minute devices
have been installed by Dr. Storey to
facilitate handling the large number
of students being examined, and also
to enable the examinations to be car
ried on in the most scientific meth
ods. A special dark room is being
used for the ear, eye, nose, and throat
tests. An accurate system of charts
is being used to determine color
blindness. More people are unable to
distinguish red and green than any
other color, Dr. Storey explained. One
