# QUARTERLY TUITION IS RAISED THREE DOLLARS BY UNIVERSITY
## Board Of Trustees Grants Increase; Student Guild Fund Gets Money For Expansion Of Health, Hospitalization Service 
### 
An increase of three dollars in quarterly tuition charges was granted
by the Board of Trustees during the past summer and will be exacted
of all students henceforth.
The boost to $99 for undergraduates and to $98 for graduates was
made in order to properly meet the costs of the student hospitalization
service, carried on both at the L'alo Alto Hospital and at the Isolation
Hospital, and also to provide for an expanded student health service.
The increase goes to the Student Guild Fund, which formerly received $2

pof the quarterly tuition, and which
will henceforth receive $5.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, head of the
department of physical education and
hygiene for men, is credited with liav
i ing initiated the project for the $9
annual increase in the tuition, or,
more properly speaking, incidental
fees. Roughly, about 700 students will
benefit directly from the increase this
fall, for thorough physical examina
tions have been and will continue to
be given this group.
Athletes Examined
Already, considerable has been
done in expanding the health service
for men. The entire football squad,
both varsity and freshman, was on
September 17, thoroughly examined
physically. Last Friday, about 130
freshmen who had come to the cam
pus for the aptitude test were exam
ined, and today the remainder of this
year's 350-man freshman class and
other new men in the Lower Division
will be inspected. Tomorrow, new
members of the Upper Division and
new graduate men will undergo ex
amination.
The increased fee has made pos
sible the securing of full-time services
of Dr. Harry Beal Torrey and the
half-time services of Doctors 11. L.
Niebel, D. T. Lundquist, and E. Liston
of Palo Alto.

Expansion of activities in the office
of Dr. Clelia Duel Mosher, medical
advisor of women, will result in three
things: the making available of diag
nostic privileges for cases which Dr.
Mosher decides need special exam
ination; the building up of the Stu
dent Guild fund, following its deple
tion (largely by women) during the
poliomyelitis epidemic last spring;
and the employment of a public health
nurse to follow up cases and deter
mine causes for poor health.
Almost fifty physicians are giving
their services in the men's examina
tion work this week. A majority of
the examiners comes from San Fran
cisco, but a number come from Palo
Alto and San Jose. Eye, ear, nose,
throat, skin, dental, color vision, or
thopedic, and general medical exam
inations and urinary analyses are be
ing made by these specialists.
Staff Advice Available
Following the making of the exam
inations, students will from time to
time during the year be called in to
discuss with members of the regular
medical staff of the department their
particular health problems and meth
ods of bettering their health. Dr.
Storey hopes not only to supply stu
dents with information concerning
their health status and health needs,
but also to establish confidence and
understanding between the student
and his health advisers.
The step taken this year is the
realization of the plan Dr. Storey con
ceived on coming here in 1927.

their health status and health needs,
but also to establish confidence and
understanding between the student
and his health advisers.
The step taken this year is the
realization of the plan Dr. Storey con
ceived on coming here in 1927.
An increase of three dollars in quarterly tuition charges was granted
by the Board of Trustees during the past summer and will be exacted
of all students henceforth.
The boost to $99 for undergraduates and to $98 for graduates was
made in order to properly meet the costs of the student hospitalization
service, carried on both at the L'alo Alto Hospital and at the Isolation
Hospital, and also to provide for an expanded student health service.
The increase goes to the Student Guild Fund, which formerly received $2

pof the quarterly tuition, and which
will henceforth receive $5.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, head of the
department of physical education and
hygiene for men, is credited with liav
i ing initiated the project for the $9
annual increase in the tuition, or,
more properly speaking, incidental
fees. Roughly, about 700 students will
benefit directly from the increase this
fall, for thorough physical examina
tions have been and will continue to
be given this group.
Athletes Examined
Already, considerable has been
done in expanding the health service
for men. The entire football squad,
both varsity and freshman, was on
September 17, thoroughly examined
physically. Last Friday, about 130
freshmen who had come to the cam
pus for the aptitude test were exam
ined, and today the remainder of this
year's 350-man freshman class and
other new men in the Lower Division
will be inspected. Tomorrow, new
members of the Upper Division and
new graduate men will undergo ex
amination.
The increased fee has made pos
sible the securing of full-time services
of Dr. Harry Beal Torrey and the
half-time services of Doctors 11. L.
Niebel, D. T. Lundquist, and E. Liston
of Palo Alto.

Expansion of activities in the office
of Dr. Clelia Duel Mosher, medical
advisor of women, will result in three
things: the making available of diag
nostic privileges for cases which Dr.
Mosher decides need special exam
ination; the building up of the Stu
dent Guild fund, following its deple
tion (largely by women) during the
poliomyelitis epidemic last spring;
and the employment of a public health
nurse to follow up cases and deter
mine causes for poor health.
Almost fifty physicians are giving
their services in the men's examina
tion work this week. A majority of
the examiners comes from San Fran
cisco, but a number come from Palo
Alto and San Jose. Eye, ear, nose,
throat, skin, dental, color vision, or
thopedic, and general medical exam
inations and urinary analyses are be
ing made by these specialists.
Staff Advice Available
Following the making of the exam
inations, students will from time to
time during the year be called in to
discuss with members of the regular
medical staff of the department their
particular health problems and meth
ods of bettering their health. Dr.
Storey hopes not only to supply stu
dents with information concerning
their health status and health needs,
but also to establish confidence and
understanding between the student
and his health advisers.
