# Take This And Be Thankful

Hazing is no more at Stanford, having been abolished five years ago.
Accordingly, any student here is free to do as he wants, so long as he
behaves intelligently; no longer do infantile sophomores continually lurk
about to duck him in a horse trough upon the least provocation.
You who are entering freshmen ought to fall upon your prayer bones
and give thanks that you have arrived of college age and been admitted
to the University during these halcyon years coming between the aboli
tion of hazing and the abolition of the Lower Division. This is (with a
few silent reservations) an excellent college in a healthy environment,
and there are no Stanford men or women who arc not proud of it.
And so all who enter here, particularly freshmen, are welcomed by
this official organ of the Associated Students. There are a number of
traditions and customs of the place of which they should at this time
be informed.
To begin with, the students conduct their own affairs, that is to say,
both their activities and their infractions of the moral code. All of you
who have attended high school or its equivalent—and we sincerely trust
that you have —are doubtless familiar with the ways of student govern
ment of activities; at Stanford there is an inclusive number of fields
in extra-curricular affairs where you may develop in whatever direction
your bent is.
Where our system differs from your high school government is
probably in that part pertaining to honor. President Wilbur has said
that the University supposes when it grants a student his A.l». degree
that he has come by it honestly. The Registrar, when he admits students,
demands that they show recommendations setting forth their personal
qualities. Everyone is assumed to be honorable.
Under this blanket assumption, the honor system of. conducting all
examinations and classwork operates. Instructors by custom leave the
room after giving out questions for an ex. Some occasionally allow
examinations to be written at home. Now, for a freshman to fully
appreciate this system, obviously a reform of the usual high school
attitude toward examinations must be undergone by each one who
thinks it is smart business successfully to attempt cheating. Please
consider the honor system the first rule of conduct in the life of a
Stanford man or woman, and one which is never on any condition to
be forsaken.
There are other traditions which"we startd out to describe, but they
are not to be mentioned with the same seriousness with which we speak
of the honor system. Freshmen will learn the law steps tradition and
all the rest from sponsors in Encina. For the present, we shall pass
on to a
FRESHMAN CODE OF ACTION
1. Throw no water from Encina Hall windows and bannisters.
2. Dump no rubbish from the same.
3. Do not break windows, because the breaker has to pay for them.
4. Study regularly, take recreation just as regularly, and sleep
plenty.
5. Don't make a lot of noise.
6. Support your own freshman teams as well as the varsities.
7. Make many friends, but first be sure they are worth having.

and give thanks that you have arrived of college age and been admitted
to the University during these halcyon years coming between the aboli
tion of hazing and the abolition of the Lower Division. This is (with a
few silent reservations) an excellent college in a healthy environment,
and there are no Stanford men or women who arc not proud of it.
And so all who enter here, particularly freshmen, are welcomed by
this official organ of the Associated Students. There are a number of
traditions and customs of the place of which they should at this time
be informed.
To begin with, the students conduct their own affairs, that is to say,
both their activities and their infractions of the moral code. All of you
who have attended high school or its equivalent—and we sincerely trust
that you have —are doubtless familiar with the ways of student govern
ment of activities; at Stanford there is an inclusive number of fields
in extra-curricular affairs where you may develop in whatever direction
your bent is.
Where our system differs from your high school government is
probably in that part pertaining to honor. President Wilbur has said
that the University supposes when it grants a student his A.l». degree
that he has come by it honestly. The Registrar, when he admits students,
demands that they show recommendations setting forth their personal
qualities. Everyone is assumed to be honorable.
Under this blanket assumption, the honor system of. conducting all
examinations and classwork operates. Instructors by custom leave the
room after giving out questions for an ex. Some occasionally allow
examinations to be written at home. Now, for a freshman to fully
appreciate this system, obviously a reform of the usual high school
attitude toward examinations must be undergone by each one who
thinks it is smart business successfully to attempt cheating. Please
consider the honor system the first rule of conduct in the life of a
Stanford man or woman, and one which is never on any condition to
be forsaken.
There are other traditions which"we startd out to describe, but they
are not to be mentioned with the same seriousness with which we speak
of the honor system. Freshmen will learn the law steps tradition and
all the rest from sponsors in Encina. For the present, we shall pass
on to a
FRESHMAN CODE OF ACTION
1. Throw no water from Encina Hall windows and bannisters.
2. Dump no rubbish from the same.
3. Do not break windows, because the breaker has to pay for them.
4. Study regularly, take recreation just as regularly, and sleep
plenty.
5. Don't make a lot of noise.
6. Support your own freshman teams as well as the varsities.
7. Make many friends, but first be sure they are worth having.
8. Read the Daily (including the editorial page).
Hazing is no more at Stanford, having been abolished five years ago.
Accordingly, any student here is free to do as he wants, so long as he
behaves intelligently; no longer do infantile sophomores continually lurk
about to duck him in a horse trough upon the least provocation.
You who are entering freshmen ought to fall upon your prayer bones
and give thanks that you have arrived of college age and been admitted
to the University during these halcyon years coming between the aboli
tion of hazing and the abolition of the Lower Division. This is (with a
few silent reservations) an excellent college in a healthy environment,
