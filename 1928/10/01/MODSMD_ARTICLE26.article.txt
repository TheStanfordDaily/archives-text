Something ought to be said about this being the first issue of Volume
74. Nothing exciting about that to the reader, but to the Daily minions
it means that the grind has started again.
Thanks to Comptroller A. E. Roth and to Roy Button, superintendent
of the Corporation Yard, the Daily office has been remodelled during
the summer and new desks and lights installed. New equipment has
been bought by the open-handed business manager, and indeed every
thing is so lovely that it will become almost a pleasure to produce this
diurnal news ration.
