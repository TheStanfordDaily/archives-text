# Outstanding Events Of Freshman Year Are Outlined For Class of '32
## 
### 
Today the class of 1932 begins its
career in the University with the regis
tration of all freshmen. Before this
class graduates many events will have
been put behind them, but probably
no year will stand out so much or be
nearly as memorable as the year
spent in Encina and Roble halls.
The first event in which the class
will participate is the tie-up Thurs
day afternoon. This date is tentative.
Up to this year this annual titanic
struggle between the Freshman and
Sophomore classes has always been
in a mudfight, but the Executive Com
mittee last year decided that a tie-up
should replace it. The tie-up will be
staged in much the same manner ex
cept that the opposing sides will tie
up their victims and pile them to one
side instead of tossing them into a
muddy pool. The side who has the
most victims tied within a specified
time wins the contest.
On November 1, the class will hold
its annual pajamarino. This comes
the Thursday before the S.C. game.
Immediately after dinner all fresh
men will gather in front of Encina
and march over to Roble clad in
pajamas. Upon their arrival they will
give theiV version of a real football
rally with the Roble inmates as an
audience.
November 21, the Wednesday night
preceding the Big Game, will probably
remain a memorable date to mem
bers of the class of '32 for on that
night they will see the labor of past
weeks go up in flames. They will see

California's funeral pyre put to de
struction.
Soon after the opening of the win
ter quarter the first-year women will
be the guests of the sororities on the
campus. For several weeks they will
enjoy the hospitality of the women
on the Row. All too soon will come
the day of pledging, and while their
hosts await results with anxiety, the
freshman women will attempt to
reach the big decision.
Then about the third week of spring
quarter the fraternity rushing season
begins and the members of the class
of '32 will find themselves enjoying a
new experience. With the fraternities
as hosts the freshmen will be en
throned for almost a month's time
while the rush for nuggets goes mer
rily on.
One of the noteworthy events of
the year and one of the many in
which (he whole University partici
pates, is the annual Convalescent
Home drive in the early part of May.
On the afternoon of this day the stu
dent body moves en masse to the
grounds of the Convalescent Home
which is located northwest of the
Quad, bordering on San Francisquito
creek. There the men proceed to clear
the grounds, while the women enter
tain the children confined within.
After the work is done a barbecue is
held, ending a successful afternoon.
In addition to the few outstanding
events mentioned, the Encina and
Roble Clubs hold dances periodically
and in this way help to keep up the
social life of the class.
