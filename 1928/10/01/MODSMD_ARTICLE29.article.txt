# CHOIR ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR FALL SEASON TRYOUTS
## 
### 
Tryouts for the University Choir
will be held every morning during
registration week at the office of the
organist in Room 84.
Another interesting choral season
is in prospect and the choir will be
expected to maintain the high stand
ards set last year. Expressions of ap
preciation came from all parts of the
Pacific Coast when the choir sang
from the studio of the National Broad
casting Company, last June, and those
who were privileged to participate in
the joint oratorio performance with
the Temple Emanu-el Choir, will
never forget the experience.
Some of the interesting things
planned for the music of the church
for this quarter include a Schubert
Memorial Service on Sunday evening,
November 18. A Schubert program
will be rendered in observance of the
one hundredth anniversary of the
death of the great master. On Sunday
evening, December 16, the last Sun
day of the quarter, the Christmas
season will be observed with a re
vival of Horatio Parker's beautiful
"Dream of Mary." This work is a
combination of the mediaeval mystery
play and oratorio. It was given in the
church in December 1921 and many
requests have since been made for
its repetition.
The choir will again seek to excel
in a repertoire of unaccompanied an
thems, a type of music best suited
for the Memorial Church.
Mr. Allen desires particularly that
all members of the community who
have ever sung in the choir be pres
ent on Matriculation Sunday, Oct. 14,
and for the rehearsals previous. Those
unable to make a morning appoint
ment may apply for admission at the
Thursday evening rehearsal.
