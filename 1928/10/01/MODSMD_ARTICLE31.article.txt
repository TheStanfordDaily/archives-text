# WHITMORE ASKS POLO PLAYERS TO TURN OUT
## 
### 
Polo players on the "A" squad are
asked by Lieut. Charles S. Whitmore
to report for practice at 3 o'clock
Wednesday. "B" squad men should
turn out at the same time on Thurs

day. Twelve men will be chosen for |
the varsity team, and about twenty j
more can turn out with the other
squads.
Only two lettermen are returning
this quarter, McDougall and Moss
man. However, Lieut. Whitmore be
lieves that with these men as a nu
cleus, he can build up a creditably

strong team by spring.
Fifteen new horses have been sent
here by the government to replace
those lost or condemned last year.
There is *some promising material
among the lot which may be trained
into shape this season. Another item
of interest to polo enthusiasts is the
new practice cage.
