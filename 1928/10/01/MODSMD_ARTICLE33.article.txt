# BUSINESS STAFF OF DAILY OPENS TRYOUTS TODAY
## 
### 
Sophomores interested in going out
for one of the most interesting activi
ties —and one which in addition is re
munerative —are urged to try out for
the business staff of the Daily. Try
outs start immediately, and all stu
dents who are interested should see
James Frank, business manager, in the
Daily office.
After about two weeks the try
outees showing the greatest ability
will be appointed to the business
staff. Work for the first quarter will
consist chiefly of collecting advertis
ing copy, and during the second and
third quarters of soliciting and mer
chandising work. This work will pro
vide interesting contacts and ex
perience in three distinct fields —Palo
Alto, San Francisco, and national ad
vertising. An effort will be made to
rotate the work so that each member
of the staff will get experience in each
of these fields.
At the beginning of their junior
year, three will be promoted to junior
manager and one to bookkeeper.
These positions carry a monthly sal
ary from fifteen to thirty dollars.
Any freshmen who are interested in
getting an additional year of experi
ence may try out, but no one will be
promoted to junior manager before
his junior year.
