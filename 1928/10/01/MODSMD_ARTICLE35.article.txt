# J.C. MEN AT DISADVANTAGE IN ATHLETICS
## Lower Division Graduates Favored Is Claim of Newly Elected Junior College Association President 
### 
"Juni , College graduates have about lialf the chance in athletics that
lower division graduates have," is the opinion of Dean R. J. Hopkins, newly
elected president of the Northern California Junior College Association, who
bases this belief on the statement of Dr. Karl M. Cowdery, Assistant Registrar.

No particular effort is being madeÂ«
to improve the J.C. man's chances in
athletics, as the matter will have to
"take care of itself. It is a matter
of system," continues Hopkins. "In
athletics, native ability will be more
of a governing factor here than it
ordinarily is in college. An exceptional
man may go as far as his talents will
carry him, but our average ability
will never improve to the Stanford
level."
"However, in social affairs and
extra-curricular activities, J.C. stu
dents have almost a better opportun
ity than regular college men. The fac
ulty gives them more social supervi
sion, not making, but molding their
affairs. At San Mateo Junior College
the students run an eight-column daily
newspaper, control their own finances,
and in this way have as varied ex
perience in two years as Stanford
men get in four years."
