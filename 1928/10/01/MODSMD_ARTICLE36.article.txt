# A.S.S.U. FORMED TO BE OFFICIAL STUDENT GROUP
## 
### 
The Stanford student body is or
ganized under the name of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford Univer
sity, which association was formed to
provide a regular method of handling
all matters delegated to student gov
ernment. All regularly enrolled, resi
dent students, graduate and under
graduate, are members, and as such
are entitled to vote, to hold any office,
and, if scholastically eligible, to repre
sent Stanford in any intercollegiate
activity.
The general legislative and execu
tive powers of the association are
vested in the executive committee,
which consists of the president, vice
president, and secretary of the Asso
ciation, one man and woman repre
sentative each from the sophomore
and junior classes, and one graduate
member. Ex-officio members who do
not have the power to vote are the
editor of the Stanford Daily, the chair
man of the Men's Council, the presi
dent of the Women's Council, and the
student manager. The executive com
mittee supervises all student body
activities and has the power to fill all
vacancies in the Association except
the offices of president and yell
leader. The committee has sole power
of awarding athletic letters, though
honorary letters may be awarded to
two men in each major sport upon
the consent of the coach, captain, and
graduate manager.
Regular elections of the A.S.S.U.
are held on the first Tuesday of No
vember, the second Tuesday in Feb
ruary, and the last Tuesday in May.
Special elections may be called by the
executive committee, and must be
called by the committee upon petition
of fifty members of the Association.
