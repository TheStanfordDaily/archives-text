# DAILY TO SPONSOR DANCE TOMORROW
## Toyon Hall Prepared For First Social Affair of Fall Quarter 
### 
The fall quarter registration
dance is being sponsored by the
Stanford Daily, and is to be held
tomorrow night from 9 to 1
o'clock at Toyon Hall. The eight
piece Brooks-Worthington orches
tra, which has been at Lake
Tahoe during the summer, will
play. Admission charge of $1.50
is payable at the door.
In order to provide funds to enter
tain a gathering of former editors
of the paper, the Daily is conducting
the registration dance tomorrow
night. Partly on account of the fact
that the Women's Clubhouse is being
renovated and partly because he
wished to do something to revive the
campus dance in popularity, Ted !
Krough, president of Toyon Club,
consented to the use of the Toyon
floor, which is considered by far the
best on the campus.
As a mark of appreciation of the
football team, which does so much to
keep the Daily's columns filled, the
editors have passed out eleven com
plimentary tickets which are to be j
given to the men who started in the ;
Olympic Club game last Saturday. I
Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Roth, Mr. and
Mrs. Alfred R. Masters, and Mr. and ;
Mrs. Don E. Liebendorfer will be j
chaperons.
