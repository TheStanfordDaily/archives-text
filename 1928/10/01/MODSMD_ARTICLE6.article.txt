# MALONEY ISSUES CALL FOR SOCCER MATERIAL
## 
### 
All freshmen who wish to try out
for soccer must sign up immediately,
says Coach Harry Maloney. Previous
experience is an asset but will not be
necessary. The freshmen play their
first game with California in little
more than a month and so must take
advantage of the first opportunity to
practice. All men who have any abil
ity are urged by Maloney to come
out for soccer because of the oppor
tunity it affords to meet other fresh
men.
