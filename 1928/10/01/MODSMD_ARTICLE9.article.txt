# GRID TICKET APPLICATIONS READY TODAY
## J. C. Irwin Issues Complete Directions for Securing Big Game Seats 
### 
Complete directions for the pur
chase of tickets for the S.C. and
California football contests were
given out yesterday by J. C. Irwin,
head of the Ticket Department.
Irwin urges every student to re
turn his Big Game Applications
immediately to make sure of get
ting seats. Rooters' tickets for
the Trojan contest will not be on
sale after this week as all tickets
that the students do not use will
go to fill the other applications
now on hand at the ticket office.
Applications for the Big Game may
be secured on Registration Day as
soon as registration is completed by
presentation of A.S.S.U. cards at the
B. of A.C. desk just outside of the
Administration Building. Irwin warns
students who have already made ap
plication for tickets as alumni not to
apply as students also as this will
only result in confusion and the can
cellation of the applications.
Sale of rooters' tickets and addi
tional tickets for the S.C. contest will
be held in the A.S.S.U. offices in the
Old Union from 2 to 5 o'clock on
Thursday and Friday afternoons of
this week. Five hundred good seats
are available for student additional
purchases and will be sold to the first
applicants.
