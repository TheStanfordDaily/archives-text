The Stanford Daily
Send it home to your folks instead of writing
a four-page letter every day. Maybe your chum
back home would like to know what Stanford is
doing. Give them all a chance to find out what
Stanford is really like by sending them the
Daily for the school year for $4.00.
Call at the Daily Office next to the Press Building and
place your home address on our mailing list
or send your subscription to
