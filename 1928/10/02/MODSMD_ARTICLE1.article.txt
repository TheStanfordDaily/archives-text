# CLUBS TO PAY FUTURE PUBLIC PHONE LOSSES
## Group Representatives Meet To Decide Course of Action for Year INSTRUMENTS STOLEN Telephone Company Refuses To Stand Any Further Fraudulent Loss 
### 
Public telephones, which were re
moved from all the halls on the campus
except Roble this summer by the Pacific
Telephone and Telegraph Company be
cause of financial losses sustained, are to
be re-installed with the provision that
each hall in which the telephones are
placed take full responsibility for all
future losses caused by fraud.
This decision was reached yesterday
afternoon at a conference attended by
representatives of Encina, Toyon, Bran
ner, Union, and Sequoia clubs, by Ernest
S. Erwin, University accountant, and by
John D. Worthington, local representa
tive of the telephone company.
Clubs to Stand Loss
Club representatives also agreed that
if losses continued to be as heavy as
when the telephone company was hand
ling the situation, all public telephones
located in the halls would be permanently
removed. If this were done it would be
impossible for anyone in the halls to
make a long distance call after 10 o'clock
without going to Palo Alto.
Last year these phones were operated
by the telephone company at a loss of
from $15 to $30 a month per phone.
The reason for these losses, according to
their representative, is that students put
in station to station long distance calls,
talk from three to five minutes, and then
hang up the receiver and refuse to an
swer when the operator calls back to
tell them the charges for the call. Some
times these calls ran as high as $10, and
being from station to station were im
possible to trace. The use of slugs
was another complaint made by the com
pany.
Telephones Stolen
Early in the summer quarter four tele
phones were stolen from different halls
on the campus. The whole telephone was
taken out and the wires cut. The com
pany was insured against the loss of the
phones but the money contained in them
ran to nearly $100.
The new telephones are to be installed
immediately as follows: two in Encina,
and one each in Toyon, Branner, Se
quoia, and the New Union.
