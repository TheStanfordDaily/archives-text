Nathan van Patten, Stanford Libra
rian, has been reappointed a member of
the Committee on Union List of Periodi
cals, and appointed a member of the
Committee on Library Co-operation with
the Hispanic Peoples of the American
Library Association, according to a re
cent announcement from the Association
Headquarters in Chicago.
The latter is one of sixty-three com
mittees which enable the American Li

sistance to library trustees, librarians,
prospective library workers, and inter
ested citizens. Library work with the
foreign born, work with the blind, hos

library legislation arc only a few of the
subjects that are studied and investi
gated by standing committees.
In addition to the work of the com
mittees, the Association is conducting re
searches on the library and adult edu
cation, library extension, and education
for librarianship.
