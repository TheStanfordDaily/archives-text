ENID, Okla., Oct. I.—(#•) —The .state
department of the Women' Christian
Temperance Union will not accept
dues from a group of Idabel Okla.,
women, who as a local chapter of the
Union adopted a resolution endorsing
the candidacy of Governor Alfred E.
Smith, it was announced today by
Mrs. Elizabeth House of Bristow, state
president.
By refusing to accept dues, Mrs.
House said, the state department will
deny recognition to the Idabel women
as a unit of the organization.
The W.C.T.U. does not consider its
endorsement of Herbert Hoover par
tisan, she said, but a continuation of
its fight for prohibition and prohibi
tion enforcement.
