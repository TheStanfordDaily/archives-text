# An Expanded Health Service
## 
### 
Make checks payable in the sum of $99.
Something new for old returning students to do on Registration
day. A three dollar increase in incidental fees has been made by the
University, and every man and woman now and henceforth will con
tribute that extra amount quarterly.
The increase is being made, according to Dr. Thomas A. Storey, who
first proposed it, for two reasons. One is, to provide a necessary addition
of money for the defrayment of hospitalization charges at the Palo Alto
and the Isolation hospitals, and the other is to provide for an "expanded
student health service."
The two dollars which was formerly being contributed each quarter
to the Student Guild fund for the partial payment of hospitalization costs
of students was insufficient to meet the heavy drains made on the fund
last spring by the poliomyelitis cases. That was one imperative reason for
the boost; but Dr. Storey's plan for a health service which should serve
the students in a way to which they have been unaccustomed was the
cause of the raising of the guild fees all the way from $2 to $5.
Three dollars per quarter means $9 a college year. What does the
student receive in return?
Those who are entering the University for the first time this quarter
arc being given thorough physical examinations by a staff of specialists
from all over the Peninsula. They will be required to take that examina
tion next year and every year hereafter. They receive a physical examina
tion which probably would cost a good deal more if they had to take it
from a doctor in private practice.
What do the old students get in return for their increased fees?
The right to go to the gym and be examined by the members of the
regular staff of the department of physical education and hygiene when
ever they please. No requirement is made that they be examined, because
it is feared that that would end in a "rumpus," to use Dr. Storey's own
word.
The Daily feels that the University should have kept the tuition down
to $96 for old students, in view of the circumstances under which the
health service is to be operated. Very few, we think, will take advantage
of the examination which is their right to have, because an examination
is bothersome, and it doesn't seem necessary to have a physical examina
tion when one is young and healthy. What the average student wants in
a health service is not diagnostic advice but treatment for such ills as
colds, boils, infections, and minor things which are likely to assail one
at any time. This sort of service the doctors at both gyms are forbidden
by the University to give. They do give it partially in spite of this, but
too often one seeking surcease is told by the gym doctor that he must go
to Palo Alto for treatment.
Ideally, the University would give the service which students want,
but practically it is said to be impossible because proper facilities aren't
available.
We fail to see, therefore, even with improved service and additional
medical help how the old student is going to realize much from the $15
he pays yearly to the guild. He should not be charged for what under
ordinary circumstances lie will not get back.
Isn't something also to be said against this business of raising tuition
and incidental fees? Education is expensive, admittedly, but if it is so,
all the more reason for applying the majority of tuition fees to the direct
cause of education. Supervision of health is very well, but we still think
a proper supervision of student health and necessary diagnosis could be
made under a less pretentious and costly system than is now being put
into operation. The San Francisco specialists donate their services at the
time of examination of the hordes in the fall—need there be a great in
crease in fees to pay for those services?
The health program seems too lavish, as it is projected. It may turn
out to be worth what it gets, and we hope it does. All we can advise the
old students to do is to take full advantage of the service, for that is what
Dr. Storey himself hopes for.

to Palo Alto for treatment.
Ideally, the University would give the service which students want,
but practically it is said to be impossible because proper facilities aren't
available.
We fail to see, therefore, even with improved service and additional
medical help how the old student is going to realize much from the $15
he pays yearly to the guild. He should not be charged for what under
ordinary circumstances lie will not get back.
Isn't something also to be said against this business of raising tuition
and incidental fees? Education is expensive, admittedly, but if it is so,
all the more reason for applying the majority of tuition fees to the direct
cause of education. Supervision of health is very well, but we still think
a proper supervision of student health and necessary diagnosis could be
made under a less pretentious and costly system than is now being put
into operation. The San Francisco specialists donate their services at the
time of examination of the hordes in the fall—need there be a great in
crease in fees to pay for those services?
The health program seems too lavish, as it is projected. It may turn
out to be worth what it gets, and we hope it does. All we can advise the
old students to do is to take full advantage of the service, for that is what
Dr. Storey himself hopes for.
Make checks payable in the sum of $99.
Something new for old returning students to do on Registration
day. A three dollar increase in incidental fees has been made by the
University, and every man and woman now and henceforth will con
tribute that extra amount quarterly.
The increase is being made, according to Dr. Thomas A. Storey, who
first proposed it, for two reasons. One is, to provide a necessary addition
of money for the defrayment of hospitalization charges at the Palo Alto
and the Isolation hospitals, and the other is to provide for an "expanded
student health service."
The two dollars which was formerly being contributed each quarter
to the Student Guild fund for the partial payment of hospitalization costs
of students was insufficient to meet the heavy drains made on the fund
last spring by the poliomyelitis cases. That was one imperative reason for
the boost; but Dr. Storey's plan for a health service which should serve
the students in a way to which they have been unaccustomed was the
cause of the raising of the guild fees all the way from $2 to $5.
Three dollars per quarter means $9 a college year. What does the
student receive in return?
Those who are entering the University for the first time this quarter
arc being given thorough physical examinations by a staff of specialists
from all over the Peninsula. They will be required to take that examina
tion next year and every year hereafter. They receive a physical examina
tion which probably would cost a good deal more if they had to take it
from a doctor in private practice.
What do the old students get in return for their increased fees?
The right to go to the gym and be examined by the members of the
regular staff of the department of physical education and hygiene when
ever they please. No requirement is made that they be examined, because
it is feared that that would end in a "rumpus," to use Dr. Storey's own
word.
The Daily feels that the University should have kept the tuition down
to $96 for old students, in view of the circumstances under which the
health service is to be operated. Very few, we think, will take advantage
of the examination which is their right to have, because an examination
is bothersome, and it doesn't seem necessary to have a physical examina
tion when one is young and healthy. What the average student wants in
a health service is not diagnostic advice but treatment for such ills as
colds, boils, infections, and minor things which are likely to assail one
at any time. This sort of service the doctors at both gyms are forbidden
by the University to give. They do give it partially in spite of this, but
too often one seeking surcease is told by the gym doctor that he must go
to Palo Alto for treatment.
