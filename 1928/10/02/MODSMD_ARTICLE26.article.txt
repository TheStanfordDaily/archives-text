and dispensing association of the country. These papers were the San ]
Francisco Chronicle and Examiner, the Palo Alto Times, and the San '
Jose Mercury-Herald. The Daily takes occasion publicly to thank the '
proprietors of each of these. ,

having an Associated Press membership was worth going after. One of ;
the chief reasons the Daily was admitted by the four above-mentioned 1
papers was that it is fairly isolated and not likely to become an adverse |
factor to business in their rightful territory. The Daily Californium has, L
we understand, tried unsuccessfully to get into the So there are j I
