# The 						Bullsession

TALKING IT OVER
In halls where new generations
mull over ideas of old generations,
under arcaded cloisters, in houses on
the dignified Row, on fog-shrouded
drives from the City, Stanford people
talk about things, recount experi
ences, discuss, peer into one another's
thoughts, become life-long friends by
means of what the American campus
calls bull sessions. That these are
subtle delvings into the quintessence
of all things, or that they are deft
proddings into the realms of all arts
and sciences, no college student be
lieves. However, most college stu
dents will agree that they are a
means, the airing of opinions, to an
end, the cementing of friendships.
Purposing to catch the spirit, if not
the fact, of such conversational meet
ings, short dialogues will be written
and will appear in this column from
time to time. If a columnist is a writer
versed in all the devious ways of the
world, a seer of his day reeking with
prophetic wisdom, ready to answer all
questions sacred and profane, the
writer chooses the better part of
valor and withdraws. However, if a
columnist is an ordinary mortal,
capable of all sorts of erroneous
opinions, and any number of inept
ideas, he qualifies.
So be it. Amid te deums, wailing of
bereft mourners, and the tinkling
crash of champagne bottles, this
"Talking It Over" column is launched
upon the seething journalistic sea of
the old Farm.
Fictitious, composite members of
the student body, John Demijohn and
Walt Purdee will talk it over and thus
make the dialogue. As the conversa
tion opens, Walt stands before the
room's one mirror, actively manning
a razor. He speaks to John, who with
sour face is breaking in a new pipe
and convinced that it's great sport.

"Did you know they've abolished
the honor system at Yale?"
"Great, when Stanford does the
same thing we'll have a rehabilitation
of honor in the student body." This
with a grimace from Walt.
"Whaddya mean 'great'? Imagine
slinking into class under the eagle
eye of a proctor like a whipped puppy
dog, sitting there writing under pres
sure, knowing every move is being
watched, feeling all the time like a
convict in a road gang. Not for me.
I'll take the honor system."
"A pretty ideal. The Yale move is
significant I believe. And you know
why they abolished it? Because of
the clause in their code requiring
cribbing to be reported. I have no
figures, but I've seen and know of
enough agrant cases of violation on
the campus."
"The number you know of wouldn't
prove much. Why not report them?"
"Report them hell! Picture me do
ing it."
"That's a false idea of fair play.
Let the maldoer be caught by the
representative of the law. The basis
of the whole system lies in the innate
sense of fair play, true fair play, as
sumed to be in every one at college."
"You say that and live in a society
whose basic precept is the survival
of the fittest. Competition doesn't stop
for rules. Fair play! Bah. The cribber
doesn't see it as a matter of fair play.
He's got to stay in school, competition
is keen, anything goes. Just this once
and he'll be good. You don't know
what you're talking about; come down
out of the clouds."
"Neither do you. You see nothing
but the sensational exception."
"I got to go to the Libe. Whose the
lucky babe tonight?"
"Run along sourbelly. Those gems
of wisdom can't wait for you to pluck
them."
