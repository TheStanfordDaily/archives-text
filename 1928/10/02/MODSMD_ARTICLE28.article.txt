Good-bye Wisconsin. By Glenway
Wescott. New York: Harper and
Brothers, 1928.)
And here is Main Street again. Not
j the street we have seen through the
i pitiless eyes of Sinclair Lewis, hut
one tempered by being seen through
the eyes of a man who is as much a
poet as he is a recorder of reality.
Glenway Wescott knows Wisconsin.
He loves it. But over and above his
love there surges a tremendous pity
for the emotionally starved multitudes
who love vivariously at the local
movie palace, and who think not at
all.
Wescott says the middle westerner
has changed from rustic to provincial.
Sinclair Lewis looked at this new
type, with his Fords and movies, and
radios, and pep clubs, and shuddered.
So we read his razor-keen words and
shudder, too.
When Wescott sees all these he is
filled with pity. And his simple style
of writing strips away unnecessary
verbiage, giving us sketches of char
acter and nature that are much like
Knut Hamsun in rugged emotional
content.
Thus, the opening chapter of the
book furnishes a setting in which are
located a series of sketches, called
stories. Even to run through the
names of these suggests the possibil
ity of restful moments of enjoyable
reading. We find, The Runaways;
Adolescence; A Guilty Woman; The
Dove Came Down; Like a Lover; In
a Thicket; Prohibition; The Sailor;
The Wedding March! The Whistling
Swan.
And, if you do pick this book up to
read, please mull over some of the
pictures and phrases. They're price
less.
Never Go Back. By George Boas.
(New York: Harper and Brothers,
1928.)
A first novel, whose author is a
professor of philosophy at Johns Hop
kins, the writer of a text, and a vet
eran of the Great War. All three of
these, the writer's attributes, are in
terestingly reflected in his book which
is advertised as "a story without a 1
plot" and as "a pungent satire of uni
versity life."
Needless to say, the novel has a
plot, although throughout it is sub
ordinated to excellently satirical
character-drawing, and to paragraphs
and one-page essays expressing the
author's philosophy. It is in these that
Boas' experiences in the War show
through—that one learns of his sense
of life's insignificance.
The author speaks of God as inter
ested in aesthetics rather than ethics,
claims that He is a Humorist, and
accuses Him of having made the
world without definite intent. These
arc statements that by themselves
look unconvincing, but woven as they
tire into the warp of the lives of
Francis Harper—whose history bears
strong resemblance to that of the
author —of John Tillingstone, the
operatic-basso professor and faculty
politician—of Violet Humphreys, "nut"
artist —and of Jackson, Mordecai,

Hampshire—faculty men of Oralia
(Stanford? —California?), such' state
ments take a proper place in the
scheme of things.
The book should interest graduates
and undergraduates by reason of its
exposure of professorial virtues, vani
ties, and vices. Faculty members will
like "Never Go Back" because it is
concerned with their friends and ene
mies, and because it is truly well
! written. Then, too, it seems almost
certain that Stanford is the scene of
the story. —Clifford F. Weigle.
THE DRAMA
Comes Fall, Football —and a flock
lof "talking in person" shows to San
Francisco. City nights will be more
diverting than ever if the present line
up of plays is a promise of what is
to come.
Two excellent comedies will help
cheer up you tired ones who have
come back to college to recuperate
from heavy vacationing—"Daddies" at
the President, and "The Royal Fam
ily" at the Geary.
For those who demand real his
tronics there is "The Play's the
Thing" at the Capitol, and for ro-
I manticists the Alcazar offers "An
i tonia."
Today we'll talk about one of the
j Duffy plays—
"Anton ia" —Alcazar.
For a few weeks, at least, we are
going to attend to business before
! plesaure. Much applause was aroused
jin the audience for Miss Marjorie
Rambeau's efforts. She is an old-time
San Francisco favorite, and is really
beautiful. They say she is one of
America's greatest dramatic actresses.
Mebbe so, mebbe so.
"Antonia" is a wildly romantic and
a thoroughly unbelievable play. It
concerns a popular prima donna who
emerges from her ten-year retirement
for one more night of passion in Buda
pest, her old stamping ground. She is
as attractive as ever to the gay
Lotharios, even though she has been
personally raising hogs on her ranch
for a decade. How she could retain
that schoolgirl complexion and allure
after all those years on the farm is j
just one of those mysteries we'll prob
ably never unravel.
But if you are a romantic and ex
tremely credulous soul you may enjoy
Antonia's little whirl in the big city.
Nothing improper happens—at the
critical moment when she is tempted
to abandon home, husband, honor, and
Ihe hogs, she remembers (he latter.
So, instead of flying away on the
wings of love with the handsome
Frenchman, she returns to the simple
lire.
Miss Rambeau gesticulates with
great gusto upon the slightest provo
cation, and although cast in a rather j
unconvincing role, never for a mo- j
ment makes it real. She acts in the j
grand manner —all over the stage, j
and affects many, many mannerisms. !
Alice Buchanan, as a disagreeable
gold-digger, is the bright lining in a
pretty dark cloud. The rest of the cast
is so-so. The settings are good.

terestingly reflected in his book which

versity life."
Needless to say, the novel has a
plot, although throughout it is sub
ordinated to excellently satirical
character-drawing, and to paragraphs

author's philosophy. It is in these that
Boas' experiences in the War show
through—that one learns of his sense
of life's insignificance.
The author speaks of God as inter
ested in aesthetics rather than ethics,
claims that He is a Humorist, and
accuses Him of having made the
world without definite intent. These
arc statements that by themselves
look unconvincing, but woven as they
tire into the warp of the lives of
Francis Harper—whose history bears
strong resemblance to that of the
author —of John Tillingstone, the
operatic-basso professor and faculty
politician—of Violet Humphreys, "nut"
artist —and of Jackson, Mordecai,

Hampshire—faculty men of Oralia
(Stanford? —California?), such' state
ments take a proper place in the
scheme of things.
The book should interest graduates
and undergraduates by reason of its
exposure of professorial virtues, vani
ties, and vices. Faculty members will
like "Never Go Back" because it is
concerned with their friends and ene
mies, and because it is truly well
! written. Then, too, it seems almost

THE DRAMA
Comes Fall, Football —and a flock
lof "talking in person" shows to San
Francisco. City nights will be more
diverting than ever if the present line
up of plays is a promise of what is
to come.
Two excellent comedies will help
cheer up you tired ones who have
come back to college to recuperate
from heavy vacationing—"Daddies" at
the President, and "The Royal Fam
ily" at the Geary.
For those who demand real his
tronics there is "The Play's the
Thing" at the Capitol, and for ro-
I manticists the Alcazar offers "An
i tonia."
Today we'll talk about one of the
j Duffy plays—
"Anton ia" —Alcazar.
For a few weeks, at least, we are
going to attend to business before
! plesaure. Much applause was aroused
jin the audience for Miss Marjorie
Rambeau's efforts. She is an old-time
San Francisco favorite, and is really
beautiful. They say she is one of
America's greatest dramatic actresses.
Mebbe so, mebbe so.
"Antonia" is a wildly romantic and
a thoroughly unbelievable play. It
concerns a popular prima donna who
emerges from her ten-year retirement
for one more night of passion in Buda
pest, her old stamping ground. She is
as attractive as ever to the gay
Lotharios, even though she has been
personally raising hogs on her ranch
for a decade. How she could retain
that schoolgirl complexion and allure
after all those years on the farm is j
just one of those mysteries we'll prob
ably never unravel.
But if you are a romantic and ex
tremely credulous soul you may enjoy
Antonia's little whirl in the big city.

critical moment when she is tempted
to abandon home, husband, honor, and
Ihe hogs, she remembers (he latter.
So, instead of flying away on the
wings of love with the handsome
Frenchman, she returns to the simple
lire.
Miss Rambeau gesticulates with
great gusto upon the slightest provo
cation, and although cast in a rather j
unconvincing role, never for a mo- j
ment makes it real. She acts in the j
grand manner —all over the stage, j
and affects many, many mannerisms. !
Alice Buchanan, as a disagreeable

i pitiless eyes of Sinclair Lewis, hut
one tempered by being seen through

Glenway Wescott knows Wisconsin.
He loves it. But over and above his
love there surges a tremendous pity
for the emotionally starved multitudes
who love vivariously at the local
movie palace, and who think not at
all.
Wescott says the middle westerner
has changed from rustic to provincial.
Sinclair Lewis looked at this new

radios, and pep clubs, and shuddered.
So we read his razor-keen words and
shudder, too.
When Wescott sees all these he is
filled with pity. And his simple style
of writing strips away unnecessary
verbiage, giving us sketches of char
acter and nature that are much like
Knut Hamsun in rugged emotional
content.
Thus, the opening chapter of the
book furnishes a setting in which are

"Antonia" is a wildly romantic and

Lotharios, even though she has been
personally raising hogs on her ranch

lire.
Miss Rambeau gesticulates with
great gusto upon the slightest provo

Good-bye Wisconsin. By Glenway
Wescott. New York: Harper and

And here is Main Street again. Not
j the street we have seen through the
i pitiless eyes of Sinclair Lewis, hut
one tempered by being seen through
the eyes of a man who is as much a
poet as he is a recorder of reality.
Glenway Wescott knows Wisconsin.
He loves it. But over and above his
love there surges a tremendous pity
for the emotionally starved multitudes
who love vivariously at the local
movie palace, and who think not at
all.
Wescott says the middle westerner
has changed from rustic to provincial.
Sinclair Lewis looked at this new
type, with his Fords and movies, and
radios, and pep clubs, and shuddered.
So we read his razor-keen words and
shudder, too.
When Wescott sees all these he is
filled with pity. And his simple style
of writing strips away unnecessary
verbiage, giving us sketches of char
acter and nature that are much like
Knut Hamsun in rugged emotional
content.
Thus, the opening chapter of the
book furnishes a setting in which are
located a series of sketches, called
stories. Even to run through the
names of these suggests the possibil
ity of restful moments of enjoyable
reading. We find, The Runaways;
Adolescence; A Guilty Woman; The
Dove Came Down; Like a Lover; In
a Thicket; Prohibition; The Sailor;
The Wedding March! The Whistling
Swan.

Never Go Back. By George Boas.
(New York: Harper and Brothers,
1928.)
A first novel, whose author is a
professor of philosophy at Johns Hop
kins, the writer of a text, and a vet
eran of the Great War. All three of
these, the writer's attributes, are in
terestingly reflected in his book which
is advertised as "a story without a 1
plot" and as "a pungent satire of uni
versity life."
Needless to say, the novel has a
plot, although throughout it is sub
ordinated to excellently satirical
character-drawing, and to paragraphs
and one-page essays expressing the
author's philosophy. It is in these that
Boas' experiences in the War show
through—that one learns of his sense
of life's insignificance.
The author speaks of God as inter
ested in aesthetics rather than ethics,
claims that He is a Humorist, and
accuses Him of having made the
world without definite intent. These
arc statements that by themselves
look unconvincing, but woven as they
tire into the warp of the lives of
Francis Harper—whose history bears
strong resemblance to that of the
author —of John Tillingstone, the
operatic-basso professor and faculty
politician—of Violet Humphreys, "nut"
artist —and of Jackson, Mordecai,

Hampshire—faculty men of Oralia
(Stanford? —California?), such' state
ments take a proper place in the
scheme of things.
The book should interest graduates
and undergraduates by reason of its
exposure of professorial virtues, vani
ties, and vices. Faculty members will
like "Never Go Back" because it is
concerned with their friends and ene
mies, and because it is truly well
! written. Then, too, it seems almost
certain that Stanford is the scene of
the story. —Clifford F. Weigle.
THE DRAMA
Comes Fall, Football —and a flock
lof "talking in person" shows to San
Francisco. City nights will be more
diverting than ever if the present line
up of plays is a promise of what is
to come.
Two excellent comedies will help
cheer up you tired ones who have
come back to college to recuperate
from heavy vacationing—"Daddies" at
the President, and "The Royal Fam
ily" at the Geary.
For those who demand real his
tronics there is "The Play's the
