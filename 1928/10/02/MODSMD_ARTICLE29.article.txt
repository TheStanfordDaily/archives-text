# Sam Pepys' Little Niece

October Ist, 1928.
Have spent a most wearisome day, and
vow that never in my life have I been
so fatigued. Arrived at Koble yesterday
with intentions of fixing my room before
classes began. Was much surprised to
see nothing of any of the many kind
friends I met at watering places this
summer, and who did ask me most
anxiously when I planned to go up to
school. Albeit I was all alone, did not
write in my diary, and so to bed early,
with a few tears on the pillow which
was uncommonly hard.
* * *
Arose early this morning and forth to
the cafeteria, where I did buy breakfast,
and had much trouble in drawing water
into my glass from the machine there.
Being bustled about by many people, and
not liking the coffee overly much did
hurry through, and so to the Administra
tion building, which a kind man pointed
out to me. Was met at the door with
many people, both men and women, who
appeared to be vendors. Found myself
signed up for a "Quad," though no such
course is listed in the time schedule; a
"Chapparal," which seems to be a kind
of humorous magazine devoted to bath
ing girls; and a map of the campus,
which I have carried about with me all
day and find no great help. In spite of
the pretty colors, do find that the build
ings of the future are marked more dis
tinctly than those of the present, which
led me to embarrassing difficulties. The
young lady who sold me this fine map
said it was for a cap and gown, but she
did not hand me any such articles when
I gave her my checque, so methinks I
must be mistaken.
* * *
Terrific troubles in registering, what
with the photographer who would not
wait for me to powder my nose, and with
taking biology courses, which I know I
will dislike. I was much amazed at the
great crowds of students, who seemed
very old, but who I- am told are all as
new as myself. Did stand in innumera
ble lines, and it gave me great wonder
to observe that I was always at the end
of the rows.
* * *
Did print out much information in the
little book which I was given at the
registrar's window, and heard many
grumbles of surprise about the new raise
in "incidental fees." Am regretful I did
not register in the past summer, when
education was more of a bargain, but
was glad to learn the addition was to
the "guild fees." And I have decided I
shall have my tonsils extracted while I
am a student, for it is more inexpensive
than at home. And so back the many
miles from the gymnasium to Roble,
where I took my shoes off as soon as
possible. Am exceedingly anxious for
tomorrow when the real students will
return.
And so to bed.

write in my diary, and so to bed early,
with a few tears on the pillow which
was uncommonly hard.

Arose early this morning and forth to
the cafeteria, where I did buy breakfast,
and had much trouble in drawing water
into my glass from the machine there.
Being bustled about by many people, and
not liking the coffee overly much did
hurry through, and so to the Administra
tion building, which a kind man pointed
out to me. Was met at the door with
many people, both men and women, who
appeared to be vendors. Found myself
signed up for a "Quad," though no such
course is listed in the time schedule; a
"Chapparal," which seems to be a kind
of humorous magazine devoted to bath
ing girls; and a map of the campus,
which I have carried about with me all
day and find no great help. In spite of
the pretty colors, do find that the build
ings of the future are marked more dis
tinctly than those of the present, which
led me to embarrassing difficulties. The
young lady who sold me this fine map
said it was for a cap and gown, but she
did not hand me any such articles when
I gave her my checque, so methinks I
must be mistaken.
* * *
Terrific troubles in registering, what
with the photographer who would not
wait for me to powder my nose, and with
taking biology courses, which I know I
will dislike. I was much amazed at the
great crowds of students, who seemed
very old, but who I- am told are all as
new as myself. Did stand in innumera
ble lines, and it gave me great wonder
to observe that I was always at the end
of the rows.
* * *
Did print out much information in the
little book which I was given at the
registrar's window, and heard many
grumbles of surprise about the new raise
in "incidental fees." Am regretful I did
not register in the past summer, when
education was more of a bargain, but
was glad to learn the addition was to
the "guild fees." And I have decided I
shall have my tonsils extracted while I
am a student, for it is more inexpensive
than at home. And so back the many
miles from the gymnasium to Roble,
where I took my shoes off as soon as
possible. Am exceedingly anxious for
tomorrow when the real students will
return.
And so to bed.
October Ist, 1928.
Have spent a most wearisome day, and
vow that never in my life have I been
so fatigued. Arrived at Koble yesterday
with intentions of fixing my room before
classes began. Was much surprised to
see nothing of any of the many kind
friends I met at watering places this
summer, and who did ask me most
anxiously when I planned to go up to
school. Albeit I was all alone, did not
write in my diary, and so to bed early,
with a few tears on the pillow which
was uncommonly hard.
