There ought to be something witty said
! about freshmen. But how can you make
joaks about 'em when half the student
body makes a comfortable living by sell

will be a generul colyum. There are a
; lot of pretty line joaks lurking in odd

per, Tyrannis," as you may well
imagine.

"Brave Admiral, speak, what shall j
we say—
What shall we say when the cof
fee's gone ?
The words leapt like a leaping
sword—
'Ceylon, Ceylon, CEYLON I CEY
LON 11'"
