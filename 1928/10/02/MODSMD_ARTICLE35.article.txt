# 1932 CRIES FOR DINKS Freshmen Uphold Tradition JEANS IN BIG DEMAND
## 
### 
Lo! the poor frosh; and behold, his
poor roommate. Poorer and fewer â€”
that describes the class of 1932.
"Casey" Kazanjian, Encina merchant
prince and varsity football berserker,
reports from sales at his basement
store that many members of this
year's incoming class either have
thin-lined purses or Scotch ancestry.
Dinks are greatly in demand. Most
of the frosh will be seen beneath six
inches of grey felt this season, if the
supply holds out. At least one hundred
and fifty men of '32 are wearing jeans
already, and, what is most unusual,
school pins and watch charms are
much in demand. "Casey" thinks that
our future Stanford heroes must have
been picking up a few ideas from the
collegiate (?) movies which are so
common now.
He who bewails loss of tradition at
Stanford should listen to "Casey's"
obituary of the dink custom: A few
years ago competition among manu
facturers cut the price of dinks to
fifty cents, which is almost less than
cost.
Last year he wasn't feeling philan
thropic enough to lose a nickel on
each sale, so no more were ordered.
There were enough dinks for one
third of the frosh, another third
wanted them, and the rest did not.
Freshmen have wanted to wear dinks
the three years that "Casey" has been
here, but he can't afford to sell them.
Comparatively few specimens are left.
