# CARD NINE FETED ON TOUR, WIN 10 STRAIGHT GAMES
## Australian Fans Enthusiastic; Samoans Train Month, Then It Rains 
### BOB PHILIPPI 
(Following is an account of the
Australian tour taken by the varsity base
ball team this summer. It is written by
Robert L. Philippi, pitcher.—Editor.)

On September 13 the Stanford varsity
baseball team returned from a successful
summer tour which took them to Hono
lulu, Samoa, the Fijis, New Zealand and
Australia. The trip lasted approximately
ten weeks, six of which were spent on
the water.
The team sailed July 5 from San Fran
cisco on board the S. S. "Sierra." Prac
tice sessions were held at Honolulu and
Suva. A game was scheduled with a
native team at Samoa, but it rained all
the time the team was there, and the
game had to be cancelled. The natives
had journeyed from all over the island
to witness the game, and the Samoan
team had been in strict training for a
month.
Practice was held at Suva in the park
where the "Southern Cross" landed on its
flight to Australia.
A storm was encountered off the Aus
tralian coast which delayed the arrival of
the "Sierra" by five or six hours. This
upset plans for a grand reception and
parade sponsored by the Australia Base
ball Council. Even so, the team was
royally welcomed at various dinners and
banquets, chief among which was a re
ception in the Sydney Town Hall, at
tended by the chief commissioner and
his colleagues. It is roughly estimated
that the team lived through 1492 speeches
of welcome, and an equal number of
toasts while in Australia. A choice vo
cabulary of Australian slang was soon
acquired, and "God Save the King" be
came a household hymn.
Eleven games in all were played in
Sydney. Only one defeat was suffered—
that at the hands of Victoria on the sec
ond day after the team got off the boat.
The team soon got its "land legs" and
won ten straight games. Three victories
were scored over All-Star Australia
team, which feat virtually makes the
Stanford varsity champions of Australia.
More than 15,000 enthusiastic "bar
rackers" (rooters) turned out at each of
the big games, which were held at the
Sydney Show Grounds.
Following is a list of games played
and their respective scores:
July 28—Victoria d. Stanford 5-3.
July 30—Stanford d. South Australia
26-1.
August I—Stanford d. New South
Wales 9-4.
August 4—Stanford d. Australia in
first test game 13-6.
August 6—Stanford d. Metropolitan
12-2.
August B—Stanford d. University of
Sydney 5-2.
August 9—Stanford d. Metropolitan
7-3.
August 11—Stanford d. Australia in
second test game 2-1.
August 15—Stanford d. All University
Team 31-5.
August 18—Stanford d. Australia in
third test game 7-0.
August 22—Stanford d. New South
Wales 21-13.
The team reports a busy time in Sid
ney attending banquets, theater parties,
and many other functions tendered to
them. They all came back with a pro
found sympathy for Lindberg, for they
were overrun with cameramen, autograph
seekers, souvenir hunters, and fans.
The average "baseballer's" impressions
of Sydney would be something like this:
"Autos drive on the left side of the
street, gasoline is fifty a gallon, and
taxis are expensive. It is winter down
there when it ought to be summer, the
hotels are cold, and the elevators are
slow. Sydney harbor is beautiful; the
streets are narrow, the cops are all
giants, the women are 0.K., but the men
dress like the devil. The food is fairly
good, the beer is perfect, and the na
tional blossom is the cauliflower. 'Good,'
'righto,' and 'cheerio' are the most-used
words in the Australian's vocabulary, and
a good ball game is a 'fair dinkem go.'
The climate is not unlike that of Cali
fornia. The people are very hospitable,
most things are expensive, and American
cigarettes cost thirty-five cents a pack
age."
The team left Sydney August 24 on
the S.S. "Niagara." Stops were made at
Aukland, Suva, and Honolulu. At the
latter port a transfer was made to the
S.S. "Samoa."
The men who made the trip were the
following: Bill Laird, Jim Busch, Spud
Harder. Frank Wilton, Elmert Riesc,
Roger Paxton, Harry Berg, Robert Pliil
ippi, John Garibaldi, Bill Maguire, Jack
Levin, Gene Kern, Doug Lewis, Murray
Draper (manager), Alexis Ehrman (as
sistant manager), and Coach and Mrs.
Harry Woltcr.

The team reports a busy time in Sid
ney attending banquets, theater parties,
and many other functions tendered to
them. They all came back with a pro
found sympathy for Lindberg, for they
were overrun with cameramen, autograph
seekers, souvenir hunters, and fans.
The average "baseballer's" impressions
of Sydney would be something like this:
"Autos drive on the left side of the
street, gasoline is fifty a gallon, and
taxis are expensive. It is winter down
there when it ought to be summer, the
hotels are cold, and the elevators are
slow. Sydney harbor is beautiful; the
streets are narrow, the cops are all
giants, the women are 0.K., but the men
dress like the devil. The food is fairly
good, the beer is perfect, and the na
tional blossom is the cauliflower. 'Good,'
'righto,' and 'cheerio' are the most-used
words in the Australian's vocabulary, and
a good ball game is a 'fair dinkem go.'
The climate is not unlike that of Cali
fornia. The people are very hospitable,
most things are expensive, and American
cigarettes cost thirty-five cents a pack
age."
The team left Sydney August 24 on
the S.S. "Niagara." Stops were made at
Aukland, Suva, and Honolulu. At the
latter port a transfer was made to the
S.S. "Samoa."
The men who made the trip were the
following: Bill Laird, Jim Busch, Spud
Harder. Frank Wilton, Elmert Riesc,
Roger Paxton, Harry Berg, Robert Pliil
ippi, John Garibaldi, Bill Maguire, Jack
Levin, Gene Kern, Doug Lewis, Murray
Draper (manager), Alexis Ehrman (as
sistant manager), and Coach and Mrs.
Harry Woltcr.
(Following is an account of the
Australian tour taken by the varsity base
ball team this summer. It is written by
Robert L. Philippi, pitcher.—Editor.)

On September 13 the Stanford varsity
baseball team returned from a successful
summer tour which took them to Hono
lulu, Samoa, the Fijis, New Zealand and
Australia. The trip lasted approximately
ten weeks, six of which were spent on
the water.
The team sailed July 5 from San Fran
cisco on board the S. S. "Sierra." Prac
tice sessions were held at Honolulu and
Suva. A game was scheduled with a
native team at Samoa, but it rained all
the time the team was there, and the
game had to be cancelled. The natives
had journeyed from all over the island
to witness the game, and the Samoan
team had been in strict training for a
month.
Practice was held at Suva in the park
where the "Southern Cross" landed on its
flight to Australia.
A storm was encountered off the Aus
tralian coast which delayed the arrival of
the "Sierra" by five or six hours. This
upset plans for a grand reception and
parade sponsored by the Australia Base
ball Council. Even so, the team was
royally welcomed at various dinners and
banquets, chief among which was a re
ception in the Sydney Town Hall, at
tended by the chief commissioner and
his colleagues. It is roughly estimated
that the team lived through 1492 speeches
of welcome, and an equal number of
toasts while in Australia. A choice vo
cabulary of Australian slang was soon
acquired, and "God Save the King" be
came a household hymn.
Eleven games in all were played in
Sydney. Only one defeat was suffered—
that at the hands of Victoria on the sec
ond day after the team got off the boat.
The team soon got its "land legs" and
won ten straight games. Three victories
were scored over All-Star Australia
team, which feat virtually makes the
Stanford varsity champions of Australia.
More than 15,000 enthusiastic "bar
rackers" (rooters) turned out at each of
the big games, which were held at the
Sydney Show Grounds.
Following is a list of games played
and their respective scores:
July 28—Victoria d. Stanford 5-3.

flight to Australia.
A storm was encountered off the Aus
tralian coast which delayed the arrival of
the "Sierra" by five or six hours. This
upset plans for a grand reception and
parade sponsored by the Australia Base
ball Council. Even so, the team was
royally welcomed at various dinners and
banquets, chief among which was a re
ception in the Sydney Town Hall, at
tended by the chief commissioner and
his colleagues. It is roughly estimated
that the team lived through 1492 speeches
of welcome, and an equal number of
toasts while in Australia. A choice vo
cabulary of Australian slang was soon
acquired, and "God Save the King" be
came a household hymn.
Eleven games in all were played in
Sydney. Only one defeat was suffered—
that at the hands of Victoria on the sec
ond day after the team got off the boat.
The team soon got its "land legs" and
won ten straight games. Three victories
were scored over All-Star Australia
team, which feat virtually makes the
Stanford varsity champions of Australia.
More than 15,000 enthusiastic "bar
rackers" (rooters) turned out at each of
the big games, which were held at the
Sydney Show Grounds.
Following is a list of games played
and their respective scores:
July 28—Victoria d. Stanford 5-3.
July 30—Stanford d. South Australia
26-1.
August I—Stanford d. New South
Wales 9-4.
August 4—Stanford d. Australia in
first test game 13-6.
August 6—Stanford d. Metropolitan
12-2.
August B—Stanford d. University of
Sydney 5-2.
August 9—Stanford d. Metropolitan
7-3.
August 11—Stanford d. Australia in
second test game 2-1.
August 15—Stanford d. All University
Team 31-5.
August 18—Stanford d. Australia in
third test game 7-0.
August 22—Stanford d. New South
Wales 21-13.
The team reports a busy time in Sid
ney attending banquets, theater parties,
and many other functions tendered to
them. They all came back with a pro
found sympathy for Lindberg, for they
were overrun with cameramen, autograph
seekers, souvenir hunters, and fans.
The average "baseballer's" impressions
of Sydney would be something like this:
"Autos drive on the left side of the
street, gasoline is fifty a gallon, and
taxis are expensive. It is winter down
there when it ought to be summer, the
hotels are cold, and the elevators are
slow. Sydney harbor is beautiful; the
streets are narrow, the cops are all
giants, the women are 0.K., but the men
dress like the devil. The food is fairly
good, the beer is perfect, and the na
tional blossom is the cauliflower. 'Good,'
'righto,' and 'cheerio' are the most-used
words in the Australian's vocabulary, and
a good ball game is a 'fair dinkem go.'
The climate is not unlike that of Cali
fornia. The people are very hospitable,
most things are expensive, and American
cigarettes cost thirty-five cents a pack
age."
The team left Sydney August 24 on
the S.S. "Niagara." Stops were made at
Aukland, Suva, and Honolulu. At the
latter port a transfer was made to the
S.S. "Samoa."
The men who made the trip were the
following: Bill Laird, Jim Busch, Spud
Harder. Frank Wilton, Elmert Riesc,
Roger Paxton, Harry Berg, Robert Pliil
ippi, John Garibaldi, Bill Maguire, Jack
Levin, Gene Kern, Doug Lewis, Murray
Draper (manager), Alexis Ehrman (as
sistant manager), and Coach and Mrs.
Harry Woltcr.

Australian tour taken by the varsity base

On September 13 the Stanford varsity
baseball team returned from a successful
summer tour which took them to Hono
lulu, Samoa, the Fijis, New Zealand and
Australia. The trip lasted approximately
ten weeks, six of which were spent on
the water.
The team sailed July 5 from San Fran
cisco on board the S. S. "Sierra." Prac
tice sessions were held at Honolulu and
Suva. A game was scheduled with a
native team at Samoa, but it rained all
the time the team was there, and the
game had to be cancelled. The natives
had journeyed from all over the island
to witness the game, and the Samoan
team had been in strict training for a
month.
