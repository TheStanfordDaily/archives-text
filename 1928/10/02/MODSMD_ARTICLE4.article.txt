						NEW PRESS SERVICE
## 
### 
Commencing today, the Daily offers Associated Press news dis
patches, feature articles and photographs to its readers. It has been
made a member of the Associated Press and will receive the evening
report of that organization in what is known as a "pony" service, i.e.,
the report comes down by bus from San Francisco twice nightly.
As much news of the world, particularly politics and foreign affairs,
will be published as the size of the paper and its necessary devotion
primarily to campus news will permit.
The A.P. will be used in place of the United Press, which served
the Daily last year.
