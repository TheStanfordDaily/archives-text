# SPORTS OF 1928
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
From the winning sensation of the
East in 1926 to the doormat of nearly
every college, big and little, that it
played in 1927—that was the metamor
phosis that the Brown University foot
ball team underwent in the short space
of fifteen months. When Coach D. O.
McLaughry's boys began slapping over
all opposition two seasons ago, and de
feated Yale and Dartmouth on succes
sive Saturdays without using a substi
tute, folks began to sit up and take no
tice, and the name of "Iron Men" was
tagged on to the small but sturdy war
riors of the little school at Providence,
Rhode Island.
Led by Captain Hal Broda, one of the
best ends in the country, and with a back
field composed of Red Randall, Ed Law
rence, Dave Mishel, and A1 Cornsweet,
the "Iron Men" went through the season
without a defeat, played a tie game with
Colgate, and won much fame for their
school and themselves and more "iron
men," so it is said, for their coach.
Now "Tuss" McLaughry, a former
Westminster man, is no dumb-bell, and
when the boys gathered for the 1927 sea
son they were advised by their coach to
"Forget last year's record." Evidently
that was pretty hard to do, and slight
evidence of swell-headedness was appar
ent. But nobody worried much—"The
Iron Men would come through " —and
so the 1927 season got under way. Rhode
Island State and Albright were beaten
easily, and then came the holocaust.
Brown lost to Penn and was swamped
by Yale, 19 to 0.

"Ah well, two set-ups in a row for a
breather, then we'll tackle Dartmouth
and Harvard," mused the Iron Men. The
"set-ups,". Lebanon Valley and Temple,
beat Brown 13 to 12 and 7 to 0, respec
tively. Then came the Dartmouth and
Harvard set-backs and a victory over
little New Hampshire, and one last su
preme effort against Colgate. But for
the third year in succession Brown and
Colgate tied, so the season was an utter
failure.

From the winning sensation of the
East in 1926 to the doormat of nearly
every college, big and little, that it
played in 1927—that was the metamor
phosis that the Brown University foot
ball team underwent in the short space
of fifteen months. When Coach D. O.
McLaughry's boys began slapping over
all opposition two seasons ago, and de
feated Yale and Dartmouth on succes
sive Saturdays without using a substi
tute, folks began to sit up and take no
tice, and the name of "Iron Men" was
tagged on to the small but sturdy war
riors of the little school at Providence,
Rhode Island.
Led by Captain Hal Broda, one of the
best ends in the country, and with a back
field composed of Red Randall, Ed Law
rence, Dave Mishel, and A1 Cornsweet,
the "Iron Men" went through the season
without a defeat, played a tie game with
Colgate, and won much fame for their
school and themselves and more "iron
men," so it is said, for their coach.
Now "Tuss" McLaughry, a former
Westminster man, is no dumb-bell, and
when the boys gathered for the 1927 sea
son they were advised by their coach to
"Forget last year's record." Evidently
that was pretty hard to do, and slight
evidence of swell-headedness was appar
ent. But nobody worried much—"The
Iron Men would come through " —and
so the 1927 season got under way. Rhode
Island State and Albright were beaten
easily, and then came the holocaust.
Brown lost to Penn and was swamped
by Yale, 19 to 0.

"Ah well, two set-ups in a row for a
breather, then we'll tackle Dartmouth
and Harvard," mused the Iron Men. The
"set-ups,". Lebanon Valley and Temple,
beat Brown 13 to 12 and 7 to 0, respec
tively. Then came the Dartmouth and
Harvard set-backs and a victory over
little New Hampshire, and one last su
preme effort against Colgate. But for
the third year in succession Brown and
Colgate tied, so the season was an utter
failure.
Can the "Iron Men" forget last year's
record ?
