# G.O.P. CEREMONY TURNS SPOTLIGHT ON LOCAL CAMPUS
## 
### PAUL SEXSON 
Stanford University was the focus
point of national political publicity for
a few weeks this summer. Stanford's
most famous son, Herbert Hoover, Re
publican presidential candidate, whose
home is on the campus, came home for
the official notification of his nomination,
which took place in the Stanford Stadium
on August 11th.
Never in the history of the Univer
sity has Stanford been host to such an
important event, and August 11th trans
cends all other dates when viewed his
torically. Seldom has there been gath
ered together, outside of Washington
itself, a more colorful group of nation
ally prominent characters, who came
from every state in the Union to see
Herbert Hoover receive from the hands
of his party the highest honor it can
give.
Notables Attend
Included in the long list of celebrities
were: Secretary of War Dwight F.
Davis, Secretary of Navy Curtis D. Wil
bur, Justice Harlan F. Stone, Dr. Hubert
Work, Republican campaign manager;
Senator George H. Moses, chairman of
the notification committee; Senator John
Q. Tilson, Republican floor leader; Wil
liam H. Crocker, Governor C. C. Young,
Senator Hiram Johnson, and many other
notables, all of whom conferred with
Mr. Hoover at one time or another.
The Hoover party arrived on the
campus July 20th, coming direct from
Washington on their special train. Plans
had been made by both San Francisco
and Palo Alto for an elaborate reception
to welcome home their famous son, but
due to the death of Mrs. Hoover's
father, Mr. C. D. Henry, these plans
were temporarily abandoned.
University officials literally "gave the
whole University" to Mr. Hoover and
his party, and all available facilities were
commandeered for his disposal.
Stanford's summer students for the
first time had a real "pep" rally on July
24th, when an enthusiastic growd gath
ered in the Union court, and was or
ganized which proceeded up the row to
San Juan Hill and the Hoover home.
Build Speaker's Stand
Elaborate preparations for the handling
of a capacity crowd on the day of the
notification kept University officials busy
for nearly three weeks. A speaker's
stand was built in at the south end of
the stadium, and it was much like a big
stage set up on the bank of the seats.
From this position the speakers were
visible to all parts of the stadium. An
elaborate system of loud-speakers was in
stalled above this stand.
