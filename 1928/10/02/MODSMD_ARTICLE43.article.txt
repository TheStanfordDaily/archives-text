# SMITH'S COUNSEL ASKED FOR N. Y. POLITICAL SLATE
## 
### 
ROCHESTER, N. Y., Oct. I—(JP)—
Back in his home state after a campaign
invasion of the West, Governor Smith
stepped from his special train here today
into the atmosphere of a political con
vention, looking to him for guidance.
Half an hour after his arrival in this
upstate city, which gave him a rousing
welcome, the Democratic presidential
nominee was in conference with party
leaders, anxious to get his views as to
who should be nominated for governor
and given other places on the Demo
cratic state ticket.
Smith Given Support
The state convention was just getting
under way, but none of the nearly 1,000
delegates nor any of the party wheel
horses directing affairs were inclined to
do anything toward shaping up a slate
until they had canvassed the situation
with Smith. All hands agreed that what
he said would go.
The presidential nominee, as he held
one pow-wow after another with old
time friends and political allies who have
been calling him "Al" for years was kept
so busy that he had no time for advance
preparation of his speech to the conven
tion tonight. He kept to himself what
he intended to say and passed the word
that he would speak extemporaneously.
Admirers Cheer Candidate
On his arrival here about the time he
usually has breakfast, the presidential
nominee, wearing at a jaunty angle a
gray fedora instead of a brown derby,
found several bands and thousands of
cheering admirers waiting to greet him.
As the musicians played "East Side, West
Side" over and over a reception commit
tee, swelled to hundreds as many un
designated welcomers slipped through
police lines, swarmed about the train.
As the returning campaigner detrained,
the cheer that went up was quickly
picked up by the thousands massed
around the station.
The governor intends to remain in
Rochester until after nominations are
made tomorrow and the convention has
adjourned. Then he will head for Al
bany for a few days layoff before re
suming his speechmaking campaign for
the presidency.
