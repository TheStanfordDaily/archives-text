### 
ROCHESTER, N.Y., Oct. 1.-(yP)â€”
Efforts to draft Franklin D. Roosevelt
an Democratic gubernatorial candi
date failed today and left that im
portant position on the slate, the
prime business before the State Con
vention when the night session
opened.
Mr. Roosevelt, former Assistant
Secretary o fthe Navy, and proposer
of Governor Smith in two national
conventions, telegraphed the Gov
ernor his regret that he could not,
because of his health, accept the
nomination. Reports were that Gov
ernor Smith had made a personal
plea in an effort to overcome Mr.
Roosevelt's reiterated declination.
An address by Governor Smith fea
tured tonight's program.
The convention today effected a
temporary organization.
William Church Osborn in his key
note address, reviewed the career and
praised the administration of the
Governor; took a fling at Mrs. Mabel
Walker Willebrandt for "appealing to
the great body of the Methodist
Church to act as a political body" on
the prohibition question; said he be
lieved prohibition had produced great
moral wrongs and urged the delegates
to conduct themselves with "wisdom
and zeal" in order to place the Gov
ernor in the White House.
The tentative planks of the party
platform, it is said, follow the na
tional platform closely but stress
state affairs at considerable length.
Oliver Cabana, Jr., Buffalo banker,
has been selected for permanent
chairman of the convention. Nomina
tions for the state ticket will be made
at tomorrow's session.
