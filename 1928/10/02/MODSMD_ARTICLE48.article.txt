NEW YORK, Oct. 1—(/Pi—Pitchcrs
worked out all over the field and bats- [
men rattled line drives against the i
bleachers and even in the empty seats [
at the Yankee Stadium today, but the (
gestures did not mean anything. The |
Yankees and Cardinals were tuning up
for the World Series opening Thursday. !
The National Leaguers arc set. There :
is no worry in the St. Louis camp over j
condition. "Not a bruise in the bunch"
was the proud boast of the trainer and
the actions of the Red Birds backed him I
up.

attach whistles to its flock of 1251
carrier pigeons to protect them from ,
hawks.
