# DAVIS TO REPEAT PLAY SUCCESS OF SUMMER QUARTER
## Sherwood Comedy "Queen's Husband" To Be Given October 12 
### 
Gordon Davis announced late last
night that the first play of this season
will be Robert Sherwood's famous com
edy-satire, "The Queen's Husband." The
date of the production has been set for
October 12.
The cast which created the characteri
zation in the two presentations during
the summer quarter is to be slightly
changed. Elizabeth Wilbur, who played
the feminine lead, is unable to take her
role, as she is engaged at the Fulton
Theater in Oakland; Virginia Volland,
who starred in "The Chief Thing" and
"Right You Are" during the summer,
will be seen as the domineering queen.
Helen Ward, who is well known on the
Stanford stage, is scheduled to interpret
the character of Princess Anne.
Davis Takes Lead
The lead is to be played by Gordon
Davis, whose work in this part created
much favorable comment in dramatic
circles. It is the finest creation Davis has
ever formulated.
Irving Rosenblatt, Dick Stewart, Dick
Fisher, Jack Wiggin, Leavenworth Colby,
Elmo Robinson, Byron Snow, and Rob
ert Sears are members of the cast.
Helvenston Creates Set
Harold Helvenston, new technical and
art director for the Stanford stage, an
nounced that the set and costumes for
"The Queen's Husband" are valued at
over fifteen hundred dollars. The fram
ing of the play will be the most elaborate
to be seen on a Stanford stage for some
time. Work in plaster of Paris, papier
mache, perforated woodwork, fringed
velvet hangings, and authentically re
produced medallions have been created
for the play.
The furniture and fixtures arc original
Louis XV. The whole set is in keeping
with the period.
