# COST OF PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM SET AT $20,000
## 
### 
Although the appearance of the Stan
ford stadium has not been greatly
changed during the summer, more than
$20,000 has been spent and workmen have
been busy all summer on the installation
of one of the most modern public ad
dress systems on the Pacific coast Ap
paratus of a similar but less modern
nature has already been installed in the
University of Washington stadium, the
Coliseum at Los Angeles, and the Rose
Bowl at Pasadena. It is understood that
the University of California has a simi
lar project under consideration.
Twelve horns, seven feet long and
three feet across the face, have been
placed on top of the scoreboard at the
north end of the stadium and spaced in
such a manner as to make the sound
clearly audible to a person sitting in any
part of the bowl.
Triple Booth Constructed
A glass enclosed "hut" has been built at
the top of the north side of the stadium
which consists of three compartments.
The west compartment is connected by
telephone to the field and is for the use
of the announcer. The middle compart
ment is for the use of the assistant an
nouncer, and is connected by telephone to
various sections of the stands. The east
compartment is an extra one and can be
used by visiting coaches or special speak
ers.
Don Liebendorfer, publicity manager
for the Board of Athletic Control, has
been doing the announcing, and Louis
Vincenti, end on last year's team, with
the assistance of one of the visiting
team's managers, has been doing the tele
phoning from the field.
Control Room Used
Directly under the announcer's booth
is the control room in which are located
two panels, seven feet high and two and
one-half feet wide, containing the con
trols for the entire system.
In the control room there is also a
phonograph which makes it possible to
reproduce records for future use.
Provision is also made for a radio, by
means of which accounts of the big
games away from home and other im
portant events that are broadcast can
be picked up and reproduced through the
horns.
It is possible to take the horns off the
north scoreboard and place them in the
middle of the field and the microphones
can also be moved to the field, which
makes the stadium an ideal place to hold
rallies and other gatherings of that
nature.

for the Board of Athletic Control, has
been doing the announcing, and Louis
Vincenti, end on last year's team, with
the assistance of one of the visiting

Control Room Used
Directly under the announcer's booth
is the control room in which are located
two panels, seven feet high and two and
one-half feet wide, containing the con
trols for the entire system.
In the control room there is also a
phonograph which makes it possible to
reproduce records for future use.
Provision is also made for a radio, by
means of which accounts of the big
games away from home and other im
portant events that are broadcast can
be picked up and reproduced through the
horns.
It is possible to take the horns off the
north scoreboard and place them in the
middle of the field and the microphones
can also be moved to the field, which
makes the stadium an ideal place to hold
rallies and other gatherings of that
nature.

changed during the summer, more than
$20,000 has been spent and workmen have
been busy all summer on the installation
of one of the most modern public ad

paratus of a similar but less modern
nature has already been installed in the
University of Washington stadium, the
Coliseum at Los Angeles, and the Rose
Bowl at Pasadena. It is understood that

lar project under consideration.
Twelve horns, seven feet long and
three feet across the face, have been
placed on top of the scoreboard at the
north end of the stadium and spaced in
such a manner as to make the sound
clearly audible to a person sitting in any
part of the bowl.
