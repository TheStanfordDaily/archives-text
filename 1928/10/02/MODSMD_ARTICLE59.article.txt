## 
### 
Holbrook Blinn, ex-'95, died from
blood poisoning on June 24 at his
country home on the Hudson river.
As an undergraduate, he was the sole
editor and manager of the first cam
pus publication, The Sequoia, and it
was in the first issue that he predicted
Stanford would be the greatest col
lege in the West. At the time of his
death he was regarded as one of the
most popular actors on the American
and English stages.
