### 
WICHITA, Kan., Oct. 1—(/P)—The
home state of Senator Charles Curtis
and William Allen White was selected
tonight by Senator Joe Robinson, the
Democratic vice presidential nominee, as
a site from which to open up with verbal
attack guns on the activities of both.
Further, the Senator singled out Kan
sas, one of the great farm states, as the
place from which to deliver the most
extended attack so far made on his tour
of the west on the record of the Re
publican Party toward the farmer.
In a speech specifically prepared for
delivery here, he accused both Curtis,
his rival for office, and other Republic
ans with "trifling" with the agricultural
problem and declared that neither the
Kansas senator nor Herbert Hoover, the
Republican standard bearer, had ad
vanced "any definite and effective plan"
for carrying out party pledges on this
question.
"Both Mr. Hoover and Senator Cur
tis profess the belief," Mr. Robinson
said in his prepared address, "that in
creased tariffs on farm products are an
adequate remedy for the depression in
agriculture. It is a recognized principle
of economics that protective tariffs are
rarely effective to maintain domestic
prices on farm products."
