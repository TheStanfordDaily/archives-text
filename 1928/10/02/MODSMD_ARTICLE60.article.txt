# EDUCATION STEREOTYPED SAYS PRESIDENT WILBUR
## 
### 
"Our education has too much been
stereotyped along narrow scholastic
lines," President Wilbur declared at
the national conference on state parks
in Ran Francisco, June 28.
"To my mind," he said, "it shows
better education to know the number
and the width of the rings in a great
tree and their significance than to
know the number and disposition of
the wives of Henry VIII.
"We shall have a sounder popula
tion if we can give our people mem
ories of trees and trails instead of
cabarets and can openers," he said.
