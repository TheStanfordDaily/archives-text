# DRAMATICS HAS AN EVENTFUL SUMMER
## 
### 
Gordon Davis returned from the
East early in the summer, bringing
with him a stage technician, and
graduate of the Yale Dramatic
School, Harold Helvenston. Together,
these two men presented three plays
during the quarter which would have
put many professional productions to
shame.
The first presentation of the quar
ter, "The Queen's Husband," by Rob
ert E. Sherwood, was a clever satire
on modern monarchies in which Gor
don Davis, as the King, and Betty
Wilbur, as the Queen, virtually stole
the show. The play was so popular
it was repeated on August 10.
"The Chief Thing" was the second
production. Erveinoff's fantastic crea
tion was presented as part of the
varied dramatic program for the Sum
mer Quarter. Davis borrowed it from
the New York stage in order that he
might acquaint the people of this vi
cinity with a new type of expression
istic thought which has lately pre
vailed in so many Eastern successes.
A cast of forty people carried this
unusual philosophical comedy through
to a brilliant finale.
In his third and final play of the
summer the Stanford director pre
sented Pirandello's metaphysical
melodrama, "Right You Are If You
Think You Are." The characteriza
tions of Verna Hannah, Pat Murphy,
and Irving Rosenblatt were especially
outstanding in this charming drama
of Italian life.
Cranston Holman, '27, former Stan
ford tennis captain, won the Pacific
Coast tennis championship by defeat
ing Robert Seller, University of Cali
fornia undergraduate, by 6-3, 7-5, 3-6,
6-1, on July 1.
Harry Maloney, associate director
of Encina Gym and pi'esident of the
P.A.A., declined on July 3 an offer
to be assistant manager of the Ameri
can Olympic track and field team. His
summer duties were ascribed as the
reason.
Three hundred students flocked to
the all-University 9-to-l jolly-up held
June 29 at Roble. Dean Mary Yost,
Miss Olivia Boezinger, Mrs. Harry
Clark, and Director of the Summer
Quarter John Sellards received.
The Men's Council for the summer
was appointed by the Dean of Men
and included Clark Cypher, chairman,
Harry Call, Edwin Smith, and Tem
pleton Peck.
Ed Loder, engineer and manager of
operations for the B. of A.C. left Au
gust 1 to become manager of the
Sacramento municipal stadium.
George Ellsworth, treasurer of the
Class of 1928, donated $300 to the
Convalescent Home as a gift of the
class on July 16.
One hundred and twenty-five people
were reported to have been prostrated
by the heat at the Hoover notification
ceremony in the Stadium, August 11.
They were taken care of at the Red
Cross stations set up. The San Fran
cisco papers, however, reported that
there was no discomfiture from the
heat.
Barbara Lee, '29, won the women's
(golf championship of San Francisco
on July 27, defeating Mrs. H. P. Brad
dock 4 and 3. She was presented with
