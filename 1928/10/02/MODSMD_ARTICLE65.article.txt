# LAWRENCE TIBBETT OPENS LOCAL SEASON
## Sousa, Zimbalist, Matzenauer, S.F. Symphony Orchestra Follow California Baritone on Concert List 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
T AWRENCE TIBBETT, Sousa and his Band, Efrem Zimbalist, Margaret
â€¢*-* Matzenauer, and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, with Alfred
Hertz conducting, make up the third season's program of the Associated
Students Concert Series. The popularity of the artists on the series this year
far exceeds that of previous seasons, and the sale of season tickets has been
exceptionally strong. The fact that the opening concert is given on a "closed
date," a Friday night, October 26, has given an added impetus to the sale.
Lawrence Tibbett, who appears in the opening concert, is a young Cali
fornian who has become the leading baritone of the Metropolitan Opera

Company in New York. Tibbett is in<
every sense an American product. He
was born thirty years ago in the town
of Bakersfield, and received his edu
cation at the Manual Arts High School
in Los Angeles.
STUDENT IN L.A.
As a boy Tibbett developed his act
ing talents in the dramatic depart
ment at Manual Arts under the direc
tion of Maude Howell, now stage di
rector for George Arliss. His vocal
training was gained from every source
available, but much of his study was
the outcome of deep thought alone. A
well-known critic said, "Voice stu
dents need not inquire from whom
Tibbett learned his art. It is genius;
he built it from within himself."
His professional debut on the speak
ing stage was made with a Shakes
pearian Repertory Company. When
he was twenty-three he had placed
to his credit the role of Amonasro in
Verdi's "Aida," sung in the Hollywood
Bowl.
Determining to become an opera
singer, Tibbett went to New York in
1921, and five months after his arrival
in the city he was given a contract
with the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany. Early in his second season an
unprecedented triumph came to him,
and success has attended him since.
A Chicago milkman was arrested
recently for making his rounds in a
dress suit.
The present Canadian coinage was
introduced in ISSB.


Famous American baritone who will
open the 1928-29 A.S.S.U. Concert
Series on October 26 in Pavilion.
