# BABES EXPECTED TO GIVE BRONCS BATTLE SATURDAY
## Great Improvement Shown In Decisive Win Over Santa Rosa J.C. 
### 
Stanford's freshman gridders gave a
good account of themselves Saturday.
They showed a lot of improvement over
the previous week, but they must show
a lot more improvement this week. Han
dicapped as'they will be by the worries
of the first week of college, it will be no
easy task to get into shape to defeat the
strong Santa Clara freshman team, for
reports from that place indicate that the
Santa Gara yearlings are good.
But Saturday's victory has restored the
confidence of numerous skeptics who
moaned sadly every time they glanced
at Coach Husky Hunt trying to make a
football team out of his small squad.
True, there is nothing to wax enthusias
tic about, but it is plain that Husky is
doing great things with the material
which he has.
Substitutes Few
The great problem this year is the lack
of substitutes. Injuries have wrecked
"wonder teams." They would play havoc
with the Stanford freshmen. Husky is
trying to develop all of the men possible
and has had considerable encouragement.
Albert Hunt, a 190-pounder from Santa
Barbara, who started in the line Satur
day instead of James Brooks, played a
good game. He lacks experience but
showed that he can learn fast.
Cadell, probably the fastest man on
the squad, also made a creditable show
ing. Husky expects great things from
Cadell. Jim Kelly, who started at end
instead of Colvin, also displayed ability.
A number of substitutes were used and
they were able to run over as many
scores as the first team, which is en
couraging.
