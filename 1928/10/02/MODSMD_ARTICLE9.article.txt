# DAILY BUSINESS STAFF TRYOUTS TO BEGIN TODAY
## 
### 
Tryouts for positions on the busi
ness staff of the Daily start today to
last for about two weeks. According
to James Frank, business manager of
the Daily, all sophomores who are in
terested in an activity which gives a
salary as well as the experience ac
quired in the work, should report im
mediately.
In the first quarter those who make
the staff will work at collecting ad
vertising copy. Later in the year these
students will do soliciting and mer
chandising work not only in I'alo Alto,
but also in San Francisco. Some ex
perience will be gained in the field of
national advertising.
This year for the first time try
outees will not be limited to the
sophomore class. Freshmen may gain
an extra year of experience by start
ing in their first year of school.
There are four jobs which will be
distributed at the start of the junior
year. Three junior managers are ap
pointed and one bookkeeper; all of
these jobs pay from fifteen to thirty
dollars a month. The final elimination
comes in the senior year when the
business manager is chosen at a sal
ary of seventy-five dollars a month.
Frank announces that all present
staff members who do not report by
5 o'clock today will automatically be
dropped from the staff.
