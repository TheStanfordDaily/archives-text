fk? , BACK TO THE
JPaKSf OLD GRIND
QlSyiQ AGAIN!
TF^^T
And now begins a new term. The old grind
has started again. It looks like a busy season,
too, with football games, classes to hike to,
and the fall visiting to do—a grind in more
ways than one.
And your footwear will notice the activity—
the campus grind is hard on shoes. You'll need
new ones.
We suggest that you drop in and look over our
fall showing of shoes for every occasion. We
can fit you out for every Fall function—with
nationally famous Walk-Overs, Conrads, Rich
ard & Brennans.
