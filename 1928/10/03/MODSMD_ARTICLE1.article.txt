# WARNER HANDS STIFF WORKOUT TO GRID TEAM
## Men May Leave Tomorrow; Oregonians Are Rated Dangerous Foes By Thornhill 
### 
Chuck Smalling, Varsity half
back, sustained an injury which
may prohibit him from playing in
the Oregon game Saturday when
he was kicked on hie right cheek
bone during practice scrimmage
yesterday afternoon. He was
taken to the Palo Alto Hospital
last night where his injury will
be X-rayed this morning to deter
mine its seriousness. Dr. A. P.
Roth believes that the Cardinal
player is not seriously injured
and that he will be able to be on
the field again sometime next
week.
Scrimmage, blocking drill, and more
scrimmageâ€”that is the tonic that Doctor
Warner is prescribing for his team, now
looking forward to meeting the Oregon
University eleven next Saturday at Eu
gene.
Line Coach Tiny Thornhill saw the
Gold and Green outfit trounce the Col
lege of the Pacific last Saturday and he
reports an unusually strong team for the
Cardinals to tackle on their third Satur
day. In preparation for this opposition
Warner's men have been brushing up,
particularly on running interference. The
second string saw an hour and a half
of strenuous scrimmage yesterday after
blocking practice on the dummies. Fleish
hacker, Smalling and Lewis alternated
in calling signals.
Frentrup and Post brought good news
with them to practice. Both men ap
peared on the field dressed in their foot
hall .togs for the first time since their
injuries several days ago. Neither man
participated in active practice, though
Post seems ready for action. Frentrup
still walks with a slight limp, Sims is
still out with a shoulder injury which
may keep him out of Saturday's contest.
It is understood that Warner will take
thirty-three men with him when he leaves
for the north tomorrow afternoon. The
list of men making the trip will probably
be announced at today's practice session.
