# HALLIE KEATING WRITES BOOKLET
## 
### 
Hallie Keating, of the Class of '28,
has made her first break into professional
print in a booklet—"Stanford Hours"—
published by the Sunset Press, San
Francisco, and on sale at the local book
stores. The brochure is composed of the
seven art-photographs, with poetic cap
tions by Miss Keating, that appeared in
last year's Quad.
The spirit of the Stanford campus,
from the morning hours to sunset and
night, is caught by the pictures and
legends. Accompanying each photograph
is a vignette in prose-poetry that sug
gests the human drama of the Quad
and its surroundings.
Miss Keating has been a leader in
campus literary activities, having worked
on The Stanford Literary Magazine,
The Daily, and the 1928 Quad.
