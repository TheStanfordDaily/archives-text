# DAVIS, VOLLAND TAKE LEADS IN FIRST PLAY
## Dick Stewart, Helen Ward To Play Interesting Minor Love Theme 
### 
Robert Sherwood's amusing comedy
satire, "The Queen's Husband," if
previous performances can be used
as a basis of judgment, will present
an opportunity for many interesting
characterizations. Gordon Davis is
playing the role of a weary, henpecked
king browbeaten by a belligerent
wife, played by Virginia Volland. It is
expected that the interpretation of
these two will be the most finished.
Levenworth Colby and Irving Rosen
blatt, however, are expected to fur
nish superior comedy touches.
Colby scored a hit as the quince
faced butler, while Rosenblatt pleased
the former audiences with his playing
of the part of Prince William of
Greek â€”a dissolute prince and a per
fect ass.
Dick Stewart and Helen Ward are
playing an interesting minored love
theme. Dick Stewart did unusual work
in the other two presentations. Miss
Ward should improve upon the role
formerly played by Corrine Franklin.
Humorously Daring Satire
"The Queen's Husband" is a hu
morously daring satire, a take-off on
the rule of modern monarchies. It is
a sophisticated play of the lighter
type and has the outstanding prere
quisite of having a line arrangement
to sustain the interest throughout.
The subject of the satire is of such
general and current interest that a
wide appeal and universal apprecia
tion is insured.
The movement of the play is rapid,
for diplomacy, love, revolutions, and
bombardments can not exist without,
action. The small kingdom is charged
with liberalists, radicals, anarchists,
dissipated princes, and charming
ladies; such combinations give prom
ise of explosive developments and in
teresting character portrayals.
To Use Contrapuntal Lighting
Gordon Davis, in speaking of the
show, said: "This production of 'The
Queen's Husband' is for the student
body. The off-campus audience has
had two opportunities to witness the
production, and I feel that every
preference should be shown to the
students. It is a play that I believe
will please a Stanford audience, for
it has romance, adventure, intrigue,
comedy, and a powerful element of
surprise."
