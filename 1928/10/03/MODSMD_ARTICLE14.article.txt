# Fall Registration Increases Despite Fewer Freshmen
## Reduce Number of 1931-32 Men by One Hundred Under New Rule 
### 
Student enrollment at Stanford will
apparently be somewhat larger this quar
ter than it was during the first quarter
of last year, in spite of the reduction by
one hundred of the number of new Lower
Division men students admitted this term.
The final total at the end of the au
tumn quarter a year ago was 3434, a
figure that • has already been nearly
reached, with a considerable number of
late registrations yet to come.
The Registrar's office last night, at the
close of the second day of registration,
had recorded a registration of 3405 stu
dents, 3302 of whom had fully completed
their enrollment. At the close of the
second day of fall registration last year
the total registration was 3278, of whom
an even 3200 had been fully enrolled.
More than one hundred and fifty names
were added to the lists between the sec
ond day and the end of the quarter last
year, but Registrar J. Pearce Mitchell
points out that it is not safe to predict
too closely what, the final total may be
this year, because a year ago there was
a Sunday intervening, which caused a
larger number of delinquent registrations
than may be expected this year. How
ever, the addition of thirty names to the
present number will carry the enrollment
above the final total of the first quarter
a year ago.
