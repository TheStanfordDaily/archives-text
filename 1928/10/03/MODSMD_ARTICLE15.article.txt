# TRYOUTS STARTED IN DAILY STAFF BUSINESS POSTS
## 
### 
Approximately six tryoutces for the
business staff of the Stanford Daily re
ported yesterday for work which will
continue for a period of two weeks.
James Frank, business manager, requests
all sophomores who are interested in an
activity which gives a salary as well as
the experience acquired in the work
should report immediately.
The first quarter work for the try
outces will be collecting advertising copy.
Later in the year these students will do
soliciting and merchandising work not
only in Palo Alto, but also in San Fran
cisco. Experience will also be gained in
the field of national advertising.
For the first time tryoutees will not be
limited to the sophomore class. Fresh
men may gain a year of experience by
starting in their first year of school.
At the start of the junior year there
are four positions that will be distrib
uted. Three junior managers and one
bookkeeper are appointed; all of which
positions pay from fifteen to thirty dol
lars a month. The final elimination
comes in the senior year when the busi
ness manager is chosen at a salary of
seventy-five dollars a month.
