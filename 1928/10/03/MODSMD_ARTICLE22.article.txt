# RIVAL CLASSES PREPARE FOR ANNUAL CLASH
## Leaders Planning Strategic Campaign for Battle; Meetings Behind Closed Doors 
### 
Secret preparations are reported being
made in both the sophomore and fresh
man camps for the annual class scrap
which will take place tomorrow after
noon at 3 o'clock on the Stadium field.
For the first time in years the clash
between the two rival classes will be in
the form of a tie-up which is a revival
of the old custom that prevailed before
the time of mud-fights.
The mud fight was abolished last Jan
uary and the, tie-up instituted instead as
the annual freshman-sophomore rush
after continued discussion among school
authorities. Before the abolition of hazing
in 1923 the two classes participated in
poster fights, tie-ups, and many other
types of clashes. These were all replaced
by the mud fight on the dry bed of Lagu
nita. The Ex committee abolished the
fights last year because of poor sports
manship and violation of the rules which
contributed to make the fight a failure.
Block "S" men will manage the tie-up
and the rules will be rigidly enforced.
The student body president and managers
of the major sports will act as judges.
Each class will start from a line mid
way between the center of the field and
the goal posts. To be eliminated from
the rush a contestant must be bound hand
and foot, and placed in an enclosure under
the goal posts at the end of the field
from which lie started. The class having
the largest number of unmarked on the
field at the finish shall be declared the
winner.
The freshmen are to buy the rope,
which will be of soft cotton cut in three
foot strips. Shoes worn by the contest
ants must be soft-soled and without hard
cleats.
Frank Lombardi, star L. A. High
sprinter, will lead the class of 1932 in
the clash. The class of 1931 has not yet
held a meeting to decide its leader or
plan of attack.
