# The 						Telephone Mess
## 
### 
One of the most thorough messes into which affairs on the campus
have recently got was explained in yesterday's Daily in the article on
the telephone situation.
Representatives of the halls and of the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company are faced, in their attempt to straighten out the mess,
with two problems: to catch or foil the thieves who have from time to
time been stealing the long distance phones in the halls; and to exhort,
urge or force students not to make dishonest, fraudulent calls over Palo
Alto 2900, the men's dormitory exchange.
Four long distance phones were stripped from the walls of hall phone
booths this summer. Now the instruments are protected by insurance,
but the money in the coin boxes is the telephone company's loss. Here
after that loss will be to the hall clubs. To scotch this thievery simply
means vigilance on the part of the campus police, who in these degenerate
days are becoming one of the most important units of the University.
But the other problem —the prevention of fraud by students —is the
more distressing because it should never have arisen. Forty-eight dollars
was last May and June incurred in tolls by the 2900 exchange, and while
twelve dollars of that amount has been collected from the ones who
placed the calls, the remainder has been assigned to Encina, Toyon, and
Branner clubs for payment. Residents of all men's halls (except Sequoia,
which is on another exchange) are thought to be about equally guilty of
the practice.
The hall clubs have now taken over responsibility for losses, and hence
forth a man's own hall will suffer for what he thoughtlessly or dis
honestly does. That is as it should be, and we hope the members of the
clubs will succeed in catching those who persistently cheat the phones.
Evasion of paying tolls was the partial cause of the men's council ex
pelling a student last summer; if the threat to repeat this punitive action
were made, the trouble would probably die away.
