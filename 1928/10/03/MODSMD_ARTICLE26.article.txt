# Phi Beta Phalls
## 
### 
The scholarship rating for the year was published in yesterday's Daily
and is indeed worthy of comment. In the first place the erudite members
of the Stanford Daily staff ranked number one among the publications
groups, which is one good reason why.
Dope and popular opinion suffered one of the biggest upsets of recent
years when Phi Beta Kappa ,which bears the brunt of many a joke and
keeps the Chappie editor in copy, ranked second. It was not second to
none but second to Phi Lambda Upsilon, chemistry fraternity. This
would lead one to believe that these chemists are an assiduous bunch.
In women's athletics the feminine archers walked away with honors
â€”another time that they hit something they weren't aiming at. The
varsity cagers held down first place among the men athletes, showing
here more ability at passing than they did on the basketball floor.
Gossiping over the scholarship ratings will have to beguile the idle
hours until the new bawlouts are published.
