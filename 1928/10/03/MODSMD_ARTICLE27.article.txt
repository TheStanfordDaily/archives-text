The commencement of a new year on the Daily means appoint
ments of worthy staff members must be made. Accordingly, it is with
pride that the promotion is made of the following five men, all sopho
mores, to copy editors' positions: Jean Blum, William Grace, Marvin
Skipwith, Frank Whitely and Whitney Wright.
Skipwith has a special job as editor of the Associated Press copy; the
other four are to be on general duty as copy editors, who, under the
present organization of the paper, assist the night editors in getting out
copy to the compositors.
The editor would point out that the night editors are listed alphabeti
cally, and not in the order of seniority nor of merit. Copy editors and
reporters are rated each week by a system which takes into consideration
the quality of their writing and of their other work, the number of inches
they have written, and the number of hours they have spent on the Daily.

paper of the Pacific Coast:

Bolshevism is the theory that a stupid man can be a great executive
or great scientist if he gets mad enough.â€”L. A. Times.
