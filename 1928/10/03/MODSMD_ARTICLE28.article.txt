SHADES OF DAYTON
Come one, come all. Buy, buy, buy,
Democracy, man's panacea of all human
ailments, maladjustments, and question
ing of faith. Be it known that the state
of Arkansas will on Election Day pre
sent to the electorate to be settled for
once and for all time the truth or the
falsity of evolution. The voters will read
upon their ballots a proposition dedicated
to the righteous purpose of blotting out
this insidious evolutionary propaganda
which is poisoning the minds of the youth
of the land.
Fundamentalists, Methodists, Baptists,
all leaders of the dyed-in-the-wool re
actionaries will line their forces up on
one side. Liberals, university professors,
business men will be lined up in opposing
phalanx. And the joust will be on. The
hell-fire boys will maintain staunchly

that this "monkey business" must stop,
that never again shall the soul-damaging
theory of man's origin be taught in state
supported schools, that they know the
truth and that the truth has made them
free. Whereas wary princes of Arkansas
commerce will shout loudly that such
ridicule will befall the state should the
anti-evolution proposition become a law
that local industry will suffer sudden
paralytic debility.
Meanwhile tolerant minded people
throughout the land will sit by with
amused smiles and listen attentively to
the raucous yawp of the Arkansas elec
torate in the throes of settling scientific
problems by counting noses. And they
will be reminded of the day not far gone
when the facile tongued Darrow did bat
tle with the spell-binding Bryan over a
similar problem in a nearby state.
