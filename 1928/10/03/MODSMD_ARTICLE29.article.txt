Boy in the Wind. By George Dillon.
(New York: The Viking Press,
1927.)
This isn't going to be a book review,
just a little chat about George Dillon.
Born in 1906, he is now 22 years old and
is already what most of us at times
would like to be (especially when the
moon is full and soft and the frogs are
croaking on Lagunita)—a poet.
He graduated from the University of
Chicago last spring. And that small but
choice volume, Boy in the Wind, is a
collection primarily of what he wrote
during his college career.
Was Editor
While in school Dillon founded The
Forge, a magazine for undiscovered
young poets. Now he is devoting his
time to poetry lectures and readings.
Three years ago, Dillon won the Fisk
prize for undergraduate poetry and also
the Young Poet's Prize offered by
Poetry. All of which shows he has real
ability.
No poet in recent years has succeeded
in capturing the evasive spirit of young
adolescence verging on maturity as has
Dillon. It will be interesting to watch
him as he grows to maturity to see if he
can continue to record as vividly and
truly the spiritual and emotional adven
tures of fuller experience.
One short poem I'm taking the liberty
to print in full. I can remember clipping
it out of a magazine when I was a senior
in high school.
April's Amazing Meaning
April's amazing meaning doubtless lies
In tall, hoarse boys and slips
Of slender girls with suddenly wider eyes
And parted lips;
For girls must wander pensive in the
spring
When the green rain is over,
Doing some slow, inconsequential thing,
Plucking clover;
And any boy alone upon a bench
When his work's done will sit
And stare at the black ground and break
a branch
And whittle it
Slowly; and the boys and girls, irreso
lute,
Will curse the dreamy weather
Until they meet past the pale hedge and
put
Their lips together.
—Clifford F. Weigle.
