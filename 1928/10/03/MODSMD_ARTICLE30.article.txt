# THE 						DRAMA
## "The Royal Family"—Geary. 
### 
First-class comedy worth a trip to the
city to see. A scintillating play, sup
posedly dealing with the private life of
the Barrymores. Edna Ferber and George
S. Kaufman, a pair of fine authors, have
collaborated on this show.
You can believe the billboards' de
scription of the Geary's play, for it is

truly "an hilarious glimpse of a merry,
mad, theatrical family." The action is
very fast, the lines are smart, and the
characterizations excellent.
The Barrymore clan is given the name
of Clavendish in this comedy, but it is
easy to identify Ethel and John and
their equally noted relatives. All three
acts are set in the family's duplex apart
ment in New York City. There is com
motion galore, each member displaying
his temperament at one time or another.
Fine Cast
Emelie Melville plays Fanny Caven
dish, the head of the household, as only
an experienced trouper can. She is per
fect as the cool-headed mainstay of the
brilliant but scatter-brain family. Char
lotte Walker is a lovely Julie (Ethel
Barrymore). At home as well as in the
theatre she acts every minute; every
move is a pose. Miss Walker's voice is
most charming, and she looks very pretty
in her interpretation of America's first
lady of the theater.
Fredric March is a fiery Anthony
(easily identified as John Barrymore)
and draws a great many laughs with his
idiosyncrasies. Kathryn Prather as
Gwen, Julie's daughter, is fine in her
emotional scenes. Helen Bolton, who has
been a favorite of ours ever since we
saw her as the love-lorn wife in "Cradle
Snatchers," is very much among those
present as a quarrelsome relation.
Everything about the royal family re
volves around the theater, and their loy
alty to their work is paramount to every
thing else. They will give you a most
entertaining evening with their continu
ous outbursts of temperamental fireworks.
—Ben Maddox.
"Daddies"—President.
Don't miss this. The funniest show we
have ever seen. We made the mistake
of going to a matinee: consequently we
laughed so hard and so much that we
developed a stomach-ache and had to
forego dinner.
Robert McWade, who is well remem
! bercd as the grouchy father in last year's
hit, "New Brooms," has the leading role
in the President's new comedy. He has
an even better role this time, and he
plays it to perfection. Mr. Duffy has
surrounded him with a thoroughly capa
ble cast, a large one including several
remarkaby clever children.
The story concerns five women-hating
children-abhorring bachelors who are
forccd to adopt war orphans. Eacli bach
elor is awarded an orphan, and the trou
bles they have trying to escape their
children
Miss Doris Phillips, the leading lady,
is a preferable blonde. She is pretty and
very good as the oldest orphan.
"Daddies" is the type of play which
Mr. Duffy has led his audiences to ex
pect, and they will be absolutely de
lighted with the President's show. The

characters are men and women, their
actions and motifs are common to us all.
We recommend this show very highly.
And by the way, have you seen "King
of Kings"? (Not an advertisement.) We
think it one of the most worthwhile
motion pictures to come out of Holly
wood, and well wordi everyone's time.
It is a splendid picturization of the most
stirring and dramatic moments in the
life of Christ.

We recommend this show very highly.
And by the way, have you seen "King
of Kings"? (Not an advertisement.) We
think it one of the most worthwhile
motion pictures to come out of Holly
wood, and well wordi everyone's time.
It is a splendid picturization of the most
stirring and dramatic moments in the
life of Christ.
First-class comedy worth a trip to the
city to see. A scintillating play, sup
posedly dealing with the private life of
the Barrymores. Edna Ferber and George
S. Kaufman, a pair of fine authors, have
collaborated on this show.
You can believe the billboards' de
scription of the Geary's play, for it is

truly "an hilarious glimpse of a merry,
mad, theatrical family." The action is
very fast, the lines are smart, and the
characterizations excellent.
The Barrymore clan is given the name
of Clavendish in this comedy, but it is
easy to identify Ethel and John and
their equally noted relatives. All three
acts are set in the family's duplex apart
ment in New York City. There is com
motion galore, each member displaying
his temperament at one time or another.
Fine Cast
Emelie Melville plays Fanny Caven
dish, the head of the household, as only
an experienced trouper can. She is per
fect as the cool-headed mainstay of the
brilliant but scatter-brain family. Char
lotte Walker is a lovely Julie (Ethel
Barrymore). At home as well as in the
theatre she acts every minute; every
move is a pose. Miss Walker's voice is
most charming, and she looks very pretty
in her interpretation of America's first
lady of the theater.
Fredric March is a fiery Anthony
(easily identified as John Barrymore)
and draws a great many laughs with his
idiosyncrasies. Kathryn Prather as
Gwen, Julie's daughter, is fine in her
emotional scenes. Helen Bolton, who has
been a favorite of ours ever since we
saw her as the love-lorn wife in "Cradle
Snatchers," is very much among those
present as a quarrelsome relation.
Everything about the royal family re
volves around the theater, and their loy
alty to their work is paramount to every
thing else. They will give you a most
entertaining evening with their continu
ous outbursts of temperamental fireworks.
—Ben Maddox.
"Daddies"—President.
Don't miss this. The funniest show we
have ever seen. We made the mistake
of going to a matinee: consequently we
laughed so hard and so much that we
developed a stomach-ache and had to
forego dinner.
Robert McWade, who is well remem
! bercd as the grouchy father in last year's
hit, "New Brooms," has the leading role
in the President's new comedy. He has
an even better role this time, and he
plays it to perfection. Mr. Duffy has
surrounded him with a thoroughly capa
ble cast, a large one including several
remarkaby clever children.
The story concerns five women-hating
children-abhorring bachelors who are
forccd to adopt war orphans. Eacli bach
elor is awarded an orphan, and the trou
bles they have trying to escape their
children
Miss Doris Phillips, the leading lady,
is a preferable blonde. She is pretty and
very good as the oldest orphan.
"Daddies" is the type of play which
Mr. Duffy has led his audiences to ex
pect, and they will be absolutely de
lighted with the President's show. The

characters are men and women, their
actions and motifs are common to us all.
