October 2nd.
Did spend a most exciting day going
about looking for the future classrooms,
in which I will listen to the courses for
which I have enrolled. Was much per
turbed in finding the library, having been
told it was a large building with cars
outside, but albeit have not yet developed
a sense of direction, did go into building
answering same description, but did find
myself in the midst of many young men,
so did come away with much dispatch.
Was told later it was Encina.
Have decided I must buy me a car,
with the long distances, but have ob
served so many arterial stops about that
I vow it would be quicker to walk many
places than to drive. Also did write
mother to send me woolen hose, inasmuch
as the chairs about the campus do not
seem to be upholstered with anything but
nails.
To dance at night given by the Stan
ford Daily, and was much amazed to
find my young escort took me first to sec
Billie Dove, whom I do despise and to
the dance very late. Observing the early
hours at which the young ladies must
retire, was surprised that dances did not
begin earlier, but when observed floor
upon which we danced, did understand
same convention. Do think, however, that
what with having to return at ten-thirty
and twelve-thirty, daylight saving hours
would be much nicer.
Did find music very fine, but was much
hurt that the many boys about the floor
did not make a move to cut in, although
did notice that they seemed to be talking
about me. Which was unmannerly but
flattering.
Am much perturbed over what to wear
to the freshman reception next Friday,
inasmuch as it is said to be informal. Do
suppose, however, that that means the
men may wear what they please, and the
women wear their most becoming dresses.
Was told that one either had a very
good time or a very poor time, depending
upon how early in the evening one's feet
were trodden upon. And so to bed, anx
ious for classes tomorrow, where 1 shall
wear my new tweed suit.

upon which we danced, did understand
same convention. Do think, however, that
what with having to return at ten-thirty
and twelve-thirty, daylight saving hours
would be much nicer.
Did find music very fine, but was much
hurt that the many boys about the floor
did not make a move to cut in, although
did notice that they seemed to be talking
about me. Which was unmannerly but
flattering.
Am much perturbed over what to wear
to the freshman reception next Friday,
inasmuch as it is said to be informal. Do
suppose, however, that that means the
men may wear what they please, and the
women wear their most becoming dresses.
Was told that one either had a very
good time or a very poor time, depending
upon how early in the evening one's feet
were trodden upon. And so to bed, anx
ious for classes tomorrow, where 1 shall
wear my new tweed suit.
