A college student is an optimist. He
feels that half a loaf is better than no
loaf at all.
After reading the Sunday newspaper
(we soon dropped off to sleep, weary of it
all) we became imbued with the healthy,
American spirit of the thing. For in
stance, there were the
SOCIETY NOTKS
The first families were all agog this
morning just after breakfast (a hearty
one, with waffles and ge-dunked
doughnuts) at the rumored engagement
of Mr. Ray L. Rhodes, prominent

stevedore, and Miss Zenobia L. Mc-
Sweeny, sliced pickle queen. Dan Cu
pid must l>e busy this month, for here
it is only Tuesday (come Michaelmas)
and forty-seven engagements have been
reported from what we are pleased to
call the "younger set." When Mr.
Rhodes leads the blushing bride-to-be
to the altar for the halter, the bridal
train will consist of fourteen (14) stev
edores bearing roseblossoms and scat
tering wild oats to and fro. Rice will
not be used, due to an aversion of Miss
McSweeney to what she calls "the
oriental peoples." The train will con
tain the usual caboose.
