# ENCINA HAS PAST; HISTORY EXTENDS BACK 37 YEARS
## First Hall Three Stories, Accommodated 300 Men Of All Classes 
### 
The Encina Hall that opened its
doors for the first time thirty-seven
years ago was a very different look
ing building from the one that will
be occupied this year by the men of
the class of 1932. At that time the
hall was a three-story building ac
commodating only 300 men.
Along with the other original build
ings on the campus, Encina was com
pleted in the summer of 1891, and
was first occupied on October 1 of
that year when Stanford University
was officially opened.
Encina Club was founded a few
years later after several other meth
ods for controlling the students
proved unsuccessful. The hall at this
time the only men's dormitory
on the campus, and as such was an
important center of the University
life.
Quake Is Disastrous
The big earthquake of 1906, which
proved so disastrous to the rest of the
campus, did very little damage to
Encina Hall, though it was here that
one of the two Stanford fatalities oc
curred. Two high stone chimneys fell,
crashing through the rooms below to
the basement and carrying with them
twelve students who happened to be
underneath. One of these students
was killed, and the others injured.
It was in the reconstruction period
which followed that the fifth floor and
the "bull pen," so called, were added
and the rooms in the basement were
made available for use. With these
additions, Encina now houses between
five and six hundred men.
In 1923 with the completion of the
other halls on the campus, Encina
became the freshman dormitory and
the sponsor system was started. The
fifth floor is now occupied by upper
classmen, the freshmen occupying the
rest of the building.
