# PERSIAN WOMAN REGISTERS WITH JUNIOR STANDING
## 
### 
Marzieh Nabil, from Teheran, the
Capital of Persia, has registered at
Stanford with junior standing. Having
traveled widely in Persia, Turkey,
Russia, and other parts of the Near
East, with a knowledge of many for
eign languages, she comes to Stan
ford with a keen appreciation of its
international spirit, and efforts for
world peace.
"I am much interested in Interna
tionalism, and am a member of the
Bahaist movement, of which one of
the chief tenets is an international
outlook," she stated. In choosing
schools in this country, she has em
ployed the same principle, she de
clared. Her freshman year was spent
at Vassar, and last year she attended
Mills College.
Miss Nabil is the daughter of Dr.
Ali-Kuli Khan, who was Persian am
bassador to the United States during
Roosevelt's and Wilson's administra
tions. Miss Nabil accompanied him
when he left that position to attend
the Versailles Peace Conference. Her
name differs from that of her father,
due to the Persian custom that the
children take the first part of the
parent's court title. Dr. Khan was
titled, Nabil-ed-Dowleh, for his ser
vices to Persia, but is also a member
of the nobility by right of birth.
Boston is the home of Miss Nabil's
mother, but the family is now living
in Berkeley. The family is now chiefly
interested in a Persian art center in
San Francisco.
