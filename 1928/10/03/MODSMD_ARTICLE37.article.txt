# YANKS, CARDS READY; PITCHING VITAL POINT
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 2. (JP))— Pitching
has played a predominant part in the
decision of the World Series through
the baseball ages, and the star box
men largely have run true to form.
In the impending battle between the
Cardinals and the Yankees, however,
two frayed and overworked staffs will
be pitted against each other, and the
big question is whether the rival
hurlers will be able to match the
form they have shown through the
regular campaign.
St. Louis Twirlers Set
Although Miller Huggins says his
pitching "will take care of itself,"
any edge in the box rests with the
Cardinals. Jess Haines had an erratic
season, but finished with nine straight
victories and eight complete games.
He "figures" as the Cardinal starter,
even against a crew of left-handed
maulers such as the Yankees.
Wee Willie Sherdel lost two tough
games to Pennock in the 1926 series,
which is one good reason for suppos
ing that he will win this time. If there
is any justice in the law of overages,
Willie will take the close ones in the
forthcoming battle.
Old Alex the Great is 41 instead of
39, but he is still Alex the Great —
and many of the Yankees remember
it. Another veteran, Clarence Mitchell,
the southpaw spitballer, has a mean
way of making strong batsmen weep
over that dinky curve. He "hasn't got
a thing" but many clubs can't hit it,

***particularly the Giants.
Yank Staff Weak

Against this array, Miller Huggins
must hurl an overworked Hoyt, an
uncertain Pipgras, a veteran Zachary
—and no Pennock at all. The Cardi
nals will depend upon the above-men
tioned quartet to start all games, and
Huggins will be tempting a fate of
which he already is suspicious if he
ventures.
Julius Rosenwald is said to have
profited to the extent of $25,000,000
through his interest in Sears, Roe
buck & Company.
The Gorgas Memorial Institute is
planning a study of the prevention
of malaria.

big question is whether the rival
hurlers will be able to match the
form they have shown through the
regular campaign.
St. Louis Twirlers Set
Although Miller Huggins says his
pitching "will take care of itself,"
any edge in the box rests with the
Cardinals. Jess Haines had an erratic
season, but finished with nine straight
victories and eight complete games.
He "figures" as the Cardinal starter,
even against a crew of left-handed
maulers such as the Yankees.
Wee Willie Sherdel lost two tough
games to Pennock in the 1926 series,
which is one good reason for suppos
ing that he will win this time. If there
is any justice in the law of overages,
Willie will take the close ones in the
forthcoming battle.
Old Alex the Great is 41 instead of
39, but he is still Alex the Great —
and many of the Yankees remember
it. Another veteran, Clarence Mitchell,
the southpaw spitballer, has a mean
way of making strong batsmen weep
over that dinky curve. He "hasn't got
a thing" but many clubs can't hit it,

***particularly the Giants.
Yank Staff Weak

Against this array, Miller Huggins
must hurl an overworked Hoyt, an
uncertain Pipgras, a veteran Zachary
—and no Pennock at all. The Cardi
nals will depend upon the above-men
tioned quartet to start all games, and
Huggins will be tempting a fate of
which he already is suspicious if he
ventures.
Julius Rosenwald is said to have
profited to the extent of $25,000,000
through his interest in Sears, Roe
buck & Company.
The Gorgas Memorial Institute is
planning a study of the prevention
of malaria.
