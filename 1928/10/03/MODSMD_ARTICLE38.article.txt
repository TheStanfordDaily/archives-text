# SPORTS OF 1928
## A 						Clouting Catcher 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
When the Giants traded Rogers Horns
by to Boston for Francis Hogan and
Jimmy Walsh, there was much hulla
baloo about McGraw getting stung, and
that Hogan and Welsh weren't worth
the mighty Rajah's little finger. Latest
averages released show that the two for
mer Braves have had much to do with
keeping the McGraw man in the pennant
race—Hogan with a batting average of
.339 and Welsh with a mark of .308 —
but Mr. Hogan gave a certain definite
demonstration of his fitness as a suc
cessor to Hornsby one afternoon not so
long ago, when the Cards were playing
a double-header at the Polo Grounds be
fore 50,000 yelling fans.
Though the Giants lost the first game
of the "croocial" series, 8 to 5, Hogan
nevertheless distinguished himself with
two hits, one of them a home run with

one on. In the second game, he also
got two hits ,one a homer, but his sec
ond four-base wallop easily made him
the biggest figure of the day from a
New York viewpoint, in deeds as well as
pounds. (Hogan weighs about 225.) Just
as Bob Meusel had won the second game
of the double-header that the other New
York team had played with the Athletics
a week or so previous, with a home run
in the eighth inning with the bases full,
so J. Francis Hogan, of the Boston Ho
gans, hit the ball into the stands with
three mates aboard, and beat the Cardi
nals 7 to 4.
That one blow kept the Giants in the
pennant race, and if they get into the
world series, as they have a chance to
do at this writing, they can thank the
good catching and timely hitting of their
colossal catcher, Frank Hogan of Som
erville, Mass.
