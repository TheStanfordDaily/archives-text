# SEVENTY-YARD PASS RECALLED
## 
### 
The most famous forward pass in
the history of American football was
made in the game played between
California and Ohio State in the fall
of 1920. Standing on his own thirty
yard line, Harold P. Muller, of the
California eleven, threw the pigskin
70 yards to the enemy goal line where
Howard W. Stephens picked it from
the air for a perfect touchdown.
A three-year course in practical avia
tion will be offered by the evening
engineering division and the exten
sion service at New York University
this year.
Public schools cost New York City
$125,258,403 during 1927.
