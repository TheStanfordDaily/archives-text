### 
NAPLES, Italy, Oct. 2. (/P)â€”Gene
Tunney radioed bis fiancee, Miss
Mary Josephine Lauder, today that
their marriage must take place in
either Rome or Naples unless she
wishes to have it delayed by further
red tape.
Miss Lauder had sent him a mes
sage from the motorship Saturnia
suggesting that he join her on board
the ship and continue on to Trieste
in an effort to avoid publicity. Tun
ney, who has been battling for sev
eral days with the aid of the Ameri
can Ambassador and consuls, to ob
tain the necessary permissions for an
immediate marriage here or in Rome,
appeared a bit staggered at the pros
pect of having to repeat the waiting
upon civil and Catholic authorities in
another province.
All travelers by air in Spain must
insure against the risk of accidents.
