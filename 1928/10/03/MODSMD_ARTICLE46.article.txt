# MAE MURRAY PRETTIER. STILL DIPLOMATIC DANCER CAPITALIZES ON PERSONALITY TRIES TO PLAY UP TO HER AUDIENCES
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
Mae Murray is the girl who makes
Old Man Personality pay and -pay and
pay. She is dancing at the Pantages
Theatre in San Francisco this week,
and the "in person" sign out in front
is dragging huge crowds in.
Backstage she gave me my first
"repeat" interview —I wrote a story
for the Daily about her last Novem
ber when she was appearing at the
Granada. She is prettier than ever
this year, still as scrupulously polite
and diplomatic, and still as charm
ingly superficial.
"When I dance I forget everything
else," she told me in a perfectly seri
out and impressive tone. "Music is the
most important thing in life to me."
Trys to Please
Just the same she keeps a keen
eye on the box office and knows what
the public wants. "I used to go around
to as many of the theatres as I could
when my pictures were showing to
get the audience reaction," she said.
"I try to please the audience, not to
give them what I like best myself.
"I always considered myself as
'She' and tried to judge my pictures
in an impartial manner. Sometimes I
liked what 'She' did, and again I dis
approved."
Miss Murray is not over-enthusias
tic about talking movies. "Silence is
what made the movies so popular.
And it will be very hard for picture
people to learn to speak correctly."
She has a well-modulated voice her
self, but has no intention of going
on the speaking stage as so many
Hollywood people are doing.
"There are so many widely different
likes and dislikes that I don't think
we should speak unfavorably against

those actors who do not please us
personally. I am a great movie fan
myself, but I don't criticize those who
do not appeal to me. They have their
admirers or they would not be where
they are.
"I will probably do Denison Clift's
'Guns of Gait' in about six months,"
she explained when I asked her about
the story she purchased a year ago
from Mr. Clift, who is a Stanford
I graduate.
Is Distinct Type
Miss Murray told me that it was
her work as co-star with Leon Errol
in the Ziegfield Follies of 1915 that
won her her first movie contract. She
has been a screen star ever since,
specializing in gorgeous costumes and
bizarre roles. A distinct type, she
dances through each picture—always
the golden-haired, sophisticated dar
ling. She strongly denied my insinua
ation that she was Mae Murray no
matter what role she played. "I as
sume an entirely different characteri
zation in each film —my roles have
very different," she said.
Her biggest hit was "The Merry
Widow," and she dances the famous
waltz on the Pantages stage. She
made no mention of her 16-months-old
baby. You will recall that her hus
band, Prince David Mdivani, an
nounced several months ago that they
had an heir over a year old. Nothing
had been known of the Murray heir
before, and nothing has been said
since. Deep silence reigns on the sub
ject.
At the time Will Rogers remarked,
"Leave it to Mae Murray to hand
Hollywood a thrill. It's a feat —even
in Beverly Hills —to have a 16-months
old baby."
