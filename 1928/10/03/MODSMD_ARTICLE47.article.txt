# CLAIM SOUSA EPITOMIZES SPIRIT OF U. S. IN "MARCH KING" HERE NOV. 6
##

"More than builders of empire, more
than presidents and statesmen, John
Philip Sousa epitomizes the spirit of
America," said H. D. Carew in speaking
of the "March King" who will direct his
band at Stanford November 6 when the
second A.S.S.U. Concert Series occurs.
Sousa has ever been identified with the
American spirit, and perhaps the best
known of his compositions is "Stars and
Stripes Forever," which is a product of
his own patriotic feeling. This march has
become associated with America's na
tional anthem, and many times people
arise at attention when it is played, just
as when the "Star Spangled Banner"
rings through the air.
For fifty years Sousa has been con
ductor and composer. This year brings
about his golden jubilee tour. It will be
the twentieth transcontinental tour of the
band and the thirty-sixth in point of
actual consummation.
Born in 1854
Sousa was born in Washington in 1854,
the son of a Portuguese father and a
Bavarian mother. Early in his manhood
Sousa became a violinist of promising

ability. His father was a member of the
U. S. Marine Rand for many years, hav
ing joined that organization in 1850.
Thirty years after this his son was
called upon to be its director and during
the following twelve years made its fame
world-wide.
In 1892 Sousa resigned to organize
Souza's Band, and this is the same or
ganization that is touring the country to
appear at Stanford on November 6.
The American bandmaster will be re
membered long as a composer of marches.
He has a genius for music and a genius
for friendship. He was on intimate terms
with four presidents of the country. He
closes the pages of his book, "Marching
Along," with the statement: "I hope
that long after my marches have been
forgotten, the clarion call of America
which I have tried to rmike the keynote
of my compositions will continue to in
spire her children with undying loyalty."
Steamship companies are protest
ing against the habit of dropping
presents by airplane to vessels wait
ing in quarantine.
