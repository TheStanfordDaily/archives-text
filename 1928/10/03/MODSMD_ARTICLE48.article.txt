# MUNICH PAINTING NOW DISPLAYED AT ART GALLERY
## Famous Picture Is Added to Stanford Collection as Memorial Loan 
### 
Presented as a memorial loan to the
University comes the famous painting,
"The Trial of Constance de Beverly,"
by Toby E. Rosenthal to the Stanford
Art Gallery. The picture, which has
been placed in the first room of the
Gallery, was shipped to the campus from
Munich early in September.
This new addition to the Stanford col
lection was given by Mrs. Alice Scott
tonight Smith and her brother, Laurance
Smith, in memory of her father, the late
Irving M. Scott, who was a member of
the original board of trustees of the Uni
versity. The picture is valued at $20,-
000, and is one of the outstanding ex
amples of the artist's work.
Studied in Germany
Toby Rosenthal was born in Connecti
cut in 1848, and came to California in
1855. His early art training was re
ceived in San Francisco and he continued
his studies in Germany at Munich. Rosen
thal taught and painted in San Francisco.
"The Trial of Constance de Beverly"
is a large canvas representing the climax
of the trial of Constance, the perjured
nun of Scott's "Marmion." Constance
was a member of a convent who disre
garded her nun's vows to join Marmion's
train as a horse boy. As a penalty for
this act she was walled in alive in the
dungeon beneath the convent.
The scene represents Constance facing
her former sisters who lend sombreness
and severity to the tone by their black
robes and stern faces. Dramatically the
picture is masterful as it shows the mo
ment when Constance's robe is thrown
back revealing her man's clothing. The
technique of the artist is very fine and a
close examination reveals the great care
and love the artist had for his work.
