## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2. (A 3 )— Three
racqueters of France, who swept to
easy wins through their first day's
matches, today were the targets at
which ambitious players in the Pacific
Southwest Tennis Championship
Tourney aimed their best volleys.
Without being greatly extended,
the three French Davis Cup team
members, Henri Cochet, Christian
Boussus, and Pierre Landry, scored
four impressive victories in their
opening play in the tournament yes
terday. Each rang up singles victories
and Boussus and Landry turned in a
doubles win.
Breakers showed ahead for the
Frenchmen, however, for the Ameri
can players who had just finished
three days of drubbing the British
Cup players also came through their
tournament contests in easy fashion
and are favorites to battle it out with
the foreign invaders for the title.
Johnny Doeg, 21-year-old Santa
Monica player, John Van Ryn, for
mer Princeton captain, and Keith
Gledhill, Santa Barbara youngster,
all advanced to the fourth round
with victories over important
contenders.
Cochet didn't have to extend him
self to win over Edward Smith, Los
Angeles player, 6-2, 6-2 yesterday and
scarcely looked like a world's cham
pion. He is not a sensational player
of the Tilden type, nor does he bound
about the court like his famous coun
tryman, Jean Borotra, but he out
guessed his opponent consistently on
returns and his unhurried progress
around the court made difficult shots
look easy. Virtually every game went
to deuce, partly through Smith's ef
forts and partly through Cochet's fre
quent errors.
Twenty-year-old Boussus played
beautiful tennis to defeat P. R. Wil
liams of Los Angeles, a fair player,
6-0, 6-2. Landry had only a light work
out in triumphing over Mead Wood
son of Los Angeles, whom he hope
lessly outclassed 6-1, 6-1. The in
vaders' doubles team defeated E.
Smith and Joe Bixler of Los Angeles
6-2, 6-3.
University and holder with Alan
Herrington of the National Inter
collegiate doubles championship,
played his first match of the
tournament today, taking on two
opponents within a few minutes
of each other. He defeated E. C.
Pumphrey, 6-0, 6-1, and Gerald
Kerr, 6-2, 6-1.
Doeg struck some strong com
petition in R. Belmonte, but up
held the tennis honor of the fa
mous family of Bundy and won
6-3, 8-6. Van Ryn kept pace by
defeating Dick Ruscher, Los An
geles, 6-1, 6-1, while Gledhill won
from Earl Pederson, Glendale,
8-10, 6-4, 6-1.
In the women's singles, Mme.
Cochet, wife of the French racquet
ace, won over Mabel Reed of Los
Angeles, 6-0, 6-2. Mrs. Anne McCune
Harper of San Francisco, a finalist in
the recent national women's doubles
championships, defeated Helen Mar
lowe of Hollywood, 6-2, 6-1. Playing
her first match, Peggy Stratford of
San Francisco won from Lily Harris
of Los Angeles, 6-0, 6-4.

of the Tilden type, nor does he bound
about the court like his famous coun

Twenty-year-old Boussus played
beautiful tennis to defeat P. R. Wil
