# BRAND MILK BOOST UNFAIR; LIE HURLED IN UNION PRICE WAR
## 
### 
Is seven cents fair?
That was the question being
asked by angry groups every
where about the campus last
night when the news was spread
abroad that the Union stores had
boosted the price of a glass of
milk from six to seven cents.
"Price boosting is our only re
course," declared Union authori
ties when pinned down to mak
ing a statement upon the issue.
"The University has forced us to
buy milk from the (insert-name
of dairy), whose butterfat con
tent is higher than that of our
present supply. However, it's so
dang much trouble making
change that we would prefer
the price to be either ten or five
cents â€”preferably ten."
"Preferably five," was the re
joinder of Bill Barclau, spokes
man for the enraged patrons.
And that is where the matter
stood at a late hour last night,
with ugly rumors being bruited
about that the Union's next move
would be to install undunkable
doughnuts.
