# Hagen Ties For Fourth In First Round Of Golf Meet
## 
### 
BALTIMORE, Oct. 2. (>P)â€”Unless
Walter Hagen can break the spell of
a jinx hole, which forced him to take
a seven both times he has tried it in
the National Professional Golf Asso
ciation championship tournament, the
end of the week may find him minus
the title he has worn for the last
four years in a row.
Those disastrous sevens on the
tenth hole of the Five Farms course
of the Baltimore Country Club over
which the tourney is being played
cost him a chance for the medal or at
least for runner-up honors in the 36-
hole qualifying round, which opened
the Bix-day competition yesterday.
As it turned out, the medal went to
A1 Espinosa, gaily plumaged and self

confident golfer from the Illinois
Country Club with a brilliant 142, but
given par fours on his two tries at
that bad tenth, Sir Walter might
have saved six strokes and given A1
a run for his money. The weight of
those sorrowful sevens, however,
shoved the Haig's total up to 150
and a tie with two others for fourth
place.
