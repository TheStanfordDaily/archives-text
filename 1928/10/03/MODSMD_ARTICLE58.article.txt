# SAN FRANCISCO GRAND OPERA
## 
### 
A record crowd hailed Maria Jeritza
singing Bizet's Carmen in the Dreamland
Auditorium in San Francisco last night,
exceeding previous occasions both in
numbers and enthusiasm.
Jeritza gave such an original interpre
tation of the Spanish cigarette-factory
worker that, with Armand Tokatyan and
Ezio Pinza, who played the parts of Don
Jose and Escamillo, she had to answer
to seven or eight curtain calls between
each act.

The inseparable operatic twins, "Caval
leria Rusticana" and "1 Pagliacci," will
be presented tonight as the twelfth and
final performance of the season.
Elda Vettori, young St. Louis soprano
who has the distinction of having sung
in nine principal roles at the Metropoli
tan Opera House since her debut two
years ago at the New York opera, will
sing the leading soprano roles in both
performances tonight. .
This fact in itself is an unusual fea
ture of the closing night, for it is seldom
that the same artist sings both Santuzza
in "Cavalleria" and Nedda in "Pagliacci"
in the same evening.

A keen point ot interest in the "Pag
liacci" hill tonight will center on the
singing of the famous prologue by I-aw
rence Tibbett. Kdward Johnson will sing
the tenor role of Canio. In "Cavalleria"
the tenor role of Turiddu will be sung
by Gennaro llarra, and the baritone,
Mercado, has been chosen as Alho.
A Mississippian was fined $300 and
given sixty days for selling wine to
the sheriff.
Four Spaniards efttablished a world
leap-frog record with a distance of
18% miles.
