renewed at 8 per cent and advanced to 9
as hanks called $35,000,000 in loans.
Bankers reported, however, that the peak
of the stringency incidental to the un
usually heavy quarterly disbursement had
passed, and that lower rates were likely
later in the week. Wall Street appeared
to he plainly disturbed by the criticism
directed against the large volume of
credit absorbed by securities collateral by
speakers at the annual convention of the
American Bankers Association in Phila
delphia. One of the bright spots in the
day's crcdit news was the announcement
that an additional shipment of $2,500,000
in gold was on the way from London to
New York, and that further imports were
likely before the end of the month.
