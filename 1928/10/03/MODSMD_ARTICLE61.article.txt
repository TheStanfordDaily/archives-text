ROCHESTER, Oct. 2 (/P) â€”Franklin
D. Roosevelt, former assistant secretary
of the navy, was nominated by acclama
tion for governor of New York by the
Democratic State convention today.
Great enthusiasm greeted the presenta
tion of Mr. Roosevelt's name to the con
vention by Mayor James J. Walker of
New York, who made the nominating
speech. Seconding speeches were made
by former Lieut. Gov. George R. Lunn,
an aspirant for the nomination, and Mrs.
Daniel O'Day .vice chairman of the state
committee.
Mayor Walker said Mr. Roosevelt had
many of the same characteristics as Gov
ernor Smith, and would give the state an
honest, fearless administration.
Selection of Mr. Roosevelt came some-!
thing as a surprise, for only yesterday,!
shortly after he had arrived here from [
his western tour, Governor Smith made [
public a telegram from him saying that !
he could not run on account of his health.
Mr. Roosevelt had been urged many
times to enter the race but each time lie
refused. He has been suffering from in
fantile paralysis for several years and
is at present in the South for the benefit
of his health.

There has been a warm attachment be
tween the governor and Mr. Roosevelt
for many years. It was Roosevelt who
nominated Smith for the presidency at
Madison Square Garden and at Houston.
The announcement of his selection was
! made about 1 o'clock this morning. The
1 governor, after his speech before the
I convention last night, called the leaders
into his suite at the Hotel Seneca for the
: third of a scries of conferences during
the day. After an hour and a half be
hind closed doors, M. William Bray of
Utica, the new state chairman, came from
the conference room and said:
"There seems to be a unanimous de
mand from the delegates to this conven
tion for Mr. Roosevelt"
