CHICAGO, Oct. 2 (J-P) â€”Having kept ;
the records of tens of thousands of stu-j
dents at the University of Chicago for j
35 years, Frederick J. Gurney at the age
of 72 has decided to see how the Uni
versity looks from the classroom. Age
compelling his retirement as recorder, he i
was enrolled today as a student.
"I thought I'd get some of this educa
tion I have been watching here ever since
the University was established," he said.
He plans to "brush up" on foreign lan
guages which he studied a generation ago i
at the University of Michigan.
