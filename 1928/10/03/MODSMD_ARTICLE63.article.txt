# Trojans Ready for O.S.C.; Jones Snaps Up Practice
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2.(^)â€” Varsity I
football practice at the University of
Southern California won't be in the
nature of a pleasant outing this week.
A little nettled by his team's ragged
showing against the Utah Aggies last j
Saturday, Coach Howard Jones of the
Trojan varsity indicated by yester
day's session with his men that he
thinks the only way to stave off de
feat at the hands of Oregon State -
next Saturday is to make his squad ,
work like the Trojans of old.
Jones' new plays which kept the
varsity squad working until the
shades of night had been completely
pulled down last night, are based on !
his familiar basic formation. His J
"specialized" system of offense, with
the quarterback doing the lion's share !
of the ball-packing, will probably re- i
main unchanged.
