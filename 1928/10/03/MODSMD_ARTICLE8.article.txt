# Palo Alto School Of Aviation Gets More Equipment
## Chiappino, Walton, Prior Join Faculty; Thirty-Five in Flying Courses 
### 
Seven modern airplanes, five active in
structors, the finest landing fields in Cali
fornia, and a nearly fog-proof climate
are points of note at the Palo Alto School
of Aviation now, as a result of extension
since spring. -
Helping Lieutenant Norman A. God
dard and Lieutenant W. Harry Brown
with flying instruction is Lieutenant Law
rence J. Chiappino. Lieutenant Com
mander Arthur S. Welton is navigation
instructor, and Leland S. Prior, '20, has
charge of motors.
Two monocoupcs ,with Velie motors,
are used with the Wright Whirlwind
powered "Gypsy" monoplane for advance
training. Moye Stephens, relief pilot, has
a Travelair biplane which is kept at the
field, and a third Waco 10 completes the
fleet.
Three Runways
There are three runways on the land
ing field, one of them four thousand feet
long, and smoo'th and even as possible.
It is not the longest run in the state, but
the longest level one.
A new hangar is to he constructed this
fall near the present shed. This will in
crease the field's housing capacity from
seven to fourteen planes, providing fa
cilities for visiting pilots. This need was
shown when Col. Charles A. Lindbergh
visited here twice this year.
Government statistics for the last thirty
years show an average of one and one
quarter days of fog per year. The Palo
Alto field has less trouble from fog, the
flyer's biggest fear, than any other city
around the bay, according to the report.
A plane of Waco design is to be built
by the students this year, starting in two
weeks time. There are thirty-five en
rolled, several of them business men, as
compared with a total enrollment of
eighteen at the beginning of summer.
