After the cheering
THE great stadium seems a living thing, swaying, swinging,
moving with each play on the field. When the last fan has gone
and there remains only crumpled programs and bits of torn tickets,
the stadium takes on another aspect â€”cold, strong, gigantic, its
empty seats rising row upon row.
Have you ever stopped to consider what it means to build a
stadium? More than concrete, more than steel and cement go
into it. Knowledge of climatic conditions, drainage conditions, sub
soil. Knowledge of engineering and construction. For the stadium
must be as permanent as a power plant or dam.
Stone & Webster's engineers design and build stadiums, power
plants, factories. Twenty millions of people are now supplied with
light and power furnished by stations built by Stone & Webster.
The story doesn't end with construction. Stone & Webster
finances utility and industrial concerns, and operates gas, electric
and transportation companies in many parts of the world. You'll
find the Stone & Webster organization is worth knowing and worth
doing business with.
