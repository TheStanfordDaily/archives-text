# WARNER PICKS PLAYERS FOR OREGON GAME
## Webfooters Are Pointed For Cardinals as Squad of Thirty-Three Leaves This Afternoon 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
When the northbound train leaves
Palo Alto this afternoon at 4:30
o'clock it will have as passengers
some thirty-six men with a single
thought in mind—that of defeating
Coach MeEwan's Oregon University
grid eleven next Saturday at Eugene.
Pop Warner, Tiny Thornhill, Manager
Johnny Long, and thirty-three players
are making the trip and will arrive in
the territory of invasion tomorrow
noon.
The players making the trip are
Captain Hoffman, Rothert and Sim
kins, fullbacks; Frentrup, Sims, Iliese,
Winnek, Clark, Marks, and Wilton,
halfbacks; Pleishhacker, Smalling,
and Lewis, quarters; Worden, Har
der, Bush, Davidson, Albertson, and
Muller, ends; Sellman, Artman, Kla
bau, Bogue, and Tandy, tackles; Ro
besky, Post, Driscoll, I-leiser, Forster,
and Ingram, guards; Heinecke, Cook,
and Vermilya, centers.
Webfooters Pointed
The fact that the Cardinal ship has
sailed through a number of seasons
without a single Conference defeat
makes the Webfooters thrill with glee
to think that they are to have the
pleasure of meeting so formidable a
crew while, according to tradition and
past records, it has not reached its
peak of seasonal strength. In addition,
the Webfooters feels that it is a tar
get well worth aiming at to trip up a
team whose name will be so widely
heralded about the nation in Decem
ber when it meets the pride of the
East, West Point's powerful Cadet
eleven. However, the Stanford team
realizes what an attractive target it
is, and the boys from the Farm are
prepared to convince the Gold and
Green outfit quietly but firmly that
their guests intend being on the long
end of the score when the final gun
shot is heard in the northern stadium.
Tiny Thornhill, after witnessing
Oregon's victory over College of the
Pacific last week, reports that the
Warner team is going to meet stiffer
competition from its opponent than it
has from that source for many sea
sr«ns. Oregon shows great improve
ment over the team that the Cards
humbled here last year by a 19-0
score. They are particularly strong in
running plays, Thornhill says.
The Redshirts have trained for Sat
urday's game with a week of strenu
ous practice, a great deal of which
has consisted of scrimmaging. Yester
day the first and second teams in
scrimmage paid particular attention
to receiving and returning punts.
They will have a light workout this
afternoon before boarding the train
for the North.

Webfooters Pointed
The fact that the Cardinal ship has
sailed through a number of seasons
without a single Conference defeat
makes the Webfooters thrill with glee
to think that they are to have the
pleasure of meeting so formidable a
crew while, according to tradition and
past records, it has not reached its
peak of seasonal strength. In addition,
the Webfooters feels that it is a tar
get well worth aiming at to trip up a
team whose name will be so widely
heralded about the nation in Decem
ber when it meets the pride of the
East, West Point's powerful Cadet
eleven. However, the Stanford team
realizes what an attractive target it
is, and the boys from the Farm are
prepared to convince the Gold and
Green outfit quietly but firmly that
their guests intend being on the long
end of the score when the final gun
shot is heard in the northern stadium.
Tiny Thornhill, after witnessing
Oregon's victory over College of the
Pacific last week, reports that the
Warner team is going to meet stiffer
competition from its opponent than it
has from that source for many sea
sr«ns. Oregon shows great improve
ment over the team that the Cards
humbled here last year by a 19-0
score. They are particularly strong in
running plays, Thornhill says.
The Redshirts have trained for Sat
urday's game with a week of strenu
ous practice, a great deal of which
has consisted of scrimmaging. Yester
day the first and second teams in
scrimmage paid particular attention
to receiving and returning punts.
They will have a light workout this
afternoon before boarding the train
for the North.
When the northbound train leaves
Palo Alto this afternoon at 4:30
o'clock it will have as passengers
some thirty-six men with a single
thought in mind—that of defeating
Coach MeEwan's Oregon University
grid eleven next Saturday at Eugene.
Pop Warner, Tiny Thornhill, Manager
Johnny Long, and thirty-three players
are making the trip and will arrive in
the territory of invasion tomorrow
noon.
The players making the trip are
Captain Hoffman, Rothert and Sim
kins, fullbacks; Frentrup, Sims, Iliese,
Winnek, Clark, Marks, and Wilton,
halfbacks; Pleishhacker, Smalling,
and Lewis, quarters; Worden, Har
der, Bush, Davidson, Albertson, and
Muller, ends; Sellman, Artman, Kla
