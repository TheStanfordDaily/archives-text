# HOOVER SILENT AFTER SEEING COOLIDGE
## Republican Party in Need of Young Idealism, G.O.P. Candidate Says 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.
Bert Hoover today paid another visit
to the White House to discuss the
general political situation with Presi
dent Coolidge and disclosed after the
conference that the chief executive
planned to deliver some addresses be
fore election day.
The Republican presidential nomi
nee declared that he did not know
whether the speeches of Mr. Coolidge
would be political. He would not re
veal the subject of their conversation
beyond -declaring that it was upon
various matters pertaining to the
campaign and the general progress
of his presidential fight.
Earlier in the day Hoover welcomed
a group of first voters from the home
town of Governor Alfred E. Smith,
his Democratic opponent, with a brief
address in which he emphasized that
the vigor and idealism of the younger
generation were essential to carry on
the Republican party.
The candidate also learned from
Representative Hamilton Fish of New-
York, a new angle on the political
situation in that state. The nomina
tion of A. B. Houghton, ambassador
to Great Britain, as Republican sena
torial candidate, Fish declared, to
gether with the vigorous fight of the
Democratic forces under Governor
Smith, had thrown that state into the
doubtful column. The selection of
Houghton had alienated the World
War Veterans from the Republican
party.
Later Fish said he had informed Dr.
Hubert Work, chairman of the Re
publican National Committee, that un
less the circulation of religious litera
ture was stopped, the Democrats
would make sweeping gains in the
East. He added that he also had
urged Work to summon Mrs. Mabel
Walker Willebrandt back to her
duties in the Department of Justice.
In greeting the delegation which
represented the New York young Re
publican club, Hoover said the aim
of the party was to meet the many
national problems "with a policy that
comes of open-mindedness and human
sympathy, a policy that can be stated
so that intelligent people can under
stand."
