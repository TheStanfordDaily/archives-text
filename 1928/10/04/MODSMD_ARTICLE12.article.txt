# Next Play To Be Satire On Royal Wedlock
## Popular Comedy Will Feature Spectacular, Elaborate Costumes, Settings 
### 
"The Queen's Husband," which is
to be presented October 12, is a clever
but not a bitter satire on modern
monarchies. Within the play, how
ever, is an ironical situation concern
ing the idea of royal marriages.
Princess Anne, played by Helen
Ward, is almost forced by her mother,
Queen Martha, interpreted by Virginia
Volland, into a loveless marriage for
the sake of diplomacy; this was the
same condition under which the
Queen was married and she is ex
tremely resentful because of it, but
nevertheless insists that her daugh
ter go through the same ordeal.
Character Parts
The play is filled with interesting
character parts and the most out
standing of these are King Eric VIII
and Queen Martha. Gordon Davis
plays the part of a dry, old king who
manages his kingdom despite his
wife. Virginia Volland as Queen
Martha plays a consistent yet unlov
able role. Her constantly recurring
question: "Majesty, where have you
been?" becomes an argument against
royal marriages. The interpretation
of these two parts is the foundation
of the play, and if the presentation
goes as expected, it will have a most
solid foundation.
Dick Fisher, who is to play the part
of General Northrup, is expected to
create a finished characterization. It
is the current concensus that Fisher
will do outstanding work in dramatics
this quarter.
Good Costuming
The costuming for the play, it was
announced by Harold Ilelvenston yes
terday, is to be of a superior nature.
Miss Volland is to wear the type of
purple gown made famous by Queen
Marie of Rumania and in the final act
she will be seen in a hand-made crys
tal gown, the first to be worn in this
country. Helen Ward, in the last act,
willmvear one of the newest and most
spectacular bridal dresses seen this
season.
Last night's rehearsals indicated
that Dick Fisher will play his part
with his usual power. Miss Holland
gives promise of being almost me
chanically perfect, while Miss Ward
and Dick Stewart are creating a scin
tillating love theme.
The part of Lord Burton which was
first played by Burton in an affected
manner is improved upon by Jack
Wiggin who has recognition
on the Stanford stage for his work in
the past.
If the play is not a success, it will
be due to some now unforeseen lack;
but if previous performances are an
indication, it will serve to usher in
this season's dramatics with an ex
ceedingly popular play.

purple gown made famous by Queen
Marie of Rumania and in the final act
she will be seen in a hand-made crys
tal gown, the first to be worn in this
country. Helen Ward, in the last act,
willmvear one of the newest and most
spectacular bridal dresses seen this
season.
Last night's rehearsals indicated
that Dick Fisher will play his part
with his usual power. Miss Holland
gives promise of being almost me
chanically perfect, while Miss Ward
and Dick Stewart are creating a scin
tillating love theme.
The part of Lord Burton which was
first played by Burton in an affected
manner is improved upon by Jack
Wiggin who has recognition
on the Stanford stage for his work in
the past.
If the play is not a success, it will
be due to some now unforeseen lack;
but if previous performances are an
indication, it will serve to usher in
this season's dramatics with an ex
ceedingly popular play.
"The Queen's Husband," which is
to be presented October 12, is a clever
but not a bitter satire on modern
monarchies. Within the play, how
ever, is an ironical situation concern
ing the idea of royal marriages.
Princess Anne, played by Helen
Ward, is almost forced by her mother,
Queen Martha, interpreted by Virginia
Volland, into a loveless marriage for
the sake of diplomacy; this was the
same condition under which the
Queen was married and she is ex
tremely resentful because of it, but
nevertheless insists that her daugh
ter go through the same ordeal.
Character Parts
The play is filled with interesting
character parts and the most out
standing of these are King Eric VIII
and Queen Martha. Gordon Davis
plays the part of a dry, old king who
manages his kingdom despite his
wife. Virginia Volland as Queen
Martha plays a consistent yet unlov
able role. Her constantly recurring
question: "Majesty, where have you
been?" becomes an argument against
royal marriages. The interpretation
of these two parts is the foundation
of the play, and if the presentation
goes as expected, it will have a most
solid foundation.
Dick Fisher, who is to play the part
of General Northrup, is expected to
create a finished characterization. It
is the current concensus that Fisher
will do outstanding work in dramatics
this quarter.
Good Costuming
The costuming for the play, it was
announced by Harold Ilelvenston yes
terday, is to be of a superior nature.
Miss Volland is to wear the type of
purple gown made famous by Queen
Marie of Rumania and in the final act
she will be seen in a hand-made crys
