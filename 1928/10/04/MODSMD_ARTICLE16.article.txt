## 
### 
Interclass football has interested a con
siderable number of men this year, says
Charles W. Davis, director of intramural
sports, and except for the freshman team,
which is an unknown quantity, all classes
have promising teams and sporting
chances to take the title.
This year there will be five groups
contending, instead of the usual four.
The medical students have organized un
der H. E. Billig.
Equipment will be issued tomorrow,
and the first practice is scheduled for
Monday. The four interclass fields are
laid out between Branner hall and the
military barracks. The senior field is
next to the road, the junior area next,
and so on in order.
The class of 1929 won last year, and
probably are this year's favorites to take
the title. Many of last year's freshman
and sophomore teams members have
added a little weight, improved their
strength, and look in fine shape. Mem
bers of the present frosh squad who have
been eliminated since practice started
have the advantage of three weelcs train
ing and are expected to form the nucleus
of the babe team.
The opening games will be October 20
when the juniors and seniors meeting in
