# The 						H. C. of L. Hits Encina

The four eating clubs located in Encina Commons are heatedly
exercised over, and the freshmen mildly opposed to, the arrangements
which have been made by the University for the operation of the dining
halls this year.
The cause of the complaint is that decision has been made to serve no
meals on Sunday, although the price of board per epiarter has been left
at the price which last year covered the cost of seven days' board. As a
consequence of this move, the cost to eating club members and to fresh
men amounts to about $1.14 per day.
One dollar and fourteen cents per day is high for board in a living
group. Most organizations manage to keep the cost to members down
to $1 or $1.05 and still serve good enough food to keep their athletes on
the teams. This is accomplished in groups of from twenty to thirty; the
Encina Commons is a monster cooking and dining unit whose capacity
is 600 mouths. It is certainly to be marvelled at if board cannot be served
to the 400-odd men who will be eating there this quarter for something
substantially less than $1.14 per day. Especially since the University
compels freshmen to board at Encina Commons, should it give them at
least as much for their money as other independent living groups do
their members.
The Encina board of control is said to be going over this problem with
Comptroller Roth. It is to be hoped that at least a reduction in the
quarterly board rate will be the result, so as to partially make up for the
inconvenience and expense in having to take meals elsewhere on Sundays.
