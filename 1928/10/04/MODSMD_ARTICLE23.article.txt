# The 						Attitude of Crabbed Age

### 
The liability of drowning is nil, but the opportunity for receiving con
tusions, fractures and strains is as great, in the new tie-up, which fresh
men and sophomores today participate in, as in the old mud fight. Be that
as it may, the tie-up is with us, the mud fight abolished; and it behooves
all underclassmen to turn out to fight and all upperclassmen to watch the
spectacle. Graduate students may spend the afternoon in the library.
Freshmen with Rover Boys ideas of college often are heard to com
plain because they are not happily engaged during their first month here
in evading hazing-bent sophomores. We think they are inestimably lucky,
and, indeed, unlike popular heroines, we should not feel that "something
fine had gone out of our life" if the whole class fight tradition received
the axe of custom and were abolished. Win or lose the fight, the fresh
men seem to retain the same amount of cockiness during the year and
throw just as many sacksful of water from Encina windows.
In connection with this, it would be only candid to say that the above
is the viewpoint of a seniov who has not had for two years the pleasure of
picking up a freshman and throwing him into a hole full of mud. There
is something to be said for the sheer joy of combat.
