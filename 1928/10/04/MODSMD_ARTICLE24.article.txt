Students will have their FIRST and ONLY chance to buy rooter's
and additional tickets to the Stanford-U. S. C. football game from 2 to 5
o'clock today and tomorrow in the Associated Students office in the Old
Union. It will be absolutely impossible to buy tickets later.
At first thought many students who are unalterably opposed to the
ways of the Board of Athletic Control will commence hurling invectives
at what they consider a great outrage. If they would look at this matter
unselfishly, they would find that this is really not as unjust as its sounds
and that the Ticket Department is trying to give the students a fair deal.
But they must also give someone else a fair deal. There are already
sufficient alumni applications on hand to sell out the Coliseum. But the
Ticket Department has set aside the rooter's tickets and a number of ad
ditional tickets in preferred sections for students and is holding the
alumni applications. After the students have taken what they want, the
alumni will get theirs. Which will all seem very unfair to the chronic
complainers when they become alumni.
Whatever a student believes, these are the rules and must be complied
with. Stanford has a good team this year and one that is deserving of
support. A large rooting section at Los Angeles would be the right kind
of support.
