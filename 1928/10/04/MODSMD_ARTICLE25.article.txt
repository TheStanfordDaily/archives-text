# Squads in Debating, as in Football
## 
### 
Tonight's meeting of all those interested in varsity debating is being
called to discuss a possible change in the present debate scheme at Stan
ford. Manager Steve Halstead announces that this change may take the
form of the squad system which has been used with success both at
U. S. C. and Occidental College.
Coach Emerson and Halstead will explain this system by which tryouts
for each varsity contest will be eliminated if the new idea is accepted.
"I think Miss Keelcr is one of the sweetest girls I ever met," A1 Jolson
is quoted in an eminent southern California newspaper as saying, "but
marriage talk is just a rifle premature."
That suggests a possible new divorce plea for tearful Peggy Hopkins
Joyce's: "I didn't know it was loaded."
