The Editor, Sir:
I understand there is a growing de
mand for another revival of a Gilbert
and Sullivan comic opera on this campus.
I am one of those who recall with pleas
ure the presentation of "Princess Ida"
here, and feel that a second revival of
another of the enjoyable Gilbert-Sulli
van shows would be again a popular as
well as worth while project. Surely with
the talent there is at Stanford, and with
the able direction that Warren D. Allen
and Gordon Davis can give, such a pro
duction is possible. If it is possible it
is desirable.

The Editor, Sir:
Each quarter a number of sections are
offered in Economics 1, and each quarter
many students are turned away because
of overflowing classes. The department
of Economics states that in all its offi
cial publications it announces that regis
tration for Economics 1 is limited, and
that students should consequently know
that they should sign up with the de
partment secretary in order to insure
registration in the class. Nobody seems
to know this.
However, the department does not spe
cify that either seat cards in the case
of lower division students, or pre-regis
tration in the case of upper division stu
dents, is required. As a result of this,
practically half of one of the 10 o'clock
sections was turned away yesterday. In

the case of all the rejected students the
same complaint was heard: "I wasn't
told that I had to sign up for this
course ahead of time."
College people are able to follow in
structions just as adequately as any
others if the directions are specific. In
behalf of all the other men and women
that were refused registration yester
day, I ask that the Economics depart
ment do something to remedy this.
GRIPED, '29.
The Editor, Sir:
Now that tuition rates have been
raised three dollars a quarter to
cover the cost of a physical examination
and the general welfare of the student
as far as health is concerned, why can't
the hospital or infirmary facilities be
improved, too? By this I do not mean
improvement in medical equipment nor
the building of an infirmary on the
campus proper. The suggestion which I
make is that the Department of Physical
Education install radios in the University
wards of the Palo Alto hospital and in
a ward of the Isolation hospital.
This would be but a comparatively
small expenditure and would relieve
many lonely hours.
Anyone who has been confined for a
week or two, alone, with no one else in
the ward, especially at the Isolation hos
pital, will agree with me that time drags
heavily.
