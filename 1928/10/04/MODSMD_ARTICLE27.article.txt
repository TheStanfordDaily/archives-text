# The 						Harvard "Lampoon" Wonders About It All

(The following article is an editorial
from the Harvard "Lampoon" of June.
The "Lampoon" is a humorous maga
zine.—Editor.)
We have often wondered why in the
world anyone should go to college. Peo
ple are very fond of thinking that we
go to college to get an education. We
thought so ourselves, once. But if this
is true, according to our own experiences
in college, education may be interpreted
in three ways: first, as a refuge for
serious thinkers, aesthetes, and other spe
cies of .the bookworm; secondly, as a
intoxicating experiment in free living;
and thirdly, as a happy medium between
studies and pastimes. It didn't take us
very long, after we had survived the
harrowing hours of the mid-year exam
inations of our freshman year, to decide
that college could be fairly comfortable
if we regarded the latter iterpretation of
education with any degree of seriousness.
However, if what we have experienced
in our four yars of college life is educa
tion, then there is something altogther
futile about the whole business. It seems
as if this complicated educational ma
chine, composed of lecture courses, read
ing periods, and tutorial systems, is mak
ing a tremendously discordant clatter,
simply because it does not function as a
unit. And that is odd, since we recollect
no such discordancy in the functioning
of most of our preparatory schools.
After considering the matter very care
fully, we have come to the conclusion
that, whereas the preparatory school is
constantly striving to attain a definite
goal, the college is striving to attain a
goal far removed from the possibility
of definite human conquest. The goal
of the preparatory scthool is the college
entrance examinations. The goal of the
college, so we are told, is not examina
tions; it is the "world"; it is "life." The
preparatory school knows but one effec
tive way to conquer the college entrance
examinations — teaching. The college,
however, is at a loss; the "world" and
"life" are so intangible that they almost
defy definition, let alone conquest. And
in its efforts to conquer the "world" and
"life," the college seems to have forgot
ten that teaching is not without some
merits as a shield, if not as a spear.
Today, professors and instructors in
Harvard College are rushing into the
stacks of the college library to find
"something significant" in the dusty and
worm-eaten works of obscure and for
gotten scholars. The student is left in
the classroom, after a dreary, and often
times, garbled monologue, known as a
lecture, with only a preposterous list of
books to be read an guide him to the
light of knowledge. True, sympathetic
tutors try to help him, but even tutors,
especially those in the English depart
ment, have their limitations as teachers
when they have, in addition to thirty or
forty undergraduates, the tasks of acting
as section men in lecture courses, earning
the degree of Ph.D., and writing monu
mental theses upon matter found in the
flotsam and jetsam of intellectual an
tiquity.
The whole idea of antiquarian research
is ridiculous. This feverish desire to
write a book about a book, to recriticize
what has already been criticized, is noth
ig more than charlatanism taken seriously
by those who perpetrate it. The concep
tion that the college doing the most an
tiquarian research work is the most suc
cessful is wrong.
College is not a success educationally
unless it inspire its students. And there
is only one way by which students can
be inspired; not by reading assignments,
written reports, stupidly planned exami
nations, and stultifying lectures; but by
the inspiring personalities of able teach

ers. We have come to the conclusion
that what Harvard College has been los
ing steadily for the past four years is
this precious quality of inspired teaching.
And now we suggest, before we leave to
discover for ourselves what the "world"
and "life" are like, that the college be
gin to seek for instructors who realize
that teaching is a serious task demanding
inspiring personality, which reading peri
ods, thesis writing, and the doubtful
glory of being foremost in the second
hand business of research work can never
replace.
