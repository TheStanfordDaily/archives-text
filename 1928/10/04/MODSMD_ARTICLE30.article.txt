October 3rd.
Was pleased to hear this morning that
Mr. Hoover will probably return to this
campus to cast his vote in the November
elections, whereat I was most pleased for
I have had a fine wish to see the great
man, albeit I have heard that he does not
photograph well, and suppose that one
should really like to be able to tell one's
grandchildren that one had once seen
the presidential candidate. Do suppose,
however, that there will be many people
who will vote for Smith, though expect
that more people talk of voting for the
Democratic candidate, out of sheer ob
stinacy, than will finally do so.
* * *
With rumors flying about one way and
another, shall not countenance the hope
of actually seeing Mr. Hoover, how
ever, until banners of welcome are
erected for him again. Have determined
to change my program to take a course
in the Economics department, so that I
may better understand these political is
sues, for do believe that economy is
more important in this current election
than political science. Am at a loss to
know whether Problems of Agriculture
or Public Einance or History of Eco
nomic Thought would supply the best
background, although I am very tired
of hearing of Mr. Jackson and Mr.
Hamilton, so am not likely to take the
latter.

To classes betimes, and to the book
store to buy my books, where I found
many amusing objects which I was sore
ly tempted to buy, but did restrain my
self except for an orange pen upon which
I had my name stamped, albeit do fear
that carrying it about on my folder will
be a bit of brazen publicity. Was told
there was no room for my address, but
as all freshmen women live at Roble, do
not suppose that the lack of a home label
will be any great loss.

Do find myself much pleased with the
cheery "hello" custom, though think it
is a pity that it is not practiced between
the men and women, for this being the
first co-educational institution I have
ever attended, find myself anxious to be
cordial to everyone, and am much wor
ried for fear that some time I shall for
get myself and say "hello' from force
of habit to the young men I pass. Which
I should probably regret mightily.
Edward L. Tliorndike, eminent
psychologist, says that an adult at
30 or 40 or 50 may learn a new pro
fession as readily as a college student.
