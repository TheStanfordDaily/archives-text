# OREGON COACH IS PLANNING AERIAL ATTACK ON CARDS
## 
### 
EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 3 (JP) â€”In antici
pation that Pop Warner and his Stan
ford Cardinals will attempt to bombard
his team with passes, Captain John J.
McEwan, Oregon coach, will spend the
rest of the week before the Stanford
game here Saturday, in teaching his
players the methods of solving the tricky
aerial attack. If Oregon can stop the
passes the Webfoot coach is confident
the team will more than hold its own
against the Cards, as Oregon has its
strongest forward wall in years.
The game will be the opening con
ference tilt for both and promises to
be the battle of the air, as Oregon is
spending no little time in mastering the
art of passing. Realizing that Stanford
possesses one of the strongest lines in
the conference, the Webfoot coach plans
to use a scries of passes sandwiched in
his line plays.
Despite Oregon's fine showing agaist
Pacific, the champion Cards are still 13-
point favorites. The odds hav shrunk in
a week frorp 21 points to 13 and if it
continues to rain as it did yesterday
they may be even less when the starting
whistle blows.
