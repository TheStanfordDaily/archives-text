# W.S.C. TEAM HAS MANY DEFENSE WEAKNESSES
## 
### 
PULLMAN, Wash., Oct. 3 (/P) â€”A
number of defensive weaknesses in the
Washington State College eleven today
were crying for help as Coach Orin Hol
lingberry was tuning the squad for its
game Saturday with the University of
Montana.
In the game last Saturday with Gon
zaga University, the Green sophomore
aggregation showed the coach that he
has many difficulties to straighten out
before the Cougars are a smooth running
machine capable of meeting strong Pa
cific Coast opposition. The most of these
errors, however, appear to be normal for
an inexperienced crew, and should gradu
ally wear away as th season progresses.
