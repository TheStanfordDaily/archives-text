# SOPHS REPULSED IN RAID ATTEMPT
## 
### 
Fists flew and streams of water
gushed through Encina Hall last night
at 10 o'clock when some forty odd
sophomores attempted a raid on the
newly acquired residence of the class
of 11)32. The raid took place as an
unscheduled climax to a freshman
rally held in Encina lobby. The total
damage has not been estimated, but
it is believed to be confined to water
damage only. Autos parked in front
of the Hall were the greatest suf
ferers in this respect.
Things were serene until the in
vading troops swept into the base
ment of the suddenly darkened hall.
Copiously distributed lighted fire
crackers roused the freshmen who
met their attackers in battle on the
stairs. The defense retreated to the
vestibule of the lobby where fire
hoses were used by the 1932 horde to
repell the sophomores. The latter were
forced out of doors and received
showers of water from upper stories
of the building. The fight lasted for
approximately fifteen minutes.
Phil Cavalero made an attempt to
quell the affair, but his instructions
went unheeded. A similar fight was
attempted last year but was stopped
by sponsors.
