# SPORTS OF 1928
## "Big Mike" 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
One of the great polo players of the
day, yet scarcely ,if ever, receiving any
publicity, is Malcolm Stevenson of the
; United States team which is now en-
I gaging the Argentine four in a two out
of three scries for the "Championship
of the Americas." "Big Mike," as he is
called, is now in his forty-second year,
and, like Grover Cleveland Alexander,
still seems about as effective as ever.
Playing the difficult number three posi
tion, as lie does, Stevenson never grabs
the limelight as does Hitchcock or Guest,
but nevertheless he is just as vital a cog
in the North American machine.
"Big Mike's" part in the play is not
to bother so much about scoring goals,
but to "clean the adversaries out of the
bushes," so to speak. He opens the way
for Hitchcock as much as possible—for
the whole United States plan of attack
is to get "Tommy the Torch" loose—
and protects Guest and San ford when
ever he can. He can score though, of
course, and hits the ball cleanly and
accurately, as his goal against the Brit
ish Army-in-India team proved.
Malcolm Stevenson was born in 1887,
and started his polo career at the age of
nineteen, and in 1907 became an active
member of the Meadow Brook Club. He
was a member of seven senior and four
open championship teams. He played No.
3 against Great Britain in 1924, but was
injured in the eighth chukker of the first
match and had to remain out of the
second contest. In 1927 he played through

both matches against the English team,
although painfully hurt in the knee in
the seventh period of the second game.
His very brainy and effective play in
that series earned him much praise, for
he was the main factor in the American
defense, and never seemed to be out of
position. He is rated at ten goals.
