# GENE TUNNEYS LEAVE ROME ON HONEYMOON
## 
### 
ROME, Oct. 3. (JP) â€”Mr. and Mrs.
James Joseph Tunney left Rome in
an automobile at twilight this evening
on a honeymoon that was expected to
take them to many of the romantic,
historical, and cultural places of Italy.
If they gave any of their friends who
witnessed today's wedding ceremony
definite information of their destina
tion, those friends kept the confi
dence.
Two rites were required to make
Gene Tunney, retired heavyweight
champion, and "Polly" Lauder, heir
ess of Greenwich, Conn., man and
wife. One was civil and the other ac
cording to the ritual of the Roman
Catholic Church of which the bride
groom has been a lifelong faithful
communicant. A special dispensation
allowed both ceremonies to be per
formed in a hotel. The wedding lunch
eon was served there also and the
newlyweds were thus protected from
curiosity seekers throughout the duy.
Reclamation works to the value of
$400,000,000 are planned in Italy.
