# A.S.S.U. CONCERT SERIES MANAGER TRIALS ARE OPEN
## 
### 
Tryoutees reported last night at a
meeting held in the Old Union to
compete for positions on the 1929-30
A.S.S.U. Concert Series.
All University students may try out
for the three salaried positions that
are open. A concert manager, house
manager, and publicity manager are
to be chosen at the end of the trial
period.
The work of those who are out for
positions in the Concert Series will
consist of advertising, selling and dis
tributing tickets, and managing the
Pavilion for each concert. Tryoutees
are scheduled to canvass the living
groups on the campus within the next
two weeks.
The basis of selection will be the
quality as well as the quantity of
work done. New managers will be
finally chosen in February.
