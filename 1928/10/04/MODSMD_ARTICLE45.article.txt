# YANKS TO START SERIES AS BADLY CRIPPLED SQUAD
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 3. (/P)—A squad
of badly crippled Now York Yankees
will sLart the World Series with the
St. Louts Cardinals at the Yankee
Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
With a more or less definite an
nouncement from Huggins that Earle
Combs, injurod centerfielder, would
800 action in the big series only as a
pinch runner, if at all, Yankee stock
dropped to a new low. The odds most
frequently today favored the Cardi
nals at 6 to 3. There was little bet
ting, most Amorican League parti
sans preferring to wait for even
longer odds.
To some observers it appeared that
tho Yankees, in reality, are occuping
a rather enviable position and that
Kill McKothnie and his healthy Cardi
nals should be doing all the worry
ing. In case of defeat, the Yankee
alibi is prepared in advance, however
unintentional upon the part of the
reigning world's champions. On the
other hand, the Cardinals, at full
strength, must win and even then
may not get the credit due them.
Apparently the Cardinals realize
it. In their practice sessions at the
Yanjkee Stadium where the series
opens at 1:30 Eastern Standard time,
tomorrow, they have had no time for
jokes. Thoy go about their business in
jgrira earnest, impatient for actual
conflict to begin.
The Yanks, on the other hand, act
as though they have not a care in the
world. If Combs and Peunock are out,
and Lazzeri, Koenig, and Ruth crip
pled, the Amorican League title
holders appear untroubled just the
same.
