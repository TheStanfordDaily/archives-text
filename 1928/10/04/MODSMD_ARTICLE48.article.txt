# ACTRESS ADVISES AGAINST STAGE CAREER
## Charlotte Walker, Playing Leading Role in Brilliant Satire, Discusses Barrymore Characterization 
### BEN MADDOX 
Charlotte Walker, who character
izes Ethel Barrymore in "The Royal
Family" at the Geary Theatre, has
ono of the most beautiful speaking
voices I have ever heard. Just hear
ing her talk makes me want to start
a campaign for voice culture.
She is, by the way, one of the most
intelligent and interesting actresses
I have met in a long time. She is not
afraid to be perfectly frank, and it is
a pleasure to meet a star who will
come off her pedestal and be per
fectly honest in an interview.
Miss Walker strongly advises
against a stage career. "So many,
many disappointments come to us â€”
poor parts, unsuccessful plays, ups
and downs." Not that she has to
worry much herself, for she is one
of the most popular dramatic ac
tresses in the country now. She has
been touring in the South of recent
years; let's hope she'll stay on the
Coast now that she is here.
Of course, I asked her if the Barry
mores objected to the satire that is
so brilliantly and caustically poured
upon them in "The Royal Family."
"I understand they have," she said,
"but we are not absolutely certain

that they are the ones the play is
based upon. The girl who plays my
role in New York City closely copies
the famous Ethel Barrymore manner
isms and way of trilling the speeches.
I am playing the part straight, since
the management felt an imitation
would be resented.
"Last season I toured in 'The Con
stant Wife,' doing Miss Barrymore's
role. I got into the habit of using her
mannerisms, and have had a difficult
time getting broken of them."
Miss Walker assumes a philosophi
cal attitude toward her work. She is
very anxious to know just how the
audience reacts to h'er efforts.
Whereas most stage people look
down upon the movies, Miss Walker
is an admirer of pictures. "I think
they are greater than the legitimate
because their appeal is so much more
universal," she says.
This star's sincerity is as charm
ing as Pauline Frederick's. One feels
that she would be a delightful person
to know well. I am only hoping that
she will appear in another play soon,
so I can see her again. But "The
Royal F'amily" is such a clever show
that she will no doubt be busy Barry
moring for some months to come.
