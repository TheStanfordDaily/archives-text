# HERRINGTON, M'ELVENNY, WHEATLEY SET NEW MARKS IN EASTERN NET TOURNEYS
## 
### ANSON REEDER 
While the varsity baseball team
was teaching the Australians the great
American pastime, and the track team
was doing its share in making the
United States winner of the 1928
Olympics, three Card tennis players,
Captain Alan Herrington, Ralph Mc-
Elvenny, and Captain-elect John
Wheatley, were setting new marks in
Eastern net play.
The doubles team of Herrington and
McElvenny were prominent in every
tournament in which they entered
while on their Eastern tour. At the
National Intercollegiate tennis tourna
ment held at the Merion Cricket Club
in Pennsylvania, they ran away with
the doubles championship, losing only
one set in the entire play. They were
semi-finalists at Providence, lost a
live-set match as finalists at Long
wood, and were winners of the Colo
rado state tournament.
In the singles the Card players
were not quite as successful. At the
Intercollegiates Wheatley and McEl
venny each reached the fourth round,
and Herrington gained the fifth, only
to be beaten in a tough three-set
match by Van Ryn of Princeton, sixth
ranking player of the country in 1927.
The singles championship was ulti
mately won by Julius Seligson of

Lehigh.
At the Longwood Bowl in Boston,
Herrington trimmed Gregory Mangin
of Newark, who was afterwards the
finalist in the Southampton tourna
ment. Later the Card captain was
chosen as a member of the western
intersectional team and playing for
the West against the East won his
match.
Because of inexperience on grass
courts, Wheatley's game was not as
impressive as the other Stanford net
stars. However, he got to the finals
in the doubles of the Providence tour
nament paired with John Doeg, mem
ber of last year's freshman squad,
with whom he expects to play at
Stanford this year.
The members of the Card team who
journeyed East this summer gained
a great deal of valuable experience.
Although playing against some of the
greatest stars in the country their
game was always impressive. Herring
ton and McElvenny performed a feat
never before equalled when they won
the doubles championship in the Inter
collegiates, losing only one set in the
entire play. In the same tournament
the Stanford players were stronger
than any other team, placing three
men in the fourth round, one in the
fifth, and winning the doubles
matches.

venny each reached the fourth round,
and Herrington gained the fifth, only
to be beaten in a tough three-set
match by Van Ryn of Princeton, sixth
ranking player of the country in 1927.
The singles championship was ulti
mately won by Julius Seligson of

Lehigh.
At the Longwood Bowl in Boston,
Herrington trimmed Gregory Mangin
of Newark, who was afterwards the
finalist in the Southampton tourna
ment. Later the Card captain was
chosen as a member of the western
intersectional team and playing for
the West against the East won his
match.
Because of inexperience on grass
courts, Wheatley's game was not as
impressive as the other Stanford net
stars. However, he got to the finals
in the doubles of the Providence tour
nament paired with John Doeg, mem
ber of last year's freshman squad,
with whom he expects to play at
Stanford this year.
The members of the Card team who
journeyed East this summer gained
a great deal of valuable experience.
Although playing against some of the
greatest stars in the country their
game was always impressive. Herring
ton and McElvenny performed a feat
never before equalled when they won
the doubles championship in the Inter
collegiates, losing only one set in the
entire play. In the same tournament
the Stanford players were stronger
than any other team, placing three
men in the fourth round, one in the
fifth, and winning the doubles
matches.
While the varsity baseball team
was teaching the Australians the great
American pastime, and the track team
was doing its share in making the
United States winner of the 1928
Olympics, three Card tennis players,
Captain Alan Herrington, Ralph Mc-
Elvenny, and Captain-elect John
Wheatley, were setting new marks in
Eastern net play.
The doubles team of Herrington and
McElvenny were prominent in every
tournament in which they entered
while on their Eastern tour. At the
National Intercollegiate tennis tourna
ment held at the Merion Cricket Club
in Pennsylvania, they ran away with
the doubles championship, losing only
one set in the entire play. They were
semi-finalists at Providence, lost a
live-set match as finalists at Long
wood, and were winners of the Colo
rado state tournament.
In the singles the Card players
were not quite as successful. At the
Intercollegiates Wheatley and McEl
venny each reached the fourth round,
and Herrington gained the fifth, only
to be beaten in a tough three-set
match by Van Ryn of Princeton, sixth
ranking player of the country in 1927.
