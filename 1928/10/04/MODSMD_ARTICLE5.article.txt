# PASSING ATTACK IS PLANNED BY FIRST-YEAR MEN
## 
### 
Energies of the Cardinal freshman
gridders yesterday were directed toward
the perfection of an effective aerial at
tack and a strong defense against the
famous Santa Clara shift in preparation
for the game with the Bronc Babes in
the Stadium Saturday afternoon begin
ning at 2:30 o'clock. The 1932 freshmen
have high hopes of wiping out lingering
memories of that 7-0 defeat of the 1931
yearling eleven at the hands of the
Broncos last year.
Coach "Husky" Hunt put the first and
second teams through a light scrimmage
yesterday, the second string having the
ball and using the Santa Clara shifts.
The regulars had little difficulty in break
ing up the shift.
A fast charging line and a hard run
ning backfield are being developed by
Coaches Hunt and Bradshaw from the
yearling squad and the offensive looks
particularly promising. Rudy Rintala,
left halfback, Dusty Allen, fullback, and
Wilson, right half, will do the most of
the ball carrying, with Marks calling
signals. Rintala is as pretty an open
field runner as any coach could ask for,
and Allen is a reliable line plunger, al
j ways to be depended on to knock off
three or four yards through the line.
The Santa Clara team, one of the
heaviest Bronco elevens in recent years,
looked unusually strong in their contest
with the California Babes last Saturday,
making the bear cubs get down and
sweat profusely to nose out a 12-0 win.
, With the Stanford varsity at Eugene
I Saturday the freshman game will be the
chief football engagement within many
miles of here.
