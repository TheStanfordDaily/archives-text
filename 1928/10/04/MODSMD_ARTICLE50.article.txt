# RED CROSS WILL START BIG DRIVE FOR MEMBERSHIP
## 
### 
With the expansion of its activities
into fields of sociology, public health,
and disaster relief, special efforts are
being made by the Red Cross Society
to interest and secure membership In
its annual Roll Call, which opens on
Armistice Day, November 11, and
ends on Thanksgiving Day.
Disaster relief is the phase of Rod
Cross service that is attracting the
attention of the nation and world at
this time. Its work in the recent
Porto Rico and Florida hurricane is
but one disaster in three score or
more that yearly enlist the services
of the American Red Cross.
Supported by its membership fees,
the organization directs as many as
ten relief operations simultaneously
in different parts of the country. Gifts
to special relief funds are not gifts
to the Red Cross but to a specified
group of sufferers. However, no ap
peal is made for funds in minor disas
ters and at such times it furnishes
workers and supplies out of its own
reserves. This gives force to special
appeals in case of an outstanding
calamity. The annual membership
campaign may be considered as U.e
public's part in the smaller relief
tasks.
