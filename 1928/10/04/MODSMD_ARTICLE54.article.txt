# DOEG WINS OVER R. M'ELVENNY IN NET TOURNAMENT
## Texas Favorite Is Defeated By California Doubles Champions, 7-5, 6-4 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 3. (JP)—
Pierre Landry, member of the
French Davis Cup tennis team,
was put out of the running in the
men's singles at the Pacific South
west tennis championship tourna
ment today by Alan Herrington,
last year's captain of the Stan
ford University tennis team. The
scores were 6-1, 2-6, 9-7. Herring
ton is joint holder, with his uni
versity teammate, Ralph McEl
venny, of the National Intercolle
giate Tennis doubles champion
ship.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 3. (/P)— One
favorite fell from the ranks of title
aspirants in the morning matches ot
Pacific Southwest Tennis Champion
ships today, when Gerald Stratford,
California doubles champion, downed
Berkeley Bell, Austin, Texas, hard
hitting star. Stratford advanced to
the sixth round by smashing his way
to victory by scores of 7-5, 6-4, against
the powerful strokes of the Texas
youth.
Another leading contender to be
eliminated from the play was Ralph
McElvenny, Stanford University
holder of the National Intercollegiate
Championship. Johnny Doeg, 21-year
old Santa Monica star, was his con
queror in the match, which went to
three sets. After losing the first set
6-8, chiefly by McElvenny's taking
utmost advantage of Doeg's numerous
errors, the Santa Monica boy tight
ened up to win the next two by scores
of 6-2, 6-3.
French victories, close but decisive,
set the pace today in the race for the
Pacific Southwest Tennis Champion
ships. All three members of the cham
pionship French Davis Cup team,
Henri Cochet, Pierre Landry, and
Christian Boussus were within strik
ing distance of new titles.
Awaiting the advance of the French
was an array of Pacific Coast young
sters and a youthful net star from the
East who won their matches yester
day and walked a step nearer their
ambition of stopping the French and
achieving an American victory. ,
Cochet won from Joe Bixler, Los
Angeles, 8-6, 6-0, while Landry tee
tered on the verge of defeat against
Wallace Bates, former University of
California star, in three tense games
of 6-3, 4-6, 7-5. Boussus found little
difficulty in winning two singles
matches and aiding a doubles victory
paired with Landry.
The most likely Americans in the
path of the Frenchmen appeared to
be Ellsworth Vines, Pasadena youth,
Ralph McElvenny of Stanford Univer
sity and co-holder of the National In
tercollegiate Doubles Championship,
Alan Herrington, McElvenny's mate
in the national title, Gerald Stratford,
California doubles champion, and
John Van Ryn, former Princeton Uni

last year's captain of the Stan
ford University tennis team. The
scores were 6-1, 2-6, 9-7. Herring
ton is joint holder, with his uni

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 3. (/P)— One
favorite fell from the ranks of title
aspirants in the morning matches ot
Pacific Southwest Tennis Champion
ships today, when Gerald Stratford,
California doubles champion, downed
Berkeley Bell, Austin, Texas, hard
hitting star. Stratford advanced to
the sixth round by smashing his way
to victory by scores of 7-5, 6-4, against
the powerful strokes of the Texas
youth.
Another leading contender to be
eliminated from the play was Ralph
McElvenny, Stanford University
holder of the National Intercollegiate
Championship. Johnny Doeg, 21-year
old Santa Monica star, was his con
queror in the match, which went to
three sets. After losing the first set
6-8, chiefly by McElvenny's taking
utmost advantage of Doeg's numerous
errors, the Santa Monica boy tight
ened up to win the next two by scores
of 6-2, 6-3.
French victories, close but decisive,
set the pace today in the race for the
Pacific Southwest Tennis Champion
ships. All three members of the cham
pionship French Davis Cup team,
Henri Cochet, Pierre Landry, and
Christian Boussus were within strik
ing distance of new titles.
Awaiting the advance of the French
was an array of Pacific Coast young
sters and a youthful net star from the
East who won their matches yester
day and walked a step nearer their
ambition of stopping the French and
achieving an American victory. ,
Cochet won from Joe Bixler, Los
Angeles, 8-6, 6-0, while Landry tee
tered on the verge of defeat against
Wallace Bates, former University of
California star, in three tense games
of 6-3, 4-6, 7-5. Boussus found little
difficulty in winning two singles
matches and aiding a doubles victory
paired with Landry.
The most likely Americans in the
path of the Frenchmen appeared to
be Ellsworth Vines, Pasadena youth,
Ralph McElvenny of Stanford Univer
sity and co-holder of the National In
tercollegiate Doubles Championship,
Alan Herrington, McElvenny's mate
in the national title, Gerald Stratford,
California doubles champion, and
John Van Ryn, former Princeton Uni
versity star. All of these players
found victory readily in yesterday's
matches.
