SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 3. (#>)— The
lack of economic development in the
Philippines presents an insuperable
barrier to the realization of the Fili
pino's goal of political independence,
said Eugene A. Gilmore, Vice-Gover
nor of the Philippines, before a meet
ing of the Foreign Relations Commit
tee of the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce today.
The Philippine Islands are the moat
strategic point in the Far East, he
said, not only to the United States
but to the world. The country must
create more taxable wealth, however,
before it can reach that degree of
economic importance for which it is
destined.
"The obvious need of the hour in
the Philippines is capital," Gilmore
declared. "It does not now exist there.
Its accumulation out of present Fili
pino industrial activities will be a
slow and tedious process. The alterna
tive is to get capital from the outside.
The logical place for this is the United
States."
The Philippines are usually thought
of as a rich source of supply for
many basic raw materials, he pointed
out. In this respect the islands are
of tremendous significance to the
manufacturing interests of the United
States, but it is hardly to be expect
ed, Gilmore continued "that economic
development will go no further than
supplying raw materials for the fac
tories of this country.
