# CAT'S AWAY—CLASS OF '32 DECORATES DRIVE; GETS BILL
## 
### 
"While the cat's away, the
mice will play."
And so, while the members of
the class of '31 were disporting
in foreign parts or seeking
solace in peaceful slumber, ac
cording to temperament, several
artistically inclined wearers of
the green night before last saw
fit to decorate Palm Drive with
a bucketful of white paint and
the words, "WHAT SOPH VIGIL
ANCE COMMITTEE? TO HELL
WITH '31."
Such vulgarity was unbecom
ing tb Stanford's principal thor
oughfare; so early yesterday af
ternoon, two industrious Univer
sity employees were seen scrub
bing the marred portion of the
drive with large quantities of
gasoline. The bill will be sent to
the freßhman class at the end of
the month.
Incidentally, it might be well
to say that sophomores and
upperclassmen are being greatly
cheered by the sight of so many
"dinks" gracing the locks of '32.
