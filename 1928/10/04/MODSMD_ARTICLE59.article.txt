CHICAGO, Oct. 3. (/P) â€”Orange
juice, and psychology, may be a boon
to Bob Zuppke's Fighting Illini in
their effort to repeat as Big Ten
football champions, but at Northwest
ern chocolate malted milk is Coach
Dick Hanley's training selection.
With practice sessions continuing
long after the dinner hour under the
creed that all players shall drink
glare of flood lights, Hanley has de
malted milk immediately after leav
ing the field. Orange juice still re
mains the piece de resistance for after
practice tid-bit on warmer evenings.
The malted milk-orange juice diet sup
plants the eggnog of last season,
which was not successful as a train
ing diet if the record of the Wildcats
is any criterion.
