# HAGEN, ESPINOSA ARE CHOSEN FOR NATIONAL FINALS
## 
### 
BALTIMORE, Oct. 3.(,/p)—They're
picking A1 Espinosa, of the Chicago
Espinosas, to emerge as the final
round opponent of Walter Hagen, in
the current National Professional Golf
Tournament in which the Haig is af
ter his fifth consecutive champion
ship.
Since back in 1923 when Gene Sara
zen beat out Sir Walter in the final
for this same crown, the little Italian
has been rated as the special nemesis
of Hagen in this particular tourna
ment —and so it may prove. But if
Sarazen is to beat him this time it
will not be in the final round. They
are both in the lower half of the draw
and will meet in the semi-finals if
they get that far. Espinosa, playing
par golf and occupying a place in the
upper half where the competition is
not so stiff is a stand-out to come
through to the finals. If that is the
way that things eventually work out,
Hagen will have a struggle on his
hands well worthy of a champion, as
meeting Sarazen and Espinosa on suc
cessive days, especially the way the
worthy test for any man.
Of the three, it was Espinosa who
played the best golf yesterday. In
fact, the tournament has been .in
them Espinosa has flashed the most
effective stuff. On Monday it won him
the qualifying medal and yesterday it
burly and formidable Johnny Golden
of Paterson, N.J.
