# Popular Demand Backs Revival Of Gilbert-Sullivan
## Success of "Princess Ida" Cited by Comic Opera Enthusiasts 
### BURNELL GOULD 
Will it be Bunthorne or Ko-Ko—Little
Buttercup or Frederic? What famous
Gilbert and Sullivan character, from
what great Gilbert and Sullivan comic
opera will step before the Stanford foot
lights to amuse and charm a Stanford
audience?
In the face of popular demand for an
other revival, inspired by the resounding
success of "Princess Ida," staged here
in February, 1927, the Dramatic Council
is sounding the possibilities of a second
comic opera production.
While plans are not yet formulated,
awaiting a favorable reaction by Stan
ford dramatic and musical talent as well
as a backing by the student body as a
\ whole, it is understood that the best
known Gilbert and Sullivan collaborations
lead the list of possibilities.
This means that "The Mikado," done
last year by the Players' Guild; "H.M.S.
| Pinafore," a perennial favorite; "Pirates
j of Penzance," once presented by the Uni
versity of California musical societies;
j and "Patience, or Bunthorne's Bride"
I will be first considered by the committee.
"Princess Ida," the first production of
its sort given here in many years, and
j perhaps the finest, was an unqualified
j success, when the difficulties of presen
i tation are considered. Warren D. Allen,
musical director of "Princess Ida," direc
j tor of the choir, and University organ
j ist, feels that the experience gained in
i the first opera will help immeasureably
| in the second.
Mr. Allen is talking over the possibili
j tics with students interested in some
! phase of stage production. He will be in
his office for interview this morning and
j Friday morning, as well as Friday after
noon.
It is not known whether or not the
glee clubs will furnish the bulk of the
| choruses for the show, though the sub
ject was mentioned in a meeting of the
Stanford Men's Glee Club last evening.
In view of the extensive program
planned by Gordon Davis for the Stan
ford stage this fall, starting with a third
presentation of Robert Sherwood's "The
Queen's Husband" next week, it is ex
pected that the Gilbert and Sullivan opus
will be given during the winter quarter.
This, however, is not definite.
Student opinion is solicited on the pro
posal, while those personally interested
may see Warren D. Allen.

ject was mentioned in a meeting of the
Stanford Men's Glee Club last evening.
In view of the extensive program
planned by Gordon Davis for the Stan
ford stage this fall, starting with a third
presentation of Robert Sherwood's "The
Queen's Husband" next week, it is ex
pected that the Gilbert and Sullivan opus
will be given during the winter quarter.
This, however, is not definite.
Student opinion is solicited on the pro
posal, while those personally interested
may see Warren D. Allen.
Will it be Bunthorne or Ko-Ko—Little
Buttercup or Frederic? What famous
Gilbert and Sullivan character, from
what great Gilbert and Sullivan comic
opera will step before the Stanford foot
lights to amuse and charm a Stanford
audience?
In the face of popular demand for an
other revival, inspired by the resounding
success of "Princess Ida," staged here
in February, 1927, the Dramatic Council
is sounding the possibilities of a second
comic opera production.
While plans are not yet formulated,
awaiting a favorable reaction by Stan
ford dramatic and musical talent as well
as a backing by the student body as a
\ whole, it is understood that the best
known Gilbert and Sullivan collaborations
lead the list of possibilities.
This means that "The Mikado," done
last year by the Players' Guild; "H.M.S.
| Pinafore," a perennial favorite; "Pirates
j of Penzance," once presented by the Uni
versity of California musical societies;
j and "Patience, or Bunthorne's Bride"
I will be first considered by the committee.
"Princess Ida," the first production of
its sort given here in many years, and
j perhaps the finest, was an unqualified
j success, when the difficulties of presen
i tation are considered. Warren D. Allen,
musical director of "Princess Ida," direc
j tor of the choir, and University organ
j ist, feels that the experience gained in
i the first opera will help immeasureably
| in the second.
Mr. Allen is talking over the possibili
j tics with students interested in some
! phase of stage production. He will be in
his office for interview this morning and
j Friday morning, as well as Friday after
noon.
It is not known whether or not the
glee clubs will furnish the bulk of the
| choruses for the show, though the sub
ject was mentioned in a meeting of the
Stanford Men's Glee Club last evening.
