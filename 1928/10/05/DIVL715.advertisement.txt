Dry Ginger Ale
Isuan is an experience—a sparkling, thrilling,
new dry ginger ale that conies, bottled, from
the Philippines'!
Tasting of fresh ginger, tangy with the juice
of fresh limes, its bubbles cascade into your
glass. And the taste is real; for spicy ginger
root grows in the Philippines; limes ripen but
a stone's throw from the Isuan Mineral
Springs, whence comes the sparkling water
that distinguishes this ginger ale.
Meet Isuan this very night. Smart cafes, the
best hotels and restaurants, solicitous grocers
—all feature it.
In Manila they say "E-swan"
