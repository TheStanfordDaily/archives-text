Dares Fate
for Favorite
Pipe Tobacco

Gentlemen:
I have a mania for crawling through
a number of unexplored caverns be
tween the towns of Woodstock and
Mt. Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley.
One cave was exceedingly dangerous
with its tight passages, etc. I spent
three hours in this cavity, groping
blindly with a "dead" flashlight and
a severed guiding string.
To cut my story short, I was finally
rescued by a searching party after a
terrible experience. It was a wonder
ful feeling as I sat at the mouth of the
cavern telling my friends that 1 would
not go back in there for love nor
money. I meant it—until 1 reached
for my can of Edgeworth. It was gone,
and I recalled dropping something
during the excitement in the cave.
It is queer what a man will do when
his favorite tobacco is concerned. I
realized that without my tobacco it
would be as bad as being lost in the
cavity—so I crawled back.
It was a grand and glorious feeling
as my hand came in contact with the
Aristocrat of Tobacco.
Yours very truly,
Joseph P. Fink, Jr.
