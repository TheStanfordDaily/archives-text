Now that (with apologies to Cfutppic)
Everyone is more or less located
and registration for the major part
is over—one's attention can be given
to his wardrobe. We submit the fol
/
lowing suggestions—>
Of course the upperclassman must
have his Cords—they're the mark
of distinction—
To others we suggest Flannels,
Twills, or Knickers—
Every man ought to have a Sweater
or two —
Last —but not least—Leather Coats
and Sheepskin Coats are an absolute
necessity these cold nights—
We could go on ad infinitum but
space will not permit, so we wind
up with an invite to drop in anytime
and look us over.
