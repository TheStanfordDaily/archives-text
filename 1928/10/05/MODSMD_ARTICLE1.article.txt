# WARNER LEADS STANFORD INTO WEBFOOT LAIR
## Stormy Weather Looms As Cardinals Speed North For Oregon Tilt At Eugene 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Pop Warner and thirty-three of his
selected gridiron warriors are now
aboard the Cascade Limited speeding
through the Apple State toward Eu
gene where Stanford will meet Coach
McEwan's football team Saturday in
the first game of the Coast Conference
season.
In the meantime, Cardinal rooters
are wondering what news the weath
erman will present to the team when
it arrives at its destination today at
noon. The reason for their concern
ment, as well-posted fans know, is
that a muddy field will seriously af
fect the Warner style of play. It has
been pouring rain for two days in
Eugene and telegraph reports from
the North indicate that the field in
Hayward Stadium is slippery now but
may dry sufficiently before game time
if the meteorological demonstration
•ceases before tomorrow. As a result
the Cards have dropped from twenty
one to six point favorites to beat the
Gold and Green eleven.
Kicking Duel Looms
If the rain continues, the Cards will
undoubtedly resort to the strength of
its kicking stars, thus turning the
game into a punting duel. If the mat
ter of punting does decide the game,
Stanford should be the victor, having
in Captain Biff Hoffman and Harlow
Rothert two men who can outdistance
any of the Oregon backs. Hoffman be
lieves that a wet ball will improve his
punting as it did last year against
Washington. Up to the time of that
memorable game, Biff had been er
ratic in this department of the sport,
but with the aid of a wet ball he got
out kicks that equalled in distance
the best that he was able to do in
the remainder of the season.
The fact that a wet ball is very
difficult to pass is counteracted, for
Stanford's sake, by the fact that a
wet ball is also as difficult to receive
from the opposition's punter. The ad- !
vantage is in the kicker's favor. Hoff
man spent yesterday's training sos-'
sion by practicing kicking while his i
teammates ran through their plays.
Squad Nearly Intact
In the matter of losses to the teams
Stanford is more fortunate than its |
rival. The squad that left here yes
terday was practically intact, with
the exception of Johnny Preston. All i
the other regulars are in good shape
for the game. Frentrup, Sims, Post,
and Smalling, all four of whom were j
on the injured list the first part of
this week, are declared to be in good
condition and will be ready when '■
called into action.

Two of Oregon's regular players,
Ted Pope, star end, and John Kitz
, niuller, plunging fullback, will prob
ably be out of the game with injuries.
Walker Goes South
Tiny Thorn hill will assist Pop War
ner from the bench. Ed Walker is
going to Los Angeles to witness the
manner in which the U.C.L.A. Bruins
treat Caltech. The Bruins will be
Stanford's next opponent.
Following is a list of the players
Pop is taking with him to Eugene:
Captain Hoffman, Rothert and Sim
kins, fullbacks; Frentrup, Siins, Riese,
Winnek, Clark, Marks, and Wilton,
halfbacks; Fleishhacker, Smalliug,
and Lewis, quarters; Worden, Har
der, Bush, Davidson, Albertson, and
Muller, ends; Sellman, Artman, Kla
bau, Bogue, and Tandy, tackles; Ro*
besky, Post, Driscoll, Heiser, Forster,
and Ingram, guards; Heinecke, Cook,
and Vermilya, centers.

Walker Goes South
Tiny Thorn hill will assist Pop War
ner from the bench. Ed Walker is
going to Los Angeles to witness the
manner in which the U.C.L.A. Bruins
treat Caltech. The Bruins will be
Stanford's next opponent.
Following is a list of the players
Pop is taking with him to Eugene:
Captain Hoffman, Rothert and Sim
kins, fullbacks; Frentrup, Siins, Riese,
Winnek, Clark, Marks, and Wilton,
halfbacks; Fleishhacker, Smalliug,
and Lewis, quarters; Worden, Har
der, Bush, Davidson, Albertson, and
Muller, ends; Sellman, Artman, Kla
bau, Bogue, and Tandy, tackles; Ro*
besky, Post, Driscoll, Heiser, Forster,
and Ingram, guards; Heinecke, Cook,
and Vermilya, centers.
The revenue for motion picture
theaters in the United States in 1927
was $750,000,000.
Pop Warner and thirty-three of his
selected gridiron warriors are now
aboard the Cascade Limited speeding
through the Apple State toward Eu
gene where Stanford will meet Coach
McEwan's football team Saturday in
the first game of the Coast Conference
season.
In the meantime, Cardinal rooters
are wondering what news the weath
erman will present to the team when
it arrives at its destination today at
noon. The reason for their concern
ment, as well-posted fans know, is
that a muddy field will seriously af
fect the Warner style of play. It has
been pouring rain for two days in
Eugene and telegraph reports from
the North indicate that the field in
Hayward Stadium is slippery now but
may dry sufficiently before game time
if the meteorological demonstration
•ceases before tomorrow. As a result
the Cards have dropped from twenty
one to six point favorites to beat the
Gold and Green eleven.
Kicking Duel Looms
If the rain continues, the Cards will
undoubtedly resort to the strength of
its kicking stars, thus turning the
game into a punting duel. If the mat
ter of punting does decide the game,
Stanford should be the victor, having
in Captain Biff Hoffman and Harlow
Rothert two men who can outdistance
any of the Oregon backs. Hoffman be
lieves that a wet ball will improve his
punting as it did last year against
Washington. Up to the time of that
memorable game, Biff had been er
ratic in this department of the sport,
but with the aid of a wet ball he got
out kicks that equalled in distance
the best that he was able to do in
the remainder of the season.
The fact that a wet ball is very
difficult to pass is counteracted, for
Stanford's sake, by the fact that a
wet ball is also as difficult to receive
from the opposition's punter. The ad- !
vantage is in the kicker's favor. Hoff
man spent yesterday's training sos-'
sion by practicing kicking while his i
teammates ran through their plays.
Squad Nearly Intact
In the matter of losses to the teams
Stanford is more fortunate than its |
rival. The squad that left here yes
terday was practically intact, with
the exception of Johnny Preston. All i
the other regulars are in good shape
for the game. Frentrup, Sims, Post,
and Smalling, all four of whom were j
on the injured list the first part of
this week, are declared to be in good
condition and will be ready when '■
called into action.

Two of Oregon's regular players,
Ted Pope, star end, and John Kitz
, niuller, plunging fullback, will prob
ably be out of the game with injuries.
