# WARNER LEADS STANFORD INTO WEBFOOT LAIR
## Stormy Weather Looms As Cardinals Speed North For Oregon Tilt At Eugene 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Pop Warner and thirty-three of his
selected gridiron warriors are now
aboard the Cascade Limited speeding
through the Apple State toward Eu
gene where Stanford will meet Coach
McEwan's football team Saturday in
the first game of the Coast Conference
season.
In the meantime, Cardinal rooters
are wondering what news the weath
erman will present to the team when
it arrives at its destination today at
noon. The reason for their concern
ment, as well-posted fans know, is
that a muddy field will seriously af

been pouring rain for two days in
Eugene and telegraph reports from
the North indicate that the field in
Hayward Stadium is slippery now but
may dry sufficiently before game time
if the meteorological demonstration
•ceases before tomorrow. As a result
the Cards have dropped from twenty
one to six point favorites to beat the
Gold and Green eleven.
Kicking Duel Looms
If the rain continues, the Cards will
undoubtedly resort to the strength of
its kicking stars, thus turning the
game into a punting duel. If the mat
ter of punting does decide the game,
Stanford should be the victor, having
in Captain Biff Hoffman and Harlow
Rothert two men who can outdistance
any of the Oregon backs. Hoffman be
lieves that a wet ball will improve his
punting as it did last year against
Washington. Up to the time of that
memorable game, Biff had been er
ratic in this department of the sport,
but with the aid of a wet ball he got
out kicks that equalled in distance
