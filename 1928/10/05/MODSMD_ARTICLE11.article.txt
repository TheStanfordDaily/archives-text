# DAVIS, VOLLAND SHOW POLISH IN SHERWOOD PLAY
## 
### 
Last night's rehearsals for "The
| Queen's Husband" were run through
j under Gordon Davis' hyper-critical di
rection with a finishing which promised
' a remarkable production. Gordon Da
vis and Virginia Volland have devel
oped polished interpretations of a
| spoofing, checker-playing king and a
! positive, heel-walking queen. They
both have (Taught the tempo of the
i play and handle it with a positiveness
which insures the presentation against
a weariness of lines.
Leavenworth Colby flings dour com
ments from a height of six feet four.
Colby's bit is free from any traditional
handling of the part, and is conceded
to be the best interpretation rendered.
Because Helen Ward is adapting
herself to her part with ease and nat
uralness, Dick Stewart should be able
j to play his role with more finesse than
in the other previous performances.
Reverand Elmo Robinson, playing
Dr. Fellman, may be depended upon
to play his part with ease and poise,
while Byron Snow, cast as Laker, will
furnish an interesting contrast to his
reserve.
Helvenston's set with his rocco mo
tiff will be an interesting and spectacu
lar framing of the sophisticated satire.
