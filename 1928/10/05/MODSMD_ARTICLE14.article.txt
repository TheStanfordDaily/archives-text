# President Relates Final Results Of $1,000,000 Drive
## Pledges Toward University's $700,000 Allotment Is Surpassed 
### 
More than $700,000, the amount prom
ised by the University toward a million
dollar campaign for funds, was pledged
before the final day of the drive, October
1, according to a report made by Presi
dent Wilbur yesterday.
The campaign began nearly three years
ago, after an agreement with the Gen
eral Education Board that should the
University raise $700,000 the Board
would add $300,000 to make the total of
$1,000,000.
To Increase Salaries
The purpose of the campaign fund was
to increase the salaries of members of
the Stanford faculty. In order to keep
her faculty up to its usual standard the
University realized that some step toward
raising funds must be made. So when
she was able to make a satisfactory
agreement with General Education Board,
the drive began.
At the present time $627,724.02 in sub
scriptions has been received from the
faculty, friends of the University, ex
students and alumni. In proportion to
this the General Education Board has
subscribed $269,024.55, making a total
of $896,748.57 received.
Quota Not Obtained
Pledges toward the million dollars total
$788,503.73, which shows $160,779.71 still
outstanding. As a result there is still
$30,975.45 which the University is un
able to collect from the General Educa
tion Board because of failure to obtain
payment of sufficient pledges before Oc
tober 1.
As faculty salaries have already been
raised, collection of funds must go on
until the full million dollars is available.
