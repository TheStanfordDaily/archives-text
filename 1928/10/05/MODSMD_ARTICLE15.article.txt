# OFFICERS BATTER CHURCH DOORS TO SERVE WRIT
## 
### 
LOWELL, Mass., Oct. 4. (yP)Holy
Trinity Greek Church, its interior re
sembling a fort more than a place of
worship today passed out of the control
of a faction which has been holding it
by force of actual occupancy for several
months but not until the police battered
down the door. This accomplished, the
officers met with no resistance and served
on the defenders a writ of possession
granted by the courts to the opposing
faction.
When the police demanded entrance
they were met by a threat from one of
the men inside that he would shoot if
the officers tried to force their way in.
While the officers were wielding sledge
hammers, two men ran out of another
door and two others who remained inside
tolled the church bell incessantly.
Attracted by the noise, a crowd gath
ered in the streets nearby. The officers
finally broke down the doors. They
found the two remaining occupants at the
bell rope and served the writ. They con
fiscated a supply of rifles, shot guns,
automatic pistols, revolvers and knives
and a large quantity of ammunition.
The struggle between the two factions
for control of the church property
started early in the summer. A faction,
owning allegiance to Bishop Rodostolou
of the Greek Orthodox Church took
forcible possession of the church and
locked the doors.
