MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Oct. 4. (JP) â€”
Reports yesterday of the killing of four
and perhaps seven, peaceful Nicaraguans
on Oct. 2 at the village of San Marcos,
Jinotega, resulted in measures today to
block any interference with registration
for the forthcoming registration by out
law groups.
Rumors have been current for some
time that these groups would attempt a
demonstration during the registration or
voting period, according to an American
election official today.
"Such demonstrations," he said, "arc
purely for advertising purposes abroad
and to enable looting at home. So far,
however, few citizens have been fright
ened away and registration is heavier
than in 1924."
