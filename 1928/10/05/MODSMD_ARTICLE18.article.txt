# FRESHMAN TEAM SET FOR BRONCO GAME TOMORROW
## Hunt Announces Lineup To Start Against Heavy Santa Clarans 
### 
Winding up a week of intensive prac
tice with a fast workout yesterday aft
ernoon, the Cardinal freshman football
eleven has rounded into condition for
its first big game of the season, that
with the Santa Clara yearlings in the
Stadium tomorrow afternoon, begin
ning at 2:30 o'clock. There will be a
brief practice session today for a little
final work on the more intricate plays.
Yesterday's workout was a continua
tion of that of the day before, Coach
"Husky" Hunt spending considerable
time on the development of an effec
tive passing attack. Both line and
backfield candidates worked on the
tackling dummies and were drilled
thoroughly in blocking and tackling. A
half hour's work on the dummy ma
chine for the whole squad completed
the afternoon's program.
Babes Given Even Odds
Plays were being run off with
smoothness yesterday, and the Card
first year men should be given even
odds or better to defeat the heavy
Santa Clara team and avenge the 7-0
victory of the Santa Clara freshmen
last year. The Broncos, however,
looked stronger than they have for
years while being beaten 12-0 by the
California freshmen last Saturday.
The Stanford line will probably be
outweighed man for man, since it av
erages not much more than 180
pounds; while the visiting Santa Clar
ans possess the heaviest team to repre
sent the Catholic school in some time.
However, the Card linemen have speed
and know how to use it, charging fast
and with lots of power.
Lineup Announced
The starting Stanford linemen will
be as follows: Toll, right end; Colvin,
left end; Grey, left tackle; Doub, right
tackle; Toepke, left guard; Brooks,
right guard; and Milligan, center. For
several of these positions there has
been plenty of competition, and the
starters tomorrow aren't sure of their
berths on the first string. Simpson at
left end, Quirk at center, and Hunt at
right guard have looked particularly
good and should all get into tomor
row's grid contest.
Little need be said about the Card
backficld, for the freshman ball-carry
ing quartette is a swcct-looking four
some. Led by Rudy Rintala, speedy
left halfback, and Dusty Allen, hard
plunging fullback, the yearling offense
shows possibilities, with adequate sup
port from the line, of developing into
a great ground gaining machine. The
other halfback berth will be filled by
Wilson, and Marks will start in the
quarterback position. Cadell at right
half and Thigpin at quarter will proba
bly also see action in tomorrow's game.
