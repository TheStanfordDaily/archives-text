# FUNDS GIVEN TO U.C. TO CONDUCT FEVER RESEARCH
## 
### 
In order that any possible dangers
from undulant fever contracted
through use of cows' milk may be
eradicated, the Certified Milk Pro
ducers of California have for the sec
ond time made an appropriation of
$1000, for research by the University
of California under Dr. Karl Meyer,
•director of Hooper Foundation for
Medical Research.
For many years it was thought that
undulant fever could be contracted
only from the use of goats' milk, but
recent investigation has shown that it
is probably also carried by cows' milk.
In recent years the number of cases,
though still comparatively few, have
been on the increase, and definite
steps toward its control are felt
necessary.
The university already has an ex
tensive series of feeding experiments
started, for the purpose of determin
ing how and when the germs causing
•undulant fever are transmitted from
milk to animals. Strangely enough the
fever attacks adults rather than chil
dren, though the children are perhaps
consuming more milk.
