# SOCCER ELEVEN MEETS LEGION IN INITIAL CONTEST
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's soccer var
sity will meet the Palo Alto Ameri
can Legion eleven in its opening con
test of the season at 2:30 o'clock Sat
urday on the varsity field.
The Cards have a number of re
turning lettermen but will be hard
hit by the loss of Captain-elect Alli
son Gibbs. They have had but one
practice session and will be facing
stiff competition in Legionnaires for
their first contest. A number of good
men from last year's freshman team
and a number of junior college trans
fers will give the Cardinals a strong
reserve force.
