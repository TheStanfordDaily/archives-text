# The 						Tie-Up a Failure
## 
### 
Who won the tie-up?
Who killed cock robin?
The interclass fight was a flop. After sixteen or eighteen minutes of
feverish fighting the gun was shot and a half-hearted attempt made by
the judges to determine how many sophomores and how many freshmen
were tied helpless. This was impossible to compute, because there were
hordes of upperclassmen swarming around the prostrate victims, helping
them to wriggle out of their bonds. Nobody knows how many members
of each class were tied, and that is because the spectators were not kept
in the stands. Charles Dickenson is an institution as master of frosh-soph
mud fights; his experience should have forewarned him that the most im
portant thisg to be done at one of this sort of event is to keep spectators
off the field. A "cordon" of student police would have accomplished this.
Of course, it really makes little difference as a matter of record who
won the fight. But when you preach to freshmen for days before the fight
about how fairly it is to be run off, and impress them with the need of
following the rules to the letter, and then bungle, or allow others to bungle,
the actual contest, you have done a lot to undermine the freshmen's faith
in Stanford efficiency (cheers) and to make him cynical. Now who
would want freshmen to be cynical?
Let's give the tie-up a fair chance next year, allowing the participants
alone to do the fighting.
While the tie-up was too perfunctory, the raid on Encina the night be
fore last was an enjoyable brawl for all. No furniture was wrecked;
only water was hurled in the combat. When the sophomores tried to rush
the stairs, Phil Cavalero met them there like Barbara Frietchie and per
suaded them to fight on the outside of the building. There ensued a good
spirited battle which was enjoyed by both sides.
