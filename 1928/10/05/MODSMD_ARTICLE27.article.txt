# Let There Be Gilbert & Sullivan

### 
More requests for a second revival of Gilbert and Sullivan opera have
been received by Gordon Davis than for repetitions of any other produc
tion, and it is on account of this fact that the Dramatic Council and War
ren D. Allen, University organist and director of the vocal work of
"Princess Ida," are looking searchingly for good voices. Lack of compe
tent singers is the only obstacle which will prevent a Gilbert and Sullivan
opera being given this winter.
Vocal talent is difficult to find at Stanford, probably because there is
no musical training of any extent given here, and as a consequence those
blessed with golden throats seldom enter. Nevertheless, tryouts now being
held by Mr. Allen may reveal something astonishing and unexpected in
laryngeal abilities. We heartily urge anyone with even the faintest
thought of his voice-potentialities to turn out for the opera.
The sort of comic operas that W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan
wrote affords, when well presented, about the most delicious evening of
entertainment to be had in the theater, even today.
"H. M. S. Pinafore" or "The Pirates of Penzance" is the Daily's
choice of opera, if singers can be found.
