# An Event Not To Be Missed
## 
### 
President and Mrs. Wilbur have extended a cordial invitation to all
new students to attend their reception tonight at their home. No new man
or woman should miss the reception, for it is one of those affairs which
helps to make Stanford the intimate community that it is.
Freshman sponsors of both Encina and Roble will be present to intro
duce guests to one another. Dancing will be the order of the evening.
