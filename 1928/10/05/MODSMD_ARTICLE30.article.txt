# May Campus Dances Increase
## 
### 
It is not too late to extend the hearty thanks of the Daily and of the
campus also to Toyon Club for allowing the use of its lobby for the Regis
tration Dance of Tuesday night. The number of couples which turned
out showed how popular a campus dance can he if it is given in an attrac
tive place.
The Women's Clubhouse has been remodelled and should prove a better
setting for dances than it has heretofore. Let the campus dance be re
vived !
