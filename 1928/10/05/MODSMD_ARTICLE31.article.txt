# Give Us a Chance!

It takes a few days to get the circulation department of a paper
ganized like the Stanford Daily under way. We admit that our record]
of circulation in past years has not been spotless, but this year we hope
to improve it. Through the failure of the circulation manager to return
to college this quarter, a reorganization of the circulation staff has been
necessary. By Monday our routes will be completed, and each morning
you will be greeted with the Daily at your doorstep. But until then,
bear with us.
