WHICH WAY EDUCATION?
Undergraduates who bay at the
moon and thumb noses at tradition
might well turn their attention to two
ventures in things academic. A cer
tain Dr. Melklejohn, well-known to
pundits, and a certain Dr. Holt, one
time editor of the Independent, are
placing their last dimes upon revo
lutionary ideas in the ways and
means of beating education into these
same undergraduates.
Cries issue from the about-to-be
higher-educated of Down with the ex
amination system! To hell with lec
tures! We want inspired teaching!
and again, No coercion! We won't
keep step!
The Educational Experiment
Did the belligerent young revolu
tionaries consider the thing seriously
before baying? Doctors Meiklejohn
and Holt have both spent their lives
considering the thing and most seri
ously.
At the Experimental College of the
University of Wisconsin, Dr. Meikle
john patiently works with some two
hundred sixty students, trying out his
new ideas, trying to give them sub
ject matter worthy of their active
attention, inspired teaching worthy
of holding that attention, and free
dom in the wide range of subject
matter presented. The work covered
replaces the work done at Stanford
in the lower division.
As freshmen, the Meiklejohn fol
lowers direct their energies toward
studying the age of Pericles, Plato,

and others of the immortals of that
time. With sophomore year, the civili
zation of the United States is thor
oughly studied. Few movements in
the realms of politics, metaphysics,
ethics, or esthetics can not be traced
to beginnings in the epoch of Grecian
achievement considered. Add to that
the study of the achievements in all
fields of our own nation and a founda
tion is gained for specialization and
further study comparable to that
gained in any other university.
Individualism at Collins
Turning from all old standards of
educating and hewing out a course of
his own, Dr. Holt at Rollins College
in Florida has eschewed lectures, ex
aminations, and all the time-honored
devices of pedagogy. In his institution,
the student is given a laboratory or
workshop equipped with instruments,
books, and conveniences for study
along the line he desires to follow.
The professor presents him an outline
of what should be covered and with
the words, "See me if you need help,"
retires, leaving the student to sink or
swim according to his own initiative
and ability. Conferences supplant ex
aminations. Throughout the course,
the advice and assistance of the pro
fessor is available at all times.
These efforts to remodel the pres
ent system of university training are
highly commendable. Perhaps they
are far from perfect, but embryonic
as they may be, they are definite
moves toward an honest revision of
what many decry as a faulty system.
