Poems in Praise of Practically Noth
ing. Samuel Hoffenstein. New York:
(Boni Liveright, 1928.)
Which include "Songs to Break the
Tedium of Riding a Bicycle, Seeing One's
Friends, or Heartbreak," "Poems of Pas
sion Carefully Restrained So as to Of
fend Nobody," and a "Carol for the Day
After Christmas." The author of these
melancholic gems of wit at present has
the distinction of being America's most
famous misogynist, although of course
lie's not really one. He makes nasty
cracks about everyone you know, and
about almost everything you admire, and
you like it. That's what his humor is
like.
Hofifenstein's delicate pastoral verses
suggest an urban upbringing. Witness :
"Along the country roads there grow
Willow-trees and Texaco,
Mobiloils and marigold
And other fruits of men and mould."
Don't you catch it? The beauty of the
open countryside is there, clad in appro
priate nouns, but there is something
more—a jc ne sals quoi which brings one
face to face with the city, and its teem
ing life.
The "Poems" are an ideal specific for
the freshman falling out of love, pre
ventive for the sophomore about to fall
in, a gloom-chaser for undergraduates,
faculty, the Graduate School of Business,
and anyone else you can think of. And
besides, it's the proper book to have on
your desk.

Ballyhoo. By Silas Bent. (New York:
Boni and Liveright, 1927.)
This book is one of the last of the
1927 crop, rather than one hot off the
press; but it loses none of its value and
interest by being a few months old.
It will be both enjoyable and educa
tional (two qualties which our queer
minds have come to think of as not
compatible) not only to the present and
prospective newspaper man, but to every
one who reads a newspaper with any
interest at all.
Bent calls his book a "conspectus of
modern metropolitan newspapers in the
United States." It is a well written and

dramatic presentation of what our news
papers are today, and why.
A few sentences from the introduction
can illustrate the style: "Born in the
Spanish-American War, ballyhoo did
not begin to wax grotesque until the
World War had nursed an abnormal
appetite for sensation.. These two years
were the architects of a gargoyle journal
ism. They did not create the materials
nor direct the builders, but they set the
pattern. If our newspapers have a fan
tastic and leering look to any sober eye,
these crises may be held to blame. They
are mainly responsible for lop-sided sport
sections, wherein the reader vicariously
achieves prodigies of prowess and valor.
They are at the bottom of an unregu
lated volume of propaganda and free
publicity.
"They arc responsible in part at least
for the dubious nature of newspaper
advertising. Their unresisted corrupt in
fluence has misdirected the energies of
the American press and deformed its
output. Ballyhoo is exploited as an emo
tional equivalent of war.
" The metropolitan press sets the
pace and strikes the key in the national
diapason of romance, sex and crime.
"The giants of war, machine produc
tion and a public school system have
dragged the American newspaper unre
sisting by the wrists. But it is now a
giant as well as all of them. If it con
tinues to be dragged about, can it cry
any longer that circumstances are to
blame? It needs to pull itself together.
It needs to be its age."
Silas Bent is a newspaper man with
a varied background of practical experi
ence. When he writes about the press
he draws upon his own personal know
ledge. "Editor and Publisher," the
weekly "bible" of newspaperdom, accuses
Bent of belonging to a certain group of
unsatisfied troublemakers who exagger
ate the faults of the press.
There may be (and probably is) some
truth in that. But, at the same time,
isn't it possible that Bent is cutting a
little too close to the quick in what he
says. Which may account for much of
the discomfort of the profession at his
words.
