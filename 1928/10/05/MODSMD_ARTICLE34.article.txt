Tlic Editor, Sir:
Stanford datc-seekcrs and even those
who may at some time or other have
a telephone call of more serious nature
to make are finding the communication
service on the campus considerably be
low that which is to be expected in a
university community.
The exchange, "P.A. 2900," serves
all the men's dormitories except Se
quoia. This means that the operator
at the board in Toyon handles incom
ing and outgoing calls for over a thou
sand men. Few will doubt but what
that is something of a job for one per
son to handle; why cannot another op
erator be put on?
Present conditions are deplorable. It
takes at least several minutes to get
the operator even to answer a call
made from the hall phones; several
more minutes to get plugged into an
outside line (should that be one's de
sire); wrong rooms are rung when
hall calls are requested; word of long

distance calls is very frequently not
delivered; the operators arc at times
not what one might even call cour
teous. |
Whether present ills are due to in
efficient switch-board operators, too
few operators, or inadequate switch
hoard facilities, the writer does not at
tempt to answer. In this day and age,
when improvement and efficiency is
the universal program, it does not seem
too much to ask that authorities look
into the telephone situation.
It is hoped that the dial system now
being installed hy the phone company
will in a measure eliminate the personal
equation which has in the past been
conducive to anything but satisfactory
service.

town authorities, to keep them off the
