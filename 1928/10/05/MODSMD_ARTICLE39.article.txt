# ARGENTINE POLO PLAYER PRAISED FOR FINE WORK
## Four Horsemen of Pampas Win Over U.S. 10 to 7; Kenny Scores 5 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 4. (/P)â€”Threat
ened with displacement from the Argen
tine team after its defeat in the first
game of the series for the polo cham
pionship of the Americas, Arturo Kenny,
young South American number 1, has
earned for himself a prize on the honor
roll of international polo.
Kenny seemed to be the weak link in
the Argentine four when it lost the
opener, but when the Four Horsemen of
the Pampas came back yesterday to ride
rough shod over the United States to
win 10 to 7 and even the series, Kenny
was, perhaps, the most brilliant of the
four stars.
The Argentine forward, playing in his
first international series, scored five of
his team's goals and helped pave the
way for several others. Captain Jack
Nelson, No. 2, scored three more while
John Miles and Lewis Lacey helped the
cause by fine work on the offense and
the defense.
The United States "Big Four," how
ever, fell below the form displayed in its
brilliant opening victory. The Amer
icans' team work was poor and their
hitting erratic.
The remarkable display of smooth
team work and the return to form of
their horses in yesterday's game makes
the Argentines favorites to win the de
ciding encounter at Meadow Brook Sat
urday. Before the series they were the
first choice but the evidence of the first
game that their ponies had not regained
their best condition after the attack of
influenza that caused the postponement
of the series for nearly a month, lowered
them to the position of under-dogs.
With the Argentines equalling their
vaunted speed and out-playing them in
all other departments, the Americans
never held the lead in yesterday's game.
At half time the score board credited
them with a 5 to 4 margin, but a decision
of the judges disallowing a goal changed
it to a tie.
The United States might have changed
the decision if they had made the most
of their free shots on fouls in one of
the roughest games ever seen on inter
national field. A dozen fouls were called
on each team but Hitchcock only drove
two free shots through the goal and
Lacey missed all but one.
