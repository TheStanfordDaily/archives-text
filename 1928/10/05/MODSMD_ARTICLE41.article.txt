# EASTERN TEAMS DEVELOP USE OF COMPLEX PLAYS
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 4. (jp)—'The fire
works are due to start early in this
season's football campaign in the
East. On every hand coaches are
abandoning the old idea of using only
the simple formations in the early
season games and are working hard
to develop their best scoring plays.
Only Tuss McLaughry at Brown has
indicated his intention of using only
straight football tactics in the opener
against Worcester Poly Saturday.
The Brown varsity romped through
the scrubs for five touchdowns in yes
terday's scrimmage without using
trick plays and McLaughry is satis
fied that his team can get along for a
while on that brand of football.
The bigger colleges, inspired per
haps by the ever-increasing danger of
defeat at the hands of minor oppon
ents, are preparing to take to the air
at the very start. Army, Yale, Prince
ton, and Dartmouth all are working
on their passing offense. Of these only
Dartmouth, stopped by a sudden hot
spell, failed to put in a long day of
hard work yesterday. Harvard, threat
ened by an aerial attack by its first
game opponent, Springfield, worked
on a defense against the pass.
The program for the rest of the
week for most of the Eastern col
leges is to take it easy and not risk
injuries. After yesterday's long scrim
mages, few coaches have scheduled
hand-to-hand encounters with the
scrubs before the games Saturday. At
Penn State the lay-off came even
earlier and yesterday's session also
was devoted to light drill.
Injuries from the scrimmage ses
sions already have begun to hamper
some of the Eastern squads. Johnny
Hoben, Yale quarterback, watched
yesterday's drill from the sidelines
but hopes to be back for the opening
game. The Eli's were more than re
paid for the temporary loss of Hoben,
however, when Firpo Greene and Nor
man Hall, who have been kept from
practice by injuries received during
the summer, turned out. LaFayette
faces the possibility of meeting Muhl
enberg without the services of its
captain, Dick Guest. A slight bump
on the knee, received in Saturday's
game, has caused a considerable
swelling and Guest did not get into
uniform yesterday.

Dartmouth, stopped by a sudden hot
spell, failed to put in a long day of
hard work yesterday. Harvard, threat
ened by an aerial attack by its first
game opponent, Springfield, worked
on a defense against the pass.
The program for the rest of the
week for most of the Eastern col
leges is to take it easy and not risk
injuries. After yesterday's long scrim
mages, few coaches have scheduled
hand-to-hand encounters with the
scrubs before the games Saturday. At
Penn State the lay-off came even
earlier and yesterday's session also
was devoted to light drill.
Injuries from the scrimmage ses
sions already have begun to hamper
some of the Eastern squads. Johnny
Hoben, Yale quarterback, watched
yesterday's drill from the sidelines
but hopes to be back for the opening
game. The Eli's were more than re
paid for the temporary loss of Hoben,
however, when Firpo Greene and Nor
man Hall, who have been kept from
practice by injuries received during
the summer, turned out. LaFayette
faces the possibility of meeting Muhl
enberg without the services of its
captain, Dick Guest. A slight bump
on the knee, received in Saturday's
game, has caused a considerable
swelling and Guest did not get into
uniform yesterday.
NEW YORK, Oct. 4. (jp)—'The fire
works are due to start early in this
season's football campaign in the
East. On every hand coaches are
abandoning the old idea of using only
the simple formations in the early
season games and are working hard
to develop their best scoring plays.
Only Tuss McLaughry at Brown has
indicated his intention of using only
straight football tactics in the opener
against Worcester Poly Saturday.
The Brown varsity romped through
the scrubs for five touchdowns in yes
terday's scrimmage without using
trick plays and McLaughry is satis
fied that his team can get along for a
while on that brand of football.
The bigger colleges, inspired per
haps by the ever-increasing danger of
defeat at the hands of minor oppon
ents, are preparing to take to the air
at the very start. Army, Yale, Prince
ton, and Dartmouth all are working
on their passing offense. Of these only
Dartmouth, stopped by a sudden hot
spell, failed to put in a long day of
hard work yesterday. Harvard, threat
ened by an aerial attack by its first
game opponent, Springfield, worked
on a defense against the pass.
