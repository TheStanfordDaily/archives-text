# LEMOS PROCURES ART COLLECTIONS TO DISPLAY HERE
## Museum Director Obtains Canvases by Prominent European Artists 
### 
Pedro J. Lemos, director of the
Stanford Museum and Art Gallery,
sends word from Europe, where he is
collecting final material for a new
book on European Handicraft, that
two prominent art collections have
been secured for exhibition at the
Stanford Art Gallery during 1929.
One of these will be a collection of
etchings and color prints represent
ing the prominent names among etch
ers of Europe as well as new names
of younger artists. This collection will
represent artists from seven to nine
countries. The second collection will
represent the pottery, textile, toy, and
metal craftsmen of Europe. This col
lection of handicraft will come from
at least six countries and will express
largely the things done since the war.
Europe is reviving and encouraging
many of its older arts, and craftsmen
in many instances are adapting old
techniques to new design expressions,
producing wonderful qualities.
Much of the material for these col
lections is loaned by manufacturers
and private collectors because of their
interest in the publication being pre
pared on the subject by Mr. Lemos.
In addition to this the consular rep
resentatives of the different countries
have assisted Mr. Lemos and co-oper
ated in making accessible many pri
vate and important art handicraft col
lections for his examination.
In addition to these two exhibitions
other collections of art work in Eu
rope and the eastern states will be
arranged for the exhibition gallery at
Stanford by Mr. Lemos on his return
trip which he is now making.
