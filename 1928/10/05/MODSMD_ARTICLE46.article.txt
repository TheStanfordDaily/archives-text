# ROBERT M'WADE DISCUSSES TALKIES; GROUCH PROVES PLEASANT OFF STAGE
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
True to the hoary tradition which
ordains that the disagreeable charac
ters m a play be unusually pleasant
off-stage, Robwrt McWade is really
geniality personified. Because at his
great success last winter as the
grouchy father in "New Brooms,"
Henry Duffy brought him back to the
President Theatre in San Francisco to
be star grumbler in "Daddies."
This time McWade is a bachelor,
and words fail me when I attempt
to record his opinion (as expressed
vehemently on the stage) of matri
mony and its threatening after effects
—children. He provides the audience
with one laugh after another, finally
succumbing to the charms of his
adopted child when he is about to
lose her.
"Plays in "Talkie"
"I just finished one of the leading
parts in the third all-talking movie,"
he told me during a talk before the
show. "It was Warner Brothers' 'The
Home Towners,' and I did the part
which George M. Cohan wrote espe
cially for me. All the important roles
were taken by people with stage ex
perience, with the single exception
of Miss Doris Kenyon. Richard Ben
nett played his first talking picture
role in this production.
"I also played the father in the
screen version of 'New Brooms' sev
eral years ago, but I vastly prefer

working in talkies to silent pictures.
The Warners have a head start on
all the other companies, since they
have been experimenting and making
Vitaphone films for two years.
Likes Silent Movie
"Personally, I would rather see a
silent movie. And still better a stage
play. I don't think talking pictures
will ever be a real rival to the legiti
mate.
"Picture producers have been faced
with a decline in their audiences, and
they are counting on the novelty of
the talkies to bring back the crowds.
At the big picture houses in New
York they have to put on elaborate
stage presentations along with the
films to draw the crowds, and often
the prologues cost the managers
more than the rental of the feature
picture.
"Working in talkies is naturally
very different from the silent movies.
The director cannot holler at the ac
tors, and people with long years of
voice training are needed to do the
acting.
"No, I don't think movie stars who
have had no vocal experience can be
successful in talkies. It takes years
and years to perfect the voice, and
one must start with small roles and
work up—playing as many kinds of
roles as possible.
"What I like about the movies is
down the action. And I infinitely pre

fer seeing a stage play."
McWade is an ardent admirer and
booster of San Francisco. "This city
has retained its cosmopolitan atmos
phere of the old days. The people
here hold on to their picturesque
cable-cars and local individualities;
they enjoy themselves. They support
the opera and the symphony orches
tra much better than does New York
and the big cities of the East. They
love the theatre and patronize good
plays."
The star of "Daddies" talks easily
and evinces a strong loyalty to his
profession. He is a middle-aged man
with a twinkle in his ele, seemingly
enjoying the passing show of life.

"What I like about the movies is
down the action. And I infinitely pre

fer seeing a stage play."
McWade is an ardent admirer and
booster of San Francisco. "This city
has retained its cosmopolitan atmos
phere of the old days. The people
here hold on to their picturesque
cable-cars and local individualities;
they enjoy themselves. They support
the opera and the symphony orches
tra much better than does New York
and the big cities of the East. They
love the theatre and patronize good
plays."
The star of "Daddies" talks easily
and evinces a strong loyalty to his
profession. He is a middle-aged man
with a twinkle in his ele, seemingly
enjoying the passing show of life.
True to the hoary tradition which
ordains that the disagreeable charac
ters m a play be unusually pleasant
off-stage, Robwrt McWade is really
geniality personified. Because at his
great success last winter as the
grouchy father in "New Brooms,"
Henry Duffy brought him back to the
President Theatre in San Francisco to
be star grumbler in "Daddies."
This time McWade is a bachelor,
and words fail me when I attempt
to record his opinion (as expressed
vehemently on the stage) of matri
mony and its threatening after effects
—children. He provides the audience
with one laugh after another, finally
succumbing to the charms of his
adopted child when he is about to
lose her.
"Plays in "Talkie"
"I just finished one of the leading
parts in the third all-talking movie,"
he told me during a talk before the
show. "It was Warner Brothers' 'The
Home Towners,' and I did the part
which George M. Cohan wrote espe
cially for me. All the important roles
were taken by people with stage ex
perience, with the single exception
of Miss Doris Kenyon. Richard Ben
nett played his first talking picture
role in this production.
"I also played the father in the
screen version of 'New Brooms' sev
eral years ago, but I vastly prefer

working in talkies to silent pictures.
The Warners have a head start on
all the other companies, since they
have been experimenting and making
Vitaphone films for two years.
Likes Silent Movie
"Personally, I would rather see a
silent movie. And still better a stage
play. I don't think talking pictures
will ever be a real rival to the legiti
mate.
"Picture producers have been faced
with a decline in their audiences, and
they are counting on the novelty of
the talkies to bring back the crowds.
At the big picture houses in New
York they have to put on elaborate
stage presentations along with the
films to draw the crowds, and often
the prologues cost the managers
more than the rental of the feature
picture.
"Working in talkies is naturally
very different from the silent movies.
The director cannot holler at the ac
tors, and people with long years of
voice training are needed to do the
acting.
"No, I don't think movie stars who
have had no vocal experience can be
successful in talkies. It takes years
and years to perfect the voice, and
one must start with small roles and
work up—playing as many kinds of
roles as possible.
