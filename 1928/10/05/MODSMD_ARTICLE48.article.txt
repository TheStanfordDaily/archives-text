# MARTIN PREDICTS BEST CARD BAND IN RECENT YEARS
## 
### 
"Many excellent new men and a fine
turnout of old :neml>ers shows a promise
of the best Stanford Band in years," said
Dr. Ernest Whitney Martin, Stanford
Band Director, following the opening
practice of the Autumn quarter yester
day afternoon.
Professor Martin is trying a new sys
tem of band arrangement this year which
he believes will improve the instrumenta
tion greatly. The arrangement will cut
the band down to ninety-six players,
forty-eight reeds, forty in the brass sec
tion, and eight drums. Another innova
tion will be the appearance of men and
women in the regular military band.
Professor Martin used women in his sum
mer quarter band and found that it
proved very successful.
A number of new instruments have
been ordered and will be here for the
first public appearance of the band at
the U.C.L.A. game on October 13. The
band will also play at the Nevada game
in the Kezar Stadium in San Francisco
on October 19.
