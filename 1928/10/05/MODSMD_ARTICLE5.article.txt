# TWO MONTHS IN JAIL IS "BOSSY" GILLIS' SENTENCE
## 
### 
SALEM, Mass., Oct. 4 (#>) â€” An
drew J. (Bossy) Gillis, Mayor of New
buryport, today was sentenced to two
months in jail, one to be served at
hard labor, and to pay fines aggregat
ing $545 as a result of his operation
of a gasoline filling station in Ncw
buryport without the formality of ob
taining a permit. Mayor Gillis was re
manded to the Salem jail to begin his
sentence at once.
The disposition of the Gillis case
was made by Judge Nelson P. Brown
in the Suprerior Criminal Court, be
fore whom Mayor Gillis had pleaded
guilty last week to various violations
of state laws and city ordinances. It
brought to a pause, temporarily at
least, the long scries of clashes between
the self-styled "Bad Boy" and the con
servative old residents of the city in
which "Bossy" carried out his threat
to become mayor of the city and "show
them."
