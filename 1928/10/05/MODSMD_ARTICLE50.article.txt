# REPORT ON DRIVE FOR HOME GIVEN BY DR. GARDNER
## Results Surpass Past Years, According to Brooks; $2760 Final Total 
### 
The final report from the Conva
lescent Home Drive of last spring
quarter was made public last night
by the Reverend D. Charles Gardner,
president of the board of trustees of
the Home. The report was prepared
by Baylor Brooks, who was chairman
of the A.S.S.U. drive, which began on
May 14. Brooks was assisted in the
report by Lilian Force, who had
charge of the women's drive.
Ten pages are included in the re
port and a very complete summary of
the work is made. The paper includes
the names of all the committees and
their part of the campaign for funds.
The drive for "Stanford's Own" cov
ered two weeks culminating in Labor
Day where the students of the Uni
versity cleaned up the grounds of the
Convalescent Home, the site of the
old Leland Stanford residence.
Total Near $3000
"Perhaps the first and most obvi
ous thing about the student drive this
year is the result," states Baylor
"The total result from all sources is
?2760. Although this is some seven
hundred dollars shy of the quota of
$3500, the drive netted a considerable i
advance over former student drives."
The plan of the organization of the
drive is given in the report. It is
shown that one day, May 14, was set
as the day for the biggest effort in
the work. "It is a recognized fact that
Stanford students at least seem to be
come antagonized rather than sof
tened by nagging and repeated stimu
lation. For this reason all speaking,
and advertising, other than news
paper publicity, ceased with the close
of the set day of the 14th.
"Student treasurers were of course
busy finishing details of collection,
especially in the case of the pledges,
until the close of the week."
Committees Praised
Tribute is paid by Brooks to his
various committees who, through
their co-operation with the chairman,
put over the drive. "Most important
perhaps was the Financial committee.
It was the duty of this committee to
back up the work of the other three
committees by a thorough canvass of
the living groups through a system j
of sub-treasurers. Under Robert |
Fraser, '27, were Norman Springer
and Herbert Wenig who had charge
of the financial side of the drive for
the Row and the Halls respectively.
The Advertising committee per
formed its work under Hugh Brown
which "consisted in a general broad
cast and notification to the more or
less charitably sleepy campus." There
follows a complete description of the
methods of bringing the drive home
to the campus. "Selecting an appro
priate slogan from those suggested,
the co-operation of the Art Depart
ment, the Dramatic Council, the Li
brary, and the A.S.S.U. was enlisted
to advertise the fact of the annual
appeal through the slogan 'Stanford's
Own'."
