# HYLAND WRITES OF WARNER'S SUCCESS
## Pop Turns to Football When "Glass Arm" Blights Baseball; Tricky Dick Reminisces of College Days 
### 
A great halfback writes of a great
coach in the November issue of College
Humor, and the reader learns much of
both author and subject. Richard "Tricky
Dick" Hyland, one of Stanford's most
noted and most dangerous players, tells
what his three years under Coach Pop
Warner have taught him.
Before going to Cornell, where he be
came captain of the football team, Pop
had brilliant visions of one Glenn Scobey
Warner winding 'em around some be
fuddled batter's neck. But a "glass arm,"
suffered in his sophomore year ended
that. He turned to football. With his
two hundred and fifteen pounds, he was
quite clever in those days of push, pull,
maul, and maim days. In fact, he was
so good that he started teaching his per
sonal tricks to other elevens.

No Cussing

Cussing football players was the thing
to do then. A good player, "unless he
had hell bawled out of him" would just
naturally deteriorate. Such was Pop's
theory until he started out to teach the
rules of the game to the Carlisle In
dians. The Indians, says Hyland, did not
like to be cussed. In fact, they reacted so
definitely that Warner had dreams of
losing an A-l scalp.
Pop changed his vocabulary immedi
ately. His one remaining weakness is
"What the hell did he do that for?"
During the course of Hyland's "Re
member when's," a few remarks came
forth which appear most interesting to
those who witnessed some of the efforts
of recent Stanford teams. For example:
The Washington game at Seattle in
1925. Hyland, himself, had called for
a kick on third down. The pass from
center was bad, and Hyland, believing
that the kick would be blocked, hit out
for the tumbling mess in front. In the
train compartment, on the way home,
Warner remarked, "Well, it looked to me
like you had made up your mind before
the signal to run around end and win
the game all by yourself. Next time you
want an end run, call it. Some of the
boys might be able to give you a little
help."

The St. Mary's game at Stanford in
1927. The Cardinals were twice within
two yards of a score, mostly because of
plays called elsewhere than in the vicin
ity of an All-American center and two
strong guards. Eight times, then, the
Stanford plays were called through the
center of the line, and eight times the
Saints held. Later, Pop told the team,
"I told Lewis two weeks ago to use

the very plays he did if we got within
the other team's five-yard line on first
down, so don't criticize him for calling
them. ... it seems to me that no team
has any kick coming if it can't make two
yards in four downs."
The U.S.C. game at Stanford in 1927.
With the ball on U. S. C.'s three-yard
line Pop sent a man in with instructions
to tell the quarter to call a play which
would send Fleishhacker off tackle. It
was never called because before the new
man could legally relay the message, the
quarter called a pass play which crossed
up the opposition and scored. Pop was
given credit in the papers and the stands
for calling that play. Pie said afterwards
he "damned near fell off the bench"
when he saw it start.

The Santa Clara game in 1927. Stan
ford, after winning a hard game from
Washington, met Santa Clara the fol
lowing week, while Warner was at
Berkeley scouting California. There was
a terrific let-down, and the underdogs
won. On the following Monday he came
out to practice, called the men around
him, and looked every individual in the
eye. The expression on his face was one
of "mingled indignation, pity, rage, con
tempt, incredulity, disgust, nausea, and
heartbreak. Eventually he found two
sentences that he thought appropriate.
"What a lousy bunch of fatheads you
are. Sit down and think that over for
one minute and then get to work on the
dummies." Three dummies were torn
loose in three minutes, and the next Sat
urday, Coach Price watched Stanford
rip through his Golden Bears.

Warner remarked, "Well, it looked to me

the signal to run around end and win

want an end run, call it. Some of the

The St. Mary's game at Stanford in
1927. The Cardinals were twice within
two yards of a score, mostly because of
plays called elsewhere than in the vicin
ity of an All-American center and two
strong guards. Eight times, then, the
Stanford plays were called through the
center of the line, and eight times the
Saints held. Later, Pop told the team,
"I told Lewis two weeks ago to use

the very plays he did if we got within
the other team's five-yard line on first
down, so don't criticize him for calling
them. ... it seems to me that no team
has any kick coming if it can't make two
yards in four downs."
The U.S.C. game at Stanford in 1927.
With the ball on U. S. C.'s three-yard
line Pop sent a man in with instructions
to tell the quarter to call a play which
would send Fleishhacker off tackle. It
was never called because before the new
man could legally relay the message, the
quarter called a pass play which crossed
up the opposition and scored. Pop was
given credit in the papers and the stands
for calling that play. Pie said afterwards
he "damned near fell off the bench"
when he saw it start.

Makes Players Work

The Santa Clara game in 1927. Stan
ford, after winning a hard game from
Washington, met Santa Clara the fol
lowing week, while Warner was at
Berkeley scouting California. There was
a terrific let-down, and the underdogs
won. On the following Monday he came
out to practice, called the men around
him, and looked every individual in the
eye. The expression on his face was one
of "mingled indignation, pity, rage, con
tempt, incredulity, disgust, nausea, and
heartbreak. Eventually he found two
sentences that he thought appropriate.
"What a lousy bunch of fatheads you
are. Sit down and think that over for
one minute and then get to work on the
dummies." Three dummies were torn
loose in three minutes, and the next Sat
urday, Coach Price watched Stanford
rip through his Golden Bears.
A great halfback writes of a great
coach in the November issue of College
Humor, and the reader learns much of
both author and subject. Richard "Tricky
Dick" Hyland, one of Stanford's most
noted and most dangerous players, tells
what his three years under Coach Pop
Warner have taught him.
Before going to Cornell, where he be
came captain of the football team, Pop
had brilliant visions of one Glenn Scobey
Warner winding 'em around some be
fuddled batter's neck. But a "glass arm,"
suffered in his sophomore year ended
that. He turned to football. With his
two hundred and fifteen pounds, he was
quite clever in those days of push, pull,
maul, and maim days. In fact, he was
so good that he started teaching his per
sonal tricks to other elevens.

No Cussing

Cussing football players was the thing
to do then. A good player, "unless he
had hell bawled out of him" would just
naturally deteriorate. Such was Pop's
theory until he started out to teach the
rules of the game to the Carlisle In
dians. The Indians, says Hyland, did not
like to be cussed. In fact, they reacted so
definitely that Warner had dreams of
losing an A-l scalp.
Pop changed his vocabulary immedi
ately. His one remaining weakness is
"What the hell did he do that for?"
During the course of Hyland's "Re
member when's," a few remarks came
forth which appear most interesting to
those who witnessed some of the efforts
of recent Stanford teams. For example:
The Washington game at Seattle in
1925. Hyland, himself, had called for
a kick on third down. The pass from
center was bad, and Hyland, believing
that the kick would be blocked, hit out
for the tumbling mess in front. In the

Warner remarked, "Well, it looked to me

heartbreak. Eventually he found two
sentences that he thought appropriate.

A great halfback writes of a great
coach in the November issue of College
Humor, and the reader learns much of
both author and subject. Richard "Tricky
Dick" Hyland, one of Stanford's most
noted and most dangerous players, tells
what his three years under Coach Pop
Warner have taught him.
Before going to Cornell, where he be
came captain of the football team, Pop
had brilliant visions of one Glenn Scobey
Warner winding 'em around some be
fuddled batter's neck. But a "glass arm,"
suffered in his sophomore year ended
that. He turned to football. With his
two hundred and fifteen pounds, he was
quite clever in those days of push, pull,
maul, and maim days. In fact, he was
so good that he started teaching his per
sonal tricks to other elevens.

No Cussing

Cussing football players was the thing
to do then. A good player, "unless he
had hell bawled out of him" would just
naturally deteriorate. Such was Pop's
theory until he started out to teach the
rules of the game to the Carlisle In
dians. The Indians, says Hyland, did not
like to be cussed. In fact, they reacted so
definitely that Warner had dreams of
losing an A-l scalp.
Pop changed his vocabulary immedi
ately. His one remaining weakness is
"What the hell did he do that for?"
During the course of Hyland's "Re
member when's," a few remarks came
forth which appear most interesting to
those who witnessed some of the efforts
of recent Stanford teams. For example:
The Washington game at Seattle in
1925. Hyland, himself, had called for
a kick on third down. The pass from
center was bad, and Hyland, believing
that the kick would be blocked, hit out
for the tumbling mess in front. In the
train compartment, on the way home,
Warner remarked, "Well, it looked to me
like you had made up your mind before
the signal to run around end and win
the game all by yourself. Next time you
want an end run, call it. Some of the
boys might be able to give you a little
help."

Lewis Exonerated

The St. Mary's game at Stanford in
1927. The Cardinals were twice within
two yards of a score, mostly because of
plays called elsewhere than in the vicin
ity of an All-American center and two
strong guards. Eight times, then, the
Stanford plays were called through the
center of the line, and eight times the
Saints held. Later, Pop told the team,
"I told Lewis two weeks ago to use

the very plays he did if we got within
the other team's five-yard line on first
down, so don't criticize him for calling
them. ... it seems to me that no team
has any kick coming if it can't make two
yards in four downs."
The U.S.C. game at Stanford in 1927.
With the ball on U. S. C.'s three-yard
line Pop sent a man in with instructions
to tell the quarter to call a play which
would send Fleishhacker off tackle. It
was never called because before the new
man could legally relay the message, the
quarter called a pass play which crossed
up the opposition and scored. Pop was
given credit in the papers and the stands
for calling that play. Pie said afterwards
he "damned near fell off the bench"
when he saw it start.

Makes Players Work

The Santa Clara game in 1927. Stan
ford, after winning a hard game from
Washington, met Santa Clara the fol
lowing week, while Warner was at
Berkeley scouting California. There was
a terrific let-down, and the underdogs
won. On the following Monday he came
