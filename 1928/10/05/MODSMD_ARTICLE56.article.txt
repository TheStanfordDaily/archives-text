(Paul Sc.no n, a former member of the
Daily, has returned to the staj after having |
spent two summers as one of Mrs. Herbert !
Hoover's secretaries while she was in Califor- |
nia. He knows personally many of Mr. Hoo- '
ver's confidants, and for that reason is well j
equipped to discuss politics from the Stanford-
Hoover angle.â€”Editor.)
Word from Hoover headquarters in |
Washington indicates a steadily increas- j
ing feeling of confidence on the part of i
"professional" political critics and dope
sters that the Republican candidate will
carry the nation with a substantial major
ity in the election next month.
Of chief interest to the Stanford'
campus apropos of the last minute poli
tical developments comes the announce
ment that Herbert Hoover's last appeal
to the voters of the nation will be made
from his San Juan Hill home on the
night before election day. Elaborate pre
parations for a spectacular radio hook-up
which will reach from the Pacific Coast
to the farthest tiny nook in the state of
Maine will soon get under way with
the Hoover home as a base.
According to present plans, the Hoover
family will reach their home on the
campus, following a speech-making trek
across the continent, either one or two
days before election dav.
Accompanying Mr. and Mrs. Hoover
will he Allan Hoover, who is expected to
receive his degree from Stanford next
March. Herbert Hoover, Jr., '25, the I
eldest son, will reach the campus on i
October 18th, where he will join his j
wife, nee Margaret Watson, '25, and \
their two children, who arc now at the '
Hoover home.
