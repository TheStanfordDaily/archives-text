# CRIPPLED YANKEE TEAM DEFEATS CARDS
## Waite Hoyt Pitches 4-1 Victory in Opening Game of 1928 World Series; Allows Opponents Only Three Hits

YANKEE STADIU M, NEW
YORK, Oct. ,4 (#•) —For a crew of
cripples and invalids, there's still quite
a kick in the old Yankee boatload.
Opening fire where they left off last
year, the world's champion New York
Americans, behind the brilliant sharp
shooting of Waite Hoyt, shelled the
St. Louis Cardinals into submission by
a score of 4 to 1 in the opening game
of the 1928 World Series.
Before a crowd of 61,425 that fell
far short of record breaking expecta
tions, Hoyt held the Cardinals to three
hits, one of them a home-run by Jim
Bottomley, while the big guns of the
Yankees man o' war, Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig and Bob Meusel, fired the shots
that routed Willie Sherdel, clever St.
Louis southpaw, and the National
League champions.
They may be limping a trifle on the
field, these Yankees, while more se
verely injured mates are on the side
lines, but there is nothing the matter
with their batting eyes when hits count.
The pitching staff may be shot to
pieces but with Hoyt around to do a
full day's work, there's at least one
mighty right arm left to repel most any J
boarding party in sight or spike the
enemy's guns.
With one of the best world series
games he has ever pitched, and he has
turned in a number of sparkling per
formances, Hoyt spiked all the Cardi
nal Big Berthas today with the excep
tion of Bottomley. Sunny Jim's homer
into the right center section of the
outfield bleachers was a robust clout,
in the seventh inning. He also punched
out a line single in the ninth as a fare
well shot, but otherwise the only Car
dinal to hit safely was George Wash
ington Harper.

hits, one of them a home-run by Jim
Bottomley, while the big guns of the
Yankees man o' war, Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig and Bob Meusel, fired the shots
that routed Willie Sherdel, clever St.
Louis southpaw, and the National
League champions.
They may be limping a trifle on the
field, these Yankees, while more se
verely injured mates are on the side
lines, but there is nothing the matter
with their batting eyes when hits count.
The pitching staff may be shot to
pieces but with Hoyt around to do a
full day's work, there's at least one
mighty right arm left to repel most any J
boarding party in sight or spike the
enemy's guns.
With one of the best world series
games he has ever pitched, and he has
turned in a number of sparkling per
formances, Hoyt spiked all the Cardi
nal Big Berthas today with the excep
tion of Bottomley. Sunny Jim's homer
into the right center section of the
outfield bleachers was a robust clout,
in the seventh inning. He also punched
out a line single in the ninth as a fare
well shot, but otherwise the only Car
dinal to hit safely was George Wash
ington Harper.

YANKEE STADIU M, NEW
YORK, Oct. ,4 (#•) —For a crew of
cripples and invalids, there's still quite
a kick in the old Yankee boatload.
Opening fire where they left off last
year, the world's champion New York
Americans, behind the brilliant sharp
shooting of Waite Hoyt, shelled the
St. Louis Cardinals into submission by
a score of 4 to 1 in the opening game
of the 1928 World Series.
Before a crowd of 61,425 that fell
far short of record breaking expecta
tions, Hoyt held the Cardinals to three
hits, one of them a home-run by Jim
Bottomley, while the big guns of the
Yankees man o' war, Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig and Bob Meusel, fired the shots
that routed Willie Sherdel, clever St.

into the right center section of the

in the seventh inning. He also punched
out a line single in the ninth as a fare
well shot, but otherwise the only Car

YANKEE STADIU M, NEW
YORK, Oct. ,4 (#•) —For a crew of
cripples and invalids, there's still quite
a kick in the old Yankee boatload.
Opening fire where they left off last
year, the world's champion New York
Americans, behind the brilliant sharp
shooting of Waite Hoyt, shelled the
St. Louis Cardinals into submission by
a score of 4 to 1 in the opening game
of the 1928 World Series.
Before a crowd of 61,425 that fell
far short of record breaking expecta
tions, Hoyt held the Cardinals to three
hits, one of them a home-run by Jim
Bottomley, while the big guns of the
Yankees man o' war, Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig and Bob Meusel, fired the shots
that routed Willie Sherdel, clever St.
Louis southpaw, and the National
League champions.
They may be limping a trifle on the
field, these Yankees, while more se
verely injured mates are on the side
lines, but there is nothing the matter
with their batting eyes when hits count.
The pitching staff may be shot to
pieces but with Hoyt around to do a
full day's work, there's at least one
mighty right arm left to repel most any J
boarding party in sight or spike the
enemy's guns.
With one of the best world series
games he has ever pitched, and he has
turned in a number of sparkling per
formances, Hoyt spiked all the Cardi
nal Big Berthas today with the excep
tion of Bottomley. Sunny Jim's homer
into the right center section of the
outfield bleachers was a robust clout,
in the seventh inning. He also punched
out a line single in the ninth as a fare
well shot, but otherwise the only Car
