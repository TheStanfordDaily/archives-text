# BLAME CANNERS FOR PEACH PRICE BATTLE IN STATE
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 4. (/p)â€”De
fense of the Canners League of Cali
fornia's refusal to pay $25 a ton for
cling peaches because the pack ex
ceeded 13,000,000 cases was under
taken today by a league committee
which prepared a written statement
outlining their position and blaming
the situation on canners who tailed
to help curtail the pack.
"Nearly all co-operative canners
and a very limited number of com
mercial canners failed to join the
movement," says the statement, in
part. "Clearly, the full responsibility
for the situation rests with those who
not alone failed to join in the efforts
at curtailment, but who at no time
during the negotiations presented a
plan of their own, or apparently made
any effort along curtailment lines."
Controversy Related
The statement related the canners'
version of the history of the peach
controversy from June 8, when Gov
ernor C. C. Young's conference com
mittee predicted an 18,000,000-case
crop and which canners agreed to cut
to 13,000,000, to the present, when a
pack of 14,800,000 cases has been an
nounced.
"The claim is made that the grow
ers are not responsible for the fact
that the pack was not held to 13,000,-
000 cases," continued the statement.
"Surely, after their continuous effort
since June 22 to control the pack, the
commercial canners cannot be held
responsible. The claim is also made
that the receiving by members of the
Canners* League was not sufficiently
strict. We believe the growers will
agree that the league receiving was,
on the whole, far more strict and
uniform than was the receiving done

by co-operative canners.
"The point is made that growers
have received less money in total for
their fruit than would have been the
case if the quantity packed uad been
held to 13,000,000 cases. This surely
is true, and is exactly the reason that
in the interests of growers and can
ners, this organization has made every
effort to hold the pack down to the
point where it could be marketed at
a higher price and the growers would
be paid more money. It is an undis
puted economic fact that a surplus
always reduces the price at which a
commodity is bought and sold."
The statement said the price of $25
or more reported paid by southern
California canners was due to a crop
failure there, adding that those who
paid high prices did so on the chance
that northern canners would curtail
the pack and force prices up.
