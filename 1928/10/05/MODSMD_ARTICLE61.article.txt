# DRY STATES SHOULD REMAIN DRYâ€”SMITH
## 
### 
ALBANY, N. Y., Oct. 4
ernor Smith holds that states wanting
prohibition should be permitted to re
main dry under the eighteenth amend
ment.
The Democratic presidential nomi
nee re-emphasized this contention in
replying to a criticism that if he were
really consistent he would advocate
outright repeal of the prohibition
amendment.
The governor directed his remarks,
made at a press conference at his capi
tol offices, at a speech made last night
before a group of Republican women
in New York by James W. Wads
worth, a former Republican senator
from this state.
