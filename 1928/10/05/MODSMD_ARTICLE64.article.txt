# WORLD'S SERIES HEROES

Another world series has started off
with a loud noise, and perhaps a brief
glance at the pitching records of some
of the former October classics will
not be untimely. The name of Christy
Mathewson dominates the hurling
performances, for the courageous
"Big Six" not only pitched the most
innings of any moundsman in cham
pionship contests, 103 2-3; the most
innings in one series, 29 2-3; and the
most, shut-out games, 4; but his feat
of beating the Athletics three times

in the 1905 series without allowing a,
run is without parallel in the history
of the "October Excitement."
"Big Six" was beaten, however,
beaten five times, which puts him in
a tie with Plank, Marquard, and Bush
for the doubtful honor of the most de
feats, total series. "Matty" took part
in four different classics, and all his
defeats came in the 1911, 1912, and
1913 series. On October 17, 1913,
Matty lost a game because "Home
Run" Baker knocked one of his offer- j

J ings into the stands.
"Chief" Bender stands at the top
| of the list with six world series vic
l tories and 59 strikeouts, but the mark 1
of Connie Mack's great Indian hurler
: may be equaled, if not bettered, by
r Hevb Pennock in the coming battles. 1
, "Southpaw Herb" has won five games
and lost none, as did Jack Coombs of
the Athletics in 1910, '11, and '16,
i pitching in two leagues.
"Babe" Adams, a youngster of the
| Pirate pitching staff in 1909, jumped ;

j into stardom almost overnight by de-
Heating Ty Cobb and his Tigers three
! times when it was doubtful if he could
! last one game. Stan Coveleskie and
Coombs also won three games in one
! series while losing none, as did Matty,
■ of course, in 1905. Another feather in
Herb Pennoclc's cap is his record of
pitching two tliree-hit games—on Oc
tober 1, 1926, against the Cardinals,
| and on October 7, 1927, against tlie
Pirates. Let's hope that his arm allows
i him to add to his wonderful record.

glance at the pitching records of some
of the former October classics will
not be untimely. The name of Christy
Mathewson dominates the hurling
performances, for the courageous
"Big Six" not only pitched the most
innings of any moundsman in cham
pionship contests, 103 2-3; the most
innings in one series, 29 2-3; and the
most, shut-out games, 4; but his feat
of beating the Athletics three times

in the 1905 series without allowing a,
run is without parallel in the history
of the "October Excitement."
"Big Six" was beaten, however,
beaten five times, which puts him in
a tie with Plank, Marquard, and Bush
for the doubtful honor of the most de
feats, total series. "Matty" took part
in four different classics, and all his
defeats came in the 1911, 1912, and
1913 series. On October 17, 1913,
Matty lost a game because "Home
Run" Baker knocked one of his offer- j

J ings into the stands.
"Chief" Bender stands at the top
| of the list with six world series vic
l tories and 59 strikeouts, but the mark 1
of Connie Mack's great Indian hurler
: may be equaled, if not bettered, by
r Hevb Pennock in the coming battles. 1
, "Southpaw Herb" has won five games
and lost none, as did Jack Coombs of
the Athletics in 1910, '11, and '16,
i pitching in two leagues.
"Babe" Adams, a youngster of the
| Pirate pitching staff in 1909, jumped ;

j into stardom almost overnight by de-
Heating Ty Cobb and his Tigers three
! times when it was doubtful if he could
! last one game. Stan Coveleskie and
Coombs also won three games in one
! series while losing none, as did Matty,
■ of course, in 1905. Another feather in
Herb Pennoclc's cap is his record of
pitching two tliree-hit games—on Oc
tober 1, 1926, against the Cardinals,
| and on October 7, 1927, against tlie
Pirates. Let's hope that his arm allows
i him to add to his wonderful record.

Another world series has started off
with a loud noise, and perhaps a brief
