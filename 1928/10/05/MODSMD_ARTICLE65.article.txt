# CHAPEL HISTORY TO BE SUBJECT OF TALK SUNDAY
## Dr. Gardner Says Memorial Church Is Expression Of Woman's Soul 
### 
Stanford's Memorial Church will be
Dr. Gardner's subject in his sermon
Sunday morning in the Chapel. The
University chaplain will speak of the
church and its history in the life
of Stanford.
Dr. Gardner is especially qualified
to speak on the history of Stanford's
Chapel because he has been associ
ated with it for the past twenty-five
years, having known the church since
its dedication in 11)03.
"The Chapel is the symbol of a
woman's love and devotion, and at
the same time proof of her piety,
large-mindedness, and wisdom," said
Dr. Gardner last night in speaking of
the founding of the Chapel. "Mrs.
Leland Stanford founded this church
â€¢as a memorial to her husband, and
to foster the spiritual life of the Uni
versity. Here in the building and or
ganization of the church, the genius
of Mrs. Stanford is most truly demon
strated."
