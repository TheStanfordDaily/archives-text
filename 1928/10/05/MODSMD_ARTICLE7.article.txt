# Mystery Shrouds Suicide Attempt Of Obregon Son
## Assassinated President's Son Will Recover Claimed By Doctors 
### 
MEXICO CITY, Oct. 4. (/P)—Hum
berto Obregon, 21, eldest son of the
late General Alvaro Obregon, was ex
pected tonight at the White Cross
hospital here to recover from a bullet
wound in his left breast inflicted in
the early hours of this morning.
In the meantime two explanations
have been made of the wound, one
by friends that he shot himself in an
attempt at suicide, and another, by
the police, that he accidentally shot
himself.
The generally accepted version of
the shooting is that between 2 and 3
o'clock this morning young Obregon
was returning from a ball with a
group of friends, among them a
Senorita Florita Vega, described as
his fiance. Their automobile stopped
in front of the residence of Fernando
Torreblanca, where Humberto was to
spend the night.
The youth had left the automobile
and was seen to fire a pistol which
he held in his hand, some say, aiming
it at his heart.
The friends assisted him to the
White Cross hospital where it was
found that the bullet entering the left
breast had been deflected by a rib
before it reached his heart.
Here the friends are said to have
given their version of the shooting,
declaring that young Obregon had
shot himself and assigning as a rea
son a growing despondency since the
death of his father last summer. Pre
viously, however, police headquarters
had given out a statement in which
it was said he had fallen to the
ground as a result of a slight acci
dent earlier and had discharged the
gun accidentally in his fall.
