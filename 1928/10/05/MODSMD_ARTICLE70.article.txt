# POTTERY OWNED BY BYRON GIVEN TO LIBRARY HERE
## 
### 
Three pieces of Egyptian and Cypri
ote pottery, which belonged to Lord
Byron, have been recently presented
to the library by Dr. Casey Wood of
Stanford.
When Lord Byron was dying in
April 1824 in Missolenghi, where he
had sailed on his expedition to aid the
Greeks, he was attended by several
physicians, among them Julius Millin
gen. This young doctor must have
made a friend of the poet for he gave
him a small collection of ancient pot
tery. These were inherited by his son,
who gave them to Dr. Casey Wood in
1896, when he visited Constantinople.
Dr. Wood then gave them to the Stan
ford Library.
Another gift of five volumes of Art
Studies from the Harvard University
Press was made to the library recently.
These are on the history of art and are
a repository for articles in Medieval,
Renaissance, and Modern fields written
by scholars. They cover art from all
over the world, and have been sent to
the outstanding universities.
