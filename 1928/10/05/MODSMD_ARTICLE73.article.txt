# Library Issues Pamphlet For Student Information
## 
### 
The Stanford University Libraries
have recently issued a new pamphlet
for the information of freshmen and
new students. This is a simple expla
nation of the catalog, reference circu
lation, and reserved book divisions. Ar
rangement will be made later to give
more extended instruction in the use of
library resources to these students.
This circular should be retained for
use at that time.
