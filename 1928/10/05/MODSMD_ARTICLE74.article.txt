# MUNRO ARTICLE BRINGS CENSURE ON PROFESSORS

"College professors as a class," says
Professor Win, B. Munro of Harvard
in the October Atlantic Monthly, "are
quick to see the mote in the other fel
low's eye. They take the righteousness
of their own institutions as self-evident.
In their courses on public finance, busi
ness organization, and accounting, they
will dissect a municipal budget or a
corporation balance sheet with caustic
comments, forgetting that criticism,
like charity, can sometimes make its
best beginnings at home.
"Let me give an illustration. In the
latest financial report of a certain
American university there is a list of
invested funds which constitute the en
dowment. It includes a block of Gen
eral Electric common, nearly sixteen
thousand shares, the value of which is
given as one dollar! The actual value
of that stock, as a matter of fact, is
more than two million dollars."
Such methods, the professor de
clares, are necessary if the college is
to go to its alumni and ask for more
funds.
"I have known a college," he con
tinues, "to announce a deficit at the
end of a year, and to plead urgently
with its alumni for contributions on
that account, when the total income
actually exceeded the total expendi
tures for that year by several hundred
thousand dollars.
The situation is gradually improving,
Professor Munro says, "but there is
still some distance to be covered be
fore the college professor of business
administration can feel himself safely
out of a glass house."
