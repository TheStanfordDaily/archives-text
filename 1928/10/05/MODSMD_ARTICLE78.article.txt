# TROJAN ELEVEN RESTING UP FOR OREGON CONTEST
## Coach Howard Jones Gives Men Hard Workouts; Tappaan Is Back 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4. Light
scrimmage by way of tapering off for
their struggle with the strong Oregon
State varsity was ordered today by
Coach Howard Jones for his Trojan
footballers.
Francis Tappaan was back at his
right end position for practice today.
The star wingman was kicked in the
faoe during scrimmage on Tuesday
and believed to have a fractured jaw,
but an X-ray showed only a chipped
cheek bone and bruises, which will
not prevent his playing.
Use Ghost Ball
The old white ball was brought out
yesterday as Coach Jones worked his
men far into the night. Beginning the
week with a startling reorganization
of the first-string line and an un
usually hard workout, the coach lias
kept his new arrangement intact and
has not let up on the labor, with the
result that his team appears to work
much smoother than it did against
the Utah Aggies last Saturday.
Jones' new arrangement of lines
men puts Captain Jesse Hibbs at left
end on offense, with Jesse Shaw work
ing the all-American's right tackle
position. Charley Boren and Clark
Galloway are installed at guards with
Frank Anthony at left tackle. Tappaan
works at right end. On defense Hibbs
returns to his tackle berth. Shaw
moves over to guard and Boren goes
on duty at end. This defensive forma
tion is calculated to embarrass the
Oregon tackles as well as to give
greater deception. Hibbs becomes a
ball-carrying threat when he goes
back in punt formation.
Backfield Named
Russ Saunders still holds forth at
fullback, the Iron Man, at the half
back positions.
The Spartans, composed of Trojan
ineligibles and what-nots, prompted
by Jeff Cravath, took the part of the
gentlemen from Corvallis during a
run-off of many Oregon players last
night.
