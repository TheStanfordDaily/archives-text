# SQUAD SYSTEM TO BE USED BY DEBATING TEAM
## 
### 
The squad system for varsity de- j
bating was unanimously accepted at j
yesterday's meeting. This system, i
which has been successfully used at {
U.S.C. and Occidental, brings all var- !
sity members together in a unified '
group which works on questions, a
team being selected from the squad 1
two or three weeks before the debate. '
A meeting will be held Monday night
at 7:30 o'clock in room 201. All per
sons interested in trying out for the \
squad may give a five-minute talk on
the chances of Hoover or Smith in the j
coming election. Tryoutees will be
judged by the coach and all former i
debaters, who are automatically on the j
squad.
Steve Halsted, manager, announced
the tentative schedule for the coming
year. A dual debate with California
will be held this fall. During winter i
quarter there will probably be debates
with U.S.C., Occidental, Washington,
Arizona, Pomona, and Oregon State
College.
The spring program should offer spe
cial inducement for tryoutees, as two
trips will be made by separate teams, i
one north and one south. The south
ern trip will include return debates for
those held winter quarter, and the trip
north will be routed through Oregon,
Washington, British Columbia, to
Idaho, where the Pacific Forensic Con
test will take place. The Joffrc de
bate with California will also occur
Spring quarter.
