# FOUR-YEAR REIGN OF HAGEN ENDS WITH DIEGEL WIN
## 
### 
FIVE FARMS COURSE, BALTI
MORE, Md„ Oct. 4 (iT")—The miracle
happened. The jinx is broken. Walter
Hagen was beaten by Leo Diegel to
day in the quarter finals of the Na
tional Professional golf title tourna
ment and his four-year reign as cham
pion is at an end. The score was 2 up
and 1 to play.
For the first time since 1923 when
Gene Sarazen nosed him out in the
final by one up in 38 holes, the Great
Sir Walter met a man who could match
him in competitive spirit and skill in
this pro fixture over which Hagen has
exercised paternalistic rule for so long.
Diegel fairly won his victory and a
chance at the championship by fighting
off one of Hagen's famous rallies and
holing out a 14-foot putt for a birdie
2 on the 35th green. It was up to the
Ilaig then to do the same if he was to
save his crown and he missed by about
three inches.
The downfall of Hagen, around
whom a tradition of invincibility had
been woven because of the regularity
with which he had won this title, to
tally eclipsed in the eyes of the big
gallery, the other three semi-final
matches in which Gene Sarazen, A1
Espinosa, and Horton Smith of Jopliiij
Mo., emerged victorious.
Sarazen, who is to battle Diegel in
tomorrow's play won by the convincing
margin of 7 and 6 over Fred Dudley,
long-driving young husky from Los
Angeles. Espinosa's margin was 5 and
4 over Jock Hutchinson, veteran ex
champion, while Smith, a newcomer to
national golfing fame, downed Perry
Del Vecchio of Greensburg, Pa., an
other newcomer, by a margin of 2 up.
