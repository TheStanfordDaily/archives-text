# CROWD'S SPIRIT AT RALLY DELAY IS APPRECIATED
## 
### 
Appreciation of the cheerfulness
with which the crowd of several hun
dred persons waited at the railroad
depot in Palo Alto for more than 40
minutes yesterday to give the varsity
football squad a send-off, was ex
pressed last night by David Jacobson,
rally committee chairman.
Jacobson said that the long delay
was unavoidable and resulted princi
pally from the early close of the tie
up, which it was thought would last
considerably longer than was the
case. Also, the train was delayed in
Palo Alto because of the necessity of
loading a large amount of express,
Jacobson explained.
There will be one more send-off
rally this year when the varsity .squad
leaves for Los Angeles for the U.S.C.
game, it was stated. Jacobson said
that at that time those students who
go to Palo Alto to attend the rally
will not have to wait for more than
ten minutes at the most.
