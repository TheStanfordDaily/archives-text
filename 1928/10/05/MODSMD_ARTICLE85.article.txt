- their season tickets early for the series.
"The later the students wait to pur
chase their scats the poorer the loca
tion will be," declared Madden.
"There will be <a particularly fiine
tfroup of artists. Beginning with Tfb
fcett on October 26, through the fifth
concert, the series will be one of great
'interest and pleasure to music-lovers."
Matzcnauer, who comes here No
vember 20, possesses a voice that for
• sheer vocal beauty has few peers. This
Hungarian artist's remarkable voice
!enables her to sing contralto as well
as soprano roles.
She was born in Hungary, the
daughter of an orchestral conductor
.and an opera singer, and received an
•excellent musical training. She was
taught piano and singing, but her early
desire was to be an actress. She made
her debut as Puck in "Oberon" at
.Strassburg. She was called to the
Hopfer in Munich where she graced
the world-renowned stage until coming
to America.
Matzenauer has sung at Beyreuth
at the great Wagner music festivals
and in the principal centers of Europe
and South America. Since 1911, she
has been associated intimately with
music in the United States and is
known in all the leading music centers.
It is perhaps the personality of Mat
zenauer that electrifies her audiences.
The scope and opulence of her wonder
ful voire, and her striking figure make
her a radiant and fascinating picture.
Her versatility is so extensive that she
can vary her song selections so as to
please all—a little classic, some mod
ern, a touch of Spanish or Russian,
perhaps French chansons or English
ballads and some American music.
Having just completed her season at
the New York temple of art, she is
engaging in an annual concert tour,
and will appear on the Stanford campus
November 20 under the auspices of the
Associated Students.
