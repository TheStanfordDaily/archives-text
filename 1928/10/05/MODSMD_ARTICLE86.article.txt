### 
LAKELAND, Fla., Oct. 4 (/P) â€”
Branded as Communists, five members
of the United Brotherhood of Carpen
ters and Joiners of America were ex
pelled from the organization today by
delegates attending their twenty-sec
ond annual convention at the new na
tional home here.
Expulsion of four members was an
nounced last night and today the name
of the fifth was erased from the rolls.
The deposed men were former mem
bers of Local 376, New York, the
charter of which was revoked for al
leged irregularities by the general
board of the brotherhood, and until
their expulsion had been members of
Local 1164, New York. They are Mor
ris Rosen, Nathan Rosen, his brother;
Thomas Schneider, former member of
Local 2090; Robert Golden and Jo
seph Lapidas.
The vote for expulsion was unani
mous.
Morris Rosen, at the request of
President William L. Hutcheson and
Secretary Frank Duffy, was granted
the floor to state his case. He charged
the charter of Local 376 had been re
voked under guise of irregularities and
that the local had been persecuted.
