# REDSKINS FIGHT OVER "PALEFACE" POLITICAL MODES
## 
### 
WINNEMUCCA, Nev. Oct. 4. (/P)â€”
Poor Lo is on the warpath again. There
are no tomahawks or bows and arrows
but protests of six chiefs and 400 war
rior braves rang over the desert at a
gathering of Indians at Fort McDermitt,
near here, today.
This time the "pipe of peace" was laid
aside to war against the method of pale
face politicians. Tribesmen from South
ern Idaho, Western Utah, Northern and
Western Nevada, Northern California
and Southern Oregon have signed a pact
that they are "not going to vote for the
pale faces' government.
"We are going to turn our backs on
$20 bills, hugs and kisses the candidates
like to give us.
"Furthermore, we are going to get
our rights if we have to fight."
The Indians said the result of the pow
wow was held because Uncle Sam had
broken treaties with them and that the
Great White Father had given them
"meaningless citizenship." The redmen
believed that they would lose all their
rights if they exercised their franchise at
the ballot box.
The decree continues "We ask the gov
ernment to set aside land where we can
live and be freed of ninety-seven years
of ruthless exploitation by bureau agents.
We want the right to hunt at any time
of the year and not be molested by game
wardens."
