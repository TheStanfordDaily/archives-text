# MEXICO TO HAVE NEW PASSENGER AIR MAIL LINES
## 
### 
MEXICO CITY, Oct. 4 (^P) —Still
stimulated by the "spirit of Lind
bergh," Mexico is planning further ad
vancement in aviation.
A new air mail and passenger service
from Vera Cruz to Merida, Yucatan,
is scheduled to start about October 15.
With previously established services
this means that within less than a year
since Lindbergh's flight from Washing
ton to Mexico City this country has
made more progress in aviation than
it had in all the time before Lind
bergh'sflight.
Most of this is due directly or in
directly to the interest in aviation and
the ambition to excel therein, that
Lindbergh's flight aroused in Mexico.
He inspired Carranza and Fierro,
Mexico's greatest aces, the first of
whom met death in the United States
while returning Lindbergh's good will
flight. The interest in aviation, he
caused, made possible the establish
ment of air mail and passenger service
here.
A limited air service was operating
between Mexico City and Tampico
when Lindbergh flew to Mexico. It
has since been increased and now oper
ates between Mexico City, Tupan, and
Tampico.
The first air mail service between
Mexico City and the United States
began Oct. 1. This is to be followed
by the Vera Cruz and Marido service
which will make connections with the
Mexico City-Tupan-Tampico service.
The Mexican aviation company oper
ates these services and the Mexican
government department of communi
cations operates the Mexico City-La
redo air mail service which connects
with the air mail routes of the United
States.
