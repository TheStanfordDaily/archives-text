# ROBINSON FLAYS RECENT RECORD OF REPUBLICANS
## Vice – Presidential Nominee Calls Hoover Humorist In Oklahoma Talk 
### 
CHICKASHA, Okla, Oct. 4 (/P) —
Senator Joseph T. Robinson, in a
speech prepared for delivery here to
night said that "Herbert Hoover has
established a reputation as a humor
ist," by declaring that the seven and
a half-year record of Republican con
trol "constitutes a period of rare cour
age in leadership and constructive gov
ernment." Senator Robinson's address
closed his three-day campaign in Okla
homa.
The Democratic vice presidential
nominee said in his prepared manu
script that it was difficult to under
stand how such a statement could be
made in "good faith," by the Republic
an presidential candidate nor could he
see how Republican spokesinen ex
pected "to hoodwink" the voters of the
nation.
Mr. Robinson tomorrow enters New
Mexico where he will speak on succes
sive nights at Clovis and Roswell.
On his way into that state, however,
the Senator will speak at Amarillo,
Tex., in which state he opened his
campaign more than a month ago with
a Labor Day address at Dallas.
The Democratic candidate tonight
again opened up on the Republican
record and in his prepared address de
clared that the Republicans had
reached the "climax in bombast" by
putting in their platform a declaration
which he quoted as follows:
"There will be no relaxation of reso
lute endurance to keep our elections
clean, honest and free from taint of
any kind. The improper use of money
in government and political affairs is a
great national evil."
He argued that the declaration em
bodied the "only accurate language"
contained in the platform with respect
to the "manner in which the govern
ment has been carried on during the
last eight years."
"No sane persons would think for
a moment, that the Republican candi
dates or their managers have the
slightest connection with this foulness
and all accept their statements of dis
claim, yet two facts remain. First,
somebody is paying out hundreds of
thousands of dollars for the printing
and distribution of this literature and
secondly we cannot escape the fact
that the Republican candidates stand
to benefit to some extent by this ig
norant, bigotted vote. This they can
note escape."
