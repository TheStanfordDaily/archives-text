# Babe Swimming Tryouts Point To Good 32 Team
## 
### 
Freshman swimming tryouts have been
conducted during the last week by Ted
Smith, freshman swimming coach. Berke
ley and Palo Alto high schools have sup
plied their usual large quota of good
material. However, there are a number
of good men from more distant schools,
such as John MacKelvey, a backstroke
swimmer from New York.
Another promising swimmer is Ward
Woods, formerly of the Olympic Club
and a leading contender for the P. A. A.
Junior 100 yard championship.
Virginia plans to co-operate with
the District of Columbia in making
both sides of the Potomac river, in
the vicinity of Washington, attractive.
