## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4. (JP)—Upon
his return to Washington today, Senator
Norbeck, Republican, South Dakota,
called upon President Coolidge and ex
pressed the view that Governor Alfred
E. Smith, on his Western trip had 'failed
to set the prairies on fire." The South
Dakotan, however, did not visit the
headquarters of Herbert Hoover, the Re
publican candidate, and no explanation
of this action was forthcoming.
The South Dakota senator has been
under treatment at Rochester, Minn., for
some months and is now under medical
injunction against active participation in
the campaign.
South Dakota is for Hoover, Senator
Norbeck said, but the situation in the
other Northwestern states as he sees it,
is not so good fey Republican success
this fall. Many persons who heard the
New York governor over the radio failed
to be impressed by his speeches, he assert
ed, and that many of them received the
impression that Smith did not measure
up to the requirements of the Presidency.
