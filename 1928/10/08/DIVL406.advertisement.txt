THAT'S the telephone"Hello" in Madrid. In London, it's cc Are
you there?" But in many foreign countries, Americans find a
universal language in the telephone salutations. It's good old
"Hello"—a subtle tribute to the fact that the telephone is an
American invention.
And so it is with elevator service. Even though they say"Diga"
in Spain, the architects of the magnificent new Madrid Telephone
Building unhesitatingly said "Otis" because Spain demanded the
last word in elevators. You will find in Madrid the same type of Sig
nal Control Elevators that are now installed in those monumental
telephone buildings in America, in New York, Cleveland, St. Louis
and San Francisco.
