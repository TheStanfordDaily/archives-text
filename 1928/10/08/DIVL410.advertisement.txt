DRY GINGER ALE
Evening after evening those connoisseurs who
gather in Manila clubs passed judgment on a
ginger ale —till all pronounced it worthy of !
the name: "Isuan." In all the world they had
never tasted a mineral water like Isuan. So
tonic, so refreshing. Then came the juice of
fresh ginger; of tangy, fresh limes in varying
proportions until finally there was brought to
them the blend supreme.
Now, Isuan Dry is here! It is imported for
you, bottled and foiled from the Philippines.
