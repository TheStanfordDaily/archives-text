# WILBUR TALK SCORES HONOR SYSTEM HERE
## President Gives Outline of Opportunities Open to Students Entering Stanford 
### 
"The honor system at Stanford has
started to creak," said President Wil
bur in his annual welcoming address
Friday morning. "There is a certain
cynical attitude on the part of some
students who cut corners snort for
themselves and smile at the honor
system. When they begin that, it
means they are mentally rotten."
Dr. Wilbur will appoint a commit
tee to investigate the attitude of stu
dents toward the system. "It is up
to you whether you want to see the
Stanford stap on a crook. Can the
men and women of Stanford let the
system die?" was Wilbur's challenge.
"It is one of the best things you have,
but if you don't want it sound and
clean you may not have it."
Personal Contact Offered
"The faculty is made up of a group
of men who have made striking suc
cesses in their fields. Your opportun
ity to come into contact with them is
the great opportunity that Stanford
presents," said Wilbur in outlining the
advantages offered here. He spoke
too of the Ryan laboratories, the
Guggenheim Foundation, and the new
laboratories at Pacific Grove.
Students have been chosen lately
more for the aptitude test and per
sonality than for scholarship, and the
material as a consequence seems to
be better in the opinion of the presi
dent. The independent study plan Dr.
Wilbur spoke of as a "real chance,"
and urged students to undertake it.
"Avoid Prejudice"
"Don't build up new prejudices; get
rid of old ones, and cultivate the sci
entific attitude. Tradition is whole
some if it holds to wholesome things.
If it needs artificial stimulation we
might as well let it drop; it will die
soon anyway.
"Try to get into your work right
away," Dr. Wilbur advised both new
and old students. "You have got the
world of opportunity before you. Don't
sit down and take everything as
though it were settled."
