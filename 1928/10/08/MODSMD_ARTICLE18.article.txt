# METHODIST TEAM NEARLY DEFEATS ARMY'S ELEVEN
## Boston College Beats Navy 6-0; Wisconsin Downs Not re Dame 22-6

NEW YORK, Oct. 7. (£>)—lt looks
as though Navy Bill Ingram was cor
rect when he said he couldn't tell
which of three teams was his varsity,
tnat Knute Rockne had much reason
for pre-season gloom, and the dope
sters were right when they tagged
the "dynamite" sign on the Southern
Methodists of Dallas, Texas.
A wild and woolly football Saturday,
replete with huge scores, gave the
East two distinct shocks. The first
was in Navy's second straignt defeat
of the season, this time by Boston
Lunege, 6 to 0, and the stirring battle
the Southern Methodists made to
lower Army's standards in the first
intersectional meeting of the East
and Southwest. Army won 14 to 13,
but only after facing such an aerial
attack as the East never saw before.
The Midwest saw two stunning up
sets in the overwhelming uefeat of
Rockne's Romers from Notre Dame by
vvisconsin, 22 to G, and Ohio Wesley
an's decisive triumph over Michigan,
17 to 7. Indiana had a rugged time
beating Oklahoma.
Harvard, Yale, and Princeton got
away to high-powered starts, rolling
up large scores. All seem headed for
robust seasons.
The East long will remember the
first invasion of Southern Methodist':-
Mustangs. Leading a bewildering at
tack of single, double, and triple later
al passes, Redman Hume, the Mustang
field general, found time to throw
close to fifty forward passes during
the afternoon. Time and again the
Methodists failed to score by the mar
gin of a fingertip as passes dropped
into receivers' arms and out again
with a clear field ahead. Hume tried
a field goal from the 40-yard line that
missed that by inches. The final
whistle blew as Sammy Reed grabbed
the last one on Army's 15-yard line
and then slipped and fell flat in his
anxiety to get across the goal line.
