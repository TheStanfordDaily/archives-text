# VARSITY SOCCER ELEVEN TRIMMED BY LEGION TEAM
## 
### 
After only two days of practice for
the season the varsity soccer squad
pitted itself against the team of the
Palo Alto American Legion Saturday
■afternoon on the varsity field, taking
as a result the small end of a 4-0
score. The American Legion squad
consisted of only eleven men but each
man proved to be an experienced
player, botli individually and as a
part of the unit.
In the Stanford squad were from
twenty to thirty men, each endeavor
ing to show his skill, in order that he
might be one of the chosen eleven to
play on the varsity for the coming
year.
The American Legion kicked over
its first goal in the first ten minutes
«f the first half. For the remainder of
the twenty-five minute half, there was
much running, passing, and kicking
of the ball, but nothing was accom
plished in the way of piling up scores.
Again early in the second half, the
American Legion kicked a second
goal. In order that Harry Maloney,
coach of the Cardinal team, might
have more time to see his men in
■action, and to try the various ones out
in different positions, the time of the
second half was extended to forty-five
minutes. In the last two minutes of
play the American Legion team
scored two more points, making the
final score 4-0.
