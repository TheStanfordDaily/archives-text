# CARDINAL TEAM SHOWS POWER IN 26-12 VICTORY OVER OREGON
## Wilton Redeems Self After Poor Start; Artman Stars at Tackle 
### 
After successfully taking the first
hurdle in their six-hurdle race to a
Conference championship, tne Stan
ford gridiron warriors arrived home
last night from Eugene where they
landed a 26-12 trimming to Coach
McEwan's giant Oregon University
eleven in the first Conference game
of the season for both teams.
It was a nasty pill for the Gold and
Green outfit to swallow; they were
pointed for the Cardinals and, by rea
son of meeting the Cards in early
season, expected to trip up Pop War
ner's supposedly undeveloped team.
The Oregonians have one consolation
■ —that is, that they were defeated by
a much more powerful team that had
to fight to win its victory. At that,
the victors out-thought, outplayed, and
outfought their rivals.
Oregon Scores First
Oregon scored in the first half-min
ute of play when McCutchan, Web
foot guard, fell on the ball booted by
Kitzmiller on the opening kickoff.
Frank Wilton touched the ball before
it bounded over the Stanford goal
where the Oregon guard came into
possession of it, thus making it a
touchdown.
The Northerners again scored in
the first half when Kitzmiller threw
a pass to his teammate, Mason, who
received the ball over the end line.
Oregon did not score again.
Cards Show Power
Stanford let loose its first demon
stration of power in the second quar
ter. Led by Halfback Wilton, who was
fighting to redeem himself for allow
ing the first enemy score, Warner's
team started a spectacular drive down
the field from kickoff. In three plays
Wilton covered twenty-nine yards. The
Cards continued the drive, only to
miss a score by inches. Wilton ran
back the Oregon punt to the 27-yard
line. On the fourth play following,
Hoffman passed to Wilton for the
Cards' first score. Sims failed to con
vert.
Oregon received but could not make
yards. After a couple of plays they
punted to Wilton who, with the aid
cf Sims' interference, again ran the
ball to the Oregon 27-yard line. A
Hoffman-to-Fleishhacker pass, an Ore
gon penalty, and then Captain Biff
crashed through for a touchdown and
later converted for the extra point.
Muller Scores
"Mush" Muller, replacing Dick
Worden, scored the next touchdown
by intercepting a pass in the last
twenty seconds of play in the first
half. In the third quarter Smalling
recorded the final score of the game
after the Stanford eleven had moved
up the yard-sticks five successive
times. Numerous substitutes finished
the game.
That Stanford outplayed Oregon is
evident when one examines the statis
tics of the game. The most outstand
ing statistical comparison is that the
Cards earned sixteen first downs to
the Webfooters' six.
The entire starting backfield, Hoff
man, Fleislihacker, Sims, and Wilton
shone brilliantly at intervals. Herb
and Biff played through the whole
game. Last week the scribes said that
"Fleishhacker played the greatest
game of his career." That statement
can now be applied to Saturday's
game.
Artman and Sellman at tackles were
the big stars of the line and continu
ally broke up plays behind the Green
and-Gold line. Artman's weight and
strength is a valuable asset to the
Cardinal line after a season's absence
from the lineup. Post, Heinecke, Ro
besky, Worden, and Muller each
earned a share of glory on the line.

ner's supposedly undeveloped team.
The Oregonians have one consolation
■ —that is, that they were defeated by
a much more powerful team that had
to fight to win its victory. At that,
the victors out-thought, outplayed, and
outfought their rivals.
Oregon Scores First
Oregon scored in the first half-min
ute of play when McCutchan, Web
foot guard, fell on the ball booted by
Kitzmiller on the opening kickoff.
Frank Wilton touched the ball before
it bounded over the Stanford goal
where the Oregon guard came into
possession of it, thus making it a
touchdown.
The Northerners again scored in
the first half when Kitzmiller threw
a pass to his teammate, Mason, who
received the ball over the end line.
Oregon did not score again.
Cards Show Power
Stanford let loose its first demon
stration of power in the second quar
ter. Led by Halfback Wilton, who was
fighting to redeem himself for allow
ing the first enemy score, Warner's
team started a spectacular drive down
the field from kickoff. In three plays
Wilton covered twenty-nine yards. The
Cards continued the drive, only to
miss a score by inches. Wilton ran
back the Oregon punt to the 27-yard
line. On the fourth play following,
Hoffman passed to Wilton for the
Cards' first score. Sims failed to con
vert.
Oregon received but could not make
yards. After a couple of plays they
punted to Wilton who, with the aid
cf Sims' interference, again ran the
ball to the Oregon 27-yard line. A
Hoffman-to-Fleishhacker pass, an Ore
gon penalty, and then Captain Biff
crashed through for a touchdown and
later converted for the extra point.
Muller Scores
"Mush" Muller, replacing Dick
Worden, scored the next touchdown
by intercepting a pass in the last
twenty seconds of play in the first
half. In the third quarter Smalling
recorded the final score of the game
after the Stanford eleven had moved
up the yard-sticks five successive
times. Numerous substitutes finished
the game.
That Stanford outplayed Oregon is
evident when one examines the statis
tics of the game. The most outstand
ing statistical comparison is that the
Cards earned sixteen first downs to
the Webfooters' six.
The entire starting backfield, Hoff
man, Fleislihacker, Sims, and Wilton
shone brilliantly at intervals. Herb
and Biff played through the whole
game. Last week the scribes said that
"Fleishhacker played the greatest
game of his career." That statement
can now be applied to Saturday's
game.
Artman and Sellman at tackles were
the big stars of the line and continu
ally broke up plays behind the Green
and-Gold line. Artman's weight and
strength is a valuable asset to the
Cardinal line after a season's absence
from the lineup. Post, Heinecke, Ro
besky, Worden, and Muller each
earned a share of glory on the line.
After successfully taking the first
hurdle in their six-hurdle race to a
Conference championship, tne Stan
ford gridiron warriors arrived home
last night from Eugene where they
landed a 26-12 trimming to Coach
McEwan's giant Oregon University
eleven in the first Conference game
of the season for both teams.
It was a nasty pill for the Gold and
Green outfit to swallow; they were
pointed for the Cardinals and, by rea
son of meeting the Cards in early
season, expected to trip up Pop War
ner's supposedly undeveloped team.
