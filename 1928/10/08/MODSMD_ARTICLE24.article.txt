# Dr. Wilbur Recommends
## 
### 
"Mentally rotten" was the phrase President Wilbur used at the
Friday assembly in denouncing students who are not ruled by the honor
spirit. The words are strong, but not, to the Daily's way of thinking, too
strong, and they have an aptness which ought to make them as popular
as the president's terrible warning of two years ago : "gasoline and alcohol
do not mix."
As to the meaning behind the saying of the phrase, there is much to
be explained. When the chemical pronouncement was made to the wait
ing freshmen two years ago, Dr. Wilbur was being facetious. But when
he thundered out to the assembly last Friday that a cheater is "mentally
rotten," he meant it.
The honor system is now on trial at Stanford—Dr. Wilbur's attitude
makes that clear. A commission is to be appointed by Philip Cavalero,
A.S.S.U. president, and the chairmen of the student councils, to study
how to make it survive. That is well. Offhand, one can think of a
number of remedies to administer to it, one of which would be the
abolition of any compulsory pledge to its observance.
But let a commission study night and day as long as it please, nothing
will result toward strengthening the spirit of honor unless every student,
underclassman, upperclassman, or graduate, resolves upon two things:
(1) to observe the honor system implicitly himself, and (2) to actively
frustrate, in whatever way promises to be effective, anyone else's attempt
to violate it.
In addition to other campaigns which appear destined to interrupt
this busy quarter, an effort to reinstate the honor system to the place
of unmitigated respect it once had will be made. There is nothing the
Daily is more ready to commend to the student body and to support.
Let us consider the rest of the speech. Dr. Wilbur succeeded in
clearing up a number of worries which have bothered the general mind.
The Administration, he declared, has no thought of abolishing fraterni
ties from the campus, but intends rather to provide dormitories of the
sort Toyon and Branner are for their use. The purpose.of eliminating
the long-existent geographical estrangement of hall and row is a good
one, and the provision of comfortable and safe quarters for fraternity
men at a minimum cost is laudable, as every man will agree who thought
longingly of Toyon rooms when he pledged.
The President's remark about figuratively chasing burros is one
which freshmen particularly ought to take to heart. Wasting time trying
to get up enough steam to pop off with a big noise is futile. A spent
firecracker is rubbish. Not long ago a high school orator, having secured
admission to the University, went to pay a call upon the President, pre
senting a letter of introduction from Dr. Wilbur's brother, the secretary
of the navy. The President looked it over, then leaned back in his chair,
and said: "Well, I hope now that we won't hear from you for a couple
of years." In that comment there is wise advice for freshmen who might
be impatient to get their names into the headlines.

Friday assembly in denouncing students who are not ruled by the honor
spirit. The words are strong, but not, to the Daily's way of thinking, too
strong, and they have an aptness which ought to make them as popular
as the president's terrible warning of two years ago : "gasoline and alcohol
do not mix."
As to the meaning behind the saying of the phrase, there is much to
be explained. When the chemical pronouncement was made to the wait
ing freshmen two years ago, Dr. Wilbur was being facetious. But when
he thundered out to the assembly last Friday that a cheater is "mentally
rotten," he meant it.
The honor system is now on trial at Stanford—Dr. Wilbur's attitude
makes that clear. A commission is to be appointed by Philip Cavalero,
A.S.S.U. president, and the chairmen of the student councils, to study
how to make it survive. That is well. Offhand, one can think of a
number of remedies to administer to it, one of which would be the
abolition of any compulsory pledge to its observance.
But let a commission study night and day as long as it please, nothing
will result toward strengthening the spirit of honor unless every student,
underclassman, upperclassman, or graduate, resolves upon two things:
(1) to observe the honor system implicitly himself, and (2) to actively
frustrate, in whatever way promises to be effective, anyone else's attempt
to violate it.
In addition to other campaigns which appear destined to interrupt
this busy quarter, an effort to reinstate the honor system to the place
of unmitigated respect it once had will be made. There is nothing the
Daily is more ready to commend to the student body and to support.
Let us consider the rest of the speech. Dr. Wilbur succeeded in
clearing up a number of worries which have bothered the general mind.
The Administration, he declared, has no thought of abolishing fraterni
ties from the campus, but intends rather to provide dormitories of the
sort Toyon and Branner are for their use. The purpose.of eliminating
the long-existent geographical estrangement of hall and row is a good
one, and the provision of comfortable and safe quarters for fraternity
men at a minimum cost is laudable, as every man will agree who thought
longingly of Toyon rooms when he pledged.
The President's remark about figuratively chasing burros is one
which freshmen particularly ought to take to heart. Wasting time trying
to get up enough steam to pop off with a big noise is futile. A spent
firecracker is rubbish. Not long ago a high school orator, having secured
admission to the University, went to pay a call upon the President, pre
senting a letter of introduction from Dr. Wilbur's brother, the secretary
of the navy. The President looked it over, then leaned back in his chair,
and said: "Well, I hope now that we won't hear from you for a couple
of years." In that comment there is wise advice for freshmen who might
be impatient to get their names into the headlines.
