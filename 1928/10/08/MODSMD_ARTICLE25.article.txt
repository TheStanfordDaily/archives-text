A Smith club, "organized in opposition to the University's entering
politics," is projected in a rather expensive political advertisement which
appeared in last Friday's Daily.
Now of all good reasons for organizing a Smith club here (and we
are inclined to think that there are many), opposition to the University's
entering politics seems to us about the weakest. What would the opposing
gentlemen have done if they had been on the Board of Trustees and one
of their number (not either of themselves, of course) had been nominated
for the Presidency and wanted to come to his home on the campus to be
notified? Would they have refused the use of a logical place, the
Stadium? They would not. They would have granted its use and re
ceived in turn their tickets to seats on the platform in front of all the
cameras.
Why should there be opposition to the University's entering politics
as far as it has done so in this campaign? As a matter of fact, most of
the "entering" has been done by officers of it in their private roles as
citizens. To be sure, there is a University rule against University build
ings being used for any political purposes, but it is time for an exception
when one of Stanford's most noted alumni, a heavy benefactor, a resident
of the community, and a trustee wants to make an important public
pronouncement, albeit the same is most violently partisan politically.
We hope a Smith organization thrives and grows here during the
month, just as we hope the Norman Thomas club grows, or that the
already established Hoover club goes on. But we thought there were
some reasons for pulling for Smith other than that his chief adversary
happened to use his University's athletic arena as a place for making
an acceptance speech.
