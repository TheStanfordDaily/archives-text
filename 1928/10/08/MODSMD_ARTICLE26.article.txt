A question has arisen as to why Roble sponsors must pay room rent
when sj>onsors living at Encina are not required to. This seems to be
one of those cases where the women come out on the short end of it.
Roble sponsors are carefully chosen by the Dean and Women's
Council in order that there may be a selected and representative group
to help the new women. This means that the sponsors are naturally those
who are the busiest in othfcr student activities. They must devote a great
deal of their time to their charges, and this takes away from all their

other work. In their duties of sponsorship they have proved themselves
successful in both the past and present. Certainly they are as efficient
and as of much value as the men sponsors.
Sorority women who are living at Roble as sponsors are required to
pay the club dues as well as those of their individual living groups.
These women are actually not members of Roble Club, and we see no
reason why they are required to pay the extra pittance.
At Encina, the dining hall sponsors receive their board as well as
room free. As sponsors at Roble are also dining hall sponsors, on this
same basis they ought to get both board and room gratis.
