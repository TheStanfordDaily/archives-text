# The 						Bullsession
## 
### 
THAT THE BLIND MAY SEE
Two years ago, had I read the fol
lowing paragraphs, I would have
seized my typewriter, I would have
would have indited a letter, teeming
with vitriolic remarks and addressed
to the editor of Bullsession. Let those
who would hurl missiles, hurl them.
Later another generation will gather
up those same missiles and throw
them at those who hurl now. To sopho
mores are these lines dedicated.
Having successfully weathered the
winds of freedom that blow in and
about the Farm, for a year, sopho
mores are born. They are a sturdy
lot. With freshmanic enthusiasm
they have investigated, read, and
vented their desire to know during
that year. A shining new weapon is
placed in the hands of these yearlings,
the ability to see their past environ
ment as it stands in the scheme of
things. They see its prejudices, its
blindness, its faults, its intolerance,
its set way of doing things. They re
sent this, and justly. But with Hrue
intolerance of youth and character
istic extravagant gesture, they set

out to revise that past environment.
In their eyes, the old gods have
feet of clay. Even so, these young
reformers fail to comprehend the
strength of years. Beliefs held for
a generation and held by the fathers
before cannot be shaken by a sudden
squall of enlightenment, kicked up
by downy-chinned youth. Failing to
appreciate their parents' comfort and
happiness in the old faiths, they
buckle on the mail of agnosticism,
mount steeds of scientific attitude,
and rush into the lists against the
dragon of blind faith. Fortunately
the dragon proves a kindly one for
the most part, and the knights er
rant aren't consumed.
Not that sophomores, or any of like
brew, should not relish skepticism,
cherish agnosticism, and delight in
being cynics—for such are aspects of
growth, sweeping away clouds of
prejudice and rediscovering the clear
skies of thought — but these same
wise-fools should see that the elder
generation relishes its faith, cherishes
its beliefs, and delights in its optim
ism with equal sincerity.

THAT THE BLIND MAY SEE
Two years ago, had I read the fol
lowing paragraphs, I would have
seized my typewriter, I would have
would have indited a letter, teeming
with vitriolic remarks and addressed
to the editor of Bullsession. Let those
who would hurl missiles, hurl them.
Later another generation will gather
up those same missiles and throw
them at those who hurl now. To sopho
mores are these lines dedicated.
Having successfully weathered the
winds of freedom that blow in and
about the Farm, for a year, sopho
mores are born. They are a sturdy
lot. With freshmanic enthusiasm
they have investigated, read, and
vented their desire to know during
that year. A shining new weapon is
placed in the hands of these yearlings,
the ability to see their past environ
ment as it stands in the scheme of
things. They see its prejudices, its
blindness, its faults, its intolerance,
its set way of doing things. They re
sent this, and justly. But with Hrue
intolerance of youth and character
istic extravagant gesture, they set

out to revise that past environment.
In their eyes, the old gods have
feet of clay. Even so, these young
reformers fail to comprehend the
strength of years. Beliefs held for
a generation and held by the fathers
before cannot be shaken by a sudden
squall of enlightenment, kicked up
by downy-chinned youth. Failing to
appreciate their parents' comfort and
happiness in the old faiths, they
buckle on the mail of agnosticism,
mount steeds of scientific attitude,
and rush into the lists against the
dragon of blind faith. Fortunately
the dragon proves a kindly one for
the most part, and the knights er
rant aren't consumed.
Not that sophomores, or any of like
brew, should not relish skepticism,
cherish agnosticism, and delight in
being cynics—for such are aspects of
growth, sweeping away clouds of
prejudice and rediscovering the clear
skies of thought — but these same
wise-fools should see that the elder
generation relishes its faith, cherishes
its beliefs, and delights in its optim
ism with equal sincerity.
—Calvin D. Wood.
