The Editor, Sir:
Now that tuition fees are within a
bargain-sale margin of $100, it may
be permissible for one of the long
suffering check-signers to enter his
weak protest against the most recent
rise in the price of Stanford educa
tion.
When the fees are raised to cover
the true costs of administration of the
University plant proper, there may be
no ground for protest. We all know
that the education we receive costs
more than we pay for it.
But most of us expect the Univer
sity to concern itself with the minds
of its students, and to leave to the
able-bodied man or woman whatever
financial benefit may accrue from that
physical condition without forcing
him to bear a part of the expense of
treating those who need the attention
of physicians.
The student hospital fund, which
now is enlarged by some $9000 per
quarter, never has proved of any par
ticular benefit to a great majority of

us. It only acts to make it cheaper
to go to the hospital than to a physi
cian's office when suffering from a
bloody nose or a boil. The physical
examination aspect is of little inter
est. The old system apparently was
sufficient to protect the University
community, and cheerfully enough
left the individual's own further wel
fare to himself.
There is no indication that the an
cient advice to "see a doctor" will be
much added to by the payment of $3
more per quarter. Why not let us
know we'll get real medical advice
in return for that money?
The question isn't whether the ad
ditional charge may or may not bene
fit some of the students, but whether
the additional charge is so necessary
to the continued education of a ma
jority of Stanford's students as to
make imperative this addition to a
fee already so high as to be prohibi
tive to many who are prospectively
excellent material for this University.
