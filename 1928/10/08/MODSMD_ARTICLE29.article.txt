Home to Harlem. By Claude McKay.
(New York: Harper and Broth
ers, 1928.)
Copper Sun. By Countee Cullen. (New
York: Harper and Brothers,
1927.)
Here are two books by negroes. One
is a novel, Home to Harlem; the
other is verse. Through them both
there runs that strong negro con
sciousness of oppression and inferi
ority. It is like a hot wind sweeping
across a desert that cannot be evaded
or escaped. It hangs like a leaden
fetter on the minds of contemporary
negro writers.
The sense of inferiority that a white
civilization forces upon the negro is
a deep, bitter venom resting at the
soul's bottom of the educated ones.
Countee Cullen says in a short verse:
"If for a day joy masters me,
Think not my wounds are healed;
Par deeper than the scars you see,
I keep the roots concealed.
They shall bear blossoms with the
fall;
I have their words for this,

Who tend my roots with grains of
gall,
And suns of prejudice."
We find the same spirit in Home to
Harlem. The negro student, Ray,
j dreams of having an equal chance
i with a white as the climax ol a dope
dream. He is bitter. He sees edu
cation as serving to make the negro
even unhappier than he is in igno-
I ranee. He says, "No, modern educa
tion is planned to make you a sharp,
snouty, rooting hog. A negro getting
|it is an anachronism. We ought to
get something new, we negroes. But
we get our education like —like our
houses. When the whites move out,
we move in, and take possession of
the old dead stuff."
But unhappy Ray is not the main
character in Home to Harlem. The
story is of a strapping, handsome buck
negro named Jake. Jake Is a steve
dore. He loves whiskey and soda (he
learned in England not to take his
! whiskey straight). He loves women.
| He loves jazz.
Now Claude McKay, the author, i 3
| a negro and knows Harlem. He

knows the men and women and the
lives they lead. And so we follow
Jake from one drunken adventure to
another; from one amour to the next
(for Jake is a handsome brute who
can get a sweet mama anywhere in
less than five minutes).
But realistically presented love-life
to the tune of jazzed tom-tom music
in wild cabarets and cheap rooming
houses is hardly a sufficient backbone
for a full novel. As a result the
reader wearies somewhat after the
first few cabarets are vividly de
scribed. The loves of Jake are too
much alike to be told one after the
other without becoming boresome.
You can get the piquant flavor of the
book by reading a hundred pages in
the beginning, the middle, or in the
end. To ask more of you would be
imposition.
But Copper Sun is made of much
solider stuff. Countee Cullen stands
well to the front in the first group
of modern poets. He graduated a
Phi Beta Kappa from New York Uni
versity, and later took his Master of
Arts degree at Harvard. His first
book of poetry was Color. This book,
his second, is better than Color.
Countee Cullen has an attitude of
intellectual sophistication that's good
only in small doses. But it is consol
ing to be able to pick up a verse like
the following after some new disap
pointment, to know that others find
nothingness, often, at the end of a
promising trail.
"You were the path I had to take
To find that all
That lay behind its loops and bends
Was a bare blank wall."

knows the men and women and the
lives they lead. And so we follow
Jake from one drunken adventure to
another; from one amour to the next
(for Jake is a handsome brute who
can get a sweet mama anywhere in
less than five minutes).
But realistically presented love-life
to the tune of jazzed tom-tom music
in wild cabarets and cheap rooming
houses is hardly a sufficient backbone
for a full novel. As a result the
reader wearies somewhat after the
first few cabarets are vividly de
scribed. The loves of Jake are too
much alike to be told one after the
other without becoming boresome.
You can get the piquant flavor of the
book by reading a hundred pages in
the beginning, the middle, or in the
end. To ask more of you would be
imposition.
But Copper Sun is made of much
solider stuff. Countee Cullen stands
well to the front in the first group

Phi Beta Kappa from New York Uni
versity, and later took his Master of
Arts degree at Harvard. His first
book of poetry was Color. This book,
his second, is better than Color.
Countee Cullen has an attitude of
intellectual sophistication that's good
only in small doses. But it is consol
ing to be able to pick up a verse like
the following after some new disap
pointment, to know that others find
nothingness, often, at the end of a
promising trail.

Home to Harlem. By Claude McKay.
(New York: Harper and Broth
ers, 1928.)
Copper Sun. By Countee Cullen. (New
York: Harper and Brothers,
1927.)
Here are two books by negroes. One
is a novel, Home to Harlem; the
other is verse. Through them both
there runs that strong negro con
sciousness of oppression and inferi
ority. It is like a hot wind sweeping
across a desert that cannot be evaded
or escaped. It hangs like a leaden
fetter on the minds of contemporary
negro writers.
The sense of inferiority that a white
civilization forces upon the negro is
a deep, bitter venom resting at the
soul's bottom of the educated ones.
Countee Cullen says in a short verse:
"If for a day joy masters me,
Think not my wounds are healed;
Par deeper than the scars you see,
I keep the roots concealed.
They shall bear blossoms with the
fall;
I have their words for this,

Who tend my roots with grains of
gall,
And suns of prejudice."
We find the same spirit in Home to
Harlem. The negro student, Ray,
j dreams of having an equal chance
i with a white as the climax ol a dope
dream. He is bitter. He sees edu
cation as serving to make the negro
even unhappier than he is in igno-
I ranee. He says, "No, modern educa
tion is planned to make you a sharp,
snouty, rooting hog. A negro getting
|it is an anachronism. We ought to
get something new, we negroes. But
we get our education like —like our
houses. When the whites move out,
we move in, and take possession of
the old dead stuff."
But unhappy Ray is not the main
character in Home to Harlem. The
story is of a strapping, handsome buck
negro named Jake. Jake Is a steve
dore. He loves whiskey and soda (he
learned in England not to take his
! whiskey straight). He loves women.
| He loves jazz.
