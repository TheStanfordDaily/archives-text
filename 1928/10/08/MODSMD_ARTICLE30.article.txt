# And Now the Theatre

Most of the ballyhoo which apepars in the Daily in order to drum up
patronage for campus plays is somewhat risky for us to print, because we
do not know whether we are recommending that scats be bought for a
"flop" or for a success.
That is not the case today, however, ladeez and gentulmen. The
Queen's Husband," written by Robert E. Sherwood, editor of Life, has
already been presented tw r ice on the campus and is fully worth the third
presentation. When we saw it, we thought it was the best thing the
Dramatic Council had offered in a long day. It is just the sort of play
which will appeal to students, and indeed it will have to be supported this
time by them alone, because the outside patrons already have seen it.
Hence, heed the ticket sale tomorrow.

Attention of those who have occasion to communicate with the Daily
editorial staff is called to the fact that the editorial telephone number is
Palo Alto 647. The business staff's phone is Palo Alto 1074, which for
merly served both staffs. If you forget the numbers, seek and find them
in the masthead at the top of this column.
