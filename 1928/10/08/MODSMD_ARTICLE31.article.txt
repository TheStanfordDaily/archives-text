# AN ACTOR IS DEAD
## 
### 
George Beban is dead. Badly in
jured when thrown from a horse, he
died in a Los Angeles hospital Friday.
It is -always a particularly sad thing
when a member of that valuable so
cial group which we know as "the
actors" is taken away. There is too
little entertainment in this world, and
George Beban was a real entertainer.
Unlike the famous Mr. Chaney, he as
sumed just one characterization. It
was a good one.. Many will remember
Beban in his humorous, yet intensely
sympathetic portrayal of the Italian
workman. His best-known perform
ance, "The Sign of the Rose," was
unique. Part of it was shown on the
screen, then the screen would be
lifted, and the same characters step
forth on the stage to play their hu
man roles in Beban's soundly senti
mental play. We remember, in par
ticular, a vivid trial scene from one
of his shows.
