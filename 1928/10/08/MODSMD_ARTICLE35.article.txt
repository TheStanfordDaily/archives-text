### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 7.
Three coast conference men-o'-war
were anchored today in the smooth
waters of victory while as many
others reached port badly battered as
the result of the first conference foot
ball engagements of the 1928 season.
The big threats of the North, Uni
versity of Oregon and Oregon State,
struck their colors before tremendous
broadsides. Oregon succumbed to a
powerful Stanford attack, 26-12. Ore
gon State was vanquished by South
ern California's Trojans, 19-0.
Don Williams, great southern Cali
fornia quarterback, led the Trojans to
their decisive win, scoring two touch
downs and a try for point himself.
The burly Oregon State gridders bat
tered in vain at the wall in front of
them while their aerial thrusts fell
either into waiting Trojan arms or in
complete.
Washington State kept its confer
ence record unblemished with a
smashing 26-6 walkaway over Mon
tana's Grizzlies. It was a close battle
for the first half but Washington
State's big eleven gathered momen
tum in the third period to push over
three touchdowns.
The Huskies of the University of
Washington had a tough fight with
Whitman's Missionaries in a non-con
ference affair, winning 7-0. Idaho and
Gonzaga slipped and sloshed over a
muddy field to a 6-6 tie while Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles had
no difficulty in running up a 32-0
score on California Tech.
