HYLAND LOOKS AT "POP"
Much has been said concerning
Stanford's famed * football mentor.
Reams have been written concerning
his cunning, his supreme knowledge
of the game, his personality.
Probably the most sincere compli
ment yet made, however, appears this
month in College Humor. It is the
article "Pop Warner" by Dick Hyland,
scintillating Cardinal halfback, who
has had an opportunity to know the
Old Fox as well as anyone.
Warner the Man
To most Stanford men and women
Warner is simply a figure—a substan
tial, stolid one —seen only at games
and at an occasional football rally.
Hyland's story presents Warner as a
man, an extraordinary one, yet not
perfect.
"Tricky Dick" is a well qualified
narrator in this case. Seldom does a
player ride the ups and downs of the
game as did Hyland in his three years
under Warner. Pop's was the hand
which arbitrarily guided the destinies
of Stanford's sensational half.
Hyland's compliment to his coach
seems sincere because it is not tinc
tured with the hooey usually spread
in such an article. He does not paint
Pop Warner as people like to think
of football mentors —throbbing, emo
tional, swearing, shouting tin gods.
Article Rings True
Hyland's article rings true because
he has an analytical mind. He sees
Warner as the old man really is.
More than once, doubtless, Hyland
was in a position to hate his gridiron
dictator heartily. That he doesn't
makes his compliment a real one.
This analytical mind of Hyland's,
by the way, is what probably kept him
from being the campus idol he might
have been. The name of Tricky Dick
Hyland could have been shaped ad
miringly by every lip, had Hyiai;
wished it. He had all the makings of
a college demigod. But he did not
choose to run.
Dick Hyland
Hyland is the type of man who does
what he pleases and says what he
pleases. Whether or not such a course
is wise for a collegian is a question.
Certainly, Hyland missed a chance
of being a campus hero. Whether he
missed anything of value or not is a
matter of personal opinion.
Anyway, Dick Hyland's article
shows Pop Warner, the man. And it
shows something more —Dick Hyland,
the man.
