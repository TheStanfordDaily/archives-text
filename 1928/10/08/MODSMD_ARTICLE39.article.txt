# DICK WORDEN
## 
### 
Stanford's 1928 football squad has
one player who somehow this season
has stood outside the white glare of
the spotlight.
Against the Army Dick Worden did
tome outstanding work in his end
position. He snagged passes just as
they should be snagged. He looked
plenty nice in grounding his man.
For some reason his playing was
practically unnoticed by the eagle
eyes of San Francisco sports writ
ers. Pop Warner, who knows all,
sees all, is aware of Mr. Worden's
presence, no doubt, but about eighty
per cent of those in the stands ai'e
not.
An apt notation to make next week
on your program card might be
"Watch Worden."
