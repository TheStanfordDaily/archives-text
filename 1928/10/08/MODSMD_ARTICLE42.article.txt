### 
Tryouts for the Stanford Literary
Magazine will start this week and all
persons interested in editorial or
managerial work are requested to call
at the Literary office today after 2:30
o'clock. Excellent opportunities exist
this year with several salaried posi
tions open in both departments.
Tryoutees for the business staff can
specialize in one of three depart
ments : circulating, advertising, or
business and credit. Students who
have had typing experience are espe
cially desired, but others are wel
comed to try out.
In the editorial department posi
tions are open for this year and next.
Those of critical and literary ability
are preferred. Women are cordially
invited to try out for both depart
ments.
At 5 o'clock tonight there will be a
meeting of the editorial and mana
gerial staff including tryoutees and
those who have reported recently.

Henri Cochet, champion tennis
player of the world, spoke to the
U.C.L.A. student body last Friday. As
Cochet does not speak English, one
of the professors acted as interpreter.
