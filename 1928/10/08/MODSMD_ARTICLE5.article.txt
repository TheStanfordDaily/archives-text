# Stanford Downs Bronco Yearlings 42 to 0 Saturday
## 
### 
Playing a brand of football that
would have made even such a taciturn
individual as "Pop" Warner give vent
to frequent and exuberant exclama
tions had he been here, Coach
"Husky" Hunt's freshman football
eleven trounced the Santa Clara year
ling team 42 to 0 in the Stadium yes
terday before a small crowd of some
1500 persons.
Starting with a rush in the very
beginning the Card first-year men
pushed over a touchdown in the first
five minutes of the game and con
tinued to play a calibre of football
that would have done credit to a
varsity eleven until the final gun was
fired. Light and lacking reserves, the
freshmen played the visitors off their
teet in every department of the game
and at no time were in danger of being
scored on.
Grey Kicks Well
An interesting feature of that 42-
point total is that the freshman place
kicker, Grey, left tackle, in every in
stance converted for the extra point,
something that a varsity place-kicker
hasn't done in some time.
The second quarter was the big
Stanford period, three touchdowns
being chalked up to the Cards' credit
to make the score at the half 28 to 0.
A lucky break gave the Card yearlings
their fourth score of the game when
a lateral pass fumbled by a Santa
Clara back was recovered on the
Santa Clara 25-yard line. A perfectly
timed 25-yard pass, Allen to Colvin,
accounted for the touchdown. Another
touchdown in the third quarter and
one in the fourth completed the scor
ing.
Rintala Stars
"Rudy" Rintala, speedy left half
back, was the big ground-gainer of
the day. He is a clever open field run
ner as a freshman and should be even
better next year.
However, the Cardinal freshman
backfield is not a one-man proposition
but a four-man combination with each
member doing his share. "Dusty"
Allen with his splendid defensive
work and accurate passing in the
fullback position, Wilson with his
long spiral punts (one for almost 60
yards) at right halfback, and Marks
with his fine field generalship all had
their parts in the Card victory.
The Stanford line outcharged and
outfought the Santa Clara line, and
played away above anything that had
been expected of it, Colvin, Grey, and
Toepke looking particularly good.
In all fairness to Santa Clara, it is
reported that the freshmen there
scrimmaged three times against the
Bronco varsity during the past week
and as a result were not in first-class
condition for yesterday's game. Spots
wood, Stockton, and Thomas were the
outstanding men on the visiting team.

backfield is not a one-man proposition
but a four-man combination with each
member doing his share. "Dusty"
Allen with his splendid defensive
work and accurate passing in the
fullback position, Wilson with his
long spiral punts (one for almost 60
yards) at right halfback, and Marks
with his fine field generalship all had
their parts in the Card victory.
The Stanford line outcharged and
outfought the Santa Clara line, and
played away above anything that had
been expected of it, Colvin, Grey, and
Toepke looking particularly good.
In all fairness to Santa Clara, it is
reported that the freshmen there
scrimmaged three times against the
Bronco varsity during the past week
and as a result were not in first-class
condition for yesterday's game. Spots
wood, Stockton, and Thomas were the
outstanding men on the visiting team.
Playing a brand of football that
would have made even such a taciturn
individual as "Pop" Warner give vent
to frequent and exuberant exclama
tions had he been here, Coach
"Husky" Hunt's freshman football
eleven trounced the Santa Clara year
ling team 42 to 0 in the Stadium yes
terday before a small crowd of some
1500 persons.
Starting with a rush in the very
beginning the Card first-year men
pushed over a touchdown in the first
five minutes of the game and con
tinued to play a calibre of football
that would have done credit to a
varsity eleven until the final gun was
fired. Light and lacking reserves, the
freshmen played the visitors off their
teet in every department of the game
and at no time were in danger of being
scored on.
Grey Kicks Well
An interesting feature of that 42-
point total is that the freshman place
kicker, Grey, left tackle, in every in
stance converted for the extra point,
something that a varsity place-kicker
hasn't done in some time.
The second quarter was the big
Stanford period, three touchdowns
being chalked up to the Cards' credit
to make the score at the half 28 to 0.
A lucky break gave the Card yearlings
their fourth score of the game when
a lateral pass fumbled by a Santa
Clara back was recovered on the
Santa Clara 25-yard line. A perfectly
timed 25-yard pass, Allen to Colvin,
accounted for the touchdown. Another
touchdown in the third quarter and
one in the fourth completed the scor
ing.
Rintala Stars
"Rudy" Rintala, speedy left half
back, was the big ground-gainer of
the day. He is a clever open field run
ner as a freshman and should be even
better next year.

backfield is not a one-man proposition
but a four-man combination with each
member doing his share. "Dusty"
