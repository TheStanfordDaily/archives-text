# U.S. DEFEATS ARGENTINA IN POLO FINALS
## Brilliant Playing of Hopping Responsible for 13-7 American Victory 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 7. (/P)â€”'The Uni
ted States still rules the polo world.
A patched-up United States "Big
Four" led by Tommy Hitchcock, de
feated Argentina in the third and de
ciding game of the three-game series
for the Championship of the Americas,
the score of 13 to 7 was the most de
cisive of the series. The North Ameri
cans had won the first game 7 to 6,
but Argentina smashed its way to a
10 to 7 victory in the second, evening
the count and making a third game
necessary.
Hopping Put In
Fearing that the United States was
about to lose its grip on world polo
honors, Polo Association officials de
cided that the "Big Four" needed
more youth and powerful hitting and
benched the veteran 10-goal Malcolm
Stevenson for Earle A. Hopping.
And it was largely through Hop
ping's sensational work that the tide
was turned. This 21-year-old son of a
polo father has played the game seri
ously only about two years but he
looked like an old master at the game
yesterday. Playing at the No. 3 posi
tion, strange to him, Hitchcock him
self came out of his slump and played
as brilliantly as he ever has.
Argentina Outclassed
In the shape of their rivals' deadly
and ferocious attack Argentina was
outclassed. The game was decided to
all intents and purposes in the third
chukker when the United States
scored five goals in rapid succession.
After that Hitchcock and his mates
seemed content to hold their own
with the South Americans.
