Gentlemen:
I started smoking on cigarettes, but
after meeting a young lady for whom
men who smoked pipes had a greater
charm, I promptly switched to one.
Then my agony began. I tried one
brand of tobacco after another, al
ways working on the theory that the
more you paid for tobacco, the better
it would be.
I tried imported special mixtures.
I paid as much as fifty cents an ounce.
All to no avail.
Then came the day I tried Edge
worth. It was at a ball game. I had
run short Of the certain brand I was
smoking, and a casual acquaintance
offered me a pipeful from his pouch.
Imagine my delight when after the
first few puffs I did not feel the old
familiar bite. I puffed on, inhaling the
delightful aroma, and oh, boy! It was
sweet right down to the bottom.
Nothing has separated me from my
pipe, or my pipe from Edgeworth,
since then.
Yours very truly,
