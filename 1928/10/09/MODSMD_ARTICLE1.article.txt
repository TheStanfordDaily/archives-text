### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8. (/P)— Her
bert Hoover paused today in the
drafting of his Boston speech to re
ceive word of the political situation
in Ohio and California.
Optimistic reports were brought to
him by party leaders from both
states. Myers N. Cooper of Cincin
nati, Republican candidate for Gov
ernor of Ohio, said after his visit with
the nominee that the business inter
ests of the state were anxious for a
continuance of the prosperity Presi
dent Coolidge had brought to the
country.
J. R. Knowland of Oakland, pub
lisher of the Oakland Tribune, de
clared that the only question about
California and the other Pacific Coast
states was the size of the majority
that the Hoover-Curtis ticket would
roll up.
Cooper was accompanied by Carmi
Thompson, treasurer of the State Re
publican Committee; Orville Smith of
Cleveland and Arthur Fenton, collec
tor of internal revenue.
"Business interests of Ohio recog
nize that Herbert Hoover has been
a vital factor in developing this con
structive program," Cooper said in
discussing conditions in that state.
"They see in the election of Herbert
Hoover a continuation of the pros
perity throughout the country. As !
Secretary of the great Department of j
Commerce they feel that he has been !
in training for the great responsibili
ties as President.
Farm Stand Approved
"Agriculture, the Republican party
recognizes, has a problem and the
party is pledged to constructively
meet its situation, placing the busi
ness of the farmers on equality with
the business of other industries. The
farmers of Ohio have full confidence
in the sincerity and capacity of Her
bert Hoover to give such direction as
to fulfill the pledge of our party."
During the day the nominee also
was visited by a delegation of editors
of Polish language newspapers from
Milwaukee, Chicago, Toledo, Cleve
land, Detroit, and Buffalo. A. E.
Ruszkiewicz, leader of the group, said
that there had been a great swing to
Hoover during the past two weeks
and asserted that the prohibition ques
tion was disappearing as an issue
among the Poles.
Poles Seen For Hoover
»The Poles are realizing that the
President cannot personally change
the law," he said, adding that the ma
jority of the members of his race were
for the Republican candidate because
of his war record.
Hoover favors the dedication of
Muscle Shoals to agriculture for re
search purposes and development of
fertilizers in addition to its national
defense reserves, he said tonight in
a formal statement issued at his head
quarters.
"After these purposes are satisfied
there is a by-product of superfluous
power," the statement said. "That by
product should be disposed of on
such terms and conditions as will
