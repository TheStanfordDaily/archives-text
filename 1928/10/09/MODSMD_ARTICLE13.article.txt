# BABES WORK OUT NEW PLAYS FOR PASADENA GAME
## 
### 
Apparently unaffected by the 12 to
0 trouncing they administered to the
Santa Clara freshmen last Saturday,
all members of the Stanford yearling
squad reported for practice yesterday
and worked with unusual energy for
more than two hours, running off
plays and practicing blocking and
tackling under the tutelage of
Coaches "Husky" Hunt and "Rabbit"
Bradshaw.
Not a trace of ego was in evidence,
and the 1932 men were all working as
hard, if not harder, for the game with
the Pasadena Junior College next Sat
urday as they did for the Santa Clara
contest. Coach Hunt commended this
attitude on the part of the freshmen.
Hard Game
A tough game is anticipated with
the Southern California team and
Hunt is squad in several
new plays. Considerable time will be
spent again this week working on an
aerial offensive. Though no count wass
kept, the Card freshmen completed
close to 80 per cent of all passes
tried against Santa Clara. Of those
completed several were for gains of
25 yards or better. Most of the pass
ing was done by Allen and Rintala
with the ends and backs receiving.
Linemen Drilled
Hunt spent some time yesterday
working on the linemen in an en
deavor to break them of the habit of
looking back when pulled out of the
line for interference. He expressed
satisfaction regarding their playing
Saturday but said they weren't charg
ing fast enough in some instances.
The backfield is being coached on
blocking and in preparing a tighter
defense against the passing attack of
the Pasadena Junior College.
No injuries were reported from the
Santa Clara game by the freshmen
with the exception of "Dusty" Allen,
fullback, who has a slightly sprained
hand.
