Tibbett American Artist
Lawrence Tibbett, who sings on the
campus October 28, is well-known as
a distinctively American artist', and
California people take special pride
in Tibbett as he was born in Bakers
field and educated in Los Angeles. He
has never studied in Europe so his
art is native to the United States.
After a varied career on the stage
under Tyrone Power, and service in
the Navy during the War, came Tib
bett's journey to New York where he
hoped to enter the concert stage. Six
months after his arrival he had a con
tract to sing at the Metropolitan
Opera House which is the goal of
every distinguished singer in this
countir.
Early Success
Tibbett's sensational success came
early in his second season and it was
featured in headlines on the front
pages of the New York newspapers
of the day. In the three seasons since,
he has duplicated his triumphs in
operas, which include Giordano's
"Cena Delia Beffe," based on the
tragedy of the "Jest," an dthe "King's
Henchmen" by the American com
poser, Deems Taylor, for which the
American poet, Edna St. Vincent Mil
lay, wrote the libretto.
