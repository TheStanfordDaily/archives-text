# TWO CARDINALS INJURED DURING SATURDAY TILT
## Wilton Must Stop Practice Two Weeks For Knee To Heal; Harder Also Out 
### 
Injuries again haunt the Stanford
football team. This time it is Frank
Wilton, Tlashy halfback, and Spud
Harder, star end, who have been com
pelled to join the disabled list as a
result of leg injuries received in Sat
urday's encounter with the giant Ore
gon University eleven at Eugene.
Walt Heinecke and several others are
nursing cuts and bruises that give
mute evidence that the Cards went
through a real tough battle to beat
McEwan's team.
Of all the injuries, Wilton's is de
clared to be the most serious. After
examining Frank's knee yesterday,
Doctor Roth declared that his patient
will have to be at absolute rest for
at least two weeks in order that the
knee might heal sufficiently. l This
means that Wilton will be out of the
lineup when the Cards meet U.C.L.A.
here next Saturday, and Idaho on the
following Friday in San Francisco.
Chances are that Pop Warner will
save him entirely until the U.S.C.
game in Los Angeles on November 3
when his services will be needed most
ii> the Redshlrt backfteld.
Spud Harder is expected to recover
sufficiently for action next Saturday.
He is suffering with a strained liga
ment.
Ernie Nevers, the big blonde full
back and captain of the 1926 Cardinal
machine, made his first regular ap
pearance as a member of the Warner
coaching staff at yesterday's practice
session. Until last week, when the
Pacific Coast circuit disbanded for
the season, Nevers was pitching for
the Missions.
