# It Was Bound To Come

Something was lacking in the editorial column last week; no mention
whatever was made of football, nor was any exhortation put forth to
the end of encouraging a 100 per cent knowledge upon the part of stu
dents of the songs and yells. Since a good team and undying support for
it are essential for making fall quarter the pleasant period it is, we shall
hasten now to discuss these vital topics and to elevate them to a place of
consideration to which only a Daily editorial could elevate them.
About that varsity. It is now an offensive machine of proved power,
and there is no reason, except the possibility of crippling injuries occur
ring, which will prevent its accomplishing all that Pop Warner has said
it may. Statistics of the Oregon game showed that the Webfeet carried
the ball forty-five times, and advanced it a total of 35 yards in those
attempts. The Oregonians lost, on the other hand, 33 yards in scrim
mage, with the result that their net gain was 2 yards. That, we submit,
is eloquent tribute to the work of Messrs. Robesky, Post, Sellman, Art
man, Ileinecke, Worden, Harder, et. al.
Now, these freshmen of Stanford's are playing excellent ofotball at
the moment. In three games they have scored 89 points to their oppo
nents' 6. They started the season with a turnout for the squad of only
65 men, where as the usual turnout for frosh football is about 110 men.
Coaches blamed the decrease onto the cut in the freshman class made this
year, but if the cut was responsible for the decrease, how does it happen
that the men who did get in are so good ?
Where Stanford will be found weakest this year will not be, we think,
on the field at all, but in the stands. It is our singing of the old favorites
which sounds miserable when compared to singing by, say, California.
The hymn, "Come, Join the Band," "The Cardinal Is Waving," ami
"Hail, Stanford, Hail" are all excellent songs and could be thrilling if
they were properly sung at the game. Yet little attention is ordinarily
paid to the necessity of teaching the rooters how to sing. The Daily
hopes Scott Webster will attempt to improve our vocal effects.
And now that the first football editorial has been written and Biff
Hoffman's nose has been well skinned, the conference season may settle
back and consider itself opened.

it are essential for making fall quarter the pleasant period it is, we shall
hasten now to discuss these vital topics and to elevate them to a place of
consideration to which only a Daily editorial could elevate them.
About that varsity. It is now an offensive machine of proved power,
and there is no reason, except the possibility of crippling injuries occur
ring, which will prevent its accomplishing all that Pop Warner has said
it may. Statistics of the Oregon game showed that the Webfeet carried
the ball forty-five times, and advanced it a total of 35 yards in those
attempts. The Oregonians lost, on the other hand, 33 yards in scrim
mage, with the result that their net gain was 2 yards. That, we submit,
is eloquent tribute to the work of Messrs. Robesky, Post, Sellman, Art
man, Ileinecke, Worden, Harder, et. al.
Now, these freshmen of Stanford's are playing excellent ofotball at
the moment. In three games they have scored 89 points to their oppo
nents' 6. They started the season with a turnout for the squad of only
65 men, where as the usual turnout for frosh football is about 110 men.
Coaches blamed the decrease onto the cut in the freshman class made this
year, but if the cut was responsible for the decrease, how does it happen
that the men who did get in are so good ?
Where Stanford will be found weakest this year will not be, we think,
on the field at all, but in the stands. It is our singing of the old favorites
which sounds miserable when compared to singing by, say, California.
The hymn, "Come, Join the Band," "The Cardinal Is Waving," ami
"Hail, Stanford, Hail" are all excellent songs and could be thrilling if
they were properly sung at the game. Yet little attention is ordinarily
paid to the necessity of teaching the rooters how to sing. The Daily
hopes Scott Webster will attempt to improve our vocal effects.
And now that the first football editorial has been written and Biff
Hoffman's nose has been well skinned, the conference season may settle
back and consider itself opened.
Something was lacking in the editorial column last week; no mention
whatever was made of football, nor was any exhortation put forth to
the end of encouraging a 100 per cent knowledge upon the part of stu
dents of the songs and yells. Since a good team and undying support for
it are essential for making fall quarter the pleasant period it is, we shall
hasten now to discuss these vital topics and to elevate them to a place of
consideration to which only a Daily editorial could elevate them.
