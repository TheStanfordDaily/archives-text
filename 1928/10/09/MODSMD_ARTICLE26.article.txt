# A 						Musical Bargain

Lawrence Tibbett, baritone, who is to sing here October 27 in the
opening A.S.S.U. concert, is, if one would believe Sidney Madden, man
ager of the concert series and custodian of the publicity, a most interest
ing person. lie was born in Bakersfield, the last place where anyone
would expect a singer to come from, was the son of the Kern county
sheriff, is known to Don Robesky, Spud Harder and the rest of the
Bakersfield boys, went to Manual Arts high school in Los Angeles, re
ceived the greatest acclaim ever accorded an American singer on the
Metropolitan Opera House stage in New York, has never been to Europe,
and is well worth seventy cents, the price of hearing him in the Pavilion.
More than one-half the seats to the Pavilion have been sold, and the
rest will be quickly got rid of if the living group canvass which starts
today is successful. A season ticket costs $3.50 for students, whereas
seats to the several concerts cost $2.50, $2.00 and $1.50. There is but
one economical thing to do; let everyone do it.
Sousa's Band, Margaret Matzenauer, Efram Zimbalist and the San
Francisco Symphony orchestra are the other events and artists of the
series.
The editorial staff of the Daily will meet today at 1 o'clock. Members
who are not present will be liable to demotion.
