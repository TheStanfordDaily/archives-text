"Good News"—Curran.
College through very rosy glasses.
Collegiate capers set to ultra-snappy mu
sic. This is the musical comedy that is
simultaneously the hit of San Francisco,
New York, and London.
The pieces have been played for the
last eight months by dance orchestras,
but they sound new and provoking when
heard with the proper ensemble. "Lucky
in Love" is the romantic hit, and Mar
garet Breen, the leading lady, puts the
proper pathos into it when she sings it.
There are a lot of other good songs,
too. This is the show that originated
the Varsity Drag, and Marjorie Kane
becomes breathless in her attempts to
satisfy the audience's demand for en
cores when she dances and interprets
this jazz step. Miss Kane also sings the
catchy song from which the play is
named—"Good News."
As you would expect of a good rahrah
musical comedy, the hero is the captain
of the football team and is so popular

with the co-eds that they sing a spccial
song whenever he appears — "He's a
Ladies Man." Lester Cole is the campus
idol and causes what plot there is. The
emotional crisis is reached when he passes
a serious scholastic hurdle and is allowed
to play in the big game for dear old
Tait.
"The Best Things in Life Are Free" is
one of the predominating and most beau
tiful songs. "Just Imagine" is pretty,
and "Happy Days" gives the men stu
dents a chance to become reminiscent in
the ever-popular student prince fashion.
Eddie Nelson is the star comedian, and
Peggy Hope is a tiny girl with ambitious
ways. She takes "raw material men,"
polishes them up, and puts them back
into circulation when they have learned
about women from her.
Max Fisher's Californians orchestrates
down in the pit part of the time, doubling
as the college band in the critical mo
ments. Very good jazz, too.
