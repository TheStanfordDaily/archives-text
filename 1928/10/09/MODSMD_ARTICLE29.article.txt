October 7th.
What with teas, receptions, tieups, and
assemblies, have been much too busy to
write in my diary. Do resolve firmly to
spend next week in a quiet fashion, but,
lord! do not suppose I shall do so un
less everyone else does so also, for do
find already it is most depressing not to
go to the places where everyone goes,
and although I have heard that Stanford
was a school of individualities, have al
ready concluded that individuals must
lose some of their remoteness when there
are so many of them together.
* * *
Was much thrilled and excited over
the ticup last week, albeit it just shows
what a freshman can do if you give him
enough rope, but am afraid it is the sort
of game that one must play oneself to
really appreciate. To the assembly Fri
day morning, where was much depressed
to hear suspicions that the honor system
is not all it might be, but did content
myself with thinking that whereas there
are always some people that will break
rules, these same people are also the kind
that boast of such infringements. And
next to a man that does wear a cap, I
do most heartily despise the type that
brags of what he has got away with.
Am curious whether this honor system
is a code or a creed, for it be the for
mer, it is easier to adapt to one's own
standards, and if it be the latter, it is
almost like religion, where many differ
ent interpretations are allowed.
* * *
Have met many fine young men at
both the President's home and at the
Roble informal, but find much difficulty
in remembering their names, whereupon
have determined to remember them by
their geographic locations. Albeit so
many hail from the South, shall proba
bly have to devise other subdivisions,
which will probably be by the types of
cars they drive.
* ♦ *
To the game at California Saturday,
with a young beau, and we did run up
a steep hill to the stadium for no good
reason, but that everyone about was run
ning and so did feel competitive, and
arrived at the stadium in a discouraged
and agitated state. Am glad that Stan
ford does not play St. Mary's this year,
for I do not like the color of their uni
forms. Also did cogitate that there
should be a handicap on football players
with extraordinary large feet, for there
is less room to cover on the field, and
suppose that such pedal extremities
would be a help in jumping also.
* * *
Did walk down the streets of Palo
Alto this morning and was astounded by
the many groups of men listening to
what appeared to be excited speeches of
a Fascisti movement, but was told that
they were listening to the World's Series,
whereupon was much relieved, for Ludi 1
the men were so excited that I feared a
lynching was imminent. Do wonder if
the sale of Biff Hoffman's victrola rec
ords has gone down at Eugene.

Did walk down the streets of Palo
Alto this morning and was astounded by
the many groups of men listening to
what appeared to be excited speeches of
a Fascisti movement, but was told that
they were listening to the World's Series,
whereupon was much relieved, for Ludi 1
the men were so excited that I feared a
lynching was imminent. Do wonder if
the sale of Biff Hoffman's victrola rec
ords has gone down at Eugene.
October 7th.
What with teas, receptions, tieups, and
assemblies, have been much too busy to
write in my diary. Do resolve firmly to
spend next week in a quiet fashion, but,
lord! do not suppose I shall do so un
less everyone else does so also, for do
find already it is most depressing not to
go to the places where everyone goes,
and although I have heard that Stanford
was a school of individualities, have al
ready concluded that individuals must
lose some of their remoteness when there
are so many of them together.
* * *
Was much thrilled and excited over
the ticup last week, albeit it just shows
what a freshman can do if you give him
enough rope, but am afraid it is the sort
of game that one must play oneself to
really appreciate. To the assembly Fri
day morning, where was much depressed
to hear suspicions that the honor system
is not all it might be, but did content
myself with thinking that whereas there
are always some people that will break
rules, these same people are also the kind
that boast of such infringements. And
next to a man that does wear a cap, I
do most heartily despise the type that
brags of what he has got away with.
Am curious whether this honor system
is a code or a creed, for it be the for
mer, it is easier to adapt to one's own
standards, and if it be the latter, it is
almost like religion, where many differ
ent interpretations are allowed.

Have met many fine young men at
both the President's home and at the
Roble informal, but find much difficulty
in remembering their names, whereupon
have determined to remember them by
their geographic locations. Albeit so
many hail from the South, shall proba
bly have to devise other subdivisions,
which will probably be by the types of
cars they drive.

To the game at California Saturday,
with a young beau, and we did run up
a steep hill to the stadium for no good
reason, but that everyone about was run
ning and so did feel competitive, and
arrived at the stadium in a discouraged
and agitated state. Am glad that Stan
ford does not play St. Mary's this year,
for I do not like the color of their uni
forms. Also did cogitate that there
should be a handicap on football players
with extraordinary large feet, for there
is less room to cover on the field, and
suppose that such pedal extremities
would be a help in jumping also.
