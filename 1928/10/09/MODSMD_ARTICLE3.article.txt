# 1932 SWIMMING PRACTICE DRAWS PROMINENT MEN
## 
### 
Several well-known aquatic stars
were among the fifteen freshmen who
reported to Coach Ted Smith yester
day afternoon for 1932 swimming and
water polo. Austin Clapp, who won
fourth place for the United States in
the 1500-meter free style in the re
cent Olympic Games, will probably
be a sure point-winner for the Card
babes. Frank Booth, a prominent
member of the Hollywood Athletic
Club team, will also represent the
freshmen this year.
Prospects are good for a well-bal
anced team, Smith reports. For the
present the team will lack a diver,
but this will probably be remedied
next quarter when Tommy Franken
burg, who also represented the United
States at Amsterdam, is expected to
register. Frankenburg was a member
of the diving team.
The water polo situation is practi
cally unknown as yet, Smith said.
