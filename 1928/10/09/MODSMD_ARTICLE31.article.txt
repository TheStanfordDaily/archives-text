The boys of Donora, Pa., are equipped
by the town council with baseballs and
bats to keep them off the streets, we
are informed by a -vital item in the
Stanford Daily.
Now if they only had a few billiard
cues—
Headline in the Cornell Daily Sun:
ZORN TESTIFIES
IN SEWER PROBE
Sewer probe ? Gracious !
Euphronia thinks a Columbarium is a
government building.
A young college student named Cotton
Whose entrance O.K. was ill-gotten
Took flunk after flunk
They said: Pack up your trunk,
We know you are "mentally rotten!"
Disagreeing with the editorial columns
of the Daily wc favor "The Mikado"
for the proposed Gilbert-Sullivan revival.
It offers such an excellent chance to
disguise the chorus.
That reminds us. We saw a Fanchon
and Marco "Idea" a few weeks ago.
Really, the girls were quite active for
their age.
Names of 53 faculty members and ad
ministrators of the University of South
ern California appear in the new edition
of Who's Who.
As Kayo Mullins said: "Who's Zoo?
(Don't take offense, hoys, when we
see an item like that the devil tempts us.)
Headline in the Daily—
HOOVER SILENT
AFTER SEEING
COOLIDGE
No wonder.
This here is quite a campaign. Smith
loses the conservative vote because he
wears striped shirts. Hoover drops the
liberal vote because he wears button
shoes—that is, he looks like the kind of
man who zvould wear button shoes. On
the other hand, Curtis is conceded the
Indian vote for ancestral reasons. In
view of the Noble Redman's support of
the G.O.P. ticket what a scandal there
would be, Pro P>ono Publico suggests, if
it could be proven that Hoover scalped
Big Game tickets!
(My what a long time it took to say
that!)
We will close with the sad case of the
frosh who thought that mixing gasoline
and alcohol was a "noble experiment."
(EDITOR'S NOTE: He, too, was
"mentally rotten.")

We will close with the sad case of the
frosh who thought that mixing gasoline
and alcohol was a "noble experiment."
(EDITOR'S NOTE: He, too, was
"mentally rotten.")
The boys of Donora, Pa., are equipped
by the town council with baseballs and
bats to keep them off the streets, we
are informed by a -vital item in the
Stanford Daily.
Now if they only had a few billiard
cues—
Headline in the Cornell Daily Sun:
ZORN TESTIFIES
IN SEWER PROBE
Sewer probe ? Gracious !
Euphronia thinks a Columbarium is a
government building.
A young college student named Cotton
Whose entrance O.K. was ill-gotten
Took flunk after flunk
They said: Pack up your trunk,
We know you are "mentally rotten!"
Disagreeing with the editorial columns
of the Daily wc favor "The Mikado"
for the proposed Gilbert-Sullivan revival.
It offers such an excellent chance to
disguise the chorus.
That reminds us. We saw a Fanchon
and Marco "Idea" a few weeks ago.
Really, the girls were quite active for
their age.
Names of 53 faculty members and ad
ministrators of the University of South
ern California appear in the new edition
of Who's Who.

(Don't take offense, hoys, when we

Headline in the Daily—

AFTER SEEING
COOLIDGE
No wonder.
This here is quite a campaign. Smith
loses the conservative vote because he
wears striped shirts. Hoover drops the
liberal vote because he wears button
shoes—that is, he looks like the kind of
man who zvould wear button shoes. On
the other hand, Curtis is conceded the
Indian vote for ancestral reasons. In
view of the Noble Redman's support of
the G.O.P. ticket what a scandal there
would be, Pro P>ono Publico suggests, if
it could be proven that Hoover scalped
Big Game tickets!
(My what a long time it took to say
that!)
