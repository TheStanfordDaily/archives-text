# IRREGULAR PRICES RESULT OF HEAVY SALES IN MARKET
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 8. (Jp) â€”Heavy
selling of speculative issues, particu
larly in the motor group, turned the
course of prices irregular today after
an opening outburst of strength had
carried more than a score issues to
new high records. Extreme gains of
3 to nearly 15 points in several of the
high priced specialties were cut down
and a long list of issues closed 2 to 5
points lower, with a few showing even
sharper declines.
Call money held steady at 6% per
cent all day, although loans in the
"outside market" were reported as
low as 6. Time money and commer
cial paper rates held firm. The bullish
effect of 6% per cent call money after
a ruling rate of more than 7 per cent
last month was offset by the an
nouncement that the new short term
U.S. Treasury financing had been ar
ranged at 4% per cent, the highest in
seven years.
