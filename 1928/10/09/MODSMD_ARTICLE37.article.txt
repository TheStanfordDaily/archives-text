# NEW BASKETBALL RULES PREVENT DRIBBLE CHARGE
## Guarding From Rear Is Foul; Free Player Can Hold Ball Indefinitely 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 8.
not going so far as to restrict the
dribble to a single bounce, an action
which was taken last year and then
rescinded after a storm of contro
versy, the new basketball rules an
nounced today for 1928-29 have con-
Hiderable to say about regulating this
spectacular feature of the game.
A new clause is added (Rule 15,
Section 9, under the head of Personal
Fouls) which reads:
"A player shall not hold, trip,
charge, or push an opponent whether
or not either player has possession
ol the ball. If a dribbler charges into
an opponent, or makes personal con
tact with an opponent, without an
apparent effort to avoid such contact,
a personal foul shall be called on the
dribbler.
Dribbler Is Responsible
"If, despite the dribbler's effort to
avoid contact, personal contact en
sues, either player, or both, may be
feuilty; but the greater responsibility
is on the dribbler if he tries to dribble
by an opponent who is in his path."
This is designed to "emphasize the
responsibility of the dribbler in con
nection with the fouls resulting from
the dribble," says Oswald Tower,
Andover, Mass., official interpreter of
the rules.
"Most of those who advocate re
striction of the dribble," he com
ments, "think that the dribble is used
too much or that it is impossible to
check catisfactorily the many fouls
resulting from its use. The former is
a matter of coaching; the latter is a
problem for the rules and officials to
solve.
To Use Passes
"If the dribbler's path is blocked,
he is expected to pass or shoot, that
is, he ought not to try to dribble by
an opponent unless there is a reason
able chance of getting by without
contact. More attention than hitherto
is to be directed to the dribbler's re
sponsibility."
Among other changes are provi
sions designed to penalize "guarding
from the rear" by a personal foul,
making it illegal for a player to capi
talize his great height by tapping the
ball and then catching it on two suc
cessive jump balls, and stating that
"an unguarded player may hold the
ball indefinitely in the court, but as
soon as an opponent takes a position
close by (say within a yard of) the
player with the ball, the latter must
get the ball into play."
The new code also makes it clear
that a ball striking an official does
not become a dead ball.
