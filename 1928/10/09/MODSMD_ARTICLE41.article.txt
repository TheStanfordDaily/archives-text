# PLAN PERMANENT STANFORD BOWL ROOTING SECTION
## 
### 
Plans for the creation of a permanent
rooting section in the Stanford Stadium
were formulated at a meeting of the
Rally Committee last night. James Sa
pero has been placed at the head of the
committee to develop the project.
A permanent section extending from
one 40-yard line to the other will be
marked off for the exclusive use of stu
dent rooters. Admission to this reserved
section will be granted only when the
student appears wearing the regulation
rooter's garb: a white shirt and a root
er's cap.
At the same time, a huge "S" will be
blocked out and directions for forming
this stunt with either cards or two color,
reversible caps will be painted beside
each student.
"These improvements will always in
sure us neat, organized cheering," de
clared Rally Committee Chairman David
Jacobson, "and the permanent marking
of a block "S" will place a ready, ef
fective stunt in the hands of the yell
leaders. The reserved rooting section
will be used at non-conference and pre
season games as well as in conference
contests."
The committee defeated a motion to
present bleacher stunts at the Idaho
game. Stunts will be given at the U.S.C.,
Washington, and California games.
George Ellsworth was appointed chair
man of a committee to compile a record
of all rooters' stunts presented by this
university.
