## Banquet Planned For Next Fortnight; Officers To Be Elected 
### 
Stanford's Smith-for-President Club
will hold Its first meeting tonight at
7:15 o'clock in Room 210 of the Eng
lish Building, announces George Bodle,
chairman of the committee on pre

ested in supporting Smith for the
presidency, are invited to attend.
Permanent officers of the group will
be elected at this meeting, committees

the next fortnight will be announced,
and pamphlets and badges will be dis
tributed.
"The Stanford-for-Smith Club is not
formed in opposition to the support
of Hoover by the University, its fac
ulty, or students," said Bodle. "We
feel that it is not only the right but
the duty of every Hoover supporter
to work for him. We are in favor of
Smith's election because we feel that
it means the establishment of a lib
eral, constructive administration in
international and national affairs.
Merit Criterion
"In our opinion the merit and logic
of the issues of the two parties in
this campaign, not college sentiment,
should form the basis for a Stanford
man's decision."
The objects of the Stanford Demo
cratic Club are to secure a frank dis
cussion of the candidates and issues,
and to assist in getting the Smith
vote out in the election on November
6. Fred Weller, who is working for
the Speakers Division of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, Hugo
Wall, and Joe Wilson make up the

tion of which Bodle is chairman. This
