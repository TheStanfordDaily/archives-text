JUNCTION CITY, 0., Oct. 8. (/P)—
While men toiled to bring out the
charred remains of victims, two in

the cause of the fire which is believed
to have caused the death of seventeen
to twenty convicts when it destroyed
the wooden dormitory of the State
brick plant here early today.
State Welfare Director John E.
Harper launched an investigation im
mediately upon his arrival from
Columbus and Governor Donahey or
dered H. C. Sisson, his personal in
vestigator, to the brick plant today
to conduct an inquiry.
Twenty convicts were said by
prison officials to be missing. Twelve
others, seriously burned or injured,
were taken to the penitentiary hos
pital at Columbus.
Officials said they believed three
of the twenty missing men had seized

guards during the confusion, but
others, including convicts, declare
none escaped.
Fifteen charred bodies, part of them
only small piles of bones, had been
recovered from the ruins late today.
Few or none were possible of identi
fication.
The fire started in the commissary
room where linen supplies were
stored, and is believed to have been
caused by defective electric wiling.
Stories of guards and convicts in

of those who were killed were tram
pled by their terrified fellow prisoners
