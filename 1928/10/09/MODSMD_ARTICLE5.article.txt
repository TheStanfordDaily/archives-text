# 'The Queen's Husbandâ€™ Seat Sale Will Begin At One O'Clock Today
## Harold Helvenston's Stage Sets Attract Eastern, Local Attention 
### 
Seats for "The Queen's Husband*"
the first play of the quarter, go on
sale today at 1 o'clock in front of
the Women's Clubhouse at seventy
five cents and one dollar.
Sherwood's sparkling satire is ex
pected to be presented in a very fin
ished fashion since this is the third
time it has been produced on the
campus stage.
The appearance of Gordon Davis,
playing the title role, will be gladly
welcomed by those students who were
not here summer quarter, and a great
deal of interest will be centered on
the set designed by Harold Helven
ston, who is taking Leslie Kiler's old
position as Art Director.
Mr. Helvenston's work was very
much appreciated this summer and he
has attracted a great deal of atten
tion toward Stanford dramatic pro
ductions from eastern stage set de
signers.
Rehearsals are being held every
night this week and the members of
the cast who are new since this sum
mer are quickly moulding into their
characterizations. Virginia Volland,
who is playing the Queen, is making a
distinct advance in her dramatic
career on the campus.
Helen Ward, who played the lead
in last spring's junior opera, will have
an opportunity to show her versatility.
Her role ass the Princess calls for
more of an emotional performance
than in musical comedy.
There will be a one o'clock cast
dance after the performance Friday
night.
