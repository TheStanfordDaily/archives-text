# NEW MACHINE INVENTED TO PREVENT TRAIN ACCIDENTS FROM BROKEN RAILS
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 7. (/P)— Adoption
of an electrical machine designed to
sweep from the tracks of American
railways the broken rail source of ac
cidents, was announced today by the
American Railway Association.
The association described it as "one
of the most important safety moves
in years, which will add a new factor
of security to the work already done
in decreasing the number of broken
rails."
The trouble aimed at is "rail can
cer," the cracks known as transverse
fissures, jvliich are invisible, because
they staTt inside the rail and show
no warning sign until the rail breaks.
The machine adopted to catch this
invisible menace proceeds along the
rails at seven miles an hour, methodi
cally squirting a daub of white paint
on any spot where one of these hid
den cancers exists. It starts within a
week on a demonstration tour of the
principal American railways, giving
each line about a week.
For seventeen years American rail
ways have had the rail cancer under
laboratory research and it has been
one of the toughest puzzles to solve
in wreck prevention. W. P. Borland,
director of the bureau of safety of
the Interstate Commerce Commission,
recently called it "a prominent cause
of bad wrecks." The break is due to
"fatigue" within the rail. It grows
gradually in new rails as well as old.
The fissure detector is housed in
what resembles a covered handcar,
which is towed over the rails under
inspection. It was invented by Elmer
A. Sperry, the New York scientist
who perfected the gyroscopic com
pass. It runs an electric current
through the rails directly beneath the
car. The hidden breaks which this
current will meet, if they exist, are
described by the American Railway
Engineering Association as less than
a molecule in thickness. That is, even
with the crack on the outside, it would

not be visible through an ordinary
microscope. Nevertheless this tiniest
of cracks disturbs the electric current,
the disturbance being described by
Sperry, who says:
"Figuratively speaking, the current
in the rail, coming to a fissure, ex
claims: 4 My, what a chasm. I can
never cross it. I have to go around it."
The electrical disturbance produced
by "going around" the fissure is
about the smallest thing imaginable,
but its faint trace is picked up by
brushes above the rail, which are part
of the detecting device, through
vacuum tubes the faint impulse which
the brushes pick up is magnified 6000
times, which makes it powerful
enough to squirt the paint. A paint
nozzle is fixed near the brushes so
that its white shot hits the side of
the rail just where the cancer lies.
The magnified current also records
automatically with pen and ink on a
chart which is a permanent map of
the rail conditions.

gradually in new rails as well as old.
The fissure detector is housed in
what resembles a covered handcar,
which is towed over the rails under
inspection. It was invented by Elmer
A. Sperry, the New York scientist
who perfected the gyroscopic com
pass. It runs an electric current
through the rails directly beneath the
car. The hidden breaks which this
current will meet, if they exist, are
described by the American Railway
Engineering Association as less than
a molecule in thickness. That is, even
with the crack on the outside, it would

not be visible through an ordinary
microscope. Nevertheless this tiniest
of cracks disturbs the electric current,
the disturbance being described by
Sperry, who says:
"Figuratively speaking, the current
in the rail, coming to a fissure, ex
claims: 4 My, what a chasm. I can
never cross it. I have to go around it."
The electrical disturbance produced
by "going around" the fissure is
about the smallest thing imaginable,
but its faint trace is picked up by
brushes above the rail, which are part
of the detecting device, through
vacuum tubes the faint impulse which
the brushes pick up is magnified 6000
times, which makes it powerful
enough to squirt the paint. A paint
nozzle is fixed near the brushes so
that its white shot hits the side of
the rail just where the cancer lies.
The magnified current also records
automatically with pen and ink on a
chart which is a permanent map of
the rail conditions.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7. (/P)— Adoption
of an electrical machine designed to
sweep from the tracks of American
railways the broken rail source of ac
cidents, was announced today by the
American Railway Association.
The association described it as "one
of the most important safety moves
in years, which will add a new factor
of security to the work already done
in decreasing the number of broken
rails."
The trouble aimed at is "rail can
cer," the cracks known as transverse
fissures, jvliich are invisible, because
they staTt inside the rail and show
no warning sign until the rail breaks.
The machine adopted to catch this
invisible menace proceeds along the
rails at seven miles an hour, methodi
cally squirting a daub of white paint
on any spot where one of these hid
den cancers exists. It starts within a
week on a demonstration tour of the
principal American railways, giving
each line about a week.
For seventeen years American rail
ways have had the rail cancer under
laboratory research and it has been
one of the toughest puzzles to solve
in wreck prevention. W. P. Borland,
director of the bureau of safety of
the Interstate Commerce Commission,
recently called it "a prominent cause
of bad wrecks." The break is due to
"fatigue" within the rail. It grows
gradually in new rails as well as old.
