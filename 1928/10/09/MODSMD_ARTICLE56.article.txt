# DR. BAILEY TELLS OF EUROPEAN TOUR
## English Professor Gives Continental Ideas of America—Says That German People Are Most Civil 
### JOHN ROGERS 
"No European nation that I visited
likes the United States," Dr. Margery
Bailey, assistant professor of English,
who recently returned from a nine
months' trip abroad, said in an inter
view yesterday, "except Germany.
Certainly, the people of that country
are the most civil; they do not growl
all the time about the war, and they
do not blame us, but themselves, for
the reparations that they must pay.
Italy is furious because we do not
give her credit for having won the
war. France is mad because our sol
diers walked all over her vineyards,
and England, while civil on the sur
face, constantly pokes sly jabs at us
in the newspapers."
Long Itinerary
Miss Bailey toured Germany, Italy,
France, and England, and while in
London took the opportunity to do re
search work on James Boswell's novel,
"Dorando," a story of the Douglas
Cause, which at the time caused quite
a political stir. The Scottish news
papers, because of favorable criti
cisms that Miss Bailey strongly sus
pects Boswell wrote himself, became
involved with the courts and were
prosecuted, with the result that the
question of the liberty of the press
was raised. Ultimately, the papers
were merely rebuked for their con
duct; but the book that Boswell wrote
anonymously did a great deal toward
strengthening the freedom that the
press enjoys today.
Germany Advanced
Continuing her remarks about Eu
rope, Miss Bailey said: "Germany is
the most advanced of the countries
and is ahead of us in the modern
movements of architecture and deco
ration, although there still are many
anachronisms between the medieval
and the twentieth century in the large

cities. Italy is filthy, and gives the
impression of having forgotten all the
uplift of the Renaissance. French
civilization appears to be just a
veneer —Montmarte is just a stupid
sham for tourists. The English coun
try is as romantic as the books say
it is, but London is terribly dirty."
Stanford Colony
Miss Bailey said that there is a
little Stanford colony in Paris, and
Sedley Peck, an alumnus, the
leading article of "A Week in Paris,"
a booklet telling travelers how to
spend the time. While she was there,
an alumnae of the University, Mrs.
Russell, exhibited in the Salon, being
the second Stanford graduate to do
so.
She went on to say that the Ameri
can tourist in Europe constantly
meets four major topics of conversa
tion —Prohibition, the Negro Problem,
the Awful American Extravagance,
and the Downtrodden American Hus
band. "There is a legend about this
husband: Europeans think that he
works hard all day at the office and
then goes home at night to cook din
ner and wash dishes, while his wife,
lavishly dressed, goes out and plays
bridge. They get most of their ideas
about America from the movies."
Theatre Discussed
All the European men, except in
Italy, she mentioned, are either old
or very young—there are no middle
aged, because of the war. Tnis is par
ticularly noticeable on the stage. "In
regard to the theatre," she said, "Ger
many is far ahead of anyone else in
the use of modern effects. The Eng
lish theatre is flat and the French
still give the old plays of Rostand
and Corneille. The new Shakespear
ean Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon has
not yet been built, so the productions
are still given in the moving picture
house."

France, and England, and while in
London took the opportunity to do re
search work on James Boswell's novel,
"Dorando," a story of the Douglas
Cause, which at the time caused quite
a political stir. The Scottish news
papers, because of favorable criti
cisms that Miss Bailey strongly sus
pects Boswell wrote himself, became
involved with the courts and were
prosecuted, with the result that the
question of the liberty of the press
was raised. Ultimately, the papers
were merely rebuked for their con
duct; but the book that Boswell wrote
anonymously did a great deal toward
strengthening the freedom that the
press enjoys today.
Germany Advanced
Continuing her remarks about Eu
rope, Miss Bailey said: "Germany is
the most advanced of the countries
and is ahead of us in the modern
movements of architecture and deco
ration, although there still are many
anachronisms between the medieval
and the twentieth century in the large

cities. Italy is filthy, and gives the
impression of having forgotten all the
uplift of the Renaissance. French
civilization appears to be just a
veneer —Montmarte is just a stupid
sham for tourists. The English coun
try is as romantic as the books say
it is, but London is terribly dirty."
Stanford Colony
Miss Bailey said that there is a
little Stanford colony in Paris, and
Sedley Peck, an alumnus, the
leading article of "A Week in Paris,"
a booklet telling travelers how to
spend the time. While she was there,
an alumnae of the University, Mrs.
Russell, exhibited in the Salon, being
the second Stanford graduate to do
so.
She went on to say that the Ameri
can tourist in Europe constantly
meets four major topics of conversa
tion —Prohibition, the Negro Problem,
the Awful American Extravagance,
and the Downtrodden American Hus
band. "There is a legend about this
husband: Europeans think that he
works hard all day at the office and
then goes home at night to cook din
ner and wash dishes, while his wife,
lavishly dressed, goes out and plays
bridge. They get most of their ideas
about America from the movies."
Theatre Discussed
All the European men, except in
Italy, she mentioned, are either old
or very young—there are no middle
aged, because of the war. Tnis is par
ticularly noticeable on the stage. "In
regard to the theatre," she said, "Ger
many is far ahead of anyone else in
the use of modern effects. The Eng
lish theatre is flat and the French
still give the old plays of Rostand
and Corneille. The new Shakespear
ean Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon has
not yet been built, so the productions
are still given in the moving picture
house."
"No European nation that I visited
likes the United States," Dr. Margery
Bailey, assistant professor of English,
who recently returned from a nine
months' trip abroad, said in an inter
view yesterday, "except Germany.
Certainly, the people of that country
are the most civil; they do not growl
all the time about the war, and they
do not blame us, but themselves, for
the reparations that they must pay.
Italy is furious because we do not
give her credit for having won the
war. France is mad because our sol
diers walked all over her vineyards,
and England, while civil on the sur
face, constantly pokes sly jabs at us
in the newspapers."
