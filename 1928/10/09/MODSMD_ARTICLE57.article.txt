ST. LOUIS, Oct. 8. (#>)—'The Yan
kees were stopped today in their rush
toward a second successive world's
championship—but not by the Cardi
nals.
A downpour of rain early this morn
ing swamped the playing field at
Sportsmans Park to such an extent
that Commissioner Landis authorized
postponement of the fourth game. The
weather prospects favor resumption
of the series tomorrow and playing
prospects indicate its abrupt end, un
less the National League champions
show a remarkable reversal of form.
