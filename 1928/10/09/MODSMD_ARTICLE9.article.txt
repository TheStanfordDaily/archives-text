## No Sale For Ship in U.S. As Government Contracts Go to Goodyear 
### 
FRIEDERICHSHAFEN, Germany,
Oct. 8. (,/P) â€”Good weather prospects
over the Atlantic were awaited to
night by Dr. Hugo Eckener before he
would announce the "sailing" hour of
the Graf Zeppelin, the huge new diri
gible he plana to pilot to the United
States. He hoped the reports would
be favorable for a departure Wednes
day.
The final test of the airship, a flight
of less than five hours, was given
today.
The drigible flew over Lake Con
stance while thousands of spectators,
a large proportion of whom were tour
ists attracted here by the coming
event, watched and cheered.
Dr. Eckener said tonight that it is
going to cost approximately $96,000
for the round trip to the United States.
This figure, he said, covered allow
ances for depreciation, repairs and
insurance on the ship and its occu
pants. Each of the passengers hae
been insured for 200,000 marks in case
of death.
Newspapers Pay
Dr. Eckener revealed that the chief
revenue for the trip will come from
newspaper interests who have been
given rights to file dispatches from
the ship.
Two German publications will pay
$15,600 between them. More than four
times the amount of $67,400 will come
from a chain of American newspapers.
Four private passengers are charged
$12,000, and the other $1000 needed to
make up the total will come from the
German Postal Department to pay for
mail that is to be carried across the
ocean.
Hope to Sell
It was emphasized that this total
does not- take into account the cost of
the various trial flights, including the
1800-mile trip over England and the
North Sea last week.
The builders of the big airship hope
to sell her. They admitted, however,
that any hopes they may have had
of finding the United States Govern
ment in a mood to be a purchaser had
been dissipated by the Washington
decision to have the Goodyear Zep
pelin Corporation build two giant
rigid dirigibles to specifications drawn
by Dr. Arnstein, former chief con->
structor of the Zeppelin works here.
These new American Navy ships
will double the size of the Graf Zep
pelin, being of 204,000 cubic meters
capacity (approximately 7,204,000
cubic feet) as against the 105,000
cubic meters (3,708,000 cubic feet)
capacity of the Graf Zeppelin. The
local air giant cost 4,000,000 marks,
equal to $960,000 in round figures.
The new American ships are to cost
four times as much.
