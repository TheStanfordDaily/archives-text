# ROBINSON WILL SPEAK AT P. A. STATION TODAY
## Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate Listed For Campaign Talk At 10:45 
### 
Senator Joseph T. Robinson, Demo
cratic vice-presidential nominee, will
speak at the Southern Pacific station
in Palo Alto this morning at 10:45
o'clock from the rear platform of his
train.
Senator Robinson was Democratic
floor leader in the Senate before his
nomination. It was he who was Anally
able to stop Senator Heflin's anti
pope tirades that nearly disorganized
the last session. This will be the only
opportunity Stanford students will
have to hear either of the Democratic
candidates speak during this cam
paign.
The above was the biggest news
that broke at the meeting of the
Smith-for-President Club last night.
The chief business was organization.
The following officers were elected:
president, George Bodle; vice-presi
dent, Chester Andrews; and secretary
treasurer, Charles O'Sullivan.
Plans for a Smith banquet, with
some prominent man such as ex-Sen
ator James D. Phelan as speaker,
were discussed. President Bodle em
phasized that the purpose of the club
was not to attack Hoover, for whom
many Smith supporters have the
greatest admiration, but to support
Smith strongly on the belief that he
was the better man for the job.
