### KATHLEEN FITZ 
Ram's Head announces that the an
nual Football Show will be presented
November 23, the night before the
Big Game. Gordon Davis and Harold
Helvenston are co-operating with the
society and the show promises to be
interesting.
All ideas for $kits, playlets, songs,
or whole acts are wanted immediately.
They should be sent in to Mel Jones
at the A.T.O. House. This is the first
call for contributions, and it is not
necessary to have them in completed
manuscripts. In fact, it is better to
send them in rough form so that the
authors and directors may work to
gether and offer suggestions.
The positive deadline for ideas will
be November 1. Tryouts for specialty
numbers will be held in the near fu
ture, and everyone should start work
ing immediately. Any masculine novel
ty dancers are especially wanted.
The musical director has not as yet
been appointed, but any ideas for
songs may be sent to Mel Jones, also.
Everyone's co-operation is needed, so
send in your ideas or scripts as soon
as possible.
