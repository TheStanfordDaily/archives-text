## 
### JOHN ROGERS 
"I like the air of freedom and spa
ciousness you have here at Stanford,"
Yusuke Tsurumi, leader of the Liber
alist party in the Japanese legislature,
told me just before liis lecture last
night. "In Japan we have not the
space in the cities and suburbs where
our universities are located to give
them the large grounds that the
American universities have. Every
thing there is ho crowded together.
This is the third or fourth time that
I have visited Stanford, and I think
it is a wonderful place."
Mr. Tsurumi speaks with scarcely
an accent. He is about live feet tall,
and his face, although forceful, has a
pleasant smile.
"The Kellogg Peace Tact Is a great

step forward," he remarked when he
was asked what he thought of it. "It
is too early now to tell what definite
good it will accomplish, but I am sure
it is a step in the right direction
toward the outlawing of war."
In regard to prohibition, he said
that it is a tremendous experiment,
but he thinks that it is a good one —
and he would like to see it succeed.
"The trouble is that in America, being
such a vast country, it is difficult to
enforce the dry laws. I am not a
prophet, hut I think that eventually
America will be able to make this
experiment, work."
He closed by saying that Japan is
rapidly becoming occidentalized, par
ticularly in the large cities, although
not so noticeably in the rural districts.
