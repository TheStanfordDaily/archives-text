# BIBLIOGRAPHY OF MACHEN'S WORKS IN LIBRARY NOW
## 
### 
A complete bibliography of the
works of Arthur Machen, English
novelist, essayist, and translator has
been loaned by Nathan Van Patten to
the Stanford library where it is now
on display.
Mr. Machen, though not well-known
to the general public, is considered
by a discriminating minority of
critics to be one of ifee more import
ant writers of the 20th century, and
his books are much sought by col
lectors.
The versatility of Machen's work
adds interest to the collection which
fills the four showcases in the library.
His work varies from a translation
of Casanova's memoirs to fiction of
the World War, such as "The Angel
of Mons" and "The Terror." Also he
has written many books on magic,
alchemy, and necromacy. These are
his main interests and he makes him
self and his prose highly mysterious.
