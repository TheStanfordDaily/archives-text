## First General Election By Manhood Suffrage Puts It To Real Test 
### 
"Liberalism, an idea spread over
Japan in the last fifteen years, has
helped to remove narrow-minded na
tionalism and develop international
mind," declared Yusuke Tsurumi last
night in his address on "Japanese
Liberalism in Action," delivered in
the Assembly Hall.
"This year, in the first general elec
tion by universal manhood suffrage,
it was put to the test. For the first
time in history the Government party
failed to get a working majority, and
the balance of power fell into the
hands of the new Liberals."
Tsurumi is himself a member of
this party and one of the eight men
elected to the diet. They were greatly
aided by the support of the press,
which has a wide circulation and real
power over public opinion.
"Japanese Liberalism is threatened
on two sides," said Tsurumi, "on one
by a reaction against sixty years of
occidentation, in an effort by the con
servatives to restore Japanese civili
zation, and on the other by the strong
interest among the younger genera
tion in socialism and communism. It
must convince the young intellectuals
that it has something to offer both
in theory and in practice."
Great changes in Japanese life, both
physical and mental, were cited by
the lecturer, as taking place in the
last sixty years. One has been in the
spread of popular education, modeled
on the American system, and includ
ing the compulsory study of the Eng
lish language. This has affected the
psychology of the people, and a west
ernization of habits and thought has
ensued.
