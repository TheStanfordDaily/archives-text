# BRUINS MAKE COAST DEBUT IN CARD TILT
## U.C.L.A. Out to Prove Worth As Conference Member; Pop Is Wary But "Not Worried" 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
An undefeated football team from
the University of California at Los
Angeles will pay a visit to the re
nowned Farm next Saturday to play
the first Coast Conference game of
their career. The visitors do not ex
pect to defeat the Cardinals or even
give them a scare, as badly crippled
as the Warner team is. On the con
trary, their intention will be to keep
down the score low enough to con
vince the football public that they
are worthy of their recent admission
to the "big time."
The Bruins are anxious to prove
that they "have stepped out" athletic
ally as well as scholastically, finan
cially, and materially in the last three
years. They will be a changed outfit
from that which the Stanford substi
tutes walloped 82-0 here in 1925. They
will be representing U.C.L.A., not
Southern Branch; they are called
Bruins now, not Grizzlies or Cubs;
and last and most important, they
will be a team of a much higher class,
for the former Minnesota coach, Bill
Spaulding, has succeeded in building
a machine that more closely resem
bles the dangerous elevens that used
to worry the Big Ten teams.
Fullback Joe Fleming, the big gun
of the Los Angeles eleven, will pos
sibly play against the Cards in spite
of the cracked rib which he received
in scoring the touchdown that tied
Arizona 7-7 two weeks ago. Even with
this news the most optimistic Blue
and-Gold rooters believe that they
will lose by a margin of three or four
touchdowns. Their pessimism may or
may not be justified. Coach Ed Walker
saw the Bruins hand a 32-0 licking to
the Caltech Engineers last week and
he reports that the southern outfit
"will give plenty of opposition."
That Pop Warner "respects the
Bruins, but is not worried," about ex
presses the situation. It »s believed
that he will start the first team minus
the services of Frank Wilton in the
backfield and Spud Harder at end.
Wilton, who left the hospital where
he was treated for water on the knee,
is definitely out of the game for at
least two weeks. Harder may recover
sufficiently to see action next Satur
day.
Bill Clark, substitute halfback who
showed flashes of speed in his brief
time of play last Saturday against
Oregon, is the latest to join the in
jured list. He is nursing a broken
nose.

years. They will be a changed outfit
from that which the Stanford substi
tutes walloped 82-0 here in 1925. They
will be representing U.C.L.A., not
Southern Branch; they are called
Bruins now, not Grizzlies or Cubs;

will be a team of a much higher class,

Spaulding, has succeeded in building
a machine that more closely resem

to worry the Big Ten teams.
Fullback Joe Fleming, the big gun
of the Los Angeles eleven, will pos
sibly play against the Cards in spite
of the cracked rib which he received
in scoring the touchdown that tied
Arizona 7-7 two weeks ago. Even with
this news the most optimistic Blue
and-Gold rooters believe that they
will lose by a margin of three or four
touchdowns. Their pessimism may or
may not be justified. Coach Ed Walker
saw the Bruins hand a 32-0 licking to
the Caltech Engineers last week and
he reports that the southern outfit
"will give plenty of opposition."
That Pop Warner "respects the
Bruins, but is not worried," about ex
presses the situation. It »s believed
that he will start the first team minus
the services of Frank Wilton in the
backfield and Spud Harder at end.
Wilton, who left the hospital where
he was treated for water on the knee,
is definitely out of the game for at
least two weeks. Harder may recover
sufficiently to see action next Satur
day.
Bill Clark, substitute halfback who
showed flashes of speed in his brief
time of play last Saturday against
Oregon, is the latest to join the in
jured list. He is nursing a broken
nose.
An undefeated football team from
the University of California at Los
Angeles will pay a visit to the re
nowned Farm next Saturday to play
the first Coast Conference game of
their career. The visitors do not ex
pect to defeat the Cardinals or even
give them a scare, as badly crippled
as the Warner team is. On the con
trary, their intention will be to keep
down the score low enough to con
vince the football public that they
are worthy of their recent admission
to the "big time."
