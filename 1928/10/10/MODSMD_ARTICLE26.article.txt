						Specious Slogan

### 
The campaign now being conducted by chambers of commerce, serv
ice clubs, and women's clubs to prod the lazy or stupid citizen out of
his lethargy and herd him to the polls on November 6 is, to us, a sad
and absurd waste of human energy. "Vote as you please, but vote," is
the slogan of this movement, the idea being that if the percentage of
votes cast to the total of eligible voters is increased from 45 to 60, great
glory is thereby shed upon the state achieving the increase. No thought
is given to: the question whether these quasi-compulsory votes are to be
cast with any intelligence or not.
The purpose of the movement is of course a laudable one: viz., to
create in the slacker citizen a political consciousness and and a sense of
civic responsibility. But do we accomplish this by dragging an indifferent
voter to the booth to hazard a guess as to where he will place the imprint
of the rubber stamp? As a matter of fact, the country would be better
off if the vote were reduced 25 per cent, provided the votes eliminated
were those of the ignorant and unresponsible. And is it not safe to as
sume that the ignorant and unresponsible are the classes of voters sought
by this movement? If your citizen has any intelligent interest in political
questions or any conscientious desire for the right conduct of govern
ment, he requires no bannered automobile to conduct him to his polling
place. You couldn't stand him off from it with a fire hose. ,
If the citizen sits with his neighbor upon the doorstep or by the side
of his fellow-laborer at lunch, and arouses his interest in a political move
ment, even though the subtle influence of a cigar is employed, he is
doing good government a service. But we have more patience with the
heeler who takes a bucket of corporation money and buys a block of votes
for a possibly useful and stabilizing piece of legislation, than we have
for the booster who drives madly about on election day urging Tom,
Dick, and Mary to vote, yet exercising no discrimination as to their
qualifications, no guess whether their votes will be cast for the preserva
tion or for the destruction of the nation.
