# How Busy a Candidate Is
## 
### 
Sometime last month the Daily dispatched a neat request to Mr.
George Akerson, secretary to Air. Herbert Hoover, asking him to solicit
a statement from ''the Chief," to appear in the opening edition of the
paper this quarter. Yesterday, a belated reply was received from Mr.
Akerson saying that every hour between now and election day was set
aside in Mr. Hoover's appointment book for someone or something.
From that fact can be gleaned an appreciation of what the penalties
to a man's peace and personal comfort are when he runs for high office.
Friends of Mr. Hoover here said after the nomination that during this
campaign he would "sweat blood." This is simply one of the demands
a democracy of the size of this country makes upon its public men.
When Mr. Hoover came here this summer and had taken a couple of
fishing trips to repair his strength, he appeared in excellent health to the
summer Daily reporters, who saw him quite often at close range. When
he returns to Stanford on November 5, the day before the election, he
will be tired and haggard, as only a presidential candidate can be. How
he will appear on the 7th of November, 110 one can foretell.
