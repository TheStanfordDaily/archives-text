Stanford is not the College Humor sort of college, as even that apostle
of "hey-hey" antics would grant. Nevertheless, it is a serious thing in
the life of the University when tryouts for the position of assistant yell
leader are announced, because we are definitely committed to the system
of rooting at athletic contests, and to so root we must have good yell
leaders.
For this reason, all sophomores with a proved or fancied flair for
leading yells ought to turn out at 12:45 o'clock today in the pavilion for
work in that exemplary course, Theory and Fractice of Yell Leading.
A yell leader represents the University more intimately to the general
public than perhaps any other student, barring not even football players.
It is highly desirable that he should be the right sort of man for the job.
A flock of tryoutees ought to assure the qualified man's eventually being
chosen.
