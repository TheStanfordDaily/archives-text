THE URBAN MOVEMENT
Not from Mecca to Medina, but from
the Farm to the City, and sometimes,
it is rumored, to San Jose, do Stanford
men make weekly hegiras. Moham
med's week-end in Medina started an
epoch in Saracenic civilization. But
what of the more than sundry Stan
ford week-ends? Are they starting an
urban movement of social life?
Not many years gone, there hardly
passed a week-end but what some
campus organization did not sponsor
a campus dance or social event of
some sort. Everyone went and every
one enjoyed himself to the fullest. It
was the thing to do. Compare the
number of all-University affairs of last
year with the number given say five
years previous. It is quite evident
from such comparison that the years
before were rich, and that the years
of OUR college careers are poor in
such events.
Someone mentions in feeble pro
test, cast dances. Perhaps in their

heydey cast dances were well patron
ized, but in these decadent days of
campus indifference, it is another
story. The floor is small, itinerant
Roughs crowd the edges, occupying the
seats and making it unpleasant for
the dancers, and as a result the crowd
thins after the first dance or so. Nor
are automobiles responsible for this
urban movement. Witness the Masque
Ball of last spring and the more re
cent registration dance sponsored by
the Daily. Well-bkcked all-University
dances, even in this time of social
famine, are supported by the campus.
Pray then let there be a renaissance
of the campus dance; let strong
armed organizations brave the task
and put on all-University dances, and
let Roughs and the Five Hundred
back them. Thus will the urban move
ment become a thing of history and
SSanford democracy will enjoy re
invigoration under the influence of
such a renaissance.
