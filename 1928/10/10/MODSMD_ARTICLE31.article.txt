Wide Fields. By Paul Green. (New
York: Robert M. Mcßride and
Company, 1928.)
Paul Green, you know, won last
year's Pulitzer Prize for Drama with
his play, "In Abraham's Bosom." Now
he turns to fiction for a spell and
gives us a series of sketches and
stories of life among the poor white
farmers of the Carolina cotton belt.
But after all, Green's strength is as
a dramatist. Hence, the power and
vividness of this book comes from
his ability to portray types, to handle
dialogue. Negroes and whites, most
of them ignorant tenant farmers,
parade before us more clearly deline
ated than they would be on a moving
picture screen. We get little snatches
of their lives — comedy, tragedy,
humor, pathos.
Ends Poorly
The greatest disappointment in
most of the sketches is the fact that
they end. We get a glimpse of a frac
tion of a life that is so entrancingly
interesting that we hate like sin to

not be able to read on indefinitely.
Revivals, religion, and rum; tobac
co, corn, and cotton; births, deaths,
and love —these are the simple ele
ments that make up the life o£ the
"poor white trash" of Carolina. Green
takes splashes of this raw stuff of
nature and records it with a veracity
that's uncanny.
And in the end of the book he has
a characterization of the people in
the neighborhood of Little Bethel. It's
a rare treat. Take for instance, "Katie
Harris —the shouting fanatic of Little
Bethel. Never a big meeting went by
that she didn't fall in trances and get
healed of something. It was said that
once when she caught the unknown
tongues spirit out of Johnson County
she talked for hours in Chinese. Dur
ing an open-air meeting one night by
the mill-pond, she fell in a religious
fit and went rolling and bouncing
down the incline towards the water.
San Adams rushed forward and saved
her from drowning."
