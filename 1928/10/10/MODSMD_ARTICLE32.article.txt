BLIND AS BATS
Fans are as blind as bats.
Those, or others to that effect, are
the words of Dick Hyland, Stanford's
fleet halfback of yesteryear. Perhaps
it is pursuing a well-worn subject too
far to again bring up Hyland's dis
sertation on Pop Warner, but it was
in this article that Tricky Dick ex
pressed himself on those who fill the
stadium.
And Mr. Hyland hit the pro
verbial nail pretty squarely upon
its head. Fans —the general run
of them —are as blind as bats. Ab
solutely all the average spectator
sees, or rather attempts to see,
is the ball and the man who is
carrying it.
Wherever football is known at all
it is realized that the flashy halves
and the dynamic fulls can be flashy
and dynamic only when real co-opera
tion is given by other members of the
team.
Early this fall, a San Francisco
sports scribe wrote an article or
two on how to watch a grid game.
All the thanks he received came
in the form of a flock of horse
laughs.
Be that as it may, this San
Francisco writer had an excellent
idea, and those who laughed loud
est might have profited by perus
ing his stories.
Few ever notice a guard, unless, by
superhuman effort, he breaks through
the line and makes a sensational
tackle or blocks a punt. Yet the
guards, especially on a Warner team,
have a man-sized job. In the inter
ference they run as much as a half
back, and always on the defense they
take a terrific beating.
Then, too, there is the halfback who
seldom gets the pigskin, but spatters
himself all over the field in un effort
to break the way for his ball-toting
teammate. He doesn't figure in the
stories which headlines tell, but his
work is just as necessary as that of
the other fellow.
The same applies to the fan at
titude on the team as a whole.
Last week at this time it wasn't
hard to find those who thought
that the Cards as football players
would make good chorus men.
That was just after the Olympic
Club victory.
Today, Stanford's warriors, in
the opinion of the dear public,
are a divine gift to griddom. The
score last Saturday was Stanford
26, Oregon 12.
Such, unfortunately, i 6 human
nature. —Bob Speers.

the other fellow.
The same applies to the fan at
titude on the team as a whole.
Last week at this time it wasn't
hard to find those who thought
that the Cards as football players
would make good chorus men.
That was just after the Olympic
Club victory.
Today, Stanford's warriors, in
the opinion of the dear public,
are a divine gift to griddom. The
score last Saturday was Stanford
26, Oregon 12.

BLIND AS BATS
Fans are as blind as bats.
Those, or others to that effect, are
the words of Dick Hyland, Stanford's
fleet halfback of yesteryear. Perhaps
it is pursuing a well-worn subject too
far to again bring up Hyland's dis
sertation on Pop Warner, but it was
in this article that Tricky Dick ex
pressed himself on those who fill the
stadium.
And Mr. Hyland hit the pro
verbial nail pretty squarely upon
its head. Fans —the general run
of them —are as blind as bats. Ab
solutely all the average spectator
sees, or rather attempts to see,
is the ball and the man who is
carrying it.
Wherever football is known at all
it is realized that the flashy halves
and the dynamic fulls can be flashy
and dynamic only when real co-opera
tion is given by other members of the
team.
Early this fall, a San Francisco
sports scribe wrote an article or
two on how to watch a grid game.
All the thanks he received came
in the form of a flock of horse
laughs.
Be that as it may, this San
Francisco writer had an excellent
idea, and those who laughed loud
est might have profited by perus
ing his stories.
Few ever notice a guard, unless, by
superhuman effort, he breaks through
the line and makes a sensational
tackle or blocks a punt. Yet the
guards, especially on a Warner team,
have a man-sized job. In the inter
ference they run as much as a half
back, and always on the defense they
take a terrific beating.
Then, too, there is the halfback who
seldom gets the pigskin, but spatters
himself all over the field in un effort
to break the way for his ball-toting
teammate. He doesn't figure in the
stories which headlines tell, but his
work is just as necessary as that of
the other fellow.
