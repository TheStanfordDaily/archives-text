NEW YORK, Oct. 9. (/P)â€”'The stock
market turned abruptly upward toduy
after an early period of Irregularity.
Selling, based on the theory that the
technical position of many stocks had
been weakened by the recent advance
; and that a downward readjustment
was necessary, carried scores of is
j sues down 2 to 3 points in the early
trading, and some even more.
Although pools had bit up a few
j specialties to new high records dur
ing the morning, the big buying move
i ment did not get under way until mid
afternoon when motors, steels, cop
pers, and specialties were bought in
enormous volume at rising prices.
Trading, which had shown a tendency
to fall off on the decline, picked up
considerably on the rally.
