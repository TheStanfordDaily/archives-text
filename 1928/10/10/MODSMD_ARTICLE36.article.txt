# REVEAL DIMENSIONS OF FOOTBALL MEN
## Official Statistics Give Information Concerning Numbers, Weight, Positions, Nicknames, Ages, Residences 
### 
For the first time this season, official statistics concerning the physical propor
tions and dimensions of the forty-nine men on the varsity football squad have been
issued by the publicity department of the Hoard of Athletic Control. It is interesting
to note, in scanning the roster, that no players bear Nos. 1 or 13 on their jerseys.
No. 1 belonged to Ernest Nevers and was hallowed by vote when he finished playing
for Stanford, and No. 13 nobody wants.
