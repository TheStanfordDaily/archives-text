# DISTRIBUTION OF MAILS AIDED BY SYSTEM IN USE
## 
### 
Postmaster W. C. Werry announces
that mail is being handled with more
speed and greater ease this year than
previously, due to a circular letter
which was sent out to all incoming
freshmen around September 1, advis
ing that they reserve their postofl'ice
boxes before arriving on the campus.
Box applications were inserted in the
letter.
The prompt response of a majority
of the freshmen made it possible for
most of the mail to arrive at the Uni
versity fully addressed, and did away
with the confusion caused by the re
ceipt of huge quantities of letters and
parcels bearing no address other llian
Stanford University.
Superintendent Mason again stress
es the importance of students inform
ing their friends of their box number.
Mail properly addressed receives
prompt attention, while distribution
is held up several hours by letters
sent to General Delivery, as these box
numbers must be looked up in the
files, he said.
