# SPORTS OF 1928
## Hoyt's Great Victory 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Waite Hoyt, the former Boy Won
der, just refuses to grow up. He is
now 29 years old, and has been pitch
ing professionally for twelve years.
Yet on October 4th he turned in al
most as dazzling a performance
against the Cardinals as he did
against the Giants seven years ago,
when he shut out the McGrawmen
with only two hits.
To tell the truth, the first game of
the 1928 world series was quite lack
ing in thrills, due almost entirely to
the masterful pitching of the "Merry
Mortician of Flatbush." Hoyt, you
know, is a licensed undertaker in
Brooklyn, and he certainly embalmed
those Red Birds! Only Bottomley,
who hit a home run, got as far as sec
ond base, while Harper's and Bottom
ley's singles were the only other hits
off Hoyt in the whole contest. Waite
won twenty-two games this year, get- '
ting a $2000 bonus for his last victory, j
but this, his fifth world series triumph, ;
was far sweeter to him than any other
game he has won since 1921. It was
quite an honor to be called upon to
open the world series, and Hoyt came

I through like a "Matty," a Bender, or a
| Coombs.
As for the game, but for Babe
: Ruth's two doubles, Meusel's and Bot
j tomley's homers, fielding stunts by
| Koenig, Bengough, and Marranville,
i the presence of Dempsey, Hornsby,
J and Vance in the press section, and
the fact that the world series of 1928
was finally under way, it would have
been quite an ordinary occasion. To
tell the truth, the ride back to the
Commodore Hotel in the huge press
bus, with a cop on a screeching motor
cycle ahead of us, was much more
exciting.
Hoyt pitched again yesterday for
the Yanks and was responsible for
their 7 to 3 victory, ending as well
as beginning the world series.
Fraternity grades have dropped,
while sorority marks have risen at
the University of Minnesota.
The New York Yankees have more
than eighty baseball bats for the
World's Series.

was far sweeter to him than any other
game he has won since 1921. It was
quite an honor to be called upon to
open the world series, and Hoyt came

I through like a "Matty," a Bender, or a
| Coombs.
As for the game, but for Babe
: Ruth's two doubles, Meusel's and Bot
j tomley's homers, fielding stunts by
| Koenig, Bengough, and Marranville,
i the presence of Dempsey, Hornsby,
J and Vance in the press section, and
the fact that the world series of 1928
was finally under way, it would have
been quite an ordinary occasion. To
tell the truth, the ride back to the
Commodore Hotel in the huge press
bus, with a cop on a screeching motor
cycle ahead of us, was much more
exciting.
Hoyt pitched again yesterday for
the Yanks and was responsible for
their 7 to 3 victory, ending as well
as beginning the world series.
Fraternity grades have dropped,
while sorority marks have risen at
the University of Minnesota.
The New York Yankees have more

World's Series.

Waite Hoyt, the former Boy Won
der, just refuses to grow up. He is
now 29 years old, and has been pitch
ing professionally for twelve years.
Yet on October 4th he turned in al
most as dazzling a performance
against the Cardinals as he did
against the Giants seven years ago,
when he shut out the McGrawmen
with only two hits.
To tell the truth, the first game of
the 1928 world series was quite lack
ing in thrills, due almost entirely to
the masterful pitching of the "Merry
Mortician of Flatbush." Hoyt, you
know, is a licensed undertaker in
Brooklyn, and he certainly embalmed
those Red Birds! Only Bottomley,
who hit a home run, got as far as sec
ond base, while Harper's and Bottom
ley's singles were the only other hits
off Hoyt in the whole contest. Waite
won twenty-two games this year, get- '
ting a $2000 bonus for his last victory, j
but this, his fifth world series triumph, ;
was far sweeter to him than any other
game he has won since 1921. It was

open the world series, and Hoyt came
