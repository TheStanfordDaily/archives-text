his managers, Evens and Salter,
through which Tibbett could devote
more time to the field of concert,
thereby carrying his art to many peo
ple over the United States who other
wise would have no opportunity to
hear him.
Critics over the country have ac
claimed the famous baritone as a tri
umphant success in concert as well

of him: "Tibbett has a glorious voice.
He proved to be the sensation of the
evening." The Detroit Evening Times
writes: "Tibbett is one of the joys of
the concert stage, an artist with suf
ficient imagination to be interested in
.the lyrics of his songs, and not mere
ly a singing machine."
Tibbett will sing at Stanford in the
first concert of the year. Through the
efforts of the Associated Students
tickets have been secured for this
event at a substantially reduced stu
dent rate. Season tickets are now on
sale at the Old Union.
