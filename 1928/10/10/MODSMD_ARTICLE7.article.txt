# WOMEN'S GYM CLASSES WILL COMMENCE TODAY
## 
### 
Women's gymnasium classes will
begin on the regular schedule today.
The delay In the commencement of
classes is due to the fact that physical
examinations have been carried on
through Monday and yesterday of this
week.
Hockey will be the sport of this
fall quarter. Competition promises to
be keen, for the registration is greater
than it has been in past years.
