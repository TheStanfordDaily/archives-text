# ARTMAN ADDED TO CARD TEAM HOSPITAL LIST
## Stanford Squad Has Twelve Pound Average Weight Advantage Over U.C.L.A. Men 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Stanford football news begins to
bear a closer resemblance to World
War casualty reports, with the "in
capacitated" list growing consistently.
€orwin Artman, giant tackle and
heaviest man on the Cardinal squad,
is the latest to be temporarily lost
from the lineup. He is in the local
hospital with a light touch of "ilu"
but is expected to recover rapidly
enough to take his place on the line
when the Redshirts meet the invading
CJ.C.L.A. eleven here next Saturday.

Artman's name on the hospital list
follows closely after the names of
Preston, Clark, Wilton, and Harder,
all first-string men who are out with
injuries. Spud Harder appeared at
practice yesterday but was unable to
participate actively because of his leg
injury which causes him to walk with
a decided limp.
Stress Aerial Attack
There was no scrimmage at yester
day's practice session. Pop Warner, in
addition to the usual training exer
•cises, continues to conline his men
this week to signal drill with stress
on the aerial attack. On the power
plays the men have been striving for
harder and more effective charging.

In Los Angeles the Bruins have
been attempting to perfect their pass
ing attack and have given indication
that they intend to rely greatly on
the overhead system against Stan
ford. The Bruin line has shown up
well in games to date, but Coach Bill
Spaulding realizes that his forwards
have not been up against opposition
nearly as strong as it will Saturday
.against the heavy Warner forwards.
Light Backfield

The southern team's backfield is
also much lighter than the Card back
field. Each one of Spaulding's four
quarterbacks weighs in at less than
the two lightest men on the Stanford
team, Bill Clark and Frank Wilton.
•Only one man, Center Herman Ep
stein, tips the scales around 200
pounds, whereas Stanford has three
two-hundred pounders playing on the
.first string. The average weight ot
the Bruins' squad of forty-one men
is 174 pounds as compared with Stan
ford's average weight of 186.

From three to five hundred Gold
and-Blue rooters are expected to be
on hand Saturday to root for their
team in its initial debut as a Coast
Conference member.
