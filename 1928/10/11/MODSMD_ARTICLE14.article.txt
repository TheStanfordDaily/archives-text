# BYRD LEAVES ON ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION
## Whaler C. A. Larsen Goes Out On Flood Tide for Two Years' Expedition 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10. (/P)—IThe1The
Antarctic airplane expedition of Com
mander Richard E. Byrd bid America
"goodbye" today. At five o'clock this
afternoon as flood tide sweeps into
Los Angeles harbor, the picturesque
aviator-explorer set out on his great
est thrust into the unknown.

Aboard the staunch whaler C. A.
Larsen, Byrd, and a small band of
eager companions will be carried to
Dunedin, New Zealand, where their
last drive into the South Polar zone
begins. Across the Pacific Ocean they
will follow two other vessels of the
Byrd expedition, the Eleanor Boiling
and the Sir James Clark Ross, well
on their way to distant New Zealand.

All three of the ships carry great
stores of supplies, including air
planes, which Byrd will employ in his
two-year exploration of the greatest
frozen area on earth. Eighty-two men
will aid the daring plans of the Com
mander, who has already flown above
the North Pole and across the At
lantic.
In bidding adieu to American
shores, Commander Byrd dispatched
an official report to the Secretary of
the Navy, and indicated that he does
not expect to see the United States
again until July 1930. The oil export
docks of the Western Oil and Refining
Company, in the west basin of Los
Angeles harbor, was the scene of the
departure.
Mayor Cryer of Los Angeles, naval
and military officers, and civic offi
cials formed the "Godspeed" commit
tee assembled on the dock where the
great whale oil tanker took on a rec
ord cargo of fuel oil, some 47,500 bar
rels, and loaded supplies, provisions,
live sheep, and milch cows through
out the night.
