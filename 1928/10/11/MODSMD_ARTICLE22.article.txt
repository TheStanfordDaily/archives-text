# SEN. ROBINSON ATTACKS G.O.P. IN INTERVIEW
## Democratic Nominee Reviews Party's Stand on Issues; Pledges Support of Dry Law 
### PHILIP STOCKTON 
"I have been discussing Tammany
since the outset of my speaking cam
paign on Labor Day. Tammany is
simply a political organization. Smith
is not bossed by it. He bosses Tam
many. Even if everything they say
about Tammany were true, which it
is not, I would rather link arms with
Tammany than with the Vare Repub
lican machine of Philadelphia or
Thompson of Chicago."
Senator Robinson, with his pub
licity director and State Chairman
McPike, is speaking on the train to
San Francisco. His manner is pleas
ant. When he speaks he shows the
command of facts and the personality
that has made him one of the grand
old men of the Senate, Democratic
Senate leader, and now vice-presiden
tial nominee. Mrs. Robinson asked the
writer to express her gratitude for
the flowers and presents she received
at Palo Alto.
Farm Bills Vetoes
"The Republican party has not done
anything for the farmer," Robinson
declared. "Coolidge has vetoed two
farm relief bills, apparently with the
advice of his right-hand man, Hoover.
The Democratic Party offers the
farmer a definite plan of relief.
"The Democratic platform con
demns the Republican party for fail
ure to enforce the Volstead law and
18th Amendment during the last eight
years and pledges enforcement to the
greatest possible extent. Beyond this
is does not go, and any Democrat is
free to express his views of modifica
tion. Smith believes the law should
be changed to permit State Rights
but is unequivocably opposed to the
return of the saloon."
Boulder Dam
I mentioned Boulder Dam. "Tell
them," said Chairman McPike, "that
of New York State's twenty-two
Democratic congressmen, twenty-one
voted for the Swing Johnston Bill. Of
eighteen Republican congressmen
from the same state, fourteen voted
against the measure. Both New York
senators, Tammany men, stayed up
all night with Senator Johnston in a
vain attempt to get a vote on the bill
over the Republic filibuster on the
senate floor at the close of the last
session."
"The Democratic platform is speci
fic on the tariff question," said Robin
son. "No change in the tariff is con ;
templated which will in any way harm
American Labor or legitimate busi
ness interests."
In his speech at Los Angeles Sena
tor Robinson told an enthusiastic
crowd that Governor Smith's religion
should not be held against him in a
nation dedicated to religious toler
ance, pointed to Smith's record as
governor in New York State, and
scored ministers who used their pul
pits not to preach Christ, but to attack
A1 Smith.
That "battle-scarred veteran of the
political arena," Senator Joseph T.
Robinson, of Arkansas, invaded the
Hoover stronghold yesterday. On his
way to San Francisco, where he de
livered a campaign address last night,
the Democratic candidate for vice
president spoke briefly from the rear
platform of his special train.
Varied Audience
His audience was a varied one. It
consisted, in part, of Republicans
who were there to listen rather than
to cheer. Members of the Stanford
Smith Club were there in full force,
along with many University students.
By the time the special came in, the
crowd numbered several hundred.
Mrs. Robinson stood with the Sen
ator while he spoke to the throng.
His talk was brief, and the train
pulled out as he swung into a spirited
espousal of the progressive qualities
of Governor Alfred E. Smith, his run
ning mate.
"I wish Mr. Hoover success in every
way except one," said Senator Robin
son. "I sincerely hope and confidently
expect that he will be beateu, and
beaten badly, on November the sixth."
