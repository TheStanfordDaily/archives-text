# Statement of Policy

### 
Many students have inquired within the last week what attitude the
Daily will take toward the presidential race, toward participation by
University officers in it, and toward those who want to air their views of
the candidates in this paper.

In reply to these natural questions, we answer that we shall take the
part of none of the candidates, not because of lack of interest in them,
but because there is no need this late in the campaign to traverse the
complicated stairway of thought by which one arrives at a choice for
the mighty office. Most alert people should be able to decide whom they
want for President soon after the acceptance speeches are made; all
the campaigning is, to us, so much wasted time and news space.
Criticism of the University's taking a decidedly Republican stand in
this campaign is specious. Certain officers of the University have irons
in the fire at the present time, and they are perfectly right in doing what
is reasonable to advance Mr. Hoover's interests and, indirectly, their own.
Nearly all of these men we speak of are long-time friends of the candi
date, and they would be leaning backward if they failed to work for him
merely because they happened to be connected with the University, which
is supposedly non-partisan.

The University is, as a matter of fact, non-partisan in that it is mak
ing no attempt to force student opinion Hoover-wards, or to suppress
support of A1 Smith or Norman Thomas. No interdict of the political
clubs will be forthcoming, we are confident.

To those who want to use the columns of the Daily for presenting
their opinions upon the political situation, the Daily has to say that it
welcomes these. A project is presently to be launched whereby repre
sentatives of each of the political clubs will on successive days contribute
articles discussing campaign issues from their points of view. Student
opinion can in that way probably be best expressed and a lesson in citi
zenship well learned.
