# Non-Partisan

The Bookstore has at length indicated its non-partisanship. During
the past summer, Will Irwin's "Herbert Hoover" and William Hard's
"Who's Hoover" have been prominently but exclusively displayed. Now,
they are merely part of an inclusive political literature exhibit, which has
been supplemented by Norman Hapgood's and Henry Moskowitz' "Up
from the City Streets" and Henry Minor's "Story of the Democratic
Party."
The Bookstore's broadmindedness is a contrast to the attitude of the
Hoover War Library and the Thomas W r elton Stanford Art Gallery,
which have exhibits of Hoover's war work. Can't we be completely non
partisan and have a brown derby exhibit somewhere?
