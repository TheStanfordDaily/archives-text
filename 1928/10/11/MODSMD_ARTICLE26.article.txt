The University of Southern California Trojan and the Oregon State
State College Barometer both have saluted Stanford for having given the
nation a Republican candidate for President, and the former comes out
very strongly for Mr. Hoover, asserting that someday, it hopes, Stanford
may have the pleasure of turning about and supporting a U.S.C. man for
President. The valued Barometer comments on this gesture as affording
a pleasant lull to the usual noisy relations bet\yeen us and U.S.C. and
concludes that it is conceivable that Oregon State itself might not be
unwilling to see the presidency go to the Pacific Coast Conference.
Of course it is flattering to read salvos of praise for having had the
foresight to let down the bars of the English department and graduated
a man who has proved so exemplary an alumnus. Hoover, however, is a
product of a Stanford that is no more, except very vestigially. What the
Daily wants to know is, what men of the present day are growing up
here who will be available to run against this U.S.C. man whom the
Trojan wants us to support?
