# California's Viewpoint

Dr. Wilbur's catchphrase, "mentally rotten," applied by him to vio
lators of the Stanford honor system, has swept the University, of Cali
fornia campus, if one may judge from comment in the Daily Californian.
Great play has been given by that organ to the news that the honor
system here has started to "creak." Indeed, we note that everywhere
much attention is being given to the honor problem.
California last year revoked the rule of no professors in the class
room during examinations, Southern California is bothered with vio
lations of it, Yale has abolished it, and Harvard never had it. Princeton,
on the other hand, finds that the honor spirit is more and more respected
as it becomes intrenched. What Stanford will be able to do about its
academic honor is soon to be determined by the commission which Dr.
Wilbur recommended that President Cavalero of the A.S.S.U. appoint.
I hose who dislike the phrase honor "system" will find their senti
ments voiced in the following editorial from the Daily Californian:
"When a inan smiles on the honor system, lie is mentally rotten," Presi
dent Kay Lyman Wilbur of Stanford University declared Friday.
, President Wilbur doubtless used "honor system" as synonymous with
"honor," in which case the truth of his statement cannot be denied. No one
is so brave as to say that the man who scoffs at honor is possessed of a
healthy mind.
A man might easily smile on a so-called honor system, however, with
out scoffing at honor.
