The Editor, Sir:
My, my! We just will never stop
learning new and interesting things
about this Dick Hyland person. First
he was a Dick Merriwell on the Stan
ford football team. Next, as he re
ported in his own inimitable manner,
he won the Olympic rugby champion
ship single-handed for the United
States. Just about this same time he
blossomed forth as an author. Then
he turned newspaper writer, and once
was discovered in the act of helping
Bill Spaulding coach his University
of California at Los Angeles football
team, without Bill having much to say
about it.

And now, most astounding of all,
he has turned humorist, and is fairly
keeping the citizenry of southern
California holding its sides with his
merry quips and comments in a Los
Angeles morning paper. He puts Dr.
Johnson, Dick Steele, Will Irwin, Ring
Lardner, and Will Rogers in the "dub"
class, so brilliant are his sallies, so
keen are his jests.

And the way he manages to bring
the University of Southern California
into all of his stories has put the Tro
jans in the merriest of moods. His
continual line of smart chatter, so
jolly, so clever, and yet so refined,
has caused the Thundering Herd to
actually cry with laughter. The Tro
jan fans slap each other on the back
in joyful comaraderie, remarking to
each other, "Allons, old fellow, and
isn't this Hyland cherub the Prince
of Wit!" To which, the only answer
is, "Verily, old bean, his harmless
little jests, and his unceasing sports
manship, bespeak a truly massive in
tellect."

Southern Californians, and that in
cludes the entire population of that
district, as well as the University
thereof, will ever hold a warm spot in
their hearts for "Tricky Dick" or ]
"Romping Richard" as he is some-i
times affectionately dubbed. Ever an
earnest young man, his heaving chest
conceals a heart of gold, and a jest- j
ing spirit that will have its joke. His
merry antics in running behind his !
own goal post in the Alabama game
are still remembered, and the slight- |
est mention is always good for a gale
of laughter. It was just about a year
ago when a nationally circulated
magazine published his now historic
story. You'll probably recall it. The :
title slips the memory just now, but I
it was something about, "How I de-'
feated U.S.C., by Dick Hyland."

Therein, the ever-jesting Richard,
who ever was a modest and unassum
ing youth, told how he rallied his
team, when it was behind, to defeat
the massive Trojans. Painting his
own picture in glowing words, Hyland
told how he dashed to the winning;
touchdown, how the stands arose as 1
one man, and cheered him to the echo, j
how the weak, puny Stanford team
outfought the great Trojan eleven.
Some southern California fans took I
offense at the magic tale. Of course j
Richard meant no offense. His sweet
character was publicly maligned, but |

the offenders were quickly hushed
up. Nothing must occur to spoil the
happy relationships which existed be
tween the King of Jesters, and his
happy subjects.

It seemed that some of the Stanford
men themselves took objection to the
story. Ted Shipkey, Ed Walker, Biff
Hoffman, that great fullback, Eli Post,
Sellman, and the others didn't par
ticularly care to be referred to as
puny. Neither did they want it to
seem that that great, big, dreadful
Trojan team of eleven man-eating
savages had opposed poor little Rich
ard all by himself. They were out
there on that field, most of them more
than Richard was himself, and they
did plenty of work on their own. Then
there was little Mike Murphy, who
actually was the hero of the game.
Jesting Richard, in his own merry
way, hadn't even mentioned Mike. But
then, the Southern California ad
mirers of the one-man Stanford team
couldn't do anything about that.

But one Trojan just wouldn't be
cured. Romping Richard had made
him the villain of his masterpiece,
and Mort Kaer didn't care much about
being a villain. Richard's local ad
mirers tried in vain to point out that
it merely was one of Hyland's his
toric jests that Kaer had been called
"dumb." They said it was one of the
funniest things they ever read, when
Hyland referred to them as a "bunch
of dodoes." The dodo was extinct,
and nobody knew what it meant any
way.

But Kaer just wouldn't get over his
antipathy. It was just two years later
that he considered the score evened.
He had graduated from Southern
California, but that "dumb" idea still
rankled. He tried playing football
with the Olympic Club. Mort didn't
hold any brief against Stanford itself.
But still, every time the big Red team
trotted on the field, he saw the
shadowy figure of Tricky Dick some
where in the mob. And that made him
see more red than there was in all of
the Cardinal sweaters.
Maybe you remember the score.
Anyway, it was 12-G with the Olympic
Club in front, and Kaer manufactured
both of those touchdowns. He con
siders the score even. He wished Hy
land had been 011 the team, but he
wasn't, and Mort did the best he
could to make up for that "dumb" idea.
But of course nothing like that
could happen again. Kaer was some
thing of a radical to take offense at
anything the jesting Richard would
write. So his merry comments in the
local morning paper haven't done
more than give the Trojans a hearty
chuckle. They wish he was on the
Stanford team again, so they could
clasp his hand, clap him on the back,
and thank him for those many, many
kind words. But no doubt, Richard
will be at the field, and he will have
an opportunity to see the Trojans
act just as they would if he were in
there. And, maybe, Richard will be
glad he wasn't.

And now, most astounding of all,
he has turned humorist, and is fairly
keeping the citizenry of southern
California holding its sides with his
merry quips and comments in a Los
Angeles morning paper. He puts Dr.
Johnson, Dick Steele, Will Irwin, Ring
Lardner, and Will Rogers in the "dub"
class, so brilliant are his sallies, so
keen are his jests.

And the way he manages to bring
the University of Southern California
into all of his stories has put the Tro
jans in the merriest of moods. His
continual line of smart chatter, so
jolly, so clever, and yet so refined,
has caused the Thundering Herd to
actually cry with laughter. The Tro
jan fans slap each other on the back
in joyful comaraderie, remarking to
each other, "Allons, old fellow, and
isn't this Hyland cherub the Prince
of Wit!" To which, the only answer
is, "Verily, old bean, his harmless
little jests, and his unceasing sports
manship, bespeak a truly massive in
tellect."

Southern Californians, and that in
cludes the entire population of that
district, as well as the University
thereof, will ever hold a warm spot in
their hearts for "Tricky Dick" or ]
"Romping Richard" as he is some-i
times affectionately dubbed. Ever an
earnest young man, his heaving chest
conceals a heart of gold, and a jest- j
ing spirit that will have its joke. His
merry antics in running behind his !
own goal post in the Alabama game
are still remembered, and the slight- |
est mention is always good for a gale
of laughter. It was just about a year
ago when a nationally circulated
magazine published his now historic
story. You'll probably recall it. The :
title slips the memory just now, but I
it was something about, "How I de-'
feated U.S.C., by Dick Hyland."

Therein, the ever-jesting Richard,
who ever was a modest and unassum
ing youth, told how he rallied his
team, when it was behind, to defeat
the massive Trojans. Painting his
own picture in glowing words, Hyland
told how he dashed to the winning;
touchdown, how the stands arose as 1
one man, and cheered him to the echo, j
how the weak, puny Stanford team
outfought the great Trojan eleven.
Some southern California fans took I
offense at the magic tale. Of course j
Richard meant no offense. His sweet
character was publicly maligned, but |

the offenders were quickly hushed
up. Nothing must occur to spoil the
happy relationships which existed be
tween the King of Jesters, and his
happy subjects.

It seemed that some of the Stanford
men themselves took objection to the
story. Ted Shipkey, Ed Walker, Biff
Hoffman, that great fullback, Eli Post,
Sellman, and the others didn't par
ticularly care to be referred to as
puny. Neither did they want it to
seem that that great, big, dreadful
Trojan team of eleven man-eating
savages had opposed poor little Rich
ard all by himself. They were out
there on that field, most of them more
than Richard was himself, and they
did plenty of work on their own. Then
there was little Mike Murphy, who
actually was the hero of the game.
Jesting Richard, in his own merry
way, hadn't even mentioned Mike. But
then, the Southern California ad
mirers of the one-man Stanford team
couldn't do anything about that.

But one Trojan just wouldn't be
cured. Romping Richard had made
him the villain of his masterpiece,
and Mort Kaer didn't care much about
being a villain. Richard's local ad
mirers tried in vain to point out that
it merely was one of Hyland's his
toric jests that Kaer had been called
"dumb." They said it was one of the
funniest things they ever read, when
Hyland referred to them as a "bunch
of dodoes." The dodo was extinct,
and nobody knew what it meant any
way.

But Kaer just wouldn't get over his
antipathy. It was just two years later
that he considered the score evened.
He had graduated from Southern
California, but that "dumb" idea still
rankled. He tried playing football
with the Olympic Club. Mort didn't
hold any brief against Stanford itself.
But still, every time the big Red team
trotted on the field, he saw the
shadowy figure of Tricky Dick some
where in the mob. And that made him
see more red than there was in all of
the Cardinal sweaters.
Maybe you remember the score.
Anyway, it was 12-G with the Olympic
Club in front, and Kaer manufactured
both of those touchdowns. He con
siders the score even. He wished Hy
land had been 011 the team, but he
wasn't, and Mort did the best he
could to make up for that "dumb" idea.
But of course nothing like that
could happen again. Kaer was some
thing of a radical to take offense at
anything the jesting Richard would
write. So his merry comments in the
local morning paper haven't done
more than give the Trojans a hearty
chuckle. They wish he was on the
Stanford team again, so they could
clasp his hand, clap him on the back,
and thank him for those many, many
kind words. But no doubt, Richard
will be at the field, and he will have
an opportunity to see the Trojans
act just as they would if he were in
there. And, maybe, Richard will be
glad he wasn't.

has caused the Thundering Herd to
actually cry with laughter. The Tro
jan fans slap each other on the back
in joyful comaraderie, remarking to
each other, "Allons, old fellow, and
isn't this Hyland cherub the Prince
of Wit!" To which, the only answer
is, "Verily, old bean, his harmless
little jests, and his unceasing sports
manship, bespeak a truly massive in
tellect."

Southern Californians, and that in
cludes the entire population of that
district, as well as the University
thereof, will ever hold a warm spot in
their hearts for "Tricky Dick" or ]
"Romping Richard" as he is some-i
times affectionately dubbed. Ever an
earnest young man, his heaving chest
conceals a heart of gold, and a jest- j
ing spirit that will have its joke. His
merry antics in running behind his !
own goal post in the Alabama game
are still remembered, and the slight- |
est mention is always good for a gale
of laughter. It was just about a year
ago when a nationally circulated
magazine published his now historic
story. You'll probably recall it. The :
title slips the memory just now, but I
it was something about, "How I de-'
feated U.S.C., by Dick Hyland."

Therein, the ever-jesting Richard,
who ever was a modest and unassum
ing youth, told how he rallied his
team, when it was behind, to defeat
the massive Trojans. Painting his
own picture in glowing words, Hyland
told how he dashed to the winning;
touchdown, how the stands arose as 1
one man, and cheered him to the echo, j
how the weak, puny Stanford team
outfought the great Trojan eleven.
Some southern California fans took I
offense at the magic tale. Of course j
Richard meant no offense. His sweet
character was publicly maligned, but |

the offenders were quickly hushed
up. Nothing must occur to spoil the
happy relationships which existed be
tween the King of Jesters, and his
happy subjects.

It seemed that some of the Stanford
men themselves took objection to the
story. Ted Shipkey, Ed Walker, Biff
Hoffman, that great fullback, Eli Post,
Sellman, and the others didn't par
ticularly care to be referred to as
puny. Neither did they want it to
seem that that great, big, dreadful
Trojan team of eleven man-eating
savages had opposed poor little Rich
ard all by himself. They were out
there on that field, most of them more
than Richard was himself, and they
did plenty of work on their own. Then
there was little Mike Murphy, who
actually was the hero of the game.
Jesting Richard, in his own merry
way, hadn't even mentioned Mike. But
then, the Southern California ad
mirers of the one-man Stanford team
couldn't do anything about that.

But one Trojan just wouldn't be
cured. Romping Richard had made
him the villain of his masterpiece,
and Mort Kaer didn't care much about
being a villain. Richard's local ad
mirers tried in vain to point out that
it merely was one of Hyland's his
toric jests that Kaer had been called
"dumb." They said it was one of the
funniest things they ever read, when
Hyland referred to them as a "bunch
of dodoes." The dodo was extinct,
and nobody knew what it meant any
way.

But Kaer just wouldn't get over his
antipathy. It was just two years later
that he considered the score evened.
He had graduated from Southern
California, but that "dumb" idea still
rankled. He tried playing football
with the Olympic Club. Mort didn't
hold any brief against Stanford itself.
But still, every time the big Red team
trotted on the field, he saw the
shadowy figure of Tricky Dick some
where in the mob. And that made him
see more red than there was in all of
the Cardinal sweaters.
Maybe you remember the score.
Anyway, it was 12-G with the Olympic
Club in front, and Kaer manufactured
both of those touchdowns. He con
siders the score even. He wished Hy
land had been 011 the team, but he
wasn't, and Mort did the best he
could to make up for that "dumb" idea.
But of course nothing like that
could happen again. Kaer was some
thing of a radical to take offense at
anything the jesting Richard would
write. So his merry comments in the
local morning paper haven't done
more than give the Trojans a hearty
chuckle. They wish he was on the
Stanford team again, so they could
clasp his hand, clap him on the back,
and thank him for those many, many
kind words. But no doubt, Richard
will be at the field, and he will have
an opportunity to see the Trojans
act just as they would if he were in
there. And, maybe, Richard will be
glad he wasn't.

The Editor, Sir:
My, my! We just will never stop
learning new and interesting things
about this Dick Hyland person. First
he was a Dick Merriwell on the Stan
ford football team. Next, as he re
ported in his own inimitable manner,
he won the Olympic rugby champion
ship single-handed for the United
States. Just about this same time he
blossomed forth as an author. Then
he turned newspaper writer, and once
was discovered in the act of helping
Bill Spaulding coach his University
of California at Los Angeles football
team, without Bill having much to say
about it.

And now, most astounding of all,
he has turned humorist, and is fairly
keeping the citizenry of southern
California holding its sides with his
merry quips and comments in a Los
Angeles morning paper. He puts Dr.
Johnson, Dick Steele, Will Irwin, Ring
Lardner, and Will Rogers in the "dub"
class, so brilliant are his sallies, so
keen are his jests.

And the way he manages to bring
the University of Southern California
into all of his stories has put the Tro
jans in the merriest of moods. His
continual line of smart chatter, so
jolly, so clever, and yet so refined,

thereof, will ever hold a warm spot in
their hearts for "Tricky Dick" or ]
"Romping Richard" as he is some-i
times affectionately dubbed. Ever an
earnest young man, his heaving chest
conceals a heart of gold, and a jest- j
ing spirit that will have its joke. His
merry antics in running behind his !
own goal post in the Alabama game
are still remembered, and the slight- |
est mention is always good for a gale
of laughter. It was just about a year
ago when a nationally circulated
magazine published his now historic
story. You'll probably recall it. The :
title slips the memory just now, but I
it was something about, "How I de-'
feated U.S.C., by Dick Hyland."

Therein, the ever-jesting Richard,
who ever was a modest and unassum
ing youth, told how he rallied his
team, when it was behind, to defeat
the massive Trojans. Painting his
own picture in glowing words, Hyland
told how he dashed to the winning;
touchdown, how the stands arose as 1
one man, and cheered him to the echo, j
how the weak, puny Stanford team
outfought the great Trojan eleven.
Some southern California fans took I
offense at the magic tale. Of course j
Richard meant no offense. His sweet
character was publicly maligned, but |

the offenders were quickly hushed
up. Nothing must occur to spoil the
happy relationships which existed be
tween the King of Jesters, and his
happy subjects.

It seemed that some of the Stanford
men themselves took objection to the
story. Ted Shipkey, Ed Walker, Biff
Hoffman, that great fullback, Eli Post,
Sellman, and the others didn't par
ticularly care to be referred to as
puny. Neither did they want it to
seem that that great, big, dreadful
Trojan team of eleven man-eating
savages had opposed poor little Rich
ard all by himself. They were out
there on that field, most of them more
than Richard was himself, and they
did plenty of work on their own. Then
there was little Mike Murphy, who
actually was the hero of the game.
Jesting Richard, in his own merry
way, hadn't even mentioned Mike. But
then, the Southern California ad
mirers of the one-man Stanford team
couldn't do anything about that.

But one Trojan just wouldn't be
cured. Romping Richard had made
him the villain of his masterpiece,
and Mort Kaer didn't care much about
being a villain. Richard's local ad
mirers tried in vain to point out that
it merely was one of Hyland's his
toric jests that Kaer had been called
"dumb." They said it was one of the
funniest things they ever read, when
Hyland referred to them as a "bunch
of dodoes." The dodo was extinct,
and nobody knew what it meant any
way.

But Kaer just wouldn't get over his
antipathy. It was just two years later
that he considered the score evened.
He had graduated from Southern
California, but that "dumb" idea still
rankled. He tried playing football
with the Olympic Club. Mort didn't
hold any brief against Stanford itself.
But still, every time the big Red team
trotted on the field, he saw the
shadowy figure of Tricky Dick some
where in the mob. And that made him
see more red than there was in all of
the Cardinal sweaters.
Maybe you remember the score.
Anyway, it was 12-G with the Olympic
Club in front, and Kaer manufactured
both of those touchdowns. He con
siders the score even. He wished Hy
land had been 011 the team, but he
wasn't, and Mort did the best he
could to make up for that "dumb" idea.
But of course nothing like that
could happen again. Kaer was some
thing of a radical to take offense at
anything the jesting Richard would
write. So his merry comments in the
local morning paper haven't done
more than give the Trojans a hearty
chuckle. They wish he was on the
Stanford team again, so they could
clasp his hand, clap him on the back,
and thank him for those many, many
kind words. But no doubt, Richard
will be at the field, and he will have
an opportunity to see the Trojans
act just as they would if he were in
there. And, maybe, Richard will be
glad he wasn't.
