"THE PLAY'S THE THING"
At The New Capitol
Guy Bates Post, whose name is a
i synonym for fine acting, is back in
San Francisco after five years' ab
sence. He has chosen what he con
siders to be Molnar's cleverest play,
and the novelty and subtlety of this
comedy is delighting the most dis
criminating. Here is a play every stu
dent will enjoy hugely—it appeals to
the intelligence and to the funny
bone, a rare Combination.
Beginning in a most informal and
original way, "The Play's the Thing"
attracts particularly because of its in
dividual method of telling a story.
There are only half a dozen principal
characters, and the one woman in the
cast does not appear until the second
act is well under way.
Interesting Plot
An overheard conversation moti
vates the plot. Inasmuch as the suc
cess of a big operetta depends upon a
reconciliation of what is accidentally
overheard with the young lover's faith
in the prima donna, you can imagine
that there is considerable explaining
to do. Especially in this instance, for
the supposedly innocent lady is
caught talking to a former flame in
her bedroom at two o'clock in the
morning. The conversation leaves lit
tle to the imagination, and if the audi
ence was shocked —-imagine how the
lady's fiancee felt.
But no shootings occur, for Mr. Post,
as a diplomatic playwright, exerts his
skill to rescue the foolhardy couple
who held the tete-a-tote, and con
vinces the young lover that the ex
tremely indiscreet and suspicious con
versation was perfectly guiltless.
Acting Splendid
The acting in this play is of the
highest order —and Mr. Post is a star
ot the first rank. If you like Ethel
Barrymore, Jano Cowl, and Pauline
Frederick, then you'll appreciate an
equally good performer.

Lionel Belmore heads a remarkably
well-chosen supporting cast. The lead
ing lady is not beautiful, but she has
a quivery voice which sounds like a
prima donna should. One set is used
for all three acts; it is handsome.
This is the first successful play

that the New Capitol has housed in
some years. The theatre is not really
new, but it has been completely reno
vated and looks very nice.

There are now seven legitimate
theatres in the city, all of them but
the Columbia being open right at this
time. We never recall seeing so many
good plays on at the same time. Very
highly recommended —"The Play's the
Thing" (Capitol), "The Royal Fam
ily" (Geary), "Good News" (Curran),
and "Daddies" (President). The other
current attractions are "Antonia"
(Alcazar), and "Easy for Zee Zee"
(Green Street).
