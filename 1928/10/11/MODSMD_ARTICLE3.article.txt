# SOUSA PLAYS HERE ON EVE OF ELECTION
## America's Finest Conductor Of Martial Music Will Bring Large Band 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
November 6, the date of the second
of the A.S.S.U. Concert Series, prom
ises to be an exciting night on the
campus. As it is election night, the
excitement will be centered in the re
turns which will be coming in from
the entire United States. It is par
ticularly fitting that the artist ap
pearing at Stanford that night will be
one of the country's greatest Ameri
cans, John Philip Sousa.
Sousa's is an expression of the
patriotism which people feel for their
country on certain occasions, and it
is peculiarly appropriate that he will
be on the campus to express some of
the enthusiasm which will be felt on
election night.
American Band
The "March King" has always been
exceptionally proud that his band was
entirely American. At one time he
said: "The band is practically one
hundred per cent American and any
foreigner in our personnel is fully
imbued with the American spirit. That
is one reason why I am so proud of
my band. It is American in every way,
and without egotism I have no hesi
tancy in asserting that it is the best
in the world.
"The repertoire is most extensive
and the band can play anything that
may set before the men —and on
sight. America has just cause to be
proud of these fine musicians and
citizens."
