An international basket dinner was
recently held at Brockville, Ontario,
by the Odd Fellows and members of
a Samaritan order.
The Good Samaritans, we presume,
picked up the Odd Fellows afterward.
The result of a tryoutee'a head

J. Calvao, Brazilian engineer, w,ill
lead an expedition this month to the
unexplored plateaus of central Brazil.
Indisputable proof that "That's My

.... and above all, he is a
Man! I have faith that the Uni
versity of Southern California
shall continue the use of the good
judgment that she has in the past.
Let us cheer for the Stanford
man. Who knows but that some

breast."

"Hope springs internal 'neath the

A battleship which will run without
a single man on board has been in

As far as the Pacific Fleet is con-

cerned, this will undoubtedly elimi

A man falling from a plane will
never travel more than 118 miles an
hour, army experts say.
This will be a distinct releif to stu

(Nevertheless, oh, what a fall was
there, countrymen!)
The height of obscurity, we assert,
