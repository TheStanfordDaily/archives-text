# FROSH LOOK BAD IN PRACTICE TILT WITH 2ND TEAM
## 
### 
Looking as if they had lost all
traces of the Are and power that have
enabled them to pile up 89 points
against their opponents' six in three
starts, the freshman tirst-string foot
ball team tried with but little success
to gain through the second team yes
terday in an extended scrimmage.
There was little consolation in the
play of the second string in stopping
the first, for the scrubs as a whole
did not look extra good.

About the only explanation to that
may be made for the decidedly unim
pressive play of the yearlings in yes
terday's practice session is that after
the past several weeks of intensive
work a let-down has come.

With their game with the Pasadena
Junior College next Saturday in the
Stadium preceding the varsity con
test with U.C.L.A. to look forward to,
the freshmen will probably speed up
in practice today and get back into
their old form, which, by the way, is
par excellent.
Dusty Allen, regular fullback, was
on the sick list yesterday and didn't
show up for practice, Cadell taking
his place in the scrimmage. Cadell,
who went in at halfback in the second
half of the Santa Clara game last
week, looks like excellent varsity ma
terial. Getting clear on one play he
made a beautiful end run for a gain
of more than thirty yards. He is fast
and appears to be able to use his
speed to good advantage.

In its first important game of the
year last Saturday the Pasadena Jun
ior College team was beaten 26 to 0
by the Southern California frosh.
Comparative scores usually mean lit
tle, but for those who care to, the
respective strength of the Stanford
and U.S.C. freshman teams may be
estimated following next Saturday's
game.
