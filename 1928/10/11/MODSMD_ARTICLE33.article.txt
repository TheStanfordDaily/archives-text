# SCHOOL RECEIVES STUDENTS AFTER ISLAND CYCLONE
## 
### 
Although its scarred and badly dam
aged buildings are roofless, and its
laboratories and libraries virtually de
stroyed, the University of Porto Rico
reopened its doors Monday to receive
an unfortunately diminished number
of the 1200 students enrolled before
the cyclone wrought havoc to the is
land two weeks ago. This information
was received by Mrs. Alice Park of
Cll Gilruan street from Senora Muna
Munoz Marin, a professor at that in
stitution.
The famed buildings and campus of
the Caribbean school are declared to

be in even worse distress than that
of Stanford following the earthquake
of 1906. The law library is under sev
eral feet of water. Stately palms and
mangos have been torn from their
roots. Trash and litter form a deep
layer over the beautiful tropical gar
dens.

Many students who enrolled at the
beginning of the fall term will be un
able to return. They have found their
family homes destroyed and their
family fortunes are represented in to
bacco, coffee, or citrus fruits literally
blown away. It is feared that many
will never be able to enroll in the
university again because of the eco
nomic shadow into which Porto Rico
has been plunged.

Some idea of the force of the storm
may be gathered from the fact that
57 per cent of the homes were de
stroyed, 27 per cent unroofed, and but
16 per cent escaped with minor dam
ages.

The university students and faculty
immediately took up the work of re
lief. The Home Economics prepared
food and clothing for refugees. The
student cadets served on active guard
duty. Many of the faculty have taken
over positions as local administrators
until the crisis passes.
