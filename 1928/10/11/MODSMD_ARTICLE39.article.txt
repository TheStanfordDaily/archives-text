# NEW BASKETBALL RULES TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON WESTERN GAME SAYS HUNT
## 
### WHITNEY WRIGHT 
"The new basketball rules for 1928-
29 will have very little effect on the
game, particularly the way it is
played in the western states," de
clared Coach "Husky" Hunt, Cardinal
cage mentor, in commenting yesterday
on the new regulations which were
announced last Monday.
A new clause (Rule 15, Section 9,
under the head of personal fouls)
reads:
"A player shall not hold, trip,
charge, or push an opponent whether
| or not either player has possession
of the ball. If a dribbler charges into
an opponent, or makes personal con
tact with an opponent, without an
apparent effort to avoid such contact,
a personal foul shall be called on the
i dribbler.
"if, despite the dribbler's effort to
j avoid contact, personal contact en
! sues, either player, or both, may be
! guilty; but the greater responsibility
j is on the dribbler if he tries to dribble
by an opponent who is in his path."
This clause is the result of over a
year's controversy on the elimination
' of the dribble. At the meeting of the
rules committee in 1927 a motion was
passed under the instigation of a fac
tion of coaches, headed by Meanwell
of Wisconsin, restricting the dribble
to a single bounce.
Storm of Protest
The motion raised a storm of pro
test from coaches in all parts of the
country, particularly on the Pacific
Coast, and it was decided to rescind
the rule and put the dribble back for
one year's trial. According to Coach
Hunt, the new clause is an effort to
appease the faction opposing the drib
ble, although it really is aimed more
at the pivot than the dribble itself.
"I do not think that the dribble will
ever be completely eliminated," says
Hunt. "Since it adds so much excite
ment to the game and is very essen
tial to the players when near their
opponents' goal or in getting out of
tight places.
"The new ruling, however, will
make it much harder for the players
to pivot, since it is in the pivot that
the greatest amount of personal con
tact is found. Because of the fact that
the pivot is not used nearly as much
by coaches on the Pacific Coast as by
basketball mentors in eastern col
leges, very little change will be no
ticeable in the game as it is played
here."
Other Changes
Other changes provided in the new
regulations penalize guarding from
the rear with a personal foul; make
it illegal for a player to capitalize
his great height by tapping the ball
and then catching it on two succes

sive jump balls; make it clear that a
ball striking an official does not be
come a dead ball; and declare that
an unguarded player may hold the
ball indefinitely in the court, but as
soon as an opponent takes a position
close by the player with the ball, the
latter must get it into play. These
changes are all minor.
