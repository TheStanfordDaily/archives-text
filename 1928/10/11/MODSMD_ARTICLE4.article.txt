# DANCE FOLLOWS PRESENTATION OF SHERWOOD PLAY
## 
### 
Following the performance of "The
Queen's Husband" Friday night there
will be a cast dance in the Women's
Clubhouse. The Brooks-Worthington
orchestra will furnish the music.

This is the first dance to be held
in the Clubhouse since it has been
renovated. Dean M#-y Yost stated yes
terday that "many thanks are due to
the generous alumni and faculty wives
who have contributed to the work."

The worn-out stairway is now tiled.
The walls have been done over in
beige, and bracket and table lamps
have been installed.

Carpets, new divans, tables, and up
holstered chairs constitute the room's
furnishings. Agen curtains for the
windows have been hung. They are
made of a beige and burnt orange
scotch plaid that carries out the har
mony of the color scheme.
One of the features is the glass
door partition which divides one room
from another. However it may be
folded up when large affairs are held.
There are two new fireplaces, and a
painting has been contributed.
