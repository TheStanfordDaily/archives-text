# SPORTS OF 1928
## The 						Mechanical Rabbit 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
It's a far cry from the hustling
Braves of 1914 to the clowning Cardi
nals of 1928, yet Rabbit Maranville,
star shortstop of Stallings' miracle
team of fourteen years ago, has just
taken part in the classic between the
Yanks and the Cardinals. To see Mr.
Rabbit tearing to his right to make
a one-handed catch at the left-field
boxes off Hoyt's high foul in the first
game of the current world series,
you'd never believe that he is 36 years
old, and has been playing professional
baseball for eighteen seasons.
For years the "flowing bowl" and
the Rabbit were not exactly strangers,
as he readily will admit. He was the
playboy of the majors, fairly dripping
with color, and such a natural-born
comedian that he not only had the
fans in roars of laughter, but was
fairly successful on the vaudeville

stage paired with Tommy Griffith. One
of the "cut-up's" stunts was, having
arrived safely on first, to dart sud
ian of the initial sack. If that gentle
denly between the legs of the guard
man happened to be tall this was an
easy matter, as the Rabbit is a mere
5 feet, 5 inches.
But after clowning in and out of
the big leagues, the Rabbit suddenly
turned over a new leaf —on May 18th,
1927, to be exact —and he's been lead
ing a sedate life ever since. Walking
the straight and narrow path enabled
him to get one more chance at the
base paths in the National League,
i He helped the Cards at the end of
last season, and now he has been re
warded for helping them all through
out the season of 1928. Maranville
made four hits in the four-game series
won by the Braves in 1914.
