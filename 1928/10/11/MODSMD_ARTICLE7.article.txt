# AN OPEN LETTER FROM THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
## 
### 
To tiie Associated Students :
This is an open letter from the Executive Committee to the Stan
ford Daily calling the attention of the students to .the situation in the
halls concerning the telephones. For some time past there has been a
continuous, deliberate amount of cheating on the part of the telephone
users regarding long distance calls —such things as buttons and slugs
are constantly found in the phones, and many times a call is made and
the caller evades payment. The telephone company eventually lost
patience and threatened to remove all phones; this action was averted
only a by guarantee on the part of each club for a definite sum each
quarter. Any deficit on this guarantee must be taken care of by the
club; and since to date the deficits have reached between one and two
hundred dollars a quarter, it is only a question of time until, under
such a condition, the club will refuse a guarantee and the phones will
be taken out.

Considering these facts, the Executive Committee adopted a reso
lution condemning the practice of defrauding the telephone company,
requiring anyone found so doing to appear before the Men's Council,
and pointing out that a continuance of these actions in the future will
result in the removal of all phones from the halls.
Respectfully,
John B. Wheatley
