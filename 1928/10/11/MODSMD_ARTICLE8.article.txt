# CAVALERO, PECK ADDRESS FRESHMEN ON TRADITIONS AT CLUB'S MEETING
## 
### 
Nominations for Encina Club offi
cers were made last night after a
meeting in the hall at which Phil
Cavalero, A.S.S.U. president, and
Templeton Peck, head sponsor, talked
of Stanford traditions and the disci
plinary organization of Encina. Yells
and songs were practiced under the
leadership of Scott Webster and his
two assistants.

After the nominations were made
the time of the election was set for
tonight from 6:30 to 8:30 o'clock. Any
correction to the list of nominees
given below should be left in Room
215, Encina, before 8 o'clock so that
the ballots may be printed.

Speaking of the Honor System of
the University, Cavalero said that if
everyone would start tapping on his
desk when any cheating is observed,
the honor spirit would be preserved
without recourse to the much-despised
"tattling." He also gave an outline of
the few remaining traditions.

As head sponsor, Peck told the
freshmen that they were expected to
attend the matriculation services in
the Chapel next Sunday in a body.

The entire class will meet at the
Little Theatre at 10:30 o'clock in
order to march into the Chapel.
Dave Jacobson, chairman of the
Rally Committee, outlined plans for
the bonfire which the freshmen are
to build. Plans call for a pyre thirty
feet square and fifty feet in height
this year.
