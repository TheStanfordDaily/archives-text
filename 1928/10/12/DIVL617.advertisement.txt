MIGHT SAY THIS
THOi HEATH SUIT
IS II AT HER. GOOD..
It is tailored of British woolens in several attractive
colors....the needlework follows the Thos. Heath
tradition of much personal supervision, handwork
and endless fussing with details....the styling is, of
course, unquestionable....the air of distinction
is unmistakable....this is, indeed a
rather good suit.
