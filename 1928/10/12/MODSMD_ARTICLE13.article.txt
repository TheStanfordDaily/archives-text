# FORMER CARD GRID MEN ARE BROTHERS OF BRUIN HALFBACK
## 
### 
Playing against Stanford this
Saturday should seem strange to
Ted Dennis, Bruin reserve half
back.
Ted, younger brother of the
well-known Guy and Roy who
formerly played on Stanford
teams, was brought up to revere
all work done by the Sons of
the Stanford Red. He fooled his
brothers, however, by matricu
lating at U.C.L.A., where he is
now a sophomore.
Guy Dennis, eldest brother,
was freshman football captain
for the Cards in 1921 and played
varsity half in '22 and '23. He
was short and a very hard-hitting
back, but he played himself out
in the first two years and was
unable to play in '24. Roy played
fine freshman football and bas
ketball, but developed knee trou
ble and never returned for var
sity.
