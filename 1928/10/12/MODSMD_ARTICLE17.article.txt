# DAILY SCHEDULES EDITORIAL STAFF TRYOUTS MONDAY
## Work Is Open to Everyone; Freshmen Particularly Asked to Report 
### 
Tryouts for the editorial staff of
; the Stanford Daily will open with a
meeting Monday afternoon at 1
o'clock in the Daily office next to the
j Press Building. Trials are open to
j everyone interested in journalistic
! work, but freshmen particularly are
j asked to report at this time.
Work will consist of covering regu-
I lar beats, rewriting stories, and proof
reading. No experience in high school
I or junior college journalism is neces
sary. This is an opportunity for men
and women intending to enter jour
nalism later on, since the Daily is
i conducted on the lines of a city paper
and affords real training.
Promotions on the staff will be
made on the basis of the quality of
j the work done, alertness in covering
i beats, and hours spent assisting in
1 the office. A tryoutee who is taken
i on the staff as a reporter has a num
ber of steps before him; from copy
editor to night editor, in charge of one
| paper a week, to managing and asso
ciate editors, and finally to Editor
and Women's EJditor.
Close touch with student activities
and administration of the University
is kept on the Daily, and work on the
i staff holds real interest because it
allows tryoutees to become better ac
quainted with the working of the Uni
! versity.
