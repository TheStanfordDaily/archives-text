# BEAR GRID SQUAD WORKS OUT FOR TILT WITH W.S.C.
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 11. (/P)â€”With
yesterday's light workout behind them
the first team of the University of
California grid squad prepared today
to indulge in a heavy scrimmage,
probably its last heavy workout be
fore their conference game Saturday
with the Washington State College
eleven.
Yesterday the student body had its
first chance to see the team in prac
tice, when the gates of the Memorial
Stadium were thrown open for the
annual "Bleacher Rally." The under
graduates were treated to the sight of
a brand-new second-string backfleld
in action when the subs were lined
up against the third team for the
scrimmage that was the feature of the
practice.
The new combination comprised
Dennis at quarterback, Rice and
Seeley at halves, and Garrity at full
back. Indications were that Coach
"Nibs" Price may give this quartet a
chance to flash against Washington
State College Saturday if the varsity
backfleld runs up a comfortable lead
in the early stages of the game.
