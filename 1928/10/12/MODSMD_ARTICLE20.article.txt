# STANFORD WELCOMES U.C.L.A. ELEVEN TO COAST CONFERENCE
## Cardinals Conceded Certain Victory in Tilt With Bruins; Coach Spaulding Concentrates on Defense in Expectation of Aerial Attack 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
A TEMPORARILY re-organized Stanford varsity will be lined up on the
Stadium turf tomorrow afternoon to act as hosts to the unconquered
U.C.L.A. Bruin, little brother of the Coast Conference, when it makes its debut
as a member of the "big time."
â€¢ Lud Fentrup, Joe Bush and Ray Tandy will be filling the places left vacant
by the leg injuries of Frank Wilton and Spud Harder, and the sickness of
Corwin Artman. The remainder of the starting eleven will be the same as

>tliat which opened against the Oregon
Webfooters last Saturday at Eugene.
Injuries Hit Bruins
The Gold and Blue squad has also been
hit with injuries, much to the grief of
j the Los Angeles rooters, for both of the
{men on the sick list, Captain Joe Flem
ing and Jerry Russom, are of the first
string backfield, and are considered the
big guns of the Bruin offense. Fleming
scored the touchdown that tied Arizona
7-7 two weeks ago, and in doing so
! cracked a rib. Late reports from Los
! Angeles indicate that neither of these
i two men have recovered sufficiently to
] get into the fray tomorrow, although
| their names appear on the announced
lineup.
Both teams have been stressing their
aerial attacks this week. Because of hav
ing a much lighter team, Coach Bill
Spaulding will probably depend
on the overhead attack for ground gains.
The Bruin line has shown up well in the
first three games, but has been heavier
than any on the opposing forward walls.
Stanford's backfield also shows a great
margin of weight over the Bruin backs.
Cards Favored
Not even the most optimistic rooter
from the South expects his team to win.
Looking matters squarely in the face,
"U.C.L.A. realizes that its christening
in the big league looks forboding" and
Bill Spaulding has drilled his team in
defensive play to stave off excessive scor
ing on the part of the Card eleven. To
hold Stanford down to a conservative
score, worthy of a Conference team, will
be their intention. Sport scribes who
have seen both teams in action are will
ing to prophecy a Stanford victory by a
margin of three touchdowns at the least.
The U.C.L.A. squad will arrive in
San Jose this morning and expects to
come up to the Farm for a light workout
on the local field early this afternoon.
From three to five hundred rooters will
l>e here to cheer the U.C.L.A. team, most
of whom will arrive tomorrow morning.
