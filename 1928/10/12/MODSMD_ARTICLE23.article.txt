						Forward Step for the Women

Members of Women's Conference are now working on a piece of
legislation which is destined, if passed, to be quite constructive, as
Women's Conference legislation goes. The proposal is, in brief, that
late (i.e., 1:30 o'clock) leaves granted for week nights are to be got auto
matically instead of through a member of the Women's Council. Under
the new scheme, a woman wanting late leave to work on a publication,
or to attend a dramatics rehearsal, simply signs out on the house or
dormitory roster. She is allowed so many of these leaves per quarter,
according to her class in the University. Every month the Council is to
check up on these grantings of late leave and see that no woman is
exceeding her supply thereof.
The above proposition is regarded by women leaders as a step for
ward in the march toward greater freedom in women's affairs. While it
has not yet been passed by Conference, having been tabled pending dis
cussion in the living groups, it would be, even if put into effect, merely
a trial arrangement to operate for the quarter only, in order that it might
be seen how effectively it worked.
Whereas the women perhaps will have advanced in freeing themselves
of regulations for getting leave, they were at their meeting obliged, as a
result of protest, to insist that 110 leave be granted on week nights for
going to San Francisco, except for the purpose of attending such Laud
able entertainments as operas and concerts.
Stanford women are to be congratulated for the attitude they have
token in their determination to throw off the yoke of what they consider
outworn rules. They are going about the business, not 411 a rebellious, but
in a patient spirit, which will get them farther because it will impress the
President and Dean Yost with their responsibility and worthiness of
having fewer restrictions.
