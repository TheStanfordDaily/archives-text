# Holt's Appointment Objected To
## 
### 
A writer in Campus Opinion objects to the appointment of Richard
Holt to the Men's Council, using as a basis the fact that the appointee
is manager of Chaparral and president of the Senior Class. These are
enough jobs, he argues, for any one man; why, therefore, did the Execu
tive Committee not appoint another, ideally one of those men who were
defeated for the Men's Council in the elections last spring.
While the Daily does not support or deny Holt's right, as against
anyone else's, to be on the Council, it does point out the fallacy of argu
ing for the appointment of one of the defeated candidates of the last
election. By being defeated for an office, a man is automatically elimi
nated from further consideration for it, because the majority has ex
pressed its disapproval of him. That is to say, he is eliminated until such
time as he may again run in a popular vote.
Since Holt was not in the Men's Council race last spring, he qualifies
for his appointment in at least this one respect.
