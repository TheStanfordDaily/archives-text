WHAT OF THE
STANFORD MAN?
Since first it was announced that in |
the course of time freshmen and sopho- 1
mores would no longer come to the farm,
discussion has been rife among alumni
and undergraduates as to the merits of
the plan. Discussion continues. One ;
problem that presents itself, aside from :
those concerning athletics, fraternities, ,
sororities, and other extra-curricular ac- ■
tivities, is what affect this change will
have on the Stanford man of the future, j
What of the Stanford man? Will lie;
have the democratic spirit, the loyalty,
and the sense of honor and gentlemanli- j
ncss that arc accredited to the Stanford
man of today and the past?
Coming to Stanford at the average age
of eighteen, the freshman is at an im
pressionable time in his life. He is enter- !
ing a great University. Its breadth and :
depth appeal to him. its ideals are pre- j
scntcd to him and he accepts them. The !
older classmen by example further im- I
press these ideals upon him. lie absorbs i
the Stanford spirit.
The upper division man, transfcring |

from another institution comcs to Stan
! ford two years more mature, less im
pressionable, and with definite set ideas
of college. Being less plastic, he cannot
be influenced as deeply by Stanford ideals
as can the freshman. Should he have
been unfortunate enough to have been in
an institution where there was no honor
spirit, where there existed a conHict be
tween faculty and students to sec who
could outwit the other regardless of
means, where the high ideals of Stanford
were lacking, he cannot come here and be
equal in character to the man who has
been here two years.
Mutterings have l>een heard about the
decline of the honor system. President
Wilbur himself stated that it has started
creaking. Is there any connection be
tween this tottering of our finest tra
dition and the influx of third year men?
Tn the last analysis, will the Stanford
spirit take a beating? Will many of the
ideals of the Farm be lost by this ever
increasing influx of older, less malleable,
less plastic men? Will it still mean as
much then, as it docs now, to say of a
man, he is a Stanford man?

WHAT OF THE
STANFORD MAN?
Since first it was announced that in |
the course of time freshmen and sopho- 1
mores would no longer come to the farm,
discussion has been rife among alumni
and undergraduates as to the merits of
the plan. Discussion continues. One ;
problem that presents itself, aside from :
those concerning athletics, fraternities, ,
sororities, and other extra-curricular ac- ■
tivities, is what affect this change will
have on the Stanford man of the future, j
What of the Stanford man? Will lie;
have the democratic spirit, the loyalty,
and the sense of honor and gentlemanli- j
ncss that arc accredited to the Stanford
man of today and the past?
Coming to Stanford at the average age
of eighteen, the freshman is at an im
pressionable time in his life. He is enter- !
ing a great University. Its breadth and :
depth appeal to him. its ideals are pre- j
scntcd to him and he accepts them. The !
older classmen by example further im- I
press these ideals upon him. lie absorbs i
the Stanford spirit.
The upper division man, transfcring |

from another institution comcs to Stan
! ford two years more mature, less im
pressionable, and with definite set ideas
of college. Being less plastic, he cannot
be influenced as deeply by Stanford ideals
as can the freshman. Should he have
been unfortunate enough to have been in
an institution where there was no honor
spirit, where there existed a conHict be
tween faculty and students to sec who
could outwit the other regardless of
means, where the high ideals of Stanford
were lacking, he cannot come here and be
equal in character to the man who has
been here two years.
Mutterings have l>een heard about the
decline of the honor system. President
Wilbur himself stated that it has started
creaking. Is there any connection be
tween this tottering of our finest tra
dition and the influx of third year men?
Tn the last analysis, will the Stanford
spirit take a beating? Will many of the
ideals of the Farm be lost by this ever
increasing influx of older, less malleable,
less plastic men? Will it still mean as
much then, as it docs now, to say of a
man, he is a Stanford man?
