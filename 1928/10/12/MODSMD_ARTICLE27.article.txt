The Editor, Sir:
In the following, I wish to express
some opinion in connection, with the
address given by a Japanese leader, Mr.
Tsurumi, Tuesday evening in the Gen
eral Assembly Hall, Stanford University.

In his speech, the speaker had given
a vivid description about the recent de
velopment of Japan and particularly em
phasized the point that Japan is becoming
more and more Americanized and her
attitude is becoming more and more lib
eral and progressive in almost every re
spect of her national activities. As a
neighbor and friend of Japan, I feel
really proud and happy to hear such a
kind of report.

Concerning the Japanese policy toward
China, the speaker boldly said that Japan,
during the last few years, has displaced
her old policy by a very liberal and
friendly principle of "non-interference"
in the domestic affairs of China. To this
assertion 1 am very sorry to say that Mr.
Tsurumi had been really a little too care
less if not purposely trying to throw dust
into the eyes of the world. In order to
prove the fact, it is needless to go back
too far to the Japanese seizure of Korea,
the most notorious "twenty-one de
mands" and any other spoils of plunder
ing and invasions on the part of Japan.
The recent Tsinan Incident and her pres
ent attempt to prevent the unification
of China by keeping Manchuria from
joining the National government are
enough to show the difference between
Japan's old aggressive policy and her
present friendly "liberalism" and non-in
terference concerning the domestic affairs
of the latter.

When the nationalists or the revolu
tionary army had succeeded in crushing
the conservative self-seeking militarists
one after another and had reached almost
the very heart of Shantung province, the
cradle of Chinese civilization, the Japan
ese Government, in spite of the protests
of the Chinese Government, forcibly des
patched thousands of soldiers to Tsinan,
which is neither a concession nor a for
eign settlement but the capital of Shan
tung, under the pretext of protecting the
Japanese residents there. They declared
about three-fourths of the city as the
protective area and within that area not a
single Chinese soldier was allowed to
enter. This naturally led to constant con
flicts and as a result, more than two
thousand Chinese soldiers and civilians
were killed, the city bombarded. What is
most terrible is that the Chinese Com
missioner for foreign affairs, Mr. Tsai
Kung-Shih, was killed after the Japanese
had satisfactorily displayed their cruelty
by cutting off his nose and ears. A few
days after the incident, Japan sent more
troops to Tsingtao and seized the Kio
chow-Tsinan Railroad, which lies
straight across the Shantung province.
Since that time Japan has been practicing
a reign of terror in the area—Chinese na

tional flag is not allowed to hoist within
that province; press and private letters
are to be inspected and censored if they
desire before delivery; private houses and
public organizations such as Y.M.C.A.
are constantly searched ; women and girls
are ill-treated. All this, and even Chinese
patients and wounded soldiers are not
safe in hospitals.

Just a few weeks ago the young gen
eral Chang Hsio-liang of Manchuria, see
ing that further civil wars would paralyze
the nation, decided to join hands with the
Central government. Here the Japanese
"liberal and friendly policy" intruded into
the entanglement by sending to the Yuong
general a series of warnings and formal
notifications.

All these instances show clearly what
kind of policy Japan has been practicing
in China. I sincerely hope that Mr. Tsur
umi will put more effort to effect his gov
ernment to withdraw the Japanese troops
from Shantung and to stop these ridicu
lous diplomatic practices so as to bring
the "Japanese Liberalism" both in theory
and practice into realization.

The Editor, Sir:
In looking over today's Daily I notice
that Dick Holt was chosen to fill a va
cancy in the Men's Council. The article
goes on to mention that Mr. Holt is
president of the senior class and business
manager of Chaparral. Which is all well
and good,—but, why do the same fel
lows have to be picked for all the offices ?
Aren't there enough good fellows here
at Stanford- Why couldn't some of the
candidates who ran for the office have
been appointed? On the other hand, the
reason why Holt was chosen is obvious
when you read further down and see who
was present at that particular meeting.
Might it not perhaps be better to call
special elections to fill such vacancies as
these, rather than leave it up to the
executive committee?

Welcoming the announcement in the
Daily that the seat sale for "The Queen's
Husband" would be held at the Woman's
Clubhouse, I hastened to the aforesaid
place at 1 o'clock. Although I was not
the first person, I had hopes of obtaining
good seats, sincc there were but eleven
(11) persons ahead of me. I was told
however, that the best seats had already
been sold, and I had to be contented with j
seats in the fifteenth (15th) row.
Am I to believe that those 11 persons j
bought out the first fifteen rows? How i
about it, Dramatic Council or what have 1
you?

Welcoming the announcement in the
Daily that the seat sale for "The Queen's
Husband" would be held at the Woman's
Clubhouse, I hastened to the aforesaid
place at 1 o'clock. Although I was not
the first person, I had hopes of obtaining
good seats, sincc there were but eleven
(11) persons ahead of me. I was told
however, that the best seats had already
been sold, and I had to be contented with j
seats in the fifteenth (15th) row.
Am I to believe that those 11 persons j
bought out the first fifteen rows? How i
about it, Dramatic Council or what have 1

The Editor, Sir:
In the following, I wish to express
some opinion in connection, with the
address given by a Japanese leader, Mr.
Tsurumi, Tuesday evening in the Gen
eral Assembly Hall, Stanford University.

In his speech, the speaker had given
a vivid description about the recent de
velopment of Japan and particularly em
phasized the point that Japan is becoming
more and more Americanized and her
attitude is becoming more and more lib
eral and progressive in almost every re
spect of her national activities. As a
neighbor and friend of Japan, I feel
really proud and happy to hear such a
kind of report.

Concerning the Japanese policy toward
China, the speaker boldly said that Japan,
during the last few years, has displaced
her old policy by a very liberal and
friendly principle of "non-interference"
in the domestic affairs of China. To this
assertion 1 am very sorry to say that Mr.
Tsurumi had been really a little too care
less if not purposely trying to throw dust
into the eyes of the world. In order to
prove the fact, it is needless to go back
too far to the Japanese seizure of Korea,
the most notorious "twenty-one de
mands" and any other spoils of plunder
ing and invasions on the part of Japan.
The recent Tsinan Incident and her pres
ent attempt to prevent the unification
of China by keeping Manchuria from
joining the National government are
enough to show the difference between
Japan's old aggressive policy and her
present friendly "liberalism" and non-in
terference concerning the domestic affairs
of the latter.

When the nationalists or the revolu
tionary army had succeeded in crushing
the conservative self-seeking militarists
one after another and had reached almost
the very heart of Shantung province, the
cradle of Chinese civilization, the Japan
ese Government, in spite of the protests
of the Chinese Government, forcibly des
patched thousands of soldiers to Tsinan,
which is neither a concession nor a for
eign settlement but the capital of Shan
tung, under the pretext of protecting the
Japanese residents there. They declared
about three-fourths of the city as the
protective area and within that area not a
single Chinese soldier was allowed to
enter. This naturally led to constant con
flicts and as a result, more than two
thousand Chinese soldiers and civilians
were killed, the city bombarded. What is
most terrible is that the Chinese Com
missioner for foreign affairs, Mr. Tsai
Kung-Shih, was killed after the Japanese
had satisfactorily displayed their cruelty
by cutting off his nose and ears. A few
days after the incident, Japan sent more
troops to Tsingtao and seized the Kio
chow-Tsinan Railroad, which lies
straight across the Shantung province.
Since that time Japan has been practicing
a reign of terror in the area—Chinese na

tional flag is not allowed to hoist within
that province; press and private letters
are to be inspected and censored if they
desire before delivery; private houses and
public organizations such as Y.M.C.A.
are constantly searched ; women and girls
are ill-treated. All this, and even Chinese
patients and wounded soldiers are not
safe in hospitals.

Just a few weeks ago the young gen
eral Chang Hsio-liang of Manchuria, see
ing that further civil wars would paralyze
the nation, decided to join hands with the
Central government. Here the Japanese
"liberal and friendly policy" intruded into
the entanglement by sending to the Yuong
general a series of warnings and formal
notifications.

All these instances show clearly what
kind of policy Japan has been practicing
in China. I sincerely hope that Mr. Tsur
umi will put more effort to effect his gov
ernment to withdraw the Japanese troops
from Shantung and to stop these ridicu
lous diplomatic practices so as to bring
the "Japanese Liberalism" both in theory
and practice into realization.
Respectfully yours,

In looking over today's Daily I notice
that Dick Holt was chosen to fill a va
cancy in the Men's Council. The article
goes on to mention that Mr. Holt is
president of the senior class and business
manager of Chaparral. Which is all well
and good,—but, why do the same fel
lows have to be picked for all the offices ?
Aren't there enough good fellows here
at Stanford- Why couldn't some of the
candidates who ran for the office have
been appointed? On the other hand, the
reason why Holt was chosen is obvious
when you read further down and see who
was present at that particular meeting.
Might it not perhaps be better to call
special elections to fill such vacancies as
these, rather than leave it up to the
executive committee?

In looking over today's Daily I notice
that Dick Holt was chosen to fill a va
cancy in the Men's Council. The article
goes on to mention that Mr. Holt is
president of the senior class and business
manager of Chaparral. Which is all well
and good,—but, why do the same fel
lows have to be picked for all the offices ?
Aren't there enough good fellows here
at Stanford- Why couldn't some of the
candidates who ran for the office have
been appointed? On the other hand, the
reason why Holt was chosen is obvious
when you read further down and see who
was present at that particular meeting.
Might it not perhaps be better to call
special elections to fill such vacancies as
these, rather than leave it up to the
executive committee?
Yours for a fairer distribution of offices

Welcoming the announcement in the
Daily that the seat sale for "The Queen's
Husband" would be held at the Woman's
Clubhouse, I hastened to the aforesaid
place at 1 o'clock. Although I was not
the first person, I had hopes of obtaining
good seats, sincc there were but eleven
(11) persons ahead of me. I was told
however, that the best seats had already
been sold, and I had to be contented with j
seats in the fifteenth (15th) row.
Am I to believe that those 11 persons j
bought out the first fifteen rows? How i
about it, Dramatic Council or what have 1
you?

The Editor, Sir:
In the following, I wish to express
some opinion in connection, with the
address given by a Japanese leader, Mr.
Tsurumi, Tuesday evening in the Gen
eral Assembly Hall, Stanford University.

In his speech, the speaker had given
a vivid description about the recent de
velopment of Japan and particularly em
phasized the point that Japan is becoming
more and more Americanized and her
attitude is becoming more and more lib
eral and progressive in almost every re
spect of her national activities. As a
neighbor and friend of Japan, I feel
really proud and happy to hear such a
kind of report.

Concerning the Japanese policy toward
China, the speaker boldly said that Japan,
during the last few years, has displaced
her old policy by a very liberal and
friendly principle of "non-interference"
in the domestic affairs of China. To this
assertion 1 am very sorry to say that Mr.
Tsurumi had been really a little too care
less if not purposely trying to throw dust
into the eyes of the world. In order to
prove the fact, it is needless to go back
too far to the Japanese seizure of Korea,
the most notorious "twenty-one de
mands" and any other spoils of plunder
ing and invasions on the part of Japan.
The recent Tsinan Incident and her pres
ent attempt to prevent the unification
of China by keeping Manchuria from
joining the National government are
enough to show the difference between
Japan's old aggressive policy and her
present friendly "liberalism" and non-in
terference concerning the domestic affairs
of the latter.

When the nationalists or the revolu
tionary army had succeeded in crushing
the conservative self-seeking militarists
one after another and had reached almost
the very heart of Shantung province, the
cradle of Chinese civilization, the Japan
ese Government, in spite of the protests
of the Chinese Government, forcibly des
patched thousands of soldiers to Tsinan,
which is neither a concession nor a for
eign settlement but the capital of Shan
tung, under the pretext of protecting the
Japanese residents there. They declared
about three-fourths of the city as the
protective area and within that area not a
single Chinese soldier was allowed to
enter. This naturally led to constant con
flicts and as a result, more than two
thousand Chinese soldiers and civilians
were killed, the city bombarded. What is
most terrible is that the Chinese Com
missioner for foreign affairs, Mr. Tsai
Kung-Shih, was killed after the Japanese
had satisfactorily displayed their cruelty
by cutting off his nose and ears. A few
days after the incident, Japan sent more
troops to Tsingtao and seized the Kio
chow-Tsinan Railroad, which lies
straight across the Shantung province.
Since that time Japan has been practicing
a reign of terror in the area—Chinese na

tional flag is not allowed to hoist within
that province; press and private letters
are to be inspected and censored if they
desire before delivery; private houses and
public organizations such as Y.M.C.A.
are constantly searched ; women and girls
are ill-treated. All this, and even Chinese
patients and wounded soldiers are not
safe in hospitals.

Just a few weeks ago the young gen
eral Chang Hsio-liang of Manchuria, see
ing that further civil wars would paralyze
the nation, decided to join hands with the
Central government. Here the Japanese
"liberal and friendly policy" intruded into
the entanglement by sending to the Yuong
general a series of warnings and formal
notifications.

All these instances show clearly what
kind of policy Japan has been practicing
in China. I sincerely hope that Mr. Tsur
umi will put more effort to effect his gov
ernment to withdraw the Japanese troops
from Shantung and to stop these ridicu
lous diplomatic practices so as to bring
the "Japanese Liberalism" both in theory
and practice into realization.
