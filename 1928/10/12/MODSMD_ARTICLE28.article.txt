Education for World-Citizenship.
By William G. Carr. (Stanford Uni
versity Press, 1928.)
David Starr Jordan may have had rot
ten eggs hurled at him during the War
because of his beliefs; but his good
work is now bearing fruit with a ven
geance. Here is the first book to be pub
lished on its subject, that of world citi
zenship, a citizenship far greater than
that bounded by rivers or mountains or
lines on a map.
We give Dr. Jordan much credit for
two reasons: In the first place, Carr is
a graduate of Stanford, where Dr. Jor
dan planted his seeds of free and honest
thinking; in the second place, it was Dr.
Jordan who read the manuscript of this
book and recommended its publication.
Carr places squareiy before us the re
sponsibilities involved in a new branch
of education—"education for world-citi
zenship which promotes among ail peoples
a sympathetic, peaceful co-operation based
on democracy." lie toadies to no one.
He is not mislead by beligerant militar
ists who would have us believe that it is
both necessary and desirable to spend
ninety-five cents out of every tax dollar
for war, armies and navies.
The author's vision extends beyond
tariff walls and narrow-minded isolation.
Straight from the shoulder, Carr denies
the necessity of military training of
youth in schools and colleges; he chal
lenges the belief that man has an inherited
blood-lust, a natural fighting instinct.
We fear that this book will not pass
the censor boards of our educational in
stitutions which compel military training.
But we hope our fears arc groundless.
This book comes as a breath of dawn
at a time when such as William Randolph
Hearst arc sticking their muddy fingers
into the international pot-pic.
