### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 11 (/P) â€”A tear gas
bomb kept in the office safe of the Hi-
Grade Dairy here to foil safe crackers,
tonight apparently aided robbers who
blew open the safe and cscapcd with
$1,000 in cash.
A squad of police responding to the
alarm of a night watchman of a neigh
boring establishment were driven from
the office, weeping, by the gas . It was
some time before they could enter the
dairy to see how successfully the safe
blowers had worked.
