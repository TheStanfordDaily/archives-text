OCTOBER 11TH —
Have conceived a great desire to
audit some of the meetings of the \
tryoutees for yell leaders, since 1 have ;
a great desire to see how they are 1
trained. Do wonder if they yell all
together, or separately, but do sup
pose there is a great deal of hoo-rah !
at any rate.
• • *
Did dream most pleasantly last
night that the public address system
in the stadium was extended through
the whole University, and that stu- j
dents did receive an individual re- j
ceiving set on registration day, and '
that all lecture courses were given
over the radio. Which was most de
lightful on rainy days and for eight
o'clock classes, but was somewhat of
a disadvantage in taking gym classes,
most inconvenient in doing setting-up
exercises.
* * *
And that one of the requirements
for entrance to Stanford was a knowl
edge of the Morse code, being the ;
method by which examinations were
taken. And that my citizenship quiz j
section was given a cut because of |
the static in the air.
* i{c *
So woke up to find myself late for
my eight o'clock, and did spend the j
entire day catching up with myself. j
To Dr. Jordan's Thursday evening I
lecture to hear him speak on "Karly [
Ideals of Stanford." Found myself re
gretful that I was not of the genera- !
tion of students of the first years. j
* * *
Am looking forward to the produc
tion of "The Queen's Husband" to
morrow, for though I did see it this
summer, have heard that the new ad- j
distions to the cast make it quite dif- j
ferent. And Lord! I would sit through
the play four times for the pleasure I
of watching Mr. Davis play checkers
with the butler! And so to bed, weary,
but relieved that I have got caught
up with my diary again, for there are
so many things doing that at times
I have been afraid I should have to
relinquish this record, and that would j
disappoint my uncle greatly.

together, or separately, but do sup
pose there is a great deal of hoo-rah !
at any rate.

Did dream most pleasantly last
night that the public address system
in the stadium was extended through
the whole University, and that stu- j
dents did receive an individual re- j
ceiving set on registration day, and '
that all lecture courses were given
over the radio. Which was most de
lightful on rainy days and for eight
o'clock classes, but was somewhat of
a disadvantage in taking gym classes,
most inconvenient in doing setting-up
exercises.

And that one of the requirements
for entrance to Stanford was a knowl
edge of the Morse code, being the ;
method by which examinations were
taken. And that my citizenship quiz j
section was given a cut because of |
the static in the air.

So woke up to find myself late for
my eight o'clock, and did spend the j
entire day catching up with myself. j
To Dr. Jordan's Thursday evening I
lecture to hear him speak on "Karly [
Ideals of Stanford." Found myself re
gretful that I was not of the genera- !
tion of students of the first years. j

Am looking forward to the produc
tion of "The Queen's Husband" to
morrow, for though I did see it this
summer, have heard that the new ad- j
distions to the cast make it quite dif- j
ferent. And Lord! I would sit through
the play four times for the pleasure I
of watching Mr. Davis play checkers
with the butler! And so to bed, weary,
but relieved that I have got caught
up with my diary again, for there are
so many things doing that at times
I have been afraid I should have to
relinquish this record, and that would j
disappoint my uncle greatly.
