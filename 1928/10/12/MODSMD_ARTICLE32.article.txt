### PHILIP SPACE 
(EDITOR'S NOTE-. Mr. Space, whose
illustrious name heads this column, has
had a severe mental disturbance —almost
a brain fever. He has started to write
verse. It is true that several pointed
limericks haz'e appeared already, but this
was but a mild forerunner of wha is to
come. It is not expected that Mr. Space
will ever be the same again, so zve may
look for anything, actually anything, from
tioiv on.)
THE 'HIST' IN HISTORY
1
The great debunking spree is on
And history's heroes topple down.
When Rome was burned, now—pro and
eon—
Was Emperor Nero out of town?
Quite soon we may expect to know
That Benvenuto was a liar.
A ladies' man—a hothead?—No
A simple, pure, and quiet friar.
George Washington, the first in war,
Instead of fighting went in swimmin'.
He loved his countrymen —and more—
He also loved his countrywomen.
Each history book must pass a test
And Aaron Burr, you now may see,
Quite surreptitiously possessed
A duel personality.
A friend suggests we write a humorous
article concerning the campaign brown
derby. Nothing can be said. The brown
derby is already a humorous article.

NEW STADIUM TOMORROW
YO HO HO AND A RONDEAU
In other climes the palm trees grow
Quite naturally, row on row,
And do not die.
And what a shock
It is to see a towering rock
Quite smothered in the glistening snow!
We take a hike and always know
The hills are rather round and low
Near here. One grasps an alpenstock
In other climbs.
