World's Series may come and
world's series may go, but certain
plays that happened in the past are
so indelibly written on the minds of
the fans who saw them that no num
ber of years can ever obliterate their
memory. Also they are down in black
and white in the record books, which
makes it nice for young sports car
toonists who were too busy going to
high school to do anything but read
about the 1912 world's series.

That was the year that the series
went to eight games, the Ked Sox
and the Giants having played a 6 to (5
tie in the second game. The final con

1 a world's series. That was the game
j ;n which Fred Snodgrass, Giant left
\ fielder, made his $30,000 muff in the

l Engle with the tying run, and later

! only one of its kind in a world series
game, Pitcher Bagby of Cleveland hit
a home run!
In 1923 Casey Stengel, of the Giants,
