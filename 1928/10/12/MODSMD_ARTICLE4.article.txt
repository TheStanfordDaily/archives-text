# UNDEFEATED BABE ELEVEN CLASHES WITH PASADENA
## Lightweight Squad Conceded Good Chance Against Junior College 
### 
An undefeated Cardinal freshman i
football eleven, with three straight
victories, will take the field tomorrow
afternoon against the Pasadena Jun
ior College varsity in the Stadium be
ginning at 12:30 o'clock. The fresh
men have a team of championship
calibre and should come out on the j
long end of the score if no unforeseen j
circumstances arise.
Coach Husky Hunt's squad is small
and the men are fairly light, the re
sult being that reserves are not as
plentiful as might be desired. How
ever, Hunt has eleven good men to
start the game and sufficient reserves i
to relieve them unless a wholesale j
slaughter of these eleven prospective ,
Card gridders should ensue.
Pasadenans Defeated
Though defeated 26 to 0 by the
University of Southern California !
freshmen last week, the Pasadena \
Junior College team is still somewhat i
of an unknown quantity. It is reported j
to be one of the heaviest elevens to !
represent the Pasadena institution In ]
many years, and notwithstanding ;
the score, its showing against the j
U.S.C. frosh is said to have been [
strong.
The Stanford freshmen are con
siderably lighter than the yearlings
of last year, the 1932 men averaging
177 pounds in the line as compared
with an average of 196 pounds a man I
from tackle to tackle on the 1931
first string. The backfield probably
averages somewhere near 170 pounds
a man. The average age of this year's
squad is 18 years, which is claimed to
be the lowest average age for any
freshman squad ever to play at Stan- j
ford.
Allen Out of Lineup
Dusty Allen, strong freshman full
back, has not been out for practice
since Monday because of sickness and
will not be in the lineup tomorrow.
His work in backing up the line in the
Santa Clara game last Saturday was
outstanding.
Cadell, promising halfback, has
been working out in Allen's place and
will start in the fullback berth to
morrow. Cadell is a speedy back, and
though somewhat light for a fullback,
weighing only about 170 pounds,
should perform ably in Allen's place.
The remainder of the lineup will
be the same as started against Santa !
Clara, as follows: Toll, right end; Col-'
vin, left end; Grey, left tackle; Doub,
right tackle; Toepke, left guard; j
Brooks, right guard; Milligan, center; j
llintala, left halfback; Wilson, right'
halfback; and Marks, quarterback.
Punting Is Strong
The kicking department is more
than amply taken care of with all
four men in the backfield, Wilson,
Marks, Cadell, and Rintala better
than average punters. Wilson did the
heavy work in this line last week and
got off some long spirals for dis
tances of better than fifty yards. Grey,
heavy tackle from Glendale, will
again do the place-kicking and a repe-1
tition of his performance in tne Santa
Clara game when he kicked six goals ;
in six tries is looked for.
If the Cards get a substantial lead
over the visitors Hunt plans to send
a lot of the reserves into the game. I
Probable substitutions will be Simp-1
son, Dickson, and Kelly, ends; Eby,
tackle; Lyon, guard; Lambert, half
back; and Thigpin, quarterback.
With the varsity contest with
U.C.L.A. conceded to be a sure vic
tory and the freshman game still a
matter of conjecture, attendance at
the latter by Stanford football fanu j
will probably be well repaid. The j
freshmen have a smooth-working ma
chine that is well worth watching.
