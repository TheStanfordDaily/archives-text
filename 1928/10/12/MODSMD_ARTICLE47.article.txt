AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. 11.—(IP).—The
student body of the College of Engineer
ing of the University of Texas gave
unanimous endorsement to their honor
system in passing a recent resolution.
They went on record, however, as object
ing to the third clause of their present
pledge, which reads, "I have neither
given nor received help in this examina
tion ; nor have I seen anyone else give or
receive help."

Lincoln, Nebraska, hopes to enter
tain the Olympic athletes on their
way to the games in Los Angeles in
1932.
