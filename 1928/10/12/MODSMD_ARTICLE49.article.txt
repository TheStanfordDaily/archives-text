## 
### 
The Women's Glee Club is co-oper

Memorial Church in furnishing music
for the service on Matriculation Sun

gether last night.
Further plans for co-operation with
other student musical organizations in

contribute a chorus number in a
Schubert concert to be given this
autumn.
I)r. John Griggs, the new director
of the Glee Club, is insisting on a
higher standard of work, and it is ex
