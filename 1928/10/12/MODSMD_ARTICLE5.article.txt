# STOLL-M'CRACKEN EXPEDITION FINDS ALASKA MUMMIES
## 
### 
PRINCE RUPERT, B. C., Oct. 11 (ff)
With four mummies, relics of a relatively
high ancient civilization that inhabited
the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, the Stoll-
McCracken scientific expedition was here
today after a summer in northern waters.
The age of the mummified bodies, which
members of the expedition were unable
to determine, will be ascertained by the
American Museum of Natural History
in New York, under whose auspices the
scientists cruised the most unfrequented
seas of Alaska.
Color was lent to oft-told Eskimo le
gends of a prehistoric race when five
bodies were found in a crude grave near
the summit of a mountain on one of the
lesser Aleutian Islands. The fifth body
was not brought back on the steam
schooncr Morrissey.
The bodies, all well preserved, were
found in a tomb reminiscent of a civiliza
tion much higher than that now known
by either Alaskan Eskimo or Indians.
The burial chamber was divided into two
compartments.
In the larger lay the body of what was
suposed to be the chief of t the tribe,
wrapped in otter and other valuable skins,
and many yards of straw matting which
would have taken several native weavers
many months to make. Two children,
supposed to be the chief of the tribe,
in the same chamber, were similarly
wrapped.
