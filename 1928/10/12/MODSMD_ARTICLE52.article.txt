# U.S.C. WHELMED WITH GLOOM AS SEVEN MEN HURT
## Jess Hibbs Leads String of Cripples; Knees, Ankles Fail Owners 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11. (/P) — It
never rains but it pours, according to a
gloomy adage, and Trojan football fol
lowers today agreed that it had poured.
Injuries to seven first string men had
dampened enthusiasm around the Uni
versity of Southern California campus.

Perhaps the injury which hurts worst
is that which keeps Captain Jess Hibbs
hobbling about on a cane with the St.
Mary's game but two days away. Hibbs
will be back on the field soon, after Sat
urday's game, but his leg has kept him
out of practice all week.

Boren, Shaw, Ritchey, Tappaan, Porter,
and Wilcox were the others on the hos
pital list. Tom Wilcox, who with Mar
shall DufTield ; starred in scrimmage last
night in one of Coach Howard Jones'
new yard-gaining formations, came off
with a bad ankle. He may lie able to
appear against the gaels. Boren and
Ritchey, the latter who was considered
the find of the Oregon State game, are
nufsing twisted knees, while Shaw, a
promising guard, tore a cartilage in his
leg and Porter has a leg in a cast. In
spite of his unrepaired Jaw Tappaan may
do relief work at end Saturday.

The silver lining of the cloud that so
besprinkled the Trojan camp with in
juries was seen on the field yesterday in
the manner in which the remainder of the
gridmen reeled off yards against the re
serves. Don Williams at quarter, with
Lloyd Thomas and Harry Edelson, at
halves and Russ Saunders at fullback,
made up the most impressive backfield,
but no chances were taken with Williams,
and shortly Thomas stepped to the helm
and Jess Mortenson took up his halfback
duties. This combination looked good.
The last combination saw Duffield at
quarter, Wilcox at full and Edelson and
Saunders at the halves. This last group
sparkled. The fact that Wilcox ankle
injury was not serious, makes it possible
that he will see some service Saturday.

The Trojan forward wall was lined
up after the injury victims had found
comfortable seats on the bench as fol
lows: Lowry McCaslin and Tony Step
onovitch at ends, Cecil Hoff and Frank
Anthony at tackles, Clark Galloway and
Irving Winfield, guards and Nate Bar
rager at center, which performed in a
not too discouraging fashion in scrim
mage.

the manner in which the remainder of the
gridmen reeled off yards against the re
serves. Don Williams at quarter, with
Lloyd Thomas and Harry Edelson, at
halves and Russ Saunders at fullback,
made up the most impressive backfield,
but no chances were taken with Williams,
and shortly Thomas stepped to the helm
and Jess Mortenson took up his halfback
duties. This combination looked good.
The last combination saw Duffield at
quarter, Wilcox at full and Edelson and
Saunders at the halves. This last group
sparkled. The fact that Wilcox ankle
injury was not serious, makes it possible
that he will see some service Saturday.

The Trojan forward wall was lined
up after the injury victims had found
comfortable seats on the bench as fol
lows: Lowry McCaslin and Tony Step
onovitch at ends, Cecil Hoff and Frank
Anthony at tackles, Clark Galloway and
Irving Winfield, guards and Nate Bar
rager at center, which performed in a
not too discouraging fashion in scrim
mage.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11. (/P) — It
never rains but it pours, according to a
gloomy adage, and Trojan football fol
lowers today agreed that it had poured.
Injuries to seven first string men had
dampened enthusiasm around the Uni
versity of Southern California campus.

Perhaps the injury which hurts worst
is that which keeps Captain Jess Hibbs
hobbling about on a cane with the St.
Mary's game but two days away. Hibbs
will be back on the field soon, after Sat
urday's game, but his leg has kept him
out of practice all week.

Boren, Shaw, Ritchey, Tappaan, Porter,
and Wilcox were the others on the hos
pital list. Tom Wilcox, who with Mar
shall DufTield ; starred in scrimmage last
night in one of Coach Howard Jones'
new yard-gaining formations, came off
with a bad ankle. He may lie able to
appear against the gaels. Boren and
Ritchey, the latter who was considered
the find of the Oregon State game, are
nufsing twisted knees, while Shaw, a
promising guard, tore a cartilage in his
leg and Porter has a leg in a cast. In
spite of his unrepaired Jaw Tappaan may
do relief work at end Saturday.

The silver lining of the cloud that so
besprinkled the Trojan camp with in
juries was seen on the field yesterday in
the manner in which the remainder of the
gridmen reeled off yards against the re
serves. Don Williams at quarter, with
Lloyd Thomas and Harry Edelson, at
