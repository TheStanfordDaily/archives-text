# TIBBETT COMMENCES CAREER WITH FIGHT
## Famous Baritone Battles to Subdue Opposer Who Objected To His Singing During War Service in Navy 
### S. W 
Beginning his singing career with a
fight to subdue an opposer who didn't
appreciate his efforts during the World
War, Lawrence Tibbett is now one of
the most popular opera as well as concert
stars in America.
During his war service in the Navy,
Tibbett was fond of singing little ditties
and songs as he worked. One day one
of his comrades called him down, and
told him he'd have to stop. Tibbett is
not known as the "Bakersfield oil-drillers"
singer for nothing, and soon showed his
comrade that he had a perfect right to
sing if he wanted to.
Rise is Rapid
From such a humble beginning Tibbett
is now one of the most sought after of
singers, and his powers are greeted with
intense enthusiasm over the country.
According to the Chicago Herald Ex
aminer, "Tibbett presents the somewhat
rare spectacle of a baritone who is as
popular with the public as a tenor." The
Washington Times declares: "His voiÂ«e
is full of feeling, he sings with the heart
as well as the soul."
Unusually Popular
Those who have heard Tibbett will
readily understand why, once the Cali
fornia baritone has begun to sing, people
are loath to have him stop. Stories of
trains being held for him while he kept
singing for audiences are common. The
same tremendous dramatic power and
delivery of words that kept people ap
plauding for fifteen minutes the night
of his debut as Ford in "Falstaff" keep
them applauding whenever he sings. The
facts of the stories of his concerts read
like pure fiction.
Tibbetts will sing at Stanford two

weeks from today, October 26, in the
Pavilion. Season tickets for the A.S.S.U.
Concert series are on sale in the Old
Union.
