# NEED STUNTS FOR U.S.C.-STANFORD FOOTBALL GAME
## 
### 
Although the Rally Committee contest
for rooters stunt suggestions to be used
at the U.S.C.-Stanford football game
has been under way for only one day,
George Ellsworth, chairman of the se
lection committee, reports that several
students have already submitted stunt
ideas. Lapp, Roberts, and Wright of San
Francisco are offering a silver trophy to
be presented to the originator of the best
stunt.
Ellsworth urges freshmen especially to
enter the contest. Stunts relating particu
larly to Stanford or complimentary to
U.S.C. will be given first consideration,
although no restrictions have been placed
on the types acceptable.
Stunts should be blocked out on graph
paper and the color scheme noted. If
a student is unable to do this, a bare out
line drawing, if clear, will be sufficient.
No limit has Ik-cii placed on the number
of ideas that may be submitted by each
student.
All material should he mailed to George
Ellsworth, Box 082, Campus.
