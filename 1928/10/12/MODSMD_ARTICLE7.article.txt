# 'Queen's Husband' In Third Staging On Campus Offers Brilliant Cast
## Davis, Volland Have Leads In Comedy-Satire by Robert Sherwood 
### KATHLEEN FITZ 
"The Queen's Husband" will be pre
sented tonight, in the Assembly Hall
at 8:20 o'clock, for the third time on
the Stanford campus, with Gordon
Davis in the title role. Appreciation of
the opportunity of having this com
edy-satire by Robert Sherwood pro
duced again has been shown by the
unusually large seat sale.
Dress rehearsal last night promised
' a finished performance from the leads.
! Those members of the cast who are
I taking their roles for the first time
] are rounding out their characteriza
; tions to match the work of tbe more
experienced actors.
Irony Evident
The play offers ample opportunity ]
for finesse in tempo and repartee j
, timing, at which Gordon Davis excels, j
j Many of the lines are finely shaded j
i with irony; the satire on continental ,
royalty is keenly pointed.
Virginia Volla#id, who plays the
Queen, and Helen Ward, the Princess i
Anne, are both new to the cast, but |
in rehearsal their work promises an
excellent production. Irving Rosen
j blatt and Dick Fisher are expected to
j repeat their successes of the summer
j season.
Davis to Star
Gordon Davis, as the figure-head !
king, holds most of the action of the J
play in the hollow of his hand, and j
should fulfill the expectations of those j
in the audience who have not seen j
him since his return from Europe.
The performance will be interesting j
both from a dramatic standpoint and ;
from that of production. Harold Hel
venston's set and sound effects mark
an advance in a Stanford stage back
ground.
Only one set is used for the three
r.cts, but it is in harmony with the ;
atmosphere of the play and adds a j
great deal to the artisticness of the I
representation of situation and char-!
acter.
There are still a few tickets that'
may be obtained at the box office.
