# GRAF ZEPPELIN TRACES COURSE OF COLUMBUS
## Sixty People Aboard Giant; Communication Is Last Had at Barcelona 
### 
I FRIEDRICHSHAFEN, Ger., Oct. 11.
! (JP) —Bound over the same track that
I Columbus followed 436 years ago, the
! giant German dirigible Graf Zeppelin
; tonight was nosing her way westward
toward the United States on the first
; commercial transatlantic air voyage.
| In the place of the 88 aboard the his
i toric caravan that led the way to the
New World in 1492, were sixty souls,
including one woman, who boarded
the dirigible at Friedrichschafen this
| morning and began the long voyage
| across southern Europe and the At
lantic to the United States.
Just twelve hours later, the dirigible
passed over Barcelona, Spain, well on
her way over a course along the
southern Atlantic route, westward
i toward the Azores and America. The
J northern route had been abandoned
even before the flight started because
of stormy weather conditions, and
even the southern route, so far as the
continent was concerned, was none
too good. Out at sea, however, condi
tions were reported more favorable.
"I expect to reach New York Sun
| day morning," said Dr. Hugo Eckener,
' the ship's commander, just before the
'departure. "The last weather reports
I timed 2:00 A.M., speak of heavy
storms. Under these circumstances,
!of course, it is impossible to deter
mine the exact route in advance. In
genei'al, however, I can say we will
stick to the southern course, flying
over France and then heading south
; ward to avoid a depression which is
1 moving to and fro between Newfound
| land and Ireland. The northern route
, is out of the question."
