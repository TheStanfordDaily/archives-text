<$> The attention of the Daily's
<$> readers is called to the fact that <•
<$> letters to the editor must be <9
<§> signed by the author before they <§>
<$> will he printed in Campus Opin- <$>
<?> ion. Of course, a request may be
<t> mado to print the letter anony
<?> mously or under such a signa
j ture as "indignant subscriber" •
j <$• or "'29" and that will be carried <£
I <$> out. At present, the Daily has at <§
<$> hand an opinion unsigned by the <§
<$> author. If he will disclose him- <•
<r self, the letter will be published.
