# COMMITTEE IN HONOR SYSTEM PROBE CHOSEN
## Cavalero Appoints Seven To Serve on Investigation Body; Report Due This Quarter 
### 
In accordance with the recommen
dation expressed by President Wilbur
in his welcoming address to the fresh
men October 5, Phil Cavalero, presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., yesterday ap
pointed a committee of seven students
to investigate the honor system and
present a report to the student body
the latter part of this quarter.
Templeton Peck was appointed
•chairman of the committee, the other
members of which are Alexia Mc-
Carty, Maxine Cushing, Ward Ed
monds, Winston Norman, Frank Sau
liere, and Merrill Armour. Ex-officio
members are Janet Harris, chairman
of the Women's Council; Fred Wool,
chairman of the Men's Council; and
Cavalero. This committee will carry
on a detailed investigation of the
honor system and of the students' at
titude toward it; and, if found neces
sary, changes in the system will be
recommended.
Dr. Wilbur, in discussing the mat
ter in his welcoming address, de
clared, "The honor system at Stan
ford has started to creak. There is a
certain cynical attitude on the part
■of some students who cut corners
short for themselves and smile at the
honor system. When they begin that,
it means they are mentally rotten.
"It is up to you whether you want
to see Stanford stamp on a crook. Can
the men and women of Stanford let
the system die? It is one of the best
things you have, but if you don't
want it sound and clean you may not
have it."
It was pointed out yesterday that
Stanford is not the only university at
which the honor system has been the
center of considerable discussion, pro
and con. At Yale last year the student
council asked the university adminis
tration to abandon the honor system.
In contrast to this at Princeton the
honor system is becoming better and
better, according to President John
Grier Hibben. Harvard has never had
an honor system. Last year the Uni
versity of California abolished the
rule that professors should stay out
of classrooms during examinations.
