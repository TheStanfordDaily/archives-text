# DAILY EDITORIAL TRYOUTS WILL BEGIN TODAY
## Previous Experience Is Not Required; Frosh Urged To Turn Out 
### 
Tryouts for the editorial staff of
The Stanford Daily will commence
this afternoon with a meeting at 1
o'clock in the Daily office next to the
Press building. Anyone interested in
journalism may try out, and fresh
men in particular are requested to at
tend.
Work for the tryoutees will begin
at once, and will consist of covering
regular news beats, rewriting stories,
and reading proof. Tryoutees will be
judged according to the quality of
their work, the hours spent in helping
in the office, and the thoroughness
they display on their beats.
No previous experience on high
school or junior college publications
is necessary. This work is especially
valuable to those interested in a
journalistic career later on, because
the Daily is conducted on lines simi
lar to a city paper, and all the prob
lems of a larger publication are met
with here. This actual practice is
found in no other department of the
University in such a large measure.
Several steps in promotions are
open to the tryoutee who is taken on
the staff as a reporter. From reporter
he advances to copy editor, who cov
ers a beat, reads copy and writes
headlines; then he becomes night ed
itor, in charge of one paper a week;
from here to associate and managing
editor, and finally to editor and
women's editor.
Close touch with the working of
the University is kept on the Daily
staff, and members become well ac
qainted with all student activities and
University organization.
