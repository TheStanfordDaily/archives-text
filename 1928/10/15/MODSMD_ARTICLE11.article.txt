# SWORD, SANDALS GIVE NEXT PLAY, 'DEVIL IN CHEESE'
## 
### 
"The Devil in the Cheese," by Tom
Cushing, has been chosen by Gordon
Davis for the Sword and Sandals play
to be given November 9. The try
outs for this show will be held this
afternoon from 4 to 5 o'clock and this
evening from 7 to 9 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall.
Everyone who feels at all dramati
cally inclined is urged to attend the
tryouts. Mr. Davis will judge those
who appear, not only for this next
production, but also for the plays that
will follow. He considers these try
outs to be the most important of the
year. This does not mean that other
tryouts will not be held for the later
plays, but Mr. Davis explained that
he is starting a card-index system in
which he will keep track of every
one who reads for him, and that many
of his later judgments will be influ
enced by these first tryouts.
