# BERKELEY ARTIST'S EXHIBIT OPENS TODAY
## Many Native Landscapes in Colorful Group of Canvasses by Marie Gleason Cruess 
### 
An exhibition of oil paintings by j
I
the Berkeley artist, Marie Gleason
Cruess, will begin today in the Stan
ford Art Gallery. Mrs. Cruess' work
is entirely in landscapes, and many
California scenes are shown in the
collection.
The dominant characteristic of this
artist's pictures is color. Most of the
subjects seem to be bathed in sun-
I light, and the emphasis on all the
i canvasses is on the color and bril- j
j liance of the views.
While there is an evidence of a;
definite technique, there is also a j
! ious subjects. In some pictures such I
variety shown in the handling of var- j
j as "The Desert Rim" the brush j
! strokes are broad and courageous; in J
| others such a?- "Roadway" the picture j
| is painted with short strokes nearly i

■ all of the same length, which add to
j the picture a quality of even texture,
i Still another method is shown In
j "Scrub Oaks." This is done in stip
i pling, or small crisp spots of pure
color put on with the end of a brush.
By this method of painting Marie
Gleason Cruess produces the larger
and more immediate effects or im
pressions without selection or elabo
ration of details. The artist sees pri
marily the color in California scenery,
I and sacrifices complete accuracy of
j reproduction for the color impres
; sions.
The exhibition will remain until
November 1. In the right-hand room
j at the Gallery 1s the U.S. Food Ad-
I ministration's exhibition of the Hoo
ver posters made during the World
■ War. This comes from the Hoover
i War Library.
