# German Zeppelin Off U. S. Coast, Savannah Report
## Giant Craft Sends Word 150 Miles West of Bermuda; Bound for Lakehurst 
### 
SAVANNAH, Ga., Oct. 14.—(/P)....
The naval radio station here re
ported that it received a message
from the Graf Zeppelin at 11:35
Eastern Standard Time, stating
that the giant dirigible was at
that hour 150 miles northeast of
Bermuda and heading northwest.
This message was officially for
warded to Washington. Contact
will be maintained with the dirigi
ble. Nothing further has been
heard since that hour.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14. (/P)—The
position of the Graf Zeppelin at 11
p.m. Eastern Standard Time was
given as 150 miles west of Bermuda
tonight by the naval communications
office. This word was said to be con
tained in a radio message which was
not clearly received. The navy office
thought that the Zeppelin was 120
miles oft' Bermuda, and this was fol
lowed by a check-up with other re
ceivers. The 150-mile position was
given to naval officers by the Airways
Radio Corporation which intercepted
the message, and the officers were
inclined to accept that information as
more accurate. The message also
stated that the Zeppelin was making
for Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.
FRIEDRICSHAFEN, Oct. 14 (/P)—
Officials of the Zeppelin Company ap
peared nervous early this morning as
bulletins from Dr. Hugo Eckenor, and
more apprehensive news from other

pelin has possibly been thrown back
in its attempts to reach the American
coast.
