# CULVER DEFINES STANFORD IDEAL IN TALK SUNDAY
## President Wilbur, Dean Yost Greet New Students in Matriculation Service 
### 
"Stanford University wants to
graduate students who are not merely
encylopedias of information, clever
adding machines, well-trained ath
letes, socially accomplished, but men
and women of education and culture
with a spiritual and sympathetic un
derstanding of the joys of citizenship
and life," said Dean George B. Culver
yesterday in his address to the fresh
men in the matriculation services
held in the Memorial Church.
President Wilbur, Dean Yost, and
Dean Culver gavo speeches of wel
come to the new students in the Uni
versity. Dean Culver spoke on the
spiritual life of Stanford, calling it
Stanford's best heritage.
Dean Yost, in the first address,
made a plea for the "open mind" at
college. "Today the younger genera
tion challenges the opinion of the
older. The best development of the
student as an individual can be se
cured by cultivating the open mind.
The University requires that the new
men and women reside in living
groups separate from the rest of the
campus so there will be a geographi
cal opportunity to have open-minded
ness in social connections."
President Wilbur in the concluding
address of the services emphasized
the need for a "question mark in the
minds of the students." Wilbur said:
"Students come here with fixed ideas
and presently begin to wonder what
it's all about." Speaking to the fresh
men he said: "Keep your minds free
for new decisions, but unless you
look out for the spiritual side of life
you will miss the greatest thing of
all.
"The only guide for the individual
is conscience. While we can measure
many things by laboratory methods,
morals and spiritual qualities cannot
be measured as yet, and we must
accept them. Education is not com
plete without some religion, and the
happiest point of view and philosophy
of life comes from religious thinking."
