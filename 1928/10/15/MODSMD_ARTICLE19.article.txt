## 
### 
Stanford's 1928 intramural golf
tournament will get under way this
morning at the Capuchino Country
Club, when nearly fifty teams of two
men each will tee off in the qualifying
round.
Charles Davis, director of intramur
al sports, has asked that all players
begin the round sometime before 1:15.
The pairings will be made at the first
tee, so that the teams will be able to
start as soon as they arrive without
having to wait for another team.
Sixteen teams will qualify in two
flights. Match play will start Wednes
day, and five points in intramural
scoring will be awarded to every or
ganization entering a team.
