# U.C.L.A. SHOWS FIGHT AGAINST HER TEAM
## Stanford Reserve Strength Apparent Saturday in Easy Victory Over Bruin Eleven 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Coach Bill Spaulding's Bruins have
returned to their Los Angeles lair a
trifle sore in spots, but rejoicing in
the possession of their newly ac
quired Pacific Coast Conference
badge. The Angelenos took a 45-7
spanking from the Stanford Cardinals
as part of the initiation ceremony.
Noah Webster, wordy dean of the
American language, describes the
bruin as an animal that "can move
very rapidly for a short distance, es
pecially on rough ground." If he had
also mentioned the beast's ability to
stage a respectable fight against great
odds he would have practically told
the story of Saturday's game.
For local football enthusiasts the
game revealed primarily that Pop
Warner has on hand a worthy array
of talent and strength among his re
serves. With the score tied 7-7 In the
second quarter the Warnermen gave
their first demonstration of power,
turning the game from an even-steven
contest to a one-sided affair. At half
time the score was 19-7. From the
opening kick-off of the second half
the Cards continued to drive a sharp
wedge into the metaphorical gap be
tween the two elevens until Stanford
led by a margin of six touchdowns
when the game ended.
Only once did U.C.L.A. threaten to
cross the goal line after making its
first score; that was when Angle
nearly completed a pass over the goal
line to Velasco i nthe last period.
Forster, flashy Gold-and-Blue halfback,
recorded the visitors' lone tally in a
spectacular 97-yard run after receiv
ing Lewis' kickoff on his own three
yard line and racing through and
around opposition—a valuable part of
which was eliminated by effective in
terference. Joe Fleming, injured cap
tain, halfback, and dropkicker extra
ordinary, then came into the game—
for one thing. He did it.
Of Stanford's seven touchdowns,
Lewis, Smalling, and Rothert each
scored one; Frentrup and Rehrig
scored two each. Stanford converted
three times. In the Cardinal drives
toward the Bruin goal, Tandy, Bush,
and Vermilya were outstanding among
reserve linemen.
Wayman, Frentrup, and Marks will
be on the injured list for a day or so
this week as a result of injuries re
ceived in the game. However, they
are expected to be ready for play next
Friday against Idaho.
Saturday's score is overwhelmingly
in favor of the Cards; so are the sta
tistics, but neither tell the whole tale.
The Bruins proved to northern fans
that the Golden Bear has a worthy
relative in the South.

also mentioned the beast's ability to
stage a respectable fight against great
odds he would have practically told
the story of Saturday's game.
For local football enthusiasts the
game revealed primarily that Pop
Warner has on hand a worthy array
of talent and strength among his re
serves. With the score tied 7-7 In the
second quarter the Warnermen gave
their first demonstration of power,
turning the game from an even-steven
contest to a one-sided affair. At half
time the score was 19-7. From the
opening kick-off of the second half
the Cards continued to drive a sharp
wedge into the metaphorical gap be
tween the two elevens until Stanford
led by a margin of six touchdowns
when the game ended.
Only once did U.C.L.A. threaten to
cross the goal line after making its
first score; that was when Angle
nearly completed a pass over the goal
line to Velasco i nthe last period.
Forster, flashy Gold-and-Blue halfback,
recorded the visitors' lone tally in a
spectacular 97-yard run after receiv
ing Lewis' kickoff on his own three
yard line and racing through and
around opposition—a valuable part of
which was eliminated by effective in
terference. Joe Fleming, injured cap
tain, halfback, and dropkicker extra
ordinary, then came into the game—
for one thing. He did it.
Of Stanford's seven touchdowns,
Lewis, Smalling, and Rothert each
scored one; Frentrup and Rehrig
scored two each. Stanford converted
three times. In the Cardinal drives
toward the Bruin goal, Tandy, Bush,
and Vermilya were outstanding among
reserve linemen.
Wayman, Frentrup, and Marks will
be on the injured list for a day or so
this week as a result of injuries re
ceived in the game. However, they
are expected to be ready for play next
Friday against Idaho.
Saturday's score is overwhelmingly
in favor of the Cards; so are the sta
tistics, but neither tell the whole tale.
The Bruins proved to northern fans
that the Golden Bear has a worthy
relative in the South.
Coach Bill Spaulding's Bruins have
returned to their Los Angeles lair a
trifle sore in spots, but rejoicing in
the possession of their newly ac
quired Pacific Coast Conference
badge. The Angelenos took a 45-7
spanking from the Stanford Cardinals
as part of the initiation ceremony.
Noah Webster, wordy dean of the
American language, describes the
bruin as an animal that "can move
very rapidly for a short distance, es
pecially on rough ground." If he had
also mentioned the beast's ability to
stage a respectable fight against great
odds he would have practically told
the story of Saturday's game.
