# The
						Finest Stanford Spirit
## 
### 
What Stanford means to the Stanford man was disclosed in a notable
way by Dean Culver at the Matriculation service yesterday. Certainly,
many students have spent four or five years here and not realized what
an intimate part of themselves Stanford is; only after they are graduated
do they feel the pangs of poignant memory upon recalling some campus
place of beauty or some adventure experienced during the golden days.
Perhaps when one thinks of Stanford he has an image of red tile rim
ming the sky at dusk; or of flying white figures opening a hole in the
California line large enough for him to get through and away; or of a
white-haired professor catching and imparting to him the essence of
Plato. Whatever visions one has, they are the fruit of enjoyment of the
life which the University oilers, something to remain with one when the
binomial theorem is gone.
The Dean, upon recommending that students develop this spiritual
(and rightly so called) part of their life at Stanford, declared that it is
not the University's purpose to graduate "well-trained athletes" or "social
floorworkers, with the world as their little aisles," but men and women
with fine sensibilities for intangible beauty. lie declared himself in favor
of President Wilbur's amusing theory, that it would be preferable for
young people to know the significance of the growth-rings of a tree
rather than to know the names and dispositions of the wives of Henry
VIII. Little, indeed, do we know of nature, physical or spiritual, that is
ours. But at Stanford, we ought to heed Dean Culver and consciously
seek to get that spirit which is everywhere, although it shrinks from
naming.
