A holdover recently declared that he did not go out for an athletic
managership or for the Daily staff when he was an underclassman be
cause he heard that pull alone would get him anywhere, and he did not

student activities, and it is generally conceded that pull counts for little
in the choice of athletic managers; that it is negligible on the Daily we
know. With an open conscience we can urge freshmen and members of
the other classes, particularly transfers, to try out for the editorial staff
this quarter. The tryouts commence today at 1 o'clock. Those who have
the ability to do the work which has to be done on the paper will make
the grade and be allowed to participate in what the Daily modestly
considers one of the best activities on the campus.
