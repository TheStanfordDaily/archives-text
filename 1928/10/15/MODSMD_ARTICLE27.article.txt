Christopher Morely has remarked of the late Jack Conway, Broadway
dramatic critic, that "he is the most pilfered-from author in America."
This will readily be granted when it is understood that Conway is author
of the following gems of slang, among others:
Weak heart—"A bum ticker." Sophistry—"Baloney"
Third rater —"A palooka." Easy—"Pushover."
Get out '.—"Scram." Hoi Polloi—"Peasants."
Hearty mirth—"Belly laugh." The haughty—"High hats."
Conway also is credited with having said of a fistic bout that "Demp
sey will knock him stiffer than a dress-shirt." He was a reviewer for
Variety, the trade magazine of vaudeville—and we doubt if there is any
snappier slang published anywhere than that which Variety uses to de
scribe what is happening in the "talkies," on the "legits," and in the
"two-a-day."
Perhaps those 4304 students of the University of California who re
ceived smokeups from the Recorder were "mentally rotten."
