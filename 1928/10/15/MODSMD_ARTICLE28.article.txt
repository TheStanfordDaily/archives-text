Japan and the United States. By
Payson J. Treat. (Stanford Uni
versity Press, 1928.)
The contents of this book were
written by Professor Treat in 1921.
Now he has revised the book and
brought it up to date for publication
this year. It is one of six new titles
listed by the Stanford University I
Press for autumn publication, the
largest group to be added to the press
list since organization of the Publi
cations Department in 1925.
Professor Treat is head of the His- ;
tory Department here at Stanford, 1
and is a leading authority on the Far
East. In "Japan and the United
States" he describes from an unbiased
viewpoint the political, commercial,
and cultural development of Japan
since Commodore Perry's visit. He
also analyzes her present policies,
more particularly as to relations with

the United States. Throughout the
book the author shows the possession
of an intimate knowledge of the situ
ation. There are no hasty conclu
sions, or haphazard statements to be
found.
As to the purpose of the volume I
can do no better than to quote the
author himself as he says, "If these
pages help, in any degree, the read
ers on both sides of the Pacific to
understand better the point of view
of their neighbors, I shall feel richly
repaid."
How refreshing and promising it is
to see writers becoming imbued with
a spirit of internationalism instead
of the old, selfish nationalism; how
reassuring it is to see the fostering
of world peaco, instead of the bilge
(apologies to Mencken) of patriotic
national bigotry.
