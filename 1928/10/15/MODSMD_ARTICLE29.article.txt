MORE MORBID MOVEMENTS
Frank J. Smith, ex-warden of San
Quentin, accepts the chairmanship of
just another League to Abolish Capi
tal Punishment, describing the prac
tice as "that barbarous heritage of
the middle ages," and stating that "I
would like to make it mandatory for
the judge who imposes the sentence
and the jury that brings in the verdict
to be present at every execution."
We fear that our friend Mr. Smith
is getting old. We suggest that while
the League is devoting its collective
talents to Making Life More Liveable
for Criminals, it secure the pardon of
William Hickman in all his paranoia
praecox magnificence, free Irma
what's-a-name (who beats babies'
heads against the wall) and obtain
for her a responsible position as head
nurse in some maternity ward. Such
people would no doubt pat rattle
snakes on the head and reprimand
them for biting folks on the leg.
Some day the League may get the
idea, and begin a move to abolish
hanging... There are a number of ways
to die. Hanging, with all its pomp
and ceremony and nauseating news
paper sob-publicity, with its custom
of allowing the condemned to make
and stretch their own ropes, stuffing
them with fine banquets just before
the trap springs, is au absurd and

horrible modern invention. The same
spirit impels small boys to drown
kittens and watch their convulsions.
It is unbelievable that any society de
liberately authorizes such a practice.
In Nevada, a murderer dies from
lethal gas. He dies thinking it the
scent of almond blossoms. That is
not bad, but the best way, it seems to
us, would be to let the condemned
stand up against a wall like a man,
grin at a firing-squad—and give his
own signal. That is quick and pre
cise and scientific. No trimmings.
The old saloon etiquette was rudi
mentary but good: a man played his
cards square, and maybe his two pair
won; he played 'em crooked, and
Messrs. Colts dealt the next hand.
Some day the League may get the
idea, and begin a movement toward a
Utopia: wherein the criminally anti
social are unostentatiously eradi
cated; wherein children born hor
ribly deformed or diseased, and all
hopelessly insane, excepting those re
served for scientific study, are hu
manely put to death. About that
time the human race might begin to
get somewhere.
But in the meantime society is har
assed by such scissor-bill organiza
tions as the League to Abolish Capital
Punishment.
