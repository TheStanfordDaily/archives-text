The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial of Friday "marvels" i
that the Los Angeles Times does not j
claim Republican responsibility for j
the gratifying population increase of
the past decade. If the Times does
not claim this, Mr. Hoover, at least, |
does. In his speech of acceptance you |
will find the following, "But it is not
through the recitation of wise policies
in government ALONE (the capitals j
are ours) that we demonstrate our !
progress under Republican guidance
—During this less than eight years |
our population has increased by S
per cent."
Is not Mr. Hoover perhaps too san-!
guine about the achievements of the j
Republican administration? Are we j
to infer that biological laws are to be
considered as examples of construc-:
tive Republican legislation?
—Samuel Slaff.
—George Slaff.
The Editor, Sirrah:
Division of profits, the full dinner \
pail, disarmament, prohibition, "fairer j
distribution of offices and honors,"
and other political terms to the con
trary notwithstanding, we must give a
couple of heighos and a yawn, after
reading B.M.'s vitriolic vituperative
of Friday last.
The Constitution of the United
States gives Congress the power to
decide what government in a state is
the proper one. This duty Congress j
turned over to our chief executive, so j
that in time of emergency, quick ac- j
tion might be got. Just as Congress |
turned over this important function, I

jso did the Executive Committee of j
i the A.S.S.U. turn over its function of
j filling a vacancy on the Men's Coun
j cil, to that body itself; that is, it was
I asked to recommend to the Comrnit
| tee the man it thought most capable, ■■
! then the Committee chose to elect
[ that man.
B.M. suggests that one read further '
down and see who was at that par*
I ticular (Executive Committee) meet
ing. I now suggest that B.M. look up |
the membership of Men's Council. He
■ will find that his insidious insinuation ;
| bears no fruit.
} Peanut politicians are so termed !
1 because of their soft shells —easily
| cracked, often crushed, better when
j taken with a little salt.
Surely, 8.M., there are enough good
fellows on the campus. The trouble is,
I most of them don't do anything, so
|no one knows how good they are.
! Let's be concrete. Since we don't
| know who you are, we aren't being
j personal if we ask you if you've done ;
| things around the campus which
j would bring you to the attention of !
the governing body of the campus, or
the eagle eye of the public thereof,
in such a way as to cause them to
consider you seriously for office or
honor? Perhaps you have —this is just
a hypothetical question. But you get
what I mean, don't you?
Frank R. Adams, journalist and erst
while fictionist, epitomizes the mod
j ern woman as: "Bones, vanity, tem- :
j per, full of motions but no emo
i tions ." The peanut politician has
emotions, but no motions.
—Bill Whoopee, Jr.
