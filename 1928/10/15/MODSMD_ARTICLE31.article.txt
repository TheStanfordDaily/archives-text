October 13th.
Did spend the greater part of this
morning in most uncomfortable tears,
and did tear up the enthusiastic let
ters to my family I wrote yesterday
about Stanford, for albeit I received
my first lock-out last night, do not
know if I will long be able to enjoy
the privileges of Stanford University.
And vow I will never trust another
young man's watch again, for my
young escort to the cast dance last
night did swear most sacredly that
we would have time to go down to
the town of Palo Alto for food, and
then did run out of gas on the way
down, and could only restore his mo
tor when I insisted upon walking back
to the main highway and hailing pass
ing cars for a ride home. And am de
termined to carry a large clock about
with me in the evening after this, for
do not dare to trust anything smaller
than a Big Ben after this experience.
He did finally discover a small can
of gasoline in the back of his car,
and we did hurry back to Roble, me,
much alarmed, and he, very dis
gruntled, which was no more than he
should be for his carelessness in not
supplying more fuel for his car, and
do hope that he had to walk home
after he left me. Did watch the lights
of noble flicker as we came up the
road, and did finally get in two min
utes late, and am most miserable,
though the nice sponsor on my cor
ridor did assure me that the House
Committee would be lenient and sym
pathetic.
To the football game this after
noon, after a strenuous morning
! washing my stockings, which do fear
to trust to the laundry, although my
room now looks like a tenement attic
in the worst quarters with its im-

| promptu clotheslines from chair to
chair.
i At the game was edified immensely
by all the Stanford rooters. I did ad-
I mire their haberdasherie most inor
; dinately, and do think I shall give my
i uncle similar ties for Christmas, for
they seemed most cheery.
October 14th, 1928.
i To the library this afternoon, firmly
intending to be as diligent as possible,
and with the memory of my Friday
I night disgrace much in my mind, but
did meet a young man from my Bi-
I ology class in the reading room, and
| so out to supper which was gratify
ing. He did advise me to cultivate
i the acquaintance of the senior men
! on the Varsity football squad, as an
! anonymous donor has given a gold
watch to be awarded to the best of
I character and athletic merit, and
such an expensive watch ought truly
j to keep good time, and save me from
| any other lockouts.
He did also advise me most strong
ly to try out for the staff of the
| Stanford Daily, inasmuch as women
I copy editors and night editors are
! given automatic late leave for work
in the newspaper office. Do wonder
' if the editor would let me write news
!of the football games, for I should
| like very much to sit in the press box
iat the Big Game in November. And
| so to bed.

night did swear most sacredly that
we would have time to go down to
the town of Palo Alto for food, and
then did run out of gas on the way
down, and could only restore his mo
tor when I insisted upon walking back
to the main highway and hailing pass
ing cars for a ride home. And am de
termined to carry a large clock about
with me in the evening after this, for
do not dare to trust anything smaller
than a Big Ben after this experience.
He did finally discover a small can
of gasoline in the back of his car,
and we did hurry back to Roble, me,
much alarmed, and he, very dis
gruntled, which was no more than he
should be for his carelessness in not
supplying more fuel for his car, and
do hope that he had to walk home
after he left me. Did watch the lights
of noble flicker as we came up the
road, and did finally get in two min
utes late, and am most miserable,
though the nice sponsor on my cor
ridor did assure me that the House
Committee would be lenient and sym
pathetic.
To the football game this after
noon, after a strenuous morning
! washing my stockings, which do fear
to trust to the laundry, although my
room now looks like a tenement attic

chair.
i At the game was edified immensely
by all the Stanford rooters. I did ad-
I mire their haberdasherie most inor

they seemed most cheery.

i To the library this afternoon, firmly
intending to be as diligent as possible,
and with the memory of my Friday
I night disgrace much in my mind, but
did meet a young man from my Bi-
I ology class in the reading room, and
| so out to supper which was gratify
ing. He did advise me to cultivate
i the acquaintance of the senior men
! on the Varsity football squad, as an
! anonymous donor has given a gold
watch to be awarded to the best of
I character and athletic merit, and
such an expensive watch ought truly
j to keep good time, and save me from
| any other lockouts.
He did also advise me most strong
ly to try out for the staff of the
| Stanford Daily, inasmuch as women
I copy editors and night editors are
! given automatic late leave for work
in the newspaper office. Do wonder
' if the editor would let me write news
!of the football games, for I should
| like very much to sit in the press box
iat the Big Game in November. And
| so to bed.
October 13th.
Did spend the greater part of this
morning in most uncomfortable tears,
and did tear up the enthusiastic let
ters to my family I wrote yesterday
about Stanford, for albeit I received
my first lock-out last night, do not
know if I will long be able to enjoy
the privileges of Stanford University.
And vow I will never trust another
young man's watch again, for my
young escort to the cast dance last
night did swear most sacredly that
we would have time to go down to
the town of Palo Alto for food, and
then did run out of gas on the way
down, and could only restore his mo
