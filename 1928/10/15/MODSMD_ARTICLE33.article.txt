# MERITS OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE CITED
## Club Correspondent Gives Reasons for Support of Hoover In November Presidential Election 
### HERBERT WENIG 
(Editor's Note: The political
clubs have taken advantage of
the Daily's offer to admit them to
its columns for the dissemination
of their views. Today, a spokes
man of the Hoover Club con
tributes; tomorrow the Smith
Club will be heard from; and
Wednesday, the Thomas Club.
Then the cycle will start again.)

Hoover-Smith-Tliomas: opposite the
names of the electors supporting
these three men the voters of the
country on November 6, next, will
place their marks of approval. It is
not until a presidential election is
being held that the average college
man or woman shows any decided in
terest in politics. Here at Stanford
this ordinary concern is intensified by
the fact that a Stanford graduate,
Herbert Hoover, is the nominee of
the Republican Party. However, it is
not upon this ground alone that we
seek the support of the student body.
If after a consideration of the person
alities of the three candidates one
perceives the superior worth and fit
ness of Herbert Hoover, then indeed
the fact that he belongs to Stanford
is certainly an additional reason for
satisfaction and enthusiasm. On the
other hand the Hoover Club welcomes
the formation of the Smith and
Thomas clubs. Such organizations are
formed with that spirit of intellectual
discussion that has always typified
Stanford thought./ With this scientific
attitude, discussion will be based on
the personalities of the men and the
issues involved. Prejudice, bigotry,
and emotion should have no place in
a debate amongst university men or
women.
At the outset the whispering cam
paigns should be denounced. Un
founded statements and malicious
stories are being leveled at the candi
dates. This is a regrettable thing in
politics. The anti-Hoover whisperings
are many and varied in nature. That
Hoover erected a sign on his farm in
Kern county telling all white labor
to keep out, that he got his financial
start by fleecing Chinese companies
of which he was at one time a di
rector, that he applied for British
citizenship, and that if elected he will
make us eat brown bread are some
of the "best" stories. Such accusa- j
tions even though spoken in under-j
tones in good company do not even ;
merit a denial. These tales have been
heard before. Whenever needed, de
spite the fact that they have been

completely refuted, they are taken
down from the shelf, dusted off, and
ÜBed again. If they deserve any re
spect it is only that which is the
privilege of old age. Likewise we are
unwilling to give credence to the
stories concerning the dark purpose
in the Democratic Party's nominee's
candidacy. And even though the whis
perings may be more injurious to the
New York governor we denounce
them as unsportsmanlike, ignorant,
and un-American.
Let us remember, too, that the ideas
and opinions of the Thomas men will
be published in these columns and
equal consideration should be ac
corded their views.
The Smith Club, through one of its
spokesmen, stated in the Stanford
Daily 011 Wednesday last that the
club did not propose to "attack
Hoover but to support Smith strongly
in the belief that he was the better
man for the job." This plan, contradic
tory to customary Democratic action,
is most welcome. If the forthcoming
discussions are to be based on the
contrasting merits of the candidates,
if there is to be constructive thought
rather than mere destructive criti
cism, then the Stanford-for-Hoover
Club enters the political arena with
the utmost confidence, feeling that
when the white light of logic is cast
on the contestants rather than the
red glare of sarcasm and innuendo
the supreme and superior capability,
and the "solid tangible worth of Her
bert Hoover will appear. We wish to
cast no shadow on Governor Alfred
E. Smith. We recognize that he has
been an able and constructive gover
nor of New York State; but unfor
tunately in this election he is running
against Herbert Hoover, the great
leader of this new day when effi
ciency. expert knowledge of problems,
and ability, coupled with liumanness,
are the necessary qualities of an out
standing executive.
We believe in Herbert Hoover be
cause lie, of all men in America today,
gives the best promise of settling the
problems our nation must face in the
next four years. As an authority 011
the economic affairs of the nation, as
a liberal in the fullest sense of the
word, who tempers his idealism witn
an understanding of what can be
achieved, as a genius of administra
tion, as a great humanitarian, and as
a citizen of the world, we support
Herbert Hoover for the presidency of
the United States.

Hoover-Smith-Tliomas: opposite the
names of the electors supporting
these three men the voters of the
country on November 6, next, will
place their marks of approval. It is
not until a presidential election is
being held that the average college
man or woman shows any decided in
terest in politics. Here at Stanford
this ordinary concern is intensified by
the fact that a Stanford graduate,
Herbert Hoover, is the nominee of
the Republican Party. However, it is
not upon this ground alone that we
seek the support of the student body.
If after a consideration of the person
alities of the three candidates one
perceives the superior worth and fit
ness of Herbert Hoover, then indeed
the fact that he belongs to Stanford
is certainly an additional reason for
satisfaction and enthusiasm. On the
other hand the Hoover Club welcomes
the formation of the Smith and
Thomas clubs. Such organizations are
formed with that spirit of intellectual
discussion that has always typified
Stanford thought./ With this scientific
attitude, discussion will be based on
the personalities of the men and the
issues involved. Prejudice, bigotry,
and emotion should have no place in
a debate amongst university men or
women.
At the outset the whispering cam
paigns should be denounced. Un
founded statements and malicious
stories are being leveled at the candi
dates. This is a regrettable thing in
politics. The anti-Hoover whisperings
are many and varied in nature. That
Hoover erected a sign on his farm in
Kern county telling all white labor
to keep out, that he got his financial
start by fleecing Chinese companies
of which he was at one time a di
rector, that he applied for British
citizenship, and that if elected he will
make us eat brown bread are some
of the "best" stories. Such accusa- j
tions even though spoken in under-j
tones in good company do not even ;
merit a denial. These tales have been
heard before. Whenever needed, de
spite the fact that they have been

completely refuted, they are taken
down from the shelf, dusted off, and
ÜBed again. If they deserve any re
spect it is only that which is the
privilege of old age. Likewise we are
unwilling to give credence to the
stories concerning the dark purpose
in the Democratic Party's nominee's
candidacy. And even though the whis
perings may be more injurious to the
New York governor we denounce
them as unsportsmanlike, ignorant,
and un-American.
Let us remember, too, that the ideas
and opinions of the Thomas men will
be published in these columns and
equal consideration should be ac
corded their views.
The Smith Club, through one of its
spokesmen, stated in the Stanford
Daily 011 Wednesday last that the
club did not propose to "attack
Hoover but to support Smith strongly
in the belief that he was the better
man for the job." This plan, contradic
tory to customary Democratic action,
is most welcome. If the forthcoming
discussions are to be based on the
contrasting merits of the candidates,
if there is to be constructive thought
rather than mere destructive criti
cism, then the Stanford-for-Hoover
Club enters the political arena with
the utmost confidence, feeling that
when the white light of logic is cast
on the contestants rather than the
red glare of sarcasm and innuendo
the supreme and superior capability,
and the "solid tangible worth of Her
bert Hoover will appear. We wish to
cast no shadow on Governor Alfred
E. Smith. We recognize that he has
been an able and constructive gover
nor of New York State; but unfor
tunately in this election he is running
against Herbert Hoover, the great
leader of this new day when effi
ciency. expert knowledge of problems,
and ability, coupled with liumanness,
are the necessary qualities of an out
standing executive.

cast no shadow on Governor Alfred

against Herbert Hoover, the great
leader of this new day when effi

and ability, coupled with liumanness,

the economic affairs of the nation, as
a liberal in the fullest sense of the
word, who tempers his idealism witn

Herbert Hoover for the presidency of
the United States.

the Daily's offer to admit them to

Then the cycle will start again.)

Hoover-Smith-Tliomas: opposite the
names of the electors supporting
these three men the voters of the
country on November 6, next, will
place their marks of approval. It is
not until a presidential election is
being held that the average college
man or woman shows any decided in
terest in politics. Here at Stanford
this ordinary concern is intensified by
the fact that a Stanford graduate,
Herbert Hoover, is the nominee of
the Republican Party. However, it is
not upon this ground alone that we
seek the support of the student body.
If after a consideration of the person
alities of the three candidates one
perceives the superior worth and fit
ness of Herbert Hoover, then indeed
the fact that he belongs to Stanford
is certainly an additional reason for
satisfaction and enthusiasm. On the
other hand the Hoover Club welcomes
the formation of the Smith and
Thomas clubs. Such organizations are
formed with that spirit of intellectual
discussion that has always typified
Stanford thought./ With this scientific
attitude, discussion will be based on
the personalities of the men and the
issues involved. Prejudice, bigotry,
and emotion should have no place in
a debate amongst university men or
women.
At the outset the whispering cam
paigns should be denounced. Un
founded statements and malicious
stories are being leveled at the candi
dates. This is a regrettable thing in
politics. The anti-Hoover whisperings
are many and varied in nature. That
Hoover erected a sign on his farm in
Kern county telling all white labor
to keep out, that he got his financial
start by fleecing Chinese companies
of which he was at one time a di
rector, that he applied for British
citizenship, and that if elected he will
make us eat brown bread are some
of the "best" stories. Such accusa- j
tions even though spoken in under-j
tones in good company do not even ;
merit a denial. These tales have been
heard before. Whenever needed, de
spite the fact that they have been

completely refuted, they are taken
down from the shelf, dusted off, and
ÜBed again. If they deserve any re
spect it is only that which is the
privilege of old age. Likewise we are
unwilling to give credence to the
stories concerning the dark purpose
in the Democratic Party's nominee's
candidacy. And even though the whis
perings may be more injurious to the
New York governor we denounce
them as unsportsmanlike, ignorant,
and un-American.
Let us remember, too, that the ideas
and opinions of the Thomas men will
be published in these columns and
equal consideration should be ac
corded their views.
The Smith Club, through one of its
spokesmen, stated in the Stanford
Daily 011 Wednesday last that the
club did not propose to "attack
Hoover but to support Smith strongly
in the belief that he was the better
man for the job." This plan, contradic
tory to customary Democratic action,
is most welcome. If the forthcoming
discussions are to be based on the
contrasting merits of the candidates,
if there is to be constructive thought
rather than mere destructive criti
cism, then the Stanford-for-Hoover
Club enters the political arena with
the utmost confidence, feeling that
when the white light of logic is cast
on the contestants rather than the
red glare of sarcasm and innuendo
the supreme and superior capability,
and the "solid tangible worth of Her
bert Hoover will appear. We wish to
cast no shadow on Governor Alfred
