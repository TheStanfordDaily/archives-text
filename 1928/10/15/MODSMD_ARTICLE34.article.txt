# FRESHMEN WHIP JUNIOR COLLEGE ELEVEN, 33 TO 0
## Rintala Stars as Powerful Yearling Team Crushes Pasadena Invaders 
### 
Showing the same speed and power
that have enabled them to record a
tie and two wins in previous starts
this year, the Cardinal freshman grid
ders crushed the defense of the Pasa
dena Junior College eleven and
romped through to a 33 to 0 victory
here Saturday, bringing their point
total for the season to 122 as com
pared with 6 scored against them.
The Stanford offense was working
to perfection and the defense was
adequate to prevent' a Pasadena
score. The visitors' only threat came
in the third quarter when three long
passes carried the ball from the
Pasadena thirty-yard line to the Card
twenty-yard line. Two line bucks ad
vanced the ball to the Stanford ten
yard line and gave Pasadena another
first down. Here the freshman line
settled down to business and pre
vented any gain on three successive
line plunges, the ball going over to
Stanford on an incomplete pass over
the goal line.
Rintala Stars
The yearling scoring started in the
first quarter when a long pass, Rintala
to Wilson, put the ball on the Pasa
dena forty-yard line. A series of re
verses, line plunges, and tackle
around plays carried the ball to the
two-yard line from where Cadell, full
back, took it across the goal line.
Grey converted to make the score
Stanford 7, Pasadena 0.
In the next quarter after a few min
utes of play, Rudy Rintala, freshman
left halfback, received a punt on his
own thirty-five-yard line, twisted out
of the grasp of several Pasadena tack
lers who were upon him, and raced
Bixty-five yards for a touchdown, re
versing his field twice in so doing.
Rintala is one of the shiftiest and
fastest open field runners ever to
play on a freshman team here and
has looked better in each succeeding
game this year.
Another touchdown in this period
and one in each of the following quar
ters completed the scoring, passes
proving unusually effective.
Play Second String
It was a second-string backfield, in
the main, that represented the fresh
men Saturday. Marks, quarterback,
suffered a minor injury in the first
few minutes of play and was replaced
by Thigpin. Itintnla, after being the

mainstay of the freshman offense for
three quarters, was taken out with an
injured leg in the final period and
Arnold sent in. Dusty Allen, regular
fullback, was on the sick list all last
week and did not start the game,
Cadell performing ably in his place.
Wilson, right halfback, was the only
first-string backfield man to play the
entire game. He played his usual con
sistent game, punting well and carry
ing the ball effectively.
Line Strong
The whole Stanford line performed
creditably, outcharging the opposing
line on almost every play. Doub at
right tackle, Toepke at left guard,
and Colvin at left end looked particu
larly good. Colvin is a heavy end
and can smear the interference and
get the ball-carrier whenever they
come his way.
Thorpe, left end, and Thompson,
right halfback, of Pasadena, were the
passing combination which almost ac
counted for a score for the visitors in
the third quarter.
