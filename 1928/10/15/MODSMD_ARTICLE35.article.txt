# AFFLICTION PRIZED BY BLIND UTAH REPORTER
## 
### 
Bramwell Peck, reporter on the
Cache Valley Herald of Logan, Utah,
has been blind for fifteen years and
prizes his affliction as his biggest as
set in the daily associations of his
work. He sees his advantage in that
he can ask questions without seeming
ridiculous, and, since he does not see,
people are always ready to explain
even the most minute details.
Peck has many seemingly uncanny
faculties. His typewritten copy is
free from errors, he remembers every
telephone number he has ever called,
and every day he goes out into the
streets, finding out through conver
sation what local and personal items
are available.
