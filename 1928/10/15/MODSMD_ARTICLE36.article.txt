# SPORTS OF 1928
## Onward Christian Cagle 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Somehow I have an idea that you ;
are going to hear a lot about a young
man by the name of Cagle this fall.
His first name is Christian, but the
things he does to an opposing eleven
are far from Christian-like. Not that
he isn't a good sport, for he is, and j
then some, but the way he evades
would-be tacklers by twisting, dodg
ing, straight-arming, hurdling, or rid- 1
ing roughshod over them, is nobody's
Christian business.
Having recently seen the thrilling ;
14 to 13 victory of the Army Mule j
over the Mustangs of Southern Meth- i
odist University, I can state quite em- j
phatically that this Cagle person is '
one whale of a good running back, |
and that when Coach "Biff" Jones
yanked Mr. Cagle in the second quar- !
ter, the boys from Dalkis did much
better against the Army than when
the red-headed halfback was in the
game.

| Yes, red-headed is right, another
"Galloping Ghost," and the only thing
that's missing is the big number 77
t on the back of his sweater. In scoring
his team's first touchdown, the un-
Christian-like Cagle first threw a 30-
yard pass to C'almark which put the
: ball on the 28-year line, and then he
j shot through tackle on a cut-back play
and dove across the final chalk mark
jwith a couple of wild Mustangs cling
ing to him. All in all, he gave a
, superb exhibition of shifty running,
: picked his openings cleverly, and
; proved himself an extremely hard
i man to bring down.
Besides his fine ball-carrying, Cagle
! can punt fifty yards at a clip and
! throw forward passes all over the lot.
Gerald Mann, Southern Methodist
flash of a year ago who featured the
East-West Ail-Star game in San Fran
cisco at Christmas time, rates Cagle
'way above Bruce Caldwell, Yale's
i Ail-American back of 1927.
