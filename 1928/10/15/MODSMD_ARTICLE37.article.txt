For the information of the inter
ested Daily subscriber of Mayfield
who made the inquiry concerning the
Cardinal Chess Club, the following in
formation is submitted:
The Cardinal Chess Club became a
defunct organization in the spring of
1926 after a series of disastrous de
feats at the hands of California chess
men.
In 1910 a Stanford-California chess
trophy was offered which was to be
come the permanent possession of the
club winning it four successive times.
Back in 1923, after the battle for its
possession had surged back and forth
for over a decade, California began
to sweep the Cardinal men off the
boards —and they continued to sweep
with tragic regularity.
Came the eventful night of April 8,
1926, when the Bears invaded the j
Stanford campus for the death strug
gle. The battle was staged at the
Union and the Golden Bear made its
kill, winning the trophy permanently.
The philosophical Cards resigned
themselves to their fate and the
Cardinal Chess Club expired as grace
fully as possible under the circum
stances. However, it is believed that
various individuals still play chess in
the vicinity of the Union.
