Unless Nibs Price was holding his |
charges in check Saturday, when his j
j Bear machine tangled with the Wash
ington State Cougars, the California
varsity is riding for a long, hard fall
, when it meets the Sons of Troy this
week-end. And another long, hard fall
i looms for the Berkeley team in the
i Big Game.
Even in a 13 to 3 victory the
Golden Bear didn't cover itself
with glory Saturday. Displaying
a surprising lack of power on the
offense, the Blue and Gold war
riors were a disappointment to
the most ardent California sup
porter.
The Bears fought, of course. They
always do. And there were occasions
when their striped jerseys swept 1
down the field as they were wont to
I do in those rosy days of yore. On the
| whole, however, U.C. presented but a J
j feeble reflection of that past glory. I
On defense the Californians
were strong enough, but very lit
tle stronger than their northern
rivals. Defensive playing, how
ever, seldom wins football games,
and unless Price can develop, or
uncover, a more potent scoring
drive, the Bears are likely to be
just another California team.
There is always the possibility, of I
J course, that Mr. Price is holding his 1
warriors in check, and that against
I U.S.C. and Stanford the Berkeley co- J
liorts will be a different machine. Cer
j tainly, the Bear coach will have to do 1
a lot of unchecking if his eleven is to
win from either the Cards or the Tro
i
jans.
Saturday's game was an interesting
one to watch. The Cougars and the
Bears were about on a par in the
matter of offense, and the battle was
full of thrilling breaks. Both outfits
really fought, and fought to the last I
ditch.
Lom and Rice and Riegels
looked like the genuine stuff for
California. One of Lom's kicks
was superb, a feature of the game.
It was a beautiful long spiral, |
booted from behind the California
goal line, soaring a good sixty
yards through the ether.
Lainhart, at half for W.S.C., played
sweet football except when he tried
to kick the oval. He and the other
Washington hooters established some
thing of a record in the matter of
j blocked punts. Six Cougar kicks were
spoiled by charging California players.
"Meg" Dressel, giant northern
tackle, stood head and shoulders
above the linesmen of both teams.
He was like the proverbial Rock
of Gibraltar on the defense, and
Washington's gains through Cali
fornia's line were almost invari- |
ably through his position. Dressel
is undoubtedly one of the'great
i esta tcakles in the West. It will
be interesting to compare his play
with that of Jess Hibbs when the i

Cougars meet the Trojans.
It is unfortunate that California
cannot devise some way of keeping
j the stadium field in a decent condi
i tion. The grass stood in forlorn j
patches in a sea of dirt. A certain I
portain of the erratic showing made !
! by both outfits might be attributed" to j
this. Often a back would slip and fall
, just as he was getting away for what j
i promised to be a nice gain,
j Anyway, Stanford fans may well
watch with interest the Bear eleven '
I when it battles U.S.C. next Saturday.
1 If California wins it will be a miracle
or it will mean that Nibs Price is a ,
genius at uncovering hidden power in 1
the short space of a week.
