## 
### 
"Life Among the Arabs of French
North Africa" will be the topic of the
lecture by Professor Edward Maslin
Hulme, of the Department of History, ;
tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall.
Professor Hulme traveled in three
French African provinces, Tunisia,
Algeria, and Morocco, during the first
two or three months of this year, and
came into close contact with the ;
Arabs. Natives of these countries are
divided into two distinct groups, des
ert Arabs and those of the oases and 1
towns, and differ in blood, occupation, j
and characteristics. Professor Hulme 1
found occasion to study both types.
It is very easy to meet the town
dwellers of the three provinces, de- :
dares the lecturer, but to find the
desert tribes one must go to the oases !
where the railroads end and the cara- |
vans come to meet them. Many of
the townsmen speak French, and it 1
is possible to talk to the desert men
with the aid of a boy who lives in
an oasis or town and has been to a
French school.
During his travels Professor Hulme
lived in five oases, one of which was
250 miles out in the Sahara desert,
and became well acquainted with the
natives. In his talk tomorrow night
he plans to tell what kind of people
the Arabs are.
