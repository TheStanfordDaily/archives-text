# PACIFIC BIG FOUR UNCONQUERED AS THIRD WEEK ENDS
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14. (/P)—
The "Big Four" of the Pacific Coast
Conference — Stanford, Washington,
Southern California, and California —
are running true to form again and
the end of the third week of the 1928
football campaign finds the quartet as
the only undefeated elevens of the
Conference.
Washington and California made
first Conference appearances success
fully, the former whipping Montana,
25-0, and California turning back
Washington State, 13-3. Montana held
its northern rival on even terms for
the opening quarter but crumbled in
the second before the powerful Husky
attack.
The California Bears went into the
undefeated column but had a terrific
struggle with Washington State. Alert
playing on the part of the Bears plus
loose work on W.S.C.'s side decided
the contest. Washington State totaled
more yards from scrimmage and made
nearly twice as many first downs.
Last week the Staters defeated Mon
tana, 26-6.
The largest crowd on the Coast,
about 45,000 persons, saw the invad
ing St. Mary's College team defeated
by Southern California's Trojans,
19-3. It was a non-conference game. A
week ago, the Trojans disposed of
Oregon State, 19-0, to win their first
Conference start.
Oregon State, Idaho, and Oregon all
enjoyed walkaways over non-confer
ence opponents. Oregon State cap
tured a double-header, drubbing
Columbia, 41-0, and Pacific, 46-0. Idaho
walloped Whitman, 26-12, and Oregon
sent Willamette on its way with a
38-0 defeat.
