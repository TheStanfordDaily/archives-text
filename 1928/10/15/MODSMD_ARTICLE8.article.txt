# Queen's Husband Repeats Success In Third Showing
## Gordon Davis' Portrayal of King Eric Outstanding; Lines Well Timed 
### KATHLEEN FITZ 
That anything worth doing once is
; worth doing again was signally dem
onstrated last Friday night when
"The Queen's Husband" was as en
thusiastically received for the third
performance as for the first. The
chief charm of Sherwood's political
comedy lies in the nicely turned
irony and satire in the dialogue, and
the subtle nyances of character inflec
tion —particularly prominent in Gor
don Davis' inimitable portrayal of
King Eric VIII.
Gordon Davis directed the show as
well as carrying the title role, and is
to be complimented for the well-timed
i rhythm of speech and action through
-1 out. He set the quick-moving tempo,
which was well maintained, except
for a few minor instances. Comedy,
particularly fast comedy, is one of
the most difficult forms of the drama
j for amateurs to attempt, and Friday
night's success is proportionately de
j serving of praise.
As was anticipated, Gordon Davis
■ was far and away the star of the per
; formance. He played the king with
j marvelous insight, completely re
laxed, yet with that professional qual
ity of restraint that when released
tops a situation with direct power.
His entrances and exits were man
aged with that easy flow of movement
I which marks a finished characteriza
-1 tion. Campus and peninsula audiences
will wait with interest for his next
appearance.
One of the most outstanding inter
pretations was that of Prince William,
by Irving Rosenblatt. Although he
did not appear until the third act, he
j accomplished so much with a small
i part that his work stood out signally.
Virginia Volland as the queen was
regally stunning, and she has a pleas
ing voice. She handled the part of the
haughty domineering Queen Martha
! ably. Richard Fisher as General
Northrup played a blustery part with
: real conviction. Paul Pfaff's Lord
Burton was appropriately suave.
The ingenue and juvenile leads,
played by Helen Ward and Richard
Stewart, were personally very attrac
tive. They both seemed to lack a cer
tain depth in their characterizations,
however. Helen Ward seemed to
have difficulty in losing her own per
sonality in that of the Princess Anne.
Phipps, by Leavenworth Colby, de
serves special mention, as do Elmo
Robinson and Byron Snow in the
roles of the liberal and anarchist
leaders. Burt Davis played a royal
butler, and Harriet Sutton and Dora
Matfield made charming ladies-in-wait
ing.
Pictorially speaking, the production
was delightful. Harold Helvenston's
set afforded a richness and beauty to 1
the royal apartment that aided the
actors in creating the proper atmos
phere, and certainly the off-stage evi
dences of battle were most realistic.
In all fairness be it said that the
delay in the opening curtain was due
to the tardy arrival of the make-up
man, and not to Helvenston's stage
crew.
In a straw vote conducted in the
University of Colorado, an overwhelm
ing majority was in favor of revision
of the prohibition act.
