Now that (with apologies to Chappie)
The.Cards have made their Conference Debut
a success at the expense of Oregon and
U.C.L.A. and the Frosh are still going along
at a fine rate —may we refer to the weather
—nice in the day but sure fire cold at nite—
how about some
Sweaters Sheepskins Leather Jackets
at at at
$6 to $10 $10.50 $14.50
And don't forget, the smartest thing
this fall! A Trench Coat—
NOTICE!
Due to a manufacturer's error, our $12.50 trench
styled coat is now sold for $9.75 —all those who pur
chased their coats at the old price will please call for
a refund of $2.75. Thanx.
