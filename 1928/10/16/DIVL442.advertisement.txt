CORDS arc skillfully designed and
correctly cut. Economical, too—because they
wear—and wear—and wear.
Straight hang with wide bottoms—not extreme
but up-to-the-minute. Two-inch cuffs. Wide belt
loops. Two front slash pockets, one flap pocket.
Made in light cream college shade —also in a
variety of other colors, both narrow and wide
ribbed corduroy of the finest quality.
