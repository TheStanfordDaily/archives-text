# GRAF ZEPPELIN ENDS PERILOUS JOURNEY SAFELY
## Crowds Break Police Guard When Dirigible Lands; Wind Prevents Ship Going in Berth 
### 
LAKEHURST, N.J., Oct. 15. (jP)—
The German Graf Zeppelin landed on
American soil at 5:38 o'clock this after
noon after a stormy journey of 111
hours and 46 minutes from Friedrichs
liafen.
For three days crowds had been wait
ing at the air station to witness the ar
rival of the greatest airship afloat, but
.all except 5,000 or so had given up the
vigil when the ship arrived.
Those few thousand, however, were
so eager to see the airship that they
broke through police lines and fought for
the opportunity to touch the dirigible
-or at least get close enough to shout
greetings to passengers and crew.
The Graf Zeppelin appeared first as a
faint smudge low above the northern
•horizon. Slowly, as daylight began to
fail, it took definite form although its
metalled coat remained dim gray in the
dusk. Half again as big as the Los
Angeles, which completed a similar
journey just four years ago today, the
-Graf Zeppelin seemed to swell as it
approached until it blotted out half the
sky.
Observe Damaged Fin
When the dirigible dropped out of the
skies for its first rest on American soil
■observers on the ground could plainly
see the damaged fin which caused so
much anxiety ashore two days ago when
Commander Rosendahl wirelessed ask
ing that ships stand by in case the damage
should prove serious. The fabric was
torn from the underside of the fin so
that the framework could be seen.
The roar of the five 550-horsepower
•engines seemed to make the air vibrate
and the sliding ship in a moment be
came a gray arrow shooting through the
•darkness.
Ship Not Moored at Mast
Contrary to expectation, the ship was
-not moored at the mast, ropes being
dropped to a landing crew of 500 sailors
who drew the ship gently to the ground.

As customs agents boarded the ship,
as they do any docking Atlantic liner,
the crowd's enthusiasm boiled over and
police lines melted before the rush.
There was scuffling and rough and
tumble encounters in plenty before order
Avas restored.
Because of a 12-mile wind across the
hangar it was decided at last not to
berth the ship last night. The passen
gers were taken out and escorted under
guard to the hangar and the dirigible
was taken to the stub mast close to the
high mooring tower where it was at
tached to swing gently through the dark
hours.

the crowd's enthusiasm boiled over and
police lines melted before the rush.
There was scuffling and rough and
tumble encounters in plenty before order
Avas restored.
Because of a 12-mile wind across the
hangar it was decided at last not to
berth the ship last night. The passen
gers were taken out and escorted under
guard to the hangar and the dirigible
was taken to the stub mast close to the
high mooring tower where it was at
tached to swing gently through the dark
hours.
LAKEHURST, N.J., Oct. 15. (jP)—
The German Graf Zeppelin landed on
American soil at 5:38 o'clock this after
noon after a stormy journey of 111
hours and 46 minutes from Friedrichs
liafen.
For three days crowds had been wait
ing at the air station to witness the ar
rival of the greatest airship afloat, but
.all except 5,000 or so had given up the
vigil when the ship arrived.
Those few thousand, however, were
so eager to see the airship that they
broke through police lines and fought for
the opportunity to touch the dirigible
-or at least get close enough to shout
greetings to passengers and crew.
The Graf Zeppelin appeared first as a
faint smudge low above the northern
•horizon. Slowly, as daylight began to
fail, it took definite form although its
metalled coat remained dim gray in the
dusk. Half again as big as the Los
Angeles, which completed a similar
journey just four years ago today, the
-Graf Zeppelin seemed to swell as it
approached until it blotted out half the
sky.
Observe Damaged Fin
When the dirigible dropped out of the
skies for its first rest on American soil
■observers on the ground could plainly
see the damaged fin which caused so
much anxiety ashore two days ago when
Commander Rosendahl wirelessed ask
ing that ships stand by in case the damage
should prove serious. The fabric was
torn from the underside of the fin so
that the framework could be seen.
The roar of the five 550-horsepower
•engines seemed to make the air vibrate
and the sliding ship in a moment be
came a gray arrow shooting through the
•darkness.
Ship Not Moored at Mast
Contrary to expectation, the ship was
-not moored at the mast, ropes being
dropped to a landing crew of 500 sailors
who drew the ship gently to the ground.

As customs agents boarded the ship,
as they do any docking Atlantic liner,
the crowd's enthusiasm boiled over and
police lines melted before the rush.

tumble encounters in plenty before order
