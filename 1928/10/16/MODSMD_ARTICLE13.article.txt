# DRIVERS ON FLYING FIELD RUN RISK OF FINE, IMPRISONMENT
## 
### 
Anyone driving across the
landing field at the Palo Alto
School of Aviation on the cam
pus is subject to a Federal fine
of fifiOO plus ninety days in jail.
Lieutenant Norman Goddard
has made this announcement,
and says that while visitors are
welcome, they must be careful
to approach the hangar only
from the highway.
Students too often come roar
ing out across the field just when
some beginner above them is
trying to bring down his first
plane. The driver of the automo
bile cannot see a plane over the
trees a mile away which will
come down in a minute's time,
and pilots have a blind spot in
front of them, due to the posi
tion of the motor. The result is
a dangerous situation for both.
