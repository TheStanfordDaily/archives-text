# Ninety-Eight To Report At Next Drama Tryouts
## Gordon Davis Pleased With Large Turnout; Finds Good New Material 
### 
Ninety-eight students survived the first
tryouts for parts in the Sword and
Sandals' play, "The Devil in the Cheese."
Gordon Davis says it was the largest
turnout in years for preliminary dramatic
trials and that he wants all those who
were selected to tryout for the second
time today, either in the Assembly Hall
between 3 and 5 o'clock or in the Little
Theater between 7 and 9 o'clock.

Also, all students who did not try out
yesterday are urged by Davis to attend
the second trials today. Because of the
limited number of parts in this next pro
duction, many whom Davis considered
excellent material were not asked to
make a second tryout, but he said that
there should be places for them in later
plays, and for this reason should try for
them later on. He was particularly
pleased with the promising material in
the sophomore class.

Twenty-four women are selected for
second tryouts. They are : Betty Alden,
Muriel Bartlett, Lillian Boyce, Louise

Gordon Davis says it was the largest
turnout in years for preliminary dramatic
trials and that he wants all those who
were selected to tryout for the second
time today, either in the Assembly Hall
between 3 and 5 o'clock or in the Little
Theater between 7 and 9 o'clock.

Also, all students who did not try out
yesterday are urged by Davis to attend
the second trials today. Because of the
limited number of parts in this next pro
duction, many whom Davis considered
excellent material were not asked to
make a second tryout, but he said that
there should be places for them in later
plays, and for this reason should try for
them later on. He was particularly
pleased with the promising material in
the sophomore class.

second tryouts. They are : Betty Alden,
Muriel Bartlett, Lillian Boyce, Louise
