# HERBERT HOOVER ASSAILS DEMOCRATS ON TARIFF POLICY IN BOSTON SPEECH
## Republican Candidate Urges Government Promotion Of Foreign Trade, Sea Traffic 
### 
BOSTON, Oct. 15. (#>)—Herbert
Hoover struck out at the opposition
here tonight in a manner unprece
dented in his campaign for the presi
dency, assailing in blunt terms the
tariff formula laid down in the Demo
cratic platform.

Speaking to the country generally,
but to industrial New England in par
ticular, the Republican candidate de
clared that the adjustment of impost
duties by the Democratic formula of
"effective competition" would mean
"a reduction of the tariff and a de
pression in American wages and
American farm prices."

"It means," he said, "a flood of for
| eign goods, of foreign farm produce,
! and consequent reduction of wages
and incomes not only of workers and
farmers, but the whole of those who
labor, whether in the field, the bench,
or the desk."
Without referring even indirectly to
I the Democratic presidential nominee,
I Hoover stated his own position with
respect to the tariff commission,
! about which Alfred E. Smith spoke
at some length at Louisville last Sat
urday night.
Lauds Tariff Commission
"The tariff commission is a valu-
I able arm of the government," the Re-
{ publican candidate said. "It can be
j strengthened and made more useful
lin several ways. But the American
people will never consent to delegat
, ing authority over the tariff to any
i commission, whether non-partisan or
bi-partisan. Our people have a right
!to express themselves at the ballot
i upon so vital a question as this.

The tariff formed the keystone of
i the third Eastern speech of the Re
publican standard-bearer, but he also
dealt with government promotion of
j the nation's foreign trade and the
maintenance of an adequate merchant
marine by private enterprise with the
assistance and co-operation of the
j government.
Auxiliary to these he declared in
j favor of private loans to foreign coun-
I tries to aid in stabilization abroad;
! against any cancellation of war debts,
; disputing the theory that their ulti
mate payment must be made in goods
i which would replace the output of
' American farms and factories, and for
the protection of American citizens
and their property abroad and the
! protection of foreign citizens within
; the borders of the United States.
Hoover's whole speech was devoted
1 to economic questions upon the sound
solution of which, he said, "depends
! our prosperity, our standards of liv
ing, and the opportunities for a fuller
life to every home."
Stresses Protective Tariff
"One of the most important eco
nomic issues of this campaign is the
i protective tariff," he said. "The Re
publican Party has for seventy years
supported a tariff designed to give
j adequate protection to American la-
I bor, American industry, and the
| American farm against foreign com-
I petition."
Hoover asserted that not only had
j actual experience refuted all of the
Democratic predictions of calamity
attending the operation of the present
Republican tariff, but that it had been
accompanied by employment and
prosperity as well as by vast in
creases both in imports and exports.
Stressing the importance of foreign
trade, the nominee said that to insure
continuous employment and maintain
American wages a profitable market
must be found for the surplus produc
tions in this country both of manu
factures and farm produce. He re
viewed the steps taken by the gov
ernment through the Department of
Commerce to find markets and in co
operating with manufacturers and ex
porters "in laying out and executing
strategic plans for expanding our for
eign trade with all nations and in all
directions."
Issues Are Not Local
Summing up what he described as
"The thought I should like to leave
with you," Hoover said:
"I have talked to you about the
tariff, about international trade, the
merchant marine, and other economic
forces which may, at first glance,
seem far removed from our daily
lives. I have tried to make the point
that these subjects are no longer re
mote from any one of you. The time
may have been, as someone once said,
when the tariff was a local issue or
foreign trade and shipping concerned
only the local seaports.
"It is so no longer. Touch the tariff
on textiles and North Carolina feels
the blighting influence as quickly as
Massachusetts. Nor does it stop there.
The farmer finds a diminished market
in lessened demand caused by lower
wages.
"Unsettle the credit structure, and
it is not Wall Street that suffers most;
it is the little bank, the little facory,
the little farm, the modest home.
"A shortage of shipping to the Gulf
ports at once decreases prices to the
farmer in Kansas, for he must take
more extensive routes to foreign mar
kets.

BOSTON, Oct. 15. (#>)—Herbert
Hoover struck out at the opposition
here tonight in a manner unprece
dented in his campaign for the presi
dency, assailing in blunt terms the
tariff formula laid down in the Demo
cratic platform.

Speaking to the country generally,
but to industrial New England in par
ticular, the Republican candidate de
clared that the adjustment of impost
duties by the Democratic formula of
"effective competition" would mean
"a reduction of the tariff and a de
pression in American wages and
American farm prices."

"It means," he said, "a flood of for
| eign goods, of foreign farm produce,
! and consequent reduction of wages
and incomes not only of workers and
farmers, but the whole of those who
labor, whether in the field, the bench,
or the desk."
Without referring even indirectly to
I the Democratic presidential nominee,
I Hoover stated his own position with
respect to the tariff commission,
! about which Alfred E. Smith spoke
at some length at Louisville last Sat
urday night.
Lauds Tariff Commission
"The tariff commission is a valu-
I able arm of the government," the Re-
{ publican candidate said. "It can be
j strengthened and made more useful
lin several ways. But the American
people will never consent to delegat
, ing authority over the tariff to any
i commission, whether non-partisan or
bi-partisan. Our people have a right
!to express themselves at the ballot
i upon so vital a question as this.

The tariff formed the keystone of
i the third Eastern speech of the Re
publican standard-bearer, but he also
dealt with government promotion of
j the nation's foreign trade and the
maintenance of an adequate merchant
marine by private enterprise with the
assistance and co-operation of the
j government.
Auxiliary to these he declared in
j favor of private loans to foreign coun-
I tries to aid in stabilization abroad;
! against any cancellation of war debts,
; disputing the theory that their ulti
mate payment must be made in goods
i which would replace the output of
' American farms and factories, and for
the protection of American citizens
and their property abroad and the
! protection of foreign citizens within
; the borders of the United States.
Hoover's whole speech was devoted
1 to economic questions upon the sound
solution of which, he said, "depends
! our prosperity, our standards of liv
ing, and the opportunities for a fuller
life to every home."
Stresses Protective Tariff
"One of the most important eco
nomic issues of this campaign is the
i protective tariff," he said. "The Re
publican Party has for seventy years
supported a tariff designed to give
j adequate protection to American la-
I bor, American industry, and the
| American farm against foreign com-
I petition."
Hoover asserted that not only had
j actual experience refuted all of the
Democratic predictions of calamity
attending the operation of the present
Republican tariff, but that it had been
accompanied by employment and
prosperity as well as by vast in
creases both in imports and exports.
Stressing the importance of foreign
trade, the nominee said that to insure
continuous employment and maintain
American wages a profitable market
must be found for the surplus produc
tions in this country both of manu
factures and farm produce. He re
viewed the steps taken by the gov
ernment through the Department of
Commerce to find markets and in co
operating with manufacturers and ex
porters "in laying out and executing
strategic plans for expanding our for
eign trade with all nations and in all
directions."
Issues Are Not Local
Summing up what he described as
"The thought I should like to leave
with you," Hoover said:

Stressing the importance of foreign
trade, the nominee said that to insure

Issues Are Not Local
Summing up what he described as
"The thought I should like to leave
with you," Hoover said:
"I have talked to you about the
tariff, about international trade, the
merchant marine, and other economic
forces which may, at first glance,
seem far removed from our daily
lives. I have tried to make the point
that these subjects are no longer re
mote from any one of you. The time
may have been, as someone once said,
when the tariff was a local issue or
foreign trade and shipping concerned
only the local seaports.
"It is so no longer. Touch the tariff
on textiles and North Carolina feels
the blighting influence as quickly as
Massachusetts. Nor does it stop there.
The farmer finds a diminished market
in lessened demand caused by lower

"Unsettle the credit structure, and
it is not Wall Street that suffers most;
it is the little bank, the little facory,
the little farm, the modest home.
"A shortage of shipping to the Gulf
ports at once decreases prices to the
farmer in Kansas, for he must take
more extensive routes to foreign mar
kets.
BOSTON, Oct. 15. (#>)—Herbert
Hoover struck out at the opposition
here tonight in a manner unprece
dented in his campaign for the presi
dency, assailing in blunt terms the
tariff formula laid down in the Demo
cratic platform.

Speaking to the country generally,
but to industrial New England in par
ticular, the Republican candidate de
clared that the adjustment of impost
duties by the Democratic formula of
"effective competition" would mean
"a reduction of the tariff and a de
pression in American wages and
American farm prices."

"It means," he said, "a flood of for
| eign goods, of foreign farm produce,
! and consequent reduction of wages
and incomes not only of workers and
farmers, but the whole of those who
labor, whether in the field, the bench,
or the desk."
Without referring even indirectly to
I the Democratic presidential nominee,
I Hoover stated his own position with
respect to the tariff commission,
! about which Alfred E. Smith spoke
at some length at Louisville last Sat
urday night.
Lauds Tariff Commission
"The tariff commission is a valu-
I able arm of the government," the Re-
{ publican candidate said. "It can be
j strengthened and made more useful
lin several ways. But the American
people will never consent to delegat
, ing authority over the tariff to any
i commission, whether non-partisan or
bi-partisan. Our people have a right
!to express themselves at the ballot
i upon so vital a question as this.

The tariff formed the keystone of
i the third Eastern speech of the Re
publican standard-bearer, but he also
dealt with government promotion of
j the nation's foreign trade and the
maintenance of an adequate merchant
marine by private enterprise with the
assistance and co-operation of the
j government.
Auxiliary to these he declared in
j favor of private loans to foreign coun-
I tries to aid in stabilization abroad;
! against any cancellation of war debts,
; disputing the theory that their ulti
mate payment must be made in goods
i which would replace the output of
' American farms and factories, and for
the protection of American citizens
and their property abroad and the
! protection of foreign citizens within
; the borders of the United States.
Hoover's whole speech was devoted
1 to economic questions upon the sound
solution of which, he said, "depends
! our prosperity, our standards of liv
ing, and the opportunities for a fuller
life to every home."
Stresses Protective Tariff
"One of the most important eco
nomic issues of this campaign is the
i protective tariff," he said. "The Re
publican Party has for seventy years
supported a tariff designed to give
j adequate protection to American la-
I bor, American industry, and the
| American farm against foreign com-
I petition."
Hoover asserted that not only had
j actual experience refuted all of the
Democratic predictions of calamity
attending the operation of the present
Republican tariff, but that it had been

prosperity as well as by vast in
creases both in imports and exports.
