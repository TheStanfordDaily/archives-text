# The 						"Coll-dex" Affair
## 
### 
Our Mr. Frank, chairman of the Publications Council, is up in arms
over a piece of astute advertising business being conducted by James
White, a student, in a manner directly contrary to the provisions
of the Associated Students constitution. Mr. White is the entrepreneur
of the "Col-dex," a package of four loose-leaf dividers, which is inserted
in ihe students binder in order to separate one course's notes from an
other's. The "Coll-dex" is distributed free by the Bookstore.

The objectionable and allegedly unconstitutional feature of the "Coll
dex" is that its eight pages of surface are devoted to advertising in the
proportion of about 75 per cent, and to football schedules and the ever
reliable telephone number space for the remainder.
The advertising is wholly from Palo Alto firms, with the exception of
one ad, which comes from San Francisco. The charges for space have
of course covered the cost of providing the dividers and furnished Mr.
White with a neat profit.
Article HT, Section 3, Paragraph (e) of the By-Laws of the Constitu
tion declares that
"Every advertising project undertaken on the Stanford campus by which
an individual will personally profit must receive the sanction of the Execu
tive Committee. Sanction shall not be given unless the general manager
recommends the project. If the project is approved, ten per cent of the
computed gross receipts must be deposited with the A.S.S.U. account within
one week. When the promoter has satisfied the general manager that he
has carried out his contracts, one-half of this deposit shall be returned.
Since White neither sought nor received permission from the Execu
tive Committee to publish the dividers with the advertising thereon and
sell the said dividers on the campus, he is patently in the wrong, and
doubtless this will be explained to him at the Executive Committee meet
ing tonight. The clause is in the By-Laws for the purpose of protecting
campus publications, obviously, and not for the purpose of thwarting
good business hunches. The Quad, the Literary Magazine, and Chaparral
would suffer most from the divider competition, according to Chairman
Frank, while the Daily would suffer least.
The Merchants' Association of Palo Alto, which approved the soliciting
of advertising for the dividers, has indicated its willingness to withdraw
that approval upon being informed that White had not the legal right to
solicit. As Graduate Manager Alfred R. Masters and Student Manager
Louis Vincenti are in favor of stopping the distribution of the "Coll-dex,"
it is probable that the Executive Committee will order distribution be
ceased..
It is to be hoped that the A.S.S.U. and White will arrive at an amicable
settlement of the disposition of profits from the venture. The "Coll-dex"
was a good hunch (it being in wide use at California and U.S.C.), and
it is simply due to the oversight of White that distribution of it was made
without the Executive Committee's permission. There is in this affair an
object-lesson to all students who start business enterprises on the campus
â€”to be sure that they are clear of all constitutional restrictions before
they set up in business.
