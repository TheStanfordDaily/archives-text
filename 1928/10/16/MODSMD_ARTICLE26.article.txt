WHO'LL BE THE SURGEON?
The poor old Honor System has had
a nervous breakdown. It is going to
be stretched out on the operating
table and inspected by a committee,
who may decide: 1. That it ought to
be put out of its misery; 2. That it is
basicly sound, but it suffering from
a too ornate appendix; 3. That its
system is run down and needs a tonic.
The net result of this committee's
findings, under student government as
we have it, will be zero: If, however,
the committee's sessions can be fol
lowed by an honest-to-God general
student assembly devoted solely to
free-for-all discussion of the Honor
System, we can get somewhere. This
does not mean that the presiding of
ficer will get up and announce: "We
will now hear from so-and-so, chair
man of the such-and-such, who will
tell us how we are going to handle
this problem." It means this: that any
Stanford student or professor in the
Assembly Hall would be entitled to
stand up, secure the floor, and give
his own opinion. Stanford needs fewer
committees and more pure democracy.
Another result of a few real assem

blies would be to foster Stanford
Spirit. Right now there is no such
thing as Stanford Spirit. It is just a
phrase. Some freshman will now sub
mit a protest to Campus Opinion, say
ing, in effect: "We have wonderful
Stanford Spirit. Look how we yell
when Biff goes over for a touchdown!
Look how we sing, and do our card
tricks and throw our hats in the air!"
The answer is: any drunken sailor
can do that.

When the game is over, we go home
and devote our surplus of "Stanford
Spirit" to childish criticism of the
Administration, of student govern
ment, of $99 tuition. There is nothing
constructive about Stanford Spirit. It
is just plain pitiful.

A few free-for-all assemblies might
lose us a few lecture hours, but they
would go far toward getting us ac
quainted with each other, toward mak
ing us realize that Stanford is a won
derful place to be, and toward getting
rid of this rotten habit of negative
criticism that is a chronic disease
among Stanford students.
The Honor System mess and its
cure would make a fine beginning.
