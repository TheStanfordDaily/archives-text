The Editor, Sir:
Friday's Bullsession should not be
allowed to go unchallenged, because
there were some very undignified in
sinuations made at the incoming
third-year men. Referring to the honor
system, the writer asked the question,
"Is there any connection between this
tottering of our finest tradition and
the influx of third-year men?" It ap
pears that a question was used rather
than a direct statement so as not to
be too slighting of new Juniors.
Honor is honor no matter where it
is. It did not originate at Stanford
and the honor found here is no dif
ferent than that found at a thousand
other schools. It is a personal trait
and the so-called Stanford ideals
cited by the writer of Bullsession has
little to do in changing the honor of
a man.
As soon as some of the students
who started at Stanford as freshmen
get away from the narrow provincial
ism that develops in about the third
or fourth year, Stanford will be a
better university. As for new third
year men having definite set ideas of
college, there is a generous helping
of hooey. Show me any noticeable
percentage of new Juniors who are
refusing to fit in with the program of
life as it exists at Stanford.
And as for the "high ideals of Stan
ford" being lacking in other schools,
they could not be Stanford ideals.
They have their own ideals, but to
charge that they are inferior to Stan
ford is going too far.
I come from a school whose dean is
a Stanford man, many of whose pro
fessors are Stanford men, and I deny
that Stanford ideals are noticeably
higher than those of that school.

The Editor, Sir:
Californians who are supporting the
candidacy of Alfred Emanuel Smith
might do well to look around and find
out what the election of Herbert
Hoover will mean for their own state.
California has a stake in the present
election unlike that of any state in any
election.
It is the publicity value that would
come to this state through the election
of Herbert Hoover, the first Californian
ever to reach the White House. In a
strictly local sense that value has all the
force of an issue, and one which most
Californians have totally overlooked.
This is a feature of the campaign
which has been largely overlooked.
Now, for the first time, this state has
a chance to put one of its own citizens
into the White House.
We do not, of course, pick our Presi
dential favorites on such a selfish basis,
but it is a fact that Mr. Hoover's elec
tion would focus attention on California
as never before.
Of course it is good advertising for
California when Charlie Paddock
breaks a world's sprint record or when
Helen Wills wins a tennis champion
ship. We applaud, and business men
and chambers of commerce gloat over
free publicity. How much greater pub
licity to have one of California's own
great statesmen given the highest
office in the land.
We know how one brief summer
vacation spent by President Coolidge
in the Hlack Hills of South Dakota
helped that section. California would
get that same sort of public spotlight
ofT and on for four years. An example
of this was seen recently at Palo Alto
when Mr. Hoover made his acceptance
speech. Wherever the President goes,
whether it be to Palo Alto, Yosemite,
or the High Sierra, there, too, goes
the nation's attention.
Public spirited Californians have
spent millions of dollars in advertising
the attractions and opportunities of the
state throughout the world. This ad
vertising has played and is playing a

vital part in the great Westward move
ment which is taking place in this
country today.
The amazing development of the
whole Pacific Coast in comparatively
recent years, together with the con
stantly growing importance of the Pa
i cific Ocean as a center of world com
merce, are indications that when we
have talked about opportunities and
j attractions we have not been exaggcr
s ating.
Now we have the opportunity to place
the name of our state before thb whole
j world as the home of the nation's
chief executive. We have an oppor
tunity to focus attention on all the
previous advertising and to give Cali
| fornia the benefit of the greatest, piece
| of publicity it has had since the days
of '49.
Herbert Hoover's election would
would very certainly have the effect of
bringing California closer to the center
j of national affairs, of bridging some of
] the distance that now lies between the
i Atlantic and the Pacific, and of making
! people realize that what is happening
I in Los Angeles and San Francisco is
of genuine importance to New York
j and Boston.

The Editor, Sir:
Friday's Bullsession should not be
allowed to go unchallenged, because
there were some very undignified in
sinuations made at the incoming
third-year men. Referring to the honor
system, the writer asked the question,
"Is there any connection between this
tottering of our finest tradition and
the influx of third-year men?" It ap
pears that a question was used rather
than a direct statement so as not to
be too slighting of new Juniors.
Honor is honor no matter where it
is. It did not originate at Stanford
and the honor found here is no dif
ferent than that found at a thousand
other schools. It is a personal trait
and the so-called Stanford ideals
cited by the writer of Bullsession has
little to do in changing the honor of
a man.
As soon as some of the students
who started at Stanford as freshmen
get away from the narrow provincial
ism that develops in about the third
or fourth year, Stanford will be a
better university. As for new third
year men having definite set ideas of
college, there is a generous helping
of hooey. Show me any noticeable
percentage of new Juniors who are
refusing to fit in with the program of
life as it exists at Stanford.
And as for the "high ideals of Stan
ford" being lacking in other schools,
they could not be Stanford ideals.
They have their own ideals, but to
charge that they are inferior to Stan
ford is going too far.
I come from a school whose dean is
a Stanford man, many of whose pro
fessors are Stanford men, and I deny
that Stanford ideals are noticeably
higher than those of that school.

The Editor, Sir:
Californians who are supporting the
candidacy of Alfred Emanuel Smith
might do well to look around and find
out what the election of Herbert
Hoover will mean for their own state.
California has a stake in the present
election unlike that of any state in any
election.
It is the publicity value that would
come to this state through the election
of Herbert Hoover, the first Californian
ever to reach the White House. In a
strictly local sense that value has all the
force of an issue, and one which most
Californians have totally overlooked.
This is a feature of the campaign
which has been largely overlooked.
Now, for the first time, this state has
a chance to put one of its own citizens
into the White House.
We do not, of course, pick our Presi
dential favorites on such a selfish basis,
but it is a fact that Mr. Hoover's elec
tion would focus attention on California
as never before.
Of course it is good advertising for
California when Charlie Paddock
breaks a world's sprint record or when
Helen Wills wins a tennis champion
ship. We applaud, and business men
and chambers of commerce gloat over
free publicity. How much greater pub
licity to have one of California's own
great statesmen given the highest
office in the land.
We know how one brief summer
vacation spent by President Coolidge
in the Hlack Hills of South Dakota
helped that section. California would
get that same sort of public spotlight
ofT and on for four years. An example
of this was seen recently at Palo Alto
when Mr. Hoover made his acceptance
speech. Wherever the President goes,
whether it be to Palo Alto, Yosemite,
or the High Sierra, there, too, goes
the nation's attention.
Public spirited Californians have
spent millions of dollars in advertising
the attractions and opportunities of the
state throughout the world. This ad
vertising has played and is playing a

vital part in the great Westward move
ment which is taking place in this
country today.
The amazing development of the
whole Pacific Coast in comparatively
recent years, together with the con
stantly growing importance of the Pa
i cific Ocean as a center of world com
merce, are indications that when we
have talked about opportunities and
j attractions we have not been exaggcr

get that same sort of public spotlight
ofT and on for four years. An example
of this was seen recently at Palo Alto
when Mr. Hoover made his acceptance
speech. Wherever the President goes,
whether it be to Palo Alto, Yosemite,
or the High Sierra, there, too, goes
the nation's attention.
Public spirited Californians have
spent millions of dollars in advertising
the attractions and opportunities of the
state throughout the world. This ad
vertising has played and is playing a

vital part in the great Westward move
ment which is taking place in this
country today.
The amazing development of the
whole Pacific Coast in comparatively
recent years, together with the con
stantly growing importance of the Pa
i cific Ocean as a center of world com
merce, are indications that when we
have talked about opportunities and
j attractions we have not been exaggcr
s ating.
Now we have the opportunity to place
the name of our state before thb whole
j world as the home of the nation's
chief executive. We have an oppor
tunity to focus attention on all the
previous advertising and to give Cali
| fornia the benefit of the greatest, piece
| of publicity it has had since the days
of '49.
Herbert Hoover's election would
would very certainly have the effect of
bringing California closer to the center
j of national affairs, of bridging some of
] the distance that now lies between the
i Atlantic and the Pacific, and of making
! people realize that what is happening
I in Los Angeles and San Francisco is
of genuine importance to New York
j and Boston.

The Editor, Sir:
Friday's Bullsession should not be
allowed to go unchallenged, because
there were some very undignified in
sinuations made at the incoming
third-year men. Referring to the honor
system, the writer asked the question,
"Is there any connection between this
tottering of our finest tradition and
the influx of third-year men?" It ap
pears that a question was used rather
than a direct statement so as not to
be too slighting of new Juniors.
Honor is honor no matter where it
is. It did not originate at Stanford
and the honor found here is no dif
ferent than that found at a thousand
other schools. It is a personal trait
and the so-called Stanford ideals
cited by the writer of Bullsession has
little to do in changing the honor of
a man.
As soon as some of the students
who started at Stanford as freshmen
get away from the narrow provincial
ism that develops in about the third
or fourth year, Stanford will be a
better university. As for new third
year men having definite set ideas of
college, there is a generous helping
of hooey. Show me any noticeable
percentage of new Juniors who are
refusing to fit in with the program of
life as it exists at Stanford.
And as for the "high ideals of Stan
ford" being lacking in other schools,
they could not be Stanford ideals.
They have their own ideals, but to
charge that they are inferior to Stan
ford is going too far.
I come from a school whose dean is
a Stanford man, many of whose pro
fessors are Stanford men, and I deny
that Stanford ideals are noticeably
higher than those of that school.

The Editor, Sir:
Californians who are supporting the
candidacy of Alfred Emanuel Smith
might do well to look around and find
out what the election of Herbert
Hoover will mean for their own state.
California has a stake in the present
election unlike that of any state in any
election.
It is the publicity value that would
come to this state through the election
of Herbert Hoover, the first Californian
ever to reach the White House. In a
strictly local sense that value has all the
force of an issue, and one which most
Californians have totally overlooked.
This is a feature of the campaign
which has been largely overlooked.
Now, for the first time, this state has
a chance to put one of its own citizens
into the White House.
We do not, of course, pick our Presi
dential favorites on such a selfish basis,
but it is a fact that Mr. Hoover's elec
tion would focus attention on California
as never before.
Of course it is good advertising for
California when Charlie Paddock
breaks a world's sprint record or when
Helen Wills wins a tennis champion
ship. We applaud, and business men
and chambers of commerce gloat over
free publicity. How much greater pub
licity to have one of California's own
great statesmen given the highest
office in the land.
We know how one brief summer
vacation spent by President Coolidge
in the Hlack Hills of South Dakota
helped that section. California would
get that same sort of public spotlight
ofT and on for four years. An example
of this was seen recently at Palo Alto
when Mr. Hoover made his acceptance
speech. Wherever the President goes,
