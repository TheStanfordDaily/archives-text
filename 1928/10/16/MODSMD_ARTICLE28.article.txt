Did come down Palm Drive right
speedily this morning, in a friend's car,
which he was most kind to lend to me
through his morning classes, and did
slow down tactfully at an intersection to
observe who it was walking out to the
campus. Whereupon I was most pleased
that I had done same, for did discover
a policeman sitting in a Chrysler road
ster by one of the palm trees obscurely
off the road. Was glad to observe that
he must have noticed my proper hesita
tion at the intersection, though, from
where he sat, he held a most excellent
view of the road.

Do read in the Campus Opinion col
umn of the Daily several letters concern
ing the appointment of a new member
to Men's Council by the Executive Com
mittee, and do think that such interest in
campus leaders and activities docs show
a most gratifying state of health in the
student body. But, gracious, if there is
as much interest as evidenced by the let
ters, why do not the dissatisfied parties
take advantage of whatever type of re
call exists in the student government?
For do think a petition to the Executive
Committee would be as effective as let
ters in the newspaper.

To the Daily office this afternoon,
quickly after lunch, and did sign up my
name and address with the authorities.
Was pleased to note that the traditional
Stanford masculine predominance was
followed in the other tryouts, and was
also gratified to learn the managing edi
tors were human, and did smile sweetly
at me, which I do attribute to my new
tweed suit. We were given a most thrill
ing fire story to write about a framed
building and an oil stove which exploded
on Bush Street, which, from what I hear
of Bush Street, is not surprising, for all
sorts of things arc liable to break there.
Do believe, however, that it is bad busi
ness to descend t<j the. rank and file, and
besides, did not hear the name of the
man whose house it was, so did hand in
an account of a corridor party at Roble
my sponsor did give last night, and de
scribing the attire worn, copying care
fully the society style of the city news
papers.

And so am sure that the editors will
enjoy this much more than another ac
count of the rooming house fire, for they
did look as though they were real news
paper men.
