On November sixth the American
people will choose a party to govern them
for the next four years. The policies of
this party will in 110 small measure be
determined by the man who leads it. So
in this informal discussion, an oppor
tunity for which the Daily has so kindly
given us, it will be our duty to cast the
white light of logic, as Mr. Wenig ex
presses it, not merely upon the person
alities and abilities of the candidates, but
also upon the things for which they stand
and upon the parties which they lead. In
an introductory article of this length the
treatment must be sketchy; we shall
therefore endeavor to contrast the points
at issue, suggesting why we believe Smith
the better qualified, and the Democratic
party the more fit, to control the affairs
of the nation. Let us first consider the
training of the two men.

Hoover is by profession and training
an engineer and executive. In that field
he is unrivaled. Smith, on the other hand,
is a political scientist, trained, as every
scientist should be, in an experimental
laboratory. Since early manhood he has
been confronted with political problems,
and his record in his own field is un
equaled. For instance: in 1920 New York
had a direct ta* rate of 2.7 mills and
spent $108,000,000 on education; in 1927
the tax rate was 1 mill only, but $257,-
000,000 was spent on education, according
to the current World Almanac. As a re
sult of Smith's efforts New York has
now progressive labor laws, adequate hos
pital and asylum facilities, and the hydro
electric resources of the state have been
saved for the people. Instead of a hodge
podge of commissions the state has now a
systematized administration. And this
whole period, spent in the office most an
alogous to the presidency, has been but a
training for that task. Hoover is a
trained engineer; Smith a trained politi
cal scientist.
Smith a Progressive
Hoover is conservative, while Smith is
progressive. Hoover argues that the
farmer will find relief through the tariff
and from co-operative marketing. He ig
nores utterly the fact, and this is pe
culiarly pertinent to Mr. Wenig's claim
that Hoover has superior economic abil
ity, that American farm products are
cheaper than foreign, and cannot there
fore be protected by a tariff, and that co
operative marketing is impossible over as
large an area as the United States. Smith
recognizes that what ails the farmer is
the fact that he sells at unprotected
prices, but buys at a standard of values
inflated by protection both of the raw
materials and of the manufactured prod
ucts. Consequently, the only aid for the
farmer is an equalization of this double
standard of values by means of a tariff
reduction and a system of government
subsidies. It is only fair that the farmer
should get what the manufacturer has.

Mr. Hoover favors private water pow
er development; Mr. Smith public own
ership. In fact he made his first speech
against the power trust as long ago as
1913. This same progressive courage was
shown in his support of the socialists ex
pelled from the New York assembly, and
in his refusal to run on a ticket with
Hearst, because he disapproved of the
man, even though he knew the support he
would lose.

The Party Behind the Man
But after all, either man is effective
only as the leader of a party. We must
therefore contrast the record of the
Democratic party from 1912 to 1920 with
that of the Republicans since. During the
former period the Democrats passed the
Federal Reserve Act, the Income Tax
Amendment, the Prohibition and Woman
Suffrage Amendments, established the
Farm Loan Banks, held the Niagara Con
ference, which should have set a new
precedent in Latin-American affairs, and
through their leader established the
League of Nations. This record of
achievements is without parallel in Amer
ican history. What have the Republicans
to compare with it? Teapot Dome, the

Veterans' Bureau, the Nicaragua fiasco,
the Mexican crisis, domestic disgrace and
foreign dishonor. It is any wonder that,
feeling guilty, they attempt to obscure
party responsibility and slink behind the
spectre of Tammany which they have
conjured? On the good side of the bal
ance they have only a slight reduction of
taxation, inevitable with the end of war
expenditures, the Washington conference
which scrapped a few obsolete battleships,
the absolute failure of the Geneva con
ference, and the Kellogg Treaties, a
pathetic apology for their failure to ac
cept the League of Nations.
Yet of this record Mr. Hoover says in
his speech of acceptance: "The record of
these seven and a half years constitute a
period of rare courage In leadership and
constructive action. Never has a political
party been able to look back upon a simi
lar period with more satisfaction." If
this is his criterion of the past what can
we expect of him in the future?

for the next four years. The policies of
this party will in 110 small measure be
determined by the man who leads it. So
in this informal discussion, an oppor
tunity for which the Daily has so kindly
given us, it will be our duty to cast the
white light of logic, as Mr. Wenig ex
presses it, not merely upon the person
alities and abilities of the candidates, but
also upon the things for which they stand
and upon the parties which they lead. In
an introductory article of this length the
treatment must be sketchy; we shall
therefore endeavor to contrast the points
at issue, suggesting why we believe Smith
the better qualified, and the Democratic
party the more fit, to control the affairs
of the nation. Let us first consider the
training of the two men.

Hoover is by profession and training
an engineer and executive. In that field
he is unrivaled. Smith, on the other hand,
is a political scientist, trained, as every
scientist should be, in an experimental
laboratory. Since early manhood he has
been confronted with political problems,
and his record in his own field is un
equaled. For instance: in 1920 New York
had a direct ta* rate of 2.7 mills and
spent $108,000,000 on education; in 1927
the tax rate was 1 mill only, but $257,-
000,000 was spent on education, according
to the current World Almanac. As a re
sult of Smith's efforts New York has
now progressive labor laws, adequate hos
pital and asylum facilities, and the hydro
electric resources of the state have been
saved for the people. Instead of a hodge
podge of commissions the state has now a
systematized administration. And this
whole period, spent in the office most an
alogous to the presidency, has been but a
training for that task. Hoover is a
trained engineer; Smith a trained politi
cal scientist.
Smith a Progressive
Hoover is conservative, while Smith is
progressive. Hoover argues that the
farmer will find relief through the tariff
and from co-operative marketing. He ig
nores utterly the fact, and this is pe
culiarly pertinent to Mr. Wenig's claim
that Hoover has superior economic abil
ity, that American farm products are
cheaper than foreign, and cannot there
fore be protected by a tariff, and that co
operative marketing is impossible over as
large an area as the United States. Smith
recognizes that what ails the farmer is
the fact that he sells at unprotected
prices, but buys at a standard of values
inflated by protection both of the raw
materials and of the manufactured prod
ucts. Consequently, the only aid for the
farmer is an equalization of this double
standard of values by means of a tariff
reduction and a system of government
subsidies. It is only fair that the farmer
should get what the manufacturer has.

Mr. Hoover favors private water pow
er development; Mr. Smith public own
ership. In fact he made his first speech
against the power trust as long ago as
1913. This same progressive courage was
shown in his support of the socialists ex
pelled from the New York assembly, and
in his refusal to run on a ticket with
Hearst, because he disapproved of the
man, even though he knew the support he
would lose.

The Party Behind the Man
But after all, either man is effective
only as the leader of a party. We must
therefore contrast the record of the
Democratic party from 1912 to 1920 with
that of the Republicans since. During the
former period the Democrats passed the
Federal Reserve Act, the Income Tax
Amendment, the Prohibition and Woman
Suffrage Amendments, established the
Farm Loan Banks, held the Niagara Con
ference, which should have set a new
precedent in Latin-American affairs, and
through their leader established the
League of Nations. This record of
achievements is without parallel in Amer
ican history. What have the Republicans
to compare with it? Teapot Dome, the

Veterans' Bureau, the Nicaragua fiasco,
the Mexican crisis, domestic disgrace and
foreign dishonor. It is any wonder that,
feeling guilty, they attempt to obscure
party responsibility and slink behind the
spectre of Tammany which they have
conjured? On the good side of the bal
ance they have only a slight reduction of
taxation, inevitable with the end of war
expenditures, the Washington conference
which scrapped a few obsolete battleships,
the absolute failure of the Geneva con
ference, and the Kellogg Treaties, a
pathetic apology for their failure to ac
cept the League of Nations.
Yet of this record Mr. Hoover says in
his speech of acceptance: "The record of
these seven and a half years constitute a
period of rare courage In leadership and
constructive action. Never has a political
party been able to look back upon a simi
lar period with more satisfaction." If
this is his criterion of the past what can
we expect of him in the future?

an introductory article of this length the
treatment must be sketchy; we shall
therefore endeavor to contrast the points
at issue, suggesting why we believe Smith
the better qualified, and the Democratic
party the more fit, to control the affairs
of the nation. Let us first consider the
training of the two men.

Hoover is by profession and training
an engineer and executive. In that field
he is unrivaled. Smith, on the other hand,
is a political scientist, trained, as every
scientist should be, in an experimental
laboratory. Since early manhood he has
been confronted with political problems,
and his record in his own field is un
equaled. For instance: in 1920 New York
had a direct ta* rate of 2.7 mills and
spent $108,000,000 on education; in 1927
the tax rate was 1 mill only, but $257,-
000,000 was spent on education, according
to the current World Almanac. As a re
sult of Smith's efforts New York has
now progressive labor laws, adequate hos
pital and asylum facilities, and the hydro
electric resources of the state have been
saved for the people. Instead of a hodge
podge of commissions the state has now a
systematized administration. And this
whole period, spent in the office most an
alogous to the presidency, has been but a
training for that task. Hoover is a
trained engineer; Smith a trained politi
cal scientist.
Smith a Progressive
Hoover is conservative, while Smith is
progressive. Hoover argues that the
farmer will find relief through the tariff
and from co-operative marketing. He ig
nores utterly the fact, and this is pe
culiarly pertinent to Mr. Wenig's claim
that Hoover has superior economic abil
ity, that American farm products are
cheaper than foreign, and cannot there
fore be protected by a tariff, and that co
operative marketing is impossible over as
large an area as the United States. Smith
recognizes that what ails the farmer is
the fact that he sells at unprotected
prices, but buys at a standard of values
inflated by protection both of the raw
materials and of the manufactured prod
ucts. Consequently, the only aid for the
farmer is an equalization of this double
standard of values by means of a tariff
reduction and a system of government
subsidies. It is only fair that the farmer
should get what the manufacturer has.

Mr. Hoover favors private water pow
er development; Mr. Smith public own
ership. In fact he made his first speech
against the power trust as long ago as
1913. This same progressive courage was
shown in his support of the socialists ex
pelled from the New York assembly, and
in his refusal to run on a ticket with
Hearst, because he disapproved of the
man, even though he knew the support he
would lose.

The Party Behind the Man
But after all, either man is effective
only as the leader of a party. We must
therefore contrast the record of the
Democratic party from 1912 to 1920 with
that of the Republicans since. During the
former period the Democrats passed the
Federal Reserve Act, the Income Tax
Amendment, the Prohibition and Woman
Suffrage Amendments, established the
Farm Loan Banks, held the Niagara Con
ference, which should have set a new
precedent in Latin-American affairs, and
through their leader established the
League of Nations. This record of
achievements is without parallel in Amer
ican history. What have the Republicans
to compare with it? Teapot Dome, the

Veterans' Bureau, the Nicaragua fiasco,
the Mexican crisis, domestic disgrace and
foreign dishonor. It is any wonder that,
feeling guilty, they attempt to obscure
party responsibility and slink behind the
spectre of Tammany which they have
conjured? On the good side of the bal
ance they have only a slight reduction of
taxation, inevitable with the end of war
expenditures, the Washington conference
which scrapped a few obsolete battleships,
the absolute failure of the Geneva con
ference, and the Kellogg Treaties, a
pathetic apology for their failure to ac
cept the League of Nations.
Yet of this record Mr. Hoover says in
his speech of acceptance: "The record of
these seven and a half years constitute a
period of rare courage In leadership and
constructive action. Never has a political
party been able to look back upon a simi
lar period with more satisfaction." If
this is his criterion of the past what can
we expect of him in the future?

On November sixth the American
people will choose a party to govern them
for the next four years. The policies of
this party will in 110 small measure be
determined by the man who leads it. So
in this informal discussion, an oppor
tunity for which the Daily has so kindly
given us, it will be our duty to cast the
white light of logic, as Mr. Wenig ex
presses it, not merely upon the person
alities and abilities of the candidates, but
also upon the things for which they stand
and upon the parties which they lead. In
