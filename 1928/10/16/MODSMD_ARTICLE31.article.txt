# FROSH PREPARE FOR SATURDAY'S TILT WITH GAELS
## 
### 
None the worse for their game with
the Pasadena Junior College eleven
last Saturday all members of the Cardi
nal freshmen squad turned out for
practice yesterday and went through a
fair workout in preparation for their
game with the St. Mary's yearlings next
Saturday morning in the Stadium.

Dusty Allen, first string fullback, who
was on the sick list all last week; Rudy
Rintala, halfback, who was taken out of
the Pasadena game with a sore leg; and
Marks, quarterback, who received a bad
cut under his eye Saturday, were all in
suits yesterday and appeared perfectly fit.

The coach of the Pasadena team de
clared, following the game with the Stan
ford frosh, that he believes the U. S. C.
first year team to be stronger than the
Card yearlings. The Trojan freshmen
romped through to a 26 to 0 victory over
the Pasadena Junior College two weeks
ago, scoring 7 points less than the Stan
ford freshmen did against the same team.
He said that the Trojans will outweight
the Cards in almost every position and
will be a bard eleven to stop.
Coaches Hunt and Bradshaw spent
considerable time last night drilling Milli
gan and Quirk, centers, to come out of
the line on certain defensive plays. Both
centers failed to do this on several occa
sions Saturday.
