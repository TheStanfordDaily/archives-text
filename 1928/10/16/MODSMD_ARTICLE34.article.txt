# SPORTS OF 1928
## A 						Coach's Problem 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Folks, meet Mr. Hawley, Dartmouth
mentor and coach of the team that was
awarded the more or less mythical cham
pionship of the country in 1925 as a re
sult of victories over Harvard, Brown,
Cornell, and Chicago. At present Jess
Hawley is face to face with the task of
developing a good quarterback to take
the place of MacPhail; a fast running
back to fill in for Myles Lane, leading
point-scorer in the East in 1927; and a
new line to protect and open the way for
the elusive A1 Marsters, one of the most
dazzling broken-field runners seen in the
East for a long time. But, to dazzle,
Marsters must get clear and into the
open, and to do this a good line must be
developed, with only two veterans to
work with.

Then consider the schedule—Columbia,
Harvard, Yale, Brown, Cornell, and

Northwestern are met on successive Sat
urdays, with only the Columbia and
Brown games at home. True, Dartmouth
looked pretty good in its opening games,
and Breithut, a southpaw passer, gave
promise of becoming a good side-kick for
Marsters. The fleet-footed, snake-hipped
hurdler, by the way, is as fast as ever,
and if he gets any support should find a
place on irany All-American selections
this year.
The tragic death of Howard Hamm
..last summer robbed Hawley of a promis
ing substitute for R. W. Black, fullback
and captain, who has one of those trick
knees. "Tex" Cole, former cowboy,
played well against Hobart, and, how
that he has left his pony at home for the
winter to take up football in a serious
way, should develop into a first-class
tackle.
