### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 15. (/P)
â€”Chinese tong outbreaks re
ported from large Eastern cities
are not expected to have reper
cussions here, although San
Francisco's Chinatown is the
largest in America and has
representatives of all the tongs.
These tongmen have vowed be
fore Detective Sergeant John J.
Manion, in charge of the China
town police detail, to take their
shootings elsewhere.
Some years ago representa
tives of all tongs in the country
met at the "House of Peace"
here, and took oath with Manion
as referee not to fight any more
on the west coast. There have
been few lapses.
