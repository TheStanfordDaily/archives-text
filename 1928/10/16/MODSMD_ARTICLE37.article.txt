vated to new high records, several of
the gains running from 5 to nearly
25 points. Total sales ran over j
4,000,000 shares.
Sale of a New York Stock Exchange
sc-at was arranged this afternoon at j
the record-breaking price of $480,000, j
above the record established only a
few hours before and $30,000 above
the high price set last week. A com- i

ent limit of 1100, which has remained j
unchanged since 1879. An effort to
increase the membership by 25 in
1926 was defeated.
