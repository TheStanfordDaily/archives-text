# GUY BATES POST DERIDES AMERICAN MEN
## Noted Actor Denies That Legitimate Stage Is Declining; Believes Talking Pictures Have Future Possibilities 
### Ben Maddox 
Guy Bates Post, noted actor, is strong
for individualism. At the New Capitol
Theatre in the city, where he closes a suc
cessful run this week, he told me that
American colleges ought to spend more
time developing this trait.
Also, that they should teach courtesy
among men and turn out students with
initiative. Graduates lack these qualities
now, he thinks.
Americans Are Crude
"Returning to the American stage after
five years in.England and the British
colonies, I notice particularly the rude
ness and crudeness of my fellow citi
zens. There is no courtesy between men
jn this country. We are courteous to
women not because we are chivalrous but
because they demand respect.
"American men lack poise. When they
dress up they don't know what to do
with themselves—they must put their
hands in their pockets and act as self
conscious as little boys.
"The young men of America have no
initiative. That is, if told to do some
thing they give up immediately if the
way is not absolutely mapped out for
them. They have no ingenuity, no per
sistence.
"The theatre is at low ebb—in London
as well as in New York. Fine plays are
not patronized. America is jazz mad."
Denies Theatre Decline
But when I suggested that the theatre
was on the decline because of moving
picture competition, Mr. Post immediate
ly denied that such is the case.
"IxK>k here at San Francisco. Ten
years ago there were only two or three
legitimate theatres. Now there are seven,
just as big a proportion attends stage
.plays as ever."
lie emphasized the fact that the public
gets what it wants in the way of enter
tainment. "The public is the answer to
the 'what's the matter with the movies?'

question. There are some brilliant people
in Hollywood. The producers are not
dumb. They are merely giving the public
what it demands.
Talkies Are Undeveloped
"As for talking pictures, Mr. Lionel
Belmore, who is heading my supporting
cast, just completed one before opening
here. He tells me they are still in a very
undeveloped and transitory stage. The
mechanics of talkies have yet to be satis
factorily worked out. Yes, they have
possibilities, and I might do some when
they are more advanced."
Mr. Post starred in several big pic
tures about six years ago, making a par
ticular hit in the screen version of his
stage hit, "The Masquerader."
He is an unimpressive person, but a
man who arouses your interest the longer
you talk to him. At first, he is trivial.
But when he decides to really talk, he
becomes intensely interesting. He is ex
cellent copy because his opinions are so
forcible. He doesn't ask whether you
think such and such is the case —he says
it is. He has played on the speaking
stage for the past thirty-five years, so
he knows whereof he speaks.
Praises Molnar's Play
"I consider my present show, 'The
Play's the Thing,' as fine as anything
Molnar has written, equally as good as
'The Swan' and 'Lilliom.' I don't think
the public appreciates it as much as they
do a melodrama like 'The Masquerader.'
But this is infinitely better—a much high
er class bit of writing. My role is subtle
and Requires a great deal of restraint—
no fireworks.
"I took the greatest pains to assemble
my cast—some members came all the way
from England. I go to the Biltmore
Theatre in Los Angeles from here."
Mr. Post ranks at the top of the the
atrical profession. He is an actor through
and through—he realizes that he is good
and justly expects others to do the same.
