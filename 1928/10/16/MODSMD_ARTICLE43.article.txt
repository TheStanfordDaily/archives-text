# EASTERN TEAMS HAVE BIG GAMES NEXT WEEK-END
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 15. (JP) —Some of
the East's football cream already has
soured, hut there's one consolation
for Navy, Pitt, West Virginia, Wash
ington and Jefferson, Penn State,
Fonlham, and others. Those who al
ready have laid aside championship
aspirations until next year will grow
ever more numerous.
A glance at next Saturday's sched
ule reveals a fairly large group of
battles between undefeated and united
teams.
Army's clash with Harvard at the
Harvard stadium offers the highlight.
The Cadets, facing as strenuous a
schedule as any team in the country,
has taken over Boston University,
Southern Methodist, and Providence
in succession. Harvard, starting a
week later, has trounced Springfield
and North Carolina and has hopes,
albeit none too strong, of adding
Army to its string.
Yale, which showed surprising
strength in turning back Georgia, 21-6,
last Saturday, meets Brown at New
Haven. Tuss McLaughry's Bears had
a stiff fight on their hands before they
could drop Dayton, 13-7, over the
week-end.
Bill Ingram's thrice-beaten Navy
crew will try to get into the win col
umn at Duke's expense but the Mid
shipmen will have to score their first
points of the season to do it.
Princeton will have to get along
without the services of three football
regulars for awhile. Joe Caldwell,
husky guard, suffered a recurrence of
an old back injury in the Tigers' score
less tie battle with Virginia on Satur
day. Ed Wittmer and Mike Miles, star
backs, suffered less serious injuries
that will keep them out of practice
for several days. Princeton meets
Lehigh next.

Men of the Kansas State Agricul
tural College have turned thumbs
down on the stockingless fad, with a
resulting scarcity of feminine bare
legs on the campus.
