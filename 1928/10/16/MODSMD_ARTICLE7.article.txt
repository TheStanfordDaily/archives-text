# Arab Life To Be Hulme's Lecture Subject Tonight
## Bases Talk on Three Months Spent in North Africa Among Berbers 
### 
Professor Edward Maslin Hulme of
the department of history will speak
in the Assembly Hall tonight at 7:30
o'clock on "Life among the Arabs of
French North Africa." His lecture will
be based on three months of actual
experience In the French provinces of
Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco, where
he spent the first part of this year.

Since the so-called Arabs of North
Africa are really Berbers, they are an
European people, dark Caucasians
with many real blondes among them,
according to the lecturer. Grey eyes
are very common, and light hair is
not unusual, contrary to the general
impression here in America.

Professor Hulme explained the man
ner in which they came to be called
Arabs by the intermarriage of these
European-North Africans with the
true natives of Arabia, who found
their way from their homeland all
along the North African coast and
were stopped by the western coast.

Varying degrees of the Arabic
strain are found here, the blood pre
dominating as one travels eastward;
and it is very marked in the desert
tribes of the northern fringe of the
Sahara. The natives form really two
distinct groups, these desert men and
those of the oases aud towns who dif
fer in occupation and characteristics
as well as in blood.

During his visit Professor Hulme
was able to study both types of na
tives, even living in five of the oases
in order to meet the desert tribes.
Tonight in his address he will de
scribe what kind of people the Arabs
are, and tell of his experiences among
them.
