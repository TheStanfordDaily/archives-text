# VANDAL TIDE WORRIES POP SAY WRITERS
## Game Friday May Throw New Light on Idaho's Claim For '27 Conference Championship 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
The majority of sports writers be
lieve they can see signs of worry in
the face of Pop Warner. And they
interpret these signs as indication
that the veteran coach of the grid
iron is worried about the approach
ing Vandal tide from Moscow, Idaho.
Perhaps Pop is worried about
Charlie Edb's heavy warriors, and
perhaps not. More likely he is just
being cautious about the present, and
is conserving his "worry nerves" for
a little later in the season when his
team meets the kind of opposition
that California, U.S.C., and West
Point keep in stock.
Idaho's Record Not Good
Idaho's record for the season isn't
the kind of publicity that attracts
huge crowds. The potato merchants
have broken even on the three games
they have participated in to date.
Idaho started the season by accepting
the short end of a 15-13 encounter
with Montana State. They next tied
Gonzaga 6-6 at Spokane, and last Sat
urday defeated Whitman 26-13.
Local fans are looking forward to
Friday as the day on which they can
discover for themselves just what
this mystery about Idaho amounts to.
The Vandals haven't done any im
pressive scoring this year, so there
arises the query, "What's all the
shoutin' for?" For one thing the
Stanford-Idaho game will be the first
time since 1924 that the Vandals have
exhibited their wares in this part of
the country. Then, too, it will not only
be their first Conference game this
season but their first chance against
real opposition.
Line Averages 198
One thing the Cards are considering
this week is that their comparatively
heavy line will be outweighed seven
pounds to the man. The Idaho forward
wall averages 198 pounds from end
to end. The northern rooters believe
that their line is big enough and tough
enough to open up holes for their two
big threats, Kershisnik and Hutchin
son.
Last year Stanford entered into a
triple tie with Southern California and
Idaho, who claimed the championship
by virtue of its record, in spite of not
having met either the Trojans or
Cards. The game Friday will possibly
shed a little fresh light on the matter
of how much reason the Vandals had
for claiming the title.

Cards. The game Friday will possibly
shed a little fresh light on the matter
of how much reason the Vandals had
for claiming the title.
The majority of sports writers be
lieve they can see signs of worry in
the face of Pop Warner. And they
interpret these signs as indication
that the veteran coach of the grid
iron is worried about the approach
ing Vandal tide from Moscow, Idaho.
Perhaps Pop is worried about
Charlie Edb's heavy warriors, and
perhaps not. More likely he is just
being cautious about the present, and
is conserving his "worry nerves" for
a little later in the season when his
team meets the kind of opposition
that California, U.S.C., and West
Point keep in stock.
Idaho's Record Not Good
Idaho's record for the season isn't
the kind of publicity that attracts
huge crowds. The potato merchants
have broken even on the three games
they have participated in to date.
Idaho started the season by accepting
the short end of a 15-13 encounter
with Montana State. They next tied
Gonzaga 6-6 at Spokane, and last Sat
urday defeated Whitman 26-13.
Local fans are looking forward to
Friday as the day on which they can
discover for themselves just what
this mystery about Idaho amounts to.
The Vandals haven't done any im
pressive scoring this year, so there
arises the query, "What's all the
shoutin' for?" For one thing the
Stanford-Idaho game will be the first
time since 1924 that the Vandals have
exhibited their wares in this part of
the country. Then, too, it will not only
be their first Conference game this
season but their first chance against
real opposition.
Line Averages 198
One thing the Cards are considering
this week is that their comparatively
heavy line will be outweighed seven
pounds to the man. The Idaho forward
wall averages 198 pounds from end
to end. The northern rooters believe
that their line is big enough and tough
enough to open up holes for their two
big threats, Kershisnik and Hutchin
son.
Last year Stanford entered into a
triple tie with Southern California and
Idaho, who claimed the championship
by virtue of its record, in spite of not
having met either the Trojans or
Cards. The game Friday will possibly
shed a little fresh light on the matter
of how much reason the Vandals had
for claiming the title.
