# WEEK-END THEFTS FAIL TO REVEAL ADDITIONAL LOSS
## 
### 
With the thieves still at large, a
more complete check-up yesterday on
the losses sustained in the three cam
pus robberies committed last Satur
day failed to reveal any additional
losses than had been previously an
nounced.
Clothing and jewelry were stolen
from the Alpha Delta Phi house; dur
ing the U.C.L.A.-Stanford football
game, goods valued at $1000 were
taken from the automobile of Dolph
G. Lewis, Seattle salesman; and
stamps and tickets worth $30 are
missing from the Board of Athletic
Control office.
An unidentified man was seen leav
ing the Alpha Delt house during the
dinner hour last night. The men were
in the dining room and the intruder
was not noticed until he was nearly
out of the front door. When hailed,
he began running, and managed to
escape in the chase that followed.
