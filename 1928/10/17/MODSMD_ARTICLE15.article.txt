# HUNT GIVES BABE SQUAD WORKOUT ON PASS ATTACK
## 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
Work for the freshman football
squad yesterday consisted of drill on
the tackling dummies and dummy ma
chine and passing practice in prepara
tion for its meeting with the St.
Mary's freshmen in the Stadium at
10 o'clock Saturday morning. The
linemen spent considerable time in
charging and blocking.
Not much is known about the St.
Mary's team except that it was de
feated 19 to 0 by the California frosh
two weeks ago. By Saturday it will
probably be in far better shape and
should give the Cards a stiff game.
The Stanford freshmen seemed yes
terday to be going farily well, though
both practice sessions this week have
been slow. The yearlings have a
strong offensive and on the defense
have performed capably. Of the four
teams played to date, the Army, Santa
Rosa Junior College, Santa Clara
freshmen, and the Pasadena Junior
College, only the Army has been able
to score, and that lone touchdown
came in the freshmen's first game of
the year.
Coach Hunt, realizing the smallness
of his squad and the lack of reserves,
plans no heavy scrimmages for this
week. Reserve linemen have been
showing considerable improvement of
late, and Hunt will have a far easier
time in selecting substitutes, if
needed, next Saturday than he did
two weeks ago when good linemen on
the freshman squad were compara
tively few. Eby, tackle; Lyon and
Hunt, guards; and Simpson, end, are
among the most promising of the re
serve linemen.
