# SMITH DISPUTES G.O.P. CLAIM OF ECONOMIC ADMINISTRATION
## Believes Regime of Harding, Coolidge "As Wasteful As Any Country Ever Had" 
### 
SEDALIA, Mo., Oct. 16. â€” A
challenge to Republican claims ot
economy in administration of the Fed
eral Government was issued tonight
by Governor Alfred E. Smith, who de
clared that according to his idea the
Harding and Coolidge regimes had
been as "wasteful as any the country
had ever seen."
"They attempted to give away our
natural resources," he said. "They
have postponed and neglected the
most pressing needs."
The Democratic nominee explained
there were three pictures he desired
to place before the country. One, he
said, was that which the Republican
Party would like to have the Ameri
can people believe, "as showing great
efficiency and great economy."
The second, he added, was a picture
"setting up real facts which show
that the Government is costing more
this year than when President Cool
idge took office, while the third he
argued disclosed the "Republican
lack of ability, lack of efficiency and
lack of business methods."
The Governor contended that Re
publicans were "lacking an issue,"
and for that reason had attempted to
pill into the minds of the people what
"they are pleased to term Coolidge
economy" and declared he regarded
this as the "grossest misrepresenta
tion" so far made.
Further, he said that Herbert
Hoover, the Republican standard
bearer, had a "large share in the
; painting of this false picture, when,
jin his speech of acceptance, he said:
" 'By rigorous economy Federal ex-
I penses have been reduced by two
billion dollars per annum.' "
Asserting that "no more misleading
statement could be made in the cam
paign," the Democratic nominee added
that Mr. Hoover "knows better, or
should know better."
"He knows, or he should know," the
Governor went on, "that the two bil
lion dollar reduction Is the difference
between the peace-time cost of gov
ernment and the war-time cost of
government. He knows that is not so,
and he could never in his lifetime
make good his misleading claim.
