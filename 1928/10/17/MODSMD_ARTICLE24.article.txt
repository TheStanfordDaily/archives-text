# French Criticism of the Kellogg Pact
## 
### 
The Parisian press, according to dispatches from abroad, is adopting
a laughing and cynical attitude toward the American foreign policy,
setting forth that it is hardly more open than the French foreign policy,
against which American criticism has recently been leveled. Whether
the Anglo-French partnership or the Kellogg pact contributes more to
the cause of peace is implied as doubtful.
"In the New World as well as in the Old, the solemn act of August
27 is turning into a joke," Pertinax, foreign editor of the Echo dc Paris,
is reported as writing. "When we speak of the Kellogg pact today we
have a feeling of evoking the most vain of phantoms."
Pertinax proves he is right by pointing to Hungary's droll acceptance
of the pact and to the hesitancy of some Latin-American countries. He
thinks Mr. Kellogg's disinclination to obligatory arbitration will queer
the pact for the southern neighbors of the United States. He scorns
the idea that the pact does not morally obligate us to reduce our fleet.
A liberal paper, L'Oeuvre, finds that it is the Monroe Doctrine which
may block Secretary Kellogg's dream of making the anti-war pact uni
versal. "For the moment," it says, "Argentina HAS refused to kiss the
big stick of Uncle Sam, who, after all, is not her uncle at all."
It is thought that if the Senate scents an irreconcilibility of the pact
and the Monroe Doctrine, the pact will risk non-ratification. Probably
that will be got around by simply "interpreting" the Doctrine in some new
way. The Senate has ever been adept at that. Even if ratifiied, Mr.
Kellogg's agreement perhaps will not draw water in Europe as it is
hoped. And it is not surprising that other countries fail to take to heart
American criticisms of their policies when they see the hypocritical atti
tude of this country of defending intervention in Central America (when
intervention is perhaps defensible) by saying that it is in the interests of
"good government" for Central America.
