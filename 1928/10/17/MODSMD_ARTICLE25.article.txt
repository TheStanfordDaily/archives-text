There is no lack of interest in the campaign, but signs of intense ex
citement are wanting. No one is seriously afraid, whichever party may
win, of any policy or legislation which will be revolutionary or destructive.
Attempts by politicians to create fears of this kind have failed rather
comically. One indication that there is no special dread of the result of
this election however it may go, is the difficulty which the national com
mittees are encountering in raising money. Less than five weeks away
from the election, they have not yet procured one-half of the sums which
they deem to be absolutely necessary. It appears probable that both com
mittees will have to borrow money to cover the expenses which they
have contracted. This was not expected to be the case this year, and
surely would not have been if great business interests were under the
shadow of such political alarm as lay upon them in the campaign of
1896.
Political exertions will be put forth on a scale all the greater for this
uncertainty. If the party managers on either side were so confident of
victory as they pretend, they could take things easy from now on. In
their feverish activity, however, may be seen pretty clear proof that they
are as doubtful about the outcome of the campaign, in which perhaps
40,000,000 votes will be cast, as are the rest of us. It is a case of very
limited knowledge in the face of extensive ignorance.窶年ezv York Times.
The "Big C" song is sung in the classrooms of the University of Cali
fornia to raise the California spirit (which evidently is drooping), accord
ing to The Daily Californian for October 12. A new song, "Giants in
Red," has been adopted by the rally committee here. Would it be too
much to suggest that an effort be made to prevail upon the powers that
be to grant permission for the practicing of this new song and all old
ones for a few minutes in Stanford classes some day?

Now that Stanford has a varsity debate squad, will unsuccessful
candidates for the first string be relegated to the "goofs?"

There is no lack of interest in the campaign, but signs of intense ex
citement are wanting. No one is seriously afraid, whichever party may
win, of any policy or legislation which will be revolutionary or destructive.
Attempts by politicians to create fears of this kind have failed rather
comically. One indication that there is no special dread of the result of
this election however it may go, is the difficulty which the national com
mittees are encountering in raising money. Less than five weeks away
from the election, they have not yet procured one-half of the sums which
they deem to be absolutely necessary. It appears probable that both com
mittees will have to borrow money to cover the expenses which they
have contracted. This was not expected to be the case this year, and
surely would not have been if great business interests were under the
shadow of such political alarm as lay upon them in the campaign of
1896.
Political exertions will be put forth on a scale all the greater for this
uncertainty. If the party managers on either side were so confident of
victory as they pretend, they could take things easy from now on. In
their feverish activity, however, may be seen pretty clear proof that they
are as doubtful about the outcome of the campaign, in which perhaps
40,000,000 votes will be cast, as are the rest of us. It is a case of very
limited knowledge in the face of extensive ignorance.窶年ezv York Times.
The "Big C" song is sung in the classrooms of the University of Cali
fornia to raise the California spirit (which evidently is drooping), accord
ing to The Daily Californian for October 12. A new song, "Giants in
Red," has been adopted by the rally committee here. Would it be too
much to suggest that an effort be made to prevail upon the powers that
be to grant permission for the practicing of this new song and all old
ones for a few minutes in Stanford classes some day?

Now that Stanford has a varsity debate squad, will unsuccessful
candidates for the first string be relegated to the "goofs?"
