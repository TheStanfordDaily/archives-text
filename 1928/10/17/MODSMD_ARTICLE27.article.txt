TRIVIALITY! TRIVIALITY!
ALL IS TRIVIALITY!

The Nation contained an article
last week entitled, College Morality.
In quoted paragraph, this pointed
question, "Why wait to marry?" opens
the article. Having garnered facts
from tabulated interviews with HOG
college people, it goes on to prove
that such revolutionary questions re
main simply questions on the Ameri
can campus.
Students are conservatives among
the conservatives in regard to the
practical ethics of chastity or non
chastity. Then with resounding whack,
the article arraigns the American col
lege for triviality. Says the article,
smacking its lips complacently, "the
outstanding sin is the undergraduate's
absorption in triviality."
What, may it be asked, is meant by
triviality? "Student activities," snorts
back the caustic critic. "Student ac
tivities undermine the intellectual
morale of the college by creating an
alternative set of values in contrast
with academic values." Woof!
tWoe is me! Then all these years at
college, all these hours of sweating
amid the copy, heads, proofs, and
such claptrap of the Daily are utterly
squandered. Specious values
have I sought, academic values shun
ned. So, a total loss, I shall like an
Aiab fold up my typewriter and steal
silently away.

Did it ever occur to the writer of
The Nation article that tlie world is
not a gigantic research laboratory in
which isolated pedants totter hither
and yon proving that seven angels
and not six can dance on a needle
point? Did he ever consider that we
live in a society of men, not a her
barium? That the art of living to
gether and working together is mas
tered best in the doing?
No one denies that academic values
(providing the values obtained from
delving into the whole range of hu
man knowledge are meant) are not
vitally essential. But what would be
the worth of a university in which
dreary pedants pored over musty
tomes, introverted to such a degree
that should they discover a salient
truth, they would be unable to trans
mit it to their fellows. Or what would
be the worth of a university in which
every student was clowning around
joining a dozen clubs, fraternities,
and societies, editing a half-dozen
publications, straining his muscles in
several sports, and appearing in a
campus play weekly?
Both sets of values have their place
in the scheme of university educa
tion. Witness the Stanford scene.
Both are present. Scholarship holds
its head high, as do activities. The
two can be combined admirably and
in mahy instances in individual stu
dents. —Calvin D. Wood.
