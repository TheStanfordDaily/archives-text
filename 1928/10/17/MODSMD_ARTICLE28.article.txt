The Editor, Sir:
In search of the light, we lose our
ability to discern it. I am willing to
write a testimonial to the effect that
before poring over the small print in our
texts I was the possessor of big blue
eyes. Now, I have squeamish, watery,
slanted, green eyes! In Shakespeare—
English 25—the fashionable assignment
is only one play a night with a few re
ports for spare time, but the text sup
plied (.for $3) has such tiny print that
the good scholars are apt to be rewarded
with blindness. Why doesn't someone
educated along lines of common sense or
hygiene instruct our faculty as to the
advantages of being able to see the
clever sayings in the bibles of intellectual
progress which they prescribe! Mean
while, since our faculty changes texts
quite a bit more often than regularly,
there should be a gambling chance of liit
i ting a book with temperate print before
I study the Braille method.
—'29 and Sick at the Eyes
P.S.—I realize that my objections are
somewhat offset by the opportunity given
of spending more time on small print
than would otherwise be employed on
assignments.
The Editor, Sir:
An article appearing in the Tuesday
edition of the Daily seems to me to be
of a calibre lower than that expected of
a college student. I refer to the article
on the coming presidential election by
Virgil K. Whitaker.
It is expected that it would be in
tensely partisan in spite of what has been
said on the use of the scientific method
and attitude. When it is found to be
also unfair, almost without a foundation,
and illogically expressed, is it not to be
expected that a reader should wonder?
To begin with, Mr. Whitaker states
that while Smith received his political

] training in the laboratory, Hoover is an
unrivaled engineer and executive. How
ever, Hoover too has received political
laboratory training, but in the fields
which better equip a man for the position
of chief executive of his country. I refer
I to his national and international experi
! ence against which Smith can offer only
that of a distinctly sectional nature.
Mr. Whitaker gives entire credit to
j Governor Smith for such social legisla
i tion as deal with labor, hospitalization,
land asylums, which Smith, unaided by
! popular support and legislative action
j could never have passed. The governor
! merely signed his name to a hill. On the
j other hand the anti-social legislation ap
proved by Smith such as open saloons
j on Sundays and saloons in proximity to
j schools is not mentioned. Yet these are
J facts, and as such are on record.
He calls Smith a progressive, yet many
of the New Yorker's policies are re
i actionary in nature. He accepts the word
of a city man on farm relief rather than
that of a farmer's son who is an author
ity on economics. He states that the
| farmers' goods are not protected by
! tariff, while in reality many agricultural
products ,are. He tells us next that a
protective tariff on farm products is un
necessary while any well informed person
knows the contrary to be the case.
What Mr. Whitaker has stated in re
gard to party history is not worth
! heeding. Some of his "facts" are not
true, and if they were would signify
little. In the latter case he would merely
be comparing a bad egg to a good
tomato. But we know that all good docs
not radiate from the Democrats while
all bad comes from the Republicans. If
he were to compare all the deeds of the
Republicans with all those of the Demo
crats and keep supposition in the hack
ground, I believe the party, pride of our
Republican candidate would be justifiable.

He calls Smith a progressive, yet many
of the New Yorker's policies are re
i actionary in nature. He accepts the word
of a city man on farm relief rather than
that of a farmer's son who is an author
ity on economics. He states that the
| farmers' goods are not protected by
! tariff, while in reality many agricultural
products ,are. He tells us next that a
protective tariff on farm products is un
necessary while any well informed person
knows the contrary to be the case.
What Mr. Whitaker has stated in re
gard to party history is not worth
! heeding. Some of his "facts" are not
true, and if they were would signify
little. In the latter case he would merely
be comparing a bad egg to a good
tomato. But we know that all good docs
not radiate from the Democrats while
all bad comes from the Republicans. If
he were to compare all the deeds of the
Republicans with all those of the Demo
crats and keep supposition in the hack
ground, I believe the party, pride of our
Republican candidate would be justifiable.

The Editor, Sir:
In search of the light, we lose our
ability to discern it. I am willing to
write a testimonial to the effect that
before poring over the small print in our
texts I was the possessor of big blue
eyes. Now, I have squeamish, watery,
slanted, green eyes! In Shakespeare—
English 25—the fashionable assignment
is only one play a night with a few re
ports for spare time, but the text sup
plied (.for $3) has such tiny print that
the good scholars are apt to be rewarded
with blindness. Why doesn't someone
educated along lines of common sense or
hygiene instruct our faculty as to the
advantages of being able to see the
clever sayings in the bibles of intellectual
progress which they prescribe! Mean
while, since our faculty changes texts
quite a bit more often than regularly,
there should be a gambling chance of liit
i ting a book with temperate print before
I study the Braille method.

P.S.—I realize that my objections are
somewhat offset by the opportunity given
of spending more time on small print
than would otherwise be employed on

The Editor, Sir:
An article appearing in the Tuesday
edition of the Daily seems to me to be
of a calibre lower than that expected of
a college student. I refer to the article
on the coming presidential election by
Virgil K. Whitaker.
It is expected that it would be in
tensely partisan in spite of what has been
said on the use of the scientific method
and attitude. When it is found to be
also unfair, almost without a foundation,
and illogically expressed, is it not to be
expected that a reader should wonder?
To begin with, Mr. Whitaker states
that while Smith received his political

] training in the laboratory, Hoover is an
unrivaled engineer and executive. How
ever, Hoover too has received political
laboratory training, but in the fields
which better equip a man for the position
of chief executive of his country. I refer
I to his national and international experi
! ence against which Smith can offer only
that of a distinctly sectional nature.
Mr. Whitaker gives entire credit to
j Governor Smith for such social legisla
i tion as deal with labor, hospitalization,
land asylums, which Smith, unaided by
! popular support and legislative action
j could never have passed. The governor
! merely signed his name to a hill. On the
j other hand the anti-social legislation ap
proved by Smith such as open saloons
j on Sundays and saloons in proximity to
j schools is not mentioned. Yet these are
J facts, and as such are on record.
