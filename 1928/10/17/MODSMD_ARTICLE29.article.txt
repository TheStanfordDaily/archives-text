Houdini: His Life Story. By Harold
Kellock (Harcourt, Brace and Com
pany, 1928.)
Harold Kelloek's "Houdini" is one of
the most fascinating biographies written
for many a day. It is the tale not only
of a magician, but of a dynamic person
ality.
The story was written by Mr. Kellock
from the diary and personal reminis
censes of Houdini told him by his wife.
Vividly is traced the life of young Erich
Weiss, who took the name Harry Hou
dini from that of his hero, Robert-Hou
din, from the time that he said to his
twelve-dollar-a-week audience, "You can
see, ladies and gentlemen that I ain't got
nothing up my sleeve," until the day that
lie became the greatest drawing card that
New York playhouses had ever known.
Not Detailed
The most disappointing aspect of the
book is that not cnoiißh is told of the
great magician's tricks. How he escaped
from packing boxes, how be struggled
out of handcuffs and strait jackets, how,
securely fettered in ropes or irons he
freed himself, the explanation of all this
has gone to the grave with him.
What was most unusual in Houdini's
art, was that all his tricks were the fruit
of almost superhuman effort, and not
sham. Often it took him more than a
half hour to free himself from his ties
while his audience waited patiently; after
which time he would appear with cloth
ing in shreds, blood streaming from

wounds incurred by his struggles, but
always with a smile of victory on his
lips. For Houdini, no matter under what
circumstances, always appeared freed.
His crusade against spirit seances
caused nation-wide attention. He threw
himself into his work of exposing medi
ums with his characteristic vigor. Every
one of their tricks he was aide to repro
duce with ease. Kellock explains a num
ber of these. Houdini was straight-for
ward, impulsive, energetic, intensive, at
all times, a man who slept from as few
as two to four hours a night.
