# MOSER RETURNS FROM WELDING SOCIETY MEET
## 
### 
Professor Charles Moser of the
Civil Engineering department has re
turned to the University from a trip j
of several weeks to the East where
ho attended a convention of the j
American Welding Society in Phila-1
delpliia from October 8 to 12. He
presented a paper on "The Tension i
Tests of Steel Welds at Elevated !
Temperatures," which was a report I
on the results of tests made by the j
San Francisco section of the Ameri- j
can Welding Society and the Stanford |
School of Engineering.
On his trip Professor Moser visited
a number of universities for the pur
pose of seeing their materials and
hydraulic laboratories. His work was
carried on here during his absence by
