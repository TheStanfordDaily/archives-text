THIS TROJAN BUSINESS
Stanford plays Idaho Friday in San
Francisco's new Kezar stadium. Card
fandom may be there in body, but in
, spirit it will be South, hurling challenges
at the frowning walls of Troy.
Charley Erbre's Vandals possibly are a
; team to be conjured with, but the fact
< remains that Stanford is thinking now
i of what will happen when Warner and
his cohorts invade Southern California.
Los Angeles sports writers,
with cha r acteristic modesty, de
clare that Williams is better than
Drury. They said last year that
Drury was superior to Kaer. The
season before it was broadcast
that Kaer could outplay Hawkins
on anybody's football team, and
so on, far into the night.
And they may have been, and
j may be still, right in their judg
ment. U. S. C. has never lacked
its "Thundering Herd" of "All-
Americans."
It is interesting, though, to specu
late as to what manner of gridmen the
j Trojan school will have in ten years or
j so, and what manner of superlatives will
i be used by L. A. scribes to describe
j these campus idols. Certainly the South-
I land will have some high powered foot
| ball players in a few more years, if the
j present pace of superlatives is continued.
And now that that is all considered,
the Los Angeles writers may be for-

I gotten for a few moments, and, more
! or less cold facts considered.
There is no doubt that the Stanford
' mob, which treks southward in boats,
| automobiles, box cars and Pullmans, will
I see a great gridiron machine in the Tro
jan hosts. It will see a team that is
destined to give Stanford's best a ter
s riffic battle. It will sec a team which bids
fair to whip the Warnermen.
For U. S. C.is in no pleasant
mood. Too often has the white
jerseyed horde cheated them out
of a victory. Defeat, sincerely
i believed undeserved, has a bitter
flavor for the loser.
If one is inclined to be gloomy,
the prospects against U. S. C. are
none too rosy. Unless Stanford
is considerably more superior to
the Trojans than in other years,
the odds seem against the Cards.
If the teams are again on the
practically even basis they were
in the last three years, the breaks
are likely to go to Southern
California. Luck can't hold for
ever.
Of course, the possibility remains that
Stanford is really enough better this
season to trounce the Trojans by a com
fortable score. If that is true the argu
ment about breaks and luck is feeble.
Whether or not that is true can be
decided with greater accuracy and fewer
words after Southern California meets
' the Bears at Berkeley Saturday.
