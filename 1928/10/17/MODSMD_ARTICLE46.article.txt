# SPORTS OF 1928
## Nothing But The Truth 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The most popular choice for Presi
dent right now is not Herb Hoover
or A1 Smith or Will Rogers, but
George Herman Ruth, alias Babe, :
who, when one is speaking of
"aliases" caused the Elias brothers, |
A1 and Walter, to work overtime dur- i
ing the series to keep track of the
new records he was setting daily. And
the Big Bam set them gaily too, as
well as daily, for in spite of a lame
knee and the strain of a world series i
competition, Babe Ruth had more fun
out of the last game with St. Louis |
than in any other game he ever
played. What a ball player that fel
low is! What a man! What a hitter!
Before putting the late lamented
world series away in moth balls for
the winter and turning our sole atten
tion to football, let us glance at the !
accomplishments of this Atlas of Base-1

. ball, who, back in 1915 just faced
j Grover Alexander as a pinch-hitter in
; the Boston-Philadelphia world series,
| and who, in 1916 and 1918, was one
| of the best southpaw pitchers in the
i majors.
This year the whole St. Louis team
I scored 10 runs in the four-game series.
Babe Ruth scored one less than that
himself. The Battering Bam got 10
hits for a total of 22 bases, while the
Spiritless St. Louisans got 27 for 37
\ bases.
All in all, the Babe rewrote the rec
i ord book as far as World Series per
formances go, setting 19 new records
in the four contests (if you could call
'em contests!). The big boy's batting
average of .625 is almost unbeliev
able, especially since the Big Truck
| was suffering from a flat tire.
Sure, Ruth can have my vote for
President any time he wants it!
