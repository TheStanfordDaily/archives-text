### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 16. (/P)— A
few more injuries, and Coach Howard
Jones will have to hire a hospital
train to take his Trojan football team
to Berkeley. Six of his best men are
hobbling about the University of
Southern California campus with
canes, crutches, and difficulty.
Russ Saunders, backfield handyman,
Harry Edelson, halfback, and Lowry
McCaslin, three first-string men, re
ceived injuries last Saturday which
may keep them out of the California
game at Berkeley Saturday. None of
them have been in suits since being
hurt. Saunders injured a muscle in
his hip, McCaslin's knee was twisted,
and Edelson's left ankle was badly
bruised and wrenched. Francis Tap
pan, another end, also is in a doubt
ful condition with a burst blood ves
sel in his leg.
For some time, Charley Boren and
John Porter, both guards, have been
out of commission, Porter wearing a
cast on his knee. Both of Boren's
knees are weakened, and he is not ex
pected to play regularly any more
this season. Captain Jesse Hibbs, big
ail-American tackle, was unable to
play against St. Mary's because of a
hurt ankle, but was back in a suit last
night and scrimmaged without fur
ther injury. "Dutch" Wilcox partly
made up for the loss of McCaslin by
appearing again in the lineup at end,
having recovered from an injured
ankle.
