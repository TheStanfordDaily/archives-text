# Must Understand Desert To Know Arab Says Hulme
## Heat Stimulates Mind, Body, But Nature Does Not Stir Imagination 
### 
"To understand the Arab it is neces
sary to understand the desert," de
clared Professor Edward Maslin
Hulme in his lecture on "Life Among
the Arabs of French North Africa"
last night in the Assembly Hall.
"Heat of the desert stimulates the
mind and body of man rather than
depresses him," he said, "but gives
him nothing to think of in nature.
There are no trees, no pools, no
clouds or human associations, and
unqualified light everywhere. It fails
to nourish the emotions and imagina
tion, and as a result the Arab cannot
think logically and consecutively.
"No good social qualities are found
among these desert men. They are in
dividualists and realists, looking at
life objectively and lacking in imagi
nation and social solidarity. But many
of their personal qualities are fine.
They are artists in manners, courte
ous, and with a marked poetic strain,
while at the same time the desert
ha 3 made them courageous, wary, and
alert. They love the desert, and none
are so homesick separated from their
homeland as these people.
"Desert sands are constantly threat
ening to swallow the oases, as they
are sifted by the winds. So in the
same way the Arabs are destructive,
impulsive, and moved by whims. The
Arab never acts on the basis of ethi
cal principle but only on sentiment.
All have a profound aversion for law
and order, and not one has a word
of gratitude for what the French have
done for them."
