# GAIETY DEADLINE DATE ADVANCED TO OCTOBER 25
## 
### 
In order that there will be sufficient
time to make the "Football Gaieties"
into a production with some sem
blance of unity, the deadline for the
submission of all ideas has been
moved ahead from November 1, as
originally announced, to October 25.
In the past, the football show has
100 often been a hodge-podge of sldts
and dances, but this year Ram's Head,
under whose auspices the show is
given, desires to present an entertain
ment that will be somewhat unified,
according to Hal Boomer, president.
These skits, specialties and novel
ties, "hot-spots," and musical numbers
do not have to be presented in their
finished form at this deadline, Boomer
announced. Just the outlines or short
r6p<um6s of the ideas are needed at
first by the committee, so they may
work them over to fit in with the rest
of the show. Manuscripts should be
mailed to Paul Speegle at the Chi Psi
house, and ideas of musical numbers
are to be submitted to Jack Meakin,
at the Phi Kappa Sigma house.
On Tuesday and Wednesday after
noon, between 2 and 3 o'clock, the
committee in charge of the perform
ance will meet in the Green Room, at
the English corner, to see anyone who
wants to talk over any ideas for the
"Gaieties" entertainment.
