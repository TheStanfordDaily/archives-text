i people interested in this special form
iof welfare work, and most of it has
been donated by those who are nei
ther interested in the University or
the Mothers Club.
A charge of $2 per day is levied
upon the students in order to cover
the expense of medicine, food, and
service. Students may only have ac
j cess to rest homes through recom
i mendation of Dr. Thomas Storey, or
I Dr. Clelia Mosher.
The rest houses are not connected

corporated into it.

before the Mothers Club, which held
its first meeting of the year yesterday
afternoon in the Women's Clubhouse.
The house for the women will be
ready for occupancy in a short time.
Two rooms and a large sleeping
porch have been reserved for the men
at the Chester Thomas home on Alva
rado street, under the direction of
Mrs. S. Morrison. There is place for
eight men according to the type of
illness. "Certain types of cases might
need complete rest," said Mrs. Shoup,
"and under these circumstances we
would not be able to take as many
patients as usual."
Two rooms are being prepared for
the women by Mrs. L. J. Owen on
Salvatierra street. She will be able
to accommodate four. The rest houses
are established by the Mothers Club
for the purpose of those students who
nre run down and need rest, those
who may need special diets, or those
who are convalescing from operations

or other illness.
The Mothers Club has charge of
i the financing of these homes. Money
has been contributed chiefly from
i people interested in this special form
iof welfare work, and most of it has
been donated by those who are nei
ther interested in the University or
the Mothers Club.
A charge of $2 per day is levied
upon the students in order to cover
the expense of medicine, food, and
service. Students may only have ac
j cess to rest homes through recom
i mendation of Dr. Thomas Storey, or
I Dr. Clelia Mosher.
The rest houses are not connected
in any way with the University as far
; as finances are concerned. According
j to Mrs. Shoup, it is hoped that there
may soiye day be a permanent en
| dowment by which they may be in
corporated into it.
The officers of the Mothers Club
who were elected last spring quarter
were installed at the meeting. Mrs.
John E. McDowell Is the new presi
dent; Mrs. Solon Shedd, secretary;
and Mrs. C. A. White, treasurer.
