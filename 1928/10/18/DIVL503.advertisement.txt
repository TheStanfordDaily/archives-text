Jogging along Palm Drive in the finest "turn
out" from Jones' Livery—that was the thing for
the "queener" in the days of our Dads. Dad
could snip off any daisy, or exterminate any
butterfly with one expert snap of the buggy
whip.
But may we utter the platitude: Times have
changed. Dad's clothes were almost as funny
as the carriage he rode in. Today the university
man rides in a colorful roadster—and he is
dressed accordingly.
Plielps-Terkel is not only abreast of the chang
ing styles, but is always a step ahead of them.
We have everything for the university ward
robe. Suits $40.00 up.
