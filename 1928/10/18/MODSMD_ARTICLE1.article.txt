# POP TO START RESERVE MEN AGAINST IDAHO
## Frentrup, Muller, Davidson Will Replace Injured Regulars in Game With Vandals 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Three men from the reserves will
start the first team tomorrow after
noon when Stanford meets Idaho in
the affair that christens San Fran
cisco's new Kezar Stadium. The War
ner team is still haunted by the
■casualty ghost which necessitates the
remodeling of the Cardinal lineup.
The starting lineup which Pop War
ner announced yesterday reveals that
Frank Wilton will be replaced by Lud
Frentrup at left half and that Hodge
Davidson and Mush Muller will play
the end positions instead of Spud
Harder and Dick Worden. Wilton
took part in practice yesterday but is
still bothered by his injured leg which
undoubtedly, will keep him out of the
game. Frentrup had been out with a
similar injury, but if his running at
practice is any evidence, he has com
pletely recovered and will be as fast
as ever with the ball.
The announced lineup follows:
Stanford — Idaho—
Muller LER Burgher (C)
Sellman LTR Sumpter
Post LGR Martin
Heinecke C Kirkpatrick
Robesky RGL Brimhall
Artman RTL Diehl
Davidson REL Price
Fleishhacker Q Robertson
Frentrup LHR Cheyne
Sims RHL Hutchinson
Hoffman C) F Kershisnik
Play Kicking Game
In the three games that Charlie
Erb's Idaho Vandals have played this
season, kicking has been a big fac
tor of their game as it was on- Andy
Smith's "Wonder Teams" that Erb di
rected as quarterback. Idaho usually
plays the old Andy Smith style of
game—"kick, and wait for breaks." In
the event that they attempt that kind
of game tomorrow their kicker will
have to go some to outdc Biff Hoff
man. Biff spent a part of yesterday's
practice session at punting and
all of his kicks out for more than

sixty yards.
Like Stanford, Coach Erb's men
have been slow in getting up steam,
but have been showing weekly im
provement and should be in shape
for a tough tussle tomorrow. They
started with a defeat, then tied Gon
zaga, and last week trounced Whit
man 26-13.
