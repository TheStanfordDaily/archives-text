# HOOVER TO LEAVE CAPITAL FOR STANFORD OCTOBER 30
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. (/P)— Her
bert Hoover is to conduct a "front
porch" campaign during the week in
tervening between his last eastern
trip, that to New York City next Mon
day, and his departure for his Cali
fornia home to vote on election day.

In that period a number of delega
tions are expected to call on the Re
publican presidential candidates at his
headquarters here and in his talks to
them he will emphasize what he has
advanced as the paramount issues of
the campaign and the manner in
which his party will deal with them
if it is granted a further extension of
the administration of government.

Between the visits of these delega
tions Hoover will find time to pre
pare the last two formal speeches he
will make during the campaign. One
is to be delivered in the Middle West
while he is en route to Palo Alto, and
the other over the radio from the
study of his home on the afternoon
of November 5.

While the itinerary of the trans
continental trip still is to be approved
finally, the G.O.P. standard-bearer
probably will leave Washington on
October 29 or 30 and make his speech
en route on either November 1 or 2.

A nation-wide radio hook-up has been
arranged for tentatively on November
2, but it is stated that this can be
changed to the night of November 1
if that date will fit in better with
Hoover's plans.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 17.
cism of federal finance methods and
accomplishment voiced by Governor
Smith, Democratic presidential nomi
nee, at Sedalia, Mo., yesterday, drew
prompt fire today from administration
spokesmen.

Secretary Mellon from the Treasury
Department issued an official state

address exhibits the most superficial
knowledge of what has actually taken
place, and in citing figures he has
been guilty of what even the most
charitably minded would have to de
scribe as inaccuracies."

The World War Food Administration
record of Herbert Hoover was de
clared to have been "entirely friendly"
to the American farmer by Senator
William E. Borah, of Idaho, in his
second and final campaign address
here tonight in the traditionally
Democratic state of North Carolina.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. (/P)— Her
bert Hoover is to conduct a "front
porch" campaign during the week in
tervening between his last eastern
trip, that to New York City next Mon
day, and his departure for his Cali
fornia home to vote on election day.

In that period a number of delega
tions are expected to call on the Re
publican presidential candidates at his
headquarters here and in his talks to
them he will emphasize what he has
advanced as the paramount issues of
the campaign and the manner in
which his party will deal with them
if it is granted a further extension of
the administration of government.

Between the visits of these delega
tions Hoover will find time to pre
pare the last two formal speeches he
will make during the campaign. One
is to be delivered in the Middle West
while he is en route to Palo Alto, and
the other over the radio from the
study of his home on the afternoon
of November 5.

While the itinerary of the trans
continental trip still is to be approved
finally, the G.O.P. standard-bearer
probably will leave Washington on
October 29 or 30 and make his speech
en route on either November 1 or 2.

A nation-wide radio hook-up has been
arranged for tentatively on November
2, but it is stated that this can be
changed to the night of November 1
if that date will fit in better with
Hoover's plans.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 17.
cism of federal finance methods and
accomplishment voiced by Governor
Smith, Democratic presidential nomi
nee, at Sedalia, Mo., yesterday, drew
prompt fire today from administration
spokesmen.

Secretary Mellon from the Treasury
Department issued an official state
ment declaring that Smith's "whole
address exhibits the most superficial
knowledge of what has actually taken
place, and in citing figures he has
been guilty of what even the most
charitably minded would have to de
scribe as inaccuracies."
