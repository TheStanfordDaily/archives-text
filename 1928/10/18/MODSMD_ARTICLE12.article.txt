# FROSH TO MEET GAEL YEARLINGS HERE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman grid
ders will run up against their first stiff
competition of the year next Saturday
morning when they meet the St. Mary's
yearlings in the Stadium at 10 o'clock.
The St. Mary's team is reported to be
an unusually strong defensive eleven,
though lacking power on offense. It was
defeated 19 to 6 two weeks ago by the
California frosh.

Husky at present is faced with a short
age of quarterbacks, all four possessing
an injury of one kind or another. Marks,
first string quarter, received a bad cut
under his left eye in the Pasadena game
last week which has not completely
healed. Thigpin, second choice for this
position, has a broken rib and, together
with McGuire and Dixon, the other
quarters, did not show up for practice
yesterday. Eichelberger, reserve full
back, though in a suit yesterday, has a
broken nose.
There was no scrimmage yesterday and
will be none the rest of this wek, Husky
guarding against the possibility of any
more players being put on the injured list.
This afternoon's workout will probably
be nothing more than a brief passing,
kicking, and signal practice. There will
be no practice tomorrow.
