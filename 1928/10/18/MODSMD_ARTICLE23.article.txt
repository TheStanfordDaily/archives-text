NEW YORK, Oct. 17. (/P)â€”' The
stock market, having advanced rather
steadily for a week or more, ran into
heavy profit-taking today, but major
speculative operations were again on
the up-side. Spectacular advances of
5 to nearly 20 points took place in a
few specialties and net gains of 1 to
4 points in a long list of standard rails
and industrials were offset by a size
able group of net declines, several of
which ran from 2 to 5 points.
