# Rest Homes for the Sore-Distressed
## 
### 
A further expansion of health service for students was announced
yesterday by the Mothers Club. Rest homes for men and women have
been fitted up and now are available for convalescent cases which no
longer need attention at the Palo Alto hospital but still are not in condi
tion to return to their living groups.

The Mothers Club deserves the greatest praise for this most recent
extension of its manifold services to students. At the rate of $2 per day,
those who are ill and sore-distressed may find quiet, rest, and nutritious
food. There are many who on acount of illness need a place for con
valescence after spending in the hospital the two weeks, during which the
Student Guild assists them financially. Such convalescents will be re
manded, upon the recommendation of Dr. Storey or Dr. Mosher, to the

rest homes.
Financing the new health project will be no easy thing for the Mothers
Club. Indeed, it will be so difficult that the service probably will neces
sarily be limited unless outsiders give aid to the mothers. Eventually,
the University ought to take it over, because it is a reasonable and
necessary complement to the present service for which the Student
Guild money is being expended.
Many are the good works which the Mothers Club has done and is
doing on the campus, but the establishment of the rest homes for the
men and women is one of the most far-sighted and thoughtful.
