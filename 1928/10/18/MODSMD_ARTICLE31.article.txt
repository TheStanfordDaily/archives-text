# Organized Rudeness
## 
### 
The Stanford Hymn, a majority of us will agree, is the most im
pressive contribution which our rooting section makes to any football
game. Why, then, must it invariably be ruined by an assortment of
tiresome and superfluous yells before and after singing? The final
mellow strains, .. . Hail, Stanford, hail," float over the stadium —and
then, like a kick in the face, breaking the entire spell, comes the "Varsity."
Even on the rare occasions when this tag-end yell is not rendered com
pletely out of focus, it is a displeasing hangover to the perfect climax
which the Hymn furnishes.

At almost every contest during the past four years, Stanford has been
guilty of unintentional but inexcusable rudeness to the opposing rooting
section. The post-game cheering and singing are meant to be an ex
change of courtesies between rooting sections —not a marathon contest.
Yet, because cheer leaders appear unwilling to get a New Idea, we have
kept our friendly rivals waiting patiently while we cheered far into the

night.
When we have won, this habit of overdoing the curtain calls sounds
like bragging. When we have lost, it sounds like sour grapes. In either
case, it sounds like the devil.
At one game a couple of years ago the after-gun program was as
follows: three miscellaneous yells, seven succssive "Sky-rockets," and
the inevitable "Varsity" as a chaser to the Hymn. Our stupid perform
ance following the U.C.L.A. game last Saturday was a good object
lesson. An opening broadcast of off-time cheers was followed by the
Hymn, surviving as best it could in spite of a cornet which gave the
wrong key and enthusiasts yowling "Hats off!" The "Varsity" was then
rendered perfectly helpless—and, along about the time that the band
struck up in all its pristine magnificence, somebody happened to think
that the U.C.L.A. supporters might wish to sing their own Hymn.
When the band had been howled down, this assumption proved cor
rect. The small group of U.C.L.A. rooters, who had traveled five hun
dred miles to see their team beaten in its first Conference game, sang
their song simply and well. That was all. They lost the game by forty
points, but they won the rooting forty ways.
Somehow we haven't got around just yet to discovering what the
recent Annual Conference of Pacific Coast Yell Leaders was all about,
but we trust that among other knotty decisions was the following: that
the post-game cheering and singing are meant to be an exchange of
courtesies.
What we need is more Hymn and less hubbub. —W. N.

like bragging. When we have lost, it sounds like sour grapes. In either
case, it sounds like the devil.
At one game a couple of years ago the after-gun program was as
follows: three miscellaneous yells, seven succssive "Sky-rockets," and
the inevitable "Varsity" as a chaser to the Hymn. Our stupid perform
ance following the U.C.L.A. game last Saturday was a good object
lesson. An opening broadcast of off-time cheers was followed by the
Hymn, surviving as best it could in spite of a cornet which gave the
wrong key and enthusiasts yowling "Hats off!" The "Varsity" was then
rendered perfectly helpless—and, along about the time that the band
struck up in all its pristine magnificence, somebody happened to think
that the U.C.L.A. supporters might wish to sing their own Hymn.
When the band had been howled down, this assumption proved cor
rect. The small group of U.C.L.A. rooters, who had traveled five hun
dred miles to see their team beaten in its first Conference game, sang
their song simply and well. That was all. They lost the game by forty
points, but they won the rooting forty ways.
Somehow we haven't got around just yet to discovering what the
recent Annual Conference of Pacific Coast Yell Leaders was all about,
but we trust that among other knotty decisions was the following: that
the post-game cheering and singing are meant to be an exchange of
courtesies.
What we need is more Hymn and less hubbub. —W. N.

Tryoutces for the editorial staff of the Daily will meet at 1 o'clock

The Stanford Hymn, a majority of us will agree, is the most im
pressive contribution which our rooting section makes to any football
game. Why, then, must it invariably be ruined by an assortment of
tiresome and superfluous yells before and after singing? The final
mellow strains, .. . Hail, Stanford, hail," float over the stadium —and
then, like a kick in the face, breaking the entire spell, comes the "Varsity."
Even on the rare occasions when this tag-end yell is not rendered com
pletely out of focus, it is a displeasing hangover to the perfect climax
which the Hymn furnishes.

At almost every contest during the past four years, Stanford has been
guilty of unintentional but inexcusable rudeness to the opposing rooting
section. The post-game cheering and singing are meant to be an ex
change of courtesies between rooting sections —not a marathon contest.
Yet, because cheer leaders appear unwilling to get a New Idea, we have
kept our friendly rivals waiting patiently while we cheered far into the

night.
When we have won, this habit of overdoing the curtain calls sounds
like bragging. When we have lost, it sounds like sour grapes. In either
case, it sounds like the devil.
