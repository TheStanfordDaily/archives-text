Editor of the Daily, Sir:
Allow me to state that a certain
Hui-Wen Chang's article, appearing in
the Stanford Daily, Friday, October
12, under the caption of "Campus
Opinion" gives your readers a great
deal of misinformation.

In the beginning of the article, it
seems as though Mr. H. W. Chang is
criticizing Mr. Yusuke Tsurumi, a
noted Japanese liberal leader who de
livered an address here in the Gen
eral Assembly Hall, Tuesday evening,
October 9, and a portion of his ad
dress relative to Japanese liberal
policy toward China. But reading his
article further down, one can not fail
to see that he is playing the part of a
cheap propagandist, trying to blind
the eyes of the world with fictitious
and deeply colored stories. To me and
to the informed persons, his stories,
particularly those concerning the
"Tsinan Outrage," are ridiculous. A
notable example of his fiction is his
attribution of the atrocious acts com
mitted by Chinese troops to Japanese
troops. To prove the fact, it is need
less to go back too far to the "Nan
king Outrage" of last year ..Time —
April 4, 1927) when much American
and Japanese property was looted by
Chinese, and American and Japanese
citizens killed; the incident in which
a Chinese troop captured and insulted
an American lady and held her for
ransome; the most vicious acts on
the part of the itinerant so-called
Christian War Lord, Feng Yu-hsiang,
who looted and defiled the tomb of
Yuan, the second president of China,
for a pecuniary purpose (Time: Janu
ary 23, 1928), and other outrages. In
the recent "Tsinan Outrage" many
atrocious acts were committed by the
Nationalist army. In their march to
ward Twinan, a group of Nationalist
soldiers rushed for the women's dor
mitory of a mission school with in
tent to possess themselves of its oc
cupants. When an American citizen,
Rev. Dr. Walter F. Seymour, G5, super
intendent of the United States Pres
byterian Mission Hospital at Tsining,
sought to bar the dormitory door, the
brutal soldiers shot him down (Time:
May 7, 1925). Many Japanese civil
ian residents were also shot down
after their noses were cut off and
eyes gouged out. .Asahi, May 9, 1928 .
What is more irritating is the Chinese
soldiers' attitude toward helpless wo
men. It is too much for me to describe
it and I shall leave this matter to the
imagination of the readers.

Chinese troops are not troops in
the real sense of the term. Army disci
pline is completely lacking. They lay
clown arms it' bribed, turn into bandits
if there is something good to loot,
and rape if they find helpless women.
The "Nanking Outrage" of last year
and the recent "Tsinan Outrage" are
examples of what Chinese troops do.
The clash between Japanese and
Chinese troops in Tsinan occurred, to
use the Outlook's words, in the follow-

ing fashion:
"The Japanese forbade the Chinese
to interfere with the railway (Japa
nese) a warning that the Chinese
flouted by blowing up a bridge. Ac
cording to the latest accounts, the
Japanese officials at Tsinanfu at
tempted to maintain neutrality to
ward the Nationalists and their north
ern enemies, withdrawing Japanese
residents to two barricaded zones.
After the Nationalists occupied the
city, their unruly soldiers swarmed
around the barricades, and their com
mander demanded that the obstruc
tions be removed. The Japanese com
plied and the Nationalists entered the
foreign zone, and began posting up

anti-Japanese posters. Disorder de
veloped. When an attempt to loot a
Japanese shop was resisted, shooting
started. Each side claims that the
other fired first. From the row the
fighting spread. Evidently, a consider
able number of Japanese civilians
lost their lives. Chinese soldiers fired
on Japanese negotiators carrying a
flag of truce. The Japanese comman
der issued an ultimatum to the Chi
nese to withdraw from their positions
in and around the town. The Chinese
tried to storm it and drive out the
Japanese. A pitched battle resulted."
— (Outlook, May 23, 1928.-

Thus the Chinese troops are re
sponsible for the crash.
Now coming back to the original
question, I wish to call the readers'
attention to the fact that Japan has a
great deal of vested rights in China,
particularly in Manchuria and Shan
tung. There are 190,000 Japanese citi
zens in Shantung and other parts of
interior China. They are engaged in
trade and industries with investments
amounting to several billions of dol
lars. Japan has to protect the lives
and property of her own nationals in
China, because China has no stable
government strong enough to keep
peace and order within her own
limits. The dispatch of troops into
China should not be considered as
interference in Chinese domestic af
fairs. It is only for the purpose of
protecting Japanese nationals in

China placed in the awful predica
ment by the outrageous civil war. The
warning to China not to extend the
civil war to Manchuria is not an inter
vention but a protection and one to
which Japan is entitled as a nation.

Due to the constant civil wars, dis
order is prevalent in China and she is
unable to protect even her own na
tionals, not to speak of the foreigners
residing within her boundaries.
Therefore, to cope with this situation,
we have rapidly been creating a sub
stantial fabric of international law
relating to China. Dispatch of troops
by an interested state into China for
the protection of lives and property
of her own nations in case of a civil
war is a perfectly justifiable thing.
This does not mean an encroachment
upon Chinese territory.! Japan, it
must be noted, stands strongly for

the independence and integrity of
China. She has signed solemn trea
ties to that effect. Had it been Japan's
intention to dismember China, she
would not have signed these treaties.
Recently, Japan has relinquished all

her claims 011 the-Shantung peninsula, j
j except the payment in connection I
with a railroad, in favor of China. 1
Had it not been for Japan's friendly
will toward China, she would not have
relinquished the claims on the penin-:
| sula which she had taken over from
I Germany in the World War. If this is I

; not liberal policy toward China, 1
' wonder what it will be?
Though we could not support the
| recent Chinese attempt to abolish uni
; laterally all existing treaties between
her and other powers, because such
an act is a flagrant violation of the
I principles of international law, we are

| perfectly willing to help China in any
j manner conformable to the principles
of international law and induce other
powers, if necessary, to pave the way
for China's advancement.
| Taking a portion of Mr. Tsurumi's
; speech and presenting it to the inno
cent readers in such a way as to mis
! inform them after the speaker has
gone is not a manly act. If Mr. Chang
presented the question in the Assem
bly Hall that evening when Mr.
Tsurumi announced right after his

' speech that he would be glad to an
swer any question, Mr. Tsurumi would
luive answered It ably and Mr. Chang
could have escaped condemnation of
being a coward.
Respectfully yours,
Masao M. Suma.

The Editor, Sir:
Bill Whoopie, Jr., certainly seems
to be in "the know" about all the in
side machinations of the Executive
Comittee and the Men's Council. In
fact, one might well infer that he is
either a member of one of those
bodies and is attempting to justify his
stand, or he has been prompted by
members thereof to plead their cause.

According to the A.S.S.U. constitu
tion, the Executive Committee —and
not the Men's Council —is to appoint
all vacancies except those of presi
dent and yell-leader. Yet Bill Whoopie
is kind enough to inform us that we

cannot blame the Executive Commit
tee for selecting Holt, because this
body turned "over its function of fill
! ing a vacancy on the Men's Council,
to that body itself." Are we to under
stand, then, that the Men's Council is
a "closed corporation"?

What's more, according to Bill, the
Council named "the man it thought
most capable." Kindly notice that the
singular form is used! Of all the men
at Stanford, one —at least according
to Bill Whoopie's article —was picked
by the Council and unanimously
O.K.'d by the Executive Committee.

***The Editor, Sir

The Women's Clubhouse is donating
the use of two rooms for the month
of October as an accommodation to
the Quad Board in the taking of pic
tures. Last Wednesday morning the
two men who were serving as clerks
were asked by the management to
carry a small table up one flight of
stairs to replace the table they were
using, as it was needed elsewhere.
Thy refused point-blank to do this
little favor.
Evidently their code of politeness
suffers from the same "creaks" as the
honor system.
