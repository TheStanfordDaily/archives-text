# DR. T. M. WILLIAMS EXPLAINS B.A.C. STAND
## Former Chairman of Stanford Athletic Board Comments Upon Banet's Article in Illustrated Review 
### 
Dr. Thomas M. Williams, '97, who
has served as chairman of the Board
of Athletic Coutrol since its organiza
tion in 1917, has replied to a request
of the Daily that he make a statement
on the article in the current issue of
the Illustrated Review in which the
termination of his service on the
Board is discussed. Dr. Williams' dis
placement came about last month
when the Executive Committee of the
Alumni Association elected Phil Wil
son of Los Angeles to take his place.
Wilson, however, was afterwards
found to be ineligible for the office
because of his never having taken an
A.B. degree from the University.
Hence, there is some doubt as to
whether or not Dr. Williams is still a
member. The Review article, written
by Richard W. Barrett, '04, now chair
man of the 8.A.C., reviews Dr. Wil
liams' career as a follower of Stan
ford athletics.

My dear Mr. Editor: —
You sent your alert young re
porter to me last evening to in
quire concerning a certain article
written by my old friend, R. W.
Barrett, and appearing in the last
issue of the Illustrated Review.
I understand that this alumni
publication has not as yet been
distributed to the public, but that
an advance sheet, containing my
obituary, has been placed on the
bulletin board of the Quad and
that students, alumni, and faculty
some to read and go away to
weep. Can't you get me a moving
picture of this procession? I
should love to see it, but I fear
my presence might break up the
show. Imagine the sensation of
come to read and go away to
after reading the article, inspect
ing the picture, wiping a few
tears away, and suppressing a
sob, she should turn to go and
find me looking over her shoulder.
No, I can't come to the Quad to
day; maybe tomorrow, but not to
day.

Your reporter wanted a state
ment from me last night in order
to correct matters in your morn
ing issue, but I said: "No, this is
the first time my name has been
posted on the Quad bulletin board
since my graduation in ninety
seven. Just let me be the center
of attraction for one more day."
Now, really, this obituary of
mine is slightly premature and is
sadly exaggerated as to facts con
cerning me. I suspect that my old
friend Dick Barrett is preparing
the way for me to give him a good
send-off: when his time comes,
since in composing this article
about me, he has deliberately
failed to mention several of the
most important accomplishments
of our Board of Athletic Control.
Dick and I are not going to give
Leland Cutler any credit whatso
ever, he doesn't deserve any
credit. Being an insurance man,
he believes in safety first—he
did not have to "retire," but beat
the Executive Committee of the
Alumni Association to it, and re
signed.
I want to explain that during
the past twelve years, known as
the Period of the Mound Builders,
there have always been nine men
on the Board of Athletic Control,
three faculty members, appointed
by President Wilbur, three stu
dents elected by the student body
and three alumni members elect
ed by the Executive Committee of
the Alumni Association. These
men deserve the credit which has
been assigned to me by my friend
Dick. The first year, the faculty
and alumni members were ap
pointed by President Wilbur.
Since that first year, the Execu

tive Committee of the Alumni As
sociation has had the privilege of
electing their own three alumni
members. Until two years ago,
when Mr. Cutler resigned, the fol
lowing men had served continu
ously on our Athletic Board, Prof.
J. P. Mitchell, representing the
Faculty, R. W. Barrett, Leland
Cutler, and myself, representing
the Alumni.
There were Mound Builders,
however, in the Santa Clara Val
ley before our day, back in the
prehistoric period. When I was a
student at Stanford there was a
mound some two miles below
Maylield which has since been
leveled away; I am now unable
to locate the spot. The Berkeley
professor who designated our
stadium as a "temporary struc
ture" may have been right—his
tory may repeat itself. This old
mound of which 1 speak was, as
I remember it, horse-shoe shaped,
with an open end facing Black
Mountain. It was not so big nor so
high as our present stadium, but
within its embankments were to
be found the remains of mighty
warriors. Judging from the num
ber of broken skulls and broken
limbs I have excavated from that
embankment, the Santa Clara Val
ley has seen exciting games back
in the days when the giant red
woods were saplings and when
the original Stanford man met his
traditional enemy, the monster
Grizzly, with open arms.
In the completion of our sta
dium, the dream of my younger
days has come true and we now
have an arena where we can re
enact the scenes of prehistoric
times and where we can stow
away the remains of our Berkeley
enemies for genex-ations to come.
After this has been accom
plished, it is easy to "retire" and
let someone else run the show. I
have always been a firm believer
in the policy of giving the wheel
to the youngsters after the moun
tains are passed and one is on the
straight, open road. Besides, one
can always drive from the back
seat and nowadays even by radio.
It has been the growing policy
of the Alumni Secretary (who is
frequently regarded as the
spokesman of the Alumni Execu
tive Committee) to bring about
frequent rotation in office of well
nigh all the appointees of his
Committee. You see, I did not "re
tire." It was just a little extra
centrifugal force which sent me
off at a tangent, as the old ma
chine began to turn the corner
and caught me unawares.
Very sincerely yours,
T. M. Williams.

No, I can't come to the Quad to

Your reporter wanted a state
ment from me last night in order
to correct matters in your morn
ing issue, but I said: "No, this is
the first time my name has been
posted on the Quad bulletin board
since my graduation in ninety
seven. Just let me be the center
of attraction for one more day."
Now, really, this obituary of
mine is slightly premature and is
sadly exaggerated as to facts con
cerning me. I suspect that my old
friend Dick Barrett is preparing
the way for me to give him a good
send-off: when his time comes,
since in composing this article
about me, he has deliberately
failed to mention several of the
most important accomplishments
of our Board of Athletic Control.
Dick and I are not going to give
Leland Cutler any credit whatso
ever, he doesn't deserve any
credit. Being an insurance man,
he believes in safety first—he
did not have to "retire," but beat
the Executive Committee of the
Alumni Association to it, and re
signed.
I want to explain that during
the past twelve years, known as
the Period of the Mound Builders,
there have always been nine men
on the Board of Athletic Control,
three faculty members, appointed
by President Wilbur, three stu
dents elected by the student body
and three alumni members elect
ed by the Executive Committee of
the Alumni Association. These
men deserve the credit which has
been assigned to me by my friend
Dick. The first year, the faculty
and alumni members were ap
pointed by President Wilbur.
Since that first year, the Execu

tive Committee of the Alumni As
sociation has had the privilege of
electing their own three alumni
members. Until two years ago,
when Mr. Cutler resigned, the fol
lowing men had served continu
ously on our Athletic Board, Prof.
J. P. Mitchell, representing the
Faculty, R. W. Barrett, Leland
Cutler, and myself, representing
the Alumni.
There were Mound Builders,
however, in the Santa Clara Val
ley before our day, back in the
prehistoric period. When I was a
student at Stanford there was a
mound some two miles below
Maylield which has since been
leveled away; I am now unable
to locate the spot. The Berkeley
professor who designated our
stadium as a "temporary struc
ture" may have been right—his
tory may repeat itself. This old
mound of which 1 speak was, as
I remember it, horse-shoe shaped,
with an open end facing Black
Mountain. It was not so big nor so
high as our present stadium, but
within its embankments were to
be found the remains of mighty
warriors. Judging from the num
ber of broken skulls and broken
limbs I have excavated from that
embankment, the Santa Clara Val
ley has seen exciting games back
in the days when the giant red
woods were saplings and when
the original Stanford man met his
traditional enemy, the monster
Grizzly, with open arms.
In the completion of our sta
dium, the dream of my younger
days has come true and we now
have an arena where we can re
enact the scenes of prehistoric
times and where we can stow
away the remains of our Berkeley
enemies for genex-ations to come.
After this has been accom
plished, it is easy to "retire" and
let someone else run the show. I
have always been a firm believer
in the policy of giving the wheel
to the youngsters after the moun
tains are passed and one is on the
straight, open road. Besides, one
can always drive from the back
seat and nowadays even by radio.
It has been the growing policy
of the Alumni Secretary (who is
frequently regarded as the
spokesman of the Alumni Execu
tive Committee) to bring about
frequent rotation in office of well
nigh all the appointees of his
Committee. You see, I did not "re
tire." It was just a little extra
centrifugal force which sent me
off at a tangent, as the old ma
chine began to turn the corner
and caught me unawares.
Very sincerely yours,
T. M. Williams.

tive Committee of the Alumni As
sociation has had the privilege of
electing their own three alumni
members. Until two years ago,
when Mr. Cutler resigned, the fol
lowing men had served continu
ously on our Athletic Board, Prof.
J. P. Mitchell, representing the
Faculty, R. W. Barrett, Leland
Cutler, and myself, representing
the Alumni.
There were Mound Builders,
however, in the Santa Clara Val
ley before our day, back in the
prehistoric period. When I was a
student at Stanford there was a
mound some two miles below
Maylield which has since been
leveled away; I am now unable
to locate the spot. The Berkeley
professor who designated our
stadium as a "temporary struc
ture" may have been right—his
tory may repeat itself. This old
mound of which 1 speak was, as
I remember it, horse-shoe shaped,
with an open end facing Black
Mountain. It was not so big nor so
high as our present stadium, but
within its embankments were to
be found the remains of mighty
warriors. Judging from the num
ber of broken skulls and broken
limbs I have excavated from that
embankment, the Santa Clara Val
ley has seen exciting games back
in the days when the giant red
woods were saplings and when
the original Stanford man met his
traditional enemy, the monster
Grizzly, with open arms.
In the completion of our sta
dium, the dream of my younger
days has come true and we now
have an arena where we can re
enact the scenes of prehistoric
times and where we can stow
away the remains of our Berkeley
enemies for genex-ations to come.
After this has been accom
plished, it is easy to "retire" and
let someone else run the show. I
have always been a firm believer
in the policy of giving the wheel
to the youngsters after the moun
tains are passed and one is on the
straight, open road. Besides, one
can always drive from the back
seat and nowadays even by radio.
It has been the growing policy
of the Alumni Secretary (who is
frequently regarded as the
spokesman of the Alumni Execu
tive Committee) to bring about
frequent rotation in office of well
nigh all the appointees of his
Committee. You see, I did not "re
tire." It was just a little extra
centrifugal force which sent me
off at a tangent, as the old ma
chine began to turn the corner
and caught me unawares.
Very sincerely yours,
T. M. Williams.
Dr. Thomas M. Williams, '97, who

of Athletic Coutrol since its organiza

of the Daily that he make a statement
on the article in the current issue of
the Illustrated Review in which the
termination of his service on the
Board is discussed. Dr. Williams' dis
placement came about last month
when the Executive Committee of the
Alumni Association elected Phil Wil
son of Los Angeles to take his place.
Wilson, however, was afterwards
found to be ineligible for the office
because of his never having taken an
A.B. degree from the University.
Hence, there is some doubt as to
whether or not Dr. Williams is still a

My dear Mr. Editor: —
You sent your alert young re
porter to me last evening to in
quire concerning a certain article
written by my old friend, R. W.
Barrett, and appearing in the last
issue of the Illustrated Review.
I understand that this alumni
publication has not as yet been
distributed to the public, but that
an advance sheet, containing my
obituary, has been placed on the
bulletin board of the Quad and
that students, alumni, and faculty
some to read and go away to
weep. Can't you get me a moving
picture of this procession? I
should love to see it, but I fear
my presence might break up the
show. Imagine the sensation of
come to read and go away to
after reading the article, inspect
ing the picture, wiping a few
tears away, and suppressing a
sob, she should turn to go and
find me looking over her shoulder.
No, I can't come to the Quad to
day; maybe tomorrow, but not to
day.

Your reporter wanted a state
ment from me last night in order
to correct matters in your morn
ing issue, but I said: "No, this is
the first time my name has been
posted on the Quad bulletin board
since my graduation in ninety
seven. Just let me be the center
of attraction for one more day."
Now, really, this obituary of
mine is slightly premature and is
sadly exaggerated as to facts con
cerning me. I suspect that my old
friend Dick Barrett is preparing
the way for me to give him a good
send-off: when his time comes,
since in composing this article
about me, he has deliberately
failed to mention several of the
most important accomplishments
of our Board of Athletic Control.
Dick and I are not going to give
Leland Cutler any credit whatso
ever, he doesn't deserve any
credit. Being an insurance man,
he believes in safety first—he
did not have to "retire," but beat
the Executive Committee of the
Alumni Association to it, and re
signed.
I want to explain that during
the past twelve years, known as
the Period of the Mound Builders,
there have always been nine men
on the Board of Athletic Control,
three faculty members, appointed
by President Wilbur, three stu
dents elected by the student body
and three alumni members elect
ed by the Executive Committee of
the Alumni Association. These
men deserve the credit which has
been assigned to me by my friend
Dick. The first year, the faculty
and alumni members were ap
pointed by President Wilbur.

tive Committee of the Alumni As

in the policy of giving the wheel
to the youngsters after the moun
tains are passed and one is on the
straight, open road. Besides, one
can always drive from the back
seat and nowadays even by radio.
It has been the growing policy
of the Alumni Secretary (who is
frequently regarded as the
spokesman of the Alumni Execu
tive Committee) to bring about
frequent rotation in office of well
nigh all the appointees of his
Committee. You see, I did not "re
tire." It was just a little extra
centrifugal force which sent me
off at a tangent, as the old ma
chine began to turn the corner
and caught me unawares.
Very sincerely yours,
T. M. Williams.
