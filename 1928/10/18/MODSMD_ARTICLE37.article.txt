# Sam Pepys' Little Niece
## 
### 
October 17th.—
Did find on the spindle for me at
Roble this noon a most edifying little
note from the Committee of Five,
which corresponds it seems roughly
to the disciplinary hand of the long
arm of the student law, and the note
did say that after consideration of
my lockout of October 9th, the Com
mittee had decided I should do some
typing for Roble Club, and to get in
touch with the proper authorities. And
it seems that I never should have
even started to go get food in Palo
Aito, after the dance, whether I had
time, or the young man had had time,
at all. For it seems that I had signed
out for the dance, and at the dance I
should have been, or at least within
a distance of fifty feet of it.
♦ * *

And so do find myself contemplat
ing getting a tutor to tutor me in
typing, for albeit I do not approve of
the touch system, do see myself suf
fering most heavily for my errors.
Out to lunch with a young beau to
day, and he did take me to the Happy
Gardens, a most felicitous Japanese
lea house where they do serve Ameri
can food as well as Oriental concoc
tions. And did order a dish called
Suki Yaki, for did find myself most
attracted by the name. Was surprised
and gratified to find that this same
dish was cooked before my eyes, on
a small electric stove, although do not
think that the waiter could read, for
he did play with the switch in a most
distracted fashion, and did warm his
hands over it as though he were un
able to tell whether it were warm or
cold. And was much amazed at the
confections of celery, onions, extra
ordinarily raw-looking beef, pasties of
an unpleasant-looking nature called
"tofu" —all of which after some sim
mering did result in a delicious dish,
which pleased me mightily. Also we
were served with chopsticks, served
in effective wrappers as though they
were masquerading as straws, which
aid also contain most charmingly
quaint toothpicks at the top, which I
do think a pleasant custom which
would bear reviving in American
homes, for albeit bobbed hair has
done away with hairpins, we are
sadly in need of a similar weapon
with which to pick locks, repairing
cars, opening ink bottles, and all the
numerous things a woman must do.
♦ * *

And so home, immensely happy at
finding a new eating-place with proper
atmosphere, but lord! do not think
this would serve as a habitual inn,
for do find the fingers of my right
hand extraordinarily cramped from
my manouevers with the chop sticks,
and do find that Suki Yaki also makes
one almost too bountifully replete.
Automobiles are taboo on campus
parking spaces during the day at Ore
gon State College.

Asia are registered at the University

of California.
October 17th.—
Did find on the spindle for me at
Roble this noon a most edifying little
note from the Committee of Five,
which corresponds it seems roughly
to the disciplinary hand of the long
arm of the student law, and the note
did say that after consideration of
my lockout of October 9th, the Com
mittee had decided I should do some
typing for Roble Club, and to get in
touch with the proper authorities. And
it seems that I never should have
even started to go get food in Palo
Aito, after the dance, whether I had
time, or the young man had had time,
at all. For it seems that I had signed
out for the dance, and at the dance I
should have been, or at least within
a distance of fifty feet of it.
♦ * *

And so do find myself contemplat
ing getting a tutor to tutor me in
typing, for albeit I do not approve of
the touch system, do see myself suf
fering most heavily for my errors.
Out to lunch with a young beau to
day, and he did take me to the Happy
Gardens, a most felicitous Japanese
lea house where they do serve Ameri
can food as well as Oriental concoc
tions. And did order a dish called
Suki Yaki, for did find myself most
attracted by the name. Was surprised
and gratified to find that this same
dish was cooked before my eyes, on
a small electric stove, although do not
think that the waiter could read, for
he did play with the switch in a most
distracted fashion, and did warm his
hands over it as though he were un
able to tell whether it were warm or
cold. And was much amazed at the
confections of celery, onions, extra
ordinarily raw-looking beef, pasties of
an unpleasant-looking nature called
"tofu" —all of which after some sim
mering did result in a delicious dish,
which pleased me mightily. Also we
were served with chopsticks, served
in effective wrappers as though they
were masquerading as straws, which
aid also contain most charmingly
quaint toothpicks at the top, which I
do think a pleasant custom which
would bear reviving in American
homes, for albeit bobbed hair has
done away with hairpins, we are
sadly in need of a similar weapon
with which to pick locks, repairing
cars, opening ink bottles, and all the
numerous things a woman must do.
♦ * *

And so home, immensely happy at
finding a new eating-place with proper
atmosphere, but lord! do not think
this would serve as a habitual inn,
for do find the fingers of my right
hand extraordinarily cramped from
my manouevers with the chop sticks,
and do find that Suki Yaki also makes
one almost too bountifully replete.
Automobiles are taboo on campus
parking spaces during the day at Ore
gon State College.
Two hundred fifty students from
Asia are registered at the University
of California.
