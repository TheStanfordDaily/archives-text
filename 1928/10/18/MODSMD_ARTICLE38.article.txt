# ACTIVITIES OF SOCIALIST CANDIDATE CITED
## Correspondent of Third Party Gives Reasons for Selection of Thomas; Believes Record Merits Election 
### STEWART WAY 
(Herewith is a contribution on poli
tics favoring Norman Thomas for the
presidency. This is the third of a
series of articles appearing in the
Daily written by campus students.)

Through the courtesy of the Stan
lord Daily we are offering our fellow
students an opportunity to know
something of the platform and posi
tion of Mr. Norman Thomas, the So
cialist candidate for President of the
United States.

Mr. Thomas graduated from Prince
ton University at the head of his
class. He was a good athlete, and was
never regarded as a grind. His first
contact with the labor movement was
in settlement work in New York City,
where he lived with and felt the prob
lems of all classes of people. He took
graduate study at Union Theological
Seminary.

From the start he has been a keen
student of social phenomena, always
seeking to separate the chaff from
the wheat of his learnings, during his
participation in the labor struggle.
Though exempted from military ser
vice during the war by virtue of his
assistant pastorship in the Brick
Presbyterian Church in New York,
Mr. Thomas registered as a conscien
tious objector, seeing in the war no
glorious struggle for the protection
o£ women and children, but only a
devilish massacre, which was the na
tural outgrowth of the competitive
economic system and nationalistic
patriotism.

Mr. Thomas soon left the Brick
Presbyterian Church, giving up a po
sition that promised easy living, to
join the Socialist Party. From then
on his lot was definitely cast with the
American Labor Movement. He has
been a champion of civil liberties, on
one occasion being arrested while
reading the Constitution of the United
States to test the legality of free as
sembly. (This was during the Passaic
strike in 192 G.)

Mr. Thomas is an internationally
known pacifist, director of the League
for Industrial Democracy, and a foun
der of the American Civil Liberties
Union. He was the first editor of the
World Tomorrow, is contributing edi
tor to several periodicals, and is the
author of "Is Conscience a Crime."

This short resume of the work of
Norman Thomas is not given to show
why he is well-qualified for the presi
dency, though he has well demon
strated his administrative and execu
tive ability on several occasions, but
rather to show why he is fitted to
lead us in the development of a po
ten third party, a party that is not
concerned with ephemeral issues, but
with building a new order of society.
Opposes Militarism
The Socialist Party and Norman
Thomas are unalterably opposed to
militarism and imperialism. There
fore, these demands are made:
1. All U.S. Marines must be imme
diately withdrawn from Nicaragua.
(Mr. Smith failed to commit

himself here. His silence gives us
a good idea of which side of the
fence he is on when interests of
big business and exploited peo
ples are at stake.)
2. Investment by private citizens i
abroad shall be made at the sole risk
of the investors. The Unfted States j
shall not resort to any military or I
ether coercive intervention with for-1
eign countries for the protection of
such loans and investments.
The doctrine of National Interests
is one of the fundamental causes of j
war. As long as we carry on small
wars, or as long as we justify small
wars in defense of our National Inter- j
ests, we shall be in danger of big !
wars. If the Outlawing of War trea- ;
ties are to be more than a "thieves' !
agreement" among the powerful na- i
tions we must put an end to our little j
imperialist wars in Latin America, |
China, and the South Seas.
3. Abandonment of our dangerous
program of aggressive militarism and
big navy building in competition with
other nations. The Socialist Party j
pledges itself to an aggressive agita- J
tion against this policy and in behalf
of international disarmament.

The good-will of nations for each
other and large armaments built up |
competitively exist, in so far as they I
do, at the expense of each other. Mr. 1
Hoover either does not see the in- i
compatibility of goodwill and pre- (
paredness, or he ignores it because ■
the Republican Party tells him to do
so. We must realize that the only
sound basis for national security lies
in just dealings. This is the belief |
of Norman Thomas. Mr. Hoover says, j
"We must not only be just, we must
be respected." In the middle ages men ;
were respected for their ability to
wield the sword.

Today we have only touched on i
part of Mr. Thomas' program for in- j
ternational relations. The policies here j
advocated could never be advanced ;
by either of the two major parties, i
because they would not be acceptable j
to the small group of financiers who !
control the industries of our country, j
Norman Thomas has not a chance
of winning. But if you favor the poli
cies advocated by the Socialist Party
and are sick of seeing corruption in
government and politics being played
as a game, you will not be throwing
your vote away to cast it for Norman
Thomas. Roosevelt once said, "The ;
only way you can beat the Socialists
is to beat them to it." We must build :
up a third party. The vote of a pro- !
gressive for Hoover or Smith looks j
just like the vote of a conservative
for them. Be sure you do not throw !
your vote away.
