# Arkansas Denies Citizen's Rights To Atheist Head
## Municipal Judge Withholds From Smith Right to Testify for Self 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 17. (/P)—
As a protest against anti-atheist laws
in Arkansas which he said denied
atheists full rights as citizens, Charles
Smith of New York, president of the
American Association for Advance
ment of Atheism, was in jail here to
night serving out a fine of $25 im
posed upon him as a result of his
activities against a proposed anti-evo
lution law to be voted on in the gen
eral election next month.

Fined on a charge of distributing
printed material "calculated to pro
voke a breach of the peace" Smith
first made an appeal bond but later
decided to submit to voluntary im
prisonment as a protest, he said,
against state laws which prohibit
atheists from testifying in courts or
holding public office.

At his trial in municipal court this
morning Smith was denied permis
sion to testify in his own behalf by
Municipal Judge Harper Harb because
he declined to take the customary

oath.
The fine with costs amounted to
$26.40 and Smith will serve it out at
ihe rate of $1 a day. He was techni
cally surrendered to Police Chief B. C.
Rotenberry by his bondsman through
his Attorney John D. Shackelford.

Smith was arrested at newly estab
lished atheist headquarters late yes
terday on a charge of violating a city
ordinance prohibiting use of the name
of the Deity except in "veneration and
worship." This charge was changed
at the hearing to breach of peace.
Judge Harb ordered police to hold
literature seized at Smith's headquar
ters pending disposal of his case. One
placard seized read "Evolution Is
True. The Bible Is a Lie. God's a
Ghost."
