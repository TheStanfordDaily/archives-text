# FORTY-THREE GIVEN ROLES BY DAVIS IN DRAMA PRODUCTION
## Campus Talent Included in Cast for Cushing's Play "Devil in the Cheese" 
### 
All but two of the forty-five parts
in Tom Cushing's fantastic comedy,
"The Devil in the Cheese," Sword and
Sandal's play to be presented in the
Assembly Hall November 9, were
filled last night by Gordon Davis, di
rector. He said that the cast as it
now stands is practically final, but
that later circumstances may necessi
tate some minor changes.

There are many students to whom
he would like to give roles in this
production, Davis said, but as most
of them are sophomores he is saving
them for that class play later in the
quarter. He asked that all the princi
pals, including the doubles, meet for
the first rehearsal tonight at 7 o'clock
in the Assembly Hall.
