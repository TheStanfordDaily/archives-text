Gentlemen:
Having been a user of Edgeworth
for over eight years, I can truthfully
say that it is the best on earth. I am
enclosing a little ditty that I believe
expresses my sentiments entirely:
Old Man Joy and Old Man Trouble
Went out for a walk one day.
I happened to pass when they met
on the street
And I overheard them say,
Said Old Man Trouble, "She's as
wrong as she can be,
There ain't no fun in anything to
mo, why
I was just talking' to Old Man
Sorrow,
And he says the world will end
tomorrow."
Then Old Man Joy he started to
grin,
And I saw him bring out that
OLD BLUE TIN,
Then OLD JOHNNY BRIAR was
next on the scene,
And he packed him full from the
OLD BLUE TIN,
And I heard him say as he walked
away,
"You have to have a smoke screen
every day.
When a man gets the blues, and he
needs a friend,
He can find consolation in the OLD
BLUE TIN,
And I jist don't believe on all this
earth
There's a thing that'll match good
old EDGEWORTH."
Yours very truly,
F. 11. McMurray
