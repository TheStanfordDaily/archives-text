# Famous Bacteriologist Will Give Lecture Series At Lane Hospital
## 
### AL DENNY 
Doctor F. d'Hcrclle, recently appoint
ed professor of bacteriology at the Yale
University School of Medicine, one of
the foremost authorities in his field, and
discoverer of the bacteriophage, will ar
rive in San Francisco tomorrow morn
ing to deliver the twenty-first course of
the Lane Medical Lectures. Dr. d'Her
elle will speak October 22, 23, 24, 25, and
26 at 8:15 o'clock at Hall.
These lectures, which were founded in
1896 by the late Dr. Cooper Lane,
form a free course on medical subjects
delivered by men who are distinguished
at home and abroad. They are intended
primarily for medical students and in
terested members of the profession.
Dr. d'Hcrclle will also visit the Stan
ford campus, giving a lecture in the
Assembly Hall Octol)er 30 at 7:30
o'clock to the general public on "My
Mission to India for the Study of
Cholera."
This will l>c the first course offered
since 1925, when Vittorio Putti, M. D.,

professor of Orthopedic Surgery at the
University of Bologna, came to lecture
on this particular type of surgery.
Professor E. W. Schultz, professor of
Bacteriology and Experimental Pathol
ogy worked with Dr. d'Herelle while on
a Guggenheim Fellowship, and it was he
who is responsible for having the eminent
bacteriologist come to Stanford to give
the Lane Lectures.
With Pasteur Institute
Although Dr. d'Herelle was born in
Montreal and still retains his Canadian
citizenship, at an early age he went to
Paris to receive his education; between
1908 and 1923 lie was connected with the
Pasteur Institute at Paris. At the end of
the World War, lie went to study at the
University of Leydcn, where he re
ceived the degree of "M. D. Honoris
Causa." The greatness of this honor is
understood when it is realized that he
is the only living person today who has
this degree. He was also granted the
Lceuwenhoek Medal by the Amsterdam
Academy for work which he accomp
lished there. Only a few men, of the
greatness of Pasteur, have ever held this
medal, which is granted every ten years.
Dr. d'Herelle's development of the sub
ject of bacteriology, and his discoveries
in 1916, were entirely new to the world.
Perhaps it is his work on this subject
which has brought him his greatest re
nown.
Bacteriophage Explained
"This bacteriophage is of a corpuscular
nature and is so small that it cannot be
seen by any of the instruments here,"
according to Professor Schultz. Because
it is parasitic on bacteria it was given
the name of bacteriophage. It is ex
tremely valuable because it does not de
crease, but may be used in a scries as it
multiplies at the expense of the bac
teria. It is thought that this helps re
covery from disease, and checks epi
demics.
Some of the positions which Dr.
d'Herelle has held are: bacteriologist of
the government of Guatemala, bacteriolo
gist of the government of Mexico in
Yucatan, when he first discovered the
bacteriophage phenomena, chief of labo
ratory service for the preparation of
vaccines used by the French armies in
the World War, and director of bacteri
ologic laboratory of quarantine service
in Alexandria, Egypt, where he made a
study of cholera and plague. During
his work in Alexandria he took a six
month's leave of absence to go to India,
where he made a further intensive study
of cholera.
Immediately after leaving here, he will
go to Los Angeles and other Pacific
Coast cities. From the Pacific Coast he
will travel to Minneapolis and then to
Rochester, where he will lecture at the
Mayo Institute, and finish a month's lec
ture tour in New York City on Novem
ber 24. At the end of his tour, he will
return to his work at Yale.
