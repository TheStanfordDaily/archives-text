# Mellon Econony Hit By Smith In Chicago Interview
## Secretary Dodges Issue Is Al's Belief; Ignores Government Cost 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 18 (/P) â€” Secretary
Mellon was a target today for the verbal
fire of Governor Smith, who accused the
Treasury Department head with ducking
the issue 011 the question of a reduction
in the operating costs of the Federal gov
ernment.
The Democratic nominee said that Mr.
Mellon in replying to his challenge to
Republican claims of economy in govern
ment had talked about tax reduction and
remained silent on the question of a
paring down of Federal expenditures.
"Mr. Mellon entirely ducks the issue,"
he declared. "He leaves that important
word out of his statement that he put
out over the radio and that was 'reduc
tion,' in the cost of government. That
was not brought about.
"There is a difference between his
speech, his radio speech, and this state
ment. He shifted his ground, because in
his radio speech he said that the Demo
crats would not give the Republicans
credit for reducing the expenditures of
the government. I said no, because they
were not reduced. But in this (Mr. Mel
lon's statement in reply) he just talks
about tax reduction."
The nominee's attack on the secretary
was made at a press conference in his
suite at the Congress Hotel, where he is
staying during his two and a half day
stopover in Chicago. The governor, who
appeared in the best of spirits, puffed
away 011 a cigar as he chatted with the
correspondents who were profuse with
questions.
