# FOUR CALIFORNIA GROUPS TO HEAR CARD DEBATERS
## 
### 
Four California audiences will hear
Stanford debaters express their opin
ions on the issues of the presidential
election on the night before the na
tional contest. Debates at Berkeley
with the University of California, at
Los Angeles with U.S.C., at Stockton
with the College of the Pacific, and
at San Francisco with St. Ignatius
College are practically assured, ac
cording to a statement issued by Pro
fessor J. G. Emerson, debate coach,
last night.
Due to the fact that Hoover's last
campaign speech has been scheduled
for the day preceding election and
that the exact time that it would be
broadcast was not known, the debates
were not definitely set for particular
dates. It is now believed that Hoover's
speech will be over in the later after
noon and will not conflict with the
debates on the eve of the election.
St. Ignatius is the last college to
indicate a desire to meet a Stanford
team. A two-man delegation will
represent Stanford in each contest.
Split debates will be the rule with a
Stanford Hooverite joining forces
with a man of similar conviction from
the other institutions to debate an
other Stanford man and his colleague
of Smith leanings.
At Stockton, however, two College
of the Pacific men will speak for
Norman Thomas, Socialist candidate,
while the two Cardinal debaters will
represent Smith and Hoover.
