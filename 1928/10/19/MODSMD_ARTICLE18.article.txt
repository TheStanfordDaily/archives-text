# CAL-U.S.C. MEET IN FIRST MAJOR CLASH OF YEAR
## Southerners Handicapped in Tomorrow's Game by Many Injuries 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon Berkeley will see
one of the three major clashes to be play
ed there this season when California
meets Southern California in a game that
will have a lot to do with deciding the
Conference titlists.
With the exception of U.S.C. injuries,
both teams will line up on even terms.
Both are strong teams, both are unde
feated, and both have an eye on the
championship of the Coast Conference.
The Trojans are the greatest sufferers
from injuries received in last week's con
tests. Saunders, Thomas, McCaslin and
Bonham were injured in the St. Mary's
game which the Trojans won, 19-6. Cap
tain Jesse Hibbs, All-American tackle
last year, was out of the Saint game
with an injured back and ankle, but he
is expected to play against the Bears as
is his team-mate, Boren, who was also
injured in the Oregon State game.
In spite of a 13-3 victory the Bears
had a tough time last Saturday against
the Wash. State Cougars but finished the
fray with less serious marks of battles
than the Trojans.
