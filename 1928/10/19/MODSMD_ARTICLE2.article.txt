LONDON, Oct. 18 (/P) —Flares burned
tonight at Croydon airdrome with the
slim hope that Lieutenant Commander H.
C. Mac Donald, who started at noon yes
terday on a transatlantic flight venture
from Harbor Grace, N.F., might in some
fashion have escaped the mysterious fate
of other such flyers and completed his
trip.
The chances were small, however, that
the flares would be needed. At 9:35 p.m.
(4 :34 Eastern Standard Time) there had
been no word here of the young aviator
since his sighting by the Dutch steam
ship Ilardenberg, 700 miles east and
north of Harbor Grace, shortly after
midnight last night. At this hour, Mac-
Donald was almost 29 hours out of Har
bor Grace; it should have taken him not
more than 20 hours to reach Ireland had
his flight been successful, or about 24
hours to reach Croydon.
Croydon officials tonight, though they
had not lost hope, were decidedly pessi
mistic as to the aviator's fate. Among
the possibilities mentioned is one that he
may have been blown far out of his
course and forced to alight on some re-
There is a chance, too, that in a pos
