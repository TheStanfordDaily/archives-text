# CARDS SET FOR REPULSE OF VANDAL TIDE AT KEZAR TODAY
## Northerners Base Strength On Heavy Team; Line Averages Over 200 Pounds 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
The' Vandals have come from the
Northland to re-enact an event of Euro
pean history. Their intended prey is a
victorious Conference aggregation, but
that is only one way in which this in
vasion differs from that of history.
These Vandals are going to be repelled
before they can do any destruction.
This modern historical pageant will
start at 3:00 o'clock this afternoon at
Kezar Stadium. The event is marked as
the re-christening of the new bowl, and
as the first,time in many years that the
Cardinals have performed in San Fran
cisco.
Vandals Boast Weight
Charlie Erb, Idaho coach and quarter
back of California's famous "Wonder
Team," is bringing with him the heaviest
team in the West. Fans arc interested in
this feature of the team from Moscow,
Idaho, because they put their unusual
weight to advantage, according to Stan
ford scouts. When accompanied with
football brains this kind of a team is
difficult to penetrate, and that is just
what Stanford will have to do. The
Vandals usually play the Andy Smith
style of game—kicking and waiting for
the valuable "breaks." It will be inter
esting to see just how effective this style
will be against the Warner offense.
The boys from the potato state will
enter the game with full strength, while
Stanford will start the game without its
injured reliables, Frank Wilton and
Spud Harder. With the exception of
Davidson, Muller and Frentrup, Stan
ford will start with its regular lineup.
Both teams had a comparatively easy
time of it last Saturday, Idaho handily
defeating Whitman, and the Cards
trouncing U.C.L.A.
