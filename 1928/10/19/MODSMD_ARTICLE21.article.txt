# CARDS SET FOR REPULSE OF VANDAL TIDE AT KEZAR TODAY
## Northerners Base Strength On Heavy Team; Line Averages Over 200 Pounds 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
The' Vandals have come from the
Northland to re-enact an event of Euro
pean history. Their intended prey is a
victorious Conference aggregation, but
that is only one way in which this in
vasion differs from that of history.
These Vandals are going to be repelled
before they can do any destruction.
This modern historical pageant will
start at 3:00 o'clock this afternoon at
Kezar Stadium. The event is marked as
the re-christening of the new bowl, and
as the first,time in many years that the
Cardinals have performed in San Fran
cisco.
Vandals Boast Weight
Charlie Erb, Idaho coach and quarter
back of California's famous "Wonder
Team," is bringing with him the heaviest
team in the West. Fans arc interested in
this feature of the team from Moscow,
Idaho, because they put their unusual
weight to advantage, according to Stan
ford scouts. When accompanied with
football brains this kind of a team is
difficult to penetrate, and that is just
what Stanford will have to do. The
Vandals usually play the Andy Smith
style of game—kicking and waiting for
the valuable "breaks." It will be inter
esting to see just how effective this style
will be against the Warner offense.
The boys from the potato state will
enter the game with full strength, while
Stanford will start the game without its
injured reliables, Frank Wilton and
Spud Harder. With the exception of
Davidson, Muller and Frentrup, Stan
ford will start with its regular lineup.
Both teams had a comparatively easy
time of it last Saturday, Idaho handily
defeating Whitman, and the Cards
trouncing U.C.L.A.
Vandals Claim 1927 Title
In this, Idaho's first Conference game
of the season, Californians will judge
I just how much reason the Vandals had
for claiming the undisputed champion
ship last year. The northerners tied
Stanford and Southern California for
first place, and though they did not meet
either the Cards or Trojans, claimed the
Conference title on the asserted ground
of having a better record.
The Vandals haven't such an impres
sive record to date. They lost their first
game to Montana State, tied Gonzaga,
and then came back last week to beat
Whitman 26-13. Reports from the north
indicate that this record is not to be
taken too seriously; that Idaho is weekly
developing at a pace that rivals Stan
ford's improvement.
Kershisnik is Praised
Stanford presents a heavy team, but
one which will be outweighed both on the
line and in the backfield. The Vandal
line averages 200 pounds, outweighing the
Cards seven pounds to the man. That
the visitors' weight is not confined to their
line is evidenced by the weights of their
star backs. Kershisnik, reputed to lie a
"second Ernie Nevers," weighs 215
pounds and is only a sample Vandal ball
carrier. Another big man who will
probably cut a prominent figure on the
field is their end and captain, Darwin
Burgher. He drops back from the line
to punt and pass for his team and en
joys the reputation of being Idaho's best
triple threat man.

line and in the backfield. The Vandal
line averages 200 pounds, outweighing the
Cards seven pounds to the man. That
the visitors' weight is not confined to their
line is evidenced by the weights of their
star backs. Kershisnik, reputed to lie a
"second Ernie Nevers," weighs 215
pounds and is only a sample Vandal ball
carrier. Another big man who will
probably cut a prominent figure on the
field is their end and captain, Darwin
Burgher. He drops back from the line
to punt and pass for his team and en
joys the reputation of being Idaho's best
triple threat man.

There Is a women's orchestra for
the first time in history at the Uni
versity of Minnesota.
The' Vandals have come from the
Northland to re-enact an event of Euro
pean history. Their intended prey is a
victorious Conference aggregation, but
that is only one way in which this in
vasion differs from that of history.
These Vandals are going to be repelled
before they can do any destruction.
This modern historical pageant will
start at 3:00 o'clock this afternoon at
Kezar Stadium. The event is marked as
the re-christening of the new bowl, and
as the first,time in many years that the
Cardinals have performed in San Fran
cisco.
Vandals Boast Weight
Charlie Erb, Idaho coach and quarter
back of California's famous "Wonder
Team," is bringing with him the heaviest
team in the West. Fans arc interested in
this feature of the team from Moscow,
Idaho, because they put their unusual
weight to advantage, according to Stan
ford scouts. When accompanied with
football brains this kind of a team is
difficult to penetrate, and that is just
what Stanford will have to do. The
Vandals usually play the Andy Smith
style of game—kicking and waiting for
the valuable "breaks." It will be inter
esting to see just how effective this style
will be against the Warner offense.
The boys from the potato state will
enter the game with full strength, while
Stanford will start the game without its
injured reliables, Frank Wilton and
Spud Harder. With the exception of
Davidson, Muller and Frentrup, Stan
ford will start with its regular lineup.
Both teams had a comparatively easy
time of it last Saturday, Idaho handily
defeating Whitman, and the Cards
trouncing U.C.L.A.
Vandals Claim 1927 Title
In this, Idaho's first Conference game
of the season, Californians will judge
I just how much reason the Vandals had
for claiming the undisputed champion
ship last year. The northerners tied
Stanford and Southern California for
first place, and though they did not meet
either the Cards or Trojans, claimed the
Conference title on the asserted ground
of having a better record.
The Vandals haven't such an impres
sive record to date. They lost their first
game to Montana State, tied Gonzaga,
and then came back last week to beat
Whitman 26-13. Reports from the north
indicate that this record is not to be
taken too seriously; that Idaho is weekly
developing at a pace that rivals Stan
ford's improvement.
Kershisnik is Praised
