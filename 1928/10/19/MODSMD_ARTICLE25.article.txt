# Battle of Words
## 
### 
That Campus Opinion should suddenly ring with the battle cries of
two foreign nations is assuredly unusual. On Tuesday a week ago, the
Honorable Yusuke Tsurmi. spoke in the Little Theater on "Japanese
Liberalism in Action." A learned man and a leader in his own countn
is this gentleman. Being just that, lie presented the Japanese viewpoint,
whatever that may be, very aptly.
Friday there came three-quarters of a galley of Campus Opinion filled
with facts, figures, and no lack of rhetoric, all penned by a Chinese
student. A certain Japanese, reading these facts, figures and rhetoric, did
indite post haste a galley and a half of retort. This veritable diatribe quite
doubled the length and prolixity of its predecessor.
The world's longest Campus Opinion has been written. Ihe first
nationalistic controversy has been fought in the columns of the Daily.
Not being Chinese, nor yet Japanese, the majority of students have not
become greatly perturbed by this battle of words, but being non-partisan
onlookers, they may have regarded it with interest.
The Chinese student to disprove the Japanese liberalism, outlined by
Mr. Tsurmi cited the "Tsinan Incident," which according to him was an
example of Japanese oppression. The Japanese student in reply cited the
"Nanking Outrage." Both gentlemen paint their examples of injustice in
brilliant colors. Both gentlemen believe their cause right.
Until the nationals of all countries can in mutual accord admit the
faults of their own countries and admire good qualities of each other,
world peace is a far distant dream. Great men dedicate their lives to the
achievement of international amity. Calmly the flow of life continues,
until suddenly without reason, or with little reason, strife flares up and
life flings itself at itself to mutual destruction.
