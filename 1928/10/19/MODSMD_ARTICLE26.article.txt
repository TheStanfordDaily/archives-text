# At California, They Don't Smoke Like Ladies
## 
### 
Our contemporary, the Daily Californian, has become disgusted with
the unladylike manner in which women have invaded the Memorial room
on the campus and abused the quiet and dignity which was once a part
of that resting place. The California's interesting description of the
mad conditions in the Memorial room follows:
The restriction upon smoking in the Memorial room was removed
last semester in order that students who wished to enjoy the restful
atmosphere of the room might smoke while doing so. The result
has been that women, instead of going to the room for quiet rest,
have formed the habit of going there to smoke.
Now there is little objection to the women smoking in the room;
the objection is to the manners they bring with them when they
bring their cigarettes.
Time was when conversation in the Memorial room was carried
on in subdued whispers; now it is carried on in loud voices amid
much laughter. 1 f someone wishes to play the piano, he cannot use
the soft pedal as lie did a year ago; he must play loudly in order to
hear himself. Needless to say, the atmosphere of the room is no
longer restful.
Upon entering the door one is greeted by a sight which resem
bles the movie conception of a Turkish harem. 1 hrough the haze of
smoke one sees women sprawled upon the davenports and chairs
telling what "I Ic said" and what "1 said" and breaking their conver
sation occasionally with shrills of laughter.
If such conduct invariably accompanies the woman Unoker, the
old "No Smoking" sign must be rehung below the picture depicting
Henry Morse Stephens holding a cigar between his fingers. One
hopes, however, that the women will perceive the error of their ways
before they force imposition of the old rule again.
