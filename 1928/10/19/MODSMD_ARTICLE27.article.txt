THIS IS THE OXONIAN LIFE
Lazy roughs might cast longing glances
J at distant Oxford and sigh with regret i
I that destiny pushed them into Stanford !
and not into that venerable stronghold of
British learning. At Stanford one must
give an account of himself in at least
fifteen hours of lecture a week. Here one
attends thirty weeks during the academic
year. Here one belabors his brain thrice
a year with final examinations, not to
mention mid-quarters. Here one engages
in sports as time or ability permits,
mostly the latter. Here one participates
in any of a dozen extra-curricular activi
ties. Verily the lazy rough cannot re
main lazy long.
But, Oxford! One's "scout," a serv
ant having a life-long connection with
the college, wakes him each morning.
Four times a week, one attends chapel or
"rollers" (roll call). There follows a
leisurely breakfast. Then to Bodleian, or
any of the college libraries, where one
spends the morning in study. Lunchedn
at one. From two-thirty to four-thirty
one must be engaged in some sport; it's
quite a social error not to be so en
gaged. Tea at four-thirty and the day's
schedule is complete. The academic year
has three terms. Curious to
say most of one's work is done away
from Oxford.
Bernard DeVoto, in the current issue of

Harper's, vents his spleen against the
American university system and then
proceeds to tell an aspiring youtli who is
about to enter university, how to gain
the intellectual life though handicapped
by college. It is interesting to note that
aside from Mr. DeVoto's demand lor
scientific knowledge, he prescribes Ox
onian methods as the "Tools for the In
tellectual Life." "Abandon the fetish of
the degree," he declares. Master one, two,
perhaps three continental tongues. Grasp
three likely sciences: for example, phys
ics, biology, chemistry. And then read
like hell.
"The true student is the man whose
eyes are red with strain." Most red
blooded roughs would' dub such a man
dryball. And justly perhaps. A man
confined to books alone endangers his
personality. The American system en
deavors to create the well-rounded man,
one who has met reality through actual
contact, not through the printed page
alone.
But then while pedagogs have wrangled
over systems, while universities have risen
to fame in all possible kinds of system,
while classicist has fought empiricist,
men have gone to college, seized what it
offered, turned it to their own use, and
become giants in all fields of endeavor,
thus proving that ancient, and well-worn
adage, you can't keep a good man down.
â€”Calvin D. Wood.
