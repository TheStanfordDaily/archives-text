The Front Page. Ben Hecht and 1
i
Charles Mac Arthur. Covici-Friede, 1
publishers.
Two hours of the most intense excite- ;
j m'ent in the most exciting place in the j
| world—the press room of the Criminal
j Courts Building in Chicago— arc found
| in this play which is now one of New
1 York's greatest successes. And, suffice it
j to say, that one's attention is simply '
I riveted to the pages in reading until the
very end, and a elever end it is, quite <
in keeping with the cleverness all the
way though.
Ben Hecht and Mac Arthur owe their
literary origins, to the newspapers of ,
Chicago. Famous crime reporters, their
j talents were first cradled in the recount
ing of great exploits in arson, rape, mur- j
der, gang war and municipal politics. Out
! of this welter of human experience they
jhave constructed a play dedicated to
| "Madison and Clark Streets"—and that
play is thrilling, nerve-wracking, rough ■
in spots, but essentially true to the life {
of newspaper reporters. It is written in
a direct frankness particularly suitable to
I the life it portrays.
In sending their little contribution to
i literature, and incidentally, to Jed liar-
J :
ris, the producer, the authors wrote the
! following whimsical note. "We recom
mend this play as a great work pf art, j
something like Hamlet.". And many a
true word is spoken in jest for Iliidy, the
big blond newspaperman, the relic of a j
golden age of journalists, is to his own
world a struggling Hamlet confronted
with his own baffling problems.
Hildy, having met the girl of his dreams j
who wants to make a new man of hits
has decided to desert his pals—and goes j
to bid them farewell in their hoi}' sanc
tuary, the press-room where a "poker j

game has been going on for over a genera
tion, presumably with the same deck of
cards."
In the midst of his strongest resolu
tions to give up the game, the greatest
break of. his career comes up—his paper
has no one to cover it. Love in this
emergency doesn't prove equal to his loy
alty to the paper and the "news," and he
throws himself into the rush for the story.
There's nothing very delicate about
"The Front Page." It is almost Eliza
bethan in its frankness. Robust, almost
elemental it is—gargantuan as some
critic has aptly put it. There is however
a certain naivete and fresh charm of out
look from the reporters.
McCue of the City News phones a
certain Mrs. F. 1). Margolies.
"Is it true, Madame, that you were
the victim of a Peeping Tom? — Now,
that ain't the riyht attitude to take,
Madame, all we want is the facts . . . .
Well, what did this Peeping Tom look
like? 1 mean, for instance, did he look
anything like a college professor? . . . . "
A significant picture of the great
American journalist is given by Hildy
in an impassioned speech when his pals
accuse him of desertion.
"Listen to who's talking. Journalists!
Peeking through keyholes ! Running after
fire engines like a lot of coach dogs!
Waking people up in the middle of the
night to ask them what they think of
Mussolini. Stealing pictures off old ladies
of their daughters who get raped in Oak
Park. A lot of lousy, daffy, buttinskis,
swelling around with holes in their pants,
borrowing nickels from office boys! And
for what? So a million hired girls and
motormen's wives'll know what's going
on."
