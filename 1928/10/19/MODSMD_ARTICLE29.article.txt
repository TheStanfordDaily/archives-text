The Editor, Sir : *
May a humble member of this great
rooting section of ours express his ap
proval of the editorial in Thursday's
Daily called "Organized Rudeness?"
Also, Stewart Way's article on Norman
Thomas was the best of the political
series so far. Though believing that a
progressive vote in this campaign should
be placed where it will do the most good,
I was pleased with Mr. Way's ingenious
explanation of why Thomas should have
it. One thing rankled, however. It was
the following statement:
"Mr. Smith failed to commit himself
here (the withdrawal of Marines from
i Nicaragua). His silence gives us a good
idea of which side of the fence he is
on when interests of big business and
exploited people are at stake."
This hardly needs to be refuted in
view of Smith's championship of the poor
in his own state.
While on political subjects, wasn't that
just the nicest statement Mr. Wenig made
regarding the Republican candidate?
"We believe in Herbert Hoover ....
as a liberal in the fullest sense of the
word."
Did the president of the Hoover Club
hear the acceptance speech?
The Daily is a good college news
paper. It is getting even better—aside
from that light type the Daily insists on
using.
I haven't read Mr. Masao's Campus
Opinion of Thursday morning, since I
liaven't had more than an hour or two
to my disposal.

The Editor, Sir:
The editorial "Organized Rudeness" in j

■
Thursday's issue is ou the whole a very
well justified criticism. The "Varsity,"
however, is a kick in nobody's face.
The after-game ceremony should con
sist of nothing more than the Hymn, the
moment of silence, the "Varsity." It
should contain all of that, though. After
all, we are not merely exchanging cour
tesies with our friendly rivals —we are
expressing ourselves as Stanford men
and women. It is not during the hymn
tlmt my throat chokes; it is during the
quietness before the "Varsity."
Is not the "Varsity," dignified, strong,
spoken, rather than yelled, a fitting punc
tuation to the Hymn- " . . . . Hail, Stan
ford, hail" .... "Rah—rah —rah—Stan-
ford—rah—rah—rah—Stanford — rah —
rah—rah—Stanford."
Perhaps 1?. m the only one who thinks
so.

The Editor, Sir:
W. N.'s editorial on "Organized Rude
ness" was well in point, and I trust that
all of us concerned will profit by it. But
two very obvious and relatively unim
portant misstatements stimulate me to
consider again a question which has both
ered me for a long time.
The band did strike up "in all its
pristine magnilicancc" at a very un
fortunate time at the end of the U.C.L.A.
game, but a cornet did not give the
wrong key for the hymn: the whole
band played a chord on the opening key
that the Rally Committee has approved
for years.
Now, the question is, have I an in
feriority complex left over from high
school band days, or arc my feelings
j correct that the organs of publicity on

i our Campus are inclined to look upon
our band as if it were a group of pro
fessional outsiders, to be enjoyed when
possible, and seldom encouraged; where
as in reality we are Stanford students
spending a good deal of time and eii'ort
to help make more nearly complete the
show that the team is putting on each
week ?
] hope my feelings on the subject are
I wrong.

The Editor, Sir:
' I have been greatly surprised that the
letter by a Mr. Sexson to your column
I has not caused any comment, for it is
a master-piece worthy of a place on that
page of the "American Mercury" en-
I titled "Americana."
If I understand the letter rightly, the
writer was calling to our attention the
fact that if Herbert Hoover were elected
;it would be a good advertisement for
California. Ah, at last we have a reason
1 for voting for him besides the fact that
; Coolidgc used less paper clipps in 1925
j than Wilson did in 1916. There are
I plenty of men who can command the
army and navy, propose legislation, carry
on foreign affairs and do the other chores
of the President of the United States;
but it takes a real "go getter" in the
White House to properly advertise our
peerless climate and scenic beauty.
I come from Southern California,
however, and so am anxious to obtain
more direct advertising for that section
of the state. 1 want a man in the White
House who will spend his time boosting
oranges and movies; not prunes and
China town.
Who is the best man for this? I pro
pose Charlie Chaplin. He has long been
a resident of the city of angels, and his
profession of a movie actor has un
doubtedly made him well acquainted
; with the publicity business.
I Now, Mr. Sexson, if you question my
, ability to choose a presidential candi
date, may I remind you that 1 like your
self am a student at one of the great
universities of the country? Since 1
have taken the course in Citizenship I
have been trained to look at political
I questions in a scientific light. 1 am thcre-
I fore free of all Babbittry and provincial
ism. *
So 1 come out boldly and shout —
i "Charlie for president."
i —Walston S. Brown.
