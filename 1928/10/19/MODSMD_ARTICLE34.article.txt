# GOOF OUTFIT IS STRONGEST SEEN FOR MANY YEARS
## 
### 
"One of the strongest Goof teams J
seen on the Farm in years" is the !
opinion of many of the local football
critic s, when speaking of this year's ;
organization. Thfe Coot's have a large j
and efficient squad and will offer I
tough going to their opposition.
I'nder the coaching of Ernie Nevers !
and Ed Walker, the Goofs have de
veloped into a stout outfit, and a j
wealth of promising material lias j
l>een brought to light. They are a i
fairly light team and are disclosing '
startling ability in getting off fast '
and tricky plays.
Aerial Attack Strong
In preparation for coming contests, |
they have been working hard on the 1
practice field, with the usual drill of !
dummy tackling, blocking, and charg- 1
ing, generally followed by some stiff ;
scrimmage. Against the freshmen, the >
Goofs showed up well on line plays
and surprised by uncorking an ac
curate passing attack.
Albertson, at center, has been the
■outstanding linesman in practice. Con
sistent passing and fast charging
have marked his offensive playing,
and breaking up the opposition is a
characteristic of his defensive game.
Albertson is conceded an above aver
age chance to break into the varsity
next season.
Reynolds Stars on Line
Mike Reynolds is making a good bid
tor an end position. A fine interfer
ence runner and an exceptional pass
catcher, he should dent the ambitions
of many an opposing back. He is big
and rangy, but despite this fact he
gets down the field fast on punts.
In the backfleld, Nevers is particu-1
larly well-pleased with the work of j
Nellie Smith at full and Bill Laird at
half. These men are both adept at
passing and kicking, and have been 1
the outstanding ball-carriers on the 1
field. 1 1
