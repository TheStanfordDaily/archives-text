# SIGNPOSTS WILL MARK ROUTE TO KEZAR TODAY
## 
### 
A series of carefully-prepared sign
posts will mark the route toÂ» Kczar Sta- I
tiium, San Francisco, from Stanford Uni- [
versity, according to an announcement
made to the Stanford Daily by Morville j
Tucker, engineer of the Board of Ath
letic Control.
The California State Auto Association I
is in charge of erecting the signs and
will have them installed in time for the ;
expected heavy traffic to the Stanford- j
Idaho football game this afternoon. It
is expected that these directions will not;
only speed up traffic, but cause a larger j
turnout to the game, due to the greater j
simplicity in reaching the stadium.
