## Flame, Strawberry Red Are Most Popular Shades for Evening; Question of Right Lipstick is Important 
### LADY VEE 
| It looks very much as though the
smart world this winter were going
to have the appearance, during the
evening at lease, of a continued Stan
ford celebration. For red is by far the
I most popular shade being shown for
both afternoon and evening—next, of
course, to the lasting favorite, black,
j Best represented by the clear flame
| and strawberry shades for evening, it
1 1 is seen in all its off-shades for after
■ ; noon. The old Chanel red, more or
less, is back this season as Russian
• red or various other names. And there
11 is also Burgundy and wine and all
1 the berry reds and all the other edible
• 1 reds.
' j It is a fortunate color for any com
-1 plexion one happens to be. There's
| nobody who cannot wear some shade
of red. It is only a matter of finding
it. However, once having found it,
; only half one's work is done.
There is the question of lip stick.
1 Proper Tint Vital
' Although everybody can wear red,
nobody can wear any red with just
any lip stick. If one's color sense is a
little dull or one hasn't the time to
indulge it in the matter, one should
seek advice. The proper lipstick to use
with a given shade of red is a matter
, for expert counsel, and simply cannot
1 i be left to take care of itself. There
j are people in the world whose teeth
1 are set on edge by the combination
1 of mangeta lips, say, with a flame
! colored dress. And they are too plenti
j ful to be disregarded (assuming that
one's own color sense is not affected
by the crime).
The abundance of g-reys that are
; almost black and of greys that have
' a bluish Cast is a distinct feature of
1 the winter season. Sports and town
suits and ensembles are smartest
when seen in grey mixtures, accented
by black and white. The white blouse !
(tucked in this year!) and the white
I gardenia have an excuse for being,!
| now.
Dark Blue Wins Favor
Blue, in navy and midnight, is the i
bass note in the tri-colored combina
tion now being so much heard in the
sport and informal mode —blue, white,
and red. All factors were propitious
this year for the complete success of
the youthful nautical costume in this
patriotic color combination. The beret,
both in its fundamental and in its ,
modification, is extremely popular. |
The pleated skirt (all around) worn
with the reefer jacket and its modi
fications is chic in almost any color.
And the triangle scarf, so necessary
; to the proper finishing of the costume

lis still enjoying unlimited success in
all phases of the mode.
Like the choker necklace, it seems
to have made itself a permanent home
in our wardrobes. Its latest manifes
tation is the paillette scarf, an eve
ning triangle entirely or partly cov
ered with glittery, shiny paillettes—
a highly sophisticated accessory that
only the initiate can wear with suc
cess. We attend every evening func
tion witli trepidation, now, lest there
appear some young thing wearing a
' paillette scarf with, say, a black-lace
trimmed frock. Verily, the paillette
j scarf needeth watching.
