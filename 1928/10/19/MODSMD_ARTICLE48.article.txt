# TRIP IS PLANNED TO MIDDLE WEST FOR HUGE AIRSHIP
## Graf Zeppelin Repairs Being Rushed; Ship to Take Air Next Week 
### 
LAKEHURST, N.J., Oct. 18 (&) —
Repairs were being rushed on the dam
aged fin of the transatlantic dirigible
Graf Zeppelin today so that the great
ship may take the air early next week for
a two-day flight into the middle west.
Dr. Hugo Eckener, commander of the
dirigible, spent the day here and received
many letters from midwest cities request
ing that the ship fly above them.
Hans Von Schiller .navigator of the
Zeppelin, answered these letters, saying
that the itinerary of the trip had not been
definitely determined, but that the ship
would pass over as many cities as pos
sible, to enable the greatest possible num
ber of people to sec it.
It is fairly definite that the snip will
pass over Akron, Ohio, home of the
Goodyear-Zeppelin Company, American
representatives of the German Zeppelin
Works, and Detroit, where it is likely the
ship will tie up at the Ford airport
mooring mast. The flight may continue
as far west as Chicago.
There was a conference here today of
persons it was understood might be in
terested in Dr. Eckener's dream of a
$14,000,000 transatlantic airship service,
but Dr. Eckener himself did not attend
it, being represented by Hugh Allen of
the Goodyear-Zeppelin Company.
Tonight's program for the visiting air
men called for a dinner tendered by the
City of Philadelphia and tomorrow there
will be a trip to Washington.
After the midwest flight the ship will
be refuelled and start back for Germany,
probably the end of. next week, carrying
an as yet unannounced number of pas
sengers.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 (^P) —Offi-
cial Washington tomorrow will welcome
Dr. Hugo Eckener, commander of the
dirigible Graf Zeppelin which paid a
brief visit to Washington Monday near
the end of her transatlantic flight.
