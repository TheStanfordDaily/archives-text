# GAME TOMORROW OPENS SEASON OF CLASS FOOTBALL
## 
### 
Opening the annual interclass grid sea
son, the sophomores will meet the fresh
men tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock on
the freshman football field. The juniors
meet the seniors Monday at 4 o'clock in
the Stadium, instead of tomorrow as was
previously announced, according to
Charles W. Davis, director of interclass
sports.
Following two weeks of stiff practice
both teams are at the peak of condition
and are ready for a hard game. Because
the sophomores outweigh the 1932 men,
they rule slight favorites to win. They
have been coached in plays of the War
ner system and in addition have the bene
fit of the previous year's experience.
Gatzert to Star
Starring for the sophomore squad will
be A1 Gatzert, quarter, who is considered
the outstanding punter on the interclass
team. He is a triple threat man, and
especially skilled in open field running.
Ray Luce, left end, is the fighting de
fense man for the 1931 team. The great
part of the passing attack is centered
about him. After four days the sopho
more team was pitted against Menlo
High School, which was victorious, 19
to 0. The majority of Menlo scores were
made on breaks and the 1931 team
shows possibilities of a strong eleven.
Coach Shirley Trome of the babes
scrimmaged his team against the second
year men Wednesday and showed a light
but powerful squad. No member of the
1932 backfield starred but all appeared
equally strong. Coach Pascoe has a
stronger backfield, with Gatzert, Baker,
Leonard and Wisdom as ball carriers.
