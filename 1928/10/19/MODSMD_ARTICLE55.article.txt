# FISHERIES BUREAU DOES WORK WITH AID OF STANFORD
## 
### 
The United States Bureau of Fisheries
has since 1909 been working with the co
operation of Stanford University and its
natural history departments. A formal
arrangement has been in force for the
last two years whereby the Bureau of
Fisheries maintains its offices in the Stan
ford Natural History Museum.
The real co-operation antedates this
formal arrangement. The work on the
west coast was really begun in 1909 by
the late Professor Charles H. Gilbert of
the Zoology department. Dr. Willis Rich,
now in charge of the Pacific Coast oper
ations of the Bureau of Fisheries, was a
student under Professor Gilbert at the
time the work was started. The other
participants in the summer operations of
the Bureau of Fisheries are also regis
tered as graduate students at Stanford.
"The outstanding work on the Pacific
Coast is salmon research, of which the
primary object is to determine the best
means for conserving the salmon re
sources of Alaska," stated Dr. Rich.
Extensive summer work was carried
on in this line. Dr. Rich took charge
of the operations which included the ter
ritory of Bristol Bay, Cook Inlet, and
Prince William Sound. Alan C. Taft
and Seymour Smith were working on
the Karluk River, Kodiak Island; and
Harlan B. Holmes was working at Chig
nik. Richard Cutter spent the summer
on the Columbia River working with fish
that had been marked when small so that
their life histories could be traced.
H. E. McMillan is studying the clams
and oysters of the west coast. He is co
operating mainly with Dr. Frank W.
Weymouth of the Physiology department.
