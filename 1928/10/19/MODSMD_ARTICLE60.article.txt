Here are five star ball-carriers, one
from the East, one from the West,
one from the South, one from the
Southwest, and one from the Middle
west. You will hear plenty about these
husky boys before the football season
is over, and maybe two or three of
them will receive All-American hon
ors.
"Biff" Hoffman, who is not trying
to catch that football in his mouth,
came into his own last year in Stan
ford's games against California and
Pittsburgh. Pop Warner used "Biff"
plenty in those contests, and the big
fullback looked like a second Ernie
Novers in the way he handled the

ball. Biff punts and kicks goals,
passes, and carries the ball, and,
while he may not be a second Nevers
in backing up the line, he is no slouch
in that department. His clever mani
pulation of the "Statue of Liberty"
and "Bootleggers" plays in the Stan
ford-California game was a sight I
will long remember. "Biff" is a star
shot-putter and discus-thrower, hav
ing been on several Stanford track
teams that took part in the 1.C.4-A.
and National Collegiate meets.
"Stumpy" Thomason broke into
print last year as a Sophomore and
was instrumental in helping Alexan
der's "Yellow Jackets" of Georgia
Tech to defeat both Alabama and

Georgia, and win the Southern Con
ference championship. He has short
arms and legs, but is fast and elusive,
with a disturbing change of pace and
a mean straight-arm. During the past
summer "Stumpy" has been a life
guard at a swimming pool in Atlanta.
He is an excellent defensive player.
Coach "Doc" Spears of Minnesota
has moved a giant Norseman from
the line to take Herb Joesting's place
at fullback. He is "Broncho" Nagurski,
205 pounds of beef and iron, and a
fast man on his feet and fast with
his brains. He is doped to compete
with the Indian, McLain, of lowa, for
the honor of being the best fullback
in the Big Ten.

A1 Marsters, the Sophomore flash
who gained more than a mile of grid
iron for Dartmouth last season, is
looked upon as one of the best baek
field men in the East. His mark of
1934 yards gained last season in eight
games was about 700 yards more than
Red Grange carried the ball in his
best nine-game season. His 52-yard
run down the sidelines in the Yale
Bowl will not soon be forgotten by
those who saw it.
Jake Hanna, Centenary's halfback,
is another Junior, and should be heard
of often before December rolls around.
Gerald Mann, Southern Methodist's
star of 1927, has warned me to watch
this bird, and I wish I could!

west. You will hear plenty about these
husky boys before the football season
is over, and maybe two or three of
them will receive All-American hon
ors.
"Biff" Hoffman, who is not trying
to catch that football in his mouth,
came into his own last year in Stan
ford's games against California and
Pittsburgh. Pop Warner used "Biff"
plenty in those contests, and the big
fullback looked like a second Ernie
Novers in the way he handled the

ball. Biff punts and kicks goals,
passes, and carries the ball, and,
while he may not be a second Nevers
in backing up the line, he is no slouch
in that department. His clever mani
pulation of the "Statue of Liberty"
and "Bootleggers" plays in the Stan
ford-California game was a sight I
will long remember. "Biff" is a star
shot-putter and discus-thrower, hav
ing been on several Stanford track
teams that took part in the 1.C.4-A.
and National Collegiate meets.
"Stumpy" Thomason broke into
print last year as a Sophomore and
was instrumental in helping Alexan
der's "Yellow Jackets" of Georgia
Tech to defeat both Alabama and

Georgia, and win the Southern Con
ference championship. He has short
arms and legs, but is fast and elusive,
with a disturbing change of pace and
a mean straight-arm. During the past
summer "Stumpy" has been a life
guard at a swimming pool in Atlanta.
He is an excellent defensive player.
Coach "Doc" Spears of Minnesota
has moved a giant Norseman from
the line to take Herb Joesting's place
at fullback. He is "Broncho" Nagurski,
205 pounds of beef and iron, and a
fast man on his feet and fast with
his brains. He is doped to compete
with the Indian, McLain, of lowa, for
the honor of being the best fullback
in the Big Ten.

A1 Marsters, the Sophomore flash
who gained more than a mile of grid
iron for Dartmouth last season, is
looked upon as one of the best baek
field men in the East. His mark of
1934 yards gained last season in eight
games was about 700 yards more than
Red Grange carried the ball in his
best nine-game season. His 52-yard
run down the sidelines in the Yale
Bowl will not soon be forgotten by
those who saw it.
Jake Hanna, Centenary's halfback,
is another Junior, and should be heard
of often before December rolls around.
Gerald Mann, Southern Methodist's
star of 1927, has warned me to watch
this bird, and I wish I could!

Here are five star ball-carriers, one
from the East, one from the West,
one from the South, one from the
Southwest, and one from the Middle
west. You will hear plenty about these
husky boys before the football season
is over, and maybe two or three of
them will receive All-American hon
ors.
