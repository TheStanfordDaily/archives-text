# SMITH CLUB LAYS PLAN FOR DINNER TUESDAY EVENING
## 
### 
A turkey dinner, a five-piece orches
tra, and several prominent speakers,
including some distinguished erst
while Republicans, were announced
for the Smith-for-President Club ban
quet next Tuesday at the Cardinal
Hotel at the meeting of this organiza
tion in the Old Union last night. The
speakers include Mrs. Charles L.
Donahue, Democratic National com
mitteewoman, and Colonel W. D. Pot
ter, '01, decorated by Congress for
conspicijous bravery in the World
War and formerly Adjutant General of
the Hawaiian Islands, a Republican.
Judge Ralston will be the other Re
publican speaker. Tickets are one
dollar.
John C. Dunniway, '25, was the prin
cipal speaker last night. He said that
there was no doubt about the great
personal ability of Mr. Hoover.
"Doubtless he would be an honor to
the office he seeks to fill, especially
in comparison with the last two
Presidents, but I couldn't vote Repub
lican today no matter who their can
didate was. Their failure to act when
the corruption of their party was ex
posed shows an attitude smug, cyni
cal, self-satisfied.
"In A1 Smith the Democratic Party
has a leader, a man willing and able
to stand on his own feet, unafraid of
what the future may hold. Smith is of

I that school of Jeffersonian Democrats
j who believe that public service is the
highest career open to a man. Smith
is a man of sterling honesty and un
flinching courage, the hope of liberals
i in this election."
