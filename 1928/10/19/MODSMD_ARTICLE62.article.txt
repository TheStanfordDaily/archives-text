## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 18. (/P)â€” John Col
lins, Waco, Texas, today demonstrated
before a meeting of the Independent
Telephone Association an "anso
phone" which, when installed in the
telephone, will receive messages
when the telephone user is absent and
later transmit them in the sender's
own voice to the person for whom
message was intended.
The returning housewife of the fu
ture, it was pointed out, on returning
home from marketing may expect to
find anything when she turns on the
telephone, from the latest neighbor
hood gossip to a message from the
husband that he won't be home for
dinner.
