SAN QUENTIN, Oct. 18 (/P) â€”Wil-
liam Edward Hickman, sentenced to die
on the gallows of San Qnentin prison for
the murder of Marian Parker of Los
Angeles, will go to the scaffold at 10
o'clock tomorrow morning.
Attorneys for his defense were unable
to secure a delay of the execution from
the governor or from the prison warden.
The last hope was lost yesterday when
Warden James B. Holohan told the at
torneys that "he could not agree with the
arguments" that Hickman was insane.
Fritz Kreisler, Austrian violin art
ist, is much in favor of U. S. sports
in schools of his native land, he says.
