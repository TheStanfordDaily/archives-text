# BABE WATER-POLO ASPIRANTS MAKE RECORD TURNOUT
## 
### 
"Water-polo this year lias drawn the
biggest turn-out of freshmen on record,"
declared Acting Coach Ted Smith in dis
missing the situation at Encina pool,
where considerable activity prevails from
4:30 to 6 o'clock every evening.
With all hut two members of last
year's intercollegiate championship water
polo team back, aquatic mentors and
dopesters cxpect great things. They arc
much encouraged by the enthusiasm
shown among the incoming class, as at
least four freshmen players have had ex
perience on noted teams.
Clapp, Booth Stars
Austin Clapp and Frank Booth, both
new men playing at forward, have done
considerable work with the I lollywood
Athletic Club squad. The other two sea
soned players who arc entering this year
are Ward Woods, of the Olympic Club,
and John Trotter, who got his polo
schooling in Honolulu.
Among the aspirants to the position of
guard are Sam Reid, Larry Harris, Jack
Pahl, and Slocum. All of these are new
material, but promising fair. There are
others who seem to have ability, includ
ing Wilkinson, Avery, Linton, Juda, and
McKelvey. McKelvey has been on the
sick list, but is expected to make a show
ing next week.
Veterans Return
Of the varsity guards, Cal Strong, last
year's captain, and Ogden Driggs are
back. Captain-elect Reggie Harrison and
Bob Burns are here this year, as well
as goal-keeper Norton Thornton.
"Whitey" Burns is expected to fill
Vanden Akker's place at forward, while
llanna, Kinkcad, and Parker will do bat
tle for the guard position which Maltby
vacated. Burns will be no weak link in
the forward chain, as lie has a good j
throwing arm, sufficient speed and un-J
usually good get-away.
