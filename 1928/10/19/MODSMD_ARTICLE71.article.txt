## 
### 
Sixteen hundred people heard two pro
! lessors of Princeton University, one sup
porting Hoover and the other Smith,
give vent to their political opinions re-
I cently in the university's assembly hall,
i according to the New York Times.
1 Jr. J. Duncan Spaeth of the English
Department argued for Hoover; while
Professor Walter Phelps Hall of the
History Department took the side of
i Smith. Religion, political corruption,
I prohibition, economics, and finance all
entered into the lengthy debate.
Both speakers were opposed to prohibi
tion, but Professor Spaeth declared that
it was a moral issue and not a subject
for political discussion. Professor Hall
showed his stand on this subject by say
ing, "1 want my wine! I want my beer!
But I'm not voting for A1 Smith be
cause of my appetite. As long as a man
can make wine by putting grapes in a
cup it is not intelligent to try to enforce
prohibition."
Dr. Spaeth compared the presidency to
the bridge of a transatlantic liner, Hoo
ver to an experienced seaman, and Smith
to the captain of a New York tugboat.
