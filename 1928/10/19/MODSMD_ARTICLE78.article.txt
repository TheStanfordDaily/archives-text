# DAVIS TO GIVE VARIED STAGE PROGRAM
## Plans Nine Plays During 1928-29 Seasons; First Production Will Feature Stage Sets by Helvenston 
### JOHN RODGERS 
"In the nine productions that we will
give on the campus stage this year, we
will try to satisfy the tastes of everyone,"
declared Gordon Davis, director of dra
matics, in an interview. "The programs
will range from light comedy—such as
'The Queen's Husband' of last Friday
night— to the more serious plays, and
will include musical comedy, probably a
mystery thriller, and an expressionistic
drama."
Davis remarked that the next offering,
"The Devil in the Cheese," is one of the
most unusual things ever to be given in
the Assembly Hall. It is an extravagantly
fantastic comedy which had a remarkable
New York run, and will enable Harold
Helvenston to display his ingenuity in
planning scenic effects; in the first and
third acts the characters have to be hoist
ed to the stage in a basket—the action
takes place on the summit of a steep hill
—and in the second act the setting will
have to suggest the interior of a girl's
mind. He said that it will probably be
the most expensive production of the
year.
"Thriller" Planned
"Following the fantasy is the Football
Show, for which plans are rapidly being
formulated," Davis continued. "And, fin
ishing the quarter, there will be the
Sophomore l'lay—restricted entirely to
sophomores. Probably, in view of the
success of two years ago, we will again
try a mystery play—one with plenty of
shrieks, thuds, falling bodies, and clutch
ing hands."
Most likely "What Every Woman
Knows," by Barrie, will be given early
in 1929, and he hopes that he and Mr.
Allen, University organist, will be able
to put on another Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta. lie expressed himself as being
pleased with the favorable comment
about this kind of a revival. He would
like to have the operetta chosen by a
popular vote.

"bor the English Club play in the
spring 1 would like to try something ex
tremely expressionistic, of the type that
is at present so popular in Germany,"
Davis said. "A play of this kind has
never been doi\e at Stanford. Or we
might do Ibren's 'Wild Duck,' or pos
sibly 'Liliom,' by Molnar. Then will come
the Junior Opera and the Senior Farce
to finish the academic year."
In regard to such plays as "The Cap
tive," which has caused a disturbance in
every city where it has played, Davis
went on to say that he thinks there is 110
place for them, even in a metropolis.
"They may be all right for the adult
mind, but they are certainly not suited
to the young and impressionable, who
flock to see this kind of drama. Neurotic
plays arc not worth the bad results that
they cause."

Knows," by Barrie, will be given early
in 1929, and he hopes that he and Mr.
Allen, University organist, will be able
to put on another Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta. lie expressed himself as being
pleased with the favorable comment
about this kind of a revival. He would
like to have the operetta chosen by a
popular vote.

"bor the English Club play in the
spring 1 would like to try something ex
tremely expressionistic, of the type that
is at present so popular in Germany,"
Davis said. "A play of this kind has
never been doi\e at Stanford. Or we
might do Ibren's 'Wild Duck,' or pos
sibly 'Liliom,' by Molnar. Then will come
the Junior Opera and the Senior Farce
to finish the academic year."
In regard to such plays as "The Cap
tive," which has caused a disturbance in
every city where it has played, Davis
went on to say that he thinks there is 110
place for them, even in a metropolis.
"They may be all right for the adult
mind, but they are certainly not suited
to the young and impressionable, who
flock to see this kind of drama. Neurotic
plays arc not worth the bad results that
they cause."
"In the nine productions that we will
give on the campus stage this year, we
will try to satisfy the tastes of everyone,"
declared Gordon Davis, director of dra
matics, in an interview. "The programs
will range from light comedy—such as
'The Queen's Husband' of last Friday
night— to the more serious plays, and
will include musical comedy, probably a
mystery thriller, and an expressionistic
drama."
Davis remarked that the next offering,
"The Devil in the Cheese," is one of the
most unusual things ever to be given in
the Assembly Hall. It is an extravagantly
fantastic comedy which had a remarkable
New York run, and will enable Harold
Helvenston to display his ingenuity in
planning scenic effects; in the first and
third acts the characters have to be hoist
ed to the stage in a basket—the action
takes place on the summit of a steep hill
—and in the second act the setting will
have to suggest the interior of a girl's
mind. He said that it will probably be
the most expensive production of the
year.
"Thriller" Planned
"Following the fantasy is the Football
Show, for which plans are rapidly being
formulated," Davis continued. "And, fin
ishing the quarter, there will be the
Sophomore l'lay—restricted entirely to
sophomores. Probably, in view of the
success of two years ago, we will again
try a mystery play—one with plenty of
shrieks, thuds, falling bodies, and clutch
ing hands."
Most likely "What Every Woman
Knows," by Barrie, will be given early
in 1929, and he hopes that he and Mr.
Allen, University organist, will be able
to put on another Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta. lie expressed himself as being
