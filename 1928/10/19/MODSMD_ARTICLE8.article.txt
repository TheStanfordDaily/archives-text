# Olympic Events Are Threatened By Foreign Row
## Competing in Tennis, Soccer, Rowing, Swimming Very Doubtful—Vidal 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (£>)— The 1932
Olympic Games at Los Angeles will have
to worry along without foreign competi
tion in rowing, swimming, tennis and soc
cer football unless the International
Olympic Committee grants representation
to the associations governing those sports,
it was declared today by Gaston Vidal,
chairman of the French Olympic com
mittee.
M. Vidal has been in this country ten
days and will return to France a week
from tomorrow. The main purpose of
his trip was to gather facts and figures
concerning the cost of sending a French
Olympic team to the Los Angeles games.
Vidal on "Inside"
With inside developments in European
sports diplomacy and intrigue this round
faced, twinkling-eyed Frenchman is on
the most intimate terms. He told in pic
turesque English of the "what you call—
struggle" now on between the interna
tional rowing, swimming, tennis and soc
cer associations 011 the one hand and the
Olympic governing body on the other.
Clearly in sympathy with the associa
tions in their demand for representation
on the Olympic committee, M. Vidal re
ferred to the latter organization as a
"staff of leaders without any troops." He
said the committee "just reaches out and
names whom it pleases to membership
without consulting the bodies governing
the sports."

George Drigny, France; M. Bon, Switz

of the swimming, rowing and soccer or
ganizations, respectively, he also referred
to as "my friends." He said the non
representation issue had caused tennis
to be omitted from the 1928 program at
Amsterdam. The tennis and soccer asso
ciations also are at odds with the Olym
pic officials over the question of the defi
nition of an amateur.
Otherwise M. Vidal is optimistic re
garding the games which now are nearly
four years away and is eager to assemble
a table of living and transportation costs
to submit to the French parliament.

his trip was to gather facts and figures
concerning the cost of sending a French
Olympic team to the Los Angeles games.
Vidal on "Inside"
With inside developments in European
sports diplomacy and intrigue this round
faced, twinkling-eyed Frenchman is on
the most intimate terms. He told in pic
turesque English of the "what you call—
struggle" now on between the interna
tional rowing, swimming, tennis and soc
cer associations 011 the one hand and the
Olympic governing body on the other.
Clearly in sympathy with the associa
tions in their demand for representation
on the Olympic committee, M. Vidal re
ferred to the latter organization as a
"staff of leaders without any troops." He
said the committee "just reaches out and
names whom it pleases to membership
without consulting the bodies governing
the sports."
General Upset Pictured
"My friend, Louis Canet of France,"
M. Vidal said, "is chairman of the In
ternational Lawn Tennis Association.
George Drigny, France; M. Bon, Switz
erland; and Jules Rimet, France, heads
of the swimming, rowing and soccer or
ganizations, respectively, he also referred
to as "my friends." He said the non
representation issue had caused tennis
to be omitted from the 1928 program at
Amsterdam. The tennis and soccer asso
ciations also are at odds with the Olym
pic officials over the question of the defi
nition of an amateur.
Otherwise M. Vidal is optimistic re
garding the games which now are nearly
four years away and is eager to assemble
a table of living and transportation costs
to submit to the French parliament.
