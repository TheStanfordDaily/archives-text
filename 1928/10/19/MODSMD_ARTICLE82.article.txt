# YEARLINGS MEET ST. MARY'S BABES HERE TOMORROW
## Hope to Avenge '27 Defeat; Expect Rintala, Allen To Star in Fray 
### FRANK WHITELY 
With high hopes of avenging the de
feat of the 1927 freshmen at the hands
of the St. Mary's babes last year Coach
Husky Hunt's 1928 Cardinal yearlings
will take the field against the Gaels to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock in the
Stadium.
"Dutch" Conlan, St. Mary's coach, is
said to have a much heavier line than
lie did in 1927, and an improved back
held. Mike Steponovitch, St. Mary's
center, will be an important factor in to
morrow's game, it is reported. Sports
writers declare that in two games this
season he has shown more promise than
did Bettencourt when that Ail-
American was a freshman, and is the
brightest St. Mary's freshman line pros
pect in several years. If this is the case,
Bob Milligan, Card center, will have
more than enough to do.
Lineup Announced
Hunt's probable' starting lineup will
be as follows: Colvin, le; Grey, It;
Toepke, lg; Milligan, c; Brooks, rg;
Doub, rt; Toll, re; Rintala, lb ; Wilson,
rh; Marks, q; Allen, f. Although a bad
cut under his left eye has not yet healed
Bill Marks, fullback, will be able to get
in tomorrow's game.
Each of the opposing elevens boasts
four triple threat men in the backfield,
with Wiggins, Kaakua, Meyers, and Joy
in the St. Mary's lineup, and Rintala,
Wilson, Marks, and Allen representing
Stanford. Moreover, Hunt has a fifth
triple threat Card in Cadell, who lias
substituted ably this year at both the full
back and halfback positions. Of the St.
Mary's quartet, Kaakua, who came to
this country heralded as the "Red
Grange of the Islands," is perhaps the
most consistent.
Card Backfield Strong
Rintala, Wilson, Marks, ami Allen can
all punt, pass and carry the ball, a set
of attributes seldom possessed by every
member of a freshman backfield. The
Cardinal line has shown improvement
in the last two games and should be
able to hold its own against the Gaels.
Several of the linemen are inexperienced
and will be in their first hard game this
year. With the exception of the Army
game which resulted in a 6 to 6 tie, the
Stanford freshmen have been vastly su
perior to their opponents and had little
difficulty in piling up substantial scores.
