# TRAINING OF CANDIDATES IS COMPARED
## Republican Answers Article by Whitaker on Smith; Outlines Herbert Hoover's Achievement Record 
### 
(This is an article favoring the elec
tion of Herbert Hoover. It is the
fourth of a series of articles. This is
in answer to Virgil Whitaker's article
last Monday.)
By PAUL A. SEXSON
I wish to thank Mr. Whitaker for
his kind thought in Monday's article
on Smith in bringing before the eyes
of the reader the comparison of Mr.
Hoover's training and that of A1
Smith. It saves me the trouble of the
usual little preface. But why he should
bring to the attention of the elector
ate the thing that makes Mr. Smith
shrivel up to mere nothingness when
put alongside of Mr. Hoover is quite
beyond my political comprehension,
except that perhaps down in his heart
he secretly wants Mr. Hoover to win
the election.
The thoroughness and broadness of
our training may be measured by
what we have achieved. Let us look
at the achievement record of Herbert
Hoover.
Achievements Listed
At twenty-five years of age em
ployed as an expert to introduce
American mining methods into Au
stralia, at $15,000 per year. Two years
later a member of the Chinese Cabi
net as Director of the Chinese De
partment of Mines. Co-author of "De
He Metallica," a translation of the
mining technology of the Middle
Ages. Organizer of the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. United States
Food Administrator. Member of Ad
visory Committee of the Washington
Arms Conference. Chairman of the
Unemployment Conference. Member
Interallied Food Council. Member Eu
ropean Coal Council. Chairman of
Mississippi Flood Relief. Secretary of
Commerce. Honorary degrees from 27
world-famous universities, including
Oxford, Liege, and Brussels. These
are only a few of his accomplish
ments.
Is this not the perfection of train
ing? Is this not the most comprehen
sive and broadest training, the most
world-wide experience, requiring the
greatest executive ability, of any can
didate put forward by any political
party. All this in contradistinction to
his opponent, who knows nothing of
international affairs. Hoover's charac
ter is irreproachable. He has the
knowledge and the experience that
would enable him to grasp quickly
and clearly every world problem with
which the United States is sure to be
at grips in the years to come.
Peace Conference Work
In 191S and 1919. at the Peace Con
ference, Hoover fought and defeated
the most astute diplomats in Europe
in his attempt to get American sur
plus food products into the starving
areas of Germany, Poland, and Cen
'ral Europe. For three months he had
to contest every point with, iirst,
1 loyd George, then Clemenccau, then
Orlando, then Foch, then all tour, and
finally after difficult negotiations he
succeeded in reconciling their de
mands with the view of the German
representatives!

t Was there ever a man so well
' qualified and experienced in interna
tional and diplomatic relations to run
I for the presidency?
This man doesn't come out of the
dark; he is not coming into the arena
• for the first time. His record is be
hind him, a marvelous record sucli as
j few men have.
Campaign of Personalities
What better criteria have we on
, which to judge our candidates than
their achievements. What has Mr.
Smith done to compare with anything
! like the achievements of Mr. Hoover?
1 He may be able with marvelous
1 finesse and dexterity to whip, cajole,
j and force a body of state congress
' men to put through local legislative
measures —but is this achievement?
, Is not this merely a victory of popu
' larity—waging a fight with his person
ality? Isn't Mr. Smith's secret of suc
cess his personal popularity, his ap
peal to popular vote? But doesn't it
require less brains to run a campaign
of personalities than any other Intel
; lectual activity in which we may en
jgage? They do not clarify the issues,
neither do they instruct the voters.
I would like to employ the boomer
ang that Mr. Whitaker was so kind
as to give me. I refer to his remark
I that Smith received his political train
; ing in the laboratory, and that he is
ja political scientist. He is a politician
but he is NOT a scientist. This is
common knowledge even among
Smith's friends. Norman Thomas has
reliterated this statement. Mr. Smith
| employs a deductive method of tliink-
I ing and has a deductive point of view.
This was shown repeatedly by his
j dealings with the Water Power, State
j Parks, and Tenement Houses in New
j York. It is shown in his attitude on
; Prohibition. He believes that the Pro
i hibition laws are a complete failure
jaiul ought to be repealed. Mr. Hoover
\ believes it is an experiment, and that
| this is too short a time to. say that it
I is entirely unsuccessful. Mr. Hoover's
j inductive point of view is more scien-
I tific.
The Scientific Attitude
Mr. Hoover is a man of science,
i and he has the scientist's passion for
I perfection, his impatience with mis
takes, his love of order. With these
i propensities lie too has received po
j litical laboratory training, but in the
fields which better equip a man for
the position of chief executive of his
country. Does not'his national experi
ence and international diplomatic re
, lations and experience place him far
above Smith with his purely local
training?
Some people point out that Mr.
' Hoover is an engineer and not a poli
. tician. This criticism is based on
> superficial information. If one will ex
amine his record before Congress he
| will see that Mr. Hoover has the high
j est "hatting average" ever attained
by an individual. He has almost a
| complete record of acceptances. He
J has never had a rupture with Con
gress. It is idle to say that Mr. Hoover

is not a politician. He is not regarded
us a politician and for that reason
it is a great advantage to him. Every
■ ,'iC't a politician makes is looked upon
as the act of a politician and conse- ,
i quently is judged accordingly.
Lack of space prevents any further j
'discussion, but it is quite evident from
Mr. Whitaker's remarks apropos of
! tariff reduction and Prohibition that
he had not read Smith's Lousiville
J speech, or the morning's paper, or
was not well-posted on his metamor
| phic candidate's latest convictions to
see where Mr. Smith stood on that |
I particular day. Mr. Whitaker oaten-;
sibly is a good Democrat, but 1 don't
j believe he is a good Smith Democrat.
His eulogy of Democratic legislative
I achievements quite inadvertently in-1
; eluded Prohibition in the list "of |
' achievements." Mr. Smith lias views j
on that, I believe.
Mr. Whitaker derides the Repub- j
liean administration since 1921. So
uoes Mr. Raskob. I believe Mr. Ras
kob has made only two or three hun
dred millions of dollars personally
during the Republican administra
tion.
Taken all in all to my way of think
ing Mr. Hoover's skill at organiza
tion, his experience with finance, his
understanding of diplomacy, his ac- j
quaintance with Europe, his unshaken |
integrity, his common sense, and his
human touch, place him miles ahead '
of the Democratic candidate, and for j
those reasons he is much more quali- j
fied for the position of chief executive I
iof the United States.

Peace Conference Work
In 191S and 1919. at the Peace Con
ference, Hoover fought and defeated
the most astute diplomats in Europe
in his attempt to get American sur
plus food products into the starving
areas of Germany, Poland, and Cen
'ral Europe. For three months he had
to contest every point with, iirst,
1 loyd George, then Clemenccau, then
Orlando, then Foch, then all tour, and
finally after difficult negotiations he
succeeded in reconciling their de
mands with the view of the German
representatives!

t Was there ever a man so well
' qualified and experienced in interna
tional and diplomatic relations to run
I for the presidency?
This man doesn't come out of the
dark; he is not coming into the arena
• for the first time. His record is be
hind him, a marvelous record sucli as
j few men have.
Campaign of Personalities
What better criteria have we on
, which to judge our candidates than
their achievements. What has Mr.
Smith done to compare with anything
! like the achievements of Mr. Hoover?
1 He may be able with marvelous
1 finesse and dexterity to whip, cajole,
j and force a body of state congress
' men to put through local legislative
measures —but is this achievement?
, Is not this merely a victory of popu
' larity—waging a fight with his person
ality? Isn't Mr. Smith's secret of suc
cess his personal popularity, his ap
peal to popular vote? But doesn't it
require less brains to run a campaign
of personalities than any other Intel
; lectual activity in which we may en
jgage? They do not clarify the issues,
neither do they instruct the voters.
I would like to employ the boomer
ang that Mr. Whitaker was so kind
as to give me. I refer to his remark
I that Smith received his political train
; ing in the laboratory, and that he is
ja political scientist. He is a politician
but he is NOT a scientist. This is
common knowledge even among
Smith's friends. Norman Thomas has
reliterated this statement. Mr. Smith
| employs a deductive method of tliink-
I ing and has a deductive point of view.
This was shown repeatedly by his
j dealings with the Water Power, State
j Parks, and Tenement Houses in New
j York. It is shown in his attitude on
; Prohibition. He believes that the Pro
i hibition laws are a complete failure
jaiul ought to be repealed. Mr. Hoover
\ believes it is an experiment, and that
| this is too short a time to. say that it
I is entirely unsuccessful. Mr. Hoover's
j inductive point of view is more scien-
I tific.
The Scientific Attitude
Mr. Hoover is a man of science,
i and he has the scientist's passion for
I perfection, his impatience with mis
takes, his love of order. With these
i propensities lie too has received po
j litical laboratory training, but in the
fields which better equip a man for
the position of chief executive of his
country. Does not'his national experi
ence and international diplomatic re
, lations and experience place him far
above Smith with his purely local
training?
Some people point out that Mr.
' Hoover is an engineer and not a poli
. tician. This criticism is based on
> superficial information. If one will ex
amine his record before Congress he
| will see that Mr. Hoover has the high
j est "hatting average" ever attained
by an individual. He has almost a
| complete record of acceptances. He
J has never had a rupture with Con
gress. It is idle to say that Mr. Hoover

is not a politician. He is not regarded
us a politician and for that reason
it is a great advantage to him. Every
■ ,'iC't a politician makes is looked upon
as the act of a politician and conse- ,
i quently is judged accordingly.
Lack of space prevents any further j
'discussion, but it is quite evident from
Mr. Whitaker's remarks apropos of
! tariff reduction and Prohibition that
he had not read Smith's Lousiville
J speech, or the morning's paper, or
was not well-posted on his metamor
| phic candidate's latest convictions to
see where Mr. Smith stood on that |
I particular day. Mr. Whitaker oaten-;
sibly is a good Democrat, but 1 don't
j believe he is a good Smith Democrat.
His eulogy of Democratic legislative
I achievements quite inadvertently in-1
; eluded Prohibition in the list "of |
' achievements." Mr. Smith lias views j
on that, I believe.
Mr. Whitaker derides the Repub- j
liean administration since 1921. So
uoes Mr. Raskob. I believe Mr. Ras
kob has made only two or three hun
dred millions of dollars personally
during the Republican administra
tion.
Taken all in all to my way of think
ing Mr. Hoover's skill at organiza
tion, his experience with finance, his
understanding of diplomacy, his ac- j
quaintance with Europe, his unshaken |
integrity, his common sense, and his
human touch, place him miles ahead '
of the Democratic candidate, and for j
those reasons he is much more quali- j
fied for the position of chief executive I
iof the United States.

I wish to thank Mr. Whitaker for
his kind thought in Monday's article
on Smith in bringing before the eyes
of the reader the comparison of Mr.
Hoover's training and that of A1
Smith. It saves me the trouble of the
usual little preface. But why he should
bring to the attention of the elector
ate the thing that makes Mr. Smith
shrivel up to mere nothingness when
put alongside of Mr. Hoover is quite
beyond my political comprehension,
except that perhaps down in his heart
he secretly wants Mr. Hoover to win
the election.
The thoroughness and broadness of
our training may be measured by
what we have achieved. Let us look
at the achievement record of Herbert
Hoover.

' qualified and experienced in interna
tional and diplomatic relations to run
I for the presidency?
This man doesn't come out of the
dark; he is not coming into the arena
• for the first time. His record is be
hind him, a marvelous record sucli as
j few men have.
Campaign of Personalities
What better criteria have we on
, which to judge our candidates than
their achievements. What has Mr.
Smith done to compare with anything
! like the achievements of Mr. Hoover?
1 He may be able with marvelous
1 finesse and dexterity to whip, cajole,
j and force a body of state congress
' men to put through local legislative
measures —but is this achievement?
, Is not this merely a victory of popu
' larity—waging a fight with his person
ality? Isn't Mr. Smith's secret of suc
cess his personal popularity, his ap
peal to popular vote? But doesn't it
require less brains to run a campaign
of personalities than any other Intel
; lectual activity in which we may en
jgage? They do not clarify the issues,
neither do they instruct the voters.
I would like to employ the boomer
ang that Mr. Whitaker was so kind
as to give me. I refer to his remark
I that Smith received his political train
; ing in the laboratory, and that he is
ja political scientist. He is a politician
but he is NOT a scientist. This is
common knowledge even among
Smith's friends. Norman Thomas has
reliterated this statement. Mr. Smith
| employs a deductive method of tliink-
I ing and has a deductive point of view.
This was shown repeatedly by his
j dealings with the Water Power, State
j Parks, and Tenement Houses in New
j York. It is shown in his attitude on
; Prohibition. He believes that the Pro
i hibition laws are a complete failure
jaiul ought to be repealed. Mr. Hoover
\ believes it is an experiment, and that
| this is too short a time to. say that it
I is entirely unsuccessful. Mr. Hoover's
j inductive point of view is more scien-
I tific.
The Scientific Attitude
Mr. Hoover is a man of science,
i and he has the scientist's passion for
I perfection, his impatience with mis
takes, his love of order. With these
i propensities lie too has received po
j litical laboratory training, but in the
fields which better equip a man for
the position of chief executive of his
country. Does not'his national experi
ence and international diplomatic re
, lations and experience place him far
above Smith with his purely local
training?
Some people point out that Mr.
' Hoover is an engineer and not a poli
. tician. This criticism is based on
> superficial information. If one will ex
amine his record before Congress he
| will see that Mr. Hoover has the high
j est "hatting average" ever attained
by an individual. He has almost a
| complete record of acceptances. He
J has never had a rupture with Con
gress. It is idle to say that Mr. Hoover

is not a politician. He is not regarded
us a politician and for that reason
it is a great advantage to him. Every
■ ,'iC't a politician makes is looked upon
as the act of a politician and conse- ,
i quently is judged accordingly.
Lack of space prevents any further j
'discussion, but it is quite evident from
Mr. Whitaker's remarks apropos of
! tariff reduction and Prohibition that
he had not read Smith's Lousiville
J speech, or the morning's paper, or
was not well-posted on his metamor
| phic candidate's latest convictions to
see where Mr. Smith stood on that |
I particular day. Mr. Whitaker oaten-;
sibly is a good Democrat, but 1 don't
j believe he is a good Smith Democrat.
His eulogy of Democratic legislative
I achievements quite inadvertently in-1
; eluded Prohibition in the list "of |
' achievements." Mr. Smith lias views j
on that, I believe.
Mr. Whitaker derides the Repub- j
liean administration since 1921. So
uoes Mr. Raskob. I believe Mr. Ras
kob has made only two or three hun
dred millions of dollars personally
during the Republican administra
tion.
Taken all in all to my way of think
ing Mr. Hoover's skill at organiza
tion, his experience with finance, his
understanding of diplomacy, his ac- j
quaintance with Europe, his unshaken |
integrity, his common sense, and his
human touch, place him miles ahead '
of the Democratic candidate, and for j
those reasons he is much more quali- j
fied for the position of chief executive I
iof the United States.

I wish to thank Mr. Whitaker for
his kind thought in Monday's article
on Smith in bringing before the eyes
of the reader the comparison of Mr.
Hoover's training and that of A1
Smith. It saves me the trouble of the
usual little preface. But why he should
bring to the attention of the elector
ate the thing that makes Mr. Smith
shrivel up to mere nothingness when
put alongside of Mr. Hoover is quite
beyond my political comprehension,
except that perhaps down in his heart
he secretly wants Mr. Hoover to win
the election.
The thoroughness and broadness of
our training may be measured by
what we have achieved. Let us look
at the achievement record of Herbert
Hoover.
Achievements Listed
At twenty-five years of age em
ployed as an expert to introduce
American mining methods into Au
stralia, at $15,000 per year. Two years
later a member of the Chinese Cabi
net as Director of the Chinese De
partment of Mines. Co-author of "De
He Metallica," a translation of the
mining technology of the Middle
Ages. Organizer of the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. United States
Food Administrator. Member of Ad
visory Committee of the Washington
Arms Conference. Chairman of the
Unemployment Conference. Member
Interallied Food Council. Member Eu
ropean Coal Council. Chairman of
Mississippi Flood Relief. Secretary of
Commerce. Honorary degrees from 27
world-famous universities, including
Oxford, Liege, and Brussels. These
are only a few of his accomplish
ments.
Is this not the perfection of train
ing? Is this not the most comprehen
sive and broadest training, the most
world-wide experience, requiring the
greatest executive ability, of any can
didate put forward by any political
party. All this in contradistinction to
his opponent, who knows nothing of
international affairs. Hoover's charac
ter is irreproachable. He has the
knowledge and the experience that
would enable him to grasp quickly
and clearly every world problem with
which the United States is sure to be
at grips in the years to come.
Peace Conference Work
In 191S and 1919. at the Peace Con
ference, Hoover fought and defeated
the most astute diplomats in Europe
in his attempt to get American sur
plus food products into the starving
areas of Germany, Poland, and Cen
'ral Europe. For three months he had
to contest every point with, iirst,
1 loyd George, then Clemenccau, then
Orlando, then Foch, then all tour, and
finally after difficult negotiations he
succeeded in reconciling their de
mands with the view of the German
representatives!

reliterated this statement. Mr. Smith
| employs a deductive method of tliink-
I ing and has a deductive point of view.
This was shown repeatedly by his
j dealings with the Water Power, State
j Parks, and Tenement Houses in New
j York. It is shown in his attitude on
; Prohibition. He believes that the Pro
i hibition laws are a complete failure
jaiul ought to be repealed. Mr. Hoover
\ believes it is an experiment, and that
| this is too short a time to. say that it
I is entirely unsuccessful. Mr. Hoover's
j inductive point of view is more scien-
I tific.
The Scientific Attitude
Mr. Hoover is a man of science,
i and he has the scientist's passion for
I perfection, his impatience with mis
takes, his love of order. With these
i propensities lie too has received po
j litical laboratory training, but in the
fields which better equip a man for
the position of chief executive of his
country. Does not'his national experi
ence and international diplomatic re
, lations and experience place him far
above Smith with his purely local
training?
Some people point out that Mr.
' Hoover is an engineer and not a poli
. tician. This criticism is based on
> superficial information. If one will ex
amine his record before Congress he
| will see that Mr. Hoover has the high
j est "hatting average" ever attained
by an individual. He has almost a
| complete record of acceptances. He
J has never had a rupture with Con
gress. It is idle to say that Mr. Hoover

is not a politician. He is not regarded
us a politician and for that reason
it is a great advantage to him. Every
■ ,'iC't a politician makes is looked upon
as the act of a politician and conse- ,
i quently is judged accordingly.
Lack of space prevents any further j
'discussion, but it is quite evident from
Mr. Whitaker's remarks apropos of
! tariff reduction and Prohibition that
he had not read Smith's Lousiville
J speech, or the morning's paper, or
was not well-posted on his metamor
| phic candidate's latest convictions to
see where Mr. Smith stood on that |
I particular day. Mr. Whitaker oaten-;
sibly is a good Democrat, but 1 don't
j believe he is a good Smith Democrat.
His eulogy of Democratic legislative
I achievements quite inadvertently in-1
; eluded Prohibition in the list "of |
' achievements." Mr. Smith lias views j
on that, I believe.
Mr. Whitaker derides the Repub- j
liean administration since 1921. So
uoes Mr. Raskob. I believe Mr. Ras
kob has made only two or three hun
dred millions of dollars personally
during the Republican administra
tion.
Taken all in all to my way of think
ing Mr. Hoover's skill at organiza
tion, his experience with finance, his
understanding of diplomacy, his ac- j
quaintance with Europe, his unshaken |
integrity, his common sense, and his
human touch, place him miles ahead '
of the Democratic candidate, and for j
those reasons he is much more quali- j
fied for the position of chief executive I
iof the United States.

By PAUL A. SEXSON
I wish to thank Mr. Whitaker for
his kind thought in Monday's article
on Smith in bringing before the eyes
of the reader the comparison of Mr.
Hoover's training and that of A1
Smith. It saves me the trouble of the
usual little preface. But why he should
bring to the attention of the elector
ate the thing that makes Mr. Smith
shrivel up to mere nothingness when
put alongside of Mr. Hoover is quite
beyond my political comprehension,
except that perhaps down in his heart
he secretly wants Mr. Hoover to win
the election.
The thoroughness and broadness of
our training may be measured by
what we have achieved. Let us look
at the achievement record of Herbert
Hoover.
Achievements Listed
At twenty-five years of age em
ployed as an expert to introduce
American mining methods into Au
stralia, at $15,000 per year. Two years
later a member of the Chinese Cabi
net as Director of the Chinese De
partment of Mines. Co-author of "De
He Metallica," a translation of the
mining technology of the Middle
Ages. Organizer of the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. United States
Food Administrator. Member of Ad
visory Committee of the Washington
Arms Conference. Chairman of the
Unemployment Conference. Member
Interallied Food Council. Member Eu
ropean Coal Council. Chairman of
Mississippi Flood Relief. Secretary of
Commerce. Honorary degrees from 27
world-famous universities, including
Oxford, Liege, and Brussels. These
are only a few of his accomplish
ments.
Is this not the perfection of train
ing? Is this not the most comprehen
sive and broadest training, the most
world-wide experience, requiring the
greatest executive ability, of any can
didate put forward by any political
party. All this in contradistinction to
his opponent, who knows nothing of
international affairs. Hoover's charac
ter is irreproachable. He has the
knowledge and the experience that
would enable him to grasp quickly
and clearly every world problem with
which the United States is sure to be
at grips in the years to come.
Peace Conference Work
In 191S and 1919. at the Peace Con
ference, Hoover fought and defeated
the most astute diplomats in Europe
in his attempt to get American sur
plus food products into the starving
areas of Germany, Poland, and Cen
'ral Europe. For three months he had
to contest every point with, iirst,
1 loyd George, then Clemenccau, then
Orlando, then Foch, then all tour, and
finally after difficult negotiations he
succeeded in reconciling their de
mands with the view of the German
representatives!

t Was there ever a man so well
' qualified and experienced in interna
tional and diplomatic relations to run
I for the presidency?
This man doesn't come out of the
dark; he is not coming into the arena
• for the first time. His record is be
hind him, a marvelous record sucli as
j few men have.
Campaign of Personalities
What better criteria have we on
, which to judge our candidates than
their achievements. What has Mr.
Smith done to compare with anything
! like the achievements of Mr. Hoover?
1 He may be able with marvelous
1 finesse and dexterity to whip, cajole,
j and force a body of state congress
' men to put through local legislative
measures —but is this achievement?
, Is not this merely a victory of popu
' larity—waging a fight with his person
ality? Isn't Mr. Smith's secret of suc
cess his personal popularity, his ap
peal to popular vote? But doesn't it
require less brains to run a campaign
of personalities than any other Intel
; lectual activity in which we may en
jgage? They do not clarify the issues,
neither do they instruct the voters.
I would like to employ the boomer
ang that Mr. Whitaker was so kind
as to give me. I refer to his remark
I that Smith received his political train
; ing in the laboratory, and that he is
ja political scientist. He is a politician
but he is NOT a scientist. This is
common knowledge even among
Smith's friends. Norman Thomas has
