WILLI AM STEAD, Island of Cura
cas, (A 3 ) â€” Sixty Venezuelan students,
charged by the government with conduct
ing political agitation, have been supplied
with picks and shovels and put to work
repairing roads near Caracas.
Trouble started several weeks ago
when 13 students were arrested for de
nouncing the action of General Gomez'
government in holding a group of their
fellow students in confinement. A long
protest was prepared and signed by about
60 students demanding that the prisoners
be released. General Gomez replied by
rounding up all the signers with the terse
comment :
"If these students can't keep their
minds on their lessons, we'll show them
what work means."
