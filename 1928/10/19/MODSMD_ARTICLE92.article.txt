# "THE DYBBUK" TO OPEN MONDAY AT TEMPLE THEATRE
## 
### 
San Francisco and Bay region theater
| patrons have expressed a profound inter
est in the forthcoming production of
the great folk play, "The Dybbuk," which
opens Monday evening, October 29th, at
the Temple Playhouse. The play, which
lias had repeated successes in European
capitals, was a sensation of the dramatic
seasons of 1925 and 1927 in New York.
The mammoth task of designing sets
for this production has been undertaken
by Harold Helvenston, technical director
of stage design at Stanford University.
His set for the recently-presented
"Queen's Husband" was the subject of
much favorable comment on the part of
both campus and Palo Alto audiences.
In the design for the "Dybbuk," Hel
venston has tried to inculcate the barest
essentials of the locale presented and
only those physical appurtances necessary
to the plot. An attempt has been made
to arrive at a point in stage decoration
midway between the utter abstraction of
some of the Continental designers and
the ultra-realism of others. In the San
Francisco production not only an Ameri
can audience has to be satisfied, but also
a foreign director.
The "Dybbuk" is internationally
known, having been produced in English,
Yiddish, Hebrew, and other languages in
all the capitals of Europe. The presence
of Mr. Nahum Zemach, founder of the
Moscow Habimah Players, whose produc
tion of the "Dybbuk" is the model for
all others which have followed it, and his
role as director of the Temple Players
production, adds materially to the San
Francisco production. Heading the not
able cast which has been assembled, Mr.
Irving Pichel, one of the genuine favor
ites of Western play-goers, will take the
part of Rabbi Azrael.
