NORMAN, Okla., Oct. 19.—(1.P.) —
At the University of Oklahoma a club
has been formed which is probably
the only one of its kind. It has no
constitution, no by-laws, no program,
no dues, no restrictions, no officers,
and no business meetings after ban
quets. It is the Press Club. Members
expect to have plenty of publicity, if
none of the other conventionalities of
organizations.
