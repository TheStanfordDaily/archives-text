# SENATOR J.D. PHELAN NAMES PROHIBITION, RELIGION AS ISSUES
## California Leader Discusses Al Smith Policies in Answering Daily Questionnaire 
### PHILIP STOCKTON 
Senator James D. Phelan made the
following written statements in reply
to a questionnaire sent him by the
writer. Senator Phelan has been a
leader in California politics for many
years and has helped make California
history. It was largely through his ef
forts that the crucial California dele
gation was pledged to support Gover
nor Smith at the last Democratic con
vention. Senator Phelan has been on
several occasions host to Stanford stu
dents and organizations on his Los
•Gatos estate.
The questions and Senator Phelan's
replies follow:
Q. What do you regard as the para
mount issues in this campaign.
A. Religious intolerance and prohi
bition modification.
Q. Governor Smith's ability is ad
mitted, but has his training been
broad enough to fit him for the presi
dency?
A. Yes. He has been governor of
the Empire State and has cosmopoli
tan training.
Q. Would a Democratic victory be
a victory for personal liberty?
A. Yes. A sentimental and psycho
logical victory, which would silence
intolerance.
Q. What does Governor Smith plan
to do about the 18th amendment? Will
the existing laws be enforced if he is
elected?
A. He will make it a temperance
measure by amendment as far as pos
sible. Now it is a failure as legisla
tion and a fraud. He is best able to
enforce the law and says he will re
spect his oath.
Q. Does Governor Smith support
Boulder Dam and the Swing-Johnston
bill?
A. Yes. He is the one candidate
who favors Government ownership
and operation. Hoover is for private
control.
Q. Do you think that Governor
Smith will lose many votes in this
campaign because of Tammany and
his religion?
A. He will lose, but also gain—
more gain than loss, I believe, because
the trend is toward freedom, and i
Tammany cannot be made an issue.
