## Organization Will Hold 1929 Conclave Here; Adopt New Resolutions 
### 
Scheduling of a presidential straw
vote to be taken simultaneously by
; member colleges was one of the im
| portant acts accomplished at the
Pacific Intercollegiate Press conclave
held at Berkeley last week-end. James
J Frank, business manager of the Daily,
and Templeton Peck, editor, reported |
yesterday upon returning from the
| three-day convention that the vote
' will be held on October 31, and re
sults from all colleges taking the poll
1 will be published on the following
day.
Particular interest will attach to i
the poll here and at the University !
!of California because an intercolle- |
giate three-man split team from the j
: two colleges will meet in a debate on !
Hoover and Smith on Thursday, No- !
vember 1.
Elect Peck President
Peck was elected president of the |
Pacific Intercollegiate president of the !
tion for the coming year and Frank, ;
vice-president. Stanford was selected j
as the site for the 1929 convention.
King Wilkin, graduate manager of
publications at the University of Cali- '*
fornia, was re-elected secretary of the â– 
association.
The suggestion that a common pic- j
tonal section be printed weekly and
distributed to member papers for in- j
j sertion in a regular edition was dis- j
cussed at the Berkeley conference. Or- i
ganization problems and the matter j
of staff politics were considered, as j
well as the proposal favoring a com
mon award for those who work for i
i several years for an appointment and
then fail to get it.
New Resolutions
Resolutions were adopted by the
association to the effect (1) that col
; lege newspapers while being official
organs of their respective student
bodies should also be critics of those
I organizations; (2) that, in order to
obviate staff politics, the editor be
appointed by an electoral board rather
than elected by the direct vote of the
staff.
