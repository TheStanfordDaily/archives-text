# STANFORD TAKES UNDISPUTED LEAD IN CONFERENCE BY VICTORY OVER IDAHO
## Trojan-Bear Tie Is Season's Hardest Battle; U. of Oregon Crushes Washington 
### 
SAN FRANSISCO, Oct. 21. (>P)— An
upset, a tie, and other unexpected
endings combined to give the West
its most thrilling week-end of the
| present football season thus far.
i Out of the mixup, Stanford's Cardi-
S nals stood today as the only unde
feated and untied eleven of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
Stanford went into undisputed lead
ership in the conference with a crush
ing 47-0 victory over Idaho, in San
Francisco Friday. It made three
f;tiaight conference wins for the Red
shirts whose versatile attack com
pletely bewildered the heavy team
from the north.
Trojan-Bear Tie
The hardest-fought conference bat
j tie in years ended yesterday at Berke
| ley in a scoreless tie between South
| era California's Trojans and Califor
j nia's Bears. The two powerful elevens
] hammered at each other's defense for
sixty minutes crammed with action
j and the best that either could do was
I get down to about its opponent's 20-
yard line.
A crowd of 75,000 persons, the larg
est entertained at Memorial Stadium
I aside from the annual game with
Stanford, saw the kickoff. The Trojan
j offense, centered around Don Wil
liams, quarterback, was superior to
I California's, but long kicking on the
1 part of Benny Lom, left halfback, and
| a line that rose to superhuman efforts
lin the crucial moments, gave the
Bears an even break.
Huskies Lose
The unlooked-for happened at Port
land where the University of Oregon
pcunded Washington's Huskies into
submission to the tune of 27-0. Not
since 1924 had an Oregon team been
able to solve a Washington defense,
but the squad that flattened the north
i era member of the conference's "big
four" yesterday turned in an impres
| sive job. The Oregonians scored
| touchdowns in the first and second
periods and came back with two more
' in the last quarter.
Oregon State's powerful squad went
! to Pullman full of hopes but returned
I home on the short end of a 9-7 count,
beaten by Washington State. It was '
| all Oregon State tor the first half,
| which ended 7-0, but the Cougars i
I came back in the third period to score !
I a touchdown and Porter Lainhart, j
halfback, kicked the placekick that
| cinched victory in the fourth quarter.
Montana and University of Califor
! nia at Los Angeles, both playing non
' conference games, won handily. Mon
tana gave Montana Mines a 20-0 whip
ping and U.C.L.A. walloped Pomona,
29-0.

Trojan-Bear Tie
The hardest-fought conference bat
j tie in years ended yesterday at Berke
| ley in a scoreless tie between South
| era California's Trojans and Califor
j nia's Bears. The two powerful elevens
] hammered at each other's defense for
sixty minutes crammed with action
j and the best that either could do was
I get down to about its opponent's 20-
yard line.
A crowd of 75,000 persons, the larg
est entertained at Memorial Stadium
I aside from the annual game with
Stanford, saw the kickoff. The Trojan
j offense, centered around Don Wil
liams, quarterback, was superior to
I California's, but long kicking on the
1 part of Benny Lom, left halfback, and
| a line that rose to superhuman efforts
lin the crucial moments, gave the
Bears an even break.
Huskies Lose
The unlooked-for happened at Port
land where the University of Oregon
pcunded Washington's Huskies into
submission to the tune of 27-0. Not
since 1924 had an Oregon team been
able to solve a Washington defense,
but the squad that flattened the north
i era member of the conference's "big
four" yesterday turned in an impres
| sive job. The Oregonians scored
| touchdowns in the first and second
periods and came back with two more
' in the last quarter.
Oregon State's powerful squad went
! to Pullman full of hopes but returned
I home on the short end of a 9-7 count,
beaten by Washington State. It was '
| all Oregon State tor the first half,
| which ended 7-0, but the Cougars i
I came back in the third period to score !
I a touchdown and Porter Lainhart, j
halfback, kicked the placekick that
| cinched victory in the fourth quarter.
Montana and University of Califor
! nia at Los Angeles, both playing non
' conference games, won handily. Mon
tana gave Montana Mines a 20-0 whip
ping and U.C.L.A. walloped Pomona,
29-0.
