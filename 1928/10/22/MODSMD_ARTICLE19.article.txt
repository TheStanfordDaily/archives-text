# SCOTT WEBSTER INJURED IN AUTO ACCIDENT SUNDAY
## 
### 
Scott Webster, varsity yell leader,
was injured in an automobile accident
occurring early Sunday morning on
the Peninsula highway near the Bur
lingame intersection. The car in which
lie was riding as a passenger, with
Templeton Peck driving, hit a tele
phone pole, and he suffered lacera
tions of the face and concussion of
the brain.
Peck fell asleep at the wheel, and
as Webster already was asleep in his
seat, the machine careened unguided
to the left side of the highway and
struck the pole at a rate which was
probably about 35 miles per hour.
Peck was unhurt, although the front
part of the car was practically de
molished by the impact.
At the Mills Memorial Hospital in
San Mateo, where Webster was taken,
it was said that the victim would be
confined to bed for a week.
