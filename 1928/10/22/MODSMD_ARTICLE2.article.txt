# GOLF SEMI-FINALS SCHEDULED TODAY FOR MURAL MEET
## 
### 
Semi-final matches in the intra
mural golf tourney will be played to
day when Encina 2W plays Breakers
and Alpha Tau Omega plays Kappa
Sigma in the championship flight.
Kappa Sigma won the right to remain
in the play when Los Arcos defaulted.
In the second flight the play was
marred by two defaults. Chi Psi and
Sigma Nu defaulted to Delta Chi and
Encina 2, respectively. Alpha Sigma
Phi defeated Delta Tau Delta, and
Phi Psi defeated Theta Xi. Alpha
Sigma Phi will play Delta Chi and
Encina 2 will meet Phi Psi in the
semi-finals.
