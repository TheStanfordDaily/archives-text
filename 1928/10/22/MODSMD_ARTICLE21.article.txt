# The 						October 31 Poll

Member universities of the Pacific Intercollegiate Press Association
liave agreed to take a poll on October 31 on their campuses to ascertain
the undergraduate stand on the presidential election. It is hoped that
this will give an accurate estimate of student opinion on the matter.
In a student poll taken at Stanford last spring to gain a cross section
of undergraduate opinion on many and various questions, some eight
hundred students participated. Space was left to write in one's choice
for president among the then likely candidates. Hoover polled 704,
votes to Smith's 74.
Opinion no doubt has changed considerably since then, or if not
changed there is a larger number of students •concerned with the situa
tion than there was then. Unless every student votes the estimate of
undergraduate opinion cannot be accurate. Seven hundred votes out of
a possible three thousand is a meager twenty-three per cent of the
electorate. Forty-eight per cent of the electorate voted in the last
presidential election. Is it to be concluded that Stanford students take j
less interest in national politics than the national electorate? The poll
of October 31 will be sufficient answer to this question. —C. D. W.
