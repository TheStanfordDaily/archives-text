# The 						Arkansas Potpouri
## 
### 
Arkansas, a sovereign state in the land of the free, proposes to legis- i
late against the teaching of evolution. Charles Smith, president of the !
American Association for Advancement of Atheism, believing the rights j
of American citizens endangered, marches into the state and begins :
active campaigning against the anti-evolution move. Little Rock, a fair
city in the free state, jails atheist Smith, not because he is an atheist,
but because he is distributing printed matter "calculated to provoke a
breach of the peace." Then, strangest of all, two theists, a Baptist and a
Unitarian minister, rally to the cause and in sermon and in public state- J
ment defend Smith.
What potpouri is this? A cupful of evolution, a sudden dash of i
atheism, a generous sprinkling of suppression of expression of opinion, !
and then, marvel of marvels, the brew is mixed with theists defending :
a denier.
The original issue of to teach evolution or not to teach evolution
seems absurd when it is realized that a university should be a stronghold
of free and unabridged thinking on any and all subjects. The next issue |
of to allow expression of opinion or to suppress it falls in almost the \
same category. For was not this country founded upon the principle of j
freedom as much as on any other principle?
Aside from such, the martyred atheist is gaining nation-wide pub
licity. The sovereign state and its fair city are the cynosure of all eyes
and should be enjoying the spotlight. The ministers have proven them
selves fair and willing to fight for a principle even though an atheist be
involved. And believe it or not the proposed legislation will be presented
to an electorate as indifferent no doubt as the average American electorate
to local politics, despite all this hullabaloo. â€”C. D. W.
