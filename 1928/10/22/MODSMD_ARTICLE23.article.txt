# A
						Change in Rules

Conference has passed the automatic late leave rule and it has been
approved by Miss Yost and President Wilbur. The system is on trial
for the quarter, but the Daily believes that it will be incorporated into
the regular rules of the Associated Women Students.
Judging by the past, it cannot be imagined that women will stop here
as regards the alteration of late leave rules. Changes have already been
inaugurated, and more will come as the years advance. That is progress.
We feel that the women are advancing slowly but surely along the right
line.
