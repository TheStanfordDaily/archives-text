WHAT ARE WE COMING TO? (
Strain your eyes, and you will see |
a few brief sentences on the wall. The
handwriting is Dr. Wilbur's. The abo
lition of the Lower Division isn't an
idea; it's a fact. The elusive Fresh
man will soon be pedestaled next to
the Great Auk. Nearby will perch the
wily Sophomore. The following data
i 3 not an argument for or against this
wholesale amputation. It is merely a
forecast, for the sheer joy of fore
casting, of what will be happening at
Stanford at about the time the Ad
ministration breaks down and gives
the author his diploma—let us say,
roughly, 1935:
1. The end of Stanford's athletic
prowess, which has made it world
lamous during the past few years.
About the same status which Harvard
now has athletically. Pop Warner
either retired, or drawing his little
circles at some institution of less
higher learning (we have no author
ity whatsoever for this prediction).
2. An army of mighty disgruntled
alumni. The head may say Yes to the
new system, but the heart will ever
and staunchly shout No!
3. Fraternities, if permitted to con
tinue, will be improved. Increased
loneliness will send them new ma
terial. Older members, and a closer
approach to the brotherhood idea.
Fewer neckties borrowed; more work
accomplished.
4. Disappearance of the Encina
curse. Encina achieves one good—the
freshmen meet each other. But at
what terrific cost in illusions, alarm

clocks, manners, ideals, furniture, and
good intentions!
5. Fewer good old beer-busts, and a
darn sight less necking.
G. B.A.'s, M.A.'s, Ph.D.'s, J.D.'s, and
M.D.'s bulging with facts but slim on
social graces. Graduates with less
character, and more hetrogeneous.
7. The humiliation of standing by
while U.S.C. turns out, year after
year, the best teams on the Pacific
Coast.
8. The coming of cliquisliness, with
definite social strata. Small groups of
the socially elect will hold themselves
aloof from the hoi polloi.
y. Dozens of forsaken telephone
girls (but anyhow, they are putting in
the dial system).
10. More education.
11. Increased numbers of loving
couples of the Siamese twpe —insepar-
able. The nuisance is not widespread
now.
12. The Honor System will be under
dispute, and they ought to have the
stretch of road between Encina and
Toyon fixed up by that time.
13. Campus activities will be suffer
ing woefully.
14. More Stanford spirit, and more
general interest in world and national
problems. Idealism, and the dying of
! the Mencke.nesque cynic.
15. Two species of women —them
as studies only, and them as craves
! their good time. The gals nowadays
are happy mediums.
16. Stanford will be a pretty dull
place.
17. The Union Cafeteria.
—Winston Norman.

WHAT ARE WE COMING TO? (
Strain your eyes, and you will see |
a few brief sentences on the wall. The
handwriting is Dr. Wilbur's. The abo
lition of the Lower Division isn't an
idea; it's a fact. The elusive Fresh
man will soon be pedestaled next to
the Great Auk. Nearby will perch the
wily Sophomore. The following data
i 3 not an argument for or against this
wholesale amputation. It is merely a
forecast, for the sheer joy of fore
casting, of what will be happening at
Stanford at about the time the Ad
ministration breaks down and gives
the author his diploma—let us say,
roughly, 1935:
1. The end of Stanford's athletic
prowess, which has made it world
lamous during the past few years.
About the same status which Harvard
now has athletically. Pop Warner
either retired, or drawing his little
circles at some institution of less
higher learning (we have no author
ity whatsoever for this prediction).
2. An army of mighty disgruntled
alumni. The head may say Yes to the
new system, but the heart will ever
and staunchly shout No!
3. Fraternities, if permitted to con
tinue, will be improved. Increased
loneliness will send them new ma
terial. Older members, and a closer
approach to the brotherhood idea.
Fewer neckties borrowed; more work
accomplished.
4. Disappearance of the Encina
curse. Encina achieves one good—the
freshmen meet each other. But at
what terrific cost in illusions, alarm

clocks, manners, ideals, furniture, and
good intentions!
5. Fewer good old beer-busts, and a
darn sight less necking.
G. B.A.'s, M.A.'s, Ph.D.'s, J.D.'s, and
M.D.'s bulging with facts but slim on
social graces. Graduates with less
character, and more hetrogeneous.
7. The humiliation of standing by
while U.S.C. turns out, year after
year, the best teams on the Pacific
Coast.
8. The coming of cliquisliness, with
definite social strata. Small groups of
the socially elect will hold themselves
aloof from the hoi polloi.
y. Dozens of forsaken telephone
girls (but anyhow, they are putting in
the dial system).
10. More education.
11. Increased numbers of loving
couples of the Siamese twpe —insepar-
able. The nuisance is not widespread
now.
12. The Honor System will be under
dispute, and they ought to have the
stretch of road between Encina and
Toyon fixed up by that time.
13. Campus activities will be suffer
ing woefully.
14. More Stanford spirit, and more
general interest in world and national
problems. Idealism, and the dying of
! the Mencke.nesque cynic.
15. Two species of women —them
as studies only, and them as craves
! their good time. The gals nowadays
are happy mediums.
16. Stanford will be a pretty dull
place.
17. The Union Cafeteria.
