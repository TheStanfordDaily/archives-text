Lew Tyler and the Ladies. By Wal-:
I
lace Irwin. (Doubleday, Doran, &
Company, 1928.) Palo Alto Book
Shop Lending Library.)
—And in the end Lew Tyler went
back to his wife. In his young days
Lew had been a hard-drinking, fast-;
stepping lover of female pulchritude. 1
He divorced his first wife; then mar
ried Jinny. This second wife reformed
him. Made him a business success,:
steadied him down —and all that sort
of stuff.
The story begins with Lew at the
ago of forty-seven. He is suddenly
overcome with a grand urge to be
bold and bad once more. So we fol
low his career for a year. A series of
intrigues and one or two home runs |
with women of various sorts keep
you entertained in a cheerful and al
most innocent manner. But at tha end
of a year Lew decides he is too old

for that kind of behavior and creeps
home to wife and kiddie.
Wallace Irwin and his brother Will
are, you might say, the "Peck's Bad
Boys" in the history of Stanford. Any
old grad is full of tales about the
pranks of these two early alumni of
Stanford. Their career on the campus
has become elaborated as a result of
the queer tricks that Time plays on
memory. But enough of that.
This last book by Wallace Irwin is
the eighteenth or twentieth he has
written. It is unnecessary to tell you
the style is light and frothy when Ave
mention that it ran as a serial in
College Humor. It's light and harm
less and faintly exciting, if amorous
quests and adventures excite you.
If you like Elinor Glynn or sheik
stories this book will bore you. If you
abhor them, but like a glass of wine
i once in a while we endorse "Lew
Tyler and the Ladies."
