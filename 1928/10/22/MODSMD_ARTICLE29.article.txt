After the California-W.S.C. game
a week ago Saturday it was frequent
ly stated that Nibs Price was holding
his Bears in check. Allowing that as
the truth, Price certainly succeeded
in unchecking his boys Saturday when
the Trojan machine rolled to a stop
in the California Memorial Stadium.
It wasn't the same Berkeley eleven
that had hammered with mediocre
success at the Cougars. California's
playing was improved unbelievably.
Troy was surprised and disgusted.
Stanford fans who sat in that great
Berkeley stadium could well feel
elated at the showing of California
and Southern California. Playing the
same brand of football they played
Saturday, both elevens will not be on
a par with the Warner machine.
It was one great struggle to watch
—the one at Berkeley. The actual grid I
action was rivaled in interest by the
frenzied rooting of both sides, and
the excellent stunts staged in each
section.
One cannot help feeling admiration
for the Southern University. Ultra
collegiate, sophomoric, perhaps, but
alive and vivid. And U.S.C.'s sports
manship, that much-questioned qual
ity, was certainly not to be questioned
Saturday. On the field the Trojans
played hard, clean football, and in the
stands Troy's supporters put their
California rivals to shame.
The small things are noticeable in
a situation like that and In the com
parison U.S.C. was not lacking. When
the Trojan band, gaudily yollow, be
gan to play, the California drum
beaters would invariably break in. ;
When the S.C. rooters rooted an Oski
split the air. And it seemed, always,
that the visitors were the ones who
faded from the scene. Those are small
things, perhaps, and a coincidence
maybe, but the much-defamed sport
ing reputation of Southern California
looked mighty good.
Howard Jones and his boys doubt
less gnashed their teeth frequently
over the condition of the Berkeley j
field. It was worse than it had been
the week before. A rain had turned
the dust into mud and the fleet U.S.C.
backs —not to mention the Bear ball
toters —frequently fell flat while a

good distance from any opposing
tackier.
Afler all is said and done, the fact
is established that California scored
a "moral victory"—whatever that
means. It is seen, too, that Nibs Price
has brought the bedraggled Bear out
of Ihe dumps to a respected place in
Coast fool ball circles.
But to Stanford fans, Saturday's
game moans t hat tlie Cardinal is
bound for another Pacific Coast Con
ference championship.

his Bears in check. Allowing that as
the truth, Price certainly succeeded
in unchecking his boys Saturday when
the Trojan machine rolled to a stop
in the California Memorial Stadium.
It wasn't the same Berkeley eleven
that had hammered with mediocre
success at the Cougars. California's
playing was improved unbelievably.
Troy was surprised and disgusted.
Stanford fans who sat in that great
Berkeley stadium could well feel
elated at the showing of California
and Southern California. Playing the
same brand of football they played
Saturday, both elevens will not be on
a par with the Warner machine.
It was one great struggle to watch
—the one at Berkeley. The actual grid I
action was rivaled in interest by the
frenzied rooting of both sides, and
the excellent stunts staged in each
section.
One cannot help feeling admiration
for the Southern University. Ultra
collegiate, sophomoric, perhaps, but
alive and vivid. And U.S.C.'s sports
manship, that much-questioned qual
ity, was certainly not to be questioned
Saturday. On the field the Trojans
played hard, clean football, and in the
stands Troy's supporters put their
California rivals to shame.
The small things are noticeable in
a situation like that and In the com
parison U.S.C. was not lacking. When
the Trojan band, gaudily yollow, be
gan to play, the California drum
beaters would invariably break in. ;
When the S.C. rooters rooted an Oski
split the air. And it seemed, always,
that the visitors were the ones who
faded from the scene. Those are small
things, perhaps, and a coincidence
maybe, but the much-defamed sport
ing reputation of Southern California
looked mighty good.
Howard Jones and his boys doubt
less gnashed their teeth frequently
over the condition of the Berkeley j
field. It was worse than it had been
the week before. A rain had turned
the dust into mud and the fleet U.S.C.
backs —not to mention the Bear ball
toters —frequently fell flat while a

good distance from any opposing
tackier.
Afler all is said and done, the fact
is established that California scored
a "moral victory"—whatever that
means. It is seen, too, that Nibs Price
has brought the bedraggled Bear out
of Ihe dumps to a respected place in
Coast fool ball circles.
But to Stanford fans, Saturday's
game moans t hat tlie Cardinal is
bound for another Pacific Coast Con
ference championship.
