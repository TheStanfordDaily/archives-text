Tlie Editor, Sir:
My apologies to Lloyd M. Smith, j
Student Leader of the Stanford Band.
11 is criticism of my editorial criticism
was thoroughly justified, and I wish
to retract the unkind words regarding
the Band with assurance to Mr. Smith
that enthusiasm in clinching the point
of the editorial, "Organized Rude
ness," caused me to be a bit too color- j
ful on the keys.
Further assurance to Mr. Smith !
that his "feelings on the subject are l
wrong," and that during three years
of close association with all Campus j
publications I have never encountered
any such unkind or cynical attitude ;
toward the Stanford Band. Any stu- !
deut who pauses to think will agree j
that members of the Band loyally de- |
vote time and effort beyond all propor- j
tion to the credit —curricular, written
or spoken—which they receive. Next
to the actual play, music is the big
gest thing in the game. In my opinion, j
there is no thrill comparable to that
moment Just before the ball sails ]
away on a kickoff, when the Band
strikes up a lively march tune.
All power to the Stanford Band, >
who bring harmony to a University !
whose Administration woefully neg
lects music.
Congratulations to the Daily, which
gives us Farm-hands our only organ
of true democracy, Campus Opinion,
an incentive to thought and a means
whereby we may dispute amicably
and with sincerity. Probably two thou
sand students will read these words j
and draw therefrom opinions pro or J
contra. That is a healthy indication.
