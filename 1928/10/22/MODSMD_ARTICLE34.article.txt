# STANFORD TRIMS IDAHO 47 TO 0 AT KEZAR FRIDAY
## Idaho Gridders Bewildered By Warner Reverses; Army Undefeated 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Fans who saw the Cardinals run
over Idaho 47-0 Friday at Kezar Sta
dium will swear that Stanford has an
other super-machine well to the fore
in its race to the Conference cham
pionship, and that this same Warner
machine carries an abundance of ex
cellent accessory material, particu
larly four bright spark plugs in Small
ing, Lewis, Simkins, and Frentrup.
It was this backfield plus the first
s. ring line that opened up in the third
quarter, took advantage of Idaho's
weaknesses discovered in the last few
minutes of the first half, and turned
the game from a struggle to a walk
away. Hoffman, Fleishhacker, Frent
rup, and Sims started the game and
played well. On paper their playing
does not equal that of the second
combination. They were slow in get
ting started, but they were up against
a fresh outfit, the heaviest in the
Conference. It was this starting team
that tried out the Vandals for weak
spots, only to discover them too late
in the half for more than one score.
Occasionally the Idaho line lived up
to its inflated reputation.
Big Kershisnik, boomed as "a sec
ond Ernie Nevers," didn't have much
of an opportunity to display his wares,
his work being chiefly of a defensive
nature. He was injured tackling Hoff
man in the first quarter and had to
leave soon after, not to return to the
game.
Cards Outguess Vandals
From their performance Friday,
one would guess that the Vandals
saw a reverse play, a fake reverse, or
a delayed buck. Almost every other
play Stanford used one of the three
with great success. Once the reverse
was so well concealed that not even
tlie spectators, straining their eyes to
penetrate the fog, could see where
the ball was going. Time and again
the Cardinal backs passed the enemy
line before their opponents knew just
who had the ball.
Gratifying to Stanford rooters was
the fact that the former machine
worked smoothly no matter what the
combination, and that the Cards gave
all they had, but kept cool. To name
the stars of the game would be to list
the lineup, for it amounts to that.
Fans will remember the stellar work
of that fighting line that made their
gains through the giant Vandals pos-;
sible.
West Point Undefeated
While Stanford was keeping its con
ference slate clean this week-end
West Point defeated Harvard 15-0.
This victory makes the Cadets loom
stronger than ever this season. Both
Stanford and Army seem more than
likely to go through the remainder of
the season without defeat. If they do,
the Stanford-West Point game will be
the greatest in the country this year
if not in football history. The Cadets
have yet to face Notre Dame, twice
defeated this season, but always a
tough opponent. The Fighting Irish
from South Bend will be the under
dog for this contest, but will not be
lacking in punch on that account.
Notre Dame always considers the
annual Army game its most important
contest and consequently points to
ward the game.

the season without defeat. If they do,
the Stanford-West Point game will be
the greatest in the country this year
if not in football history. The Cadets
have yet to face Notre Dame, twice
defeated this season, but always a
tough opponent. The Fighting Irish
from South Bend will be the under
dog for this contest, but will not be
lacking in punch on that account.
Notre Dame always considers the
annual Army game its most important
contest and consequently points to
ward the game.
Coach Cady, Trojan water instruc
tor, has predicted that the varsity
swimming squad will go to Philadel
phia to compete in the national A.A.U.
meet.
Fans who saw the Cardinals run
over Idaho 47-0 Friday at Kezar Sta
dium will swear that Stanford has an
other super-machine well to the fore
in its race to the Conference cham
pionship, and that this same Warner
machine carries an abundance of ex
cellent accessory material, particu
larly four bright spark plugs in Small
ing, Lewis, Simkins, and Frentrup.
It was this backfield plus the first
s. ring line that opened up in the third
quarter, took advantage of Idaho's
weaknesses discovered in the last few
minutes of the first half, and turned
the game from a struggle to a walk
away. Hoffman, Fleishhacker, Frent
rup, and Sims started the game and
played well. On paper their playing
does not equal that of the second
combination. They were slow in get
ting started, but they were up against
a fresh outfit, the heaviest in the
Conference. It was this starting team
that tried out the Vandals for weak
spots, only to discover them too late
in the half for more than one score.
Occasionally the Idaho line lived up
to its inflated reputation.
Big Kershisnik, boomed as "a sec
ond Ernie Nevers," didn't have much
of an opportunity to display his wares,
his work being chiefly of a defensive
nature. He was injured tackling Hoff
man in the first quarter and had to
leave soon after, not to return to the
game.
Cards Outguess Vandals
From their performance Friday,
one would guess that the Vandals
saw a reverse play, a fake reverse, or
a delayed buck. Almost every other
play Stanford used one of the three
with great success. Once the reverse
was so well concealed that not even
tlie spectators, straining their eyes to
penetrate the fog, could see where
the ball was going. Time and again
the Cardinal backs passed the enemy
line before their opponents knew just
who had the ball.
Gratifying to Stanford rooters was
the fact that the former machine
worked smoothly no matter what the
combination, and that the Cards gave
all they had, but kept cool. To name
the stars of the game would be to list
the lineup, for it amounts to that.
Fans will remember the stellar work
of that fighting line that made their
gains through the giant Vandals pos-;
sible.
West Point Undefeated
While Stanford was keeping its con
ference slate clean this week-end
West Point defeated Harvard 15-0.
This victory makes the Cadets loom
stronger than ever this season. Both
Stanford and Army seem more than
likely to go through the remainder of
the season without defeat. If they do,
