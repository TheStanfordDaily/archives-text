# SPORTS OF 1928
## Hoch Louie! 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The old wartime expression has
been slightly changed from "C'est la
Guerre" to "C'est le Gehrig." The
French people used to blame every
thing on to the war, and now the good
citizens of St. Louis blame everything
on to Lou Gehrig, that is, everything
that they don't blame on to Babe
Ruth.
Let us consider a minute what the
ex-Columbia football player did in the
four games of the 1928 World Series.
In eleven times at bat he made six
hits for an average of .545, tying the
former record of Hank Gowdy for a
four or more game series. He scored
five runs, four of them being home
runs, which ties Ruth's record for
total homers in one series. His other
run was scored after getting on first
on a base on balls and coming home
on Meusel's double. He made one dou
ble and a single besides his four cir
cuit clouts, and he was passed six
times, five of the walks coming in
succession! Lou's feat of batting in
nine runs broke the former record
held by Bob Meusel, made in 1923.
As for fielding, Gehrig handled
thirty-three chances, all of them put
outs, without an error, although there
are some, including this cartoonist,
who thinks he and not Lazzeri, should
have been credited with an error on
Tony's high throw to first in the sec
ond game.
As Babe Ruth said, they didn't have
to pass a law against intentional
passes to the heavy hitters, for what
pitcher was going to pass Ruth with

Gehrig coming up next? Double doses
or' poison, those two. Trinitrotoluene
Ruth and Trinitrotoluol Gehrig! Go to
see them on their barnstorming tour
if you get the chance. You'll never
regret it.
