# CARD FRESHMEN CRUSH ST. MARY'S YEARLINGS 19 TO 0
## Stanford Defense Strong; Stepanovitch, Saint Pivot Man, Good 
### 
Though failing to display the
smooth-working team-play that it has
shown in previous games this season,
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman eleven
possessed sufficient strength to over
power the St. Mary's yearlings 19 to
0 here Saturday and avenge the defeat
cf the 11)27 frosh by the Gaels. This
is the fourth consecutive win for the
Cards in five starts. The other game,
the first of the year, resulted in a C
to 6 tie.
A strong offense and a defense that
smothered all attempts of the visitors
to gain yardage again were in evi
dence in the freshman triumph. Only
once, and then in the first quarter,
did St. Mary's advance the ball past
the 50-yard mark toward the Stanford
goal line. After penetrating a few
yards, the sturdy defense of the Card
freshmen forced the Gaels to punt.
Rudy Rintala, speedy freshman
back, played a beautiful game for a
few minutes of the first quarter until
taken out with a minor injury to his
side, being replaced by Arnold.

Reverses by Rintala and line
plunges by Dusty Allen, fullback, ac
j counted for the first Stanford score |
early In the game. Cadell, who had
replaced Wilson at right half, in the
second quarter, with several substan
| tial gains on off-tackle plays, carried
j the ball well into St. Mary's terri
! Tory where a long pass, Arnold to
; Toll, scored a touchdown. Another
| long pass, Allen to Toll, in the third i
i period, placed the ball near St. Mary's
goal; and line bucks by Allen" and
Cadell pushed it across for the third
j score of the game. Grey converted the ;
; goal following the second touchdown.

been heralded as the greatest centeri
to play on a freshman team at St.!

I urday, being in on almost every play, j
Cadell, who played in both the right!
j half and fullback positions Saturday, j
has shown improvement in every l
| game this season and has developed I
| into a real triple-threat man who can
| kirk, pass, and carry the ball. Dusty i
Allen, 172-pound fullback, was the !
mainstay of the Card defense. Doub
and Grey have developed into a first- j
rate pair of tackles and Saturday!
showed up well.

Though failing to display the
smooth-working team-play that it has
shown in previous games this season,
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman eleven
possessed sufficient strength to over
power the St. Mary's yearlings 19 to
0 here Saturday and avenge the defeat
cf the 11)27 frosh by the Gaels. This
is the fourth consecutive win for the
Cards in five starts. The other game,
the first of the year, resulted in a C
to 6 tie.
A strong offense and a defense that
smothered all attempts of the visitors
to gain yardage again were in evi
dence in the freshman triumph. Only
once, and then in the first quarter,
did St. Mary's advance the ball past
the 50-yard mark toward the Stanford
goal line. After penetrating a few
yards, the sturdy defense of the Card
freshmen forced the Gaels to punt.
Rudy Rintala, speedy freshman
back, played a beautiful game for a
few minutes of the first quarter until
taken out with a minor injury to his
side, being replaced by Arnold.

Reverses by Rintala and line
plunges by Dusty Allen, fullback, ac
j counted for the first Stanford score |
early In the game. Cadell, who had
replaced Wilson at right half, in the
second quarter, with several substan
