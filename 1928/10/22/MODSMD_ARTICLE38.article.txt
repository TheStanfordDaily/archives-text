I The world's oldest man, 154-year-old
| Zaro Agha, is amazing his teacher by
his agility in mastering his ABC's,
j The prefect of Stamboul, whom the
sprightly centenarian serves as door
keeper, has ordered all municipal ser
vants to read and write the newly
adopted Latin alphabet of 29 letters.
Turkey is using this to replace the
GOO characters of the Arabic alpha
bet, which 12V6 million other Turks,
besides old Zaro, had never learned.
