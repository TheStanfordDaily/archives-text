# LAWRENCE TIBBETT TO GIVE INITIAL CONCERT OF SEASON FRIDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Lawrence Tibbett, who will open ;
the A.S.S.U. Concert Series in the
Stanford Pavilion Friday night is pe- |
culiarly an American musician. In a
triple sense Tibbett is a product of
this country. He was born in Cali
fornia, received his entire training in
America, and here achieved world
popularity.
Tibbett was born thirty years ago
in Bakersfield. When he was six years '
old, his father, who was sheriff of
Kern County, was killed by bandits.
Tibbett's mother, with her two other
children, moved to Los Angeles where
the future opera star gained his pre- j
liminary education at Manual Arts
High School. He joined the glee c*ub, !
and took part in dramatics under the j
direction of Maude Howell, who was
a Masquer at Stanford and is now
stage manager for George Arliss.
After leaving Manual Arts, Tibbett \
was engaged by a Shakespearian
Repertory company assembled by Ty
rone Power. At the same time he was
singing in church choirs and in con- ' <

j cert, gaining what voice training he
; could, and studying alone.
Tibbett served in the U.S. Navy dur
] ing the World War, and at its close
; went back to the stage and played in
; light opera. In 1923 he succeeded in
getting an engagement in New York
I City.
It was in his second season at the
Metropolitan that Tibbett made the
sensation which brought him world
fame. Since that date he has been
singing in opera, and this is the sec
ond season that his manager has
made it possible for people all over
the United States to hear him.
Tickets will be given out' to stu
dents for the concert Friday night
beginning today at 1 o'clock in the
Old Union, according to Sid Madden,
present concert manager. There are
still a few season tickets left, and a
canvass of the living groups will be
made this week by Madden.
An all-University dance will be held
at Branner Hall following the concert.
Admission to the dance will be one
dollar.
