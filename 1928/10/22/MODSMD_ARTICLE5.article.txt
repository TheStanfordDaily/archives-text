# FROSH WHIP 1931 TEAM IN INITIAL INTERCLASS TILT
## 
### 
Long end runs by the frosh proved
; to be the downfall of the sophomores
j in the initial contest of the interclass
I season Saturday morning. The babes
made two sweeping end runs of twen
ty-eight and thirty-five yards respec
| tively and thereby overcame a six
yoint lead made by the second-year
men in the first few minutes of play.
The final score was 12 to 6.
Two plays after the opening kickoff,
Jim Lail scooped up a freshman fum
ble and dashed forty-five {yards to a
1 touchdown to give the sophs first
blood. Gatzert failed to convert and
for the remainder of the quarter the
ball stayed around midfield.
For the remainder of the fray, it
was all yearlings. Janin, giant frosh
fullback, bucked the ball down the
' field to the thirty-five yard mark, and
! from there Ralph Giberson, fleet frosh
halfback, ran around left end for a
touchdown. In the last period, with
two minutes to play, a second-year
end allowed himself to be drawn in
and the babes scooted around him for
their second score.
The line of the class of '31 failed
1 to function properly throughout. The
men were charging and tackling high
and thus enabled their opponents to
break through easily. Gatzert and
j Howe were the outstanding players
on this team.
The class of '32 gridders will bear
watching during the rest of interclass
| competition as they play heads up
football. They have strong flankmen
and a good center, and Giberson and
Janin, in the backfleld, will make
trouble for the winner of the junior
senior game.
Tomorrow will see a hard contest
between the seniors, last, year's win
ners, and the heavy junior team. Nei
ther coach has announced his lineup
and probably will not do so until just
before the fray.
