# SMITH ASKS FOR CLOSE CONTACT OF PEOPLE, EXECUTIVE
## Democratic Candidate Plans To Maintain Personal Touch With Public 
### 
ALBANY, N.Y., Oct. 21. (/p)—Back
i home from a 3600-mile campaign
i swing, Governor Smith was resting to
night for an intensive drive to be
made in North Atlantic seaboard
states during the last ten days pre
ceding election. He will open his final
! drive in Boston on Wednesday night.
On his way here from Utica, where
a stop was made to attend church,
! the nominee at a conference with
' press correspondents in the club car
! of the special train expressed satis
laction over his trip which carried
; him through a part of the "Solid
South," the Border States, and the
Midwest.
He said he believed in a candidate's
personally carrying his issues to the
people and that in his opinion the
value of this was demonstrated by
the "number of telegrams and the
j number of letters that we get in re
sponse." He also said if he were
I elected president he proposed at times
to leave the White House to visit
other parts of the country.
The nominee was questioned as to
! whether he thought Herbert Hoover,
his rival for the presidency, was any
"more silent than the general run ui
Republican candidates."
"He is just about the standard
j type," he replied. A correspondent
then referred to the number of
speeches made by the Republican
l nominee and the Governor inter
j 1 upted.
"We never had any kind of Repub
! lican candidates but silent ones, with
the exception of Roosevelt, that I can
1 remember. They are only running
■ true to form. It isn't an innovation. It
is the stock, ordinary, every day arti
; cle is offered to us. They are all silent
men, except Roosevelt. He was the
only one who talked out."
The Democratic nominee was asked
I for his opinion as to why Republican
candidates are "silent."
"The principal reason is that they
, cannot defend the record," he an
j swered, and to another query replied:
"If you become President, will you
continue the mythical White House
spokesman?" the Press continued.
"No, sir? No, sir," he answered. "I
I shall talk for myself and will have
; press conferences daily."
I "In these daily conferences," his
questioner went on, "will we have to
, submit our questions in writing so as
to give you a little thinking time?"
"No," he said, and then asked if he
would permit oral questions, he
added: "You can run it the way this
one is being run. What I have stood
for eight years, I can stand for four
more years."
