### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 21. (/P)â€”Soviel |
newspapers and some Russian govern
ment officials see in the $21,000,000
contract signed by the Soviet Union
with the General Electric Company,
not only a forerunner of American in
vestments in this country but also an I
entering wedge which may ultimately
lead to government recognition.
The signing of the contract was an- '
neunced last Wednesday in New
York. It called for the delivery of
American electrical apparatus valued
at more than $20,000,000, the payment
basis being 25 per cent before ship
ment, with the remainder covered by
trade acceptances falling due within
live years.
The newspaper Pravda, organ of 1
the Central Committee of the Russian I
Communist Party, says that one of'
the most important aspects of the '
deal is that the State Department at 1
Washington was cognizant of the ne
gotiations "and did not object to
granting long-term credits to the
Union of Socialist Soviet Republics,
provided the money was spent in the
United States."
