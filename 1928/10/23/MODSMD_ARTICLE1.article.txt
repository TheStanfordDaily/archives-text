# START SECRET PRACTICE FOR TROJAN GAME
## Coach Warner Closes Field To Visitors, Reporters Until After Tilt November 3 
### CARROL O'MEARA 
The "Big Drive" has started. A
spectacular army of red-and-gold
Trojans encamped in Los Angeles is
the ultimate objective. When hand
some Jesse Hibbs' warriors have been
taken, Stanford will practically have
possession of the Conference title.
Pop Warner, generalissimo of the
Invading Cardinals, is planning his
strategic maneuvers, and in order
tnat such private information will re
main private, General Warner has
closed the local training ground to
visitors and will maintain a strict
guard until after the battle. Some fifty
onlookers and reporters were barred
from practice yesterday and were ad
vised that all secret-practice passes
Avere null and void until November 5.
Not that Warner suspects there are
apies within the walls, but that he
believes in the epigrammatical ex
pression, "Trust your friends, but cut
the cards." Pop has decided to cut
the cards, at least on this deal.
The Fresno contest next Saturday
will only amount to a "sham" battle
in preparation for the big grid strug
gle of the West this season.
Nearly 80,000 spectators will wit
ness the Card-Trojan fray when it
takes place in the famous Los An
geles Coliseum on November 3. Every
one of the 76,500 seats has been sold
and some thousands of ushers, police
men, and officials have been engaged,
according to a report received from
the Southern California headquarters
yesterday.
