# Dawes Declares Prosperity Vital Campaign Issue
## Vice-President Talks in N.Y. On How Average Man Will Cast Vote 
### 
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, NEW
YORK, N.Y., Oct. 22. (/P)—Vice-
President Charles G. Dawes received
an ovation from a crowd of 18,000
New York enthusiasts who filled Madi
son Square Garden to overflowing
when he declared that the votes of
the average man, lead by common
sense, would elect Herbert Hoover to
j the presidency.
General Dawes said:
"The campaign is nearing its close,
the two party platforms, both of them
too long and argumentative perhaps
to have been carefully read and con
sidered by the majority of our voters,
have been presented and discussed.
We are hearing from the partisans
of both sides, the strong and incon
sistent claims which are always in
cident to the close of a national con
test. The confusion of appeals thick
ens.
Average Man Sensible
"If the average citizen in voting
made up his mind as to his duty by
mentally weighing the opposing argu
ments, he too might be confused in
reaching his decision, but he does not
'do so. On the contrary, as the argu
ment becomes more voluminous and
acrimonious, his mind becomes clear
er, for he is applying his common
sense to the situation. The average
man will go to the polls on November
j sixth with some one great considera
tion in his mind which determines his
vote —not a half-dozen considerations.
When asked, he will be able to state
that consideration in a few words and
those words will be his interpretation
of the common sense of the situation.
If one can now define what the cora
, mon sense of the situation is as visu-
I alized by the average man, he will
] have stated the argument most ac
, ceptable to voters as a guide to de
| cision. In addition he will be brief
| for common sense demands brevity.
Prosperity Vital Issue
"Common sense tells us that the
| real and overshadowing issue in this
campaign urged by the instincts, and
uppermost in the consciousness, of the
average voter is the issue always
deminant when tranquility and pros
perity exist in the country.
"That issue is the maintenance of
prosperity.
"Now the average voter realizes
that the maintenance of prosperity
depends upon the maintenance of gen
eral confidence. The average man
senses the dangers of impairing gen
ex'al confidence by a changing of gov
ernmental administration in a period
of prosperity. The slightest reflection
on his part upon the situation sug
gests immediately what he feels in
stinctively—that a change in adminis
tration means confusion and change
in governmental programs and poli
cies and that in turn, means the pass
ing of confidence which is the very
foundation of our present national
prosperity and comparative industrial
and social peace.
Not Prohibition Referendum
"The existence of this dominant is
sue of prosperity renders it hopeless
to regard the result at the November
polls as a sentimental referendum on
the Prohibition question, and it ren
ders that result untrustworthy even
as an indication of the state of public
sentiment on Prohibition.
"These are the reasons which lead
me to believe that the average voter
upon the issue of preserving prosper
ity, which is dominant in this cam
paign, will vote for the continuance
of a Republican administration, and
it will be the average voter who de
termines the result of the election.
