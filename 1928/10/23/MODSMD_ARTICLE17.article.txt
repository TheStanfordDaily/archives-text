# FROSH TO PETITION ENCINA COMMONS TO RUN FULL WEEK
## 
### 
Petitions will be passed among the
freshruen at noon today in an attempt
to have the Encina Commons dining
halls open seven days each week as
they previously were operated. The
move was the culmination of growing
discontent among the men who are
forced to eat in the Commons.
Freshmen were unanimous in vot
ing the circulation of the petition in
their meeting last night. Austin Clapp,
president of Encina Club, brought the
motion before the group for approval.
In stating the stand of the freshmen,
Clapp said that the concensus of opin
ion seemed to indicate that since the
dining halls were operated seven days
last year, they might be so operated
again, and at the same price.
