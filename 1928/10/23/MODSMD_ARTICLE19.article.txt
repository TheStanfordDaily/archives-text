# ATWILL TO PLAY FATHER ROLE IN CAMPUS COMEDY
## 
### 
John Atwill has been chosen by
Gordon Davis to portray the role of
Joseph Quigley in the Sword and
Sandals comedy, "The Devil in the
Cheese." Atwill has been prominent
in campus dramatics, his last part
having been that of the middle-aged
business man, Martin Burke, in "One
of the Family," the Senior Farce last
June. He has also played in "So This
Is London" and "Caesar and Cleo
patra."
It is Quigley's desire to find out
what is inside the mind of his daugh
ter, Goldina, that leads him to seeing
the devil that is in the cheese. By
the aid of the little god Min, of
Egypt, Quigley penetrates the inner
recesses of thoughts and dreams of
his modern young daughter. This ac
tion takes place in the second act
where the characters are seen through
the mind of Goldina.
Quigley's Life a Game
Quigley is an American millionaire
from Kansas whose hobby is antiques
and archaeology. He has the spoiled
child's petulance that goes with a
great success in commercial life. Life
to him is a game where people are
ivory chessmen to be pushed this way
and that by Quigley's will. It is when
hia daughter crosses his will that he
is called to make some effort to un
derstand her.
Quigley's role calls for a versatility
ranging from the determined man's
plans to isolate his daughter on top
of a mountain in Greece so that she
may not see the young man whom
she loves, to the sympathetic man's
understanding of youth and its prob
lems.
