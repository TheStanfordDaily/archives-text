# COUNCIL ACTS DEFINITELY ON HONOR SYSTEM
## To Publish Offender's Name; Rule Applies Only to Conduct in Exams Is Decision 
### 
Definite action toward the rehabili
tation of the honor system was taken
last night by the Men's and Women's
Councils, holding a joint, informal
meeting at the home of Margaret
Owen for purposes of discussing the
topic which has received so much
consideration this quarter.
The council members were in favor,
first of all, of a definite statement of
exactly what the honor system is or
is supposed to be. The honor spirit,
it was declared, applies to conduct in
examinations or in any work which
is to be used as a basis of grading.
Distilled, it means simply "no cheat
ing." It does not apply to personal
conduct of any other sort about or off
the campusâ€”e.f., to drinking, stealing,
passing bad checks, or incurring lock
cuts.
Secondly, the councils decided that
anyone reported to them and found
guilty of violation of the honor sys
tem would be dismissed from the Uni
versity.
Thirdly, it was decided that names
of offenders would be published on
the official council bulletin board and
in the Daily.
The councils held a discussion of
considerable length over the honor
system and made a number of sugges
tions for its well-being which will be
considered by the committee ap
pointed by President Cavalero of the
A.S.S.U. to study the problem. Discus
sion of the present honor situation
received its chief impetus at a dinner
given by Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur last
Thursday night, at which the mem
bers of the two councils, the president
of the A.S.S.U., and the chairman of
the honor investigation committee
were guest?.
