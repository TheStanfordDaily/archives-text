# Honor System Opposed
## 
### 
We present herebelow a hue example of the sort of publicity the
University is getting in regard to the unsteady standing of the honor
system. It is from the Ignatian News, official organ of St. Ignatius Col
lege. Of course the facts are untrue; Dr. Wilbur does not state that the
honor system is "all wrong"—no one has more confidence in it, properly
operating, than lie. Nevertheless, the Ignatian News' argument lingers
on, and we reprint it because it expresses so accurately the viewpoint of
those who think that an honor spirit cannot be an effective, silent force
in the classroom.
So now it can be told. The best system of espionage in the classroom
during the progress of an examination is the teacher's watchful orb, whether
in college, high school, or grammar grades.
This, after several years of the honor system in the big universities of
the country, is the opinion of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur of Stanford University,
who is in a position to view the situation first hand if anyone is at all. For
Dr. Wilbur has seen the system of honor work out, or not work out ,in his
own university at Stanford, and he states that the thing is all wrong.
The honor system has never been established at St. Ignatius, nor will it
be. Kindly picture to yourself the scene that would ensue if the professor
suddenly walked out of the room and let things take their own course, and
then came back and collected the papers from a final examination.
Anyone can see the honor system won't work out for two perfectly good
reasons. It divides the responsibility of the professor to curb the natural
tendencies of students who find certain questions difficult, and the matter
in a book right at hand, to the class of individuals in the class who do know
the matter.
Now the individuals in the class who do know the matter thoroughly,
and feel that they can and ought to get a high grade, are decidedly in the
minority.
The remainder knows the matter just in a passing manner, and is ready
to take it, come from whence it will.
If it should happen to come from notes or the next fellow's, who cares?
It's the correct solution to the particular question, and that's all that's neces
sary.
So if the high grade student is to tell on the mediocre student for
something he saw occur in a surreptitious manner during an examination,
the mere telling of what he saw makes him, instead of a high grade student,
a high grade "snooper" and tattle tale, and decidedly not a good fellow.
Also he's minding everybody else's business but his own. But what if
he doesn't tell, as after all, most don't, on the other fellow. Supposing he
goes along and minds his own business and forgets what he sees go on
around him.
Then, of course, the papers handed in which have been added to from
other sources do not represent the true intelligence and knowledge of the
individual. And the professor returns to pick up a lot of papers that have
really no significance at all.
This honor system makes knowledge a general thing instead of the
personal thing it really is. Nobody cares, or nobody should care, but the pupil
himself, whether he's getting the education he wants or not. If he doesn't
care, then there's no reason in the world why he should be forced to care,
or why he should be pointed out by fellow students to his instructors as a
sluggard and a cheat.
That ought to be obvious to the instructor after one term at any college,
large or small, and he would be a poor type of instructor who couldn't tell it.
The honor system is just passing the buck from professor to student.

be. Kindly picture to yourself the scene that would ensue if the professor
suddenly walked out of the room and let things take their own course, and
then came back and collected the papers from a final examination.
Anyone can see the honor system won't work out for two perfectly good
reasons. It divides the responsibility of the professor to curb the natural
tendencies of students who find certain questions difficult, and the matter
in a book right at hand, to the class of individuals in the class who do know
the matter.
Now the individuals in the class who do know the matter thoroughly,
and feel that they can and ought to get a high grade, are decidedly in the
minority.
The remainder knows the matter just in a passing manner, and is ready
to take it, come from whence it will.
If it should happen to come from notes or the next fellow's, who cares?
It's the correct solution to the particular question, and that's all that's neces
sary.
So if the high grade student is to tell on the mediocre student for
something he saw occur in a surreptitious manner during an examination,
the mere telling of what he saw makes him, instead of a high grade student,
a high grade "snooper" and tattle tale, and decidedly not a good fellow.
Also he's minding everybody else's business but his own. But what if
he doesn't tell, as after all, most don't, on the other fellow. Supposing he
goes along and minds his own business and forgets what he sees go on
around him.
Then, of course, the papers handed in which have been added to from
other sources do not represent the true intelligence and knowledge of the
individual. And the professor returns to pick up a lot of papers that have
really no significance at all.
This honor system makes knowledge a general thing instead of the
personal thing it really is. Nobody cares, or nobody should care, but the pupil
himself, whether he's getting the education he wants or not. If he doesn't
care, then there's no reason in the world why he should be forced to care,
or why he should be pointed out by fellow students to his instructors as a
sluggard and a cheat.
That ought to be obvious to the instructor after one term at any college,
large or small, and he would be a poor type of instructor who couldn't tell it.
The honor system is just passing the buck from professor to student.
We present herebelow a hue example of the sort of publicity the
University is getting in regard to the unsteady standing of the honor
system. It is from the Ignatian News, official organ of St. Ignatius Col
lege. Of course the facts are untrue; Dr. Wilbur does not state that the
honor system is "all wrong"—no one has more confidence in it, properly
operating, than lie. Nevertheless, the Ignatian News' argument lingers
on, and we reprint it because it expresses so accurately the viewpoint of
those who think that an honor spirit cannot be an effective, silent force
in the classroom.
So now it can be told. The best system of espionage in the classroom
during the progress of an examination is the teacher's watchful orb, whether
in college, high school, or grammar grades.
This, after several years of the honor system in the big universities of
the country, is the opinion of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur of Stanford University,
who is in a position to view the situation first hand if anyone is at all. For
Dr. Wilbur has seen the system of honor work out, or not work out ,in his
own university at Stanford, and he states that the thing is all wrong.
The honor system has never been established at St. Ignatius, nor will it
be. Kindly picture to yourself the scene that would ensue if the professor
suddenly walked out of the room and let things take their own course, and
then came back and collected the papers from a final examination.
