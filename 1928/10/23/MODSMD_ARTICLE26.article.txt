# Class Distinctions in Russian Universities
## 
### 
In America the social tone of the colleges is generally set by the stu
dents who come from the homes of the well-to-do, the intellectuals, the
prominent—the intelligentsia and the bourgeoisie. Individuals of humble
origin freqnently pass all social barriers because of innate personal quali
ties, but they do not often set the standards. Colleges and universities
generally seek to insure the attendance of a considerable quota of the
latter class, offering opportunities to them to work their way or granting
scholarships to assist the most promising. The current Who's Who states
that of those mentioned in its pages who furnished educational data, 77
out of every 100 attended college.
In Russia, as reported by a correspondent of The London Observer,
effort is made to make sure that at least 65 per cent of the students shall
be of pure proletarian origin. The manual workers and their children arc
the "privileged class." In theory, it is stated that "it is almost as easy
for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle as for the son or daughter
of a wealthy man to pass the argus-eyed reception commissions which
guard the portals of the Russian universities." In practice, however, the
children of the educated and middle-class families—the specialists and
other non-proletarians—often come better prepared, and it is, or would
be, difficult to maintain the proletarian ratio if scholastic merit were made
the sole basis for admission. Exception is often made in favor of youths
from the families of professors, engineers and other educated persons.
The rich nepman's children are, however, barred out. Instances are cited
of his ingenuity in getting by. Sometimes the son is sent to work in a
store or factory in order that he may, despite his bourgeois origin, he
admitted as a full-fledged proletarian.
As it is, the percentage of manual workers' children is estimated to be
higher than in any other country, and every increase in the number from
working class homes is hailed as "an improvement in the social tone of
the educational institutions." This year there were only 6,000 places open
in the Moscow universities, with 20,000 applicants, of whom 5,000 were
workers and their children—enough more than to fill the workmen's
quota but leaving few places for the "unprivileged" from homes of Rus
sia's past culture or present wealth. It would he of interest to know ten
years from now where in the social order these now proletarian students
will be, and to know twenty years from now whether their children, sons
and daughters of parents by that time no longer proletarian, will be
eligible for admission to the university.—A r f7C York Times.

origin freqnently pass all social barriers because of innate personal quali

In Russia, as reported by a correspondent of The London Observer,
effort is made to make sure that at least 65 per cent of the students shall
be of pure proletarian origin. The manual workers and their children arc
the "privileged class." In theory, it is stated that "it is almost as easy
for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle as for the son or daughter
of a wealthy man to pass the argus-eyed reception commissions which
guard the portals of the Russian universities." In practice, however, the
children of the educated and middle-class families—the specialists and
other non-proletarians—often come better prepared, and it is, or would
be, difficult to maintain the proletarian ratio if scholastic merit were made
the sole basis for admission. Exception is often made in favor of youths
from the families of professors, engineers and other educated persons.
The rich nepman's children are, however, barred out. Instances are cited
of his ingenuity in getting by. Sometimes the son is sent to work in a
store or factory in order that he may, despite his bourgeois origin, he
admitted as a full-fledged proletarian.
As it is, the percentage of manual workers' children is estimated to be
higher than in any other country, and every increase in the number from
working class homes is hailed as "an improvement in the social tone of
the educational institutions." This year there were only 6,000 places open
in the Moscow universities, with 20,000 applicants, of whom 5,000 were
workers and their children—enough more than to fill the workmen's
quota but leaving few places for the "unprivileged" from homes of Rus
sia's past culture or present wealth. It would he of interest to know ten
years from now where in the social order these now proletarian students
will be, and to know twenty years from now whether their children, sons
and daughters of parents by that time no longer proletarian, will be
eligible for admission to the university.—A r f7C York Times.
