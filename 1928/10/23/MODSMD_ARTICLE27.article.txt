"My Son" —Alcazar.
Henry Duffy proves that he can pre
sent a deeply emotional play as well as
lie can light comedies. His current at
traction at the Alcazar is a powerful
drama of mother-love, engrossing, hu
man, and excellently acted.
Leah Winslow stepped into the lead
ing role, that of Anna Silva, the Portu
guese mother, when Marjorie Rambeau
had to leave to recuperate from a severe
cold. And personally, Miss Winslow is a
lot more to our liking than the more
noted actress who was originally slated
for the part.
In the capable characterization of Miss
Winslow there is nothing more to be
desired. She makes one believe, sympa
thize, laugh, and suffer with the mother.
She makes, her real—and that is a feat
Miss Rambeau would find a stickler.
"My Son" concerns a Portuguese
youth, handsome and spoiled, who is
tempted by a rich and thoughtless girl
to lose his honor for her. How he is
saved by his mother is worth your see
ing. This play will close next Saturday
night, an undeserved short run made
necessary because "In Love with Love"
must ome from the new Duffy The
atre in Oakland to the Alcazar at this
time. "My Son" is ever so much better
than "Antonia," the last show at this
playhouse, and one that could run many
weeks.
Dorothy Dehn gives the best portrayal
we have yet seen of hers as the jazzy
flapper who threatens to break up a
Portuguese home. Alice Buchanan has
a rather small role, but makes it stand
out. Louis D'Arclay, as a faithful lover
of the mother, is good both in comical
and tragical moments.
Miss Winslow, as the mother, gets
major laurels, however. Mr. Duffy has
a fine actress in her, and we hope he
will give her other roles as forceful as
this one.
You gather, we hope, that this drama
of a seacoast town on Cape Cod, Massa
chusetts, is a tear-drawer of the first
rank. And you won't be sorry if you
go to see it.
Other Plays
At the Geary Theatre "The Royal
Family" is in its fifth and last week. It
is the cleverest comedy so far produced
in the city this season. "Good News" is
settled at the Curran for a good long
run. Of course, you want to see the

Varsity Drag in its original setting—if
you haven't already.
"Daddies" at the President is an ex
ample of Henry Duffy at his best in the
comedy line. Robert McWade is fun
nier than ever as the crabby bachelor
who is forced to adopt a war orphan.
The New Capitol is presenting "Kongo"
to be reviewed tomorrow.

Daisy and Daphne. By Rose Macauley.
(New York: Boni & Liveright, l l J28.)
Rose Macauley takes a favorite theme
of modern novels, that of psychological
complexes—lately used to the point of
staleness—and deals with it in such a
fashion that the book seems entirely
fresh. Daisy and Daplinc has few dull
pages, a fact which alone would set it
apart from most of the novels of the
same type.
It is the story of a modern girl of
ordinary good looks and more than ordi
nary intelligence, a combination which
has the inevitable effect of giving her an
inferiority complex. Throughout the
book, she has this to fight. When she
succeeds in rising above it, she is Daphne,
a charming and poised girl of 25, of a
cultured family. But when it has the
upper hand, she is only Daisy, a common
place, timid, rather weak girl of 30,
whose mother is impossibly "low brow."
There is real tragedy in the girl's life,
because even when she appears as Daphne
to the world, she knows that underneath
that skillful posing she is nothing but
Daisy after all. No matter how attrac
tive and aristocratic Daphne seems, she
can never wholly escape from that other
unwilling self.
Tfy story leaves one depressed because
life is not kind to this girl, and she is
not brave enough to face it honestly.
Had she had more courage she might not
have suffered so much. As it is, the
"front" that she tries so hard to keep
up to the world, and especially to the
Folyote family, serene in their snobbish
superficiality, falls to pieces and leaves
her futile little pretenses and lies bru
tally exposed.
The best character in the book is her
merry, fat, vulgar mother, who gets un
bounded pleasure out of simply living.
Because of her the book has warmth and
humor, a touch which relieves its rather
uncomfortable irony.

a charming and poised girl of 25, of a
cultured family. But when it has the
upper hand, she is only Daisy, a common
place, timid, rather weak girl of 30,
whose mother is impossibly "low brow."
There is real tragedy in the girl's life,
because even when she appears as Daphne
to the world, she knows that underneath
that skillful posing she is nothing but
Daisy after all. No matter how attrac
tive and aristocratic Daphne seems, she
can never wholly escape from that other
unwilling self.
Tfy story leaves one depressed because
life is not kind to this girl, and she is
not brave enough to face it honestly.
Had she had more courage she might not
have suffered so much. As it is, the
"front" that she tries so hard to keep
up to the world, and especially to the
Folyote family, serene in their snobbish
superficiality, falls to pieces and leaves
her futile little pretenses and lies bru
tally exposed.
The best character in the book is her
merry, fat, vulgar mother, who gets un
bounded pleasure out of simply living.
Because of her the book has warmth and
humor, a touch which relieves its rather
uncomfortable irony.
—Mary Lee Richmond
"My Son" —Alcazar.
Henry Duffy proves that he can pre
sent a deeply emotional play as well as
lie can light comedies. His current at
traction at the Alcazar is a powerful
drama of mother-love, engrossing, hu
man, and excellently acted.
Leah Winslow stepped into the lead
ing role, that of Anna Silva, the Portu
guese mother, when Marjorie Rambeau
had to leave to recuperate from a severe
cold. And personally, Miss Winslow is a
lot more to our liking than the more
noted actress who was originally slated
for the part.
In the capable characterization of Miss
Winslow there is nothing more to be
desired. She makes one believe, sympa
thize, laugh, and suffer with the mother.
She makes, her real—and that is a feat
Miss Rambeau would find a stickler.
"My Son" concerns a Portuguese
youth, handsome and spoiled, who is
tempted by a rich and thoughtless girl
to lose his honor for her. How he is
saved by his mother is worth your see
ing. This play will close next Saturday
night, an undeserved short run made
necessary because "In Love with Love"
must ome from the new Duffy The
atre in Oakland to the Alcazar at this
time. "My Son" is ever so much better
than "Antonia," the last show at this
playhouse, and one that could run many
weeks.
Dorothy Dehn gives the best portrayal
we have yet seen of hers as the jazzy
flapper who threatens to break up a
Portuguese home. Alice Buchanan has
a rather small role, but makes it stand
out. Louis D'Arclay, as a faithful lover
of the mother, is good both in comical
and tragical moments.
Miss Winslow, as the mother, gets
major laurels, however. Mr. Duffy has
a fine actress in her, and we hope he
will give her other roles as forceful as
this one.
You gather, we hope, that this drama
of a seacoast town on Cape Cod, Massa
chusetts, is a tear-drawer of the first
rank. And you won't be sorry if you
go to see it.
Other Plays
At the Geary Theatre "The Royal
Family" is in its fifth and last week. It
is the cleverest comedy so far produced
in the city this season. "Good News" is
settled at the Curran for a good long
run. Of course, you want to see the

Varsity Drag in its original setting—if
you haven't already.
"Daddies" at the President is an ex
ample of Henry Duffy at his best in the
comedy line. Robert McWade is fun
nier than ever as the crabby bachelor
who is forced to adopt a war orphan.
The New Capitol is presenting "Kongo"
to be reviewed tomorrow.

Daisy and Daphne. By Rose Macauley.
(New York: Boni & Liveright, l l J28.)
Rose Macauley takes a favorite theme
of modern novels, that of psychological
complexes—lately used to the point of
staleness—and deals with it in such a
fashion that the book seems entirely
fresh. Daisy and Daplinc has few dull
pages, a fact which alone would set it
apart from most of the novels of the
same type.
It is the story of a modern girl of
ordinary good looks and more than ordi
nary intelligence, a combination which
has the inevitable effect of giving her an
inferiority complex. Throughout the
book, she has this to fight. When she
succeeds in rising above it, she is Daphne,
a charming and poised girl of 25, of a
cultured family. But when it has the
upper hand, she is only Daisy, a common
place, timid, rather weak girl of 30,

in the city this season. "Good News" is
settled at the Curran for a good long
run. Of course, you want to see the

Varsity Drag in its original setting—if
you haven't already.
"Daddies" at the President is an ex
ample of Henry Duffy at his best in the
comedy line. Robert McWade is fun
nier than ever as the crabby bachelor
who is forced to adopt a war orphan.
The New Capitol is presenting "Kongo"
to be reviewed tomorrow.

Daisy and Daphne. By Rose Macauley.
(New York: Boni & Liveright, l l J28.)
Rose Macauley takes a favorite theme
of modern novels, that of psychological
complexes—lately used to the point of
staleness—and deals with it in such a
fashion that the book seems entirely
fresh. Daisy and Daplinc has few dull
pages, a fact which alone would set it
apart from most of the novels of the
same type.
It is the story of a modern girl of
ordinary good looks and more than ordi
nary intelligence, a combination which
has the inevitable effect of giving her an
inferiority complex. Throughout the
book, she has this to fight. When she
succeeds in rising above it, she is Daphne,
a charming and poised girl of 25, of a
cultured family. But when it has the
upper hand, she is only Daisy, a common
place, timid, rather weak girl of 30,
whose mother is impossibly "low brow."
There is real tragedy in the girl's life,
because even when she appears as Daphne
to the world, she knows that underneath
that skillful posing she is nothing but
Daisy after all. No matter how attrac
tive and aristocratic Daphne seems, she
can never wholly escape from that other
unwilling self.
Tfy story leaves one depressed because
life is not kind to this girl, and she is
not brave enough to face it honestly.
Had she had more courage she might not
have suffered so much. As it is, the
"front" that she tries so hard to keep
up to the world, and especially to the
Folyote family, serene in their snobbish
superficiality, falls to pieces and leaves
her futile little pretenses and lies bru
tally exposed.
The best character in the book is her
merry, fat, vulgar mother, who gets un
bounded pleasure out of simply living.
Because of her the book has warmth and
humor, a touch which relieves its rather
uncomfortable irony.
—Mary Lee Richmond
"My Son" —Alcazar.
Henry Duffy proves that he can pre
sent a deeply emotional play as well as
lie can light comedies. His current at
traction at the Alcazar is a powerful
drama of mother-love, engrossing, hu
man, and excellently acted.
Leah Winslow stepped into the lead
ing role, that of Anna Silva, the Portu
guese mother, when Marjorie Rambeau
had to leave to recuperate from a severe
cold. And personally, Miss Winslow is a
lot more to our liking than the more
noted actress who was originally slated
for the part.
In the capable characterization of Miss
Winslow there is nothing more to be
desired. She makes one believe, sympa
thize, laugh, and suffer with the mother.
She makes, her real—and that is a feat
Miss Rambeau would find a stickler.
"My Son" concerns a Portuguese
youth, handsome and spoiled, who is
tempted by a rich and thoughtless girl
to lose his honor for her. How he is
saved by his mother is worth your see
ing. This play will close next Saturday
night, an undeserved short run made
necessary because "In Love with Love"
must ome from the new Duffy The
atre in Oakland to the Alcazar at this
time. "My Son" is ever so much better
than "Antonia," the last show at this
playhouse, and one that could run many
weeks.
Dorothy Dehn gives the best portrayal
we have yet seen of hers as the jazzy
flapper who threatens to break up a
Portuguese home. Alice Buchanan has
a rather small role, but makes it stand
out. Louis D'Arclay, as a faithful lover
of the mother, is good both in comical
and tragical moments.
Miss Winslow, as the mother, gets
major laurels, however. Mr. Duffy has
a fine actress in her, and we hope he
will give her other roles as forceful as
this one.
You gather, we hope, that this drama
of a seacoast town on Cape Cod, Massa
chusetts, is a tear-drawer of the first
rank. And you won't be sorry if you
go to see it.
