I The Editor, Sir:
As one leaves Menlo Park, driving on
the main highway toward San Francisco,
he enters a grove of trees. It is a very
pretty place with towering eucalyptus
trees embowering it, and making it a
sylvan avenue.
But suddenly in the midst of that
delightful park, the flashing red light of
a "go slow" sign advises the driver to
be wary not only of collisions but also
of speed cops.
Across the road is painted in great
white letters the command "SLOW." On
each side of the road are tin signs ad
vising the public that the speed limit is
fifteen miles an hour, and beneath the
expensive automatic Hashing sign is a
speed cop who is ever ready to dash out
and pounce on the speeder.
The first time you passed the inter
section you asked, "from what metropo
lis does this road come?" But you soon
notice that traffic seldom comes out of
that road called Atherton Avenue, which
docs not come from anywhere or go any
place. On exploring the road, you dis
cover a few fine residences and as a high
way, it is almost a blind alley. Yet more
signs, signals, and cops arc there than
at any other intersection in this country.
Cars are seldom seen to emerge from
the avenue; you occasionally see delivery
trucks or foreign made limousines conic
out. But there is no cause to waste signs
on that intersection when they could
much more humanely be used in front of
some school.
Besides, it takes long enough to go to
San Francisco without cutting an already
retarded speed.

The Editor, Sir:
The high tone and general precision
of the articles on the present political
campaign is indeed heartening. However,
some of the general terminology might
be explained for the benefit of at least
one devoted reader.
Commencing with Mr. Sexson's pro
duction (which was the one I read) the
following items need clarifying:
1. What is this "human touch" of
Hoover's which makes him superior to
Smith? Is it somewhat of the same na
ture as the celebrated "it" ?
2. How does the fact that Raskob
made several hundred millions in specu
lation prove the present administration
has been a good one?
3. Will not the type of training and
knowledge of international affairs neces
sary to the President be somewhat a dif
ferent thing from that of a free lance,
unhampered by a partisan senate, or an
imperialistic leaning in previous Repub
lican foreign policies—and after Wilson's
attempt with the League and the glori
fied Y.M.C.A. meetings indulged in by
his followers in office, isn't it true that a

knowledge of when and where to send
marines constitutes the necessary stock
in trade of a United States President?
I realize that light ordinarily gives off
heat, and that probably any confusion in
the fiery phrases of the writer in ques
j tion was due to the warmth of his argu
j ment .... in fact, 1 think the wind of
j freedom which blew that day was far
j from being a cold or chilling one. How
! ever, let us have some more illumination
—smoke, heat, and all—after all candles
did come before elcctric lights.

The Editor, Sir:
Do you believe in reincarnation?
j No? But surely you have heard of the
j late Czar of Russia, haven't you? And
j you have also heard of the far-famed \
Stanford Board of Athletic Control, j
haven't you? Do you follow me? Oh,
you are a step ahead of me! Well,
then, 'nuff said!
To be more specific, take my own
case just as an example. I am a late
registering student by reason of finan
cial pressure. I got back on the cam
pus Tuesday, Oct. 16. I expected that
any day thereafter there would be a
notice of the sale of Rooters' tickets
for the U.S.C. game. For I realize as
v/ell as do others that a certain j
amount of time must be allowed for
distribution of tickets. I waited until
finally I was worried for fear that
the sale had been held sometime dur
ing the Summer Quarter. So I in
quired about it then. And sure enough, j
I learned that the sale had been held i
within the first five days of school.
Also I later learned that there had i
been a semi-secret sale continuing at
the Board's offices until sometime
last week. But by the time I heard
of this it was too late. So here I am
with a Student Body Card supposedly
entitling mo to the "privileges" of a
student, but nothing to do with it.
And why? Simply because of the in
sistence of the Board in selling 1
Rooters' tickets so far in advance of j
the game. Perhaps the facts of my !
case are exceptional, and I will admit
that the Board cannot be expected to j
cope with each individual situation. j
But because of my plight 1 am forced
to the point of expressing my opinion j
of the Czaristic formulae. Every stu j
dent knows of some other instance!
than the one I have cited. Perhaps
others have more reason for dissatis
faction than I have. But the fact re
mains that, in spite of a lot of gram- j
bling and talking In a hushed tone
to one's friends, the Board, the Great I

Board, continues on its own self-cen
' t.ered way. And my one regret is that
\so far as I can see they bid fair to
continue in just the same manner.
They hold tho whip and see lit to use
i it. "Those are the rules, and I refuse
| to argue about it." In other words,
"What arc you going to do about It.?"
) And I am forced to admit that I can
do nothing about it except write this
opinion and then hope against hope
that some day the Grctt. Board will
see the light.

notice that traffic seldom comes out of

cover a few fine residences and as a high

The Editor, Sir:
The high tone and general precision
of the articles on the present political
campaign is indeed heartening. However,
some of the general terminology might
be explained for the benefit of at least
one devoted reader.
Commencing with Mr. Sexson's pro
duction (which was the one I read) the
following items need clarifying:
1. What is this "human touch" of
Hoover's which makes him superior to
Smith? Is it somewhat of the same na
ture as the celebrated "it" ?
2. How does the fact that Raskob
made several hundred millions in specu
lation prove the present administration
has been a good one?
3. Will not the type of training and
knowledge of international affairs neces
sary to the President be somewhat a dif
ferent thing from that of a free lance,
unhampered by a partisan senate, or an
imperialistic leaning in previous Repub
lican foreign policies—and after Wilson's
attempt with the League and the glori
fied Y.M.C.A. meetings indulged in by
his followers in office, isn't it true that a

knowledge of when and where to send
marines constitutes the necessary stock
in trade of a United States President?
I realize that light ordinarily gives off
heat, and that probably any confusion in
the fiery phrases of the writer in ques
j tion was due to the warmth of his argu
j ment .... in fact, 1 think the wind of
j freedom which blew that day was far
j from being a cold or chilling one. How

The Editor, Sir:
Do you believe in reincarnation?
j No? But surely you have heard of the
j late Czar of Russia, haven't you? And
j you have also heard of the far-famed \
Stanford Board of Athletic Control, j
haven't you? Do you follow me? Oh,
you are a step ahead of me! Well,
then, 'nuff said!
To be more specific, take my own
case just as an example. I am a late
registering student by reason of finan
cial pressure. I got back on the cam
pus Tuesday, Oct. 16. I expected that
any day thereafter there would be a
notice of the sale of Rooters' tickets
for the U.S.C. game. For I realize as
v/ell as do others that a certain j
amount of time must be allowed for
distribution of tickets. I waited until
finally I was worried for fear that
the sale had been held sometime dur
ing the Summer Quarter. So I in
quired about it then. And sure enough, j
I learned that the sale had been held i
within the first five days of school.
Also I later learned that there had i
been a semi-secret sale continuing at
the Board's offices until sometime
last week. But by the time I heard
of this it was too late. So here I am
with a Student Body Card supposedly
entitling mo to the "privileges" of a
student, but nothing to do with it.
And why? Simply because of the in
sistence of the Board in selling 1
Rooters' tickets so far in advance of j
the game. Perhaps the facts of my !
case are exceptional, and I will admit
that the Board cannot be expected to j
cope with each individual situation. j
But because of my plight 1 am forced
to the point of expressing my opinion j
of the Czaristic formulae. Every stu j
dent knows of some other instance!
than the one I have cited. Perhaps
others have more reason for dissatis
faction than I have. But the fact re
mains that, in spite of a lot of gram- j
bling and talking In a hushed tone
to one's friends, the Board, the Great I

Board, continues on its own self-cen
' t.ered way. And my one regret is that
\so far as I can see they bid fair to
continue in just the same manner.
They hold tho whip and see lit to use
i it. "Those are the rules, and I refuse

"What arc you going to do about It.?"

The high tone and general precision
of the articles on the present political
campaign is indeed heartening. However,
some of the general terminology might
be explained for the benefit of at least
one devoted reader.
Commencing with Mr. Sexson's pro
duction (which was the one I read) the
following items need clarifying:
1. What is this "human touch" of
Hoover's which makes him superior to
Smith? Is it somewhat of the same na
ture as the celebrated "it" ?
2. How does the fact that Raskob
made several hundred millions in specu
lation prove the present administration
has been a good one?
3. Will not the type of training and
knowledge of international affairs neces
sary to the President be somewhat a dif
ferent thing from that of a free lance,
unhampered by a partisan senate, or an
imperialistic leaning in previous Repub
lican foreign policies—and after Wilson's
attempt with the League and the glori
fied Y.M.C.A. meetings indulged in by
his followers in office, isn't it true that a

knowledge of when and where to send
marines constitutes the necessary stock
in trade of a United States President?
I realize that light ordinarily gives off
heat, and that probably any confusion in
the fiery phrases of the writer in ques
j tion was due to the warmth of his argu
j ment .... in fact, 1 think the wind of
j freedom which blew that day was far
j from being a cold or chilling one. How
! ever, let us have some more illumination

The Editor, Sir:
Do you believe in reincarnation?
j No? But surely you have heard of the
j late Czar of Russia, haven't you? And
j you have also heard of the far-famed \
Stanford Board of Athletic Control, j
haven't you? Do you follow me? Oh,
you are a step ahead of me! Well,
then, 'nuff said!
To be more specific, take my own
case just as an example. I am a late
registering student by reason of finan
cial pressure. I got back on the cam
pus Tuesday, Oct. 16. I expected that
any day thereafter there would be a
notice of the sale of Rooters' tickets
for the U.S.C. game. For I realize as
v/ell as do others that a certain j
amount of time must be allowed for
distribution of tickets. I waited until
finally I was worried for fear that
the sale had been held sometime dur
ing the Summer Quarter. So I in
quired about it then. And sure enough, j
I learned that the sale had been held i
within the first five days of school.
Also I later learned that there had i
been a semi-secret sale continuing at
the Board's offices until sometime
last week. But by the time I heard
of this it was too late. So here I am
with a Student Body Card supposedly
entitling mo to the "privileges" of a
student, but nothing to do with it.
And why? Simply because of the in
sistence of the Board in selling 1
Rooters' tickets so far in advance of j
the game. Perhaps the facts of my !
case are exceptional, and I will admit
that the Board cannot be expected to j
cope with each individual situation. j
But because of my plight 1 am forced
to the point of expressing my opinion j
of the Czaristic formulae. Every stu j
dent knows of some other instance!
than the one I have cited. Perhaps
others have more reason for dissatis
faction than I have. But the fact re
mains that, in spite of a lot of gram- j
bling and talking In a hushed tone
to one's friends, the Board, the Great I

Board, continues on its own self-cen
' t.ered way. And my one regret is that
\so far as I can see they bid fair to
continue in just the same manner.
They hold tho whip and see lit to use
i it. "Those are the rules, and I refuse
| to argue about it." In other words,
"What arc you going to do about It.?"

do nothing about it except write this

As one leaves Menlo Park, driving on
the main highway toward San Francisco,
he enters a grove of trees. It is a very
pretty place with towering eucalyptus
trees embowering it, and making it a
sylvan avenue.
But suddenly in the midst of that
delightful park, the flashing red light of
a "go slow" sign advises the driver to
be wary not only of collisions but also
of speed cops.
Across the road is painted in great
white letters the command "SLOW." On
each side of the road are tin signs ad
vising the public that the speed limit is
fifteen miles an hour, and beneath the
expensive automatic Hashing sign is a
speed cop who is ever ready to dash out
and pounce on the speeder.
The first time you passed the inter
section you asked, "from what metropo
lis does this road come?" But you soon
notice that traffic seldom comes out of
that road called Atherton Avenue, which
docs not come from anywhere or go any
place. On exploring the road, you dis
cover a few fine residences and as a high
way, it is almost a blind alley. Yet more
signs, signals, and cops arc there than
at any other intersection in this country.
Cars are seldom seen to emerge from
the avenue; you occasionally see delivery

1. What is this "human touch" of
Hoover's which makes him superior to
Smith? Is it somewhat of the same na
ture as the celebrated "it" ?
2. How does the fact that Raskob
made several hundred millions in specu
lation prove the present administration
has been a good one?
3. Will not the type of training and
knowledge of international affairs neces
sary to the President be somewhat a dif
ferent thing from that of a free lance,
unhampered by a partisan senate, or an
imperialistic leaning in previous Repub
lican foreign policies—and after Wilson's
attempt with the League and the glori
fied Y.M.C.A. meetings indulged in by
his followers in office, isn't it true that a

knowledge of when and where to send
marines constitutes the necessary stock
in trade of a United States President?
I realize that light ordinarily gives off
heat, and that probably any confusion in
the fiery phrases of the writer in ques
j tion was due to the warmth of his argu
j ment .... in fact, 1 think the wind of
j freedom which blew that day was far
j from being a cold or chilling one. How
! ever, let us have some more illumination
—smoke, heat, and all—after all candles
did come before elcctric lights.
Sincerely,

The Editor, Sir:
Do you believe in reincarnation?
j No? But surely you have heard of the
j late Czar of Russia, haven't you? And
j you have also heard of the far-famed \
Stanford Board of Athletic Control, j
haven't you? Do you follow me? Oh,
you are a step ahead of me! Well,
then, 'nuff said!
To be more specific, take my own
case just as an example. I am a late
registering student by reason of finan
cial pressure. I got back on the cam
pus Tuesday, Oct. 16. I expected that
any day thereafter there would be a
notice of the sale of Rooters' tickets
for the U.S.C. game. For I realize as
v/ell as do others that a certain j
amount of time must be allowed for
distribution of tickets. I waited until
finally I was worried for fear that
the sale had been held sometime dur
ing the Summer Quarter. So I in
quired about it then. And sure enough, j
I learned that the sale had been held i
within the first five days of school.
Also I later learned that there had i
been a semi-secret sale continuing at
the Board's offices until sometime
last week. But by the time I heard
of this it was too late. So here I am
with a Student Body Card supposedly
entitling mo to the "privileges" of a
student, but nothing to do with it.
And why? Simply because of the in
sistence of the Board in selling 1
Rooters' tickets so far in advance of j
the game. Perhaps the facts of my !
case are exceptional, and I will admit
that the Board cannot be expected to j
cope with each individual situation. j
But because of my plight 1 am forced
to the point of expressing my opinion j
of the Czaristic formulae. Every stu j
dent knows of some other instance!
than the one I have cited. Perhaps
others have more reason for dissatis
faction than I have. But the fact re
mains that, in spite of a lot of gram- j
bling and talking In a hushed tone
to one's friends, the Board, the Great I

Board, continues on its own self-cen
' t.ered way. And my one regret is that
\so far as I can see they bid fair to
continue in just the same manner.
They hold tho whip and see lit to use
i it. "Those are the rules, and I refuse
| to argue about it." In other words,
"What arc you going to do about It.?"
) And I am forced to admit that I can
do nothing about it except write this
opinion and then hope against hope
that some day the Grctt. Board will
see the light.
"Hopefully,"
