Yesterday to the game in San Fran
cisco, where the weather was most foule.
Did find the first half most exciting, but
through the last did amuse myself by
watching a man called by his zaney,
Howard Jones. He was accompanied by
some twelve men, each of whom busied
themselves with following an individual
of the Stanford team and writing in little
books each move on the field. Whereat
I was much amused, and do hope they
recorded even the sneezes. Remarked so
to my companion, and he did tell me of
a certain football coach who sent a dozen
corsages of roses to young ladies and
did give them seats near the field, where
upon the opponents were completely de
moralized, for their captain did suffer
mightily from rose fever, and could only
sneeze instead of signal.
To the Mark Hopkins of the evening,
and was much alarmed at the conduct of
the guests, which 1 was told was much
like a Big Game night, what with songs,
and such. My young beau did jump most
exceedingly for the monkeys that dan
gled, but albeit he was somewhat shorter
than the rest, did only succeed in tread
ing on the ruffle of my new velvet gown.
So did tell him he could buy a similar
toy with infinitely less energy at any
market and he did seem a little wroth
with me. But, lud! Ido not care a whit
for such games when I am wearing my
best frock.
October 22
This morning to the post office where
I did set up a mighty clamoring and
banging at the window for some time. A
young man did finally come and get my
package, sent by post. Did come away
resolved that if someday I am rich
enough and old enough to endow this
University, I will first buy them gifts cf
bell cords, or chimes for the post office
windows.
So to looking forward to the Women's
Conference party, particularly as I un
derstand threat over the heads of soro
rity houses if they rush too much, and
dancing may be done away with. Which
I should not deplore greatly, for do no
tice women leading are either too good
to follow, or too bad to lead —Do find
myself much amused at this business for
it has a language all its own, and laws
too. Did write my aunt in their quaint
dialect that certain girls were "legacies,"
and she did reply querying if a "legacy"
were an asset or limited liability. Seems
a queer game, however, but do not sup
pose it makes much difference in the
hereafter whether a soul is stamped with
one Greek letter or branded with an
other set.

moralized, for their captain did suffer
mightily from rose fever, and could only
sneeze instead of signal.
To the Mark Hopkins of the evening,
and was much alarmed at the conduct of
the guests, which 1 was told was much
like a Big Game night, what with songs,
and such. My young beau did jump most
exceedingly for the monkeys that dan
gled, but albeit he was somewhat shorter
than the rest, did only succeed in tread
ing on the ruffle of my new velvet gown.
So did tell him he could buy a similar
toy with infinitely less energy at any
market and he did seem a little wroth
with me. But, lud! Ido not care a whit
for such games when I am wearing my
best frock.

This morning to the post office where
I did set up a mighty clamoring and
banging at the window for some time. A
young man did finally come and get my
package, sent by post. Did come away
resolved that if someday I am rich
enough and old enough to endow this
University, I will first buy them gifts cf
bell cords, or chimes for the post office
windows.
So to looking forward to the Women's
Conference party, particularly as I un
derstand threat over the heads of soro
rity houses if they rush too much, and
dancing may be done away with. Which
I should not deplore greatly, for do no
tice women leading are either too good
to follow, or too bad to lead —Do find
myself much amused at this business for
it has a language all its own, and laws
too. Did write my aunt in their quaint
dialect that certain girls were "legacies,"
and she did reply querying if a "legacy"
were an asset or limited liability. Seems
a queer game, however, but do not sup
pose it makes much difference in the
hereafter whether a soul is stamped with
one Greek letter or branded with an
other set.

Yesterday to the game in San Fran
cisco, where the weather was most foule.
Did find the first half most exciting, but
through the last did amuse myself by
watching a man called by his zaney,
Howard Jones. He was accompanied by
some twelve men, each of whom busied
themselves with following an individual
of the Stanford team and writing in little
books each move on the field. Whereat
I was much amused, and do hope they
recorded even the sneezes. Remarked so
to my companion, and he did tell me of
a certain football coach who sent a dozen
corsages of roses to young ladies and
did give them seats near the field, where
upon the opponents were completely de
moralized, for their captain did suffer
mightily from rose fever, and could only
sneeze instead of signal.
