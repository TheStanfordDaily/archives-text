"Simkins is playing for Hoffman in
the position that Hoffman usually
plays."
"Three of the Idaho men, dressed
like Eskimos, are carrying one man
off the field. Apparently the lad is
hurt."
MR. PHILIP SPACE, Sir:
1 was looking over a college paper
and had just finished clipping a bunch
of brodies for this column. Imagine
my embarrassment when a friend
pointed out that it was the Stanford
Daily.

New York, Oct. 17. (/P) â€”Mrs. Lottie
May Schoemmel rested for a moment
in her non-stop float in a hotel swim
ming pool here today to grant a
strange interview in which she con
fided that she hoped to remain up as
long as the Graf Zeppelin.
At least, she won't break a fin.
