# BABE GRID TEAM IS GROOMED FOR ALL-STAR BATTLE
## Rintala Expected to Return To Practice in Time for Contest Saturday 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
With the report yesterday that
Rudy Rinlala, speedy freshman back,
tnough still on the injured list will
probably be in condition to play here
next Saturday against the Southern
Ail-Stars, prospects for a win for the
Stanford freshmen are brighter. Rin
tala is a consistent ground-gainer and
has had more than his share in the
freshman victories this year.
The Southern All-Star eleven is an
aggregation of former high school
gridders who are now taking post
graduate work in preparation for en
trance into college, yet nothing
definite is known about the team ex
cept that its members were all out
standing high school players.
"Husky" Hunt and "Rabbit" Brad
show put the freshmen through a
light workout yesterday, most of the
time being spent in running off plays
and perfecting a passing attack. The
Cards' aerial offensive was not overly
effective against St. Mary's, several
passes being intercepted and a num
ber of others grounded.
The smooth teamwork which has
been so much in evidence in the first
four freshman games was ragged in
places Saturday, the line not charg
ing quite as well as previously and
the timing of some of the revedses
and lateral pass plays being a trifle
off.
Ebey and Hunt, substituing at the
guard positions aginst St. Mary's,
looked good; and Toepke and Brooks
v/ill have to fight to keep their berths
on the first string.
