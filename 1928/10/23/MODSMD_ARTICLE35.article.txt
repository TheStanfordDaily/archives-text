# SPORTS OF 1928
## The 						Iowa Thunderbolt 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
There was some doubt in the minds
of Midwestern football critics as to
just how much of a football player
this big Cherokee Indian, Mayes Mc-
Lain, really was until he appeared in
his first Conference game as an lowa
halfback against Chicago. So much
publicity had made the experts suspi
cious of the 200-pound Indian, who,
as a member of the Haskell team two
years ago, had scored more than 250
points against such opposition as
Drury, Wichita, Still College, Morning
side, and Jackson, which, of course,
is no opposition at all.
At any rate, Mayes McLain proved,
on October 13, that he is a real ball
carrier, whether he had scored 25 or
2500 points two years ago, and he also
helped Coach Burt Ingwersen serve

notice on the rest of the "Big Ten"
that lowa is in line for a Conference
championship. For Mayes McLain
was Ingwerson's big gun in the Black
and Gold's 13 to 0 defeat of "Old
Man" Stagg's Maroons.
McLain showed plenty of speed and
power, football sense, and a good
kicking toe, and, beginning on Octo
ber 27, he will have plenty of chances
to get exercise against real competi
tion, for lowa meets Minnesota, South
Dakota, Ohio State, "Wisconsin, and
Michigan on successive Saturdays.
The Hawkeyes, with McLain and
Glasgow in action together, remind
old-timers of the teams of Gordon
Locke and Aubrey Devine that burned
up the gridirons of the Middlewest
and defeated Yale as well around
1920-'2l.
