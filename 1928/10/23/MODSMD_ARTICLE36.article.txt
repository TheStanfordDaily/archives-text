# HOOVER ATTACKS DEMOCRATS FOR BUSINESS PLANS
## Republican Candidate Scores State Socialism in New York Address 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 22. (#>) â€”Bringing
his Eastern campaign to a climax in
the home city of his Democratic op
i ponent, Herbert Hoover tonight told
a throng in Madison Square Garden
that a series of proposals had been ad
vanced into the campaign which
| would be a long step toward overturn
j ing the principles of government upon
I which the nation had grown great.
Referring specifically to prohibition,
i farm relief, and electrical power, the
Republican presidential candidate as
serted that because the country "is
i taced with difficulty and doubt" on
i these problems "our opponents pro
pose that we must thrust government
i a long way into the businesses which
| give rise to these problems.
Democrats Turn to Socialism
"In effect, they abandon the tenets
of their own party and turn to state
Socialism as a solution for the diffi
i culties presented by all three," he
j said. "It is proposed that we shall
| change from prohibition to the state
purchase and sale of liquor. If their
agricultural program means
| anything, it means that the govern
ment shall directly or indirectly buy
! and sell and fix prices of agricultural
products. And we are to go into the
hydro-electric power business. In
! ctlier words, we are confronted with
a huge program of government in
business."
Opposing this program in vigorous
language, Hoover declared that "even
if governmental conduct of business
could give us more efficiency instead
j of less efficiency, the fundamental ob
jection to it would remain unaltered
and unabated."
Opposes Government Business
"It would destroy political equality,"
ihe said. "It would increase rather
than decrease abuse and corruption.
It would stifle initiative and invention.
It would undermine the development
|of leadership. It would cramp and
I cripple the mental and spiritual ener
gies of our people. It would extin
guish equality and opportunity. It
would dry up the spirit of liberty and
progress.
I "For these reasons primarily it
i must be resisted. For a hundred and
fifty years Liberalism has found its
true spirits in the American system,
not in the European systems."
