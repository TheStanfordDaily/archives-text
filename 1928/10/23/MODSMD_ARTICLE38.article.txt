# YEARLING SOCCER SQUAD TO MEET SAN MATEO J. C.
## 
### 
The freshman soccer team will |
have its first competition of the sea- j
son this afternoon at 4:15 o'clock,
when it meets the San Mateo Junior
College on the varsity field. A game j
with the Pescadero High School was
scheduled for last week, but it was |
postponed because most of their team
was sick with influenza.
The frosh have been practicing j
three times a week for the last three '
weeks, and have thus far only had 1
games with the varsity squad. Coach I
Harry Maloney has been coaching j
them intensively on the fundamentals |
of the game, such as passing with ac
curacy, kicking, dribbling, and head
stopping.
According to Maloney the 1932 team I
has shown much improvement in the
last practices, and he believes that it
will give the Junior College team
some real competition today.
