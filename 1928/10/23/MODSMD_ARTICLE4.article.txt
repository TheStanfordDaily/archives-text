ly eradicated women's blush?
Evidence to the contrary was
discovered on the campus early
yesterday morning. When the
girls of the sorority
house looked across their lawn
yesterday morning they were as
tonished at the scene that met
their eyes. Something was amiss
here! A line of long woolen
thing-a-ma-jigs, which were prom
inently displayed there, caught
and held the attention of amused
passersby.
When the jibes of the assem
bling crowd became unbearable,
one of the sisters stepped out on
the porch, gritted her teeth, and
proceed to remove the offending
articles from the public gaze
amid cheers and applause.
Let it be known to the credit
of fem;ile modesty, that although
she maintained perfect poise, her
complexion for tho moment be
came scarlet.
