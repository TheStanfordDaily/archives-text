The Coast Conference Marathon is ;
only past the third milestone with six j
more to go, yet at this early stage all
but three teams—California, Stanford,
and Southern California —are practi
cally eliminated from the running. Of
these three, the Cardinals appear the
favorites to win the coveted cham
pionship.
The result of the scoreless game
between the Bears and Trojans at.
Berkeley Saturday is of primary im
portance to Stanford, as the Warner |
team meets both U.S.C. and California j
within the next few weeks and will ;
battle it out with them for the title.
A tie places California and Southern
California on even terms as far as
Conference rating is concerned, but
in spite of the game's result, the Tro
jans proved themselves a superior
outfit even on the sloppy field which
checked their offensive strength.
Stanford is strong enough to beat |
California, which it will do unless the j
Warner machine is destroyed before
then. The only doubtful contest re
maining on the Stanford conference
schedule is that with Southern Cali
fornia.

Washington's trouncing Saturday at
the hands of Oregon (whom the Cards
defeated 26-12 two weeks ago) lets
the Huskies out of consideration as
a possible contender. Stanford's vic
tories over Idaho and Oregon remove
both of these competitors from the
i ace.
Stanford and Southern California
will each have a light workout next
Saturday, the Cards meeting Fresno
State and the Trojans taking on Occi
dental. The following week, when
Warner and Jones match wits, men,
and maneuvers, the Conference cham
pionship will be decided.
