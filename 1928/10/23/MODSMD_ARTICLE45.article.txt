# FRATERNITY WILL AWARD STUDENTS CHEMISTRY PRIZES
## 
### 
In order to promote interest in
chemistry among beginning students,
who number 260 this year, and to give
appropriate recognition to high schol
arship in the subject, the local chapter
of Phi Lambda Upsilon, national hon
orary chemistry fraternity, is offering
annually a prize to the Stanford stu
dent who makes the most creditable
record in Chemistry 1, 2, and 3, or
10, 11, and 12.
The winning student will receive a
medal, which is to be shown to the
classes in chemistry Wednesday and
Thursday, and also will have his name
engraved upon a silver cup. This cup,
with the names of the winners for the
successive years is to remain on dis
play in the Chemistry building.
A committee consisting of the head
of the Chemistry department, two
members of the department faculty,
and the president of Phi Lambda Up
silon will make the awards annually
in May. In the selection of the win
ner, the committee may give consider
ation not only to the scholarship rec
ord as indicated by the grades re

ceived, but to the qualities of initia- :
live, interest, and industry shown by
the student in his work.
In a letter to Professor Swain, Dr. |
Wilbur expressed his appreciation of i
the award, saying it was the only one j
of its kind at Stanford. I
