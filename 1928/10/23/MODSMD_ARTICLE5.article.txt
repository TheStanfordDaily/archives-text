# Complacent Audience Gives Tibbett Largest Ovation In "Falstaff"
## 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
Lawrence Tibbett, who will open
the Stanford Concert Series on Fri
day night when ho sings when he
sings at the Pavilion, was accorded
the largest ovation of any singer of
the Metropolitan Opera House in New
York when he appeared in "Falstaff"
in 1923.
The California baritone had sung
many small roles, but it was not until
the revical of Verdi's musical version
of the adventures of Shakespeare's
Prince Hal and Falstaff, in which
Tibbett played the part of Ford, that
he had his first large part.
Audience Complacent
"Falstaff" had not been given in
New York for fifteen years, and it
was a complacent audience that
greeted the curtain on the first act.
Ford's monologue comes at the be
ginning of the second act, and calls
for great dramatic contrasts in voice
color and a constant change of mood.
The monologue expresses a husband's
doubt of the faithfulness of his wife,
his devotion and fear.
The usual New York audience sud
denly realized that there was some
thing phenomenal before them. Tib
bett's powerful voice rang through
the house, and the critical audience
was hushed.

Applause broke out spontaneously
from all sides following the song, but
the conductor would allow little inter
ruption. At the end of the act tumults
of applause filled the air for fifteen
long minutes. It was a success that
had never been seen before and one
that had never been achieved since.
In ten minutes of song a young un
known singer had reached the pin
nacle of success. The headlines next
morning greeted him as the "All-
American Opera Singer."
This is the second year Tibbett has
been on the concert stage. Tickets
for the concert Friday night are on
sale now in the Old Union, and those
students who have purchased their
season tickets are asked to call for
tnem from 1 to 5 o'clock any day this
week in the Union.
