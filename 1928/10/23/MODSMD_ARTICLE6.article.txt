# JUNIORS SURPRISE '29 GRID TEAM IN SCORELESS GAME
## 
### DON OSWILL 
A strong junior team, previously j
j not conceded even an outside chance,
yesterday played the seniors to a
! standstill in the second interclass
football game and received but a tie
for their efforts. Twice the third-year
men- took the ball to within the
shadows of the senior goal line and
just missed scoring. The final score
was 0-0.
In the last quarter Simatavich and j
Northrup carried the oval to the
senior five-yard line and then lost it
with a disastrous fumble. Then, tak
j ing the return punt on the forty-yard
' mark, they again bucked it up the
field, only to be halted at the goal by j
the final gun.
Under the tutelage of Casey Kazan- !
jian, the juniors pulled some plays
that would have done any coach jus
tice. They opened the final period
with a series of reverses, double re
verses, and a lateral pass. Their op
ponents played good defensive foot-j
ball, but they could not cope with the j
| fast plays of '30.
I During the first quarter, the versa- i
tile work of Fox, senior fullback, kept I
| the game fairly even, while Brown, j
who has been on the team four years,
also played a good brand of football. I
The straight off-tackle thrusts of the
senior outfit were too often stopped
by their opponents, and the two
rnsses completed did not make
enough yardage to be decisive.
From the class of football played
yesterday, the third-year men should
rcmp off with the interclass cham
pionship. Two of their best men were
J declared ineligible just a few minutes
before the contest because of a gym
| Mass complication. They will be al
j lowed to participate in the next game. I
