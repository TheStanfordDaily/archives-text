Discussing his conviction that
psychology is the greatest power at
work in Russia, President Tully C.
Knoles of the College of the Pacific
will lecture in the Assembly Hall at
7:30 o'clock tonight on "The Psych
ology of the Bolshevik."
"When I went into Russia 1 believed
that the Bolsheviks held their power
through physical force. But 1 came
away convinced that Russia domi
nates her people by psychological
means," says President Knoles.
In his lecture Knoles will point out
the psychological mediums through
which the Russians are dominated,
and will discuss the part played in
Russia by her soldiers.
Speaking of the soldiers in Russia,
Knoles declares, "You can see the
Red army of Russia, but it is a very
unmilitary looking army. You do not
see soldiers marching or parading.
Some of this Red army sing folk
songs and occupy much of their time
in other than purely military activi
ties."
Of the religious aspect in Russia,
Knoles says, "The vice-president of
Russia said that the Bolsheviks want
to see the destruction of Mohamme
danism, Judaism, and Christianity. If
you were to set one of our most rabid
American Fundamentalists among
some of the Russian Sectarians, he
would shock the Sectarians to death
by his liberalism."
