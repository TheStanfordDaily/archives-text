# ROBINSON ASKS LIBERALS VOTE FOR AL SMITH
## Hoover Called Reactionary; Curtis Termed 'King of Standpatters" by Opponent 
### 
SIOUX CITY, la., Oct. 23. (ff)â€”
Senator Joe T. Robinson called upon
the adherents to the Progressive
Party in an address tonight to vote
the Democratic national ticket this
year, because, he said, ultra-conserva
tism and reactionary influences domi
nate the Republican Party and its
standard-bearers. Robinson arraigned
Herbert Hoover as an obstructor of
progressive legislation and Senator
Curtis as "the king of the stand
patters."
"The nominees of the Republican
Party for president and vice-president,
Mr. Hoover and Senator Curtis, are
both reactionaries," the Democratic
vice-presidential nominee said. "Nei
ther has done or said anything to
justify the belief that the corrupt
.lobby will be combatted.
"The Kansas City platform, drafted
hy Senator Smoot and his associates
is the product of ultra-conservatism
and proposes the continuance of the
reactionary influences and policies
which have prevailed during the
Coolidge administration."
Curtis "Standpatter King"
No measures of reform in which
Progressives are interested can be
iioped for under an administration
lieaded by Hoover and Curtis, Senator
Robinson declared, because "Hoover
admits that he merely intends to
carry out the Coolidge policies."
"During his service in the cabinet,
Hoover has never advanced an out
standing suggestion for constructive :
action," the nominee said. "He has
been content in a cabinet of mediocres
to occupy a position of quiescence.
"The record of Senator Curtis dis
closes him to be the King of Stand
patters. While he voted three times
for the McNary-Haugen bill, he re
versed this attitude at the last minute i
and supported the President's veto,
thus accomplishing the final defeat of
the bill:
"He voted to seat Lorimer and
Newberry. He opposed the resolution
advising the President to call for the
resignation of Denby. He sought to
encompass the defeat of the Norris
resolution relative to the seating of I
Smith and the investigation of exces
sive and corrupt expenditures in pri- J
maries."
