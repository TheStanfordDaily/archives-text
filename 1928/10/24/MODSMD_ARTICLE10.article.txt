# REPAIR WORK TO CUT INTO NEW GYM FUND
## Failure of W.A.A. to Get Bill Authorized Is Reason For Decision of Ex Committee 
### 
The Executive Committee last night
voted that the bill for resurfacing the
women's hockey fields, which was
done last fall, be paid out of the
contribution of $800 that A.S.S.U.
voted toward the erection of a wo
men's gymnasium.
W.A.A. voted in the spring of 1927
to resurface the fields, and in the
tall of 1927 did so, the cost amounting
to $30G. It failed at the time to get the
authorization of the University. Last
spring the Ex Committee voted to
equal the amount which W.A.A. should
raise toward a new gymnasium to an
amount not exceeding $800. Out of
the budget of W.A.A. approximately
$000 wjiich had not been spent was
turned back to A.S.S.U. at the end of
last year when the books were closed.
Because W.A.A. had failed to get au
thorization, the bill was outstanding.
It will be paid out of the $800 for a
new gymnasium, according to the de
cision last night.
The Registration Dance next quar
ter was granted to the Stanford Liter
ary Magazine; Nelson Carter was ap
pointed to replace Bill Freeman as
Junior Baseball Manager for 1929;
and Charles Baskerville was chosen
a>3 Junior Track Manager in the place
of Louis Leiber, who did not return
to school, was included in the busi
ness of the evening.
