After hearing Comptroller A. E.

management of the Encina Commons
at a meeting of the Board of Control
last night, the Board voted to lay the
petition presented by Encina Club re
( questing meals on seven days on the
! table until the end of the quarter. A
j committee was appointed to study the
J conditions both physical and psycho
logical concerned in the running of
| the big dining hall and to co-operate
! with the management in presenting
j facts to the students eating in the
j Commons.
Food prices are on an average of
thirty per cent higher this year than
they were last, Comptroller Roth
| pointed out. The increased cost of
| food makes necessary a further raise
; of board or the closing of the Com
j mons on one day each week in order
I to reduce the cost of labor, according
i to his statement.
