# Russian Handworkers Benefit At Expense Of Peasant Says Knoles
## Marxian Theory Is Suitable For Countries Highly Industrialized 
### 
"Russian government represents
the dictatorship of the Communist
Party for the benefit of the hand
workers at the expense of the peas
ants," declared Dr. Tully C. Knoles,
president of the College of the Pacific,
in his lecture last night in the As
sembly Hall on "The Psychology of
the Bolsheviks."
"It is difficult to cure the evils of
society by a formula," he said. "All
Bolsheviks are Marxians and enemies
of capitalism, but the Marxian theory
is impracticable except in highly in
dustrialized countries. At the begin
ning of the revolution capitalism, and
with it the use of money and the prin
ciple of private property, practically
disappeared. Economic loss of apply
ing the new constitution was terrific,
and the burden fell on the peasants.
In speaking of the workers' condi
tions he said that they have greatly
improved since the revolution, for
though their wages remain about the
same, they are provided by the gov
ernment with comfortable lodging,
hospitalization, every kind of insur
ance, and an eight-hour day.
"It is the peasant," Knoles con
tinued, who now pays for all these
benefits of the government, by form
ing far the greater part of the home
industrial market. But a great power
is operating to undermine the power
of the Marxians, and to change the
rtsults of the revolution so that it
will be of more value to the peasants.
The tendency is to form a distinctly
Russian government, modelled on
Marxian principles but with an equal
ity of privileges for peasants as well
as handworkers."
"By the Red Army, a very unmili
tary organization, is being distributed
throughout Russia the seeds of future
revolt. Peasant boys recruited to the
ranks travel to the cities and see for
themselves the difference in the lives
of the peasants and the handworkers.
They will not remain satisfied."
