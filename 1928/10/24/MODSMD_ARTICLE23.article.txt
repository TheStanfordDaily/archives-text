# WARNER DRILLS SQUAD AGAINST U.S.C. OFFENSE
## Scrimmage Held in Secret As Team Prepares for Clash With Troy November 3 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
The Cardinal varsity scrimmaged
until after dark yesterday behind
closed gates in the second practice
session preparing for one of Stan
ford's toughest encounters of the sea
son—that with Coach Howard Jones'
Thundering Herd in Los Angeles on
November 3.
Fresno State, playing here next
Saturday, can be handled with
straight power alone, so Pop Warner
is pointing his men directly to the
Trojan game, drilling them in the new
formations and practicing defense
tactics to repell Southern California's
brilliant offense. Warner and the
players all witnessed the game last
Saturday at Berkeley in which the
Golden Bear and the Trojans fought
to a scoreless tie and consequently
have a good idea of the fight they
have ahead if they expect to win from
California and U.S.C.
Both Frank Wilton and Johnny
Preston participated in yesterday's
practice but did not scrimmage. Wil
ton will be back at his halfback posi
tion in less than two weeks if his in
jured knee heals as rapidly as is ex
pected. It is unknown whether Pres
ton will be called upon until after
the U.S.C. contest. He is still wearing
a cast over his arm which was frac
tured when Stanford met the Olympic
Club three weeks ago.
Following Warner's orders issued
Monday, yesterday's practice was a
closed affair and all practice will con
tinue to be absolutely behind closed
gates until November 5. Only the
players, coaches, and a few assistants
were allowed on the field. Visitors,
press representatives, and sophomore
managers were barred.
