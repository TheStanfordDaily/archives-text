# The 						Honor System on the Stand
## 
### 
Three moves toward rehabilitation of the honor system, which are in
line with the activities of the committee appointed by Phil Cavalero to
investigate the same, were made by the Men's and Women's Councils in
joint meeting Tuesday night. In short, these moves were an exact defini
tion of the system, the immediate dismissal from the University of vio
lators, and the publication of their names.
Much in the manner that legends gain credence, the honor system has
been construed to apply to all phases of student behavior. Entering stu
dents sign a pledge to observe it. Then they read in the A.S.S.U. Hand
book that "The Honor System is a tradition which is perhaps far more
reaching in its effects than any other. It is so important that the incoming
freshmen often have difficulty in comprehending its full significance."
No exact definition of the system is given nor is what information
there is concerning it placed before the new students as well as it might be.
The placing of a comprehensive definition before all members of the stu
dent body, old as well as new, is a significant move toward building up
the crumbling system. In the decision of the councils, the honor system is
made applicable alone "to conduct in examinations or in any work which
is to be graded."
The second and third moves will act as strong deterrents to students
who are about to violate the system. It is argued that clemency should
be shown. Clemency has been shown in the past in this respect, and now
the honor system is in need of investigation. The efficacy of these moves
toward establishing the honor system as an effective institution in student
government remains to be seen. However, they are highly commendable.
