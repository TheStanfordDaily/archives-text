						Logical Complaint

### 
Professor A. C. Whitaker has written a communication to the Daily
taking it to task for what he thought was an error in the Pacific Coast
Conference football ratings. Although he did not say it in words, he
implied that he was somewhat angry because U. S. C. and U. C. had the
same percentage as Stanford, despite the fact that each of these two teams
has one tie game against it.
Although Professor Whitaker is logically correct, the Daily was not
in error according to precedent. Tie games have not been figured in con
ference ratings. At the end of each football season sport writers fill up
many columns deciding who won the conference.
This problem comes up every year and yet there has been no definite
ruling on it. Last year the conference ended in a theoretical triple tie
because Stanford and U.S.C. each had one tie game and Idaho had two.
Since they had all been undefeated they had the same percentage.
The Daily wishes that a ruling would be made on this point. It would
eliminate some of the wrangling and misunderstandings that arise every
football season.
