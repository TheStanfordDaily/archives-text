# Not To Eat, Orâ€”Not To Eat

'Twould seem to us (editorial) that the freshmen are literally cutting
their own throats when they ask that they be served food seven times a
week at no increase in cost to themselves. While we hate to appear like
the old grad who conies back and tells about the good old days, we must
swallow our hate and tell the freshmen that they really are eating better
under the present system.
Miss Longycar tells us that at the present rate, she will probably show
a deficit at the end of this quarter. What kind of food, then, will she be
able to serve when another sixth must be added to the number of meals ?
Far from being a Don Quixote for the protection of the management
of Encina Commons, we were much angered that the poor freshman was
to be limited to eating six days a week ; particularly when he had to carry a
valiseful of red tickets around with him, in addition to all his other books
and paraphernalia. But, as usual there are two sides to the question (or
perhaps three: yours, mine and the right one). The other side is that the
University wanted to cease having the name for giving out Salvation
Army grub, and get down to dispensing edible meals. It has been shown
that this couldn't be done 011 one dollar a day, when extra help had to be
got, due to a benevolent legislature's passing a rule that six days is long
enough for any man to work in one week.
What the freshmen should do is decide whether they would rather eat
better food for six days and rest the seventh, or eat just food for seven
days. Now, if they choose the former alternative they can go downtown
and get a change regularly, which is a beneficial thing to do, and thus have
one hundred per cent good meals. But if they take the latter course they
will be forced, by the dictates of their own stomachs, to take a change
periodically, and have six-sevenths food that is not so good. Either way
they'll come out about even oti the money.
But we advise that they take the six-day rations, and borrow money
from the roommate for the helps' day oIT.
Militant prohibitionists will be pleased to hear that "The Bon Vi
vant's Companion, or How to Mix Drinks" a book published by Alfred A.
Knopf and containing 306 recipes for drinks, 16 of which are temperance
drinks, is enjoying a wide sale.
