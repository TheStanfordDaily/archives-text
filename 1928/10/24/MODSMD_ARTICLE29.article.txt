## THE 						SAUSAGE GRINDER 
### 
Dr. Wilbur has recently succeeded,
after three years of effort, in complet
ing subsciption for a much-needed en
dowment to the University, approximat
ing one million dollars. A large portion
of the money, it is announced, will be
devoted to paying salaries which will
assure to Stanford a continued high
standard of professorship
To demonstrate the necessity for such
a fund, it is only necessary to point out
two facts: first, that the salaries of edu
cators have not, within recent years, kept
pace with the increase of earnings in
other fields; and second, that you must
pay well to secure the best. This latest en
dowment will therefore insure Stanford
against that evil so common elsewhere—
an oversupply of instructors who eke out
easy bread and butter by the so-called
"sausage grinder method, which we de
scribe hereunder:
String of "Sausages"
Two hours per day, or ten hours in a
week of 168 hours, devoted to lectures
which we outlined years ago, repeated
in phonograph fashion year after year.
Add to this mechanism successive genera
tons of raw student material, turn the
crank—and the result is a long string of
"sausages" with scarcely any effort.
Few professors do morj; lecturing than
this, but the great majority devote un
told hours to individual students and to
research for improvement of their
courses, of civilization or of science.
The real Sausage Grinder, 011 the
other hand, cither does not give courses
which must be kept up to date, or neg
lects to do so. He usually has assistants

who attend to such bothersome trifles
as planning and correcting examinations,
roll call, etc. He works but four per
cent of the time. He tolerates the stu
dents whom he puts through the "grind
er" just as he would tolerate so many
sausages. He is exceedingly irked when
they come to him with problems, and
shows it—the victim does not return a
second time. He forgets entirely that
his business is, basically, teaching.
Students a Nuisance
The attitude of students must be
blamed partially for this sentiment. Ad
mittedly students are a doggone nuisance
—but then, so is the grocery bill.
If the Sausage Grinder could compress
his work into 8-hour days, he would
work slightly more than six weeks—•
and call it a year. He draws a year's
salary. More than ninety per cent of
his time is his own, yet he feels injured
if more is demanded of him. A con
siderable part of that spare time is de
voted to grumbling about salary and to
wondering why he does not receive ad
vancement. He considers that the pass
ing years owe him the reputation of
being a Great Educator. After all,
though, is he not pretty well cared for,
considering the fact that he works but
four days in one hundred, and then at the
relatively simple task of grinding sau
sages ?
Such men are found in almost all col
leges. They are becoming less numerous
nowadays, for scientific administration is
weeding them out. A few remain. Not
even the finest of ships is free of
barnacles.

a fund, it is only necessary to point out
two facts: first, that the salaries of edu
cators have not, within recent years, kept
pace with the increase of earnings in
other fields; and second, that you must
pay well to secure the best. This latest en
dowment will therefore insure Stanford
against that evil so common elsewhere—
an oversupply of instructors who eke out
easy bread and butter by the so-called
"sausage grinder method, which we de
scribe hereunder:
String of "Sausages"
Two hours per day, or ten hours in a
week of 168 hours, devoted to lectures
which we outlined years ago, repeated
in phonograph fashion year after year.
Add to this mechanism successive genera
tons of raw student material, turn the
crank—and the result is a long string of
"sausages" with scarcely any effort.
Few professors do morj; lecturing than
this, but the great majority devote un
told hours to individual students and to
research for improvement of their
courses, of civilization or of science.
The real Sausage Grinder, 011 the
other hand, cither does not give courses
which must be kept up to date, or neg
lects to do so. He usually has assistants

who attend to such bothersome trifles
as planning and correcting examinations,
roll call, etc. He works but four per
cent of the time. He tolerates the stu
dents whom he puts through the "grind
er" just as he would tolerate so many
sausages. He is exceedingly irked when
they come to him with problems, and
shows it—the victim does not return a
second time. He forgets entirely that
his business is, basically, teaching.
Students a Nuisance
The attitude of students must be
blamed partially for this sentiment. Ad
mittedly students are a doggone nuisance
—but then, so is the grocery bill.
If the Sausage Grinder could compress
his work into 8-hour days, he would
work slightly more than six weeks—•
and call it a year. He draws a year's
salary. More than ninety per cent of
his time is his own, yet he feels injured
if more is demanded of him. A con
siderable part of that spare time is de
voted to grumbling about salary and to
wondering why he does not receive ad
vancement. He considers that the pass
ing years owe him the reputation of
being a Great Educator. After all,
though, is he not pretty well cared for,
considering the fact that he works but
four days in one hundred, and then at the
relatively simple task of grinding sau
sages ?
Such men are found in almost all col
leges. They are becoming less numerous
nowadays, for scientific administration is
weeding them out. A few remain. Not
even the finest of ships is free of
barnacles.

after three years of effort, in complet
