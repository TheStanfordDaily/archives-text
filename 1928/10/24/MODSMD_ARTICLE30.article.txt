# Campus Opinion

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial reprint today from
the "Ignatian News" was inadvertant
ly worthwhile in this respect: it
served as a provocative opener for
discussion of the Honor System, and
discussion is what we need. To start
things I offer the following:
Admittedly the campus is inun
dated by a wave of cynicism which
prevents straight thinking about this
Honor System question. Were the stu
dent body to lay aside its present at
titude and think the thing through,
no problem would remain: one could
not help realizing that Honor is an
ultimate, that a person cannot be
half-honorable. It follows then that
when dealing with an individual who
has shown no sense of honor in cer
tain of his actions, half-way measures
cannot be taken; and since we have
decided that such an individual has no
place on our campus the logical thing
to do is to ask him to leave, unpro
visionally and immediately. Both
men's and women's councils have
adopted this policy, and in future con
victions of Honor System violators
there will take no action less final.
There can be only one verdict, and
the name of the person concerned
will not be kept secret.
The councils have done their part
in thus making clear their position
and in closely defining the working
limits of Stanford's Honor System.
(It is hoped of course that honor will
not be limited to the classroom, but
in the interest of effective simplicity
it seems wiser not to spread the
violable part of it too thin.) The first
steps have been well taken, but at
tention now centers on a far more
vital point: from now on every Stan
ford man and woman must make the
Honor System self-enforcing. They
must make it very evident to a
cheater that he is not wanted on the
campus.
It may be done personally —a coura
geous Individual, for instance, who is
not ashamed to stand for things hon
orable will simply ask the cheater to
report himself or else defend himself
before his proper council —or it may
be done by the more powerful weapon
of public opinion, perhaps most ef
fectively used by Harvard students
who manage to make it exceedingly
clear to a cheater that he is not
wanted in the classroom —so clear
that by no more than their contempt
he is forced to tear up his paper and
leave. They call it "elbowing him out
of the room."
Surely everyone has been brought
up to cultivate in himself that elu
sive thing called Honor and to re
spect its code; why must we organ
ize a drive to arouse respect for a
quality of character which should be
outstanding in university men and
women? —M. A. C.
The Editor, Sir:
From our humble point of view, the
recent efforts of several members of
our student body to make more ef
fective that browbeaten institution
known as the Honor System are sadly
misdirected. Those worthies are at
tempting to repair something that
Itself rests on a false foundation.
It seems to us that what should be
first attacked are the contributory
causes that lend to the difficulty of
enforcement. The present plan of
grading, of examination, of large lec
ture groups which necessitate the

corrector system—these are the fac
tors which must be considered before
an intelligent survey can be made of
the too frequently occurring breaches
of the Honor System.
The Honor System, laboring under
the above-mentioned handicaps plus
the lack of adequate consideration of
the ever-present human equation,
must be ineffective.

The Editor, Sir:
Even though I have not bought a
ticket to the concert, I appreciate
music—in its place. I can tolerate a
circus band, an organist in a theatre,
or even a Merry-go-round's tin can
clatter, but I do not dote on having
scales sung in my ears while I'm try
ing to absorb abtruse philosophy lec
tures between eleven and twelve
o'clock in Room 90. Hunger makes
concentrated attention difficult enough
without the disconcerting strivings of
an embryonic singer, attempting to
reach the altitudinous and long-drawn
out notes, ringing in my ears.
The mixture of music from the
spheres and that coming to my ears
is almost unbearable.
I thought that perhaps I was alone
in my opinion so I questioned several
other students in the class. Here are
the results:
Says one: "They ought to be ar
rested for broadcasting without li
cense."
Says another: "Someone ought to
choke her or call a doctor."
Etc., etc., etc., etc., none of which
delicate and subtle remarks could be
conceived as complimentary to the
singer. One might go so far as to say
that disapprobation was being ex
pressed.
Yet, not one of these people dis
likes music. And one gentleman, who
is a music lover, recommends a nice
open field out by the old stone quarry,
where the practicing would not dis
turb anyone.
Why cannot an auditorium, at a
good distance from lecture rooms, be
found for singers? —L: B. S.

The councils have done their part
in thus making clear their position
and in closely defining the working
limits of Stanford's Honor System.
(It is hoped of course that honor will
not be limited to the classroom, but
in the interest of effective simplicity
it seems wiser not to spread the
violable part of it too thin.) The first
steps have been well taken, but at
tention now centers on a far more
vital point: from now on every Stan
ford man and woman must make the
Honor System self-enforcing. They
must make it very evident to a
cheater that he is not wanted on the
campus.
It may be done personally —a coura
geous Individual, for instance, who is
not ashamed to stand for things hon
orable will simply ask the cheater to
report himself or else defend himself
before his proper council —or it may
be done by the more powerful weapon
of public opinion, perhaps most ef
fectively used by Harvard students
who manage to make it exceedingly
clear to a cheater that he is not
wanted in the classroom —so clear
that by no more than their contempt
he is forced to tear up his paper and
leave. They call it "elbowing him out
of the room."
Surely everyone has been brought
up to cultivate in himself that elu
sive thing called Honor and to re
spect its code; why must we organ
ize a drive to arouse respect for a
quality of character which should be
outstanding in university men and
women? —M. A. C.
The Editor, Sir:
From our humble point of view, the
recent efforts of several members of
our student body to make more ef
fective that browbeaten institution
known as the Honor System are sadly
misdirected. Those worthies are at
tempting to repair something that
Itself rests on a false foundation.
It seems to us that what should be
first attacked are the contributory
causes that lend to the difficulty of
enforcement. The present plan of
grading, of examination, of large lec
ture groups which necessitate the

corrector system—these are the fac
tors which must be considered before
an intelligent survey can be made of
the too frequently occurring breaches
of the Honor System.
The Honor System, laboring under
the above-mentioned handicaps plus
the lack of adequate consideration of
the ever-present human equation,
must be ineffective.

The Editor, Sir:
Even though I have not bought a
ticket to the concert, I appreciate
music—in its place. I can tolerate a
circus band, an organist in a theatre,
or even a Merry-go-round's tin can
clatter, but I do not dote on having
scales sung in my ears while I'm try
ing to absorb abtruse philosophy lec
tures between eleven and twelve
o'clock in Room 90. Hunger makes
concentrated attention difficult enough
without the disconcerting strivings of
an embryonic singer, attempting to
reach the altitudinous and long-drawn
out notes, ringing in my ears.
The mixture of music from the
spheres and that coming to my ears
is almost unbearable.
I thought that perhaps I was alone
in my opinion so I questioned several
other students in the class. Here are
the results:
Says one: "They ought to be ar
rested for broadcasting without li
cense."
Says another: "Someone ought to
choke her or call a doctor."
Etc., etc., etc., etc., none of which
delicate and subtle remarks could be
conceived as complimentary to the
singer. One might go so far as to say
that disapprobation was being ex
pressed.
Yet, not one of these people dis
likes music. And one gentleman, who
is a music lover, recommends a nice
open field out by the old stone quarry,
where the practicing would not dis
turb anyone.
Why cannot an auditorium, at a
good distance from lecture rooms, be
found for singers? —L: B. S.
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial reprint today from
the "Ignatian News" was inadvertant
ly worthwhile in this respect: it
served as a provocative opener for
discussion of the Honor System, and
discussion is what we need. To start
things I offer the following:
Admittedly the campus is inun
dated by a wave of cynicism which
prevents straight thinking about this
Honor System question. Were the stu
dent body to lay aside its present at
titude and think the thing through,
no problem would remain: one could
not help realizing that Honor is an
ultimate, that a person cannot be
half-honorable. It follows then that
when dealing with an individual who
has shown no sense of honor in cer
tain of his actions, half-way measures
cannot be taken; and since we have
decided that such an individual has no
place on our campus the logical thing
to do is to ask him to leave, unpro
visionally and immediately. Both
men's and women's councils have
adopted this policy, and in future con
victions of Honor System violators
there will take no action less final.
There can be only one verdict, and
the name of the person concerned
will not be kept secret.

of the room."
Surely everyone has been brought
up to cultivate in himself that elu
sive thing called Honor and to re

quality of character which should be
outstanding in university men and
women? —M. A. C.
The Editor, Sir:
From our humble point of view, the
recent efforts of several members of
our student body to make more ef
fective that browbeaten institution
known as the Honor System are sadly
misdirected. Those worthies are at
tempting to repair something that
Itself rests on a false foundation.
It seems to us that what should be
first attacked are the contributory
causes that lend to the difficulty of
enforcement. The present plan of
grading, of examination, of large lec
ture groups which necessitate the

corrector system—these are the fac
tors which must be considered before
an intelligent survey can be made of
the too frequently occurring breaches
of the Honor System.
The Honor System, laboring under
the above-mentioned handicaps plus
the lack of adequate consideration of
the ever-present human equation,
must be ineffective.
Constructively yours,

The Editor, Sir:
Even though I have not bought a
ticket to the concert, I appreciate
music—in its place. I can tolerate a
circus band, an organist in a theatre,
or even a Merry-go-round's tin can
clatter, but I do not dote on having
scales sung in my ears while I'm try
ing to absorb abtruse philosophy lec
tures between eleven and twelve
o'clock in Room 90. Hunger makes
concentrated attention difficult enough
without the disconcerting strivings of
an embryonic singer, attempting to
reach the altitudinous and long-drawn
out notes, ringing in my ears.
The mixture of music from the
spheres and that coming to my ears
is almost unbearable.
I thought that perhaps I was alone
in my opinion so I questioned several
other students in the class. Here are
the results:
Says one: "They ought to be ar
rested for broadcasting without li
cense."
Says another: "Someone ought to
choke her or call a doctor."
Etc., etc., etc., etc., none of which
delicate and subtle remarks could be
conceived as complimentary to the
singer. One might go so far as to say
that disapprobation was being ex
pressed.
Yet, not one of these people dis
likes music. And one gentleman, who
is a music lover, recommends a nice
open field out by the old stone quarry,
where the practicing would not dis
turb anyone.
Why cannot an auditorium, at a
good distance from lecture rooms, be
found for singers? —L: B. S.
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial reprint today from
the "Ignatian News" was inadvertant
ly worthwhile in this respect: it
served as a provocative opener for
discussion of the Honor System, and
discussion is what we need. To start
things I offer the following:
Admittedly the campus is inun
dated by a wave of cynicism which
prevents straight thinking about this
Honor System question. Were the stu
dent body to lay aside its present at
titude and think the thing through,
no problem would remain: one could
not help realizing that Honor is an
ultimate, that a person cannot be
half-honorable. It follows then that
when dealing with an individual who
has shown no sense of honor in cer
tain of his actions, half-way measures
cannot be taken; and since we have
decided that such an individual has no
place on our campus the logical thing
to do is to ask him to leave, unpro
visionally and immediately. Both
men's and women's councils have
adopted this policy, and in future con
victions of Honor System violators
there will take no action less final.
There can be only one verdict, and
the name of the person concerned
will not be kept secret.
The councils have done their part
in thus making clear their position
and in closely defining the working
limits of Stanford's Honor System.
(It is hoped of course that honor will
not be limited to the classroom, but
in the interest of effective simplicity
it seems wiser not to spread the
violable part of it too thin.) The first
steps have been well taken, but at
tention now centers on a far more
vital point: from now on every Stan
ford man and woman must make the
Honor System self-enforcing. They
must make it very evident to a
cheater that he is not wanted on the
campus.
It may be done personally —a coura
geous Individual, for instance, who is
not ashamed to stand for things hon
orable will simply ask the cheater to
report himself or else defend himself
before his proper council —or it may
be done by the more powerful weapon
of public opinion, perhaps most ef
fectively used by Harvard students
who manage to make it exceedingly
clear to a cheater that he is not
wanted in the classroom —so clear
that by no more than their contempt
he is forced to tear up his paper and
leave. They call it "elbowing him out
of the room."
