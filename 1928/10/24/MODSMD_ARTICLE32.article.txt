# The 						"HIST" in HISTORY

Debunkers mercilessly slash
Our tried and trusty history hooks.
So Robin Tlood was out for cash!
His band was just a bunch of crooks.
Our Russian commentary shows
That though the Cold brought grip

ping pains
It's doubtful if the Russian snows
Quite justified the Russian reigns.
The Lily Maid of Astolat
Saw Lancelot with ardor burning.
She steeled her soul and yielded not â€”
Became Elaine that has no turning.
Perhaps the shot heard 'round the
world
Originally was a dud.
Perhaps for all that Raleigh cared
The queen walked ankle-deep in
mud.
For future days we choke a sob
For Gabriel on the Judgment Morn
Instead of being on the job
Will just be blowing his own horn.
Several more men are wanted to
swell the chorus of the glee club.
They should have a swell chorus.

"Pardon me, sir, but I'm a philolo
gist, and "
"Thass all right, sport, I don't never
hold a man's religion against him." |
