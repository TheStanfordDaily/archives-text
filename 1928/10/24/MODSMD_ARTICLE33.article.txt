# The 						REVIEWER
## 
### 
Brook Evans, by Susan Glaspell, New
York (Frederick A. Stokes Co.,
1928).
Any review of "Brook Evans" will
eventually fall short of giving an accur
ate idea of the book's charm. This is
because the story seems to be concerned
merely with the old struggle between life
and duty—between love and beauty, and
submission to conventions. Such a theme
apparently offers no escape from a dull
and obvious sermon.
Naomi Kellog and Joe Copeland love
each other, but they may not marry be
cause of the jealousy of Joe's proud,
cold old mother. Then Joe is inoppor
tunely killed by a harvesting machine,
and Naomi, to spare her bewildered and
righteous family, marries the tiresome,
unattractive Caleb Evans, thus giving her
child and Joe's a name. Could anything
be more commonplace?
The rest of the story is more unex
pected. Naomi calls her daughter Brook
Evans, because she is an idealist, and
the brook that flowed through her fath
er's farm was a symbol to her of the
only joy that she had ever known in
life. She wants her daughter to have
what she herself was cheated of. But
Brook tragically misunderstands her
mother, and it is not until long after
Naomi's death that she realizes the wis
dom of her mother's hope for her. Was it
then too late?
Brook Evans is essentially a novel of
sadness. This element is heightened by
the simplicity and quiet dignity of Miss
GlaspeU's style. And something in her
treatment of this familiar, hackneyed
theme makes the story anything but com
monplace.

***"THE WEDDING MARCH"—Cali
fornia Theater.

Here is a picture with plenty about
love; nothing new, but some extraordin
ary angles on the subject, and quite frank,
too. "The Wedding March" gives love
and life, in the decadent pre-war Austrian
society. Erich von Stroheim, playing
the lead as prince, starts the morning by
catching and kissing, before he arises, a
pretty maid who is pilfering his pockets
of a woman's stocking.
Fay Wray, as a beautiful peasant girl,
is the prince's next and biggest love.
After some mediocre shots of a typical
von Stronheim orgie, the prince leaves
his bevy of dancing girls to make a ren
dezvous with Fay Wray at her rural
home. He takes her down a ladder, out
under apple blossoms into a convenient
buggy seat. Some enlightening scenes
fullow.
There are no minor parts in this pro
duction. Every cast member has a defi
nite character to put across, and they are
well chosen to the prince's mother and
father, played by Maude George and
George Faucett, to the lame daughter of
the "corn plaster millionaire," whom the
prince has to marry from economic ne
cessity, which means giving up Fay
Wray.
Von Stroheim gets intense interest
from accurate, realistic portrayal of hu
man nature, and from the use of con
trast, as in the scene where the royal
family goes from a pillow-fight to march
in the Corpus Christi parade as objects
of admiration for all the land. This pro
cession is done in color with much
splendor. Photography of "The Wed
ding March" ranks high among the
"super" productions of filmdom.
