# TIBBETT CHOOSES VARIED PROGRAM FOR HIS RECITAL
## Songs From Many Nations Included in Selections Of Noted Singer 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
From the light gaiety of the songs
from the "Beggar's Opera" to the
poignant depths of feeling In the
Prologue from "I Pagliacci," a wide
range of emotional response will be
found in the program which Lawrence
Tibbett, American baritone, will pre
sent in the first of the A.S.S.U. Con
cert Series Friday night in the
Pavilion.
Tibbett has chosen his songs so
that every taste will be satisfied, and
the program represents the music of
England, Germany, Italy, and Russia.
Jn Rachmaninoff's "In the Silent
Night," the mystery and sombreness
as well as the extraordinary beauty
of the night is felt.
Tibbett has often been called the
Barrymore of the operatic boards be
cause of his extreme versatility on
the stage. He is one of New York's
most popular stars in the Metropoli
tan, and has made a great success of
the role of King Eadger in the new
American Opera by Deems Taylor,
"The King's Henchman." The lyrics
for this opera were written in Eng
lish by Edna St. Vincent-Millay, and
in the role of the King who sends
his henchman to seek the King's
bride, only to have the henchman
himself fall in love with the King's
choice, Tibbett possessed a role espe
cially suitable for his wide range of
dramatic as well as vocal power.
