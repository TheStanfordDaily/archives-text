# Professor Leighton Speaks Before Phi Lambda Upsilon

### 
Professor P. A. Leighton spoke on
the subject of "The Quantitative De
termination of Oxygen in Commercial
Nitrogen" at a meeting of the Phi
Lambda Upsilon Research Conference
yesterday afternoon.
The method of determining the per
centage of oxygen in inert gases was
by reaction with a dye element to
produce color, he explains. The object
was to find the ratio of oxygen by
using only small samples of material,
which was successfully accomplished,
he said.
