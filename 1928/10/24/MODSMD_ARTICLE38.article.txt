# SPORTS OF 1928
## For Money, Not For Glory 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
This little Arab, El Ouafi, is a fanny
fellow, as I thought on August fifth
last when I first saw him, as he won
the Marathon race at Amsterdam for
dear old France, although he is no
more French than the Graf Zeppelin.
He was funny then because he asked
for a cigarette the first thing after he
finished his long run, and now he's
funnier still because he is willing to
run a series of 26-mile races for
money against Joie Ray and any other
athletes who can be lured into Tex
Riekard's spider-web for the sake of
the promoter's gold.
It's not that there's anything the
matter with professional running; it's
the idea of running around and around
a little indoor track, wearing a ciga
rette ad on your chest and hack, and
thinking that thousands of people are
going to pay thousands of dollars to
see you run yourself dizzy.
Still, they did it back in 1908 and
'09 after the dramatic Marathon race
in London between Hayes and Dor
f-ndo, and people actually paid to see
a Marathon dance contest. But El
Ouafi's victory over Ray in Amster
dam was not so dramatic as Hayes'
over Dorando, and the addition of
Willie Kohlemainen to the party will
not insure its financial success, as I
see it. Add Texas Guinan and you
might make a go of it â€”or better still,
Aimee Semple McPherson! I doubt if

Pheidippides, the first Marathon run
ner, who dropped dead in Athens as
he announced the Greek victory over
the Persians in the Battle of Mara
thon, would think much of this race
over the historic 26 miles, 385 yards.
You see, El Ouafi and Joie Ray aren't
going to run just after they take part
in a battle, and then I think doing it
for money would be just a little bit
more than the proud Pheidippides
could understand.
