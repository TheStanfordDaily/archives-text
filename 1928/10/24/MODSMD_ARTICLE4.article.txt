# GOLF PLAY TODAY WILL DECIDE TITLE
## Breakers Team Is Conceded Best Chance in Round With A.T.O. Pair 
### 
Four men representing the golf
hopes of Breakers and Alpha Tau
Omega will tee off at 1 o'clock this
afternoon at the Capuchino Country
Club in the championship round of
the 1928 intramural golf tournament.
C. W. Carlsmith and A1 Esberg of
the Breakers are conceded the great
est chance to win by followers of the
matches to date, since their victories
have all been by large margins and
against the strongest teams in the
tournament.
In the qualifying round last week
Breakers finished a close third, with
the Alpha Tau Omega team tied with
Theta Chi in fifth place. Since then
the club men defeated Theta Chi 6
and 4, and took an 8 and 6 victory
over Encina W, who had already
downed the Beta Theta Pi team, win
ners of the qualifying round.
Robert Paine and Raymond Charles,
the Alpha Tau Omega golfers, de
feated the Phi Gamma Delta team in
their first match last week and in
the semi-finals yesterday won from
Kappa Sigma in a closely contested
match.
Two other matches will be played
today, Kappa Sigma and Encina 2W
opposing each other for third place.
This should be a very close match as
both teams have made an equally
good showing durnig the tournament.
In the qualifying round Kappa Sigma
finished second and Encina sixth, but
the latter's victory over Beta Theta
Pi proved their true strength.
The other match will be between
Alpha Sigma Phi and Phi Sigma
Kappa for first place in the second
flight.
