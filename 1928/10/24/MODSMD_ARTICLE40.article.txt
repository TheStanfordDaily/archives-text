# RISE IN PRICE OF SHARES FOLLOWS MONEY LOWERING

### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 23. (/P) â€”A gen
eral lowering of money rates today
was accompanied by a broad upward
movement in the shares of such basic
industries as steel, oil, copper, and
automotive. Rails also took a more
prominent part in the rally. The ad
vance was by no means uniform, as
heavy proiit-taking again caused sharp
recessions in some of the high-priced
specialties.
Call money renewed at 6 per cent,
the lowest opening rate since Sept.
28, and was in plentiful supply at that
figure all day, despite the calling of
$20,000,000 in bank loans. Time money
was on a flat 6% per cent basis as
against a ruling rate of 7 per cent,
last week. Federal Reserve officials
indicated that the peak of the fall
commercial demands had been passed
and that easier rates could be looked
for. The weekly bank statement is ex
pected to show a further substantial
decline in member bank rediscounts.
Curtis Aero & Motor Corporation
has been awarded a $1,000,000 con
tract to manufacture plans for Chile,
it was learned today. Production is
scheduled to begin November 1 at the
Buffalo plant.
