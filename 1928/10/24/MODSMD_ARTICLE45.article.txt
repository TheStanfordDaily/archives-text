# LITA CHAPLIN LAUNCHES STAGE CAREER
## Has Had No Previous Theatrical Experience; Only Fear About Act Is That Seals May Squawk During Song 
### BEN MADDOX 
Lita Grey Chaplin is a friendly
boul. Having emoted a few months as
leading lady for Charlie Chaplin in
"The Circus," she retired to be the
comedian's wife. Now, some $750,000
the wiser, she is doing her durndest
to make herself a success on the
stage.
Just a poor little rich girl ambitious
tc get along, and so new at the
theatrical game that she doesn't
bother to pose or be "different."
Rather tall, undeniably pretty, and
splendidly poised for one so young.
"No, I've never had any stage ex
perience before," she told me Sunday
when she got back to the theatre from
the Press Club where she had been
guest of honor at the weekly dinner
dance. Her act is a musical one, but
she admits that she has never sung in
public before —"except for women's
clubs."
Has No Stage-Fright
Stage-fright is the least of her wor
ries. "You see I opened in Long Beach
last week —and twenty-one shows
(three a day) has given me consider
able training."

Lita is just as "you and I"—no
Peggy Hopkins Joyce effects. "This
is really a trial week," she confided.
"If I bring the money into the box
office, then I'll make a vaudeville
tour of the whole country. So far I'm
getting a wonderful reception."
And the girl lias a sense of humor,
too. "My only fear about the act is
that one of the trained seals, Odiva
and her human seals being on the
same bill, will let out a squawk when
I'm singing." It's little moments of
suspense like these that keep vaude
villians pepped up.
Reared in Hollywood
"Born and raised in Hollywood,"
she said. "No, I didn't go to Holly
wood High—l had a private tutor and
then went to a dramatic school."
Lita is not going to inflict herself
upon the public if she isn't wanted.
"It's a good-bye career if I don't make
good here this week!" she frankly
admits. I didn't have time to see her
act, but if her singing doesn't take
I think she could be a success in regu
lar plays. She has looks, self-assur
ance, youth, and no doubt association
with the elite of Hollywood has taught
her something about acting.
