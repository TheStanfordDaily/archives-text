# COMPLETE CAST WILL REHEARSE COMEDY TONIGHT
## 
### 
A rehearsal of the complete cast of
Tom Cushing's comedy, "The Devil
in the Cheese," will be held tonight in
the Assembly Hall at 7 o'clock. The
entire forty-five in the cast of the
humorous fantasy are asked to ap
pear tonight by Gordon Davis as he
wishes to get the play as a unit into
working order.
Davis will pick out characters for
the numerous bits of acting, such as
that of the monks in handling the
windlass which hauls the Quigley
family from Kansas up to the top of
one of the most desolate mountains in
Greece. There are a number of small
bits, and a large amount of pantomime
among the shepherds and the maidens.
