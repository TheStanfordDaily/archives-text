# EUROPEAN ART CALLED NEO-CLASSICISM
## Stanford Professor Makes European Tour With Group; Attends International Congress in Prague as Lecturer 
### 
Neo-classicism is the name that Pro
fessor A. B. Clark, head of the Art
department, gives to the new form of
art which he found on a trip to the
art centers of Europe this summer.
"Neo-classicism uses color, light,
and shade in every arbitrary way to
set forth the form the artist sees,"
said Clark. "The painter sharpens an
angle or simplifies a plane but not to
such an extent that he loses the
identity of the subject.
More Knowledge of Color
"Some pictures have almost photo
: graphic beauty, but the new ones
; have inherent beauty plus something
| creative. The modernist knows more
about color than the artist used to.
This neo-classical movement is throw
ing over everything the impressionist
' learned. It is just as different from
i impressionism as tragedy from com
| edy.
"A narrow range of art in a person
or a country is a detriment to prog
ress." Here Clark cited the instance
of most American tourists with little
art education who get very tired in
the European galleries. '"Che guides
know this," said Clark, "and make
use of it. One of the guides in the
Louvre told me that most people want
to see three things, the Mona Lisa,
the Venus de Milo, and the Winged
Victory. Tourists are satisfied with
i this view of art."
Goes With Teachers, Critics
Professor Clark went to Europe
with a group of one hundred and
thirty people, including art educators,
teachers, and critics. Only places of
special art interest were visited, such
as Venice, where a biennial Interna
tional Exhibition of Modern Art was
held this summer, Florence, Rome,
Pisa, Milan, and Ravenna, which is

"way off the beaten track of tourists,"
according to Clark.
Professor Clark, as well as Pedro
J. Lemos, director of the Stanford
Art Gallery, attended the Internation
al Art Congress in Prague this sum
mer. Clark was one of the four lec
turers from this country.
