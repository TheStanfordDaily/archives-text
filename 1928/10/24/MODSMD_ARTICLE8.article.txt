# HUNT PRESCRIBES MUCH WORK FOR BABE GRID TEAM
## 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
Strenuous workouts, minus scrim
mageâ€”that is this week's program
outlined by Coach Husky Hunt for
the freshman football squad. The
small size of the squad and the lack
of heavy reserves would make any in
juries disastrous with the Southern
All-Stars on the schedule here next
Saturday and the U.S.C f freshmen
game here a week later.
Early reports that Rudy Rintala,
freshman left halfback, would be able
to play against the All-Stars seem to
have been erroneous. Rintala was in
a suit yesterday but was unable to
practice. The injury to his side re
ceived in the St. Mary's game last
week, though not serious, is such that
he will have to take things pretty easy
for the next week or so.
Although a stiff game is anticipated
with the All-Stars, interest is center
ing on the U.S.C.-Stanford freshman
! contest the following week and the
Little Big Game soon after. All three
i freshman teams have impressive rec
| ords, being undefeated. The Stanford
i yearlings were tied in their first game
j of the season with the Army, but to
1 make up for this tie they have piled
i up heavier scores than the U.S.C. and
! California frosh against teams met by
one or both of the others.
However, the California and U.S.C.
| freshman teams are heavier than they
j have been in several years and are
I said by coaches who have seen them
: play to possess more power than the
; Stanford first-year men. Whether or
not this is the case remains to be
j seen.
