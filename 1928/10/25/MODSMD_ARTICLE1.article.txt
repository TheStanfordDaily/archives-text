# ACCUSE HOOVER OF CONCEALING POLITICAL FACTS
## Governor Smith Opens Drive In New England With Retort to Hoover's Socialism Charge 
### 
BOSTON, Oct. 24. (/P) —The charge
that Herbert Hoover was using words
to "conceal- rather than convey" a
meaning was made tonight by Gov
ernor Alfred E. Smith, who ripped
into utterances made by the Repub
lican presidential nominee in New
York City on water power, farm re
lief, prosperity, and prohibition.
Opening his final drive for the
presidency in this city where Hoover
spoke nine days ago, the Democratic
candidate declared in a speech spe
cially prepared for the occasion that
ilie expression of "State Socialism"
was the "stock argument of the power
trust" which had been used against
him in his gubernatorial fights in
New York State. —
Accused of Socialism
"The cry of Socialism has been
patented by powerful interests," he
said, "that desire to put the damper
■on progressive legislation."
The Governor said Hoover, besides
referring to public water power de
velopment by calling it "State Social
ism," had taken an identical course
toward farm relief. He also declared
that the Republican candidate had re
ferred to his (Smith's) proposal for a !
change in prohibition by the same '
term.
On prohibition the Governor quoted !
Mr. Hoover as saying:
"Our country has deliberately un- i
dertaken a great social and economic j
experiment, noble in motive and far
reaching in purpose. It must be
worked out constructively."
Prohibition Discussed
"What does that mean?" asked
Smith. "What is the matter with the
noble experiment that, after eight!
years of trial, it is necessary for the
Republican candidate to say it must
be worked out constructively? Is it
working now? If not, what is the mat
ter? And what is his remedy? Why
not use words to convey the meaning
and not hide it?
"To refer to the remedies for all
these evils as State Socialism is not
constructive statesmanship, it is net
leadership; and leadership is what
this country is hungry for today. It
has not had it in the last eight years
und it has little prospect of it in the
four to come, in the event of Repub
lican success."

BOSTON, Oct. 24. (/P) —The charge
that Herbert Hoover was using words
to "conceal- rather than convey" a
meaning was made tonight by Gov
ernor Alfred E. Smith, who ripped
into utterances made by the Repub
lican presidential nominee in New
York City on water power, farm re
lief, prosperity, and prohibition.
Opening his final drive for the
presidency in this city where Hoover
spoke nine days ago, the Democratic
candidate declared in a speech spe
cially prepared for the occasion that
ilie expression of "State Socialism"
was the "stock argument of the power
trust" which had been used against
him in his gubernatorial fights in
New York State. —
Accused of Socialism
"The cry of Socialism has been
patented by powerful interests," he
said, "that desire to put the damper
■on progressive legislation."
The Governor said Hoover, besides
referring to public water power de
velopment by calling it "State Social
ism," had taken an identical course
toward farm relief. He also declared
that the Republican candidate had re
ferred to his (Smith's) proposal for a !
change in prohibition by the same '
term.
On prohibition the Governor quoted !
Mr. Hoover as saying:
"Our country has deliberately un- i
dertaken a great social and economic j
experiment, noble in motive and far
reaching in purpose. It must be
worked out constructively."
Prohibition Discussed
"What does that mean?" asked
Smith. "What is the matter with the
noble experiment that, after eight!
years of trial, it is necessary for the
Republican candidate to say it must
be worked out constructively? Is it
working now? If not, what is the mat
ter? And what is his remedy? Why
not use words to convey the meaning
and not hide it?
"To refer to the remedies for all
these evils as State Socialism is not
constructive statesmanship, it is net
leadership; and leadership is what
this country is hungry for today. It
has not had it in the last eight years
und it has little prospect of it in the
four to come, in the event of Repub
lican success."
