# CLUBS THREATEN WALKOUT FROM ENCINA DINING ROOMS
## 
### 
Disgruntled members of El Tigre, El Cuadro, Los Arcos, and El Capitan eating
clubs met en masse last night and threatened to walk out o fthe Encina dining halls
if better meals are not served for the increased board which they are paying.
Charges of extortion and inefficient management were hurled at the authorities
responsibly for the recent increased board rate of $1.20 per day, by the indignant
clubmen.

> After dinner last night the clubs rose in
a body and gathered in the club room of
El Tigre to discuss thje situation which
they declare is going to mean the death
of their organizations if relief is not
, found.
This is the second outbreak of discon
tent at the Commons within the week.
Tuesday night a petition of the freshmen
for meals seven days a week on which ap
peared the names of over two-thirds of
the members of Encina Club, was
pigeon-holed at a board meeting.
During the discussion at the indigna
tion meeting it was pointed out that the
Commons is the only eating place on the
campus which is charging the high board
rate and that it is the largest place and
should be run on the lowest per capita
cost.
A committee of the exasperated club
men has been appointed to investigate
the conditions under which other places
on the campus operate and to secure a
list of comparative prices to indicate
the increased cost of living over last
year. This information is to be presented
to Comptroller A. E. Roth in an effort
to show him that the price of food does
not warrant the increased board rate and
the poorer quality of Encina meals.
Other members were of the opinion
that the situation should be laid directly
before President Wilbur in order to get
just treatment. Their point was that
efforts to get concessions from the comp
troller had failed previously.
Another cause for anger was the
double charge that is made on freshman
rushees. The freshmen pay for a meal
at Encina and if they eat at a club, the
organization which entertains them must
pay an additional sixty cents. The au
thorities, it is alleged, have denied the
right of the clubs to entertain a person
who has already paid his board without
paying the double charge.
Leaders of the clubs believe that if
some relief for the situation, which they
characterize as intolerable, is not found,
the only alternative is for the clubs to
disband.

who has already paid his board without
paying the double charge.
Leaders of the clubs believe that if
some relief for the situation, which they
characterize as intolerable, is not found,
the only alternative is for the clubs to
disband.
Disgruntled members of El Tigre, El Cuadro, Los Arcos, and El Capitan eating
clubs met en masse last night and threatened to walk out o fthe Encina dining halls
if better meals are not served for the increased board which they are paying.
Charges of extortion and inefficient management were hurled at the authorities
responsibly for the recent increased board rate of $1.20 per day, by the indignant
clubmen.

> After dinner last night the clubs rose in
a body and gathered in the club room of
El Tigre to discuss thje situation which
they declare is going to mean the death
of their organizations if relief is not
, found.
This is the second outbreak of discon
tent at the Commons within the week.
Tuesday night a petition of the freshmen
for meals seven days a week on which ap
peared the names of over two-thirds of
the members of Encina Club, was
pigeon-holed at a board meeting.
During the discussion at the indigna
tion meeting it was pointed out that the
Commons is the only eating place on the
campus which is charging the high board
rate and that it is the largest place and
should be run on the lowest per capita
cost.
A committee of the exasperated club
men has been appointed to investigate
the conditions under which other places
on the campus operate and to secure a
list of comparative prices to indicate
the increased cost of living over last
year. This information is to be presented
to Comptroller A. E. Roth in an effort
to show him that the price of food does
not warrant the increased board rate and
the poorer quality of Encina meals.
Other members were of the opinion
that the situation should be laid directly
before President Wilbur in order to get
just treatment. Their point was that
efforts to get concessions from the comp
troller had failed previously.
Another cause for anger was the
double charge that is made on freshman
rushees. The freshmen pay for a meal
at Encina and if they eat at a club, the
organization which entertains them must
pay an additional sixty cents. The au
thorities, it is alleged, have denied the
right of the clubs to entertain a person
who has already paid his board without
paying the double charge.
