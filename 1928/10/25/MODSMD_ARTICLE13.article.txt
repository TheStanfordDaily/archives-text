# GRIDSTER SHOCKED, THROWN 13 SPADES
## 
### 
It happens once in a million times,
Ray bridge authorities. If the state
ment is accurate to the dot, Harry
Hillman will hold 090,909 hands of
bridge before he gets another layout
of thirteen spades in one hand.
Hillman, who is the youngest mem
ber of the varsity football squad, was
playing bridge yesterday afternoon at
the Zeta Psi house with Mar Albert
son, Jack Dutton, and Harry Berg,
when he was dealt the entire suite of
thirteen spades.
