# TIBBETT SINGS FOR STANFORD MUSIC SEASON
## Famed Baritone Is First of A.S.S.U. Concert Artists To Be Heard Here 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
Stanford's musical season will have
a brilliant opening tomorrow night in |
the Pavilion when a campus audience
gathers to hear one of America's ;
greatest opera singers, Lawrence Tib- j
bett. The concert will begin at 8:15
o'clock.
The California baritone, aside from
being a native son, received his edu
cational and musical training in Los j
Angeles. During the Great War, while
he served in the U.S. Navy, he made !
up his mind that he would live by and '
for his voice alone.
Metropolitan Triumph
In the words of Gilbert W. Gabriel,
who writes in the World's Work of
1925, Tibbett as Ford in "Falstaff,"
his first large part, was "treated to
such a riot as no American singer !
had ever before won in the Metro- !
politan Opera House."
Gabriel goes on to point out that
Metropolitan audiences are notorious
ly hard to arouse, and declares that
on only one other occasion was there 1
seen in the house such enthusiasm ;
and tumultuous applause—the night
America entered the War.
Since playing Ford in "Falstaff"
Tibbett has portrayed many roles be
fore the opera public. The New York
Evening World declared that Tibbett
"emerged as the shining light of 'The
King's Henchman'" and the Herald-
Tribune pronounced this performance
"the finest impersonation he has yet
given."
In San Francisco
Tibbett comes to Stanford fresh
from the San Francisco opera season
where he held the record among the
singers of numbers of performances.
He was seen as Amonasro in "Aida,"
as Manfredo in "L'Amore Dei Tre ;
Re," as Baron Scarpia in "Tosca," and
as Tonio in "I'agliacci," which is one ;
of his favorite roles.
The program chosen for the Stan- j
ford concert opening is rich and ;
varied. Tibbett's voice is capable of
expressing a great range of human
feeling, and in the light English, the i
melancholy Russian, the pensive Ger- |
man, and the poignantly sad Italian i
songs he has a wide range of emo
tional possibilities.
Tickets for the A.S.S.U. Series are

had ever before won in the Metro- !
politan Opera House."
Gabriel goes on to point out that
Metropolitan audiences are notorious
ly hard to arouse, and declares that
on only one other occasion was there 1
seen in the house such enthusiasm ;
and tumultuous applause—the night
America entered the War.
Since playing Ford in "Falstaff"
Tibbett has portrayed many roles be
fore the opera public. The New York
Evening World declared that Tibbett
"emerged as the shining light of 'The
King's Henchman'" and the Herald-
Tribune pronounced this performance
"the finest impersonation he has yet
given."
In San Francisco
Tibbett comes to Stanford fresh
from the San Francisco opera season
where he held the record among the
singers of numbers of performances.
He was seen as Amonasro in "Aida,"
as Manfredo in "L'Amore Dei Tre ;
Re," as Baron Scarpia in "Tosca," and
as Tonio in "I'agliacci," which is one ;
of his favorite roles.
The program chosen for the Stan- j
ford concert opening is rich and ;
varied. Tibbett's voice is capable of
expressing a great range of human
feeling, and in the light English, the i
melancholy Russian, the pensive Ger- |
man, and the poignantly sad Italian i
songs he has a wide range of emo
tional possibilities.
Tickets for the A.S.S.U. Series are
on sale now in the Old Union. An all- I
University dance, given at Branner
Hall under the auspices of Sigma i
Delta Chi, will follow the concert, j
Stanford's musical season will have
a brilliant opening tomorrow night in |
the Pavilion when a campus audience
gathers to hear one of America's ;
greatest opera singers, Lawrence Tib- j
bett. The concert will begin at 8:15
o'clock.
The California baritone, aside from
being a native son, received his edu
cational and musical training in Los j
Angeles. During the Great War, while
he served in the U.S. Navy, he made !
up his mind that he would live by and '
for his voice alone.
Metropolitan Triumph
In the words of Gilbert W. Gabriel,
who writes in the World's Work of
1925, Tibbett as Ford in "Falstaff,"
his first large part, was "treated to
such a riot as no American singer !
had ever before won in the Metro- !
politan Opera House."
