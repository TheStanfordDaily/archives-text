"Co-operation is the essence of So
cialism," said Cameron King, a Stan
ford graduate, prominent journalist
and labor leader on the Pacific Coast,
before a meeting of the Norman
Thomas-for-President Club Tuesday
night. "Business has learned the
necessity of co-operation, and indus
try must recognize its necessity. Or
ganization of laborers is the only way
to lessen the evils which result for
the laborer from competition."
King stressed the principle of public
ownership. "Socialism desires to put
democracy into industry as well as
into politics. Unless the workers com
bine to get more of the wealth which
they produce, they have not the power
to buy back. From this will result
more foreign investment of American
capital which will drive us eventually
into another world war."
After Cameron's talk, a short busi
ness meeting was held to discuss the
raising of money for a campaign
fund.
