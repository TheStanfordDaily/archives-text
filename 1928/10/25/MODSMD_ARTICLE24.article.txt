# CARDS, TROJANS TRAIN FOR TILT ON EVEN TERMS
## Warner, Jones Drilling Men In Similar Manner for Los Angeles Game November 3 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
When Stanford and Southern Cali
fornia clash in the Los Angeles Coliseum
a week from Saturday in one of the de
ciding games of the Conference season,
both teams should be on somewhat even
terms as a result of similar circumstances
in their preparation for the game.
Howard Jones saw Warner's men play
Idaho last week in San Francisco, while
Warner witnessed the Trojan's perform
ance against the Bears at Berkeley, so
both coaches have a good idea of their
! opponents' strong points and weaknesses
jat this time. Behind strictly guarded
| gates both teams are perfecting their
j offensive plays and practicing defense
against substitute teams running their
! opponent's systems of offensive play.
With men returning daily from the in
jury lists both teams should be near their
! best in the matter of man-power.
Light Workouts
Both the Cards and Trojans will have
light workouts this Saturday, Stanford
' playing Fresno State and U.S.C. meeting
Occidental, so that neither team will be
j pressed to the extent that injuries are
! likely to result before the crucial clash—
unless in scrimmage.
Warner said yesterday that he will
probably start the first string Cardinals
Saturday, but it is doubtful if they will
1 remain in the game very long. Stanford
j has not made any special preparations for
[the reception of the boys from the raisin
I district, but will depend on power alone
Ito turn the trick, as will Jones against
j the Oxy Tigers.
| Since meeting Idaho the Stanford team
j has been strengthened with Frank Wil
[ ton's return to active practice. Wilton
! will play against the Trojans and may
j see a bit of action against Fresno. Yes
i terday was the first time that he has
i been in scrimmage since his lc£ was in
jjured in the Oregon game.
Injured Return
The Thundering Herd is considerably
■ strengthened with the return to practice
lof Lowry McCaslin, Charley Boren,
! Harry Edclson and Harry Wilcox, alt
of whom were kept from the California
game because of injuries.
Pop Warner again scrimmaged his men
| until dark yesterday, the first and sec
i ond strings working against the third
'outfit, which used Howard Jones' system
iof play. Harlow Rothert enacted the
| role of "Dynamic" Don Williams—the
| man who does most of the ball carrying
| for U.S.C. and who is expected to take
jan important part in the Card-Trojan
i encounter on November 3.
