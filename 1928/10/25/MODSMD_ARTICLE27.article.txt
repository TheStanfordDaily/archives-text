# A 						College Concensus

### 
Numerous requests have besieged the Daily that a straw presidential
vote be taken before the election., After deeply cogitating whether this
would accord with our now historic leaning-backward policy and whether
Smith, Hoover or Thomas supporters would consider it advantageous
(and hence fair or unfair), we have determined to hold one next Wed
nesday, the day before the Stanford-U.C. debate on Smith and Hoover.
The poll, according to present plans, will be conducted in the manner
of a regular student body election and voters will be checked in the
bawlout as they vote, so that no duplication or stuffing may take place.
The particularly interesting feature of the poll is that other members
of the Pacific Intercollegiate Press are to take a vote on the same day.
The Daily will accordingly receive telegraph dispatches from all the
other members as to results of their straw votes and a consensus of a
majority of college students of the Pacific slope will be published along
with Stanford results on Thursday.
