The Senior Class, although few of its members are aware of the fact,
is by tradition the guardian of the honor system. Holding the torch aloft,
it is supposed to acquaint the rest of the student body with the meaning
of the honor spirit as it applies to conduct in class at Stanford and to
inoculate the proper respect for the thing.
Tonight the seniors will hold a meeting in Room 214 for discussion
of their part in seeing the honor system upheld. The meeting will not
be long, but it very likely will be the most important ever to have been
held by the class of 1929. Every senior should appear.
