# Comes the Bawlout
## 
### 
Well, the melancholy daze has come, as the Old Boy is so fond of
saying. It came with the issuance yesterday of the bawlout. What a
shock to see, in cold type, one's standing in the University!
But what diabolical pleasure is to be had in looking up the other
fellow's measly record!
There is one dryball, we note, who is 153+306. Straight-A with two
quarters to go. On the other hand, o—l4 is a true rough's average, after
our own heart. But, we query, does the LD stand for Lame Duck?
The bawlout, to become serious, lacks one important feature which
should by all means be included —telephone numbers. Unless a student
lives in a fraternity, sorority or hall, it is impossible to discover his phone
number except from the registrar, and the registrar's office is closed when
you have most occasion for wanting to get hold of your friend. "Phone
Numbers in the Bawlout by Christmas" is our most recent slogan.

Tryoutees for the editorial staff of the Daily will meet at 1 o'clock
today.
