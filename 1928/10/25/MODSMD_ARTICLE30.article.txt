October 23rd —
In the middle of my eleven o'clock
this morning, was much disturbed and
alarmed by the shrieks of a lady, but '
was relieved to listen and understand
it was someone practicing chromatic .
scales, and the voice was not so bad. !
Whereat was somewhat pleased at j
the idea of music accompanying lec- j
tures, but did wish it were a some- j
what pianissimo, for did strike me a
little unethical to make the professor
of my eleven o'clock accompany the !
singer.

Have been some bit disturbed by
the letters from my aunt this week,
for she doos demand that I get her |
three more U.S.C. tickets, albeit she ,
has just found that a friends of hers j
is drivihg south on that week-end ;
with a large car instead of a roadster; I
but do not think there is anything to j
be done about it, unless a plague or ;
epidemic strikes the campus and j
physically disables the students who |
were rich enough after registration j
day to buy their tickets so early in
the season. Do find myself wishing |
that football tickets could be bought!
as matinee tickets, with a deposit'
down, and weekly Installments, or
paid when claimed, for what with my
allowance coming in weekly chunks,
do find It most difficult to meet all
the demands that come upon it. And !
have come to the conclusion that j

j about the only thing sweet, simple,
and girlish about college is one's al
j lowance.

Do find myself wishing mightily
that I were a great power upon the
i campus, for I have bethought me of
jan excellent innovation, to-wit, that
the gentlemen who are cordial enough
to offer rides to students waiting for
I the trolley in Palo Alto, also extend
j these invitations to female students,
for do find it most cold, dicouraging,
and depressing to watch all the
I mighty crowd of men disintegrate
1 while I wait alone for the street car.
| Of course, I do most seriously realize
that there are disadvantages to this,
but if some conventional signal might
:be adopted, perchance some of these
difficulties might be abandoned. Per
haps if a lady is in a hurry, and would
like a ride most extraordinarily she
might remove her hat as the car in
i which she would like to ride comes
up. Or the gentleman who owns the
magazine stall might arrange intro
ductions, or if he is too busy with cus
tomers, the man who works the gates
by the tracks. For I am a most firm
believer in increasing campus and
Palo Alto contacts, and who knows
j what delightful experiences would en
| rich the introducer's lives in this
I manner?
