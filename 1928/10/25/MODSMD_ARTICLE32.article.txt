# SMITH AS POLITICAL SCIENTIST IS TOPIC
## Writer Discusses Candidate's Ability to Originate Ideas, to Lead Men, to Choose Able Subordinates 
### WALSTON S. BROWN 
(Herewith is printed the second article
in favor of the candidacy of Governor
Smith for President.)

In our first article we pointed out that
the purpose of this election is the choice
of a party, and that party desirability is
a matter of three things, e.g., its past
record, its leader, and its platform. We
contrasted in some detail the past records
of the two parties and since no effective
attempt was made to answer that point,
we shall regard it as proven. It is the
purpose of this article, then, to fonsider
Governor Smith in detail as a political
scientist or exf>ert politician. In subse
quent articles we shall consider the issues
and party platforms: farm relief, water
power, Governor Smith's proposal for
continuing the experiment on alcoholic
control begun under President Wilson,
and foreign policy. In short the contrast
between the two parties, we feel, is one of
past record, present leadership and future
program. We are now on the second of
these three points.
On careful analysis it would seem that
. {he qualities njy.st desirable in a president
are: (1) an ability to originate ideas, (2)
an ability to lead men, as it is essential for
him to do this in order to have his ideas
embodied in legislation of congress, and
(3) the ability to choose able subordinates.
Governor Smith has been one of the
few men in public life who has kept
abreast of the times in proposals for legist
lation. I)jrPclTy after the war there was
a gTffat deal of misery among the poor of
New York City on account of the short
age of housing facilities and the ex
orbitant rents that were being charged.
Smith recommended and had passed
effective emergency rent laws and an
amendment to the constitution permitting
cities to exempt certain classes of tene
ments from taxation. In 1926 a commis
sion which he had appointed for the pur
pose of recommending laws to encourage
the building of model tenements reported
and had passed a law by which the land
lord whose tenement fulfilled certain
sanitary and housing requirements and
netted him less than 6 per cent should
be partially exempt from taxation and
have the right of eminent domain over
undesirable tenement properly. Contrast
Governor Smith's handling of this crisis
with the Republican bungling of the farm
relief problem.
In 1919 he called a special session of
the legislature to pass the Woman Suff
rage Amendment. He advocated and had
passed a bill to encourage and permit co
operative marketing of farm products. He
encouraged and signed a bond issue of
$50,000,000 for new state institutions for
the care of state wards. The work in
education of Governor Smith's admin
istration is worthy of special praise. In
the nine years that he has been Governor
of the state, appropriations for public
schools increased from $11,554,597 to
$83,332,823, yet so efficiently were the
finances of the state handled under the
executive budget which he inaugurated
that direct taxes have been reduced over
sixty-two per cent during his nine years.
The legislation on crime, including the
Baume's Law, which he secured in New
York State is generally conceded to be
the most effective in the Union for dis
couraging larceny. Yet so progressive is
he that he was not willing to rest on his
laurels and last spring he proposed a plan
which would do away with the archaic
common law system of sentencing socially
defectives with reference only to the
crime committed and not to the problem
of making them fit for society. He pro
posed that the criminals should be sen
tenced by a board of trained psychia
trists and criminologists.
Thus we see that Governor Smith is
not lacking in ability to initiate progress
ive legislation. Now let us analyse his
most applauded feat, the reorganization
of the state government of New York,
paying special attention to his ability in
bringing men to his point of view. In
1920 he proposed an amendment for con
solidating 187 different departments and
bureaus of the executive branch of the
government into 18 logical divisions. This
was passed, but under the New York law
such an amendment must pass two suc
cessive senates. In 1921 under a Repub
lican governor it was defeated. Smith
made it a campaign issue in 1922 and had
it passed in 1923. It was again passed in
1925 and became a law.
Smith has been a bitter foe of reaction
ary legislation as he has been a friend of
progressive legislation. In 1919 the leg
islature passed a law curtailing the free
dom of speech. Smith vetoed it, but it
passed again under his Republican suc
cessor. Smith then stumped the state and
secured its repeal when lie became gov
ernor in 1923. He never bows before
opposition.
He has obtained for the State of New
York the services of the ablest men in
their respective lines. Working under
him arc to be found Jew, Protestant, and
Catholic, Democrat, Republican and So
cialist. In fact in his present cabinet of
fourteen members there arc eight Re
publicans and two Independents. As a
result of the efforts of New York State's
able servants its institutions serve as a
model for those of other states. Smith
is indeed a master of applied political
science.
Let us now consider Mr. Hoover's
qualifications with reference to this same
outline. Even his supporters admit that
as a popular leader he cannot compare

I with Governor Smith. They claim that
' he is better trained to initiate policy, be
! cause of his superior economic training
and foreign experience. With regard to
the former we can do no better than to
quote a letter written on November 8,
1918, to McAdoo by Mr. R. C. Leffing
well, then assistant secretary of the
Treasury and now a partner of the house
of Morgan, and therefore of unquestioned
financial ability. The following is what
he had to say about an extension of
Hoover's power. "We have all read the
President's letter of November 6 about
Belgium and your memorandum of No
vember 8 concerning it. Hoover has not
been in touch with Rathbone and me. He
never is except when he wants us to pull
his chestnuts out of the fire. Hoover
knows nothing about finance, nothing
about exchange and nothing about ec
onomics. The treasury ought not to have
been placed in the position of seeking
guidance about such subjects from Hoov
er who has never failed to be wrong
wherever his duties confronted him with
problems of that nature."
At this time it must be remembered
that Hoover was not affiliated with the
Republican party.
in regard to foreign affairs it will be
conceded that the principal duty of the
president is the shaping of broad and
general policies. It is the duty of the
department of state to carry on the ne
gotiations, Therefore, it is rash to assert
that Mr. Hoover's work in regard to food
relief would be of great service to him
in solving the foreign problems that con
front the president of the United States.
It is rather the respective party platforms
that we must look to for a guide as to
how the foreign affairs will be handled
in the next four years. This will be taken
up in another article.

finances of the state handled under the
executive budget which he inaugurated
that direct taxes have been reduced over
sixty-two per cent during his nine years.
The legislation on crime, including the
Baume's Law, which he secured in New
York State is generally conceded to be
the most effective in the Union for dis
couraging larceny. Yet so progressive is
he that he was not willing to rest on his
laurels and last spring he proposed a plan
which would do away with the archaic
common law system of sentencing socially
defectives with reference only to the
crime committed and not to the problem
of making them fit for society. He pro
posed that the criminals should be sen
tenced by a board of trained psychia
trists and criminologists.
Thus we see that Governor Smith is
not lacking in ability to initiate progress
ive legislation. Now let us analyse his
most applauded feat, the reorganization
of the state government of New York,
paying special attention to his ability in
bringing men to his point of view. In
1920 he proposed an amendment for con
solidating 187 different departments and
bureaus of the executive branch of the
government into 18 logical divisions. This
was passed, but under the New York law
such an amendment must pass two suc
cessive senates. In 1921 under a Repub
lican governor it was defeated. Smith
made it a campaign issue in 1922 and had
it passed in 1923. It was again passed in
1925 and became a law.
Smith has been a bitter foe of reaction
ary legislation as he has been a friend of
progressive legislation. In 1919 the leg
islature passed a law curtailing the free
dom of speech. Smith vetoed it, but it
passed again under his Republican suc
cessor. Smith then stumped the state and
secured its repeal when lie became gov
ernor in 1923. He never bows before
opposition.
He has obtained for the State of New
York the services of the ablest men in
their respective lines. Working under
him arc to be found Jew, Protestant, and
Catholic, Democrat, Republican and So
cialist. In fact in his present cabinet of
fourteen members there arc eight Re
publicans and two Independents. As a
result of the efforts of New York State's
able servants its institutions serve as a
model for those of other states. Smith
is indeed a master of applied political
science.
Let us now consider Mr. Hoover's
qualifications with reference to this same
outline. Even his supporters admit that
as a popular leader he cannot compare

I with Governor Smith. They claim that
' he is better trained to initiate policy, be
! cause of his superior economic training
and foreign experience. With regard to
the former we can do no better than to
quote a letter written on November 8,
1918, to McAdoo by Mr. R. C. Leffing
well, then assistant secretary of the
Treasury and now a partner of the house
of Morgan, and therefore of unquestioned
financial ability. The following is what
he had to say about an extension of
Hoover's power. "We have all read the
President's letter of November 6 about
Belgium and your memorandum of No
vember 8 concerning it. Hoover has not
been in touch with Rathbone and me. He
never is except when he wants us to pull
his chestnuts out of the fire. Hoover
knows nothing about finance, nothing
about exchange and nothing about ec
onomics. The treasury ought not to have
been placed in the position of seeking
guidance about such subjects from Hoov
er who has never failed to be wrong
wherever his duties confronted him with
problems of that nature."
At this time it must be remembered
that Hoover was not affiliated with the
Republican party.
in regard to foreign affairs it will be
conceded that the principal duty of the
president is the shaping of broad and
general policies. It is the duty of the
department of state to carry on the ne
gotiations, Therefore, it is rash to assert
that Mr. Hoover's work in regard to food
relief would be of great service to him
in solving the foreign problems that con
front the president of the United States.
It is rather the respective party platforms
that we must look to for a guide as to
how the foreign affairs will be handled
in the next four years. This will be taken
up in another article.
(Herewith is printed the second article
in favor of the candidacy of Governor
Smith for President.)

In our first article we pointed out that
the purpose of this election is the choice
of a party, and that party desirability is
a matter of three things, e.g., its past
record, its leader, and its platform. We
contrasted in some detail the past records
of the two parties and since no effective
attempt was made to answer that point,
we shall regard it as proven. It is the
purpose of this article, then, to fonsider
Governor Smith in detail as a political
scientist or exf>ert politician. In subse
quent articles we shall consider the issues
and party platforms: farm relief, water
power, Governor Smith's proposal for
continuing the experiment on alcoholic
control begun under President Wilson,
and foreign policy. In short the contrast
between the two parties, we feel, is one of
past record, present leadership and future
program. We are now on the second of
these three points.
On careful analysis it would seem that
. {he qualities njy.st desirable in a president
are: (1) an ability to originate ideas, (2)
an ability to lead men, as it is essential for
him to do this in order to have his ideas
embodied in legislation of congress, and
(3) the ability to choose able subordinates.
Governor Smith has been one of the
few men in public life who has kept
abreast of the times in proposals for legist
lation. I)jrPclTy after the war there was
a gTffat deal of misery among the poor of
New York City on account of the short
age of housing facilities and the ex
orbitant rents that were being charged.
Smith recommended and had passed
effective emergency rent laws and an
amendment to the constitution permitting
cities to exempt certain classes of tene
ments from taxation. In 1926 a commis
sion which he had appointed for the pur
pose of recommending laws to encourage
the building of model tenements reported
and had passed a law by which the land
lord whose tenement fulfilled certain
sanitary and housing requirements and
netted him less than 6 per cent should
be partially exempt from taxation and
have the right of eminent domain over
undesirable tenement properly. Contrast
Governor Smith's handling of this crisis
with the Republican bungling of the farm
relief problem.
In 1919 he called a special session of
the legislature to pass the Woman Suff
rage Amendment. He advocated and had
passed a bill to encourage and permit co
operative marketing of farm products. He
encouraged and signed a bond issue of
$50,000,000 for new state institutions for
the care of state wards. The work in
education of Governor Smith's admin
istration is worthy of special praise. In
the nine years that he has been Governor
of the state, appropriations for public
schools increased from $11,554,597 to
$83,332,823, yet so efficiently were the
finances of the state handled under the

of Morgan, and therefore of unquestioned
financial ability. The following is what
he had to say about an extension of
Hoover's power. "We have all read the
President's letter of November 6 about
Belgium and your memorandum of No
vember 8 concerning it. Hoover has not
been in touch with Rathbone and me. He
never is except when he wants us to pull
his chestnuts out of the fire. Hoover
knows nothing about finance, nothing
about exchange and nothing about ec
onomics. The treasury ought not to have
been placed in the position of seeking
guidance about such subjects from Hoov
er who has never failed to be wrong
wherever his duties confronted him with
problems of that nature."
At this time it must be remembered
that Hoover was not affiliated with the
Republican party.
in regard to foreign affairs it will be
conceded that the principal duty of the
president is the shaping of broad and
general policies. It is the duty of the
department of state to carry on the ne
gotiations, Therefore, it is rash to assert
that Mr. Hoover's work in regard to food
relief would be of great service to him
in solving the foreign problems that con
front the president of the United States.
It is rather the respective party platforms
that we must look to for a guide as to
how the foreign affairs will be handled
in the next four years. This will be taken
up in another article.
(Herewith is printed the second article
in favor of the candidacy of Governor
Smith for President.)

In our first article we pointed out that
the purpose of this election is the choice
of a party, and that party desirability is
a matter of three things, e.g., its past
record, its leader, and its platform. We
contrasted in some detail the past records
of the two parties and since no effective
attempt was made to answer that point,
we shall regard it as proven. It is the
purpose of this article, then, to fonsider
Governor Smith in detail as a political
scientist or exf>ert politician. In subse
quent articles we shall consider the issues
and party platforms: farm relief, water
power, Governor Smith's proposal for
continuing the experiment on alcoholic
control begun under President Wilson,
and foreign policy. In short the contrast
between the two parties, we feel, is one of
past record, present leadership and future
program. We are now on the second of
these three points.
On careful analysis it would seem that
. {he qualities njy.st desirable in a president
are: (1) an ability to originate ideas, (2)
an ability to lead men, as it is essential for
him to do this in order to have his ideas
embodied in legislation of congress, and
(3) the ability to choose able subordinates.
Governor Smith has been one of the
few men in public life who has kept
abreast of the times in proposals for legist
lation. I)jrPclTy after the war there was
a gTffat deal of misery among the poor of
New York City on account of the short
age of housing facilities and the ex
orbitant rents that were being charged.
Smith recommended and had passed
effective emergency rent laws and an
amendment to the constitution permitting
cities to exempt certain classes of tene
ments from taxation. In 1926 a commis
sion which he had appointed for the pur
pose of recommending laws to encourage
the building of model tenements reported
and had passed a law by which the land
lord whose tenement fulfilled certain
sanitary and housing requirements and
netted him less than 6 per cent should
be partially exempt from taxation and
have the right of eminent domain over
undesirable tenement properly. Contrast
Governor Smith's handling of this crisis
with the Republican bungling of the farm
relief problem.
In 1919 he called a special session of
the legislature to pass the Woman Suff
rage Amendment. He advocated and had
passed a bill to encourage and permit co
operative marketing of farm products. He
encouraged and signed a bond issue of
$50,000,000 for new state institutions for
the care of state wards. The work in
education of Governor Smith's admin
istration is worthy of special praise. In
the nine years that he has been Governor
of the state, appropriations for public
schools increased from $11,554,597 to
$83,332,823, yet so efficiently were the
finances of the state handled under the
executive budget which he inaugurated
that direct taxes have been reduced over
sixty-two per cent during his nine years.
The legislation on crime, including the
Baume's Law, which he secured in New
York State is generally conceded to be
the most effective in the Union for dis
couraging larceny. Yet so progressive is
he that he was not willing to rest on his
laurels and last spring he proposed a plan
which would do away with the archaic
common law system of sentencing socially
defectives with reference only to the
crime committed and not to the problem
of making them fit for society. He pro
posed that the criminals should be sen
tenced by a board of trained psychia
trists and criminologists.
Thus we see that Governor Smith is
not lacking in ability to initiate progress
ive legislation. Now let us analyse his
most applauded feat, the reorganization
of the state government of New York,
paying special attention to his ability in
bringing men to his point of view. In
1920 he proposed an amendment for con
solidating 187 different departments and
bureaus of the executive branch of the
government into 18 logical divisions. This
was passed, but under the New York law
such an amendment must pass two suc
cessive senates. In 1921 under a Repub
lican governor it was defeated. Smith
made it a campaign issue in 1922 and had
it passed in 1923. It was again passed in
1925 and became a law.
Smith has been a bitter foe of reaction
ary legislation as he has been a friend of
progressive legislation. In 1919 the leg
islature passed a law curtailing the free
dom of speech. Smith vetoed it, but it
passed again under his Republican suc
cessor. Smith then stumped the state and
secured its repeal when lie became gov
ernor in 1923. He never bows before
opposition.
He has obtained for the State of New
York the services of the ablest men in
their respective lines. Working under
him arc to be found Jew, Protestant, and
Catholic, Democrat, Republican and So
cialist. In fact in his present cabinet of
fourteen members there arc eight Re
publicans and two Independents. As a
result of the efforts of New York State's
able servants its institutions serve as a
model for those of other states. Smith
is indeed a master of applied political
science.
Let us now consider Mr. Hoover's
qualifications with reference to this same
outline. Even his supporters admit that
as a popular leader he cannot compare

I with Governor Smith. They claim that
' he is better trained to initiate policy, be
! cause of his superior economic training
and foreign experience. With regard to
the former we can do no better than to
quote a letter written on November 8,
1918, to McAdoo by Mr. R. C. Leffing
well, then assistant secretary of the
Treasury and now a partner of the house
of Morgan, and therefore of unquestioned
financial ability. The following is what
he had to say about an extension of
Hoover's power. "We have all read the

orbitant rents that were being charged.
Smith recommended and had passed
effective emergency rent laws and an
amendment to the constitution permitting
cities to exempt certain classes of tene
ments from taxation. In 1926 a commis
sion which he had appointed for the pur
pose of recommending laws to encourage
the building of model tenements reported
and had passed a law by which the land
lord whose tenement fulfilled certain
sanitary and housing requirements and
netted him less than 6 per cent should
be partially exempt from taxation and
have the right of eminent domain over
undesirable tenement properly. Contrast
Governor Smith's handling of this crisis
with the Republican bungling of the farm
relief problem.
In 1919 he called a special session of
the legislature to pass the Woman Suff
rage Amendment. He advocated and had
passed a bill to encourage and permit co
operative marketing of farm products. He
encouraged and signed a bond issue of
$50,000,000 for new state institutions for
the care of state wards. The work in
education of Governor Smith's admin
istration is worthy of special praise. In
the nine years that he has been Governor
of the state, appropriations for public
schools increased from $11,554,597 to
$83,332,823, yet so efficiently were the
finances of the state handled under the
executive budget which he inaugurated
that direct taxes have been reduced over
sixty-two per cent during his nine years.
The legislation on crime, including the
Baume's Law, which he secured in New
York State is generally conceded to be
the most effective in the Union for dis
couraging larceny. Yet so progressive is
he that he was not willing to rest on his
laurels and last spring he proposed a plan
which would do away with the archaic
common law system of sentencing socially
defectives with reference only to the
crime committed and not to the problem
of making them fit for society. He pro
posed that the criminals should be sen
tenced by a board of trained psychia
trists and criminologists.
Thus we see that Governor Smith is
not lacking in ability to initiate progress
ive legislation. Now let us analyse his
most applauded feat, the reorganization
of the state government of New York,
paying special attention to his ability in
bringing men to his point of view. In
1920 he proposed an amendment for con
solidating 187 different departments and
bureaus of the executive branch of the
government into 18 logical divisions. This
was passed, but under the New York law
such an amendment must pass two suc
cessive senates. In 1921 under a Repub
lican governor it was defeated. Smith
made it a campaign issue in 1922 and had
it passed in 1923. It was again passed in
1925 and became a law.
Smith has been a bitter foe of reaction
ary legislation as he has been a friend of
progressive legislation. In 1919 the leg
islature passed a law curtailing the free
dom of speech. Smith vetoed it, but it
passed again under his Republican suc
cessor. Smith then stumped the state and
secured its repeal when lie became gov
ernor in 1923. He never bows before
opposition.
He has obtained for the State of New
York the services of the ablest men in
their respective lines. Working under
him arc to be found Jew, Protestant, and
Catholic, Democrat, Republican and So
cialist. In fact in his present cabinet of
fourteen members there arc eight Re
publicans and two Independents. As a
result of the efforts of New York State's
able servants its institutions serve as a
model for those of other states. Smith
is indeed a master of applied political
science.
Let us now consider Mr. Hoover's
qualifications with reference to this same
outline. Even his supporters admit that
as a popular leader he cannot compare

I with Governor Smith. They claim that
' he is better trained to initiate policy, be
! cause of his superior economic training
and foreign experience. With regard to
the former we can do no better than to
quote a letter written on November 8,
1918, to McAdoo by Mr. R. C. Leffing
well, then assistant secretary of the
Treasury and now a partner of the house
of Morgan, and therefore of unquestioned
financial ability. The following is what
he had to say about an extension of
Hoover's power. "We have all read the
President's letter of November 6 about
Belgium and your memorandum of No
vember 8 concerning it. Hoover has not
been in touch with Rathbone and me. He
never is except when he wants us to pull
his chestnuts out of the fire. Hoover
knows nothing about finance, nothing
about exchange and nothing about ec
onomics. The treasury ought not to have
been placed in the position of seeking
guidance about such subjects from Hoov
er who has never failed to be wrong
wherever his duties confronted him with
problems of that nature."
At this time it must be remembered
that Hoover was not affiliated with the
Republican party.
in regard to foreign affairs it will be
conceded that the principal duty of the
president is the shaping of broad and
general policies. It is the duty of the
department of state to carry on the ne
gotiations, Therefore, it is rash to assert
that Mr. Hoover's work in regard to food
relief would be of great service to him
in solving the foreign problems that con
front the president of the United States.
It is rather the respective party platforms
that we must look to for a guide as to
how the foreign affairs will be handled
in the next four years. This will be taken
up in another article.
(Herewith is printed the second article
in favor of the candidacy of Governor
Smith for President.)

In our first article we pointed out that
the purpose of this election is the choice
of a party, and that party desirability is
a matter of three things, e.g., its past
record, its leader, and its platform. We
contrasted in some detail the past records
of the two parties and since no effective
attempt was made to answer that point,
we shall regard it as proven. It is the
purpose of this article, then, to fonsider
Governor Smith in detail as a political
scientist or exf>ert politician. In subse
quent articles we shall consider the issues
and party platforms: farm relief, water
power, Governor Smith's proposal for
continuing the experiment on alcoholic
control begun under President Wilson,
and foreign policy. In short the contrast
between the two parties, we feel, is one of
past record, present leadership and future
program. We are now on the second of
these three points.
On careful analysis it would seem that
. {he qualities njy.st desirable in a president
are: (1) an ability to originate ideas, (2)
an ability to lead men, as it is essential for
him to do this in order to have his ideas
embodied in legislation of congress, and
(3) the ability to choose able subordinates.
Governor Smith has been one of the
few men in public life who has kept
abreast of the times in proposals for legist
lation. I)jrPclTy after the war there was
a gTffat deal of misery among the poor of
New York City on account of the short
age of housing facilities and the ex
