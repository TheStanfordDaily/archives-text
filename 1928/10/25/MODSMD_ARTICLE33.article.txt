The Editor, Sir:
In corroboration of recent criticism
of the Czaristic regime of the B.A.C.
the writer has the following grievance
to air:
The action of the B.A.C. in switch
ing the Idaho game to the Kezar sta
dium is quite incomprehensible. The
; reason given out was "To make more
| money." Surely Stanford, despite in
j creased tuition fees, is not so poor as
to have to rely upon the generosity
of San Francisco's sporting public for
support of its athletic events. The
1 smallness and inertia of the crowd
reflected the interest in this near-pro
fessional appeal for dollars.
The inconvenience of the time for
distribution of rooters' tickets works
a hardship on many students who
i have afternoon classes or other
duties; two afternoons, months in ad
vance of the game, do not ofler proper
facilities for obtaining tickets.
When 1 personal inquiries are made
at the B.A.C. office, curt and oft-times
misleading replies are given, and in
several instances discourteous if not
insulting ones.
After all, the B.A.C. "non-profit or
ganization," is a part of Stanford Uni
versity, and is supposed to exist for
the help and service of the students.
Why not have a little more of it?
Let's get on the boat!!!

The Editor, Sir:
Last night as I was passing the
long distance phone booth in Toyon
Hall I heard the bell ring and an

swered it. The operator told me a man
had called a number (I have it) and
cs he had talked over his time limit
was so informed by the operator. Evi
dently, business elsewhere demanded
his prompt attention.
To make this letter short I will say
that I paid the five cents. Perhaps
you will call me a d n fool for
doing so but that telephone is very
useful here and I for one want it
kept in the hall.
Five cents is very little —it is the
impression that lingers. I hope the
chap who called that number really
forgot to pay for a service which
means so much to all of us in the hall.
Thinking it over I am glad I paid
that five-cent piece—the lesson was
worth five dollars. —J. R. U.

Contributions to the West Indies
hurricane relief fund totaled more
than $3,500,000.
