# INTERCLASS GRID TEAMS PREPARE FOR TWO TILTS
## 
### 
Following the opening games last
week-end, interclass grid teams are
preparing for the two contests this
week with stiff workouts. The four
teams that appeared in games all ap
peared of equal strength. The fresh
man team takes the lead in the rating
with one win. The sophomores were
defeated and the seniors and juniors
played to a scoreless tie.
Despite the fact that seniors were
conceded the title in the first inter
class sport due to their victory last
year, a fighting junior team played
them to a standstill. Opening up a
drive of Warner reverses and lateral
passes they completely outplayed the
seniors.
A light but fast freshman team
showed up the sophomores in their
first contest last Saturday which puts
them in line for the title. A close
game is expected by their followers
Saturday when they meet the seniors.
The senior-sophomore game next
Monday will be important in decid
ing the upperclassmen's chances of
finishing the season undefeated. Al
though the sophomores have already
suffered one defeat, they expect to be
100 per cent stronger by next week.
The seniors will outweigh their oppon
ents but the sophomores expect to
win the game with a strong passing
attack which they are now develop
ing. On the defense they will center
their attention on Fox, heavy senior
fullback.
