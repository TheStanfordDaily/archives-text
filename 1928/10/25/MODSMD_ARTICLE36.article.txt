# "GREYS" IN FIRST TEST SATURDAY AGAINST SAINTS
## 
### 
Next Saturday morning the "greys"
â– will get a chance to test their ability
when they line up against the Saint
Mary's "goofs" at 10 o'clock in the !
stadium. One of the strongest "grey" ;
outfits ever seen here has been turn- 1
ing out daily for practice, and it is
only the large amount of material on !
hand that keeps a great many of the
boys off the varsity.
May and Carrol have been the out-1
standing backfield players in the last
practice sessions of the "greys." The j
latter has shown by his heady signal j
calling that he has the makings of a i
good quarter, and he has been show- j
ing up well as a pass received. May j
is one of the best interference runners !
on the team. He is also a good open i
field runner and should be a good
ground gainer in next Saturday's con-!
test.
The line seems exceptionally strong.,
Albertson, at center, is a sure, hard !
tackier. Reynolds and Pike are play
ing fine football at the two flank posi
tions, and will offer good protection
to the men carrying the ball. The
play of the whole line is marked by
fast, low charging and good blocking.
Saturday's game will be the first
competition for the "greys" as the
contest scheduled with St. Ignatius
last week was called off because per-1
mission to use Kezar Stadium was'
t
revoked at the last minute.
