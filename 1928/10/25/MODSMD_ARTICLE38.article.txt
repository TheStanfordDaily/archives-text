# DAVIS LECTURES TONIGHT ON U. S. FLOOD CONTROL
## 
### 
"The control of the Mississippi river
is the greatest national engineering
problem of the United States," says
Professor W. M. Davis of the Geology
department, who will talk on the
"Physiographic Features of the Mis
sissippi River" before a joint meeting
tonight of the student chapter (Ameri
can Society of Civil Engineers), and
the civil engineering faculty.
Professor Davis will show a large
bcale map prepared by the Mississippi
River Commission, which has its
headquarters at St. Louis, and which
has been engaged during the past
forty years in gathering facts con
cerning the river, and in controlling it.
"The works which have been con
structed to control the river have
been remarkably successful," says
Professor Davis. "Yet the great floods
now rise higher than ever because
they can't overflow. The question of
additional flood prevention is thus in
troduced. It has been suggested that
if the river curves were straightened
like those on the Middle Rhine in
Europe, the fall of the river would be
increased, which would tend to deepen
the channel. By a faster flow the dis
charge of flood waters could be made
more rapidly, and the height of the
flood decreased.
"The difficulty in straightening the
river is that it may get out of con
trol during the process of change,"
Profesor Davis believes. "That is the
reason why the present system of
control has been adopted."
