# SPORTS OF 1928
## That Flash—French! 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Harvard seems to be in for better
tilings this year, in a gridiron way.
One reason is that Arthur French,
captain of the 1928 varsity, is quite
a football player, and he is ably aided
and abetted by such young stalwarts
as Gilligan, Harper, and Guaranaccia
—who are other reasons. Then, Har
vard has incorporated the forward
pass into its attack as an offensive
weapon this season for the first time,
and, what is more, knows how to use
it. Also, the team is showing quite
an aggressive spirit.
But to get back to Arthur French,
who is a sprinter and broad-jumper of
no mean ability in the springtime. As
captain of the Harvard team this
year, he is playing a game plenty
good enough to inspire his men to
greater deeds themselves. Against

North Carolina he was brilliant, and
hia playing in every department of
the game marked him as one of the
best triple-threat men in the East.
From the time he caught the opening
kick-off on his own goal-line and ran
it back forty yards, he was consistent
ly good, and his hard running off
tackle, around the ends, and through
center was almost unstoppable. He
also passed and kicked well.
Other sprinters have succeeded on
the gridiron before French: Roland
Locke, of Nebraska; Bowman and
Darbuti, of Syracuse; Craig, of Michi
gan, and so forth; but unlike most
track men who take up football the
Harvard captain does not slow up
when he is about to be tackled. He
is the football player first and the
runner afterwards, and so does not
unconsciously try to protect his legs.
