# FROSH GRIDDERS FACE SOUTHERN TEAM SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman grldders ran
i off their plays with such regularity 1
i and speed yesterday afternoon that
j it looks as if they had gotten back
I into their stride and will send the:
same smooth-working machine against
j the Southern All-Stars next Saturday
; that faced the Pasadena Junior Col
! lege two weeks ago. Though display
| ing plenty of power in their 19 to 0
| victory over the St. Mary's frosh last
: week, the teamwork was ragged in
j places.
Coaches Husky Hunt and Rabbit:
j Bradshaw ran their charges through ;
| the entire set of plays yesterday in J
j observance of the rule that repetition j
| leads to perfection. Some variations
were worked into several of the plays, j
and a few more ball-carrying tricks I

will be on exhibit Saturday.
The coach of the Southern AH Stars
scouted the freshman game here last
week, and his team will invade th»>
Farm prepared to break up the Stan
ford system. Five other teams have
tried that this season, and the re
sults have been a tie and four over
whelming victories for the Card year
lings.
There is little probability of Rudy
Rintala, fast freshman left halfback,
getting into the All Star game, the in
jury received in the Gael contest be
ing sufficient to keep him on tho
bench for several days more. Phil
Wilson, regular right halfback,
worked out in Rintala's placo yester
day and will probably start in thin
position Saturday. Cadell, who ha«
played in most of the games thiw
year at either right halfback or full
back, will replace Wilson. Cadell can
kick, pass, and carry the ball through
the line or around the ends and looks
like varsity material.
