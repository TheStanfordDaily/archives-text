### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 24. (/P) — Charles
Jivans Hughes, in his second speech in
behalf of the candidacy of Herbert
Hoover, declared here tonight that the
political aims of the great majority of i
the American people could be summed
up broadly in the words "prosperity and
progress."
"Progress demands stability, patience j
in dealing with problems on their merits,
ihe search for the practical way, the .
talent to recognize it and leadership in i
pursuing it," he declared.
"1 f I were asked to name the man who
'in my judgment is the leading Progress
ive of today, I should name the Republi
can candidate for President, Herbert
Hoover. To think progressively, that is,
toward betterment, to plan to achieve
something worth while by practical meth
ods in the interest of the American
jK'ople, is as natural to him as to breathe."
Increased Prosperity
Mr. Hughes said much had been done
in this campaign in an effort to belittle
the "prosperity we enjoy," but he would
not discuss it.
"With our roads filled with motor cars,
with our savings hank deposits increased
in the past seven years and a half from
J 5 to 26 billions of dollars, there is little
j iced to argue the point," he said.
The government can help in maintain
ing and extending prosperity by economy,
by protection to American interests
by adequate tariff, by the extension
through internal improvements of the fa
cilities of transportation, and by giving
the co-operation of government to co
operative endeavors, Mr. Hughes de

clarcd. It was to these four subjects, j
economy, tariff, transportation and co- I
operation, that Mr. Hughes devoted much j
of his speech.
As to progress, Mr. Hughes said the j
Republican nominee's "whole bent is in I
devising improvements and in seeking a 1
more abundant life for all."
