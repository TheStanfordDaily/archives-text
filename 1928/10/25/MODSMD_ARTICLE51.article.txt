# STIFF WIND DETAINS ZEPPELIN IN HANGAR
## 
### 
LAKEHURST, N.J., Oct. 24. (/P)â€”
i Wind-locked in the navy hangar the
German Graf Zeppelin was in readi
: ness tonight to heave itself into the
air at a moment's notice on its pro
i jeeted flight to the Middlewest.
It had been iioped that the stiff
breeze sweeping across the hangar
doors all day would die down at dusk
and permit departure at that time but
instead the wind freshened to such
a point that navy officers feared an
attempt to remove the greatest of all
airships to the open might result in
its being torn apart against the
i hangar's wall.
