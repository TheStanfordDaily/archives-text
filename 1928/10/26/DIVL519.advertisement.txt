"Went Scotch"
Minneapolis, Minn.
April 30, 1928

Richmond, Va.
Dear Sirs:
Two years ago last winter I went
into the lied Lake gold fields in
Canada. It was a tough trail from
Hudson, over 140 miles of snow and
ice. There were fourteen of us on the
trail going in, and frequently at night
when seated around a big camp fire,
some one would ask me for a pipeful
of Edgeworth. These Canadian boys
sure like our Edgeworth.
In four weeks' time I ran out of
Edgeworth. I was glad to get 'most
any old tobacco.
One day, however, I dropped in to
Dad Brown's tent, a 72-year-old pros- ;
pector, and seeing a can of Edgeworth
on an improvised table, back there 150
miles from the "steel," I perked up at
once, saying, "Dad, I'm plum out of
tobacco—how's chances for a pipe
ful?" "Ilelp yourself," he said. So
pulling my heavy duty pipe from my
pocket, I loaded it with Edgeworth,
packing it in so tightly that 1 couldn't
get the least bit of a draw.
I excused myself for a moment, and
stepped outside to remove about three
pipefuls to put in my pouch. Dad
stepped out, saying, "You're worse
than any Scotchman I ever saw."
Then I confessed. I told him what
happened to my Edgeworth —that I |
was just dying for a smoke, and he
understood right away. He said,
"Boy, Edgeworth is mighty scarce in
these parts, but I reckon I can spare
what's left of that can. Help yourself."
You can just >et your last nickel
that I guarded this Edgeworth with
extreme care until I got back to the
"steel."
Yours very truly,

Dear Sirs:
Two years ago last winter I went
into the lied Lake gold fields in
Canada. It was a tough trail from
Hudson, over 140 miles of snow and
ice. There were fourteen of us on the
trail going in, and frequently at night
when seated around a big camp fire,
some one would ask me for a pipeful
of Edgeworth. These Canadian boys
sure like our Edgeworth.
In four weeks' time I ran out of
Edgeworth. I was glad to get 'most
any old tobacco.
One day, however, I dropped in to
Dad Brown's tent, a 72-year-old pros- ;
pector, and seeing a can of Edgeworth
on an improvised table, back there 150
miles from the "steel," I perked up at
once, saying, "Dad, I'm plum out of
tobacco—how's chances for a pipe
ful?" "Ilelp yourself," he said. So
pulling my heavy duty pipe from my
pocket, I loaded it with Edgeworth,
packing it in so tightly that 1 couldn't
get the least bit of a draw.
I excused myself for a moment, and
stepped outside to remove about three
pipefuls to put in my pouch. Dad
stepped out, saying, "You're worse
than any Scotchman I ever saw."
Then I confessed. I told him what
happened to my Edgeworth —that I |
was just dying for a smoke, and he
understood right away. He said,
"Boy, Edgeworth is mighty scarce in
these parts, but I reckon I can spare
what's left of that can. Help yourself."
You can just >et your last nickel
that I guarded this Edgeworth with
extreme care until I got back to the
"steel."
Yours very truly,
