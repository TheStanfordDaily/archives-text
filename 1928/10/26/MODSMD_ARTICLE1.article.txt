# STANFORD CLUB WILL WELCOME G.O.P. NOMINEE
## Palo Alto Puts City Honors In Hands of Organization On Campus, States Mayor Hoge 
### 
The city of Palo Alto, by official ac
tion of its council, has placed the city's
welcome to Herbert Hoover in the hands
of the Stanford Hoovcr-for-President
club. This was the announcement of
Mayor Frank Huge of Palo Alto at the
meeting of this organization last night.
The city will place its facilities at the
disposal of and in every way co-operate
with the club, it was announced, but the
direction and control will be entirely in
the hands of the Stanford club.
Stanley Weigel, Stanford graduate and
at present with the Republican State
Speakers' Bureau, made the principal ad
dress of the evening. In his speech he
paid tribute to Smith's integrity and cour
age, but said that Hoover by training
and experience was much better equipped
for the position. He spoke of Hoover's
speeches, pointing out that they were all
constructive and the product of a mind
of broad vision with a solid grasp of
facts. Hoover's philosophy of govern
ment, he declared, was "First, to secure
and guarantee equal opportunity for all;
and second, to stimulate and encourage
every individual to make the most of his
opportunities."
World Affairs Discussed
Turning to international relations, he
emphasized the growing importance of
world affairs and the problem of our
foreign trade. Hoover's training in this
field he declared was unequaled.
The forthcoming debate between the
Hoover and Smith clubs, details of which
are elsewhere in this paper, was discussed.
Plans were formed for holding a Hoover
rally sometime next week with some
prominent Republican such as Kathleen
Norris or John McNab as the principal
speaker. Attention was called to the
coming campus presidential poll and a
large turnout at the polls was urged.
