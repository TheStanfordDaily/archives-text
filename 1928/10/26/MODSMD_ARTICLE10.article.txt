# CARDS PREPARE FOR TILT WITH FRESNO STATE
## First String to Begin Game; Frentrup, Harder To Be In Opening Lineup 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Stanford will entertain Fresno State
in the local Stadium tomorrow after
noon in what, from all appearances,
seems to be a light workout for the
Cardinals, amounting to another step
in preparation for the meeting with
the powerful Thundering Herd in Los
Angeles a week from tomorrow.
The Cards, not having scouted the
team from the San Joaquin Valley,
are judging their strength mostly by
its record on the gridiron this season.
This same record does not put the
Staters by any means in the same
class with Stanford. However, recall
ing the upset handed the varsity last
year by Santa Clara, Pop Warner will
have his first string on hand to eject
into the game in time if the un
expected comes to pass.
First String to Start
Warner has said that he intends to
start his first-string team. This lineup
will include Spud Harder in place of
Joe Bush at right end; the remainder
of the team will be the same as that
which started against the Idaho Van
dals last Friday in San Francisco.
Lud Frenturup will be playing at left
half instead of Frank Wilton, the little
speedster who is being saved in the
hope that his injured leg will be
entirely well by the time the Cards
invade Troy.
The meagre word that comes from
behind the sanctum-sanctorum where
the Cards are practicing in' secret in
dicates that the first team will re
main in the game tomorrow for about
ten minutes and will then retire to
allow the second and third elevens to
get into action.
