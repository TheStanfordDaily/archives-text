# No Reduction In Board At Encina Commons Possible Without Change In Quality---Handy
## 
### 
"No reduction in the board at Encina
Commons is possible at the present time
as long as the quality and amount of food
that is being served remains what it is,"
said Miss Etta Handy, director of dining
halls, when approached yesterday con
cerning the board situation of which
members of various eating clubs com
plained at a mass meeting Wednesday
night.
Comptroller A. E. Roth was in Pacific
Grove on business at the Hopkins Marine
Station yesterday and could not be reach
ed at a late hour last night. It was in
timated at his office that he had not yet
learned of the clubmen's complaint.
Food Prices Higher
Miss Handy continud to explain that
the prices of meat and dairy products
had increased so sharply that no reduc
tion could be made.
"If we should resort to such practices
as eating places conducted for profit do
and if the men would consent to eat but
one. standardized portion at each meal,
we could feed them at the old rate," she
said. However, she pointed out that when
previously proposals had been made to
limit the amount of f»x>d served eacli in
dividual, there had been objections raised.
"We are always glad to co-opcratc

with the boys, and arc willing to discuss
the matter with them at any time. Tlie
books and invoices are always open for
inspection."
Careful Accounting Used
Due to the raise in the price of meats
and dairy products, a rise which reaches
an average of 30 per cent for meat and
10 per cent for dairy products, over prices
last fall, the board had to be raised this
quarter. Through a careful system of
cost accounting the costs for the quarter
have been projected into the future and
the present board rate arrived at, Miss
Handy pointed out.
"Should prices decline soon, the excess
money will be refunded at the end of the
quarter," she stated. However, due to
the prevalence of hoof and mouth disease
in the Argentine, the meat will probably
show no decline soon.
At a meeting of the Encina Commons
Board of Control Tuesday night, Comp
troller Roth stated that he believed that
should present prices continue to prevail,
other campus organizations would have
to increase their board rate. Most eat
ing places do not keep close check on
their costs, he pointed out, and that as
soon as the October bills became due a
number of managers will be greatly sur
prised.

we could feed them at the old rate," she
said. However, she pointed out that when
previously proposals had been made to
limit the amount of f»x>d served eacli in
dividual, there had been objections raised.
"We are always glad to co-opcratc

with the boys, and arc willing to discuss
the matter with them at any time. Tlie
books and invoices are always open for
inspection."
Careful Accounting Used
Due to the raise in the price of meats
and dairy products, a rise which reaches
an average of 30 per cent for meat and
10 per cent for dairy products, over prices
last fall, the board had to be raised this
quarter. Through a careful system of
cost accounting the costs for the quarter
have been projected into the future and
the present board rate arrived at, Miss
Handy pointed out.
"Should prices decline soon, the excess
money will be refunded at the end of the
quarter," she stated. However, due to
the prevalence of hoof and mouth disease
in the Argentine, the meat will probably
show no decline soon.
At a meeting of the Encina Commons
Board of Control Tuesday night, Comp
troller Roth stated that he believed that
should present prices continue to prevail,
other campus organizations would have
to increase their board rate. Most eat
ing places do not keep close check on
their costs, he pointed out, and that as
soon as the October bills became due a
number of managers will be greatly sur
prised.
"No reduction in the board at Encina
Commons is possible at the present time
as long as the quality and amount of food
that is being served remains what it is,"
said Miss Etta Handy, director of dining
halls, when approached yesterday con
cerning the board situation of which
members of various eating clubs com
plained at a mass meeting Wednesday
night.
Comptroller A. E. Roth was in Pacific
Grove on business at the Hopkins Marine
Station yesterday and could not be reach
ed at a late hour last night. It was in
timated at his office that he had not yet
learned of the clubmen's complaint.
Food Prices Higher
Miss Handy continud to explain that
the prices of meat and dairy products
had increased so sharply that no reduc
tion could be made.
"If we should resort to such practices
as eating places conducted for profit do
and if the men would consent to eat but
one. standardized portion at each meal,
we could feed them at the old rate," she
said. However, she pointed out that when
previously proposals had been made to
limit the amount of f»x>d served eacli in
