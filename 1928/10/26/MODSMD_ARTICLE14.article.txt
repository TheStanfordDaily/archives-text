# EMERSON NAMES DEBATING SQUAD FOR FALL MEETS
## Arguments Scheduled With U.C., U.S.C., St. Ignatius, College of Pacific 
### 
Members of the teams which will de
bate California, U. S. C., St. Ignatius,
and the College of the Pacific on political
topics were named late yesterday after
noon by Professor J. G. Emerson, debate
coach. All of these meetings will be
away from Stanford. The first of the
series will be in Berkeley on the night
of November 1 and the others will occur
on November 5, the night before election.
Leon Carlcy, Republican, and Wadieh
Shibley, Democrat, will meet the Cali
fornia team in Berkeley Thursday eve
ning, November 1. Irving Rosenblatt,
; Democrat, and Robert McClintock, Re
publican, are to make the trip to U.S.C.
lor the debate on November 5.
W. L. Shaw, Republican, and Virgil
j Whitakcr, Democrat, arc to meet the St.
| Ignatius squad in San Francisco Novem
| her 5. Arthur Angel, Democrat, is al
; tcrnate on this team.
Charles Prael, Republican, and Pardee
Lowe, Democrat, with Paul Herbold, Re
publican, as alternate will debate the Col
lege of the Pacific in Stockton on the
evening of November 5 also.
All of the debates are to be split team
contests with the exception of the Stock-
Iton meeting. The Stanford men are not
j to work together but to join forces with
I the debater affiliated with their respec
tive parties wherever they may be. In
this combination they are to oppose one
another on the platform.
However, at the College of the Pa
cific contest, a three-cornerer debate will
result due to the fact that two Stock
ton men arc to speak for Norman
Thomas, Socialist presidential candi
date, and one Stanford man will speak
j for Hoover while the other is to argue
the case for Smith.
The selections made yesterday were
on a basis of the appearances the men
have been making at squad meetings for
the past two weeks. There will be an
other meeting of the squad on Monday.
There is likelihood of a four-man
team being sent to California and if that
is the case, Prael and Whitakcr will be
taken from the teams on which they have
been placed and Herbold and Angel will
take their places respectively. Daily an
nouncements are to be posted at Pro
fessor Emerson's offices, room 200C, for
the debaters.
