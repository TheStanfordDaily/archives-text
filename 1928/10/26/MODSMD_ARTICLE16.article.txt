# TOUCH FOOTBALL BEGINS TUESDAY; SCHEDULES MADE
## 
### 
Touch football, Stanford's newest
intramural sport, will officially get
under way Tuesday when five games
are scheduled to be played. Charles
Davis, director of intramural sports,
has drawn up rules and arranged a
schedule. Twenty-one organizations
have entered teams.
Rules governing regular football
will apply except in a few special
cases. Seven men will constitute a
team and at least three of these men
must play on the line of scrimmage.
However, any one of the seven will
be eligible to receive a pass. It will
be necessary to gain ten yards in
four downs as usual.
Teams on Waiting List
Any team that is now entered and
wishes to withdraw, may do so by
notifying Davis, as there are several
additional clubs desiring to enter
competition.
According to Davis, men are needed
to officiate the games. Experienced
referees should interview him.
Following is the schedule for the
first two days of play. In addition to
the teams represented below, Theta
Chi and Theta Xi have drawn byes.
