# SENIOR GLASS ACTS TO SAVE HONOR SYSTEM
## Public Announcement To Be Made in Classes When Upperclassmen See Cheating Afoot 
### 
The first action of any large group
yet taken in the present campaign to
strengthen the honor system was taken
last night by the Senior Class, which
passed a motion setting forth the pro
cedure to be followed by its members
when they see cheating occurring in a
class room.
Following is the motion:
"Any member of the Senior Class
seeing another person cheating will rise
and publicly say: 'Someone is cheat
ing in this room.' Upon failure of this
statement to gain effect, definite action
will be taken.
"The Senior Class desires that all
fair-minded students of the University
co-operate in this matter."
Last night's meeting was attended by
about 75 members of the class, with Pres
ident Richard Holt presiding. There was
little sentiment evidenced against the
strong stand which the class finally took
toward the enforcement of honor in class
rooms, the general opinion seeming to be
that once the precedent of open denuncia
tion is set, it will thereafter be followed
whenever the occasion demands.
