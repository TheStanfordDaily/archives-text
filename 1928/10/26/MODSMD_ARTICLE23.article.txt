# An Obstacle Removed
## 
### 
The class of 1929 has pushed aside one of the most formidable ob
stacles in the path of the honor system. "What should I do when I see
a student cheating?" is the question which always has to be answered
before honor as an institution in the class room can be enforced, and the
seniors, in their meeting last night, flatly answered it. They declared :
"Any member of the Senior Class seeing another person cheat
ing will arise and publicly say: 'someone is cheating in this room.'
Upon failure of this statement to gain effect, definite action will
be taken.
"The Senior Class desires that all fair-minded students of the
University co-operate in this matter."
Simple and to the point is this decision, and if it is carried out, soon
there will grow up a certain course of procedure by which a student
catching sight of incipient or actual cheating may make known the fact
that he has seen cheating going on and wants to see it stopped.
The Seniors were acting in their traditional role as guardians and
sponsors of the honor system when they took their courageous action last
night, and since they have had the temerity to set so bold a pace, it is now
the duty of the other undergraduate classes (and of holdovers and gradu
ates also) to follow their track.
We are on a fair way toward the building up of a strong opinion
against the mentally rotten and morally maimed who try to ease through
at the expense of the rest of us. The cry of distress has been heard, and
the honor system will be saved.
