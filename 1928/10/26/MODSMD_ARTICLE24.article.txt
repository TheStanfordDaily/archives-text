This is addressed to J. R. U. who, in yesterday's Campus Opinion
told, rather shamefacedly, how he heard a telephone bell ringing in Toyon
Hall, answered it, and paid the nickel which the operator was clamoring
for and which the previous user had failed to deposit.
There may be 110 re-imbursement, J. R. U., for that five cents, but
you have called attention to a sort of person whom every man in the
halls that values the phone service must be 011 the lookout for—that petty
scissor-bill, the telephone cheater.
We can't imagine anyone deriving any pleasure from a date he got
by cheating a telephone. Couldn't the hall clubs install small change boxes
in the telephone booths, so that these poor students, doubtless deserving
of charity, may complete their calls, without forcing J. R. U.'s to go
around after them and pay the remainder of the tolls?
