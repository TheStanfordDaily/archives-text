The Encina Commons fight seems to be deadlocked, with Miss Handy
asserting that she is doing all she can to meet the conflicting demands
made by the freshmen and eating club members, and the protesters still
assuring all hands that they are unsatisfied, and are thinking of walking
out.
The eating clubs say thev want better meals than they are getting;
they expect these because they are paying an increased board. Directors
of the Commons say that in serving the present fare they are barely
breaking even between costs and receipts. Freshmen, notorious week-end
stay-at-homes, want Encina food seven days a week.
If it is true that Encina is only breaking even on the present table
it is setting, then the members of the eating clubs have no comeback, be
cause it is obviously impossible to serve them better food at the same
price. It would be just as impossible to give the freshmen meals on the
seventh day, without raising the board. All any of the factions can do
is to sit tight and remember that the present Encina is probably as good
as, or (more likely) better than, it ever has been before.
In time, perhaps reductions in cost of operating the Commons could
be effected by cutting down 011 the breakfast service. Encina breakfasts
are unusually bountiful; let them be "leaned" a little. Cafeteria break
fasts, where some of that heartless material they pass out at the Union
is served, might be the solution.
Whatever the immediate upshot of the fight is the Daily hopes that
all factions will bear with the present system. If all of them would re
member that they pay as much as they do because the University demands
that they be given the best of everything, they might find their dinners
better than they suppose.
