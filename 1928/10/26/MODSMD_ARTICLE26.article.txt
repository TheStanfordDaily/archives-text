THE UNTHINKING MASSES
A certain lethargy hangs over Stan
ford like a pall. It's as easy to get an
idea started here as it is to move a
mountain. Most students seem afraid
to think, or express themselves when
they have indulged in the unusual
effort.
There is a lack of initiative, a lack
of expression of opinion, a general
stagnancy, an attitude of indifference
that typifies the rank and file. A
group pressure that seems to stifle
individuality in thought. A blind ac
ceptance of the ways of doing things
just because they are being done. A
doing what the other fellow does,
without questioning the cause or the
reason for it.
No Group Thought
Stanford students are supposedly
intelligent. More so, it is rumored,
than other ordinary college people.
Yet there is this noticeable lack of
intelligent group thinking. Most sug
gestions, most change in present stu
dent customs originate not by pres
sure of student opinion but, by the
few "student leaders," at the top.
A few individual thinkers there are.
There is the chronic "griper," if he
may be considered in this category,
who finds fault all around, but makes
no suggestions as to betterment of

existing conditions. He registers com
plaints against the 8.A.C., tlie food at
the Union Store, the lack of books
in the library, the fog at football
games in San Francisco. A little flurry
follows these periodic outbursts, a
few register opinions, and the campus
once again settles down to its undis
turbed sleepiness. These complaints
are usually the results of half
thoughts. They are not constructive,
nor do they show a consideration of
every angle of the case.
Co-operation Lacking
Then there is the person who sees
room for improvement but finds it
difficult to prod the unproductive
minds of his associates into any active
co-operation. It is too much trouble for
the average person to think out a
thing. The one who wishes to do so
finds himself almost alone In his ef
forts.
It is rather appalling to note this
lack of interest which is so prevalent.
Stanford is a superior university, by
its own admission, and ought to be
turning out first-rate men and women.
However it is not succeeding any bet
ter than is any other college. This
brings us to that old question—does
the fault lie with the students or the
faculty and the methods of instruc
tion? —Elsa Krotozyner.

of expression of opinion, a general
stagnancy, an attitude of indifference
that typifies the rank and file. A
group pressure that seems to stifle
individuality in thought. A blind ac
ceptance of the ways of doing things
just because they are being done. A
doing what the other fellow does,
without questioning the cause or the
reason for it.
No Group Thought
Stanford students are supposedly
intelligent. More so, it is rumored,
than other ordinary college people.
Yet there is this noticeable lack of
intelligent group thinking. Most sug
gestions, most change in present stu
dent customs originate not by pres
sure of student opinion but, by the
few "student leaders," at the top.
A few individual thinkers there are.
There is the chronic "griper," if he
may be considered in this category,
who finds fault all around, but makes
no suggestions as to betterment of

existing conditions. He registers com
plaints against the 8.A.C., tlie food at
the Union Store, the lack of books
in the library, the fog at football
games in San Francisco. A little flurry
follows these periodic outbursts, a
few register opinions, and the campus
once again settles down to its undis
turbed sleepiness. These complaints
are usually the results of half
thoughts. They are not constructive,
nor do they show a consideration of
every angle of the case.
Co-operation Lacking
Then there is the person who sees
room for improvement but finds it
difficult to prod the unproductive
minds of his associates into any active
co-operation. It is too much trouble for
the average person to think out a
thing. The one who wishes to do so
finds himself almost alone In his ef
forts.
It is rather appalling to note this
lack of interest which is so prevalent.
Stanford is a superior university, by
its own admission, and ought to be
turning out first-rate men and women.
However it is not succeeding any bet
ter than is any other college. This
brings us to that old question—does
the fault lie with the students or the
faculty and the methods of instruc
tion? —Elsa Krotozyner.
THE UNTHINKING MASSES
A certain lethargy hangs over Stan
ford like a pall. It's as easy to get an
idea started here as it is to move a
mountain. Most students seem afraid
to think, or express themselves when
they have indulged in the unusual
effort.
