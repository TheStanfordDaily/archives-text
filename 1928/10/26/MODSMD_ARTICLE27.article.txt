Vasco, By Marc Chadourne (New
York: Harcourt, Brace, and Co.,
1928.)
"Vasco" is the story of an intelligent
young Frenchman who returned to Paris
after the war, and found, as so many
soldiers did, that the world had changed
for him. Instead of the peace and the
freedom for which he had hoped, he was
faced with the life he had always hated,
a material life, pretty, safe, fixed and dull.
His restless nature made such an ex
istence an impossibility for him and
seeking escape he fled to the Pacilic
Islands, where at first he found the il
lusion of complete happiness. It was not
for long. Even the beauty of those trop
ical islands and the charm of native life
could not satisfy his strange, unbalanced
nature. The story of his exile, his wan
dering, and his solitude in the five years
that he spent on those far away islands
form a depressing, yet powerful novel.
"Vasco" lacks romantic appeal. The
author had spent part of his life in the
places he describes, so that the intense
realism of his descriptions is more than
ordinary. To read this book purely for
entertainment would be a mistake. It is
not a pretty story: there arc pages of
horror, as well as pages of great beauty.
There are also some incredibly dull pages.
However, to a student of pathological
cases, Vasco would lie a genuine find.
Mystic or madman—which? Even the
author does not seem to be sure. As for
the eternal question running through the
book—the WHY of life—the answer is
as remote in the last chapter as in the
first.
Marc Chadourne is a French novelist
who at present is but little known. It is
the opinion of Ford Madox Ford, that
this last book of his will definitely estab
lish him among the foremost of modern
writers. Yet it is a question whether
the educational value of the book does
not somewhat obscure the literary in
terest.
