# "KONGO"—New Capitol
## 
### 
This is one of those "riskay" plays,
laid in deepest Africa where men are
sexual and women are sociable. Your
sixteen-year-old sister will get the sur
prise of her life if she sees "Kongo."
After listening to the language of this
show, the vocabulary of the Stanford
roughs will seem just a-b-c to you.
If you like your theater raw, you'll
probably react favorably to "Kongo." To
us it was too melodramic to impress. It
is as daring as "Rain" and "White
Cargo"; but, whereas wet weather and
humidity motivated, respectively, those
two dramas, revenge causes "Dead Legs"
Flint to make life miserable for the un

fortunates he corrals in tropical Africa.
All the action is set in the store of
this ill-tempered "Dead Legs," and
through the doors and windows one can
glimpse palm effects denoting the men
acing jungle. Several well-built negroes
march in and out to give local color, tom
toms beat backstage, and a ghost walks.
But the whole atmosphere of the play
is so downright wild and wooly that it
almost verges on the ridiculous.
Howard Sinclair is featured as "Dead
Legs" Flint and does as well as possible
with such a bombastic role. Natalie War
field, while not a bit pretty, is sympa
thetic as the heroine—a lady who is des
cribed in politer moments as having had
too many parties and too many pals.
Byron Hawkins is the juvenile, a doctor
who is a dope addict A nice assortment
of characters for them to portray!
Comedy is furnished by Buddy Clarke,
who is unaccountably cockney. Nita
Cavalier melts from one langorous pose
into another as Li'l Mim, the scantily
clad colored inamorata of "Dead Legs."
Life as it's lived in the heart of the
rubber and ivory belt of the Belgian
Congo is presented in "Kongo." Chester
Dc Vonde and Kilbourn Gordon, the
authors, have interpreted this little-known
neck of the woods in a lurid manner.
"Kongo" is not as good as "White Cargo"
and not to be mentioned in the same
breath as "Rain"—the two plays it is
evidently modeled after.
We never quite understood why and
how "Dead Legs" Flint's store was run.
And everyone drank out of the same
bottle—good healthy swallows—the same
bottle evidently lasting several months.
Such capacity!
Too bad the New Capitol couldn't find
another play of the calibre of their last
show—"The Play's the Thing."

field, while not a bit pretty, is sympa
thetic as the heroine—a lady who is des
cribed in politer moments as having had
too many parties and too many pals.
Byron Hawkins is the juvenile, a doctor
who is a dope addict A nice assortment
of characters for them to portray!
Comedy is furnished by Buddy Clarke,
who is unaccountably cockney. Nita
Cavalier melts from one langorous pose
into another as Li'l Mim, the scantily
clad colored inamorata of "Dead Legs."
Life as it's lived in the heart of the
rubber and ivory belt of the Belgian
Congo is presented in "Kongo." Chester
Dc Vonde and Kilbourn Gordon, the
authors, have interpreted this little-known
neck of the woods in a lurid manner.
"Kongo" is not as good as "White Cargo"
and not to be mentioned in the same
breath as "Rain"—the two plays it is
evidently modeled after.
We never quite understood why and
how "Dead Legs" Flint's store was run.
And everyone drank out of the same
bottle—good healthy swallows—the same
bottle evidently lasting several months.
Such capacity!
Too bad the New Capitol couldn't find
another play of the calibre of their last
show—"The Play's the Thing."
—Ben Maddox
This is one of those "riskay" plays,
laid in deepest Africa where men are
sexual and women are sociable. Your
sixteen-year-old sister will get the sur
prise of her life if she sees "Kongo."
After listening to the language of this
show, the vocabulary of the Stanford
roughs will seem just a-b-c to you.
If you like your theater raw, you'll
probably react favorably to "Kongo." To
us it was too melodramic to impress. It
is as daring as "Rain" and "White
Cargo"; but, whereas wet weather and
humidity motivated, respectively, those
two dramas, revenge causes "Dead Legs"
Flint to make life miserable for the un

fortunates he corrals in tropical Africa.
All the action is set in the store of
this ill-tempered "Dead Legs," and
through the doors and windows one can
glimpse palm effects denoting the men
acing jungle. Several well-built negroes
march in and out to give local color, tom
toms beat backstage, and a ghost walks.
But the whole atmosphere of the play
is so downright wild and wooly that it
almost verges on the ridiculous.
Howard Sinclair is featured as "Dead
Legs" Flint and does as well as possible
with such a bombastic role. Natalie War
field, while not a bit pretty, is sympa
thetic as the heroine—a lady who is des
cribed in politer moments as having had
too many parties and too many pals.
