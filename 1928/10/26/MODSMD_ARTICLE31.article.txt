### PHILLIP SPACE WRAPSODY 
Ahli these cool dark Stanford nights
with just a ray of sweet light fading
through the arches of the frozen columns
. . . falling on a soft pavement . . . foot
steps falling in the distance . . . paddles
thwacking . . . the patter of a sudden
flurry of rain or something. Then all is
still. Still. The fresh smell of the
country . . . the bright Pole Star. The
lurking Pole Cat . . . far off parties of
four or six may see the lights of Stan
ford . . . how many happy hearts are
behind those lights—how many broken
ones—how many candle power? But to
night you and I are far away from the
toil of the city, Gwendolyn . . . your
eyes are pools of bewitching blue and I
want to plunge into their cool depths and
go down, down, down . . .
(EDITOR'S NOTE—down where the
Wurzburger flows, flows, flows—that
was a dam funny one now, wasn't it?
Just like them saps of poets. Imagine
jumping into an eye. It's disgustful,
that's what it is!)
President Coolidge held a radio-tele
phone conversation with the King of
Spain. A radio fan tuned in, thought
it was a monologue from a Spanish
station, cursed, and tuned off again.
Etiphronia thinks the Liberty Dyeing
Works is a Martyr's Club.
A Springfield, Massachusetts, burglar
was arrested when found sleeping in a
bathtub after robbing the house earlier
in the evening.
The headlines read, we suppose:
CULPRIT TRAPPED
IN LOCAL RING
(The following is a result of the muse
to amuse. After all there are a lot of
words that sound alike. The conductor of
this column. Mr. Space, got started on
it, then found it had worked itself around
to the opposite of his personal views. It
rhymed, so it was printed anyway, over
my protest. —The Editor.)
(I wrote this, too—Space.)
The man that woos the muse amuses me
Though I ruse the ruse that makes him
choose to be
So far past mortal law
That his readers gape with awe —
Yes, the man that woos the muse amuses
me.
The man that boos the booze amuses me
Though I personally favor milk or tea —
For he sometimes is, to-wit,
An infernal hypocrite—
So the man that boos the booze amuses
me.
And the man that moos revues amuses
me
He imbues the news with views of nudity
People flock to their defense, or
Try to see before the censor—
Oh, the man that sues revues amuses me.
Prince Abrahim of Egypt was severely
injured when he drove his automobile
against a wall to avoid hitting a pedes
trian.
East is East and West is West—
here we would drive our automobile
I against a pedestrian to avoid hitting
! a wall.
Stephen Connell, famous secret ser
vice man, died after thirty-five years'
active service in tracing criminals.

go down, down, down . . .
(EDITOR'S NOTE—down where the
Wurzburger flows, flows, flows—that

Just like them saps of poets. Imagine

President Coolidge held a radio-tele
