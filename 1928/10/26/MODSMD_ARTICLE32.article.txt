# VARSITY FENCING TEAM TO MEET CLUB FOILSMEN
## Cards Expected to Defeat Olympic Squad in Bouts At Gym Tonight 
### 
The Stanford varsity fencing team
is conceded a good chance to defeat
the Olympic Club foilsmen when the
two teams meet at 8 o'clock tonight
in Encina Gym. The tourney, which
will be open to the public, is Stan
ford's first this season, and will be in
competition for the W. A. Heron
trophy.
Captain Ilerk Adams of the Cardi
nals is almost sure to chalk up a win
for Stanford. Adams, who was high
point man in the Stanford-California
meet last year, will meet Bryan
Smith, who is individual foils cham
pion of the Pacific Coast. The other
four men who will make up the Stan
ford team are Tom Henry, Fletcher
Dutton, Orray Taft, and Jack Snyder.
Besides Smith, Gerard Leicester
and Dorin Van Arnold are individual
stars on the club team whom the
Stanford men will have to defeat.
Leicester is ex-captain of the Yale
fencing team, and Van Arnold was
saber champion of the Pacific Coast
in 1926. The Olympic Club team de
feated the Unione Sportiva Italiana
Virtus of San Francisco Wednesday
in competition for the same trophy;
if Stanford can win tonight, the Uni
versity of California will probably be
the only obstacle in the trophy race.
The Heron trophy is competed for
each year by the Olympic Club, the
University of California, Stanford, and
the Unione Sportiva Italiana Virtus
of San Francisco.
