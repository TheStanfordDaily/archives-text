NEW YORK, Oct. 25. (/P)â€”' The bond
market was active and strong today,
with an extensive assortment of is
sues advancing in price. However,
convertibles sagged late in the day in
reflection of the belated downward
trend of some stock prices after call
money had advanced to 8 per cent, on
the calling of upwards of $30,000,000
in bank loans. Time money was
slightly firmer.
Utilities and oils showed group
strength, despite a few minor reces
sions. Transcontinental Oil 6%s es
tablished a new year's high at 103,
up 1% points net. New York Tele
phone 4%5, Public Service of New
Jersey 4%5, and American Telephone
& Telegraph 5s made fractional gains.
Rails were irregular. The Chicago
& Alton issues showed gains running
as high as 4% points, and Lexington
& Eastern ss, New Haven 4s, North
ern Pacific 3s, Erie 4s B, and a few
others gained a point or more.
