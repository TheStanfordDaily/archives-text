Whom would you pick as an All-
Time All-American backfield? Are
you a modernist, who can't see the
Old-Time Heroes through the haze of
gaseous traditions and legends that
enshroud their names and deeds, or
do you side with the bewhiskered
alumni whose perspective of passing
years tells them that the gridiron
men of today are not the physical
and mechanical football players that
twenty-five years ago knew?
The question, let us say, as to
whether or not Grange was a better
football player than Heston, will, of
course, never be satisfactorily an
swered, any more than will the ques
tion "Could Dempsey beat Jeffries?"

So let's look 'em over, and bear in
mind that one man's choice is as
good as another's. Never having seen
Eckersall, Heston, Thorpe, and Coy
in action, I can only take with a few
grains of salt what I hear and read
about these gentlemen, which still
leaves the firm conviction in my mind
that they were about as good a back
field as ever lived.
Imagine "Eckie" at quarter, Heston
and Thorpe at halves, and Coy at
full! What speed and power—and
brains! What running, kicking, de
fensive ability, with "Big Indian Jim"
to throw the passes. Chess-brained
Eckersall was probably as great an
all-around player as ever trod a grid

iron. Heston, while not as versatile,
had no equal in advancing the ball,
while Coy was as hard a driver and
a great punter. Thorpe could do every
thing on a gridiron well.
Now let's look at the stars from
1912 on. That's where Eddie Mahan
and Grange come in, and George
Gipp, and Oliphant and Nevers and
Oberlander and —oh, mama, why did
I ever begin this! Grange was prob
ably the most spectacular broken-field
runner that ever lived, and certainly
was the best-advertised. I saw him in
four of his best games, and will never
forget his wonderful ball-carrying and
passing. On the defense and as a
kicker he was not as good. Gipp, too,

was most spectacular, yet his own
coach, Knute Rockne, rates Thorpe
the greatest of all, and Gipp and
Mahan on a par.
How's this for an All-Time Ail-
American backfield? We'll leave Wil
lie Heston out of it, for he came be
fore the days of the forward pass.
(And we'll leave the Red Terror out
too, although he was no slouch on de
fense. And we'll leave Ted Coy out,
because I have a hunch that if he
hadn't been to Yale he'd have been
a much less-heralded player. Here
goes: quarterback, Eckersall, of Chi
cago; halfback, Jim Thorpe, of Car
lisle; halfback, Eddie Mahan, Harvard;
fullback, George Gipp, Notre Dame.

Oberlander and —oh, mama, why did
I ever begin this! Grange was prob
ably the most spectacular broken-field
runner that ever lived, and certainly
was the best-advertised. I saw him in
four of his best games, and will never
forget his wonderful ball-carrying and
passing. On the defense and as a
kicker he was not as good. Gipp, too,

was most spectacular, yet his own
coach, Knute Rockne, rates Thorpe
the greatest of all, and Gipp and
Mahan on a par.
How's this for an All-Time Ail-
American backfield? We'll leave Wil
lie Heston out of it, for he came be
fore the days of the forward pass.
(And we'll leave the Red Terror out
too, although he was no slouch on de
fense. And we'll leave Ted Coy out,
because I have a hunch that if he
hadn't been to Yale he'd have been
a much less-heralded player. Here
goes: quarterback, Eckersall, of Chi
cago; halfback, Jim Thorpe, of Car
lisle; halfback, Eddie Mahan, Harvard;
fullback, George Gipp, Notre Dame.

Whom would you pick as an All-
Time All-American backfield? Are
you a modernist, who can't see the
Old-Time Heroes through the haze of
gaseous traditions and legends that
enshroud their names and deeds, or
do you side with the bewhiskered
alumni whose perspective of passing
years tells them that the gridiron
men of today are not the physical
and mechanical football players that
twenty-five years ago knew?
The question, let us say, as to
whether or not Grange was a better
football player than Heston, will, of
course, never be satisfactorily an
swered, any more than will the ques
tion "Could Dempsey beat Jeffries?"

So let's look 'em over, and bear in
mind that one man's choice is as
good as another's. Never having seen
Eckersall, Heston, Thorpe, and Coy
in action, I can only take with a few
grains of salt what I hear and read
about these gentlemen, which still
leaves the firm conviction in my mind
that they were about as good a back
field as ever lived.
Imagine "Eckie" at quarter, Heston
and Thorpe at halves, and Coy at
full! What speed and power—and
brains! What running, kicking, de
fensive ability, with "Big Indian Jim"
to throw the passes. Chess-brained
Eckersall was probably as great an
all-around player as ever trod a grid

iron. Heston, while not as versatile,
had no equal in advancing the ball,
while Coy was as hard a driver and
a great punter. Thorpe could do every
thing on a gridiron well.
Now let's look at the stars from
1912 on. That's where Eddie Mahan
and Grange come in, and George
Gipp, and Oliphant and Nevers and
Oberlander and —oh, mama, why did
I ever begin this! Grange was prob
ably the most spectacular broken-field
runner that ever lived, and certainly
