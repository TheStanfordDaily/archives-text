# DEVIL CONCEALED IN PARMESAN CHEESE
## Magic Food Causes Strange Happenings as Shown in Cushing's Comedyâ€”Fantasy To Be Given November 9 
### 
"Eat too much Parmesan cheesc and
the first thing you know you're an addict."
This is the comment made T)y Joseph
Quigley, played by John Atwill, million
aire from Kansas, when he has tried
that delectable type of food in Tom
Cushing's comedy-fantasy "The Devil in
the Cheese" which will he produced by
Gordon Davis at Stanford November 9.
There is a magical quality in Parmesan
cheese that makes those who taste it see
devils and visions of things that may
or may not ever have happened, depend
ing on the individual's belief in dreams.
The play incorporates a psychological
study of a young girl's mind which is
made more interesting by the fact that
the modern Goldina, played by Helen
Thompson, is also in love. And love, it
would seem from the play, makes havoc
of logical and reasonable thoughts. The
whole second act takes place in the mind
of Goldina, and the events and charac
ters are seen entirely through her eyes.
Her father, who, by the aid of the magic
cheese, has entered her mind, receives
some startling revelations.
The three scenes of the second act
