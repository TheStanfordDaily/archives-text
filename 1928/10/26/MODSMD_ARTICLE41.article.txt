## 
### 
STOCKTON, Oct. 25. (/?)â€”'The sec
ond trial of Sheriff William H. Riecks
and Chairman of Supervisors James
Y. Coates on*a charge of accepting
bribes, opened and swung quickly into
motion today with Superior Judge
Stanley Murray of Madera County on
the bench.
Over the protests of Harry A, Maz
zera, attorney for the sheriff, Judge
Murray injected the liquor question
into the choosing of a jury by de
manding of each venireman whether
or not his verdict might be influenced
if the enforcement of the dry law
should become involved in the case.
Sheriff Riecks is accused of accept
ing $2500 in bribe money from F. V.
Fontaine, district attorney's detective
posing as a rum runner, and Super
visor Coates is charged with accept
ing $600 in three installments of $200
each from the purported rum runner.
The first trial resulted in a dead
lock after a bitterly fought battle
which lasted several weeks.
Superior Judge George F. Buck pre
sided at the first trial but withdrew
from the second at the request of
the defense.
A loving cup will be presented by
Delta Tau Delta fraternity to the win
ning team in the interfraternity pa
jama relay race to take place at
Northwestern University.
