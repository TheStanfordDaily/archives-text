"The Stanford Chapel is my greatest
monument," Signor Maurice Camerino,
manager of Salviatti and Co., told Carl
F. Brand, assistant professor of history,
in Venice this summer. Camerino came
to America to supervise the construction
of the original mosaics in the chapel, and
again, after the earthquake had necessi
tated their reassembly, Salviatti and Co.,
the best-known Venetian glassmakers, de
signed and executed the Stanford mos
aics, which were shipped to America in
individual pieces.
Brand and a group of Stanford men
visited the Salviatti showrooms. A huge
painting of the Memorial Church was
the first thing that met their eyes; there
are details of the mosaics on every side.
Camerino himself showed them around,
and explained the manufacture of fine
glassware, stating he has always been
extremely interested in California, and
particularly Stanford.
