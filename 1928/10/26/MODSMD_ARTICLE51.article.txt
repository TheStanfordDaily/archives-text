# VOCATIONAL TEST PROVES 77% PERFECT
## Most of 1927 Graduates Have Entered Occupations in Which They Scored First in Psychology Quiz 
### 
Out of the one hundred and fifty-six
seniors of the class of 1927 who took
the Vocational Interest Test before
graduation, 77 per cent have entered
the occupations on which they scored
first, second, or third highest out of a
list of fifteen different vocations.
These significant figures are the
j x'esult of research work carried on by
Professor Edward K. Strong, of the
| Psychology Department, who devised
; the test. Only 18 per cent of the total
number who filled out the blanks
have entered occupations in which
they have no interest at all; and, con
sidering the fact that many of these
men have chosen vocations in which
they are not interested because of
family and financial reasons, these
results are about as satisfactory as
could be expected from a valid voca
tional guidance test.
Fifteen Fields Included
The weights given each item on the
interest blanks for each occupational
scoring are based on data from adult
men known to be successful in that
particular field, the fifteen vocations
being: advertising, architecture, art,
public accounting, chemistry, engi
neering, farming, journalism, law, life
insurance, ministry, psychology, pur

chasing, teaching, and general secre
taryship of the Y.M.C.A.
Relatively few men have B ratings
and almost none have A ratings in
teaching, psychology, Y.M.C.A. secre
taryship, architecture, public account
ing, ministry, and art. These low per
centages agree with the small number
of seniors who have expressed their
intentions to enter these fields.
More than half of those tested were
found not to have A ratings in any
occupational interest; whereas many
rated A in two or three, and 1 per
cent in four vocations.
Seniors Return Programs
Of all the seniors who took the
test, two-thirds have retained their
original occupational programs after
nine months, one-fourth have changed
their programs, and 9 per cent have
continued without an occupational
choice.
A similar vocational guidance test
has not yet been devised for women,
but Dr. Strong believes that if the
men's is sufficiently successful, and if
workers can be found who are willing
to devote the necessary time and
energy to such a task, vocational in
terest blanks will be available fox
women some time in the future.

test, two-thirds have retained their
original occupational programs after
nine months, one-fourth have changed
their programs, and 9 per cent have
continued without an occupational
choice.
A similar vocational guidance test
has not yet been devised for women,
but Dr. Strong believes that if the
men's is sufficiently successful, and if
workers can be found who are willing
to devote the necessary time and
energy to such a task, vocational in
terest blanks will be available fox
women some time in the future.
Out of the one hundred and fifty-six
seniors of the class of 1927 who took
the Vocational Interest Test before
graduation, 77 per cent have entered
the occupations on which they scored
first, second, or third highest out of a
list of fifteen different vocations.
These significant figures are the
j x'esult of research work carried on by
Professor Edward K. Strong, of the
| Psychology Department, who devised
; the test. Only 18 per cent of the total
number who filled out the blanks
have entered occupations in which
they have no interest at all; and, con
sidering the fact that many of these
men have chosen vocations in which
they are not interested because of
family and financial reasons, these
results are about as satisfactory as
could be expected from a valid voca
tional guidance test.
Fifteen Fields Included
The weights given each item on the
interest blanks for each occupational
scoring are based on data from adult
men known to be successful in that
particular field, the fifteen vocations
being: advertising, architecture, art,
public accounting, chemistry, engi
neering, farming, journalism, law, life
insurance, ministry, psychology, pur

chasing, teaching, and general secre
taryship of the Y.M.C.A.
Relatively few men have B ratings
and almost none have A ratings in
teaching, psychology, Y.M.C.A. secre
taryship, architecture, public account
ing, ministry, and art. These low per
centages agree with the small number
of seniors who have expressed their
intentions to enter these fields.
More than half of those tested were
found not to have A ratings in any
occupational interest; whereas many
rated A in two or three, and 1 per
cent in four vocations.
Seniors Return Programs
Of all the seniors who took the
test, two-thirds have retained their
original occupational programs after
nine months, one-fourth have changed
their programs, and 9 per cent have
continued without an occupational
choice.
