# BOOKSTORE INSTALLS NEW READING CORNER
## 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore has estab
lished the nucleus of an open browsing
corner for the use of all campus people
wishing to spend leisure hours in the en
joyment of new books and old.
The business of this "trade" depart
ment—that is, this stock of books other
than texts —is expected to counter the
decrease in sales of the other depart
ment, which is reported to have sold
fewer text books to date this quarter than
by this time last spring quarter.
