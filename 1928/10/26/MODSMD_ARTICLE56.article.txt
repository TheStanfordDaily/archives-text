# GRID WAR DECLARED BY IRATE "CHAPPIES"
## 
### 
Butterfly nets for pass snatching, and
any and all tactics have been declared
legal for the annual football farce fracas
between the Hammer and Coffin Society
and the Stanford Daily staff to be
played between the halves of the Santa
Clara game here on November 10. The
following challenge was submitted to the
Daily staff yesterday:
KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE
PRESENTS:
THAT ye noble and august body
of men known as the Hammer and
Coffin Society do hereby challenge
the puling infants, who make up
what is generally called the Stanford
Daily staff, to a football game to be
played between hafoes of the Santa
Clara game, on November tenth, at
approximately 3 :00 p.m. in the after
noon, in the Stanford Stadium.
THAT aforesaid challenge is the
result of a long and smouldering
dislike by the abovementioned august
body for the infantile Daily mem
bers, and a well-founded doubt by
the former that the latter are real
men, and capable of anything ex
cept making a feeble racket on the
typewriter.
THAT the members of the Stan
ford Daily shall accept this defi at
their own peril, and provide their
own hearses and flowers for the
event.
Signed:
HAMMER AND COEPIN
SOCIETY
