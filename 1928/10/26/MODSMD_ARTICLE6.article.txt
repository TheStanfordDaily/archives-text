# 'TATTLE-TALES' HAVE NO PLACE HERE-CAVALERO
## Honor System Enforcement Measures Discussed by Fraternity Heads 
### 
That "tattle-tales" are neither
wanted nor needed in a "self-enforc
ing" Honor System, is the belief of
Philip Cavalero, student body presi
dent, who spoke last night at a meet
ing of the presidents of the various
campus fraternities in the Beta Theta
Pi house.
Appealing to that body to aid in the
creation of a friendly attitude in their
respective living groups and scoring
"stool pigeons as undesirable," Cava
lero sketched the recently proposed
measures to aid in the enforcement
and betterment of the Honor System.
"We want a self-enforcing Honor
System," he declared. "One where stu
dent opinion will be so against cheat
ing that the violator will be booed
and elbowed out of the room. The first
stops have been taken to define the
Honor System and to state the punish
ment of the violators. Heretofore it
has included too much, but from now
on the Honor System will pertain to
any classroom work or any case
where the system of grading is used."
Students in the upper division must
set the example for those in the
lower division, Cavalero said. "It was
formerly a tradition that seniors take
a definite stand and set the precedent
of obeying the Honor System, but
lately this spirit has been lagging. It
is up to us to revive it."
He concluded by giving examples
of how the honor system worked in
other universities throughout the
country. "However, just because one
school finds it is impractical and is
impossible to make it a success, is no
reason why we should abandon the
honor system. It would be disgraceful
if Stanford should admit that it is
unable to make the Honor System a
practical thing."
