# PROSPERITY DECLARED A REALITY IN U. S.
## Cherington Says Public Has Greatest Spendable Surplus Ever in Address to Stanford Advertising Club 
### 
PROSPERITY is a living reality in the United States," declared Dr. Paul T.
Cherington of the Graduate School of Business when addressing the Stan
ford Advertising Club in Palo Alto last night. "The American public has a
greater spendable surplus than ever before," the speaker continued in his
talk on "The Strange Interlude in Retailing."
I)r. Cherington declared that retail stores are now undergoing a change
from the one-man business of last century to the new highly specialized
chain system. "We should not look at the chain store as a terrible octopus
4iwhich will crush all busines, but as

the inevitable result of our modern
commercial method√ü."
He is pleased with the high type of
retail stores to be found in Palo Alto.
"It has more high-class stores than
any other city of its size that I have
visited," was the speaker's opinion.
This he credits both to the demands
of the special customers served in
this district and to the progressive
ness of the merchants.
The U.S. Census is sponsoring an
annual economic investigation of
95,000 retail stores in eleven Ameri
can cities. "From these census figures
we find that fifteen per cent of the
stores are members of chain systems
and that these stores do thirty per
cent of the business.
"The mail order house has seen its
best day," said Dr. Cherington. "Mod
ern transportation has made it pos
sible for the rural population to easily
visit the town merchant."
