### 
At last a haven has been found for
the ex-college athlete who has worn
himself out on the diamond and grid
iron. Earl Carroll, producer of the
famous Vanities, is looking for fifty
"seasoned football, baseball and basket
ball players, or athletes of any type" for
his new musical production dealing with
"a new phase of athletic life."
The salaries, says the letter will be $50
a week. Applicants should send in their
photographs to the Carroll office, 755
Seventh Avenue, New York City before
November 15, and write on the back
their measurements and coloring as well
as athletic records. Rehearsals for the
production will begin about November
15.
"This may present a golden oppor
tunity to the graduates who have not
acquired a position or become set in a
profession," reads the letter from the
noted producer's representatives.
