# Young Forecasts G.O.P. Landslide; Denounces Smith
## Republican Victory Assured Declares Governor in Fresno Address 
### 
FRESNO, Oct. 25. (,/P) —The swing
toward the Republican ticket is gain
ing momentum at a rate almost un
precedented in presidential cam
paigns, Governor C. C. Young de
clared in his address at the Republi
can Party mass meeting here tonight.
"Each new poll that is taken, each
new investigation that is made, all
seem to indicate that the Republican
electoral vote will far surpass what
the most ardent partisan would have
ventured to predict at the time thi
nominations were made," the Gover
nor said. "More and more certainly
each day we feel the ground swell of
that tide which is sweeping to vic
tory—the man who is to lead us dur
ing the next four years. Our fellow
Californian, Herbert Hoover."
Here are some of the high points
in the Governor's speech:
"Hoover worked for American re
lief of Belgium, for conservation of
food during the war, prevention of
famine in Germany, Russia, and in
the Balkans, and as Secretary of Com
merce at home. During all this, abroad
as well as at home, Hoover has re
mained completely and typically
American."
" 'To be perfectly frank,' (quoting
Frank H. Simmonds) 'official Europe
does not like Hoover because it re
gards him as too completely and un
qualifiedly American.'
"The life-long training and woiid
v.'ide experience which have been his
are precisely what is needed at the
present hour.
"It is no derogation of his (Hoo
ver's) opponent to say that his life
activities have been spent in an en
tirely different field. I think that no
one would deny that during the past
iwo months, Governor Smith has seen
more of the world outside New York
than he has ever seen in all his life
before.
"Hoover knows from his own ex
perience as a California farmer and
vineyardist that California, in com
mon with the other states, is facing a
very serious agricultural situation, j
Whatever solution is ultimately found ;
we may be very sure of one thing, j
that it must be based upon an ade-!
quate tariff.
"I do not believe that there can be j
found in all the world another man
so capable of curing the present ills j
of agriculture as is offered to us now
in the person of Herbert Hoover.
"Adequate tariff revision, improved
and cheaper methods of transporta- j
tion, reorganization of the marketing
system, better co-operation between
the government and industry—all
these he sets forth as parts of his
sound and profitable basis.
"Two months ago in Los Angeles,
Hoover said, 'We want the greatest
reservoir and highest dam at Boulder
Canyon that the engineers will recom
mend' —there cannot be the shadow
of a question as to Mr. Hoover's atti
tude on this measure -his aid will be
invaluable in carrying nis project to
final victory.
"Governor Smith professes sym
pathy for tho principle of restrictive
immigration; yet at the same time op
poses the quota basis by which re
striction is made effective.
"Except for Governor Smith's sol
emn promise to enforce existing law,
there is not a single plank in the 114f>
words of his Prohibition platform
which could be workable —as Presi

dent he would have absolutely no
power to abolish or even modify Pro
hibition or do anything except enforce
existing law—therefore this is a false
issue and must not be allowed to con
fuse the real issues of the campaign.
"With Hoover as President, we shall
be served not by one man alone, but
by a whole administration, co-ordi
| nated and inspired for public service
as no administration has ever been
before."
