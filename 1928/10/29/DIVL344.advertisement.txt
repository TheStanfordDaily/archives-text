Bewildering Colorings in Woolen
Hoisery that would like to
be in your shoes
Seeing this assortment and
stopping at buying one pair
would be like laying aside a
detective story with the hero
up a tree.
You'll want two pairs —
you're apt to make it three
— you'll wish you'd made it
four—and you ought to have
six.
Checks, Stripes, Triangles, in
the shadings that the rainbow
didn t include when we last
saw it.
Priced from $4 down
