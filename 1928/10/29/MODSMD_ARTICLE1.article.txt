# STUART MAKES COMPARISON OF PARTY STANDS
## Stanford Professor Points Out Failure of Both Sides to Consider Foreign Issues 
### 
(The following is a statement ob
tained from Professor Graham H.
Stuart of the political science depart
ment for the Stanford Daily.)
Comparing the platforms of the pres
ent campaign with those of 1920 and
1924, one outstanding difference seems to
be the tendency of both major parties to
disregard almost entirely those important
questions of foreign policy which ap
peared in the previous campaign as the
most vital issues. One will seek in
vain in either party a statement of policy
regarding the World Court, while the
League of Nations seems to be complete
ly disowned by the party that gave it
birth, and still looked at askance by the
party that strove to have it brought forth
still-born.
Both parties favor the outlawry of
war, but neither is willing to commit
Itself in regard to a procedure to
eliminate its causes or to settle disputes
which may arise.
Both carefully avoid all mention of the
World Court although the Gillett Reso
lution regarding our adherence will come
before the Senate immediately upon its
convening. Mr. Hughes has just been
elected a judge and has already signified |
his acceptance.
As to the League, Mr. Hoover says,
"Our country has refused membership in
the League, but we are glad to cooperate
with the League in its endeavors to furth
er scientific, economic and social welfare
and to secure limitation of armament."
He then goes on to state that "the foun
dations of peace can be strengthened by
the creation of methods and agencies by
which a multitude of incidents may be
transferred from the realm of prejudice
and force to arbitration based on interna
tional law."
This statement is somewhat lacking in
clarity but would seem to mean the set
tlement of disputes by either the Hague j
Court or the World Court. Mr. Smith
avoids all mention of the League by name :
but pledges himself "To a resumption of
real endeavor to make outlawry of war j
effective by removing its causes and to [
substitute the methods of conciliation, I
conference, arbitration and judicial set- ;
tlement." Inasmuch as the League and
World Court are the only agencies em- j
ploying exactly these means, it would ap- j
pear that Mr. Smith also favors both
League and Cpurt.
Apparently both candidates and cam
paign managers feel that it is expedient
to paraphrase a bit. In other words,
they appreciate the fact that a democracy
is not fitted to express an intelligent
opinion upon a subject where prejudice
and mis-statement have already under
mined a fair presentation of the case.
Hoover Backs Court
Fortunately, we do not have to go far
to find more specific declarations by both
candidates. Speaking at Des Moines, 1
April 11, 1923, Secretary Hoover de
clared, "The Court is not the total solu
tion of international co-operation for
peace but this step is sound and sure.!
It is the minimum possible step in
eliminating the causes of war."
In September, 1926, after a long fight
against Democratic leaders, Governor
Smith succeeded in placing a plank fav
oring the World Court in the Democratic
state platform, although the majority
had voted in favor of its omission and |
Judge Olvany of Tammany Ilall had ]
urged its rejection.
Perhaps, then, although it may be re-!
gretted that more definite assurances ;
have not been given, we may hope all the |
more for specific results, in that both can
didates have given clear evidence of their
positions before being handicapped by the I
exigencies of the campaign.

regarding the World Court, while the
League of Nations seems to be complete
ly disowned by the party that gave it
birth, and still looked at askance by the
party that strove to have it brought forth
still-born.
Both parties favor the outlawry of
war, but neither is willing to commit
Itself in regard to a procedure to
eliminate its causes or to settle disputes
which may arise.
Both carefully avoid all mention of the
World Court although the Gillett Reso
lution regarding our adherence will come
before the Senate immediately upon its
convening. Mr. Hughes has just been
elected a judge and has already signified |
his acceptance.
As to the League, Mr. Hoover says,
"Our country has refused membership in
the League, but we are glad to cooperate
with the League in its endeavors to furth
er scientific, economic and social welfare
and to secure limitation of armament."
He then goes on to state that "the foun
dations of peace can be strengthened by
the creation of methods and agencies by
which a multitude of incidents may be
transferred from the realm of prejudice
and force to arbitration based on interna
tional law."
This statement is somewhat lacking in
clarity but would seem to mean the set
tlement of disputes by either the Hague j
Court or the World Court. Mr. Smith
avoids all mention of the League by name :
but pledges himself "To a resumption of
real endeavor to make outlawry of war j
effective by removing its causes and to [
substitute the methods of conciliation, I
conference, arbitration and judicial set- ;
tlement." Inasmuch as the League and
World Court are the only agencies em- j
ploying exactly these means, it would ap- j
pear that Mr. Smith also favors both
League and Cpurt.
Apparently both candidates and cam
paign managers feel that it is expedient
to paraphrase a bit. In other words,
they appreciate the fact that a democracy
is not fitted to express an intelligent
opinion upon a subject where prejudice
and mis-statement have already under
mined a fair presentation of the case.
Hoover Backs Court
Fortunately, we do not have to go far
to find more specific declarations by both
candidates. Speaking at Des Moines, 1
April 11, 1923, Secretary Hoover de
clared, "The Court is not the total solu
tion of international co-operation for
peace but this step is sound and sure.!
It is the minimum possible step in
eliminating the causes of war."
In September, 1926, after a long fight
against Democratic leaders, Governor
Smith succeeded in placing a plank fav
oring the World Court in the Democratic
state platform, although the majority
had voted in favor of its omission and |
Judge Olvany of Tammany Ilall had ]
urged its rejection.
Perhaps, then, although it may be re-!
gretted that more definite assurances ;
have not been given, we may hope all the |
more for specific results, in that both can
didates have given clear evidence of their
positions before being handicapped by the I
exigencies of the campaign.
(The following is a statement ob
tained from Professor Graham H.
Stuart of the political science depart
ment for the Stanford Daily.)
Comparing the platforms of the pres
ent campaign with those of 1920 and
1924, one outstanding difference seems to
be the tendency of both major parties to
disregard almost entirely those important
questions of foreign policy which ap
peared in the previous campaign as the
most vital issues. One will seek in
vain in either party a statement of policy
regarding the World Court, while the
League of Nations seems to be complete
ly disowned by the party that gave it
birth, and still looked at askance by the
party that strove to have it brought forth
