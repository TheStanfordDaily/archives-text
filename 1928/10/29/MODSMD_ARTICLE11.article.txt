# CARDS, TROJANS VICTORIOUS IN EASY GAMES
## Heinecke Will Call Signals Unless Lewis Appears In Lineup for S.C. Contest 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
When Stanford meets Southern
California next Saturday the offense
of the Cardinals will probably be di
lected by Walt Heinecke, the scrappy
little center who holds the distinction
of being the smallest man on the |
Warner squad. This change will be
effective unless Spud Lewis appears
in the lineup.
Heinecke was sent into the game
against Fresno State Saturday and
got his test as a signal-caller then.
Lewis, recently revised into a half
back, has had previous experience as
a field general during his two years' j
! competition as a quarterback.
Cards, Trojans Win
Following the edict of the Old Law, '
the Stanford and Southern California j
football teams worked hard for six,
days last week and (practically) rest-;
ed on the Sabbath. As was almost
predestined, both teams were victori
ous over their much weaker oppon
ents, the Cards winning 47-0 from
Fresno State and the Trojans enjoy
ing a 19-0 victory over the Occidental
Tigers.
Stanford had an easier time of it
Saturday than did the Trojans. Pop I
Warner started a third-string eleven !
and, with a few exceptions, continued |
to use this team throughout most of
the game. Howard Jones of U.S.C.
started a substitute team, but with
the score 0-0 at half-time was com
pelled to inject a few regulars into
the lineup in the second half. Stan- 1
ford's third string scored more than
twice as many points as did Southern
California's firsts and seconds. But
that does not give any idea of the
comparative strength of the two
teams; it will be remembered that
Jones' men had a much tougher as
signment.
Bears Defeated
The outcome of games in which !
Conference teams participated Satur
day only emphasized the opinion that
the championship is confined to Cali
fornia, Southern California, and Stan
ford.
The Bears, with an eye toward
meeting Oregon this week at Berke
ley, did not take their game with the
Olympics too seriously. The Clubmen,
in scoring a 12-0 victory over Price's
substitutes crossed the California goal
for the first time this season.
Washington continued to sink into
obscurity as a championship con
tender. They met Oregon State and
took another beating. A week ago the
Huskies lost to Oregon whom Stan
ford defeated earlier in the season.
Idaho and U.C.L.A. battled it out in
Moscow and the Vandals erased the
supremacy of the Bruins established
by holding Stanford to a smaller
score than Idaho was able to do a
week later.
West Point, Stanford's final oppon
ent of the 1928 schedule, continues to
topple over its rivals. Led by the
brilliant runs of Christian Cagle, the
Cadets turned in a victory over Yale's
powerful Bulldogs. From all indica
tions there will be two candidates for
All-American honors in the Card-
Cadet game, Captain Biff Hoffman at
fullback and Cagle at half.
