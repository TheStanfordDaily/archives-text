# CONCERT SINGING NOW MORE COMPLEX ART THAN FORMERLY SAYS TIBBETT

### SYLVA WEAVER 
The low sweet strains of Lawrence
Tibbett's voice came through the air
I last Friday afternoon as the Daily in
terviewer entered the home of Charles
j and Kathleen Norris in Palo Alto
! where the baritone was a guest the
night of his Stanford concert. Tibbett
was rehearsing for his evening per
-1 form an c.e.
"Singing is much more complex
than it was in the past, Tibbett told
the interviewer. "Naturally one can
sing a purer tone when he has noth
ing else to think of. In the 'Golden
Age' of singing all a singer had to
do was to stand in front of a director
with clasped hands and deliver his
arias.
"Today a new note of realism has
been established and there is a change

in the character of the music to be
sung. There are more recitatives to
music. Singing is more like a conver
sation and not just melodies for the
sake of melody. It must all lit into a
dramatic scheme."
The youthful baritone remarked
that he tried to choose as many Eng
lish songs as possible in his concerts
so the audience could understand the
context. He believes compositions like
i "Old Man River" have a wide popular
1 appeal although ho admitted he would
rather sing in German than any other
language.
Tibbett went from Palo Alto Satur
, day to Denver for his next concert.
From there he will sing in a number
of cities on his eastern route to the
Metropolitan in New York. The opera
season for Tibbett begins December
180.
