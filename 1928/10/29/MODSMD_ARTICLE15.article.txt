# Criticism of Hoover Causes Utah University Editor To Be Expelled
## 
### 
SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 28. (A 3 )â€”
The Utah Chronicle, student publica
tion of the University of Utah, had a
new editor today, and Mac Alan Gard
ner, former editor, was preparing to
enter the University of California fol
lowing publication of an editorial
article in the Chronicle construed as
a criticism of a campaign declaration
of Herbert Hoover.
The Chronicle last Tuesday pub
lished an account of a speech de
livered by the Republican presidential
nominee to a group of college stu
dents and followed it with an edi
torial note which said in part:
"If this be reason, make the least
of it. How does Herb have the crust
to stand under the shadow of Teapot
Dome and say to intelligent people:
'Our ideals in national life must be
(he inspiration and guide to our ac
tion.' This is the sort of stuff that re
duces modern politics to absurdity, in
fact, ad nauseam."
In a published apology, Gardner
said "The remarks were not partisan
in their motivation, but were intended
to be an objective criticism of a
prominent individual's statement."
