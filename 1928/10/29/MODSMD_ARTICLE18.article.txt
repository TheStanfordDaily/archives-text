# CARD YEARLINGS BEAT ALL-STARS IN HARD BATTLE
## Babe Fullback Plays Well Despite Injured Ankle; Cadell Also Stars 
### 
Encountering the stiffest defense
they have run up against in several
weeks, the Cardinal freshman football
eleven pounded its way to a 26 to 0
victory over the Southern All-Stars in
the Stadium Saturday. An effective
passing attack and fast teamwork en
abled Coach Husky Hunt's charges to
break down the visitors' defense and
score four touchdowns.
After a long drive to a touchdown
in the first few minutes of play, the
freshmen were held scoreless for the
remainder of the half, the ball being
carried up and down the field.
Though showing strength on the
defense, the All-Stars did little of
fensively, aside from a few occasional
spurts.
Dusty Allen, hard-hitting freshman
fullback, played a fine game for three
quarters until taken out with an in
jured ankle. His line-plunging, pass
ing, and particularly his defensive
play, were par-excellent.
Playing at right half in place of
Wilson who was shifted to left half
to replace Rudy Rintala who is still
on the injured list, Cadell found diffi
culty in holding the ball in the first
half, but when he did get going in
the second half there was nothing
that could stop him. In the third quar
ter he carried the ball on straight
plays from his own forty-yard line to
a touchdown, no other Stanford back
handling the ball.
The third freshman score came
when Ebey recovered a punt fumbled
by the All-Star safety man and ran
thirty yards to a touchdown. A series
of passes, with Arnold doing the
throwing and Thigpen and Lewis the
receiving accounted for the fourth
Card score.
Hunt has a fine pair of tackles in
Doub and Grey, and they played
hcads-up football yesterday.
