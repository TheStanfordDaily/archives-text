# DIAMETER OF TELESCOPE TO BE 220 INCHES
## Will Enable Scientists To See Millions of Stars Never Observed Heretofore 
### 
PASADENA, Oct. 28. (/P)—The larg
est telescope ever made, twice as big
and four times as powerful as the
present greatest instrument, will be
erected on some yet undesignated
California mountain top. It will be a
220-inch reflector.
Announcement of this plan, one of
the most dazzling steps in astronomi
cal research in many years, was made
here tonight, and two outstanding
aims were outlined. One is the capa
city to detect millions of celestial
bodies never before seen. The other
is organization on a national scope of
scientists and business men to insure
maximum results. The announcement
was made by the California Institute
of Technology.
The present world's largest tele
scope is the 100-inch reflector of
Mount Wilson, the 220-inch reflector,
as large as the floor of a good-sized
room, will have four times the power
of the 100-inch. For example, the
canals of Mars in the new instrument
will show twice the diameter of the
100-inch images, but this doubled
diameter means they have four times
the size and four times the light.
The building of the reflector has
been undertaken by the General Elec
tric Company, under direction of Dr.
Elihu Thomson, one of the Company's
founders. The reflector will be of
fused quartz, a substance that ex
pands and contracts less than glass
in changes of temperature, and which
therefore preserves a more perfect
surface. In polishing, a 220-inch glass
could be ground but ten minutes per
day because of heating, while the
fused quartz can be ground continu
ously.
