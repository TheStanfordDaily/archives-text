# Never the Proctor System!

Although the general student attitude toward the honor system is a
sympathetic one, at least if the action of the seniors is any criterion,
nevertheless doubts have been cast against the venerable institution in
the present campaign of revivification—doubts and objections which
are seriously offered, yet not, we think, unanswerable.
In today's Campus Opinion column a writer makes the point that the
burden of seeing that conduct in class is honorable should not be shoul
dered by the student, but by the instructor, who is the one interested in
the elimination of cheating from his classroom. "It is perfectly fair,"
according to this writer, "to demand that the student make himself a
committee of one to see that he does not cheat." But it is not right, he
argues, for the Senior Class to expect a member to stand and call atten
tion to a discovered cheater.
When we survey this case, we see that some of the premises are
false. That it is the instructor's sole interest to eliminate cheating is not
true; he might even conceivably have no interest in that cause. Whose
grade is relatively lowered when a student cheats? That of the honest
student. It would seem that self-respect and a concern for self-protec
tion would lead the latter to denounce the one attempting to take ad
vantage of him. Moreover, the proctor system, under which faculty
supervision over examinations is exercised, is at the best a substitute
for the honor system —a substitute which would have to be resorted to
shamefacedly. To adopt the proctor system would be to admit that
students are unable to trust one another to act honestly, and unwillingly,
for their own safeguard, to insist upon such action. One expects
honesty when he plays bridge, for example; why not when he writes an
examination?
