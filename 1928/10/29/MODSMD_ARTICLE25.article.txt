# Since When Was This Treason?

### 
The editor of the Utah University Chronicle, Mac Alan Gardner,
wrote an editorial criticizing Herbert Hoover quite sharply.
He then announced he was transferring to the University of Cali
fornia, and straightway a new editor took over the duties of editing
the Chronicle.
The editorial which caused what virtually amounts to Gardner's
expulsion was appended to an account of a speech by Hoover and is
as follows:
"If this be reason make the least of it. How does Herb have
the crust to stand under the shadow of Teapot Dome and say to
intelligent people: 'Our ideals in national life must be the inspira
tion and guide in our action.' This is the sort of stuff that re
duces modern politics to absurdity, in fact, ad nauseam."
While candor forces the admission that the editorial was none too
shrewd, still it is hard to see why publication of it in the university
paper would embarrass the editor to the point of forced resignation.
Albeit not elegantly phrased, the query was one which might -stick in
the crop of almost any Republican.
Our editorial" heart goes out to Mr. Gardner for having to quit under
fire for the commission of so trivial, not to say doubtful, offense.
