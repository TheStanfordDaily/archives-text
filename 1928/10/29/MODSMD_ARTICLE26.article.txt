# A 						"Yes" Vote on No. 2 Urged
## 
### 
Supporters of the tenth modern Olympic Games, to be held in
California in 1932, are asking the consent of the people to the issuance
of a million dollars in bonds, in order that California may do its share
toward defraying the costs of the great athletic carnival.
The Daily urges students to write to their parents and friends asking
them to vote in favor of the proposition. Stanford, along with other
California colleges, has appeared with great credit in former Olympic
Games. Many field and track championships, as well as diving and
swimming and the more recent crew championships, have brought credit
to California universities.
The holding of the Olympic Games will afford an excellent oppor
tunity for California and the various universities and colleges of the
State to act as hosts to athletes from foreign countries which heretofore
have entertained us.
It would seem to us that there is every reason why the University
should support measure No. 2 and none why it should not. There is only
one technicality which may at the time arise to cause jealousy or ill
feeling between host and guests, and that is the importation by the
Oxford crew and by other foreign athletes of beer, upon which to train.
At any rate, let us vote "yes," relying on the hope that the training ration
will be admitted to the country along with the athletes.

Tryoutees for the editorial staff of the Daily will meet at 1 o'clock
today.
