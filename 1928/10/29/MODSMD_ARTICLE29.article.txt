TIME FOR ACTION
The feud between Encina Commons
and the eating club and freshman
forces is at a standstill. Each side
has publicly aired its grievances and
is now busy looking for statistics
with which to support it. Neither side
has made one constructive move, so
it. may not be amiss for an outsider
to suggest a few things that might
be done.
The position of the authorities in
charge of Encina Commons is a diffi
cult one. When the building was
erected, its purpose was to provide a
place where freshmen could eat. Its
aim is to protect them and to make
certain that they eat regularly and
well. To satisfy the demands of par
ents that their children should be fed
good food, the University requires
that only the best quality of goods be
purchased. That this is done can
easily be proved.
But it is equally true that it is the
duty of Encina Commons to furnish
this food at a cost commensurate
with the contents of the student
purse. Thus Encina authorities are
trying to do two things at once and
judging by the uproar have so far
failed to satisfy.
It might be well to consider the de
mands of the freshmen and the eat
ing club men and see what they want.
The freshmen would be satisfied with
palatable food six days a week at
one dollar a day. Their petition ask
ing for food for seven days a week
at the same price they are now pay
ing was a roundabout way of stating
this, for they felt that it would be
unwise to ask for a refund of money
they had already paid.
That is also what the eating club
men want. If they are forced to con
tinue paying at the present rate, they
will not be able to add to their mem
bership and will therefore soon be
come extinct. There is also the fact
that they claim that they are charged
sixty cents for guest meals even when
the guests are freshmen who have al
ready paid for the meal. This is de
nied. This little difficulty should be
easy to straighten out, however. But
it should be arranged so that a club
member does not have to ask his
freshman guest to bring his own
ticket, for that would be a trifle em
barrassing.
These demands certainly seem rea
sonable. If each side would give' way
a little, an amicable settlement should
be reached. Club members argue that
other living groups are getting as
good or better food for one dollar a
day. Yes, but Encina serves coffee,
tea or milk whereas water is the
usual drink at other places unless an
extra charge is made. Sequoia, the
only place which compares to Encina
in the number of people served, is an
exception since a choice of coffee, tea,
or milk is offered at every meal with
the exception of dinner, when just
coffee and tea are offered. But as an
aid to solving the problem at Encina,
why not let those who wish something
to drink with their meals pay for it?
If that does not reduce the expenses
sufficiently why not omit the salad
at lunch and give a better entree and
dessert? Less variety with more
quality would result in more satis
faction.
There is another change that might
increase satisfaction on the part of
clubmen and freshmen although it
may cost a little money. The last fig
ures which the writer saw showed
that only about 50 per cent of the
men eat breakfast at the commons,
since 7:15 to 7:30 is the hour at
which this meal is served. This is
necessary because the hashers must
have time to clean up and go to their
8 o'clock classes.
Why not have a lighter breakfast
and serve it cafeteria style? It could
be ruit, toast, and a choice of coffee,
chocolate or milk. If this were served
from 7:30 to 8:30 or any hour which
might be decided on, nearly everyone
would be able to take advantage of
breakfast.
If this is not feasible, why not
eliminate breakfast altogether? If
it is true that only about 50 per cent

of the men are eating breakfast now,
probably a large part of the other 50
per cent are missing this meal en
tirely because they feel that they
cannot afford to pay for breakfast in
addition to the $1.20 per day which
they are paying. In other words, En
cina Commons is falling down on its
duty to the students when it makes
it inconvenient for them to eat three
meals every day.
Both the freshmen and the eating
clubs have committees which are
working on this problem. These com
mittees should combine, decide upon
what they want, and then co-operate
with the authorities to end this un
pleasant situation as soon as possible.
If a solution is not decided upon
immediately both sides will lose by
it. If the clubs leave Encina, the large
overhead expense will be shouldered
by a comparatively small group of
freshmen. Also Encina will lose its
large buying power. The clubs have
already lost a number of members
■who could not see their way clear to
pay $1.25 a day. The club members
will lose the opportunity for compan
ionship which their organization af
fords and the men will be driven to
Palo Alto to eat. This means that
they might stint themselves on food.
Delay in arbitration will only make
matters worse. Immediate action
would save time, money, and dissen
sion. —J. H.
