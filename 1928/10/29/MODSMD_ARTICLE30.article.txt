The Editor, Sir:
What are the advantages that the
student derives from the Honor Sys
tem? Will someone please number
them in black and white? There must
be something that is very valuable to
the student in this Honor System, or
he would not get into such a heat
trying to reconstruct this system
which is "creaking" no more now than
it ever has, and which has been tried
and found wanting.
The anticipated answer to this ar
ticle is this: The Honor System builds
up a sense of honor in the individual
and strengthens his moral character.
That sounds beautiful, but is it so?
At Harvard University they have no
Honor System. They have a police
system. Now I defy anyone to say
that the Harvard man lias a weaker
sense of honor than the Stanford
man.
The advantages that the university
authorities get from the Honor Sys
tem are obvious. Such a system sim
ply shifts all the trouble and respon
sibility from their shoulders onto the
students'. The student during an ex

j amiuation has not got the time to j
check up on the Honor System, and
it isn't fair for the university au
thorities to demand that he do the
work for them. It is for their own
sake and not for the student's sake
that the august powers are such ar
! dent supporters of the Honor System.
It is perfectly fair to demand that
the student make himself a committee
of one to see that he does not cheat;
but that is not all that we are asked
to do. The senior class has asked its
members to make a public announce
ment if they see any cheating. When
we have to enforce the Honor System,
have we an Honor System \ That red
blooded, two-listed individual who
stands squarely upon his feet with
| Jaw protruded and chest expanded j
and announces: "There is someone
cheating in this room." Isn't he a
policeman? Aren't we making a
bunch of policemen out of the student i
body when we request that they |
check up on each other? Do you call
this any Honor System?
If all students are not willing to |
make themselves a committee of one '
to see that they don't cheat, we can't |
have an Honor System. Why not j
have an efficient police force com-1
posed of faculty men and do away'
with that inefficient check of the poor
student who is laboring over a tough
exam in insects and diseases, or what
have you? A senior should know it is
impossible to write a good exam and
be a good policeman at the same
time.
We all know the evils of the police
system, but we have a police system
plus the evils of inefficiency. We are
destined to have a police system so
why not have an adequate police
force? This can be accomplished by
i throwing the police burden onto the
shoulders of its owner, the university.
We have struggled and stumbled long
enough with a burden that should not
be ours.

' The Editor, Sir:
If it is impossible to induce anyone
but Mr. Philip Space to edit "Cab
bages and Things," the column should
be abolished. Poor jokes may be for
given, but such scurrility as the first
comment in today's column (October
24) is not to be tolerated. Any fool
I can think of innumerable such wise
cracks. Only one lacking the instincts
of a gentleman would print them.

The Editor, Sir:
What are the advantages that the
student derives from the Honor Sys
tem? Will someone please number
them in black and white? There must
be something that is very valuable to
the student in this Honor System, or
he would not get into such a heat
trying to reconstruct this system
which is "creaking" no more now than
it ever has, and which has been tried
and found wanting.
The anticipated answer to this ar
ticle is this: The Honor System builds
up a sense of honor in the individual
and strengthens his moral character.
That sounds beautiful, but is it so?
At Harvard University they have no
Honor System. They have a police
system. Now I defy anyone to say
that the Harvard man lias a weaker
sense of honor than the Stanford
man.
The advantages that the university
authorities get from the Honor Sys
tem are obvious. Such a system sim
ply shifts all the trouble and respon
sibility from their shoulders onto the
students'. The student during an ex

j amiuation has not got the time to j
check up on the Honor System, and
it isn't fair for the university au
thorities to demand that he do the
work for them. It is for their own
sake and not for the student's sake
that the august powers are such ar
! dent supporters of the Honor System.
It is perfectly fair to demand that
the student make himself a committee
of one to see that he does not cheat;
but that is not all that we are asked
to do. The senior class has asked its
members to make a public announce
ment if they see any cheating. When
we have to enforce the Honor System,
have we an Honor System \ That red
blooded, two-listed individual who
stands squarely upon his feet with
| Jaw protruded and chest expanded j
and announces: "There is someone
cheating in this room." Isn't he a
policeman? Aren't we making a
bunch of policemen out of the student i
body when we request that they |
check up on each other? Do you call
this any Honor System?
If all students are not willing to |
make themselves a committee of one '
to see that they don't cheat, we can't |
have an Honor System. Why not j
have an efficient police force com-1
posed of faculty men and do away'
with that inefficient check of the poor
student who is laboring over a tough
exam in insects and diseases, or what
have you? A senior should know it is
impossible to write a good exam and
be a good policeman at the same
time.
We all know the evils of the police
system, but we have a police system
plus the evils of inefficiency. We are
destined to have a police system so
why not have an adequate police
force? This can be accomplished by
i throwing the police burden onto the
shoulders of its owner, the university.
We have struggled and stumbled long
enough with a burden that should not
be ours.
