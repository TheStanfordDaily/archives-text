# TIBBETT CONCERT DRAWS APPLAUSE OF BIG AUDIENCE
## Baritone Reaches Highlight With His Portrayal of "Old Man River" 
### 
Poised and gracious, Lawrence Tib
bett held an eager audience by the
charm of his personality and the
beauty of his voice, for two hours and
a half last Friday night when he
opened the Stanford musical season
in the Pavilion. Warm, spontaneous
applause greeted every number, and
it was only when the audience gath
ered the significance of "it's a song
we could very well do without," the
last encore, that the California bari
tone was allowed to leave the stage.
The outstanding characteristic of
Tibbett's singing is the intellectual
quality of his work. Tibbett sings
with his mind. His technique and his
voice are perfect, and to these he
adds a sympathetic and intelligent
understanding of the songs, portray
ing this understanding by the aid of
his remarkable dramatic ability.
His entrance on the stage was sin
gularly effective showing the true ac
tor's touch in contemplating his au
dience, and making sure each specta
tor was with him before he began, as
a romantic Italian lover Giordano's
"Caro Mio Ben.'" Tibbett sang this
in full sympathy with the sweetness
and softnesß, as well as the strength
and power of love. There Avas light
vivacity and the cavalier spirit in the
selections from the "Beggar's Opera."
The baritone's articulation and dic
tion were splendid, so splendid in fact
that the words of the songs were
clearly audible to those even in the
last row of the house.
Schumann's work was sung with
feeling and charm. The accompanist,
Will Garroway, played the soft magi
cal composition of Cyril Scott's, and
his own piece "April" with a great
delicacy of touch. His second compo
sition was a bit too modern in its
disregard of the natural scale for its
lull appreciation.
The highlight of the program came
when as an encore to his splendid
presentation of Pagliacci's Prologue,
Tibbett gave that picture of the
American south, "Old Man River."
The audience's familiarity with the
music helped the singer to carry it
to the heights of artistic power. No
one has ever sung that piece as Tib
bett sang it, and probably no one
ever will. His simple comment after
the burst of applause following it was,
"I'm glad you liked that. I like it too."

the burst of applause following it was,
"I'm glad you liked that. I like it too."
Poised and gracious, Lawrence Tib
bett held an eager audience by the
charm of his personality and the
beauty of his voice, for two hours and
a half last Friday night when he
opened the Stanford musical season
in the Pavilion. Warm, spontaneous
applause greeted every number, and
it was only when the audience gath
ered the significance of "it's a song
we could very well do without," the
last encore, that the California bari
tone was allowed to leave the stage.
The outstanding characteristic of
Tibbett's singing is the intellectual
quality of his work. Tibbett sings
with his mind. His technique and his
voice are perfect, and to these he
adds a sympathetic and intelligent
understanding of the songs, portray
ing this understanding by the aid of
his remarkable dramatic ability.
His entrance on the stage was sin
gularly effective showing the true ac
tor's touch in contemplating his au
dience, and making sure each specta
tor was with him before he began, as
a romantic Italian lover Giordano's
"Caro Mio Ben.'" Tibbett sang this
in full sympathy with the sweetness
and softnesß, as well as the strength
and power of love. There Avas light
vivacity and the cavalier spirit in the
selections from the "Beggar's Opera."
The baritone's articulation and dic
tion were splendid, so splendid in fact
that the words of the songs were
clearly audible to those even in the
last row of the house.
Schumann's work was sung with
feeling and charm. The accompanist,
Will Garroway, played the soft magi
cal composition of Cyril Scott's, and
his own piece "April" with a great
delicacy of touch. His second compo
sition was a bit too modern in its
disregard of the natural scale for its
lull appreciation.
The highlight of the program came
when as an encore to his splendid
presentation of Pagliacci's Prologue,
Tibbett gave that picture of the
American south, "Old Man River."
The audience's familiarity with the
music helped the singer to carry it
to the heights of artistic power. No
one has ever sung that piece as Tib
bett sang it, and probably no one
ever will. His simple comment after
the burst of applause following it was,
"I'm glad you liked that. I like it too."
