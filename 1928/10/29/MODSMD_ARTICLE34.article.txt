# MATERIALS FOR BONFIRE ARRIVE; '32 BEGINS WORK
## 
### 
Materials for the annual bonfire are
beginning to arrive on the campus
opposite the Encina gym and much
more has been arranged for, accord
ing to the freshman committee in
charge of the big blaze. No difficulty
is being encountered in getting a
large number of men out to work, it
is reported, and everything is moving
smoothly.
Arrangements are being made to have
the corner posts set for the frame work
the first part of the week and it is
expected that the structure will go up
rapidly therafter. Men have ben scour
ing the Peninsula for combustibles and
modes of transportation for the past
week.
Seekers of material to burn have been
very successful, the committee state, but
there is yet a need for trucks to convey
the material to the fire. Anyone know
ing of a truck that may be borrowed for
this purpose is asked to get in touch
with Dick Brodcrick, 223 Encina, who
is in general charge of the fire.
For the past week freshmen have been
making a systematic canvas of the entire
vicinity in an effort to secure all the ma
terial necessary for the lire and to ar
range it so that little time is lost when
the trucks start hauling. Members of
the searching parties have lieen particu
larly instructed to confine their activities
to the section assigned in an effort to
prevent repeated calls being made on
some people. It is said that much annoy
ance and loss of time have been caused
in the past by aimless searching parties.
Although the size of fires have been
limited to a square of thirty feet and to
fifty feet in height, the freshmen are
attempting to pack the structure solid
so that a "real fire" will greet the gaze
of the public when the torch is applied
on the night of the Big Game rally.
Science has been summoned to the aid
of the freshmen, and engineering stu
dents are to design the fire so that a
sufficient draught will be created when
the blaze is started. The engineers hope
to plan the structure so that it will
burn evenly and stay upright for a con
siderable period after the match is
struck.
