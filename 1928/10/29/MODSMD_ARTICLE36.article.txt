By STEWART WAY
Today we shall discuss briefly the
economic program of the Socialist party.
Where is "Republican Prosperity?"
Norman Thomas calls our attention to
the fact that one-third of all our people
sixty-five years of age and upwards are
compelled to accept whole or partial
charity. Tenant farming has reached a
proportion of almost forty per cent. By
conservative estimate, there are at least
four million unemployed right now in
the United States, and while real wages
have risen for certain groups, they have
risen scarcely more than half the in
crease in the productive power of the
workers. We have made great headway
in developing machinery to do useful
work, but instead of being used to
shorten the hours of labor, machines
have been used to make more profits for
their owners.
Wealth Not General
We agree that there is more pros
perity in America now than in any other
country in the world, but it is remarkable
how that prosperity tends to bunch in the
hands of a few men.
We would call your attention to a few
of the chief features of the economic
program of the Socialist Party.
1. Wc need a publicly owned giant
power system under which the Federal
Government shall co-operate with the
states and municipalities in the distribu
tion of electrical energy to the people
at cost. Only when public agencies have
full control over the generation, trans
mission, and distribution of electrical
power, can the consumers be guaranteed
against exploitation by the great power
interests of the country. Public owner
ship of these and other industries must
include employee representation in their
management, and the principle of collect
ive bargaining must be recognized.
System Is Proven
We call attention to the fact that such
a power system as this is in operation
in Ontario, Canada, and the cost of light
and power to the consumers is one-third
of the average cost to consumers in the
United States.
2. A system of employment insurance
must be developed.
3. We need a system of health and ac
cident insurance and old age pensions, as
well as unemployment insurance.
Old age pensions are not a form of
charity, but are a return to aged workers
of the wealth created by them during
their years of active labor.
Want Child Labor Law
4. Enactment of a Federal Anti-Cliild
Labor Law is demanded.
5. Abolition of injunctions in labor dis
putes is demanded.
Injunctions are plainly unconstitution
al. No such compromising promise as
that of Governor Smith to remove
"abuses" in the use of the injunction,
should be tolerated by real progressives.
6. Aquisition by Federal, State, and
municipal governments of distributing
agencies for farm products (stockyards,
grain elevators, storage warehouses, etc.)
and the conduct of these services on a
non-profit basis. Also social insurance
against losses to farmers due to hail,
drought, cyclone, and flood, must be
created.
We challenge the reader to find any
commitments as these in the sayings of
Mr. Hoover or Mr. Smith, or in the
platforms of the two parties owned and
financed by the capitalist class.
