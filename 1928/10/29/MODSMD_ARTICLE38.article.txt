# STANFORD GRAYS WHIP ST. MARY'S "GOOFS" 18 TO 7
## 
### 
Long runs and accurate passes de
cided the game for the Stanford Grays
against the St. Mary's Reserves last
Saturday morning. Throughout the
contest the Saints were completely at
a loss to solve the fast reverses and
sneaks of the Grays. The final score
was 18 to 7, and it was only by a
lucky break that the Gaels scored at
all.
A few minutes after the first play,
a long pass from Moffat to May
counted for the initial score of the
Grays. It was a beautiful play, and
after snagging the pass, May ran
thirty yards for the touchdown. Late
in the second period, Bill Laird pro
vided the thrill of the day, when he
took a punt on his own ten-yard line
and ran ninety yards through the
whole Saint team for a touchdown.
The final score for the Grays came in
the'final quarter when Moffat bucked
tho ball down the field for a goal.
The Gael reserves made their only
touchdown just as the final gun went
off. They picked up a Stanford fumble
and with five men as interference, ran
fifty yards to a touchdown. The goal
was converted after the final gun was
shot.
The Grays' line functioned beauti
fully in Saturday's contest. It out
charged the opposition on every play
and was working as a unit at all
times. Erhorn and Oliver at the tackle
positions showed up excellently, as
did Miller and Dawson at guard. Al
bertson played his usual consistent
game at center, and Wittenau and
Reynolds at ends proved to be strong
wingmen.
The Gray backfield looked especial
ly good on pass plays. May snatched
passes that seemed impossible to
catch, and Moffat's throwing was ac
curate. Little Bill Laird was the thrill
provider for the day. On end runs and
at running back punts, he was prac
tically unstoppable. His average for
returning kicks was close to thirty
yards, and only once was he thrown
for a loss. Saunders and Carrol looked
good in the quarterback position, and
the former's work at backing up the
line was outstanding.
