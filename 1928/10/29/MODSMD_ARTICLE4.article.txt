# GAIETIES TRIALS WILL BE HELD IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### 
Tryouts for all singing, dancing,
and specialty acts for the Football
Guieties will be held tomorrow after
noon from 3 to 5 o'clock in the Little
Theatre, announces Stan Mullin, mem
ber of the committee planning the
Ilam's Head Show.
Opportunities are open for all kinds
of skits, and these do not have to be
in complete or finished form. Anyone
who has an idea for a skit but has
not yet worked it out is asked to bring
it tomorrow, for this will probably be
the only tryout period open to the
campus at large, says Mullin.
There will be opportunities espe
cially for tap dancers, and any kind
of dancing from interpretive to clog.
Singing or dancing duets and quartets
are also wanted.
The Football Gaieties will be given
under the auspices of Ilam's Head the
night before the Big Game, Friday,
November 23. Jack Meaken is in
charge of the music for the show, and
Gordon Davis is directing.
