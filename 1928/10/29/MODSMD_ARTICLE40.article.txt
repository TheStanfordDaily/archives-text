Oct. 26th
This morning my thoughts much
f.gitated by the new economic prob
lem of this line campus, to wit, the
prevalence of hoof and mouth disease
in Argentina. Out riding, the other
day with my zaney, did observe a fine
flock of healthy mutton, which he did
call mockingly the "University Lawn
Mower," and now am doing much cal
culations of a mathematical nature
on how long one flock of domestic
sheep would last three hundred hun
gry freshmen.
» * *
Do wonder greatly that enterpris
ing restaurants in Palo Alto have not
offered special rates for the irate eat
ing club men, and so put the question
of how shall feed them on a competi
tive basis, so that it shall be a privi
lege to board them instead of a duty.
Would be much amused to watch a
student strike, and would all the
women then be called out on a sym
pathy strike, and would we be taken
out to dinner at a discount? But
Lord! with the freshmen class now
less than a tenth of the whole Uni
versity, do suppose they will have a
hard time getting organized, what
with their important duties on bon
fires and citizenship classes. Do find
the fare at Roble appetizing for the
great part, though I am so hungry by
meal time that my palate is not dis
criminating, but do find a prevalence
of starches, and so do eat many let
tuce sandwiches, whenever I am out,
to subsidize my vitamins.
♦ * *
Last night to the concert, and did
remind myself oftentimes of the pro
gram of Mr. Tibbett's first concert in
San Francisco. He did sing then to a
small and scarcely enthusiastic au
dience, which was completely forgot
ten when he did return from the East
with a metropolitan reputation. Am
glad that I did enjoy his voice these
three times equally, and that I did not
watch the barometer of public opin
ion. Which set me to wondering how
at present we do talk a great lot about
the Fine West and Western Art, but
do make no great ado about anything
rhat has not received the New York
stamp. So to the Sigma Delta Chi
dance in a reflective mood, and found
myself enamoured with the clubroom
of Branner Hall, and to wishing jolly
ups were held there.

remind myself oftentimes of the pro
gram of Mr. Tibbett's first concert in
San Francisco. He did sing then to a
small and scarcely enthusiastic au
dience, which was completely forgot
ten when he did return from the East
with a metropolitan reputation. Am
glad that I did enjoy his voice these
three times equally, and that I did not
watch the barometer of public opin
ion. Which set me to wondering how
at present we do talk a great lot about
the Fine West and Western Art, but
do make no great ado about anything
rhat has not received the New York
stamp. So to the Sigma Delta Chi
dance in a reflective mood, and found
myself enamoured with the clubroom
of Branner Hall, and to wishing jolly
ups were held there.

This morning my thoughts much
f.gitated by the new economic prob
lem of this line campus, to wit, the
prevalence of hoof and mouth disease
in Argentina. Out riding, the other
day with my zaney, did observe a fine
flock of healthy mutton, which he did
call mockingly the "University Lawn
Mower," and now am doing much cal
culations of a mathematical nature
on how long one flock of domestic
sheep would last three hundred hun
gry freshmen.

Do wonder greatly that enterpris
ing restaurants in Palo Alto have not
offered special rates for the irate eat
ing club men, and so put the question
of how shall feed them on a competi
tive basis, so that it shall be a privi
lege to board them instead of a duty.
Would be much amused to watch a
student strike, and would all the
women then be called out on a sym
pathy strike, and would we be taken
out to dinner at a discount? But
Lord! with the freshmen class now
less than a tenth of the whole Uni
versity, do suppose they will have a
hard time getting organized, what
with their important duties on bon
fires and citizenship classes. Do find
the fare at Roble appetizing for the
great part, though I am so hungry by
meal time that my palate is not dis
criminating, but do find a prevalence
of starches, and so do eat many let
tuce sandwiches, whenever I am out,
to subsidize my vitamins.
