So Hornsby is to be traded or sold
to the Cubs! Trader Horn in all his
rumblings in Africa scarcely covered
more territory than Traded Hornsby
has in the National Leagueâ€”a new
filub every year for four years! And
you had better look out, Mr. Joe Mc-
Carthy; he'll get your job if you don't
look out, for he managed the Cards to
a pennant in 1926, managed the Giants
in 1927 when McGraw was ill, and
soon after ho was traded to the
Braves, he got Jack Slattery's job as
manager of the Hub team.
But to get back to the old gentle
man with the chin whiskers, Alfred
Aloysius Horn, whose entertaining
stories,, set down by Ethelreda Lewis,
created such a sensation a few
months ago, Trader Horn went around
peddling gridirons and telling his ad
ventures to any member of the Will
ing Ea-rs Society who happened to be
around.. They made quite a hit, in
fact as big a "hit" as Traded Horns
by eveK made at bat. Trader Horn's
average was around .400, and after a
brief visit to America, he made a
home run with his pockets bulging
with money.
Now, Rogers "Alfred Aloysius"
Hornsby doesn't wear a long beard,
although he's been starring in the
National League for lo these fifteen
years. His black bat has carved for

him a permanent niche in Baseball's
Hall of Fame, and his annual trans
fer to another team has earned him
the title of "Traded" Hornsby. Al
though no official announcement is
as yet forthcoming, the fact that the
Rajah will hold down second base for
the Cubs next season is assured. The
Braves will get a couple of hundred
thousand dollars, a few players, and
a new manager.
And to which club will Hornsby be
traded in 1929? Reds, Pirates, Robins,
or Phillies?
