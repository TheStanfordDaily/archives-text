# CHOLERA TO BE TOPIC OF SPEECH BY DR. D'HERELLE
## Discovery of Bacteriophagy Earns Scientist Rare Medical Praise 
### 
Several outstanding awards and
honors have been received by Dr. F.
d'Herelle, discoverer of bacteriophagy,
who will lecture on "My Mission to
India for the Study of Cholera" to
morrow night at 7:30 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall.
In 1923 the degree of "Doctor of
Medicine Honoris Causa" was award
ed to him by the University of Ley
den. Dr. d'Herelle is the only man
now holding the degree from this
university. In 1925 the Amsterdam
Academy of Sciences awarded him the
Leewunhoek Medal, given every ten
years to the man who has done most
to advance our knowledge regarding
the lower forms of life. Pasteur is
among those who have received the
award in the past.
After completing his medical and
bacteriological studies in Paris, Dr.
d'Herelle was engaged as bacteriolo
gist in connection with certain inves
tigations for the Canadian Govern
ment, and later for the governments
of Guatemala and Yucatan. In 1908
he went to the Pasteur Institute in
Paris, where he remained until 1922.
The lecturer accepted an appoint
ment in 1924 as Director of the Bac
teriological Service of the Sanitary,
Maritime and Quarantine Council of
Egypt. During his stay in Egypt he
made two trips to India at the re
quest of the British Government to
study methods of controlling cholera
in this country. It is regarding these
studies that Dr. d'Herelle will speak
on Tuesday evening.
