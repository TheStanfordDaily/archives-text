# Cushing Comedy Called Amazing By W. L. Phelps
## Eastern Production of "The Devil in the Cheese" Impresses Critic 
### 
All monks and shepherds in the
i "Devil and the Cheese" must re
port without fail for rehearsal to
night at 7 o'clock in the Assembly
hall, announces Gordon Davis.
"The most amazing play on Broad
way" was the opinion of William
j Lyons Phelps, president of Yale Uni
j versity and well-known dramatic
i critic in New York, concerning Tom
| Cushing's comedy, "The Devil in the
j Cheese," when it was produced at the
i Charles Hopkins Theatre, New York.
This play will be given in the Assem
bly Hall by Sword and Sandals on
November 9. The campus seat sale
j opens on Wednesday, when applica
; tion blanks for preferred seats to the
; "Gaieties" will be given anyone buy
j ing four tickets.
i "The Devil in the Cheese" is un
usual in plot and philosophy. If a
| playwright were to take a number of
! seemingly incongrous elements such
as a modern American girl, a million
j aire from Kansas, a steward from an
Atlantic liner, a number of pastoral
i Greek shepherds, monks from an an
: cient Grecian monastery, monkeys
from the South Sea Islands, little
gods of Egypt, and a modern air
plane, would the result be a com
plete hodge-podge, or a nicely and
clevely worked-out comedy of modern
times? This is what Cushing has done
by putting a little devil in the cheese.
There is a certain piquancy about
the philosophy involved. Love is the
force that makes the world go round
j even if it does take a devil from a
! cheese, an Egyptian god, and a psycli
| ological visit to the mind of his daugh
ter to convince Joseph Quigley that
; love will conquer all obstacles in its
! way.
Gordon Davis is faced with an un
usually large cast in this play. Forty
five students have regular parts, and
the principals have had a good deal
of experience in previous campus
plays. There are five sets in the com
edy, and these offer Harold Helven
ston a wide variety and possibility
for originality and artistic departure
from the ordinary realistic set.
