Gentlemen:
Speaking of champion long-time
members of the EDGEWORTH Club,
say:—it isn't how long you have smoked
Edgeworth, it's how well you have en
joyed the smoke.
Why, I have walked out of many a
store, especially when traveling, to
stop at some one-horse town and buy
Edgeworth. A good pipe deserves
Edgeworth, and Edgeworth mine gets.
I would not insult it with any other.
"The familiar blue cans are every
where," and usually you find men of
taste carrying them, which proves it is
not the price that determines a good
"smoky" tobacco, but the care and
method that produce it.
I would rather go days without
Edgeworth and at the end draw a deep
inhale of that cool "smelly" aroma,
satisfying to the last puff, than punish
my throat and lungs and nostrils with
inferior grades.
Edgeworth is "The Smoke With a
Personality," like an old friend, you
learn to know and understand, and
when troubled or when you have a
"thinky" problem —you seek its sol
ace and companionship.
Very truly yours,
(signed) E. H. Fulmer
