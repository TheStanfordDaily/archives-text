Now that (With apologies to "Chappie")*
The invasion of Troy will soon begin and thou
sands of Sons of the Stanford Red will journey
by train, boat, auto, and what have you, to see
the Cards upset the Trojan War Horse and in
cidentally Howard Jones' pet ambition, namely,
to defeat "Pop" Warner—and at the same time
the Card Yearlings will attempt to tame the
Trojan Colts right in our own back yard . . .
May we call your attention to the following—
1. That this shop is open from 12 till 9 on week-days and from
9 till 7:30 on Saturday (closing from 2 to 5 during football games).
2. That "Row" men are welcome at any time and that contrary to
the general impression THERE IS NO RESTRICTION ON "ROW
MEN" VISITING THIS STORE even though it is located in Encina.
Now with that off our chest, how about touching up
that wardrobe with those little things that seem trivial
but are quite important such as Cravats —Shirts —
Hosiery—Silk Mufflers—and other items of dress. And
accessories for Formal Wear —complete in every detail.
Be there with a Trench Coat!
