# SMITH POLICY ARRAIGNED BY JOHN L. McNAB
## Hoover Nominator Declares Democrats Unable to Fulfill Promises Of Action 
### PHILIP STOCKTON 
Charging that Governor Smith's posi
tion on most campaign issues was "in
defensible," John L. McNab, Pacific
Coast Republican leader, scored Governor
Smith's stand on Boulder Dam, farm re
lief, and prohibition in a written inter
view given to the writer for the Stanford
Daily. A jurist of national note, Mr.
McNab is even better known to the gen
eral public as the man who nominated
Herbert Hoover at the Republican con
vention. Mr. McNab's statement fol
lows :
"On most of the issues raised by the
distinguished governor of New York, his
position is utterly indefensible. With a
great show of authoritative finality he
declares himself on a great number of
questions upon which, it is obvious, he
has failed to be informed. A notable in
stance is the Boulder Creek Dam.
"For seven years the Boulder Dam
project has been fighting its way through
the slow process of federal legislation to
final passage. The Federal Government
is about to be committed to this great
engineering task by Congress, at its
forthcoming session.
Oppose Boulder Dam
"In his opening addresses of the cam
paign Governor Smith vigorously de
clared that immediately on his election
he would demand action. Quite proper.
But what kind of action? We have only
to look at his acceptance speech to dis
cover that the action he demands will
be the overthrow of the entire project as
a Federal proposal. In that address,
which was obviously prepared without
mature consideration, he declares for the
scrapping of the whole project and the
setting up of a commission of seven states
to handle and finance Boulder Creek Dam
under a treaty of their own. In thus de
claring for the wrecking of the whole
Federal plan, he ends with the amusing
assertion that "The only interest of the
Federal government in the Colorado is i
that of navigation." I leave to the i
American spirit of humor the picture of
anyone navigating the waters of the Colo- j
rado. Two parties have gone down the '
roaring canyon, and have emerged happy
that their lives were not forfeit to the ;
adventure.
Smith Asks Impossible
"But it is tragic that anyone pretending
to statesmanship should now suggest the
abandonment of the project and ask the
states to undertake the impossible task
of agreeing to bond themselves for two
hundred million dollars to perform the
work. A century of effort could not
bring that about.
"It is not even necessary to discuss
prohibition, as a moral issue. The New
York governor and Mr. Raskob have
denounced the prohibition law as a
damnnable outrage, and have then fer
vently declared that he would enforce it
to the letter. For good measure, the
Democratic candidate has also roundly
abused delinquent Republicans for their
failure to enforce this 'damnable outrage.'
Those who have listened to the gover
nor's radio speeches have been thrilled
by the wild acclaim with which his drip
ping audiences have greeted his vigorous
promise to enforce the law that keeps
them dry 1
Candidate Shows Humor
"The Democratic candidate is not de- |
void of humor. He must enjoy the pros
pect of asking his Democratic congress
men to repeal the law, when out of the
twenty-three he is vigorously supporting, j
twenty-one are irrevocably committed j
against meddling with the Volstead Act.
"On the issue of the dissatisfied farmer 1
the Democratic party expected to sweep
the middle West. With much vocal thrill, ;
again he voiced the farmers' wrongs, !
and caustically denounced the opposition ;
for failing to pass relief legislation. 1
Again he demanded action. But again, !
what kind? But some unkind newspaper
published his interview before he became
a presidential candidate in which be said, '
'I don't know anything that can be done
for the< farmer unless he helps himself.
He can't expect anyone to help him un- j
til lie gets ready to come down from his |
seat on the top of the world.' After be- |
ing enmeshed in a number of apparently ;
contradictory statements as to his atti- j
tude on the McNary-llaugen plan, he |
announced to the eager farmers that, if I
elected, he will appoint a committee to
study the question. This is not the
'action' the farmer needs.
Hoover Promises Relief
"In contrast there is Mr. Hoover's
statement of the grounds of the farmers'
trouble followed by his promise to give
relief by a special session of congressâ€”
to consider nothing else until the problem
is solved.
"Governor Smith's position has been
embarrassed by the support of his run
ning-mate, Senator Robinson, who criti
cizes Hoover for alleged antagonism to j
the McNary-Haugen Bill. Senator Robin- j
son, in a powerful speech in the Senate. I
denounced the speech as 'unconstitutional, I
unworkable, and un-American.' Help j
from such a quarter is of doutbful value.
But this controversy disappeared when
both Senator McNary and Congressman
Haugen, joint authors of the bill, took
the stump for Herbert Hoover.
"Little has been heard above the roar
of campaign controversies about interna
tional policies. No one doubts that the
American people will be willing to en
trust to Herbert Hoover, in preference

to any other American, the delicate rela
tions with countries with whose prob
lems lie is almost as familiar as with our
own."
