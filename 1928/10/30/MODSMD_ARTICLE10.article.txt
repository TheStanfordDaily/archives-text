# OLD ORDER USED BY G.O.P. MUST GO SAYS AL
## Smith Describes Republican Policy as Reactionary In Baltimore Talk 
### 
BALTIMORE, Oct. 29. (/T>)—An en
thusiastic cheering mass of Baltimore
citizenry welcomed Governor Smith
on his arrival here late today.
"I am entirely unwilling to accept
the old order of things as the best
unless and until I become convinced
that it cannot be made better," said
the Governor in his speech here.
"The last quarter of a century has
seen the greatest material advance
that the world has probably ever wit
nessed. The Government alone seems
to be lagging in the march of progress.
There has been less improvement in
national government in the last seven
and a half years than in any similar
period during my public life.
"It is extremely difficult to make a
hard and fast rule with regard to our
relations with other countries. I have
often been prompted to the belief
that the administration of foreign af
fairs is largely based on the personal
equation, the sincere desire to be as
just and fair to other nations as we
would have them be to us.
Non-1 nterference
"I am satisfied that the protection

other hand, I am satisfied that the
American people will no longer toler

will be no diplomacy practiced that
will permit the exploitation of weaker
nations.
"I am entirely satisfied that the old
order of things can be changed for
the better by the adoption of a govern

water power resources. Applying the
old order of things, these resources
must in time fall into the hands of
private persons to be operated for pri
vate gain and private profit.
Government Disorganized
"Particularly am I unwilling to ac
cept the old order of things as it ap
plies to the framework and structure
of the Federal Government. Disjoint
ed, disorganized, scattered, producing
and overlapping of functions, a dupli
cation of energy, a financial waste
and a waste of effort, the old govern
mental machine is lumbering along.
"As against broken Republican
promise and failure and inability to
progress, I promise on behalf of the
Democratic Party the rehabilitation
and reorganization of the federal ma
chine, bringing it into harmonious and
progressive step with the material
development in business methods in
the last quarter of a century.
"Unwilling to accept the old order
of things as the best, I am entirely
dissatisfied wit hthe conditions pre
