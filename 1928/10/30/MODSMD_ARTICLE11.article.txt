# NO DANGER FROM 'FLU' SAYS DR. T. A. STOREY
## 
### 
Editor's Note: In reply to an inquiry
as to the large number of bad colds and
eases of influenza on the campus, Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, director of physical
education, yesterday issued the following
statement:
An unusually large number of
bad colds have been reported for
the Campus Community during
the past two or three weeks. Some
of these colds have been diag
nosed as "influenza." Similar re
ports have come in from various
towns and cities in California and
in other states. None of the
cases in this neighborhood have
been serious with perhaps one ex
ception.
The epidemic of colds here on
the Campus seems now to be sub
siding.
The best treatment for a cold is
rest and quiet In a comfortably
warm room, preferably in bed.
Colds with temperature should al
ways be put to bed and a physi
cian called. For most students
the hospital is the safest place to
go when sick.
The office of the Student Health
Service for Men are open every
week-day from 8:00 to 12:ft0 M.,
and 1:0 ft to 6:00 P.M., and on
Saturday and Sunday mornings
from 9:00 to 12:00 M. Students
who have colds or who do not feel
well are urged to report to these
offices for advice and help.
Sincerely,
Thomas A. Storey.
