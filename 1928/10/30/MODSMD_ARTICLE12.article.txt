# STANFORD IS HOOVER HOST NOVEMBER 5
## Campus Hoover Club Will Sponsor Community Homecoming 
### 
Stanford will welcome its most dis
tinguished son, Herbert C. Hoover,
upon his arrival at Palo Alto Novem
ber 5 at 1:30 o'clock. Following a
telephone conversation with George
Akerson, secretary to Herbert Hoover,
in Washington, D.C., last night, Her
bert Wenig, president of the Stanford
Hoover-for-President Club, announced
that in deference to the wishes of the
candidate there will be no elaborate
ceremonies or speeches. The reception
is planned as a spontaneous tribute
to Hoover, not as a political rally.
Preparations are being made for the
Stanford community by the campus
Hoover Club, which has been placed
in full charge of the reception by the
City of Palo Alto, to handle the large
turnout of Stanford students and
crowds of citizens who will throng the
station. The Stanford band will be
present and Palm Drive will be deco
rated. Immediately following the re
ception, the candidate will go to his
home on the campus for a few hours'
rest before his final speech of the
campaign from his study over a
nation-wide hook-up of radio stations.
Plans for the reception will be han
dled by the Hoover Rally Committee
appointed last night with Dave Jacob
son as chairman. The members are:
Leon Levi, Doug Lewis, Phil Brooks,
Merle Emry, John Shortridge, Max
Krakauer, Bob Syer, Gregg Davis,
Alexis Elirman, George Ellsworth,
Charles Fox, Hilliard Giffen, Major
Godsol, Don Hamblin, Serge Klotz,

Valentine, Fred Hubler, Vard Loomis,
Link Malmquist, Roy Mitchell, A1
Biaggini, Stanley Mullin, Ferdinand

The Rally Committee will have an

Room 214 of the English Building for
the purpose of discussing plans for
the reception.
