# DIRECTOR TO USE EXPRESSIONISTIC SCENES IN PLAY
## Abstract Quality Necessary To Portray Action in Mind of Goldina 
### 
Abstract expressionism has been
used by Harold Helvenston, art direc- j
tor of the Stanford stage, in the three i
scenes representing Goldina's mind in j
the fantasy "The Devil in the Cheese"
which will be given in the Assembly
Hall on November 9.
There are three sets in the second
act where the entire action takes
place in the mind of the heroine
Coldina. Helvenston has tried to rep
resent the atmosphere and not the
intrinsic reality of these scenes. The ;
images in the mind are vague and !
indistinct, and Helvenston has picked
out a dominant characteristic to por
tray.
"The yacht is to be nothing but a
yacht, and it is to be picked out of
the darkness," said the art director
yesterday. "Full, complete, realistic |
sets are impossible in 'The Devil in j
the Cheese.' The scenes of the yacht j
Goldina dreams of, the desert island, \
and the 1928 drawing-room are at- j
tempts to represent the artificiality |
of the scenery, and the nebulous char
acter of it."
This play is the first fantasy that
has been given since Gordon Davis' j
return from Europe, and the four sets, !
different as they are from each other,
are quite a departure in their abstract
simplicity from the regular realistic
scenery found in the theater.
