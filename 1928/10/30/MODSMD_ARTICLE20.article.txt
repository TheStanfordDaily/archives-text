# WARNED, JONES WILL USE BEST MEN SATURDAY
## Wilton to See First Action Since Oregon Game; One Card Regular on Injured List 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
With Stanford and Southern Cali
fornia both resuming strictly secret
! practice for their engagement next
Saturday, indications now are that
both teams will line up with nearly
full strength for the first time since
the season really got under way.
Repeated injuries have harassed
Pop Warner and Howard Jones since
practice started this year, the Cards
and Trojans each having played
games minus the services of some of
their regulars. Practically every mem
ber of the red-shirted team has been
I handicapped with injuries, Preston,
I Harder, Wilton, and Artman being
I the most unfortunate, Jones' men have
j had similar troubles. Even Captain
, Jesse Hibbs has had his turn on the
| bench.
Because the Card-Trojan clash will
Jbe an important game—possibly the
deciding game of the remaining Con
ference season—the rival coaches
: have seen to it that no further injuries
i resulted to their first teams Saturday.
| Heinecke was the only regular to
i play against Fresno for Stanford,
j Jones was forced to inject only a few
of his regulars into the game to de
feSt the Occidental Tigers.
Johnny Preston will be the only
: Cardinal not available for competi
i tion in the game against Troy. Frank
Wilton, speedy left halfback who was
injured in the Oregon game, will get
into action for the first time since his
leg was injured three weeks ago. This
j is the first time that Wilton has been
on the bench with injuries since he
started playing football at Stanford.
The liard-luck bogie has followed
; Spud Harder for two seasons, but he
' has had an opportunity to recuperate
from his most recent injury and will
be back at his place at the right end
of the Stanford line.
Because of their respective records
in games this season the Cardinals
are slight favorites to win from the
! Trojans. But when one considers that
i U.S.C. hasn't had a real opportunity
to show its full strength, it appears
! as though the two teams will be
| evenly matched. Southern California
started its schedule with the Utah
Aggies and Oregon State and then
met a crippled St. Mary's squad. Their
first real test appeared in the Cali
| lornia game; the Trojans were held
scoreless, hut they were playing with
a couple of regulars absent from the
lineup. The condition of the Berkeley
field also slowed their offense con
siderably. Saturday's contest will be
| played on a fast turf and the famous
U.S.C. running attack, featuring Don
Williams, should be at its best.

from his most recent injury and will

of the Stanford line.
Because of their respective records
in games this season the Cardinals
are slight favorites to win from the
! Trojans. But when one considers that
i U.S.C. hasn't had a real opportunity
to show its full strength, it appears
! as though the two teams will be
| evenly matched. Southern California
started its schedule with the Utah
Aggies and Oregon State and then
met a crippled St. Mary's squad. Their
first real test appeared in the Cali
| lornia game; the Trojans were held
scoreless, hut they were playing with
a couple of regulars absent from the
lineup. The condition of the Berkeley
field also slowed their offense con
siderably. Saturday's contest will be
| played on a fast turf and the famous
U.S.C. running attack, featuring Don
Williams, should be at its best.
With Stanford and Southern Cali
fornia both resuming strictly secret
! practice for their engagement next
Saturday, indications now are that
both teams will line up with nearly
full strength for the first time since
the season really got under way.
Repeated injuries have harassed
Pop Warner and Howard Jones since
practice started this year, the Cards
and Trojans each having played
games minus the services of some of
their regulars. Practically every mem
ber of the red-shirted team has been
I handicapped with injuries, Preston,
I Harder, Wilton, and Artman being
I the most unfortunate, Jones' men have
j had similar troubles. Even Captain
, Jesse Hibbs has had his turn on the
| bench.
Because the Card-Trojan clash will
Jbe an important game—possibly the
deciding game of the remaining Con
ference season—the rival coaches
: have seen to it that no further injuries
i resulted to their first teams Saturday.

Johnny Preston will be the only

i tion in the game against Troy. Frank
Wilton, speedy left halfback who was
injured in the Oregon game, will get
into action for the first time since his
leg was injured three weeks ago. This
