# Let Hoover Receive a STANFORD Welcome
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover will arrive on the campus Monday in order to deliver
his final campaign speech; he will vote on Tuesday, and on Wednesday
there may be residing at the top of San Juan Hill the President-elect of
the nation.
For Democrat and Socialist as well as Republican that thought is
one to conjure with. A great deal of glamor surrounds a presidential
candidate; witness the spectacle of 50,000 people turning out on a hot
August afternoon to hear what they could as well have heard over the
radio. Now it seems as if every Stanford student ought to be able to
summon considerable non-partisan enthusiasm for Hoover as a Stanford
man, when he and Mrs. Hoover (Stanford, too) come back to their home
to await the crisis. A welcome rally is being arranged, by the Hoover
Club, to be sure, but we would urge that the welcoming be done by all
Stanford men and women, not by Republicans only, with Democrats, So
cialists, and those apathetic keeping silent.
The intense interest in politics manifest this month is to be inter
preted as the college generation's rebuttal to those who assert that it is
concerned with nothing more stable than football, dancing, and the auto
mobile.
And that the Smith and Thomas clubs, too, should have thrived so
well is something to look upon with satisfaction rather than with petty
intolerance arising from the fact that others have apostles in the place
where Hoover sprang up.
