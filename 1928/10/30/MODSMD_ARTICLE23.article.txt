						Word About That Bonfire
## 
### 
Now that the freshmen have commenced work on the Big Game bon
fire, something should be said as to the seriousness of their task. We take
our Big Game seriously at Stanford; all the ceremonies which lead up to
that explosion make up a sort of ritual for fall quarter which those who
have become rooted here insist upon seeing observed. To the incoming
class is relegated the work of piling the fagots for the climactic, and
most spectacular, display of the pre-game ceremonies; and while it may
seem to the freshmen, as they toil each afternoon lugging ties, barrels, and
other nondescript combustibles, that none but themselves cares whether
there is a bonfire or not, we assure them that the campus watches the
progress of that timber pile with the most jealous interest. If the frosh
doubt this, let them loaf on the job and hear the or let them
allow the bonfire prematurely to be set off.
Yet, O Yearlings, watch your studies! Every year the pathetic case
arises of one or two fellows who take so absorbing an interest in the pyre
that they think it transcends Citizenship (e.g.) in importance. It doesn't.
