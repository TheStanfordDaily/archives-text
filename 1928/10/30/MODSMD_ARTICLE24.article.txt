# An Education Fable

There was once a Valedictorian who announced at his Senior Class Dinner that
he was going to be a Bond Salesman, and in the Amazed Silence that followed
spoke thus:
"I am aware that in this decision I am running counter to all American College
Tradition. I am aware that this rank of Valedictorian carries with it Prospects for
the Future that amount almost to Obligations. In the opinion of you and your
predecessors who are now Alumni, my career is cut out for me. I should enter
cither the ministry or the teaching profession. I should begin life in rural obscurity,
and should stay there. I should marry a woman who would do nothing to lift me
irom the rut into which I had fallen—and in twenty-five years' time I should be
unable, on account of my straitened finances, to send my eldest boy to my own
college. Some of you prosperous ones might offer to help me out, but I should be
too proud to accept assistance.
"Such is the tradition, but it is going to be belied in my case. I realize my
handicaps; I know that for four years I liave been on the wrong track. Instead of
Making Friends and Learning Life, I have been Content with the Companionship
of my Books and the esteem of my Professors; but it is not too Late to Reform.
Here, and now I pledge myself never to open a book again, except occasionally a
Best Seller, never to peruse any Magazine that is tainted with High Brow, and
never, except on the Sporting and Market Pages, to read beyond the Head-lines
of any Newspaper.
"I shall amass one fortune and marry another. The allowance of each of our
Children shall be more than the annual income of other Valedictorians. Grateful
and would-be-grateful colleges shall bestow countless M. A.'s upon me. Others
shall make me a Trustee. Always, from tonight, known as a good mixer, I shall
retain that Reputation even after my Exalted Financial Position would justify a
somewhat haughty exclusion, and if, in the Night Clubs of which I shall be a
discreet and Munificent Patron, my memory should play me false, and I should
blunder into a Latin Quotation, my Presence of Mind shall enable me to pass it off
as a new Bit of Slang.
Moral: But as wc all say on Occasion, it is the Exceptions that prove the rule.
—Edward C. Durfee, in Scribncr's.
Fifteen-hundred Princeton University students were so angered by the
refusal of the town of Princeton officials to allow them to register against
the coming election that they held a parade of indignance, trampled on
Smith and Hoover banners, and showed a thoroughly tigerish mien.
Stanford students need go on no such rampage. They will be excused
from classes on election day in order to go to their homes to vote. They
may not of course vote in Palo Alto, because the State law does not allow
registration in other than the city of home residence.
A vital meeting of the editorial stall will be held at 1 o'clock today.
