### 
THE GANG SPIRIT
Highest of racketeer virtues is loy
alty to the gang. From the time cer
tain little boys givo bloody noses to
those of their schoolmates who dared
to tell teacher until those same little
boys became vicious gangsters, mur
dering any who oppose them, the gang
spirit of loyalty dominates.
It is a far cry from the Chicago
Wfcstside to the Stanford campus. And
yet what irrational sense of loyalty
is it here that allows cheating, if it
is not that same attitude found in
the gangster? Stool-pigeons are most
hated of people by the law-abiding as
well as by the criminal. But it does
not take a stool-pigeon to stop an
honor system violation.
Any student, were he walking down
University avenue at night and were
he to see a thief entering a store,
would call the police. And there Is
nothing at stake in that student's life
save a sense of loyalty to society. Ah,
what sort of loyalty is this? Loyalty
to society when law and justice are

involved.
Let that same student be in a final
examination in which he must gain a
certain grade to pass the course. Let
his neighbor cheat. And nine chances
out of ten, he will do nothing, fearing
to go against his false sense of loy
alty to the group, and perhaps believ
ing he has commiseration for the
other fellow. Yet with the class aver
age raised by the cheater, the student
will possibly flunk the course. Here
he has not only opposed the true
sense of loyalty to the whole Univer
sity family in the cause of fairness
and justice, but he has cut his own
throat.
External punishments may be piled
up by the dozen. Severe and swift
means of treating the violator may be
devised. But the honor system will
not stand until every student makes it
a point of personal honor and per
sonal responsibility to uphold it. One
is not a stool-pigeon when one is pro
tecting one's own rights.

External punishments may be piled
up by the dozen. Severe and swift
means of treating the violator may be
devised. But the honor system will
not stand until every student makes it
a point of personal honor and per

is not a stool-pigeon when one is pro
tecting one's own rights.
—Calvin D. Wood.
