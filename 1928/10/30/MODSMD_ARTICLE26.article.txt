The Editor, Sir:
It was with great pleasure that I
noted your editorial of Wednesday,
October 24, reminding the freshman
class that we can't get something for
nothing. Meals at Encina Commons
now will not stand any decrease in
the quality or the quantity, so if we
are to have meals seven days a week
there is only one alternative —raise
the price. We now eat eighteen meals
in the Commons in the course of a
week, and we are asking for twenty
one, all for the same price. On the
face of it this is absurd.
Now I dislike fasting one day a
week just as much as anyone else. In
fact, I simply don't do it. Accordingly
I greatly favor meals all seven days
at the Commons. It seems to me —
and I think most people will agree
with me —that it is easier to fast a
little every day than a whole lot one
day. Therefore I would suggest that
we eat two meals every day. This
makes a total of fourteen. The cost of
the remaining four could well be
used in improving the quality of the
fourteen.
This is meant for a constructive
criticism of a boarding house which
leaves us to starve one-seventh of the
time. Dinner and lunch every day
will keep us alive and well. Indeed
I almost never eat any breakfast.
There are a good many others around
Encina who don't too, and for those
who must have their gruel there is
the lunch counter in the basement.
That this plan has its defects I
know. I merely advance it, feeling
that it is better than one day a week
starvation, and much better than
seven-day poisoning.
For fewer but better meals,

The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's edition of the "Dip
py" I saw that there was a huge meet
ing of the bolslieviki members of the
eating clubs. These strong-headed
radicals demanded a show down or
else they would walk out. Charges of
extortion and inefficient management
were thrown all around the room
breaking up the furniture and incur
ring more bills. Well I attended that
meeting and I found that there were
some definite questions asked con
cerning the increase in price of board
furnished by the Encina Eating Clubs,
The facts were brought out that the
men were charged twenty cents more
a day for food. There are about five
hundred men in all and this amounts
to about "one hundred dollars a day or
$2600 a month. On top of this, meals
are served on only six days of the
week which would amount to $2400
a week to take up the loss of the
previous prices. When these are to
taled for the month it appears that
there is about ?5000 a month in and
above the board prices of last year.
When the quarter first started a
group of men representing the clubs
met with Mr. Erwin and asked him
to explain the reasons for this rather
large increase. He stated that the
price for food had gone up in pro
portion. He also stated that better
food would be served as soon as the
kitchen could be organized to run at J
top speed. With the objective of bet
ter food ahead the clubs were satisfied
and sat back waiting for it to appear.
Weeks passed and it did not come,
hence the uprising. The food did not
improve; it is worse if that is pos
sible. Less food is given and meat
rations have been cut down.
At the last of the meeting, men
were appointed from the clubs to
look into the prices of food on the
local market, and also to look into
the prices paid at other universities
where the board bills are a dollar a
day for seven days a week.
The idea of a walkout was knocked
in the head in a minute as the men
lealized that Russian folk-ways would
not help the situation. The meeting
was orderly and inquisitive. What

they tried to do was to boil down to
plain English the vast amount of
figures that Mr. Erwin hurls at a com
mittee from his big book of "Cost
Accounting."
It appears that the men like their
clubs and want to co-operate with the
powers that be and bring down the
high cost of fodder.

The Editor, Sir:
"Never the Proctor System!" What
do you think we have now? The mere
enforcement of the Honor System is
the burial of the Honor System and
"substitutes" a Proctor System.
Possibly in your hurry to write an
editorial, you did not mean to mis
represent me. It was not stated that
"it is the instructor's sole interest to
eliminate cheating." It was pointed
out that the University authorities
received the only advantage from
what we call the Honor System be
cause it relieves them from the trou
ble of furnishing an elaborate police
system.
I can see no reason why a student
is so interested in whether the other
fellow is going to cheat unless said
person be a blood relation. As long
as he is perfectly harmless, leave him
alone. He is only penalizing himself.
A person who has to cheat isn't going
to raise the class average enough to
amount to a hill of beans in spite of
his cheating.
"To adopt a Proctor System," you
say, "is to admit that the students
are unable to trust each other." Isn't
that already admitted by our adop
tion of the inefficient police system?
I am not eating crow when I speak
in favor of an Honor System that is
NOT ENFORCED, I am against what
we kid ourselves in believing is an
Honor System, but is simply a police
system. I suggested that if the au
thorities insisted that we enforce the
Honor System, it would be a better
plan for them to do their own duty
and give us an elaborate police sys
tem. This suggestion was made with
out shedding of tears because the
Honor System is not a course in
moral hygiene.

$2600 a month. On top of this, meals
are served on only six days of the
week which would amount to $2400
a week to take up the loss of the
previous prices. When these are to
taled for the month it appears that
there is about ?5000 a month in and
above the board prices of last year.
When the quarter first started a
group of men representing the clubs
met with Mr. Erwin and asked him
to explain the reasons for this rather
large increase. He stated that the
price for food had gone up in pro
portion. He also stated that better
food would be served as soon as the
kitchen could be organized to run at J
top speed. With the objective of bet
ter food ahead the clubs were satisfied
and sat back waiting for it to appear.
Weeks passed and it did not come,
hence the uprising. The food did not
improve; it is worse if that is pos
sible. Less food is given and meat
rations have been cut down.
At the last of the meeting, men
were appointed from the clubs to
look into the prices of food on the
local market, and also to look into
the prices paid at other universities
where the board bills are a dollar a
day for seven days a week.
The idea of a walkout was knocked
in the head in a minute as the men
lealized that Russian folk-ways would
not help the situation. The meeting
was orderly and inquisitive. What

they tried to do was to boil down to
plain English the vast amount of
figures that Mr. Erwin hurls at a com
mittee from his big book of "Cost
Accounting."
It appears that the men like their
clubs and want to co-operate with the
powers that be and bring down the
high cost of fodder.

The Editor, Sir:
"Never the Proctor System!" What
do you think we have now? The mere
enforcement of the Honor System is
the burial of the Honor System and
"substitutes" a Proctor System.
Possibly in your hurry to write an
editorial, you did not mean to mis
represent me. It was not stated that
"it is the instructor's sole interest to
eliminate cheating." It was pointed
out that the University authorities
received the only advantage from
what we call the Honor System be
cause it relieves them from the trou
ble of furnishing an elaborate police
system.
I can see no reason why a student
is so interested in whether the other
fellow is going to cheat unless said
person be a blood relation. As long
as he is perfectly harmless, leave him
alone. He is only penalizing himself.
A person who has to cheat isn't going
to raise the class average enough to
amount to a hill of beans in spite of
his cheating.
"To adopt a Proctor System," you
say, "is to admit that the students
are unable to trust each other." Isn't
that already admitted by our adop
tion of the inefficient police system?
I am not eating crow when I speak
in favor of an Honor System that is
NOT ENFORCED, I am against what
we kid ourselves in believing is an
Honor System, but is simply a police
system. I suggested that if the au
thorities insisted that we enforce the
Honor System, it would be a better
plan for them to do their own duty
and give us an elaborate police sys
tem. This suggestion was made with
out shedding of tears because the
Honor System is not a course in
moral hygiene.

The Editor, Sir:
It was with great pleasure that I
noted your editorial of Wednesday,
October 24, reminding the freshman
class that we can't get something for
nothing. Meals at Encina Commons
now will not stand any decrease in
the quality or the quantity, so if we
are to have meals seven days a week
there is only one alternative —raise
the price. We now eat eighteen meals
in the Commons in the course of a
week, and we are asking for twenty
one, all for the same price. On the
face of it this is absurd.
Now I dislike fasting one day a
week just as much as anyone else. In
fact, I simply don't do it. Accordingly
I greatly favor meals all seven days
at the Commons. It seems to me —
and I think most people will agree
with me —that it is easier to fast a
little every day than a whole lot one
day. Therefore I would suggest that
we eat two meals every day. This
makes a total of fourteen. The cost of
the remaining four could well be
used in improving the quality of the
fourteen.
This is meant for a constructive
criticism of a boarding house which
leaves us to starve one-seventh of the
time. Dinner and lunch every day
will keep us alive and well. Indeed
I almost never eat any breakfast.
There are a good many others around
Encina who don't too, and for those
who must have their gruel there is
the lunch counter in the basement.
That this plan has its defects I
know. I merely advance it, feeling
that it is better than one day a week
starvation, and much better than
seven-day poisoning.
For fewer but better meals,

In yesterday's edition of the "Dip

ing of the bolslieviki members of the
eating clubs. These strong-headed
radicals demanded a show down or
else they would walk out. Charges of
extortion and inefficient management
were thrown all around the room
breaking up the furniture and incur
ring more bills. Well I attended that
meeting and I found that there were
some definite questions asked con
cerning the increase in price of board
furnished by the Encina Eating Clubs,
The facts were brought out that the
men were charged twenty cents more
a day for food. There are about five
hundred men in all and this amounts
to about "one hundred dollars a day or
$2600 a month. On top of this, meals
are served on only six days of the
week which would amount to $2400

fellow is going to cheat unless said
person be a blood relation. As long
as he is perfectly harmless, leave him
alone. He is only penalizing himself.
A person who has to cheat isn't going
to raise the class average enough to
amount to a hill of beans in spite of
his cheating.
"To adopt a Proctor System," you
say, "is to admit that the students
are unable to trust each other." Isn't
that already admitted by our adop
tion of the inefficient police system?
I am not eating crow when I speak
in favor of an Honor System that is
NOT ENFORCED, I am against what
we kid ourselves in believing is an
Honor System, but is simply a police
system. I suggested that if the au
thorities insisted that we enforce the
Honor System, it would be a better
plan for them to do their own duty
and give us an elaborate police sys

out shedding of tears because the
Honor System is not a course in
moral hygiene.

The Editor, Sir:
It was with great pleasure that I
noted your editorial of Wednesday,
October 24, reminding the freshman
class that we can't get something for
nothing. Meals at Encina Commons
now will not stand any decrease in
the quality or the quantity, so if we
are to have meals seven days a week
there is only one alternative —raise
the price. We now eat eighteen meals
in the Commons in the course of a
week, and we are asking for twenty
one, all for the same price. On the
face of it this is absurd.
Now I dislike fasting one day a
week just as much as anyone else. In
fact, I simply don't do it. Accordingly
I greatly favor meals all seven days
at the Commons. It seems to me —
and I think most people will agree
with me —that it is easier to fast a
little every day than a whole lot one
day. Therefore I would suggest that
we eat two meals every day. This
makes a total of fourteen. The cost of
the remaining four could well be
used in improving the quality of the
fourteen.
This is meant for a constructive
criticism of a boarding house which
leaves us to starve one-seventh of the
time. Dinner and lunch every day
will keep us alive and well. Indeed
I almost never eat any breakfast.
There are a good many others around
Encina who don't too, and for those
who must have their gruel there is
the lunch counter in the basement.
That this plan has its defects I
know. I merely advance it, feeling
that it is better than one day a week
starvation, and much better than
seven-day poisoning.
For fewer but better meals,

The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's edition of the "Dip
py" I saw that there was a huge meet
ing of the bolslieviki members of the
eating clubs. These strong-headed
radicals demanded a show down or
else they would walk out. Charges of
extortion and inefficient management
were thrown all around the room
breaking up the furniture and incur
ring more bills. Well I attended that
meeting and I found that there were
some definite questions asked con
cerning the increase in price of board
furnished by the Encina Eating Clubs,
The facts were brought out that the
men were charged twenty cents more
a day for food. There are about five
hundred men in all and this amounts
to about "one hundred dollars a day or
$2600 a month. On top of this, meals
are served on only six days of the
week which would amount to $2400
a week to take up the loss of the
previous prices. When these are to
taled for the month it appears that
there is about ?5000 a month in and
above the board prices of last year.
When the quarter first started a
group of men representing the clubs
met with Mr. Erwin and asked him
to explain the reasons for this rather
large increase. He stated that the
price for food had gone up in pro
portion. He also stated that better
food would be served as soon as the
kitchen could be organized to run at J
top speed. With the objective of bet
ter food ahead the clubs were satisfied
and sat back waiting for it to appear.
Weeks passed and it did not come,
hence the uprising. The food did not
improve; it is worse if that is pos
sible. Less food is given and meat
rations have been cut down.
At the last of the meeting, men
were appointed from the clubs to
look into the prices of food on the
local market, and also to look into
the prices paid at other universities
where the board bills are a dollar a
day for seven days a week.
The idea of a walkout was knocked
in the head in a minute as the men
lealized that Russian folk-ways would
not help the situation. The meeting
was orderly and inquisitive. What

they tried to do was to boil down to
plain English the vast amount of
figures that Mr. Erwin hurls at a com
mittee from his big book of "Cost
Accounting."
It appears that the men like their
clubs and want to co-operate with the
powers that be and bring down the
high cost of fodder.
