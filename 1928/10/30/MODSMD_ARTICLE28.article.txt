bages and Things," the column should eb abol

scurrility as the first comment in today's col

The Scurrilous Comment was:
Several of the sets for "The Devil in
the Cheese" are said to represent the
interior of a modern girl's mind.
Will the actors wear rubber boots?
"Honi Soit qui Mai y Pense." We
don't know what this means, but a friend
informs us that it is—people who have
glass minds should wear a hat.
Anyhow, the critic need not be alarmed.
The editor has discharged Mr. Philip
Space, and in the future this column will
be conducted by Mr. Philip Space.

The better part of Today's Column,

Ist Student—Are you going to
study tonight, James?
2nd Fine Fellow—No, I am go

game of "pool" (i.e., swimming
pool).
Ist Fool—Who was that "lady" I seen

Scurrilous "Guy"—That sentence is un
