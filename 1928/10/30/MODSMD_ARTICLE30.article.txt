# NEW GERMAN GAS IS DESCRIBED BY ROBERT E. SWAIN
## Synthetic Product Is Made Of Cheap Coal; Solves World Problem 
### 
"Chemical research and engineer
ing skill have overcome another men
acing problem of modern civilization,"
declared Dr. Robert B. Swain, head
of the Stanford Chemistry Depart
ment, commenting upon Germany's
success in the practical use of syn
thetic gasoline. Dr. Swain returned
from Germany a few weeks ago.
That the value of such a process is
realized in this country is shown by
reliable reports that the Standard Oil
Company of New Jersey has pur
chased the American rights to this
new motor fuel, and is already con
templating the erection of a plant in
New Jersey.
Dr. Swain describes the synthetic
product as being made "from cheap
blown coal, a small amount of cata
lytic agent, added to speed up the
reaction, and hydrogen gas." The pro
cess which is carried on in retorts
at a high pressure and temperature,
results in a liquid product, and this
upon distillation yields a high-grade
motor fuel similar to gasoline in com
position and properties. Along with
this is found a lubricating oil frac
tion and a residue of heavy oil. The
heavy oil is sent back through the
process, and an attempt is made to
obtain more of the synthetic product
from it.
Germany's output of the psuedo
product from their one plant will ex
ceed 100,000 tons during the year
3 928. "The use of a better catalyst
already developed," according to Dr.
Swain," will increase the output of
this plant to 250,000 tons next year."
A gallon of this new motor fuel can
be produced for approximately 15
cents, and is therefore low enough in
price to compete with the gasoline
obtained from crude oil. The new
fuel is colorless, has approximately
the same specific gravity, and an odor
resembling that of gasoline.
