NEW YORK, Oct. 29. (/P)—Henri
Cochet and Miss Helen Wills head
the list of the "world's first ten" ten
nis players named by S. Wallis Myers,
British writer and critic of the game,
announced in the current issue of
"American Lawn Tennis." In each list
the United States has more repre
sentatives than any other nation.
Cochet succeeds his countryman,
Rene La Coste, who was first in 1927,
and Bill Tilden trails both of the
French stars, having dropped a notch.
The runner-up to Miss Wills again is
Senorita Lili de Alvarez of Spain.
The United States has held its own
in the men's "first ten" with four
representatives, the same individuals
who made it last year. France, on the
other hand, has three instead of four,
the veteran Jacques Brugnon having
failed to make the grade.
In the women's ranking the United
States with three representatives has
one less than last year, Mrs. Molla
Mallory and Mrs. A. H. Chapin hav
ing failed to repeat, while Helen
Jacobs is the American newcomer.
Mr. Myers' 1928 lists which are
accepted as authoritative here and
abroad follow:
Men —1. Henri Cochet, France; 2.
Rene La Coste, France; 3. William
T. Tilden, U.S.; 4. Frank Hunter, U.S.;
