# THREE CANDIDATE CLUBS WILL HOLD DEBATE THURSDAY
## 
### 
A three-cornered debate setting
forth the relative merits of Hoover,
Smith, and Thomas, will be held
Thursday evening in the Assembly
Hall as the result of challenges and
acceptances by the three presidential
clubs on the campus. The Smith-for-
President Club accepted the challenge
of the Stanford-for-Hoover Club, pro
posing a Hoover-Smith debate, and in
turn challenged the Thomas-for-Presi
dent Club to a similar contest. In
answer, the Thomas supporters
passed the following resolution:
"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED:
That the Thomas-for-President Club
accepts the challenge of the other
two clubs to a public debate on the
general subject, 'Smith vs. Hoover
vs. Thomas.'"
Representatives of the clubs, with
the help of Professor James Gordon
Emerson, varsity debate coach, h?ve
arranged the speeches so that only
one contest will be necessary. There
will be two main speechs of 12 and
10 minutes, respectively, and one re
buttal of 7 minutes for each team.
For the main speeches, the Smith sup
porters will speak first, the Hoover
men second, and the Thomas team
last, while they will be reversed in
rebuttal.
The teams will be as follows: Stan
ford-for-Hoover Club —Robert Hume
and John McClintock; Smitli-for-Presi
dent Club —George Shibley and George
Bodle; Thomas-for-President Club —
Stewart Way and Elizabeth Jackson.
