# "THE DYBBUK," MYSTIC MELODRAMA, IS PRESENTED AT TEMPLE THEATRE
## Play is Revelation of Intense Emotional Depth of Jewish Race; Leah, Possessed by Dybbuk, Excellent 
### CALVIN D. WOOD 
The Dybbuk, mystic melodrama from
the pen of S. Ansky, opened for its sec
ond presentation in this country in Eng
lish at the Temple Theater last night.
Nahum Zemach, founder of the Moscow
Habima Theater, has devoted the past
two months to the production of this
play. The inhabitants of the Chassidic
ghetto of pre-war days in Europe were
a people whose religious beliefs were a
vital, moving reality in their lives. The
Dybbuk has grasped the spirit of these
people and preserved it for those to come
whose beliefs will have been re-made by
the materialistic modernism of today. To
the gentile this play is a revelation of
the intense emotional depth of the Jewish
race.
Leah Unforgettable
The performance of Carolyn Anspa
cher as Leah, the one possessed by the
Dybbuk, disembodied spirit of her lover,
is unforgettable. Tall, dark, she holds
the audience with her rich voice. A most
difficult part is hers for she must por
tray a dual role; dual in the sense that
she is first Leah, loved by Channon, and
then after Channon's death, she is Leah,
possessed by the spirit of Channon, which
speaks through her to the world.
Strength and frailty, welded into one,
of such is the character of Rabbi Azrael,
played by Irving Pichel. The aged pa
triarch is burdened with the trials and

the work of years; thus is he frail. But .
when moved by the conviction of his
faith he contests the Dybbuk, commands
it to leave Leah, and finally anathametizes
it, he becomes a tower of strength. An
other difficult role is this and another
rare interpretation is that given by Mr.
Pichel.
Sets Very Effective
Striking sets increase the effectiveness
of the play. Light and shadow arc made
most of in the first setting, that of the
Brainitz synagogue. In this Harold P.!
Helvenston, director of settings and cos
tuming, has by cleverly placing his lights
caused weird shadows of the actors to
fall upon the back wall of the set. The
impression is excellent. In the second
set, the outstanding effect is that pro
duced by the beggars. They are attired
in weird rags and their make-up is ex
treme. The dance they perform before
the house of the rich man is grotesque.
Color creates the effectiveness of the final
setting. Everything is in white, except
ing the costume of Rabbi Azrael, the
actors arc dressed in black. As the act
progresses colored light is thrown on the ;
scene, changing its appearance when the
colors change.
Chanting, singing, and instrumental
music from the wings run through the
play heightening its emotional appeal.
Melodramatic though it is, it is not de
void of humor, a whimsical sort of i
humor.

possessed by the spirit of Channon, which
speaks through her to the world.
Strength and frailty, welded into one,
of such is the character of Rabbi Azrael,
played by Irving Pichel. The aged pa
triarch is burdened with the trials and

the work of years; thus is he frail. But .
when moved by the conviction of his
faith he contests the Dybbuk, commands
it to leave Leah, and finally anathametizes
it, he becomes a tower of strength. An
other difficult role is this and another
rare interpretation is that given by Mr.
Pichel.
Sets Very Effective
Striking sets increase the effectiveness
of the play. Light and shadow arc made
most of in the first setting, that of the
Brainitz synagogue. In this Harold P.!
Helvenston, director of settings and cos
tuming, has by cleverly placing his lights
caused weird shadows of the actors to
fall upon the back wall of the set. The
impression is excellent. In the second
set, the outstanding effect is that pro
duced by the beggars. They are attired
in weird rags and their make-up is ex
treme. The dance they perform before
the house of the rich man is grotesque.
Color creates the effectiveness of the final
setting. Everything is in white, except
ing the costume of Rabbi Azrael, the
actors arc dressed in black. As the act
progresses colored light is thrown on the ;
scene, changing its appearance when the
colors change.
Chanting, singing, and instrumental
music from the wings run through the
play heightening its emotional appeal.
Melodramatic though it is, it is not de
void of humor, a whimsical sort of i
humor.
The Dybbuk, mystic melodrama from
the pen of S. Ansky, opened for its sec
ond presentation in this country in Eng
lish at the Temple Theater last night.
Nahum Zemach, founder of the Moscow
Habima Theater, has devoted the past
two months to the production of this
play. The inhabitants of the Chassidic
ghetto of pre-war days in Europe were
a people whose religious beliefs were a
vital, moving reality in their lives. The
Dybbuk has grasped the spirit of these
people and preserved it for those to come
whose beliefs will have been re-made by
the materialistic modernism of today. To
the gentile this play is a revelation of
the intense emotional depth of the Jewish
race.
Leah Unforgettable
The performance of Carolyn Anspa
cher as Leah, the one possessed by the
Dybbuk, disembodied spirit of her lover,
is unforgettable. Tall, dark, she holds
the audience with her rich voice. A most
difficult part is hers for she must por
tray a dual role; dual in the sense that
she is first Leah, loved by Channon, and
then after Channon's death, she is Leah,
possessed by the spirit of Channon, which
speaks through her to the world.
