# COLLEGIANS WILL DEBATE POLITICS IN SAN FRANCISCO
## Republicans of Stanford and California to Oppose Smith Supporters 
### 
Changes in the plans for the Stan- j
lord-California debate call for the
clash to take place in San Francisco
tomorrow night at 8 o'clock instead
of in Berkeley Thursday night. Infor
mation as to the exact location of the
debate could not be secured last
night.
Four men are to represent Stan
ford in the contest instead of two as ;
was originally planned. Wadieh Shib- j
ley and Virgil Whitaker are to join
forces with two California Democrats
to uphold the candidacy of A1 Smith, ]
while Leon Carley and Charles Prael
will combine with Berkeley Repub- !
licans to press the case for the G.O.P. j
candidate.
This meeting is the first between
the two traditional rivals since the
opening of the year and although
there will be no intercollegiate com- !
petition, Stanford and California j
speakers will attempt to outshine j
each other in the display of oratorical !
and forensic ability. The decision will
be rendered by the people of San
Francisco in the election on Novem- j
ber 6.
Cardinal debaters will also appear
on the platforms of U.S.C., St. Igna
tius, and the College of the Pacific on
the evening of November 5.
Robert McClintock and Irving Ro
senblatt will attend the U.S.C. game j
on November 3 and remain in Los
Angeles for the debate the following I
Monday. W. L. Shaw and Arthur An- j
gel are scheduled to speak at St.
Ignatius on the same date.
A triangular Hoover-Smith-Thomas I
debate will take place at the College
of the Pacific at Stockton, according
to the latest arrangements. Pardee
Lowe will represent the Democratic |
party, Paul Herbold, the Republicans,
and some member of the Stanford
Thomas Club will speak for the So
cialist candidate.
