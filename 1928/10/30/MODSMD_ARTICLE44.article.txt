# AL SMITH LEAGUE ORGANIZED IN 300 COLLEGES â€“ POLK
## 
### 
Students representing more than
300 American colleges and universi
ties have enrolled in the College
League for Alfred E. Smith, declares
Frank L. Polk, former Secretary of
State under the Wilson administra
tion and who is now head of the
League. Miss Gertrude Ely, a trustee
of Bryn Mawr, who is in charge of
women's activities for the League,
reports that enrollment has been
heavy among college women.
In many cases student members of
the league are assisting county com
mittees as speakers and workers. One
of the most prominent has been
Dwight Morrow, Jr., son of the* am
bassador to Mexico, who is active in
the Smith Club at Amherst and in
helping Democratic committees in
Massachusetts.
The league maintains a speakers'
bureau, Mr. Polk points out, that is
ready to supply college meetings with
speakers of national prominence.
Smith clubs at all the large universi
ties are planning rallies preceding
Election Day.
