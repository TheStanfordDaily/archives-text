# CAMPUS MAP IS MADE BY TOPOGRAPHY CLASS
## 
### 
A map of the southeast portion of
the campus is being made by each
member of Lieutenant Charles S.
Whitmore's topography class in the
military department. Information for
the map must be secured by each
individual in the manner in which
rough field maps are made by the
Army.
Distances must be paced off and
all buildings must be represented, as
well as trees and other landmarks.
The portion being mapped lies be
tween the men's dormitories, May
field, and the highway.
