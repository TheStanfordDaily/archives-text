# D'HERELLE TO RELATE INDIA RESEARCHES
## Bacteriophagist to Lecture On Study of Cholera Epidemic Control 
### 
Dr. F. d'Herelle, discoverer of bac
! teriophagy and one of the world's
foremost scientists, will lecture on
"My Mission to India for the Study
of Cholera" at 7:30 o'clock tonight in
I the Assembly Hall.
The lecture, planned for a lay audi
| ence, and illustrated with lantern
j slides, will be based on Dr. d'Herelle's
recent studies in India with particular
reference to the control of the cholera
epidemic by means of the bacterio
phage, a phenomenon in which bac
teria are destroyed under the influ
ence of an agent, which Dr. d'Herelle
regards as a living ultravisible
parasite of bacteria. The scientist
made his first observations on the
phenomenon about ten years ago
when in charge of the Vaccine Depart
ment of the Pasteur Institute during
the World War. Since that time the
subject has been a favorite topic of
investigation by bacteriologists of
j Europe and America, as well as of
; considerable practical importance in
the control of epidemic diseases.
Dr. d'Herelle has just completed a
| series of lectures at the Stanford
! Medical School. He will leave Stan
! ford Wednesday for Los Angeles,
| where he will deliver several lectures,
j From there he will return to Yale,
giving talks en route at Seattle, Port
land, Minneapolis, Cleveland, and New
I York City. The speaker recently ac
j cepted the Professorship of Bacteriol
i ogy at Yale University.
