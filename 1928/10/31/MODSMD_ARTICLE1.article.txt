## Declares He Disagrees With Both Candidates; Favors Government Development 
### 
NORFOLK, Va., Oct. 30.
cussing the power question for the
first time in a campaign speech, Sena
tor William E. Borah of Idaho tonight
outlined his own position on govern
ment control of the nation's power
resources and assailed the stand of
Governor Smith on the issue.
Declaring that he did not agree with
either Herbert Hoover or the Demo
cratic presidential nominee in their
views on the power question, the Sen
ator said that "Governor Smith's
proposition of government ownership
and private distribution of electrical
energy does not cover the power
problem." The Democratic candidate's
views, he added, would not provide
for any more government control of
power than exists under the present
Federal Water Power Act.
Mr. Borah declared his own posi
tion was "that it must be either com
plete government ownership, control,
operation, and distribution, or it must
be private ownership with complete
regulation and control upon the part
of the state or government." He added
that in the campaign he had not been
interested in the power issue "as a
partisan" because he was not in agree
ment with the views of either candi
date.
Emphasizing that he was opposed
to "government in business," the
Idahoan declared that power sites are j
"natural monopolies and belong to the
public.
"They should be dedicated to the
use of the public," he said, adding
that in addition to electrical energy (
power development is generally in
timately connected with flood control,
navigation, irrigation, and reclama
tion. "These power sites, therefore,
should not be used," he declared, "as [
the basis for great and speculative !
profits."
