# EUPHRONIA TEAM UPHOLDING SMITH IS GIVEN DECISION
## 
### 
Allan Beach and Hilarion Talavera,
upholding the candidacy of A1 Smith
in Euphronia's intra-society debate
last night, were given an audience
decision over Bruce Wright and
Myron Tower, Republicans, in the
lobby of the Old Union.
On the contention that the Repub
licans should be maintained in power
for the next four years because of
their past record and their future pos
sibilities, Wright and Tower main
tained that the party had success
fully met one of the greatest prob
lems in the history of the country
when they brought the nation through
the readjustment of post-war years.
They demanded that the Democrats
produce a workable plan for the en
forcement of prohibition and for the
relief of the farmer if they are to
criticize the Republican administra
tion for the past seven and a half
years.
On the basis of Smith's conservative
record in New York State and his
proposed reforms in the federal gov
ernmental machinery, Talavera and
Beach claimed that he was entitled
to the presidency. They pointed to
the shameful scandals in which the
Republican administration officials
have been involved and maintained
that the prosperity of the country has
been due to the condition of Europe
since the war rather than to any con
structive legislation the party has en
acted.
The next meeting of Euphronia is
scheduled for Wednesday evening,
November 7.
