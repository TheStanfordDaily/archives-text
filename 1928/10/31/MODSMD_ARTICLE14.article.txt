# CARDINALS, BEARS JOIN FOR DEBATE ON HOOVER-SMITH
## Republicans of Two Schools Will Combine Against Bourbon Backers 
### 
Traditional collage rivalry will give
way before the call of political affilia
tion when Stanford and California Re
publicans pool their strength to over
come a combination of Cardinal and
Golden Bear Democrats in a debate
at the Scottish Rite Auditorium at
Sutter and Van Ness Avenue, San
Francisco, at 8:15 o'clock tonight.
The question will be "Hoover vs.
Smith."
Frank H. Probert, Dean of the Uni
versity of California School of Min
ing, has been announced as the pre
siding officer at the debate.
Leon Carley and Charles Prael will
represent the Republican party from
Stanford and will cover the topics of
agriculture and Hoover's political
philosophy respectively. Carley par
ticipated in the Utah debate here in
1927 as well as those with the College
of the Pacific and Cal-Tech last year.
Prael has had an international de
hating experience. While attending
Victoria College, University of New
Zealand, at Wellington, he took part
in a debate on "Is America Headed
for Heaven or Hell."
Speakers for the Stanford Demo
crats will be George Shibley and Vir
gil Whitaker. Shibley's debating ex
perience has been limited to the
freshman debate with California last
year. Nevertheless he rated as an able
speaker. Whitaker will speak in re
buttal for the entire Democratic team.
He took part in the U.S.C. debate last
year and showed to advantage in the
Philippines debate last spring.
Combining their efforts with the
Stanford Hoover men will be John
Reynolds and Leon Rovetta of Cali
fornia. Supporting the Stanford Demo
crats, Stanley Breyer of California
will open the debate tonight. Robert
Dennis will make the third speech of
the evening for Smith.
