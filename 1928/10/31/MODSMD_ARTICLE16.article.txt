Special applications for seats for !
the Big Game Gaieties will be given
to any student purchasing four tickets i
for "The Devil in the Cheese." These j
applications entitle students to pre- 1
ferred seats for the Football Show.
Cushing's comedy utilizes the first
exterior set that has been used on the
campus since Gordon Davis' return
from Europe. The first and third acts
of the play are laid in the Monastery I
of Meteora, which is high on a deso
late mountain top in Greece.
Unlike the sophisticated high com- 1
edy set for "The Queen's Husband,"
Harold Helvenston has created a
realistic set which represents the ex
treme height and loneliness of the
monastery. This set is the first at- j
tempt of Davis and Helvenston to use
a plastic setting.
The lighting of the play is divided j
into two sections: first, there is the
realistic lighting in the first and third j
acts; and second, the attempt to j
represent the artificiality of the !
scenes in the second act. Simplicity
is the keynote in those sets showing
the thoughts of Goldina, and the most j
experimental thing in the whole play ;
is the last scene in the psychological I
trip through Quigley's daughter's
mind, where she pictures Jimmy
Chard in 1938. Helvenston believes
that the scene should represent only I
modernity. The drawing room in
1938 will be picked out of the dark- j
ness by light. "Chard," the name of
the boy Goldina loves, is the entabla
ture on a cornice. The action of the 1
scene shows a patriotic ballyhoo.
