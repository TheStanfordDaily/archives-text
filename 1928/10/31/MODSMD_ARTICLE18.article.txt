# WARNER SYSTEM TO MEET JONES' POWER IN CLASH
## Cardinal, Trojan Squads to Feature Deceptive Tactics In Saturday's Grid Classic 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
j. "Ready, Hoffman?" "Ready, Hibbs?"
Eighty thousand fans eagerly await
that signal which will start the clash
between the Cards and Trojans, War
ner and Jones, for the fourth time.
The game will be a big one bacuse
its outcome may decide the Confer
ence champion, because it will feature
at least two All-American candidates,
and because, among other things, it
' will again demonstrate what happens
when two highly offensive teams meet.
Warner and Jones both profess that
j "a good offense is the best defense."
Coaches Stress Power
| Jones and Warner each stress
power as a part of their respective
famous systems of football, Vut em
ploy different methods of generating
j this power under deception. In gen
-1 eral, the deception of the Warner sys
tem is based on the work of the
backfleld which uses a bagfull of re
verses, criss-crosses, and fake re
verses designed to camouflage the
i man with the ball. The deception of
the Jones system is based on tricky
I line shifts as a means of covering up
the ball-carrier and disguising the
method of attack in the line.
Saturday's game will be largely a
clash representing a great offense
against another great offense, and
backfield deception versus line de-
I ception.
Meet For Fourth Time
Three times have the two teams
met as products of Warner and Jones,
I the first two games going to Stanford
and the third game, that of last year,
resulting in a 13-13 tie. Stanford's re
lations with Southern Calilornia in
, competition at the present game of
| American football extend back to the
time of the War. Until the appearance
of Pop Warner as Cardinal mentor,
j the Trojans had things their own way.
Under the Warner regime, things
have been reversed â€”in more ways
than one.
