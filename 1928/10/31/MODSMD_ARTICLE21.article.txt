# Vote Intelligently in the Straw Poll
## 
### 
Doubts have been freely expressed as to whether the presiden
tial poll being conducted today by the Daily in conjunction with
other members of the Pacific Intercollegiate Press will be a true
indication of the attitude of Stanford Students.
We cannot sympathize with these doubts, because it is hard to
believe that the students could be so apathetic or childish in their
opinion of the worth of the poll as to vote for anyone but the man
of their honest choice. The day when we would nominate Thomas
A. Edison for the presidency of the senior class of Insertnameof
highschool has passed for substantially all of us.
If everyone who votes today casts an honest and not a facetious
ballot, the results of the poll will be worth thinking about. Unless
the vote is undertaken seriously, it will amount to nothing.
