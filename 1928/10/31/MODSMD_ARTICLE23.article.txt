# Pleasant Comment From Washington

### 
The following editorial from the University of Washington Daily
warms the cockles of the heart. Incidentally, we might attempt to live
up to this image of "oursels' as ithers see us."
"Coldness has no place on the Stanford campus during a foot
ball week-end.
" 'Hello' becomes the most-used word in the dictionary, and is
broadcast, with a smile thrown in free, to everyone, especially
strangers.
"And judging from subsequent comment in the editorial columns
of Stanford's rivals, it is a custom that wins for Stanford many
friends. As one of them says: 'Playing Stanford is like playing a
rival who you are sure is enjoying your competition as much as you
are hers. You're treated like a welcome visitor, and feel like one.'
"Rather an improvement over the old-time custom of cat-calling
and verbal mud-slinging."
