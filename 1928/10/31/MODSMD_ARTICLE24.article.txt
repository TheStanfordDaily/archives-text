The Editor, Sir:
In the face of today's campus straw vote, yesterday's interview with John L.
McNab, as printed in the Daily, should not in fairness stand unanswered. In the
article Mr. McNab is referred to as "a jurist of national repute." That statement
should first be corrected. Mr. McNab is not a jurist—even of home-town note.
Any jury of his alleged fellow jurists would quickly settle that point. Mr. McNab
is simply a very adroit, very shrewd, criminal lawyer and politician. Such is his
reputation. It is in the light of his true character, then, that I wish to deal with
the subject matter of yesterday's interview.
His statements on the issue of the campaign were exactly typical of the kind of
manipulations a great criminal lawyer must indulge in—intellectual and factual
manipulations. Let us see. First, as to Boulder Dam, the Swing-Johnson Bill, and
water power: Mr. McNab declares that Gov. Smith is"for the scrapping of the
whole project and the setting up of a commission of seven states to handle and
finance Boulder Dam." That that statement is false can be proved by a few
citations from Gov. Smith's Denver speech, where lie dealt exhaustively with the
•whole question of power, including Boulder Dam. He first laid down the basic
principle by which he promised to be guided in dealing with every angle of the
power question: that where power resources are owned by the Federal government
they should remain under the Federal government; where they arc owned by one
state, or by several states jointly, they should be under the control of these states,
severally or jointly, as the case may be. Then he said: "By control I mean absolute
retention of the power itself, by owning and controlling the site and the plant at
the place of generation." Turning to Boulder Dam in particular, his stand is
equally clear: First, if, under the investigation now being carried on by Federal
engineers, and in the light of the attitude of the several states involved, Congress
should determine that the best course is for the Federal Government to build the
project, Governor Smith promises to rush the project to completion under the exist
ing plan, (the Swing-Johnson plan in general). Therefore is it not clear that Mr.
McNab made a plain misstatement when he said that Governor Smith favored
"scrapping" the whole project- The second point Gov. Smith made, at Denver, in
reference to Boulder Dam, was that if the present project failed of enactment lie
would immediately re-submit all the available data to Congress, and drive this
project through to immediate action. Now it is true that Gov. Smith has, foremost
among his plans, in case the present one fails, a proposal for a seven-state power
authority, under which the interests of the seven states and of the public would be
protected by his principle of public ownership. This plan would not require Federal
expenditures. The project would be self-financing through the issue of bonds.
Federal aid, so far as necessary, would be given. Herbert Hoover's only pro

nouncement on Boulder Dam is that he favors a "high dam." At. New York he
declared himself irrevocably against public ownership. And the real heart of the
whole Boulder Dam controversy, as Senator Hiram Johnson is now proclaiming to |
the people of California, is the question of public ownership and control versus
private ownership, or private control of a publicly owned project.
On the prohibition issue Mr. McNab substitutes ridicule for reason. His re- j
marks on this subject need no discussion. But then he launches into the farm prob- i
lem, with the concluding indictment that all Smith promises to do to get action is a '
promise that "he will appoint a committee to study the question." But everyone
who has followed this campaign, and especially the farmer, knows that Gov. Smith's
proposal for farm relief is very definite: He acepts the principle of the McNary-
Haugen Bill, that the only way the farm problem can be solved is through the con
trol of the crop surplus, and that the cost of such control, and the sale of the
surplus abroad, shall be charged against the crops benefited by the plan. This plan,
in effect, is merely to extend the benefits of the protective tariff to the farmer.
Smith promises further, that a committee of experts will be put to work on the
details of the machinery for this plan, ready to report to Congress on March 4. Mr.
Hoover, on the other hand, has definitely rejected the principle of the McNary-
Haugcn Bill, offers by way of remedy the tariff, which unaided does not work for
the benefit of the farmer; the development of waterways, which will take from 15
to 20 years, and co-operative marketing and private organization are incapable of
providing any sure or immediate relief to the farmer. How about that, Mr. McNab?
One final shot: Mr. McNab lauded the hoped for Hooverian foreign policy,
yet Mr. Hoover has so far departed from his Quaker traditions as to declare that
the basis of peace is that "We must not only be just; we must be respected." He
has swallowed, completely, the doctrines of the big navy jingoists and of the advo
cates of dollar diplomacy in South America. Such is the "delicate" way this Quaker
deals with "delicate" foreign relations!
We'll leave it to the jury, Mr. McNab! Those policies are "indefensible."

Editor, Sir:
1. An honor system which has to be enforced is a contradiction in terms.
a. Honor is a trait of character. It cannot be enforced.
b. People who do the right thing for fear of the consequences if they do the
wrong thing are not honorable (in the true sense of the word).
2. An honor system" which is enforced differs in no substantial particular from the
system of having proctors at examinations.
a. Instead of being watched by officials, the students watch each other.
b. In either case there is present the element of compulsion
(1) Those who wish to cheat will be restrained from so doing (presuma
bly) by the fear of expulsion. Are they being honorable?
(2) The penalty is the same under the so-called honor system as under
the proctoring system. Where does the opportunity for being honor
able come in?
(3) Those who are truly honorable will be so under either system.
c. Consequently it is a misnomer to call the present system an honor system.
3. What a true honor system should be: ,
a. Each man should be left to his own work and should be entirely free from
supervision of any kind.
b. Each man should be so trusted that he should have opportunity to cheat
whenever he cared to, but, being honorable, he would not do so.
4. Impracticability of a true honor system:
a. It depends wholly on the calibre of the students.
b. For that reason it will work only under exceptional circumstances.
e.g., where the student body is a small, well-knit whole, the members
knowing each other intimately.
c. It will not work at Stanford.
(1) Altho the general class of men and women is high, there are enough
of the lower type to make such a system a failure.
(2) The same would be true of any university .of equal size. The law of
averages creeps in—some of the lower type student will always be
present.
5. What is to be done:
a. Stop calling the present system an honor system. It's misleading.
b. Probably better to change back to the proctor system.
(1) More efficient.
(2) Saves students the embarrassment of having to denounce their fellows.

Editor of the Dippy,
Honoured Sir: ....
As a lover of truth and accuracy, particularly in the public prints, I must rise
in anger to utter a few feeble words of protest against a gross misstatement of
fact in the editorial columns of Thursday's Dippy, even though it make it necessary
for me to tear myself from my "almost incessant toil.
As you probably realize, sir, my wrath was aroused by your somewhat sneering
references to "a dryball with an average of 153 plus 306. Straight A with two
quarters to go."
First to correct a minor error, if the learned editor had looked longer he would
have noticed that the student in question came here with ten units and consequently
has only one quarter to go. 1 his, however, was excusable and merely in keeping
with the traditions of the paper.
Let us turn to the more important part of the question. 1 o prevent misunder
standing, let us start with a definition of terms, using the Frosh Bible as our best
and perhaps only authority. There, the term above referred to is defined as fol
lows: "Strictly local expression for the amoeba who came here to study and did.
'On the Boat' means nothing to him. Constantly in the library, but doesn't know
that there's anything under the tables, etc."
With this definition in mind, I am sure that even you, sir, will realize that the
term is wholly inaccurate in its recent application. That the youth referred to has
this high and perhaps unprecedented average is true; but there, sir, the truth of your
editorial stops. So far from not being "on the boat" or from being unknown, he
has shown sufficient interest in the vessel to win a circle S in a minor sport. (Inci
dentally, can the learned editor show as much?) On the second count, "constantly
in the library, etc.," the youth in question, on the contrary, goes there very seldom,
and from the name which he uses to designate the place (furnished by request) I
feel sure that so far from not knowing that there's anything under the tables, he
is acutely conscious that there is. He may frequently be seen loitering about the
campus with some of the select few whom he favors with his company and at
times may even be seen engaged in that most useless and wasteful of all occupa*
tions —talking with me in my office (The Encrusted Jerkin, alias The Union Store)
"in those few moments when I can tear myself from my almost incessant toil."
Fnally, he can almost invariably be seen in the Cellar having his tea and toast
about four p.m. daily (except Sunday).
In short, sir, I frankly, and, I feel, reasonably, resent this absolutely unfounded
charge made against one whose only sin is in his having a larger supply than usual
of the material of which brains are made; who is cherished by his friends as a
gentleman, a scholar, and facile princeps of good fellows. I humbly suggest that if
our campus editors would remain awake a little more, motor cars, yell leaders, and
reputations would be much more safe in our modest community.
I remain, sir,
None too cordially yours,
FREDERICK MALCOLM COMBELLACK.
The Editor, Sir:
Please allow me a little space in answer to the article by Mr. Masao Suma in
the columns of your Daily of Oct. 18th, which strikes me very much. I wish I had
2 copy of the alleged attack on Mr. Tsurumi by Mr. H. W. Giang. As it is I have
only the article by Mr. Suma, which was an attempt to defend the Japanese speaker
and the imperialistic policy of the Japanese government.
It surprises me to learn that Mr. Suma, my former classmate, and an able and
diligent scholar should let his conscience and his sense of justice be overcome by
his ardor to defend the wrongdoings of his country. It is not my desire to take
issue with Mr. Suma. Yet at the same time I cannot overlook his deliberate at
tempt to present distorted facts about the truth of the relations between Giina and
Japan. Whether or not Japan deliberately interfered with China's domesic affairs,
thus causing the clashes in Shantung; whether or not Japan has ever been fair and
just, I leave it to the fair-minded public to decide. It is of coursc natural that Mr.
Suma, being a Japanese national, should deliberately attempt as all Japanese do,
to present to the people as benevolent a picture of Japanese imperialism as could be
painted. The world has seen too much of Japan's deeds to have faith in her any
morel Not the Chinese at least!
In conclusion, I would like to have one more word. Mr. Suma called Mr. H. W.
Chang a coward. 1 believe it was Mr. Chang's gentlemanly way not to embarrass
Mr. Tsurumi with such questions which he well knew the speaker would evade or
could never answer. It was a case of saving the Japanese speaker's face.
I thank you for the valuable space.
Yours sincerely,
QUON S. LEONG.

With this definition in mind, I am sure that even you, sir, will realize that the
term is wholly inaccurate in its recent application. That the youth referred to has
this high and perhaps unprecedented average is true; but there, sir, the truth of your
editorial stops. So far from not being "on the boat" or from being unknown, he
has shown sufficient interest in the vessel to win a circle S in a minor sport. (Inci
dentally, can the learned editor show as much?) On the second count, "constantly

and from the name which he uses to designate the place (furnished by request) I
feel sure that so far from not knowing that there's anything under the tables, he
is acutely conscious that there is. He may frequently be seen loitering about the
campus with some of the select few whom he favors with his company and at
times may even be seen engaged in that most useless and wasteful of all occupa*
tions —talking with me in my office (The Encrusted Jerkin, alias The Union Store)
"in those few moments when I can tear myself from my almost incessant toil."
Fnally, he can almost invariably be seen in the Cellar having his tea and toast
about four p.m. daily (except Sunday).
In short, sir, I frankly, and, I feel, reasonably, resent this absolutely unfounded
charge made against one whose only sin is in his having a larger supply than usual
of the material of which brains are made; who is cherished by his friends as a
gentleman, a scholar, and facile princeps of good fellows. I humbly suggest that if
our campus editors would remain awake a little more, motor cars, yell leaders, and

The Editor, Sir:
Please allow me a little space in answer to the article by Mr. Masao Suma in
the columns of your Daily of Oct. 18th, which strikes me very much. I wish I had
2 copy of the alleged attack on Mr. Tsurumi by Mr. H. W. Giang. As it is I have
only the article by Mr. Suma, which was an attempt to defend the Japanese speaker
and the imperialistic policy of the Japanese government.
It surprises me to learn that Mr. Suma, my former classmate, and an able and
diligent scholar should let his conscience and his sense of justice be overcome by
his ardor to defend the wrongdoings of his country. It is not my desire to take
issue with Mr. Suma. Yet at the same time I cannot overlook his deliberate at
tempt to present distorted facts about the truth of the relations between Giina and
Japan. Whether or not Japan deliberately interfered with China's domesic affairs,
thus causing the clashes in Shantung; whether or not Japan has ever been fair and
just, I leave it to the fair-minded public to decide. It is of coursc natural that Mr.
Suma, being a Japanese national, should deliberately attempt as all Japanese do,
to present to the people as benevolent a picture of Japanese imperialism as could be
painted. The world has seen too much of Japan's deeds to have faith in her any
morel Not the Chinese at least!
In conclusion, I would like to have one more word. Mr. Suma called Mr. H. W.
Chang a coward. 1 believe it was Mr. Chang's gentlemanly way not to embarrass
Mr. Tsurumi with such questions which he well knew the speaker would evade or
could never answer. It was a case of saving the Japanese speaker's face.
I thank you for the valuable space.
Yours sincerely,

The Editor, Sir:
In the face of today's campus straw vote, yesterday's interview with John L.
McNab, as printed in the Daily, should not in fairness stand unanswered. In the
article Mr. McNab is referred to as "a jurist of national repute." That statement
should first be corrected. Mr. McNab is not a jurist—even of home-town note.
Any jury of his alleged fellow jurists would quickly settle that point. Mr. McNab
is simply a very adroit, very shrewd, criminal lawyer and politician. Such is his
reputation. It is in the light of his true character, then, that I wish to deal with
the subject matter of yesterday's interview.
His statements on the issue of the campaign were exactly typical of the kind of
manipulations a great criminal lawyer must indulge in—intellectual and factual
manipulations. Let us see. First, as to Boulder Dam, the Swing-Johnson Bill, and
water power: Mr. McNab declares that Gov. Smith is"for the scrapping of the
whole project and the setting up of a commission of seven states to handle and
finance Boulder Dam." That that statement is false can be proved by a few
citations from Gov. Smith's Denver speech, where lie dealt exhaustively with the
•whole question of power, including Boulder Dam. He first laid down the basic
principle by which he promised to be guided in dealing with every angle of the
power question: that where power resources are owned by the Federal government
they should remain under the Federal government; where they arc owned by one
state, or by several states jointly, they should be under the control of these states,
severally or jointly, as the case may be. Then he said: "By control I mean absolute
retention of the power itself, by owning and controlling the site and the plant at
the place of generation." Turning to Boulder Dam in particular, his stand is
equally clear: First, if, under the investigation now being carried on by Federal
engineers, and in the light of the attitude of the several states involved, Congress
should determine that the best course is for the Federal Government to build the
project, Governor Smith promises to rush the project to completion under the exist
ing plan, (the Swing-Johnson plan in general). Therefore is it not clear that Mr.
McNab made a plain misstatement when he said that Governor Smith favored
"scrapping" the whole project- The second point Gov. Smith made, at Denver, in
reference to Boulder Dam, was that if the present project failed of enactment lie
would immediately re-submit all the available data to Congress, and drive this
project through to immediate action. Now it is true that Gov. Smith has, foremost
among his plans, in case the present one fails, a proposal for a seven-state power
authority, under which the interests of the seven states and of the public would be
protected by his principle of public ownership. This plan would not require Federal
expenditures. The project would be self-financing through the issue of bonds.
Federal aid, so far as necessary, would be given. Herbert Hoover's only pro

nouncement on Boulder Dam is that he favors a "high dam." At. New York he
declared himself irrevocably against public ownership. And the real heart of the
whole Boulder Dam controversy, as Senator Hiram Johnson is now proclaiming to |
the people of California, is the question of public ownership and control versus
private ownership, or private control of a publicly owned project.
On the prohibition issue Mr. McNab substitutes ridicule for reason. His re- j
marks on this subject need no discussion. But then he launches into the farm prob- i
lem, with the concluding indictment that all Smith promises to do to get action is a '
promise that "he will appoint a committee to study the question." But everyone
who has followed this campaign, and especially the farmer, knows that Gov. Smith's
proposal for farm relief is very definite: He acepts the principle of the McNary-
Haugen Bill, that the only way the farm problem can be solved is through the con
trol of the crop surplus, and that the cost of such control, and the sale of the
surplus abroad, shall be charged against the crops benefited by the plan. This plan,
in effect, is merely to extend the benefits of the protective tariff to the farmer.
Smith promises further, that a committee of experts will be put to work on the
details of the machinery for this plan, ready to report to Congress on March 4. Mr.
Hoover, on the other hand, has definitely rejected the principle of the McNary-
Haugcn Bill, offers by way of remedy the tariff, which unaided does not work for
the benefit of the farmer; the development of waterways, which will take from 15
to 20 years, and co-operative marketing and private organization are incapable of
providing any sure or immediate relief to the farmer. How about that, Mr. McNab?
One final shot: Mr. McNab lauded the hoped for Hooverian foreign policy,
yet Mr. Hoover has so far departed from his Quaker traditions as to declare that
the basis of peace is that "We must not only be just; we must be respected." He
has swallowed, completely, the doctrines of the big navy jingoists and of the advo
cates of dollar diplomacy in South America. Such is the "delicate" way this Quaker
deals with "delicate" foreign relations!
We'll leave it to the jury, Mr. McNab! Those policies are "indefensible."

Editor, Sir:
1. An honor system which has to be enforced is a contradiction in terms.
a. Honor is a trait of character. It cannot be enforced.
b. People who do the right thing for fear of the consequences if they do the
wrong thing are not honorable (in the true sense of the word).
2. An honor system" which is enforced differs in no substantial particular from the
system of having proctors at examinations.
a. Instead of being watched by officials, the students watch each other.
b. In either case there is present the element of compulsion
(1) Those who wish to cheat will be restrained from so doing (presuma
bly) by the fear of expulsion. Are they being honorable?
(2) The penalty is the same under the so-called honor system as under
the proctoring system. Where does the opportunity for being honor
able come in?
(3) Those who are truly honorable will be so under either system.
c. Consequently it is a misnomer to call the present system an honor system.
3. What a true honor system should be: ,
a. Each man should be left to his own work and should be entirely free from
supervision of any kind.
b. Each man should be so trusted that he should have opportunity to cheat
whenever he cared to, but, being honorable, he would not do so.
4. Impracticability of a true honor system:
a. It depends wholly on the calibre of the students.
b. For that reason it will work only under exceptional circumstances.
e.g., where the student body is a small, well-knit whole, the members
knowing each other intimately.
c. It will not work at Stanford.
(1) Altho the general class of men and women is high, there are enough
of the lower type to make such a system a failure.
(2) The same would be true of any university .of equal size. The law of
averages creeps in—some of the lower type student will always be
present.
5. What is to be done:
a. Stop calling the present system an honor system. It's misleading.
b. Probably better to change back to the proctor system.
(1) More efficient.
(2) Saves students the embarrassment of having to denounce their fellows.

Editor of the Dippy,
Honoured Sir: ....
As a lover of truth and accuracy, particularly in the public prints, I must rise
in anger to utter a few feeble words of protest against a gross misstatement of
fact in the editorial columns of Thursday's Dippy, even though it make it necessary
for me to tear myself from my "almost incessant toil.
As you probably realize, sir, my wrath was aroused by your somewhat sneering
references to "a dryball with an average of 153 plus 306. Straight A with two
quarters to go."
First to correct a minor error, if the learned editor had looked longer he would
have noticed that the student in question came here with ten units and consequently
has only one quarter to go. 1 his, however, was excusable and merely in keeping
with the traditions of the paper.
Let us turn to the more important part of the question. 1 o prevent misunder
standing, let us start with a definition of terms, using the Frosh Bible as our best
and perhaps only authority. There, the term above referred to is defined as fol
lows: "Strictly local expression for the amoeba who came here to study and did.
'On the Boat' means nothing to him. Constantly in the library, but doesn't know
that there's anything under the tables, etc."
With this definition in mind, I am sure that even you, sir, will realize that the
term is wholly inaccurate in its recent application. That the youth referred to has
this high and perhaps unprecedented average is true; but there, sir, the truth of your
editorial stops. So far from not being "on the boat" or from being unknown, he
has shown sufficient interest in the vessel to win a circle S in a minor sport. (Inci

4. Impracticability of a true honor system:

Editor of the Dippy,
Honoured Sir: ....
As a lover of truth and accuracy, particularly in the public prints, I must rise
in anger to utter a few feeble words of protest against a gross misstatement of
fact in the editorial columns of Thursday's Dippy, even though it make it necessary
for me to tear myself from my "almost incessant toil.
As you probably realize, sir, my wrath was aroused by your somewhat sneering
references to "a dryball with an average of 153 plus 306. Straight A with two
quarters to go."
First to correct a minor error, if the learned editor had looked longer he would
have noticed that the student in question came here with ten units and consequently
has only one quarter to go. 1 his, however, was excusable and merely in keeping
with the traditions of the paper.
Let us turn to the more important part of the question. 1 o prevent misunder
standing, let us start with a definition of terms, using the Frosh Bible as our best
and perhaps only authority. There, the term above referred to is defined as fol
lows: "Strictly local expression for the amoeba who came here to study and did.
'On the Boat' means nothing to him. Constantly in the library, but doesn't know
that there's anything under the tables, etc."
With this definition in mind, I am sure that even you, sir, will realize that the
term is wholly inaccurate in its recent application. That the youth referred to has
this high and perhaps unprecedented average is true; but there, sir, the truth of your
editorial stops. So far from not being "on the boat" or from being unknown, he
has shown sufficient interest in the vessel to win a circle S in a minor sport. (Inci
dentally, can the learned editor show as much?) On the second count, "constantly
in the library, etc.," the youth in question, on the contrary, goes there very seldom,
and from the name which he uses to designate the place (furnished by request) I
feel sure that so far from not knowing that there's anything under the tables, he
is acutely conscious that there is. He may frequently be seen loitering about the
campus with some of the select few whom he favors with his company and at
times may even be seen engaged in that most useless and wasteful of all occupa*
tions —talking with me in my office (The Encrusted Jerkin, alias The Union Store)
"in those few moments when I can tear myself from my almost incessant toil."
Fnally, he can almost invariably be seen in the Cellar having his tea and toast
about four p.m. daily (except Sunday).
In short, sir, I frankly, and, I feel, reasonably, resent this absolutely unfounded
charge made against one whose only sin is in his having a larger supply than usual
of the material of which brains are made; who is cherished by his friends as a
gentleman, a scholar, and facile princeps of good fellows. I humbly suggest that if
our campus editors would remain awake a little more, motor cars, yell leaders, and
reputations would be much more safe in our modest community.
I remain, sir,
None too cordially yours,
FREDERICK MALCOLM COMBELLACK.
The Editor, Sir:
Please allow me a little space in answer to the article by Mr. Masao Suma in
the columns of your Daily of Oct. 18th, which strikes me very much. I wish I had
2 copy of the alleged attack on Mr. Tsurumi by Mr. H. W. Giang. As it is I have
only the article by Mr. Suma, which was an attempt to defend the Japanese speaker
and the imperialistic policy of the Japanese government.
It surprises me to learn that Mr. Suma, my former classmate, and an able and
diligent scholar should let his conscience and his sense of justice be overcome by
his ardor to defend the wrongdoings of his country. It is not my desire to take
issue with Mr. Suma. Yet at the same time I cannot overlook his deliberate at
tempt to present distorted facts about the truth of the relations between Giina and
Japan. Whether or not Japan deliberately interfered with China's domesic affairs,
thus causing the clashes in Shantung; whether or not Japan has ever been fair and
just, I leave it to the fair-minded public to decide. It is of coursc natural that Mr.
Suma, being a Japanese national, should deliberately attempt as all Japanese do,
to present to the people as benevolent a picture of Japanese imperialism as could be
painted. The world has seen too much of Japan's deeds to have faith in her any
morel Not the Chinese at least!
In conclusion, I would like to have one more word. Mr. Suma called Mr. H. W.
Chang a coward. 1 believe it was Mr. Chang's gentlemanly way not to embarrass
Mr. Tsurumi with such questions which he well knew the speaker would evade or
could never answer. It was a case of saving the Japanese speaker's face.
I thank you for the valuable space.
Yours sincerely,
QUON S. LEONG.
The Editor, Sir:
In the face of today's campus straw vote, yesterday's interview with John L.
McNab, as printed in the Daily, should not in fairness stand unanswered. In the
article Mr. McNab is referred to as "a jurist of national repute." That statement
should first be corrected. Mr. McNab is not a jurist—even of home-town note.
Any jury of his alleged fellow jurists would quickly settle that point. Mr. McNab
is simply a very adroit, very shrewd, criminal lawyer and politician. Such is his
reputation. It is in the light of his true character, then, that I wish to deal with
the subject matter of yesterday's interview.
His statements on the issue of the campaign were exactly typical of the kind of
manipulations a great criminal lawyer must indulge in—intellectual and factual
manipulations. Let us see. First, as to Boulder Dam, the Swing-Johnson Bill, and
water power: Mr. McNab declares that Gov. Smith is"for the scrapping of the
whole project and the setting up of a commission of seven states to handle and
finance Boulder Dam." That that statement is false can be proved by a few
citations from Gov. Smith's Denver speech, where lie dealt exhaustively with the
•whole question of power, including Boulder Dam. He first laid down the basic
principle by which he promised to be guided in dealing with every angle of the
power question: that where power resources are owned by the Federal government
they should remain under the Federal government; where they arc owned by one
state, or by several states jointly, they should be under the control of these states,
severally or jointly, as the case may be. Then he said: "By control I mean absolute
retention of the power itself, by owning and controlling the site and the plant at
the place of generation." Turning to Boulder Dam in particular, his stand is
equally clear: First, if, under the investigation now being carried on by Federal
engineers, and in the light of the attitude of the several states involved, Congress
should determine that the best course is for the Federal Government to build the
project, Governor Smith promises to rush the project to completion under the exist
ing plan, (the Swing-Johnson plan in general). Therefore is it not clear that Mr.
McNab made a plain misstatement when he said that Governor Smith favored
"scrapping" the whole project- The second point Gov. Smith made, at Denver, in
reference to Boulder Dam, was that if the present project failed of enactment lie
would immediately re-submit all the available data to Congress, and drive this
project through to immediate action. Now it is true that Gov. Smith has, foremost
among his plans, in case the present one fails, a proposal for a seven-state power
authority, under which the interests of the seven states and of the public would be
protected by his principle of public ownership. This plan would not require Federal
expenditures. The project would be self-financing through the issue of bonds.
Federal aid, so far as necessary, would be given. Herbert Hoover's only pro

nouncement on Boulder Dam is that he favors a "high dam." At. New York he
declared himself irrevocably against public ownership. And the real heart of the
whole Boulder Dam controversy, as Senator Hiram Johnson is now proclaiming to |
the people of California, is the question of public ownership and control versus
private ownership, or private control of a publicly owned project.
On the prohibition issue Mr. McNab substitutes ridicule for reason. His re- j
marks on this subject need no discussion. But then he launches into the farm prob- i
lem, with the concluding indictment that all Smith promises to do to get action is a '
promise that "he will appoint a committee to study the question." But everyone
who has followed this campaign, and especially the farmer, knows that Gov. Smith's
proposal for farm relief is very definite: He acepts the principle of the McNary-
Haugen Bill, that the only way the farm problem can be solved is through the con
trol of the crop surplus, and that the cost of such control, and the sale of the
surplus abroad, shall be charged against the crops benefited by the plan. This plan,
in effect, is merely to extend the benefits of the protective tariff to the farmer.
Smith promises further, that a committee of experts will be put to work on the
details of the machinery for this plan, ready to report to Congress on March 4. Mr.
Hoover, on the other hand, has definitely rejected the principle of the McNary-
Haugcn Bill, offers by way of remedy the tariff, which unaided does not work for
the benefit of the farmer; the development of waterways, which will take from 15
to 20 years, and co-operative marketing and private organization are incapable of
providing any sure or immediate relief to the farmer. How about that, Mr. McNab?
One final shot: Mr. McNab lauded the hoped for Hooverian foreign policy,
yet Mr. Hoover has so far departed from his Quaker traditions as to declare that
the basis of peace is that "We must not only be just; we must be respected." He
has swallowed, completely, the doctrines of the big navy jingoists and of the advo
cates of dollar diplomacy in South America. Such is the "delicate" way this Quaker
deals with "delicate" foreign relations!

principle by which he promised to be guided in dealing with every angle of the
power question: that where power resources are owned by the Federal government
they should remain under the Federal government; where they arc owned by one
state, or by several states jointly, they should be under the control of these states,
severally or jointly, as the case may be. Then he said: "By control I mean absolute
retention of the power itself, by owning and controlling the site and the plant at
the place of generation." Turning to Boulder Dam in particular, his stand is
equally clear: First, if, under the investigation now being carried on by Federal
engineers, and in the light of the attitude of the several states involved, Congress
should determine that the best course is for the Federal Government to build the
project, Governor Smith promises to rush the project to completion under the exist
ing plan, (the Swing-Johnson plan in general). Therefore is it not clear that Mr.
McNab made a plain misstatement when he said that Governor Smith favored
"scrapping" the whole project- The second point Gov. Smith made, at Denver, in
reference to Boulder Dam, was that if the present project failed of enactment lie
would immediately re-submit all the available data to Congress, and drive this
project through to immediate action. Now it is true that Gov. Smith has, foremost
among his plans, in case the present one fails, a proposal for a seven-state power
authority, under which the interests of the seven states and of the public would be
protected by his principle of public ownership. This plan would not require Federal
expenditures. The project would be self-financing through the issue of bonds.
Federal aid, so far as necessary, would be given. Herbert Hoover's only pro

nouncement on Boulder Dam is that he favors a "high dam." At. New York he
declared himself irrevocably against public ownership. And the real heart of the
whole Boulder Dam controversy, as Senator Hiram Johnson is now proclaiming to |
the people of California, is the question of public ownership and control versus
private ownership, or private control of a publicly owned project.
On the prohibition issue Mr. McNab substitutes ridicule for reason. His re- j
marks on this subject need no discussion. But then he launches into the farm prob- i
lem, with the concluding indictment that all Smith promises to do to get action is a '
promise that "he will appoint a committee to study the question." But everyone
who has followed this campaign, and especially the farmer, knows that Gov. Smith's
proposal for farm relief is very definite: He acepts the principle of the McNary-
Haugen Bill, that the only way the farm problem can be solved is through the con
trol of the crop surplus, and that the cost of such control, and the sale of the
surplus abroad, shall be charged against the crops benefited by the plan. This plan,
in effect, is merely to extend the benefits of the protective tariff to the farmer.
Smith promises further, that a committee of experts will be put to work on the
details of the machinery for this plan, ready to report to Congress on March 4. Mr.
Hoover, on the other hand, has definitely rejected the principle of the McNary-
Haugcn Bill, offers by way of remedy the tariff, which unaided does not work for
the benefit of the farmer; the development of waterways, which will take from 15
to 20 years, and co-operative marketing and private organization are incapable of
providing any sure or immediate relief to the farmer. How about that, Mr. McNab?
One final shot: Mr. McNab lauded the hoped for Hooverian foreign policy,
yet Mr. Hoover has so far departed from his Quaker traditions as to declare that
the basis of peace is that "We must not only be just; we must be respected." He
has swallowed, completely, the doctrines of the big navy jingoists and of the advo
cates of dollar diplomacy in South America. Such is the "delicate" way this Quaker
deals with "delicate" foreign relations!
We'll leave it to the jury, Mr. McNab! Those policies are "indefensible."

a. Honor is a trait of character. It cannot be enforced.
b. People who do the right thing for fear of the consequences if they do the
wrong thing are not honorable (in the true sense of the word).
2. An honor system" which is enforced differs in no substantial particular from the

a. Instead of being watched by officials, the students watch each other.
b. In either case there is present the element of compulsion
(1) Those who wish to cheat will be restrained from so doing (presuma

(2) The penalty is the same under the so-called honor system as under

able come in?
(3) Those who are truly honorable will be so under either system.
c. Consequently it is a misnomer to call the present system an honor system.
3. What a true honor system should be: ,
a. Each man should be left to his own work and should be entirely free from

b. Each man should be so trusted that he should have opportunity to cheat
whenever he cared to, but, being honorable, he would not do so.
4. Impracticability of a true honor system:
a. It depends wholly on the calibre of the students.
b. For that reason it will work only under exceptional circumstances.
e.g., where the student body is a small, well-knit whole, the members

c. It will not work at Stanford.
(1) Altho the general class of men and women is high, there are enough

Editor of the Dippy,
Honoured Sir: ....
As a lover of truth and accuracy, particularly in the public prints, I must rise
in anger to utter a few feeble words of protest against a gross misstatement of
fact in the editorial columns of Thursday's Dippy, even though it make it necessary
for me to tear myself from my "almost incessant toil.
As you probably realize, sir, my wrath was aroused by your somewhat sneering
references to "a dryball with an average of 153 plus 306. Straight A with two
quarters to go."
First to correct a minor error, if the learned editor had looked longer he would
have noticed that the student in question came here with ten units and consequently
has only one quarter to go. 1 his, however, was excusable and merely in keeping
with the traditions of the paper.
Let us turn to the more important part of the question. 1 o prevent misunder
standing, let us start with a definition of terms, using the Frosh Bible as our best
and perhaps only authority. There, the term above referred to is defined as fol
lows: "Strictly local expression for the amoeba who came here to study and did.
'On the Boat' means nothing to him. Constantly in the library, but doesn't know
that there's anything under the tables, etc."
With this definition in mind, I am sure that even you, sir, will realize that the
term is wholly inaccurate in its recent application. That the youth referred to has
this high and perhaps unprecedented average is true; but there, sir, the truth of your
editorial stops. So far from not being "on the boat" or from being unknown, he
has shown sufficient interest in the vessel to win a circle S in a minor sport. (Inci
dentally, can the learned editor show as much?) On the second count, "constantly
in the library, etc.," the youth in question, on the contrary, goes there very seldom,
and from the name which he uses to designate the place (furnished by request) I
feel sure that so far from not knowing that there's anything under the tables, he
is acutely conscious that there is. He may frequently be seen loitering about the
campus with some of the select few whom he favors with his company and at
times may even be seen engaged in that most useless and wasteful of all occupa*
tions —talking with me in my office (The Encrusted Jerkin, alias The Union Store)
"in those few moments when I can tear myself from my almost incessant toil."
Fnally, he can almost invariably be seen in the Cellar having his tea and toast
about four p.m. daily (except Sunday).
In short, sir, I frankly, and, I feel, reasonably, resent this absolutely unfounded
charge made against one whose only sin is in his having a larger supply than usual
of the material of which brains are made; who is cherished by his friends as a
gentleman, a scholar, and facile princeps of good fellows. I humbly suggest that if
our campus editors would remain awake a little more, motor cars, yell leaders, and
reputations would be much more safe in our modest community.
I remain, sir,
None too cordially yours,
FREDERICK MALCOLM COMBELLACK.
The Editor, Sir:
Please allow me a little space in answer to the article by Mr. Masao Suma in
the columns of your Daily of Oct. 18th, which strikes me very much. I wish I had
2 copy of the alleged attack on Mr. Tsurumi by Mr. H. W. Giang. As it is I have
only the article by Mr. Suma, which was an attempt to defend the Japanese speaker
and the imperialistic policy of the Japanese government.
It surprises me to learn that Mr. Suma, my former classmate, and an able and
diligent scholar should let his conscience and his sense of justice be overcome by
his ardor to defend the wrongdoings of his country. It is not my desire to take
issue with Mr. Suma. Yet at the same time I cannot overlook his deliberate at
tempt to present distorted facts about the truth of the relations between Giina and
Japan. Whether or not Japan deliberately interfered with China's domesic affairs,
thus causing the clashes in Shantung; whether or not Japan has ever been fair and
just, I leave it to the fair-minded public to decide. It is of coursc natural that Mr.
Suma, being a Japanese national, should deliberately attempt as all Japanese do,
to present to the people as benevolent a picture of Japanese imperialism as could be
painted. The world has seen too much of Japan's deeds to have faith in her any
morel Not the Chinese at least!
In conclusion, I would like to have one more word. Mr. Suma called Mr. H. W.
Chang a coward. 1 believe it was Mr. Chang's gentlemanly way not to embarrass
Mr. Tsurumi with such questions which he well knew the speaker would evade or
could never answer. It was a case of saving the Japanese speaker's face.
I thank you for the valuable space.
Yours sincerely,
QUON S. LEONG.
The Editor, Sir:
In the face of today's campus straw vote, yesterday's interview with John L.
McNab, as printed in the Daily, should not in fairness stand unanswered. In the
article Mr. McNab is referred to as "a jurist of national repute." That statement
should first be corrected. Mr. McNab is not a jurist—even of home-town note.
Any jury of his alleged fellow jurists would quickly settle that point. Mr. McNab
is simply a very adroit, very shrewd, criminal lawyer and politician. Such is his
reputation. It is in the light of his true character, then, that I wish to deal with
the subject matter of yesterday's interview.
His statements on the issue of the campaign were exactly typical of the kind of
manipulations a great criminal lawyer must indulge in—intellectual and factual
manipulations. Let us see. First, as to Boulder Dam, the Swing-Johnson Bill, and
water power: Mr. McNab declares that Gov. Smith is"for the scrapping of the
whole project and the setting up of a commission of seven states to handle and
finance Boulder Dam." That that statement is false can be proved by a few
citations from Gov. Smith's Denver speech, where lie dealt exhaustively with the
•whole question of power, including Boulder Dam. He first laid down the basic

The Editor, Sir:
Please allow me a little space in answer to the article by Mr. Masao Suma in
the columns of your Daily of Oct. 18th, which strikes me very much. I wish I had
2 copy of the alleged attack on Mr. Tsurumi by Mr. H. W. Giang. As it is I have
only the article by Mr. Suma, which was an attempt to defend the Japanese speaker
and the imperialistic policy of the Japanese government.
It surprises me to learn that Mr. Suma, my former classmate, and an able and
diligent scholar should let his conscience and his sense of justice be overcome by
his ardor to defend the wrongdoings of his country. It is not my desire to take
issue with Mr. Suma. Yet at the same time I cannot overlook his deliberate at
tempt to present distorted facts about the truth of the relations between Giina and
Japan. Whether or not Japan deliberately interfered with China's domesic affairs,
thus causing the clashes in Shantung; whether or not Japan has ever been fair and
just, I leave it to the fair-minded public to decide. It is of coursc natural that Mr.
Suma, being a Japanese national, should deliberately attempt as all Japanese do,
to present to the people as benevolent a picture of Japanese imperialism as could be
painted. The world has seen too much of Japan's deeds to have faith in her any
morel Not the Chinese at least!
In conclusion, I would like to have one more word. Mr. Suma called Mr. H. W.
Chang a coward. 1 believe it was Mr. Chang's gentlemanly way not to embarrass
Mr. Tsurumi with such questions which he well knew the speaker would evade or
could never answer. It was a case of saving the Japanese speaker's face.
I thank you for the valuable space.
Yours sincerely,

The Editor, Sir:
In the face of today's campus straw vote, yesterday's interview with John L.
McNab, as printed in the Daily, should not in fairness stand unanswered. In the
article Mr. McNab is referred to as "a jurist of national repute." That statement
should first be corrected. Mr. McNab is not a jurist—even of home-town note.
Any jury of his alleged fellow jurists would quickly settle that point. Mr. McNab
is simply a very adroit, very shrewd, criminal lawyer and politician. Such is his
reputation. It is in the light of his true character, then, that I wish to deal with
the subject matter of yesterday's interview.
His statements on the issue of the campaign were exactly typical of the kind of
manipulations a great criminal lawyer must indulge in—intellectual and factual
manipulations. Let us see. First, as to Boulder Dam, the Swing-Johnson Bill, and
water power: Mr. McNab declares that Gov. Smith is"for the scrapping of the
whole project and the setting up of a commission of seven states to handle and
finance Boulder Dam." That that statement is false can be proved by a few
citations from Gov. Smith's Denver speech, where lie dealt exhaustively with the
•whole question of power, including Boulder Dam. He first laid down the basic
principle by which he promised to be guided in dealing with every angle of the
power question: that where power resources are owned by the Federal government
they should remain under the Federal government; where they arc owned by one
state, or by several states jointly, they should be under the control of these states,
severally or jointly, as the case may be. Then he said: "By control I mean absolute
retention of the power itself, by owning and controlling the site and the plant at
the place of generation." Turning to Boulder Dam in particular, his stand is
equally clear: First, if, under the investigation now being carried on by Federal
engineers, and in the light of the attitude of the several states involved, Congress
should determine that the best course is for the Federal Government to build the
project, Governor Smith promises to rush the project to completion under the exist
ing plan, (the Swing-Johnson plan in general). Therefore is it not clear that Mr.
McNab made a plain misstatement when he said that Governor Smith favored
"scrapping" the whole project- The second point Gov. Smith made, at Denver, in
reference to Boulder Dam, was that if the present project failed of enactment lie
would immediately re-submit all the available data to Congress, and drive this
project through to immediate action. Now it is true that Gov. Smith has, foremost
among his plans, in case the present one fails, a proposal for a seven-state power
authority, under which the interests of the seven states and of the public would be
protected by his principle of public ownership. This plan would not require Federal
expenditures. The project would be self-financing through the issue of bonds.
Federal aid, so far as necessary, would be given. Herbert Hoover's only pro

nouncement on Boulder Dam is that he favors a "high dam." At. New York he
declared himself irrevocably against public ownership. And the real heart of the
whole Boulder Dam controversy, as Senator Hiram Johnson is now proclaiming to |
the people of California, is the question of public ownership and control versus
private ownership, or private control of a publicly owned project.
On the prohibition issue Mr. McNab substitutes ridicule for reason. His re- j
marks on this subject need no discussion. But then he launches into the farm prob- i
lem, with the concluding indictment that all Smith promises to do to get action is a '
promise that "he will appoint a committee to study the question." But everyone
who has followed this campaign, and especially the farmer, knows that Gov. Smith's
proposal for farm relief is very definite: He acepts the principle of the McNary-
Haugen Bill, that the only way the farm problem can be solved is through the con
trol of the crop surplus, and that the cost of such control, and the sale of the
surplus abroad, shall be charged against the crops benefited by the plan. This plan,
in effect, is merely to extend the benefits of the protective tariff to the farmer.
Smith promises further, that a committee of experts will be put to work on the
details of the machinery for this plan, ready to report to Congress on March 4. Mr.
Hoover, on the other hand, has definitely rejected the principle of the McNary-
Haugcn Bill, offers by way of remedy the tariff, which unaided does not work for
the benefit of the farmer; the development of waterways, which will take from 15
to 20 years, and co-operative marketing and private organization are incapable of
providing any sure or immediate relief to the farmer. How about that, Mr. McNab?
One final shot: Mr. McNab lauded the hoped for Hooverian foreign policy,
yet Mr. Hoover has so far departed from his Quaker traditions as to declare that
the basis of peace is that "We must not only be just; we must be respected." He
has swallowed, completely, the doctrines of the big navy jingoists and of the advo
cates of dollar diplomacy in South America. Such is the "delicate" way this Quaker
deals with "delicate" foreign relations!
We'll leave it to the jury, Mr. McNab! Those policies are "indefensible."

Editor, Sir:
1. An honor system which has to be enforced is a contradiction in terms.
a. Honor is a trait of character. It cannot be enforced.
b. People who do the right thing for fear of the consequences if they do the
wrong thing are not honorable (in the true sense of the word).
2. An honor system" which is enforced differs in no substantial particular from the
system of having proctors at examinations.
a. Instead of being watched by officials, the students watch each other.
b. In either case there is present the element of compulsion
(1) Those who wish to cheat will be restrained from so doing (presuma
bly) by the fear of expulsion. Are they being honorable?
(2) The penalty is the same under the so-called honor system as under
the proctoring system. Where does the opportunity for being honor
able come in?
(3) Those who are truly honorable will be so under either system.
c. Consequently it is a misnomer to call the present system an honor system.
3. What a true honor system should be: ,
a. Each man should be left to his own work and should be entirely free from
supervision of any kind.
b. Each man should be so trusted that he should have opportunity to cheat
whenever he cared to, but, being honorable, he would not do so.
4. Impracticability of a true honor system:
a. It depends wholly on the calibre of the students.
b. For that reason it will work only under exceptional circumstances.
e.g., where the student body is a small, well-knit whole, the members
knowing each other intimately.
c. It will not work at Stanford.
(1) Altho the general class of men and women is high, there are enough
of the lower type to make such a system a failure.
(2) The same would be true of any university .of equal size. The law of
averages creeps in—some of the lower type student will always be
present.
5. What is to be done:
a. Stop calling the present system an honor system. It's misleading.
b. Probably better to change back to the proctor system.
(1) More efficient.
(2) Saves students the embarrassment of having to denounce their fellows.

Editor of the Dippy,
Honoured Sir: ....
As a lover of truth and accuracy, particularly in the public prints, I must rise
in anger to utter a few feeble words of protest against a gross misstatement of
fact in the editorial columns of Thursday's Dippy, even though it make it necessary
for me to tear myself from my "almost incessant toil.
As you probably realize, sir, my wrath was aroused by your somewhat sneering
references to "a dryball with an average of 153 plus 306. Straight A with two
quarters to go."
First to correct a minor error, if the learned editor had looked longer he would
have noticed that the student in question came here with ten units and consequently
has only one quarter to go. 1 his, however, was excusable and merely in keeping
with the traditions of the paper.
Let us turn to the more important part of the question. 1 o prevent misunder
standing, let us start with a definition of terms, using the Frosh Bible as our best
and perhaps only authority. There, the term above referred to is defined as fol
lows: "Strictly local expression for the amoeba who came here to study and did.
'On the Boat' means nothing to him. Constantly in the library, but doesn't know
that there's anything under the tables, etc."
With this definition in mind, I am sure that even you, sir, will realize that the
term is wholly inaccurate in its recent application. That the youth referred to has
this high and perhaps unprecedented average is true; but there, sir, the truth of your
editorial stops. So far from not being "on the boat" or from being unknown, he
has shown sufficient interest in the vessel to win a circle S in a minor sport. (Inci
dentally, can the learned editor show as much?) On the second count, "constantly
in the library, etc.," the youth in question, on the contrary, goes there very seldom,
and from the name which he uses to designate the place (furnished by request) I
feel sure that so far from not knowing that there's anything under the tables, he
is acutely conscious that there is. He may frequently be seen loitering about the
campus with some of the select few whom he favors with his company and at
times may even be seen engaged in that most useless and wasteful of all occupa*
tions —talking with me in my office (The Encrusted Jerkin, alias The Union Store)
"in those few moments when I can tear myself from my almost incessant toil."
Fnally, he can almost invariably be seen in the Cellar having his tea and toast
about four p.m. daily (except Sunday).
In short, sir, I frankly, and, I feel, reasonably, resent this absolutely unfounded
charge made against one whose only sin is in his having a larger supply than usual
of the material of which brains are made; who is cherished by his friends as a
gentleman, a scholar, and facile princeps of good fellows. I humbly suggest that if

Editor of the Dippy,
Honoured Sir: ....
As a lover of truth and accuracy, particularly in the public prints, I must rise
in anger to utter a few feeble words of protest against a gross misstatement of
fact in the editorial columns of Thursday's Dippy, even though it make it necessary
for me to tear myself from my "almost incessant toil.
As you probably realize, sir, my wrath was aroused by your somewhat sneering
references to "a dryball with an average of 153 plus 306. Straight A with two
quarters to go."
First to correct a minor error, if the learned editor had looked longer he would
have noticed that the student in question came here with ten units and consequently
has only one quarter to go. 1 his, however, was excusable and merely in keeping
with the traditions of the paper.
Let us turn to the more important part of the question. 1 o prevent misunder
standing, let us start with a definition of terms, using the Frosh Bible as our best
and perhaps only authority. There, the term above referred to is defined as fol
lows: "Strictly local expression for the amoeba who came here to study and did.
'On the Boat' means nothing to him. Constantly in the library, but doesn't know
that there's anything under the tables, etc."
With this definition in mind, I am sure that even you, sir, will realize that the
term is wholly inaccurate in its recent application. That the youth referred to has
this high and perhaps unprecedented average is true; but there, sir, the truth of your
editorial stops. So far from not being "on the boat" or from being unknown, he
has shown sufficient interest in the vessel to win a circle S in a minor sport. (Inci
dentally, can the learned editor show as much?) On the second count, "constantly
in the library, etc.," the youth in question, on the contrary, goes there very seldom,
and from the name which he uses to designate the place (furnished by request) I
feel sure that so far from not knowing that there's anything under the tables, he
is acutely conscious that there is. He may frequently be seen loitering about the
campus with some of the select few whom he favors with his company and at
times may even be seen engaged in that most useless and wasteful of all occupa*
tions —talking with me in my office (The Encrusted Jerkin, alias The Union Store)
"in those few moments when I can tear myself from my almost incessant toil."
Fnally, he can almost invariably be seen in the Cellar having his tea and toast
about four p.m. daily (except Sunday).
In short, sir, I frankly, and, I feel, reasonably, resent this absolutely unfounded
charge made against one whose only sin is in his having a larger supply than usual
of the material of which brains are made; who is cherished by his friends as a
gentleman, a scholar, and facile princeps of good fellows. I humbly suggest that if
our campus editors would remain awake a little more, motor cars, yell leaders, and
reputations would be much more safe in our modest community.
I remain, sir,
None too cordially yours,
FREDERICK MALCOLM COMBELLACK.
The Editor, Sir:
Please allow me a little space in answer to the article by Mr. Masao Suma in
the columns of your Daily of Oct. 18th, which strikes me very much. I wish I had
2 copy of the alleged attack on Mr. Tsurumi by Mr. H. W. Giang. As it is I have
only the article by Mr. Suma, which was an attempt to defend the Japanese speaker
and the imperialistic policy of the Japanese government.
It surprises me to learn that Mr. Suma, my former classmate, and an able and
diligent scholar should let his conscience and his sense of justice be overcome by
his ardor to defend the wrongdoings of his country. It is not my desire to take
issue with Mr. Suma. Yet at the same time I cannot overlook his deliberate at
tempt to present distorted facts about the truth of the relations between Giina and
Japan. Whether or not Japan deliberately interfered with China's domesic affairs,
thus causing the clashes in Shantung; whether or not Japan has ever been fair and
just, I leave it to the fair-minded public to decide. It is of coursc natural that Mr.
Suma, being a Japanese national, should deliberately attempt as all Japanese do,
to present to the people as benevolent a picture of Japanese imperialism as could be
painted. The world has seen too much of Japan's deeds to have faith in her any
morel Not the Chinese at least!
In conclusion, I would like to have one more word. Mr. Suma called Mr. H. W.
Chang a coward. 1 believe it was Mr. Chang's gentlemanly way not to embarrass
Mr. Tsurumi with such questions which he well knew the speaker would evade or
could never answer. It was a case of saving the Japanese speaker's face.
I thank you for the valuable space.
Yours sincerely,
QUON S. LEONG.
The Editor, Sir:
In the face of today's campus straw vote, yesterday's interview with John L.
McNab, as printed in the Daily, should not in fairness stand unanswered. In the
article Mr. McNab is referred to as "a jurist of national repute." That statement
should first be corrected. Mr. McNab is not a jurist—even of home-town note.
Any jury of his alleged fellow jurists would quickly settle that point. Mr. McNab
is simply a very adroit, very shrewd, criminal lawyer and politician. Such is his
reputation. It is in the light of his true character, then, that I wish to deal with
the subject matter of yesterday's interview.
His statements on the issue of the campaign were exactly typical of the kind of
manipulations a great criminal lawyer must indulge in—intellectual and factual
manipulations. Let us see. First, as to Boulder Dam, the Swing-Johnson Bill, and
water power: Mr. McNab declares that Gov. Smith is"for the scrapping of the
whole project and the setting up of a commission of seven states to handle and
finance Boulder Dam." That that statement is false can be proved by a few
citations from Gov. Smith's Denver speech, where lie dealt exhaustively with the
•whole question of power, including Boulder Dam. He first laid down the basic
principle by which he promised to be guided in dealing with every angle of the
power question: that where power resources are owned by the Federal government
they should remain under the Federal government; where they arc owned by one
state, or by several states jointly, they should be under the control of these states,
severally or jointly, as the case may be. Then he said: "By control I mean absolute
retention of the power itself, by owning and controlling the site and the plant at
the place of generation." Turning to Boulder Dam in particular, his stand is
equally clear: First, if, under the investigation now being carried on by Federal
engineers, and in the light of the attitude of the several states involved, Congress
should determine that the best course is for the Federal Government to build the
project, Governor Smith promises to rush the project to completion under the exist
ing plan, (the Swing-Johnson plan in general). Therefore is it not clear that Mr.
McNab made a plain misstatement when he said that Governor Smith favored
"scrapping" the whole project- The second point Gov. Smith made, at Denver, in
reference to Boulder Dam, was that if the present project failed of enactment lie
would immediately re-submit all the available data to Congress, and drive this
project through to immediate action. Now it is true that Gov. Smith has, foremost
among his plans, in case the present one fails, a proposal for a seven-state power
authority, under which the interests of the seven states and of the public would be
protected by his principle of public ownership. This plan would not require Federal
expenditures. The project would be self-financing through the issue of bonds.
Federal aid, so far as necessary, would be given. Herbert Hoover's only pro

nouncement on Boulder Dam is that he favors a "high dam." At. New York he
declared himself irrevocably against public ownership. And the real heart of the
whole Boulder Dam controversy, as Senator Hiram Johnson is now proclaiming to |
the people of California, is the question of public ownership and control versus
private ownership, or private control of a publicly owned project.
On the prohibition issue Mr. McNab substitutes ridicule for reason. His re- j
marks on this subject need no discussion. But then he launches into the farm prob- i
lem, with the concluding indictment that all Smith promises to do to get action is a '
promise that "he will appoint a committee to study the question." But everyone
who has followed this campaign, and especially the farmer, knows that Gov. Smith's
proposal for farm relief is very definite: He acepts the principle of the McNary-
Haugen Bill, that the only way the farm problem can be solved is through the con
trol of the crop surplus, and that the cost of such control, and the sale of the
surplus abroad, shall be charged against the crops benefited by the plan. This plan,
in effect, is merely to extend the benefits of the protective tariff to the farmer.
Smith promises further, that a committee of experts will be put to work on the
details of the machinery for this plan, ready to report to Congress on March 4. Mr.
Hoover, on the other hand, has definitely rejected the principle of the McNary-
Haugcn Bill, offers by way of remedy the tariff, which unaided does not work for
the benefit of the farmer; the development of waterways, which will take from 15
to 20 years, and co-operative marketing and private organization are incapable of
providing any sure or immediate relief to the farmer. How about that, Mr. McNab?
One final shot: Mr. McNab lauded the hoped for Hooverian foreign policy,
yet Mr. Hoover has so far departed from his Quaker traditions as to declare that
the basis of peace is that "We must not only be just; we must be respected." He
has swallowed, completely, the doctrines of the big navy jingoists and of the advo
cates of dollar diplomacy in South America. Such is the "delicate" way this Quaker
deals with "delicate" foreign relations!
We'll leave it to the jury, Mr. McNab! Those policies are "indefensible."

Editor, Sir:
1. An honor system which has to be enforced is a contradiction in terms.
a. Honor is a trait of character. It cannot be enforced.
b. People who do the right thing for fear of the consequences if they do the
wrong thing are not honorable (in the true sense of the word).
2. An honor system" which is enforced differs in no substantial particular from the
system of having proctors at examinations.
a. Instead of being watched by officials, the students watch each other.
b. In either case there is present the element of compulsion
(1) Those who wish to cheat will be restrained from so doing (presuma
bly) by the fear of expulsion. Are they being honorable?
(2) The penalty is the same under the so-called honor system as under
the proctoring system. Where does the opportunity for being honor
able come in?
(3) Those who are truly honorable will be so under either system.
c. Consequently it is a misnomer to call the present system an honor system.
3. What a true honor system should be: ,
a. Each man should be left to his own work and should be entirely free from
supervision of any kind.
b. Each man should be so trusted that he should have opportunity to cheat
