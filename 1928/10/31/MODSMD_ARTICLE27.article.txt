# STANFORD FROSH HAVE HARD GAME HERE SATURDAY
## U.S.C. Babes Show Powerful Offensive Drive; Cards Hit by Injuries

Coach Husky Hunt's freshmen have
more than a large-sized assignment
lined up for Saturday when they meet
the University of Southern California
yearlings in the Stanford Stadium.
The southern team fought a 0 to 0 tie
with the California frosh last week,
duplicating the U.S.C. varsity game
a week previous.
The Trojans have a powerful eleven
which has gained far more yardage
than the Bear Cubs, but, as was the
case in the varsity contest, the Cali
fornia freshmen were able to hold
them to a scoreless tie. Ernie Pink
ert, former San Bernardino high
school star, in this game "looked con
siderably like a ballplayer for the
Trojans, and will probably land a
regular berth as quarterback on How
ard Jones' varsity next year," accord
ing to the Los Angeles Times. The
writer added that he will look a lot
better with some real interference, in
which the Trojans are said to be lack
ing.
Dusty Allen, who played a splendid
game for the Cards in the fullback
position last Saturday, is still on
crutches and may not be in the Stan
lord lineup against U.S.C. He is the
mainstay of the Cardinal secondary
defense, and in addition, is a good
ball-carrier. The only other freshman
who did not show up for practice yes
terday was Ebey, guard, who is in the
Palo Alto Hospital with a bad case of
poison oak. However, Rudy Rintala,
fast halfback, is again working out
with the squad; so prospects for a
Stanford win next Saturday are still
bright.
