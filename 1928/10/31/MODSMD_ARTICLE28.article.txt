# BIG GAME ISSUE COPY DEADLINES SET BY OLD BOY
## 
### 
Though he's hurrying along these days
so fast that his whiskers are tangling up
behind his ears, the Old Boy pauses long
enough to send up his monthly shout for
copy for the Big Game number. Coach
Jack Shoup states that anyone may turn
out but he who fails to turn in his art
copy by Friday, November 9, and literary
copy Saturday, November 10, will be dis
qualified. Puns, quips, and jokes con
cerning football, the Big Game, or Christ
mas are especially desired, but any other
copy will be gratefully received.
Manager Dick Holt announces that
anyone may see the next eight copies
upon purchase of a season's ticket of
$1.75. These may be had at the Chap
arral office, from Quad salesmen, and
student solicitors. No scalping of any
sort will be tolerated.
