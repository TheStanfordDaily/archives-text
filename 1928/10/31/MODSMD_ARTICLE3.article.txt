# 'A CERTAIN WOMAN' PLANS LONG WALK TO SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### 
It's a long, long way to San
Francisco, at least when the dis
tance is covered on foot. So
thinks a certain Stanford woman
who has accepted a bet that she
can walk from Palo Alto to the
city of Saint Francis in seven
hours.
She is now planning daily
walks to get in practice for the
marathon. On a Saturday in the
near future she will start out
accompanied by two friends who
will walk and ride in relays, one
driving an auto while the other
walks. In order to cover the 31
miles to San Francisco, the fair
lady must average about
miles per hour. Who said the
rough tradition does not prevail?
