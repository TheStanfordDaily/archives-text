# FROSH GRID PLAYERS CLASH WITH SENIORS
## 
### 
In what is expected to be the most
crucial game of the schedule, the
freshman griddera will meet the sen
ior interclass team this afternoon at
4 o'clock in the stadium. Doth teams
are pointed for the game and a vic
tory by either side will practically
determine the winner of the football
title.
Following their victory from the
sophomore eleven last week, the 1932
team lias spent much time in develop
ing new plays for today's contest.
With a light but fast backfield, the
freshmen expect to make their gains
on a speedy passing attack and sweep
ing end runs.

Outfielder Roy Johnson cost the
San Francisco Seals $75,000, or as
much as President Coolidge does the
United States for one year.
