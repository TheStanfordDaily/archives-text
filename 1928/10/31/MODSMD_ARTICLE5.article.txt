FRIERICCHSHAFEN, Oct. 30. (/P)
â€”With the welcome information this
evening that the Graf Zeppelin was
more than halfway across the Atlantic
on her homing flight and had entered
a zone of fine weather, the spirits of
the German public rose perceptibly.
The reports of the earlier part of the
flight with tales of stormy weather
had caused some misgivings.
It was estimated that the dirigible
up to noon, Eastern Standard Time,
had covered about 2800 miles in 34
flying hours. Not all of this was on a
direct course, however, for Dr. Hugo
Eckener, apparently had been forced
to guide the great airship around a
storm.
It was calculated that if the weather
continues fine the airship may be ex
pected to complete its first round trip
commercial crossing of the Atlantic
by air tomorrow evening. Whether it
will land here at that time or await
daylight on Thursday depends on
weather conditions.
