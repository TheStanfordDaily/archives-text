# Union Club Upholds Encina Eaters in Food Complaint
## 
### 
Going on record as being "Entirely
in sympathy with the Encina Com
mons and Eating Clubs and entirely
out of sympathy with the Administra
tion," in the present food controversy,
the Stanford Union Club in a meeting
last night passed a motion extending
their sympathy to these eating groups.
R O. Boyd was elected president and
Fred Allen secretary and treasurer of
the club at the meeting.
