# CHOLERA CAN BE CHECKED, SAYS DOCTOR
## D'Herelle States Spread of Plague May Be Halted By Bacteriophage 
### 
"Death or recovery o£ a cholera pa
tient depends entirely on whether the
j bacteria of disease or the parasite
bacteriophage wins out," declared Dr.
j F. d'Herelle in his lecture last night
i in the Assembly Hall on "My Mission
! in India for the Study of Cholera."
Dr. d'Herelle, discoverer of the
phenomenon of bacteriophagy, de
' scribed in his talk the workings of
j this microscopic activity. During the
i war, as Director of the Vaccine De
i purt.ment of the Pasteur Institute, he
I studied dysentery and the plienome
j non of immunity, and discovered that
; the bacteria were destroyed by the
action of a filterable virus, which lie
named bacteriophage, or destroyer of
■ bacteria. Strength of the virus in
creased by repeated isolation, so that
a tiny part could destroy millions of
bacteria by the enzyme it produced.
j The same phenomenon was found in
cholera cases.
"India is the home of cholera," con
-1 linued the lecturer. "We do not know
why this is so; probably it is due in
j great part to the sacred waters of the
Ganges, and stagnant pools supposed
i to come from this river, in which the
: pilgrims bathe as a religious rite.
Water in some of these pools has
been there over a thousand years. The
■ sick bathe in it to be healed, and the
j infection is spread by means of these
| pilgrims over the country. Natives are
Icften seen dying of cholera in the
I streets.
"In our studies of cholera victims
in the Punjab, it was found that symp
! Toms of the disease increased as the
I activity of the bacteriophage de-
I creased. Some wells in this district
contained the bacteriophage active in
I cholera, and these communities re
main immune. It is impossible, there
j fore, to prevent the disease by plac
■ ing even as little as one or two
[ounces of the virus in a village well,
| and the epidemic may be controlled
| by introducing the virus into cholera
'victims, in whom recovery usually
j follows."

j non of immunity, and discovered that
; the bacteria were destroyed by the
action of a filterable virus, which lie
named bacteriophage, or destroyer of
■ bacteria. Strength of the virus in
creased by repeated isolation, so that
a tiny part could destroy millions of
bacteria by the enzyme it produced.
j The same phenomenon was found in
cholera cases.
"India is the home of cholera," con
-1 linued the lecturer. "We do not know
why this is so; probably it is due in
j great part to the sacred waters of the
Ganges, and stagnant pools supposed
i to come from this river, in which the
: pilgrims bathe as a religious rite.
Water in some of these pools has
been there over a thousand years. The
■ sick bathe in it to be healed, and the
j infection is spread by means of these
| pilgrims over the country. Natives are
Icften seen dying of cholera in the
I streets.
"In our studies of cholera victims
in the Punjab, it was found that symp
! Toms of the disease increased as the
I activity of the bacteriophage de-
I creased. Some wells in this district
contained the bacteriophage active in
I cholera, and these communities re
main immune. It is impossible, there
j fore, to prevent the disease by plac
■ ing even as little as one or two
[ounces of the virus in a village well,
| and the epidemic may be controlled
| by introducing the virus into cholera
'victims, in whom recovery usually
j follows."
