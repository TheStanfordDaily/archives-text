# RECEPTION PLANS FOR CANDIDATE'S ARRIVAL CHANGED
## 
### 
Plans for the reception of Herbert
Hoover next Monday afternoon were
enlarged and slightly changed at a
meeting of the Rally Committee held
yesterday. Herb Wenig, who presided
over the meeting, stressed.the point
that "this reception is not a political
rally nor a circus affair, but a spon
taneous, personal tribute to Stan
ford's most illustrious son."
After a heated discussion, it was
decided not to decorate the campus
or Palm Drive but merely to suggest
that the various living groups display
the national flag wherever possible.
It was contended that excessive deco
ration would not only detract instead
of add to the general effect but would
also be contrary to established cus
tom.
If possible, the parade from the rail
road station up Palm Drive, which
will be led by the Stanford band, will
extend as far as the postoffice where
the band will draw off to one side
and allow the Republican candidate
and his party to proceed to his home
alone where he will have time for a
short rest before delivering an ad
dress from his study over a nation
wide hook-up of radio stations.
The railroad station, drop gates, and
the entrance to Palm Drive are being
decorated by the City of Palo Alto
which will also, with the aid of the
Rally Committee, have charge of the
policing of the crowds and the park
ing of automobiles.
A special section along the railroad
track will be reserved exclusively for
Stanford students and the yell leaders
will direct yells and songs.
Tt is expected that the Hoover
party will arrive at the station at
1:30 o'clock, but to avoid any hitch
in the plans a committee was ap
pointed to see the Stanford and Palo
Alto fire departments about having
the fire sirens blow about a half hour
before time for the station reception.
Further planning and the direction
of the work over the week-end were
placed in the hands of Leon Levi, who
will have the assistance of those mem
bers of the Rally Committee who are
not going to the U.S.C. game.
