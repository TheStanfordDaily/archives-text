# SMITH DECLARES EXTRA CONGRESS SESSION USELESS
## Democratic Nominee Attacks Hoover Farm Relief Stand; Promises Workers Laws if Elected; Gives Power Plan 
### 
NEWARK, N.J., Oct. 31 (/P).—Gov
ernor Alfred E. Smith tonight in a
speech here declared Herbert Hoover's
proposal for a special session of Con
gress to tackle the farm problem "to be
a surrender for the purpose of securing
votes" and demanded to know what
could be accomplished in such a session
in view of the Republican candidate's
position on the farm question.
The Democratic standard bearer in an
address prepared for a one speech drive
into New Jersey argued that Mr. Hoo
ver's opposition to these "underlying
principles behind the cause of farm de
pression" never will be known and be
sides his rival for the presidency has
refused to accept the principle of the
control of the exportable surplus. He
added "without such control there can
be no adequate farm relief."
Besides raking his opponent's posi
tion on this issue the governor promised
the workmen of the nation if the Demo
cratic party were placed in power that
in regard to the use of injunctions to
labor disputes "a definite remedy by
laws" would be provided to preserve the
constitutional guarantees of individual
liberty of free speech and free assem
blage.
The Democratic candidate also chal
lenged Mr. Hoover to make his position
clear on various issues of the campaign.
"I have made myself perfectly clear,"
he said; "the man who has not made
himself clear is Mr. Hoover."
Declaring he took as the text of his
address the statement that "You can
fool some of the people all of the time,
all of the people some of the time, but
you cannot fool all of the people all of
the time," the nominee asked why
Charles E. Hughes had not accepted the
Republican candidacy.
"He is the only one who is making
any fight," he declared. "What are we
up against? The same old thing that we
have suffered for eight years; a candi
date for the office of the presidency of
the United States who is unable to talk
for himself.
The governor contended that as an
"indication of the desperation of the Re
publican party on the farm question,"
Governor McMullen of Nebraska had
hurried to Washington and urged the
Republican candidate to make a promise
to call the Congress into special session
in order to handle the farm question.
"The story of these conferences is an
interesting sidelight on the Republican
candidate," he continued. "They must
have begged him to say something, any
thing to make some appeal to the farm
er. They must have pleaded for just a
few kind words. Then word came from
the headquarters of Mr. Hoover that the
extra session was discussed, but no de
sion was arrived at.
"Immediately thereafter Senator Bo
rah went into conference with the Re
publican candidate, and, following the
conference, Mr. Hoover yielded.
"He spoke a kind word. He actually
got himself to the point of saying "ex
tra session." Aside from the fact that
this seems to be a surrender for the
purpose of securing votes, what would
be accomplished at an extra session of
Congress in view of Mr. Hoover's well

refused to accept the principle of the
control of the exportable surplus. He
added "without such control there can
be no adequate farm relief."
Besides raking his opponent's posi

the workmen of the nation if the Demo
cratic party were placed in power that
in regard to the use of injunctions to
labor disputes "a definite remedy by
laws" would be provided to preserve the
constitutional guarantees of individual
liberty of free speech and free assem

The Democratic candidate also chal
lenged Mr. Hoover to make his position
clear on various issues of the campaign.
"I have made myself perfectly clear,"
he said; "the man who has not made
himself clear is Mr. Hoover."
Declaring he took as the text of his
address the statement that "You can
fool some of the people all of the time,
all of the people some of the time, but
you cannot fool all of the people all of
the time," the nominee asked why
Charles E. Hughes had not accepted the
Republican candidacy.
"He is the only one who is making
any fight," he declared. "What are we
up against? The same old thing that we
have suffered for eight years; a candi
date for the office of the presidency of
the United States who is unable to talk
for himself.
The governor contended that as an
"indication of the desperation of the Re
publican party on the farm question,"
Governor McMullen of Nebraska had
hurried to Washington and urged the
Republican candidate to make a promise
to call the Congress into special session
in order to handle the farm question.
"The story of these conferences is an
interesting sidelight on the Republican
candidate," he continued. "They must
have begged him to say something, any
thing to make some appeal to the farm
er. They must have pleaded for just a
few kind words. Then word came from
the headquarters of Mr. Hoover that the
extra session was discussed, but no de
sion was arrived at.
"Immediately thereafter Senator Bo
rah went into conference with the Re
publican candidate, and, following the
conference, Mr. Hoover yielded.
"He spoke a kind word. He actually
got himself to the point of saying "ex

this seems to be a surrender for the
purpose of securing votes, what would
be accomplished at an extra session of
Congress in view of Mr. Hoover's well
known opposition to the underlying
principle behind the cause of farm de
pression?"
NEWARK, N.J., Oct. 31 (/P).—Gov
ernor Alfred E. Smith tonight in a
speech here declared Herbert Hoover's
proposal for a special session of Con
gress to tackle the farm problem "to be
a surrender for the purpose of securing
votes" and demanded to know what
could be accomplished in such a session
in view of the Republican candidate's
position on the farm question.
The Democratic standard bearer in an
address prepared for a one speech drive
into New Jersey argued that Mr. Hoo
ver's opposition to these "underlying
principles behind the cause of farm de
pression" never will be known and be
