# DEMOCRAT DEBATERS PLEAD TO STOP BOOING AT ATTACK ON SMITH
## 
### 
A critical situation was avoided by the
i presence of mind of the Democratic team
| last night when Leon Rovetta, Califor
| nia speaker for the Republican party,
| launched into a personal attack oil Gov
' ernor Smith in the Stanford-California
del>ate held in the Scottish Rite Audi- i
torium in San Francisco.
In the presence of two thousand peo- J
pie the Smith supporters in the audience j
I began booing and cat-calling until the |
entire Democratic team rose and pleaded I
for silence. Virgil Whitaker, Stanford
Democrat, made a short speech in which
he pleaded for tolerance and the in
dulgence of the audience for the con
tinuance of the debate.
Rovetta partially apologized but stat
ed that the charge that Alfred E. Smith
drank daily had not been denied by the 1
Democratic headquarters.
The speakers from Stanford for Her
bert Hoover were Charles Prael and
Leon Carley. Wadieh Schibley and Vir
gil Whitaker spoke on the Democratic
side for Stanford.
After the situation that had arisen
over Rovetta's attack on Smith, John ,
Reynolds closed the discussion with a
few well-chosen, if facetious rejnarks,
and good will prevailed in the end.
