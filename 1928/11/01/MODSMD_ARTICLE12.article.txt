# THREE CLUBS ISSUES TODAY
## Campus Political Groups Plan Discussion of Party Nominees 
### 
Political campaigns of the three campus
presidential clubs will reach their climax
tonight when representatives of the or
ganizations will clash in a Hoover-Smith-
Thomas debate in the Assembly Hall at
8 o'clock. All of the clubs have shown
marked activity and will rest their cases
on facts presented to the public in to
night's contest. Professor Edgar E. Rob
inson will preside. An open forum will
follow the debate at which members of
the debate teams may be questioned from
the floor.
Robert Hume and John McClintock
will argue the cause of Herbert Hoover.
Hume has previously appeared on the
platform in the debate with Nevada in
1927 and the Joffre debate of last year.
He will speak on the issues of water
power and farm relief for the Republic
ans. McClintock, who took part in the
Cal-Tech and College of the Pacific con
tests last year, will cover the record and
life of Hoover and the prohibition ques
tion.
Bodle to Speak
Leading the Smith attack will be
George Bodle, president of the Stanford
Smith-for-President Club and veteran of
last year's U.S.C. debate. Bodle will
discuss the issues of foreign relations and
agriculture as well as presenting the
merits of Smith, "the man." George
Shibley, a newcomer to Stanford's for
ensic squad, will take up the questions of
water power and prohibition for the
Democrats.
Stewart Way, president of the Thomas
for-President Club, and Elizabeth Jack
son, a freshman and the only woman to
appear in the debate, will stress the ne
cessity of a third party due to the lack
of fundamental differences in the plat
forms of the two major parties. They
will maintain that in a country where
government is based on the two party
system, an opposition party is essential.
Farm Relief Question
Way will talk on water power, inter
national relations and farm relief, while
Miss Jackson will take the topics of un
employment, labor legislation, and Re
publican prosperity. Both speakers will
present the Socialist party's constructive
suggestions.
Main speeches will be limited to 12
minutes and rebuttals to 7. The Smith
forces will lead off in the debate to be
followed by the Republicans and Social
ists respectively. Rebuttal speeches will
be in the reverse order.
In 1924 a debate on the Coolidge-Davis-
LaFollette campaign packed the Assem
bly Hall. Due to the country-wide in
terest in the present campaign, the clubs
sponsoring the contest expect to have at
least as large an audience.
