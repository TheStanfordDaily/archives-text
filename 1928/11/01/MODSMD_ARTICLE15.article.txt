# RALLY TONIGHT AT PALO ALTO DEPOT FOR WARNER TEAM
## 
### 
A rally will be held tonight at
8:30 o'clock at the Southern
Pacific station in Palo Alto to
give the football team a send-off
on its trip to the southland for
the Trojan game. The train will
leave at 8:40.
Arrangements for the rally
point to a colorful leave-taking
for the gridsters. The Stanford
band will be present to play
some of the Cardinal songs. In
the absence of Scott Webster,
head yell-leader, the cheers will
be led by the assistants, Paul
Speegle and Fred J. Northway.
Hub Moffitt, in charge of the
rally, requests that as many stu
dents as possible turn out to give
the Stanford team a rousing
send-off.
