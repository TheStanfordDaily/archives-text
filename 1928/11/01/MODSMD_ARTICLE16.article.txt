"The thing that will remain after the
Stanford-U.S.C. game is past is the part
that Stanford students play as guests and
that we play as hosts in keeping up the
good spirit of sportsmanship that exists
between our schools," said Robert Beh
low, president of the Associated Students
of the University of Southern California,
in the annual "good-will" assembly yes
terday. "This spirit will never allow the
game between the Cards and Trojans to
be a 'grudge battle,'" he said.
Phil Cavalero, A.S.S.U. president, des
ignated the Honor System as the most
important problem before Stanford stu
dents in his first official address before
the student body. "Without the proper
attitude we can't do a thing, but if we
get the correct attitude, we will get the
correct action," said Cavalero.
"We are not going to give up the
Honor System : we are going to do every
thing in our power to put it over. The
question at hand is whether we are or
are not going on with Honor. All the
committees in the world are useless unless
the students get behind this thing and
develop the right attitude toward it."
Cavalero said that an open forum for
the discussion of the Honor System will
be held soon.
Janet Harris, president of A.W.S., de
scribed the organization of A.W.S., and
told the two aims for the present year:
first, to start a new gymnasium, and
second, to establish a satisfactory late
leave system. James Frank, chairman of
the Publications Board, outlines the work
done 011 the Stanford Lit, Chapparal,
Quad, and Daily. Herbert Wenig spoke
of the advantages derived from taking
part in debating and dramatics 011 the
campus.
