# FRESHMEN PLAY PESCADERO SQUAD IN SOCCER TODAY
## 
### 
For the second time this year the
â–  freshman soccer team will come in
I contact with outside competition when
| it meets the Pescadero High School
squad this afternoon at 4:15 o'clock
:on the varsity field. Last week the
| frosh were beaten by the San Mateo
i Junior College to the score of 7 to 0.
The first-year men have had sev- i
j eral practices since the San Mateo i
' game, so that if they have been able
to profit by their past experiences, j
they will probably be able to show
the high school team a little competi
tion.
| According to Coach Harry Maloney, 1
j Lhe freshmen showed lack of co-opera
| tion, no accuracy in passing, and
were too slow to get to the ball ahead
of their opponents in their last game. I
IHe has been trying to improve on !
; some of these faults during the last'
j practices.
Because of the Southern California j
I football game Saturday there have
been no soccer games scheduled for
| the week-end, but a game with the
San Jose Teachers College team has
been set for the frosh for next Tues
j day afternoon.
