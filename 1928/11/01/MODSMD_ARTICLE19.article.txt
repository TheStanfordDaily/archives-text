# CARDS, TROJANS CONCLUDE GRIND FOR GRID CLASH
## Believe Jones Is Instructing Backfield in Dropkicking To Overcome Fatal Jinx Of Blocked Conversions 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Fable has it that a kingdom was once
lost "all for the want of a horseshoe
nail." Howard Jones, coach of the
| Thundering Herd which Stanford meets
Saturday, is well aware of the moral
of the fable; he can translate it to foot
ball jargon and interpret the vital nail as
the vital dropkick, for the lack of con
verted touchdowns has been his hoodoo
since he started at U.S.C.
Four times in the last two seasons
I Jones' team has suffered because of poor
| dropkicks. Twice with Stanford and
i twice with Notre Dame, games could have
! been won or tied with just one point.
Rumor from Los Angeles reports that
Jones, in secret practice this week, has
been coaching Marshall Duffield and
: others of his backfield luminaries in the
J art of kicking an inflated prolate spheroid
j over the eighteen-foot crossbar. And
considering that the game may again be
I decided by the margin of one point, it
i does not seem unlikely that the U.S.C.
backs are seriously practicing dropkicking.
Finish Training
Stanford and Southern California have
each completed the strenuous training in
preparation for their all-important annual
; clash and are now tapering off so as to
be in the best of condition. The redshirt
i team will have a light workout and sig
nal drill here this afternoon and will
board the southbound train tonight for
Pasadena where they will stay until game
time, unless for a brief workout in the
Coliseum tomorrow.
At the present time Jones is worried
about the injury of Nathan Barrager,
Troy's fighting center and leader of their
defensive battery. Barrager has been in
the hospital with a hip injury and will
probably not be able to play Saturday.
Captain Jesse Hibbs, All-American tackle
of 1927, has returned to practice after a
couple of days absence with a bad cold.
Injuries Worry Coaches
Warner, too, has worries about injuries
to his regulars. It is still doubtful wheth
| er or not Spud Harder will be able to
return to his place at right end. At the
j other wing, another man, Dick Worden,
| will be seriously handicapped with injur
ies if he does get into the game. How
ever, Stanford has reason to be consoled
about the return of Frank Wilton at left
half. If the Cards do resort to aerial
j attack, the Hoffman-to-Wilton combina
j tion should be at its best.
! Jones has a great reason to be con
cerned about injuries. He hasn't the re
serve strength that Pop has, especially
in the backfield. As was demonstrated
in the Idaho and Fresno games, Stanford
has three very good backfield combina
tions. The Herd's best reserve strength
is in the line.

in the backfield. As was demonstrated
in the Idaho and Fresno games, Stanford
has three very good backfield combina

is in the line.

Saturday, is well aware of the moral

Finish Training
Stanford and Southern California have
each completed the strenuous training in
preparation for their all-important annual
; clash and are now tapering off so as to
be in the best of condition. The redshirt
i team will have a light workout and sig
nal drill here this afternoon and will
board the southbound train tonight for
Pasadena where they will stay until game
time, unless for a brief workout in the
Coliseum tomorrow.
At the present time Jones is worried
about the injury of Nathan Barrager,
Troy's fighting center and leader of their
defensive battery. Barrager has been in
the hospital with a hip injury and will
probably not be able to play Saturday.
Captain Jesse Hibbs, All-American tackle
of 1927, has returned to practice after a
couple of days absence with a bad cold.
