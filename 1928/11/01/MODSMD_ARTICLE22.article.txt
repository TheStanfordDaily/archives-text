# Professor Robinson's Pre-Election Survey

### 
The article by Professor Robinson (appearing elsewhere in this issue)
upon the probable outcome of the presidential election is one we are proud
to print, not only because it is to be syndicated, along with other of Pro
fessor Robinson's election prognostications, but also because it is a schol
arly study of a subject which elicits so much lmlf-baked prediction and
wild guessing that everyone is frantic now to know what's what.
Professor Robinson has studied the election returns of the past cam
paigns—of as many as eight in the case of some states —has formulated
them by counties, is able consequently to predict, as accurately as anyone
can, what party each state will swing toward, and thus can intelligently
attempt to "call" the election. He gives Hoover 280 electoral votes and
Smith 251. The victory, he says, will be won with the closest vote in
Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Vir
ginia, and Wisconsin.
llow will the vote go in those states? Professor Robinson thinks that
the female franchise may decide. He cites figures to show that in New
York in 1920, when women's suffrage commenced, the Republican vote
increased by one million, whereas the Democrats gained something more
than 20,000. Now if that distribution of votes should remain the same, it
can be seen that the women would easily swing New York for Hoover.
But, according to evidences, a heavier women's vote will be got out next
Tuesday in New York, and it is not known to which man the surplus will
be awarded.
Although he thinks the women may settle the election, Professor Rob
inson is not certain as to the result. His figures lead him to think Hoover
will be victor by an electoral college plurality of 14, but the destination of
the increase votes is unpredictable.,,
