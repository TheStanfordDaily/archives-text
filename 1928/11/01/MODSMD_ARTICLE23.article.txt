# Paving the Road of the Journalist

### 
A highly salutary effect which the tour of this country, made by the
British journalists, has had is the commencement of plans for the creation
of an American Institute of Journalism, to be organized upon the order
of the Institute of Journalism of the British Isles.
One of the chief weaknesses of the American Press is its unattractive
ness for men who acquire a fondness for journalism, whether in college
or later, but who are unwilling to devote their lives to so precarious a
profession. The British Institute has met this dilemma by protecting its
members, and it has been given credit for placing the English newspaper
profession upon the high plane it has there attained.
"Although in no sense," we read, "controlled by the newspaper em
ployes, the British Institute provides a minimum scale for reporters, main
tains a pension fund, cares for the widows and children of deceased news
paper men, and in many ways works for the upbuilding of the profession.
"Under its pension system, newspaper men are retired at 60 on a
pension of $1,100 annually, while the same pension is granted newspaper
women retired at 50."
Further provision is made for a worker in the profession who dies and
leaves minor children to be supported and educated.
Uncertainty of immediate pecuniary reward and fear for old age are,
to our knowledge, the chief deterrents which hold the "typewriter-minded"
from a profession which has interest and possibilities gaiore. If the pro
posed American Institute of Journalism can accomplish the elevation of
salaries and the introduction of certain provisions for crabbed age, an in
creased respect for, and a serious interest in, the newspaper profession
will grow up.
Perhaps someday virtually all of the profession will be "gentlemen of
the press."
