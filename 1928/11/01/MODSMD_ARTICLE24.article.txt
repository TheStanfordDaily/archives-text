# Clinical Notes on the Honor System
## 
### 
The University of California at Los Angeles finds that its honor sys
tem is weakening: witness the following portion of an editorial in the
Daily Bruin :
Each year the A.S.U.C. council is forced to discuss the failures
of the honor system and to consider the apparent necessity for its
abolishment. Each year it adopts an optimistic attitude and gives
the honor system another trial, but the time is coming when we shall
have to choose between 100 per cent co-operation in observing the
honor code, or the entire removal of our freedom in the matter and
the merited distrust of the faculty.
Have we grown up, or are we still in the pinafore stage of
development ?
The Daily Californian, on the other hand, mistaking the information
(as, we regret to say, it does much information coming from Stanford)
that the names of violators of the honor system here are to be published,
finds that the Stanford administration is "badgering" students into pub
lishing names, a move which it, under a proctor system, would not make.
If such a step as this (publishing of violators' names) is neces
sary to perfect the honor system, the honor system had better
remain imperfect. It is a step which the Stanford administration
would not take if a proctor system were in force, although it would
be as valuable in discouraging cheating under a proctor system as it
would be under an honor system. The Stanford administration
should not badger the students into taking a step which it would not
take itself.
