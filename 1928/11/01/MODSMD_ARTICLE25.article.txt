The Editor, Sir:
I have recently been told that it would
be necessary tu take down an elaborate
temporary garage constructed in a back
corner of Toy on Yard, because it is
against University regulations. This ga
rage which is so offensive consists of a
canvas drawn over a center beam, and
supported by two sticks. I have had this
up for three years now, and it has served
the purpose and convenience which it is
impossible to get elsewhere on the
campus. Were there regularly built ga
rages available, I would be glad to rent
one, but as there aren't, the next best
thing must be done. It is certainly very
inconvenient to take a canvas cover off
every morning, and put it on every eve
ning or when it rains; and so by putting
up a supporting stick the canvas is held
in place, and this saves a great deal of
time and bother.
I am sure that there is no more danger
of a fire, if that is what the fire chief
is concerned about, in one of the canvas
garages than in a canvas pulled over the
car. I fail to see any distinction be
tween the two. Of course if there was
a regular wooden garage built by a stu
dent on University property, there would
be some cause for complaint by the fire
chief, but the little inoffensive canvas
garage can certainly not harm anyone.
There is nothing in the Constitution or
By-Laws of Stanford about the matter,
and before I tear down the lightly con
structed and necessary garage, I would
like to have a ruling or opinion on the
question. It seems trivial, but where
garages are not available, I believe that
some consideration and co-operation
should be given to those who have gone
to the trouble and expense to provide a
dry place for their cars.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been an interested observer of
the forum in the Campus Comment deal
ing with the Honor System. There are
some who find the word "system" nau
seating and highly objectionable, because
the word has a tendency to be somewhat
anti-Rousseau in its strict meaning. This
attitude is puerile and is reminiscent of
the laity who continually bewail the
length or polysyllabic nature of scientific
words, but fail to see how inescapable
this is in accurate scientific nomencla
ture. Thus Honor System is practically
an idiom "by its extensive usage, and to
complain of its present accepted form
is mere caviling at words. There may be
other combinations that forward the

same concept; however, Honor System
has no diminution in prestige because
some are wont to acquaint the term
"system" with mechanical behavior of
cogs.
I am just an entering freshman and
have conducted myself in accordance
with the Honor System, and would not
have known that it was on trial had 1
not read of the bickering over it in the
Daily. 1 understand from the discussion
that a cynical or Vautrinesque attitude
has been aimed at this system. Of
course, iconoclasm has its virtues in
eradicating American Boy ideals or any
other adolescent principles, but I don't
see how any mature judgment can con
demn or slight a principle which borders
on self-government and equalization in
competition. Surely nothing can be
simpler than eliminating the cheat by
isolating him. Normally the cribber is
evading the instructor and can easily
effect his desires; however, his con
science would surely be varicose should
he be ablp to take unfair advantage in
the opprobrious eyes of the classroom
students. If a student is successful in
gyping the examinations he only pro
longs the evasion, and eventually is heir
to retribution. The Honor System has
one quality that should qualify it even if
it had no other advantage and that it,
under its practice, one is not necessarily
a prude if lie fails to abet a cheater. He
would not be a poor sport if he failed
to aid the cribber under any system;
consequently where the Honor Code is
popular one has little qualms in denying
the cheat who is so inharmonious with
the prevailing spirit.
The Honor System is essentially an
intellectual idea as it fosters merited ef
fort. In testing knowledge there should
be an atmosphere of individual freedom
to display one's learning without a stig
ma of surveillance and distrust. Indi
vidual responsibility is a result of indi
vidual pride and its maintenance. To
have the Proctor System is not to have
intellectual freedom and its concurring
self-responsibility. The Proctor System
can never approach the Honor Code in
effectiveness and without doubt the lat
ter has a wider scope in student conduct
on the campus. The Honor System can
not be practiced without influencing more
control in the student, and give him more
stability of character. Even if there is
an undercurrent of caustic ridicule of
the Honor System, is this ultra-modern
sophomoric attitude going to bring about
the discontinuation of a thoroughly bene
ficial and convenient method of regulat
ing student conduct?

However, I may be peculiar in my dis
likes for long books. They almost in
variably get on my nerves before the end
is in sight.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been an interested observer of
the forum in the Campus Comment deal
ing with the Honor System. There are
some who find the word "system" nau
seating and highly objectionable, because
the word has a tendency to be somewhat
anti-Rousseau in its strict meaning. This
attitude is puerile and is reminiscent of
the laity who continually bewail the
length or polysyllabic nature of scientific
words, but fail to see how inescapable
this is in accurate scientific nomencla
ture. Thus Honor System is practically
an idiom "by its extensive usage, and to
complain of its present accepted form
is mere caviling at words. There may be
other combinations that forward the

same concept; however, Honor System
has no diminution in prestige because
some are wont to acquaint the term
"system" with mechanical behavior of
cogs.
I am just an entering freshman and
have conducted myself in accordance
with the Honor System, and would not
have known that it was on trial had 1
not read of the bickering over it in the
Daily. 1 understand from the discussion
that a cynical or Vautrinesque attitude
has been aimed at this system. Of
course, iconoclasm has its virtues in
eradicating American Boy ideals or any
other adolescent principles, but I don't
see how any mature judgment can con
demn or slight a principle which borders
on self-government and equalization in
competition. Surely nothing can be
simpler than eliminating the cheat by
isolating him. Normally the cribber is
evading the instructor and can easily
effect his desires; however, his con
science would surely be varicose should
he be ablp to take unfair advantage in
the opprobrious eyes of the classroom
students. If a student is successful in
gyping the examinations he only pro
longs the evasion, and eventually is heir
to retribution. The Honor System has
one quality that should qualify it even if
it had no other advantage and that it,
under its practice, one is not necessarily
a prude if lie fails to abet a cheater. He
would not be a poor sport if he failed
to aid the cribber under any system;
consequently where the Honor Code is
popular one has little qualms in denying
the cheat who is so inharmonious with
the prevailing spirit.
The Honor System is essentially an
intellectual idea as it fosters merited ef
fort. In testing knowledge there should
be an atmosphere of individual freedom
to display one's learning without a stig
ma of surveillance and distrust. Indi
vidual responsibility is a result of indi
vidual pride and its maintenance. To
have the Proctor System is not to have
intellectual freedom and its concurring
self-responsibility. The Proctor System
can never approach the Honor Code in
effectiveness and without doubt the lat
ter has a wider scope in student conduct
on the campus. The Honor System can
not be practiced without influencing more
control in the student, and give him more
stability of character. Even if there is
an undercurrent of caustic ridicule of
the Honor System, is this ultra-modern
sophomoric attitude going to bring about
the discontinuation of a thoroughly bene
ficial and convenient method of regulat
ing student conduct?

The Editor, Sir:
I have recently been told that it would
be necessary tu take down an elaborate
temporary garage constructed in a back
corner of Toy on Yard, because it is
against University regulations. This ga
rage which is so offensive consists of a
canvas drawn over a center beam, and
supported by two sticks. I have had this
up for three years now, and it has served
the purpose and convenience which it is
impossible to get elsewhere on the
campus. Were there regularly built ga
rages available, I would be glad to rent
one, but as there aren't, the next best
thing must be done. It is certainly very
inconvenient to take a canvas cover off
every morning, and put it on every eve
ning or when it rains; and so by putting
up a supporting stick the canvas is held
in place, and this saves a great deal of
time and bother.
I am sure that there is no more danger
of a fire, if that is what the fire chief
is concerned about, in one of the canvas
garages than in a canvas pulled over the
car. I fail to see any distinction be
tween the two. Of course if there was
a regular wooden garage built by a stu
dent on University property, there would
be some cause for complaint by the fire
chief, but the little inoffensive canvas
garage can certainly not harm anyone.
There is nothing in the Constitution or
By-Laws of Stanford about the matter,

Daily. 1 understand from the discussion
that a cynical or Vautrinesque attitude
has been aimed at this system. Of
course, iconoclasm has its virtues in
eradicating American Boy ideals or any
other adolescent principles, but I don't
see how any mature judgment can con
demn or slight a principle which borders
on self-government and equalization in
competition. Surely nothing can be
simpler than eliminating the cheat by
isolating him. Normally the cribber is
evading the instructor and can easily
effect his desires; however, his con
science would surely be varicose should
he be ablp to take unfair advantage in
the opprobrious eyes of the classroom
students. If a student is successful in
gyping the examinations he only pro
longs the evasion, and eventually is heir
to retribution. The Honor System has
one quality that should qualify it even if
it had no other advantage and that it,
under its practice, one is not necessarily
a prude if lie fails to abet a cheater. He
would not be a poor sport if he failed
to aid the cribber under any system;
consequently where the Honor Code is
popular one has little qualms in denying
the cheat who is so inharmonious with
the prevailing spirit.
The Honor System is essentially an
intellectual idea as it fosters merited ef

be an atmosphere of individual freedom
to display one's learning without a stig

vidual responsibility is a result of indi
vidual pride and its maintenance. To
have the Proctor System is not to have
intellectual freedom and its concurring
self-responsibility. The Proctor System
can never approach the Honor Code in
effectiveness and without doubt the lat
ter has a wider scope in student conduct
on the campus. The Honor System can
not be practiced without influencing more
control in the student, and give him more
stability of character. Even if there is
an undercurrent of caustic ridicule of
the Honor System, is this ultra-modern
sophomoric attitude going to bring about
the discontinuation of a thoroughly bene
ficial and convenient method of regulat
ing student conduct?

The Editor, Sir:
I have recently been told that it would
be necessary tu take down an elaborate
temporary garage constructed in a back
corner of Toy on Yard, because it is
against University regulations. This ga
rage which is so offensive consists of a
canvas drawn over a center beam, and
supported by two sticks. I have had this
up for three years now, and it has served
the purpose and convenience which it is
impossible to get elsewhere on the
campus. Were there regularly built ga
rages available, I would be glad to rent
one, but as there aren't, the next best
thing must be done. It is certainly very
inconvenient to take a canvas cover off
every morning, and put it on every eve
ning or when it rains; and so by putting
up a supporting stick the canvas is held
in place, and this saves a great deal of
time and bother.
I am sure that there is no more danger
of a fire, if that is what the fire chief
is concerned about, in one of the canvas
garages than in a canvas pulled over the
car. I fail to see any distinction be
tween the two. Of course if there was
a regular wooden garage built by a stu
dent on University property, there would
be some cause for complaint by the fire
chief, but the little inoffensive canvas
garage can certainly not harm anyone.
There is nothing in the Constitution or
By-Laws of Stanford about the matter,
and before I tear down the lightly con
structed and necessary garage, I would
like to have a ruling or opinion on the
question. It seems trivial, but where
garages are not available, I believe that
some consideration and co-operation
should be given to those who have gone
to the trouble and expense to provide a
dry place for their cars.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been an interested observer of
the forum in the Campus Comment deal
ing with the Honor System. There are
some who find the word "system" nau
seating and highly objectionable, because
the word has a tendency to be somewhat
anti-Rousseau in its strict meaning. This
attitude is puerile and is reminiscent of
the laity who continually bewail the
length or polysyllabic nature of scientific
words, but fail to see how inescapable
this is in accurate scientific nomencla
ture. Thus Honor System is practically
an idiom "by its extensive usage, and to
complain of its present accepted form
is mere caviling at words. There may be
other combinations that forward the

same concept; however, Honor System
has no diminution in prestige because
some are wont to acquaint the term
"system" with mechanical behavior of
cogs.
I am just an entering freshman and
have conducted myself in accordance
with the Honor System, and would not

not read of the bickering over it in the
