"In Love With Love"—Alcazar.
San Francisco's favorite stage couple—
Dale Winter and Henry Duffy— have
chosen a dandy farce for their anniver
sary appearance at the Alcazar. (Just
four years ago they came West from Chi
cago and started Fate happening with
their production of "The Cat and the
Canary." So strong did they take with
San Francisco audiences that now they
own a chain of ten theaters on the Pa
cific Coast.)
As Ann Jordon, the flirt incarnate,
Miss Winter is furiously and ardently
wooed by two personable youths. They
even come to blows right in her living
room, and Henry Duffy, as one of the
lovers, becomes so downhearted that he
takes solace in the flowing bowl—with
particularly hilarious results from the
audience's viewpoint.
Mr. Duffy's appearance in this play is
of special interest, inasmuch as his fame
as a producer almost threatened to eclipse
his career as an actor. He has been so
busy acquiring new theaters that he has
not played at his home theater, the Al
cazar, for a year and a half. And he
passes up the romantic hero for the com
edy part —proving that he can do funny
roles as well as straight ones. We hope
he will be able to appear in San Fran
cisco oftener.
Stellar honors go to Dale Winter (Mrs.
Duffy). She succeeds in making the ca
pricious heroine a real person, and this
quality of reality is what makes her so
perennially popular. Smiling most of the
time, Miss Winter is beautiful enough for
anyone to fall in love with, and further
more she puts over some excellent act
ing. We like her better than any of the |
women stars Mr. Duffy has acting for \
him.
Alice Buchanana, praise be, is among |
those present. Her distinctive personal- j
ity attracts us greatly. Sometime we
would like to sec her in the leading part 1
of one of the Alcazar shows.
Ralph Kellard, as the quiet young en
gineer who unwittingly wins the fair ■
Ann, is well chosen for his role. He is I
new to us, and registers one hundred per j
ccnt in the romantic scenes.
"In Love With Love" has been staged 1
with finesse, and you will find it a spark- '
ling, gay, frivolous comedy. It is the
Duffys at their best—and you know how
good that is.
OTHER PLAYS
"Good News" has only one more week i

after this to run at the Curran. It's
collegiatc—what more can you ask of
any musical comedy ? Very good.
"The Squall" opened last night at the
Geary. Hot stuff—to be reviewed later.
"Kongo" continues to shock those who
wander into the New Capitol. Native
melodrama — shocking conversation and
poor morals featured.
"Daddies" is in its eighth week at
Duffy's President. Robert McWade is
the star of this funny show.
"Happy Days" has just re-opened the
Columbia Theater. Stars Max Dill, May
Boley, and Richard Carle.
"Easy for Zee Zee" is still drawing
the sophisticates to the Green Street The
ater. And A 1 Jolson's second Vitaphone
picture, "The Singing Fool," is all settled
for tremendous business at the Embassy.

Casper Hauser. By Jacob Wasser
mann. Translated by Caroline New
ton. (New York: Horace Liveright,
1928.)
He stumbled into Nuremberg a hun
dred years ago, a strange unkempt youth
of about seventeen. He walked as though
he had just learned how; he babbled in
coherently, knowing no more language
than a two-year-old. A letter he carried
bore the name Caspar Hauser.
Caspar Hauser had a keen mind and
the freatures of an aristocrat. Of his life
before the day he appeared in Nuremberg
lie knew nothing. He had vague mem
ories of a lighlless dungeon, and a man
who brought him fresh bread and water.
The story of this odd person is today
a mystery still. The facts of the case
are historical. Many believe that he was ;
the Crown Prince of Baden who had
been put out of the way in a castle and
later let loose in a large city in the hope
he would disappear.
To Wassermann, Caspar Hauser sym
bolizes tlie human being, pure, unsophis
ticated, and undefiled. He is thrown on
the hands of his fellow-men. They have
a chance to make him nobler and better;
but they fail utterly. "Caspar Hauser
provided the balance by which the mod
ern world is weighed and found wanting."
Caroline Newton's translation of the
book is admirable. The strong, expres
sive style of Wasserman is preserved.
But "Caspar Hauser" as a book, is too
confounded 10ng—467 pages to be exact.
The first hundred pages or so arc un
believably engrossing, but as one ap- J
proaches the middle of the volume, the I

Casper Hauser. By Jacob Wasser
mann. Translated by Caroline New
ton. (New York: Horace Liveright,
1928.)
He stumbled into Nuremberg a hun
dred years ago, a strange unkempt youth
of about seventeen. He walked as though
he had just learned how; he babbled in
coherently, knowing no more language
than a two-year-old. A letter he carried
bore the name Caspar Hauser.
Caspar Hauser had a keen mind and
the freatures of an aristocrat. Of his life
before the day he appeared in Nuremberg
lie knew nothing. He had vague mem
ories of a lighlless dungeon, and a man
who brought him fresh bread and water.
The story of this odd person is today
a mystery still. The facts of the case
are historical. Many believe that he was ;
the Crown Prince of Baden who had
been put out of the way in a castle and
later let loose in a large city in the hope
he would disappear.
To Wassermann, Caspar Hauser sym
bolizes tlie human being, pure, unsophis
ticated, and undefiled. He is thrown on
the hands of his fellow-men. They have
a chance to make him nobler and better;
but they fail utterly. "Caspar Hauser
provided the balance by which the mod
ern world is weighed and found wanting."
Caroline Newton's translation of the
book is admirable. The strong, expres
sive style of Wasserman is preserved.
But "Caspar Hauser" as a book, is too
confounded 10ng—467 pages to be exact.
The first hundred pages or so arc un
believably engrossing, but as one ap- J
proaches the middle of the volume, the I
"In Love With Love"—Alcazar.
San Francisco's favorite stage couple—
Dale Winter and Henry Duffy— have
chosen a dandy farce for their anniver
sary appearance at the Alcazar. (Just
four years ago they came West from Chi
cago and started Fate happening with
their production of "The Cat and the
Canary." So strong did they take with
San Francisco audiences that now they
own a chain of ten theaters on the Pa
cific Coast.)
As Ann Jordon, the flirt incarnate,
Miss Winter is furiously and ardently
wooed by two personable youths. They
even come to blows right in her living
room, and Henry Duffy, as one of the
lovers, becomes so downhearted that he
takes solace in the flowing bowl—with
particularly hilarious results from the
audience's viewpoint.
Mr. Duffy's appearance in this play is
of special interest, inasmuch as his fame
as a producer almost threatened to eclipse
his career as an actor. He has been so
busy acquiring new theaters that he has
not played at his home theater, the Al
cazar, for a year and a half. And he
passes up the romantic hero for the com
edy part —proving that he can do funny
roles as well as straight ones. We hope
he will be able to appear in San Fran
cisco oftener.
Stellar honors go to Dale Winter (Mrs.
Duffy). She succeeds in making the ca
pricious heroine a real person, and this
quality of reality is what makes her so
perennially popular. Smiling most of the
time, Miss Winter is beautiful enough for
anyone to fall in love with, and further
more she puts over some excellent act
ing. We like her better than any of the |
women stars Mr. Duffy has acting for \
him.
Alice Buchanana, praise be, is among |
those present. Her distinctive personal- j
ity attracts us greatly. Sometime we
would like to sec her in the leading part 1
of one of the Alcazar shows.
Ralph Kellard, as the quiet young en
gineer who unwittingly wins the fair ■
Ann, is well chosen for his role. He is I
new to us, and registers one hundred per j
ccnt in the romantic scenes.

been put out of the way in a castle and
later let loose in a large city in the hope
he would disappear.
To Wassermann, Caspar Hauser sym
bolizes tlie human being, pure, unsophis
ticated, and undefiled. He is thrown on
the hands of his fellow-men. They have
a chance to make him nobler and better;
but they fail utterly. "Caspar Hauser
provided the balance by which the mod
ern world is weighed and found wanting."
Caroline Newton's translation of the
book is admirable. The strong, expres
sive style of Wasserman is preserved.
But "Caspar Hauser" as a book, is too
confounded 10ng—467 pages to be exact.
The first hundred pages or so arc un
believably engrossing, but as one ap- J
proaches the middle of the volume, the I
"In Love With Love"—Alcazar.
San Francisco's favorite stage couple—
Dale Winter and Henry Duffy— have
chosen a dandy farce for their anniver
sary appearance at the Alcazar. (Just
four years ago they came West from Chi
cago and started Fate happening with
their production of "The Cat and the
Canary." So strong did they take with
San Francisco audiences that now they
own a chain of ten theaters on the Pa
cific Coast.)
As Ann Jordon, the flirt incarnate,
Miss Winter is furiously and ardently
wooed by two personable youths. They
even come to blows right in her living
room, and Henry Duffy, as one of the
lovers, becomes so downhearted that he
takes solace in the flowing bowl—with
particularly hilarious results from the
audience's viewpoint.
Mr. Duffy's appearance in this play is
of special interest, inasmuch as his fame
as a producer almost threatened to eclipse
his career as an actor. He has been so
busy acquiring new theaters that he has
not played at his home theater, the Al
cazar, for a year and a half. And he
passes up the romantic hero for the com
edy part —proving that he can do funny
roles as well as straight ones. We hope
he will be able to appear in San Fran
cisco oftener.
Stellar honors go to Dale Winter (Mrs.
Duffy). She succeeds in making the ca
pricious heroine a real person, and this
quality of reality is what makes her so
perennially popular. Smiling most of the
time, Miss Winter is beautiful enough for
anyone to fall in love with, and further
more she puts over some excellent act
ing. We like her better than any of the |
women stars Mr. Duffy has acting for \
him.
Alice Buchanana, praise be, is among |
those present. Her distinctive personal- j
ity attracts us greatly. Sometime we
would like to sec her in the leading part 1
of one of the Alcazar shows.
Ralph Kellard, as the quiet young en
gineer who unwittingly wins the fair ■
Ann, is well chosen for his role. He is I
new to us, and registers one hundred per j
ccnt in the romantic scenes.
"In Love With Love" has been staged 1
with finesse, and you will find it a spark- '
ling, gay, frivolous comedy. It is the
Duffys at their best—and you know how
good that is.
OTHER PLAYS
"Good News" has only one more week i

after this to run at the Curran. It's
collegiatc—what more can you ask of
any musical comedy ? Very good.
"The Squall" opened last night at the
Geary. Hot stuff—to be reviewed later.
"Kongo" continues to shock those who
wander into the New Capitol. Native
melodrama — shocking conversation and
poor morals featured.
"Daddies" is in its eighth week at
Duffy's President. Robert McWade is
the star of this funny show.
"Happy Days" has just re-opened the
Columbia Theater. Stars Max Dill, May
Boley, and Richard Carle.
"Easy for Zee Zee" is still drawing
the sophisticates to the Green Street The
ater. And A 1 Jolson's second Vitaphone
picture, "The Singing Fool," is all settled
for tremendous business at the Embassy.

Casper Hauser. By Jacob Wasser
mann. Translated by Caroline New
ton. (New York: Horace Liveright,
1928.)
He stumbled into Nuremberg a hun
dred years ago, a strange unkempt youth
of about seventeen. He walked as though
he had just learned how; he babbled in
coherently, knowing no more language
than a two-year-old. A letter he carried
bore the name Caspar Hauser.
Caspar Hauser had a keen mind and
the freatures of an aristocrat. Of his life
before the day he appeared in Nuremberg
lie knew nothing. He had vague mem
ories of a lighlless dungeon, and a man
who brought him fresh bread and water.
The story of this odd person is today
a mystery still. The facts of the case
are historical. Many believe that he was ;
the Crown Prince of Baden who had
been put out of the way in a castle and
later let loose in a large city in the hope
he would disappear.
