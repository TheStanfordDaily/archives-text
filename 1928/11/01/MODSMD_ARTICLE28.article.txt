# N.Y. SHEEP RUSTLERS
## 
### 
One of the temptations from which,
it might be supposed, New Yorkers
should feel perfectly safe is the urge
to steal sheep. Yet last week one of
the 6,017,000 made oft' with one of the
GO sheep in the Central Park flock.
Stuffed under his coat, the creature
was taken to his apartment. There it
baaed so dismally and persistently
that the neighbors were roused. The
police were called, and when they ran
down the bleating noise, they found
the miscreant, a Mexican counterman,
trying to force the sheep to have a
breakfast of milk. â€”New York Times.
