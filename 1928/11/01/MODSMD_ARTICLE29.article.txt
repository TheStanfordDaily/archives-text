# MARGERY BAILEY GETS PRAISE FOR BOSWELL EDITION
## 
### 
Hearty approval of the work of Dr.
Margery Bailey as editor and Stan
ford University Press as publishers
of James Boswell's "The Hypochon
driack" is expressed by critics both
in the United States and in England,
from review clippings received by the
Press.
The book, which engaged Dr. Bailey
for more than six years and was two
years in the making at the Press, was
published last summer.
Praise for Dr. Bailey's careful and
scholarly editing of the seventy es
says which make up the volumes is
unanimous among the critics. Fred
erick A. Pottle, writing in the Satur
day Review of Literature, says in
part:
Prefaces Original
"Dr. Bailey's editing is leisurely and
ample, after the manner of Dr. Hill's
annotation of the Life of Johnson. I
believe one may risk the high praise
of saying that . . . her percentage of
error is nearly as small as in Hill
himself. The most difficult part of the
editing—the identification of the
sources of Boswell's mottoes, and the
running to earth of the many obscure
Latin, French, Dutch, and Italian au
thors from whom he quotes —she has
clone to perfection. Her prefaces seem
to me highly original, and yet among
the sanest and soundest critical es
says on Boawell ever written. The
tone of her remarks on her author is
almost invariably exactly right."
The essays themselves (the Stan
ford edition is the first reprint ever
made of them) are commended both
for their readability and for the new
light they shed on the character of
their author, whose claim to fame
heretofore has rested on his Life of
Johnson.
Press Work Is Fine
The work of the Press has its share
of praise, according to George Saints
bury in the Dial, in reference to the
volumes as "faultless in print and
paper. The binding in black and sil
ver," he says, "suits the subject, is
agreeable in itself, and brings out the
Boswell arms and motto in an admir
able fashion."
