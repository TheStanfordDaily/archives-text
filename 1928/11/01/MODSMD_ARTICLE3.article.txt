# INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROOTERS' STUNTS GIVEN
## Jacobson Urges Co-operation With Leaders in U.S.C. Rooting Section 
### 
Due to the fact that the stunts for
the U.S.C. game promise to be the
most complicated that have as yet
been attempted by a Stanford rooting
eection, the Rally Committee is adopt
ing a new policy for this game, and
printing the stunt instructions in ad
vance of the game. This will enable
every student who expects to be in
llie rooting sectiou in Los Angeles to
become acquainted with the general
nature of the changes before enwrap
ping himself in the actualities of the
game. It is urged that every rooter
will read these carefully and endeavor
to remember them.
Stunt No. I—
For the purposes of this stunt the
section is divided into section X and
section Y. Those students who have
colors marked on their card for the
particular division of stunt number I
that the yell leaders call for (this will
be designated by some letter, between
A and J) will use that color in the
stunt. Those who have no color
marked on the card will take the
color that the yell-leader designates
for that section (i.e., Section X or Y).
Each section may be working on a dif
ferent letter, so it will be necessary
for each rooter to pay close attention
to the instructions of the yell-leader.
Stunt No. ll—
This stunt is divided into two parts.
A copy of the instruction card is
printed in this paper, and by consult
ing it students will clearly see the
idea of the first two changes (Nos.
2 and 3). If a change is indicated on
this stunt it will say that on a cer
tain letter (a to k) the color should
be changed to that marked in on
the card in pen. The yell-leader will
go through the alphabet from A to K
slowly, and it is essential that each
student be prepared to change his
card as his letter is called, if there
is any change marked for his seat.
Stunt No. Ill—
On changing from change 4 to
change 5, every student whose color
remains the same will keep his cards
in place. Those who have a change
between these two stunts will change
at a signal from the yell-leader, but
without ducking their cards on their
heads while changing. This is done
purposely to give a temporary effect
of confusion. BUT —between changes
5 and 6 it is imperative that everyone
b i prepared to make a change imme*
diately on the signal, and in perfect
order, to give the impression of the
horse actually rocking. If there is
•'time the yell-leader will then change
back and forth from 5 to 6 several
times, and each change must be ac
complished with complete precision.
Stunt No. IV—
This is the final stunt, the block S
and fir tree. There will be no change
here.
As stated before, the stunts are
complicated, and the co-operation of
everyone is needed to make them a
.success. And let us remind the stu
dents that where no color is marked
on the card for a particular stunt (ex
cept stunt I) they should hold up a
white card.

ping himself in the actualities of the
game. It is urged that every rooter
will read these carefully and endeavor
to remember them.
Stunt No. I—
For the purposes of this stunt the
section is divided into section X and
section Y. Those students who have
colors marked on their card for the
particular division of stunt number I
that the yell leaders call for (this will
be designated by some letter, between
A and J) will use that color in the
stunt. Those who have no color
marked on the card will take the
color that the yell-leader designates
for that section (i.e., Section X or Y).
Each section may be working on a dif
ferent letter, so it will be necessary
for each rooter to pay close attention
to the instructions of the yell-leader.
Stunt No. ll—
This stunt is divided into two parts.
A copy of the instruction card is
printed in this paper, and by consult
ing it students will clearly see the
idea of the first two changes (Nos.
2 and 3). If a change is indicated on
this stunt it will say that on a cer
tain letter (a to k) the color should
be changed to that marked in on
the card in pen. The yell-leader will
go through the alphabet from A to K
slowly, and it is essential that each
student be prepared to change his
card as his letter is called, if there
is any change marked for his seat.
Stunt No. Ill—
On changing from change 4 to
change 5, every student whose color
remains the same will keep his cards
in place. Those who have a change
between these two stunts will change
at a signal from the yell-leader, but
without ducking their cards on their
heads while changing. This is done
purposely to give a temporary effect
of confusion. BUT —between changes
5 and 6 it is imperative that everyone
b i prepared to make a change imme*
diately on the signal, and in perfect
order, to give the impression of the
horse actually rocking. If there is
•'time the yell-leader will then change
back and forth from 5 to 6 several
times, and each change must be ac
complished with complete precision.
Stunt No. IV—
This is the final stunt, the block S
and fir tree. There will be no change
here.
As stated before, the stunts are
complicated, and the co-operation of
everyone is needed to make them a
.success. And let us remind the stu
dents that where no color is marked
on the card for a particular stunt (ex
cept stunt I) they should hold up a
white card.

Due to the fact that the stunts for
the U.S.C. game promise to be the
most complicated that have as yet
been attempted by a Stanford rooting
eection, the Rally Committee is adopt
ing a new policy for this game, and
printing the stunt instructions in ad
vance of the game. This will enable
every student who expects to be in
llie rooting sectiou in Los Angeles to
become acquainted with the general
nature of the changes before enwrap
ping himself in the actualities of the
game. It is urged that every rooter
