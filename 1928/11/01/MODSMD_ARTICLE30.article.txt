# SCHOOLS INVITED TO HELP HOOVER'S CAMPUS WELCOME
## 
### 
Invitations have been issued to all
military academies and high schools
and some of the grammar schools in
the vicinity of Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
and Redwood City to attend the
Hoover reception on the campus Mon
day. These schools, sixteen in all, will
line Palm Drive from the decorated
gates to the Quad, along which the
parade is scheduled to pass.
Space in front and on the side of
the railway station is being reserved
for welcome by Stanford students.
The station and avenue as far as
Palm Drive will be decorated, and a
ppecial yell-leaders' platform is being
erected.
If tentative arrangements by Leon
Levi, in charge of the reception, are
carried out, the presidential nominee
will be greeted with a demonstration
by Stanford students as his train ar
rives about 1:30 o'clock, and the
parade will form at the station,
headed by the Stanford Band, to
march from the train up Palm Drive
to the Postoffice, along an avenue
lined with thousands of school chil
dren. Further plans will be made over
the week-end by Levi, with the aid
of Rally Committee members who are
not going to the U.S.C. game.
