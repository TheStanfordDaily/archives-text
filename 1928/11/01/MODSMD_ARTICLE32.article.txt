# RADICAL CHANGES ON CAMPUS SINCE HALF DECADE AGO
## 
### 
Although five years ago Stanford went j
through a period of rapid growth and j
expansion during the summer, and re
turning students in the autumn of 1923
looked about amazed, not one word has
been uttered to mark the fifth anniversary
of some more or less epoch-making
changes. President Wilbur in his recent
address stated that it was his function
to look constantly to the future, and it
seems that the entire University is fol
lowing his example and neglecting the
historic past.
Toyon Hall, the secret envy of the
Row, housed its first inhabitants amid
scaffolding, cursing plasterers, and paint
buckets five years ago this quarter. While
the first complaint concerning the food
at Encina Commons probably came from
a disgruntled frosh on the morning of
Thursday, October 4, 1923. The Com
mons opened that morning.
Institutions which live only in Stan
ford tradition passed into history during
that eventful summer. "Sticky" Wilson's
counter, to which the nickels and dimes
of many a hoary alumnus stuck, was
moved off the campus along with the
fixtures of Greene's Cigar store and
Meyer's store in Encina. The Stanford
Union pioneered in the operation of chain
stores and the "small one and coffee"
business was under way at the Union and
Encina Stores under the supervision of
the administration.
"Sticky's" and Greene's were housed
in the building that is now occupied by
the Y.M.C.A., while the "Y" moved out
to make room for the Union store. The
Cafeteria was moved from where the
Cellar now is into its present location.
And by the way, the Cellar is still an
other of the new institutions of 1923.
Since its establishment, social life on the
campus has been revolutionized by the
injection of afternoon teas and tete-a
tetes into its composition, much to the
disgust of the venerable Stanford rough.
Down from the Union dining room and
into club rooms in the new Commons
moved the eating clubs. It seems that
the only thing which was not turned
around was the Quad and that probably
proved to be a little clumsy to be moved
easily.
Student Body offices were located in
the Administration building until the rev
olution of 1923 when they were moved
to the Old Union. These are only a few
of the changes made half a decade ago
during the summer of 1923 when the
campus cchoed with the activity of build
ing and Old Grads stood about with tears
in their eyes as well-loved haunts faded
into history.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia received a gift of $100,000 from
Harry J. Bauer, Los Angeles attorney
and graduate of the class of 1909;
the money will be used for the en
dowment of the law school, where he 1
received his legal instruction.
