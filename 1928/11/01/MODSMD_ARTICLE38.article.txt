Yale and Dartmouth cannot take un

for their clash but that will remove
little, if any, of the usual interest.
The dispute between Cornell and
Columbia has the so-called experts
running around in circles trying to
pick a winner. Cornell put up a gal

by a field goal. Columbia was beaten
by Dartmouth but has shown strength

against the other opponents.
Syracuse undoubtedly will be a
slight favorite over Pitt at Pittsburgh
but the Panthers have a formidable
team that West Virginia could beat
by no more than three points and
Carnegie Tech by six. Syracuse's lone
defeat was a one-point heart breaker
by the powerful Nebraska squad.
