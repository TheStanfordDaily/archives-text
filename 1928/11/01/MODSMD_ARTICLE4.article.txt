# HUNT TO CHANGE BACKS IN U.S.C. GAME SATURDAY
## 
### 
With the probability that Dusty Allen,
regular freshman fullback, will be un
able to start the game with the Uni
versity of Southern California year
lings next Saturday, Coach Husky Hunt
is again faced with the necessity of us
ing a rearranged backfield. Last week it
was Rintala who was out, and this week
it is Allen. Cadell, who has been shifted
from fullback to halfback, vice versa,
and back again so many times this year
that he has become general handy man
in the backfield, will play in Allen's po
sition.
Ebey, guard and tackle who has been

in the hospital for several days with a
bad case of poison oak, will be ready
for practice this afternoon, it was re
ported yesterday. Ebey, who has been
a substitute tackle most of the season,
was started at right guard in place of
Toepke last Saturday against the South
ern All-Stars and will probably begin
the U.S.C. game.
Hunt's reserves have been improving
in practice, and he now has good sub
stitutes for every position. In the end
positions particularly is there an am
plitude of material. Lewis, Kellcy, and
Simpson are all fast ends and are mak
ing Colvin and Toll work to hold down
their first string berths. Grey and Doub
are fairly sure of their positions, but
among the guards there is plenty of
competition. Ebey and Toepke are con
testing for the left guard berth, with
Hunt and Brooks on the other side.
Ebey has a twenty-pound weight advan
tage over Toepke, but the other's play
has been such that he'll be sure to get
into the Trojan game.
Of the Trobabes (that's what they
call themselves) Ernie Pinckert, quar
terback, and Jurich and Joslin, ends, are
the men to watch, according to Chuck
Winterburn, who scouted the California-
U.S.C. freshman tie game last Saturday.
