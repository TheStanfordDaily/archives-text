# HOOVER MAY WIN 280 ELECTORAL VOTES TO SMITH'S 251, DECLARES ROBINSON
## Stanford Professor Studies Results by Counties of Past Elections and Makes Prediction as to Outcome Of Present Campaign 
### 
That Hoover will receive 280 electoral votes and Smith 251 is the prediction
made by Professor Edgar E. Robinson of the history department in an article sur
veying the results of past presidential elections and prognosticating the results of
the present one. Professor Robinson takes cognizance in his article, which is to be
syndicated during the next few days for publication throughout the country, of
the rule that there is regularity of voting in presidential elections, and asserts that
this regularity is a guide to the probability of distribution next Tuesday. Three
times during the past eight elections (since 1896) a campaign was fought which
saw a great breaking of party lines—in 1896, in 1912, and in 1916—and yet, despite
the shifts among leaders and in certain areas, the main outlines of the distribution
of the popular vote were the same.
Consider, says Professor Robinson, the battlefield as a whole.
A- What does an examination of this distribution reveal?
1. That there are eighteen states in which the presidential contest has not been
, and cannot be won. Why? Because the vote for one or the other of the
parties is regularly so large as to preclude a victory for its oldtime oppo
nent. What an independent candidate might do is beside the point. Conse
quently, these states are not fighting ground in any real sense of the word.
2. There are thirty states in which either the margin has been small or shifts
from one party to the other have occurred. Here the fight is real. Why?
Because, to win electoral votes, a state must be carried by a popular vote.
(California may be taken from this group in this particular campaign.)
3. Looking at the popular votes of these states as a whole over this period, the
variation in this popular vote appears to be very great. But look closer and
discern the voting units within each of the states, that is, the county units,
and election after election the regularity of Republican or Democratic votes
is amazing.
4. Now in these county units and within each of these, the voting precincts, the
fight is hot, and the election is to be won or lost.
B. For the nation as a whole (48 states), there were, in 1924, 1570 counties carried
by Coolidge, 1283 by Davis, and 221 by LaFollette. But observe that Coolidge
had a majority in only 1239 and Davis, in only 1199. And LaFollette, in spite
of the fact that he polled nearly five million votes, had a majority in only 131.
One may note that
1. Davis ran third in nearly 25 per cent of the counties.
2. In twelve states LaFollette led Davis.
3. In six of these twelve their combined vote was greater than that for Coo
lidge. (Idaho, North. Dakota, Nevada, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Montana.)
4. In nine others this was also true. (Kentucky, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah,
West Virginia, Arizona, Missouri, Maryland, Oklahoma.)
5. There is a striking concentration of a LaFollette second vote strength in the
Pittsburg, Cleveland, and Detroit areas.
C. For example, consider the situation in Missouri. In 1924 Coolidge carried 67
counties and Davis, 48 counties. The LaFollette candidacy was weak, not carry
ing any counties and not even achieving second place in any county. Consider
Missouri for the whole period. Twenty-five counties have invariably voted
Democratic. Its inhabitants felt that way. There appears to be good local or
ganization and the vote, election after election, does not vary. One of these
counties, Shannon, will cast less than 1600 votes this year. Missouri as a whole
will poll a million and a half. The small aid from Shannon County, even in
the event of a local victory, is obvious. But Jackson County will cast more
than a hundred thousand votes. Victory here means much for a state victory.
In Missouri, as in every state in which a state majority may be won or lost,
each party will concentrate its strength in populous counties. A local victory in
every county is desirable from the point of view of organization, but to win
the state the fight is concentrated in certain areas.
Thus, we conclude that, as the worth while fight is to be made only in certain
states and in these states most of all in certain areas, attention to the proba
bilities in these areas will give us a clue as to the probable outcome in the state
and in the nation.
It. Where are they? Because of the regularity of from thirty to forty percent of
the vote and the unusual condition known to exist in particular areas this fall,
it is believed that the victory will be won with the closest vote in the following
states. Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and
Wisconsin.
F. Also that the following are to witness an exciting finish: Connecticut, Mary
land, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oklahoma.
G. In the registration figures recently announced we have an expected vote of
43,000,000 for the nation (this is doubtless an overestimate because in a number
of cases it is based upon estimates made rather than upon actual registration
figures compiled). It is noticeable that six of the states will cast more than
2,000,000 votes each and together carry more than a third of the total vote of
the nation. These states, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan,
and California, are normally Republican states. A victory for the Democratic
party in these states, or in half of them, would indicate the transformation in
character which has been evident in the strategy of the Democratic
organization in the present campaign. Democratic victory would open a new
era in Democratic party history.
H. As it stands today, six days before election, it would seem, on the basis of the
material here considered, that the electoral result will be 280 for Mr. Hoover
and 251 for Mr. Smith.
Following is a tabulation of the vote in New York and Ohio, two of the most
populous states in which the contest is likely to be close:
