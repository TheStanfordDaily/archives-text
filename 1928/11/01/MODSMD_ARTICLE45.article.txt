# SOUSA'S CAMPUS CONCERT MARKS 36TH BAND TOUR
## 
### 
For a majority of Stanford students
who will attend Sousa's concert next
Tuesday night it will be the second,
if not the third, time that they have
heard the "March King" conduct his
famous compositions. Lieutenant Com
mander John Philip Sousa is seventy
four years old, and first took up the
baton fifty years ago in a theatre in
Washington, D.C. He has made thirty
six tours with his band, which is the
reason for the number who have al
ready heard him.
When a boy Sousa wanted to learn
music. His father played the slide
trombone in a martial band that
marched down Pennsylvania Avenue
in 1865, after four years of service for
the North in the Civil War. "Johnny"
began to study the violin under a very
temperamental teacher, who during a
lesson one day, became angry and
flew into a rage. It subsided, but
Sousa has since had a dislike for the
"artistic temperament."
After Sousa had been head of the
United States Marine Band for 12
years, he formed his own organiza
tion which has continued over four
decades. Since his last tour Sousa
has composed two marches dedicated
to the University of Nebraska, has
written a new movement for his
suite, "Tales of a Traveler," has
transcribed the latest musical comedy
hits into a sketch, "Ten Minutes on
Broadway," and has written a humor
esque on "Among My Souvenirs." -
Besides the many marches for
which Sousa is famous, he has com
posed ten operas, many waltzes,
songs, dances, cantatas, and sym
phonic poems.
Sousa will appear in two concerts
on the campus Tuesday, one in the
afternoon for school children of Palo
Alto and vicinity, and the other in
the evening open to those owning
A.S.S.U. Concert Series tickets, which
are still on sale at the Old Union.
