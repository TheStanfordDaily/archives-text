"U.S.C. hopes to have a real sta
dium of its own ready for the Stan
ford-Trojan game in 1930," said Rob
ert Behlow, president of the Associ
ated Students at U.S.C., in an inter
view after the good-will assembly yes
terday. U.S.C.'s student body is pri
marily interested, outside of football
season, in a tremendous building pro
gram which it is putting across, ac
cording to Behlow.
Last year an Associated Students
Union Building was built from foot
ball receipts, and this year a library
and a gymnasium are under construc
tion, the former being financed en
tirely by student donations, and the
latter by donations from alumni and
students together. A stadium as large
if not larger than the Coliseum in Los
Angeles is on the construction pro
gram for next year.
When asked what he thought of the
Honor System, Behlow replied: "I
knew very little about it. We have
never given it serious consideration
at U.S.C., because most of the stu
dents live in the city, and leave the
campus as soon as classes are over,
thus not having the close contact
wi£h other students which we feel is
necessary where the Honor System
is in use."
