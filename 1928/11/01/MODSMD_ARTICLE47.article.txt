### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The Trojans* Leader

Jess Hibbs, captain of the powerful
University of Southern California eleven,
earned nation-wide recognition last sea
son as an All-American tackle, but this
year, due to a strained back, was unable
to play at his best against the Oregon
Aggies and was kept out of the game
against St. Mary's College.
I saw "Big Jess" in action in four
games last year, and he impressed me
very much by his play against Stanford
and Notre Dame. It was he who paved
the way for many of Morley Drury's
sensational runs, and on the defense, es
pecially in the Stanford game, he was
a whole team in himself. I remember
vividly the way he came bouncing through

the line to break up Pop Warner's pet
reverse plays. Jess showed much football
sense, the keen football insight that iden
tifies a real linesman.
Hibbs does the punting for the Trojans,
and is known as one of the best pigskin
booters on the coast. To gain All-Ameri
can recognition, Hibbs had to compete
with such giants as Lassman, of New
York University; Raskowski, of Ohio
State; Hake and Smith, of Penn.;
Sprague and Perry, of the Army; Kern,
of Pittsburgh; and Sprott, of Texas A.
and M.
Jess is the movie-hero type of warrior
—handsome, magnetic, weighs over 200,
and is fast, and, one might say, rough
and ready.
