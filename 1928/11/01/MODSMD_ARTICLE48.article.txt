# BEARS PRACTICE HARD; STRENGTHEN OFFENSIVE
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 31. (£>)—'Two
more days of practice still remain for
the University of California varsity
grid squad before they clash with the
University of Oregon here Saturday
in a conference engagement.
The Bears went through a hard
scrimmage yesterday, in which of
fense was the keynote. The first and
second elevens alternated in opposing
the third string, but were not very
successful in ripping off gains. It is
likely that Coach "Nibs" Price will
depend on a strong defense and a
few "breaks," to give the Bears vic
tory Saturday.
