# MOTOR COPS TO SEEK ORANGE GROVE FROST

### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30. (&)
Mounted "policemen" who will speed
their motorcycles through the orch
ard-growing sections of southern
California at night, seeking frost, not
criminals, will unite this year with
the telephone and radio to battle the
citrus belt's worst enemy.
Plans for the drive against the frost
danger were announced today by
Floyd D. Young, government meteor
ologist in charge of the frost forecast
service for southern California at
Pomona.
Taking every precaution against an
early advance of frost, Young said
that a nightly radio broadcast service
would be established beginning with
November to advise growers of prob
able low temperatures.
