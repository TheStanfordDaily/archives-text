"The Dudley herbarium now containing
approximately 250,000 specimens is one
of the largest collections in the West,"
stated Professor I-e√üoy Abrams, who is
now in charge of the herbarium.
"The beginning of the collections ante
dates the opening of Stanford Univer
sity. David Seccor, a friend of the Stan
lords, presented the University with the
herbarium of Professor William H. Har
vey of Trinity College, Dublin. This col
lection contains over 75,(XX) specimens
and is especially rich in old world ma
terial. Most of these specimens were
collected in the first half of the nine
teenth century and a few in the late
eighteenth century.
"Professor William Russell Dudley, in
whose honor the herbarium is named,
came here in 1892 as professor of system
atic botany. He began building up a col
lection of California and western plants.
At the time of his retirement in 1910 he
presented his private collections consist
ing of 60,000 specimens to the University.
"Students and members of the herbari
um staff are adding to the collection each
year. During the last academic year
about 12,000 specimens were obtained,
many of which were gathered in these
botanical trips.
"President Wilbur was anxious that
these valuable scientific collections should
be carefully guarded. About three years
ago he caused them to be moved from
the various laboratories, and had them
housed in the museum building where
they are protected from fire risks. Ade
quate facilities have been provided for
the study of the collection by students
and faculty."'
