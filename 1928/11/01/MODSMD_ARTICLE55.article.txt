### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 31 (jP)—An effort to
quell talk on the University of Washing
ton campus suggesting the ousting of
Enoch Bagshaw, head football coach,
caused by the poor showing of the Husky
grid team tiiis year, was made today by
Smith Troy, president of the Associated
Students.
"This is no time to talk change of
coaches," said Troy. "That should be
done after the last game of the season
with Washington State College. No mat
ter where students, alumni, or fans stand
regarding the football situation, we can't
do anything with it until the season is
over, and it should be let alone until
then.
"What the sentiment of the campus is,
what the sentiment of down town alumni
and fans is, regarding Bagshaw, as our
coach, we should give our full loyalty to
the university until the football season
is over. Changing horses in mid-stream
is poor business."
For several uVeks there has been a
growing sentiment in down town Seattle
that changes in the coaching staff should
lie made. This sentiment seemed to come
to a climax after the Huskies lost two
consecutive games to Oregon State Col
lege and the University of Oregon.
No definite action has been taken by
the alumni of the institution. Bagshaw
holds a contract to coach Washington
football teams for three more years. He
took over the coaching reins in 1921.
