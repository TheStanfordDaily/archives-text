# LARGE CAST, TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES FACE DAVIS, HELVENSTON IN COMEDY
## 
### 
"The Devil in the Cheese," the Sword
and Sandals play which is to he pre
sented in the Assembly Hall a week
from Friday night, is one of the most
difficult plays that have been attempted
on the Stanford stage.
Gordon Davis is faced with an unusu
ally large cast in this romantic fantasy as
there are forty-five regular characters
in it. The large scenes of the shepherds,
the monks, the patriotic ballyhoo, and
the final climax of the comedy where
the monks are revealed in their true
color, are extremely hard to handle.
In order to give the members of his
class in directing some practical experi
ence, Gordon Davis will appoint assist
ants to help him produce the plays dur
ing the year. For "The Devil in the
Cheese" Davis has selected Kathleen
Fitz and Bradley Pischel. These stu
dents are now helping the director in
handling the monks and shepherds.
From a technical standpoint, the play
is extremely difficult to handle. In the
first act there is a windfass which hauls

1 the members of Quigley's party to the
top of the mountain. This involves the
i building of an elevator on the stage in
order that the characters may come ap
parently from the earth below.
The construction of the gate of the
; monastery is also a very difficult thing
for the stage crew, and the Stanford
production of the play is to have a real
gate. There is also some magic in the
; play which causes the Little God Min,
, played by Paul Speegle, to emerge from
an amphora. The amphora is an exact
replica in size of the real Grecian am
phoras.
Technically, the bringing into the vis
ion of the audience of the vague and
indistinct thoughts in the mind of Gol
dina is a problem in the lighting of the
stage sets. From a dull blur, Goldina's
mind crystallizes into clear and distinct
thoughts, and the properties which Gol
dina visualizes in her mind are brought
out of the darkness by lighting effects.
Tickets for "The Devil in the Cheese"
are now on sale in the Old Union.
