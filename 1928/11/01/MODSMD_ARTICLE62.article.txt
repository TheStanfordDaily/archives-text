Herbert Hoover and the Trojan-Card
football game are running about neck
and neck these days in interesting natives
down on the Farm. In fact, Stanford's
favorite son is at present getting the
small end of the bargain, if campus gos
sip is to be considered a proper criterion.
There are about four topics of conver
sation just now among Sons of the Stan
ford Red—football, U.S.C., Cards, and
football. As November 3 approaches
these topics are hashed over with increas
ing gusto.
Thursday the general exodus be- i
gins. Stanford will invade Southern
California practically en masse.
Every fan who can possibly make
the grade will be on hand to wax
enthusiastic at the Cardinal victory
which seems forthcoming.
And as the days pass that victory seems
more and more likely to materialize. For
the first time in recent years odds are
really quoted for the Warnermen. If
we were superstitious that might loom as
a bad sign. Always before Stanford has
fought the Trojan warriors as the under
dog—and won.
Now the tables are turned and
that psychological advantage
(doubtful as it may be) is on the
side of Troy. There is also a psy
chological advantage, of course, in
having the upper hand, and it is for
the Cards this year. In the past
that wasn't enough to win for
We shall see, Saturday,
just which is the most valuable.
In any event it will be a high-powered,
twelve cylinder, double-distilled football
game, that is to greet the thousands who !
pack the white pillared Los Angeles Col- j
iseum. It should be a contest worth
traveling 500 miles to see, no matter I
which faction grabs off the biggest score.
If this column were run by Doro
thy Dix or Elsie Robinson it would
be appropriate to warn the ingenu- i
ous Stanfordites who hie to the |
Southland that all is not gold that
glitters or something to that effect.
Suffice to say .however, that gaso
line and alcohol do not mix, and i
that the curves on the Ridge Route i
are difficult to negotiate at a speed
greater than forty-five miles per
hour.
