# STANFORD, U.C. ARE MEMBERS OF GERMAN EXCHANGE

"California and Stanford are the only
two western universities belonging to the
American German Student Exchange at
present," according to Dr. William Alpha
Cooper, head of the German Department
of Stanford University.
"The Exchange is for the purpose of
promoting international understanding
and friendship, vital needs of the world.
It was inaugurated by Germany, who of
fered 25 fellowships to American stu
dents. Eastern American universities
soon followed suit; later the middle west
ern colleges offered fellowships and now
U.C. and Stanford have taken up the
idea. The Stanford fellowship was of
fered for the second time this year and
is raised largely by public spirited San
Francisco men.
"There are 35 German students holding
Exchange fellowships in the United
States this year. These students are se
lected on a basis of personality and schol
arship by a national committee of uni
versity professors with its headquarters
in Berlin, the Akademischer Austausch
dienst. In return the Institute of Inter
national Education in New York chooses
30 American students from all over the
United States to go to Germany as Ex
change fellows.
"The holder of the Stanford fellow
ship this year is Karl Heinz PfefTer of
Frankfurt-am-Main. PfefTer has had
three years of training in German uni
versities, being last at Berlin."
In concluding Dr. Cooper says, "Only
students who are a pride to their country
and will be an asset to the university
where they are going are chosen for
American German Student Exchange fel
lowships. Thus the purpose of interna
tional goodwill is made even more ef
fective. Stanford has done a good work
in offering an Exchange fellowship."
