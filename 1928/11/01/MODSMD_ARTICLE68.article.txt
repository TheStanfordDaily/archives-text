# "LET THERE BE LIGHT"
## Library Has Union Hours MORE POWER TO THEM 
### 
"Why I haven't got my lesson" or "The
light that failed" might well be the title
of many an alibi that will be used this
morning to protect the innocent student
from the condemning criticism of dis
approving professors. And for once the
alibi will be more or less justified. The
library .that unfailing citadel of learn
ing, the certain stronghold of future Phi-
Betes, the last-minute hope of many a
desperate student, was forced to close its
doors to even the most zealous scholars
last night.
The educational labors of the early am
bitious were interrupted at 7:30 by dark
ness which enveloped them at their posts.
Time went by and even well-voiced hol
lering for lights and cat-calls failed to
bring the required illumination. Finally,
the library officials decided to close up
when 8:15 arrived and the report came
in that there was a break in the power
line somewhere between the library and
the sub-station. All the students who
still persevered in spite of the darkness
were summarily ordered out but were
promised that if the lights came on be
fore 9 o'clock the library would reopen,
and not only reopen, but would stay open
one hour later than usual or until 11
o'clock.
Just as the last hopes of the students
who had stuck it out were fading and it
looked like nine o'clock would come
shrouded in darkness the lights came on
with still five minutes to go till the dead
line. The damage in the high-tension
line had been repaired by an active elec
trician but, due to the fact that, by this
time, those who remained to peruse the
musty volumes in search of learning were
few and far between, the library closed
at the regular time.
