# HOOVER WINS AID IN PAN-AMERICAN RELATIONS-BORAH
## 
### 
BALTIMORE, Oct. 31 (/P). â€”If Her
bert Hoover is elected president, Senator
William E. Borah of Idaho, in a speech
; here tonight predicted that "a new era"
would be established in the relations be
tween the United States and the Central
American nations.
Replying to the criticisms of Governor
Smith in his Baltimore speech of the
Central American policy of the Coolidge
! administration and the Republican party,
I
j the Idahoan said that his party's presi
j dential nominee "was pledged to the pol
icy of peaceful settlement of controver
sies between this country and Central
American nations as set forth in the
platform adopted by the Kansas City
convention." The senator spoke over a
nation-wide radio hookup from the same
platform where the Democratic candi
date delivered his campaign address last
Monday.
"A better understanding already has
! been established," declared Mr. Borah,
! who is chairman of the powerful Senate
! Foreign Relations Committee and has
j consistently opposed this country's inter
i vention in Central America. "Ambassa
| dor Morrow has done nothing less than
| a marvelous piece of work with reference
!to Mexico. In my opinion a similar pol
i icy and a similar program would avail
S just as effectually with reference to Ccn-
I tral American countries.
"We want peace with these countries,"
| lie continued. "We do not and should not
j invade their territory. I am one of those
! who believe that any controversy which
i may arise between ourselves and these
! smaller countries can be settled by pa-
J cific means and with due respect to their
sovereignty and their sovereign rights."
