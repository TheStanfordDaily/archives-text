# HALLOWE'EN IS EXCUSE FOR FRESHMAN PRANKS
## 
### 
With a shower of pyrotechnics, one
Halowe'en prank early last night re
sulted in partial disruption of Stanford's
telephone service, and complete cessa
tion of service on the Peninsular Rail
way's local line.
A person or persons unknown pulled
the trolley from the overhead wire as
the car stopped at Encina Hall. The
motorman attempted to replace the trol
ley, whereupon the trolley was released
at the other end, with its rope cut. This
flashed up against the telephone cable.
Hissing sparks and flame shot up.
Sparks began to fall from many poles
along the line. Soon the trolley wire was
down, and set fire to the surrounding
grass. But the timely arrival of the tire
department prevented further serious
damage.
