Pipe Tobacco
Maiden, Mass.
Lams & Rro. Co. March 10, 1928
Richmond, Va.
Dear Sirs:
I have been a Master Mariner for
many years, and as a general rule all
seafaring men smoke a pipe. I have
tried about all the different brands of
tobacco on the market, and in my esti
mation, there is not one make of to
bacco that will compare with Edge
worth Slice for a good, cool, long smoke.
Sailors would come to me and say
"Capt., be sure to put in a good sup
ply of Edgeworth when you fill up the
canteen." That speaks for what the
average sailor thinks of Edgeworth.
I retired from the sea six years ago,
and the largest grocery dealers in
Boston keep me supplied with this
wonderful smoke. I take great pleasure
in boosting it to my friends.
Very truly yours,
