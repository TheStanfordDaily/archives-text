# TROJANS BATTLE CARDINAL FROSH HERE TOMORROW
## Coach Hunt's Eleven Enters Game as Underdogs With Two Stars Out of Lineup Rivals Undefeated in Games Played This Season; Each Is Tied in One Grid Tilt 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
With two regulars—Dusty Allen,
fullback; and Ebey, guard—definitely
confined to the bench by injury or
sickness, Coach Husky Hunt's fresh
man eleven will enter the game with
(lie University of Southern California
freshmen tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
o'clock in the Stadium somewhat the
under dog. Allen is still nursing a
bad ankle, and Ebey is in the Palo
Alto Hospital with a severe case of
poison oak.
Though both teams have gone
through the season undefeated, a tie
game has been chalked up on the
record of each. The Stanford year
lings were tied 6 to 6 by the Army in
their first game of the year and the
Trojan frosli, 0 to 0, by the California
freshmen last week.
S.C. Has Weight
The Southern California team will
have the advantage of weight and re
serves; but, barring injuries, the
Curds will give them more than
enough competition. The Army was
the only team to score on the Stan
ford first-year men, and against their
six opponents the Cards have amassed
a total of 175 points. The S.C. fresh
men have not been scored on.
A fast backfield and a strong line
will start against the visitors. Cadell,
playing in place of Allen at fullback,
is the speediest man on the Stanford
squad and should give onlookers an
eyeful tomorrow. Rudy Rintala will
once more be in the lineup at left
halfback, and should bolster up the
freshman backfield considerably. He
is a shifty open-field runner and has
been the big ground-gainer of the
year for the freshmen.
Lineup Announced
Hunt and Bradshaw put their men
through a light scrimmage yesterday
with the third string carrying the ball
and using U.S.C. formations and plays.

ford first-year men, and against their
six opponents the Cards have amassed
a total of 175 points. The S.C. fresh
men have not been scored on.
A fast backfield and a strong line
will start against the visitors. Cadell,
playing in place of Allen at fullback,
is the speediest man on the Stanford
squad and should give onlookers an
eyeful tomorrow. Rudy Rintala will
once more be in the lineup at left
halfback, and should bolster up the
freshman backfield considerably. He
is a shifty open-field runner and has
been the big ground-gainer of the
year for the freshmen.
Lineup Announced
Hunt and Bradshaw put their men
through a light scrimmage yesterday
with the third string carrying the ball
and using U.S.C. formations and plays.
The starting lineups will be as fol
lows:
Stanford — U.S.C. —
Colvin LER Joslin
Grey LTR Hall
Hunt LGR Snyder
Milligan C Williamson
Brooks RGL Baker
Dcub RTL Mason
Toll REL Jurich
Marks Q Pinckert
Rintala LHR Stephens
Wilson RHL Mallory
Cadell F Musick
With two regulars—Dusty Allen,
fullback; and Ebey, guard—definitely
confined to the bench by injury or
sickness, Coach Husky Hunt's fresh
man eleven will enter the game with
(lie University of Southern California
freshmen tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
o'clock in the Stadium somewhat the
under dog. Allen is still nursing a
bad ankle, and Ebey is in the Palo
Alto Hospital with a severe case of
poison oak.
Though both teams have gone
through the season undefeated, a tie
game has been chalked up on the
record of each. The Stanford year
lings were tied 6 to 6 by the Army in
their first game of the year and the
Trojan frosli, 0 to 0, by the California
freshmen last week.
S.C. Has Weight
The Southern California team will
have the advantage of weight and re
serves; but, barring injuries, the
Curds will give them more than
enough competition. The Army was
the only team to score on the Stan
ford first-year men, and against their
six opponents the Cards have amassed
a total of 175 points. The S.C. fresh
men have not been scored on.
