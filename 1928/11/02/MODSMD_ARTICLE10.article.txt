# WISCONSIN PLAYS CRIMSON TIDE ON MADISON'S FIELD
## Princeton Will Oppose Ohio State; Pennsylvania to Meet Chicago Team 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 1. (#>)—'The Crim
son Tide, that globe-trotting eleven
from Alabama, will receive its first
taste of Western Conference football
tomorrow when Wisconsin and Ala
bama clash at Madison in one of three
invasions of Big Ten circles by non
conference teams.
The game will be Wisconsin's first
intersectional game since 1912 when
the then championship Badgers routed
Arkansas, G4 to 7.
The Princeton Tiger will stalk into
the lair of Ohio State, and the Penn
sylvania Quakers will come West to
meet the downtrodden Chicago
Maroons.
Neither Princeton nor Ohio State
has been defeated this season. Ohio
has shown noticeable improvement in
every struggle, and the team came
out of the Indiana fray in excellent
physical shape except for Leo Ras
kowski, veteran tackle, whose ankle
was injured. Barring other injuries
he probably will be the only regular
not starting Saturday.
Illinois Punch Missing
Despite four defeats optimism
reigns at Michigan, where the Wol
verines are preparing for Illinois, so
far unbeaten. Fielding Yost appeared
on the field yesterday and shouted his
famous "hurry-up" as Tad Weiman
worked to get more punch into the
backs.
A search for Illinois' missing punch,
apparent in the Northwestern game
Inst week, has been made by Coach
Zuppke this week. The Illini have
been accumulating great amounts of
yardage, although counting compara
tively few touchdowns.
Northwestern will introduce two
distinct back field units tomorrow in
its attempt to break through Minne
sota's powerful line at Dyche Sta
dium. Coach Hanley intends to start
one combination of regular backs;
then relieve them and give another
set of erstwhile regulars a chance.
