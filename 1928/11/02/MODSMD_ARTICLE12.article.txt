# CARD VARSITY INVADES SOUTH FOR CRUCIAL S.C. GAME
## FORTY-SEVEN MEN READ FOR L. A. AFTER MONSTER SEND-OFF RALLY Warner's Reserve Strength Gives Stanford Edge In Betting; Players Feel Confident Of Keeping Conference Record Unmarred 
### 
TIGHT HUNDRED enthusiastic students, led by yell leaders Paul Speegle
and Fred Northway, and assisted by a portion of the Stanford Band, were
present at the Palo Alto depot last night to cheer the Los Angeles-bound
varsity. Eight hundred heard Pop Warner utter his now famous parting
statement, "I'll be damned if any Southern California squad can outfight a
Stanford team." The veteran Cardinal coach continued to say that the breaks
of the game will be of great importance in tomorrow's tilt. He is certain
that the Stanford varsity can win the contest if it gets a goodly share of
these breaks.
After his brief address, Pop swung aboard the Stanford Special with his
forty-seven players. They will reach Los Angeles at 9 o'clock this morning
and will go immediately to the Coliseum for a light workout. Two assistant

coaches, one trainer, one physician,
and three managers complete the of
ficial party for the southern trip.
With his squad in better shape for
the S.C. game than for any game since
he came to the Pacific Coast, Coach
Pop Warner is favored 10 to 8 in the
betting odds to record another victory
over Coach Howard Jones and for the
third consecutive year to win or tie
for the Pacific Coast Conference
Championship.
Preston Out of Game
Only Johnny Preston will not be in
a suit for the Cards tomorrow. Spud
Harder and Dick Worden, though not
entirely fit, will be ready to enter the
game if necessary. Little Frank Wil
ton will again be seen in action for
the first time since the Oregon game.
Warner's puzzling offense, called by
George Varnell, well-known football
official, following the Idaho game "the
most perfect offense ever developed
in the United States," will have its
first real test against a conference
team tomorrow. Though putting up
stiff fights, neither Oregon nor Idaho
was able to give Stanford more than
a strenuous workout.
Depend on Reserves
Stanford's advantage, if there be
any, over Southern California, lies in
its tremendous reserve strength. War
ner has three good backfield combina
tions, as many line combinations, and
has taken four complete teams and
three extra men to Los Angeles to
allow for any emergency. Though pos
sessing considerable reserve material
in the line, Jones has not the host of
able backfield men that Warner has.
To give the probable lineup is al
most a matter of impossibility, inas
much as Warner has started a differ
ent lineup in the majority of the
games this year. Secret practice has
been the rule during the past week
and what combination Warner has
been running as first string is not
known. However, men who are fairly
sure to begin the game are Sellman
and Artman, tackles; Post and Ito
beeky, guards; Heinecke, center; and
Captain Biff Hoffman, fullback.

first real test against a conference
team tomorrow. Though putting up
stiff fights, neither Oregon nor Idaho
was able to give Stanford more than
a strenuous workout.
Depend on Reserves
Stanford's advantage, if there be
any, over Southern California, lies in
its tremendous reserve strength. War
ner has three good backfield combina
tions, as many line combinations, and
has taken four complete teams and
three extra men to Los Angeles to
allow for any emergency. Though pos
sessing considerable reserve material
in the line, Jones has not the host of
able backfield men that Warner has.
To give the probable lineup is al
most a matter of impossibility, inas
much as Warner has started a differ
ent lineup in the majority of the
games this year. Secret practice has
been the rule during the past week
and what combination Warner has
been running as first string is not
known. However, men who are fairly
sure to begin the game are Sellman
and Artman, tackles; Post and Ito
beeky, guards; Heinecke, center; and
Captain Biff Hoffman, fullback.
TIGHT HUNDRED enthusiastic students, led by yell leaders Paul Speegle
and Fred Northway, and assisted by a portion of the Stanford Band, were
present at the Palo Alto depot last night to cheer the Los Angeles-bound
varsity. Eight hundred heard Pop Warner utter his now famous parting
statement, "I'll be damned if any Southern California squad can outfight a
Stanford team." The veteran Cardinal coach continued to say that the breaks
of the game will be of great importance in tomorrow's tilt. He is certain
that the Stanford varsity can win the contest if it gets a goodly share of
these breaks.
After his brief address, Pop swung aboard the Stanford Special with his
forty-seven players. They will reach Los Angeles at 9 o'clock this morning
and will go immediately to the Coliseum for a light workout. Two assistant

coaches, one trainer, one physician,
and three managers complete the of
ficial party for the southern trip.
With his squad in better shape for
the S.C. game than for any game since
he came to the Pacific Coast, Coach
Pop Warner is favored 10 to 8 in the
betting odds to record another victory
over Coach Howard Jones and for the
third consecutive year to win or tie
for the Pacific Coast Conference
Championship.
Preston Out of Game
Only Johnny Preston will not be in
a suit for the Cards tomorrow. Spud
Harder and Dick Worden, though not
entirely fit, will be ready to enter the
game if necessary. Little Frank Wil
ton will again be seen in action for
the first time since the Oregon game.
Warner's puzzling offense, called by
George Varnell, well-known football
official, following the Idaho game "the
most perfect offense ever developed
in the United States," will have its
first real test against a conference
team tomorrow. Though putting up
stiff fights, neither Oregon nor Idaho
was able to give Stanford more than
a strenuous workout.
