LOS ANGELES, Nov. 1. —Don
Williams, Southern California's claim
ant for All-American quarterback hon
ors, twisted his knee In practice yes
terday afternoon. However, the star
signal-caller was out in uniform to
day, and hopes to be able to start
against Stanford.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 1. (JP)—Coach
Howard Jones expected today to send
his first team intact into the Stanford
game here Saturday, for the first time
since the Trojan gridders tackled St.
Mary's three weeks ago.
Nathan Barrager, first team center,
took the field again last night after
spending three days in the hospital
with an injured hip and a slight case
of "flu."
The other Trojan players who have
been ailing but who are anticipating
action Saturday are Captain Jesse
Hibbs, Charlie Boren, Harry Edelson,
and Lowry McCaslin. Hibbs suffered a
ccld at the beginning of the week but
has been working out since Tuesday.
Boren returned to the lineup this
week after a long lay-off caused by
injured knees. He is first-string run
ning guard. ,
Edelson Takes Workout
Edelson, experienced halfback, hurt
his ankle two weeks ago and has been
favoring it since, although he has
participated in light workouts.
Lowry McCaslin, promising varsity
end, is thought to be himself again
after having his knee injured.
With these men back in position,
Jones has proceeded with his plan of
shifting Captain Hibbs to end on of
fense, to give more power to his
power position. On defense, Hibbs
returns to tackle, Shaw moves over
to running guard, and Charley Boren
goes out to end.
Substitutes Ready
Although the Trojans from the hos
pital will start, Coach Jones has
worked their understudies from the
bench in some of the most strenuous
scrimmages of the season this week
in an effort to have a good man ready
to plug the hole if one of the casual
ties should return to the ward during
the game.
While indications were today that
Southern California would be ready
for Stanford, the betting odds hung
determinedly against the Jonesmen
and Cardinal backers still were giving
away points in their wagers.
