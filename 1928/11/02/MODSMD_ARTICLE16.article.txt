# HOOVER CLUB PLANS BROADCAST PROGRAM
## 
### 
In order to present to the public
the true position of Herbert Hoover
on the Stanford campus, and to show
why his candidacy should appeal to
University men and women, the Stan
ford-for-Hoover Club will broadcast
a half hour's speaking program from
10:30 to 11 o'clock on the night of
the election, November 5.
This program will constitute an an
swer to the Smith Club radio broad
cast of a week ago over KYA which,
the Hoover Club feels, gave the im
pression that there was an unanimity
on the campus that Stanford was for
Smith. "The student poll which gave
Hoover a 3-to-l ratio over Smith clear
ly shows," said Herbert Wenig, presi
dent of the Stanford-for-Hoover Club,
"that Herbert Hoover has the gener
al support of the student body in his
own alma mater."
The program will be published Mon
day.
