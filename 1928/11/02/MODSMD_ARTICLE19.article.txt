# Students Welcoming a Distinguished Citizen
## 
### 
The sensible decision has finally been made as to plans for the wel
come of Herbert Hoover when he arrives next Monday afternoon, and
the rally will be conducted by the Rally Committee as a non-partisan
affair honoring a distinguished citizen. Professor Robert Eckles Swain,
acting president of the University, and Professor Edgar E. Robinson,
chairman of the committee on public exercises, stated they were happy
to have the student body take over the welcome demonstration. The or
ganization previously had been in the hands of the Stanford Hoover
Club, which through its president, Herbert Wenig, has graciously re
signed the direction of the rally to the A.S.S.U.
The Executive Committee gave its approval of the new proposal last
night. Preparations will go forward over the week-end, and on Monday,
when everyone returns from the game, the final arrangements will be
announced.
