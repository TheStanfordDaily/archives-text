						Disaster Fortunately Averted

Five hundred dollars' damage was done, and only by the grace of
God was serious injury averted, when thoughtless freshman Hallowe'en
pranksters last night pulled the trolley of the dinky off its wire and
swung it to one side, where it made contact with the telephone lines. As
a result, at least 250 phones on the campus have been disabled since
Wednesday night, and part of these will be out of commission until noon
today, according to the Palo Alto wire chief of the telephone company.
Why do freshmen do such rash, foolish things as this? It would
seem that even the 1932 quota of common sense would furnish the
knowledge that interfering with electric wires is something not to be
done by anyone valuing his life. Fortunately, no one was burned; there
must have been a number of guardian angels on lookout at the time.
Fixing responsibility for the affair is another unpleasant mess for
the telephone company and the University. Neither party knows who
was "in" on the prank. There is but one honorable thing for those men
who were the instigators of the prank to do, and that is to admit their
complicity. We rather expect to see them do it.
