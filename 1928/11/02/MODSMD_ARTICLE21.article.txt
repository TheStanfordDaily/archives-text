# Oregon Fights Longhairs
## 
### 
A delectable controversy lias arisen at the University of Oregon over
the right of student franchise. The Eugene Federated Church Brother
hood says University students of voting age are not eligible to cast their
national and city election ballots in the of Eugene on November 6.
The Brotherhood is so certain of its position that it has lined up a plan
of legal battle to defend the thesis that all students having their per
manent homes outside of Eugene are not legally entitled to the right of
franchise.
"Childish!" is the answer of the Oregon Emerald, as it joins battle.
The question of prohibiting Sunday movies in the city is to be brought
up at the election, whence the action of the Brotherhood in attempting
to cut off a large block of pro-Sunday-movies votes. The students are in
favor of Sabbath cinema in the proportion of five to one.
Arden X. Pangborn (sic), editor of the Emerald, writes: "The word
'brotherhood' has generally been accepted as signifying an attitude tend
ing toward democracy; yet this organization plans to eliminate the exer
cise of a right granted by the United States Constitution."
It is hard to understand why any controversy should arise as to
whether students not residents of Eugene should be allowed to vote
there. One would think that state law would allow or not allow that
privilege. If the matter is to be decidcd by town officials, they ought to
let the students continue to vote, for such has been the previous practice
of Eugene. The fight merely goes to show the unscrupulousness of
church interests when they stand for what they are pleased to call an
issue of public morals. It appears that they have invoked the possibility
of disqualifying the student vote simply to better their chances of passing
the blue law. We hope the students lick the Brotherhood, and we indeed
express our surprise that Oregon should harbor any substantial number
whatever of students who favor Sunday closing of theaters.
