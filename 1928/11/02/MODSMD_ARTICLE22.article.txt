# Madden Deserves Great Credit

### 
The financial success of the concert series is said now to be assured;
the venture is over the hump, and from now on Manager Sidney Mad
den's job will be more reasonable in its demands upon him. He has
worked night and day to sell tickets for the 1928-29 season so that the
scries might rest on a firm financial basis, and he ha*; succeeded.
Everyone who enjoys the concerts owes thanks to Madden for his
industry and determination in seeing his job through. The concert series
was considered to be doomed to failure when Madden took it over last
spring; indeed, it was with trepidation that the Executive Committee
consented to go on with the musical offerings. Now the project is out
of danger, and, with the Tibbett concert, an excellent season has begun.
Suggested Democratic advice to Republicans: "Go whitewash the
Elephant, if you want to do something big."
Old Man River has pi'oved facetious. The states of Mississippi and
Louisiana have come to blows over an island, which was washed away
in the flrxxl days of the Mississippi and brought up in another place. The
Supreme Court will decide which state owns it.
