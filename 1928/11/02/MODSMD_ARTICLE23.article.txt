DELENDA EST TROiA!
Always looms in the southland the
Trojan menace. Year after year the
cry goes up, "Trojans Beware." Three
years ago defeat went to Southern
California by a six-point margin, two
years ago the same by a one-point
margin, and last year deadlock ended
the game with the P.C.C. title claimed :
by three contestants. This year, with ;
two losses and a tie rankling in their
blood, victory or die is the whoop of
the S.C. men. But ever with Catonic
insistence the Cardinal flings its ulti
matum, Delenda est Troia!
The giant Los Angeles Coliseum
was packed on paper a month ago.
Special trains, steamships, autos, air
planes will pour a veritable flood of
Cardinals into the stronghold of the
toe. One thousand rooters will roar
deadly war cries at the enemy, who
with equal fervor will hurl them back, i
But, give 'em the axe, the axe, the
axe! Delenda est Troia!
Newsmen by satiric column writing,
story handling have nurtured a spirit
of hatred between the two universi

| ties. Strange athletic differences in
the past have heaped on coals. Sec
tional rivalry. The sudden sky-rocket
ing to gargantuan prominence of the
southern institution. These things
have intensified the annual strife.
Stanford will invade Troy with death
in its eye. Delenda est Troia!
: What of the Big Game? Why the
; Big Game is nothing, nothing but the
time-honored struggle between two
jolly good fellows and friends at that,
but the Trojan affair, that is war. For,
iike Menelaus fighting to win the fair
Helen, so will Stanford fight to win
| the coveted championship. Delenda
I est Troia!
! Sparta had its Troy, Rome its Carth
. age, and Stanford its Trojan menace.
Once upon a time a Trojan horse
proved a horse of another color, and
a city fell. Perhaps, perhaps, but leave
i that to the day. On to Troy, rid us of
this jeopardy to the title, scale the
Trojan walls, batter down its gates,
sack the citadel, and win the title.
Delenda est Troia!
