The Editor, Sir:
To the present din and confusion
regarding the situation at the Eneina
Dining Halls may I add a few remarks
and complaints?
1. Let us get rid at once of this
suggestion that we eliminate break
fast at Encina Commons. The idea
is in the first place medically unsound,
for no matter how many boys may
miss breakfast now there will never
be any justification for making less
accessible than it is at present a meal
that is perhaps the most essential one
of the day. Secondly, no matter what
the freshman's sins may be, it is too
much to ask that he be forced to
patronize any more than necessary
the abominably stinking, filthy rat
hole known as the Encina Store —
which any self-respecting County Sani
tation Board would close up, padlock,
and prosecute after one whiff. No, Sir,
if anything is to be done to the break
fasts at Encina, let them be made
more accessible, not less so —cafe-
teria breakfasts are a good suggestion.
2. I do not see how it can be ex
pected that good meals could be
served —even to the number that eat
(or rather, pay) at Encina —for a dol
lar a day, as some have suggested.
Lei those who entertain such a fond
notion try and eat comfortably down
town for a dollar-fifty a day. What it
comes down to is this —the student at
Encina Commons is expecting some
thing for nothing. At the Harvard
Freshman Dining Halls, where I
spent a palatable year, the weekly
charge is about $9.50; for that rate
we got a real choice of food, plenty
of seconds, service by employed wait
resses, and a much wider time-range
lor entering the halls —thus permit
ting a higher percentage of paid-for
meals to be eaten.
3. College students are supposed to
be gentlemen, and they rightfully re
sent being treated as reform-school
inmates —by having to show a ticket
for each and every meal that they
eat at the Commons. There is no logi
cal justification for this method of
policing the patrons of the Commons
—if it be feared that some boys will
try to get away with free meals, why
is it not possible for the Guardian of
the Gate at each entrance to admit
us on recognition? Again to illustrate
by the Harvard Freshman Dining
Halls, the system there was to issue
to each student a membership card,
which he was called upon to show for
the first few days of the semester.
After that the head-waitress knew us
all, and cards were superfluous —they
were asked for on rare occasions
after that in order to make sure that
no one was slipping through. And,
bear in mind, that each Dining Hall
served a whole dormitory—from 135
to 250 students. Surely it would not
be a great strain on the martinets of
Encina to be asked to remember 60
to 120 faces —they probably know
them all too well as it is right now.
To conclude, I might mention that
I noticed in a recent article in Hygeia
the remark —which none will dispute
—that more essential to digestion
even than attractive surroundings at
a meal is an appetizing selection of
food, decently selected and presented,
so that the process of eating should
be more than a hurried and boring
business of stocking the stomach with
a conglomeration of calories; so that
there are more than merely aesthetic
reasons back of the Encina man's de
sire for better meals. May those de
sires be soon fulfilled, before we have
to write over the entrances to our
respective dining rooms:
"Abandon hope, all ye that enter
here." —Geoffrey Edsall.
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that Mr. Gooden
and the Law Grad have succeeded in
shedding a great deal of light on this
troublesome question of the honor
system. They have called attention

to the fact that what we have been
referring to as the honor system is
more accurately only an informal
proctor system. It is true that under
the present system no particular stu
dents have been singled out and
designated proctors. That is consid
ered unnecessary, for by virtue of a
sort of unwritten law, each of us has
supposedly assumed the responsibility
to report all cases of cheating that he
sees.
What I want to know is this: if our
present so-called honor system doesn't
substantially amount to a modified
proctor system, what does it amount
to? Our system can't be both, for the
two systems are mutually exclusive.
If what I have written is true and if
what we have really had during all
this time is a modification of the
proctor system, then let's have the
good sense to admit it.
I believe that the question before
those of us who are interested in such
matters is not whether or not we are
going to continue the honor system,
which is impossible owing to the fact
that there is none to continue, but is
whether or not the present informal
proctor system is satisfactory.
I am of the opinion that it is not,
and I think that the facts would bear
me out in my belief.
Of course it is barely possible that
a genuine honor system, as defined by
Mr. Gooden, would work. This I doubt.
So I sincerely recommend the adop
tion of a system that will place the
responsibility of seeing that there is
no cheating in examination where it
belongs—upon the University.
Perhaps I sound very conservative
and reactionary. I don't think that I
am. The reason for my suggestion is
that the very thoughts of acting as a
tale-bearer have always been exceed
ingly repellent to me. I would much
rather have the professor in the room
during ail examination than to feel
that it was up to me, along with the
other members of the class, to see
that there was no cheating.
Sincerely, Another Law Grad.
