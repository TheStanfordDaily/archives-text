Silas Bradford's Boy. By Joseph Lin
coln. (New York: D. Appleton &
Company, 1928. $2.)
Silas Bradford's boy won out. He
proved himself worthy of the family
name; raised his mother in the esti
mation of the Bradfords; married the
one and only girl; and presumably
lived happy ever after.
Fiddlesticks and tommyrot, you say.
All right, go ahead; but there's no
getting around the fact that Joseph
Lincoln is a fascinating story-teller.
No great literary style, no probing
into the complexes of human nature;
merely a good story well told. After
all, what more can you want for an
evening's pleasure?
Joseph Lincoln is fairly impreg
nated with the "salt marsh breezes
and the bright sun of the Cape Cod
country." One finds a briny tang of
the real New England coast in both
his settings and his characters. Heze
kiali Bartlett, Ebenezer Tadgett, Het
tie Bradford, and Uncle Abijah are
people you can shake hands with and
chuckle over.
The story itself is dramatic, at one
point a little too much so, and there
is woven in a nicely sustained mystery
element that puts the book into that
category called "absorbing."
I must admit I enjoyed Silas Brad
ford's Boy in toto, even though there
isn't a sex complex, or racy sentence,
or hot scene to be found. Simply a
well-told story of the classic "up from
the bottom" type.
