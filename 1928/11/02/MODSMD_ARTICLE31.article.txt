# BAD TEAMWORK CAUSE OF BABE SOCCER DEFEAT
## 
### 
For the second time this season the
freshman soccer team came through
with a zero score to its credit and
with the opposing team making a big
total of goals. Yesterday afternoon
the Pescadero High School team
walked away with the game on the
varsity field to the score of 6-0.
In the first half of the game the
high school squad collected four
scores, and in the second half it fin
ished by acquiring two more goals.
Maloney said that the men on the
team showed no co-operation or team
work whatsoever, and that they had
difficulty in handling the ball after
receiving it. For the most part of the
game the ball was in freshman terri
tory and there seemed to be at no
time any danger of a frosh score.
