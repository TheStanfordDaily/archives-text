# OREGON STUDENTS FIGHT FOR RIGHT TO VOTE ON EUGENE'S "BLUE LAW"
## Present Rule Banning Sunday Movies Will Come Up For Revote in National and City Election Tuesday 
### 
EUGENE, Ore., Nov. 1. (PlP)—Are
university students of voting age eli
gible to cast their ballots in the na
tional and city election in Eugene
November G?
An organization calling itself the
Eugene Federated Church Brother
hood says no. In fact, it says no with
considerable vehemence and has lined
up a plan of legal battle with Donald
Husband, Eugene attorney, leading
the forces. The "Brotherhood" claims
that students who have their perma
nent homes outside of Eugene are not
legally entitled to the right of this
franchise.
Daily Enters Fray
"Childish!" replies the Daily Emer
ald, official publication of the Univer
sity of Oregon student-body. And so
the battle has begun.
The question of prohibiting Sunday
movies in the city, which will be
brought up at the election, is the rea
son for the action of the "Brother
hood." The latter is said to have
started the move it did because of the
fact that university students in round
numbers of five to one are opposed to
prohibiting Sunday movies. An ordi
nance is now in effect banning movies
on the Sabbath, making Eugene one
of the few larger towns in the coun
try taking this stand.
Democracy Demanded
"The word 'brotherhood' has gener
ally been accepted as signifying an
attitude toward democracy; yet this
organization plans to eliminate the
exercise of a right granted by the
United States Constitution," declared
Arden X. Panborn, editor of the Emer
ald.

"If the allegations of the legal ad
viser of the 'Brotherhood' should hap
pen to be right and some of the stu
dents have voted illegally, can city
officials feel safe in their positions?
Oh what disgrace the fair city of
Eugene must feel, realizing for years
past it has been guided in part by
illegal votes! Shades of Chicago!"
"Voting Is Mockery!"
The Emerald goes further to say
that under the circumstances the vot
ing could well degenerate into a mock
ery of democracy. "What is proof that
a student does not intend to make
Eugene his permanent home? Strange
things," it declares.
The assessed valuation of fraternity
and sorority property in the city of
Eugene amounts to approximately one
million two hundred thousand dollars.
Students pay taxes on this property,
it is shown. It is also brought to argu
ment that the students annually spend
approximately two million dollars in
Eugene.
Boycott Suggested
"If the students be kept from vot
ing, why not boycott the Eugene mer
chants?" the Emerald asks. It points
out that Princeton students have
thought of the same thing in their
controversy of the same nature with
Princeton, New Jersey, city officials.
Several riots, or near riots, resulted
from the challenging of the student
vote in Princeton.
Joe McKeown, president of the stu
dent-body, has announced a special
meeting of the student executive
council for the purposes of hiring a
competent attorney to do battle for
the university's point of view, and for
(Jiecussing the subject in general.

The assessed valuation of fraternity

EUGENE, Ore., Nov. 1. (PlP)—Are
university students of voting age eli
gible to cast their ballots in the na
tional and city election in Eugene
November G?
An organization calling itself the
Eugene Federated Church Brother
hood says no. In fact, it says no with
considerable vehemence and has lined
up a plan of legal battle with Donald
Husband, Eugene attorney, leading
the forces. The "Brotherhood" claims
that students who have their perma
nent homes outside of Eugene are not
legally entitled to the right of this
franchise.
Daily Enters Fray
"Childish!" replies the Daily Emer
ald, official publication of the Univer
sity of Oregon student-body. And so
the battle has begun.
The question of prohibiting Sunday
movies in the city, which will be
brought up at the election, is the rea
son for the action of the "Brother
hood." The latter is said to have
started the move it did because of the
fact that university students in round
numbers of five to one are opposed to
prohibiting Sunday movies. An ordi
nance is now in effect banning movies
on the Sabbath, making Eugene one
of the few larger towns in the coun
try taking this stand.
Democracy Demanded
"The word 'brotherhood' has gener
ally been accepted as signifying an
attitude toward democracy; yet this
organization plans to eliminate the
exercise of a right granted by the
United States Constitution," declared
Arden X. Panborn, editor of the Emer
ald.

"If the allegations of the legal ad
viser of the 'Brotherhood' should hap
pen to be right and some of the stu
dents have voted illegally, can city
officials feel safe in their positions?
Oh what disgrace the fair city of
Eugene must feel, realizing for years
past it has been guided in part by
illegal votes! Shades of Chicago!"
