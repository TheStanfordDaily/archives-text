### 
There is one place in the world -
where Stanford roughs cannot crash
the gate!
Fifteen briglit-sweatered summer
tourists were turned away from the j
door of the Vatican Museum on ac-1
count of their coatless condition, when |
Carl F. Brand's student group inno- \
cently appeared in their campus out-1
fits. But "you can't keep a good man j
down," they cried, retreating. A mo
ment later they remounted the steps
of the famous museum clad in silver
buttoned, coat-tail-flapping coats
which they had borrowed from the
coachmen.
The students who went with Brand
are: Hughes Brewster, Stanley Cook,
Frank Dietrich, Steve Halsted, Don
Hamblin, William Johnston, Carl
Meyer, Boyd McNaughton, Foster
Rhodes, James Sharp, Dan Smith,
Charles Switzer, Robert Syer, Hal Ter
williger, and Carl Valentine.
Their tour took them to Paris,
through Italy and Switzerland, and
into Germany. They arrived in Heidel
berg on the last day of the German
school term, and witnessed the spec
tacle of the uniformed students riding
through town in carriages and flour
ishing great steins of beer. Although j
duelling is legally forbidden, there is
much "bootlegging'' and the students
are proud of the scars on their faces.
