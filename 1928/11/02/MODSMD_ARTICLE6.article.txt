# SOCIALIST GAINS MOST VOTERS IN POLITICAL MEET
## Debate Closes Activities of Hoover-Smith-Thomas Clubs on Campus 
### 
Before an audience which practical
ly filled the lower flower of the As
sembly Hall, representatives of the
three campus political clubs tonight
brought their activities on the cam
pus to a close last night when the
Thomas forces changed more votes
on the second ballot than either of
the major parties. The Thomas forces
showed a gain of 26 votes, the Smith
adherents a loss of 23, and Hooverites
a loss of 79.
From the indications 76 of the audi
ence left the hall without voting on
the second ballot. The Hoover vote
was: first ballot, 266; second ballot,
187; Smith, first ballot, 132; second
ballot, 109; Thomas, first ballot, 25;
second ballot, 51.
George Bodlc, president of the Smith
for-President Club, opened the contest
by presenting Governor Smith as a great
liberal and progressive. John McClin
tock next took the platform for the Re
publicans, stating that obviously all of
the candidates were eminently honest and
capable, but a third qualification was nec
essary, namely, training. He pointed out
that Hoover surpassed them all in this
respect. John Way, taking the place of
his brother, Stewart, who was confined
by illness, made the point that neither
of the major parties differ fundamentally
in their programs.
Continuing the argument for the Dem
ocrats, George Shibley said that the Re
publican party was intent on maintain
ing the "status quo" which is exceedingly
unsatisfactory. He eloquently charac
terized prohibition as a failure. He was
followed by Robert Hume, Republican,
who compared the candidates man to man
and compared their programs to the credit
of Hoover.
Elizabeth Jackson, supporter of Nor
man Thomas, next took the stand with
the statement that both sides had been
slinging mud but that the socialists would
not criticize where they could not sug
gest a constructive reform. Miss Jack
son, a freshman, and the only woman in
the contest, presented her facts clearly
and logically, and received a large ova
tion.
In the heat of the debate all of the
speakers probably gave the best speeches
of their careers. Although an audience
decision was given, the only real settle
ment of the questions discussed will be
made in the general election next Tues
day.
CHICAGO, Nov. 1 (j<P).—Hot stove
league rumors that Major League owners
plan to band together in an attempt to
reduce players' salaries next season have

of the American League.

who compared the candidates man to man
and compared their programs to the credit
of Hoover.
Elizabeth Jackson, supporter of Nor
man Thomas, next took the stand with
the statement that both sides had been
slinging mud but that the socialists would
not criticize where they could not sug
gest a constructive reform. Miss Jack
son, a freshman, and the only woman in
the contest, presented her facts clearly
and logically, and received a large ova
tion.
In the heat of the debate all of the
speakers probably gave the best speeches
of their careers. Although an audience
decision was given, the only real settle
ment of the questions discussed will be
made in the general election next Tues
day.
CHICAGO, Nov. 1 (j<P).—Hot stove
league rumors that Major League owners
plan to band together in an attempt to
reduce players' salaries next season have
been denied by President E. S. Barnard
of the American League.
Before an audience which practical
ly filled the lower flower of the As
sembly Hall, representatives of the
three campus political clubs tonight
brought their activities on the cam
pus to a close last night when the
Thomas forces changed more votes
on the second ballot than either of
the major parties. The Thomas forces
showed a gain of 26 votes, the Smith
adherents a loss of 23, and Hooverites
a loss of 79.
From the indications 76 of the audi
ence left the hall without voting on
the second ballot. The Hoover vote
was: first ballot, 266; second ballot,
187; Smith, first ballot, 132; second
ballot, 109; Thomas, first ballot, 25;
second ballot, 51.
George Bodlc, president of the Smith
for-President Club, opened the contest
by presenting Governor Smith as a great
liberal and progressive. John McClin
tock next took the platform for the Re
publicans, stating that obviously all of
the candidates were eminently honest and
capable, but a third qualification was nec
essary, namely, training. He pointed out
that Hoover surpassed them all in this
respect. John Way, taking the place of
his brother, Stewart, who was confined
by illness, made the point that neither
of the major parties differ fundamentally
in their programs.
Continuing the argument for the Dem
ocrats, George Shibley said that the Re
publican party was intent on maintain
ing the "status quo" which is exceedingly
unsatisfactory. He eloquently charac
terized prohibition as a failure. He was
followed by Robert Hume, Republican,
who compared the candidates man to man
and compared their programs to the credit
of Hoover.
