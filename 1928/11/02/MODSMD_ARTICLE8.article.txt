# A.S.S.U. TO TAKE OVER PLANS FOR HOOVER WELCOME
## Committees Will Carry on Work to Make Rally Student Affair 
### 
The Executive and Rally commit
tees will carry on the plans begun by
the Hoover Club for the Hoover rally
Monday afternoon, it was announced
last night.
The rally will be held at 1:30 when
Hoover arrives from the East. Every
possible effort is being made to re
serve the station grounds for students
only. After a short rally at the sta
tion, Hoover's car, followed by autos
of all students who went to the sta
tion, will parade up Palm Drive,
which will be lined with cars from
off campus, and school children from
Palo Alto and the vicinity.' Every
house on the Row is asked by the
Rally Committee to fly an American
flag if possible. The only other deco
ration on the campus will be a large
American flag flying from a 20-foot
pole at the gates to Palm Drive.
The Rally Committee is formulating
its plans upon those started by the
Hoover Club and turned over to the
Committee in order to make the rally
a student affair, and a non-partisan
welcome to Hoover as a prominent
alumnus of Stanford.
