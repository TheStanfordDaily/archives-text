Does it rain
on the
Grand Banks?
RAIN and sleet and spray are
all in the day's work for Fish
Brand Slickcrs. They've cov
ered the backs of deep-sea
fishermen for 92 years.
The famous "Varsity"
model is built of the same
sturdy stuff. It's a handsome
coat, full-lined, with big,
book-carrying pockets that
won't rip. Strap-collar or
plain, buttons or buckles,
and your choice of colors.
If you want a lighter,
dressier slicker, there's the
"Topper"â€”smartly cut and
finely tailored.
Tower's Slickers are sold
everywhere. Look for the
Fish Brand mark. A. J.
Tower Company, Boston,
Massachusetts.
