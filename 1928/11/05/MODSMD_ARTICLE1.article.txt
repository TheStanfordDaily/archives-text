# OWN BLUNDERS DEFEAT CARDS IN ATTACK ON U.S.C. GRID TEAM
## Stanford's Warriors Provide Breaks; Outdo Trojans in Yardage, Punting, Downs Line Plays Excellent Game; Backfield Defense Strong; Weakens When Near Goal 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Stanford's Red Host attacked the
stronghold of Troy Saturday with sut
ficient strength at times to have shat
tered its walls, only to be thrust back
by its own blunders when approaching
the objective. Breaks decided the
game, and on that account Warner's
unlucky warriors would offer an alibi.
But they won't because they provided
the breaks for the ever-alert Trojans
and they know that the breaks are a
factor of the game, not a foreign ele
ment.
The Cardinals had the power in the
middle of the field, but it did them
no good. Four times in the first half
they crashed their way through the
Trojans to threaten the Southern
California goal only to lose the ball by
fumbling reverse passes. The first two
periods of the game belonged to Stan
ford except at those critical moments.
If the score were determined by yard
age gains Stanford would have won
by a two-to-one ratio. The Cardinals
gained a total of 252 yards. U.S.C.
made 143 yards. Stanford made a total
of 14 first downs to Troy's 4. Stan
ford outgained, outpunted, and out
passed the Thundering Herd. In fact,
Stanford did everything but outplay
the winner, considering that the game
was won by scores, not statistics.
Warner Line Strong
The Warner line never played a
finer game. Every man on the forward
wall gave all he had. Heinecke out
played Barrager at center and was in
nearly every play on defense. Artman,
Post, Robesky, and Sellman provided
such a wall in the middle of the line
that the ends were able to play ex
ceptionally. wide.
Heinecke, Sellman, and Davidson
were the first down under punts and
made most of the tackles after Hoff
man's kicks. Davidson, replacing Har
der who wrenched his knee at the
start of the game, got his big chance
yesterday and as 80,000 fans will tes
tify, he made good in spite of a foot
fracture received on his third play.
Hoffman was not at par as a fullback;
he punted well and passed well, but
could not seem to hold the ball on
the reverse plays. Fleishhacker, Sims,
Wilton, Frentrup, Lewis, Smalling,
and Simkins all shone at intervals in
midfield. They were great on the de
fensive, and good on the offensive ex
cept when they approached the enemy
goal.
Williams, Saunders Star
Don Williams and Russ Saunders
were the big backfield stars of the
day. Aided by a powerful interference
these two men did nearly all ot the
gaining for the Herd. The Trojan
line, supposedly weakened by in
juries, gave no indication of weak
ness. Southern California's chief weak
ness was supposed to lie in their lack
of reserves. The starting Trojan team
stood up so well that Jones didn't
give the spectators a chance to see
this weakness in action.
The Trojans scored the lirst and
only touchdown of the game in the
second quarter. Hibbs intercepted a |
pass from Hoffman to give U.S.C. the
hall on Stanford's 36-yard line. The j
Trojans were unable to gain through ;
the line and fell back on a brilliant !
aerial attack.
Saunders passed to McCaslin for a
gain of 20 yards, putting the ball on
the 15-yard line. Williams gained two
yards and then received a pass from
Thomas that netted ten yards.
The ball was on the 3-yard line and
a determined Stanford team held |
U.S.C. valiantly for three downs. On
the fourth down Williams threw a 1
short pass to Saunders who fought
his way across the Stanford goal line.
Captain Jesse Hibbs converted an?
U.S.C. was leading 7-0.
The Cardinals had Don Williams
stopped through the line, but the
speedy Trojan runner carried back
one of Hoffman's punts 34 yards to
put the ball on Stanford's 26-yard
line near the end of the third quarter.
His run put the Trojans in a position
to score again.
After Saunders gained two yards,
he completed a pass to McCaslin for
twelve yards. The Trojans wanted
another touchdown but Williams could
add only one yard and Edelson five. !
The quarter ended with the ball on
the 8-yard line, and U.S.C. had two
downs in which to make this distance.
A pass, Thomas to Williams, fell in
complete. It was the last down. Cap
tain Jesse Hibbs dropped back and
hooted a place-kick to give U.S.C. j
three more points. Hibbs tried an
other place-kick later in the quarter
from a difficult angle, but missed.
Stanford opened up a passing at- i
tack but nothing happened in the way j

of scoring. It at least provided a few
| thrills for the fans, for a Warner
\ team is never beaten until the game
| is over.

The Cardinals had Don Williams
stopped through the line, but the
speedy Trojan runner carried back
one of Hoffman's punts 34 yards to
put the ball on Stanford's 26-yard
line near the end of the third quarter.
His run put the Trojans in a position
to score again.

Stanford's Red Host attacked the
stronghold of Troy Saturday with sut
ficient strength at times to have shat
tered its walls, only to be thrust back
by its own blunders when approaching
the objective. Breaks decided the
game, and on that account Warner's
unlucky warriors would offer an alibi.
But they won't because they provided
the breaks for the ever-alert Trojans
and they know that the breaks are a
factor of the game, not a foreign ele
ment.
The Cardinals had the power in the
middle of the field, but it did them
no good. Four times in the first half
they crashed their way through the
Trojans to threaten the Southern
California goal only to lose the ball by
fumbling reverse passes. The first two
periods of the game belonged to Stan
ford except at those critical moments.
If the score were determined by yard
age gains Stanford would have won
by a two-to-one ratio. The Cardinals
gained a total of 252 yards. U.S.C.
made 143 yards. Stanford made a total
of 14 first downs to Troy's 4. Stan
ford outgained, outpunted, and out
passed the Thundering Herd. In fact,
Stanford did everything but outplay
the winner, considering that the game
was won by scores, not statistics.
Warner Line Strong
The Warner line never played a
finer game. Every man on the forward
wall gave all he had. Heinecke out
played Barrager at center and was in
nearly every play on defense. Artman,
Post, Robesky, and Sellman provided
such a wall in the middle of the line
that the ends were able to play ex
ceptionally. wide.
Heinecke, Sellman, and Davidson
were the first down under punts and
made most of the tackles after Hoff
man's kicks. Davidson, replacing Har
der who wrenched his knee at the
start of the game, got his big chance
yesterday and as 80,000 fans will tes
tify, he made good in spite of a foot
fracture received on his third play.
Hoffman was not at par as a fullback;
he punted well and passed well, but
could not seem to hold the ball on
the reverse plays. Fleishhacker, Sims,
Wilton, Frentrup, Lewis, Smalling,
and Simkins all shone at intervals in
midfield. They were great on the de
fensive, and good on the offensive ex
cept when they approached the enemy
goal.
Williams, Saunders Star
Don Williams and Russ Saunders
were the big backfield stars of the
day. Aided by a powerful interference
these two men did nearly all ot the
gaining for the Herd. The Trojan
line, supposedly weakened by in
juries, gave no indication of weak
ness. Southern California's chief weak
ness was supposed to lie in their lack
of reserves. The starting Trojan team
stood up so well that Jones didn't
give the spectators a chance to see
this weakness in action.
The Trojans scored the lirst and
only touchdown of the game in the
second quarter. Hibbs intercepted a |
pass from Hoffman to give U.S.C. the
hall on Stanford's 36-yard line. The j
Trojans were unable to gain through ;
the line and fell back on a brilliant !
aerial attack.
Saunders passed to McCaslin for a
gain of 20 yards, putting the ball on
the 15-yard line. Williams gained two
yards and then received a pass from
Thomas that netted ten yards.
The ball was on the 3-yard line and
a determined Stanford team held |
U.S.C. valiantly for three downs. On
the fourth down Williams threw a 1
short pass to Saunders who fought
his way across the Stanford goal line.

Hoffman was not at par as a fullback;
he punted well and passed well, but
could not seem to hold the ball on
the reverse plays. Fleishhacker, Sims,
Wilton, Frentrup, Lewis, Smalling,
and Simkins all shone at intervals in
midfield. They were great on the de
fensive, and good on the offensive ex
cept when they approached the enemy
goal.
Williams, Saunders Star
Don Williams and Russ Saunders
were the big backfield stars of the
day. Aided by a powerful interference
these two men did nearly all ot the
gaining for the Herd. The Trojan
line, supposedly weakened by in
juries, gave no indication of weak
ness. Southern California's chief weak
ness was supposed to lie in their lack
of reserves. The starting Trojan team
stood up so well that Jones didn't
give the spectators a chance to see
this weakness in action.
The Trojans scored the lirst and
only touchdown of the game in the
second quarter. Hibbs intercepted a |
pass from Hoffman to give U.S.C. the
hall on Stanford's 36-yard line. The j
Trojans were unable to gain through ;
the line and fell back on a brilliant !
aerial attack.
Saunders passed to McCaslin for a
gain of 20 yards, putting the ball on
the 15-yard line. Williams gained two
yards and then received a pass from
Thomas that netted ten yards.
The ball was on the 3-yard line and
a determined Stanford team held |
U.S.C. valiantly for three downs. On
the fourth down Williams threw a 1
short pass to Saunders who fought
his way across the Stanford goal line.
Captain Jesse Hibbs converted an?
U.S.C. was leading 7-0.
The Cardinals had Don Williams
stopped through the line, but the
speedy Trojan runner carried back
one of Hoffman's punts 34 yards to
put the ball on Stanford's 26-yard
line near the end of the third quarter.
His run put the Trojans in a position
to score again.
After Saunders gained two yards,
he completed a pass to McCaslin for
twelve yards. The Trojans wanted
another touchdown but Williams could
add only one yard and Edelson five. !
The quarter ended with the ball on
the 8-yard line, and U.S.C. had two
downs in which to make this distance.
A pass, Thomas to Williams, fell in
complete. It was the last down. Cap
tain Jesse Hibbs dropped back and
hooted a place-kick to give U.S.C. j
three more points. Hibbs tried an
other place-kick later in the quarter
from a difficult angle, but missed.
Stanford opened up a passing at- i
tack but nothing happened in the way j

of scoring. It at least provided a few
| thrills for the fans, for a Warner
\ team is never beaten until the game
| is over.

Stanford's Red Host attacked the
stronghold of Troy Saturday with sut
ficient strength at times to have shat
tered its walls, only to be thrust back
by its own blunders when approaching
the objective. Breaks decided the
game, and on that account Warner's
unlucky warriors would offer an alibi.
But they won't because they provided
the breaks for the ever-alert Trojans
and they know that the breaks are a
factor of the game, not a foreign ele
ment.
The Cardinals had the power in the
middle of the field, but it did them
no good. Four times in the first half
they crashed their way through the
Trojans to threaten the Southern
California goal only to lose the ball by
fumbling reverse passes. The first two
periods of the game belonged to Stan
ford except at those critical moments.
If the score were determined by yard
age gains Stanford would have won
by a two-to-one ratio. The Cardinals
gained a total of 252 yards. U.S.C.
made 143 yards. Stanford made a total
of 14 first downs to Troy's 4. Stan
ford outgained, outpunted, and out
passed the Thundering Herd. In fact,
Stanford did everything but outplay
the winner, considering that the game
was won by scores, not statistics.
Warner Line Strong
The Warner line never played a
finer game. Every man on the forward
wall gave all he had. Heinecke out
played Barrager at center and was in
nearly every play on defense. Artman,
Post, Robesky, and Sellman provided
such a wall in the middle of the line
that the ends were able to play ex
ceptionally. wide.
Heinecke, Sellman, and Davidson
were the first down under punts and
made most of the tackles after Hoff
man's kicks. Davidson, replacing Har
der who wrenched his knee at the
start of the game, got his big chance
yesterday and as 80,000 fans will tes
tify, he made good in spite of a foot
fracture received on his third play.
Hoffman was not at par as a fullback;
