PARIS, Nov. 4. (/P) —The efforts of
the allied governments to couch in
identical terms their replies to Ger
many's note on the constitution of a
committee to discuss revision of the
Dawes Plan tor reparation payments,
occupied a busy day here.
Despite attempts to keep proceed
ings in the closest secrecy, it is un
derstood that a compromise has been
reached concerning the interpretation
of "independent" as applied to mem
bers of the committee, on which the
French and German viewpoints had
been reported at variance. Poincare
is said to have yielded to the extent
of abandoning his idea of appointing
government functionaries to the com
mittee although he is understood to
be adamant in providing the experts
with instructions on the minimum de
mands of France, below which they
would be unable to treat or bind the
French government. This position is
said to be acceptable to the others.
