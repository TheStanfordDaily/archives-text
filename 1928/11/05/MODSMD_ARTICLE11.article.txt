# NEWSPAPERS GIVE SOUSA INSPIRATION
## Ideas for Seventy of Famous Compositions of "March King" Furnished by Stories in Daily News 
### 
Daily newspapers furnished the in
spiration for more than seventy of
John Philip Sousa's 122 marches, ac
cording to that great composer. One I
of the first and best known of his ,
inarches was dedicated to a great j
newspaper, "The Washington Post."
Sousa saw in a Philadelphia paper
the announcement that the Liberty
llell was to be taken from Philadel- j
phia to the World's Fair in Chicago, 1
and lie wrote "Liberty Bell."
That (he American daily should be !
the greatest inspiration of the march
composer is quite understandable,
Sousa says. The march is distinctly
an American musical form and ex
pression of tho progress of America !
recorded day by day In the news- j
papers.
"The Stars and Stripes Forever,"
probably Sousa's most, famous march,
was a long time in establishing popu
larity with bands. It was first played

by Sousa in 1898 but with so many
lrills that the average band could not
play it. Sousa simplified the score,
i and it immediately became popular.
"The March King" was born in the
| American capital, and there studied
, the violin, being a boy-violinist at
Ford's Opera House where Lincoln
was assassinated. He was made an
understudy when the leader of the
orchestra became suddenly ill, and
was engaged a week later by Milton
| Nobles as musical director "on the
road." Since then Sousa has been
touring the country.
Tomorrow, which is not only elec
tion day, but also the seventy-fourth
birthday of the "March King," Sousa
1 will give two concerts in the Uasket
; ball Pavilion, one in the afternoon for
| school children of Palo Alto, and the
other in tho evening for those with
A.S.S.U. Concert Series tickets. Flec
tion returns will be announced be
tween numbers.
