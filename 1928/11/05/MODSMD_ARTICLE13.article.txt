# 'DEVIL IN CHEESE' DISTINGUISHED BY IMAGINATIVE SETS
## 
### 
Exceptionally colorful and preten
tious sets will distinguish next Fri
day night's performance of "The Devil
in the Cheese" from any play so far
produced on the Stanford stage. Har
old Helvenston and a large crew have
been working since rehearsals started
in perfecting sets which vary from
a 1210 A.l). Grecian monastery built
upon a mountain top, to what a young
girl imagines the interior of a yacht
to be like.
Realism as well as expressionism
will be employed here, particularly in
the first scene when it is necessary
to haul the members of the Quigley
family from the basement beneath
the stage up against a background of
biue sky, to Meteora Monastery, all
in a rickety-looking rope basket.
Because of the fantastic and im
aginative nature of Cushing's comedy,
appropriate and striking settings will
contribute very largely to effective
ness of the whole production. Varied
costuming also adds interest, and
these effects range from the vivid
green and gold of the little Egyptian
God Min to the correctly perfect uni
form of the somewhat startled Eng
lish butler. Grass skirts and evening
gowns, monks' dress and the Gre
cian national costume also have the'.f
part.
