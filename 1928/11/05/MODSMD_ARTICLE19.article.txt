# The 						Return of Herbert Hoover
## 
### 
A man whose achievements alone have placed him before the world
returns today to his alma mater where thirty-seven years ago lie entered
as a poor country boy, known only as a green freshman. Working his
way through Stanford, he graduated a mining engineer, weilt far afield
to win fame as an engineer, answered the call of his country when it
faced war, fed millions of starved, war-ridden people, entered the service
of his own government as Secretary of the Department of Commerce,
and now is prepared to fill the highest position his country can offer.
Stanford welcomes its most distinguished alumnus, Herbert Hoover, '95.
Whatever his political beliefs, whatever his feeling in the present cam
paign, there should be no Stanford student who cannot gain inspiration
from the life of Herbert Hoover, and therefore who should not join
wholeheartedly in today's welcome. No freshman ever entered Stanford
and worked harder or did more ignominious work to put himself through
college than did Herbert Hoover, nor has any Stanford student risen
as high in the affairs of the world as has this same freshman.
Whatever the future offers, the place of Air. Hoover will be one of
highest service to his countrymen. Whatever the outcome of the election,
it is certain that he will continue to be the man of staunch ideals, of high
minded purpose, and of never-failing inspiration to his associates. Stan
ford welcomes Herbert Clark Hoover, master engineer, humanitarian,
statesman, eminent alumnus.
