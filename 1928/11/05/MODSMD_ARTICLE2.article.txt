### 
"Stanford's passes had me uneasy.
For ruy team's sake 1 prefer to see
Stanford stick to straight power plays
rather than passes. You never can
tell what the Cards are likely to do
when they start throwing passes."
That's the way that Howard Jones,
coach of the victorious Trojans, ex
presses himself concerning the War
ner team's style of play Saturday.
Jones had only words of praise for
the Cardinal squad and its veteran
coach. "It was a clean, hard game
and of course we were glad to win it.
Every man played well. 1 particularly
hand it to Heinecke, liobesky, Wilton,
and Post. Captain Biff an All-Ameri
cun candidate? He's a great football
player and should make a strong bid
for it. I hope he does, for he's a
mighty fine boy."
