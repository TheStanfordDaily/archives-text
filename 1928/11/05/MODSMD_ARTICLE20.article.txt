# The 						Late Unpleasantness

University of Southern California 10, Stanford 0.
Such is the epitaph written today over the grave of Stanford's hopes
for an unblemished conference football record. It was carved irrevocably
by the deft hands of Howard Jones and eleven Trojan football warriors.
Those men of Troy are to be congratulated for winning a clean, hard
fought football game —a startling, complete upset. If ever a team and its
adherents were let down with a sudden and disconcerting thud, it was
.Stanford, and little remains to be said other than that which has been
said on the scoreboard of Los Angeles' white-pillared coliseum.
Thursday night and Friday hundreds of enthusiastic Cardinals fans
streamed to the southland. Yesterday and this morning they came back
to the Farm, dragging their blasted hopes behind them.
The Biltmore and the Grove were great, they say. The trip down
was a "wow."
The game?
That question causes the most sangitine Cardinal fan to close his eyes,
to smile a wan smile, and shudder.
And so it will be this week. Poignantly disappointed students will
gather in bull sessions to mull over the sickening defeat. In rooms blue
with smoke the late unpleasantness with Troy (as Ulysses might say)
will be re-lived.
Then there will be the business with Santa Clara and with the Wash
ington Husky—business which should be culminated successfully.
So in two weeks spirit will again reach a fever pitch on the Farm.
Troy will be forgotten, and Sons of the Stanford Red will be out for
the hide of California's Golden Bear.
Such is football, and such is youth.
Daily editorial tryoutees will meet at 7 o'clock tonight.
"California's Varsity football team," we read last week in the Daily
Californian, will get a taste of Pop Warner's highly touted "B" formation
before the Big Game this year. The Oregon eleven is using the Warner
system . .
Well, it sounds fishy to us.
