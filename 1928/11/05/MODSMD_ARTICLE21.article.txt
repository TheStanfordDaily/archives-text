The Gypsy. By W. B. Trites. (Fred
erick A. Stokes, New York, 1928).
Arthur Mallock, a middle-aged ar
tist, is in love with his wife, Julia
Mallock, even though she sits in cold
silence when he drinks too much
aguardiente in the evening. He is not
an habitual drinker, yet more and more
he finds it necessary to seek forget
fulness. For he is fifty and a failure.
Still he is so sure of his love for
his wife, that when he chances upon
an Andalusian gypsy of barbaric
beauty he immediately arranges to
have her pose for him.
His first, picture surpasses all of
his previous work. Another follows,
ihon a third, and Mallock becomes
famous. By this time, of course, the

gypsy has had her way with him, and
he marries her, even with the knowl
edge that she has poisoned his wife.
At this point the author begins to
have difficulties. After devoting the
first half of the book to plunging the
artist to the lowest possible level, and
succeeding rather well, lie gives him
self the task of making the unfortu
nate man's atonement equal to his
sin. In spite of the rather frightful
chapters that follow, he does not
seem to have achieved this. Even
when he makes a final effort in the
last, paragraphs to end his book on a
| note of unqualified and gripping tra
gedy, he misses fire, not far enough,
however, to spoil the general effect
of the book, which is favorable.
