Our Foolish Contemporary
Those who would commune witli
the muse of literature and the rowdy
few who would laugh read ".Palo Alto
Impressions" by one, John H. Still
will, litterateur and astute critic of
Stanford, its social, moral, intellectu
al, spiritual, and temporal customs,
affairs, and achievements. The emi
nent Mr. Stilwill writes you know,
oh, yes, for the Literary Keview, sup
plement of that first-rate sheet, the
Daily Californian. In fact, he wrote
for the last issue such a jolly good
article —clever, accurate, subtle. For
Mr. Stilwill is an astute man, you
know.
Mr. Stilwill visited Stanford once,
oh, of course he did. "i'was bitter
cold on Dumbarton Bridge Mr.
Wiltstill crossed to the Stanford side.
Then to find rest. "My, my, my,"
says Mr. Stilwill, "they lock up their
sheets." This doesn't mean anything,
nor does this, "We glad we wore
cords." But then these intelligentsia.
How sad, how dreadfully sad that
dear Mr. Stiltwilt was wakened after
such a hard night by a cowbell. You
see he doesn't understand that no
Stanford student could live without
his morning cowbell. Haven't you a
little cowbell in your home, Mr. Sil
wilt?
Later as Mr. Silitwilit came out of
the "Chapel," "Westminster Chimes"
struck eleven. Believe it or not, Mr.
Slilitwit, cross my heart I hope to
die, His Royal Highness George V
sent those chimes in exchange for a
pair of now extinct (according to Mr.
Siplewit) cords.
Let this gem of satire speak for

itself. "This is their other distinc
tive feature; their men and women.
The women need no comment, they
are unworthy of even an epitaph."
Ccme now, Mr. Stultwit, be generous.
Won't you grant them even a wee bit
of an epitaph, such as, Few but not
forgotten? No, untiringly he contin
ues, "But the men .... They stand
about everywhere chatting of incon
sequentialities, the same as we, but
their tone is different. They are nice
to each other, with a superficial
nicety." Fie, He, Mr. Splitwit. And
more, "They comb their hair the
same, wear the same kind of suits."
Such keen and careful observation.
Again our impressionist is impress
ed, "And activities. What resume of
college—any college—would be com
plete without a word concerning ac
tivities? Well, they have the Drama.
Two or three of them in fact. And
a glee club. And a newspaper—well,
anyway, they have a glee club." It
is rumored that the Daily Californian
will be published five times a week.
This increase in publication schedule
followed the tremendous demand for
contributions by a certain Mr. Jun
H. Snilwil.
And then the bomb, "We had a
DAMN SITE BETTER BREAKFAST
THAN I EVER ATE AT CALIFOR
NIA." At the Roost, no doubt, Mr.
Snifwif. Congratulations, as satirist,
critic, observer, commentator, and
not to omit, writer, you excel all of
our contemporaries; that is our fool
ish contemporaries. Thank you, we
are extremely glad to know that so
profound a mind has given us this
excellent picture of ourselves.
