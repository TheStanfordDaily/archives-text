The Editor, Sir: I
Of late the letters in "Campus j
Opinion" on the honor system have j
been mostly in favor of its repeal. |
Whether this is because there is a j
preponderance of opinion on the cam- |
pus in favor of repealing the honor
system, or because there is a small ;
minority in favor of repeal, but active
because they are in the minority, 1 do
not know. In either case, however, 1
feel that I must present tne other ;
side of the argument.
In the first place, let it be under- j
stood that 1 agree with Gooden and |
the "Law Grads" that the honor sys
tem in the past has not been reliance
upon the honor of students to secure i
fairness in examinations, but has j
been another, and inefficient, method
of enforcing fairness in examinations, j
Nevertheless, 1 believe it is better j
than the proctor system. A democ
racy is less e....cient than an aristoc
racy isles sel'ficient than an aristoc
advocate an aristocracy in the United
States on that basis? What Stanford
man or woman wants to be practi
cally searched before taking an exam
ination, watched like a criminal while
he is taking it, and not allowed to
leave the room during a four-hour ex
amination? Not one, 1 believe. Then,
we must improve the honor system.
To do this, we must find why it has
been so near a failure. It is because
we try to enforce it. We take a more
or less theoretical oath not to cheat

while in Stanford but it is at once j
tactlessly assumed that we will cheat. ,
The graders throw our papers out if !
they suspect us of cheating, we must
take alternate seats, and we run the
risk of being reported to the Student
Body Council if we try anything
shady. This is no less than an insult
to our honor. It is no wonder that
students, who from their first school
days have considered cheating as
more or less all right if they could
get away with it, develop a cynical
attitude toward the honor system at
Stanford when it is the same thing
they have always been used to, except
in name. What we should do is to
abolish all attempt to enforce it —
rely wholly upon honor for fairness
| in examination. A grader should not
throw out a paper or report the stu
; dent even if he saw him cheating,
j The student's implied word should
make black white. If this were the
case, Stanford men and women would
be forced for self-preservation to oust
from their society anyone who cheat
ed. It would certainly be a natural
thing to do even though necessity did
j not demand it. No one can tolerate
a person who cheats when cheating
! takes no deftness, only his implied
word that all is fair.
No one who trusts the word of
honor of a Stanford man or woman
can have doubts as to the success of
this plan. This sounds romantic, but
is nevertheless true.
