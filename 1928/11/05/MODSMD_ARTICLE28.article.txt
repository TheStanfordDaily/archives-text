Do read in the public prints much
discussion, mostly con, against the
honour system, and am much puzzled
why this alarm should now break
forth. A Mr. Uooden seems most up
set, in particular, and writes letters,
to the editor as though it were taken
for granted by everyone that viola
tions of the present method of taking
examinations were flagrant.

Do suppose I am fortunate in my
group of friends, for 1 have only ob
served the most honorable conduct in
the examinations and quizzes which
1 have attended. And do rather think
that the cleverest criminal in San
Quentin would have a difficult time
passing the exes I have had, for do
find that most of my instructors seem |

to have taken for granted any factual
knowledge I may have, and ask ques
tions that no amount of violating of
the Honour System would help. Also
do find it much pleasanter to take
quizzes in this existing manner, for
now one may borrow ink from one's
companion without asking permission
of the professor, as we must do in
high school.

Do not suppose that any perfect
system can be found, but with a uni
versity where high standards are very
rigidly upheld by tfie academic end,
do think if this system is satisfactory
to the professors, and that they have
adjusted themselves to it, it must he
fairly satisfactory. And if it creaks,
do suppose it is like a machine that
should be overhauled ever so often,
and the crankcase drained.

But what with all these serious
thoughts, do lind myself having a hard
time getting to my eight o clock in
the morning, and also straightening
my room, and making my bed. Does

vex me a little to think that men have
janitors in the Halls to perform this
service for them, and do wish most
heartily at times that a similar agency
would take care of mine — though.
Lord! do suppose it is part of a col
lege woman's training, and this keep
ing of my own room is the department
ot domestic sciences in the University.
Though do wish I could have hours
of directed credit for the time 1 spend
in domestic pursuits!
