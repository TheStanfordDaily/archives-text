# U.S.C. FRESHMEN WIN 12-0 VICTORY OVER CARD BABES
## Rintala Stars For Stanford; Pinckert Outstanding Among Trojans 
### PHILIP STOCKTON 
Power drives of the Southern Cali
fornia freshmen carried them to a
12-0 victory over a desperate resist
ance and several brilliant touchdown
threats by the Stanford team. The
first score came in the first quarter
-when Hall blockcd Phil Wilson's punt
and Mason recovered for Southern
California on the three-yard line.
Pinckert, S.C. quarterback, carried
the ball across for a touchdown. The
other tally came in the fourth quar
ter when Pinckert intercepted a Stan
ford pass and carried it 33 yards to
the Stanford 11-yard line. A few
bucks and a linal plunge by Musick
made the final score. S.C. again failed
to convert.
The Stanford team was throughout
the entire game a constant scoring
threat. The work of Rudy Rintala as
safety and offensive halfback was out
standing. Perhaps the finest play of
the game was Kintala's 50-yard return
of a punt through almost the entire
Trojan team to their ten-yard line,
only to have it called back on a minor
penalty. Time and again Trojan drives
were stopped by Stanford deep in
their own territory.
On the offense Stanford's gains
came mainly on reverses, and a pass
ing attack. Rintala, Toll, and Lambert
were the mainstays. It was Lambert,
substitute halfback, who made Stan
ford's final scoring threat late in the
fourth quarter. Receiving a short
pass, Lambert ran without interfer
ence to the Trojan 25-yard line, where
the power was lacking to make the
final push across the goal.
The play of Pinckert on the Trojan
squad was outstanding. It is quite
possible that Saturday's game was a
preview of another Howard Jones an
nual All-American quarterback pro
duction. On straight power plays
through the center of the line he con
sistently penetrated to the secondary
defense for five, eight, and fifteen
yard gains. Credit for this must be
given to the Trojan line which out
played the Cards during the entire j
contest, and to the superior teamwork ;
of the Southern California frosh, j
which was probably the deciding fac- j
tor in a closely fought game.

fourth quarter. Receiving a short
pass, Lambert ran without interfer
ence to the Trojan 25-yard line, where
the power was lacking to make the
final push across the goal.
The play of Pinckert on the Trojan
squad was outstanding. It is quite
possible that Saturday's game was a
preview of another Howard Jones an
nual All-American quarterback pro
duction. On straight power plays
through the center of the line he con
sistently penetrated to the secondary
defense for five, eight, and fifteen
yard gains. Credit for this must be
given to the Trojan line which out
played the Cards during the entire j
contest, and to the superior teamwork ;
of the Southern California frosh, j
which was probably the deciding fac- j
tor in a closely fought game.
Power drives of the Southern Cali
fornia freshmen carried them to a
12-0 victory over a desperate resist
ance and several brilliant touchdown
threats by the Stanford team. The
first score came in the first quarter
-when Hall blockcd Phil Wilson's punt
and Mason recovered for Southern
California on the three-yard line.
Pinckert, S.C. quarterback, carried
the ball across for a touchdown. The
other tally came in the fourth quar
ter when Pinckert intercepted a Stan
ford pass and carried it 33 yards to
the Stanford 11-yard line. A few
bucks and a linal plunge by Musick
made the final score. S.C. again failed
to convert.
The Stanford team was throughout
the entire game a constant scoring
threat. The work of Rudy Rintala as
safety and offensive halfback was out
standing. Perhaps the finest play of
the game was Kintala's 50-yard return
of a punt through almost the entire
Trojan team to their ten-yard line,
only to have it called back on a minor
penalty. Time and again Trojan drives
were stopped by Stanford deep in
their own territory.
On the offense Stanford's gains
came mainly on reverses, and a pass
ing attack. Rintala, Toll, and Lambert
were the mainstays. It was Lambert,
substitute halfback, who made Stan
ford's final scoring threat late in the
fourth quarter. Receiving a short
pass, Lambert ran without interfer
ence to the Trojan 25-yard line, where
the power was lacking to make the
final push across the goal.
