same hour, Percy A. Smith and Rob
ert O. Boyd will meet Ernest D. Wag
ner and Merrick W. Creagh in
Room 11, with Attorney A. J. Howe
of Palo Alto presiding.
All of the cases used are furnished
by the Moot Court Board, which is
composed of students in the Law
School. The form of procedure fol
lowed is that of the appellate courts.
Decisions in the cases are rendered
by attorneys and judges who are in
vited to preside.
Contestants are divided into two
groups, the tirst-year men in one, and
the second- and third-year men in the
other. In addition to the two groups
named, a third one, which is non
competitive, has been formed. Losers
in the regular competition are to join
the non-competitive group, in which
each team has one case a month. In
the main contests, the competition is
in tournament style, each team con
sisting of two men.
Last year the winners of the con
test in the older grouping, Edwin
Lloyd and Leon Brown, were awarded
a prize of $200, donated by Judge
Sloss of San Francisco. The runner
up team was given a set of Professor
Owens' Form Books, donated by Pro
fessor Owens and the University
Press. The winners of the first-year
competition, Stanley J. Cook and Den
nett Withington, won a $50 prize. The
board hopes to duplicate the awards
this year.
Members of the Moot Court Board
are: Robert Littler, chairman, Khoda
Lewis, Alfred Driscoll, John J. Ham
lyn, and Arthur Ilimbert.

A new sixty-inch reflcctor will be
