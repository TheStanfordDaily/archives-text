# UPSETS SUFFERED BY CHAMPIONSHIP GRID CONTENDERS
## Illinois, Stanford, New York Defeated in Saturday's Football Games 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 4. (JP)â€”Old Man
Upset, with an assist here and there
from Pop Weather, spilled the cham
pionship football of three of the fore
most contenders by way of celebrating
the start of the crucial November
gridiron campaign.
There were others who fell by the
wayside in the storm and strife of
yesterday's scramble for the slippery
oval but nowhere was the detonation
so terrific as that accompanying the
downfall of Illinois, 1927 Western
Conference champions, Stanford, pace
setters for the past two years on the
Pacific Coast, and New York Univer
sity, one of the East's mightiest ar
rays.
Illinois Beaten
Illinois was the victim of the Michi
gan Wolverine, which decided it had
been kicked around enough and broke
a losing streak of four straight with a
little booting of its own, the final
score being 3 to 0.
New York University's hitherto un
defeated eleven, squandering its op
portunities by inability to handle a
muddy ball, bowed to a Georgetown
team that cashed in on its big chance
to score and won 7 to 2, to keep its
own slate clean.
All to these reversals the overthrow
of the University of Texas hopes in
the Southwestern Conference by
Southern Methodist, plus the defeats
of Texas Christian and Clemson Col
lege, after each had won six straight
games, and Old Man Upset's main
accomplishments are about complete.
Bears Victorious
On the Pacific Coast, California, by
beating Oregon, 13 to 0, moved along
with Southern California. These two
are the only elevens unbeaten in con
ference competition but they fought
to a scoreless tie in their own engage
ment.
Other conference games ended as
expected. Oregon State rolled over a
weaker Montana team, 44-0, while
Washington State pounded Idaho into
submission under a 26-0 score. Wash
ington had no difficulty in swamping
College of Puget Sound, 40-0, in a non
conference game.
