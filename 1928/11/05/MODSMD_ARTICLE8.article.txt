### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 4. (>P) —In a
twenty-nine word statement, Gover
nor Alfred E. Smith tonight said that
the information in the possession of
Chairman John J. Raskob of the
Democratic National Committee clear
ly indicated Democratic success; the
announcement issued from the Gover
nor's suite at the Biltmore Hotel,
read:
"I just had a two-hour conference
with the chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.
"He reports that advices in his pos
session clearly indicate a Democratic
victory on Tuesday."
Smith With Family
NEW YORK, Nov. 4. (/P) —The
shouting and the tumult of the cam
paign is over and Alfred E. Smith
rested today with his family and his
friends in his suite at the Biltmore
Hotel. Except for two radio speeches
tomorrow, both to be delivered before
silent microphones in broadcasting
studios, his drive for the presidency
is at an end.
Tuesday, with millions of other
Americans, he will go to the polls and
cast his vote —and then, as the others
will do, he will await the counting of
the ballots.
Thunderous Ovation Given
His campaign drive came to a close
last night in Madison Square Garden,
where he faced his largest audience
of the campaign—a gathering of home
folks who cheered for 19 minutes be
fore they would let him say a word.
Before this crowd which overflowed
into the streets outside, the Demo
cratic nominee summed up into one
speech all the charges he had hurled
against his opposition since he took
the stump with his first formal ad
dress of the campaign at Omaha.
The Madison Square Garden ad
dress was his campaign valedictory
so far as appearing in person before
audiences is concerned. With all the
force at his command he ripped into
his political foes. He attacked Her
bert Hoover, his rival for the presi
dency, for what he said was a refusal
to enter into debate on the issues be
fore the nation and had his audience
shouting and applauding when he de
clared :
"We have had in this country, in
my opinion, about all we could stand
of the spokesman idea."
He wound up with the declaration
that his travels over the country led
him to "sincerely state to you that the
American people are alive to the
necessity for a change."
"They are enthusiastic for it," he
concluded, "and they are looking to
the Democratic party, and I am satis
fled that the overwhelming, reawak
ened sentiment of the American peo
ple will be reflected in complete Demo
cratic victory next Tuesday."
