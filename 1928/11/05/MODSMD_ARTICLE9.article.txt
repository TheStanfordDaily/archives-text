# Yankee Doodle In Mountain Crash; Two Fliers Dead
## Jams Against Side of Canyon In Arizona When Trying To Break Record 
### 
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Nov. 4. (/p) —The
monoplane Yankee Doodle, holder of
two transcontinental records, caught
in a blinding rain and fog in the
Bradshaw mountains last night,
jammed against the side of a wall in
Crook Canyon, 23 miles south of here,
and sent Captain C. B. Collyer, pilot,
and Harry Tucker, passenger and
owner, to their deaths.
The Yankee Doodle took off from
Mines Field, Los Angeles, yesterday
at 3:29 p.m. for a continuous journey
from the Pacific to the Atlantic.
While the pilot, Collyer, had stated
that pressing business engagements
demanded his presence there, he ad
mitted that he would attempt to bet
ter Goebel's mark of less than nine
teen hours for the trip.
Recently Broke Record
After establishing a new East-to-
West record recently in their Lock
heed Vega craft, Collyer and Tucker
said they would set about to make
a wholesale revision of aviation rec
ords.
The plane had just been released
from the factory where it underwent
a complete overhauling after the rec
ord trip from New York.
Reports received from the mine last
night said that the plane had circled
over a little cluster of mining pros
pectors' cabins in the vicinity about
7:30 o'clock. At that time the motor
was functioning with such irregu
larity that the condition was observed
by the miners.
The irregular purr of the machine
faded in the distance and the lights
were swallowed up in a misty rain.
Mountain Former Barrier
The Bradshaw Mountains, where
the plane fell, previously proved a
barrier to the Yankee Doodle in a
non-stop flight less than two months
ago. With Art Goebel, famous trans
oceanic aviator, at the controls, and
Tucker as a passenger, the Yankee
was forced down, 20 miles north of
Prescott, when the gasoline supply
became exhausted.
It was believed by members of the
sheriff's searching party, which found
the strewn wreckage late today, that
the craft had struck the canyon side
with a tremendous force and that the
heavy load of gasoline exploded with
the impact.
The open parachutes of the pilot
and the passenger indicated that the
pair, realizing their plight too late,
had made an effort to jump. Their
landing flares had also been released.

The Bradshaw Mountains, where
the plane fell, previously proved a
barrier to the Yankee Doodle in a
non-stop flight less than two months
ago. With Art Goebel, famous trans
oceanic aviator, at the controls, and
Tucker as a passenger, the Yankee
was forced down, 20 miles north of
Prescott, when the gasoline supply
became exhausted.
It was believed by members of the
sheriff's searching party, which found
the strewn wreckage late today, that
the craft had struck the canyon side
with a tremendous force and that the
heavy load of gasoline exploded with
the impact.
The open parachutes of the pilot
and the passenger indicated that the
pair, realizing their plight too late,
had made an effort to jump. Their
landing flares had also been released.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Nov. 4. (/p) —The
monoplane Yankee Doodle, holder of
two transcontinental records, caught
in a blinding rain and fog in the
Bradshaw mountains last night,
jammed against the side of a wall in
Crook Canyon, 23 miles south of here,
and sent Captain C. B. Collyer, pilot,
and Harry Tucker, passenger and
owner, to their deaths.
The Yankee Doodle took off from
Mines Field, Los Angeles, yesterday
at 3:29 p.m. for a continuous journey
from the Pacific to the Atlantic.
While the pilot, Collyer, had stated
that pressing business engagements
demanded his presence there, he ad
mitted that he would attempt to bet
ter Goebel's mark of less than nine
teen hours for the trip.
Recently Broke Record
After establishing a new East-to-
West record recently in their Lock
heed Vega craft, Collyer and Tucker
said they would set about to make
a wholesale revision of aviation rec
ords.
The plane had just been released
from the factory where it underwent
a complete overhauling after the rec
ord trip from New York.
Reports received from the mine last
night said that the plane had circled
over a little cluster of mining pros
pectors' cabins in the vicinity about
7:30 o'clock. At that time the motor
was functioning with such irregu
larity that the condition was observed
by the miners.
The irregular purr of the machine
faded in the distance and the lights
were swallowed up in a misty rain.
