Dear Sirs:
About two years ago I bought a tin
of Edgeworth tobacco. 1 was so
pleased with its slow-smoking qualities
and wonderful aroma that I became
an Edgeworth enthusiast and have
smoked no other tobacco since, al
though up to that time I think I can
truthfully say 1 had tried every well
known British mixture and (lake.
Moreover, I introduced one of the
other reporters to it. He in turn in
troduced another and he another until
finally it reached the News Editor.
There are now five of us all smoking
Edgeworth and enjoying it so much
that 1 thought you might like to have
this little appreciation of what, to
Britishers, is a comparatively un
known tobacco. I wish you every
succcss.
Yours faithfully,
