JEWELS FOR THE LADIES
Women adore jewelry, and it is al
ways an appropriate gift. Sometimes
it's a watch that is desired, another
time a ring, or some novelty bracelet.
Whatever is the requirement of the
moment, we shall be glad to help you
make the selection. The workman
ship on all pieces is exceptional, and
each piece is moderately priced.
