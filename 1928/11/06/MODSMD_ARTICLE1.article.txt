# SMITH MAKES FINAL APPEAL FOR ELECTION
## Al Seeks Support in Radio Campaign Valedictory; Urges Voting by Conscience 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 5 (JP). —Turning
to the radio to carry a final appeal to
the voters of the nation, Alfred E. Smith
declared tonight that he could "enter
upon the duties of the greatest office in
the world without commitment to any
body except the American people."
In his campaign valedictory specifically
prepared for delivery through the micro
phone to an unseen audience, the Demo
cratic nominee first reviewed in detail his
record in public life and then delivered
what he described as "my last spoken
Avord before the American people start
in the morning to make their decision."
"It is this," he said. "At no time dur
ing my long public career in elective
office did I ever trade a promise for a
"vote. I have made no promises to any
man or to any group of men. Nobody
-was authorized to make any promises
for me, and in fact, none has been made.
"I can enter upon the duties of the
greatest office in the world without com
mitment to anybody except the American
people. I can enter upon the duties of
that great office with a mind single to
the best interest of this country.
Duty to Vote
"It is the duty of every American citi
zen, man or woman, to vote according to
the dictates of conscience, solely upon
the basis of what he or she believes to
be for the best interest of the country j
itself and not upon the basis of any pas- j
sion or any prejudice. Any man or worn- j
an or any group casting a ballot for any i
other reason except the welfare of the !
country is doing what they possibly can i
to negative the whole theory of Demo-1
cratic government.
"For six or seven weeks, as the Demo- j
cratic candidate for the presidency of the !
United States, I have been traveling!
throughout this country. I have spoken
to the American people on every itnpor- i
taut question that is pressing the country |
for solution. Within the limit of my;
ability I have endeavored to state my po- j
.sition and the position of my party on ;
the issues presented in this campaign ■
clearly and concisely."
The governor said he was "no stran
ger" to public office, and recalled he had
been a candidate for elective office twen- i
ty times and had been successful upon
every occasion but one.
Thanks Workers
Citing that many legislative proposals
as well as constitutional amendments had
been enacted during his administration, 1
the governor declared many of these had j
been brought about as a result of his l
having made a direct appeal to the pco
pie of the state. He added that nearly ;
every "constructive reform" must be ac- :
companied by law and this meant the
executive must possess the traits of lead- j
ership that make "it possible for him to
get along with people."
" 1 he American people will never stand I
for a dictator," he declared, "any more
than they arc today satisfied and con- [
tented with a policy of silence."
The nominee before concluding took |
•occasion to thank all party workers for
the part they had taken in the campaign.
