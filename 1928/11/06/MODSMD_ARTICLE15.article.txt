STANFORD'S MOST FAMOUS SON, Herbert Hoover, is home. Some ten
thousand cheering people, including practically the entire Stanford student
body, thronged the station nearly an hour before the nominee's special train
I arrived, eagerly waiting a glimpse of the man whose destiny the nation
decides today.
As the train neared the depot the Stanford Band struck up "Come Join the
Band," leading the singing of the crowd. When Mr. Hoover stepped out on
| the observation platform, the cheering swelled to a deafening roar.

Overhead, Norman Uoddard dropped
j bombs which burst into parachutes
| flying flags ot' all nations, and followed
I the course of the procession with a
smoke trail.
Hoover Pleased
Hoover appeared genuinely pleased
at the reception given him by his
Alma Mater. Despite the strain oÂ£

a calm assurance of victory.
After appearing briefly before the
crowd, Hoover was driven up i J alni
