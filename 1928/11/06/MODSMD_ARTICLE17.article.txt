# "DEVIL IN CHEESE" PROMISES TO BE COMEDY SKETCH
## 
### 
"She's put a cupboard in the mast!"
exclaims Joseph Quigley when he
sees his (laughter Goldina's mental
picture of a yacht on his visit to her
mind in the second act of Tom Cush
ing's play, "The Devil in the Cheese,"
which will be presented Friday night
in the Assembly Hall.
"Why not?" answers the little God
Min of Egypt, who has satisfied Quig
ley's curiosity concerning his daugh
ter's thoughts after being liberated
by the American millionaire from an
amphora where he had been impris
oned for three thousand years. "She's
imagining scenes of which she knows
nothing! Why shouldn't she'.'"
Discovers New World
The world through Goldina's eyes
turns out to be a strange combination
of scenes and events. While feeding
the goldiish in her eager and enthusi
astic way, Goldina discovers big
waves in the bowl. Her sympathy for
(he goldiish in the "heavy sea com
ing" overwhelms her, and impulsively
she flies to secure two glasses of "Sea
Sick Remedy" and pours it into the
bowl.
Has Vivid Imagination
One of (he most peculiar twists of
her imagination is seen in her picture
of her husband, Jimmie Chard, as a
lisherman. The two of them are
spending their honeymoon on the
yacht with the cupboard in the mast;
she cooks, and he brings in the iish.
As she is preparing a delectable meal,
for Goldina in her own eyes is the
most wonderful of cooks, Jimmie ap
pears, full of the excitement of the
chase, with a huge throbbing silver
lish in a butterfly net. "Flying tish!"
exclaims Jimmie to his adoring little
wife. "Had to chase him half way up
the mast."
Seals for the play are now on sale
at the Old Union.
