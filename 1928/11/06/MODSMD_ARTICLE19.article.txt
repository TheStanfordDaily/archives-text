! PRECOTT, Ariz., Nov. 5. (JP) —
i Wings that strained once too often
in the urge for speed today hung in
shreds on the gnarled trees of an Ari
zona canyon side, marking the death
place of the brave pair that rode the
gallant but ill-fated shot in aviation's
| unending war on time and space,
j The bodies of those two who Sat
i urday afternoon started eastward on
j their attempted transcontinental hop
ias blithe and light in spirit as the
name of their big monoplane, "Yankee
Doodle," yesterday rode on burros'
backs over the rought mountain trails
to this city. The silken folds of the
parachutes they perhaps attempted to
use too late swathed the crash and
explosion mangled bodies of the two
fliers, Captain C. B. 1). Collyer, famed
, at the pilot in a record-breaking gird
! ling of the globe, and Harry Tucker,
; owner and passenger of the Yankee
j Doodle.
Bodies of Tucker and Collyer with
j their parachutes opened and connect-
I cd to them, were found 300 feet away
from the spot where the plane
! plunged into the hill, apparently hav
j ing been thrown forward as were the
j heavier motor parts by the impact and
j the blast.
