# Still More On An Inexhaustible Topic

A chill feeling overtook the Stanford rooters at the U.S.C. game when
the Trojan section swarmed in front of the red-capped horde in order to
give its victory yells. Saturday was the first day any member of the
present undergraduate classes had had to endure a serpentine by a Big
Three opponent. Be it known that we are the official mouthpiece of the
student body when we say we don't like it and hope we shan't have to
undergo it soon again.
A fine spirit of sportsmanship was shown by both Stanford and
U.S.C. Of course, it was easier for U.S.C. to be sportsmanlike, because
its team won a game which it was supposed to lose. The Stanford men,
on the other hand, were intensely glum over the outcome, and it is to
their credit that they took their beating like gentlemen, both at the Col
iseum and later at the post-game festivities.
Shocked citizens of Ix>s Angeles commented on the fact that the Stan
ford boys booed the speeches by Governor Young and William M. Gar
land in favor of Proposition Two. The necessity of persuading every
vote possible for the Olympic Games bond issue was so pressing, it
seemed, that there was nothing to be done but let the Governor and Mr.
Garland utilize the Coliseum's Tower of Babel in a vain effort to broad
cast their "message." Little criticism should rightfully go to the rooters
for booing that which, in the first place, they could not hear and which,
in the second place, they cared not at all to hear. The Coliseum is too
thoroughly commercialized as it is, with hot dog, lollypop and crackerjack
vendors continually winding their tortuous ways through the crowded
aisles. An effort ought to be made to introduce some Spartan simplicity
into the Trojan carnivals.
One of the game's results which we should like to see squelched is
the whispering campaign being conducted against the team. "\\ by didn't
they pass? Who called the reverses on the three-yard line? I understand
the fellows haven't any confidence in So-and-So." Grandstand criticism
is an easy vice to indulge, but much of it is demoralizing to the team,
which is probably as aware as any given group of the fact that it was
beaten and of the reasons why. The Trojans played one of the finest
games in the history of U.S.C. football. They earned their victory; con
cede them it; and leave it to the Frank Hylands to allocate the blame.

they pass? Who called the reverses on the three-yard line? I understand
the fellows haven't any confidence in So-and-So." Grandstand criticism
is an easy vice to indulge, but much of it is demoralizing to the team,
which is probably as aware as any given group of the fact that it was
beaten and of the reasons why. The Trojans played one of the finest
games in the history of U.S.C. football. They earned their victory; con
cede them it; and leave it to the Frank Hylands to allocate the blame.
A chill feeling overtook the Stanford rooters at the U.S.C. game when
the Trojan section swarmed in front of the red-capped horde in order to
give its victory yells. Saturday was the first day any member of the
present undergraduate classes had had to endure a serpentine by a Big
Three opponent. Be it known that we are the official mouthpiece of the
student body when we say we don't like it and hope we shan't have to
undergo it soon again.
A fine spirit of sportsmanship was shown by both Stanford and
U.S.C. Of course, it was easier for U.S.C. to be sportsmanlike, because
its team won a game which it was supposed to lose. The Stanford men,
on the other hand, were intensely glum over the outcome, and it is to
their credit that they took their beating like gentlemen, both at the Col
iseum and later at the post-game festivities.
Shocked citizens of Ix>s Angeles commented on the fact that the Stan
ford boys booed the speeches by Governor Young and William M. Gar
land in favor of Proposition Two. The necessity of persuading every
vote possible for the Olympic Games bond issue was so pressing, it
seemed, that there was nothing to be done but let the Governor and Mr.
Garland utilize the Coliseum's Tower of Babel in a vain effort to broad
cast their "message." Little criticism should rightfully go to the rooters
for booing that which, in the first place, they could not hear and which,
in the second place, they cared not at all to hear. The Coliseum is too
thoroughly commercialized as it is, with hot dog, lollypop and crackerjack
vendors continually winding their tortuous ways through the crowded
aisles. An effort ought to be made to introduce some Spartan simplicity
into the Trojan carnivals.
One of the game's results which we should like to see squelched is
the whispering campaign being conducted against the team. "\\ by didn't
they pass? Who called the reverses on the three-yard line? I understand
the fellows haven't any confidence in So-and-So." Grandstand criticism
