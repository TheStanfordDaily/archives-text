# Dangers Beset The Conference Party
## 
### 
The Conference Party will be held tomorrow night for the purpose
of providing a general meting of all campus women. Although it has
already been twice postponed this quarter, the A.W.S. rules state that
"one social gathering of the women students shall be held at the beginning
of each year to welcome entering women." Consequently, though mid
quarters are well upon us, the affair must take place tomorrow.
The party will be of special importance this year, for there will be an
open discussion of the honor system. The party is in part to take the
place of the regular women's assembly, as the latter cannot be held this
year, no date being available.
Each quarter when the day comes around, the women arc loath to at
tend the party. Yet they continue going on the recommendations of their
living groups. The Conference Party provides the only opportunity at
which all old women may meet all new ones. They are able to become
acquainted particularly during the dancing. However, as it happens it
is only the few freshmen who meet any number of the older women, be
cause of the grand onslaught of pre-season rushing that takes place.
Sisters of some particular sorority have their eyes on a few likely nuggets,
and these are passed around from hand to hand, or fought over by mem
bers of rival groups. As a result the party degenerates into a Freshman-
Row affair, where a small number of the new women have a glorious
time, and the rest come home unhappy.
Each time living groups resolve that no rushing shall take place, and
each time these good resolutions go by the boards. This year more seri
ous consideration was given to the question, but Conference again decided
that there would be dancing at the party.
If the party can be conducted tomorrow night in such a manner that
there is no rushing, then it will be possible for all women to become ac
quainted, and for all to enjoy themselves. If, on the other hand, the
customary rushing is indulged in, it is to be recommended that the
dancing be discontinued, and if this is not satisfactory, that the A.W.S.
rules be changed in order to do away altogether with the party.
