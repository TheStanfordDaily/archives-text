# They Would Be College Men in This Day

### 
At a dinner in New York to seven pioneers of American industry—
Thomas A. Edison, Henry Ford, Orville Wright, George Eastman, Tlar
vey S. Firestone, Julius Rosenwald and Charles M. Schwab — Mr.
Schwab pointed out that not one of the seven had a college education.
What he omitted was that all of them were over 60 years old. In the
generation now growing up a college education is open, regardless of
poverty or antecedents, to every young man of even a tenth the energy,
charactcr and ability of these men. If they had been born in this genera
tion all of them would probably have gone to college. The young man
of today, not at the top merely, but everywhere above the bottom, is
going to compete in a college-bred world.
—Chester Kovvell in the S. F. Chronicle.
The editorial staff of the Daily will meet today at 1 o'clock, and the
editorial tryoutee staff at 7 o'clock.
