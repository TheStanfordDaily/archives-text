THE KINGSMILLS AND

Birth control was formerly a much
more moot issue than it is today. Now
and then a preacher will maul the whole
idea unmercifully of a Sunday, or some
self-appointed martyr with Carrie Nation
tenacity, distributing birth-control litera
ture, will be unceremoniously jugged. But
on the whole, Prohibition and other
itions and isms have overshadowed this
one-time important source of argument.
The campaign for dissemination of
birth control information failed pretty
dismally throughout the country. One of
the chief non-sectarian arguments ad
vanced against it was that it would result
in proportionate decrease of the middle
and upper-class population, while the pro
portion of "undesirable" citizens would
increase dangerously.
Oddly, in spite of victory for oppo
nents of the question, the above-stated
condtion has come to pass. The Kings
mills of Park Avenue have easy access
to bootleg liquor and bootleg limitation
information; the Kronstadts, who reside
in the Bronx have a pretty tough time
even to get small quantities of the for
mer. The result is that there are con
siderably fewer . young Kingsmills who
ride horseback of a morning in Central
Park, than there are small Kronstadts
who admire the lions in the Bronx Zoo.
Th c obvious remedy would be for "re
ligion" and "morality" to retire once
more from just another of those numer
ous conspiracies which they have formed,
since the beginning of the Dark Ages, to
check the progress of civilization.
Anyone who thinks that Mrs. Kron
stadt, who spends her days washing and
ironing and cooking for a husband and
seven children, welcomes the prospect of
another young Kronstadt to crowd the

flat unbearably and heighten the frightful
tuinnla of family life—is just plain crazy.
As for papa Kronstadt, he lias long since
discovered that his eldest will not toler
i ate the seizure of all his wages for the
j purpose of a sinking-fund to help build
! the future Kronstadt mansion; he has
discovered also that, in the American
social scheme, the latest three or four are
I merely nuisances.
Pretty Irma Kronstadt, who does a
| mean Varsity Drag behind the counter
of the Five and Ten, views with very lit
tle joy the prospect of a third generation
of Kronstadts—at least, until there can
Ibe definite assurance that the Varsity
Drag, the silk hose, and the three-a-week
movies would not be jeopardized thereby.
As for the first and second generations
of Kingsmills, they enjoy sufficient lei
sure and food and education, and the
raising of young Kingsmills can be, for
them, an absorbing sort of game instead
of a punishment. It is safe to say that,
with those Kingsmills who have the char-
I acter that a Kingsmill usually has, the
proportion will never suffer.
Well, there you are—and the whole
thing would be settled if good people
would only give up stubborn and futile
search and discover that their noses are
, perched right on the front of th c ir faces,
i A good lady wrote an indignant letter
to the San Francisco Chronicle some time
ago, in which she stated that daylight
saving time is plasphemy—there being
nothing said in the Bible about setting
clocks an hour ahead.
It is also blasphemous, though encour
aging, to think that some day all little
boys and girls will possess, along with
many other advantages which an enlight
ening age can give them, the additional
| virtue of being wanted.
