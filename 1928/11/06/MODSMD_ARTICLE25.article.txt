# Campus Opinion

Dear Editor, Sir:
Not having any complaint about the
honor system or editorial interpretation
of the "Bawlout," 1 should like to make
a suggestion that can be taken for what
it is worth. Would it not be possible for
the Daily to publish the words of the
new song introduced to the student body
this week? Incidentally, many persons
would undoubtedly be gratified to learn
the verses of all the other Stanford songs
through the medium of the Daily's col
umns.

The Editor, Sir:
Of late the letters in "Campus Opin
ion" on the honor system have been
mostly in favor of repeal. Whether this
is because there is a preponderance of
opinion on the campus in favor of repeal
ing the honor system, or because there is
a small minority in favor of repeal, but
active because they are in the minority,
I do not know. In cither case, however,
I feel that I must present the other side
of the argument.
In the first place, let it be understood
that I agree with Goodeti and both the
"Law Grads" that the honor system in
the past has not been reliance upon the
honor of students to secure fairness in
examinations, but has been another, and
inefficient, method of enforcing fairness
in examinations. Nevertheless, I believe
it is better than the proctor system. A
democracy is less efficient than an aris
tocracy in the United States on that
basis. What Stanford man or woman
wants to be practically searched before
taking ail examination, watched like a
criminal while he is taking it, and not
allowed to leave the room during, say a ,

| four-hour examination? Not one, I be
lieve. Then, we must improve the honor
system.
To do this we must find why it has
been so near a failure. It is because we
try to enforce it. We take a more or
less theoretical oath not to cheat while
in Stanford, but it is at once tactlessly
assumed that we will cheat. The graders
throw our papers out if they suspect us I
of cheating, we must take alternate seats, j
and we run the risk of being reported to
the Student Body Council if we try any
thing shady. This is no less than an in
sult to our honor. It is no wonder that
students, who from their first school
days have considered cheating as more
or less all right if they could get away 1
with it, develop a cynical attitude toward
the honor system at Stanford, when it
is the same thing they have always been
used to, except in name. What we should
do is to abolish all attempt to enforce
it —rely wholly upon honor for fairness
in examinations. A grader should not
throw out a paper or report the student
even if he saw him cheating. The stu
dent's implied word should make black
white. If this were the case, Stanford
men and women would be forced for
self-preservation to oust from their so
ciety anyone who cheated. It would cer
tainly be a natural thing to do even
though necessity did not demand it. No
one can tolerate a person who cheats
when cheating takes no deftness, only
his implied word that all is fair.
No one who trusts the word of honor
of a Stanford man or woman can have
doubts as to the success of this plan.
This sounds romantic, but is nevertheless
true.
