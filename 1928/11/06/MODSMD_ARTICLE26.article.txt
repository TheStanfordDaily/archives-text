"The Squall"—Geary.
When Nubi, the runaway gypsy girl,
staggers from out of the squall into the
Mendez house, the Love gerin starts
functioning—with most disastrous ef
fects. Pedro, the man-servant, is the
first to forget his betrothed for the
charming Nubi. Juan, the handsome son
of the household, is soon madly in love
with her. And eventually Papa Mendez
is vamped, too.
Warm Spanish passion—that's the es
sence of "The Squall." The action takes
place in the colorful living room of the
Mendez home in Quejano, near Granada.
The actors dress in beautiful Latinish
costumes, and bring the audience com
pletely under their sway. The one set
ting is remarkably well done—and the
sun and rain effects glimpsed through
the door and windows is most realistic.
Advertised as the "most daring play
ever presented," this show does its best
to live up to its motto. It is certainly i
"hot," but at no time is it vulgar.
Perhaps its melodramatic story is put '
over by the excellency of the actors. Miss !
Bertha Mann is a beautiful and sympa
thetic mother. Without a fine actress in
this role, the play would fall flat. Her !
efforts to save her home from the Gyp-1

sy's lure arc very appealing.
Charles Brokaw is (lie romantic young
Juan. He is an unusually good choice
for the role—being very good-looking,
and playing the part for all it's worth.
Mr. Brokaw was last seen here with
Jane Cowl in "The Road to Rome."
Suzanne Caubaye plays Nubi—making
her a heartless, yet alluring flirt. Grayce
Hayle as the gossipy Dona Paca scores
a lot of laughs. Giappel Dossctt seems
rather old for the father role, but lie
does it well.
