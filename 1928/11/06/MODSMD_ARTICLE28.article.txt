So to the station today, to watch Mr.
Hoover come home. Did walk most con
spicuously where policemen told me not
to, so did get pushed back into the front
line of the crowd, where 1 never could
have broken through in the ordinary
course of events. So did see Mr. Hoover
quite closely, and did find myself enor
mously thrilled, for whether one is a
Republican or a Democrat, it is most ex
citing to see a great man. Home through
great quantities of traffic, thinking about
the domestic science course 1 did have
in grammar school, where I was taught 1
to make plum pudding out of carrots, i
and about Hooverizing, and what with
being most weary, did fall to napping.
Did dream that Sousa closed his con
cert tomorrow by marching his band up
to Mr. Hoover's house, and the rally ;
committee did carry the staute of lsis, j
which Belgians did present to Mr. Hoo-1
ver, from the library up the San Juan !
| Hill, on their back, and that a Certain |
j Student complained that this proved the
University was partisan, and so was
awakened by a handsome policeman tell
j ing me in an ugly manner to move on.
* * *
To my eight o'clock this morning in i
I the same clothcs in which I did leave
j Los Angeles after church yesterday, but \
! did find much difficulty in walking for ;
do think my knees have a permanent I
wave from the suitcases I was on such j
intimate terms with in the back seat of
the car all yesterday. Have decided 1 j
shall not make any comment upon the
game Saturday in my diary. Do think,
however, it was most courteous of the
Auto Club of Southern California to put j
red S's on the curves of the main high- '
way, and did notice that nearly all the
cars slowed down to observe them.
* * *
So did think it a grand week-end in
spite of some athletic discrepancies, and '
j did enjoy a walk through the exposition !
! arboretum of U.S.C., what with all the j
; pretty striped buildings, and the baby !
I Campanile, southern style. Am glad I j
! went South, for did see a great number I
| of people from here, but was sorry that i
j many of them seemed very sleepy Satur- j
day night, and not able to recognize me.

To my eight o'clock this morning in i
I the same clothcs in which I did leave

do think my knees have a permanent I
wave from the suitcases I was on such j
intimate terms with in the back seat of
the car all yesterday. Have decided 1 j
shall not make any comment upon the
game Saturday in my diary. Do think,
however, it was most courteous of the
Auto Club of Southern California to put j
red S's on the curves of the main high- '
way, and did notice that nearly all the
cars slowed down to observe them.

So did think it a grand week-end in

j many of them seemed very sleepy Satur- j
day night, and not able to recognize me.

So to the station today, to watch Mr.
Hoover come home. Did walk most con
spicuously where policemen told me not
to, so did get pushed back into the front
line of the crowd, where 1 never could
have broken through in the ordinary
course of events. So did see Mr. Hoover
quite closely, and did find myself enor
mously thrilled, for whether one is a
Republican or a Democrat, it is most ex
citing to see a great man. Home through
great quantities of traffic, thinking about
the domestic science course 1 did have
in grammar school, where I was taught 1
to make plum pudding out of carrots, i
and about Hooverizing, and what with
being most weary, did fall to napping.
