# STANFORD GOOFS WILL MEET U.C. GRAYS, SAN JOSE
## 
### 
Stanford Grays will meet San Jose
Teachers' varsity tomorrow afternoon in
the first of two hard games scheduled
for the week. Saturday they will line
up against the California goofs as a pre
liminary to the Little-Big Game in the
Berkeley Stadium.
In the mid-week contest, the Grays will
meet a heavier and more experienced
team and will probably find some diffi
culty in carrying off the honors. Con
sidering the amount of material available
for a football team, the teachers have
built up a stout outfit and are said to
have a strong offense.
If the Grays pull through the first
game successfully, they are then faced
with the task of preparing for a tougher
fray; for the Bear reserves will be fight
ing hard for a victory. From the stand
point of experience and weight, both out
fits are pretty evenly balanced, but the
Bears will have the advantage of a
week's rest.
Coach Ernie Nevers has spent the last
few practice sessions in teaching the
Grays a series of new tricks and pass
plays, all of which are run from a punt
formation. Speed and deception are es
sential to these plays.
The same team that showed up so well
against the Saint reserves a week ago
Saturday will start again Wednesday.
Moffat and May will probably bear the
burden of the ball carrying, while Bill
Laird should get a chance to perform.
Moffat has shown startling possibilities
as a ground gainer, and has been the
most consistent player in the Gray back
field this year.
