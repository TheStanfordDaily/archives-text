# THREE PORTRAITS ADDED TO BOTANY ART COLLECTION
## Pictures of Eminent U.C., Stanford Naturalists Are Shown in Display 
### 
Three valuable additions have been
made to the collection of portraits of
eminent naturalists, which is hung in
the library of the Department of Bot
any.
Two of them—one of Professor Wil
lis Linn Jepson of L.C. and the other
of Dr. Douglas H. Campbell, professor
emeritus of Stanford —are black and
white originals by Peter Van Val
kenburgh, the latter having been pur
chased out of the 1928 income from
the Campbell Fund for Promotion of
Botanical Science.
The last addition is a portrait of
S. I. Kuwana, a Stanford graduate
of about thirty years ago. He is now
one of the leading entomologists of
Japan and is in charge of the fruit
and nursery quarantine operations.
Begin Collection in 'CO
This collection, which is deserving
of more than local recognition, was
started in 1906, the year of the earth
quake, and has grown since then
largely clue to the efforts of Professor
George James Pierce, of the Botany
Department. As many of the portraits
as possible are obtained in other than
photograph form, since Professor
Pierce considers engravings, prints,
and etchings to have greater perma
nency.
Charles Darwin, an India proof of
the etching by Flameng from the
painted portrait of Collier, is in a
group including the portraits of his
father, his grandfather, and his son,
all eminent scientists, and also Alfred
R. Wallace, a contemporary and
friend of Darwin who abandoned his
own theory of evolution to leave the
field free for the author of the "Ori
gin of Species."
Give Human Quality
Other portraits include a steel en
graving of Sir Joseph Hooker, seated
in a Himalayan landscape; a mezzo
tint of Humboldt, in his shirtsleeves
under a banana tree; an engraving
of Linnaeus, dated 1779; an artist
proof wood engraving of Asa Gray;
and two gifts of W. T. Sedgwick's
v, idow —an engraving of Harvey and
a photograph of Sedgwick himself.
In the opinion of Professor Pierce,
"The presentation "of the faces and
features of the men who make science
gives to it a human quality which
those who are beginning to devote
themselves to it should not miss."

the etching by Flameng from the
painted portrait of Collier, is in a
group including the portraits of his
father, his grandfather, and his son,
all eminent scientists, and also Alfred
R. Wallace, a contemporary and
friend of Darwin who abandoned his
own theory of evolution to leave the
field free for the author of the "Ori
gin of Species."
Give Human Quality
Other portraits include a steel en
graving of Sir Joseph Hooker, seated
in a Himalayan landscape; a mezzo
tint of Humboldt, in his shirtsleeves
under a banana tree; an engraving
of Linnaeus, dated 1779; an artist
proof wood engraving of Asa Gray;
and two gifts of W. T. Sedgwick's
v, idow —an engraving of Harvey and
a photograph of Sedgwick himself.
In the opinion of Professor Pierce,
"The presentation "of the faces and
features of the men who make science
gives to it a human quality which
those who are beginning to devote
themselves to it should not miss."
Three valuable additions have been
made to the collection of portraits of
eminent naturalists, which is hung in
the library of the Department of Bot
any.
Two of them—one of Professor Wil
lis Linn Jepson of L.C. and the other
of Dr. Douglas H. Campbell, professor
emeritus of Stanford —are black and
white originals by Peter Van Val
kenburgh, the latter having been pur
chased out of the 1928 income from
the Campbell Fund for Promotion of
Botanical Science.
The last addition is a portrait of
S. I. Kuwana, a Stanford graduate
of about thirty years ago. He is now
one of the leading entomologists of
Japan and is in charge of the fruit
and nursery quarantine operations.
Begin Collection in 'CO
This collection, which is deserving
of more than local recognition, was
started in 1906, the year of the earth
quake, and has grown since then
largely clue to the efforts of Professor
George James Pierce, of the Botany
Department. As many of the portraits
as possible are obtained in other than
photograph form, since Professor
Pierce considers engravings, prints,
and etchings to have greater perma
nency.
Charles Darwin, an India proof of
the etching by Flameng from the
painted portrait of Collier, is in a
