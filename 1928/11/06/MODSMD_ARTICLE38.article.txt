## 
### 
After fighting and playing the U.S.C.
freshmen to a standstill last Saturday
and then losing 12 to 0 because of
bad breaks, the Cardinal yearlings
are in for a week of intensive prepa
ration for the Little Big Game with
the California Cubs next Saturday at
Berkeley.
Husky Hunt brought his men out of
the U.S.C. game somewhat battered
but uninjured. Quite a number of re
serves got into this game, and among
them Quirk, at center, looned particu
larly good. The pivot position has
been the weak spot of the line all
year.
Though playing a great defensive
game Saturday, the Card line did not
charge fast enough on the offensive
to make some plays effective. This
week's line practice probably will be
on this phase.
