# QUARTER TURNS BACK TO FORDHAM CENTER
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 5. (/P) â€”Frank
Cavanaugh, Fordham coach, has de
cided that in the future the Fordham
quarterback shall stand back to back
with the center and facing the rest
of the backfield. The center will pass
the ball in the customary manner.
The ball then will travel through the
quarterback's legs into his hands.
Cavanaugh explains that the scheme
adds deception to the attack, keeping
the ball screened from opposition. If
the quarterback wants to forward
pass Cavanaugh thinks he can move
back from the line of scrimmage fast
er in this new position than he could
before when he had to back up. Ford
ham plays West Virginia at the Polo
Grounds tomorrow.
