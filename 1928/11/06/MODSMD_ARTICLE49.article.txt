# MRS. HOOVER IS LAUDED FOR HER MANY ABILITIES
## Irwin Calls Nominee's Wife As Much a Personage As Her Husband 
### S. W 
Gracious, poised, intelligent, and
capable, Mrs. Herbert Hoover is an
eminent alumna of Stanford Univer
sity. In the words of Will Irwin, Lou
Henry Hoover, with her brains, her
personality, and her large understand
ing, is as much a personage as her
husband.
She has achieved recognition on her
own merit, being chairman of the
Board of Directors of the National
Girl Scouts and member of the Ameri
can Association for the Advancement
of Science, the National Geographic
Society, the Royal Scottish Geo
graphic Society, and others.
Dr. David Starr Jordan has called
her "one of the clearest-minded wo
men he has ever known." As a girl
in high school at Monterey, Lou
Henry heard Dr. John Caspar Branner
give a geology lecture. Her imagina
tion was lired and she immediately
decided to go to Stanford where she
could study geology under Branner.
As a freshman Lou Henry met the
"great Hoover," as he was known on
the campus after his creating and
writing the A.S.S.U. constitution
which with minor changes rules the
student body of Stanford today. Ac
cording to Charlotte Kellogg, the Hoo
ver romance is one of the best argu
ments for co-education known to her.
When Hoover graduated in '95, the
two had come to an "understanding."
Since her marriage Mrs. Hoover has
made her home all over the world.
She has traveled everywhere her hus
band has been called. In 1917 there
was no doubt in Mrs. Hoover's mind
as to the decision her husband should
make concerning the relief of Bel
gium. She did her part in organizing
women's committees that were an in
valuable asset in unifying the efforts

Ot American women in relief work.
Mrs. Hoover is ever active, alert in
mind, and eagerly interested in the
events of the world around her. She
performs her daily tasks with that
game quiet, unobtrusive efficiency
that is characteristic of her husband,
yet her social affairs in Washington
represent a delightful spontaneity
that has made a name for Hoover
'hospitality.

As a freshman Lou Henry met the
"great Hoover," as he was known on
the campus after his creating and
writing the A.S.S.U. constitution
which with minor changes rules the
student body of Stanford today. Ac
cording to Charlotte Kellogg, the Hoo
ver romance is one of the best argu
ments for co-education known to her.
When Hoover graduated in '95, the
two had come to an "understanding."
Since her marriage Mrs. Hoover has
made her home all over the world.
She has traveled everywhere her hus
band has been called. In 1917 there
was no doubt in Mrs. Hoover's mind
as to the decision her husband should
make concerning the relief of Bel
gium. She did her part in organizing
women's committees that were an in
valuable asset in unifying the efforts

Ot American women in relief work.
Mrs. Hoover is ever active, alert in
mind, and eagerly interested in the
events of the world around her. She
performs her daily tasks with that
game quiet, unobtrusive efficiency
that is characteristic of her husband,
yet her social affairs in Washington
represent a delightful spontaneity
that has made a name for Hoover
'hospitality.
