## Candidate Broadcasts Last Campaign Speech From Stanford Home 
### 
j Herbert Hoover, in his final utter
: ance of the campaign tonight, ap
-1 j pealed to the electorate of the coun
! try to disregard sectional lines in
| balloting at the polls tomorrow.
"It is contrary to our National
j ideals that any party should represent
any section of the country and this
election more than any that has gone
before gives hope for the breaking
down of sectional lines," the Repub
lican presidential candidate said.
Pleads American Ideals
"There ought no longer to be any
! North, South, East, or West in our
i National thought. Our ideals as
; Americans have been molded and
I welded under leadership of men and
women from every section of our
i country. The greatest progress can
i come in advancement of our institu
tions, our ideas and our ideals by the
common contribution of every sec
: tion."
| The address was made by the candi
date from the study of his home on
| San Juan Hill on the Stanford Uni
; versity campus within a few hours
after arrival here from Washington to
vote. Gathered about him as he spoke
into the microphone were Mrs. Hoo
: ver, their two sons, Allan and Herbert,
! Jr., and Mrs. Herbert, Jr., and a few
personal friends.
Welcomes "First Voters"
The nominee welcomed the "mil
: lions of first voters" to the "common
! tasks of building a better and better
| social order and the welding of the
j idealism of youth into political life."
Pointing to the unparallelled regis
i tration for tomorrow's battle of bal
-1 lots, Hoover said this to a great ex-
I tent was due to the women "who are*
j alive to the fact that the issues in
, national elections more seriously than
ever before affect every home in our
country."
"Women have achieved their rights
at the ballot; they have now accepted
i their responsibilities," he added.
