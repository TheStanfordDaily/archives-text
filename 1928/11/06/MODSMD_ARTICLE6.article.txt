.
"All great men are modest and at the
same time full of self confidence," de
clared Dr. William E. Barton in his lec
ture last night in the Little Theater on
"Abraham Lincoln."
"Lincoln was confident in his powers,
and sure of his eventual election to the
presidency," said the speaker. "He work
ed hard for it, and did every honorable
I thing a man could do to influence the
»
j campaign.
Dr. Barton sketched different home
comings of the Illinois statesman in com-
I parison to Hoover's reception yesterday.
I In Lincoln's own home town they did
i not believe him great, because they knew
i him so intimately, and it is only recently
i that our perspective is long enough to
judge him as he deserves, according to
j the lecturer.
"It is easy to write a book about Lin
coln, but hard to understand him," con
j tinned Dr. Barton. "One must study his
moods, the quick changes from noisy joy
to deep despair, his tender nature and
iron will, his kindliness and violent tem
per, his good common-sense and his de
votion to his Maker. I have spoken in
more foreign countries about Lincoln
j than any other man has spoken of an
| American character, and everywhere he
was known and deeply admired. Though
1 we are often misunderstood by foreign
i ers, at least they all respect America for
; having given to the world such an out
l standing figure as Abraham Lincoln."
