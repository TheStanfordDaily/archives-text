# JACOBSON THANKS PEOPLE FOR HELP
## 
### 
In behalf of the Rally Commit
tee I wish to thank the people of
Stanford and Palo Alto for the
wonderful co-operation which we
received from them in staging the
Hoover Rally yesterday. A most
difficult task was made a pleasure
by the wondeful manner in which
the people helped us in our work.
Particularly do I wish to thank
Mayor Frank G.. Hoge, Chief of
Police Howard Zink, and the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce, for
their great kindness in making
this affair possible.
Dave Jacobson,
Chairman Rally Committee.
