# Hoover Contributes To Alma Mater

### BONNY RODDEN 
Herbert Clark Hoover.
His close friends termed him "warm and
considerate." Many acquaintances
described him as "the coldest man" they
had ever met.
Those who cut through the stand-offish,
business-like aura surrounding Hoover,
found him to be a devoted friend. During
his Presidential nomination days in 1928,
he would would escape into the mountains
on fishing trips with his close friends. They
took pleasure in watching the "eastern
journalists" gaze with astonishment at
towering redwoods in the western forests.
Hoover showed affection not only to his
close fishing buddies but also to his alma
mater, Stanford. During his 90 years, he
organized the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, the Graduate School
of Business, the student union and the
Food Research Institute.
Hoover's most outstanding contribution
to the University is Hoover Institution,
according to almost everyone associated
with Stanford.
Initial Spark
The initial mental spark for the
institution occurred when Hoover was
heading the Commission for Relief in
Belgium in the early years following the
First World War. In his Memoirs, Hoover
says he read in one of Andrew D. White's
writings that most of the fugitive literature
of comment during the French Revolution
was lost to history because no one set any
value on it at the time, and that without
such material it became very difficult or
impossible to reconstruct the real scene.
"There-in lay the origins of the Library
on War, Revolution and Peace at
Stanford."
In 1918 he offered the University
$50,000 to found "an historical collection
of the Great War." He himself travelled
around asking various foreign diplomats to
contribute to the collection.
Gen. John Pershing delegated a score of
instructors and assistant professors from
the Army, idle after the Armistice to scour
all Europe. After World War 11, Gen.
Douglas Mac Arthur also helped find
materials in Japan.
In securing the documents Hoover said
he "requested aid from heads of the
liberated and enemy governments as well.
They did so in an extraordinary fashion. As
these were all revolutionary governments,
none of them regarded the records of their
predecessors as sacred, and we secured
confidential documents from many of
them."
The Hoover War Collection, as it was
originally called, was housed in the main
library until Hoover Tower was completed
in 1941.
Hoover kept in contact with the
institution by being a member of the
Stanford Trustee Board's committee on
Hoover Institution. Hoover was the first
alumnus on the Board. He served as a
trustee from 1912 until his death in 1964,
being elected trustee emeritus in 1961.
Many people praised Hoover's
contributions to the Board. Former
University President David Starr Jordan
wrote in May, 1913, "It is marvelous how
Hoover is handling our Board. Almost
every reform we have dreamed of has
slipped through as if oiled ~ . Mr.
[Timothy] Hopkins |founding trustee]
said that Hoover gave them in 10 days
more ideas than they had had in ten
years."
Hoover scrutinized the Board's financial
situation, forcing it to reveal statements
concerning resources, liabilities, incomes
and expenditures.
Afterwards, he writes in his Memoirs, "I
regretfully concluded that the institution
could not expand unless it abolished its old
policy of free tuition. The trustees agreed
that we must impose a tuition but adapted
to students who were working their way
through college by allowing them to give
10 -year notes without interest."
Ironically, Hoover came to Stanford
because the tuition was free.

In 1936, Hoover represented the Board
in petitioning the courts for a decree
permitting investment of endowment funds
in common stock, instead of exclusively in
bonds and mortgages. The court's granting
of the petition has added millions of
dollars worth of income to the University.
In one particular dealing with the
Trustee Board and Hoover Institution
many did not praise Hoover. In fact, he
was severely criticized.
In 1959, the Board of Trustees passed a
resolution concerning the relationship
between the University and the Institution.
Prefacing the resolution, a statement by
Hoover voices his thoughts on the
institution's purpose.
"The purpose of this Institution must
be, by its research and publications to
demonstrate the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx —' whether Communism,
Socialism, economic materialism, or
atheism — thus, to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies, their
conspiracies, and to reaffirm the validity of
the American system."
Publicly Revealed
The statement wasn't publicly revealed
until early 1960. It sparked a Daily
editorial, a trustee statement, derogatory
comments by professors and an
explanation by then President Wallace
Sterling.
The Daily attacked the statement saying
it "flagrantly violates all the principles of
scholarly investigation and academic
freedom."
Sterling explained that Hoover's
statement was merely a "matter of record"
not a formal part of the trustee resolution.
He said the issue did not concern the issue
of the "evils of Karl Marx" or the "validity
of the American system."
Instead, the issue centered on "the well
established and honored principle . .. that
no research that is bona fide and worthy of
the name can be undertaken with

predetermined conclusions." Sterling said
this judgement had been "vigorously
enunciated" by Hoover. The trustees'
statement supported Sterling's.
In a 1972 interview with the present
director of the institution, Glenn Campbell
remarked that Hoover's statement was "a
personal statement of desire on the part of
the founder — part of an overall statement
that made it very clear that free inquiry
was to prevail in the Hoover Institution."
Campbell said he interpreted the statement
to mean "that he hoped we would have a
research program on communism."
Campbell recently lamented the
"unfortunate wording" of Hoover's
statement. He accused the editorial and
professorial attacks in the Mar. 29 and 30
issues of the Daily and a four-part series in
the 1967 Daily as "vindictive, uninformed,
and political."
He said they would not have engaged in
the "orgy of criticism" if they had
properly researched the issue.
Cold Approach
Some criticized Hoover also for his
cold, formal approach towards strangers.
Thomas A. Bailey, Margaret Byrne
Professor of American History, spoke of
one of his few run-ins with Hoover.
During the 1940 campaign against
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Bailey wrote a
speech supporting limitation of the
Presidency to two terms. Hoover heard the
speech and asked Bailey for a copy of the
text so he could use it to write a speech of
his own.
After working nearly a whole day
writing the text, Bailey walked into
Hoover's office expecting Hoover to thank
him graciously.
"The air was thick with cigar smoke,"
Bailey recalls his meeting with Hoover.
"And my mother always thought he was
such a tea-totaler. He was very careful not
to display his cigars."
Bailey continued, "He didn't stand up

when I entered and here he had called me
in to thank me. He didn't extend his hand.
It was the coldest experience I have ever
had."
'Delightful Man'
Yet there were plenty of people who
loved him. "He was one of the most
amusing, delightful men I've ever met,"
Ann Sterling, wife of the then-University
president, reminisced. "Very few people
knew what a great raconteur he was."
People also praised Hoover for his
innovative ideas concerning Stanford. In
1909, he proposed building a student
union and a women's clubhouse on
campus. He led the fundraising campaign.
After the two buildings were completed
in 1915, Hoover donated $100,000 to
construct the main building with provisions
for restaurants and living quarters which
would connect the two corner buildings.
The rest of the trustees donated $150,000
which was later repaid through the union's
earnings.
In 1921 Hoover also founded the Food
Research Institute to combat the national
food problem. Hoover said, "I proposed
that its work should be with products after
they left, the farmer. K was to study
processing and distribution with a view of
eliminating waste and improving standards
and quality."
To give Stanford graduates a chance to
participate in the country's economics,
Hoover founded the Graduate School of
Business in 1925.
Hoover House
Lou Henry Hoover, the President's wife,
left a building to Stanford bearing her
name as her husband did with Hoover
Tow jr. In 1919, returning from European
relief work, Mrs. Hoover resurrected plans
for building a house on a campus lot which
she had leased several years before.
Along with Palo Alto architects Arthur
B. Clark and his son Birge M. Clark she
designed the house which had to hold all
the possessions Mrs. Hoover and her
husband had accumulated on their many
trips all over the world.
Mrs. Hoover said she didn't want a
grand mansion. She apparently preferred to
hide inconspicuously among the faculty
homes in the neighborhood. However, no
one can deny that the Lou Henry House,
now the University President's mansion,
dominates its location on San Juan Hill.
Hoover said the house was all his wife's
making. "[lt] reflected well her excellent
sense of taste and form in arrangement and
workmanship. It was her own blend of fine
living and the new spirit of native western
architecture to modern America ... It was
an expression of herself."
Hoover and his wife awaited the results
of the Nov. 6, 1928 election in their house
atop the hill. While he and Mrs. Hoover
quietly celebrated the victory by walking
in the foothills, the townspeople and
Stanford students swarmed madly up the
hill cheering at the top of their lungs.
On Oct. 20, 1964, the campus mourned
Herbert Hoover's death with as much
fervor as they had cheered his election.
President Wallace Sterling commented
on the late Hoover: "A university which
has had the benefaction of such association
with a man who attained eminence as an
engineer, author, humanitarian and public
servant can only be grateful and proud. If
anything could assuage the deep sadness of
his passing, it is the knowledge that his
long life advanced the cause of learning and
human dignity and brought relief to human
suffering."
Condolences came from all over the
nation. Richard Nixon, then former vice
president, remarked, that Hoover was "one
of those rare individuals who lived to hear
the overwhelmingly favorable verdict of
history on his career."
