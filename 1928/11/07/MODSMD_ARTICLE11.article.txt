# Hoover's Political Career — Misjudged?
## 
### BILL EVERS 
"It was Mr. Hoover," social
commentator Walter Lippmann pointed
out in 1935, "who abandoned the
principles of laissez faire in relation to the
business cycle, established the conviction
that prosperity and depression can be
publicly controlled by political action, and
drove out of the public consciousness the
old idea that depressions must be overcome
by private adjustment."
In this as well as many other facets of
his career as a public figure and statesman,
Herbert Clark Hoover has been frequently
misjudged and misunderstood by historians
and members of the general public alike.
William Appleman Williams of Oregon
State University, the prominent revisionist
historian, contends that "more than any
other 20th-century American's, Hoover's
reputation is the product of
misinformation and distortion."
'he was the darling
of the progressives . .
Hoover was a contributor to the
founding fund of the New Republic
magazine and one of President Woodrow
Wilson's closest advisers after 1916. In
1920, at the beginning of Hoover's political
career, "he was the darling of the
progressives who still clustered about the
figure of the fallen Wilson," according to
Stanford historian Carl N. Degler.
At that time, Wilson's Assistant
Secretary of the Navy Franklin D.
Roosevelt said with enthusiasm, "He is
certainly a wonder and I wish we could
make him President of the United States.
There could not be a better one."
Laissez Faire
From the earliest days of his political
life, Hoover repudiated the laissez faire
policies of classical liberal doctrine. In
American Individualism (1922), he wrote,
"Individualism cannot be maintained as the
foundation of a society if it looks to only
legalistic justice based upon contracts, prop
erty, and political equality. Such legalistic
safeguards are themselves not enough.
"In our individualism we have long since
abandoned the laissez faire of the
eighteenth century — the notion that it is
'every man for himself and the devil take
the hindmost.' "
Some indication of how closely
progressive Republican Hoover fit in with
the Progressive Era cult of "efficiency" and
social engineering can be gained from
looking at some chapter subheadings in his
Memoirs: "The elimination of waste,
elimination of waste in the railroads,
expansion in electrical power,
simplification and standardization,
specifications, elimination of waste by
reducing seasonal operation of industry,
elimination of waste by arbitration of trade
disputes [Hoover had favored compulsory
arbitration since 1909], waste of oil, waste
and trouble in the coal industry, waste in
the federal bureaucracy, elimination of
human waste in accidents.... the
opposition to increased efficiency."
Worship Aura
Iconoclastic political columnist H.L.
Mencken effectively satirized in Oct. 1932,
the aura of worship that surrounded
Hoover's early political career: "Dr.
Hoover did not go into office as an
ordinary American politician (Blatta
sapiens).
"His agents did not represent him to be
the usual and familiar amalgam of knave
and imbecile, so natural and normal to
public life under democracy.
"On the contrary-, they represented him
to be a most extraordinary and even
miraculous character, politically speaking.
'They said he had a genuine genius for
public affairs, perhaps unparalleled in the
world, and especially for public affairs of
an economic nature.

'They said that his brain was an organ
of astounding virtuosity, and could grasp
and solve any conceivable problem with
almost supernatural speed and accuracy.
"And they said, finally, that he was a
man of peculiar and lofty recitude, a hater
of shams and dodges, a life-long adherent
of the true, the good, and the beautiful, a
sturdy individualist, the captain of his own
soul — in brief, the complete
antipolitician."
Prominent Engineer
Hoover entered the public eye as an
internationally prominent engineer who
had successfully undertaken the relief of
the starving Belgian population in the
midst of the First World War.
Hoover then accepted the post of Food
Administrator in the Wilson administration
shortly after the United States entered
World War I.
The seminal importance of Hoover's
pioneer work here was stressed by Paul
Willard Garrett, the official historian of
World War I price control. He declared that
the food control program "was the most
important measure for controlling prices
which the United States .. . has ever
taken."
After the armistice ending the World
War I fighting was signed. Hoover
supervised American relief efforts in

Europe. He saw a pattern at that time of
starvation-level food supplies leading to
loss of societal morale, then leading to
political revolution.
Bolshevist Propaganda
He told an audience in Philadelphia a
few years later, "The misery of war famine,
the weakening of institutions because of
revolution, furnished the fertile grounds of
social desperation for the resulting
propaganda of a Bolshevist and anarchistic
order .... It would have been impossible
for us to expect even to maintain the
Allied or our own institutions if Central
Europe had succumbed to this sort of
chaos."
. . the key leader
among . . . sophisticated
corporation executives
In giving a general assessment of
Hoover, Williams finds that he played a
central role in reordering American society

after World War I: "... the key leader
among .. . Progressive and sophisticated
corporation executives was Herbert
Hoover.... He is very seldom recognized
and acknowledged for what he is: the
keystone in the arch that leads from Mark
Hanna and Herbert Croly to such later
figures as Nelson Rockefeller and Adolph
Berle."
During his tenure as Commerce
Secretary under Presidents Warren Harding
and Calvin Coolidge, Hoover sought to
chart and keep open the channels of
foreign trade for American businessmen.
Economic Nationalism
Throughout Hoover's foreign economic
policy, according to historian Joseph
Brandes, "there ran a thread of economic
nationalism which envisioned the world's
welfare in terms of the long-range
prosperity of the United States.
Not only ...
acquisition of strategic
raw materials ..
"Not only did this involve acquisition of
strategic raw materials and constantly

rising exports of American goods and
capital, but the export of American
principles as well (such as the virtues of
competition and sound fiscal practices)."
Hoover retooled the internal machinery
of the Commerce Department to provide
American businessmen with up-to-date
information on business conditions abroad
and the attitudes of foreign officials.
He brought direct U.S. government
pressure to bear on Great Britain to end a
British colonial policy of compulsory
reduction of rubber production which
raised prices for crude rubber. Hoover also
embargoed loans from the American
financial community to the Brazilian
coffee cartel and the Franco-German
potash cartel.
Blatant Hypocrisy
At the same time, critics of Hoover's
foreign economic policy, especially in the
British press, pointed to what they saw as
blatant hypocrisy. Hoover was fighting for
free access for American business abroad,
but the United States had high tariffs,
which kept out foreign goods. Hoover
considered the protective tariff, a
traditional Republican policy, vital to
American domestic prosperity.

In addition, Hoover deliberately sought
out involvement in labor relations as
Commerce Secretary.
As historian Ronald Radosh wrote in
1966, "The man whose thought most
affected [Samuel] Gompers [the founder
of the American Federation of Labor] was
the prolabor Secretary of Commerce
Herbert Clark Hoover."
According to Radosh, "Hoover analyzed
the American industrial system as
composed of three basic units — capital,
labor, and government. His objective was
to have these groups function together
harmoniously. He therefore demanded a
voice in labor policy in President Harding's
Cabinet.
"Defining labor and management as
producers, not as social classes, Hoover saw
large areas of mutual interest that had to
be cultivated. Once in office Hoover began
the pattern of prolabor intervention by
government that culminated in the New
Deal."
12-Hour Day
For example, in June of 1923, in the
wake of the 1919 steel strike, Hoover and
President Harding in a thinly veiled manner
threatened government action unless the
steel industry changed from a 12-hour
workday to an 8-hour one.
In his Memoirs, he noted with pride that
"owing to public opinion and some
pushing on our part, the 12-hour day was
on the way out in American industry."
Another decision of Hoover's as
Commerce Secretary that was to have
far-reaching and long-lasting effects was his
nationalization of the radio spectum. In his
Memoirs, Hoover says that early in his
career as Commerce Secretary he was
impressed with "the urgency of placing the
new channels of communication under
public control."
But he points out, "Many [radiomen]
were insisting on a right of permanent
preemption of the channels through the air
as private property." Hoover contends that
he sought to save the radio spectum as a
"great national asset" by preventing it
from becoming subject to untrammeled
"naked commercial selfishness."
By his refusal to allow private property
in radio frequencies, Hoover shaped
decisively the radio and television system
that we see and hear today.
Election
Then Hoover was elected by a large
margin to the Presidency. He defeated A1
Smith in an election that Mencken saw as
one of the rural yokels who favored
Prohibition refusing to accept Smith's
permissive view of alcohol.
Degler describes the "real continuity"
that existed between the administration of
Hoover and that of Roosevelt:
Both . .. accepted
a role for government
in the economy ..
"Both men, it is worth recalling, were
proteges of Woodrow Wilson; both of
them, therefore, accepted a role for
government in the economy which added
up to a sharp departure from laissez-faire.
"Both, in the course of their respective
administrations, drew upon their
experiences in the First World War, where
they had seen government intervening in
the economy. Hoover's RFC
[Reconstruction Finance Corporation], for
example, was frankly modeled, as he said,
after the War Finance Corporation.
"Both saw bit business standing in need
of controls, and, for a while, both believed
that cooperation between business and
government was the best way to achieve
that control.
"Hoover, for instance, cited the Federal
Reserve System as the ideal kind of
business and government cooperation for

STUDENT FOR LIFE—In addition to being elected trustee emeritus in 1961 for
his 49 continuous years of service on the University's board, Hoover was also
named a life member of the Stanford student body in 1949, at the celebration of
his 75th birthday. He is pictured here in 1958.
