# Hoover's Political Career — Misjudged?
## 
### BILL EVERS 
"It was Mr. Hoover," social
commentator Walter Lippmann pointed
out in 1935, "who abandoned the
principles of laissez faire in relation to the
business cycle, established the conviction
that prosperity and depression can be
publicly controlled by political action, and
drove out of the public consciousness the
old idea that depressions must be overcome
by private adjustment."
In this as well as many other facets of
his career as a public figure and statesman,
Herbert Clark Hoover has been frequently
misjudged and misunderstood by historians
and members of the general public alike.
William Appleman Williams of Oregon
State University, the prominent revisionist
historian, contends that "more than any
other 20th-century American's, Hoover's
reputation is the product of
misinformation and distortion."
'he was the darling
of the progressives . .
Hoover was a contributor to the
founding fund of the New Republic
magazine and one of President Woodrow
Wilson's closest advisers after 1916. In
1920, at the beginning of Hoover's political
career, "he was the darling of the
progressives who still clustered about the
figure of the fallen Wilson," according to
Stanford historian Carl N. Degler.
At that time, Wilson's Assistant
Secretary of the Navy Franklin D.
Roosevelt said with enthusiasm, "He is
certainly a wonder and I wish we could
make him President of the United States.
There could not be a better one."
Laissez Faire
From the earliest days of his political
life, Hoover repudiated the laissez faire
policies of classical liberal doctrine. In
American Individualism (1922), he wrote,
"Individualism cannot be maintained as the
foundation of a society if it looks to only
legalistic justice based upon contracts, prop
erty, and political equality. Such legalistic
safeguards are themselves not enough.
"In our individualism we have long since
abandoned the laissez faire of the
eighteenth century — the notion that it is
'every man for himself and the devil take
the hindmost.' "
Some indication of how closely
progressive Republican Hoover fit in with
the Progressive Era cult of "efficiency" and
social engineering can be gained from
looking at some chapter subheadings in his
Memoirs: "The elimination of waste,
elimination of waste in the railroads,
expansion in electrical power,
simplification and standardization,
specifications, elimination of waste by
reducing seasonal operation of industry,
elimination of waste by arbitration of trade
disputes [Hoover had favored compulsory
arbitration since 1909], waste of oil, waste
and trouble in the coal industry, waste in
the federal bureaucracy, elimination of
human waste in accidents.... the
opposition to increased efficiency."
Worship Aura
Iconoclastic political columnist H.L.
Mencken effectively satirized in Oct. 1932,
the aura of worship that surrounded
Hoover's early political career: "Dr.
Hoover did not go into office as an
ordinary American politician (Blatta
sapiens).
"His agents did not represent him to be
the usual and familiar amalgam of knave
and imbecile, so natural and normal to
public life under democracy.
"On the contrary-, they represented him
to be a most extraordinary and even
miraculous character, politically speaking.
'They said he had a genuine genius for
public affairs, perhaps unparalleled in the
world, and especially for public affairs of
an economic nature.

'They said that his brain was an organ
of astounding virtuosity, and could grasp
and solve any conceivable problem with
almost supernatural speed and accuracy.
"And they said, finally, that he was a
man of peculiar and lofty recitude, a hater
of shams and dodges, a life-long adherent
of the true, the good, and the beautiful, a
sturdy individualist, the captain of his own
soul — in brief, the complete
antipolitician."
Prominent Engineer
Hoover entered the public eye as an
internationally prominent engineer who
had successfully undertaken the relief of
the starving Belgian population in the
midst of the First World War.
Hoover then accepted the post of Food
Administrator in the Wilson administration
shortly after the United States entered
World War I.
The seminal importance of Hoover's
pioneer work here was stressed by Paul
Willard Garrett, the official historian of
World War I price control. He declared that
the food control program "was the most
important measure for controlling prices
which the United States .. . has ever
taken."
After the armistice ending the World
War I fighting was signed. Hoover
supervised American relief efforts in

Europe. He saw a pattern at that time of
starvation-level food supplies leading to
loss of societal morale, then leading to
political revolution.
Bolshevist Propaganda
He told an audience in Philadelphia a
few years later, "The misery of war famine,
the weakening of institutions because of
revolution, furnished the fertile grounds of
social desperation for the resulting
propaganda of a Bolshevist and anarchistic
order .... It would have been impossible
for us to expect even to maintain the
Allied or our own institutions if Central
Europe had succumbed to this sort of
chaos."
. . the key leader
among . . . sophisticated
corporation executives
In giving a general assessment of
Hoover, Williams finds that he played a
central role in reordering American society

after World War I: "... the key leader
among .. . Progressive and sophisticated
corporation executives was Herbert
Hoover.... He is very seldom recognized
and acknowledged for what he is: the
keystone in the arch that leads from Mark
Hanna and Herbert Croly to such later
figures as Nelson Rockefeller and Adolph
Berle."
During his tenure as Commerce
Secretary under Presidents Warren Harding
and Calvin Coolidge, Hoover sought to
chart and keep open the channels of
foreign trade for American businessmen.
Economic Nationalism
Throughout Hoover's foreign economic
policy, according to historian Joseph
Brandes, "there ran a thread of economic
nationalism which envisioned the world's
welfare in terms of the long-range
prosperity of the United States.
Not only ...
acquisition of strategic
raw materials ..
"Not only did this involve acquisition of
strategic raw materials and constantly

rising exports of American goods and
capital, but the export of American
principles as well (such as the virtues of
competition and sound fiscal practices)."
Hoover retooled the internal machinery
of the Commerce Department to provide
American businessmen with up-to-date
information on business conditions abroad
and the attitudes of foreign officials.
He brought direct U.S. government
pressure to bear on Great Britain to end a
British colonial policy of compulsory
reduction of rubber production which
raised prices for crude rubber. Hoover also
embargoed loans from the American
financial community to the Brazilian
coffee cartel and the Franco-German
potash cartel.
Blatant Hypocrisy
At the same time, critics of Hoover's
foreign economic policy, especially in the
British press, pointed to what they saw as
blatant hypocrisy. Hoover was fighting for
free access for American business abroad,
but the United States had high tariffs,
which kept out foreign goods. Hoover
considered the protective tariff, a
traditional Republican policy, vital to
American domestic prosperity.

In addition, Hoover deliberately sought
out involvement in labor relations as
Commerce Secretary.
As historian Ronald Radosh wrote in
1966, "The man whose thought most
affected [Samuel] Gompers [the founder
of the American Federation of Labor] was
the prolabor Secretary of Commerce
Herbert Clark Hoover."
According to Radosh, "Hoover analyzed
the American industrial system as
composed of three basic units — capital,
labor, and government. His objective was
to have these groups function together
harmoniously. He therefore demanded a
voice in labor policy in President Harding's
Cabinet.
"Defining labor and management as
producers, not as social classes, Hoover saw
large areas of mutual interest that had to
be cultivated. Once in office Hoover began
the pattern of prolabor intervention by
government that culminated in the New
Deal."
12-Hour Day
For example, in June of 1923, in the
wake of the 1919 steel strike, Hoover and
President Harding in a thinly veiled manner
threatened government action unless the
steel industry changed from a 12-hour
workday to an 8-hour one.
In his Memoirs, he noted with pride that
"owing to public opinion and some
pushing on our part, the 12-hour day was
on the way out in American industry."
Another decision of Hoover's as
Commerce Secretary that was to have
far-reaching and long-lasting effects was his
nationalization of the radio spectum. In his
Memoirs, Hoover says that early in his
career as Commerce Secretary he was
impressed with "the urgency of placing the
new channels of communication under
public control."
But he points out, "Many [radiomen]
were insisting on a right of permanent
preemption of the channels through the air
as private property." Hoover contends that
he sought to save the radio spectum as a
"great national asset" by preventing it
from becoming subject to untrammeled
"naked commercial selfishness."
By his refusal to allow private property
in radio frequencies, Hoover shaped
decisively the radio and television system
that we see and hear today.
Election
Then Hoover was elected by a large
margin to the Presidency. He defeated A1
Smith in an election that Mencken saw as
one of the rural yokels who favored
Prohibition refusing to accept Smith's
permissive view of alcohol.
Degler describes the "real continuity"
that existed between the administration of
Hoover and that of Roosevelt:
Both . .. accepted
a role for government
in the economy ..
"Both men, it is worth recalling, were
proteges of Woodrow Wilson; both of
them, therefore, accepted a role for
government in the economy which added
up to a sharp departure from laissez-faire.
"Both, in the course of their respective
administrations, drew upon their
experiences in the First World War, where
they had seen government intervening in
the economy. Hoover's RFC
[Reconstruction Finance Corporation], for
example, was frankly modeled, as he said,
after the War Finance Corporation.
"Both saw bit business standing in need
of controls, and, for a while, both believed
that cooperation between business and
government was the best way to achieve
that control.
"Hoover, for instance, cited the Federal
Reserve System as the ideal kind of
business and government cooperation for

STUDENT FOR LIFE—In addition to being elected trustee emeritus in 1961 for
his 49 continuous years of service on the University's board, Hoover was also
named a life member of the Stanford student body in 1949, at the celebration of
his 75th birthday. He is pictured here in 1958.
purposes of regulating the economy;
Roosevelt in the NRA [National Recovery
Administration] also placed his trust in
controls worked out through business and
government cooperation.
Governmental Responsibility
"Moreover, both Roosevelt and Hoover
took the view that it was government's
responsibility to do something about a
depression; neither man was willing to
subscribe to the view which prevailed
before 1929 — namely, that economic
declines were simply natural phenomena
through which the nation struggled as best
it could and that government could not be
expected to do much about them."
Hoover was the first President to
mobilize the nation's professional social
scientists in the service of peacetime social
planning.
As recounted by Ray Lyman Wilbur, a
president of Stanford and Hoover's Interior
Secretary, and Arthur Mastick Hyde,
Hoover's Agriculture Secretary, "at the
beginning of [Hoover's] administration, in
accord with his invariable demand for the
facts by scientific methods of inquiry, he
instituted a thorough and complete
investigation into the whole field of social
problems — the first time it had ever been
undertaken.
"On September 19, 1929, he appointed
a committee of leading economists and
sociologists to undertake an exhaustive
examination and report...
Committee Report
"The committee's work covered:
utilization of natural resources, influence
of invention and discovery, the agencies of
communication, trends in economic
organization, education, rural life, the
vitality of the American people, the family
and its functions, the activities of women
outside the home, childhood and youth,
labor groups, the people as consumers,
recreation, the arts, changes in religious
organization, health, crime and
punishment, public welfare activities, the
growth of governmental functions,
taxation and public finance, public
administration, law and legal institutions,
government and society, and many other
subjects.
"It entered into questions of national
planning,... old age pensions,
unemployment insurance, greater stability
in the economic system, and many other
avenues of action."
Economic historian Murray N.
Rothbard has noted Hoover's leadership in
developing the pattern for 20th-century
American agricultural policy: "He was one
of the earliest proponents of a Federal

Farm Board, designed to raise and support
farm prices by creating federal stabilization
corporations that were to purchase farm
products and to lend money to farm co-ops
for such purchases."
Depression Policy
Hoover certainly did not see his
depression policy as one of leaving the
economy alone. During his Presidential
campaign in the autumn of 1932, he
summarized his program:
"We might have done nothing. That
would have been utter ruin. Instead we met
the situation with proposals to private
business and to Congress of the most
gigantic program of economic defense and
counterattack ever evolved in the history
of the Republic ....
"Some of the reactionary economists
urged that we should allow the liquidation
to take its course until we had found rock
bottom .... We determined that we would
not follow the advice of the bitter-end
liquidationists."
Immediately after the on-set of the
Depression, Hoover urged an increase in
state-level public works, and he himself
proposed to Congress hundreds of millions
of dollars worth of federal government
construction projects including Hoover
Dam, the Grand Coulee Dam, and a St.
Lawrence seaway.
Economist Herbert Stein, a former
Nixon adviser, noted in a 1966 essay that
"Hoover believed that the maintenance of
wage rates would contribute to sustaining
economic activity and employment. This
belief was simply the application to the
Depression of the general American
high-wage philosophy that became popular
in the 19205."
Stein relates that "one of Hoover's first
acts after the 1929 stock market crash was
to summon industrial leaders to the White
House and ask them to pledge not to cut
wage rates. They agreed, and there was at
the time little argument over the wisdom
of this policy."
Since prices were falling quickly, not
cutting wages meant a rise in real wages.
This policy is still a subject of current
controversy. For example, the Aug. 15
issue of Business Week magazine reports
that Austrian School economists in the
U.S. blame this policy of Hoover's for
deepening and prolonging mass
unemployment.
Foreign Policy
Hoover's foreign policy views made
something of a maverick among the
predominate policy-setting group of
crusading Wilsonian idealists. Hoover
supported the League of Nations as "an
experiment in the concept of collective

action against aggressions."
But he had reservations about the
realism of freezing the status quo of
territorial holdings and boundaries. These
reservations placed Hoover in the camp of
those Republican internationalists who
wanted the Senate to approve the
Versailles Treaty with minor reservations.
Williams, who is a specialist in foreign
relations, says that during his career
Hoover made a "valiant attempt" to devise
a foreign policy by which markets overseas
could be expanded, but "without paying
for it by imperial wars.... Hoover and
other American officials actually initiated
much of both the spirit and practice of
what Roosevelt and Hull later received
credit for under the name of the Good
Neighbor Policy."
Hoover withdrew the Marines from
Haiti and Nicaragua and refused to
intervene militarily or with the threat of
military force in other Latin American
upheavals.
Hoover opposed the foreign policy
practice that characterized the Cold War.

In May 1945, he told President Harry S
Truman that the United States should be
content "to persuade, hold up our banner
of what we thought was right and let it go
at that."
In December 1950, Hoover called on
patriotic and semi-isolationist grounds for
American evacuation of Korea, at which
time both The Nation and the New
Republic attacked him for not being
anti-communist enough in his foreign
policy.
But most importantly and to an extent
still largely unappreciated by both
professional historians and laymen, Hoover
was in his policies the precursor of the New
Deal.
As summarized in 1942 by social
commentator Stuart Chase, who invented
the phrase "New Deal," "Mr.
Hoover ... inaugurated an embryo New
Deal. He expanded public works, put relief
on a federal basis through grants to the
states, and organized the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation to put government
credit under tottering railroads, insurance
companies, and banks."
