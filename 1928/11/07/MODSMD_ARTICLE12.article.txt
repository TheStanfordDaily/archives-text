Distinguished Service, the highest honor bestowed by the Stanford
Alumni Association Wednesday night.
Founder in 1930 of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, Lee received the
award from John R. Johnson, president of the Alumni Association at
a faculty club dinner.

establishment of the 19305. He later helped create the Palo Alto
Medical Research Foundation and Channing House, a residential
home.

of medical care. He retired in 1960 from the Medical Center where he
was a clinical professor of medicine.
The Herbert Hoover Medal for Distinguished Service is 12 years
old. Hoover received the first award in 1963. Many names had been
suggested to the five-member selection committee, but the committee
decided unanimously to choose Hoover.
Guy R. Neely, an alumnus presented the award to Hoover. He had
run into Hoover before at a football game in 1934.
Neely, then an excited freshman who had just checked into Encina
Hall the night before, ventured to the stadium to watch his home
team.
Making his way through the masses, someone stepped on his toe.
The someone turned around to Neely, graciously apologizing.
The freshman wrote home elated, "I have been stepped on by
ex-President Hoover."
The Medal is not necessarily awarded every year; however, each
year a number of nominees will be considered.
