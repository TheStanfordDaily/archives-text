# Hoover Institution—Research Center For Peace
## 
### SANDY WHITE 
Everyone knows that once you're a
Stanford graduate, you'll get hit for money
for the rest of your life. Sooner or later,
everyone coughs up a couple thousand here
and there. Some even volunteer money,
perhaps as a good loophole. But with most
alumni it stops there. Herbert Hoover was
one of the exceptions.
Not only did Hoover offer money, he
also offered ideas — such as founding the
Food Research Institute and encouraging
the development of a business school. He
also started one of the world's most
complete collections on 20th century wars
and revolutions here.
The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, known to most
Stanford students only as that great
landmark in the sky, is a major center for
advanced scholarship in political science,
history, economics, and international law.
As student guides in the tower point out
to visitors, the institution is the third
largest archive in the nation — the largest
private archive.
It contains over 1,250,000 volumes,
including government documents, as well
as 3,000 archive units, which are usually
private collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries, and other
documents. Subscriptions to newspapers
and periodicals have netted over 30,000
titles on file.
Investigative Opportunities
What all these numbers signify to a
scholar is the possibility to thoroughly
investigate a subject — whether it be an
intense study of a particulai country, war,
or revolution, or a broad, comparative look

at a political or historical phenomenon.
The institution has published 275 volumes
since 1919 when Hoover founded it.
Examples of recent publications are:
The Stalinist Terror in the Thirties, the
North Korean Economy, Truman, the
Jewish Vote, and the Creation of Israel,
Yearbook on International Communist
Affairs: 1973 (seventh in a series), and A
Chinese-English Dictionary of Communist
Chinese Terminology.
As American Relief Administration
Director in Europe during World War I,
Hoover began his collection with the help
of Stanford professors Ephraim Adams and
Ralph Lutz. He hoped that the materials
they gathered would provide the data with
which future historians could work. Lutz
became the institution's director in 1925.
Main Library
Until 1939, the collected materials were
stored in various places on campus — many
in the main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the masses of
documents the collecting team sent back at
the end of the war.
Recognizing the need for a separate
building, the founders set about raising
money. By 1939, they were ready to start
constructing the tower, which was
dedicated in 1941.
With a permanent base and storage
space, the institution was freed for further
acquisition and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated in 1967 and
houses the East Asian and newspaper
collections and also 36 research offices. A
third building is planned.
285-Foot Tower
The 285-foot tower holds the library
and main archives — there are 17 levels of
stacks — as well as administrative and
research offices, two reading rooms, two
display rooms of Hoover memorabilia, and
a 35-bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium for the
1939-40 World's Fair, and were later
donated to Hoover by the Belgian
American Educational Foundation. Hoover
gave them to the institution, which placed
them on top of the tower.
Electrical Engineering Professor James
Angell plays the carillon at noon and 5
p.m. every day during the school year.
Three students, Rick Anderson, Peggy
Hurd, and Joan Ferguson, also play the
bells.
4 A ngell's Music'
As "Angell's music" descends from the
heights above, Hoover staffers are
constantly seeking new items for their
collections. Although the institution began
as a vehicle to study World War I, Hoover's
statement of purpose that it "promote
peace" throughout the world led to its
expansion and constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese collections are
especially large. Hoover particularly
encouraged three areas of interest which

are still pursued today: domestic problems,
international studies, and scholarship
fellowships.
The library is divided into regional and
special collections: Africa, East Asia,
Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the British Labor
Collection, the Nicolaevsky Collection, and
the New Left Collection.
That same call for the promotion of
peace has led to the institution's striving to
serve as a dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest solutions, and
uncover trends in the world through its
research and publications.
Availability
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and archivists, the
institution makes its holdings available to
all Stanford students and faculty, and all
other scholars. Many authors and
researchers come from all over the world to
use the institution.
Recently a fellows program has been
established in three areas: public affairs,
peace, and national.
The fellowships are given to selected
applicants and allow them to spend time

"in unrestricted and creative work." The
national fellowships are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to use the
institution's resources. They may discuss
their projects with any of the scholars
connected with the institution.
Peace Fellows
The projects of the three peace fellows
must investigate "the phenomena of
peace," the fellowship founders decreed.
Public affairs fellowships are designed to
train about three people a year to work for
legislators and national administrators.
The staff and administration of the
institution cover a wide spectrum. The
director, W. Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of California
board of regents. The staff, which
represents 20 different countries and 30
languages, numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy and helps in
the selection of a director, consists of
corporate businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated Money
The institution was blessed from the
very beginning with more money than a
comparable public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to provide
funds, and in 1922 he gave $200,000
through the Commission for Relief in
Belgium.
Endowment and reserve funds are now
over $12,000,000. Gifts to the institution
have risen to over $2,000,000 a year. In
1971, David Packard gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now considered an
independent body within the University,
not just its stepchild in the backroom. The
hundreds of visitors who enter its glass
doors every day see only a small part of the
many facets of the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mysteriously in
the middle floors of the building, are open
only to the eyes of the librarians and
archivists. Even library patrons are not free
to browse — they must request specific
books, then wait for the search crew to
bring them.
Visitors in the elevator may get a
glimpse of the director's office, on the
same floor where Hoover himself once kept
an office. But the wealth of materials in
the archives hold a secret no one can ever
learn completely.

Chinese Terminology.
As American Relief Administration
Director in Europe during World War I,
Hoover began his collection with the help
of Stanford professors Ephraim Adams and
Ralph Lutz. He hoped that the materials
they gathered would provide the data with
which future historians could work. Lutz
became the institution's director in 1925.
Main Library
Until 1939, the collected materials were
stored in various places on campus — many
in the main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the masses of
documents the collecting team sent back at
the end of the war.
Recognizing the need for a separate
building, the founders set about raising
money. By 1939, they were ready to start
constructing the tower, which was
dedicated in 1941.
With a permanent base and storage
space, the institution was freed for further
acquisition and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated in 1967 and
houses the East Asian and newspaper
collections and also 36 research offices. A
third building is planned.
285-Foot Tower
The 285-foot tower holds the library
and main archives — there are 17 levels of
stacks — as well as administrative and
research offices, two reading rooms, two
display rooms of Hoover memorabilia, and
a 35-bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium for the
1939-40 World's Fair, and were later
donated to Hoover by the Belgian
American Educational Foundation. Hoover
gave them to the institution, which placed
them on top of the tower.
Electrical Engineering Professor James
Angell plays the carillon at noon and 5
p.m. every day during the school year.
Three students, Rick Anderson, Peggy
Hurd, and Joan Ferguson, also play the
bells.
4 A ngell's Music'
As "Angell's music" descends from the
heights above, Hoover staffers are
constantly seeking new items for their
collections. Although the institution began
as a vehicle to study World War I, Hoover's
statement of purpose that it "promote
peace" throughout the world led to its
expansion and constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese collections are
especially large. Hoover particularly
encouraged three areas of interest which

are still pursued today: domestic problems,
international studies, and scholarship
fellowships.
The library is divided into regional and
special collections: Africa, East Asia,
Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the British Labor
Collection, the Nicolaevsky Collection, and
the New Left Collection.
That same call for the promotion of
peace has led to the institution's striving to
serve as a dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest solutions, and
uncover trends in the world through its
research and publications.
Availability
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and archivists, the
institution makes its holdings available to
all Stanford students and faculty, and all
other scholars. Many authors and
researchers come from all over the world to
use the institution.
Recently a fellows program has been
established in three areas: public affairs,
peace, and national.
The fellowships are given to selected
applicants and allow them to spend time

"in unrestricted and creative work." The
national fellowships are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to use the
institution's resources. They may discuss
their projects with any of the scholars
connected with the institution.
Peace Fellows
The projects of the three peace fellows
must investigate "the phenomena of
peace," the fellowship founders decreed.
Public affairs fellowships are designed to
train about three people a year to work for
legislators and national administrators.
The staff and administration of the
institution cover a wide spectrum. The
director, W. Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of California
board of regents. The staff, which
represents 20 different countries and 30
languages, numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy and helps in
the selection of a director, consists of
corporate businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated Money
The institution was blessed from the
very beginning with more money than a
comparable public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to provide
funds, and in 1922 he gave $200,000
through the Commission for Relief in
Belgium.
Endowment and reserve funds are now
over $12,000,000. Gifts to the institution
have risen to over $2,000,000 a year. In
1971, David Packard gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now considered an
independent body within the University,
not just its stepchild in the backroom. The
hundreds of visitors who enter its glass
doors every day see only a small part of the
many facets of the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mysteriously in
the middle floors of the building, are open
only to the eyes of the librarians and
archivists. Even library patrons are not free
to browse — they must request specific
books, then wait for the search crew to
bring them.
Visitors in the elevator may get a
glimpse of the director's office, on the
same floor where Hoover himself once kept
an office. But the wealth of materials in
the archives hold a secret no one can ever
learn completely.

TOLLING FOR WHOM? — Electrical Engineering Prof. James Angell rings these
carillon bells, cast in Belgium for the 1939-40 World's Fair, everyday at noon
and 5 p.m. during the school year.
Everyone knows that once you're a
Stanford graduate, you'll get hit for money
for the rest of your life. Sooner or later,
everyone coughs up a couple thousand here
and there. Some even volunteer money,
perhaps as a good loophole. But with most
alumni it stops there. Herbert Hoover was
one of the exceptions.
Not only did Hoover offer money, he
also offered ideas — such as founding the
Food Research Institute and encouraging
the development of a business school. He
also started one of the world's most
complete collections on 20th century wars
and revolutions here.
The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, known to most
Stanford students only as that great
landmark in the sky, is a major center for
advanced scholarship in political science,
history, economics, and international law.
As student guides in the tower point out
to visitors, the institution is the third
largest archive in the nation — the largest
private archive.
It contains over 1,250,000 volumes,
including government documents, as well
as 3,000 archive units, which are usually
private collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries, and other
documents. Subscriptions to newspapers
and periodicals have netted over 30,000
titles on file.
Investigative Opportunities
What all these numbers signify to a
scholar is the possibility to thoroughly
investigate a subject — whether it be an
intense study of a particulai country, war,
or revolution, or a broad, comparative look

at a political or historical phenomenon.
The institution has published 275 volumes
since 1919 when Hoover founded it.
Examples of recent publications are:
The Stalinist Terror in the Thirties, the
North Korean Economy, Truman, the
Jewish Vote, and the Creation of Israel,
Yearbook on International Communist
Affairs: 1973 (seventh in a series), and A
Chinese-English Dictionary of Communist
Chinese Terminology.

heights above, Hoover staffers are
constantly seeking new items for their
collections. Although the institution began
as a vehicle to study World War I, Hoover's
statement of purpose that it "promote
peace" throughout the world led to its
expansion and constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese collections are
especially large. Hoover particularly
encouraged three areas of interest which

are still pursued today: domestic problems,
international studies, and scholarship
fellowships.
The library is divided into regional and
special collections: Africa, East Asia,
Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the British Labor
Collection, the Nicolaevsky Collection, and
the New Left Collection.
That same call for the promotion of
peace has led to the institution's striving to
serve as a dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest solutions, and
uncover trends in the world through its
research and publications.
Availability
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and archivists, the
institution makes its holdings available to
all Stanford students and faculty, and all
other scholars. Many authors and
researchers come from all over the world to
use the institution.
Recently a fellows program has been
established in three areas: public affairs,
peace, and national.
The fellowships are given to selected
applicants and allow them to spend time

"in unrestricted and creative work." The
national fellowships are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to use the
institution's resources. They may discuss
their projects with any of the scholars
connected with the institution.
Peace Fellows
The projects of the three peace fellows
must investigate "the phenomena of
peace," the fellowship founders decreed.
Public affairs fellowships are designed to
train about three people a year to work for
legislators and national administrators.
The staff and administration of the
institution cover a wide spectrum. The
director, W. Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of California
board of regents. The staff, which
represents 20 different countries and 30
languages, numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy and helps in
the selection of a director, consists of
corporate businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated Money
The institution was blessed from the
very beginning with more money than a
comparable public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to provide
funds, and in 1922 he gave $200,000
through the Commission for Relief in
Belgium.
Endowment and reserve funds are now
over $12,000,000. Gifts to the institution
have risen to over $2,000,000 a year. In
1971, David Packard gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now considered an
independent body within the University,
not just its stepchild in the backroom. The
hundreds of visitors who enter its glass
doors every day see only a small part of the
many facets of the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mysteriously in
the middle floors of the building, are open
only to the eyes of the librarians and
archivists. Even library patrons are not free
to browse — they must request specific
books, then wait for the search crew to
bring them.
Visitors in the elevator may get a
glimpse of the director's office, on the
same floor where Hoover himself once kept
an office. But the wealth of materials in
the archives hold a secret no one can ever
learn completely.

TOLLING FOR WHOM? — Electrical Engineering Prof. James Angell rings these
carillon bells, cast in Belgium for the 1939-40 World's Fair, everyday at noon
and 5 p.m. during the school year.
Everyone knows that once you're a
Stanford graduate, you'll get hit for money
for the rest of your life. Sooner or later,
everyone coughs up a couple thousand here
and there. Some even volunteer money,
perhaps as a good loophole. But with most
alumni it stops there. Herbert Hoover was
one of the exceptions.
Not only did Hoover offer money, he
also offered ideas — such as founding the
Food Research Institute and encouraging
the development of a business school. He
also started one of the world's most
complete collections on 20th century wars
and revolutions here.
The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, known to most
Stanford students only as that great
landmark in the sky, is a major center for
advanced scholarship in political science,
history, economics, and international law.
As student guides in the tower point out
to visitors, the institution is the third
largest archive in the nation — the largest
private archive.
It contains over 1,250,000 volumes,
including government documents, as well
as 3,000 archive units, which are usually
private collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries, and other
documents. Subscriptions to newspapers
and periodicals have netted over 30,000
titles on file.
Investigative Opportunities
What all these numbers signify to a
scholar is the possibility to thoroughly
investigate a subject — whether it be an
intense study of a particulai country, war,
or revolution, or a broad, comparative look

at a political or historical phenomenon.
The institution has published 275 volumes
since 1919 when Hoover founded it.
Examples of recent publications are:
The Stalinist Terror in the Thirties, the
North Korean Economy, Truman, the
Jewish Vote, and the Creation of Israel,
Yearbook on International Communist
Affairs: 1973 (seventh in a series), and A
Chinese-English Dictionary of Communist
Chinese Terminology.
As American Relief Administration
Director in Europe during World War I,
Hoover began his collection with the help
of Stanford professors Ephraim Adams and
Ralph Lutz. He hoped that the materials
they gathered would provide the data with
which future historians could work. Lutz
became the institution's director in 1925.
Main Library
Until 1939, the collected materials were
stored in various places on campus — many
in the main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the masses of
documents the collecting team sent back at
the end of the war.
Recognizing the need for a separate
building, the founders set about raising
money. By 1939, they were ready to start
constructing the tower, which was
dedicated in 1941.
With a permanent base and storage
space, the institution was freed for further
acquisition and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated in 1967 and
houses the East Asian and newspaper
collections and also 36 research offices. A
third building is planned.
285-Foot Tower
The 285-foot tower holds the library
and main archives — there are 17 levels of
stacks — as well as administrative and
research offices, two reading rooms, two
display rooms of Hoover memorabilia, and
a 35-bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium for the
1939-40 World's Fair, and were later
donated to Hoover by the Belgian
American Educational Foundation. Hoover
gave them to the institution, which placed
them on top of the tower.
Electrical Engineering Professor James
Angell plays the carillon at noon and 5
p.m. every day during the school year.
Three students, Rick Anderson, Peggy
Hurd, and Joan Ferguson, also play the
bells.

board of regents. The staff, which
represents 20 different countries and 30
languages, numbers 150.
The board of overseers of the
institution, which sets policy and helps in
the selection of a director, consists of
corporate businessmen and notables from
all over the nation.
Donated Money
The institution was blessed from the
very beginning with more money than a
comparable public archives might find.
Hoover was always on hand to provide
funds, and in 1922 he gave $200,000
through the Commission for Relief in
Belgium.
Endowment and reserve funds are now
over $12,000,000. Gifts to the institution
have risen to over $2,000,000 a year. In
1971, David Packard gave $1.2 million.
The institution is now considered an
independent body within the University,
not just its stepchild in the backroom. The
hundreds of visitors who enter its glass
doors every day see only a small part of the
many facets of the institution.
The stacks, which lurk mysteriously in
the middle floors of the building, are open
only to the eyes of the librarians and
archivists. Even library patrons are not free
to browse — they must request specific
books, then wait for the search crew to
bring them.
Visitors in the elevator may get a
glimpse of the director's office, on the
same floor where Hoover himself once kept
an office. But the wealth of materials in
the archives hold a secret no one can ever
learn completely.

TOLLING FOR WHOM? — Electrical Engineering Prof. James Angell rings these
carillon bells, cast in Belgium for the 1939-40 World's Fair, everyday at noon
and 5 p.m. during the school year.
Everyone knows that once you're a
Stanford graduate, you'll get hit for money
for the rest of your life. Sooner or later,
everyone coughs up a couple thousand here
and there. Some even volunteer money,
perhaps as a good loophole. But with most
alumni it stops there. Herbert Hoover was
one of the exceptions.
Not only did Hoover offer money, he
also offered ideas — such as founding the
Food Research Institute and encouraging
the development of a business school. He
also started one of the world's most
complete collections on 20th century wars
and revolutions here.
The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, known to most
Stanford students only as that great
landmark in the sky, is a major center for
advanced scholarship in political science,
history, economics, and international law.
As student guides in the tower point out
to visitors, the institution is the third
largest archive in the nation — the largest
private archive.
It contains over 1,250,000 volumes,
including government documents, as well
as 3,000 archive units, which are usually
private collections of papers, letters,
memos, pamphlets, diaries, and other
documents. Subscriptions to newspapers
and periodicals have netted over 30,000
titles on file.
Investigative Opportunities
What all these numbers signify to a
scholar is the possibility to thoroughly
investigate a subject — whether it be an
intense study of a particulai country, war,
or revolution, or a broad, comparative look

at a political or historical phenomenon.
The institution has published 275 volumes
since 1919 when Hoover founded it.
Examples of recent publications are:
The Stalinist Terror in the Thirties, the
North Korean Economy, Truman, the
Jewish Vote, and the Creation of Israel,
Yearbook on International Communist
Affairs: 1973 (seventh in a series), and A
Chinese-English Dictionary of Communist
Chinese Terminology.
As American Relief Administration
Director in Europe during World War I,
Hoover began his collection with the help
of Stanford professors Ephraim Adams and
Ralph Lutz. He hoped that the materials
they gathered would provide the data with
which future historians could work. Lutz
became the institution's director in 1925.
Main Library
Until 1939, the collected materials were
stored in various places on campus — many
in the main library. The library was not
really prepared to store the masses of
documents the collecting team sent back at
the end of the war.
Recognizing the need for a separate
building, the founders set about raising
money. By 1939, they were ready to start
constructing the tower, which was
dedicated in 1941.
With a permanent base and storage
space, the institution was freed for further
acquisition and expansion. The Lou Henry
Hoover Building was dedicated in 1967 and
houses the East Asian and newspaper
collections and also 36 research offices. A
third building is planned.
285-Foot Tower
The 285-foot tower holds the library
and main archives — there are 17 levels of
stacks — as well as administrative and
research offices, two reading rooms, two
display rooms of Hoover memorabilia, and
a 35-bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium for the
1939-40 World's Fair, and were later
donated to Hoover by the Belgian
American Educational Foundation. Hoover
gave them to the institution, which placed
them on top of the tower.
Electrical Engineering Professor James
Angell plays the carillon at noon and 5
p.m. every day during the school year.
Three students, Rick Anderson, Peggy
Hurd, and Joan Ferguson, also play the
bells.
4 A ngell's Music'
As "Angell's music" descends from the
heights above, Hoover staffers are
constantly seeking new items for their
collections. Although the institution began
as a vehicle to study World War I, Hoover's
statement of purpose that it "promote
peace" throughout the world led to its
expansion and constant acquisitions.
The Soviet and Chinese collections are
especially large. Hoover particularly
encouraged three areas of interest which

are still pursued today: domestic problems,
international studies, and scholarship
fellowships.
The library is divided into regional and
special collections: Africa, East Asia,
Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle
East, Western Europe, the British Labor
Collection, the Nicolaevsky Collection, and
the New Left Collection.
That same call for the promotion of
peace has led to the institution's striving to
serve as a dynamic force, attempting to
diagnose problems, suggest solutions, and
uncover trends in the world through its
research and publications.
Availability
As well as employing a staff of
permanent researchers and archivists, the
institution makes its holdings available to
all Stanford students and faculty, and all
other scholars. Many authors and
researchers come from all over the world to
use the institution.
Recently a fellows program has been
established in three areas: public affairs,
peace, and national.
The fellowships are given to selected
applicants and allow them to spend time

"in unrestricted and creative work." The
national fellowships are given to
approximately 10 people a year.
For one year they are free to use the
institution's resources. They may discuss
their projects with any of the scholars
connected with the institution.
Peace Fellows
The projects of the three peace fellows
must investigate "the phenomena of
peace," the fellowship founders decreed.
Public affairs fellowships are designed to
train about three people a year to work for
legislators and national administrators.
The staff and administration of the
institution cover a wide spectrum. The
director, W. Glenn Campbell, is also a
member of the University of California
board of regents. The staff, which
represents 20 different countries and 30
languages, numbers 150.
