# Herbert Hoover's Career: The Triumph And Tragedy
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
When the first World War elided, Herbert
Hoover was the second most revered man in the
western world; little more than a decade later, he
was among the most vilified; and slums were
called "Hoovervillcs."
In such terms as I hose. Dr. Otis A. Pease, Pro
fessor of Modern American History, began to re
create the triumph and tragedy which co-mingled
to define the career of the 31st President of the
United States.
In 102! l. the bottom fell out ol the stock market,
and for three years absolutely nothing moved.
America had come to a full slop. Hoover, not
responsible for the economic debacle, nonetheless
tnire the lull brunt ol national enmity. By 1932.
repudiated by the country he sought to lead, he
was a broken man.
The M»3'2 Inaugural, as Pease recreates it, was
mc of those rare instants when history seems
to suspend motion and become embodied in a sym
bol
AS lIOOVI.K and Roosevelt 1 ravelled in the
inaugural parade, the outgoing president was a
study in despondency. Sixty, he looked seventy.
Roosevelt, in contrast. looked younger than his
fifty-two years, as he fidgeted and smiled and
waved to the crowd.
And so they rode together down Pennsylvania
Avenue . . . Roosevelt, the boy borne with a golden
spoon in his mouth, and Hoover, the sell made

man. the American Dream come true Horatio
Alger in the flesh.
The 1932 election was not a test between die
hard "conservatism" and expansive "liberalism."
It was a test of temperment in meeting a crisis and
in realizing new possibilities of action.
NEW KKAL was as yet nothing more than a
mood, a willingness to experiment; but the flexi
bility of action it implied, the flexibility of thought
FDR found so congenial and so natural, was pre
cisely that quality in which Hoover was most de
ficient.
Hoover was not against federal spending, but
he was adamant on a balanced budget. The gov
ernment must do nothing that the private sector
ought to be doing.
So Hoover gave the business community its
chance; and they failed him. Paralysis set in. The
cheer emanating from the White House in the
early days of the depression soon became a mask
to hide despair.
Having committed himself to a set philosophy
of action. Hoover found it impossible to compro
mise. Integrity had become stubbornness.
In 1932, the United States was in a period of
crisis a crisis which demanded a man who could,
by sheer force of personality if necessary, gal
vanize the imagination of an apathetic populace.
Tragically, Hoover was not that man.
Redemption of a sort came to him in later
years, as a prosperous nation overlooked his fail
ures and remembered instead Itis great humanity
and public service.

chance; and they failed him. Paralysis set in. The
