# Aimed At Middleclass, Middleaged
## 'Memory Of Us' Disappoints 
### KAREN LACHENAUER 
Audiences looking for The Way
We Were in Memory Of Us — a
film written by a woman about a
woman — will be disappointed.
Nor will they find in this
independent production the
youth-oriented liberation ideology
frequently seen these days on
television, though the film's low
budget makes it look very much
like a made-for-TV movie.
While sensitive, the portrait of
a stagnating suburban housewife
drawn by actor Will Geer's
31-year-old daughter Ellen plays
to middle-class, middle-aged
experience.
Previewing free of charge here
last Monday night, it pointed up a
generation gap in a nearly filled
Memorial Auditorium.
Over 40
Women on the nether side of
the age 40-or-so dividing line
voiced great liking for the film in
a post-screening panel discussion
with writer/star Geer and director
H. Kaye Dyal. But younger
viewers were reserved if not
caustic in their appraisal.
"I felt ambivalent about it

because the main character was
operating in isolation," said
Stanford film instructor Kris
Samuelson. "She needed a strong
role model."
In Memory Of Us, Betty (Geer)
marries an account executive,
bears him two children, and
ultimately drives away from ranch
house, family and maid in her
station wagon.
During the intervening nine
years of "perfect marriage," she
feels mounting confinement — a
sensation her friends combat with
mate-swapping. Somehow
different, Betty eschews this
antiboredom device, renting a
motel room where she can
practice photography and be
herself a few hours a day.
Unresolved
Her resolution is unclear,
however; after briefly pretending
at her first swing party that a
cowboy pick-up (engagingly
played by Peter Brown) is an
extramarital interest, she leaves
home for who knows where or
what. "I'll get a typing job,
maybe," she muses.
"I didn't want to write a

message film," real life divorcee
and mother-of-one Geer told the
audience in explaining the movie's
formlessness. Having worked in
the theater from age 14, Geer
drew on interviews with
housewives for her material,
leading her to observe that "many
women are afraid and alone in
their homes."
But numerous college-age
viewers protested that "the ending
was a cop-out." Suggested one:
"Perhaps you should have shown
an example of a woman getting
back on her feet."
"That film must be next!"
Geer agreed.
Male director Dyal fielded
criticism for not having
relinquished this, his feature
debut, to a woman. "Frankly, I
was looking for opportunities to
work," he admitted somewhat
shamefacedly. "Anyone would
have jumped at the chance.
"No woman asked to direct
it,"he added.
Draws Applause
Visiting English professor
Wendy Martin drew applause for
elaborating on the final complaint
leveled, that Betty's well-heeled
boy and girl were channeled
toward their parents' societal
roles. "The litue boy will grow up
to be what I call a 'cheerful
chauvinist,'" said Martin,
"because, let's face it, everything's
going his way."
But despite Betty's material
assets and her employing a

housekeeper (in whose person
Rose Marie has little room to
wield possibly limited talents),
older women saw their condition
represented accurately and
compassionately.
"Are jobs and an education so
needed?" asked one, rising. "You
need to feel intrinsically adequate,
first. Here was a woman
poignantly searching for herself."
Only recently turned
dramatist, Geer has said she tries
to write "real words for real
women to say." Though the script
suffers plot-wise for being
"message-less," or just plain thin,

she has achieved moments of
verbal truth, Pregnant, Betty tells
her husband between labor pains,
"I'm driving (to the hospital). I
have to concentrate." Another
time she confides to the dog while
waiting for the kids after school,
"We've got a lot in common;
we're both retrievers."
Acting Strong
Made on a penurious $250,000
budget, Memory Of Us handles
smoothly — as Samuelson noted,
"the lighting is nice and the
camera works well" (only never
ingeniously). Appropriately, the
film's strongest point is its acting.
Geer's veteran father delivers a
cameo rendition of the
all-knowing motel owner; Geer
herself and her cohorts, many
from one repertory company, are
comfortable, consistent and
subdued in their parts. It becomes
obvious, in fact, that Geer is an
expert and promising actress.

the theater from age 14, Geer
drew on interviews with
housewives for her material,
leading her to observe that "many
women are afraid and alone in
their homes."
But numerous college-age
viewers protested that "the ending
was a cop-out." Suggested one:
"Perhaps you should have shown
an example of a woman getting
back on her feet."
"That film must be next!"
Geer agreed.
Male director Dyal fielded
criticism for not having
relinquished this, his feature
debut, to a woman. "Frankly, I
was looking for opportunities to
work," he admitted somewhat
shamefacedly. "Anyone would
have jumped at the chance.
"No woman asked to direct
it,"he added.
Draws Applause
Visiting English professor
Wendy Martin drew applause for
elaborating on the final complaint
leveled, that Betty's well-heeled
boy and girl were channeled
toward their parents' societal
roles. "The litue boy will grow up
to be what I call a 'cheerful
chauvinist,'" said Martin,
"because, let's face it, everything's
going his way."
But despite Betty's material
assets and her employing a

housekeeper (in whose person
Rose Marie has little room to
wield possibly limited talents),
older women saw their condition
represented accurately and
compassionately.
"Are jobs and an education so
needed?" asked one, rising. "You
need to feel intrinsically adequate,
first. Here was a woman
poignantly searching for herself."
Only recently turned
dramatist, Geer has said she tries
to write "real words for real
women to say." Though the script
suffers plot-wise for being
"message-less," or just plain thin,

she has achieved moments of
verbal truth, Pregnant, Betty tells
her husband between labor pains,
"I'm driving (to the hospital). I
have to concentrate." Another
time she confides to the dog while
waiting for the kids after school,
"We've got a lot in common;
we're both retrievers."
Acting Strong
Made on a penurious $250,000
budget, Memory Of Us handles
smoothly — as Samuelson noted,
"the lighting is nice and the
camera works well" (only never
ingeniously). Appropriately, the
film's strongest point is its acting.
Geer's veteran father delivers a
cameo rendition of the
all-knowing motel owner; Geer
herself and her cohorts, many
from one repertory company, are
comfortable, consistent and
subdued in their parts. It becomes
obvious, in fact, that Geer is an
expert and promising actress.

ACTRESS AND WRITER — Ellen Geer, star and writer of Memory
Of Us appeared in Memorial Auditorium Monday to discuss her film.
Audiences looking for The Way
We Were in Memory Of Us — a
film written by a woman about a
woman — will be disappointed.
Nor will they find in this
independent production the
youth-oriented liberation ideology
frequently seen these days on
television, though the film's low
budget makes it look very much
like a made-for-TV movie.
While sensitive, the portrait of
a stagnating suburban housewife
drawn by actor Will Geer's
31-year-old daughter Ellen plays
to middle-class, middle-aged
experience.
Previewing free of charge here
last Monday night, it pointed up a
generation gap in a nearly filled
Memorial Auditorium.
Over 40
Women on the nether side of
the age 40-or-so dividing line
voiced great liking for the film in
a post-screening panel discussion
with writer/star Geer and director
H. Kaye Dyal. But younger
viewers were reserved if not
caustic in their appraisal.
"I felt ambivalent about it

because the main character was
operating in isolation," said
Stanford film instructor Kris
Samuelson. "She needed a strong
role model."
In Memory Of Us, Betty (Geer)
marries an account executive,
bears him two children, and
ultimately drives away from ranch
house, family and maid in her
station wagon.
During the intervening nine
years of "perfect marriage," she
feels mounting confinement — a
sensation her friends combat with
mate-swapping. Somehow
different, Betty eschews this
antiboredom device, renting a
motel room where she can
practice photography and be
herself a few hours a day.
Unresolved
Her resolution is unclear,
however; after briefly pretending
at her first swing party that a
cowboy pick-up (engagingly
played by Peter Brown) is an
extramarital interest, she leaves
home for who knows where or
what. "I'll get a typing job,
maybe," she muses.
"I didn't want to write a

message film," real life divorcee
and mother-of-one Geer told the
audience in explaining the movie's
formlessness. Having worked in
the theater from age 14, Geer
drew on interviews with

"the lighting is nice and the
camera works well" (only never
ingeniously). Appropriately, the
film's strongest point is its acting.
Geer's veteran father delivers a
cameo rendition of the
all-knowing motel owner; Geer
herself and her cohorts, many
from one repertory company, are
comfortable, consistent and
subdued in their parts. It becomes
obvious, in fact, that Geer is an
expert and promising actress.

ACTRESS AND WRITER — Ellen Geer, star and writer of Memory
Of Us appeared in Memorial Auditorium Monday to discuss her film.
Audiences looking for The Way
We Were in Memory Of Us — a
film written by a woman about a
woman — will be disappointed.
Nor will they find in this
independent production the
youth-oriented liberation ideology
frequently seen these days on
television, though the film's low
budget makes it look very much
like a made-for-TV movie.
While sensitive, the portrait of
a stagnating suburban housewife
drawn by actor Will Geer's
31-year-old daughter Ellen plays
to middle-class, middle-aged
experience.
Previewing free of charge here
last Monday night, it pointed up a
generation gap in a nearly filled
Memorial Auditorium.
Over 40
Women on the nether side of
the age 40-or-so dividing line
voiced great liking for the film in
a post-screening panel discussion
with writer/star Geer and director
H. Kaye Dyal. But younger
viewers were reserved if not
caustic in their appraisal.
"I felt ambivalent about it

because the main character was
operating in isolation," said
Stanford film instructor Kris
Samuelson. "She needed a strong
role model."
In Memory Of Us, Betty (Geer)
marries an account executive,
bears him two children, and
ultimately drives away from ranch
house, family and maid in her
station wagon.
During the intervening nine
years of "perfect marriage," she
feels mounting confinement — a
sensation her friends combat with
mate-swapping. Somehow
different, Betty eschews this
antiboredom device, renting a
motel room where she can
practice photography and be
herself a few hours a day.
Unresolved
Her resolution is unclear,
however; after briefly pretending
at her first swing party that a
cowboy pick-up (engagingly
played by Peter Brown) is an
extramarital interest, she leaves
home for who knows where or
what. "I'll get a typing job,
maybe," she muses.
"I didn't want to write a

message film," real life divorcee
and mother-of-one Geer told the
audience in explaining the movie's
formlessness. Having worked in
the theater from age 14, Geer
drew on interviews with
housewives for her material,
leading her to observe that "many
women are afraid and alone in
their homes."
But numerous college-age
viewers protested that "the ending
was a cop-out." Suggested one:
"Perhaps you should have shown
an example of a woman getting
back on her feet."
"That film must be next!"
Geer agreed.
Male director Dyal fielded
criticism for not having
relinquished this, his feature
debut, to a woman. "Frankly, I
was looking for opportunities to
work," he admitted somewhat
shamefacedly. "Anyone would
have jumped at the chance.
"No woman asked to direct
it,"he added.
Draws Applause
Visiting English professor
Wendy Martin drew applause for
elaborating on the final complaint
leveled, that Betty's well-heeled
boy and girl were channeled
toward their parents' societal
roles. "The litue boy will grow up
to be what I call a 'cheerful
chauvinist,'" said Martin,
"because, let's face it, everything's
going his way."
But despite Betty's material
assets and her employing a

housekeeper (in whose person
Rose Marie has little room to
wield possibly limited talents),
older women saw their condition
represented accurately and
compassionately.
"Are jobs and an education so
needed?" asked one, rising. "You
need to feel intrinsically adequate,
first. Here was a woman
poignantly searching for herself."
Only recently turned
dramatist, Geer has said she tries
to write "real words for real
women to say." Though the script
suffers plot-wise for being
"message-less," or just plain thin,

she has achieved moments of
verbal truth, Pregnant, Betty tells
her husband between labor pains,
"I'm driving (to the hospital). I
have to concentrate." Another
time she confides to the dog while
waiting for the kids after school,
"We've got a lot in common;
we're both retrievers."
Acting Strong
Made on a penurious $250,000
budget, Memory Of Us handles
smoothly — as Samuelson noted,
"the lighting is nice and the
camera works well" (only never
ingeniously). Appropriately, the
film's strongest point is its acting.
