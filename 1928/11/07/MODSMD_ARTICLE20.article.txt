# Preservation Band Shines At Concord

### DAN FORTE 
(Editor's Note: This is the second
report from the Concord Summer
Festival by 'Daily' resident jazz
critic Dan Forte.)

The sixth annual Concord
Summer Festival wasted no time
in getting their second weekend
rolling by presenting New Orleans'
legendary Preservation Hall Jazz
Band.
The band is billed as the
"happiest entertainment in
America," a title which will never
be disputed in Concord.
Composed of trumpeter Percy
Humphrey (age 69), brother Willie
Humphrey (73) on clarinet,
drummer Cie Frazier (70), pianist
James "Sing" Miller (somewhere
in his 60s), and trumbonist "Big
Jim" Robinson (84!), with Frank
Demont on banjo and the group's
founder, Allan Jaffe, on tuba (the
two "youngsters"), the band did
what it inevitably succeeds in
doing; making each and every
listener fall in love with New
Orleans, Dixieland, and
Preservation Hall.
Legends
No group of any size or style
can project as much personality as
these walking legends; Frazier,
Miller, and Percy solemnly taking
their places, starting into
"Hindustan;" Willie Humphrey
strutting in from the wings after

one chorus, clarinet pointing to
the clouds; "Big Jim" beginning
to dance before even getting on
stage; Jaffe's never-ending
bouncing to the beat, Demont's
never-ending smile.
Robinson and Willie Humphrey
are the obvious crowd-pleasers;
"Big Jim" because of his
continual dancing and cheer
leading, Willie because he happens
to be the greatest living New
Orleans clarinetist.
Appropriately, at show's end
one ecstatic young woman made
her way past the ushers and
guards, to the stage, and gave both
of them a big hug.
'Saints'
After an hour of Dixieland
specialties, including a fine
rendition of "Basin Street Blues,"
and Sing Miller's vocal on "Jelly,
Jelly," the band returned for the
classic "When The Saints Go
Marching In," with Willie
Humphrey leading the crowd (all
6,000-plus on their feet at this
point) through the aisles, New
Orleans style.
Not to say that the rest of the
weekend was all downhill, but top
honors for the festival would have
to go to the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band.
Filling the ominous task of
"following act" was the Herb
Ellis-Ray Brown Quintet, which

turned out to be a sextet with the
unannounced addition of
saxophonist Plas Johnson.
The rest of the band consisted
of Harry "Sweets" Edison,
long-time trumpeter with Count
Basie, pianist George Duke,
drummer Jake Hanna, and of
course Ellis and Brown on guitar
and bass.
'Indigo' Tribute
Their host tune vvas, as Brown
put it, "something everyone will
be doing and should be doing," in
memory of the late Duke
Ellington, "Mood Indigo."
Trumpeter Bill Berry and his
L.A. Big Band were next,
featuring 17 of jazz' finest.
Worthy of special mention is
the group's trumpet section, with
Berry, Conte Condoli, Gene Goe,
the great Blue Mitchell, and
Ellington-alumnus Cat Anderson,
whose stratospheric heights
allegedly had dogs howling all
over the Bay Area.
Along with some new material
composed by Berry, the band paid
homage to Duke (with
"Rock-A-Bye River"), and the
late Paul Gonzalves (Ellington's
tenor saxophonist who passed
away just a couple of weeks
before the Duke), with "A Little
Song For Mex."
The band, whose sound is
similar to the Basie style, closed

with the Count's classic "Every
Tub," featuring a friendly cutting
session between Mitchell and
Condoli, and returned to encore
with Duke's "Rockin' In
Rhythm."
Saturday night saw the best of
all the Ellington tributes when
pianist Father Tom Vaughn's trio
played a mournful, slow version
of "Satin Doll," with Vaughn, an
Episcopalian priest, suggesting
that Ellington had done more for
world peace than any three
bishops he could name.
Chuck Mangione's quartet
followed with Gerry Niewood on
woodwinds, drummer Joe
La√üarbera, bassist Ed Williams 111,
Mangione on fluglehorn and

electric piano, and
(unfortunately) vocalist Esther
Satterfield.
After a few nice instrumentals,
beginning with "The Legend of
the One-Eyed Sailor," the group
settled on backing Miss Satterfield
for the remainder of the set, thus
changing its sound completely,
Mangione rarely touched his horn
after the first three instrumentals.
Satterfield sings in a pop-ish
style with a voice remarkably
close to Dionne Warwick's. Most
of her selections were Mangione
compositions, with the exception
of Miriam Makeba's "Retreat
Song," and a non-descript
run-through of "The Summer of
'42."
