# Man Ray's Photos Shock Senses
## 
### KENNETH WAHL 
SAN FRANCISCO - Man Ray
approached photography as a
painter would approach his
brushes, paint, and canvas. Every
one of his photographs exploit the
special effects that may be
attained with photographic
apparatus and materials.
These photographs are being
shown in an exhibition titled
"Photo Graphics" at the San
Francisco Museum of Art until
September 8. All of the exhibited
photographs are from the
collection of Arnold Crane, an
historian of photography, who
became acquainted with Man Ray
in 1968. Since then Crane has
assembled one of the two most
extensive collections of Man Ray's
work in the world.
The exhibition's title, "Photo
Graphics," is probably the most
appropriate term in referring to
Man Ray's photographs. Man Ray
imbued each photo with a novelty
that immediately extends it
beyond mere photographic
depiction. His techniques were as
varied as his immagination.
For instance, Man Ray's

portraits are often made up of
several negatives in order to
capture the most outstanding
features of the sitter's face. Some
of his photographs are solarized,
meaning that the negatives are
flashed with light, reversing the
tonal effects, so that an eerie light
permeates the ambience of each
solarized picture.
However the technique for
which Man Ray has become
notorious is Rayography,
consequently named after him.
A "Rayograph" is a piece of
light sensitive paper, that was first
covered with various objects,
anywhere from gears to gauze to
pistols and lingerie, before being
exposed to light. The impressions
left by the objects on the paper
create scenes of luminescent,
mystical forms floating in a void
of darkness.
The year that Man Ray

developed the "Rayograph,"
1922, he showed some to Tristan
Tzara, the major progenitor of
Dadaism — a movement that
attempted to eliminate the
conventional boundaries of art.
Tzara exclaimed, "Man, these are
Dada."
Since then Man Ray has been
marked down in the annals of art
history as a dadaist. This
reputation is not only because of
his photographs, but primarily
because of the many objects he
made that stretched the limits of
art. One of them is a sewing
machine wrapped in a blanket,
entwined with cord and titled
"Enigma of Isadore Ducasse;"
another is an iron with tacks
protruding from the base.
Whatever Man Ray's work, it is
always consistent in one respect;
it always has the ability to either
shock or surprise the viewer.

conventional boundaries of art.
Tzara exclaimed, "Man, these are
Dada."
Since then Man Ray has been
marked down in the annals of art
history as a dadaist. This
reputation is not only because of
his photographs, but primarily
because of the many objects he
made that stretched the limits of
art. One of them is a sewing
machine wrapped in a blanket,
entwined with cord and titled
"Enigma of Isadore Ducasse;"
another is an iron with tacks
protruding from the base.
Whatever Man Ray's work, it is
always consistent in one respect;
it always has the ability to either
shock or surprise the viewer.

Man Ray whose work is on

SAN FRANCISCO - Man Ray
approached photography as a
painter would approach his
brushes, paint, and canvas. Every
one of his photographs exploit the
special effects that may be
attained with photographic
apparatus and materials.
These photographs are being
shown in an exhibition titled
"Photo Graphics" at the San
Francisco Museum of Art until
September 8. All of the exhibited
photographs are from the
collection of Arnold Crane, an
historian of photography, who
became acquainted with Man Ray
in 1968. Since then Crane has
assembled one of the two most
extensive collections of Man Ray's
work in the world.
The exhibition's title, "Photo
Graphics," is probably the most
appropriate term in referring to
Man Ray's photographs. Man Ray
imbued each photo with a novelty
that immediately extends it
beyond mere photographic
depiction. His techniques were as
varied as his immagination.
For instance, Man Ray's

portraits are often made up of
several negatives in order to
capture the most outstanding
features of the sitter's face. Some
of his photographs are solarized,
meaning that the negatives are
flashed with light, reversing the
tonal effects, so that an eerie light
permeates the ambience of each
solarized picture.
However the technique for
which Man Ray has become
notorious is Rayography,
consequently named after him.
A "Rayograph" is a piece of
light sensitive paper, that was first
covered with various objects,
anywhere from gears to gauze to
pistols and lingerie, before being
exposed to light. The impressions
left by the objects on the paper
create scenes of luminescent,
mystical forms floating in a void
of darkness.
The year that Man Ray

developed the "Rayograph,"
1922, he showed some to Tristan
Tzara, the major progenitor of
Dadaism — a movement that
attempted to eliminate the
conventional boundaries of art.
Tzara exclaimed, "Man, these are
