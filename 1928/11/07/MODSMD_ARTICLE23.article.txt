Ford Studies V.P. Possibilities
WASHINGTON — Speculation ran rampant yesterday
over the question of who the new President, Gerald Ford,
would select to succeed him as Vice President.
Ford asked his aides Monday night to draw up a list of
potential successors. The Chicago Sun-Times reported
yesterday that the list includes 14 persons, all
Republicans.
Intimates of Ford said the selection process would take
at least a week or two. Less than a year ago, Ford himself
was selected Vice President after the resignation of Spiro
Agnew.
The favorite for the post, many observers say, is Melvin
Laird, former defense secretary and congressman from
Wisconsin. Laird and Ford were friends when they led
House Republicans during the Johnson administration.
Another name frequently mentioned is that of former
New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Rockefeller's
selection is said to be opposed by many members of both
parties.
Others on the list include former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson; Sens. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward
Brooke of Massachusetts, Charles Percy of Illinois, William
Brock of Tennessee, Robert Taft of Ohio and Robert
Stafford of Vermont, Gov. Ronald Reagan of California;
Reps. Albert Quie of Minnesota and John Anderson of
Illinois; and former Sen. Charles Goodell of New York.
Ford reportedly has said he wants a Vice President who
can help reunite the Republican party, which was badly
split by the controversy over Nixon's impeachment.
Last night, Reagan removed himself from consideration
from the list of hopefuls and suggested Ford choose
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, leader of the Congressional
conservatives.
Cyprus Truce Disintegrating
GENEVA — The Greek delegate to the Cyprus peace
talks in Geneva warned sternly yesterday that Turkish
violations of the cease-fire accord are making full-scale war
likely.
Greek Foreign Minister George Mavros said that the
country's new civilian regime might be forced to declare
war if it were the only alternative to humiliation.

He called on Turkey to give back 40 square miles of
territory he says it has seized since the in-place cease-fire
was signed July 30.
Peace talks reconvened yesterday, with officials of the
United States, Soviet Union, Great Britain and United
Nations on hand to try to reconcile the Greeks and Turks.
While Greek spokesmen made claims of Turkish
atrocities, the Turkish government denied any such
allegations, calling them "a campaign of lies."
Turkey is said to be holding out for autonomy for the
minority of Turkish Cypriots, and is backing its claim with
military might.
As talks continued, so did fighting. A British television
soundman was killed yesterday by a land mine. Four other
persons were injured in the incident, which occurred as a
press convoy entered Lapithos, in northern Cyprus.
In the capital city of Nicosia, heavy small-arms and
mortar fire broke out again yesterday.
Vietnam Fighting Intensifies
SAIGON — South Vietnamese government warplanes
yesterday struck back at an insurgent offensive, hitting
roads on the route to the beseiged town of Due Due.
The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops are
attempting to take over Due Due as the latest move in
their offensive aimed at the key city of Da Nang. Earlier
this week, the rebel forces overran the provincial capital of
Thuong Due and completely destroyed that city's
500-man defense force.
In Washington, U.S. officials reported consternation.
Some officials suggested that Hanoi was taking advantage
of U.S. internal turmoil to launch a country-wide
offensive.
Reports indicated that North Vietnam had alerted six
home-based divisions, possibly for use in all-out offensive
to take over South Vietnam.
Fighting recently has been the worst since the Paris
peace agreement 18 months ago.
Wholesale Priees Rise Sharply
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices jumped 3.7 percent
last month, a huge gain which portends higher consumer
prices, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
The monthly increase, which registers 44.4 percent on

an annual rate, is the largest since last August.
Farm prices accounted for most of the gain. The cost of
livestock and grain has risen sharply because of the
drought which plagues most of the Midwest.
Industrial prices also accounted for part of the gain.
The only major commodity to show a decline in prices was
lumber.
Wholesale prices are 20.4 percent higher than they were
one year ago at this time.
Reagan Affirms Out-Of-State Trips
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan said yesterday
he would go ahead with planned trips out of the state even
though they will leave Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke acting as
governor.
Reinecke has been convicted of perjury, a felony, but
has announced his intention to remain in office until after
sentencing Aug. 30. Several groups are seeking to force
Reinecke to resign immediately.
Reagan's office said that the governor planned to make
two brief out-of-state appearances. Tomorrow, he will
address a Young Republicans group in Nevada, while
Sunday he will visit a G.O.P. fund-raising picnic in the
state of Washington.
Reagan's office said that during his out-of-state trips,
"the governor will be in constant communication with the
Capitol.
House Passes Reform Bill
WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives
yesterday approved a strong campaign financing reform
bill.
The measure, inspired by the excesses of the 1972
campaign, sets limits of political contributions, restricts
the spending of candidates, provides federal subsidies for
Presidential conventions, primaries, and elections, and
establishes a board to enforce these rules.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except for low clouds late night
and mornings. Highs in the 80s to low 90s, lows tonight in
the upper 50s to low 60s. Northwest winds 10 to 20 miles
per hour afternoons.
