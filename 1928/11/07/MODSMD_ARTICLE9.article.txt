# Hoover's Student Years Boast Financial Success
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Herbert Clark Hoover made a
habit of spending his summer
vacations on geological survey
jobs, natural enough for a college
geology major. Between his junior
and senior years, he was the
youngest member of a federal
expedition in the High Sierras.
Being youngest, he was
appointed disbursing officer,
which made him responsible to
the federal government for every
penny spent on the expedition.
One morning Hoover
discovered one of the pack mules
was dead. He owed $60 to the
government unless he and two
witnesses made a full statement of
the circumstances of death and
swore to its truth before a notary
public.
Hoover and the witnesses
performed an autopsy on the
mule. They said the autopsy
revealed that the mule, which had
been tied to a tree, had scratched
his head with his hind foot,
getting his hoof tangled in the
halter top. In trying to jerk out of
the position the mule had
evidently broken his neck.
Two months later Hoover was
advised that $60 had been
deducted from his pay because his
story was too improbable.
"Apparently mules did not,
according to the book, scratch
their heads with their hind feet,"
Hoover wrote in his Memoirs.
Dr. Waldemar Lindgren, who
was in charge of the survey,
absorbed the loss, vowing he
would collect it from some
"damned bureaucrat" in
Washington.
Confirmation
Hoover meanwhile "watched
every mule I met for confirmation
of my story. I can confirm that
they do it,"he recorded. But
twelve years later when he next
met Lindgren, Hoover learned
that the "damned bureaucrat"
hadn't paid the $60. "And do you
know I have since seen a hundred

mules scratch their heads with
their hind feet?" Lindgren told
Hoover.
Stories such as this highlight
Hoover's college years. He was a
member of Stanford's freshman
class in 1891, the year the
University opened. Most accounts
say he was the first person
assigned to Encina Hall, then the
men's dormitory, and the first
person to sleep under its roof.
To talk about Hoover's success
at the University one looks to his
financial accomplishments. On
both a personal and a
University-wide level he proved an
aptitude for handling monetary
duties.
He came to Stanford with
about $200 in his pockets, plus
about $600 from his late father's
insurance. Four years later, he
left Stanford with just $40 in his
pockets, but in those years he
supported himself, including
paying for room and board. No
one paid tuition then.
Even before classes began, he
got a job in a University office at
$5 a week. A few weeks later
John C. Branner, head of the
Department of Geology and
Mining, gave him a job because he
could type, bringing his income to
$30 a month.
Laundry Service
One of his enterprises was a
laundry service. On Monday
mornings he collected bundles of
soiled clothes; each Saturday
afternoon he distributed the clean
parcels. After three years he sold
the agency for $40.
Another of his noteworthy
enterprises, an agency, brought
lecturers and artists to campus
and the community. In his
Memoirs Hoover recalled an
embarrassing situation. "On one
occasion, we branched into the
large dimensions of engaging
[Ignance] Paderewski for an
appearance at the nearby town of
San Jose.
"A holiday occurred and we

did not have enough gate receipts
to pay his fee and expenses. The
three of us explained to
Paderewski's manager, who was in
no good humor about it. But the
great musician, overhearing our
discussion, intervened, and we
were forgiven the few dollars'
deficit." That "few dollars," one
source said, was $400.
Even during the summers,
when he worked on numerous
geological surveys, he saved his
salary.
Big Game
Probably his most famous
economic achievement relates to
the first Big Game, the football
contest against University of
California at Berkeley, which he
helped arrange. Stanford
challenged the soon-to-be
traditional rival team. March 19,
1892 was the set date; San
Francisco the place.
There were seats for 15,000
spectators, but only 10,000
seat-numbered tickets were
printed. But the fans did not
cooperate.
"The attendance piled up to
nearly 20,000," he wrote. "So we
set up an alley of our college boys
from the box offices to the gates
and sold tickets for cash — the
purchasers being carefully
watched so that no outsiders
crowded in.
"At that time few bills were
used in California. We dealt in
silver and gold. The cash piled up
to the extent that it spilled on the
floors; we had to rent a wash
boiler and a dishpan from nearby
householders for the price of a
free ticket."
But that turned out to be a
minor problem. When the captains
of the two teams showed up,
there was no football. "We had
overlooked that detail and had to
delay the game for a half hour
while we sent downtown for two
pigskins," Hoover wrote.
He never saw the game, which
the underdog Stanford team won,
14-10. It took Hoover and the Cal
business manager all night to
count the cash, which turned out
to be just over $30,000.
This accomplishment vaulted
him to the eyes of the student
body as a competent businessman,
and paid off two years later when
he ran for student finance
manager.
'Greeks' Vs. 'Barbs'
His student political career
actually began as a sophomore. In
the spring of 1893 two distinct
parties emerged in the races for
student body offices: the
"Greeks," those in fraternities,
and the "barbs," short for
barbarians.
Hoover recalls, "During these
young days of the University the
Greek-letter fraternities began
their colonization among the
students. The fraternities had
combined to secure all student
offices and elective honors.
"With others who lived in
dormitories and diggings [tents],
we resented the snobbery that
accompanied the fraternity
system and we suspected
favoritism in handling student
enterprises and their loose
methods of accounting for
money. We declared war for
reform."
Hoover became a worker for
the barb candidate for president,

as "an emissary to carry the
message of emancipation to the
barbarians."
Hoover's man won the
presidency, but the "Greeks" still
held the minor offices. A year
later that was changed.
Constitution
Hoover and the "Barbs" wrote
a constitution for the student
body, which included an
important new job of finance
manager, the only paid position.
Hoover did not want to run for
treasurer but reluctantly gave in
to the Barbs' urgings. He refused
to accept a salary, however. He
accumulated a plurality of votes
in the primary, with an amazing
85 percent of the students casting
ballots. One week later he
garnered 370 votes to his
opponent's 282.
In seven months as treasurer,
Hoover erased a $1200 deficit,
and put student government in
the black. He set up an accounting
system based on a geodetic survey
experience and had the accounts
published regularly in the college
paper, then called the Daily Palo
Alto.
While Hoover was succeeding
in the field of business, his
academic pursuits suffered from
the beginning.
Hoover first attempted to pass
the University's entrance
examination when Prof. Swain
visited Portland to administer the
test. Hoover failed, but Swain was
impressed by the "industrious,
thoughtful, ambitious boy earning
his own living while he studied."
Swain told Hoover to come to
Palo Alto a few weeks early, study
and retake the tests.
He passed the second time, but
his entrance was conditioned
upon taking semi-annual English
tests. The next few years failed to
clear the condition away, and it
almost barred him from
graduating with his class.
Stanford's first President David

Starr Jordan remembers that he
was passed in English "mainly
because it was claimed that the
university could hardly refuse to
graduate one who wrote such an
excellent thesis in his major
subject and who was the best
student in the department."
Lou Henry
It was also through his geology
major that he met Lou Henry, his
future wife. She entered the
freshman class during his senior
year, also as a geology student.
Hoover recalls that he had little
time to devote to coeds, but when
Miss Henry came along "I felt my
duty to aid the young lady in her
studies both in the laboratory and
in the field." They were married
in 1899.
In general, his academic life
suffered from mediocrity, mostly
due to the time he spent on
extra-curricular activities. He
notes that he flunked just one
course, German, but didn't ever
get "A" grades in any of his other
courses.
In 1895 he finally reached
graduation day; the depression of
1893 had reached the Pacific
Coast.
"I listened to the
commencement address by Dr.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's
president, with my mind mostly
on the sinking realization that a
new era was opening for me with
only $40 in cash and the need of
finding an immediate job," his
Memoirs noted.
"I had lived all my life in hard
times. But I had never heard of
depressions. No one told me that
there was one afoot. So I did not
need to worry about that. Nor did
I have to worry about what the
government was going to do about
it.
"No one, for that matter, was
crying over 'helpless youth.' It
was up to me alone to make my
way in the world beyond the
shelter of Stanford."

YOUNG GRADUATE-Hoover graduated from Stanford in 1895, as a
member of the first senior class, with an A.B in Geology. He left the
University to pursue a career in engineering and worked in mining,
railroad and metallurgical industries in the U.S. and abroad from 1895
to 1913.

HOOVER'S BRIDE—Young engineer Herbert Hoover wed Stanford
alumna Lou Henry on Feb. 10, 1899. The couple shared a love of
geology and together designed the Lou Henry Hoover house, now the
University President's mansion. Mrs. Hoover died Jan. 7, 1944 in New
York; memorial services were held in the campus' Memorial Church.
