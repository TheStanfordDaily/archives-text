# STUDENTS STAGE 'PEP' AFFAIR AT GRID SCRIMMAGE
## Local East-West Contest Stirs All to Cheers in Stand Rivalry 
### 
Now that the Stanford student body
has again expressed its confidence in
the varsity football squad, and that
secret practice is again in order, the
local football public awaits the Santa
Clara game Saturday when the Cardi
nals will have an opportunity to
avenge the defeat tney received last
year from the Brohcos.
Yesterday's rally and open practice
was the first that has been held on
the campus since the team captained
by Ernie Nevers was defeated in rJUti
by Washington. Following that rally
three years ago, Stanford came back
the following Saturday and defeated
California 27-14. The rally yesterday,
held at the invitation of Pop Warner,
is expected to have a similar effect
in the way of encouragement to the
team, a bit "low" as a result of its
second conference defeat in five years.
Following a few cheers for the
"Stanford Varsity," "Pop Warner,"
<md "Biff Hoffman," two teams lined
up for a scrimmage. Lewis, Srnalling,
Simkins, and Frentrup comprised the
backfield lineup of one team while
the opposition backfield was composed
of Rothert, Riese, Clark, and llehrig.
None of the players from the original
first team got into the affair. Frentrup
■caught a pass and made a run of
sibout fifty yards. Lewis scored the
only touchdown of the afternoon,
much to the pleasure of the grand
stand which supported the "East"
team and competed in yelling with
the "West" team's rooters.
Pete Heiser, sophomore guard, was
th« only man injured. He received an
injury to his jaw and parted with a
couple of teeth.
