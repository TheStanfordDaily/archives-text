# DOUB CAPTAIN OF YEARLING ELEVEN
## 
### 
Bill Doub, former University High
tackle and choice on the mythical
Oakland All-City team in ii) 27, was
elected captain of the Cardinal fresh
man football squad yesterday. Doub's
play at right tackle has been con
sistently good all year, his defensive
work being especially notable; and
his leadership should prove valuable
in the Little Big Game with the Cali
fornia freshmen in Berkeley next Sat
urday.
Phil Wilson, right halfback, is the
latest addition to the backfield cas
ualty list. While getting off a few
practice punts yesterday, his side was
injured, apparently some ligaments
being torn. This is the injury wliicn
kept Rudy Rintala out of the lineup
for several weeks. Dusty Allen, full
back, is still limping around with a
bad knee and may not be able to start
next Saturday.
Because of the Card injuries the
California freshmen are slight favor
ites to win Saturday. However, this
means little; for last year the Bear
Cubs invaded the Farm top-heavy fa
vorites to trounce the Stanford fresh
men and instead were themselves
trounced â€”26 to 7.
Records of the two teams this sea
son are comparatively equal, with the
exception of the U.S.C. games. The
Stanford men suffered a 12 to 0 defeat
last Saturday at the hands of the
Sonthern California freshmen who
had been held to a scoreless tie by
the California yearlings the week pre
vious. The Bear and Card perform
ances against the St. Mary's and
Santa Clara freshman teams and the
Southern All-Stars give no indication
of strength on either side, the com
parative scores being almost identical.
Coach Husky Hunt's eleven was
working smoothly yesterday and
looked as if it will be able to furnish
the California freshmen with plenty
of competition. Hunt and Bradshaw
are devoting practice sessions this
week to improving and speeding up
the line's charging on offensive plays.
