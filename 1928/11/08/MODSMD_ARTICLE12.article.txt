# G.O.P. Leader Rests After Great Victory For Republican Party
## 
### Associated Press 
Looking upon the Republican vic
tory as a vindication of great issues
and a determination of the true
read of progress, Herbert Hoover in
his first message to the American ;
people as president-elect late yester
day asked for a co-operation and unity
of spirit of all leaders of opinion and
of action for the common service of j
the country.
"I can make no adequate expression |
of gratitude for the overwhelming j
confidence of our people who without
regard to section or interest have se~
lected me for president of the whole
United States," he said.
Hoover said he did not expect to
make any public addresses any time
soon and that for the next few days
he proposed to devote himself to the
job of obtaining complete rest.
The president-elect made it his first
business of the day to reply to the
congratulatory message sent him last
night by Governor Alfred E. Smith,
the defeated Democratic candidate for \
president.
"I am in receipt of your kind tele
gram," his message to Smith read. "I j
deeply appreciate botn the spirit of it
and your good wishes for the future."
