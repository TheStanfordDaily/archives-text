ABOARD CURTIS TRAIN, DESH- j
LER, 0., Nov. 7. (/P) â€”Traveling as
ordinary passenger and with a mini- j
mum of ostentation, Vice-President-1
elect Charles Curtis tonight was well j
on his way back to Washington draw- !
ing near the finish of the tour that j
led him 21,000 miles in his victorious i
campaign.
The Senator said he had made no j
decision as to his resignation from
the Senate and those close to him felt I
that he considered it his duty as ma- j
jority leader to remain in the Senate
through the short session.
