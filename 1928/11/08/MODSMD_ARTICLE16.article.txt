# THIRTY MILLION POPULAR VOTE GIVES HOOVER 5,000,000 LEAD
## Republicans Hold Majority in Forty States; Smith Carries Six in South, Two in East; New Political Map Emerges as Result of Election 
### Associated Press 
Closing tabulations of Tuesday's election have continued to reinforce
the tremendous popular vote by which J lerbert Iloover and Charles Curtis
have amassed majorities in states having 444 electoral units and left Al
fred E. Smith and Joe T. Robinson leading in others having only 87.
The late returns have served only to emphasize the immensity of the
Republican sweep that embraced the entire west and most of the east and

■also extended into four trauitionally
Democratic states of the South —Vir-
ginia, North Carolina, Florida, and
Texas.
With less than a scattered quarter
of the nation's precincts remaining un
counted, the Hoover majorities have
polled up in 40 states. Smith held the
lead in eight others, six of them in
the South and two in the East, Massa
chusetts and Rhode Island. Only Ala
bama, Georgia, South Carolina, Missis
eippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana in
Dixie remained under the Democratic
banner.
When more than three quarters of
the popular vote had been counted to
a total exceeding 30,000,000, Hoover
was pulling away from Smith with a
margin of approximately 5,000,000. By
the same mandate with which it se
lected a Republican administration
the electorate likewise increased that
party's majorities in the two houses
of Congress and gave Republicans a
Jead in most of the 34 gubernatorial
contests.
The strangeness of the new politi
cal map painted at the polls is best
reflected in the historical contrariness
of the Republican vote in the democra
cies of Texas, Florida, North Caro
lina, and Virginia, and the turn o£
Republican Massachusetts and Rhode
Island to the Smith standard.
