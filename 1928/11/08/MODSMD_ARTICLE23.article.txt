# Smith’s Catholicism May Have Been an Incubus
## 
### 
The Presidential election witnessed the test of the Constitutional right
of a man to serve his fellow-citizens, whatever his religion, and the people
"flunked" on that test —so some political observers say.
The South rose up and smote A1 Smith, a Democrat.
There are only two reasons for Dixie's doing that: Prohibition and
evangelical Protestantism. Here was Smith generally acknowledged the
best champion Democracy has recently put forth, one of the most dramatic
figures in American history, one of the ablest campaigners, one of the
greatest executives, and a born leader of men. Yet he battered less suc
cessfully the wall of Republican prosperity than did John W. Davis, who
took Florida, Texas, Tennessee and Virginia, states which on Tuesday
went to Hoover.
On the basis of this survey of the results, it certainly appears that
Smith's Catholicism was an incubus, a grievous heavy cross. Yet when
one considers that the Democratic candidate trailed Hoover by but 5,000-
000 in a popular vote of more than 31,000,000, perhaps there is ground for
thinking that the white-sheeted spectre has disappeared. 1 lowever, the
University of Virginia does not think so, for we read that the two statues
of Jefferson which stand on the campus were beshrouded yesterday morn
ing, one bearing a card saying: "To the memory of Jeffersonian De
mocracy and religious freedom. Died November 6, 1928."
