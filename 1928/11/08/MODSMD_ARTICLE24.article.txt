# To Sniff at the Constitution or at the Cork?

### 
Many college and university heads believe that the adoption of State
liquor control would mean "grave peril" to the youth of the country, ac
cording to a census taken by the Intercollegiate Prohibition Association.
The presidents of Western Maryland College, of the University of Chat
tanooga, of Boston University, of the State University of lowa, and,
finally, President Wilbur, have asserted that there is a marked decrease
in student consumption of alcohol since the Prohibition laws have been
in effect. Some of these men believe that if a movement to establish a
dispensary system 1 somewhat similar to that in Ontario, Canada, should
succeed, the amount of drinking among students would increase.
It is to be noted that President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia
University has not been asked to express his opinion on the college atti
tude toward liquor, and on the moral effect of Prohibition. Presidents of
other large colleges like Columbia have been neglected in the obtaining of
this consensus. President Butler, for example, would ha\e told the In
tercollegiate Prohibition Association that the Ontario 1 lan, like the Scan
dinavian system of Government dispensation of intoxicants, is very much
more a successful promoter of temperance than Amendment XV 111. He
would say that there is immorality in inserting in the Constitution an
amendment considered unconstitutional by him and b) other wise men,
unconstitutional in being contrary to the spirit of the document; opposed
to the valid principle of State's rights.
A great deal is to be said, O Intercollegiate Prohibition Association,
in favor of bringing up your students to have a respect for constitutional
government. There are many wise citizens who believe with Dr. Butler
that it is perhaps even more dangerous to foster sniffing at the Constitu
tion than to allow sniffing at the cork.
