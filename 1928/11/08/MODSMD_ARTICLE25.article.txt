The Editor, Sir:
In view of Hoover's unprecedented
majority yesterday, what can we
handful of Smith supporters say?
Two things: Hoover won and Smith
lost —that is, Hoover won on person
alities, and Smith lost on the issues.
Let us first consider how Hoover
won. Smith's was a romantic career.
From the sidewalks of Eastside New
York, he rose to his present position.
From a tool of Tammany, which to
its East Side members at least, was
the "Robin Hood" of the streets of
New York, through the influence of
certain turning points in his life, and
especially owing to the influence of a
Russian Jewess, Mrs. Moskowitz, he
became an honest, fair, state, and
nation-wide politician, who made the
Democratic party over to suit himself.
Hoover, on the other hand, appeals
to our common sense. He was a
Quaker farm boy who made a fortune,
or several of them, as a free lance
engineer over the world. When the
war broke out, he took the job of
getting stranded American tourists
back home, he took over food relief
administration in Belgium, food ad
ministration in the United States, and
as Secretary of Commerce, he took
over Mississippi flood relief, etc.
This is a career of sheer achieve
ment in lines where there is no doubt
as to the necessities and purposes of
liis jobs. In spite of his administra
tive genius, however, he is a very
ordinary man. When he appears in
public, he is not like Smith —perfectly
at home, smiling and happy, but he
looks like any of us would feel if we
were in his place. Hoover, as 1 said,
appeals to our common sense, and we
usually carry common sense and, not
imagination with us to the polls. Add
to this Smith's disfavor with the
"good" people of the nation on ac
count of the bogy of Tammany, wet,
and Eaßt Side New York; and his
disfavor among the masses on ac
count of his Catholicism, and we can
see why Hoover won.
Now, why did Smith lose? Unpreju
diced minds all over the country must
admit that not since the Civil War
has the Democratic party come out
so strongly for militant progressivism,
as it theoretically should always do.
As Jackson broke away from the philo
sophical, "laissez faire" of Jefferson
to form the democratic Democracy of
the restless West, so Smith broke
nway from the dilly-dally, straddle-the

fence, ape-the-Republieans of post
Civil War Democracy. But Smith lost,
and in losing he proved two things.
First, that there is no place in pros
perous America for a militant pro
gressive party; that we must divide
our "Conservative" party, for the sake
of two-party government into two
parties, the ins and the outs, the Re
publicans and the Democrats. We
must leave progressivism to spas
modic outbreaks wherever the discon
tent is greatest. And second, which is
leally a corollary of the first,
the fence-straddling, Republican-aping,
practical politicians know more about
what is good for the Democratic party
than the arm-chair politicians of the
Political Science departments of the
universities.
—J. N. Andrews.
P.S.: Since much change is useless
when everything is going so well, and
since such a majority cannot be
wrong, I am now convinced that it is
best that Stanford's most illustrious
son should be our next President.
The Editor, Sir:
I congratulate Mr. Combellack on
his timely defense of a martyr Phi
Bete in last Wednesday's Daily. It is
refreshing and unusual to know that
such are truly human or, at least, may
be. But I see no good reason why
anyone who has made the record that
the friend in question had should
need defense. Are we a pack of un
tutored yeggs that we should not ap
preciate real scholarship, whether or
not it be accompanied with a circle
"S"? The Phi Bete has achieved his
end, surely a worthy enough one, in
the same way that Hoffman achieved
his football fame .... by a lot of
time plus a good heap of native
ability. Why not give them the credit,
instead of the facile sneer?
Yours truly, Fair Play.
