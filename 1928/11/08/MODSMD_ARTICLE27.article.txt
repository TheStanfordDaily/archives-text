# DOUG AND MARY REVEAL PRODUCTIONS
## King and Queen of Movies, Fairbanks and Pickford, Discuss Picture Plans in Studio Interview 
### BEN MADDOX 
Tea with Douglas Fairbanks and
Mary Pickford the afternoon before
"the late unpleasantness" was cer
tainly a red-letter event for me.
Having read that they entertained
the cream of European notables, the
king of England's son, George, being
their guest last month, and that they
themselves were luncheon guests of
President Coolidge several weeks ago,
it was the shock of my life when I
was treated in such a friendly manner
by the "king and queen of the
movies."
In person, Doug and Mary are as
magnetic and as attractive as they
are on the screen. I spent the after
noon before the game at their Holly
wood studio, and both of them gave
me first-hand information on their
forthcoming pictures. These two stars
produce but one film a year, so any
news of their activities is of great
interest to theatregoers.
Adventure incarnate on the screen,
Doug is friendliness itself in person.
He was filming a French royal court
scene on one of the big stages of the
United Artists studio, and when he
learned that I wanted an interview
for the Stanford paper he installed
me in a chair right on the "front line
of action."
His new picture is "The Iron Mask,"
and will be ready for release by Janu
ary. "This is the sequel to 'The Three
Musketeers,' continuing their adven
tures ten years after that story
ended," he explained to me.
Doug is a unique pioneer in the
field of movie entertainment. The
father of a twenty-two-year-old son,
he scales castle walls, fights off whole
armies, and swaggers through impos
sible and death-defying situations to
the delight of millions. He has a fine
gymnasium within the studio walls,
and it is undoubtedly his enthusiasm
for athletics that keeps him ever
youthful. Perpetual motion —that's the
secret of his success! He has a lot of
former college athletes working for
him, and he competes with the best
of them.
Dressed in a picturesque French

I costume, Doug looked capable of all
kinds of thrilling deeds. He is the
j vital spark which keeps everyone on
j his set in good humor. His essential
I democracy shows in the real interest
| he takes in everyone around him. No
\ high-hat about Doug—if you are his
guest you are treated with every
courtesy.
He had more than a hundred extras
garbed in the beautiful costumes of
the Bourbon nobility on the set. And
there were more than a hundred peo
ple behind the cameras —electricians,
property men, cameramen, and visi
tors. Three Stanford varsity football
men were sitting in the front row
chairs for awhile.
Doug told me the story of "The Iron
Mask" and explained the scenes they
were taking that afternoon, jumping
up every now and then to work before
the camera. It was a thrill to be sit
ting just a few feet away from where
the principals were acting, and to
hear about the production from the
"head man."
"I've been preparing for this picture
for a year," he said. "That man over
there was brought over especially to
supervise the details —he is the great
est living authority on this period in
French history. Yes, there will be
talking—but not in the usual way.
The three characters who motivate
the plot will each address the audi
ence directly; there will be no talking
between the actors.
"This picture will compare with
'Robin Hood'; it is being made in as
lavish a manner as that was. And
Jots of outdoor action. We have a real
plot, too."
Doug is so dynamic that the listener
can't help but enthuse with him. "I'm
going to make everyone work tonight
so we can go to the Stanford game
tomorrow. Can't miss that!" He was
heartily interested in the football
situation that had Los Angeles topsy
i turvy.
, While we were talking—along came
! Mary Pickford. Tea was served and
! Mary told me about the picture she
; will start the latter part of this month,
j But that is material for another story.
