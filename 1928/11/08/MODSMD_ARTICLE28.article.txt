This column, once a solid Roman
one, has been badly shattered by the
will of the people. At about 10 o'clock
Tuesday night this column began to
: show deteriorating Byzantine influ
ences, and before long several rifts,
or wise cracks, began to appear. We
unbuckled our sword and gave it to
General Grant, while Sousa's band
played "one of Stanford's famous
fighting songs."
One of our last friends suggested
the Solid South referred to eraniums,
rather than States.
Senator Hefllin has telegraphed us
that he understands the Pope was at
the back door of the White House
that night and was awful griped when
the doorman wanted to know who he
was. Later he left, discouraged at the
returns.
Mr. Hoover's new Prosperity slogan
made "The Full Dinner" pale.
Al Smith, of course, swept "The
Sidewalks of New York."
Oklahoma's rebuke was as Curtis it
could be.
We voters want Prosperity!
Now laugh that off, Posterity!
We want to eat
And shoe our feet
And see a man named Flaherty.
The last line doesn't make sense,
but neither did the slogan.
"At least, Hoover's cabinet won't
have swinging doors!" we seem to
hear Sir Thomas Heflin shout.
Incidentally, his ardent constituents
in Alabama presented benator Heflin
with a basket of eggs thfe other night
—one right after the other.
