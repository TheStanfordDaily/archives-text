# DIFFERENT AND HOW
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover and Alfred Emanuel
Smith are tlie same men today they
were Tuesday, but what a difference!
One headquarters continues active
and enthusiastic. The other is already
taking on a tomb-like atmosphere.
Nothing succeeds like success in
politics and nothing fails like failure.
A two-party system leaves us no
time to mourn over the other half.
Four years hence we shall repeat
the performance, with our organiza
tion under full steam, with voices
ringing in our ears over 10,000,000 re
ceiving sets, with campaign managers
clamoring for funds and trying to pep
up the boys with their wild forecasts.
Four years hence we will make an
other beaten candidate to salve his
hurt in solitude.
Such is democracy.â€”S. F. News.
