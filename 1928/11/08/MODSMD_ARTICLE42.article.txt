Several years from now, as an old
grad gathers his grandchildren around
him, he will take a ballot-stamp out
ot his strong box, look at it with ad
miration, and say: "Times aren't what
they used to be. Now they use voting
machines at elections, but in the good
old days they used the simple, un
assuming rubber stamp to mark their
ballots. This, my children—look out!
handle it with care! —is the famous
rubber stamp with which Herbert
Hoover marked his ballot in 1928!"
For yesterday morning at the polls
in the Women's Clubhouse, immedi
ately after Hoover had left his booth,
Mr. "A Certain Student" rushed into
the booth, grabbed the rubber ballot
stamp which Hoover had used, and
ran into the great outdoors, where he
lied to parts unknown before he could
be apprehended. Up to an early hour
this morning, irate souvenir hunters,
who felt that they had been gyped,
were still searching the campus for
the thief.
The campus election officials re
gretted that they were not seniors,
for then they could have risen en
masse and called: "Someone has
cheated in this University!" Then, if
the criminal had not returned the
loot, proper steps could have been
taken toward his punishment. As it
was, the booth for the rest of the
day had to limp along with one stamp
less.
