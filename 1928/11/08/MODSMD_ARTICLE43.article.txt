# WORK ON 1929 QUAD IS PROGRESSING WELL
## 
### 
Work on the 1925-29 Quad is pro
gressing smoothly and thus far no
serious hitches have developed, ac
cording to Editor Lawrence Beemer.
The Quad, during the past month, has
taken approximately 1400 individual
photographs and the 500 which still
remain to be taken will not be done
until Winter Quarter. The year sec
tion of this year's Quad will be em
phasized and several more full-page
layouts than before will be added.
Color plates have been done and are
now being processed. The artist has
been selected and is proceeding with
his work. There will be 450 pages,
including advertisements, about the
same as last year.
