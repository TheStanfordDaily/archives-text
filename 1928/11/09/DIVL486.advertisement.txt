4 Aerial view of the tip of Manhattan Island, New York City
THE SKY IS THE LIMIT!
BEFORE the elevator removed this limitation,
five stories was the height limit of buildings.
Upper floors were undesirable—people didn't
enjoy the long, hard climb to roof-tree quarters.
Today there is no restriction. Upper floors are pre
ferred for their light, ventilation and splendid view.
Elevators have made buildings of any height prac
ticable. The only limit is in the construction of the
building itself.
For more than 75 years Otis has led the way in Ver
tical Transportation—changing the skylines of the
nation.
