THE "MALL"
Here's a suit for every university man—conserva
tive enough to be dignified, and yet with a dash
that typifies the well-dressed collegian—a happy
medium.
The new hard fabrics of smart design and color
are the fashion's latest trend. We have them!
Scotch and English Tweeds, Sharkskins, Oxford
Blues, Rich Browns, Oxford Cheviots—everyone
a triumph in materials.
Your suit may be taken from stock or tailored to
your measure —priced from forty to sixty dollars.
Drop in and look them over. We know you'll be
enthusiastic!
