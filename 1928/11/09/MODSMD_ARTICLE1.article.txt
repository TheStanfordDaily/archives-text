# CARD-CALIFORNIA FROSH CLASH IN LITILE BIG GAME
## Bear Cubs Favored to Win Tomorrows Tilt; Hunt To Start Wilson 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
Once again with odds against it, a
fighting Cardinal freshman eleven will
meet the California yearlings in the
annual Little Big Game. The battle
will take place in the Memorial Sta
dium at Berkeley tomorrow afternoon
nt 2:30 o'clock, being the principal
football engagement in the East Bay
district this week-end.
The Stanford casualty list remained
the same yesterday with one more
name being added and one taken off.
Lewis Arnold, reserve halfback, is in
the Palo Alto Hospital as the result
of a sprained ankle received in prac
tice Wednesday. Phil Wilson, right
halfback and punting ace of the fresh
man squad, who strained his side
Wednesday, was taking things easy
yesterday but should be in condition
to start tomorrow's game. Dusty Al
len, regular fullback, was in a suit
yesterday; but there is little proba
bility of his being able to play against
•California.
Last Game of Season
This will be the final game on the
.schedule of both freshman teams, and
.a repetition of the 1927 victory will
leave the Stanford record marred by
but one defeat, administered by the
IJ.S.C. freshmen, and a tie. If the
Bear Cubs win this game, they will
have completed the season without a
defeat and with one tie, this with the
Southern California freshmen.
Against the heavy Berkeley team
Hunt will start a strong line and a
.speedy backfield. Captain Bill Doub
and George Grey, tackles, are the
mainstays of the line; and it will be
up to them, largely, to break up the
California attack. Don Colvin and
Carol Toll will again be in the wing
positions, with Ebey and Hunt play
ing in the guard berths, and Milligan
at center.
Rintala To See Action
Rudy Rintala, left halfback, is per
fectly fit now, and California fans will
get a glimpse, or rather many
glimpses, of what a varsity possibility
looks like. Rintala had the U.S.C.
freshmen mystified several times
when he was given the ball and on
four occasions broke away for long
runs. Phil Wilson, a consistent ball
carrier and fine punter, will start in
the other halfback position. Bill Marks
will call signals, and Cadell will begin
the game at fullback.
Coach Brick Mitchell's big back
field threat is Rusty Gill, husky full
back. Against the Southern California
freshmen he was the chief ground
water for the California frosh. Mit
chell's team is said to lack power on
the offense, but to possess a defense
(hat can be penetrated only with dif
ficulty. In fact this defense has been
so strong that the California goal line
has not been crossed all year.
Greys to Play
The Stanford Greys will meet the
California Goofs in a game preceding
the freshman tilt, and beginning at
J2:15 o'clock.

Ebey LGR Fena
