# DAILY-CHAPPIE GRIDSTERS EAT RAW MEAT AS TILT LOOMS TOMORROW
## "Old Boy" Combines Speed, Deception, Pathos, in Attack; Card-Bronco Game Is Added Attraction 
### 
The day of the Big Game draws nigh
and many a heart is fluttering on the
eve of the terrific shambles. Both teams
are training on raw meat, smothered in
imported mustard.
The "Old Boy" presents an attack of
combined speed, power, deception, pathos,
human interest, and sex appeal, hereto
fore not found outside of the famous
"Calford" games. Against the Chappie
horde will be an aggregation of murder
ous, smashing linemen and tricky, clash
ing backs wearing the colors of the j
"Daily." These behemoths neither eat,'
sleep, walk, nor talk for a week before
their important games, but on the day of ;
the game, folks! My, my!
Players Are Giants
The Chappie line, from tackle to tackle j
are great, big, strong, two-fisted, flat- j
footed giants, tough as Bush street and
twice as dirty. The ends, Link Malm
quist and Bob Philippi, present the great- i
est brand of flanking since the days of
Muller, Slipkey, and Walker.

The backfield, working in the famous
"xxx" formation, is fast as lightning,
and never strikes twice in the same place.
The new combination for this year pre
sents three quarterbacks, Hal Conroy,
Van King, and Fred Hubler, all triple
threat men.
Norman Plays Hunch-back
The other back is "Weinie" Norman,
who fills in at the hunch-back position;
and is a quadruple threat man, being
liable to dash off a Campus Opinion on
the typewriter while skirting the ends,
as well as faint, fumble, or fall at any
moment. All the boys arc clever at this
skirting business.
Up to date, the Daily has been work
ing in complete secrecy, so little is known
of their plans. However, it shouldn't be
long now, so watch the sport page.
This game is scheduled *It> take place
in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
There will he a preliminary game by the
Stanford and Santa Clara varsities as,
an added attraction.
