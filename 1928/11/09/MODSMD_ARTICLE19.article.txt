# A 						Chance to Assure Campus Garages
## 
### 
How many thousands of dollars go to waste (one might almost say
criminally) on account of the exposure to weather of students' automo
biles? Each passing season takes a heavy toll, because in a majority of
cases owners of campus cars let their expensive equipages stand in front
of their houses or halls while dew, rain, fog and sun corrupt. Deprecia
tion is terribly heavy, even in the mild California climate (advt.), and it
is no uncommon thing to sec in the spring a seamy, weathered "hack"
where in the fall one saw a dashing, new "job."
Comptroller Roth has for some time been aware of the great need for
garages here, but two years ago he was temporarily thwarted when little
response followed a questionnaire sent out to attract promises to use a
large, central garage which the University proposed to build. Since that
time, the demand for garages has become more sharp, and once again Mr.
Roth is anxious to co-operate with car-owners in order to solve their
problem of shelter.
The Comptroller plans to get a consensus as to whether one large,
centrally-located garage is the choice of the students, or whether three or
four, placed at'convenient points 011 the campus, would serve better. More
over, before the University embarks upon a garage-building campaign,
support must be got in the form of promises to pay $5 per month rent.
The Daily thinks this proposal of the University will meet with a good
response from student automobile-owners. The plan for building three or
four garages is the better, we think. The Comptroller says, though, that
it would be difficult to consider building a garage in the vicinity of the
men's dormitories, because most of that area has be.en set aside, under
present architectural plans, for more dormitories. Yet since propinquity
to the living group is the first'consideration which will make the garages
popular with the students, might it not be wise to amend the architect's
plans to allow for sufficient garages to house automobiles belonging to hall
men? It is understood that the problem of location elsewhere 011 the
campus is easy of solution, so that there remains now simply the need for
automobile owners showing interest in Air. Roth's proposition.
