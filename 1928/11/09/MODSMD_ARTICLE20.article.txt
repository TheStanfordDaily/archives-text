# Ten Years Pass
## 
### 
Ten years ago on Monday the curtained armistice dropped over the
eyes of the world, shutting from view the climactic act which closed the
most dramatic action play in all history. While the world as audience sat
tense awaiting the rise of the curtain once again and the actors in the wings
cursed their lot, the director came to the conclusion that the show had
gone far enough.
For ten years that curtain has been the symbol of pcace.
For ten years its memory has been honored by the world and by the
American citizenry in particular.
Observance of Armistice Day, unlike that of Decoration Day, was
never intended as an honor to fallen dead or acknowledgment of heroic
dead. It has been rather the renewal of pledges in support of peace—an
entrenchment against the continuation of the play.
The director, content with his lot, muses upon the instability of human
emotion which dictates his every move, lie is human emotion—with its
loves, hates, revulsions.
Once each twelve months we gather to write anew onr contracts for
.•ear of peace and to subscribe to new obligations in international good
1.
Armistice Day as a celebration, like the Fourth of July, has passed into
an inactive phase. But as the symbol of peace it remains enshrined and
unshaken—a day of thanksgiving for the past and a pledge of faith to the
future.
