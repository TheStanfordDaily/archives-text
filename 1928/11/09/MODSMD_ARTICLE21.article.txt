# Midquarters Hard Because 100 Unorganized
## 
### 
The exceptional bustle of midquarters has passed us by like a gust of
November wind. Now we can return to our football, cinching our belts
meanwhile in anticipation of Thanksgiving Day and the holiday season.)
Midquarters are always something of a mess, because they are so chrono-1
logically unorganized. One never knows when one's midquarters will j
come, but usually he finds they come in a huddle. Finals are different;!
gonitis organizes them, and there is a specific time for quizzes in even the!
most inconsequential and obscure courses.
In order to obviate the examination "bogey," students, in preparing
their quarterly schedules, should take as few big lecture courses as pos
sible, and as many small courses as possible, wherein daily work and reci- j
tations help cut down the fearful grading-weight of the midquarterly and |
final examinations. Courses in the languages, for example, require that
methodical sort of work, done day by day, which adds to knowledge by
slow accretion rather than by the python-process of swallowing chapters
and books whole, against the day of the midquarter.
"With a man lilcc Jones for a teacher, the students of Southern Cali
fornia cannot help but be excellent sportsmen and exponents of fair play,"
said Philip Cavalero at U.S.C.'s good-will rally last Friday. A noble'
sentiment, upon which we compliment Mr. Cavalero. Its truth, moreover,
is borne out by the actions of the Trojan rooting section—one of the
politest sections which Stanford has the pleasure of sitting opposite.
