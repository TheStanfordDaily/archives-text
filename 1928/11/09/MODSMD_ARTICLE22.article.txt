# The 						Bullsession
## 
### 
A short time ago the membership of
the National Economic League, highly
representative of the nation's serious
minded people, cast their votes as to the
relative importance of the leading issues
which confront this country. "Adminis
tration of Justice," Lawlessness" and
"Prohibition" polled highest; and then,
at the end of a list of fifty issues of
which "Ethical, Moral, Religious Train
ing" and "Old Age Pensions" arc ex
amples, came, last and rated least im
portant, "Population."
Therein those serious-minded men per
haps demonstrated that they are more
serious-minded than far-sighted. Popu
lation is not an obvious problem ; but it
is none the less of vital importance. Sci
ence has/brought the telephone and the
radio to abolish time. It has swept away
distance with the aeroplane, the automo
bile and other means of swift transpor
tation. It is 110 longer necessary for men
to live huddled together like sheep.
Yet people seem determined to trample
upon one another's feet, suffering the odd
delusion that this is progress. Los An
geles, for example, has set a goal: "A
Million and a Half by 1930." Attain
ment of that goal will mean only con
gestion, unemployment, the decrease of

general earnings and prosperity, and
handsome profits for a few real estate
operators who will thereby be enabled to
leave Los Angeles for some other place
where life is less turmoil.
In this scientific age, 150,000,000 is a
sufficient population for a country of this
size. A huge, queer-looking machine now
digs as much ditch as fifty sweating Slavs.
Those fifty Slavs, jobless, will beget two
hundred of their kind, unneeded by a new
generation. Millions of women are now
working. The earning population of the
United States is already too large with
out the aid of that indiscriminate bird,
the stork.
Had those serious-minded men consid
ered more fully, they would have realized
that such a problem as "Lawlessness" is
in many instances traceable to a greater,
basic problem : over-population.
Limitation of population is an issue of
vital importance. It has to do with mak
ing life better, freer, more liveable. Peo
ple wish life to be so. Yet, paradoxically,
they call for increased population.
Why should that superior animal who
has succeeded in conquering earth, sky
and ether, who has humbled time and
space, wish still to live in the. manner of
sheep ?
