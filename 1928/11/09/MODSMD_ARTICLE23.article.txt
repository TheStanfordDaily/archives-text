The House at Pooh Corner. By A. A.
Milne. (New York: E. P. Dutton
& Co.)
More lovable stories of Christopher
Robin, Winnie-the-Pooh who is a "bear
of very little brains," and their animal
friends, arc in The House at Pooh Cor
ner, A. A. Milne's sequel to Winnie-the-
Pooh. They are perhaps not quite so de- j
lightful as the first Pooh stories but !
there is enough Pooh originality and new
absurdities to have sent the book through
/thirty-seven printings during September.
A new friend appears among Christo
pher Robin's followers in The House at
Pooh Corner. He is boastful Tigger, .
gorgeously striped in E. H. Shepard's j
clever illustrations, and an animal who
loves to "bounce" people—that is to jump
behind them with a frightening tiger
growl (a "grrrr--oppp—ptschschschz").
However, Tigger never really hurts
people, though lie does cause terrified
Eeyore, the donkey, to tumble in the
river one day and go for a long wet ride
011 his back with four legs stuck up in
the air. How Christopher Robin and the
rest rescue him is one of the most ex- I

citing stories of the group.
Tiny Piglet is back again, as appealing
as before. Pooh sits on him a dangerous
number of times. The incident of the
Heffalump trap is clever. Stupid Pooh
has fallen in and he sits on the bottom
! wondering why he can say things he is
I not thinking, until he discovers that it
is Piglet, who is under him, doing the
talking.
Milne calls his Introduction a Contra
diction because Christopher Robin and
I his friends are saying good-bye, instead
of being introduced, and the Owl has
told Pooh that the proper opposite of
introduction is Contradiction. From the
i last story in the book we guess the rea-
I son for this good-bye. Christopher Robin
is going off to school.
But we hope that his farewell is not
permanent. Milne's charming style, with
its delicatc satire and lyricism, the sweet
ness of Christopher Robin and the hu
manity of his blundering, likeable animal
friends have made''these books far more
; than just charming children's stories. In
| deed, they are likely to please better the
more mature reader who is able to ap-
I preciate their subtleties.—J. F.
