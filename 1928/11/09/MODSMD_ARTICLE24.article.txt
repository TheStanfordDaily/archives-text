â€¢ November Bth.
Spent the better part of this morning
cleaning and straightening my room, for
the benefit of the visiting delegate of the
'California Scholastic Press Association
who is going to have my quarters tomor
row night, although I do not yet know
whereabouts I will be spending the night
myself. And did find it a relaxing pas
time, for Lord, with three rallies and a
.conference party, not to mention having
a flood of tourists about the campus who
>all seem to single me out to point the
way to "Mr. Hoover's house, please," this
week has been much of a hubbub.

Did enjoy the party Wednesday night
! muchly, for it is the first time before
; midnight I have seen more than three
! women together since registration day.
! A grievous mistake coming home, how
| ever, spoiled some of my pleasure, for six
jjbf us did wave gaily to another earful
girls in costume, only to find that the
group was of monks relaxing from tlic
devil in the assembly hall, not to mention
the cheese.

So did set my hair carefully in water
waves tonight, for all tryoutces arc iu
! vited to the dance for the delegates to
morrow, and do hear that some of the
visitors are most enchanting, and am
looking forward to seeing someone who
iis of a lower class than I. For gracious,
| what with transfers, graduate students,
and holdovers, am sometimes forced to
think I am the only real freshman on the
campus.
Shall go, however, first to the new play,
"The Devil and the Cheese," for a fine
young beau whom I have noticed of times
in my biology lab did ask me, and I am
most curious to see the cxpressionistic
j sets in the play.

I find myself most heartily wishful that I
there was a University regulation that all
professors should apply to Ex. Commit- j
1 lee for examination dates, for so far in j
my campus carecr I have been surprised J
lo find that no arrangement seems to be
made about whether one's quizzes con- j
llict with one's social engagements or not. .
And I am sure that such contacts are j
practical research works in psychology
quite as important as studying recapitu
lation.
