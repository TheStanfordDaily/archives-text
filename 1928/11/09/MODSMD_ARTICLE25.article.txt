# Stanford's Defeat Won't Aid California's Chances
## 
### 
(From DAILY CALIFORNIAN)
! Stanford's disheartening beating by
Southern California's opportunists will
make the Big Game just so much harder
for the Bears. The Cardinals will be in
a nasty mood by November 23, aided by
Pop Warner's whiplash voice and abetted
by the disapproval of the Stanford stu
dent body, most of whom left Los An
geles quite broke.
Ovcrconfidence is a fault common with
most of us, but it must be care fully
guarded against in this case if all is to
be fairly serene on the campus. Nibs
Price will see to it that his team has no
delusions of grandeur because it held the
Trojans to no score while Stanford
could not.
It's on the campus and among the
alumni that these delusions must be crush
ed as rapidly as they rise. California's
chances for a Pig Game victory haven't
been increased one whit by Stanford's
defeat—they have been lessened if any
thing. The Cardinals won't be fumbling
around when November 23 comes around.
If any breaks come California's way,
they'll have to be made by the Bears.
The "B" in "B" formation will not
mean "boloney," as one over jubilant writ
er said. It will stand for "Beating" un
less the Bears play a better all-around
game than they have so far. California
won't be able to do a "U.S.C." and win,
because Stanford will not be pulling
errors.
