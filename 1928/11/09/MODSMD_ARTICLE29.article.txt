Northerners have spent the better
:>art of the week playing against a
<uper-varsity trained in the ways of
he Golden Bear.
Both the Huskies and the South
erners are to take a light workout in
he stadium Friday afternoon. This is
he only practice scheduled for Cali
ornia here.
The Washington line was almost as
insettled as it has been since the
University of Oregon started the
lusky on his down-hill path. Coach
*'noch Bradshaw expected to send a
itronger team against California than
he one that fell before Oregon and
3regon State, but his followers had
ittle faith in Washington's ability to
lold the Golden Bear.
