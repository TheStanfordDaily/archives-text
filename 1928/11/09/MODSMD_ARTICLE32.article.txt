El Toro and Sigma Nu were vic
torious in yesterday's intramural
touch football play, defeating Sequoia
II and Sequoia I respectively. Delta
Tau Delta battled to a scoreless tie
with Kappa Sigma, and the Theta Xi-
Alpha Sigma Phi game also resulted
in a tie, the score in this contest
being 6 to 6.
Vard Loomis was the star of the
E! Toro team, throwing practically all
of their passes, two of which were
completed for touchdowns. Both at
tempts at converting failed, the final
score being 12 to 0. Leslie Garner
and Robert Krause made the El Toro
touchdowns.
Hall Team Strong
In the Sequoia I-Sigma Nu contest,
the hall team was threatening their
opponents' goal most of the time, but
failed to put the ball across due to
the fraternity men's strong defense.
Kim Dyer made a rather doubtful
touchdown for Sigma Nu when he
snatched a pass from the waiting
hands of a group of Sequoia players
and ran across the goal, although he
appeared to have been touched sev
eral times.
Beta Theta Pi and Alpha Delta Phi
played a 0 to 0 tie game Wednesday.
The contest was originally scheduled
for last Tuesday but was moved ahead
one day at the request of both teams.
