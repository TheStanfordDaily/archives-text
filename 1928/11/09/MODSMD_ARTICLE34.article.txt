# CHINA'S GREATEST NEED IS FREEDOM
## Dr. Johnson Sees Success of Nationalists' Government If Outside Countries Do Not Interfere 
### 
"If China is left free of outside inter
ference in working out her present pro
gram of government, she will succeed,"
was the belief expressed by Professor O.
B. Johnson in an interview yesterday.
Professor Johnson, who for 15 years was
actively interested in American education
of the Chinese in their nativeland, is at
present instructor in Chinese language
and civilization here.
"Chinse government is not yet defi
nitely settled," he added, "but it looks like
a step toward something permanent. At
the present time the government is mark
ed by definite hope and good leadership,
so it appears as though foreign countries
would have to give up many of the rights
which they have forced on China in the
past."
Sun Yat-sen Praised
According to Professor Johnson, most
people did not realize the likelihood of
a complete change in Chinese government
when the present revolt began a little
over two years ago. Stirring memories
of the sacrifices made by the great pa
triot Sun Yat-sen had much to do with
causing the revolt. Among his follow

ers was Chiang Kai-shek, recently elected
president of Giina. It was under his
leadership that the great drive to make
China a nationalist state began in the
spring of 1926.
The troops started their march due
north toward Peking, and after weeks of
slow progress finally arrived early last
spring.
Speakers Save Army
Strategy of the Southern leaders saved
the army from many difficult situations.
Speakers went ahead to the towns toward
which the army was moving, and talked
on the advantages of a unified China.
Usually by the time the Nationalist army
reached the town there was little opposi
tion.
Southern forces were characterized by
their intense feeling of patriotism and
anti-imperialism, which had been increas
ed by the foreign education of many of
the leaders. In an effort to throw aside
all the reactionary influences of the army
of the north, and to increase centraliza
tion, the "New Government" has changed
the name of the capital city from Peking,
meaning "northern capital," to Pei-ping
meaning "northern peace."
