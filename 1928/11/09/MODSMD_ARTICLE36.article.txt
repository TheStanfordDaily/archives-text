### 
NEW YORK, November 9 (fP). â€”If
Big Bill Tilden wants to play amateur
tennis now he will have to go a long way
to do it. He must go to Russia, China,
Brazil, Bolivia, Andorra, Lithuania, Abys
sinia, or Liberia, if the International
Lawn Tennis Federation, which embraces
34 nations, abides by the action of the
United States Lawn Tennis Association
in barring him.
