# Cushing Comedy To Be Given On Campus Tonight
## Thompson, Watt Head Cast For Annual Sword and Sandals Production 
### 
Stanford playgoers will witness the
second play of the season tonight
when Tom Cushing's romantic fan
tasy, "The Devil In the Cheese," is
presented by Sword and Sandals in
the Assembly Hall at 8:15 o'clock. A
large and experienced cast of stu
dents well-known in campus dra
matics, beautiful sets by Harold Hel
venston which represent the fantastic
spirit of the play, the sympathetic di
rection of Gordon Davis, and a de
lightful charm and piquancy about the
comedy itself are the features that
promise an interesting and entertain
ing evening tonight.
Tom Watt and Helen Thompson,
who play the two leading roles
of Jimmie Chard and Goldina showed
up very well yesterday in dress re
hearsal. Watt gives a spontaneity to
his role which is balanced by Miss
Thompson's youthful exuberance.
John Atwill and Louise Buxton as
Mr. and Mrs. Quigley play their roles
with understanding. Father Fetros,
the leader of the monks, is played by
George Shibley.
Sets Unusual
The play has many unusual features
which will go to make it popular on
the campus. The windlass which
hauls the Quigley family up to the
Monastery of Meteora has been con
structed right on the stage. The
Americans arrive on one of the high
est and most desolate mountain tops
in Greece in a wobbly rope basket
right before the audience.
The scenes which go on in Goldina's
mind are remarkable in themselves,
but the third scene of the second act
is made doubly amusing by the pres
ence of some of the characters as
Goldina visualizes them in 1938. It is
rather a revelation to Mr. Quigley.
