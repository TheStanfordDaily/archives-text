# Cushing Comedy To Be Given On Campus Tonight
## Thompson, Watt Head Cast For Annual Sword and Sandals Production 
### 
Stanford playgoers will witness the
second play of the season tonight
when Tom Cushing's romantic fan
tasy, "The Devil In the Cheese," is
presented by Sword and Sandals in
the Assembly Hall at 8:15 o'clock. A
large and experienced cast of stu
dents well-known in campus dra
matics, beautiful sets by Harold Hel
venston which represent the fantastic
spirit of the play, the sympathetic di
rection of Gordon Davis, and a de
lightful charm and piquancy about the
comedy itself are the features that
promise an interesting and entertain
ing evening tonight.
Tom Watt and Helen Thompson,
who play the two leading roles
of Jimmie Chard and Goldina showed
up very well yesterday in dress re
hearsal. Watt gives a spontaneity to
his role which is balanced by Miss
Thompson's youthful exuberance.
John Atwill and Louise Buxton as
Mr. and Mrs. Quigley play their roles
with understanding. Father Fetros,
the leader of the monks, is played by
George Shibley.
Sets Unusual
The play has many unusual features
which will go to make it popular on
the campus. The windlass which
hauls the Quigley family up to the
Monastery of Meteora has been con
structed right on the stage. The
Americans arrive on one of the high
est and most desolate mountain tops
in Greece in a wobbly rope basket
right before the audience.
The scenes which go on in Goldina's
mind are remarkable in themselves,
but the third scene of the second act
is made doubly amusing by the pres
ence of some of the characters as
Goldina visualizes them in 1938. It is
rather a revelation to Mr. Quigley.
The melodrama of the third act
finishes the play in a burst of wild
glory. There is rarely a play written
which embodies so many unusual and
seemingly incongrous features. From
the twelfth century atmosphere where
the old monastery creeps up out of
the rocks, through the inner psycho
logical secrets of a young girl's mind,
to the whirring of airplanes, and the
threatening of bandits in this modern
day, "The Devil in the Cheese" pro
gresses.
The "Devil" in the cheese Is played
by Paul Speegle, and he has power to
perform magic by his wand. Speegle
adds the magic element to the play
and furthers the cause of Goldina and
Jimmie by teaching Quigley about
youth.
Cast of Forty-Five
A cast of forty-five will be seen in
the performance tonight. Besides the
principals already mentioned, there is
Chubbock, the family butler, played
by Hal Conroy, Pointell Jones played
by A1 Leonhardt, and Arthur Hurt
and George Mauser who play the
roles of Quigley and Jones in the
1938 sequence.
The minor parts, such as monks,
will be taken by Wayland Capwell,
Leo Kibby, Charlie West, Glenn Rusk,
Robin Kinkead, and George Camp.
Calvin Wells will be a gorilla, and
Milton Hand the cannibal chieftain.
The cannibals will be played by E. D.
Mendenhall and Jack Nutt.
Bon Maddox, George Feliz, McCau
ley Small, Henry Kleinbach, and Gay
lord Fryer are to be shepherds. The
politicians will be played by Robert
Lewis, Leonard Bartlett, Cary Odell,
Jack McDowell, and Joe Thompson.
Goldina's two girl friends will be
played by Margaret Cummings and
Elizabeth Cramer.
Roughs' seats will be sold at the
box office before the play. A one,
o'clock dance will follow the perform
ance.
