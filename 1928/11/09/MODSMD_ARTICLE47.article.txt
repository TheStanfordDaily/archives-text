# ANCIENT PIANO TO TOP PYRE OF GOLDEN BEAR
## 
### 
The Golden Bear will be roasted amid
musical roars at the Big Game bonfire
rally this year.
Leaping flames will produce the roars,
while the music will come from a first
class piano perched on top of the blazing
pyre.
The piano, an antique Vose model, was
presented yesterday to Dick Broderick,
chairman of the frosh bonfire committee,
by the Breakers Club. And the piano is
well broken in. Having a few broken
keys, busted pedals, and bursted wire
strings, the instrument can't be beat.

Bryn Mawr girls have discarded
cigarettes in favor of pipes.
