# LUNATIC TAKES ROSTRUM Card-U.S.C. Debate Disturbed CROWD CHEERS SPEAKER
## 
### 
"My husband is sick at Yellowstone
and Herbert Hoover flew out there to '
comfort him," was the startling state
ment made by an insane woman who
mounted the platform and began to
address about 800 people gathered to
listen to the Stanford-U.S.C. debate
held in Los Angeles Monday night.
Robert McClintock, Republican speak
er in the debate, brought the story |
to the campus on his return from the I
South.
During the second rebuttal the lady
took the platform for the first time
and was ushered off by the chairman.
When the open forum which followed
the debate was in progress, the lady
again decided that she had something
to say. She walked up to the speakers'
stand and began to make another
speech amid the applause and cheer
ing of the crowd.
On the second occasion the chair
man seemed to be undecided as to
what course to follow, so McClintock
took it upon himself to escort the
lady from the stage while she con
tinued to deliver her message.
The occurence was the second dis
turbance at pre-election debates in
which Stanford students took part. A

near-riot was barely avoided at the
California-Stanford debate in San
Francisco when Leon ltovetta of Cali
fornia stirred up the Smith supporters
by referring to the Democratic candi
date as a drinking man.
