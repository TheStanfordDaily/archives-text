# C.S.P.A. STARTED FOR NO REASON, WHISPERS PREXY
## Great Things Have Come to Pass Since Mistake Was First Perpetrated 
### BURNELL GOULD, aged 3 
Stanford '31
First President of C.S.P.A.
Five years or so ago, when Aunt Betty
was just a tiny girl, a lot of Stanford
people had just a dandy idea. So they
sent out a great many letters, and lo and
behold what should happen but an en
thusiastic convention "on the Farm." The
Stanford folks were journ-al-ists and he
longed to an organization called Sig-ma
Del-ta Chi (ki) The folks they invited
were from high school, engaged in the
interesting work of journalism and also
in publishing high school newspapers and
annuals.
This was back in the dim. dark days
of 1924 when the "hello" spirit was in
vogue, and before automobiles had been
invented, so the first thing some of the
delegates saw about Stanford was the
red "street car." They started to turn
back, discouraged, but were finally per
suaded to stay. It was a good thing they
changed their minds, for everybody had
just the bestest time.
There Is a Happy Land
Carl Shoup and Norris James, two
Sig-ma Del-ta Chi men, were in charge,
and they saw to it that the first conven
tion was enjoyed by men, women, and
children.
Everyone learned so much about jour
nalism, in fact, that one and all decided
they ought to have a permanent organi
zation. No sooner said than done. They
elected officers, too, but that is another
story of which "ye author" would rather
not say anything.
Then next year an even larger group
gathered and had "fellowship" together.
The enjoyable round of banquets and
other eating, interspersed with a good
deal of talking, was continued from 1924.
Tommy Murphy of Piedmont High, Oak
land (pardon, Piedmont) was elected to
preside for the third gathering.
Delegates Couldn't Wait
But the delegates had such a good time
that they just couldn't wait another year.
So they had a fourth convention that fall
of 1925, and the meetings have been held
in the autumn ever since—and what fun!
On looking back at the first president,
the delegates decided to elect by schools
rather than individuals, so Glendale High
School was chosen for the presidency,
and Walter Andrews, in turn, was se
lected to head the convention.
This quaint custom has continued, and
Dave Lyons of University High, Oak
land, followed Mr. Andrews. This year
(1928), for those who just can't remem
ber dates) Basil Magee of Lowell will
handle the gavel.
C.S.I.P.F. Becomes C.S.P.A.
The Association was originally called
the California State Inter-Scholastic
Press Federation, but the "folks" had
difficulty carrying that and their luggage,
too, so it was changed to C.S.P.A. This
means Come, Sleep, Play, And (Talk and
Eat—the last initials were left off by an
oversight).
All in all, the Association, as well as
the conventions, has been a resounding
success—especially if that little girl from
Rococo High (what zcas her name-)
comes back this year.

Five years or so ago, when Aunt Betty
was just a tiny girl, a lot of Stanford
people had just a dandy idea. So they
sent out a great many letters, and lo and
behold what should happen but an en
thusiastic convention "on the Farm." The
Stanford folks were journ-al-ists and he
longed to an organization called Sig-ma
Del-ta Chi (ki) The folks they invited
were from high school, engaged in the
interesting work of journalism and also
in publishing high school newspapers and
annuals.
This was back in the dim. dark days
of 1924 when the "hello" spirit was in
vogue, and before automobiles had been
invented, so the first thing some of the
delegates saw about Stanford was the
red "street car." They started to turn
back, discouraged, but were finally per
suaded to stay. It was a good thing they
changed their minds, for everybody had
just the bestest time.
There Is a Happy Land
Carl Shoup and Norris James, two
Sig-ma Del-ta Chi men, were in charge,
and they saw to it that the first conven
tion was enjoyed by men, women, and
children.
Everyone learned so much about jour
nalism, in fact, that one and all decided
they ought to have a permanent organi
zation. No sooner said than done. They
elected officers, too, but that is another
story of which "ye author" would rather
not say anything.
Then next year an even larger group
gathered and had "fellowship" together.
The enjoyable round of banquets and
other eating, interspersed with a good
deal of talking, was continued from 1924.
Tommy Murphy of Piedmont High, Oak
land (pardon, Piedmont) was elected to
preside for the third gathering.
Delegates Couldn't Wait
But the delegates had such a good time
that they just couldn't wait another year.
So they had a fourth convention that fall
of 1925, and the meetings have been held
in the autumn ever since—and what fun!
On looking back at the first president,
the delegates decided to elect by schools
rather than individuals, so Glendale High
School was chosen for the presidency,
and Walter Andrews, in turn, was se
lected to head the convention.
This quaint custom has continued, and
Dave Lyons of University High, Oak
land, followed Mr. Andrews. This year
(1928), for those who just can't remem
ber dates) Basil Magee of Lowell will
handle the gavel.
C.S.I.P.F. Becomes C.S.P.A.
The Association was originally called
the California State Inter-Scholastic
Press Federation, but the "folks" had
difficulty carrying that and their luggage,
too, so it was changed to C.S.P.A. This
means Come, Sleep, Play, And (Talk and
Eat—the last initials were left off by an
oversight).
All in all, the Association, as well as
the conventions, has been a resounding
success—especially if that little girl from
Rococo High (what zcas her name-)
comes back this year.
