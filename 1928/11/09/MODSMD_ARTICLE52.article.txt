# HARRIMAN SPEAKS ON "STATIC IN LANGUAGE"
## 
### 
"Adam and Eve conversed in Dutch,
God spoke to them in Swedish, and
the Serpent talked in French, accord
ing to medieval authorities on lan
guage," said Profesßor R. D. Harri
man of the Classical Literature De-1
partment, Wednesday night. Professor |
Harriman lectured at a meeting of j
Chi Nu Kappa, Classical Literature J
Honor Society, on "Static in Lan- j
guage." • j
"Most people have no idea of the j
meaning of the words they use," con- ;
tinued Professor Harriman. "A per- i
son would be highly insulted if called 1
'half-baked,' yet he would be flattered '
if he was said to be precocious. How- j
ever, precocious is derived from a j
Lutin word which has exactly the j
same meaning as 'half-baked'. "
