# LEST WE FORGET

### Feg Murray 
The anniversary of the Armistice
brings to mind the many athletes who
gave up their lives in the World War,
and coming as it does in football sea
son, we will limit this discussion to
the soldiers of the gridiron and pass
over Johnny Overton, Tony Wilding,
Eddie Grant, and others from other
sports who made the Supreme Sacri
fice.
It is too bad that a complete record
of college football players who were
killed or died in service is not avail
able. A fitting memorial to that mag
nificent body of athletes who gave up
their lives to a far greater cause than
winning for their Alma Mater would
be a very fine thing. But where would
you put it? Princeton is the spot that
first comes to mind, for what college
or university in the land gave more
freely of her gridiron sons than Old
Nassau? Johnny Poe, '95; Bleuthen
thal, center on Sam White's team
(class of 1812, I believe); Hobey

Baker, captain in 1914, and greatest |
of all college hockey stars, are the
three most famous Tiger stars to Go
West for Old Glory. Baker was killed
in an aviation accident at Toul, i
France, the day after Christmas, 1918, !
while Poe was killed in action with
the Black Watch near Loos in 1915. j
The story is that Poe met his death
while rushing forward in an attack,
and as he charged low over the
ground amid flying bullets and burst- J

ing shrapnel, he called out his old
Princeton signal numbers.
Yale is proud of Alex Wilson, cap
tain of the 1!)15 football team, and
Dartmouth of "Spud" Pishon, that
diminutive quarterback of 1908 and
li) 09, who, like Baker, died in the
Air Service in France. Then there are
Dave Henry, of Brown; Starr, of Har
vard; Shull, of Chicago; Healy, of
Columbia; Gard and Noble, of Stan
ford; Turner, of Williams, who was

j posthumously voted the Congression
|al Medal of Honor; and Curry and
i Price, ot' Vanderbilt. This list is far
I from complete.
So give a passing thought to these
I heroes as you sit in your raccoon
I coat, well outfitted with hip-flasks,
blankets, and apples in some stadium
this week-end, enjoying a thrilling
j game of football. Remember that they
fought and bled and died for you and
j yours, so don't forget them in the
excitement of the moment over the
deeds of the present-day Cagles,
.Humes, Strongs, and Williamses.

the soldiers of the gridiron and pass
over Johnny Overton, Tony Wilding,
Eddie Grant, and others from other
sports who made the Supreme Sacri
fice.
It is too bad that a complete record
of college football players who were
killed or died in service is not avail
able. A fitting memorial to that mag
nificent body of athletes who gave up
their lives to a far greater cause than
winning for their Alma Mater would
be a very fine thing. But where would
you put it? Princeton is the spot that
first comes to mind, for what college
or university in the land gave more
freely of her gridiron sons than Old
Nassau? Johnny Poe, '95; Bleuthen
thal, center on Sam White's team
(class of 1812, I believe); Hobey

Baker, captain in 1914, and greatest |
of all college hockey stars, are the
three most famous Tiger stars to Go
West for Old Glory. Baker was killed
in an aviation accident at Toul, i
France, the day after Christmas, 1918, !
while Poe was killed in action with
the Black Watch near Loos in 1915. j
The story is that Poe met his death
while rushing forward in an attack,
and as he charged low over the
ground amid flying bullets and burst- J

ing shrapnel, he called out his old
Princeton signal numbers.
Yale is proud of Alex Wilson, cap
tain of the 1!)15 football team, and
Dartmouth of "Spud" Pishon, that
diminutive quarterback of 1908 and
li) 09, who, like Baker, died in the
Air Service in France. Then there are
Dave Henry, of Brown; Starr, of Har
vard; Shull, of Chicago; Healy, of
Columbia; Gard and Noble, of Stan
ford; Turner, of Williams, who was

j posthumously voted the Congression
|al Medal of Honor; and Curry and
i Price, ot' Vanderbilt. This list is far
I from complete.
So give a passing thought to these
I heroes as you sit in your raccoon
I coat, well outfitted with hip-flasks,
blankets, and apples in some stadium
this week-end, enjoying a thrilling
j game of football. Remember that they
fought and bled and died for you and
j yours, so don't forget them in the
excitement of the moment over the
deeds of the present-day Cagles,
.Humes, Strongs, and Williamses.

The anniversary of the Armistice
brings to mind the many athletes who
gave up their lives in the World War,
and coming as it does in football sea
son, we will limit this discussion to
the soldiers of the gridiron and pass

Eddie Grant, and others from other
