WASHINGTON, Nov. 8. (£>)— Re
: publicans have established clear ma
| jorities in the next Congress in both
Senate and House but have failed to
keep full pace with the record-break
tng sweep of their party head, Her
bert Hoover.
Almost complete returns tonight
showed that the new Congress, going
into office after next March 4, would
be divided as follows: Senate, Repub
licans, 55; Democrats, 39; Farmer-
I Labor, 1; vacant, 1. House, Republi
cans, 207; Democrats, 167; Farmer
j Labor, 1.
i Republicans held all of their 13
! Senate seats at issue in this election
but captured only seven of the 20
j Democratic positions at stake. The
I Senate is almost evenly divided at
j present.
In the House election with all 435
seats involved, the Republicans won
27 places now held by Democrats and
replaced the lone Socialist, Victor
Btrger, of Wisconsin, and one of the
two Farmer-Labor members, William
!L. Carss, of Minnesota. Democrats
j succeeded in capturing three seats
j now held by Republicans, one each in
j Indiana, Rhode Island, and West Vir
j ginia>.
j There were 435 House seats and 35
j Senate seats to be filled in the fall
| elections and in these 470 contests
; there were only 39 switches in politi
-1 cal make-up.

Women students at Oxford consider
I the matter of dress as very trivial,
and any form of cosmetics is an indi
| cation of bad taste.
