# WAGNER, CREAGH WIN FIRST MOOT COURT ARGUMENT
## 
### 
Opening the annual Moot Court con
tests, Wagner and Creagh won from
Smith and Boyd last night in a tort case j
before Attorney A, J. Howe of Palo J
Alto. The case was ably handled by 1
both sides.

The facts given the contestants for the j
case were furnished by the Moot Court
board, a group of law students appointed
by the Law School faculty. The contest
was in the nature of a damage suit, in
which the plaintiff was injured by the
defendant. Insanity, which took the form
of melancholy, resulted from the injury,
and the injured man took his own life.
His heirs sued the defendant for dam
ages, but lost the case in the superior
court.
Buena Vista College at Storm Lake,
lowa, with twenty-one students and
sixteen teachers, is the smallest col- i
lege in the United States.
