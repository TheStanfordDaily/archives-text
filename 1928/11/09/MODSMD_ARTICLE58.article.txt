# W. U. PRESIDENT MAKES REFORM PLEA
## Dr. Spencer Asks For Student Co-operation in Putting End To Drinking, Petting, Gambling, Hell Week 
### 
Dr. M. Lyle Spencer, president of
the University of Washington, in
making a personal plea for student
co-operation in order to end drinking,
potting, gambling, and "rough weeks,"
recently caused a great deal of specu
lation and discussion upon the Wash
ington campus. At a special meeting
more than 2000 fraternity and soror
ity members heard Dr. Spencer state
that these "moral problems" were
facing them for solution.
Dr. Spencer opened his remarks
with a plea for "right government"
on the campus, emphasizing that by
right government he meant a co
operative leadership of the student
body by the students and the admin
istration.
His speech which appeared in the
Seattle Times follows, in part:
"Effective government at the uni
versity should be based on right
leadership rather than domination,
and if leadership can be presented in
the right way there can be no fear
of the results.
"This meeting of fraternity and
sorority members and their alumni
was called for three reasons:
1. Because you are the chief sinners
on the campus. You are six times
as bad as the non-fraternity and
non-sorority members.
2 Because you undeniably represent
the leadership on the campus, and
3. Because if I could get your lead
ership, your co-operation, and your
understanding of the problems we
must face, I would have no fear
of the future.
"First, I want to touch on 'rough
week.' I spoke of it in my inaugural
address. Since then I have had two
or three responses where organized
houses have said, of their own ac
cord, that they would lessen the or
deals to which freshmen are sub
jected. I could stop them altogether,
I believe, but I don't believe in that
method of government.

"You men are not necessarily going
to the dogs, but the chances are
against you. 1 have no statistics to
offer for the women. When 1 was In
school the man with liquor on his
breath couldn't get a woman to dance
with him. Times change.
"The situation can be handled four
ways. One is by spying on you, and
I won't do that. Another is the method
another college president used. He
arranged with revenue officers to raid
fraternity and sorority houses which
wtre suspicious. He led the campaign
himself. Thirdly, I can appeal to the
national officers of your fraternities
and sororities. You know what that
means. I choose to come to you as
man to man and appeal to you to
join with me in right conduct.
"Other campuses have wanted to
throw fraternities and sororities off,
but the reason was that snobbery ex
isted. My personal opinion is that
there should be enough fraternities
and sororities on this campus so that
every man and woman could be a
member of one."

potting, gambling, and "rough weeks,"
recently caused a great deal of specu
lation and discussion upon the Wash
ington campus. At a special meeting
more than 2000 fraternity and soror
ity members heard Dr. Spencer state
that these "moral problems" were
facing them for solution.
Dr. Spencer opened his remarks
with a plea for "right government"
on the campus, emphasizing that by
right government he meant a co
operative leadership of the student
body by the students and the admin
istration.
His speech which appeared in the
Seattle Times follows, in part:
"Effective government at the uni
versity should be based on right
leadership rather than domination,
and if leadership can be presented in
the right way there can be no fear
of the results.
"This meeting of fraternity and
sorority members and their alumni
was called for three reasons:
1. Because you are the chief sinners
on the campus. You are six times
as bad as the non-fraternity and
non-sorority members.
2 Because you undeniably represent
the leadership on the campus, and
3. Because if I could get your lead
ership, your co-operation, and your
understanding of the problems we
must face, I would have no fear
of the future.
"First, I want to touch on 'rough
week.' I spoke of it in my inaugural
address. Since then I have had two
or three responses where organized
houses have said, of their own ac
cord, that they would lessen the or
deals to which freshmen are sub
jected. I could stop them altogether,
I believe, but I don't believe in that
method of government.

"You men are not necessarily going
to the dogs, but the chances are
against you. 1 have no statistics to
offer for the women. When 1 was In
school the man with liquor on his
breath couldn't get a woman to dance
with him. Times change.
"The situation can be handled four
ways. One is by spying on you, and
I won't do that. Another is the method
another college president used. He
arranged with revenue officers to raid
fraternity and sorority houses which
wtre suspicious. He led the campaign
himself. Thirdly, I can appeal to the
national officers of your fraternities
and sororities. You know what that
means. I choose to come to you as
man to man and appeal to you to
join with me in right conduct.
"Other campuses have wanted to
throw fraternities and sororities off,
but the reason was that snobbery ex
isted. My personal opinion is that
there should be enough fraternities
and sororities on this campus so that
every man and woman could be a
member of one."
