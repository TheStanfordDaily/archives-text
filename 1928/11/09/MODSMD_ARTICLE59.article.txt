### The Associated Press 
With returns being slowly tabulated
in the missing election districts of
the country, Herbert Hoover today
continued to increase his presidential
victory with its greatest electoral ma
jority and the largest popular vote in
the nation's history.
The compilation of the missing
.'votes in many cases, especially in
southern and border states, brought
lorth larger leads for the Republican
president-elect.
There was little likelihood of any
shift of electoral votes of any state
from either Hoover's column or that
of Alfred E. Smith, his defeated
Democratic opponent, as a result of
the vote from the districts yet tabu
lated.
The President-elect plans to recu
perate from his arduous campaign ef
fort during the remainder of the week
at his home in Palo Alto, while Sena
tor Curtis, the Vice-President-elect,
returned to Washington and also plans
a short rest.
