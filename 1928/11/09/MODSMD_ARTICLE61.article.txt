# VIOLINIST, TOSCHA SEIDEL, PRESENTS VARIED PROGRAM
## 
### 
"Vitali's 'Chaconne' is my favorite
composition," said Toscha Seidel, emi
nent violinist, in an interview after
his concert here last night. Auer's
greatest pupil, compared by some as
equal to Kreisler, Btarted his program
with this number.
Gounod's "Ave Maria" was inter
preted with exquisite feeling and
technique by Seidel, and "Romance
in F," "Rondino," and the Turkish
March from "Ruins of Athens" by
Beethoven showed the artist's versa
tility.
The Concerto in E Minor, Opus 64,
by Mendelssohn, with its three move
ments, the Allegro molto appassionata,
the Andante, and the Allegro molto
vivace was beautiful. The Andante,
with its subtle diminuendos and cre-
Bcendos, and appealing, dolce melody,
offered the best opportunity for Sei
del's rare command of the violin, and
he made it the most exquisite selec
tion of the program.

Invitations to 10,000 fathers have
been issued for University of Minne
sota's homecoming day.
