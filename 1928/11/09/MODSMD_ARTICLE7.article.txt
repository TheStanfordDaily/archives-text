# CARD GRAYS WILL CLASH WITH BEAR GOOFS TOMORROW
## Teams Will Enter Fray On Equal Basis; Both Are Undefeated So Far 
### 
Stanford's Grays will go up against
the California Goofs tomorrow noon at
the Berkeley Stadium as a preliminary
to the Little Big Game between the
freshmen of the two universities. The
Grays were supposed to have played the
San Jose varsity last Wednesday, but
the contest was called off because the
Teachers aggregation was hit by a bad
attack of the flu.
Members of the Gray team have been
particularly lucky in escaping injuries
this season. There have only been a few
minor accidents on the field and the whole
squad will be physically fit for tomor
row's contest.
Teams Nearly Equal
The two teams will enter the fray on
a nearly equal basis. Neither has played
many games this season, and both have
been successful in those in which they
have performed. The recent Card vic
tory over the Saint Mary's reserves may
make them the slight favorites, but from
a standpoint of man power and reserve
material, they are comparatively equal.
Coach Ed Walker has built up a strong
line around Albertson at center. With
Miller and Dawson at guard, and Oliver
and Erhorn at tackle, the Grays have a
forward combination which should be
hard to stop. Mike Reynolds will start
at one end, and cither Pike or Wittenau
at the other.
