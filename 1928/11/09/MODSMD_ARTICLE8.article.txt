# FROSH CRASH THEATRES TO CLIMAX PAJAMARINO; POLICE FORCE CALLED
## Pranksters in Brilliantly Colored Night Dress Commandeer Car for Pre-Game Celebration in Palo Alto 
### 
Descending on Palo Alto after staging
their annual "Little Big Game" pajama
rino on the campus last night, nearly
one hundred cheering freshmen, clad in
brilliant colored pajamas, attempted to
crash the gate at both the Stanford and j
Varsity theaters. At the Stanford
they were met by several police officers
who happened to be near, but about
twenty-five succeeded in getting into the
Varsity.
A hurried rush of police ensued. The
officers entered the place and ejected '
everyone who did not have the presence j
of mind to discard his pajamas.
Castilleja Raid Planned
Leaving the Varsity, the frosh enthusi
asts planned a raid on the Castilleja j
school for girls, but Chief of Police 11. j
A. Zink called a halt to the parade and
delivered a lecture to the pranksters.
"I know that you boys fcre only play- |
ing a prank," lie said, "but you arc cans- '
ing a lot of disturbance which we cannot j
tolerate. Stanford University has helped

to build up the city here and has a fine
record. I am sure that you boys who
are just entering school will want to up
hold its reputation. This isn't the right
thing to do, so I ask you to return to
the campus."
With that the frosh began to disperse
and returned to the campus in straggling
squads.
Leaders Lose Control
Fred Northway, yell leader, and Leon
Levi of the Rally Committee, who were
leading the parade around the campus,
lost control of the enthusiastic frosh
after leaving Roble Hall. The freshmen
rushed the street car at the Union and
ordered the motorman to take them to
Palo Alto. Fearing a repetition of the
Hallowe'en prank which was so costly,
the motorman complied. Other members
of the class commandeered cars to take
them to town.
After a meeting of Encina Club to
discuss plans for the bonfire, the parade
began with the pajama-clad frosh going
first to the Library to give a "sky rocket"
for Uic "dryballs." from tliere they pro
ceeded up the Row cheering and singing.
The freshmen next filed up the Hill to
cheer President Wilbur.
Down to Roble marched the vari
colored members of '32 to cheer the Stan
ford Frosh football team on to victory
over the California Babes in the Little
Big Game Saturday. Numerous flash
lights were produced to place the mem
bers of the "500" in the spotlight as they
leaned from the windows of the hall.
The rally broke up with a "sky rocket"
for the "Roble Women," and the raid to
Palo Alto followed.
