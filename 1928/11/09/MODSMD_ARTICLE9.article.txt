# STANFORD TO START SUBSTITUTE BACKFIELD AGAINST SANTA CLARA
## Simkins, Smalling, Winnek, Frentrup Are Chosen to Battle Walsh's Broncos 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
A new backfield combination and
two substitute ends will start the
game here tomorrow with Adam
Walsh's Santa Clara Broncos.
The starting backfield will consist
of Lud Frentrup and Phil Winnek at
halves, Bill Simkins, fullback, and
Chuck Smalling, quarter. The fact
that each of these men has one or
more years of football competition
left is taken as an indication that Pop
Warner is trying out the combination
for use next season when Hoffman,
Lewis, Sims, Wilton, and others will
have graduated.
Line Is Strong
Tomorrow's starting Cardinal line
will consist of the lirst-string lines
men from tackle to tackle. Joe Bush
and Kay Albertson will start at the
end berths instead of Spud Harder
and Mush Muller, both of whom are
on the list of injured wingmen, with
Johnny Preston and Dick Worden.
Stanford will be out tomorrow to
avenge the defeat received from Santa
Clara while Warner and Captain Hal
McCreery were up at Berkeley scout
ing the California Bears preparatory
to the Big Game. Then, too, the Cardi
nal would like to overcome the bad
taste left in its mouth from the Tro
jan defeat. Feeling that victory, the
greater the more desirable, Avould
sweeten, the redbirds will be out to
attempt some real scoring.
