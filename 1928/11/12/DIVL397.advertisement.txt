TOWER'S Fish Brand Slick
ers are not only water-proof.
They're wind-proof—warm.
The "Varsity" model is
full-lined, and long enough to
protect your trousers. Big,
wide "Staydfast" pockets, in
which you can stow your
books easily—patented "Re
flex" edge that keeps water
from running in at the front.
Corduroy-faced collar with
or without a strap. Colors
olive-khaki, black and yellow.
You can buy a Tower's
Fish Brand Slicker for the
price of a couple of theatre
tickets. Stores everywhere
carry them. A. J. Tower
Company, Boston, Mass.
