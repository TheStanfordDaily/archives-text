# CARDINALS TAME BRONCS; AVENGE DEFEAT OF 1927
## Hoover Attends Santa Clara Tilt; Warner Employs 'A' Formation, Passing Attack Reserve Backfield Promises To Be Great as 1929 First String Power Combination 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Saturday was a big day for Stan
ford athletes. The Cardinal frosh de
feated the Bear frosh in the annual
Little Big Game, the Stanford Grays
swamped the California reserves, the
soccer eleven took the Berkeley soc
cer team into camp. Then to climax
a successful day, the Card varsity
football team tamed Adam Walsh's
belligerent Broncos from Santa Clara
by a 31-0 score to avenge the upset
received last year.
The score favored Stanford 7-0 at
the half and turned into a walkaway
in the second half, but the game was
sufficiently entertaining for Herbert
Hoover and party to remain until the
very end. It was the first game that
Hoover had witnessed his alma mater
play in many moons, and though he
did not see Warner's famous "B"
Formation in action, he saw "A" For
mation do the trick just as well.
New Lineup Seen
Hoover and 20,000 other spectators
-also saw that with Simkins, Smalling,
Rothert, Clark, and Frentrup, Stan
ford's backfield lineup for next year
will not be lacking. These men all
took a turn in the Santa Clara game
and gave the fans an eyefull of foot
ball.
Pop Warner started a first-string
team with the exception of Frentrup
in the backfield and Davidson and
Bush at ends. It was an even game
until Smalling, replacing Fleishacker
at quarterback, scooted through the
line on a fake reverse in the second
-quarter and scored Stanford's first
touchdown. Hoffman converted for
the extra point.
Reverse Plays Good
The gains that Stanford made in
the first half were made mostly on
"Warner reverses. Determined to stop
these reverses in the second halt', the
Bronco backs played in close. The
Cards took advantage of this and
-opened up with a passing attack that
netted four more touchdowns, not one
of which was converted.
The Warner artillery was really at
its best in the final period with the
.Stanford substitutes again playing an
important part against a team weak
ened through the battering of the
.first eleven. Stanford's reinforced
team was able to score three of its
.five goals in the fourth quarter and
missed scoring another when Lewis
received a long pass just a yard over
the Santa Clara end zone.
Many Passes
The Cards threw sixteen passes,
completing eight, and made fifteen
.first downs to their opponents' eight.
After Hoffman left the game, Simkins
<lid the passing for the Cards and
included real accuracy in his distance
tosses, one of which traveled fifty
yards.
Heinecke, the little center whom
the Trojan ball-carriers will long re
member, was the outstanding lines
man again Saturday. He was particu
larly in evidence on defense.
Needless to add, Stanford suffered
Ihc usual injuries of a tough game—
as the Santa Clara game was in spite
of the score. However, none of the
injuries are believed to be serious
■enough to keep any of the Cardinals
cut of the encounter with the Wash
ington Huskies here next Saturday.

-also saw that with Simkins, Smalling,
Rothert, Clark, and Frentrup, Stan
ford's backfield lineup for next year
will not be lacking. These men all
took a turn in the Santa Clara game
and gave the fans an eyefull of foot
ball.
Pop Warner started a first-string
team with the exception of Frentrup
in the backfield and Davidson and
Bush at ends. It was an even game
until Smalling, replacing Fleishacker
at quarterback, scooted through the
line on a fake reverse in the second
-quarter and scored Stanford's first
touchdown. Hoffman converted for
the extra point.
Reverse Plays Good
The gains that Stanford made in
the first half were made mostly on
"Warner reverses. Determined to stop
these reverses in the second halt', the
Bronco backs played in close. The
Cards took advantage of this and
-opened up with a passing attack that
netted four more touchdowns, not one
of which was converted.
The Warner artillery was really at
its best in the final period with the
.Stanford substitutes again playing an
important part against a team weak
ened through the battering of the
.first eleven. Stanford's reinforced
team was able to score three of its
.five goals in the fourth quarter and
missed scoring another when Lewis
received a long pass just a yard over
the Santa Clara end zone.
Many Passes
The Cards threw sixteen passes,
completing eight, and made fifteen
.first downs to their opponents' eight.
After Hoffman left the game, Simkins
<lid the passing for the Cards and
included real accuracy in his distance
tosses, one of which traveled fifty
yards.
Heinecke, the little center whom
the Trojan ball-carriers will long re
member, was the outstanding lines
man again Saturday. He was particu
larly in evidence on defense.
Needless to add, Stanford suffered
Ihc usual injuries of a tough game—
as the Santa Clara game was in spite
of the score. However, none of the
injuries are believed to be serious
■enough to keep any of the Cardinals
cut of the encounter with the Wash
ington Huskies here next Saturday.
Saturday was a big day for Stan
ford athletes. The Cardinal frosh de
feated the Bear frosh in the annual
Little Big Game, the Stanford Grays
swamped the California reserves, the
soccer eleven took the Berkeley soc
cer team into camp. Then to climax
a successful day, the Card varsity
football team tamed Adam Walsh's
belligerent Broncos from Santa Clara
by a 31-0 score to avenge the upset
received last year.
The score favored Stanford 7-0 at
the half and turned into a walkaway
in the second half, but the game was
sufficiently entertaining for Herbert
Hoover and party to remain until the
very end. It was the first game that
Hoover had witnessed his alma mater
play in many moons, and though he
did not see Warner's famous "B"
Formation in action, he saw "A" For
mation do the trick just as well.
