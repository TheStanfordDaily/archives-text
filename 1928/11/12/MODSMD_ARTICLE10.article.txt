# FROSH DEFEATED BY '30 GRIDMEN IN CLOSE GAME
## 
### 
In the final interclass football game
of the season, the freshman team,
which had already clinched the 1928
championship, lost to the junior
eleven last Friday, 12-0. The weight
of the juniors was too much for the
lighter freshmen, and the latter could
do little against the heavy '30 line.
The juniors scored their touchdowns
as the result of long drives down the
Held, line bucks gaining most of the
yardage.
Northrup and Max Stanley looked
particularly good for the victors;
while Dewel, halfback, and Smith,
center, played well for the freshmen.
The class of 1932, as winner of the
interclass championship, will be
awarded the interclass trophy now
on display at Biff Hoffman's. Mem
bers of the freshman team will be
awarded class numerals.
The standing of the four teams is
as follows:
Won Lost Tied Pet.
Freshmen 2 1 0 .666
Seniors 11 1 .500
Juniors 11 1 .500
Sophomores 1 2 0 .333
