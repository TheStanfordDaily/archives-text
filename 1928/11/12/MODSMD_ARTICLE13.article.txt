# OUTNUMBERED DAILY GRIDSTERS WIN MORAL VICTORY FROM JOKESMITHS
## 
### DAMON ONION 
With the stands in a continuous
uproar and the players in a continu
ous daze, the outnumbered "scribe"
eleven held the powerful Hammer
and-Coffin sixteen to a 6-6 tie in the
annual grid classic between the Stan
lord Daily and the Chaparral staffs.
One of the big features of the af
fair was the broadcast of the en
counter over ti stadium-wide hiccup
by the famous bedtime radio man,
Graham McCracker, who did not al
low his play-by-play reports to inter
fere with his description of the misty
hills, orange groves, and beautiful
roses. The Santa Clara game proved
to be an added attraction.
The unique double huddle system,
inaugurated last year to eliminate the
defensive team's usual embarassment,
was employed Saturday and proved
of untold benefit in promoting sympa
thetic understanding between the ri
val teams.
The Old Boy's cohorts, clad in the
athletic ensemble of the Five Hun

dred, appeared on the field shortly
after the auxiliary of Pluvian nymphs,
Krough and Pascoe, had performed
the task of dampening the turf. Then
followed the advent of the scurrilous
Scribes.
Not having a half-dollar, Referee
Holt flipped an equal sum of mone
tar two quarters in the air. Before
the coins disappeared it was discov
ever that one landed "heads" and the
other showed "tails." Consequently
the referee kicked off.
The jokesters had a smooth-running
machine, evidently well-oiled indi
vidually. They received the ball and j
in Ave plays scored a touchdown, j
Hubler of the Chaparral fumbled the)
ball on the scoring play and Conroy
managed to attract the ball over the
end line. McCracker explained to the
spectators that they should not take
the play too seriously as there "was
probably a string attached."
The Daily received and, with the
revised Notre Dame leap frog shift,
was able to tear orr considerable
yardage. Paine, Chappie's all-rouild
player, ran arouud in circles. The
journalists completed a "blanket
pass" to Silverman with the use of
a blanket. Reeder then snagged an
other pass which put the ball on the
one-yard line. Oagos was thrown for
a touchdowu. Agaiu the formality of
conversion was overlooked. Score:
Daily (J, Chaparral 6.
Daily kicked off to Norman who
made a lateral pass to Van King. The
latter proceeded through the Daily
ticklers and after a fifty-yard run was
about to score when he was stopped
by the Daily's safety man, O (apos
trophe) Meara who slyly whipped out
a little .32 revolver and dropped the
runner with three shots through his
pconce. He was mournfully carried
from the field and the game was
called on account of rain.
