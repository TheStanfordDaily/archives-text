# College Opportunity Shunned By Lincoln Is Claim Of Barton
## 
### 
"Contrary to the opinion of most
people, Abraham Lincoln could have
gone to college, but did not choose
to do so at the time," said the Rever
end William E. Barton in reply to
a query as to what the Great Emanci
pator would do if he were living to
day.
Dr. Barton is the authority on this
subject, having published several
books on the life of Lincoln last year.
He is now reading proof on his latest
work, "The Lineage of Lincoln,"
which will contain some very unsus
pected finds.
"Ask me some more," said Dr. Bar
ton, as he packed up preparing to
return to Chicago. "I fairly drip of
'Lincoln'. "

"Many of his associates in New
Salem were going to college, and
Lincoln himself considered the propo
sition seriously enough to buy a book
of Greek exercises. He was too deep
ly interested in politics, however, and
for four years kept on losing money
at his work when he might have been
earning a diploma. It is an error to
think that an education was beyond
his possibility.
"The question of whether or not a
college education would have made
or marred Lincoln is a matter of
speculation. Later in his career lie
grew to have a keen appreciation for
what a J.D. meant in the courtroom,

trained lawyers were coming into
Illinois. He realized that their analy
ses were finer and their reasoning
more precise.

"After his share in the 'Reaper
case' between the McCormicks and
the Manneys in 1845, Lincoln an

"Lincoln required that Robert, his
only son who reached a college age,
study law. He went to Harvard and
graduated from the law school, so
there is little doubt," concluded Dr.
Barton, "but that Lincoln was de
