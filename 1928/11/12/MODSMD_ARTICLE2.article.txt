I resident of the United States, but
lie has not forgotten his undergradu
ate days at Stanford University,
He still has the good old "hello"
spirit. A couple of days ago he picked
up two students, who were waiting
for the "Toonerville" in Paly, and
tcave them a ride out to the campus.
The boys wanted to get out at En
■cina, but were too exicited to tell
Hoover their intentions. So they rode
<ap ta the poatoffice instead.
