# Now That Big Game
## 
### 
It's getting to be just about that time of year when:
1. Your family is complaining about the location of the Big Game
seats you got for them.
2. You find it difficult to get a date for the Big Game night celebra
tion.
3. You find it difficult to get dinner reservations for the same.
4. You find it difficult to get money to pay for what you may ulti
mately succeed in getting.
5. You discover that no California "money" is in sight.
6. You commence to wonder if Stanford is going to win that Big
Game so easily, after all, what with fumbling persisting and the L> forma
tion being flouted rather than touted.
Rase your minds, ladies and gentlemen, about the game itself. The
varsity is learning that it will have to fight down the Bears and that it
cannot win by hanging continually onto Pop's apron-strings. Stanford
has had too much confidence in the necessary superiority of Pop's plays,
and too little realization of the need of playing resourceful, heads-up
football. Ihe \\ arner system is designed for brainy football players
who understand the bewildering scope of the Warner attack and who
are quick to recognize the psychological point for the unexpected play.
By the time November 24 is with us, the signal-callers will be veterans in
calling the unique play, and then it will be -all over but the serpentining.

Stanford spirit must be improved during the two weeks which remain
before the Big Game. The sort of rooting Stanford has done so far this
season has been quite below average. To be sure, the falling down has
been partly due to the absence of Scott Webster, but even allowing for
that, it must be admitted that the Cardinal side of the Stadium is pretty
listless. Nowadays, you seldom hear a hoarse voice after a game; 'twas
not always thus —there was a day when we were unable to sing the
Hymn properly because no one could reach above G. Now, however, the
singing of the Hymn and of the other songs is quite miserable because
few start on the proper note and the rest are but distantly acquainted
with the words.
Stanford stunts are generally acknowledged to be the best on the
Coast; Stanford rooting, if we are going to have organized rooting,
should be just as good. Jf everyone would do his vocal utmost, we
could lead in the tumult and shouting just as we are accustomed to lead
on the scoreboard.

Coast; Stanford rooting, if we are going to have organized rooting,
should be just as good. Jf everyone would do his vocal utmost, we
could lead in the tumult and shouting just as we are accustomed to lead
on the scoreboard.
It's getting to be just about that time of year when:
1. Your family is complaining about the location of the Big Game
seats you got for them.
2. You find it difficult to get a date for the Big Game night celebra
tion.
3. You find it difficult to get dinner reservations for the same.
4. You find it difficult to get money to pay for what you may ulti
mately succeed in getting.
5. You discover that no California "money" is in sight.
6. You commence to wonder if Stanford is going to win that Big
Game so easily, after all, what with fumbling persisting and the L> forma
tion being flouted rather than touted.
Rase your minds, ladies and gentlemen, about the game itself. The
varsity is learning that it will have to fight down the Bears and that it
cannot win by hanging continually onto Pop's apron-strings. Stanford
has had too much confidence in the necessary superiority of Pop's plays,
and too little realization of the need of playing resourceful, heads-up
football. Ihe \\ arner system is designed for brainy football players
who understand the bewildering scope of the Warner attack and who
are quick to recognize the psychological point for the unexpected play.
By the time November 24 is with us, the signal-callers will be veterans in
calling the unique play, and then it will be -all over but the serpentining.

Stanford spirit must be improved during the two weeks which remain
before the Big Game. The sort of rooting Stanford has done so far this
season has been quite below average. To be sure, the falling down has
been partly due to the absence of Scott Webster, but even allowing for
that, it must be admitted that the Cardinal side of the Stadium is pretty
listless. Nowadays, you seldom hear a hoarse voice after a game; 'twas
not always thus —there was a day when we were unable to sing the
Hymn properly because no one could reach above G. Now, however, the
singing of the Hymn and of the other songs is quite miserable because
few start on the proper note and the rest are but distantly acquainted
with the words.
Stanford stunts are generally acknowledged to be the best on the
Coast; Stanford rooting, if we are going to have organized rooting,
should be just as good. Jf everyone would do his vocal utmost, we
could lead in the tumult and shouting just as we are accustomed to lead
on the scoreboard.
