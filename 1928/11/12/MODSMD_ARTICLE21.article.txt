average football player in the larger universities brings $10,000 to his
school through gate receipts and endowments, but gets nothing in return

football player brings in in gate receipts and endowments from overjoyed
alumni? Probably people pay their clinkers to the local B.A.C. in order
to see Capt. l»ifT Hoffman, other backfield stars, and B Formation in
motion. Too often they forget the work of the linemen, who are some
times good enough to be worth several prices of admission.
