Infidelity. By Arthur Weigall. (New
York: Brentano's, 1928. $2.50.)
Peregrine Penny makes a delight
fully attractive hero. His best point
is his figure. Without holding him
self in, he has a waistline that is
positively concave.
Camilla Worth, beautiful, clever,
and audacious, also has a good fig
ure. They find after they are married
that the habit of faithfully doing set
ting-up exercises for the benefit of
these enviable waistlines is a mutual
one.
Yet what is this element of co_i
geniality when compared to the
chasm that lies between the convic
tions of the irascible old Mr. Penny
and Camilla's aunt, the emancipated
and notorious Sarah Worth Per
egrine and Camilla are in a difficult
position. To Mr. Penny they must
appear married after the most ap
proved form, while Camilla's aunt de
mands that their union shall be un

recognized.
Around this situation H2l amazingly
clever pages of nonsense are written.
The book is consistently amusing
and sparkling, and if certain parts of
it become extravagantly farcical, this
fault is easily overlooked. And un
derneath all the nonsense the dis
cerning reader will find a rather un
merciful satire of modern society.
Peregrine and Camilla are lovable
and human individuals, but every
one of the other characters â€”Sarah
Worth, the Archdeacon and his wife,
the English Lord, and the Alderman
are frankly drawn types, and with
their smug conceit and stupidity they
make ridiculous yet lively and easily
recognizable caricatures of certain
of society's most wolthy members.
There is a loose vigor and infor
mality about the author's style that
will please some readers, and appear
somewhat cheap to others. On the
whole, "Infidelity" is pleasant read-
