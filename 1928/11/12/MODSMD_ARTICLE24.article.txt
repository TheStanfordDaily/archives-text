The Editor, Sir:
Isn't there something that could be
done about the boiler works we call
our library? While the heating system
of the building seems to have no trou
ble in giving off plenty of hot air, it
makes so much noise in performing
the operation that the library be
comes the place NOT to study in. At
times it is comparatively quiet, but
at least once or twice an evening it
bursts gloriously forth in a prolonged
and steady riveting sound. If a person

in such a reading room should create
such a noise with a hammer on a
piece of pipe, he would undoubtedly
be immediately reprimanded by a
stern librarian, and probably would
be asked how he expected anyone to
study with such a racket going on.
But the heaters are not human, and
the matter is allowed to pass by.
Studying conditions, however, are the
same in either the case of the student
with the hammer and pipe, or the
heaters. Again I ask, cannot anything
be done about it? —Q. S.
