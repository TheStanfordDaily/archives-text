# Mary Pickford To Be Coquette
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
Mary Pickford didn't realize how
much was expected of her when I
met her in her Hollywood studio last
week.
You see she has always been my
prime favorite among the stars of the
screen —and so a personal interview
was bound to be either most disil
lusioning or very, very pleasant.
This was my discovery—a five-foot
beauty. Dressed in a severely smart
navy blue street suit. Gold-colored
hair framing a small dark hat. Love
ly blue eyes, excellent features, and
nary a wrinkle to mar a school-girl
complexion. And Mary looks almost
old enough to be a college senior.
She talks without affectation and
with absolute frankness. Her appeal
on the screen is her humanity, and
she is as sympathetic and under
standing off-screen.
First Real Star
Mary is at the turning-point of her
career. There are probably many
movie-goers who do not know the
story of her climb to fame. She was
no Follies beauty, no publicity-made
star.
She was the first person to achieve
personal popularity in moving -pic
tures. Mary was the first real star —
she entered the films when they were
a novelty, and she has remained in
the limelight while all the others of
those early days have been forgotten.
Mary has become the most famous
woman living today entirely through
the efforts of herself and her mother.
She was born plain Gladys Smith in
Toronto, Canada — just thirty-five
years ago. At the age of five she
made her first appearance on the
speaking stage. When eight she went
on the road with "The Little Red
School House" company, and at nine
was starred in "The Fatal Wedding."
When eleven she played with Chaun
cey Olcott in "Edmund Burke." She
originated the part of "Betty War
ren" in David Belasco's Broadway
production of "The Warrens of Vir
ginia."
"America's Sweetheart"
She played her first camera role
when she was about fifteen, her ini
tial lead being in I). W» Griffith's
"The Violin Maker of Cremona." In
1915 she became the vice-president
of the Mary Pickford-Famous Players
Company. Her tremendous success
as "America's Sweetheart" —the syn
onym which was attached to her
name —brought her in 1916 a contract
providing a salary of 10,000 a week,
fifty per cent of her pictures' earn
ings, and the right to choose her own
stories, directors, and casts.
In 1917 she left the Paramount stu
dio, where she had been drawing this
huge salary, to become a member of
tho famous quartet of independents
—composed of herself, Charles Chap
lin, Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W.
Griffith. During the past eleven years
(his United Artists company has pros
pered so that it has taken in as as
sociates such stars as Gloria Swan
son, Norma Talmadge, John Barry
rnore, Vilma Banky, and Ronald Col
man.

Mary married Douglas Fairbanks
about seven years ago, and theirs has
been the most successful famous mar
riage the world has ever known.
When you consider the way Mary
has made her own way up the ladder
without patronage, and — what is
more important—has kept herself on
top, you can understand why she is
such an interesting person to meet.
She has brains, you see.
Until three or four years ago, she
was undisputed "queen" of the mov
ies. Then Gloria Swanson assumed
first place at the box-office, and now
Colleen Moore is the biggest magnet
—with Clara Bow running a close
second.
Mary realizes now that the "sweet
heart" type is pass 6. She has slipped
a little because she has kept her curls
in.a generation when the flapper was
the rage.
To Play "Coquette"
"I'm going to be a different person
now," she told me. "I've cut my hair
—so people should expect something
new. I know they must be tired of
seeing me in little-gi.-l roles — I'm
tired of playing them. I want to do
grown up roles, and I will from now
on.
Mary is going to catch up with the
parade that threatened to leave her
behind—she is going to lead it once
more. She is starting a new picture
next month —and here is the surprise
—it will be an "all-talkie."
"I have secured the rights to 'Co
quette,' the play which Helen Hayes
has made the hit of Broadway. The
woman's part is one of the four or
five strongest of any in the last ten
years — comparable only to Sadie
Thompson, Diane, or Anna Christie.
Likes College Boys
"Johnny Mack Brown is being con
sidered for the leading man. His
southern accent will fit in excellent
ly." Johnny is the Ail-American foot
ball boy from Alabama who played
in the East-West game at the Rose
Bowl several years ago—and who
was signed up for the movies then.
Mary has started many fellows up
the ladder—such as Lloyd Hughes,
William Haines, and Buddy Rogers—
so whoever gets the lead in "Co
quette" will be very lucky.
"I'm going to aim for the college
boys' trade from now on. And if they
like me, I know the girls will."
Mary is in her prime now, and her
years of valuable experience should
enable her to step back into First
Place with a oang.
Need I add that after meeting her
she is still my favorite actress?
