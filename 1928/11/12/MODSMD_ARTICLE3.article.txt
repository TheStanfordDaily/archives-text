## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11. (/P)â€”ITen1Ten
years to a day after the close of the
World War, President Coolidge to
night replied in spirited language to
criticisms of American isolation from
the Old World and at the same time
reiterated the necessity of a more
adequate naval defense for the United
States and its possessions.
The President spoke at a meeting
sponsored by the American Legion,
and before delivering his address he
had gone to Arlington National Ceme
tery with Mrs. Coolidge to place a
wreath on the tomb of the Unknown
Soldier.
In a manner unusual for him, after
paying tribute to those who con
tributed to American success, he went
into the personalities which loomed
large in the great conflict, singling
out Admiral Sims for his work with
the Navy, and General Pershing for
his services as head of the American
Expeditionary Forces, saying of the
General that America was indebted
to his genius for the oustanding ac
complishments of the Army.
The President dwelt at length on
American accomplishments and sacri
fices in the past and its necessities
for the future, condemning claims
that the United States had profited
from the war, and asserting strongly
the needs of the Nation for security
in the future.
He declared that the construction
of more cruisers was needed and em
phasized that the United States in
view of its geographical characteris
tics, treaty engagements, and econo
mic importance, and in view of its
lack of fueling stations and merchant
ships capable of mounting six-inch
guns, was entitled "to a larger num
ber of warships than a nation having
these advantages."
