# SCHEDULE CHANGED

### 
TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 11. (/P) â€”
Football scheduled have been changed
for many reasons, but a new one has
been found by Highland Park high
school. Its game with Seamen high
school for the Shawnee County cham- j
pionship has been advanced a day
because the Highland Park team is
out on bond and must be in court
on Friday.
