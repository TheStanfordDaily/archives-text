# CARD BABES TRIMMED BY BEAR SOCCER MEN
## 
### 
Playing the best game that they
have ever played, according to Coach
Harry Maloney, the freshmen were
defeated Saturday morning at Berke
ley by the California first-year soc
cer team, 7 to 3. An of the three
goals made by the frosh squad were
kicked by Bert Weyl, who put over
the only other goal made this season.
The Berkeley frosh have had much
previous experience and they outdid
the local 1932 men throughout the
game. But these freshmen, with the
exception of one man, had never
played soccer before coming here to
school, so they have learned and ac
complished a great deal since the
first of the season.
Saturday morning the frosh will
play the last of their California games
here on the varsity field with H. Hyde
refereeing.
Gate receipts at football games
have shown a decrease in South Au
stralia.
