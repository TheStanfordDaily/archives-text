# DEBATERS ANNUAL INCLUDES 1927-28 JOFFRE SPEECHES
## 
### 
Speeches delivered by Philip Cava
iero, Robert Hume, and Herbert We
nig in the 1927-28 Joffre debate,
which took place in Berkeley, appear
in the 1927-28 volume of the "Univer
sity Debaters Annual," which is just
oft the presses of the H. W. Wilson
Company.
"This is the first time that the
Joifre debate has appeared in the
annual owing to the difficulty of re
porting a purely extemporaneous dis
cussion," said Professor J. G. Emer
son, debate coach, in calling attention
to the publication of the Stanford
men's speeches.
Philip Cavalero, A.S.S.U. president,
won the Joifre Medal in the last con
test at California.
Joffre debates are characterized by
their free, running, extempore style,
and in order to report them accurate
ly, a stenographer attended the dis
cussion and took the speeches word
for word. The speech of each de
bater in the contest is recorded in
the Annual.
A debate on co-education between
Washington and Lee University and
the National Union Team, made up
of speakers from London, Edinburgh,
and Reading Universities in England,
included in the volume makes it
doubly interesting, according to Pro
fessor Emerson.
Princeton, Porto Rico, Michigan,
Illinois, and numerous other univer
sities who were prominent in debat
ing during the year are represented.
