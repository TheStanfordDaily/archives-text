# STANFORD GRAYS HAND U.C. GOOFS 26-0 WALLOPING
## 
### 
Stanford's Grays achieved a to 0
victory over the California Goofs at
Borkeley Saturday which surprized
both themselves and their opponents.
The Card squad hoped for little suc
cess during practice last week, but
found that they could handle the Bear
team with ease. At no time was the
outcome of the game in doubt, as the
Cal Goofs were completely battled by
Stanford's plays.
In the first quarter, Stanford gained
many yards on an exchange of kicks,
and forced the Bears to punt from
behind their goal line. Practically the
whole Stanford line was through on
the play, and the blocked ball was
recovered by Albertson for the first
score. Moffat converted for the extra
point.
In the second period the Grays put
over another touchdown. They bucked
the ball down the field on straight
line plays, and Carrol carried it over
on a quarterback sneak. Moffat failed
at the try for point. The third score
came right after the half, when Gil
bert, Card end, picked up a fumble
and ran sixty yards for a touchdown.
This time the try for point was good.
Stanford opened up a passing at
tack in the final quarter which Cal
was unable to stop. Two passes were
completed for long gains, and once
within striking distance, the Grays
scored on straight plays.
Phil Moffat was the outstanding on
the field. His kicking was excellent,
and he consistently carried the ball
for long gains. Laird, May, and Carrol
also performed well in the backfield.
