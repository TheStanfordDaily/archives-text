# SPORTS OF 1928
## A 						Dynamic Personality 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The Notre Dame eleven (or is it |
sixty-six) that Coach Knute Ilockne
brought to New York to play the pre- j
viously undefeated Army team had
been beaten this season, to be sure,
but that didn't necessarily mean that
Rock's Ramblers weren't due to rear
upon their hind hoofs and kick the
Army mule clear out of the Yankee i
Stadium as they had done more than
once before.
There was no 1924 well-synchro
nized machine to worry Biff Jones,
that's a cinch; no "Four Horsemen,"
no Adam Walsh; and there was no
George Gipp, who helped to beat the
Army in 1920. But there were some
good men just the same. "Rock"
has players of real high calibre in
Mullins, Neimic, Chevigny, Collins,
and Miller.
A word or two about King Knute,

] the Wizard of South Bend, who
makes Horsemen out of freshmen,
and who, in twelve years as coach at
Notre Dame, has lost only ten games
j out of 106 played.
ltoekne was captain of the South
I Benders in 1913, and his team went
i through that season unbeaten. Then
| he served as assistant to Jesse Har
i per for three years, and got the job
as head coach when Harper retired
at the end of the 1916 season. While
at Notre Dame, Knute did a bit of
acting, played in the band, and spe
cialized in chemistry. He taught
chemistry after graduating, and is
now track coach as well as football
coach.
The Army knew this game wouldn't
be a cinch, for there was Knute the
Magician on the sidelines, to wave
his wand of psychology and inventive
genius on his team's destiny.
