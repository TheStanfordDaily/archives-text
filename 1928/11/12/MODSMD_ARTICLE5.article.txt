# CARNEGIE DOWNS GEORGETOWN AS IRISH BEAT ARMY

### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 11. (/p)â€”Through
the gloom and smoke of Pittsburgh's
steel mills, Carnegie Tech rose over
the battered form of Georgetown,
smothered and crushed from the sec
tional race by a 13 to 0 defeat. Only
Army's formidable host, listening to
night to "taps" on the West Point
Plains that sounded a knell to nation
al championship hopes and Boston
College's undefeated and untied war
riors, lifted heads to Par the Tartan
way.
On the Army recoid, however, was
the smirch of unexpected defeat,
rubbed in there Saturday by the
"Ramblers" of Notre Dame in a 12
to C upheaval of the very best brand
of pigskin "dope."
