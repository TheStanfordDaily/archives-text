# Audience Enjoys Devils, Action In Popular Comedy
## Helen Thompson, Tom Watt Put Spontaneity, Ardor In Leading Roles 
### Sylva Weaver 
Stanford playgoers received a
taste of Gordon Davis' mysterious
Cheese last Friday night when the
Sword and Sandals play "The Devil
in the Cheese" was presented in the
Assembly Hall. And the audience
found the Cheese, with its fantastical
components of little devils, spirited,
action, excellent characterizations,
and little touches of beauty, much
to its liking.
"The Devil in the Cheese" proved
one of the most popular comedies
Stanford has seen for many a month.
Despite the unavoidable accidents
such as the final curtain's refusal to
function at the crucial moment, the
production was almost professional
in its finish.
Chief honors in the play go to the
heroic efforts of George Shibley as
Father Petros and Bertrand Heflin as
the Little God Min. While the audi
ence was quite unaware of the "play
within the play" transpiring on the
stage, Shibley was acting with a very
high temperature, and virtually col
lapsed after the performance. He
was returned to the hospital where
he had been during the day.
Heflin took over the part of the
Little God Min on Thursday after
noon at the last dress rehearsal when
Paul Speegle was too ill to go on. It
is surely to Hefiin's credit that he
carried the play along as lie did.
Histrionic honors go to Helen
Thompson and Torn Watt who played
their roles with spontaneity, under
standing, and ardor. Watt put a fiery
abandon into his role to which Gol
dina added a delightful youthful
charm, and the two practically swept
through the show.
Atwill as Joseph Quigley gave a
good consistent performance, and
Louise Buxton put such conviction
into her role that it will long stand
out in campus productions. A1 Leon
liardt was almost too much of a Poin
tell Jones, and Joseph Polverino and
Harold Conroy gave excellent per
formances.
Perhaps the most distinctive fea
ture of the play was the creative
quality of the sets by Harold llelven
ston. The first set was a thing of
beauty in itself with its purple
shadows and its heights. The ascent
to the Monastery was handled espe
cially well.
The red, white, and blue of the 1938
drawing room set was a symbolic
note in the modern impressionism of
the presidential scene. In the patri
otic ballyhoo sequence George Mau
ser and Arthur Hurt showed up ex
ceptionally well, be it here noted.
The light golden colors of the canni
bal scene were particularly effective.

ser and Arthur Hurt showed up ex
ceptionally well, be it here noted.
The light golden colors of the canni
bal scene were particularly effective.
Stanford playgoers received a
taste of Gordon Davis' mysterious
Cheese last Friday night when the
Sword and Sandals play "The Devil
in the Cheese" was presented in the
Assembly Hall. And the audience
found the Cheese, with its fantastical
components of little devils, spirited,
action, excellent characterizations,
and little touches of beauty, much
to its liking.
"The Devil in the Cheese" proved
one of the most popular comedies
Stanford has seen for many a month.
Despite the unavoidable accidents
such as the final curtain's refusal to
function at the crucial moment, the
production was almost professional
in its finish.
Chief honors in the play go to the
heroic efforts of George Shibley as
Father Petros and Bertrand Heflin as
the Little God Min. While the audi
ence was quite unaware of the "play
within the play" transpiring on the
stage, Shibley was acting with a very
high temperature, and virtually col
lapsed after the performance. He
was returned to the hospital where
he had been during the day.
Heflin took over the part of the
Little God Min on Thursday after
noon at the last dress rehearsal when
Paul Speegle was too ill to go on. It
is surely to Hefiin's credit that he
carried the play along as lie did.
Histrionic honors go to Helen
Thompson and Torn Watt who played
their roles with spontaneity, under
standing, and ardor. Watt put a fiery
abandon into his role to which Gol
dina added a delightful youthful
charm, and the two practically swept
through the show.
Atwill as Joseph Quigley gave a
good consistent performance, and
Louise Buxton put such conviction
into her role that it will long stand
out in campus productions. A1 Leon
liardt was almost too much of a Poin
tell Jones, and Joseph Polverino and
Harold Conroy gave excellent per
formances.
Perhaps the most distinctive fea
ture of the play was the creative
quality of the sets by Harold llelven
ston. The first set was a thing of
beauty in itself with its purple
shadows and its heights. The ascent
to the Monastery was handled espe
cially well.
The red, white, and blue of the 1938
drawing room set was a symbolic
note in the modern impressionism of
the presidential scene. In the patri
otic ballyhoo sequence George Mau
ser and Arthur Hurt showed up ex
ceptionally well, be it here noted.
