## 
### 
"Our epidemic of bad colds and in
iiuenza decreased considerably during
the week of November 5," stated Dr.
Thoams A. Storey, medical advisor,
yesterday. "Nevertheless new cases
will appear for some time, probably
in a series of diminishing epidemic
like waves. We will have a few cases
all through the winter."
According to Dr. Storey the wisest
thing to do in case of an attack is
to consult the student health service
physicians early for advice, or to go
to bed and send for the physician of
your choice. Health service for men
is available daily from 8 to 12 o'clock
in the morning and from 1 to 6 o'clock
in the afternoon, and on Saturday
and Sunday from 9 to 12 o'clock. For
women Dr. Mosher will be in her of
fice from 2 to 5 o'clock in the after
noon, except on Friday when she will
be there at 4 o'clock, and on Satur
day at 10 a.m. She can always be
reached at her home.
"The best treatment for influenza
is the hospital and rest," says Storey.
"It is equally important that one
take very good care of himself after
his fever is gone. For a couple of
weeks one should have plenty of
sleep, dress warmly, eat only the
food he knows he can easily digest,
avoid fatigue, and consult the Uni
versity medical advisors or go to his
private physician if he feels badly.
