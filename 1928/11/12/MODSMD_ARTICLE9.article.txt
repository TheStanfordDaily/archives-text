# FROSH SURPRISE BEAR CUBS TO TRIUMPH 7-6
## Rintala Makes Brilliant Run In Initial Quarter to Score Touchdown 
### 
Outfighting the more powerful Uni
versity of California freshman eleven,
Coach Husky Hunt's Cardinal fresh
man gridsters upset the dope bucket
and battled their way to a 7-6 victory
in the Memorial Stadium at Berkeley
Saturday in as exciting a football
game as has been played on the
Pacific Coast this year.
The Cards got away to a flying
start, scoring their 7 points in the
first three minutes of play. Stanford
received the kick-oil' and returned
the ball to its own 32-yard line. Rudy
Rintala, speedy left halfback and for
mer San Francisco high-school star,
was given the ball and made three
yards on a reverse, and on the next
play, an off-tackle reverse, broke
away and raced 65 yards to score
Stanford's lone touchdown. Ernest
Caddel with a beautiful bit of block
ing, took out the California safety
man who threatened to overtake Rin
tala.
George Grey, 192-pound tackle, con
verted the goal; and it was this single
point that proved to be the margin
of victory for the Cards.
California Scores
California penetrated to the Stan
ford 20-yard line three times before
the opening quarter was over, only
to be held for downs; and it was not
until the third quarter that a break —-
a blocked punt—gave the Bear Cubs
their touchdown. A California punt
rolled offside on the Stanford 7-yard
line, and Wilson dropped back of his
own goal line to kick out of danger.
His punt was blocked, the ball going
out of bounds on the Stanford 4-yard
