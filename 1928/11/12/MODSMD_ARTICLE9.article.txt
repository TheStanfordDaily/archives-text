# FROSH SURPRISE BEAR CUBS TO TRIUMPH 7-6
## Rintala Makes Brilliant Run In Initial Quarter to Score Touchdown 
### 
Outfighting the more powerful Uni
versity of California freshman eleven,
Coach Husky Hunt's Cardinal fresh
man gridsters upset the dope bucket
and battled their way to a 7-6 victory
in the Memorial Stadium at Berkeley
Saturday in as exciting a football
game as has been played on the
Pacific Coast this year.
The Cards got away to a flying
start, scoring their 7 points in the
first three minutes of play. Stanford
received the kick-oil' and returned
the ball to its own 32-yard line. Rudy
Rintala, speedy left halfback and for
mer San Francisco high-school star,
was given the ball and made three
yards on a reverse, and on the next
play, an off-tackle reverse, broke
away and raced 65 yards to score
Stanford's lone touchdown. Ernest
Caddel with a beautiful bit of block
ing, took out the California safety
man who threatened to overtake Rin
tala.
George Grey, 192-pound tackle, con
verted the goal; and it was this single
point that proved to be the margin
of victory for the Cards.
California Scores
California penetrated to the Stan
ford 20-yard line three times before
the opening quarter was over, only
to be held for downs; and it was not
until the third quarter that a break —-
a blocked punt—gave the Bear Cubs
their touchdown. A California punt
rolled offside on the Stanford 7-yard
line, and Wilson dropped back of his
own goal line to kick out of danger.
His punt was blocked, the ball going
out of bounds on the Stanford 4-yard
line. The Blue and Gold backs hit
the line on three successive plays, the
net result being a loss of two yards
for California. On the last down
Smith tossed the ball across the goal
line to Ike McCoy, California end,
who grappled it while standing within
a circle of Stanford men. Smith failed
to convert.
Bears Desperate
During the remainder of the game
the Bears made desperate but inef
fectual attempts to score, the weary
Stanford freshmen staving off re
peated attacks on their goal, and
then taking the ball themselves and
working it down the field into Cali
fornia territory. George Watkins,
California triple-threat halfback who
had been kept out of the game by in
juries, was sent in to pass; he threw
them all over the field, but so tight
was the Stanford secondary defense
that not a one was completed.
To name the heroes of this unex
pected Cardinal triumph would be to
give the starting lineup and then list
all of the substitutions. George Grey
and Captain Bill Doub at tackles,
Hunt and Ebey at guards, Milligan
at. center, and Toll and Colvin at
ends, all played great games. Toepke,
substitute guard, and Lyon, substi
tute tackle, showed up well.
In the backfield the play of Caddel,
fullback, and Rintala, halfback, was
outstanding. Caddel backed up the
line and carried the ball like a var
| .sity fullback. Rintala, with his bril
liant ball-carrying, constantly threat
ened to break away and score a sec
ond touchdown. Wilson's long punts
proved to be a deciding factor in the
Card victory, Stanford gaining from
10 to 20 yards on almost every ex
change of kicks. Marks, quarterback,
was an able field general.
The Bears rolled up seven first
downs through the line of scrimmage
to five for the Cards.

their touchdown. A California punt
rolled offside on the Stanford 7-yard
line, and Wilson dropped back of his

His punt was blocked, the ball going
out of bounds on the Stanford 4-yard
line. The Blue and Gold backs hit
the line on three successive plays, the
net result being a loss of two yards
for California. On the last down
Smith tossed the ball across the goal
line to Ike McCoy, California end,
who grappled it while standing within
a circle of Stanford men. Smith failed
to convert.
Bears Desperate
During the remainder of the game
the Bears made desperate but inef
fectual attempts to score, the weary
Stanford freshmen staving off re
peated attacks on their goal, and
then taking the ball themselves and
working it down the field into Cali
fornia territory. George Watkins,
California triple-threat halfback who
had been kept out of the game by in
juries, was sent in to pass; he threw
them all over the field, but so tight
was the Stanford secondary defense
that not a one was completed.
To name the heroes of this unex
pected Cardinal triumph would be to
give the starting lineup and then list
all of the substitutions. George Grey
and Captain Bill Doub at tackles,
Hunt and Ebey at guards, Milligan
at. center, and Toll and Colvin at
ends, all played great games. Toepke,
substitute guard, and Lyon, substi
tute tackle, showed up well.
In the backfield the play of Caddel,
fullback, and Rintala, halfback, was
outstanding. Caddel backed up the
line and carried the ball like a var
| .sity fullback. Rintala, with his bril
liant ball-carrying, constantly threat
ened to break away and score a sec
ond touchdown. Wilson's long punts
proved to be a deciding factor in the
Card victory, Stanford gaining from
10 to 20 yards on almost every ex
change of kicks. Marks, quarterback,
was an able field general.

Coach Husky Hunt's Cardinal fresh
man gridsters upset the dope bucket
and battled their way to a 7-6 victory
in the Memorial Stadium at Berkeley
Saturday in as exciting a football
game as has been played on the
Pacific Coast this year.
The Cards got away to a flying
start, scoring their 7 points in the
first three minutes of play. Stanford
received the kick-oil' and returned
the ball to its own 32-yard line. Rudy
Rintala, speedy left halfback and for
mer San Francisco high-school star,
was given the ball and made three
yards on a reverse, and on the next
play, an off-tackle reverse, broke
away and raced 65 yards to score
Stanford's lone touchdown. Ernest
Caddel with a beautiful bit of block
ing, took out the California safety
man who threatened to overtake Rin
tala.
George Grey, 192-pound tackle, con
verted the goal; and it was this single
point that proved to be the margin
of victory for the Cards.

at. center, and Toll and Colvin at
ends, all played great games. Toepke,
substitute guard, and Lyon, substi
tute tackle, showed up well.
In the backfield the play of Caddel,
fullback, and Rintala, halfback, was
outstanding. Caddel backed up the
line and carried the ball like a var
| .sity fullback. Rintala, with his bril
liant ball-carrying, constantly threat
ened to break away and score a sec
ond touchdown. Wilson's long punts
proved to be a deciding factor in the
Card victory, Stanford gaining from
10 to 20 yards on almost every ex
change of kicks. Marks, quarterback,
was an able field general.
The Bears rolled up seven first
downs through the line of scrimmage
to five for the Cards.

Outfighting the more powerful Uni
versity of California freshman eleven,
Coach Husky Hunt's Cardinal fresh
man gridsters upset the dope bucket
and battled their way to a 7-6 victory
in the Memorial Stadium at Berkeley
Saturday in as exciting a football
game as has been played on the
Pacific Coast this year.
The Cards got away to a flying
start, scoring their 7 points in the
first three minutes of play. Stanford
received the kick-oil' and returned
the ball to its own 32-yard line. Rudy
Rintala, speedy left halfback and for
mer San Francisco high-school star,
was given the ball and made three
yards on a reverse, and on the next
play, an off-tackle reverse, broke
away and raced 65 yards to score
Stanford's lone touchdown. Ernest
Caddel with a beautiful bit of block
ing, took out the California safety
man who threatened to overtake Rin
tala.
George Grey, 192-pound tackle, con
verted the goal; and it was this single
point that proved to be the margin
of victory for the Cards.
California Scores
California penetrated to the Stan
ford 20-yard line three times before
the opening quarter was over, only
to be held for downs; and it was not
until the third quarter that a break —-
a blocked punt—gave the Bear Cubs
their touchdown. A California punt
rolled offside on the Stanford 7-yard
line, and Wilson dropped back of his
own goal line to kick out of danger.
His punt was blocked, the ball going
out of bounds on the Stanford 4-yard
line. The Blue and Gold backs hit
the line on three successive plays, the
net result being a loss of two yards
for California. On the last down
Smith tossed the ball across the goal
line to Ike McCoy, California end,
who grappled it while standing within
a circle of Stanford men. Smith failed
to convert.
Bears Desperate
During the remainder of the game
the Bears made desperate but inef
fectual attempts to score, the weary
Stanford freshmen staving off re
peated attacks on their goal, and
then taking the ball themselves and
working it down the field into Cali
fornia territory. George Watkins,
California triple-threat halfback who
had been kept out of the game by in
juries, was sent in to pass; he threw
them all over the field, but so tight
was the Stanford secondary defense
that not a one was completed.
To name the heroes of this unex
pected Cardinal triumph would be to
give the starting lineup and then list
all of the substitutions. George Grey
and Captain Bill Doub at tackles,
Hunt and Ebey at guards, Milligan
at. center, and Toll and Colvin at
ends, all played great games. Toepke,
substitute guard, and Lyon, substi
tute tackle, showed up well.
In the backfield the play of Caddel,
fullback, and Rintala, halfback, was
outstanding. Caddel backed up the
line and carried the ball like a var
| .sity fullback. Rintala, with his bril
liant ball-carrying, constantly threat
ened to break away and score a sec
