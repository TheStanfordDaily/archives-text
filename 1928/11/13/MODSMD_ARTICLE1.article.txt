# VARSITY TAKES STIFF WORKOUT IN HEAVY RAIN
## Three Tough Games to Come Within Three Weeks; Try Offensive, Aerial Plays Washington Will Come Here Underdog Saturday; Bears Strong; Army East's Best 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
From all indications, it will take
more than rain to interfere with Stan
ford's preparations for the all-import
ant encounters with Washington,
California, and West Point.
Realizing that three weeks is none
too long a time to prepare for three
tough games, Pop Warner put his red
host through a strenuous workout yes
terday afternoon in spite of a heavy
downpour. Yesterday's session con
sisted almost entirely of practice in
offensive work, polishing up the re
verses and improving the aerial plays.
The Cardinals' schedule calls for
two of its most important games on
successive Saturdays. Immediately
following the Big Uame the team will
board (rain for New York where the
clash with the United States Military
Academy will take place. Arriving at
their destination on the following
Wednesday, they will have only
Thursday and Friday for workouts be
fore the climaxing game of the sea
son. That means that they will have
to prepare for the Bears, Huskies,
and Cadets practically in twelve days.
Washington Underdog
Washington will come here Satur
day as the underdog, having lost to
California, Oregon, Montana, and
Oregon State, but gives promise of
staging a real battle with Stanford.
The Huskies have gone through a
rather inconsistent season. They
started strong, weakened in midsea
sou, and finally built up strength
enough to hold the Berkeley Bears
to one touchdown last Saturday.
California's strength is apparent.
The Gold and Blue's goal has been
crossed by only one opponent, the
Olympic Club, in its seven games to
date. The Bears have an easy contest
for Saturday with Nevada.
Army Game Crucial
The Cardinals will be making their
first appearance away from the Pa
cific Coast when they meet the
Cadets in New York. That is only one
of the many reasons that Stanford
will want to be at its best for the
game which will be one of nation
wide interest. Because the Soldiers
arc Eastern champions this year, the
contest will be an intersectional af
fair of importance. If Stanford wins
the Big Game, national football hon
ors will have to be shared by Army,
Notre Dame, Southern California, and
Stanfordâ€”until after the Card-Cadet
and the Trojan-Irish engagements on
December 1.
