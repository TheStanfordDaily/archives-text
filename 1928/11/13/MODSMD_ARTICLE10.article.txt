# FATE OF 350 IN BALANCE AFTER SHIP GOES DOWN
## Rescuers Find No Trace of Refugees of 'Vestris'; Believed Adrift 
### Associated Press 
The fate of 350 men, women, and
children, refugees from the strangely
stricken Lamport & Holt liner Vestris
was in doubt as this edition went to
press.
No trace of the passengers and
crew was found when the first of
several rescue ships arrived at the
point, 300 miles off the Virginia coast
where the Vestris careened suddenly
yesterday and sank.
Earlier messages had told of the
ship's personnel taking to the boats
and officials of the line in New York
expressed the conviction that these
boats at once had headed for the
nearest shore. As several hours had
elapsed between the abandonment of
the Vestris and the arrival of the
first reporting rescue craft, it was
held at the Line headquarters that
the boats might well have been a
score of miles away, despite squally
weather.
Another fact operating to discount
anxiety was the proximity of the
Japanese ship Ohio Maru, reported
"alongside" the Vestris before the
latter foundered. Transfer of person
nel to the Ohio Maru, either from the
sinking ship or after they had taken
to the boats, was seen as a logical ex
planation of "no trace found" reports
from later arriving ships.
The nearest of the craft to go to
the rescue was the coast guard cutter
Davis. It reported that it ought to
reach the Vestris a'oout 5 o'clock this
afternoon but reports from other
ships in the general vicinity indicated
that the force of the waves might
delay its arrival to a considerable
extent.
The Vestris was built for the
South American trade in 1912 at Bel
fast. For 16 years she stayed in ser
vice with only one small fire to mar
her record and that was extinguished
without serious damage and with no
injury on board.
