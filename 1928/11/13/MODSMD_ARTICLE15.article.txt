NEW YORK, Nov. 12. (/P) â€” The
agreement to disagree between Army
and Navy has made some juicy foot
ball plums for other institutions, no
tably members of the Western Con
ference.
Navy's schedule for next season
just announced in part calls for the
Midshipmen to go to Columbus to
play Ohio State with the Buckeyes
returning the call in 1930. Navy and
Notre Dame will play October 12, the
Naval Academy schedule being round
ed out with Eastern teams, three of
the "Big Shots" being Princeton,
Pennsylvania, and Georgetown. The
first two are on this year's cards, but
the Hilltoppers from Washington are
newcomers.
