TONOPAH, Nev., Nov. 12.
ter Scott, eccentric millionaire of the
Nevada desert country who is better
known to the world as "Death Valley
Scotty," has purchased a 75-mile tele
phone line.
He found that the job of supplying
fresh provisions for the 40 artisans
and laborers who are working on his
?1,000,000 desert home was too diffi
cult without some means of communi
cation. The nearest market is Gold
field, Nev., and it is to this town that
the new line will run.
