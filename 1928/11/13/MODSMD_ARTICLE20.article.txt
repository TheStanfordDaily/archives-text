# PLANTATION SET TO BE THEME OF BRANNER DANCE
## 
### 
Planning to give the most elabor
ate informal dance ever attempted on
the Stanford campus, members of
Branner Club are busy preparing for
their first dance of the quarter to be
given Friday, the night before the
Stanford-Washington game.
The dance floor has already been
remodelled to resemble an old South
ern plantation and extensive lighting
equipment has been installed which
promises to produce some unique
lighting effects.
One of the outstanding features of
the dance is the fact that an entire
negro personnel has been employedâ€”
negro orchestra, negro ticket-taker,
and a negro punch-server.
The decorations have been care
fully selected and, although the com
mittee is keeping the programs a
secret, they promise that they are
not only very ornamental but also
useful.
Tickets for the dance, which is to
last until 1 o'clock, can still be ob
tained from Harry Schoolfield, Ware
ham Seaman, or Adelbert Culling.
