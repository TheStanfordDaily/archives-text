journey the inspection of the Panama
Canal. Beyond the brief stop that will
be made there, the itinerary of of the
president-elect has not been an
nounced, but he desires to visit all
(he republics on the western coast
ot South America.
The news was received today that
Henry P. Fletcher, ambassador to
Rome, would represent the state de
partment on the trip. Besides the
ambassador, other members of the
personal party of the president-elect,
who definitely have been informed
that they will make the trip, are his
son, Allan, and his personal secretary,
George Akerson.
The battleship Maryland, one of the
newest and largest of American war
craft, will be boarded at the port for

Many applications have been re
ceived from Spanish linguists who
are anxious to serve as interpreters
on the journey. Although Mr. Hoover
does not speak Spanish, Ambassador
Fletcher is an adept in the language.
The president-elect spent most of
today quietly in his home, working at
many of the details which necessarily
must be cleared away before he
leaves for the voyage. A steady rain,
the second of the season, kept him
indoors the greater part of the day.
