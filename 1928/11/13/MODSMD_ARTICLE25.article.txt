# CROSS COUNTRY RACE MAY BRING TALENT TO LIGHT
## 
### 
Considerable hidden track talent is
expected to be brought to light Sat
urday afternoon when the time
keeper's gun announces the start of
the 1928 intramural cross country
race, which will begin and end in the
Stanford Stadium and will cover a
distance of three and one-half miles.
Charles Davis, director of intra
mural sports, urges all freshmen who
think that they have any running
ability at all to enter the race, as
nearly every year new varsity ma
terial is discovered among the win
ners. Names of contestants should be
in by tomorrow.
A trophy will be awarded to the
team finishing first, and medals will
be awarded to the men finishing in
the first five places. All teams having
three men finish will be awarded five
points in intramural scoring, and the
five leading teams will score addi
tional place points.
