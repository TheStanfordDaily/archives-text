# EXPERTS DIRECT WORK TO CONTROL OIL FIRE
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 12.
perts were today directing the slow
and tediou√ü process of laying their
lines of attack on the subterranean
fed gas jet which burst into flame at
the Santa Fe Springs field early Fri
day, and has been sending up a hun
dred-foot pillar of fire ever since.
While the plan to snuff out the
blaze with a charge of dynamite was
| being strongly considered as the
J quickest method of procedure, engi
neers pointed out today that the task
of capping the well would remain a
serious problem, since the gas is com
ing to the surface under a tremen
j dous force.
