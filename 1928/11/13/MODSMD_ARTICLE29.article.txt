# How To Get A Garage For Your Car
## 
### 
Unsatisfied with reading mere hortatory editorials on the subject,
Joseph Gordon, a Daily rei>orter, has gone to work on the project out
lined in this column last week for the building of sufficient garages 011
the campus to shelter student automobiles. Gordon having initiated the
movement, the Daily will take it up and conduct a fact-gathering cam
paign to discover whether there are enough car-owners who would be
willing to pay $5 per month rent so that the University might underwrite
the garage-building costs.
Our preliminary survey shows that the fraternities have 325 cars in
their front and back yardsâ€”l 4.2 cars per fraternity. Dormitory men
own probably a like number; while the sorority and Roble women will
be found to have a substantial number of cars.
It is raining as this is written; from countless automobiles water is
streaming, giving place to rust. Weathering takes a fearful toll each year
because the shiny and the dull, the eight-cylindered and the four-cylin
dered have to stand out in the roads, uncovered. If the owners of these
cars would but realize that all they need to do to start the University 011
a program of garage building is to make promises to pay the nominal
rent, we would be well on our way to a solution of a difficulty that must
be solved.
Let every automobile owner give thought as to whether or not he
would welcome garage facilities near him 011 the campus; in a short time
the Daily will attempt to gather in sufficient promises to support the
project; and then the University may draw up its plans and start building.
