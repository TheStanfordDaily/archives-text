Reports from time to time filter back to the campus that those who
have taken out leaves this quarter have been deprived by the Board of
Athletic Control of their right to get Big Game tickets. Since this action
has met with no little complaint from the parties holding the sack, the
Daily will attempt to explain the reasons for the ticket department's
action.
When a student takes out a leave the Board argues that he is no longer
a student. lie is theoretically entitled to get Big Game tickets through
the alumni classification, provided he pays his alumni dues. Of course,
that procedure is not actually open to him during fall quarter, because all
of the alumni tickets have been applied for long before fall quarter com
mences.
So the leave-taking student is out of luck. Naturally he is angry.
The Board, you see, awards to the waiting alumnus the tickets which he
forfeited. The latter has had his application in for a month and a half
and is faced with the likelihood of being one of the 4.000 who will get
no Big Game seats whatever. The student has but newly made himself
a technical alumnus. To whom should the ownerless tickets go? To the
alumnus, says the Board, incurring yowls from the student body. But
if it gives the ducats to the student who is on leave, the alumnus yowls.
And since it seems that alumni can out-yowl students, the alumni, in this
case at least, get the seats.
At that Stanford students are much better treated than University
of California students, who get nothing but rooters' seats for the game.
