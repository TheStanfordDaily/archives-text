# The 						Prophet of Inspirational Journalism
## 
### 
Dr. Frank Crane, the writer, died last week in Nice. Author of the
daily "messages" which for many years have provided cheer and uplift
for the millions who like their philosophy in inspirational doses, Dr. Crane
was the object of incessant lampooning by the green and mauve maga
zines. Inasmuch as Dr. Crane was read in eighteen countries by 5,000,-
000 daily readers, it would appear that the Menckens were unsuccessful
in their campaigns to loosen his hold on hoi polloi.
There is a lot of inspirational journalism now at large in the country,
and Dr. Crane is one of the reasons for it. The prototype was an apostle
of uprightness of living, sincerity of thinking and "sweet reasonableness."
Most of the imitators have been guilty of saccharine unreasonableness.
But just to prove that Dr. Crane died not entirely in vain, we append
the following editorial from the U.S.C. Daily Trojan :
SPIRIT
A ship was plowing its way through the mighty Atlantic Ocean.
It was rolled and tossed about by a ground swell, but the ship never
slackened speed. It fought its way through the night and day in
order to reach its destination. A mighty powerâ€”more powerful
than the strongest of storms.
Man is like the ship. He has his motors that are made of knowl
edge, that continually fight for the survival of their ship. A few
men are able to withstand the worst of storms; most men just run
with the current. But The Man does have the power of his convic
tions and he is able to withstand the strongest of currents. For the
man that is a firm believer in his convictions is the one that "plows
through" the strongest current and lie is the one that finally reaches
his ultimate goal.
After all, this life is a subordination of values as we know them.
Happiness is the goal for which we are continually seeking. The
real Man and the real Woman are going to reach this goal, if neces
sary, at the cost of their lives, for they are sincere believers in the
doctrine of Theodore Roosevelt when he said, "Fight as long as you
are certain that fight is justifiable."
