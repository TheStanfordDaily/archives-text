WANTED: A DOCTOR
Palo Alto, along with most cities,
13 now suffering from the indiscre
tions of youth. Like Topsy, Palo Alto
"just growed," and during its infancy
those who laid out its streets did not
realize to what extent automobile
traffic would some day be a problem.
The sins of the early City Fathers
are being visited upon the present
generation. There are many unsatis
factory features to the local traffic
situation, and although the fact that
Palo Alto is primarily a residence
town assures us that traffic will not
become so acute a problem as it is
elsewhere, nevertheless many im
provements will be necessary.
To illustrate, let us cite a few ills:
Congestion on University avenue has
increased considerably of late. Per
haps the parking system needs chang
ing, and perhaps parking should be
prohibited altogether on the business
section of this street. Frequent tieups
of traffic at the railroad Intersection
on this same street have become a
nuisance. There has been a tendency

lately toward too generous installa
tion of "Arterial Stop" signs, whose
principal result in some cases has
been traffic congestion. In the resi
dential district, many intersections
are almost totally "blind" by reason
of hedges around adjacent lots. This
menace will probably necessitate the
sacrifice of beauty for motoring
safety.
Palo Alto's traffic problem includes
numerous other features which we
shall not here enumerate. We do not
presume to suggest cures for these
difficulties. That must be the task of
an experienced and scientific traffic
doctor.
We do, however, wish to say that
this city could well afford to employ
an expert to solve its traffic puzzles,
present and future. It might require a
year for such a man to complete the
task, and his help might cost the City
of Palo Alto ten thousand dollars or,
so; but there is no doubt that the
expenditure would be amply repaid
by future dividends of comfort and
security. —Winston Norman.
