The Joyous Pretender. By Louise
Ayres Garnett. (Macmillan Com
pany New York. 1928.)
"The Joyous Pretender" is the stor;
of life as seen through the eyes of a
ten-year-old child. The artistry with
which Miss Garnett sets forth the im
pressions and thoughts of this child
makes each character in the book,
whether important or casual, stand
out with a' fine and beautiful clarity.
The theme of the book is based on
one of the oldest plots in the world
—that of a ruined girl redeemed
through the love of a good man. Yet
the author applies such extraordinar
ily original and distinctive treatment
to her situations, that the reader
leels as though he were exploring un
discovered country.
A book of this sort will always have
but a limited field of readers. If you
believe with Christopher, the woman,
that "a real question must never be
answered," then you will like the
book immensely. But most of us, with
our prosaic common sense, don't want
a question asked unless it can be
answered. This does not mean that
only those who lack common sense
will appreciate the book. Many of the
most matter-of-fact readers will hail
the story as a real find, seeing in it a
welcome relief from the monotonous
truths of real life.
The Joyous Pretender gives an ef
fect of delicate fancifulness due
largely to the poetic quality of its
style. The book has so many patterns
of lovely imagery, that in passages
it is almost a prose poem.
Of course throughout the book the
precocious little boy who tells the
story never fails to appear on the
scene at the opportune time. The
skeptical reader will find this miracu
lous propensity of his somewhat of
a flaw. But the book was not written
for skeptics. ■—M. R. L.
Headlines. By Mildred Gilman. (New

York: Horace Liveright. 1928.)
Presented as the real stories behind
the blatant headlines of sensational
journalism, we find here some excel
lent tales of life in a poor community
on Staten Island. With the ability of
careful observation, the writer re
creates the fights and struggles, the
amusements and dire extremities of
now officially American Irish, Ital
ians, Scandinavians, and Germans.
There is a headline as a title for
each story in the best of tabloid
fashion: "Wife Beater Gets Stiff
Term," "Says He Is Not Tot's Father,"
"Rum Raid Nets Six," and so on.
Then follows a brief italicized synop
sis of the way the story would be
written up in the average tabloid.
After that comes a story from real
life as the human beings actually live
it, plain, unvarnished, and true.
Mary Pollock, the central character
of the book, living with helpful un
obtrusiveness among these people on
Staten Island, reads the sensational
stories in the papers and shudders.
She feels thankful that she lives a
sheltered life, away from such ter
rible happenings, never realizing that
she is in the very center of equally
stirring events all the time.
The moral need not be labored fur
ther. If Mary can't see that the death
of the Salvatore baby next door is
even more tragic than the story she
read in the papers about the death of
the millionaire's child, that's her af
fair. The wise reader of this book
will, after one or two experiments,
disregard Mary's newspaper reading
and proceed to enjoy the stories that
follow. For similar headlines could be
placed at the beginning of any good
contemporary short story, proving
just as much —and just as little,
It is the Btories themselves that
count, and these are good. Enjoy
them, but forget about the headlines
and Mary's avid tabloid reading.

Headlines. By Mildred Gilman. (New

York: Horace Liveright. 1928.)
Presented as the real stories behind
the blatant headlines of sensational
journalism, we find here some excel
lent tales of life in a poor community
on Staten Island. With the ability of
careful observation, the writer re
creates the fights and struggles, the
amusements and dire extremities of
now officially American Irish, Ital
ians, Scandinavians, and Germans.
There is a headline as a title for
each story in the best of tabloid
fashion: "Wife Beater Gets Stiff
Term," "Says He Is Not Tot's Father,"
"Rum Raid Nets Six," and so on.
Then follows a brief italicized synop
sis of the way the story would be
written up in the average tabloid.
After that comes a story from real
life as the human beings actually live
it, plain, unvarnished, and true.
Mary Pollock, the central character
of the book, living with helpful un
obtrusiveness among these people on
Staten Island, reads the sensational
stories in the papers and shudders.
She feels thankful that she lives a
sheltered life, away from such ter
rible happenings, never realizing that
she is in the very center of equally
stirring events all the time.
The moral need not be labored fur
ther. If Mary can't see that the death
of the Salvatore baby next door is
even more tragic than the story she
read in the papers about the death of
the millionaire's child, that's her af
fair. The wise reader of this book
will, after one or two experiments,
disregard Mary's newspaper reading
and proceed to enjoy the stories that
follow. For similar headlines could be
placed at the beginning of any good
contemporary short story, proving
just as much —and just as little,
It is the Btories themselves that
count, and these are good. Enjoy
them, but forget about the headlines
and Mary's avid tabloid reading.
The Joyous Pretender. By Louise
Ayres Garnett. (Macmillan Com
pany New York. 1928.)
"The Joyous Pretender" is the stor;
of life as seen through the eyes of a
ten-year-old child. The artistry with
which Miss Garnett sets forth the im
pressions and thoughts of this child
makes each character in the book,
whether important or casual, stand
out with a' fine and beautiful clarity.
The theme of the book is based on
one of the oldest plots in the world
—that of a ruined girl redeemed
through the love of a good man. Yet
the author applies such extraordinar
ily original and distinctive treatment
to her situations, that the reader
leels as though he were exploring un
discovered country.
A book of this sort will always have
but a limited field of readers. If you
believe with Christopher, the woman,
that "a real question must never be
answered," then you will like the
book immensely. But most of us, with
our prosaic common sense, don't want
a question asked unless it can be
answered. This does not mean that
only those who lack common sense
will appreciate the book. Many of the
most matter-of-fact readers will hail
the story as a real find, seeing in it a
welcome relief from the monotonous
truths of real life.
The Joyous Pretender gives an ef
fect of delicate fancifulness due
largely to the poetic quality of its
style. The book has so many patterns
of lovely imagery, that in passages
it is almost a prose poem.
Of course throughout the book the
precocious little boy who tells the
story never fails to appear on the
scene at the opportune time. The
skeptical reader will find this miracu
lous propensity of his somewhat of
a flaw. But the book was not written
