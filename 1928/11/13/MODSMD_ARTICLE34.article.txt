November 12th —
This morning my alarm clock did
not ring, and so forth to my eight
o'clock at a late hour, and into class
and my seat over a large row of
knees and legs, which did embarrass
and abash me, for though I believe
a young girl should be the center of
attraction, am not in favor of being
the center of attention. And not hav
ing had any breakfast, did hie me to
the Cellar at ten, and order toast and
chocolate, which had run out, it
seems, so contented myself with cof
fee and snails, both of which came
in cans I'm afraid, and so were on
hand.

To the rest of my classes dutifully,
inasmuch as midquarters are hard
upon me, and I feel it is a fine thing
to establish one's identity in the eyes
of one's professors, if only by mak
ing one's presence felt. Cannot abide
this practice known as "apple-polish
ing," but still do not think that one
should avoid one's faculty acquain
tances, for they are human as well
as academic.

Home at noon, praying that the
engineering students of this Univer
sity will be turned loose upon the
gutter problem about the Quad, when
they are finished with surveying the
fields of the campus. For am of the
opinion that only a Gertrude Ederle
could negotiate the crossing from the
Geology corner to the road with
ease. I do not mind very much when
passing cars splash me, for if I were
not. a pedestrian, I should most likely
do likewise, but does infuriate me to

have to wade through three feet of
water before I gain the highway.

And so a quiet afternoon, in which
I did cogitate on how I am going to
make two pairs of shoes go the dis
tance four would be worn out in the
attempt. Do wish desperately I could
ask Mr. Hoover to bring back some
snake skins for me from Soutl;'
America, where they are very inex
pensive, and with a whole battleship
at his disposal they could be stowed
without trouble. And then I might
have some spring shoes for Easter,
for if this process of wear and tear
continue as at the present rate, I
shall be barefoot by Christmas. And
also, considering the types of chairs
iu the classroom, I can understand
why the stockingless fad of last year
had such exponents on this campus.
