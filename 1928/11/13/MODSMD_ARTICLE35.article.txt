We haven't told any anecdotes yet
in this columns. This explains our
popularity. Today, however, we just
haven't got time to fool around with
youse readers, and besides we are
imbued with the spirit of a certain
well-known humorist. We have al
ways admired the man who could
make a novel out of a two-line joke.
Therefore:
An Anecdote—After Irvin S. Cobb
A certain Kentucky Colanel, whose
name we will not mention, because
in jokes it adds an effect of sup
pressed personality to call the person
of the story Mr. Blank, was a great
chicken fancier. Rivaling the Kunnel
as a fancier of poultry were the col
ored brethren of the vicinity. And so
It was both a wine and expedient
measure when the Kunnel purchased
a sawod-off shotgun to use upon, or
at least to threaten, prowlers, whose

color was usually such that it was
difficult to distinguish tlieni from the
night about them.
One very dark night as the Kunnel
had just retired he heard .1 slight
noise in the vicinity of the h<;n-house,
a popular place for slight noises, eare
cially at night, for as it has been said,
whose fondness for their feathered
the neighborhood was extensively |
populated with gentlemen of color,
friends is well-known.
"Ah ha," said the Kunnel, suspect
ing at once the true state of affairs,
: for he was a shrewd judge of both
I man and beast, was this Kentuckian
.oi a generation we now only seem to
I know as a memory. "Ah ha."

Donning a few articles of clothing,
and making sure that his trusty wea
pon, mentioned before in the story,
you may remember, was well-lilled 01
loaded, as you prefer to the use o
the words, he sallied forth into the
rear of the mansion—a large, white,
rumbling house, with massive colon itl
I illars, in his bedroom slippers.
George Washington Jones (the
I name is traditional, isn't it?), the col
! ored gentleman whose presence, or
I if not his own presence at least the
presence of one of his tribe, the Kun
nel suspected and was investigating,
heard the approach of the old gentle
man. Fearing capture he quickly
ducked within the hen-house itself,

and took refuge among the roosts,
! along with countless pieces of poultry
; ure of the Kunnel blocked the door
i tiesh. Soon the dark and ominous lig
way.
"Who's there?!" he commanded.
The silence was suggestive. "WHO'S
THKRE?" the Kunnel shouted. "Come
I now, or I'll SHOOT!"
This was too much. From the dark
ness came a quavering voice: "Foil
de Lawd, boss, they ain't nobody heah
'ceptin' jus' us chickins."

An Anecdote—After Irvin S. Cobb
A certain Kentucky Colanel, whose
name we will not mention, because
in jokes it adds an effect of sup
pressed personality to call the person
of the story Mr. Blank, was a great
chicken fancier. Rivaling the Kunnel
as a fancier of poultry were the col
ored brethren of the vicinity. And so
It was both a wine and expedient
measure when the Kunnel purchased
a sawod-off shotgun to use upon, or
at least to threaten, prowlers, whose

color was usually such that it was
difficult to distinguish tlieni from the
night about them.
One very dark night as the Kunnel
had just retired he heard .1 slight
noise in the vicinity of the h<;n-house,
a popular place for slight noises, eare
cially at night, for as it has been said,
whose fondness for their feathered
the neighborhood was extensively |
populated with gentlemen of color,
friends is well-known.
