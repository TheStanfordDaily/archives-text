# FARMER-LABOR PARTY MAY BE REORGANIZED
## 
### 
SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Nov. 12. (/P)â€”
Reorganization of the National Farm
er-Labor Party was under considera
tion here today, although some of the
100 delegates expected to attend the
convention were absent because of
poor highways in various states.
Intensive organization in the rural
districts of the South, particularly in
Texas, is planned. Charles A. Shirley,
of Illinois, said instructions have
gone out to organizers of the party
to go into the Lone Star State imme
diately and begin a vigorous drive
for membership.
Free infirmary care for one week
is offered at the University of Wash
ington.
