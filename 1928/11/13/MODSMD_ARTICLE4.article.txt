WASHINGTON, Nov. 12. (/P)—On
the heels of President Coolidge's
declaration that this country needs
additional cruisers, the Navy today
made public a re-statement of its
policy to maintain a United States
naval fleet second to none in the
world.
The policy has been revised in
many details for the first time since
the Washington Arms Conference in
1023. Secretary Wilbur asserted that
the revision was only with respect to
the elimination of obsolete projects
and the expansion of the aviation
branch of the service.
"The fundamental naval policy of
the United States," the General Board
of the Navy states in making public
the policy, "is that its navy should be
maintained in sufficient strength to
support United States policies and
commerce, and to guard its continent
al and overseas possessions."
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12.
ate leaders are prepared to seek pass
age at the approaching short session
of the $274,000,000 cruiser bill.
The bill already is on the Senate
calendar of busines, having been re
ported out by the Naval Committee.
The bill would call for 15 new cruisers
and an aircraft carrier to be built
during a period of three years.
