# SIX COLLEGES WILL SEND DELEGATES TO THIRD MEET
## 
### 
Six Pacific Coast colleges are com
pleting their delegation lists for the
third annual Student Institute of
Pacific Relations, which will convene
during the Thanksgiving holidays at
the Montezuma Mountain School near
Los Gatos. Stanford, University of
California, San Jose State Teachers
College, Pacific School of Religion,
College of the Pacific, and Mills Col
lege will be represented.

Campus organizations which are
sponsoring the Institute at Stanford
and which are sending official dele
gates are the Stanford Fellowship,
Y.W.C.A., Y.M.C.A., Cosmopolitan
Club, and International Relations
Club. Both A.W.S. and A.S.S.U. will
be two or three delegates from each
of the following national groups:
British, Chinese, Filipino, Indian,
Japanese, Korean, and Russian.

Membership Open

Practically all of the American
delegates have already been selected
by their respective organizations, but
since there will be room for a few
unofficial delegates from each college
anyone who is especially interested in
attending the Institute can secure an
application for membership from the
General Secretary, Barbara Dewlaney,
Box 1039, Stanford.

This year the theme for the section
and plenary discussions is "Social
Problems and Public Opinion in the
Pacific Area." By bringing together
students whose study or national
background has given them an active
and intelligent interest in Pacific
problems, the Institute will attempt
to mold from the discussions a defi
nite focus of student opinion on the
economic, intre-racial, and cultural
phases of the problem; in thus defin
ing the attitude of student leaders on
the Pacific Coast the Institute hopes
to aid in creating international under
standing and goodwill.

Students Big Influence

By grasping the significance of pub
lic opinion in its effect on oriental
pioblems, the sponsors of the Insti
tute feel that students will be some
what better able to influence the
United States toward fuller sympathy
with the East.
The Student Institute itself is
modelled after the Institute of Paciflc
Relations which meets annually at
Honolulu and of which President Wil
bur is chairman. It was established
in 1926 in response to demands for a
meeting of college men and women
who realized the importance of un
derstanding the Orient. So well-re
ceived was the first Institute that the
delegates unanimously agreed to
make it an annual affair. This year's
conference wlil be the third and
largest.

An elevator in a four-story hall,
which carries only women and takes
no passengers at all on the downward
trip, has been installed at Ohio Wes
