## 
### 
SPOKANE, Nov. 12. (/P) —A subdued
crew of Galloping Gaels from St.
Mary's limped off the field here today
after a snarling pack of Gonzaga Bull
dogs had outfoxed, outpassed, and
outgalloped them for a 20 to 7 vic
tory in the Bulldogs' homecoming
contest.
Within five minutes after the game
opened, the Bulldogs had pushed the
ball within passing distance and Ralls
passed to McGowan for the score.
Taken wholly unawares, for this
score, the Gaels unleashed a terrific
driving attack that carried them 80
yards for four first downs. Then Mer
rick passed to Frankian who loped
over the line and Murphy converted
to give St. Mary's its only score of
the game.
By the time St. Mary's had scored,
Clip Smith had almost wholly reor
ganized his team, and when the Gaels
marched 72 yards toward another
score, the Bulldog defense was work
ing and St. Mary's was forced to
pass into the end zone. From then
on Gonzaga had things its own way.
