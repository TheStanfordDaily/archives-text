that no candidate in last week's elec
tion received a majority of the .votes
cast.
The two candidates for each office
receiving the highest number of votes
last week will be voted on today. Men
will vote near the Law steps and wo
men in front of the Classical Litera
ture building as before:
Candidates in today's election are:
Carol Toll and Russell Smith for
president, Betts Hawkins and Sandy
Leib for vice-president, Rembert Thig
pen and Jean McCoy for secretary,
and James Kelly and Quentin Wood
for treasurer.
Freshmen were cautioned after the
last election by members of the Elec
tion Board to take particular care in
casting their ballots. More than ten
per cent of the votes cast in the last
election had to be thrown out because
of illegal procedure.
