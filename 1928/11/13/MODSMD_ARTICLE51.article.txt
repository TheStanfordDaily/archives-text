OREGON - STATE COLLEGE, Cor- ,
vallis, Nov. 11. (P.I.P.) —Oregon State ■
siudeutß will now indulge in Sunday
movies by virtue of the success of
a question voted on by townsfolk and
students in the recent elections. De
nied this luxury in the past three
elections, students and those among i
the townspeople who were for the
question turned out en masse to pass
it by a 2 to 1 majority, but with little
dispute or severance of relations be
tween students, churches, and town
folk against it, a condition that char
acterized the placing on the ballot of
a similar question in other college !
towns.
