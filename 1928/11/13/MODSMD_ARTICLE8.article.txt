# COOLIDGE'S ARMISTICE TALK INTERPRETED BY G.H. STUART
## Administration Policy Told; Reduction of Foreign Debts Impossible 
### Associated Press 
I "Coolidge's Armistice address is of
vital importance," said Graham H.
Stuart, professor of Political Science,
in his International Relations class
yesterday. "The policy of the ad
ministration as revealed in it is that
there will be no scaling down of for
eign debts until European states stop
increasing their armaments."
Coolidge emphasized our need for
more cruisers, pointing out that
"Great Britain, when she has carried
out her present program, will have
68 cruisers and the United States
40" Concerning this statement Pro
lessor Stuart said that the United
States requires ships of large tonnage
because of its few fuel stations, and
ships of this type were the ones lim
ited at the Washington Conference.
Kellogg Treaties Discussed
When speaking of the Kellogg
treaties for the outlawry of war, Pro
fessor Stuart said: "What is the sen
ate going to do? I am a little afraid
that when these treaties, which have
been signed by about 55 nations,
come up before the senate, there will
be a little reservation about the Mon
roe Doctrine acted. This will mean
the defeat of the purpose of the trea
ties, for then they will be open to the
reservations of all countries.
"The Latin-American countries are
the only ones that*Tiave been suspi
cious of the Kellogg treaties, and
Brazil, Argentina, and Chile have re
fused to sign it," continued Stuart.
"Coolidge's address shows Europe
that we are a bit suspicious of her,
and it indicates that we should
strengthen our bonds with Latin-
America."
Hoover Voyage
This statement brought forth the
question of the reason and import
ance of Hoover's "good-will" trip to
Scuth America. "I think the tour is a
very good move, if for no other rea
son than a good vacation," said
said Stuart. "It is very wise for the
president-elect to get first-hand infor
mation on the feeling of the South
Americans toward us, and to take to
them the feeling of the United States."
Giving reasons for the advisability
of the tour at the present time,
Stuart spoke of the conference be
tween Pan-American countries to be
held in Washington, D.C., this Decem
ber. An attempt will be made at this
time to establish the outlawry of war
in the western hemisphere; interven
tion will probably be the main ques
tion as it was at the Havana confer
ence last year, is Stuart's opinion.
