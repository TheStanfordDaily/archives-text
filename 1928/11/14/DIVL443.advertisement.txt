WKTWKT
and the "Flu"
I
'X*HE rainy season is here. A soggy
campus—wet feet—that is the way colds
and "flu" start.
You can have dry, comfortable,
smartly-clad feet in any storm with a
pair of dressy galoshes from Zwierlein's.
We have a wide selection of U S. Rubber
Co. rubberized tweeds, alligator, and
other patterns—blacks, tans, and greys.
Some with snaps, some with "zippers,"
some with buckles.
These are bargains in health-insur
ance and smartness.
Priced at $2.75 to $5.00

Clothes that disinherit
your imagination—
They leave nothing to it.
While you are trying them on
in front of our mirrors, your
mind isn't jumping from pil
lar to post.
Something tells you that you
have reached the ultimate in
style—the last word in fab
ric and the zenith in value.
Without one syllable of sales
manship from us — you 11
want what you see — and
wisely so.
It's only a matter of coming
within a radius of then
charms.
