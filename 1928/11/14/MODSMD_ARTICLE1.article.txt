# HUSKIES OUT TO AVENGE EARLIER SEASON DEFEATS
## Bagshaw Plans to Open Up Bag of Tricks in Attempt To Improve Team's Rating Rain Fails to Bother Pop as He Hands Varsity Players Gruelling Practice Session 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
It will be a revitalized pack of
"Washington Huskies that Coach
linoch Bagshaw will bring with him
Saturday for the encounter with the
Stanford Cardinals.
The Northerners, after a disastrous
seasonal start in which they lost to
both Oregon and Oregon State by de
cisive scores, unexpectedly have de
veloped into a powerful outfit that
has grown stronger as the season pro
gressed. They staged a surprise last
week in Seattle when they held Nibs
Price's Californians to one touchdown
and, according to reports, outplayed
the Bears in spite of the six-point
margin.
Plan to Fight
Spurred by a desire to offset their
three Conference reverses, the Hus
kies can be relied upon to put up
their greatest fight of the season
•against Stanford whom they usually
point for. Bagshaw can be expected
to direct his men to "open up" their
bag of offensive plays. The Washing
ton coach has been severely criticized
in the North this fall and realizes
that he will have to go some to hold
liis position as the Huskies' mentor.
On the local practice field a work
out was held in a downpour again
yesterday. Pop Warner is working
the Cards hard this week to get them
into the best shape for the three im
portant grid contests on the next
three Saturdays.
Heinecke to Start
Walt Heinecke, who received an
injury to his shoulder in the Santa
Clara fray, is expected to be able to
take his usual place at center in the
starting lineup. Tiny Sellman, giant
tackle, is ill with the flu and may be
kept from the game Saturday.
Johnny Preston, left end who re
ceived a fractured arm in the Olym
pic Club tilt, will play against the
Huskies in his first game since his
injury six weeks ago. He will wear
a brace to protect his weak arm in
order that he may be available for
action against both California and
Wes't Point.
