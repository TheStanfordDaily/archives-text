"The most important and recent dis

Dr. Andrews in Mongolia in 1923,"
says Dr. William Diller Matthew, who
will speak on "Dinosaurs and the Age
of Reptiles" at 7:30 o'clock tonight
in the Little Theatre.
Examination of these nests in which
were found not only eggs, but also
fossil remains of dinosaurs in all
stages of development from small
ones to adults, has thrown a great
deal of light upon the habits and fam

according to Dr. Matthew. Investiga
tion continues at the scene of the
discovery, and during the last year
several new things have come to light
which Dr. Matthew intends to men
tion tonight.
Dr. Matthew is now professor of
paleontology at the University of
California, and previously was in
charge of vertebrate paleontology at
the American Museum of Natural
History in New York. On the invita
tion of the faculty of the Stanford
geology department, he is giving a
series of talks this week for students
majoring in geology. Tonight's lec
ture is the only one open to the pub
lic. Stanford has no faculty member
who has given his particular atten
tion to fossil vertebrates, in which
field Dr. Matthew is recognized inter
nationally as an authority.
Tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock he
will address advanced students of
geology on "Principles of Phyletic De
velopment as Illustrated by the Evo
lution of the Horse." The topic of his
final lecture Friday will be "The Fos
eil Record of the Evolution of the
Primates and of Man."
