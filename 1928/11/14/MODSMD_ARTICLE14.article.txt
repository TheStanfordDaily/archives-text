# NOBEL PRIZE FOR LITERATURE GIVEN TO MME. UNDSET
## 
### 
STOCKHOLM, Nov. 13. (#>) â€” The
1928 Nobel Prize in literature was
given today to Mme. Sigrid Undset,
the third Norwegian author to be
thus honored. In 1903 it was given to
Djoernstierne Bjoernson, and in 1920
Knut Hamsun received it.
German scientists carried off the
Nobel awards for chemistry for both
1927 and 1928. Professor Heinrichs
Wieland of Munich was given the
first for his investigation of gall acids,
while Professor Adolph Windaus of
Goettingen won the award for this
year by his study of vitamins.
The 1928 physics prize was resexwed
until next year.
Henri Bergson, French author and
philosopher, was chosen as winner of
the 1927 literature prize, held over
from last year.
Other Frenchmen who have re
ceived this award were R. F. A.
Sully-Prudhomme in 1901, F. Mistral
in 1904, Romain Rolland in 1915, and
Anatole France in 1921.
The monetary value of each of
ihese prizes this year is about $42,000.
This represents a new record, due
partly to the remission of some of
the Swedish taxes and partly to im
prove business conditions, making the
fund investments yield more. Last
year the prizes were $32,478 each.
The 1928 Nobel Prize in medicine
was awarded on October 25, to Dr.
Charles Nicolle, head of the Pasteur
Institute in Tunis and noted for his
work in combating spotted fever. The
annual peace pribe will be awarded
by a committee of five in Oslo, chosen
by the Norwegian National Parlia
ment, but the check given to the win
ner with the specially engraved
diploma is drawn on a Stockholm
bank.
