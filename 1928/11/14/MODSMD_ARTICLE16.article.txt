NEW YORK, Nov. 13 (/P). — The
Lamport and Holt Line, owners of the
steamer Vestris, tonight issued an official
statement announcing 206 persons had
been rescued and 122 still were unac
counted for.
The company said the passenger list
numbered 129 and the crew 199, making a
grand total of 328 persons who were on
board the vessel.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (fP).—The
shipping board adopted a resolution to
day expressing appreciation and pride in
the courage and skill displayed by Cap
tain Schuyler F. Cumming, and the of
ficers and crew of the American Shipper,
in the rescue of 123 persons from the
wrecked steamer Vestris ofif the Virginia
Capes.
The life saving feat of Captain Cum
mings, whose vessel was the first to reach
the stricken Vestris, however, was not his
first rescue at sea for which he lias re
ceived commendation. In 1925 he per
formed a rescue for which he was cited
last year in a congressional report by
the house committee on commerce.
Chairman I. V. O'Connor of the ship
ping board wirelessed Captain Cummings
as follows:
"Following resolution of shipping
board today I beg to congratulate you
most heartily upon the gallant services
of the ail-American crew of the Ameri
can Shipper, who, under your direction,
effected heroic rescue of survivors from
the Vestris. Particularly inspiring that
your rescue comes at a time when the
people of the United States have just
determined to make powerful and per
manent fleets of merchant vessels carry
ing the American flag to all parts of the
world."
The shipping board also declared the
American Shipper in her reports had in
dicated that she was farthest of the
group of vessels that raced to the scene
of the disaster and was the first to sight
any of the Vestris' lifeboats and to ef
fect the rescue of survivors.
The American Shipper was en route
from London to New York at which port
she was due last night. On receipt of the
Vestris' SOS, the American Shipper was
160 miles away and arrived at the scene
of the disaster at approximately 2:30
a.m., today and at 4 a.m., the first of
three lifeboats was brought alongside.
