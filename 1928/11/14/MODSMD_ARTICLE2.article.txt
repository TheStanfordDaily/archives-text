# Junior Women Will Hold First Monthly Dinner in Pepper Tree Inn Tonight
## 
### 
Women of the Junior class will
hold their first monthly dinner at 6
o'clock tonight in the Pepper Tree
Inn in Palo Alto. This dinner was
scheduled for last Wednesday, but
was postponed because of the Wo
men's Conference party.
Twenty-three junior women who
spent a week-end together at Asilo
mar at the beginning of the quarter
decided to meet for dinner the first
Wednesday of every month, and make
it a class affair. Frances Shoup is
chairman of the group, and Mona
Dutton is in charge of the dinner
tonight.
