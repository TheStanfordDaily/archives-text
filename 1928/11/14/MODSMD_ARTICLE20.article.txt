# Hoover May Visit Central America In Southern Tour
## President-Elect May Extend Plans to Include All Latin Republics 
### Associated Press 
Herbert Hoover may find it necessary
to extend the itinerary of his good will
tour of Latin America considerably be
yond the scope contemplated when he de
cided to embark upon his history making
journey.
Urgent invitations for the president
elect to visit countries in both South and
Central America, which were excluded
from the oirginal schedule, are now com
ing in and from forty days his trip may
be extended to two months or slightly
longer.
Mexico, Colombia, and Ecuador are
among the southern republics which have
asked that the president-elect include
them in his tour, their invitations being
joined with that from Bolivia, the visit
to which would involve a considerable
trip, in addition to that which must be
made by the good will mission in moving
from Valparaiso to Buenos Aires.
Under the original plans, the battleship
Maryland bearing Mr. Hoover and his
party, was to have touched first at Bal
boa, Panama Canal Zone, and then moved
in past Colombia and Ecqudor to Peru,
with Chile the next country to be visited.
It is settled however, that the party
will leave San Pedro, California, on next
Monday, and it may be that a stop will
be made at a Mexican port on the west
coast, en route to Balboa.
Besides being attended by Ambassador
Henry P. Fletcher, as the official repre
sentative of the State Department, the
president-elect is to have a naval aide,
probably Commander Beauregard, grand
son of the famous Confederate general,
P. G. T. Beauregard, who was in com
mand of Fort Sumpter and subsequently
became one of General Lee's most trusted
aides.
