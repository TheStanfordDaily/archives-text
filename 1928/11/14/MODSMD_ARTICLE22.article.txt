spite Mr. Butler's famous assertion of
another clay that "pigs is pigs," they
have their ins and outs, financially speak

The last two years have been "pig"
years, it was revealed today in the bien
nial report on pork values released by the
state board of equalization. Although
pork chops in the rough have not en
joyed the comet-like rise of the once
lowly calves' liver, swine are nevertheless
worth more now than they were in 1926,
the first improvement in eight years.
The taxable worth of hogs in Califor
nia is $1,653,813, or 12.3 per cent more
than it was in 1926. This, however, is
less than the 1920 total of $2,829,473.
