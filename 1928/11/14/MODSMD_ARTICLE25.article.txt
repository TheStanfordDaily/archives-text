# BOURBON PARTY GREAT IN DEFEAT DECLARES SMITH
## Shows Strength in Last 65 Years Despite Election of Only Two Democratic Men Represents Liberal Thought Of Nation, Inspires Youth Says Defeated Candidate 
### 
NEW YOItK, Nov. 13. (/P)—Gover
nor Alfred E. Smith told the country
over the radio tonight that the prin
ciples of the Democratic Party were
as great in defeat as they would have
been in victory and that it was the
party's duty "to carry on and vindi
cate" the principles for which it had
fought.
The defeated Democratic presiden
tial candidate, delivering what many
had called his political valedictory,
said:
"Now that the dust and smoke of
battle have cleared away, I am grate
ful for the privilege extended to mo
by the Democratic National Commit
tee of speaking to millions of my
fellow-citizens and of presenting to
them some reflections of the cam
paign just ended.
Democratic Party Oldest
"The Democratic Party is the old
est political organization in the Uni
ted States, so well defined are the
doctrines and the principles upon
which it is founded that it has sur
vived defeat after defeat. In the sixty
five years that have passed since the
Civil War, only two presidents were
elected on the Democratic ticket. No
political organization otherwise
founded would have been able during
all these years to maintain an appeal
to the people brought to the polls on
last election day.
"The verdist of the American peo
ple last Tuesday was not the crushing
defeat of the Democratic Party that
some of the headlines in the public
press would have us believe. On the
contrary, let us see what the fact 3
are. Take the popular votes:
Ten Per Cent Decisive
"A change of ten per cent of the
total number of votes cast would
have changed the popular result. Con
sidering it, from the viewpoint of our
electoral college system, a change of
less than 500,000 votes spread around
the country would have altered the
result. We have, therefore, the assur
ance from the election returns that
the Democratic Party is a live, a
vigorous, and a forceful one. Exist
ence of such a party is necessary
under our system of government. The
people rule negatively as well as af
firmatively, and a vigorous and intelli
gent minority is a necessary check
upon the tyranny of tne majority. Ex
perience has always shown even in
our small political subdivisions that
when the minority party is weak and
hopeless, grave abuses creep into the
structure of government and the ad
ministration of its affairs.
"When the majority party believes that
it has everything its own way, it loses its
fear of reprisals at the polls for mis
management or misconduct of the gov
ernment. The Democratic party today is
the great liberal party of the nation. It
leads the progressive thought in all the
countries. It holds out the only hope
of return of the fundamental principles
