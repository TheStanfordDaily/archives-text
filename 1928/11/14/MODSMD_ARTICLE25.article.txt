# BOURBON PARTY GREAT IN DEFEAT DECLARES SMITH
## Shows Strength in Last 65 Years Despite Election of Only Two Democratic Men Represents Liberal Thought Of Nation, Inspires Youth Says Defeated Candidate

NEW YOItK, Nov. 13. (/P)—Gover
nor Alfred E. Smith told the country
over the radio tonight that the prin
ciples of the Democratic Party were
as great in defeat as they would have
been in victory and that it was the
party's duty "to carry on and vindi
cate" the principles for which it had
fought.
The defeated Democratic presiden
tial candidate, delivering what many
had called his political valedictory,
said:
"Now that the dust and smoke of
battle have cleared away, I am grate
ful for the privilege extended to mo
by the Democratic National Commit
tee of speaking to millions of my
fellow-citizens and of presenting to
them some reflections of the cam
paign just ended.
Democratic Party Oldest
"The Democratic Party is the old
est political organization in the Uni
ted States, so well defined are the
doctrines and the principles upon
which it is founded that it has sur
vived defeat after defeat. In the sixty
five years that have passed since the
Civil War, only two presidents were
elected on the Democratic ticket. No
political organization otherwise
founded would have been able during
all these years to maintain an appeal
to the people brought to the polls on
last election day.
"The verdist of the American peo
ple last Tuesday was not the crushing
defeat of the Democratic Party that
some of the headlines in the public
press would have us believe. On the
contrary, let us see what the fact 3
are. Take the popular votes:
Ten Per Cent Decisive
"A change of ten per cent of the
total number of votes cast would
have changed the popular result. Con
sidering it, from the viewpoint of our
electoral college system, a change of
less than 500,000 votes spread around
the country would have altered the
result. We have, therefore, the assur
ance from the election returns that
the Democratic Party is a live, a
vigorous, and a forceful one. Exist
ence of such a party is necessary
under our system of government. The
people rule negatively as well as af
firmatively, and a vigorous and intelli
gent minority is a necessary check
upon the tyranny of tne majority. Ex
perience has always shown even in
our small political subdivisions that
when the minority party is weak and
hopeless, grave abuses creep into the
structure of government and the ad
ministration of its affairs.
"When the majority party believes that
it has everything its own way, it loses its
fear of reprisals at the polls for mis
management or misconduct of the gov
ernment. The Democratic party today is
the great liberal party of the nation. It
leads the progressive thought in all the
countries. It holds out the only hope
of return of the fundamental principles
on which this country was built and as
a result of which it has grown and
thrived.
Offers Inspration
"To the young men and women of the
country, the Democratic party with its
fine traditions, and its breadth of vision,
offers the only inspiration. The Demo
cratic party would not be in a position
four years from now to solicit the con
fidence and the support of the American
people, if during that period it neglected
to build up a constructive program and
relied entirely upon the failure of an
opposition party. That cannot be done
by the minority party permitting itself to
Ix?come a party of destruction and oppo
sition for political purposes. We have
seen too much of that in this country.
It has been particularly noticeable in the
City of New York where great forward
looking constructive measures were de
layed for years by partisan opposition
seeking to withhold from the Democratic
party credit for their accomplishments.
Blockade Not Purpose
"While it is true that every party must
adhere to its fundamental principles, ob
struction and blockade for the sole pur
pose of embarrassing the party in power
are not calculated to promote the best
interests of the country. It would be re
garded a constructive achievement if the
Democratic party at Washington were
to formulate a program adapted and of
fered to the Congress of the nation and
their dependents and a refusal on the
part of the party in power to accept it, or
their inability to bring about party unity
for the solution of these problems would
then fix responsibility and make a rec
ord upon which a successful campaign
can be waged four years from now.
"What this country demands is con
structive and not destructive criticism, a
constructive program embodying the dec
larations of the Democratic platform. It
will not do for the rank and file of the
American people to be intensely inter
ested in the issue and party program for
a couple of months before election and
then permit that interest to die out when
the result is announced.
Progress by Education
"The political history of the United
States clearly indicates that every prog

ressive step, every government reform,
has been won only after a period of
persistent effort and by the slow process
of educating the electorate.
"The first and indispensable element of
education is information. A full and
complete presentation of the facts is eas
ier to do today than it was years ago
with the use of the radio and the increas
ing interests of our young people in pub
lic affairs. It must be remembered that
while the political party may seriously
divide public thought and public opinion
throughout the country during the prog
ress of the campaign, after the American
people have made their decision, the man
selected is not the president of the Re
publican party but the president of the
United States. He is the president of all
the people and as such he is entitled to
all the co-operation of every citizen in
the development of a program calculated
to promote the welfare and the best in
terests of this country.
"To that party and to the people of
this state, who have four times elected
me as their chief executive, I shall always
be profoundly grateful. I have in a
measure attempted to express that grati
tude in the form of devotion to public
service. In return for the contidencc
reposed in me by the people of my state,

the state with an eye single to the welfare
and the interest of her people.
"Nor shall we ever fail, upon each re
curring anniversary of Thanksgiving, to
invoke the aid of the Ruler of the uni

Democratic Party Oldest
"The Democratic Party is the old
est political organization in the Uni

doctrines and the principles upon
which it is founded that it has sur
vived defeat after defeat. In the sixty
five years that have passed since the
Civil War, only two presidents were

political organization otherwise
founded would have been able during
all these years to maintain an appeal
to the people brought to the polls on

"The verdist of the American peo
ple last Tuesday was not the crushing
defeat of the Democratic Party that
some of the headlines in the public
press would have us believe. On the

Ten Per Cent Decisive
"A change of ten per cent of the
total number of votes cast would
have changed the popular result. Con
sidering it, from the viewpoint of our
electoral college system, a change of
less than 500,000 votes spread around
the country would have altered the
result. We have, therefore, the assur
ance from the election returns that
the Democratic Party is a live, a
vigorous, and a forceful one. Exist
ence of such a party is necessary
under our system of government. The
people rule negatively as well as af
firmatively, and a vigorous and intelli
gent minority is a necessary check
upon the tyranny of tne majority. Ex
perience has always shown even in
our small political subdivisions that
when the minority party is weak and
hopeless, grave abuses creep into the
structure of government and the ad
ministration of its affairs.
"When the majority party believes that
it has everything its own way, it loses its
fear of reprisals at the polls for mis
management or misconduct of the gov

the great liberal party of the nation. It

countries. It holds out the only hope
of return of the fundamental principles

opposition party. That cannot be done
by the minority party permitting itself to
Ix?come a party of destruction and oppo

seen too much of that in this country.

are. Take the popular votes:
Ten Per Cent Decisive
"A change of ten per cent of the
total number of votes cast would
have changed the popular result. Con
sidering it, from the viewpoint of our
electoral college system, a change of
less than 500,000 votes spread around
the country would have altered the
result. We have, therefore, the assur
ance from the election returns that
the Democratic Party is a live, a
vigorous, and a forceful one. Exist
ence of such a party is necessary
under our system of government. The
people rule negatively as well as af
firmatively, and a vigorous and intelli
gent minority is a necessary check
upon the tyranny of tne majority. Ex
perience has always shown even in
our small political subdivisions that
when the minority party is weak and
hopeless, grave abuses creep into the
structure of government and the ad
ministration of its affairs.
"When the majority party believes that
it has everything its own way, it loses its
fear of reprisals at the polls for mis
management or misconduct of the gov
ernment. The Democratic party today is
the great liberal party of the nation. It
leads the progressive thought in all the
countries. It holds out the only hope
of return of the fundamental principles
on which this country was built and as
a result of which it has grown and
thrived.
Offers Inspration
"To the young men and women of the
country, the Democratic party with its
fine traditions, and its breadth of vision,
offers the only inspiration. The Demo
cratic party would not be in a position
four years from now to solicit the con
fidence and the support of the American
people, if during that period it neglected
to build up a constructive program and
relied entirely upon the failure of an
opposition party. That cannot be done
by the minority party permitting itself to
Ix?come a party of destruction and oppo
sition for political purposes. We have
seen too much of that in this country.
It has been particularly noticeable in the
City of New York where great forward
looking constructive measures were de
layed for years by partisan opposition
seeking to withhold from the Democratic
party credit for their accomplishments.
Blockade Not Purpose
"While it is true that every party must
adhere to its fundamental principles, ob
struction and blockade for the sole pur
pose of embarrassing the party in power
are not calculated to promote the best
interests of the country. It would be re
garded a constructive achievement if the
Democratic party at Washington were
to formulate a program adapted and of
fered to the Congress of the nation and
their dependents and a refusal on the
part of the party in power to accept it, or
their inability to bring about party unity
for the solution of these problems would
then fix responsibility and make a rec
ord upon which a successful campaign
can be waged four years from now.
"What this country demands is con
structive and not destructive criticism, a
constructive program embodying the dec
larations of the Democratic platform. It
will not do for the rank and file of the
American people to be intensely inter
ested in the issue and party program for
a couple of months before election and
then permit that interest to die out when
the result is announced.
Progress by Education
"The political history of the United
States clearly indicates that every prog

ressive step, every government reform,
has been won only after a period of
persistent effort and by the slow process
of educating the electorate.
"The first and indispensable element of
education is information. A full and
complete presentation of the facts is eas
ier to do today than it was years ago
with the use of the radio and the increas
ing interests of our young people in pub
lic affairs. It must be remembered that
while the political party may seriously
divide public thought and public opinion
throughout the country during the prog
ress of the campaign, after the American
people have made their decision, the man
selected is not the president of the Re
publican party but the president of the
United States. He is the president of all
the people and as such he is entitled to
all the co-operation of every citizen in
the development of a program calculated
to promote the welfare and the best in
terests of this country.
"To that party and to the people of
this state, who have four times elected
me as their chief executive, I shall always
be profoundly grateful. I have in a
measure attempted to express that grati
tude in the form of devotion to public
service. In return for the contidencc
reposed in me by the people of my state,
1 endeavored to administer the affairs of
the state with an eye single to the welfare
and the interest of her people.
"Nor shall we ever fail, upon each re
curring anniversary of Thanksgiving, to
invoke the aid of the Ruler of the uni
verse —that we may never lose our faith
in the fundamental principles upon which
this country was founded."
