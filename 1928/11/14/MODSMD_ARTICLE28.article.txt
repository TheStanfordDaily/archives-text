"Kellogg Flays War" says one front page headline, and adjacent to it
is: "Coolidge Scores Europe and Urges Strong Navy."
The Secretary of State advocates the settlement of international dis
putes by arbitration ; the President says the United States does not attempt
to isolate itself from the Old World (and remarks in the next breath that
what this country needs is a more adequate naval defense.
A prudent nation, while attempting to swallow the isolation story,
would nevertheless keep its distance from the naval guns.
The machinery of arbitration for the maintenance of peace, said Mr.
Kellogg, "cannot function effectively unless there is back of it a popular
will for peace."
The United States, according to Mr. Coolidge, because of its geographi
cal characteristics, treaty engagements, and economic importance and
because of its lack of fueling stations and merchant ships, capable of
mounting six-inch guns, is entitled "to a larger number of warships than
a nation having these advantages."
Both of these pleas are plausible; sane supporters there are for both
of the arguments presented. But how the two can be reconciled as a
governmental policy escapes our unathletic mind.
Armament-building does not promote peace, for not only does an
armed nation represent a potential martial forcc, but also its very pre
paredness disturbs the sensitive international balance.
The system of arbitration of disputes does not promote war; nay it
is a set-up expressly designed successfully to remove the necessity for war.
If, on the one hand, Mr. Kellogg asks for a World Court, and, on the
other, Mr. Coolidge for competitive building of armaments, there is a
discrepancy in fundamental point of view. The Government's policy is in
this respect about as all-inclusive as it theoretically could be.
