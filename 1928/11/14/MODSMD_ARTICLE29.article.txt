# Wanted: A Pants Donor
## 
### 
The Daily Bruin of the U.C.L.A. threatens to go into a new journal
istic activity:
Yell leaders must wear pants. White flannel pants. But who buys
them? In the past the yell leaders have raised the pants by means
fair or foul. This year the best our three song birds have been able
to wear have been dirty cords.
And it isn't their fault either. The council hasn't the money to
buy the pants. If it did buy them, it would have to buy clothes for
half the student body.
Now the thing to do is to find someone who will donate the pants.
This the Daily Bruin takes upon itself to do.
Let the clothiers, haberdashers, and old clothes men beware.
Someone is going to either give the pants or lose them.
