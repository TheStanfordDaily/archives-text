The Editor, Sir:
It's a pretty sad matter, it seems
to me, when a University of the size
and standing of this one cannot take
the time to pause and to show in
some way that it has not forgotten
all the events which lie behind Armis- j
tice Day, and which are commemo- j
rated by that day.
True —there was a special service |
in the Chapel Sunday in honor of the |
occasion, but surely all will admit
that the Sunday congregation at the
Chapel includes only a very, very j
small portion of the Stanford student
body, and the service did not indicate
recognition of Armistice Day by the
student body as a whole. That was
just one of thousands of similar ser- >
vices held in churches throughout the !
country and cannot be taken as an
observance of the day by Stanford
University.
If Stanford officials did not see tit
to declare the day a holiday or to call I

]an assembly, that is excusable be
cause neither accomplishes much -to
ward attaining the end in view. What
could have been done and what, I
believe, should have been done, is
just this: Friday's Daily might have
; announced that the 11 o'clock bell
Monday would herald a one- or two
| minute period of silence and cessa
| tion of all activities. Just that short
| period is more effective and condu
cive to thought than any assembly
or holiday ever thought of being—and
: I'm sure anyone who has participate:!
in that sort of thing will agree witli
me.
What of the ten million that died
in that war? What of the thousands
that might as well be dead —suffer-
ing, invalids, today, ten years after?
Are we going to forgot them? Patriot
ism! If oblivion and neglect are the
rewards for patriotism in the highest
degree, who wants to be a patriot?
—S. G. L., '30.
