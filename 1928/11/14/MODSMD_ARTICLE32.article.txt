BOTH ENDS OF THE CANDLE
A short time ago a Stanford student
met a friend who asked him the in
evitable question: "How did you go
last quarter?"
"Flunked out," he answered.
"That's too bad," said the friend.
"I'm mighty sorry."
"Well I'm glad," was the unex
pected reply; and when the friend
questioned further and had listened
to the explanation of this unusual at
titude, he could partly understand it.
The student in question had spent
four hours a day in classes, and
eight hours a day at three different
jobs which enabled him, with careful
calculation, to pay his expenses and
to afford such luxuries as seeing the
Big Game, a picture show once in
three weeks, and two visits a year to
San Francisco. Eight and four are
twelve; twelve hours is a good day's
v.ork. In addition to this one must
take time to eat and to get from one
place to another. When this day is
dene, the necessity of sitting at a
desk and studying through hours
when others are pleasantly asleep is
a form of torture which cannot be
long endured.
"I haven't got a thing out of col
lege," this student told his friend.
"They did me a favor when they
flunked me out. If I ever come back,
you can bet your life I'll have a grub
stake that will leave me a little time
to play around and study."
The young man who goes to col
lege and pays his own way through
50-cents-an-hour work — and stays
there — is unwise. He loses more
than he gains. This statement ex
cepts the student who, through some
special talent or good fortune, can
earn sufficient money in short hours
—but he is a rare animal.
The average self-supporting student
is constantly harrassed by odd and
ill-paying jobs. As for leisure during
his college career —he might as well

spend four years running after a
street car. He cannot do justice to
any study such as law, medicine, en
gineering — without damaging his
health. If he is taking some other
subject, he could get more out of it
by leaving school and being his own
professor.
He rarely has intimate friends, and
very few acquaintances. His chief ac
quisition from college is the habit of
extravagance—and a realization of
the many things of life denied to
him. Some day, perhaps, he will be a
great man, and his friends will point
to him as the once-poor boy who put
himself through college. It is a two
to-one shot that if he succeeds, he
will have done so in spite of college.
Mentally he is harming himself
even more than physically. Being
young, he craves the activities and
dissipations enjoyed by students who
have free time. If he resolutely gives
these up, he finishes college with
numerous repressions, wim something
of an inferiority complex—and some
times with a pretty sour outlook on
the world. If he takes part in those
activities, both health and education
suffer.
One day he puts on cap and gown,
steps into line and receives his price
less sheepskin. The next day he is a
young man physically, mentally, and
financially impaired, enjoying no
"pull," facing a future of job-hunting.
During four years his alma mater
has, with kind intentions, given all
possible aid in securing work for him.
It might better have advised him to
quit.
Undoubtedly, certain benefits in
character development do accrue to
the self-supporting student. There
fore, it may be best to revise the
original premise, and to state it thus:
The average young man who goes
to college and pays his own way—
and stays there longer than two
years—is unwise.—Winston Norman.

The average self-supporting student

spend four years running after a

gineering — without damaging his
health. If he is taking some other
subject, he could get more out of it

professor.
He rarely has intimate friends, and

quisition from college is the habit of
extravagance—and a realization of
the many things of life denied to
him. Some day, perhaps, he will be a

to him as the once-poor boy who put
himself through college. It is a two
to-one shot that if he succeeds, he
will have done so in spite of college.
Mentally he is harming himself
even more than physically. Being
young, he craves the activities and
dissipations enjoyed by students who
have free time. If he resolutely gives
these up, he finishes college with
numerous repressions, wim something
of an inferiority complex—and some
times with a pretty sour outlook on
the world. If he takes part in those
activities, both health and education
suffer.
One day he puts on cap and gown,
steps into line and receives his price

BOTH ENDS OF THE CANDLE
A short time ago a Stanford student
met a friend who asked him the in
evitable question: "How did you go
last quarter?"
"Flunked out," he answered.
"That's too bad," said the friend.
"I'm mighty sorry."
"Well I'm glad," was the unex
pected reply; and when the friend
questioned further and had listened
to the explanation of this unusual at
titude, he could partly understand it.
The student in question had spent
four hours a day in classes, and
eight hours a day at three different
jobs which enabled him, with careful
calculation, to pay his expenses and
to afford such luxuries as seeing the
Big Game, a picture show once in
three weeks, and two visits a year to
San Francisco. Eight and four are
twelve; twelve hours is a good day's
v.ork. In addition to this one must
take time to eat and to get from one
place to another. When this day is
dene, the necessity of sitting at a
desk and studying through hours
when others are pleasantly asleep is
a form of torture which cannot be
long endured.
"I haven't got a thing out of col
lege," this student told his friend.
"They did me a favor when they
flunked me out. If I ever come back,
you can bet your life I'll have a grub
stake that will leave me a little time
to play around and study."
The young man who goes to col
lege and pays his own way through
50-cents-an-hour work — and stays
there — is unwise. He loses more
than he gains. This statement ex
cepts the student who, through some
special talent or good fortune, can
earn sufficient money in short hours
—but he is a rare animal.
