The New Temple. By Johan Bojer.
(New York: The Century Co.
1928. $2.50.)
Lorentz's soul was torn with strug
gle. He sought to build a new temple
presided over by a new God, not the
conventional, jealous Jahveh whom
he sees people worshipping. He feels
in the beauty and immensity of na
ture some sort of a Unity, called by
man God; but he cannot reconcile
his conception of what God ought to
be with the vengeful old God of the
traditional church.
The strife tearing at the heart of
Lorentz is finally quieted by a soft,
flooding dawn of a new understand
ing. Johan Bojer is writing from the
depths of his own realization. There
is a vivid simplicity to his style that
will make passages in the book live in
memory long after most novels are
forgotten.
Tenderly and sympathetically the
author sketches his characters from
among the strong sturdy folk of Nor
wegian farms and villages. Lorentz,
of the rebellious nature, his sister,
Louise, who inherited the estate of
the widow of Bruseth, their old par
ents; all these and the unfolding of
nature itself are handled in a quiet
but powerful style that will make you
close your eyes in silence while your
heart swells with appreciation of the
depth of human nature and the seem
ing inevitability of a universal spiri
tual consciousness.
I say this fully realizing that many
of us are agnostics, a few profess
atheism; but none of us can read this
book without, at least for the time
being, feeling definite membership in
a universal plan.
At the present, Johan Bojer is con
sidered Norway's greatest modern
novelist. He is best-known in this
country by his book, "The Great Hun
ger." If you read that and enjoyed it
you will also appreciate "The New
Temple."
Toilers of the Hills. By Vardis Fisher.
(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co.
1928. $2.50.)
This book sets out to tell the truth
of life in a dry-farming section of
Idaho, but it follows in the wake of
so many novels about life in farming
communities that it can only cause
a small splash compared with such
novels as Dreiser's "Sister Carrie"
and Frank Norris' "McTeague."
The book has one point to make,
and succeeds in making it. As a
theme there is the stubborness of
land in what was once the Great
American Desert. Dock Hunter took
his young wife, Opal, into the sago
covered Idaho hills beyond the Snake
Itiver. On a plot of homestead ground
Dock fought to bring forth fruit. He
and Opal lived in a shack. Most of
their neighbors were bumpkins. Opal
had child after child. She alternated
belween a fondness for her stubborn,
rubish husband, and a hatred for his
evil-looking teeth and his untidy hab
its And life went by with hardship

following hardship.
In the end Dock learned to beat the
rigors of the Idaho seasons and soil.
He profited by the rise in wheat prices
during the World War. But Opal
never lived in the shelter of a valley;
her life was spent, much of it ungra
ciously, upon the hills.
One would choose neither Dock nor
Ope for companionship. There would
be a constant temptation to murder
Dock for his boorishnes, and for his
corruption of a New England country
dialect. Ope might have been a beau
tilul woman, but as years went on
they certainly did not enhance her
charm.
But the plight of these two is so
pitiful, their suffering is so universal
that one can never throw "Toilers of
the Hills" away with the exclama
tion, "These people aren't worth read
ing about." —Clifford F. Weigle.

Toilers of the Hills. By Vardis Fisher.
(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co.
1928. $2.50.)
This book sets out to tell the truth
of life in a dry-farming section of
Idaho, but it follows in the wake of
so many novels about life in farming
communities that it can only cause
a small splash compared with such
novels as Dreiser's "Sister Carrie"
and Frank Norris' "McTeague."
The book has one point to make,
and succeeds in making it. As a
theme there is the stubborness of
land in what was once the Great
American Desert. Dock Hunter took
his young wife, Opal, into the sago
covered Idaho hills beyond the Snake
Itiver. On a plot of homestead ground
Dock fought to bring forth fruit. He
and Opal lived in a shack. Most of
their neighbors were bumpkins. Opal
had child after child. She alternated
belween a fondness for her stubborn,
rubish husband, and a hatred for his
evil-looking teeth and his untidy hab
its And life went by with hardship

following hardship.
In the end Dock learned to beat the
rigors of the Idaho seasons and soil.
He profited by the rise in wheat prices
during the World War. But Opal
never lived in the shelter of a valley;
her life was spent, much of it ungra
ciously, upon the hills.
One would choose neither Dock nor
Ope for companionship. There would
be a constant temptation to murder
Dock for his boorishnes, and for his
corruption of a New England country
dialect. Ope might have been a beau
tilul woman, but as years went on
they certainly did not enhance her
charm.
But the plight of these two is so
pitiful, their suffering is so universal
that one can never throw "Toilers of
the Hills" away with the exclama
tion, "These people aren't worth read
ing about." —Clifford F. Weigle.
The New Temple. By Johan Bojer.
(New York: The Century Co.
1928. $2.50.)
Lorentz's soul was torn with strug
gle. He sought to build a new temple
presided over by a new God, not the
conventional, jealous Jahveh whom
he sees people worshipping. He feels
in the beauty and immensity of na
ture some sort of a Unity, called by
man God; but he cannot reconcile
his conception of what God ought to
be with the vengeful old God of the
traditional church.
The strife tearing at the heart of
Lorentz is finally quieted by a soft,
flooding dawn of a new understand
ing. Johan Bojer is writing from the
depths of his own realization. There
is a vivid simplicity to his style that
will make passages in the book live in
memory long after most novels are
forgotten.
Tenderly and sympathetically the
author sketches his characters from
among the strong sturdy folk of Nor
wegian farms and villages. Lorentz,
of the rebellious nature, his sister,
Louise, who inherited the estate of
the widow of Bruseth, their old par
ents; all these and the unfolding of
nature itself are handled in a quiet
but powerful style that will make you
close your eyes in silence while your
heart swells with appreciation of the
depth of human nature and the seem
ing inevitability of a universal spiri
tual consciousness.
I say this fully realizing that many
of us are agnostics, a few profess
atheism; but none of us can read this
book without, at least for the time
