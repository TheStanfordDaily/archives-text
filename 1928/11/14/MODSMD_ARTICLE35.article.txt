November 13th —
Tonight out to tliw movies with a
blind date, which my good friend had
garnered for me, and although I did
protest that I could not properly allow
myself to be entertained by a young
man whom I had not seen, she ex
plained lengthily that he was anxious
to meet me, and had asked her in
numerable times to arrange an intro
duction. With much misgivings did
consent, and was amazingly pleased
and surprised for the young beau was
not only quite adequately beautiful,
but he was also very charming, and
did entertain me greatly with com
ments upon activities on this campus.

He did quizz me most searchingly
on my atitude toward the various
sororities, and when I did confess
that, aside from regarding them as a
species of boarding houses, I had no
opinion, he did fall to lecturing me
most soundly on their respective
merits and disadvantages. Whereat I
did answer that my uncle had warned
me that I must not state a preference
in such a matter until I was very
sure that such a group likewise pre
ferred me. But, lord! from what the
young man did tell me, it seems that
the situation is not as simple as it
seems, and I am so frightened at the
intrigues he suggested that to leave
the University winter quarter seems
the only solution.

And it does abash me mightily to
think that my "potentialities" are
considered as seriously as my present
wardrobe and character, for I do have
my hands sufficiently full developing
my present capacities. Occasionally,
in peregrinations about Roble, I do
come upon groups discussing the odds
of the ten Greek groups in awed
tones, but it had not occurred to me
before that the feminine section of
the Row might likewise be criticizing
the freshman women. Which makes
me very self-conscious, and do de
voutly hope no one noticed the run
in my stocking on Quad yesterday.

But albeit the young man was so
very beautiful, did not spend much
time thinking of such things until
later. He did have a slow and most
effective drawl, and did call me
"sugar" when he bid me goodnight,
which I find the finest word in the
language, and he did ask me earnest
ly for another opportunity to enjoy
my company, so I did say of course,
and I now wonder how I can live
through the next four days till I see
him again. And do hope most fervent
ly that he will be as beautiful in a
tuxedo as he is in a business suit,
and do vow to myself I shall never
look for him on Quad and risk the
disappointment of his appearance in
a sweater. —Hallie Keating.
