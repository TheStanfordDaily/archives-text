BERKELEY, Nov. 13.
nia's gridders, who arrived here last
night from their 6-0 triumph over
Washington at Seattle, prepared to
day to start practice for a lesser op
ponent, the University of Nevada.
The game will be played Saturday.
The Bears came out of the Wash
ington game unscathed, but it is un
likely that Coach "Nibs" Price will
use his first string for the whole of
the Nevada game. He will probably
only send them in long enough to
keep them in trim for their big shot
â€” the Big Came with Stanford Uni
versity on November 24.
