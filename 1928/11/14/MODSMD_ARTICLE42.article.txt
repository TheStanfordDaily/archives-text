# AIMEE INDIGNANT AT GRAND JURY'S ACTION
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13. (/P)â€” From
far-off London, Aimee Semple McPher
son has pounced indignantly on bits
of news that told her how a grand
jury has started to peer into the past
oi her kidnaping case on the theory
that she might have bribed a district
attorney.
As the evangelist of Angelus Tem
ple puts it, the intimations of bribery
have been born of political - strife in
the city of her adoption. Not only are
they utterly untrue, dispatches quote
her, but the grand jury once heard
all she can tell and ever will tell,
despite the fact that the jurors ap
parently are willing to listen to more.
