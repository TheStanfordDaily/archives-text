CHAMPAIGN-URBANA, 111., Nov.
13. (I.P.) —At last science otters an
explanation for the fervid braying of
the early-morning bathroom Carusos.
Statisticians are said to have de
termined that at least one member of
every family is afflicted with that
disease, or liabit, or what-not, that
causes him or her to make the early
morning breezes hideous with loudly
shouted songs, usually off key and
decidedly Hat, as an accompaniment
to their before-breakfast facewashing
or shave. Heretofore, no attempt has
ever been made to analyze the "why"
of such a disturbing and distressing
phenomenon.
Professor P. R. Watson of the Uni
versity of Illinois department of
physics has jokingly ottered a scien
tific explanation for the curse.
Watson is an expert in acoustics
and he believes that the reason peo
ple want to sing as they wash their
faces or shave is that the bathroom,
being small and with more or less
smooth walls, is a resonator like the
body of a guitar or violin. In no other
place in the house .are the tones so
lully amplified, and for this reason
the bathroom becomes the concert
hall of anyone who is pleased with
his voice under these conditions.
Psychologically speaking, one does
the thing that pleases him most un
less prevented from doing so by some
thing. With the bathroom door firmly
locked —what could be safer?
