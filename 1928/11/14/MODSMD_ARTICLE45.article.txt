# AERO PROFESSOR COMPLETES BOOK ON PLANE DESIGN
## 
### 
Alfred S. Niles, professor of aero
l nautical engineering at Stanford, in
| collaboration with Joseph S. Newell,
i who at present is assistant professor
iof structural engineering at Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, has
recently completed a new text, "Aero
plane Structures," which will be re
leased by the publishers next Febru
|
! ary.
Professor Niles has been connected ,
with the development of methods of ;
stress analysis and their application
;to aeroplane design. Since 1 ( J20 he |
was in charge of that work in the j
Air Corps until his resignation to,
come to Stanford in the summer of
1027. Newell acted as his chief as
| sietant during that time. A year ago
he resigned to accept his present
position with M.I.T.
During his time with the Air Corps,
I Niles formulated a set of rules for
I computing loads in aeroplanes which
were to be used in design. The rules
are now accepted as standard and
are used by the Army and Navy.
In 1927, Newell was employed by J
the Department of Commerce to |
formulate similar rules for them. He
adopted the rules of Niles insofar as
they were applicable to commercial i
design. During the past summer both !
were employed by the Department of
Commerce to check designs of aero- j
jÂ»lanes submitted with applications i
for licenses, and to recommend such j
changes in rules as experience in
their operation showed to be desir-
I able.
