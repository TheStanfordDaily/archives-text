# END-SEASON GAMES WILL DETERMINE FINAL RATING IN NATIONAL FOOTBALL
## Notre Dame Is Obstacle to Undefeated Year for U.S.C., Carnegie Tech; Two Battles on December 8 to Decide Southern Conference Honors 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 13 (if).â€”lt will
take the final salvo of the football cam
paign in a series of engagements to be
played as late as December 8 to determine
the final rating in this year's race for
national honors.
It happens that four of the teams now
conspicuously involved in the nation-wide
tussle do not close their drives until that
date. Many an anxious car will he tuned
to the reports of Notre Dame's invasion
of Southern California's stronghold, Geo
gia Tech's traditional tussle with the
University of Georgia at Atlanta, and
Florida's battle with Tennessee at Nash
ville on December 8.
Southern California is unbeatable, in
fact the only major Pacific coast team
that has suffered no worse than a tie
and that with California. Georgia Tech,
Florida and Tennessee are bowling along
at the top of the Southern Conference

heap, all with spotless slates and all help
ing to beat the gridiron tomtoms for
Dixie as they seldom have been beaten
before.
After an erratic start Notre Dame, if
not able to claim any national title laur
els itself, appears bent on making it un
pleasant for a few others outstanding as
championship contenders.
The Hoosiers upset the Army's hopes
last Saturday and will attempt to check
the unbeaten dash of Carnegie this week
at South Bend. After that the Notre Dame
Nomads will go west in search of South
ern California's scalp.
There is a dramatic touch to the Car
negie-Notre Dame affair, for it will be
remembered the last time they met, in
1926, the Tartans sprang one of the big
gest upsets of recent years, handing the
Hoosiers their otdy defeat of the season
to the tune of 19 to 0.
