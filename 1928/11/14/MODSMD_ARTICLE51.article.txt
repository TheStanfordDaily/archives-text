LONDON, Nov. 13. (/P)—The Armis
tice Day speech of President Coolidge
was the background for a sharp de
bate tonight in the House of Com
mons with Stanley Baldwin, Prime
Minister, and David Lloyd George,
Liberal leader, firing the heavy guns.
The discussion was precipitated
when the war-time premier moved an
official Liberal amendment to the ad
dress from the throne. In this amend
ment the Lloyd George party invited
the House of Commons to declare
that the Anglo-French naval accord
endangered the peace of Europe and
good relations with the United States.

Peking's lone chop suey restaurant
has given up the ghost—there were
not enough Americans to support it.
