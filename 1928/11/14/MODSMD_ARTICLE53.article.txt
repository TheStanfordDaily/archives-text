# FOUR TEAMS WIN IN MURAL TOUCH FOOTBALL GAMES
## Sequoia I Defeats Theta Xi 6-0 as El Toro Wins From El Cuadro 
### 
Theta Chi, Delta Tau Delta, Se
quoia I, and El Toro were victorious
in yesterday's intramural touch foot
ball play, the two former winning by
defaults from Sigma Chi and Sequoia
II respectively. Seqouia I defeated
Theta Xi ti to 0, and El Toro easily
downed El Cuadro by a score of 18
to 9.
In the eating club's game the El
Toro team met very little resistance,
their opponents being unable to get
the ball within scoring distance of
the goal at any time. Vard Loomis
starred for the winners, throwing
practically all of the passes, and dur
ing the great majority of the game
the ball was kept close to the El
Cuadro goal, where it was very dif
ficult to prevent a score.
Sequoia l's touchdown came at the
beginning of the second half, when
a pass was completed over the goal
line. During the remainder of the
game the Theta Xi team made a
strong attempt to tie the score, but
were unsuccessful, although the ball
was can-fed into Sequoia I territory
several times.
The Sigma Nu-Phi Kappa Sigma
contest was postponed to some later
date at the request of both teams.
