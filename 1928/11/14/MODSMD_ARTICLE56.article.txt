# SPORTS OF 1928
## Berkeley's Benny 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Out in California they are singing
the praises of a young Jewish foot
ball player, Benny Lom, who has
topped off a good 1927 season by star
j ring in nearly every game he has
played in this year. Denny is a real
triple-threat man and is being primed
for the "Big Game" of the Coast,
that with Stanford on November 24.
It was in this contest last year that
Lom brought a chill to 40,000 Stan
lord supporters by dashing around
the Cardinals' right wing for a long
gain, only to be forced out of bounds
three inches from the goal line.
Lom is a great punter, and Califor
nia always seems to have good kick
ers, ever since the days of Archie
Nesbit of Andy Smith's "Wonder
Team." Ben's long boots repeatedly
kept Southern California away from
the U.C. goal line in the Bears' sur
prising scoreless tie with the Trojans
this year, just as his beautiful spirals
had prevented further scoring on the
Southern Californians' part in the
1927 battle.
As a ball-carrier Benny Lom is a
streak of greased lightning, and his
ability as an accurate passer keeps
the secondary offense constantly on
guard, as his opponents never know
whether he is going to run with the
ball or throw it. Lom scored against
Oregon, and completely fooled the
"Webfoots" by a long end run from

punt formation.
It was Lom's 31-yard pass to Nor
ton that defeated St. Mary's early in
October, and against Santa Clara he
scored one of his team's three touch
downs on a 42-yard gallop. Bear parti
sans are claiming that Benny Lom is
as great as Michigan's great all
around player of a few years back,
Benny Friedman.
