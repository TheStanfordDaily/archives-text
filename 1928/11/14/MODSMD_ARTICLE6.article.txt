## 
### 
"Bohemia has been a battlefield of cul
ture and ideas," said Dr. Otaker Vocadlo
last night in his lecture on "Bohemia,
the Cultural Hub of Central Europe,"
"It has a peculiar geographic position,
and as a consequence has a peculiar his
tory. Situated in the very heart of Eu
rope and hemmed in by several powerful
nations, it has been in constant contact
with outside influences."
Dr. Vocadlo went on to give a survey
of the history of Central Europe and of
the Slavic peoples. He stressed the fact
that the Slavs have been very much mis
understood by the English peoples. He
deplored the prevalent idea that they are
an uneducated and unimportant race.
They have had a decided influence on the
peoples of Europe since early European
history, and their advance has been es
pecially great in educational lines, he
stated.
"In order to appreciate Bohemia's con
tributions to civilization we must meas
ure their handicaps. It has undergone
many hardships, but has recovered be
cause of its constant stressing of the im
portance of education," Vocadlo con
cluded.
