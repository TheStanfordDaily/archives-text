# PROGRESS IN '32 GOLF TOURNEY IS HINDERED BY RAIN
## 
### 
Rain yesterday hindered competi
tion in the freshman golf tournament
which will determine the positions of
the various contestants in a ladder
tournament to be played at an early
date, weather permitting. Only four
men turned out yesterday, Harry
Eichelberger, Norman Macbett, Dick
Ccmson, and Jeff Stephens. They
were able to play only nine holes
each, Eichelberger scoring a 38, Mac
bett a 42, Comson a 43, and Stephens
a 45.
In a ladder tournament the players
are placed in the order of their
merit, and anyone may challenge the
man above him. Incidentally, the four
men named above are almost certain
of high positions. The ranking tourna
ment will be continued as soon as
possible to complete the placing of
participants.
