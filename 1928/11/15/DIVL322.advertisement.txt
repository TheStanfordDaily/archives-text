A pleasant evening at the Phi Alpha Gamma soror
ity house in the days of our Dads. Courtly gentle
men—shy ladies—fine talk—piano solos—those
were the days when San Francisco was too far from
the campus. Automobiles were an uncertain mode
of transportation, and pleasant evenings had to be
improvised at home.
For the university man who wants something a
little better than the average we are showing a
selection of Famous Hickey-Freeman clothes for
Fall and Winter.
The latest designs, colors, and fabrics, coupled
with Hickey-Freeman tailoring make these suits
the epitome of fashion and durability. The Hickey-
Freeman-dressed man is above reproach in matters
of apparel.
Priced from $55.00
