# CARDS, TROJANS FACE DANGER IN NORTHERN TEAMS
## Crippled Stanford Varsity To Have Trouble Stopping Rejuvenated Husky Squad Flu May Keep Don Williams Out of W.S.C. Game; Jones Prepared to Use Duffield 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Saturday's football schedule for the
Coast Conference appeared three
weeks ago to contain setups for both
Stanford and Southern California, the
Cards meeting Washington's Huskies
and the Trojans playing Washington
State. But with fate twisting the
strings from behind a screen, these
same contests have developed into
•clashes that may have a lot to do
with the championship this year.
The Thundering Herd, now tied
with California for the lead, seemed
to have a cinch game with the Cou
gars, but with the Northerners in bet
ter condition now than they have
been since the season started, it
looks like the Trojans will have a
tough opponent on their hands.
Williams in Hospital
To make matters worse for U.S.C.,
"Dynamic" Don Williams may not be
«ble to play Saturday. He has been
in (he hospital several days with the
flu and is not expected to be well in
lime for the fray, according to re
ports from Los Angeles, which may
or may not be discounted as Jones'
"'psychological pessimism."
Tn the event that Williams is out
■of the lineup, a sophomore quarter
back, Marshall Duttield, triple-threat
man, will take his place. However,
Jones has built his team around Wil
liams and the Herd will at a loss
without his carrying the ball, passing
punting]
The Cardinals meet the Huskies in
what previously lookeu like a sure
thing for Stanford, but which has
changed its complexion considerably
in the last two weeks. Tiny Thorn
hill, line coach, saw the Huskies sur
prise the California Bears last Satur
day in the North by holding them to I
a six-point margin after outplaying
them for the best part of the game, j
It is Thornhill's opinion that the in
vaders are capable of staging a real
battle against Stanford, even pressing
the Cards to win.
Stanford Men Injured
Local fans await news concerning
the men who will be able to play
Saturday. Stanford has again been hit i
with an unlucky streak of sickness j
and injuries. Tiny Sellman, giant [
lirst-string tackle, lias been in the
hospital with the same malady that
has afflicted Don Williams. Walt
Heinecke is expected to play in spite
of the handicap of an injured shoul- i
der.
Herb Fleishhacker is suffering with
a bad knee, and Joe Bush and Hodge
Davidson, both ends, have weak
ankles as a result of injuries received
in the U.S.C. and Santa Clara games. :
To offset the possible loss of these 1
men, two other ends, Dick Worden
and Johnny Preston will again be !
available for grid services after a
long period of absence with injuries
received earlier in the season.
