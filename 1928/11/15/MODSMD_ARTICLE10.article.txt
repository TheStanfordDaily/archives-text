## 
### 
"Dinosaurs have become known to
the general public only within the
last thirty years," stated Dr. William
Diller Matthew last night in his talk
on "Dinosaurs and the Age of Rep
tiles" in the Assembly Hall. "Even
now, the great variety of this species
is not generally realized."
Dr. Matthew compared the appear
ance and habits of the different
groups of these reptiles which "dis
appeared from the earth sixty million
years ago." His talk was accompanied
by slides showing the skeletons
which have been dug up, and which
are now in eastern museums. Dr.
Matthew illustrated by these slides
the growth of these dinosaurs during
the age of reptiles. In describing the
dinosaurs' appearance, Dr. Matthew
remarked that it was not so much a
surprise that they became extinct,
but that they ever came into exis
tence.
Dr. Matthew brought his lecture to
a close with an observation on the
importance of the recent discoveries
made by Dr. Andrews in Mongolia.
"His discoveries of nests of dino
saur eggs," he concluded, "has thrown
a great deal of light upon the habits
and family life of ( these prehistoric
animals."
