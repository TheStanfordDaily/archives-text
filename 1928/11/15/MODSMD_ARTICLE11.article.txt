nia series coming up Saturday morn
ing at 10:30 o'clock the freshman
soccer squad will have a chance to
avenge its defeat of last week. In
the first contest of the series last
week, the frosh were downed 7 to 3,
but it is the general belief that they
will have a chance to take this game
on their home field.

practicing since the opening of their
school in August while the local 1932
men started October 1. One man on
the Berkeley squad proved to be an
experienced player, making all seven
of their goals by himself. If the fresh
men can guard against this man,
their chances of winning are con
sidered much better.

sell Smith was chosen to lead the
frosh as captain of the team. Smith

but, according to the coaches, has
proved a hard worker, and has shown
himself willing to learn the game and
play hard.
