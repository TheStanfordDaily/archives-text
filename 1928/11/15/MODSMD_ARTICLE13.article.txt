# COUNT 108 DEAD IN SHIP TRAGEDY; PROBE IS ORDERED
## Continue Hunt For Victims; Charges of Inefficiency Denied by Crew 
### Associated Press 
With reports practically completed,
| the extent of the dead and injured
list of the Vestris, Lamport & Holt
liner which sank in a Monday morn
ing storm 240 miles off the Virginia
Capes, is nearing completion.
One rescue ship landed in New
j York yesterday with 148 survivors,
4G of them passengers. The French
tanker Myriam arrived off New York
with 64 more. In addition, the battle
ship Wyoming is steaming toward
Hampton Roads with 8 rescued.
Three destroyers neared New York,
bearing 13 bodies. Meanwhile three
coast guard destroyers remain off the
capes in hopes of finding survivors or
bodies. Experienced seamen place lit
tle hope in their success.
Captain Scored
The majority of the surviving pas
sengers were seemingly unanimous in I
charges against Captain William J.
Carey and his officers and crew of
indecision, delay, and inefficiency.
If help had been promptly sought,
(hey said, the 108 persons now dead j
would be living still. If the crew had |
known how to manage the lifeboats i
many would have been saved, they
thought, even with the SOS call being
sent as late as it was.
Probe Will Start
These are charges which United
States Attorney Tuttle announced to
day that he will begin to investigate
tomorrow, but Captain Carey himself i
will never be called to answer them, j
For after seeing the women and
children under his care dumped into '
a boiling sea from shattered lifeboats, '
his passengers and crew leaping into ;
the waves from the foundering ship, :
£nd feeling the bridge on which he i
stood sinking beneath his feet, Cap-1
tain Carey, one of his stewards said,
jumped into the water without a life- I
belt, though there were plenty to be
had.
Officials of the line declined to an
swer the passengers' charges pend
ing a thorough investigation of all
concerned, or to hazard any estimate
of what had caused the disaster until
all possible evidence had been taken.
Explanations for the disaster come
readily from passengers, crew, and
rescuers. The first statement with
any sort of official backing is that
the disasters was caused when crated
automobiles and other cargo, shifted
by the heavy seas, crashed through a
bulkhead.

One rescue ship landed in New
j York yesterday with 148 survivors,
4G of them passengers. The French
tanker Myriam arrived off New York
with 64 more. In addition, the battle
ship Wyoming is steaming toward
Hampton Roads with 8 rescued.
Three destroyers neared New York,
bearing 13 bodies. Meanwhile three
coast guard destroyers remain off the
capes in hopes of finding survivors or
bodies. Experienced seamen place lit
tle hope in their success.
Captain Scored
The majority of the surviving pas
sengers were seemingly unanimous in I
charges against Captain William J.
Carey and his officers and crew of
indecision, delay, and inefficiency.
If help had been promptly sought,
(hey said, the 108 persons now dead j
would be living still. If the crew had |
known how to manage the lifeboats i
many would have been saved, they
thought, even with the SOS call being
sent as late as it was.
Probe Will Start
These are charges which United
States Attorney Tuttle announced to
day that he will begin to investigate
tomorrow, but Captain Carey himself i
will never be called to answer them, j
For after seeing the women and
children under his care dumped into '
a boiling sea from shattered lifeboats, '
his passengers and crew leaping into ;
the waves from the foundering ship, :
£nd feeling the bridge on which he i
stood sinking beneath his feet, Cap-1
tain Carey, one of his stewards said,
jumped into the water without a life- I
belt, though there were plenty to be
had.
Officials of the line declined to an
swer the passengers' charges pend
ing a thorough investigation of all
concerned, or to hazard any estimate
of what had caused the disaster until
all possible evidence had been taken.
Explanations for the disaster come
readily from passengers, crew, and
rescuers. The first statement with
any sort of official backing is that
the disasters was caused when crated
automobiles and other cargo, shifted
by the heavy seas, crashed through a
bulkhead.
With reports practically completed,
| the extent of the dead and injured
list of the Vestris, Lamport & Holt
liner which sank in a Monday morn
ing storm 240 miles off the Virginia
Capes, is nearing completion.
