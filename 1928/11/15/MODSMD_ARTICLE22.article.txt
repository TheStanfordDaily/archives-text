Now the Sky and Other Poems. By
Mark Van Doren. (New York:
Albert & Charles Boni, 1928. $2.)
A recent poetry critic said that
heart had given way to mind in much
of our modern poetry. In line with
this we venture to say, hoping that
our inability will not be dubbed too
amateurish, that there are two gen
eral classifications of poetry.
One kind pours straight from the
heart, and then appeals directly to
the emotions of the reader through
his heart. Another type comes either
from the mind of the writer, or in
directly from the heart through the
mind.
What we are trying to say is that
Mark Van Doren feels in his heart,
but. his verse is put through a modify
ing mental process before it mater
ializes.
Particularly good are the pictures
conjured by Van Doren; for instance,
"Death is a tall horse
With large white feet,
Coming on a slow walk
Down tae long street."
Variations are plentiful from one
page to the next in this enjoyable
little volume; sun and shadow, seri
ousness and philosophical unconcern.
These two selections in diverging
moods can illustrate:
PHILOSOPHER'S LOVE SONG
"My one lovo has lighter loves,
And taller ones and merrier.
Still my love has less than I,
Who having her, have only her.
Having her, who has those others —
Him, and him, and flowers, and
horses —
Having her. is having sometimes
Jealousies and loud remorses,
Which to punish with her eyes
She turns her head, as if to see
What is to see —and, stepping lightly,
Come those loves more light than me.
Having me that have no other,
She lias others; but the sum
Of all her halves is less than my
One that is compendium."
WE COME TOO LATE
" —Peace, peace?—
The old man said —
There are two kinds of mortal peace,
And not another that I know.
There was the time
Before your birth,
And there will be a time as long
Commencing neatly with your death.
Each is deep
And each is wide,
And each is empty—which is cause,
From what I know, to call it peace.
'—Not to know,
Or to have known
And to remember these, he said,
Are all (hat be; and peace is either."
The casual poetry reader will
notice that some of Van Doren'w
verse is hard to grasp. It must be
read over and over before its signifi
cance suddenly dawns. Whether this
Is a virtue or a fault we do not know.
A propor appreciation of Mark Van j

Doren was given by Joseph Wood
Krutch when he said, "Mr. Mark Van
Doren belongs to the group of those
who choose to deal with things seem
ingly calm not because they fly from
passion, but because by discovering
it in unsuspected places they reveal
the boundless excitement which all
living affords those who are capable
of appreciating it. It is his peculiar
distinction to have written major
poetry upon what seems to be minor
themes." —Clifford F. Weigle.
