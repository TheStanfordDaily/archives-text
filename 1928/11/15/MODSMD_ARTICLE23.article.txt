# BOOKS ON CHINA
## 
### 
A number of new books on China
have been placed on the shelves at
the library and offer a variety of
factual and imaginary material for
the understanding of that mystic
country.
William E. Griffis, filled since boy
hood with a desire to know the Chi
nese mind, has recently published a
thoroughly humanized history of
China and her people, beautifully il
lustrated, and right up-to-date—"The
Story of China."
"What and Why in China," by Paul
Hutchinson, is a little volume that
immediately catches the eye with its
brilliant binding of Chinese red. It
is a brief, concise exposition of pres
ent-day conditions in China, with at
tendant maps; and concludes with a
four-and-a-half-page chapter, "In a
Nutshell," which is a salvation to
those who want to know what mod
ern China is all about, without read
ing volumes.
Interesting also are the twin books
on Chinese literature by Professor
Giles of the LTniversity of Cambridge.
"Gems of Chinese Prose" contains es
says on such as '"Against Drunken
ness," and "An Absent Husband";
proclamations of methods of punish
ment; tales of the great Chinese
teachers; anonymous allegories; and
numerous fables. In "Gems from Chi
nese Poetry" are verses from wise
advisory pieces to ditties like this one
of the 6th century:
"Indulgence in the flowing bowl
Impedes the culture of the soul;
And yet when all around me swill
Shall I alone be sober still?"
A Frenchman, too, Emile Hove
lakue, has been sufficiently stimulated
by that country to write "China"—an
internal, external, ancient, and mod
ern survey. Other additions to this
group include: P. T. Etherton's
"China: The Facts," a last-minute re
view of present-day conditions; "The
History of Chinese Philosophy," by
D. T. Suzuki, dealing with Confucian
ism, Taoism, Buddhism, the beliefs
of other great teachers, Chinese eth
ics, and religion; and a volume on
the astronomical, cosmological, and
phyeico-philosophical speculations of
the Chinese and their analogies and
personifications—"The World Concep
tion of the Chinese" by Alfred Forke.

country.
William E. Griffis, filled since boy
hood with a desire to know the Chi
nese mind, has recently published a
thoroughly humanized history of
China and her people, beautifully il
lustrated, and right up-to-date—"The
Story of China."
"What and Why in China," by Paul
Hutchinson, is a little volume that
immediately catches the eye with its
brilliant binding of Chinese red. It
is a brief, concise exposition of pres
ent-day conditions in China, with at
tendant maps; and concludes with a
four-and-a-half-page chapter, "In a
Nutshell," which is a salvation to
those who want to know what mod
ern China is all about, without read
ing volumes.
Interesting also are the twin books
on Chinese literature by Professor
Giles of the LTniversity of Cambridge.
"Gems of Chinese Prose" contains es
says on such as '"Against Drunken
ness," and "An Absent Husband";
proclamations of methods of punish
ment; tales of the great Chinese
teachers; anonymous allegories; and
numerous fables. In "Gems from Chi
nese Poetry" are verses from wise
advisory pieces to ditties like this one
of the 6th century:
"Indulgence in the flowing bowl
Impedes the culture of the soul;
And yet when all around me swill
Shall I alone be sober still?"
A Frenchman, too, Emile Hove
lakue, has been sufficiently stimulated
by that country to write "China"—an
internal, external, ancient, and mod
ern survey. Other additions to this
group include: P. T. Etherton's
"China: The Facts," a last-minute re
view of present-day conditions; "The
History of Chinese Philosophy," by
D. T. Suzuki, dealing with Confucian
ism, Taoism, Buddhism, the beliefs
of other great teachers, Chinese eth
ics, and religion; and a volume on
the astronomical, cosmological, and
phyeico-philosophical speculations of
the Chinese and their analogies and
personifications—"The World Concep
tion of the Chinese" by Alfred Forke.
