# The 						Bullsession

### IN VINO VERITAS 
Although the quaint old custom of
becoming pleasantly spiff licated is
now considered a relic of bygone
days; and whereas the authorities
frown upon—nay, even chide —old-
fashioned folk who persist in per
petuating the custom; and although
with the arrival of Prosperity the
one-time refrain, "Father, dear father,
come home with me now!" has
changed to "Father, dear father, let's
see Clara Bow!"; nevertheless it is a
sad fact that there are still people
who simply cannot imbibe ginger ale
without diluting it a trifle.
Such being the case, it seems too
bad that science has not devoted
more attention to the study of spif
flicates; for, in all seriousness, such
a study could reveal many facts
about the human brain, singular and
piural.
Many psychologists liken intoxica
tion to the dream state, because, un
der the influence of alcohol, most of
the person's perceptions and inhibi
tions are removed, and his reactions
express more nearly than at other
times his true personality. The ma
jority of dreams, when analyzed, are
found to be expressions of unfulfilled
wishes; therefore it may be seen that
in many cases the things which an
inebriate does (things which he would
not do when sober) are actually those
things which he secretly wishes to
do when in an upright and law-abid
ing position.
The types of drunkards are legion.
For example, there is the spift'licate

who insists upon laughing at every
thing and everybody; and there is
his antithesis, the oird who weeps
voluminously about harsh conditions
for working girls. A retiring gentle
man, after engulfing his third, is like
ly to become a cross between a na
tional broadcast and a Barbary pi
rate; while the once mouselike little
lady, suddenly a Mistiiiguette, dances
gayly for her admiring public. Then
we have the ordinarily gentle fellow
who pokes his best friend in the jaw
because his tie does not match his
socks; or, if you prefer, the very
cautious gentleman who becomes en
tirely unmanageable, rushes in where
angels and policemen fear to tread,
and usually awakens on the inside,
looking out.
All of which merely goes to show
that each of us has hidden traits,
peculiar unto himself, which, if
studied, would aid him to understand
himself the better. If it so happens
that this person now and then insists
upon becoming a bit too old-fashioned
in a liquid sort of way, he might as
well turn amateur scientist at such
times and observe how his personal
wheels work.
It may be that the whole idea is
impracticable, and that abuses would
creep in; that the confirmed toper,
not as yet imbued with the true scien
tific attitude, might remark, "Boy,
I'm going out tonight and get roar
ingly psychoanalyzed!" But anyhow,
there is a wide field for research in
line with the discovery, made long,
long ago, that in VINO there is
VERITAS. —Winston Norman.

do when in an upright and law-abid
ing position.
The types of drunkards are legion.
For example, there is the spift'licate

who insists upon laughing at every
thing and everybody; and there is
his antithesis, the oird who weeps
voluminously about harsh conditions
for working girls. A retiring gentle
man, after engulfing his third, is like
ly to become a cross between a na
tional broadcast and a Barbary pi
rate; while the once mouselike little
lady, suddenly a Mistiiiguette, dances
gayly for her admiring public. Then
we have the ordinarily gentle fellow
who pokes his best friend in the jaw
because his tie does not match his
socks; or, if you prefer, the very
cautious gentleman who becomes en
tirely unmanageable, rushes in where
angels and policemen fear to tread,
and usually awakens on the inside,
looking out.
All of which merely goes to show
that each of us has hidden traits,
peculiar unto himself, which, if
studied, would aid him to understand
himself the better. If it so happens
that this person now and then insists
upon becoming a bit too old-fashioned
in a liquid sort of way, he might as
well turn amateur scientist at such
times and observe how his personal
wheels work.
It may be that the whole idea is
impracticable, and that abuses would
creep in; that the confirmed toper,
not as yet imbued with the true scien
tific attitude, might remark, "Boy,
I'm going out tonight and get roar
ingly psychoanalyzed!" But anyhow,
there is a wide field for research in
line with the discovery, made long,
long ago, that in VINO there is
VERITAS. —Winston Norman.
Although the quaint old custom of
becoming pleasantly spiff licated is
now considered a relic of bygone
days; and whereas the authorities
frown upon—nay, even chide —old-
fashioned folk who persist in per
petuating the custom; and although
with the arrival of Prosperity the
one-time refrain, "Father, dear father,
come home with me now!" has
changed to "Father, dear father, let's
see Clara Bow!"; nevertheless it is a
sad fact that there are still people
who simply cannot imbibe ginger ale
without diluting it a trifle.
Such being the case, it seems too
bad that science has not devoted
more attention to the study of spif
flicates; for, in all seriousness, such
a study could reveal many facts
about the human brain, singular and
piural.
Many psychologists liken intoxica
tion to the dream state, because, un
der the influence of alcohol, most of
the person's perceptions and inhibi
tions are removed, and his reactions
express more nearly than at other
times his true personality. The ma
jority of dreams, when analyzed, are
found to be expressions of unfulfilled
wishes; therefore it may be seen that
in many cases the things which an
inebriate does (things which he would
not do when sober) are actually those
things which he secretly wishes to
do when in an upright and law-abid
ing position.
