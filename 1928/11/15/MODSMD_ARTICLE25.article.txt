The Editor, Sir:
"The melancholy days have come,
The Saddest of the year,
The days of wailing winds and
naked woods,
And," —MUD, MUD, MUD.
With a light rain the campus has
again turned to mud. It is tulip plant
ing time on the Farm. Students who
employ the God-given means of trans
portation are slipping and sliding,
wading and wallowing, skiiing and
skidding to and from classes. They
who ride have little to fear of ruined
shoes or exposure to colds or flu. But
what of those who walk?
Yes, we need garages to protect the
health and complexion of our equip
pages, but what of the health, cloth
ing, and convenience of more human
things?
There are cowpatlis on this campus
that should be cement walks. For
example, there is a path than runs
diagonally across the plot behind the
Library from the center of the Hall
section to the southwest corner of
the Quad. Student pedestrians living
in Toyon, Branner, and Encina, per
haps 700 of them, tramp over this
path several times a day. In dry sea
sons they scuff their shoes and stum
ble over rocks and dust; in wet sea
sons they tread through an avalanche
of mud.
A trifling matter for a few to en
dure, but multiply the hardship by
the number of students who have to
use this path as the only reasonable
way to reach their destination.
Mr. Comptroller, let's have fewer
tulips if we have to, and more cement
or hoard walks. Picture post-cards re
veal displays of tulips to visitors and
tourists, but they give no evidence of
the health, tempers, and shoes of
Stanford students. —"A Pedestrian."
The Editor, Sir:
Unannounced cuts in eight o'clock
classes are one of the most deplor
able features of student life. Some
thing really constructive should be
dc.ne about it.

When conscientious and ambitious !
students force themselves out of the l
soft comforts of a warm bed to go :
forth into the cold dampness of these !
wintry mornings, their efforts should j
be rewarded. It's not that the cuts j
are deplorable; they, in fact, are i
splendid, but the insidious thing |
about them is that there's always the |
worrying torture of uncertainty j
whether to attend class or not.
A remarkable suggestion has been
brought to light in regard to this j
problem.
Why not print in the Daily each 1
morning a list of the classes in which !
8 o'clock cuts are to be given? The \
announcements could be handed in
up to 11 o'clock of the night before '
the class, and thus the professors
would not be inconvenienced by any
time limit. If the plan were a success,
it could easily be applied to nine
o'clocks, and even gradually extended
to all classes.
This suggestion, worthwhile as it
is, would perform a double duty. Not j
only would it solve a problem ex
tremely annoying to the mentally ex- J
cellent students of the University,
but it would encourage and promote
better understanding of student and
world activities by a greatly increased
perusal of the Stanford Daily.
