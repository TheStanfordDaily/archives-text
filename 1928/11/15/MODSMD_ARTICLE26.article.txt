November 14th—
j To the Daily office for the better
part of this day, inasmuch as I did
have lunch with one of the night
editors a few days ago, and he did
explain that if I came back to try
outing, In spite of the discrepancies
-' of my rating, I might still have
I chances of making the staff. And so
did spend much time and many hours
reading proof, sweeping the office,
and answering the phone, and listen
ing to the jokes of the great men of
the staff.

To wondering much how good the
Lord lias been to the freshmen this
I year, for their bonfire is surely in
little danger with this contemporary
j weather. For not even the whole
I ward of Agnew's incendiary maniacs
r could succeed in lighting the pile of
t wood this week. Which must be a
- good omen, and very encouraging to
. the first-year men who like to sleep
o' nigths.
