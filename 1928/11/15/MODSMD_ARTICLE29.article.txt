# REVEAL DATA ON ORGANIC LIFE OF RARE SPECIMENS
## Four Stanford Professors Return From Expedition To Utah Lakes 
### 
"Organisms are alive that should
not be," believes Professor George
James Peirce of the Department of
Botany, concerning the findings of a
group of four Stanford professors on
their annual trip for the purpose of
btudying plant and animal life in ex
traordinary environments.
These professors — Professor Ern
est Gale Martin, of the Physiology
Department; Professor Morgan Smith,
of the Botany Department; Professor
Laurence B. Becking, of the Hopkins
Marine Station; and Professor Peirce
of the Botany Department—yesterday
returned from this year's investiga
tion which was held on the shores of
the Great Salt Lake.
The group was received by the
U.S. Biological Survey and provided
with transportation for water, land,
and mud. "The Mud Queen," a craft
made exclusively for mud travel, and
propelled by paddles operated by a
gasoline engine, towed their motor
boat at 15 miles an hour over miles
of marsh with only an inch of water
on the surface.
"The Salt Lake region is, in my
opinion, one of the most interesting
in the country," continued Professor
Peirce, "because on the very sides of
the surrounding mountains, one can
see the shore marks of the great pre
historic lake, Bonneville Lake, which
extended for thousands of square
miles between the Rockies and the
Sierras."
Among the trips that these same
men have taken annually at the end
of the dry season was one to the salt
lakes just east of the Sierra Nevadas
—Owen Lake and Searles Lake. At
the latter, the group was able to
drive in automobiles over the surface
of the lake, which was solid salt.
These extremely super-saturated
brines are all the habitats of plant
and animal life, and it is the purpose
of the trips to solve, if possible, the
problem of these astounding sur
vivals.
"This investigation is in an early
stage, of course," concluded Professor
Peirce, "but we expect that when we
have completed the biological, physi
cal, and chemical examinations of
the material which we brought back
with us, we will have gone one step
further toward the explanation."

The group was received by the
U.S. Biological Survey and provided
with transportation for water, land,
and mud. "The Mud Queen," a craft
made exclusively for mud travel, and
propelled by paddles operated by a
gasoline engine, towed their motor
boat at 15 miles an hour over miles
of marsh with only an inch of water
on the surface.
"The Salt Lake region is, in my
opinion, one of the most interesting
in the country," continued Professor
Peirce, "because on the very sides of
the surrounding mountains, one can
see the shore marks of the great pre
historic lake, Bonneville Lake, which
extended for thousands of square
miles between the Rockies and the
Sierras."
Among the trips that these same
men have taken annually at the end
of the dry season was one to the salt
lakes just east of the Sierra Nevadas
—Owen Lake and Searles Lake. At
the latter, the group was able to
drive in automobiles over the surface
of the lake, which was solid salt.
These extremely super-saturated
brines are all the habitats of plant
and animal life, and it is the purpose
of the trips to solve, if possible, the
problem of these astounding sur
vivals.
"This investigation is in an early
stage, of course," concluded Professor
Peirce, "but we expect that when we
have completed the biological, physi
cal, and chemical examinations of
the material which we brought back
with us, we will have gone one step
further toward the explanation."
