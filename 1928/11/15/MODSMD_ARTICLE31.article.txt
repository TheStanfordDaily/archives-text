# ALBERT PETERSON PICTURES SHOWN IN ART GALLERY
## 
### 
A collection of thirty-nine photo
graphs by Albert Peterson is now on
exhibition in the Stanford Art Gal
lery. Peterson is an artist photogra
pher whose work is a complete reve
lation of the fact that photography
has now entered the field of line arts.
Many moods are expressed in the
pictures. The simplicity of children,
the charm of women, and the sin
cerity of men, are shown in the
portraits, while the multiple changes
of nature are seen in the landscapes.
Composition of curves and forms is
emphasized in the figure studies. The
versatility of Peterson is clearly
presented by the variety and scope
of the subjects in the exhibition.
This collection of photographs can
