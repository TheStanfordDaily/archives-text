# VICINITY TO SEE METEORIC SPECTACLE
## Tonight's Phenomenon of Shooting Stars Takes Place Only Once Every Thirty-Three Years 
### REID BRIGGS 
Tonight there will take place the
most brilliant spectacle of shooting
stars which this generation will have
an opportunity to see. If it does not
rain, Stanford students will see a
phenomenon which they will remem
ber for the rest of their lives, for
tonight the earth moves into the
astral region of the Leonid meteors.
The Leonid group is a stream of
meteors whose orbit is around the
sun. They may be seen at this time
every year, but they reach the maxi
mum frequency at intervals of 33
years. Historical records for the past
1000 years of the spectacular showers
of these meteors show that this 33-
year recurrence is quite accurate.
Records have been found in early
Chinese, Arabic, and European an
nals of the Leonid showers as far
back as 2500 years or more.
These meteors speed through inter
planetary apace at temperatures" of
about 400 degrees below zero. When
they enter the earth's atmosphere the
friction of the air upon their surfaces
heats them to an intensely high tem
perature. They are usually consumed
before striking the ground.
The early reports of meteoric
showers describe their light as being
of the brilliance of daylight. Supersti
tious people of mediaeval times
thought the apeparances of these

speeding sparks presaged Doomsday,
and knelt in prayer. Whenever any
heavenly disturbance occurred, loud
wails arose from the negroes on
southern plantations during the days
of slavery in the United States.
