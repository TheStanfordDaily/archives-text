EVANSTON, Nov. 14. (I.P.)â€”That
the university co-ed is not so frivo
lous as she is painted, is revealed in
the results of a test made by E. H.
Hahne, dean of the College of Liberal
Arts at Northwestern University.
Hahne sent questionnaires JLo 500 wo
men at Evanston, and the replies may
be taken as a fair indication of what
things college women regard as
luxuries.
