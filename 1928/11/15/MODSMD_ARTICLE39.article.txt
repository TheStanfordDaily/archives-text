# APPEAL MADE TO THE FRESHMEN TO GET TO WORK ON THE BONFIRE
## 
### EDWARD PECK 
Guarding the big bonfire in a cold
rain from 2 to 8 o'clock in the morn
ing is not much fun, according to a
hardy bunch of freshmen which has
rallied to the call of the somewhat
disgruntled Bonfire Committee during
the last two or three nights. A driz
zling rain serves us quite a damper
upon the spirits, in the general opin
ion; but according to the decisive ver
dict of the committee, the big wooden
structure, upon which depends to
such an appreciable degree the type
of spirit needed to win the Big Game,
must not be left for a moment to the
chance of premature combustion at
the handb of some plotting demon.
It may seem unnecessary precaution
to maintain a guard when rain is
pouring steadily down, but if the in
side of the great pile is examined, a
considerable proportion of the roof
of the spacious cavity at the bottom
known as "(he tunnel" will appear to
be bone dry. It would be an easy
matter with aid of a liberal sprinkling
ot gasoline to cause considerable
damage by lighting.
At any rate Dick Brodrick. head of
the Bonfire Committee, and Dave
Jacobson and Leon Levi of the Rally
Committee, have decided that no
chances will be taken. Consequently,
large watch fires may be seen each
night flaring through the mist, and
fiimsy box structures are thrown to
gether by the watchers in an attempt
to keep at least partially dry. After
all there are some pleasant features
about an honest-to-goodness bull ses
sion around a big fire, especially when
there are a few wieners and marsh
mallows to warm the stomach. It's
great stuff to tell the kids about,
some day, anyhow.
So Dick Brodrick is perfectly satis
lied with the guard, but he somewhat
gruffly adds that there isn't yet just
a great deal to be guarded, and prob
ably won't be unless the class of '32
takes a greatly improved attitude to
ward its traditional contribution to
Big Game preparations.
"The frosh don't seem to care a lot
whether it is built or not," said
Jacobson yesterday afternoon. "The
bonfire belongs to '32 and not to the
Bonfire or Rally committees. When I
was a frosh the fellows seemed to
like to turn out, and pulled big lum
ber carts around as if they meant it.
I can't understand what's wrong, but

the thing has to be finished by Tues- j
day night."
In addition to considerably more
recruits, what Dick Brodrick would
particularly like to have at his dis
posal is a group of automobiles to ;
haul wagons about Palo Alto in a
search for every box and crate that
can be had.
"That is the kind of stuff we need
to fill in with," said the construction
boss, and he added none too cheer- j
fuily: "If '32 poops out on us this J
year, it will be the first class that
ever has."
TURIN, Italy, Nov. 14. (TP) â€”Large
families here have all the fun, the
envious might say. Families with
seven or more children are allowed
to ride free in local trolleys and are
given sizable cuts in both national
and local taxes. There are 997 such
families here, census figures show.
