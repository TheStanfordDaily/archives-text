# VARSITY OUT TO REPEAT SOCCER WIN OVER BEARS
## 
### 
Taking the first same of the Cali
fornia series last week 1-0, the var
sity soccer team will have another
chance to meet the Berkeley squad
Saturday at 1 o'clock on the local
field. In this second contest the var
sity will have the advantage of play*
1 :ng on its home field, and if it wins
1 this time, will regain the supremacy
over California which it had enjoyed
previous to the last two or three
years.
For the past two years the Califor
! nia varsity has won the series, but
previous to that Stanford was victor
in practically every annual contest
| with the Berkeley contestants.
In the absence of Coach Harry ;
Maloney, Ward Smith, a member of
! last year's varsity, has been directing
the team. Dispersed between frequent
; showers the team has taken some
: heavy practices. In last week's con
j test the men showed co-operation and
a certain unity in their playing which
has been lacking in previous games,
j and according to Maloney they played
! a better defensive game than Califor
nia with the fullbacks and goalkeeper
: playing their best.
