## 
### 
BOSTON, Nov. 15. The elec
tion of Herbert Hoover as president
was termed "a great victory" by Mrs.
Ella Alexander Boole in her address
as president of the National Women's
Christian Temperance Union at the
opening session of its 64th Conven
tion in Tremont Temple tonight.
"There were many issues," she said,
"but prohibition ranked first with wo
men and their interest in this cause
resulted in greatly increased registra
tion and in interest in the election.
There has never been a presidential
campaign in which women have taken
so active a part. The slogan 'Principle
Above Party' rallied the women of
the nation.
Praises W.C.T.U. Power
"We did not believe that enforce
ment would be bettered if placed in
the hands of its enemies, in the
hands of those who wanted to destroy
or nullify it. Therefore we entered
into politics with the single purpose
of electing a dry president and vice
president and dry members of Con
gress, that enforcement might be
placed in the hands of those who
wanted to make it a success and
legislation entrusted to a Congress
which would conserve the Eighteenth
Amendment and the Volstead Act.
"I hereby call upon the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union to mar
shal its organization and its depart
ments to discourage through a cam
paign of education the use of intoxi
cating liquor."
