# BOXING WORLD IS UPSET BY RECENT MEDICAL THEORY

### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 15. (£»)—' The
boxing world, jarred somewhat by a
scientific left hook, is still echoing
the effects of medical research into
the condition commonly known to the
ring as "punch drunkenness."
The revelations of Dr. Harrison S.
Martland, of Newark, N.J., in a re
cent issue of the American Medical
Association Journal, have developed
a widespread reaction in professional
boxing circles.
Stripped of medical terms, the
theory is that a blow or succession
of sharp blows on the jaw or head,
while not severe enough to injure the
skull, can cause pin-point hemorrhag
es in the working parts of the brain,
principally the portion where the
nerve springs that control the limbs
and other parts of the body bunch
together in the brain.
