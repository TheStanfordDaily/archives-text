# POINCARE UPHELD IN FIRST VOTE OF FRENCH CHAMBER
## 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 15. (JP)â€”' Twice today
the new Foincare government sub
mitted itself to the acid test of a vote
of confidence in the French Chamber
of Deputies, and twice it emerged
bolstered and unscathed, once by a
vote of 335 to 147, and at the close
of the debate by a vote of 330 to 129.
The first vote came when the So
cialists challenged the Premier's right
to alter the order of the day for the
leading of his new declaration of
principles, the Socialists inferring
that if it was put to a vote M. Poin
care could not obtain priority. The
Premier insisted on the vote and
made it a question of confidence. The
Chamber supported him overwhelm
ingly.
Both in the declaration of princi
ple and in his answers to interpella
tions regarding the declaration the
Premier made it clear that he con
sidered the reparations question the
most vital consideration in Europe
today. He did not touch on the war
debts problem, save indirectly, al
though it had been predicted he
would. A large part of his speech was
a discussion of internal policy as re
gards the budget and the stabiliza
tion of French currency.
