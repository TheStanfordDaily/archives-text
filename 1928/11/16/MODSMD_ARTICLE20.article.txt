# ARREST TWO IN COUNTERFEITING PLANT DISCOVERY
## 
### 
REDWOOD CITY, Nov. 15. (JP)â€”
Arrest of two men here today and
the subsequent discovery of a coun
terfeiting plant in San Jose led fed
eral officers to believe that activities
of a widespread ring of spurious coin
makers have been curbed.
The pair was alleged to have
passed four counterfeit dollar coins
on Redwood City merchants. When
arrested, police found a bag in their
car containing 25 of the coins.
When federal officers from San
Francisco questioned the two men,
they were directed to an apartment
house at 900 Ninth street, San Jose.
Here they found 6 dies and other ap
paratus for the manufacture of the
spurious coins. A tip on another plant
at Oakland was also received in the
search of the San Jose establishment.
