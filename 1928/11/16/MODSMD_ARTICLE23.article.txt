# POP TO START THREE SUBSTITUTE BACKFIELD MEN AGAINST HUSKIES
## Hoffman, Sims, Fleishhacker To Remain Out Of Game Unless New Combination Proves Unable To Cope With Powerful Washington Machine 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
DOP WARNER does not intend to start Captain Biff Hoffman, Bob Sims, or
Herb Fleishhacker in the game here tomorrow with the invading Wash
ington Huskies. According to the starting lineup announced last night by
Warner, Hoffman's place at fullback will be taken by Harlow Rothert; Spud
Lewis and Frank Wilton will be the starting halfbacks, and Chuck Smalling
will replace Fleishhacker at quarter.
The starting line will consist of Johnny Preston and Mush Muller, ends;
Artman and Sellman, tackles; Robesky and Post, guards; and A1 Cook, center.
Injuries are deemed largely responsible for the changes in the lineup.
Hoffman, Heinecke, and Fleishhacker are each nursing injuries received in
th Santa Clara fray last week. While being far from best condition now.

S>they will be available for service if
they are called.
With Lewis in the game and
Heinecke on the bench, the former
will call the plays for the Cards as
lias been customary since the Idaho
tilt.
Preston, still wearing a brace to
j protect his fractured arm, will see his
first bit of action since he was in
l jured seven weeks ago.
"A" or "B"
No one knows whether or not Pop
wil instruct his men to use formation
"B" tomorrow or continue to employ
[ the "A" formation exclusively as they
i did last week for the first time in
[ eight games. In all probability Pop
will reserve as many plays as pos
' sible for the Bears and Cadets. Cali
fornia and West Point will both have
scouts in the stands tomorrow as they
have in the last couple of Stanford
games. Knowing this, it will be the
Cards' intentions to conquer the Hus
kies without displaying any of War
ner's emergency plays which, in all
events, will be needed in the next
two games.
The Washington squad started the
season with only three lettermen.
From this raw bunch Enoch Bagshaw
has gradually built up a team that
promises to give the Redbirds plenty
of opposition. They have lost to Ore
gon, California, and Oregon State,
but have gained some valuable ex
perience in doing so.
Backfield To Be Watched
Spectators will particuarly have
their eyes on the game to see if the
Stanford backs can be depended upon
to hold on to the ball in the critical
moments, for that may be a deciding
factor in the Big Game. For another
thing, they will watch Chuck Carroll,
the Huskies' great halfback and lead
ing scorer on the Pacific Coast. The
speedy back has scored a total of 104
points this season, which places him
among the nation's leading high
scorers.
From the Northland comes the "re
port that the Purple-and-Gold outfit
has prepared a special collection of
new trick plays to be used for the
first time against the Cards.
While the Washington-Stanford
game is in progress here the Trojans
will be tussling with the Cougars in
Los Angeles. These two affairs, the
only Conference games of importance
scheduled for tomorrow, may unex
pectedly alter the league ratings.
Tomorrow will tell.
