# Utilities Regulation Pays Public Seven Times Over
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 15 (/P).â€”
The public receives $7 in lower rates on
public utilities service for every dollar
spent in regulation of the utilities, said a
report by the State Railroad Commission
today. This saving does not include the
saving which accrues from the refusal of
the commission to grant requested rate
increases, the report said.
