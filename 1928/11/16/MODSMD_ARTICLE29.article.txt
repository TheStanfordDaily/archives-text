# Captain Carey Admitted His Defeat
## 
### 
What a dramatic moment that must have been when Captain Wil
liam J. Carey of the S.S. Vcstris plunged into the seething waters of the
Atlantic as his ship took its last lurch and sank. The steward who preceded
him relates that his captain, scorning a life-preserver, stepped off into the
ocean as if having 110 care for his life.
Who would not have welcomed the oblivion of suicide had he been
responsible for the sinking of the ship ? A boat-load of women and children,
hanging perilously from the davits, had been crushed against the ship's
side, before Captain Carey's eyes. Passengers were strewn about in the
water; the frail lifeboats looked like cockle-shells. How could he face
these hundreds of people who might be saved along with him? Worse,
how could he face the images of the drowned which would besiege his
mind? Did he know his was the negligence which caused the sinking?
fie had not wanted to send an S.O.S. message for help; this was his last
trip: on the Vcstris, and at Buenos Aires he was to be transferred to the
new S.S. Voltaire, the crack ship of the Lamport & Holt line. He would
not mar his last voyage by asking assistance until he was desperate.
Then the seas won out. It was best that Captain Carey admitted to
them that he was beaten.
