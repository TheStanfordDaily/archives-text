We are having a veritable orgy of good feeling with U.S.C. The Daily
Trojan was elated with the sportsmanlike way in which Stanford took its
recent defeat, and quoted excerpts from the Daily which went to prove
to the Trojan student body how graciously we conceded them winners.
Then the Trojan concluded with a generous tribute to Herbert lloover:
Hoover is a man with world vision. He is an educated gentle
man, an organizer, a great engineer, both of material things and
human souls, a leader, and a great American citizen. He comes from
sturdy American stock, and has gotten to the top through hard
work, honest living, and sheer ability, about which he says little.
The world owes Stanford much for the training he got while 011 the
Palo Alto campus.
