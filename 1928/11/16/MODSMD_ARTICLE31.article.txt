# Exit The "Heap" From The Campus

The decrepit old automobile, formerly "collegiate," has been replaced
on the campus of Northwestern University by smart little roadsters and
trim, shiny closed cars, dispatches state. An explanation is offered by
a Northwestern man:
"When the high school students went in for electric cars the collegian
turned to the severe and dignified."
That is as true at Stanford as at Northwestern. In fact, we might
call it the collegiate cycle; college men take up some fad and it becomes
collegiate; high school students, anxious for sophistication and college
atmosphere, adopt the fad; whereupon the college man promptly drops
it. High school students might well note from this that they can never
be collegiate by the very nature of the thing, for 110 sooner do they adopt
college fads than the collegians abandon them.
Faking antique furniture has become a fine art in England, and a
prominent London collector has appealed for the establishment of a
"national museum of fakes." Americans are said to be the usual victims
of the fakers. Apparently the United States continues to bring prosperity
to John Bull.
