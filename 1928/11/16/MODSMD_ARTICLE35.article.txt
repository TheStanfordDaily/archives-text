# Campus Opinion

The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Norman's article on "Both Ends
of the Candle" will affect Stanford's
self-supporting element In different
ways. Some will toss their books in
the corner, take in a good movie, get
a good night's sleep, and flunk out at
tbc end of this quarter. They'll go out
into the world with a cynical atti
tude toward all things collegiate, and
if their children ever attend college
it will be in spite of their parents.
In the hope that I cau discount, a
part of that article I am going to
give the campus a few of the things
I have learned during six years of
Stanford life as a self-supporting stu
dent. Mr. Norman Is evidently on the
outside looking in, as he tries to gen
eralize on a situation of which he
knows nothing, since 1 learned a long
time ago, while attempting to try out
for the "Dippy" staff, that one has no
time for such amusement while liv
ing by the sweat of his brow.
First —do I come within his specifi
cations? Have I the right to voice an
opinion? I have never had less than
three different daily odd jobs, and
at one time I held down six! I learned
that working your way through Stan
ford necessitates earning at least
seventy-five dollars per month, in
cluding board and room and all ex
penses. With all this I have quite
painfully maintained a "C" average,
attended most campus productions
for amusement, and have enjoyed
constantly increasing good health.
Last year 1 discovered a young man
in a lumber camp of northern Cali
fornia. This fellow had never at
tended a high school, but our benevo
lent faculty saw fit to give him a
chance as a special, and he main
tained a "B" average during the en
tire school year, while he earned his
own expenses, and did not only his
lacking high school work, but first
year college work, as well.
This last summer I discovered an
other young man in the same circum
stances in Del Norte County, and he
now serves you with delicious "clioc
malts" in the Stanford Union between
classes, while he does commendable
work in his classes, in spite of the
fact that he spent most of October
in the Palo Alto Hospital with the
"flu."
And —does Mr. Norman presume to
insinuate that the faculty does not
know how to require that a student
get "something out of college"? Does
he think that the required "C" aver
age means nothing at all?
The only time I ever felt the misery
of discouragement—the only time I
ever felt like asking myself the ques
tion "Is it worth it?" was when the
University decided to commercialize
ccrtain concessions to its own finan

cial betterment, and under "compe
tent management" required that a
student work for LESS than 50 cents
an hour, against a precedent staunch
ly maintained by the appointment of
fice for many years.
In conclusion —Any fellow who
flunks out, feels sorry for himself,
and blames his misfortune in having
to earn his own way, is one of a
well-known type: He is the "tired
type"—born tired, and never got over
it! He is not one of the survivors
under Nature's rule of The Survival
of The Fittest. And I'm not taking
the word of my second cousin's
friend's friend, for that, either. I've
known some like that, and the rule
holds. —"Pinky" of Lagunita.

The Editor, Sir:
It is unbelievable that such a great
institution as Stanford, renowned for
its men, its teams, its rooting stunts,
and its fighting spirit, should be un
able to properly sing its inspiring
songs. The only song that is in any de
gree known is "Come Join the Band."
Organization and co-operation of ev
ery single person on the Stanford
campus is needed, especially during
the next two weeks, in order to en
able us to bring our songs and root
ing to somewhere near a par with our
rooting stunts and other far-famed
accomplishments.
Every student knows what is wrong
with us. Now what is needed is action
and lots of it. Since it would hardly
be possible to have a special assem
bly for the purpose of practicing, 1
would suggest that it would be ap
propriate to do so at the Washington
game.
But more important than practice
on the songs is the necessity of know
ing the words to the songs. If every
one knows the words, the tunes will
come easily, and much of the drag
and sloppiness which is so noticeable
now will be eliminated.
I hereby suggest that the Daily pub
lish the words to the Hymn, Giants
in Red, and Sons of the Stanford
Red. I would also suggest that the
various yells, together with the
names they are designated by by the
yell leaders when they announce
them, be published.
True, it is that most of us have
been able to secure at one time or
another the "Freshman Bible" but
during the arduous times of our schol
astic careers these have been mis
placed or lost and we have no ready
means of access to the words of our
songs and yells. I think this diffi
culty can be overcome to a great
degree by publishing the words in the
Daily.
Yours for lots of action and better
singing. —C. O. B. ( '29
