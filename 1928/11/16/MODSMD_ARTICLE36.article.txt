Farewell To Youth. By Storm Jame
son. (New York: Alfred A.
Knopf. 1928.)
"Farewell to Youth" is the work of a
young novelist, yet one who already
claims a wide circle of readers, for
Miss Jameson has written three
books in the last four years that have
been enthusiastically received.
This last book of hers is similar to
many of the books now Hooding the
market, books by very young authors
concerned primarily with problems
of youth. "Dusty Answer" is one of
the most popular examples of this
type. Those who liked "Dusty Answer"
will probably like "Farewell To
Youth," for something in Storm
Jameson's nocel subtly reminds one
of the former. The resemblance is not
a concrete nor even a very noticeable
one, except that youth figures so
largely in both.
"Dusty Answer" is the stronger
book, with more unity and more pur
pose. "Farewell to Youth" is loosely
put together, and the thread of the
story wanders, until, in the last chap
ters, it becomes so faint that it seems

lost entirely. The general effect of
the book is that of sadness and futil
ity. yet even this is not particularly
convincing. Feminine readers will
probably weep over it and enjoy it,
but I do not think it will appeal to a
man's mind.
A man will not find the picture of
a humble and devoted little Anne
waiting patiently hour after hour in
the rain for a man who has forgotten
her a very noble or touching one. A
woman undoubtedly will. Unhappy
marriages and unrequited love are two
of women's favorite subjects, and the
book is full of both.
Miss Jameson has great charm of
style, and she has drawn at least
three fascinating characters in her
book. They are the minor characters,
however. And at the end of the three
hundred or so pages one still fails to
understand why Nat loves the beau
tiful, selfish, empty-handed Denny so
passionately, or why Anne loves Nat,
both of which Miss Jameson urgently
insists on. In fact her main charac
ters are difficult to believe in all the
way through. â€”M. L. R.
