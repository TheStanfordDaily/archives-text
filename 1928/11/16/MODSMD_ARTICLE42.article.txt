# PLANS COMPLETE FOR TOYON CLUB DANCE TOMORROW
## Spanish Theme Featured in Decorations; Tapestries, Shawls Will Be Used 
### 
With final plans for the Toyon Club
informal dance to be given tomorrow
night completed, the dance commit
tee under the direction of Robert
Edgren is busily engaged in trans
forming the lobby and foyer of Toyon
Hall into an old Spanish ballroom.
The Spanish theme, which adapts
itself readily to the architectural de
sign of the hall, is being carried out
in the decorations, lighting, and
favors. A valuable exhibit of Spanish
tapestries and shawls from Casey's
in Encina is being worked into the
decorating scheme by the committee.
The mantle above the fireplace in
the ballroom is to be decorated with
a complete matador's outfit including
the cape, hat, and sword, while the
lighting is to be made effective by
using candles in mediaeval style.
The music, contrary to a previous
announcement, is to be furnished by
Gordon Heche and his Hotel Alameda
orchestra, an eight-piece organization.
The orchestra, as well as all other
officials of the dance, will be in Span
ish costume.
In the hall foyer, which will be il
luminated in subdued light of red and
orange hue, punch will be served
l'rom Spanish wine casks and red
loses will be distributed to all the
members of the fairer sex as they
enter.
The programs, which are of imita
tion parchment with the picture of a
knight in full armor on the cover and
the dances named with Spanish
words inside, may be obtained from
Herb Wenig on presentation of bids
today. The bids were all sold on the
second day of sale, one of the quick
est sell-outs that a Toyon dance com
mittee has ever had.
The chaperons for the dance will be
Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. E. R. W.
McCabe, Captain and Mrs. R. A. Gor
don, Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Farmer, and
Mrs. A1 Roth.
