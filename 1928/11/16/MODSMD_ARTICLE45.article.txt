# P.T.A. PRESENTS MARIONETTES IN PROGRAM TODAY
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Parent-Teacher As
sociation is presenting the Kegg-Gold
smith-Engle Marionettes at the As
sembly Hall this afternoon and eve
ning. This production is a combina
tion of graceful figures, charming
sets, and old folk songs.
Marionettes revive the most ancient
loim of drama in the world. They
played long before human actors ever
thought of appearing, and served as
an inspiration to human beings in
acting. Even today, the Japanese and
Italian actor must study the art of
pantomime and gestures from Marion
ettes, before he can be accepted on
the professional stage. Elizabeth Lee
Buckingham, in writing on the his
tory of puppets, says that "Tony
Sarg's lively little dramas, ostensibly
for the delectation of children, filled
his New York theatre with grown-ups
who had dutifully taken their chil
dren to the initial performance and
who later found all kinds of high
sounding reasons for taking them to
the second bill."
There will be an afternoon perform
ance of "Cinderella" at 3:30, and an
evening performance of "The Nightin
gale" at 8:15. The matinee prices are
50 cents and 75 cents, the evening
tickets are 50 cents and one dollar.
They may be purchased at the Stan
ford Bookstore.
