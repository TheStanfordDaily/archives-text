# FRESHMEN WILL MEET CALIFORNIA IN SOCCER GAME
## 
### 
With one game lost, the freshman
soccer team will meet the California
freshmen at 10:30 o'clock tomorrow
morning on the varsity field in the
second and last game of the series.
Last week the freshmen were de
feated 7 to 3 by the Berkeley frosh.
Tomorrow the 1932 men will be
playing on the home field, and with
the knowledge gained by the defeat
of last week, perhaps they will give
the Californians enough competition
to win the game. One man on the
California team showed much experi
ence in his playing in the first game,
taking the credit for their entire
score. Bert Weyl on the local frosh
team kicked over all three of the
points for his team.
