# STATE OFFICIALS CONSIDER BUREAU OF AERONAUTICS

### 
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 15.
siderable interest has been shown by
state officials at the capitol in the
suggestion to establish a state bureau
of aeronautics.
Governor C. C. Young has declared
that formation of the bureau is "in
evitable." Alexander R. Heron, di
rector of state finances, has said he
is vitaly interested but not prepared
to surmise as to what department, if
any, the new bureau should be at
tached. Bert B. Meek, director of pub
lic works, says that interest in avia
tfon is reflected in the report that
airplane factories are far behind their
orders. He claims that landing fields
must be located close to the city
centers in order to retain aviation's
reputation as a time-saver.
Frank G. Snook, director of the di
vision of motor vehicles, is "strong"
for state control of aviation. He has
not intimated what department he
thinks should assume the responsi
bility, but George Jenkins of his de
partment is engaged in the endeavor
to co-ordinate into workable form
various plans suggested.
In the meanwhile several legislators
are understood to be working on bills
tor introduction at the next legisla
ture. These are to provide for state
enforcement of existing federal avia
tion laws.
