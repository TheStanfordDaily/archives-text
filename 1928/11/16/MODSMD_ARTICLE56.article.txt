# CARNEGIE TECH BATHES NOTRE DAME IN FEATURED INTERSECTION CONTEST
## Nebraska Cornhuskers Face Pittsburgh; Yale Meets Princeton Eleven 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 15. (/P)â€” The
dope would indicate that those who
got slapped a year ago will do a
little slapping on their own hook
Saturday.
Yale's beatings by Army and Mary
land have pushed Princeton into the
favored position as Tiger and Dull
dog prepare for their 52nd clash at
Princeton. Princeton's record is
scarcely impressive, marred as it is
by ties with Virginia and Ohio State,
but at least the Tigers have avoided
defeat. Last year Yale beat Princeton
14-6.
Carnegie Record at Stake
Carnegie Tech and Notre Dame did
not meet last year but Knute Rockne
can tell his Hoosiers about a certain
November afternoon in Pittsburgh
iwo years ago when the Tartans
iramplod an undefeated Rockne team
into defeat, 19-0. Carnegie will be
staking the undefeatod record at
Cartier F-ield, South Bond, this Satur
day.
Cornell has the memory of a 53-7
beating to take into its coming battle
with Dartmouth, and the odds are no
worse than oven money that Gil
Dobie's squad can give the Indians
tuoir fourth successive defeat.
Williams Favored
Williams, now leading in the race
for the "Little Three" title, is the
experts' choice to down Amherst and
avenge a one-point defeat of last
year. Lafayette is conceded at least
an even chance of beating Penn State,
which trounced the Leopards, 40 to 6,
in 1927. Nebraska's undefeated Corn
huskers will remember their 21-13 de
feat at Pittsburgh last season when
they take the field at Lincoln against
the Panthers.
Georgetown, beaten for the first
time by the smart and tricky Carne
gie Tech eleven, has small hope of
repeating the 25-0 triumph it scored
over West Virginia; Buckuell will be
favored to turn the tables on Wash
ington and Jefferson, which won, 19-3
last year; Wesleyan should have little
trouble taking Bowdoin.
Penn Doped to Win
On the other hand, Pennsylvania
and Harvard are favored to repeat
the victories they scored over Colum
bia and Holy Cross, respectively, in
1927. Colgate and Syracuse, renew
ing an ancient feud at Syracuse, have
a 13-13 tie to play off. Navy, Brown,
ana Boston College will be rather
more than surprised if they don't ac
count for Loyola, of Maryland, New
Hampshire, and Canisius respective
ly. The llutgors-Lehigh battle looms
as an extremely evenly-contested
struggle, as does that between Grove

City and Villanova, both undefeated
but tied.
In view of Missouri's unimpressive
record in the Missouri Valley tliis
season, New York University, gener
ally conceded to have one of the best
teams in the East, will be a decided
favorite in this battle at the Yankee
Stadium, but Fordham will be an
equally decided underdog against un
defeated Detroit. Army should have
a romp against Carleton.
