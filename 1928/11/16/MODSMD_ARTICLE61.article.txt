# CALIFORNIA SOCCER TEAM MEETS CARD VARSITY TOMORROW
## Stanford Out to Cinch Series By Taking Second Victory 
### 
In the second contest of the three
game U.C. soccer series, the varsity
will play its only game on the local
field at 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
immediately preceding the Washing
ton football game. Last week the
team had a close battle, defeating
the Berkeley squad with a 1 to 0
score. On tomorrow's game depends
the victory of the series, for if the
varsity wins, it will once again re
gain the title which it has lost for
the past two years.
In the absence of Coach Harry Ma
loney, who left Tuesday for New
York, Ward Smith, a former varsity
player, has been instructing the men.
They have been holding stiff prac
tices the latter part of the week, but
bt fore that the rains prevented much
work.
Teamwork Praised
In the game last week, Maloney de
clared that the team played the best
game of the season, and if they can
show similar teamwork and co-opera
tion tomorrow with the advantage of
playing on the home field, it is gener
ally conceded that the Cards will
have a strong chance to take a sec
ond game from California.
The forward line has been working
on accurate passing and a unification
of the line in carrying the ball down
to the opponent's goal. The goal
keeper and fullbacks have been prac
ticing a defensive game in guarding
the goal from all types of offense.
The varsity will play the third and
last game of the series the morning
of the Big Game at Berkeley.
