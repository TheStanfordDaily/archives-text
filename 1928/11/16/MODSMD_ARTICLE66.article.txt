# DON WILLIAMS OUT OF S. C. LINEUP FOR COUGAR TILT; JUNES SHIFTS BACKFIELD
## Saunders, Duffield to Try Quarterback Position Against W.S.C. 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 15. (>P)â€” I The
versatile Russell Saunders, who has
played regularly on Coach Howard
Jones' University of Southern Cali
fornia football team at every position
in the backfield except quarterback,
will get his whack at that job next
Saturday against Washington State,
unless Don Williams sometime today
experiences one of those miraculous
recoveries you read about.
I
Don Williams, regular quarter,
| while scheduled to quit his hospital
I bed today, is not expected to play
| Saturday against the Cougars. He
j has been sick all week with influenza
i and still had a temperature last
! night, according to hospital attaches.
Duffield May Start
Marshall Duffield probably will
start at quarter. The blond, scrappy
sophomore has shown up well gener
ally this season as Williams' substi
tute.
Excepting Williams, Jones' men all
appear in good shape. Secret practice
has been in order all week and rumor
has it that the Trojan coach will
j spring a new offensive Saturday on
| the Washington Staters. Jeff Cravath
1 has been coaching the Spartans in
Cougar plays, as he saw them in the
| North, to give the varsity squad a
| chance to make plans of defense
against Coach Hollingbery's methods.
' Last night Jones used his reorgan
ized backfield combination again with
; Saunders at quarter, Edelson at full,
1 and Thomas and Marger as halfbacks.
Eight colleges of Southern Cali
j fornia are co-operating on a Latin
j American week November 13 to 16 to
! extend international goodwill and
I feeling.
