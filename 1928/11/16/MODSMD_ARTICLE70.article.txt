Here are four "Gentlemen of the
Pass" who come from widely sepa
rated areas of the country, but who,
if combined in one backfield, would
delight the heart of any coach. They
have also in common the fact that
they usually play quarterback.
"Spud" Lewis, of Stanford Univer
sity, was a quarter two years ago i
and sort of dropped out of sight last j
reason, but in the game with Idaho
on October 19th last, "Pop" Warner
put him in as a halfback and he pro
ceeded to tear through the Vandals
for four touchdowns in the second

half, and converted each one. (Each
touchdown, not each Vandal!) He
was simply unstoppable, according to
"Brick" Morse, former Princeton All
i
! American, and became overnight the
I sensation of the Pacific Coast Con
ference.
Two of the best passers in the
country today are Howard Harpster,
! of Carnegie Tech, and Hal Baysinger,
; of Syracuse. They take to the air like
a Friedman, an Oberlander, or a
Muller, and it's a pity that Tech and
Syracuse don't meet, as it would be
a meeting worth going miles to see
just, because of the Harpster-Bay

singer passing duel.
Hal "Skinny" Baysinger has been
the mainstay of the Orange eleven
for the last three seasons, and has
completed many a long pass for big
gains. He was one of the biggest
"cut-nps" in the alleged rough-and
tumble Syracuse-Army game two
years ago, which resulted in the two
schools severing athletic relations.
Against Nebraska this year Hal com
pleted fifteen out of thirty passes for
a gain of 240 yards.
Like Baysinger, Harpster comes
from Akron, Ohio. He was a big fac
tor in the "Skibos*" victory over
Washington and Jefferson, and as
quarterback on the team has done

| much to make the Tech boys a credit
to Pittsburgh and Coach Steffen.
Don Williams, who is being groomed
! to wear the shoes of the famous Mor
j ton Kaer and Morley Drury at the
j University of Southern California, is
a versatile player who, though not so
; large and powerful as Drury, makes j
j up for his lack of beef in speed, agil- j
j ity, and brains .He can pass, kick, j
! and run, and is especially good at
finding an opening in a line and j
I slithering his way through it. "Dy- j
I namic Don" is well-named, for his I
I lightning speed, powerful drive, and
j inspirational qualities as a field gen
] eral are seldom found combined in
j one quarterback.

Here are four "Gentlemen of the
Pass" who come from widely sepa
rated areas of the country, but who,
if combined in one backfield, would
delight the heart of any coach. They
have also in common the fact that
they usually play quarterback.
"Spud" Lewis, of Stanford Univer
sity, was a quarter two years ago i
and sort of dropped out of sight last j
reason, but in the game with Idaho
on October 19th last, "Pop" Warner
put him in as a halfback and he pro
ceeded to tear through the Vandals
for four touchdowns in the second

half, and converted each one. (Each
touchdown, not each Vandal!) He
was simply unstoppable, according to
"Brick" Morse, former Princeton All
i
! American, and became overnight the
I sensation of the Pacific Coast Con
ference.
Two of the best passers in the
country today are Howard Harpster,
! of Carnegie Tech, and Hal Baysinger,
; of Syracuse. They take to the air like
a Friedman, an Oberlander, or a
Muller, and it's a pity that Tech and
Syracuse don't meet, as it would be
a meeting worth going miles to see
just, because of the Harpster-Bay

singer passing duel.
Hal "Skinny" Baysinger has been
the mainstay of the Orange eleven
for the last three seasons, and has
completed many a long pass for big
gains. He was one of the biggest
"cut-nps" in the alleged rough-and
tumble Syracuse-Army game two
years ago, which resulted in the two
schools severing athletic relations.
Against Nebraska this year Hal com
pleted fifteen out of thirty passes for
a gain of 240 yards.
Like Baysinger, Harpster comes
from Akron, Ohio. He was a big fac
tor in the "Skibos*" victory over
Washington and Jefferson, and as
quarterback on the team has done

| much to make the Tech boys a credit
to Pittsburgh and Coach Steffen.
Don Williams, who is being groomed
! to wear the shoes of the famous Mor
j ton Kaer and Morley Drury at the
j University of Southern California, is
a versatile player who, though not so
; large and powerful as Drury, makes j
j up for his lack of beef in speed, agil- j
j ity, and brains .He can pass, kick, j
! and run, and is especially good at
finding an opening in a line and j
I slithering his way through it. "Dy- j
I namic Don" is well-named, for his I
I lightning speed, powerful drive, and
j inspirational qualities as a field gen
] eral are seldom found combined in
j one quarterback.
