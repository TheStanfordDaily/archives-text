of athletics at Denver University and
president of the Denver chapter of
the A.A. U., left yesterday for New
York, where he will enter Denver's
bid for the National A.A.U. track and
lield meet.
Bingham will take with him a cer
tified check for $6,000 as a guarantee
for the meet, which, he said, may be
held here, in view of the favorable at

the A.A.U., expressed on a recent
trip here.
Cleveland and San Francisco also
are bidding for the meet, Bingham
said. The track committee of the
A.A.U. will convene in New York
Sunday and its recommendation will
be presented to the delegates in con

A memorial to Germany's greatest
liar is to be erected in his native
city, Bodenwerder, on the banks of
the Weser River.
