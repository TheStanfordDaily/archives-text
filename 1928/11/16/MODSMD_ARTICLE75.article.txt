# AIMEE PLANS TO PREACH IN SOUTH ON THANKSGIVING
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. IS (&).â€”Aimee Mc-
Pherson, after a huge and enthusiastic
farewell evangelical meeting in Albert
Hall tonight, told the Associated Press
that she was going home so as to preach
in her own church in Los Angeles on
Thanksgiving Day. She said concerning
the case of District Attorney Keyes,
against whom charges of accepting bribes
have been made, that she expected to take
no part in that investigation.
"I know nothing about the Keyes case,"
she said. "I am too busy preaching the
gospel twice a day to pay attention to
anything like that.
"Personally, I believe that the charges
against him will go up in smoke.
"If the devil will just keep on fight
ing me for another year, my church will
be spread around the world. The cradle
of every religious movement has been
rocked by persecutions."
