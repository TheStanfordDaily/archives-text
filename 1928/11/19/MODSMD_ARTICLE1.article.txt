# HUSKY ‘TORNADO' SCARES CARDS IN STORMY BATTLE
## Muller Snags Passes From Simkins to Score Twice; No Score in First Half Stanford Leads in Punting, Passing; Behind in First Downs; Carroll Is Good 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
The big "Nor'wester" has blown
over the Farm and all is quiet again
i'or another week. The storm did no
damage principally because the local
ity was forewarned, but as some
;iO,OOO witnesses will testify, it was
every bit as big a tornado as Tiny
Thornhill forecasted.
Saturday's affair was sort of a re
versal of the affair two weeks ago in
Los Angeles. This time the opponents
did all the yard-gaining while Stan

touchdowns. Final score: Stanford 12,
Washington 0.
"Mush" Snags Passes

Stanford took a new lease on life.
The rooters began to realize the value

obliged them with six points, taking
the ball on its own 42-yard line and
crossing the goal with a series of
line plunges and passes. The score
fame when Simkins, faking a pass to
his left, tossed a long one to Muller
on the other side of the field.
Stanford's second touchdown re
sulted from a similar pass at the end
of the quarter, which netted 46 yards.
With the ball on the 3-yard line at
the start of the final period, Simkins
(hrew another pass to Muller; the
ball hit Wentworth, a Husky, and
bounced into Mush's open arms for
another score.
The Cardinals' victory cannot be
termed entirely "lucky," but at the
same time it cannot be said that they
were unlucky, for the breaks of the
game were in Stanford's favor. The
Redbirds fumbled a few times but
were more fortunate in recovering;
Washington's fumbles were costlier.
So were their penalties. The invaders
