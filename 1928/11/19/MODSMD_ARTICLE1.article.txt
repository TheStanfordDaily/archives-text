# HUSKY ‘TORNADO' SCARES CARDS IN STORMY BATTLE
## Muller Snags Passes From Simkins to Score Twice; No Score in First Half Stanford Leads in Punting, Passing; Behind in First Downs; Carroll Is Good 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
The big "Nor'wester" has blown
over the Farm and all is quiet again
i'or another week. The storm did no
damage principally because the local
ity was forewarned, but as some
;iO,OOO witnesses will testify, it was
every bit as big a tornado as Tiny
Thornhill forecasted.
Saturday's affair was sort of a re
versal of the affair two weeks ago in
Los Angeles. This time the opponents
did all the yard-gaining while Stan
ford did all the scoring. The Cards
taile to convert either of their two
touchdowns. Final score: Stanford 12,
Washington 0.
"Mush" Snags Passes
With the score tied 0-0 in the third
quarter, with Mush Muller in a very
receptive mood, and with Bill Sim
kins in the game to throw passes,
Stanford took a new lease on life.
The rooters began to realize the value
of a touchdown and made their senti
ments known to that effect. The team
obliged them with six points, taking
the ball on its own 42-yard line and
crossing the goal with a series of
line plunges and passes. The score
fame when Simkins, faking a pass to
his left, tossed a long one to Muller
on the other side of the field.
Stanford's second touchdown re
sulted from a similar pass at the end
of the quarter, which netted 46 yards.
With the ball on the 3-yard line at
the start of the final period, Simkins
(hrew another pass to Muller; the
ball hit Wentworth, a Husky, and
bounced into Mush's open arms for
another score.
The Cardinals' victory cannot be
termed entirely "lucky," but at the
same time it cannot be said that they
were unlucky, for the breaks of the
game were in Stanford's favor. The
Redbirds fumbled a few times but
were more fortunate in recovering;
Washington's fumbles were costlier.
So were their penalties. The invaders
were penalized three times for a total
of forty yards; the Cards were penal
lized as many times for a total of
fifteen yards. Twice the Huskies were
checked in goalward marches by 15-
yard penalties for holding.
Stanford outpunted and outpassed
the Huskies, but the latter gained
more yards from scrimmage and more
first downs. Stanford, with Rothert
and Frentrup kicking, averaged 41
yards on punts to Washington's 39.
Stanford completed eight of its thir
teen passes for a gain of ill yards.
Washington threw as many passes for
a total gain of 104 yards. Yet the in
vaders made 153 yards from scrim
mage to the Cards' 112, and made 15
first downs to the Cards' 8.
Chuck Carroll Stars
The name of Chuck Carroll, the
flashy Husky halfback, will long be
remembered on the Farm. The highly
touted young man certainly lived up
to his name. He not only was a shifty
ball-carrier but did all the punting,
passing, and tackling for the North
erners. On his passes and brilliant
runs he gained a bit less than 200
yards.
The Washington players have plen
ty of respect for Stanford and particu
larly for the center of the Red line
(Robesky, Heineeke, and Post), in ad
dition to Simkins and Muller whom
they have good reason to remember.
