# Carnegie Proves Master Of Irish Gridiron System
## Seven Teams Still Unbeaten; Army, Navy Anticipate Coming Battles 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 18. (/p) — The j
paeans of praise today in the college !
football campaign belong to the rock- i
ribbed forces of Carnegie, undefeated j
gridiron products of the part-time j
coaching system of a Chicago judge j
and one-time ail-American quarter- |
back, Walter Steffen.
In trouncing the Notre Dame team
that had humbled the Army and do
ing it on the Hoosiers' own field, the
Tartans from Pittsburgh removed !
any lingering doubts about their j
class, power, and resourcefulness in !
one of the greatest victories of this i
spectacular season.
Carnegie does not occupy the un- I
beaten spotlight alone. Reading from
left to right the picture of those in j
the ultra select group shows the ;
Tartans lined up with Georgia Tech, '
lowa, and Nebraska, the two middle- j
western arrays that had cleaned up I
everything previously in their path, ;
were the only major leaders in the j
college group to be checked. The !
lowans were knocked from the Big |
Ten peak by Wisconsin's alert band, 1
which simultaneously jumped to the |
front in -this race, while Nebraska I
had its otherwise perfect slate spoiled j
by a scoreless tie with the University j
of Pittsburgh.
Carnegie tops the Eastern field,
with only Boston College in position |
to dispute the leadership on the ac- j
tual season's record, but the Tartans
must get by New York University in
their final game next Saturday to
stick to the peak.
The Army and Navy, tuning up for
battles this week with Nebraska and
Princeton, scored easy victories over
Carleton and Baltimore Loyola. The
Army-Nebraska affair at West Point
will be one of the year's outstanding
intersectional games while the Navy i
and Princeton will close their seasons j
at Philadelphia.
