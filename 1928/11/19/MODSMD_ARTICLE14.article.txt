# 1932 WOMEN SERVE COFFEE, DOUGHNUTS TO BONFIRE GUARDS
## 
### 
There will be an added incen
tive fQr freshmen to watch the
bonfire tonight and tomorrow
night, for last evening the wo
men of Roble revived the cus
tom of serving food to the lan
guishing watchers.
Betts Hawkins, vice-president
of the Freshman Class, organ
ized the relief service, and last
night at about 12:30 the fresh
men around the big pile let out
a shout when there was brought
to the front a liberal round of
coffee and doughnuts. The first
watch went off duty and the
second watch came on at about
this hour, so everyone was on
hand to share the food. So suc
cessfully was the work carried
out that it will be repeated to
night and tomorrow.
A great deal of the conversa
tion around the watchfires of
late has been in the form of
conjectures as to whether the
Roble women would show enough
concern for the residents of En
cina to bring out the expected
nourishment, but now the men
are perfectly well assured of the
Roble charmers' sterling worth.
