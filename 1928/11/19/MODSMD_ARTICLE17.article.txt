## President-Elect Leaves Palo Alto After Being Blessed By Dr. D. Charles Gardner San Pedro To Be First Stop; Final Plans Await Meeting Of Fletcher With Hoover 
### Associated Press 
Bearing the parting prayer of the
Chaplain of his Alma Mater for a
blessing upon his pilgrimage of peace
and good-will, Herbert Hoover faced
jtlie bottom of the world tonight to
mingle in friendly fashion with the
peoples of Latin-America.
Leaving Palo Alto at 7:30 o'clock
last night, the first stage of the jour
ney of the i'resident-elect was to
carry him to San Pedro where he will
go aboard the Battleship Maryland
tor the voyage to Corinto, the first
stop on his tentative itinerary.
Yesterday Mr. Hoover worshipped
in his customarily quiet fashion, sit
ting in the Memorial Chapel at Stan
ford University, while the Chaplain,
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, conducted a
typically college service.
More than two hundred callers
streamed into the Hoover home dur
ing the afternoon, friends and neigh
bors of the President-elect who had
come to bid him bon voyage.
Moving down the California main
land tonight, the President-elect will
make but one stop before reaching San
Pedro. At Wilmington, California, in
the vicinity of the Port of Los An
geles, his train will stop in order that
the school children of that place may
get a glimpse of their next President.
The definite itinerary for the trip
will not be completed until after Mr.
Hoover has conferred aboard the
ship with Ambassador Fletcher, who
will accompany him as a special
representative of the State Depart
ment.
