### 
The spikes on football shoes are
solely for' the purpose of aiding a
player's speed on the turf. So claimed
Chuck Carroll, acting captain of the
Washington Huskies, in protesting
against some Stanford player's spikes
which he believed were being used
■as illegal weapons of warfare.
Acting upon Carroll's protest, the
referee stopped the game long enough
Saturday to examine the cleats of all
the Stanford players. Mush Muller's
cleats were found to be the guilty
ones which caused all the embarrass
ment to the visitors; the composition
material, of which they are made, was
Avorn low enough to expose the raw
**dge of one of the cleat-screws.
Muller blushed, then changed shoes.
