Herbert Hoover left last night 011 the first leg of his good-will tour
through South America. His trip is without precedent, but it has been
favorably received in South America as it was in this country. Even
Central America wanted a chance to -greet the President-elect, and Cuba
extended her invitation along with many other countries.
The enthusiasm with which the trip is being received in the South
American countries is encouraging. It means that it will probably be a
greater success than even the most optimistic dreamed. The relations
between the United States and the South American countries have always
been thought of as friendly. This is true enough, but it is a superficial
friendliness.
Uncle Sam is pictured as slightly different from the kind, benevolent
old chap who is just extending a helping hand. This is not unreasonable
for that view is prevalent the world over.
Our relations with the Latin-American republics have mostly been the
settling of disputes. There has been very little chance for them to know
us as human beings. Herbert Hoover will give them that opportunity.
Stanford has been glad to li£Y£ President-elect Hoover on the campus
and is proud to know that it has produced such a capable man to give
South America the true picture of Uncle Sam.
