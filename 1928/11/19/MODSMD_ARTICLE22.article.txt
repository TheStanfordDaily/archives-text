# Another Waning Tradition
## 
### 
In recent years Stanford traditions have undergone thorough renova
tion. Those which have been outgrown, as sophomore control and the
majority pf freshman regulations, have been cast aside. Those which arc
left should be particularly honored and preserved.
Since the University started back in 1891, the most cherished custom
has been embodied in the "hello" spirit. Of late, however, we have been
wondering whether this is not another vestige of the good old days which
will go the way of other Stanford traditions.
It is not pleasant to walk about the campus and have a cheery "hello"
met with a half-hearted grunt or no attempt at reply. Excuses that one
is not sure of the person's acquaintance are offered, but the "hello" cus
tom applies to non-acquaintances as well as acquaintances.
The other day, Herbert Hoover, remembering the most-honored of
Stanford traditions, picked up two men waiting for the trolley at Palo
Alto and brought them out to the campus. If Mr. Hoover can remember
the "hello" custom, surely the students can. Let's say "Hello."
