# The 						Bullsession
## 
### 
THE HANGOVER
Our recent Hull Session, "Hotli
Ends of the Candle," provoked an ex
cellent reply from "Pinky" of Lagu
nita, who apparently thrives on a
diet of odd jobs. ' Pinky" errs, how
ever, in assuming that the under
signed is so presumptious as to "gen
eralize on a situation of which he
knows nothing." That Bull Session
was the philosophical residue of four
j ears of self-supporting research, dur
ing which we equalled "Pinky's" one
time record of juggling six odd jobs
per diem.
To "Pinky's" challenge—"Does he
(the writer) think that tne required
'C average means nothing at all?" —
the answer is:
Yes. The required "C" average
means nothing at all. It is of some
what less importance than the hole
in a doughnut, because, while the hole
in a doughnut makes the doughnut a
doughnut, a "C" average does not
make the student a student.
We know a gentleman who regis
tered for a course which he did not
attend even once during the quarter.
The night before the final examina
tion he "sat in" as the silent member
of a bull-session on the course and,
thus equipped, took the examination.
To demonstrate what he acquired
from this course, we have only to
state that the following year he again
signed for it, having forgotten that
he had already taken it. His original
grade, by the way, was "13."
The above, though an extreme case,
serves to illustrate the popular men
tal attitnde here and elsewhere. Nine

out of ten of us are merely trying to
"{ret. by." The result is that the "C"
average indicates nothing at all. Any
one who can I.Q. his way into Stan
ford should be ashamed of himself if
he does not make a "C" average. Of
the ten per cent who are not just
"getting by," ninety per cent, mistak
ing the letter "A" for the word "edu
cation," are engaging in collecting
high grades. The same instinct impels
a dog to gather and bury bones. But
the dog can later dig up the bones
and eat them.
Our "getting by" attitude is a hang
over from our grammar and high
schools, wherein we were figuratively
stood against a wall and riddled with
elementary education. Methods are
being changed now, and school ex
perts are learning to sugar-coat the
Litter pill of knowledge. Studying the
business scientifically, they have
realized that although grandad learn
ed arithmetic through the seat of his
pants, his skull would have been less
impervious.
But to us pre-war children, thanks
to early training, knowledge is qui
nine. We are just boys and girls
playing the game oj. "Fox the Profes
sor." This attitude seems ludicrous
when we stop to think that we are
here of our own free will, and that
we are paying bokoo money just to
play a childish game.
Which reminds us of a little one
act comedy we overheard on Regis
tration Day:
"Is Such-and-Such a good course?"
"Yes, but you have to learn quite
a lot."
"Aw, hell." —Winston Norman.

'C average means nothing at all?" —
the answer is:
Yes. The required "C" average
means nothing at all. It is of some
what less importance than the hole
in a doughnut, because, while the hole
in a doughnut makes the doughnut a
doughnut, a "C" average does not
make the student a student.
We know a gentleman who regis
tered for a course which he did not
attend even once during the quarter.
The night before the final examina
tion he "sat in" as the silent member
of a bull-session on the course and,
thus equipped, took the examination.
To demonstrate what he acquired
from this course, we have only to
state that the following year he again
signed for it, having forgotten that
he had already taken it. His original
grade, by the way, was "13."
The above, though an extreme case,
serves to illustrate the popular men
tal attitnde here and elsewhere. Nine

out of ten of us are merely trying to
"{ret. by." The result is that the "C"
average indicates nothing at all. Any
one who can I.Q. his way into Stan
ford should be ashamed of himself if
he does not make a "C" average. Of
the ten per cent who are not just
"getting by," ninety per cent, mistak
ing the letter "A" for the word "edu
cation," are engaging in collecting
high grades. The same instinct impels
a dog to gather and bury bones. But
the dog can later dig up the bones
and eat them.
Our "getting by" attitude is a hang
over from our grammar and high
schools, wherein we were figuratively
stood against a wall and riddled with
elementary education. Methods are
being changed now, and school ex
perts are learning to sugar-coat the
Litter pill of knowledge. Studying the
business scientifically, they have
realized that although grandad learn
ed arithmetic through the seat of his
pants, his skull would have been less
impervious.
But to us pre-war children, thanks
to early training, knowledge is qui
nine. We are just boys and girls
playing the game oj. "Fox the Profes
sor." This attitude seems ludicrous
when we stop to think that we are
here of our own free will, and that
we are paying bokoo money just to
play a childish game.

act comedy we overheard on Regis

he does not make a "C" average. Of

THE HANGOVER
Our recent Hull Session, "Hotli
Ends of the Candle," provoked an ex
cellent reply from "Pinky" of Lagu
nita, who apparently thrives on a
diet of odd jobs. ' Pinky" errs, how
ever, in assuming that the under
signed is so presumptious as to "gen
eralize on a situation of which he
knows nothing." That Bull Session
was the philosophical residue of four
j ears of self-supporting research, dur
ing which we equalled "Pinky's" one
time record of juggling six odd jobs
per diem.
To "Pinky's" challenge—"Does he
(the writer) think that tne required
'C average means nothing at all?" —
the answer is:
Yes. The required "C" average
means nothing at all. It is of some
what less importance than the hole
in a doughnut, because, while the hole
in a doughnut makes the doughnut a
doughnut, a "C" average does not
make the student a student.
We know a gentleman who regis
tered for a course which he did not
attend even once during the quarter.
The night before the final examina
tion he "sat in" as the silent member
of a bull-session on the course and,
thus equipped, took the examination.
To demonstrate what he acquired
from this course, we have only to
state that the following year he again
signed for it, having forgotten that
he had already taken it. His original
grade, by the way, was "13."
The above, though an extreme case,
serves to illustrate the popular men
tal attitnde here and elsewhere. Nine

out of ten of us are merely trying to
"{ret. by." The result is that the "C"
average indicates nothing at all. Any
one who can I.Q. his way into Stan
ford should be ashamed of himself if
he does not make a "C" average. Of
the ten per cent who are not just
"getting by," ninety per cent, mistak
ing the letter "A" for the word "edu
