# Campus Opinion

The Editor, Sir:
Sometime back, the erstwhile neice
of Sum Pepys expressed herself ex
ceeding wroth over the lack of cour
tesy demonstrated in the makeup of
Stanford men who refuse to offer
lifts out to the campus to women
waiting for the Dinky. Such remarks
caused great turbulations in my soul,
which demanded expression, but I
just haven't been able to get around
to do the expressing.
Now, being one of these so-called
discourteous drivers, I demand abso
lution —or something—if that isn't
the word I want. Why should I offer
lifts to the five hundred, individually
or in parties of six—excuse me —
four?
If I see some lonesome maiden
waiting patiently for the Toonerville,
and I dare pull up to the poor excuse
for the curb near the depot, I risk
watching said maiden hoist her nose
toward the heavens at the first word
of my invitation. Or, what is worse,
have my sensitive being riddled with
a fusilade of scathing remarks. I tried
it once, innocent freshman that I was,
and I have never recovered from the
words that coy young lady wrapped
around my ears.
So, I repeat, why should I offer the
hospitality of my car, knowing not
whether I will be greeted with a
gracious assent or, more probable, a
frigid denial. I don't mind so much
having to watch her climb into the
trolley after turning down a ride, but
why should I be rewarded with the
flow of causticism or cold stares? No
thanks. I pick up fellows, or ride
alone —like Lindbergh.
And further. I hereby and firmly re
solve that when I see a campus wo
man piloting her papa's car up Uni
versity avenue, stop at the customary
gathering-place and offer a strange,
immoral-looking young man a ride to
the Quad —then, say I, and then only
will I once more risk putting the
query—"Going out to the campus?"
Very truly yours, "Scoop."
The Editor, Sir:
I believe that "Pinky of L.agunita"
rather misinterpreted Mr. Norman's
Bull Session, "Both Ends of the Can
dle." As I understand it, Mr. Norman
discussed the relative value of Stan

ford to the student in the peculiar
circumstances of being dependent
upon the University wage scale of
fifty cents an hour. And as I remem
ber, Mr. Norman admitted that ex
ceptions to his generalizations were
not only probable but possible.
Also I object very violently to
"Pink's" confusion of a perfectly good
article with the personality of the
author, which is a common error of
Campus Opinions. I happen to know
that Mr. Norman is very well quali
fied to discuss this situation, not only
from personal experience of a rather
wide nature, but from his general
sympathy with the situation.
It seemed to me that no reflections
were cast upon the initiative or char
acter of the self-supported student,
bat the article criticized primarily
the standard of the University wage
scale. Figure it up yourself, begin
ning with the expenses of one quarter
at college—room, board, clothes,
amusements, allowance for possible
illnesses, dentistry, books, etc., divide
by the number of hours of the quar
ter (with a fourteen-hour day as a
conservative estimate), and you will
find that your time while here at
Stanford is costing you about a mini
mum of 42c an hour. This gives a very
small margin with the fifty-cent-an
liour scale for extraordinary expenses
(the flat tire on your car, or borrowed
vehicle, etc.) and makes your leisure
very expensive indeed.
Moreover the wage scale in towns
of the Palo Alto sizes, not infected
with this college standard, is higher
than on this campus. With the excep
tion of not being able to enjoy the
facilities of a University, it is a much
better financial investment for a stu
dent to work at ordinary wages, and
educate himself. There are a number
of intangible things that can't be got
ten away from here, of course.
Now the flat rate of 50c an hour
makes no allowance for special effort,
ability, or any other qualifying condi
tion. A common rate of 50c is a fair
enough norm, but what about the
students who give 75c an hour value?
I bave no doubt that the basis for
this flat rate is calculated from any
number of important points, but my
objection is on its effect and the very
unfortunate result to the individual.
