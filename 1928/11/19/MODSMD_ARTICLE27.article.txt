"Stride of Man." By Thames William
son. (Coward-McCann, Inc. New
York: 1928.)
"What's wrong with the Americain
people, anyhow? They're practical but
then who the devil wants anything
that won't work! Americans have got
stamina and guts and energy, and
they came over here and turned a
wilderness into the greatest country
on earth."
Daniel Patterson, the great Auto
King of America, is speaking. He
knows this America and its people
which lie defends so staunchly witli
a knowledge that comes from 71 years
of a life rich and varied, full of zest,
marked by triumphs and defeats, and

touching every important phase of j
national activity.
"Stride of Man" is the story of this j
Daniel Patterson from his birth to !
|his death. Strangely enough, although
he has a picturesque zigzag existence
of alternate drifting and furious In
dustry in his early life he does not
really seem to "live" until ho has
reached middlo age. For this reason
tho book, in spite of some interesting
pictures of pioneering, does not get a
hold upon the reader until he is nenr
! ly half way through it. From then on
it absorbs him utterly.
The book is an epic of American- ,
isms. It somehow includes all one's j
ideas of America in all of its aspects (
