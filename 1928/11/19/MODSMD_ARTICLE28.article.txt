# "The Desert Song"—Curran.
## 
### 
Once aguin the Rift's are abroad
and the French legionnaires pursue
the Red Shadow who is the Robin
Hood of Morocco. Once again the
marvelous music of "The Desert
Song" is to be heard in the city.
This musical comedy—or operetta
—is one you should see, if you haven't
already. It has a melodramatic story,
a most picturesque hero, many elabo
rate scenes, and a tine male chorus
which sings Romberg's songs in a
way that calls for many, many en-
I cores.
Perry Askam is the Red Shadow,
| the mysterious desert "sheik" who
leads a band of natives against the
oppressive French soldiers. He not
only has an excellent voice—but he
looks the part. Elvira Tanzi, the lead
ing lady, is not so good. She acts very
woodenly—if there is such a word —
and lacks the allure a heroine should
lvave. Nanette Vallon is the best actor
in the company, playing Azuri, a na
tive dancer.
But it is the music that makes "The
Desert Song." The Red Shadow's ren
dition of "Ho!," "The Desert Song,"
and "One Alone" are worth hearing a
second time —if you saw the show
when it was here last spring.
Perhaps the record run of "The
Desert Song" is its best recommenda
tion. It played eleven weeks at the
Curran last season, and has been
running in Los Angeles from that
! time until last week, when it re
opened in San Francisco.
Such popularity must be deserved!
