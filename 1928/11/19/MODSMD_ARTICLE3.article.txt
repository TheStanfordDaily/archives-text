## Expect to Obtain Additional Evidences of Messages Sent From Ship 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 18. (/P) â€” Two ;
Nautical Advisers, representing the :
American and British governments ,
respectively, will sit with United
States Commissioner O'Neill when |
the Federal inquiry into the sinking i
of the Lamport and Holt liner Vestris j
is resumed tomorrow, United States
Attorney Charles H. Tuttle announced
today.
Tuttle also indicated that he ex
pects to obtain possession of addi
tional wireless messages sent from
the stricken liner.
The Federal Attorney did not re- j
veal whether these messages had
been sent before or after the SOS j
sent three hours before the liner went
down last Monday afternoon with the
loss of 110 lives.
Captain Henry McConkey, Marine
Superintendent of the Cunard and
allied lines, has been designated by
the British Government to act as its ;
representative in the capacity of
Nautical Advisor when the hearing is
resumed, Tuttle said today.
The Attorney said he would recom- j
mend the appointment of "a distin- j
guished marine expert" to be the ad- j
visor on behalf of the United States
Government, but did not reveal the j
name of his appointee.
The question whether the Vestris ;
had asked for aid or whether her mas- j
ter, William Carey, had informed his j
owners or their agents of the ship's J
plight before the SOS crackled j
through the ether last Monday fore- j
noon had not been answered when
the hearing Avas adjourned yesterday. '
Testimony has been contacting re- I
garding when it was discovered that j
something was wrong with the ship, j
First Officer Johnson yesterday said ;
it was Sunday night. When reminded |
that the radio operator had testified!
that they noticed a list in the ship !
as early as midnight of Saturday, the j
first officer said "they were wrong." j
