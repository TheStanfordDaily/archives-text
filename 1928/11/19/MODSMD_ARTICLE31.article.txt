# CARD SWORDSMEN HAND CALIFORNIA 13 TO 12 DEFEAT
## Capt. Herkimer Adams Wins Five Bouts To Be High Scorer of West 
### 
Tho Stanford varsity fencing team
beat California by a 13-12 score be- j
fore a good-sized crowd Saturday j
night at Encina gymnasium, llerki- |
mer Adams, Card captain, won live j
bouts straight, making liim higli- j
point man. Three other Stanford team i
members won two bouts each, and
Joe Polverino took two out of three. |
A round robin was fenced between j
the two teams: each man fought five j
bouts, there being twenty-five in all. j
Fletcher Dutton, Orray Taft, and
Jack Snyder took two matches each.
Udell Walk was replaced by Poverino
after the second bout, as sickness
kept him from being in good shape.
This was Polverino's first competition
and Coach Bugge said that he did
very well to win two bouts from a
more-experienced opponent.
Snyder, Taft, and Dutton did some
clever work, and the contests which
they lost were close. The best bout
of the evening was between Adams
and Lewis, both team captains. When
the two met in the intercollegiates
last year, Lewis won, but aince that
time Adams has beaten him.
"The California team is a strong
opponent," said Bugge, "but 1 think
in an intercollegiate meet we would
have at least an even chance of beat
ing them. In the match Saturday
night Adams showed the best form
in swordsmanship and exhibited the
keenest headwork, and Snyder was
next."
This match, which was the last one
in the Heron trophy contest, gives
Stanford second place to the Olympic
Club. It is the last event for the Stan
ford swordsmen this fall.
Ferard Leicester, O.C. team cap
tain, acted as referee, and the team
members alternated as judges.
