# CAMERA BOGIE TO PATSY RUTH MILLER
## "Most Popular Girl in Hollywood" Has Hard Sledding; Now Making Pictures, Acting in Stock Company 
### 
By BEN MADDUX
Patsy Ruth Miller's case is one of j
the reel tragedies of Hollywood. Ever j
since she burst into prominence as
the leading lady in "The Hunchback
| of Notre Dame," she has had hard ;
| sledding.
She just can't be herself before the
! camera. For the last three years ■
i writers have called her tho most
popular girl in Hollywood. Everyone j
| who knows her thinks she is a "wow." :
! But —she has still to conquer Old Man j
I
j Camera.
When I heard that she was making |
j her stage debut in a Henry Duffy play ;
in Los Angeles the day after the j
Stanford-U.S.C. game, I decided that |
the occasion would be an opportune
one for me to check up on the ef
fusive praises of the magazine scribes.
Backstage I went after her initial
performance in ' Nightstick." And it
is, indeed, a tragic case. Patsy Ruth
is one of the most alive girls I've
ever met. She has "It" —both physi
cally and mentally. Her conversation
is vivid. Whatever she says interests
because she is so enthusiastic herself.
Many girls who are the rage on the
screen are complete failures in pri
vate life. With Patsy Ruth it is all
too much the other way 'round.
Since she played her first big part
—the lead opposite Lon Chaney in
"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" —
she has achieved considerable suc
cess. She has always worked steadily
—always played leading roles. She is
very good-looking, draws a sizeable
pay-check, has provided herself with j
a Beverly Hills home, and is the belle j
of the Hollywood film set.
But she is having a terrible time
with the bogie-man. She is being
starred right now by one of the„
smaller companies—making pictures
in the daytime and playing for Mr.
Duffy at night. The sad part is that
she is not getting nearly as far as
she is capable of going.
Patsy Ruth is in her early twen
ties —but after six years before the
I public she is stili playing the in
genue. Her gorgeous sense of humor,
! her pep, her alertness, her vitality—
| somehow she hasn't as yet been able
j to express in pictures. She should be
playing sophisticated Constance Tal
-1 madge roles —she could out-Clara the
Bow woman, for she is ever so much 1
more attractive than Elinor Glyn's '
1 protege.
i "Just think," she wailed. "I had !

seats on the fifty-yard line for the
Stanford-U.S.C. game and then had
to work! Couldn't beg out of it. liut 1
brought a radio onto the set, and i
can't say we concentrated on the pic
ture very much!
"I'm just going to play this part
for about six weeks —I have tickets
for the U.S.C.-Notre Dame game, and
I'd really rather see it tnan go on
with the show.
"But I've always been crazy to be
in a real play. I'm only doing this
on the side, though—the movies are
my specialty.
"I could only come to half as many
rehearsals as the rest of the cast—
since I'm working on a picture, too.
So I had my maid read my cues
while I was waiting for calls in my
dressing-room."
Patsy Ruth's mother and father
came in to congratulate her. There
were huge boquets of flowers all
around the room, and the mirror be
fore which she took off her makeup
was lined with tegerams that came
just before the show.
She is the ideal modern girl—ath
letic, full of fun, and ah —such good
looks! Perhaps she will be helped by
stage experience. She should be one
of the three or four leaning comedi
ennes of the screen. Let's hope she
can get away from the stereotyped
ingenues in 1929. Patsy Ruth, the
most popular girl in Hollywood,
ought to rate the same position on
the screen.
