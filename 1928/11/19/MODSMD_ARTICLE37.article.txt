November 18th—
Commuted between the Branner
dance and that at ltoble Friday night, !
which did find a most excellent
though slightly unethical way of
avoiding dances that 1 did nut wish
to enjoy. For, in making up our pro- |
grams in Ruble, a week ahead ol j
time, was earnestly beseeched fur a j
number from a young girl six feet j
tall that 1 had borrowed notes from !
last week; and when 1 did show her j
at a distance to the young beau who J
was my escort for the evening, he j
made such derogatory remarks about
her stature that 1 was glad of the
excuse offered to go to Branner in j
the sixth dance; and at Branner did
find the same subterfuge of going !
back to Roble useful to avoid a gang- |
ly gentleman and a similar import.
* * *
Not to the game this Saturday, but j
to the hairdressers to be beautified, :
since I did see the game in the South, I
and do really not understand football
well enough to sacrifice a marcel £c.i i
it. Which, under the circumstances, !
was unfortunate, for I now see that j
the Washington game was something
I should not have missed.
* * *
But what with my great date with
my friend Keith, and the teas this
Sunday afternoon, my hair really j
seems quite important. My aunt did j
send me a most excellent frock for j
the sorority entertainments, which I j
hope will draw the admiration of |
everj r one, and will be a sign of identi-1
flcation, for what with such a number
of freshmen, do not see how one can j
be remembered unless one wears a
pink carnation in one's coat, or per
haps a ludicrous hat.
So to worrying muchly about this
afternoon, for I have a great fear of 1
going into a fraternity house by mis- j
take. My sponsor did draw a map for
me to help me identify the various
houses, and Keith did tell me means |

I of remembering them, for one is cur
; tained discreetly by vines, another
rises high in the air with gables, a
third has a number of Juliet bal
conies, and the last two, by geo
graphic distinction, are differentiated
by a lawn, and a back alley. Which
: does not relieve my fears very great
ly, but at least is something to re
member in my daze. Wish mightily I
had taken enough Greek this quarter
that I might read the names correctly
| myself, for do understand that these
mystic symbols are written plainly
!on all the doormats.

November 18th—
Commuted between the Branner
dance and that at ltoble Friday night, !
which did find a most excellent
though slightly unethical way of
avoiding dances that 1 did nut wish
to enjoy. For, in making up our pro- |
grams in Ruble, a week ahead ol j
time, was earnestly beseeched fur a j
number from a young girl six feet j
tall that 1 had borrowed notes from !
last week; and when 1 did show her j
at a distance to the young beau who J
was my escort for the evening, he j
made such derogatory remarks about
her stature that 1 was glad of the
excuse offered to go to Branner in j
the sixth dance; and at Branner did
find the same subterfuge of going !
back to Roble useful to avoid a gang- |
ly gentleman and a similar import.

Not to the game this Saturday, but j
to the hairdressers to be beautified, :
since I did see the game in the South, I
and do really not understand football
well enough to sacrifice a marcel £c.i i
it. Which, under the circumstances, !
was unfortunate, for I now see that j
the Washington game was something
I should not have missed.
* * *
But what with my great date with
my friend Keith, and the teas this
Sunday afternoon, my hair really j
seems quite important. My aunt did j
send me a most excellent frock for j
the sorority entertainments, which I j
hope will draw the admiration of |
everj r one, and will be a sign of identi-1
flcation, for what with such a number
of freshmen, do not see how one can j
be remembered unless one wears a
pink carnation in one's coat, or per
haps a ludicrous hat.
So to worrying muchly about this
afternoon, for I have a great fear of 1
going into a fraternity house by mis- j
take. My sponsor did draw a map for
me to help me identify the various
houses, and Keith did tell me means |

I of remembering them, for one is cur
; tained discreetly by vines, another
rises high in the air with gables, a
third has a number of Juliet bal
conies, and the last two, by geo
graphic distinction, are differentiated
by a lawn, and a back alley. Which
: does not relieve my fears very great
ly, but at least is something to re
member in my daze. Wish mightily I
had taken enough Greek this quarter
that I might read the names correctly
| myself, for do understand that these
mystic symbols are written plainly
!on all the doormats.
