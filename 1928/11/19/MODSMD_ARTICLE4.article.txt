# '32 SOCCER MEN DEFEAT BERKELEY IN HARD COTEST
## 
### 
Stanford freshmen came through
victorius Saturday morning in their
most important game of the year
when they defeated the California
frosh soccer team 3 to 0. The fact
that last week this same Berkeley
team beat the local 1932 men 7 to 3
made this game the more exciting
and the more remarkable.
For the first time this year the
freshmen played the game of soccer
as it should be played, according to
Ward Smith, who is coaching the
team in the absence of Harry Ma
loney. In the previous games this
season the green team has been
beaten by many less important ag
gregations but when the time came
for them to win, they played with
spirit from start to finish.
No scores were made until the last
minute of the first half when Bert
Weyl received a perfect pass from
Winther and turned it neatly into the
goal. In the last part of the second
half the two other goals were made
by Weyl and Harry Van Sciver.
California's lack of defense proved
to be a great assistance for the
Cards, and they were able to keep
the ball up in the vicinity of the goal
a majority of the time. The forward
line showed teamwork in passing the
ball to each other and in carrying
the ball down the field.
The goalkeeper, Joseph Marshall,
started in the game playing with a
bad leg. In the second half, after stop
ping every California ball that came
his way, he hurt his leg a little more,
but finished the game, keeping the
Berkeley team scoreless.
Captain Russell Smith played a
good game, always being in his posi
tion of center half to kick the ball far
down the field. To Preston Plumb fell
the task of guarding Captain Smart
of the California team, who made the
great number of goals in last week's
game. Plumb covered his man with
such care that Smart was never given
a chance to score.
