Stanford saw a lighting, vicious,
ever-dangerous Husky Pack give the
Cardinal eleven a real scare Satur
day. Fans saw Enoch Bagshaw's
Washington team make a last des
perate bid for a 1928 comeback —saw
that drive fail.
But the feature of Saturday's
game which most Stanford root
ers won't forget was the playing
of one Chuck Carroll, colorful
Husky halfback.
All that has been said about the
plucky northern ball-toter is deserved.
Such at least is the opinion of most
fans who witnessed his brilliant per
formance here Saturday. If Chuck
Carroll were on a team that cut a
wider swath in the gridiron crop this
year, he would be classed even nearer
the top of bootball's heap than he is.
Thus passes one of life's little
tragedies. Had Mr. Carroll been
playing quarterback on Coach
Howard Jones' Southern Califor
nia varsity, sports writers would
have called him the "Charging
Chuck" or the "Careening Car
roll," just as they have placed
the "Dynamic Don" handle on
Mr. Williams' otherwise common
place name.
But Carroll isn't playing on the
U.S.C. team nor on California's, nor
on Stanford's. So lie will go down in
history, if at all, simply as one whale
of a man on the gridiron.
Stanford fans attested to his bril
liance Saturday by giving him a tre
mendous ovation—the greatest hand
ever received by a visiting player in
the Stanford Stadium, at least in the
memory of ye Sideline Slanter.
A headline in the Chronicle Sport
ing Green said Sunday that "Hoover
Sees Aerial Attack Tame Huskies."
Startling statement that.
We wonder if that view will have
a comprehensive effect upon Mr. Hoo
ver's presidential policies or will color
his pleas for peace in South America.
Seriously though, Hoover's fanning
at the past two football games has
come as somewhat of a surprise to
those of his critics who thought that
the President-elect may have lacked
his human side.
It seems, however, that Mr
Hoover is rather a real person, af
ter all. Certainly he must get a
genuine enjoyment out of foot
ball to brave the thousands of
curious eyes and the peering
camera lenses that constantly fol
low him in the Stadium.
For Herbert Hoover doesn't go
in for attracting such interest.
Even his critics admit that.
But then, they will doubtless find
fault with the fact that he doesn't
throw his hat in the air and bellow
forth a Skyrocket. —Bob Speers

the top of bootball's heap than he is.
Thus passes one of life's little
tragedies. Had Mr. Carroll been
playing quarterback on Coach
Howard Jones' Southern Califor
nia varsity, sports writers would
have called him the "Charging
Chuck" or the "Careening Car
roll," just as they have placed
the "Dynamic Don" handle on
Mr. Williams' otherwise common
place name.
But Carroll isn't playing on the
U.S.C. team nor on California's, nor
on Stanford's. So lie will go down in
history, if at all, simply as one whale
of a man on the gridiron.
Stanford fans attested to his bril
liance Saturday by giving him a tre
mendous ovation—the greatest hand
ever received by a visiting player in
the Stanford Stadium, at least in the
memory of ye Sideline Slanter.
A headline in the Chronicle Sport
ing Green said Sunday that "Hoover
Sees Aerial Attack Tame Huskies."
Startling statement that.
We wonder if that view will have
a comprehensive effect upon Mr. Hoo
ver's presidential policies or will color
his pleas for peace in South America.
Seriously though, Hoover's fanning
at the past two football games has
come as somewhat of a surprise to
those of his critics who thought that
the President-elect may have lacked
his human side.
It seems, however, that Mr
Hoover is rather a real person, af
ter all. Certainly he must get a
genuine enjoyment out of foot
ball to brave the thousands of
curious eyes and the peering
camera lenses that constantly fol
low him in the Stadium.
For Herbert Hoover doesn't go
in for attracting such interest.
Even his critics admit that.
But then, they will doubtless find
fault with the fact that he doesn't
throw his hat in the air and bellow
forth a Skyrocket. —Bob Speers
Stanford saw a lighting, vicious,
ever-dangerous Husky Pack give the
Cardinal eleven a real scare Satur
day. Fans saw Enoch Bagshaw's
Washington team make a last des
perate bid for a 1928 comeback —saw
that drive fail.
But the feature of Saturday's
game which most Stanford root
ers won't forget was the playing
of one Chuck Carroll, colorful
Husky halfback.
All that has been said about the
plucky northern ball-toter is deserved.
Such at least is the opinion of most
fans who witnessed his brilliant per
formance here Saturday. If Chuck
Carroll were on a team that cut a
wider swath in the gridiron crop this
year, he would be classed even nearer
the top of bootball's heap than he is.
