# BREATHES THERE A MAN WITH SOUL SO DEAD?
## EDITORIAL 
### 
A group of Stanford men are planning to burn the Big Game bonfire
| prematurely. At first this was a mere rumor; one which no one could
1 believe, it was impossible to think that a Stanford man would have such
a distorted sense of humor as to do this despicable trick. But further
facts have substantiated the rumor so thoroughly that it is now a fact.
It is hard to picture a person who could be so mean as to deprive all
| Stanford of the thrill that it will get the night of the Big Game rally.
lOn this night the bonfire is a symbol of Stanford spirit. The freshmen
I have toiled for three weeks gathering the lumber for the one thing that
i belongs to the Freshman Class. They have stayed out all night in a
! drenching rain to guard the thing that they have worked so hard to build.
Yet there exists a group of men who would cheat the freshmen;
j cheat all other Stanford students; and cheat all Stanford alumni and well
] wishers of seeing the giant pyre carry the California coffin up in smoke.
They would cheat Stanford of its traditional Big Game Bonfire to satisfy
some craving to do a collegiate prank.
In their own minds they may have thought up some justification for
their intended prank. They might have hearkened back to the last time
! that the bonfire was burnt; the time that everyone turned out to rebuild it.
| If the bonfire were burnt this year it could not be rebuilt by Wednesday.
| The thrill of the Big Game rally would be lost.
Worse than that, Big Game pep would suffer. The pyre is the spark
i that sets ofif student enthusiasm. From that time on there is a nervous
tension; a feeling to get out and yell loud enough to scare California to
death. This feeling is needed this year. The rooting at every game this
year has been pitiful. But that is over; the Big Game is a chance for
| Stanford to redeem itself.
Let the men who would deprive Stanford of its bonfire think seriously
about the result of their contemplated act. Then let them devote their
i energy to making the Stanford rooting section at the Big Game a Stan
j lord rooting section. This will bring results.
