While in Banff, Alberta, in 1909, I
climbed Tunnell Mountain. On top of
this mountain there is a cairn of stones
where tourists leave their cards with
remarks about the scenery, etc. Not
having a card with me, I left a tin of
Edgeworth Sliced, scribbled my name
and address on a piece of paper, and
said, "Have a fill on me."
1 have kept up a haphazard corre
spondence with one of three who wrote
me thanking ine for the Pipeful of
Edgeworth. What makes me write
you is that today from Australia 1
received two slices of Edgeworth with
the words, " Have a fill on me," so you
see Edgeworth keeps friends friendly.
