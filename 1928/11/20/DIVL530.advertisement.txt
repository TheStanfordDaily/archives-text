Centuries Ago—
Men kept their treasures In clumsy iron chests, secured by
ingeniously contrived locks. These were hidden in musty
dungeons behind thick castle walls. Trusted knights stood
guard at the door.
How primitive this method of safe-keeping appears today
compared with the Safe Deposit service afforded by this
bank. Here you have protection, accessibility, privacy, and
courteous attention. And the cost is little—approximately
one cent a day.
There is a box for every purpose and every purse—fraternity
rituals, jewelry, medals, heirlooms, securities, and other
valuables.
