fornia less than a week away and with
the Cards having to do some real work
to be prepared for the Bears by game
time.

Pop Warner spent the best part of yes
terday's practice session in drilling his
backfield on defense against passes in
order to overcome the weakness which
was so prevalent last Saturday against
the Washington Huskies. In a light
.scrimmage, Rothert threw passes for the
offense against the first string backfield
composed of Hoffman, Wilton, Sims, and
Fleishhacker.

The Cardinals are in better physical
shape than at first might be expected,
considering that they played the Huskies
last Saturday—what they call "the tough
est opponents we have been up against
thus far this season." Chuck Smalling
and Tiny Sellman were the only men
absent from practice. Sellman is ill with
a return of flu, the illness which both
ered him at the start of last week. Small
ing is suffering with a bad bruise re
ceived Saturday; he is expected to be
back in uniform this afternoon.

Walt Heinecke's shoulder injury does
not seem to have been hurt any by his
♦oaving played against Washington. Walt
was back at his center job yesterday and
-will be able to play against the Bears.

In regard to a Stanford victory against
Price's outfit, Pop Warner is more pessi
mistic than ever. "I regard Stanford's
■chances as not quite so good as their
opponents'," he says. "Certainly the
Stanford team will have to play much
better than it has in the last two games
if a defeat is to be averted."
