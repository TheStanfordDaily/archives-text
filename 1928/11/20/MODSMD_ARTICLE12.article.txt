## 
### 
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 19 (JP).â€”
Overflowing streams were spreading
death and destruction in Ave states to
night and the mighty Mississippi River
itself was out of its banks along the bor
ders of Missouri and Illinois.

Rainfall of unprecedented proportions
for this time of year brought Kentucky
and Illinois into the flood belt during the
day and increased the seriousness of the
situation in Missouri, while communities
in eastern Kansas and a portion of Okla
homa were slowly recovering from the
most disastrous November flood on rec
ord.
Three deaths in Kentucky, where the
Cumberland River was on a rampage,
and two more reported in Kansas
brough the total known dead to 17.
Property damage already was esti
mated at more than $10,000,000. Several
thousand families were homeless with a
cold wave and snow in some places add
ing to their misery.
Swollen by thirty-six hours of rain,
the Cumberland invaded the business dis
trict of Middlesboro and flooded dwell
ings in the low parts of Pineville, Har
lan, and Barbourville. More than 700
persons were forced to flee their homes
in Harlan.
The Kentucky River left its banks and
flooded homes and business buildings in
Neon.
Damage at Quincy, 111., was estimated
at $1,000,000, and at Kansas City, Mo.,
at $100,000.
