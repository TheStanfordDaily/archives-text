# Sequoia Club Wake To Show Why Golden Bear Should Be Singed
## 
### 
Sequoia Club will seal the doom of
the Golden Bear tonight when they hold
their annual wake. A bellman, tolling
the death of the mis-colored bruin, will
lead the procession, and, he will be fol
lowed by the characters of the skit

"Heavenly Daze." After these will come
the special Wake band.

Next in line will be a horse-drawn
caisson carrying the carcass of a miser
able Bruin dressed up in a nice coffin,
and surrounded by the disconsolate mem
bers of the U.C. football team. Behind
the caisson the professional mourners
will rend the air with their wailing. The
gerk'ral rabble, including any and all per
sons having a desire to hoot at Califor
nia, will form the rear guard. Lighting
for the procession will be furnished by
the flare and torch system.
The cavalcade goes first to Roble,
thence up the Row to Arguello, down
that street to Toyon, and then around to
Encina. If they survive the freshmen,
they will proceed to the Bonfire. The
route will be lighted by multi-colored
flares placed at intervals along the way.
The skit, "Heavenly Daze," will be
presented at 7 :45 o'clock, if the charac
ters arrive safely at the Boniire. It will
depict the attempts of the Spirit of Cali
fornia to crash the Pearly Gates, and
tells why he should be entertained in a
warmer atmosphere. The characters are:
Saint Peter, Jack Carrington; Father
Time, George Feliz; Spirit of California,
Joe Shirly; Old Nick, James Purcell;
Slave, Max Krakauer.
