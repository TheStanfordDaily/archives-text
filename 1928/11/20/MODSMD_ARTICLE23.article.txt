### Associated Press 
ABOARD THE U.S.S. MARYLAND,
At Sea, Nov. 19. (/P) —With every
honor except that of the presidential
Hag, Herbert Hoover today left United
States soil on a mission of friendship
and understanding to the sister re
publics of the Western Hemisphere.
This battleship, which is to be his
headquarters until the trans-Andean
journey from Chile, steamed steadily
southward tonight through the calm
Pacific.
The Hoover party was cheered from
its arrival on a special train at San
Pedro to the dock where it boarded
the barge of Admiral William V.
Pratt, Commander-in-Chief of the Uni
ted States battle fleet. They were
carried two miles across the harbor
to the waiting Maryland under es
corts of Navy launches filled with
cheering officers in full dress.
Admiral Receives Hoover
Rear Admiral Louis M. Nulton, Com
mander of the Battleship Division,
Rear Admiral William C. Cole, and
other high ranking naval officers,
stood at the gangplank to receive the
President-elect while the guns of the
Maryland and of nine other battle
ships boomed out a salute of 21 guns.
The men of the Maryland lined the
deck at attention and a full guard
saluted while Mr. Hoover passed; the
band gave four ruffles and a flourish
and a boatswain piped him over the
side. As soon as the guests had been
escorted to the suites which had been
made ready for them, Captain Victor
A. Kimberly ordered the battleship to
get under way.

Mr. and Mrs. Hoover stood on the
quarterdeck with Ambassador Henry
P. Fletcher as the ship moved away
from its anchorage at 11:08 A.M.
They watched with interest the es
cort of naval planes overhead and the
slim destroyers which cut through
the water alongside. Then Mr. Hoover
mounted to the bridge and stood be
side Captain Kimberly to watch the
operation of the great battleship.
Six destroyers of the 32nd Divi
sion continued as honorary compan
ions of the Maryland until nearly off
San Diego. With all farewells then
receding in the distance, the Mary
land took up its course for Corinto,
Nicaragua."

At Sea, Nov. 19. (/P) —With every

This battleship, which is to be his

southward tonight through the calm
Pacific.
The Hoover party was cheered from
its arrival on a special train at San
Pedro to the dock where it boarded
the barge of Admiral William V.

Rear Admiral William C. Cole, and

Maryland and of nine other battle
ships boomed out a salute of 21 guns.
The men of the Maryland lined the
deck at attention and a full guard
saluted while Mr. Hoover passed; the
band gave four ruffles and a flourish
and a boatswain piped him over the
side. As soon as the guests had been
escorted to the suites which had been
made ready for them, Captain Victor
A. Kimberly ordered the battleship to
get under way.

Mr. and Mrs. Hoover stood on the
