# W.S.C. GAME LEAVES MARK ON S.C. TEAM

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 19 OT—The
courageous stand of Washington State's
scrapping Cougars here last week left its
mark upon the University of Southern
California football team, several players
nursing hurts today that may prove ex
pensive in the final conference game of
the season against Idaho Saturday and
the intersectional struggle with Notre
Dame the following week.
Four main cogs of the Trojans' ma
! chine—Charley Boren, running guard ;
Nathan Barragcr, heroic center; Lloyd
| Thomas, sterling halfback; Harry Edel-
I son, fullback; and Francis Tappaan, star
end—suffered injuries that will probably
! weaken the team, and may not be suffi
ciently recovered to enable Southern
California to put its full strength on the
field against Notre Dame December 1.
