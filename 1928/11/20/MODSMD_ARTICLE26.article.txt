# The
						Sleeper Is Awakening

### 
Where are you going Big Game night? This and many other questions
pertaining to the same topic are the things that are being discussed in
nearly every bull session that one nears. Bosom friends almost come to
blows over the innocent argument as to whether one obtains the greatest
enjoyment during this night of all nights from stagging and making the
rounds or from having a date.
Everyone is planning to make whoopee on a Gargantuan scale. Every
one is scurrying around trying to get reservations, dates, and the other
essentials that go to make this night a thing that can be remembered from
the mediocre peccadillos that stick in one's mind. But amid this joyous
throng there are a few that don't have that smile. They can make no plans
to do deeds which will leave them pleasant little reminiscences; they are
entertaining their parents.
But every one of these people has one big question uppermost in his
mind—who is going to win the Big Game? The optimistic, the pessimistic,
the conservative, and all of their hybrids render a different verdict. But
all of them have a secret fear of California.
The dear old Blue and Gold supporters have a real football team to
back this year. They haven't been saying much; they haven't been boasting;
they are contented to be the underdogs. But the Bears have set up a won
derful record; no college team has crossed their goal line. Californians
know that they have a fighting eleven that is playing hard football and they
are yelling for these men every minute.
Stanford has been just a little too self-satisfied. Just a little too willing
to say that the Cardinal eleven can refeat anyone. Just a little too willing to
let the football players and Pop Warner do all of the work. But the Big
Game is different and Stanford is starting to wake up.
The big old Bear has started to rouse himself from his apathy. He is
Incoming a vicious animal. California is willing to offer even money that
they will l)eat Stanford; only one indication that the "Old Fox" and his
pack will not meet an unruly bunch of Cubs when they invade the Berkeley
lair.
Pop Warner is grooming his men for the battle. Students are beginning
to realize that this is going to be one of the best little fights in recent years.
All of which means that the old Stanford spirit has returned.
