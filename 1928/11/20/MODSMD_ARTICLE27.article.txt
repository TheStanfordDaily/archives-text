# Hot Copy
## 
### 
It is ticklish business for a college "newspaper man" to criticize the
practices of big-time journalism.
In the first place, the blossoming products of university journalism
schools may not l>e considered as qualified critics—not by the veterans of
the city room, at any rate. In the second place, the collegian, after four
years of campus life, may have an outlook just as narrow as that of the
most sensation-craving city editor.
But from our point of view, the college and the college student is being
handled a trifle too carelessly by our professional contemporaries. A recent
example of what we mean is the publicity given an incident at the Uni
versity of Washington, where the president called a meeting of representa
» tive students for the suppression of necking, drinking, and cheating.
"Hot copy," thought city editors in Seattle. And so it was. Everyone
from bank president to hod carrier is interested in the current orgies of
the younger set —especially the college set.
But when the meeting developed into a quiet, constructive discussion,
the city editors were disappointed, and not to be denied. They demanded
hot copy anyway, and their reporters turned out some amazing "dream
stories" which entertained the hod carriers and the bank presidents, but
didn't leave an impression that University of Washington students are all
enterprising members of the Y.W. and Y.M.C.A.
Now the Washington students probably aren't all earnest "Y" workers,
but at the same time they aren't all "flaming youth" either, as the banker
and the hod carrier are prone to believe.
But after all is said and done, the fact remains that college boys and
girls are good copy. A sorority house fire makes better reading than a story
of the Administration building burning to the ground—for by no stretch
of the imagination could "fair co-eds run screaming out, clad in scanty
negligee," in the latter and more prosaic instance.
And so this ink and space and mental effort arc doubtless wasted. If
some metropolitan journalist should deign to read our brain child lie will
snort and say that Aimec Semple McPherson thought she got a dirty
deal, too.
