# Heed The Warning
## 
### 
Smoke-ups are out, giving their ominous warning to all who have been !
a little lax iti keeping up with their studies. By their sheer formality they
convey an impression of evil portent. The freshmen, and they have re
ceived a high percentage of the total output, are particularly terrified by
receiving this document. Those who received double portions are more
than terrified.
But smoke-ups aren't serious if they are taken in the proper spirit.
They arc merely a red light to give warning of danger ahead. If those who
received the regrets of the Scholarship Committee do some real work the
rest of the quarter they will be able to pull through and not be forced to
have an expedient case of weak eyes.
Members of the Daily staff will meet at 1 o'clock today.
