EVERYBODY MAKE WHOOPEE!
The alcoholic days have come, the
happiest of the year, as the Poet
said. Whoops for the Big Game! Once
each annum comes a time when all
vestige *of dignity must slip away
from even the most didactic and dod
dering of dodoes; there comes a time
when the Class of '1)7 excitedly shells
peanuts down each other's backs;
when the Class of '98, leaping to its
feet as the Golden Bear is spilled for
a loss, utters shrieks of wild abandon
and pounds everybody's derbies
snugly over their ears.
\OWIE!
There has been a certain amount
of criticism by spurious bacteria not
affiliated with this institution —criti-
cism of the Stanford rooting section.
They do not know, as we have known
all along, that in these earlier games
we have been saving our voices for
the world's greatest event —the con
test next Saturday wherein Pop and
his gang are going to commit taxi
dermy on the Berkeley Bear.
WHOOPEE!
Is the Stanford rooting section go
ing to be outyelled next Saturday by
Horace McGuffy, '95, who, though
handicapped by the necessity of hold
ing his false teeth in with one hand,
nevertheless will be able, when Cap
tain Roas' Biff Hoffman slips over
for another touchdown, to emit a
wild, exultant yowl that can be heard
in Petaluma? No, friends —a thousand
times no!
HUZZUSH!
For we are going to be there next
Saturday, there in the great, flowing
bowl at Berkeley, yelling from 2:15

to 5:00 P.M., Pacific Coast Time,
singing in victory or defeat, in tune
ox* not, as the case may be —for what
is a mere tune when heap noise is
what is needed?
ETAOIN SHRDLU! SHRDLU!
Some of us may be giving a Sky
rocket —others the New Spell—others
singing Son of a Gambolier or Come
Fasten the Band—still others uttering
unintelligible screams —who cares!
The general effect will be two and a
half hours of such hubbub and glori
ous commotion as human ear ne'er
trembled to before!
YIP-YOWIE!
So leave us rally round tomorrow
night at the Bonfire to cremate the
Berkeley Ursus! Leave us mill about
thereafter for two days whilst our
courses suffer woeful negloct! Let us
then migrate unanimously to Berke
ley! Leave us climb telephone poles,
poke policemen in the ribs, derail
street cars, and then, swarming into
the Berkeley Stadium, produce such
din as to agitate delicate eardrums
throughout California!
Who said anything about being
downhearted! Who said that Pop
hasn't the finest material on the
Coast! Who said the Stanford section
can't cut loose and yell! If there is
anyone, at the conclusion of that
game, who is able to speak above a
whisper, who has any sort of a larynx
left, we will cut out his heart and
feed it to him.
From right now until 5:00 P.M. Sat
urday, and from there on far, far
into the night, the one big idea shall
be —everybody make whoopee!
—Winston Norman.

ous commotion as human ear ne'er
trembled to before!
YIP-YOWIE!
So leave us rally round tomorrow
night at the Bonfire to cremate the
Berkeley Ursus! Leave us mill about
thereafter for two days whilst our
courses suffer woeful negloct! Let us
then migrate unanimously to Berke
ley! Leave us climb telephone poles,
poke policemen in the ribs, derail
street cars, and then, swarming into
the Berkeley Stadium, produce such
din as to agitate delicate eardrums
throughout California!
Who said anything about being
downhearted! Who said that Pop
hasn't the finest material on the
Coast! Who said the Stanford section
can't cut loose and yell! If there is
anyone, at the conclusion of that
game, who is able to speak above a
whisper, who has any sort of a larynx
left, we will cut out his heart and
feed it to him.
From right now until 5:00 P.M. Sat
urday, and from there on far, far
into the night, the one big idea shall
be —everybody make whoopee!
—Winston Norman.
EVERYBODY MAKE WHOOPEE!
The alcoholic days have come, the
happiest of the year, as the Poet
said. Whoops for the Big Game! Once
each annum comes a time when all
vestige *of dignity must slip away
from even the most didactic and dod
dering of dodoes; there comes a time
when the Class of '1)7 excitedly shells
peanuts down each other's backs;
when the Class of '98, leaping to its
feet as the Golden Bear is spilled for
a loss, utters shrieks of wild abandon
and pounds everybody's derbies
snugly over their ears.
\OWIE!
There has been a certain amount
of criticism by spurious bacteria not
affiliated with this institution —criti-
cism of the Stanford rooting section.
They do not know, as we have known
all along, that in these earlier games
we have been saving our voices for
the world's greatest event —the con
test next Saturday wherein Pop and
his gang are going to commit taxi
dermy on the Berkeley Bear.
WHOOPEE!
Is the Stanford rooting section go
ing to be outyelled next Saturday by
Horace McGuffy, '95, who, though
handicapped by the necessity of hold
ing his false teeth in with one hand,
nevertheless will be able, when Cap
tain Roas' Biff Hoffman slips over
for another touchdown, to emit a
wild, exultant yowl that can be heard
in Petaluma? No, friends —a thousand
times no!
HUZZUSH!
For we are going to be there next
Saturday, there in the great, flowing
bowl at Berkeley, yelling from 2:15

to 5:00 P.M., Pacific Coast Time,
singing in victory or defeat, in tune
ox* not, as the case may be —for what
is a mere tune when heap noise is
what is needed?
ETAOIN SHRDLU! SHRDLU!
Some of us may be giving a Sky
rocket —others the New Spell—others
singing Son of a Gambolier or Come
Fasten the Band—still others uttering
unintelligible screams —who cares!
The general effect will be two and a
half hours of such hubbub and glori
ous commotion as human ear ne'er
trembled to before!
