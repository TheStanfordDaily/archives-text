The Editor, Sir:
It is commonly observed that most
people evidence little active apprecia
tion of some of the most beautiful
things of their environment if they
are constant factors therein. Unfor
tunately this seems to be true of the
recitals given faithfully by Mr. Allen
in the Chapel.
The small audiences, which seem to
be the rule, are not due entirely, of !
course, to lack of appreciation, for
important matters keep many stu
dents away at the concert hours. |
Nevertheless, the attendance in a
measure reflects student attitude to
ward the cultural opportunities of
fered by Mr. Allen iu his exquisite
interpretations.
This letter is just a plea to the
campus group to show the high es- I
teem in which the concerts are held
by most of the music-loving students
and to urge that this appreciation be
expressed while Mr. Allen is still in
our midst rather than after the con
certs may have been discontinued for
apparent lack of student interest.

j The Editor, Sir:
Before various of our recent foot
; ball Karnes, the band has played be
! fore seating itself a song of great
dignity and solemnity, "Hail, Hail,
Hail." The conflicting effects of this
song upon various members of the
rooting section are rather puzzling to
i one who knows nothing about it.
Some of us remain seated and hatted;
some of us stand and bare our heads;
some of us compromise by doing one
tiling and not the other. Anyway, the
beauty o£ the song must be more than
somewhat impaired by the arguments
and recriminations of the various fac
tions.
If through your columns, or by an
nouncement of the yell-leader at the
i Big Game next Saturday, a general
proclamation defining the appropriate
posture of the body and location of
, the hat can be made, I think our op
ponents may be more impressed with
the result.
Very truly yours,
