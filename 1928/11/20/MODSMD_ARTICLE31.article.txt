"Judgment Day." By Norman Davey.
Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill. 1928.
$2.50.)
An intriguingly provocating novel
with a theme as old as the Ages. But
after all is there any theme that is
not, fundamentally, as old as Man?
It was on a quiet summer evening
that the judgment of the Almighty j
fell on the little English town of
Quaire. And all those persons whose
names began with A were brought
before the bar of the Everlasting
Justice. Then there paraded in turn
before the supreme judgment seat a ;
hodge-podge array.
There was the minister of the Gos
pel, whose morality existed in the
literal sense only; the tippling Ameri-
I can representative of the Y.M.C.A.;
the old maid who had led a life
! strictly virtuous in the light of ortho
dox morals; the society girl angling
I for a wealthy catch, and her mother ,
| who helped her by putting the worm
lon the hook; the ancient collector of
entomological specimens, and his
daughter who was a little too fond '
of men. These and others have their j
fate ordained according to their j
merits and demerits.
Although one cannot always agree !
with the verdicts of the Almighty, |
one must concede them interesting, \
and very often unexpected. Mr. j
Davey's conception of tlie Almighty is j
of one who is not immune to human
prejudices and emotions; he is more
like a rather arrogant Justice picking j
culprits to pieces. But then, the i
reader would probably be bored to i
(ears if the Great Arbiter displayed {
i an all-encompassing tolerance and a |
vast impassiveness in bis Judgments. |
Is it human nature to enjoy imperfec- \
tion, and to have a tendency to be
oppressed by a pariHie of perfection
before the eyes?
The author evidently enjoys bring- j

ing all these people before the judg
ment-seat. The reader enjoys it too,
because the treatment is neither dog
matic nor sermonizing, and is in the
hands of a skillful writer.
