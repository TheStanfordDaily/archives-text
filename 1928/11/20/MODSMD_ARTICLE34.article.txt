November 19th—
Did miss out on the refreshment
committee last night to the Bonfire,
anil so did make sure this morning,
by quickly offering my services to
everyone who seems connected with
it, that I will be in the group tonight.
For not only am I anxious to demon
strate my class spirit, and naturally
curious to find how the freshmen re
ceive such a "spontaneous demonstra
tion," which is truly a "noble ex
periment" since coffee is after all
coffee, but also I am very glad indeed
to enjoy the thrill of being out of
Roble Hall honestly at twelve-thirty
on a week night.

Did read the public prints quite
carefully this morning, and did find
much of interest. It seems there is a
rumor that someone is planning to
set the Bonfire alight ahead of time,
but do hear the words bandied about
that it will be just another group of
high school boys. And I do think it
would be a great shame, and do hope
that this group of Certain Students
will surely inspect the excess supply
of the S.P. ties before anything very
definite is done.
♦ * »
And do also read a letter in the
Campus Opinion, which did discomfit
me greatly. Someone must have heard
about the agitation I display when I
am forced to go out on the Tooner
ville to the campus, albeit I do not
mind so greatly now that 1 have
struck up an acquaintance with the
conductor, who is most pleasant and
agreeable, and who does hold his car
till the very last minute while I look
for friends going campusward, with
out offense, and did once tell me not
to get on his street car for another
five minutes, just in case someone
might come along.
But it seems that a young beau
named "Scoop" believes that sucli
things should be on a contractual
basis, which is fair enough, but in
asmuch as my uncle does not let mc
take his car back from week-ends
very often, and inasmuch as I find
the crossing at University Avenue
and Palm Drive most fearsome when
I am lifted above the pedestrian
class, I fear I shall not be able tc
make an example of myself.
But if I were as fine a driver as
most of the young men on this cam
pus fancy themselves I should most
surely stop on every pretext to offer
rides. Am thinking mo3t seriously oi
applying to Miss Mazie Roddy, who
does advertise in the Daily her danc
ing lessons, for do hear that she is
directing some of the choruses of the
Football Gaieties this year, and I
should like to understand their num
bers.

Roble Hall honestly at twelve-thirty
on a week night.

Did read the public prints quite
carefully this morning, and did find
much of interest. It seems there is a
rumor that someone is planning to
set the Bonfire alight ahead of time,
but do hear the words bandied about
that it will be just another group of
high school boys. And I do think it
would be a great shame, and do hope
that this group of Certain Students
will surely inspect the excess supply
of the S.P. ties before anything very
definite is done.

And do also read a letter in the
Campus Opinion, which did discomfit
me greatly. Someone must have heard
about the agitation I display when I
am forced to go out on the Tooner
ville to the campus, albeit I do not
mind so greatly now that 1 have
struck up an acquaintance with the
conductor, who is most pleasant and
agreeable, and who does hold his car
till the very last minute while I look
for friends going campusward, with
out offense, and did once tell me not
to get on his street car for another
five minutes, just in case someone
might come along.
But it seems that a young beau
named "Scoop" believes that sucli
things should be on a contractual
basis, which is fair enough, but in
asmuch as my uncle does not let mc
take his car back from week-ends
very often, and inasmuch as I find
the crossing at University Avenue
and Palm Drive most fearsome when
I am lifted above the pedestrian
class, I fear I shall not be able tc
make an example of myself.
But if I were as fine a driver as
most of the young men on this cam
pus fancy themselves I should most
surely stop on every pretext to offer
rides. Am thinking mo3t seriously oi
applying to Miss Mazie Roddy, who
does advertise in the Daily her danc
ing lessons, for do hear that she is
directing some of the choruses of the
Football Gaieties this year, and I
should like to understand their num
bers.
November 19th—
Did miss out on the refreshment
committee last night to the Bonfire,
anil so did make sure this morning,
by quickly offering my services to
everyone who seems connected with
it, that I will be in the group tonight.
For not only am I anxious to demon
strate my class spirit, and naturally
curious to find how the freshmen re
ceive such a "spontaneous demonstra
tion," which is truly a "noble ex
periment" since coffee is after all
coffee, but also I am very glad indeed
to enjoy the thrill of being out of
Roble Hall honestly at twelve-thirty
on a week night.
