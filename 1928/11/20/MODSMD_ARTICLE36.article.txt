# WILSON ACQUIRES PAIR OF OCELOTS FROM VENEZUELA
## 
### 
"The combination of a hobby for
queer pets and a position in Vene
zuela as a geologist led to my ac
quiring a pair of ocelots," said Jo
seph G. Wilson of 740 Homer Avenue,
Palo Alto, as an explanation of his
possessing these strange animals.
The cats which Mr. Wilson owns are,
so far as has been able to learn, the
only tame animals of this species in
the United States.
Found in South America
According to Wilson, ocelots are
found in Central and South America,
and must be captured at an early
age if they are to be tamed at all.
One of his cats, Sheba by name, he
bought from a native in Venezuela
when she was only a few weeks old.
She was raised on milk and cooked
meat, very carefully handled, and be
came more tractable and affectionate
than most house cats.
The other cat, called i'epe, was
purchased in i'orto Colombia, Colom
bia, as a mate for Sheba. However,
lie had been mishandled and fed on
raw meat, and, despite Mr. Wilson's
careful training, is still a little hard
to handle. A peculiarity of his actions
is a greater liking for women than
tor men.
Guard Wilson's Automobile
Both animals are trained to lead
on a leash, avers Wilson, and may be
taken through downtown streets
without trouble, despite the crow r ds
which usually gather about them.
They enjoy riding in the Wilson auto
mobile, and guard the car when the
Wilsons leave it.
The cats themselves are beautiful,
lithe, long-barrelled creatures, about
a foot high by two and one-half feet
long. They have blunt heads with
luminous, agate eyes. Many black
stripes and rings set off their lus
trous coats. In their natural habitat
the cats live largely in trees and
prey on small monkeys and birds.
