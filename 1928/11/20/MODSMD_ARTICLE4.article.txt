# DR. STARR TO DISCOURSE ON JAPAN, KOREA
## Prominent Anthropologist Is Well Acquainted With Eastern Culture 
### 
"Ofuda Hakase," meaning religious
poster, is the nickname that the Japa
nese give to Dr. Frederick Starr who
will speak on "Japan and Korea" at
7:30 o'clock tonight in the Little
Theatre. He has acquired this name
because he has traveled all over Ja
pan on foot, visiting all the shrines,
studying the different insignia, and
has the largest collection of religious
posters, pictures, and regalia of Japan
that has been made.
Well-Known in Japan
"Dr. Starr is very well-known in
Japan, even better known than in the
United States," said Professor Ya
mato Ichihashi when interviewed yes
terday concerning this prominent an
thropologist. "On his travels in Ja
pan, he always stops at Japanese inns
so that he knows intimately the life
of the Japanese. He is very well
qualified to lecture on the life of
Japan, and on the cultural aspects he
is one of the unique students we have
in this country," said Professor Ichi
hashi.
"In the same way Dr. Starr has in
terested himself in the life of the
Korean people."
Written 15 Books
Dr. Starr has written 15 books.
Most of his work has been done in
Japan, Korea, Philippine Islands, and
Mexico. Last year he lectured at Stan
ford on Mexico. Perhaps his best
known book is "Korean Buddhism,"
and his most recent is "Fujiyama,
the Sacred Mountain of Japan."

At one time Dr. Starr was in charge
of ethnology at the American Museum
of Natural History, and taught at
the University of Chicago for some
time. Not long ago he led an expe
dition into the Congo Free State to
investigate conditions there.
