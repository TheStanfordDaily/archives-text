# MAJOR ERICKSON FINISHES AERIAL MAP OF CAMPUS
## 
### 
An aerial photography map thirteen
feet square, covering the whole Stanford
estate of nearly thirty square miles, has
just been completed by Major H. A.
Erickson. University officials are now
trying to find a place to put the map so
that it may be seen by the public.
Lieutenant Norman Goddard did the
flying for this work, which was begun
last July. Two maps were made, one
twelve feet square of Palo Alto, which
the councihnen will use for city planning
in the future. The Stanford map was
made with similar ends in view.
Both of these enormous pictures arc
made from two 108 by 10 inch photo
graphs fitted together and enlarged to a
200-feet-to-the-inch scale. They are the
largest ever known to have been made to
scale, and the work is so perfect that no
seams can be discovered where the small
pictures join.
Aerial mapping is done ten times as
fast as ordinary surveying and at one
tenth of the cost. By using a stereoscope,
contours can be read accurately, and the
elevation of any certain point can be de
termined to within less than a foot.
Location of trees is probably the most
unusual features of the Stanford map.
The thousands of oaks on the Farm are
accurately shown as circles an inch in
diameter, so that a census could be taken
of them.
