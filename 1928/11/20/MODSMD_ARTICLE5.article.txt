# CHAPARRAL'S BIG GAME NUMBER ON QUAD TOMORROW
## 
### 
"Over and above the fact that certain
railroads will undoubtedly have several
wrecked and dilapidated cars on Sunday
morning," said the Old Boy as he sol
emnly adjusted his long gray beard over
his Adam's apple, "there will be an added
attraction at the annual tussle at the Ber
keley Stadium this Saturday. Now that
my trusty pals have won a moral vic
tory over the highly touted Daily eleven,
we have decided to show our knowledge
of the great college game by putting out
the Chaparral's Big Game Number."

Berk Anthony has cartooned the foot
ball team for the benefit of those who
will not have the funds to purchase a
program at the big classic. Mike Ely,
editor of the Chaparral in 1924, has sent
in a special bedtime story for the little
bears. Descriptions of tricky football
plays entitled "Mechanics of Football, or
How to Get a Touchdown in Three Min
utes" by Carl Shoup is an article Pop
Warner might well look into and which
might lead to a possible "C" formation.
A full page drawing by Ted Krough and
and a page of Scotchograms (with apolo
gies to Judge) written between the Bear
and Card coaches are among the tidbits
appearing in this issue. Oh, yes, and it
might be added that the famous sport
writer, cartoonist, and one-time cham
pion hurdler, Keg Murray, Stanford '16,
has drawn the cover.
Not only have the Hammer and Coffin
men provided food for thought for the
next few days by this dazzling publica
tion, but they have also decided to loosen
their purse-strings and donate MO "Bears
Beware" stickers to the populace. They
may be obtained at the Bookstore or the
Chappie office and are meant to clutter
up windshields.
