# SPORTS OF 1928
## Football Olympians 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
That Football and Track mix is a
statement that cannot be denied by
anyone who has followed both
sports, even casually, for a few years.
There have been too many cases of
men like Bowman of Syracuse, Locke
of Nebraska, Craig of Michigan —
speed boys on both cinderpath and
gridiron—and Hills of Princeton, An
derson of the University of Southern
California, Lieb of Notre Dame —
weight-throwers who performed in the
line with distinction as well. Jim
Thorpe, of course, was the greatest
track star who ever played football,
or, if you wish, the greatest football
player who ever became an Olympic
hero.
But, to get down to the business at
hand, the 1928 Olympic team had
either as track and field athletes,
coaches, members of the crews, or
boxing, wrestling, and lacrosse teams,
at least a dozen varsity football
players. True, there were no Jim
Thorpes, but there was an abundant
supply of talent nevertheless, and
quite a snappy football team could
be picked from the array that sailed
on board the S.S. "President Roose
velt" last July.
For your line you would have John
Anderson of Cornell, Tim Clark of
Harvard, Herm Brlx of Washington,
Jim Corson of the Olympic Club, and

| star who coached the Johns Hopkins
J lacrosse team. In the backfield there
I is an abundant supply of speed and
! power, with ball-carriers such as Bar
buti of Syracuse, Snider of Auburn,
| Churchill of Oklahoma, Cuhel of
; lowa, and Rothert of Stanford. Dink
Templeton, assistant to Coach Law
-1 sen Robertson, could probably out
; punt the rest of them, while the all
: around boys, Berlinger of Penn and
| Stewart of U.S.C., would come in
; handy as reserve material.
