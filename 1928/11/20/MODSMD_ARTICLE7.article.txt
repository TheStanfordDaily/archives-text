# Senate Probes Klamath Indian Neglect Charge
## Power Companies Merciless In Gaining Own Ends Avers Witness 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 19. (/P)—
Lurid charges of persecution of the
Klamath River Indians by the power
companies, including murder and ar
son, climaxed other bitter testimony
here today during the first session of
the Senatorial investigation of Indian
affairs in the State.
Backed by United States Senator
Hiram W. Johnson, women's clubs
and the California Indian Defense As
sociation, Mrs. Mary Gist Dornbach,
called the "Joan of Arc" of the Klam
ath River Indians, made a fiery wit
ness before the committee which is
hearing the complaints of neglect and
maladministration directed against
the Federal Indian Bureau.
Power Companies Blamed
"The power corporations have stop
ped at nothing to get power sites on
the Klamath River," Mrs. Dornbach
testified. "My own sister was mur
dered and our house burned by agents
of the power companies in their at
tempts to drive the people from the
district," she asserted.
If this dam were to be built, they
said, the salmon fishing in the Klam
ath River, which industry supports
the Indians in the reservation, would
be destroyed.
Other Witnesses Testify
Other witnesses whose charges
against the Indian Bureau include the
maladministration of Indian affairs,
"shameful neglect" of their health
and education and illegalities in the
allotting of lands were, L. A. Barrett
of the United States Bureau of For
estry, Mrs. Florence Ames, nurse with
the State Board of Health, and Wal
ter M. Dickie, State Health officer.
Barrett said that only 3 per cent of
the land allotted to the Indians could
be farmed. The land for the most
part is sagebrush and rock, Barrett
testified.
Indian Bureau Flayed
Mrs. Ames bitterly flayed the
"shameful neglect" of the Indian Bu
reau and said that conditions were
"almost beyond belief."
"My survey shows that 70 per cent
of the Indian children die from lack
of attention," she said. "I have seen
a mother give birth to a baby in a
sand pit under the blazing sun with
out medical attention of any kind —
families of five and six, several with
contagious diseases living in one
room —other instances of pitiable
suffering and poverty."

called the "Joan of Arc" of the Klam
ath River Indians, made a fiery wit
ness before the committee which is
hearing the complaints of neglect and
maladministration directed against
the Federal Indian Bureau.
Power Companies Blamed
"The power corporations have stop
ped at nothing to get power sites on
the Klamath River," Mrs. Dornbach
testified. "My own sister was mur
dered and our house burned by agents
of the power companies in their at
tempts to drive the people from the
district," she asserted.
If this dam were to be built, they
said, the salmon fishing in the Klam
ath River, which industry supports
the Indians in the reservation, would
be destroyed.
Other Witnesses Testify
Other witnesses whose charges
against the Indian Bureau include the
maladministration of Indian affairs,
"shameful neglect" of their health
and education and illegalities in the
allotting of lands were, L. A. Barrett
of the United States Bureau of For
estry, Mrs. Florence Ames, nurse with
the State Board of Health, and Wal
ter M. Dickie, State Health officer.
Barrett said that only 3 per cent of
the land allotted to the Indians could
be farmed. The land for the most
part is sagebrush and rock, Barrett
testified.
Indian Bureau Flayed
Mrs. Ames bitterly flayed the
"shameful neglect" of the Indian Bu
reau and said that conditions were
"almost beyond belief."
"My survey shows that 70 per cent
of the Indian children die from lack
of attention," she said. "I have seen
a mother give birth to a baby in a
sand pit under the blazing sun with
out medical attention of any kind —
families of five and six, several with
contagious diseases living in one
room —other instances of pitiable
suffering and poverty."
