Will You Be Prepared Jor
Business
Leadership?
WHEN you finish College will you
have a knowledge of business
fundamentals which will enable
you to succeed? Or are you facing
years of apprenticeship — the trial and
error method —which may never lead
to success?
Babson Institute training serves as an j
excellent transition from College to
the business world. Here you would
be taught the fundamental laws of Fi
nance, Production and Distribution.
By frequent trips to factories and busi
ness organizations you would be shown
how these laws are applied in actual
business life. You would be in a small
conference group, working in a busi
ness environment, under the personal
direction of business executives.
You may enter at the beginning of
any quarter term and complete the
work in nine consecutive months.
