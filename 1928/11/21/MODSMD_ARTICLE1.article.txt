# HEINECKE SICK; TWO OTHER GRID MEN OFF LINEUP
## Pop Is Pessimistic as Card's Chances of Winning Game With California Dwindle Attempts to Make Defense Against Passing Equal to One Used by Bear Varsity 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
One of the dreaded Horsemen of the
Apocalypse, sickness, appears to have de
~si&ns on the Stanford football outfit. He
struck another blow to the varsity last
night when Walt Heinecke was sent to
the hospital with influenza, raising the
sick and injured list to three, Dick Wor
sen and Tiny Sell man being the other
two men who are out of the lineup at
the present time.
Heinecke, the little signal caller and
.star center, took part in practice yester
xlay, but became ill immediately after
wards and was immediately taken to the
Palo Alto hospital. Sellman and Worden
were both absent from practice, Sellman,
ill with flu, and Wordcu suffering with
injuries received more than three weeks

In addition to these worries, Pop War- j
ner has to think of perfecting the Stan- j
ford defense, a branch of the game in
which the Cards were noticeably weak!
against the passes and plunges of Chuck
Carroll & Co. of Washington last Sat
urday. If Pop has anything to say about
it, the Stanford defense will not be in
adequate against the Bears, for he has
spent the whole practice sessions this
week on pass defense drills.
While students are gathering bonfire j
timber from the surrounding hillsides the j
Stanford coaching staff is wondering just |
how many of its first team players will!
be able to play Saturday. The gloomy
prospect of Heinecke and Sellman being j
out of the lineup only adds to Pop's |
pessimism. The veteran coach frankly j
admits that, at its best, the Stanford j
team has enough power to worry the i
Bears considerably, but at the same time j
he confesses that he doesn't know wheth- \
er his team will muster up its potential j
strength and play "heads up" football, j
and whether or not the forward wall will '
be intact by game time.
