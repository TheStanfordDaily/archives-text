# LOUIS GRAVEURE TO GIVE PROGRAM HERE TOMORROW
## 
### ALICE INGRAHAM 
One of the most remarkable phe
nomena of the musical world for many
years is Louis Graveure's recent
change from baritone to tenor. Stan
ford will have a chance to hear the
effects of this change when the noted
singer sings in the Assembly Hall to
morrow night under the auspices of
jtlie Peninsula Musical Association.
Graveure abandoned his well-estab
j lished position as a leading recital
! baritone last year, and made his debut
as a tenor in February 1928. He dis
covered his tenor potentialities when
trying to show a student by example
how to reach certain high notes, and
after experimenting became con
vinced that his voice had changed.
Graveure sang in the A.S.S.U. Con
cert Series in 1926, still in his role
:as baritone. His concert tomorrow
| night, which will begin at 8:15 o'clock,
i will be entirely tenor. It will include
compositions by Dvorak, Gounod,
Massenet, Verdi, Handel, as well as
several folk songs.
Tickets are on sale at Crandall's in
Palo Alto, and are priced at $1 for
I balcony seats and $1.50 for seats
! downstairs.
