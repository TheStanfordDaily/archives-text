# REBUILT CALIFORNIA FUNERAL PYRE WILL BURN TONIGHT
## SPIRITS OF STUDENTS RISE AS NEW BONFIRE LOOMS SKYWARD MATERIALS GATHERED FROM ALL PENINSULA AS STUDENT BODY TURNS OUT EN MASSE TO REBUILD STRUCTURE; S.P. RUSHES TIES TO SCENE OF FIRE 
### 
r p' HIS MORNING, less than twenty-four hours after the original 1932 Big
Game Bonfire prematurely burst into flames, a second and greater pyre,
representing the united efforts of the Associated Students, is rising beside
the smoking embers of the first. The new fire will be completed this afternoon
and will await the conclusion of the Big Game Rally starting at 7:30 o'clock
tonight to seal in flames the doom of the Golden Bear.
Already sufficient material for the fire has been gathered and exceptional
progress in the construction has been made; but, in order to finish the pile
by tonight, it will be necessary for the entire student body to work today,
according to Dave Jacobson, chairman of the Rally Committee.
TIME BOMB EXPLOSION
Testimony of guards on duty at the time the flames were first seen yester
day morning at 9:55 o'clock indicates that the explosion of a time bomb
started the blaze, the bomb probably having been placed in one of the
tunnels under the heap of wood sometime Monday night. The freshman

soccer squad was the principal unit
guarding the pyre that night. There
was no member of the Rally Commit
tee there until 12 o'clock. After 12
o'clock Sergius Klotz and Russell
Robinson of the Rally Committee
were in charge. There were twenty
or more guards at the spot all night
long, and they regularly patrolled the
vicinity near the giant structure,
Klotz declared.
Stanford Spirit Roused
From the instant when the flames
first shot skyward, to destroy in a
few hours the labor of the freshmen
for a month, the students, almost to a
man, joined in rebuilding the pile.
It was necessary that the entire stu
dent body aid in replacing the rav
aged ett'ort of the class of '32, and
the entire student body turned out.
Hundreds of students toiled yesterday
and will toil today to prove that the
mucli-vaunted Stanford spirit is not
a tradition of the past but an actual
ity of the present.
The appeal sent out to business peo
ple and residents of the Peninsula
and San Jose was generously re
sponded to, everyone within many
miles of the Farm co-operating in
helping Stanford to rebuild its bon
fire. The Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, which has aided in con
structing so many past fires, contri
buted six carloads of ties, four of
which arrived on the campus last
night at 10:30 o'clock. The remainder
are scheduled to reach here this
morning at 10 o'clock. This number
of ties is twice that which was used
in building the original structure.
Flood Lights Set Up
Poles for the framework were con
tributed by the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company and the Pacific
Gas and Electric Company and were
erected by a service truck of the for
mer company, operated by J. W. Hall.
The P.G. and E. Company set up the
many floodlights and searchlights
which made it possible for the work
to go on all night.
Several dozen trucks, loaned by the
many Stanford supporters on the
Peninsula, have been in constant use
since yesterday's conflagration, gath
