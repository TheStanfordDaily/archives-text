# Bear Big ‘C’Takes On Hues Of Chameleon As Cards Are Suspected

"It was red last night
"It was white the night before
"It's gonna be gold today
"We'll never be blue any more."
In parody of song and pact the
above expresses the chameleon char
acteristics of the Big C at Berkeley.
In brief, the Big C was its custom
ary white yesterday afternoon.
Last night it was painted red.
Before sunrise it was supposed to
have been painted gold by ardent
California rooters.
It appears from evidence at hand
that a number of Stanford under
graduates will be blue before the sun
rises again.
Obviously this is a color story.
The Big C was actually painted red
last night and it appears that it was
done by Stanford students. The first
j clew to the vandalism came by tele
phone last, night when an unknown
person called the Stanford Daily from
I a Berkeley phone and announced that
! the deed had been done.
Members of the Daily staff in turn
called the Daily Californian from
which office investigators were sent
to the site of the Big C. They re
turned and reported facts as rumored
and In substantiation of their story
that Stanford students were responsi-
I hie, produced a wallet allegedly found
lat the C and containing a Stanford
! registration card. The wallet was ob
j viously not a plant for it contained a
j rooter's ticket for the Big Game.
Other evidence pointing to the al
i leged guilt of Stanford undergradu
i ates included the appearance at the
| bonfire last evening of a number of
| men students with red paint on their
; hands and bold boasts on their lips.
! Workers at the fire believed the
! party to be joking and urged them to
Igo wash their hands and give their
i tongues a rest.
They did.
But the rumor persisted and at last
the real news came from the Daily
j Californian staff.
The name of the Stanford under
graduate, whose wallet was found
| near the Big C, is being withheld
pending further investigation, but it
; will probably be published by the
Daily Californian and city news
-1 papers.
"I refuse to make any statement,"
said the student referred to above
when reached by telephone shortly
! after midnight. He admitted, how
| ever, that he had been in Berkeley
i with other Stanford students.
I It is supposed that the painting of
! the Cis a retaliatory measure for the
I premature burning of the Stanford
I pyre early yesterday, for which Cali
| fomians refuse to assume responsi
i bility.
Under present Stanford rulings, any
student convicted of invasion of the
| California campus is liable to expul
sion from the University.
An inter-university pact exists, un-
I der the terms of which the Big Game
may be called off if students officially
! invade the opposing campuses.
