# The 						Sleeper Has Awakened
## 
### 
The Daily owes every Stanford man and woman an apology; an
absolute and complete apology. In an editorial which appeared Monday
the statement was made that if the Big Game bonfire was prematurely
burned that it could not be rebuilt in time for the rally.
This was a mistake and the Daily admits it. No one would believe
that the same group of Stanford students which has filled the rooting
sections at every game could accomplish this feat. But all Stanford is
now awake after a deep slumber and the Big Game bonfire will arise
again as it did in the good old days of 1925.
There probably does not exist an alumnus who will not glow with
pleasure when he reads of the impressive display of spirit which has been
shown by every Stanford man and woman. He will chuckle silently and"
say that they still have the same old fight on the campus.
But the Daily would like to know just exactly why precautions were
not taken to see that the bonfire was not burned. This job was turned
over to the Rally Committee and they evidently fell down on their job.
Of course it was partly the fault of the freshmen, but the freshmen
couldn't be expected to take the burning of the bonfire seriously and
take the Daily's warning seriously when members of the Rally Commit
tee scoffed at it. These men knew what had happened in 1925; they
should have provided some protection to take care of a recurrence of
this happening.
For the present that can be forgotten while everyone takes care of
the immediate task which confronts Stanford. From the determined
looks on the faces of the Stanford men and women who are working to
see tliat Stanford shall have its traditional pyre, it is needless to say that
the fire will burn at 8:30 o'clock tonight as was previously planned.
The Daily is fittingly proud about this, but at the same time it be
lieves the premature burning of bonfires has ceased to be funny. Immedi
ate steps should be taken to keep the bonfire small enough so that the
freshmen will not be forced to waste so much time building this structure
that they lose interest in guarding it. It could be built in one week and
enough men could be on hand to prevent these premature conflagrations
from becoming traditional.

looks on the faces of the Stanford men and women who are working to
see tliat Stanford shall have its traditional pyre, it is needless to say that
the fire will burn at 8:30 o'clock tonight as was previously planned.
The Daily is fittingly proud about this, but at the same time it be
lieves the premature burning of bonfires has ceased to be funny. Immedi
ate steps should be taken to keep the bonfire small enough so that the
freshmen will not be forced to waste so much time building this structure
that they lose interest in guarding it. It could be built in one week and
enough men could be on hand to prevent these premature conflagrations
from becoming traditional.
