Stanford women are all right! When news of the premature burning
of the bonfire was heard they immediately started plans to co-operate
with the Rally Committee in the rebuilding of the structure. They pro
vided food for the workers who toiled all night to insure the California
Bear of a fitting funeral. To do this they staged an impromptu Tag
Day. The Daily has nothing but paeans of congratulation for the dear
old Five Hundred, which has proved, although the rebuilding of the pyre
is a man's job, that a few women can make it much pleasanter.
