# Sam Pepys' Little Niece
## 
### 
November 20th—
What with all this excitement and
everything, my diary must necessar
ily be very brief, for I am so excited
about at last being a necessary part
of the University that I can scarcely
think, for surely a young woman who
has sold forty-five tags, even though
they were to unsuspecting and rather
shy individuals, and I do think that
one man could not speak English and
thought it was a lottery ticket, but
anyway surely such a person is a
very firm part of the University.
Rut among the many thoughts which
are chasing themselves thin in my
head, I am wondering most greatly
if the Certain Senior was on hand
when the pyre went up in flames, and
if he rose to his feet and yelled,
"There is someone cheating in this
room!"
So down to the ashes at various
times today, much abashed by the
large quantities of men that are be
coming more undressed every mo
ment., but much excited nevertheless,
and did find an old but still playable
piano which I did play upon a little,
though I am afraid that the men did
not appreciate my efforts to increase
their morale. And also to Palo Alto
to solicit merchants for contributions,
but did unfortunately go into a hard
ware store, and was turnod down
sharply when I asked for contribu
tions to the Uonflre, and he did query
me If I meant the Palo Alto High
School Pyre.

But was a little dubious of cutting
my classes, so did go to my eleven
o'clock, and was rewarded by a <?ut,
which I did think very generous of
the professor. Do hear many com
ments from upper division students,
.in which they do object that their
classes were not ALL similarly ex
cused, but am not perturbed, for do
| suppose that most of the upperclass
! men enjoyed their vacation in 1925,
j when the Bonfire was also burned.
And do hope and pray that this
new Bonfire will be more than a
j splinter off the old block, or I shall
| expect a very large nigger in the
woodpile, as my aunt Pepys so often
! t?ays.

| expect a very large nigger in the
woodpile, as my aunt Pepys so often
! t?ays.
November 20th—
What with all this excitement and
everything, my diary must necessar
ily be very brief, for I am so excited
about at last being a necessary part
of the University that I can scarcely
think, for surely a young woman who
has sold forty-five tags, even though
they were to unsuspecting and rather
shy individuals, and I do think that
one man could not speak English and
thought it was a lottery ticket, but
anyway surely such a person is a
very firm part of the University.
Rut among the many thoughts which
are chasing themselves thin in my
head, I am wondering most greatly
if the Certain Senior was on hand
when the pyre went up in flames, and
if he rose to his feet and yelled,
"There is someone cheating in this
room!"
So down to the ashes at various
times today, much abashed by the
large quantities of men that are be
coming more undressed every mo
ment., but much excited nevertheless,
and did find an old but still playable
piano which I did play upon a little,
though I am afraid that the men did
not appreciate my efforts to increase
their morale. And also to Palo Alto
to solicit merchants for contributions,
but did unfortunately go into a hard
ware store, and was turnod down
sharply when I asked for contribu
tions to the Uonflre, and he did query
me If I meant the Palo Alto High
School Pyre.

But was a little dubious of cutting
my classes, so did go to my eleven
o'clock, and was rewarded by a <?ut,
which I did think very generous of
the professor. Do hear many com
ments from upper division students,
.in which they do object that their
classes were not ALL similarly ex
cused, but am not perturbed, for do
| suppose that most of the upperclass
! men enjoyed their vacation in 1925,
j when the Bonfire was also burned.
And do hope and pray that this
new Bonfire will be more than a
j splinter off the old block, or I shall
| expect a very large nigger in the
woodpile, as my aunt Pepys so often
! t?ays.
