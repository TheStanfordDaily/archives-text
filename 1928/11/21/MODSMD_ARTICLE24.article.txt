The Editor, Sir:
Stanford Students: Do you have to
build up an idol as the symbol of your
spirit? Does Stanford spirit require
a blazing fire to bring it out in its
full intensity? At the Big Game is
there a pile of burning timber to
make you cheer? Do we have to be
incited by flames to express our true
love of our Alma Mater?
Stanford spirit is something deeper,
something more vital. It exists in
every true son. We are eager to show
our college that we are behind it. All
we need is the place and the leader.
We have the energy. Lord knows we
have it. We don't require a roaring
fire to lead us on. We would enjoy it;
we would appreciate the building of
it. But it is not the fire that makes
us cheer, that makes our hearts and

spirits expand in clamor for our Alma
Mater. It is the gathering, the surg
ing mob, the composite expression of
the spirit of every one of us.
Now, shall we expend our energies
in erecting an idol, shall we scour
the country round about for lumber
and logs? Cannot Stanford show the
world that it is her spirit that counts
at her rallies, that without an idol
flaming before us, we can cheer more
lustily even, we can scream more
loudly, we can express our love more
fervently than ever before?
Here is an opportunity for showing
our team, our graduates, our well
wishers, and our opponents that it is
Stanford spirit that drives us on;
that Stanford spirit is the vitalizing
factor in our rallies —and in this, the
greatest of all our rallies. —J. B.
The Editor, Sir: In a recent Campus
Opinion the writer gave the impres
sion that there was an attitude of
apathy and indifference on the part
of the Student Body toward the new
song material.
This may seem so but this illustra
tion should prove it not so. Suppose
you invented a mechanism with a
utilitarian purpose of one hundred
per cent and you hired a hobo who
hadn't the slightest conception of
what it was all about to demonstrate
it for you. Would the public accept
it? No, not because of any indifference
on its part but because the hobo
demonstrator failed to show how it
worked. This nivention would have
sold like hot cakes if the inventor
had hired a competent demonstrator.
Now we can't expect our yell lead
ers to be musicians. Wouldn't it be a
good idea if the Director of the Glee
Club would act as demonstrator in
this case and show us how the songs
work? If not the "Giants in Red" are
doomed to lead a life of mere oblivion
like their predecessor, the "Trojan
Horse."

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford Students: Do you have to
build up an idol as the symbol of your
spirit? Does Stanford spirit require
a blazing fire to bring it out in its
full intensity? At the Big Game is
there a pile of burning timber to
make you cheer? Do we have to be
incited by flames to express our true
love of our Alma Mater?
Stanford spirit is something deeper,
something more vital. It exists in
every true son. We are eager to show
our college that we are behind it. All
we need is the place and the leader.
We have the energy. Lord knows we
have it. We don't require a roaring
fire to lead us on. We would enjoy it;
we would appreciate the building of
it. But it is not the fire that makes
us cheer, that makes our hearts and

spirits expand in clamor for our Alma
Mater. It is the gathering, the surg
ing mob, the composite expression of
the spirit of every one of us.
Now, shall we expend our energies
in erecting an idol, shall we scour
the country round about for lumber
and logs? Cannot Stanford show the
world that it is her spirit that counts
at her rallies, that without an idol
flaming before us, we can cheer more
lustily even, we can scream more
loudly, we can express our love more
fervently than ever before?
Here is an opportunity for showing
our team, our graduates, our well
wishers, and our opponents that it is
Stanford spirit that drives us on;
that Stanford spirit is the vitalizing
factor in our rallies —and in this, the
greatest of all our rallies. —J. B.
The Editor, Sir: In a recent Campus
Opinion the writer gave the impres
sion that there was an attitude of
apathy and indifference on the part
of the Student Body toward the new
song material.
This may seem so but this illustra
tion should prove it not so. Suppose
you invented a mechanism with a
utilitarian purpose of one hundred
per cent and you hired a hobo who
hadn't the slightest conception of
what it was all about to demonstrate
it for you. Would the public accept
it? No, not because of any indifference
on its part but because the hobo
demonstrator failed to show how it
worked. This nivention would have
sold like hot cakes if the inventor
had hired a competent demonstrator.
Now we can't expect our yell lead
ers to be musicians. Wouldn't it be a
good idea if the Director of the Glee
Club would act as demonstrator in
this case and show us how the songs
work? If not the "Giants in Red" are
doomed to lead a life of mere oblivion
like their predecessor, the "Trojan
Horse."
