An American Comedy. Acted by Har
old Lloyd. Directed by W. W.
Stout. (Longman's, Green and Co.
New York,- 1928.)
"To what do you attribute your
success, Mr. Lloyd," And Mr. Lloyd
refuses to blush and dimple and reply
coyly that it is not for him to say.
No, the great comedian faces facts
squarely, and does not even pretend
to think that it was largely luck.
After making the profound observa
tion that the only ultimate answer to
such a question would in his case be:
"I attribute my success to being
born," he adds with a touching mod
esty that enthusiasm, hard work, and
business sense have had much to do
with it. This is probably all very
true, but one expects more from Har
old Lloyd. Somewhere in his book, he
declares that he has learned never
to rudely disappoint his audience. It
is a pity that he turned author be
fore learning how not to disappoint
his reading public.
The book is a disappointment prin
cipally because it is dull. At the out
set Harold Lloyd gives us a fair warn
ing to his readers about this book of
his. He declares: "I am not a funny
man off the screen. I have no desire
to be or knack for being comic in
my off hours. Such comedy as there
will be here will not lie in any con
scious effort of the author to be
cute."
Lloyd's estimate of himself turns
out to be painfully accurate. The
book is not amusing. I doubt if it will
cause even a single wan smile to ap
pear on the face of its reader, for it
is really nothing more than a chron
icle of events, dates, and names.
There is hardly a line to distinguish
it from the autobiography of a politi
cian, say, or a banker, except for the
superficial difference in the type of
events enumerated. To the number
less Lloyd fans who have laughed up
roariously at his comedies, it will be
an unpleasant shock. Their beloved
comedian talks like a professor of
statistics, and his book gives infor
mation like a textbook —in true text
book style.
An American Comedy has one re
deeming feature. Its illustrations are
excellent. Look through all these pic
tures, and read the last chapter of
the book and you may get something
out of It. This last chapter, "Recipes
For a Laugh," has some illuminating
pointers on stock movie methods and
"gags" used in making a •'bmedy.

The Next Chapter or The War Against
the Moon. By Andre Maurois.
(New York: E. P. Button & Com
pany. 1928.)
Those who have fallen into the
habit of expecting from Andre Maurois
either novels or novelized biography
will And a decided but not unpfleasant
sh«ck in this pocket-sized romance.
Tltfs is not the introspective Maurois

of the novels, nor the sympathetic
and psychological biographer. This
latest book of his is marked by a
riotous fantasy and a disillusioned but
amusing satire.
In "The Next Chapter" Maurois as
sails the ugliest side of human nature
—its positive craving for something
to hate and the silly and destructive
wars to which this basest of propensi
ties inevitably leads.
All this masquerades as a sober,
veritable history—a fragment from a
textbook published by the University
of C-mb-e in the year 1962. After ana
lyzing very seriously world conditions
in 1962, when "the last traces of the
havoc wrought by the World War of
1947 had at length disappeared," this
learned work sets forth the changes
that have occurred in the structure of
society. Save as a mere form, demo
cracy has disappeared.
The world is ruled at last, as many
city editors have long felt it cught
to be ruled, by the newspapers. And
the process of consolidation has been
carried so far that all the papers in
the world are now controlled by five
super-magnates of the press—Ger
man, Japanese, English, French, and
American. These five men are univer
sally known as the "Dictators of Pub
lic Opinion." They decide what the
people shall think and feel; and there
fore what the people shall do.
In order to prevent a new war
brewing in 1962, all the papers of the
world whip up a hate against the
moon. But rather than proving to be
a safe vent for emotion, the result
is a great interplanetary war waged
across space.
Yet more and more to this highly
fantastic tale. The value of the book
is as entertainment as as biting sa
tire.

The world is ruled at last, as many
city editors have long felt it cught
to be ruled, by the newspapers. And
the process of consolidation has been
carried so far that all the papers in
the world are now controlled by five
super-magnates of the press—Ger

American. These five men are univer

people shall think and feel; and there
fore what the people shall do.
In order to prevent a new war
brewing in 1962, all the papers of the

An American Comedy. Acted by Har
old Lloyd. Directed by W. W.
Stout. (Longman's, Green and Co.
New York,- 1928.)
"To what do you attribute your
success, Mr. Lloyd," And Mr. Lloyd
refuses to blush and dimple and reply
coyly that it is not for him to say.
No, the great comedian faces facts
squarely, and does not even pretend
to think that it was largely luck.
After making the profound observa
tion that the only ultimate answer to
such a question would in his case be:
"I attribute my success to being
born," he adds with a touching mod
esty that enthusiasm, hard work, and
business sense have had much to do
with it. This is probably all very
true, but one expects more from Har
old Lloyd. Somewhere in his book, he
declares that he has learned never
to rudely disappoint his audience. It
is a pity that he turned author be
fore learning how not to disappoint
his reading public.
The book is a disappointment prin
cipally because it is dull. At the out
set Harold Lloyd gives us a fair warn
ing to his readers about this book of
his. He declares: "I am not a funny
man off the screen. I have no desire
to be or knack for being comic in
my off hours. Such comedy as there
will be here will not lie in any con
scious effort of the author to be
cute."
Lloyd's estimate of himself turns
out to be painfully accurate. The
book is not amusing. I doubt if it will
cause even a single wan smile to ap
pear on the face of its reader, for it
is really nothing more than a chron
icle of events, dates, and names.
There is hardly a line to distinguish
it from the autobiography of a politi
cian, say, or a banker, except for the
superficial difference in the type of
events enumerated. To the number
less Lloyd fans who have laughed up
roariously at his comedies, it will be
an unpleasant shock. Their beloved
comedian talks like a professor of
statistics, and his book gives infor
mation like a textbook —in true text
book style.
An American Comedy has one re
deeming feature. Its illustrations are
excellent. Look through all these pic
tures, and read the last chapter of
the book and you may get something
out of It. This last chapter, "Recipes
For a Laugh," has some illuminating
pointers on stock movie methods and
"gags" used in making a •'bmedy.

The Next Chapter or The War Against
the Moon. By Andre Maurois.
(New York: E. P. Button & Com
pany. 1928.)
Those who have fallen into the
habit of expecting from Andre Maurois
either novels or novelized biography
will And a decided but not unpfleasant
sh«ck in this pocket-sized romance.
Tltfs is not the introspective Maurois

of the novels, nor the sympathetic
and psychological biographer. This
latest book of his is marked by a
riotous fantasy and a disillusioned but
amusing satire.
In "The Next Chapter" Maurois as
sails the ugliest side of human nature
—its positive craving for something
to hate and the silly and destructive
wars to which this basest of propensi
ties inevitably leads.
All this masquerades as a sober,
veritable history—a fragment from a
textbook published by the University
of C-mb-e in the year 1962. After ana
lyzing very seriously world conditions
in 1962, when "the last traces of the
havoc wrought by the World War of
1947 had at length disappeared," this
learned work sets forth the changes
that have occurred in the structure of
society. Save as a mere form, demo
cracy has disappeared.

of the novels, nor the sympathetic
and psychological biographer. This
latest book of his is marked by a
riotous fantasy and a disillusioned but
amusing satire.
In "The Next Chapter" Maurois as
sails the ugliest side of human nature
—its positive craving for something
to hate and the silly and destructive
wars to which this basest of propensi
ties inevitably leads.
All this masquerades as a sober,
veritable history—a fragment from a
textbook published by the University
of C-mb-e in the year 1962. After ana
lyzing very seriously world conditions
in 1962, when "the last traces of the
havoc wrought by the World War of
1947 had at length disappeared," this
learned work sets forth the changes
that have occurred in the structure of
society. Save as a mere form, demo
cracy has disappeared.
The world is ruled at last, as many
city editors have long felt it cught
to be ruled, by the newspapers. And
the process of consolidation has been
carried so far that all the papers in
the world are now controlled by five
super-magnates of the press—Ger
man, Japanese, English, French, and
American. These five men are univer
sally known as the "Dictators of Pub
lic Opinion." They decide what the
people shall think and feel; and there
fore what the people shall do.
In order to prevent a new war
brewing in 1962, all the papers of the
world whip up a hate against the
moon. But rather than proving to be
a safe vent for emotion, the result
is a great interplanetary war waged
across space.
Yet more and more to this highly
fantastic tale. The value of the book
is as entertainment as as biting sa
tire.
An American Comedy. Acted by Har
old Lloyd. Directed by W. W.
Stout. (Longman's, Green and Co.
New York,- 1928.)
"To what do you attribute your
success, Mr. Lloyd," And Mr. Lloyd
refuses to blush and dimple and reply
coyly that it is not for him to say.
No, the great comedian faces facts
squarely, and does not even pretend
to think that it was largely luck.
After making the profound observa
tion that the only ultimate answer to
such a question would in his case be:
"I attribute my success to being
born," he adds with a touching mod
esty that enthusiasm, hard work, and
business sense have had much to do
with it. This is probably all very
true, but one expects more from Har
old Lloyd. Somewhere in his book, he
declares that he has learned never
to rudely disappoint his audience. It
is a pity that he turned author be
fore learning how not to disappoint
his reading public.
The book is a disappointment prin
cipally because it is dull. At the out
set Harold Lloyd gives us a fair warn
ing to his readers about this book of
his. He declares: "I am not a funny
man off the screen. I have no desire
to be or knack for being comic in
my off hours. Such comedy as there
will be here will not lie in any con
scious effort of the author to be
cute."
Lloyd's estimate of himself turns
out to be painfully accurate. The
book is not amusing. I doubt if it will
cause even a single wan smile to ap
pear on the face of its reader, for it
is really nothing more than a chron
icle of events, dates, and names.
There is hardly a line to distinguish
it from the autobiography of a politi
cian, say, or a banker, except for the
superficial difference in the type of
events enumerated. To the number
less Lloyd fans who have laughed up
roariously at his comedies, it will be
an unpleasant shock. Their beloved
comedian talks like a professor of
statistics, and his book gives infor
mation like a textbook —in true text
book style.
An American Comedy has one re
deeming feature. Its illustrations are
excellent. Look through all these pic
tures, and read the last chapter of
the book and you may get something
out of It. This last chapter, "Recipes
For a Laugh," has some illuminating
pointers on stock movie methods and
"gags" used in making a •'bmedy.
