Workers on the Second Big Game
Bonfire are requested not to take the
Memorial Church. It is unwieldy, and
besides would not burn well. Permis
sion is granted to use the Assembly
Hall, in fact it is suggested that this
serve as the foundation for the pile.
Anyone cutting down dead palm trees
will be persecuted to the full extent
of the law, but if they will come
around to the side door we will per
sonally congratulate them.
Watchers last night were requested
to be careful with matches.
A fellow who slept late at Manjza
nita yesterday was agreeably sur
prised when he awoke to find his
room quite warm.
Well, anyway, the first Bonfire was
a noble experiment.
It proved definitely that gasoline
and phosphorus mix even if gasoline
and alcohol don't.
A young collitch student named
Crumm
Whose mind was somewhat out of
plumb,
Said: The Bonfire's a farce an'
Why not try some arson?
He strolled in and planted a bomb.
Students in the reference room at
the library thought the bonfire was
on last night. It was only the heaters.
Perhaps it was all only a • bad
dream. We must go down and see.
"You're just a Big, Game fellow,"
a sympathetic student said to a heart
broken member of the Rally Commit
tee.
