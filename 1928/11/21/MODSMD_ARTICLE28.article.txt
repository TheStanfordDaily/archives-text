# CONFESSION

WE lit the bonfire. It seemed so
pitiful and stark standing out there
alone in a wide field. The deed was
accomplished with matches â€” just
plain matches. We made trip after
trip, all through the night, planting a
little flare each time. Once we were
accosted by a fellow who loomed.
"Hurrah for the Sons of the Stanford
Rfd, the class of 1932, and the It-l-y
C-m-tt-e!" we shouted. "Pass, friend,"
he murmured. It was morning before
it "got going good." It wasn't so cold
then and we kind of regretted it. Hut
the deed is done. We did it for school

spirit and in the hope that the Assem
bly Hall would be torn down to build
a new tire "On tlie ashes of the old."

ITEM: The Stanford student body
numbers 3000.
To the workers: This is a blanket
apology for some of the boys who
just couldn't get down to help rebuild.
They are sorry but they had to study
for some midquarters next week and
besides touch football is such a fasci
nating game.
