all students connected with cam

in the bonfire if it would inter
fere with their activities.
"The Rally Committee does
not wish to disorganize other
campus activities in rebuilding
the structure," he said. "We wel
come all aid, but not at the ex
pense of the other preparations
to celebrate the Big Game.
