# ENCINA UNDERGOES RAID Redskins Come in Hordes ONLY HOPE IN COMMONS
## 
### 
Encina Hall is undergoing a raid
such as it never endured at the hands
of hostile members of the class of '31.
O'l every side literally millions of the
invaders are entering, and, unlike
sophomores, they show no partiality
lor frosh, they respect no persons.
The rooms and property of corded
senior sponsors are just as likely to
suffer depredations as those of the
common rabble.
Methods of repulse such as the
time-honored expedient of the fire
hose seem so hopeless that they have
not even been tried, and individual
efforts of various sorts have met with
only temporary success. At all hours
of the day and night the silent, re
lentless, ruthless hordes continue the
advance. Locked doors and windows
are of no avail; even diabolically con
ceived poisons fail to stop the con- j
querors.
Only one ray of hope remains that j
the hall may be freed from the rule !
of the invaders. In their indiscrimi-!
nate commandeering of Encina, some |
of the enemy have discovered the
Commons and have contracted the j
habit of eating there. It is hoped that â– 
the food received there, if it does not
act as a direct exterminator, will, at
least, disgust the red-skinned hordes j
and turn their attention to Toyon.
But until this occurs, the inhab- j
itants of Encina must admit that they j
have been vanquished by multitudes j
of the species familiarly called by
biologists Formicoidea and by hostile
frosh, "those red ants."
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 20.
trict Attorney Asa Keyes, summoned
to court today to face arraignment on
two new grand jury indictments
charging bribery and conspiracy in
office, was granted a two-day stay for j
entering his plea.
