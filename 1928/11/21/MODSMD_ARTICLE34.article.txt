A torchlight procession bore the Cali

The annual Sequoia Wake, bearing the
remains of the Golden Bear, and follow

the bier at the site of the new bonfire.
The procession stopped first in front of
Roble, then went up the Row and turned
at the A.T.O. House and went past En
cina and Toyon. At the bonfire a special
cast portrayed on an improvised stage
the fate of a Berkeley man, slain by Stan
ford's mighty sons, who tried to enter
heaven. An enthusiastic crowd followed
in automobiles and cheered the cere
