# INFLUENZA CASES IN HOSPITALS AND HALLS TOTAL 53
## No One Seriously III, But Danger From Relapse Is Great—Storey 
### 
Fifty-three students are in bed with
the "flu," according to the most complete
available reports. Twenty-one are in the
isolation hospital, sixteen at the Palo
! Alto hospital, nine at the Hempel house,
' four women at the rest home, and three
I at Roble.
Today a nurse was sent around through
the halls to look for cases which had not
been reported, and found quite a num
ber. They were placed under hospital
care.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Medical Ad
viser of Men, issued the following state
ment :
"Sunday and Monday of this week
brought us another wave in our epidemic
of influenza-like infections. None of the
cases now in any of the hospitals is seri
ous. All the earlier cases that have been
in the hospitals have recovered.
"Arrangements have been made in
Roblc hall for the hospitalization there
of Roble girls. The men's rest house,
established by the Stanford Mothers
Club at 536 Alvarado Row, has been
made available by the club for the hos
pitalization of girls from the Row. The
Isolation hospital has been used for some
time for the accommodation of men.
Tuesday afternoon, thanks to the co-op
j eration of Dr. Langnecker, the Hempel
house, at 741 Santa Lnez, was set up as
a temporary hospital for men students.
So we now have available for overflow
from the Palo Alto hospital, the Alva
rado hospital and the Roble hospital for
men.
"The infections that are causing this
epidemic may be dangerous if they are
neglected too long or if regular activities
are resumed too soon after apparent re
covery. One should consult the Student
Health Service or the physician of his
choice as soon as lie begins to feel badly.
If he has a temperature he should go to
bed and send for his physician.
"The experience of the last few weeks
shows that the greatest number of new
cases report on Saturdays, Sundays, and
Mondays. The exposures at the end of
the week seem to have something to do
with the transmission of the infections or
with the lowering of resistance to them.
"Those of us who have not already had
bad colds (or 'influenza') may perhaps
escapc infection by omitting week-end
parties, keeping away from crowds,
dressing warmly, avoiding exposure to
rain and cold, and by keeping a reason
able distance from people who cough and
sneeze.
"After recover}-, there is usually a peri
od of a few days—or even a few weeks—
in which one may easily suffer a relapse
and is more than ordinarily susceptible
to other infections. This is a period in
which one should be more careful than
ever to get enough undisturbed sleep,
eat only food that he knows he can di
gest, drink plenty of water, take regular
afld effective care of his excretions, avoid
fatigue and exposure, and keep free from
worry. There is more danger after in
fluenza than while you are sick with it."

eat only food that he knows he can di
gest, drink plenty of water, take regular
afld effective care of his excretions, avoid
fatigue and exposure, and keep free from
worry. There is more danger after in
fluenza than while you are sick with it."
Fifty-three students are in bed with
the "flu," according to the most complete
available reports. Twenty-one are in the
isolation hospital, sixteen at the Palo
! Alto hospital, nine at the Hempel house,
' four women at the rest home, and three
I at Roble.
Today a nurse was sent around through
the halls to look for cases which had not
been reported, and found quite a num
ber. They were placed under hospital
care.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Medical Ad
viser of Men, issued the following state
ment :
"Sunday and Monday of this week
brought us another wave in our epidemic
of influenza-like infections. None of the
cases now in any of the hospitals is seri
ous. All the earlier cases that have been
in the hospitals have recovered.
"Arrangements have been made in
Roblc hall for the hospitalization there
of Roble girls. The men's rest house,
established by the Stanford Mothers
Club at 536 Alvarado Row, has been
made available by the club for the hos
pitalization of girls from the Row. The
Isolation hospital has been used for some
time for the accommodation of men.
Tuesday afternoon, thanks to the co-op
j eration of Dr. Langnecker, the Hempel
house, at 741 Santa Lnez, was set up as
a temporary hospital for men students.
So we now have available for overflow
from the Palo Alto hospital, the Alva
rado hospital and the Roble hospital for
men.
"The infections that are causing this
epidemic may be dangerous if they are
neglected too long or if regular activities
are resumed too soon after apparent re
covery. One should consult the Student
Health Service or the physician of his
choice as soon as lie begins to feel badly.
If he has a temperature he should go to
bed and send for his physician.
"The experience of the last few weeks
shows that the greatest number of new
cases report on Saturdays, Sundays, and
Mondays. The exposures at the end of
the week seem to have something to do
with the transmission of the infections or
with the lowering of resistance to them.
"Those of us who have not already had
bad colds (or 'influenza') may perhaps
escapc infection by omitting week-end
parties, keeping away from crowds,
dressing warmly, avoiding exposure to
rain and cold, and by keeping a reason
able distance from people who cough and
sneeze.
"After recover}-, there is usually a peri
od of a few days—or even a few weeks—
in which one may easily suffer a relapse
and is more than ordinarily susceptible
to other infections. This is a period in
which one should be more careful than
ever to get enough undisturbed sleep,
eat only food that he knows he can di
gest, drink plenty of water, take regular
afld effective care of his excretions, avoid
fatigue and exposure, and keep free from
worry. There is more danger after in
