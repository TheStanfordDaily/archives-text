# STARR COMPARES ORIENTAL RACES IN FEATURE TALK
## 
### 
"Although commonly confused in
the public mind, Koreans and Japa
nese are decidedly different," said Dr.
Frederick Starr, speaking on "Japan
and Korea" in the Little Theatre last
night. "One can always tell a Korean
by his large stature and long stride,
as compared with the Japanese short
bodies and hurried walk."
"The Korean is conservatism per
sonified, and he dresses the same as
he did under the Ming dynasty, 500
years ago. Custom and tradition rules
the land. All married men wear a dis
tinctive top-knot. And all Koreans
have seventeen brass dishes of food
; served in the winter, and thirteen in
the summer."
Dr. Starr surprised his audience by
declaring that a great deal of valuable
culture which we think of as coming
I from Japan really comes from Korea.
| Buddhism, writing, silk-culture, and
| the manufacture of line porcelains
J and pottery are developments for
which Korea is to be given credit.
Korean history was divided by Dr.
Starr into six points of importance,
starting in 522 A.D.: the Period of
Introduction, the Period of Invasion
From Japan (1592), the Opening
Period, the War With Japan (1894),
the Kusso-Japanese War, and the Ab
should lose out to Japan."
"Japan has been criticized for this
j last move, but for 2000 years Korea
I has been a hotbed of trouble, and
has killed every man capable of lead
ing her; so it was natural that Korea
should lose out to Japan.
A series of slides closed the lecture,
one of which showed moveable type
used by the Orientals 200 years be
| fore the Guttenburg Bible was printed.
