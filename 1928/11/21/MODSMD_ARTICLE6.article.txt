At this hour in view of tho uncer
tainty surrounding the origin of the
burning of the bonfire and consider
ing the statement made yesterday by
Chester Zinn, president of the Asso
t iated Students at U.C., let the mem
l)».»rs of the student body keep in mind
the existing intercollegiate agreement
•with the University of California.
Following is the agreement which
is incorporated in the A.S.S.U. by
laws: "As a result of the existing
intercollegiate agreement between
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia, any disturbance, on the Uni
\»rsity of California campus by Stan
ford students, is prohibited and may
b» punished by expulsion from the

Council for Student Control may de
cide."
The statement published in yester
day's Special Edition of the Daily by
Chester Zinn was: "I was very sorry
to learn this morning that unknown
persons had destroyed the Stanford
bonfire. The intense, though friendly
spirit of rivalry noticeable on the
California campus during the last
week convinces me that the act was
NOT performed by anyone connected
with the University of California. It
is an act becoming boys of high school
age. Let me reassure you of the
friendly spirit for our Stanford ath
letic rivals which prevails on this
campus."
Any indiscreet act by Stanford stu
dents at this time is absolutely un
warranted and might result in the
