HOW'S YOUR
Big Game Wardrobe?
Plenty of excitement now! New Bonfire
—Big Game Rally—hustle, bustle, and
hurry!
But don't overlook your wardrobe for
the game and after—check it over.
You'll probably need a few accessories.
Maybe collars, studs, cuff links, shirts
for your tux? Maybe dress shoes for the
dance? Maybe some afternoon gear for
the game itself?
Whatever it is we have it—and it's right
both in style and tariff!
