# HUNGRY FLAMES LAP UP PYRE AS STUDENTS CHEER
## Cardinal Has Even Chance in Saturday's Game Declares Warner at Bonfire Rally Captain Biff Hoffman Voices Stanford's Fighting Spirit; Alonzo Taylor Gives Talk 
### 
The Golden Bear is dead. Hungry
flames shooting high into the sky from
the sixty-foot bonfire last night read
ily consumed the coffin containing the
battered remains of the Berkeley
bruin. Philip Cavalero, president of
the A.S.S.U., touched off the fire at
8:25 o'clock. Within two minutes the
flames had climbed to the top of the
structure. The Stanford band led the
cheering students in a serpentine
around the blaze.
"Stanford has an even chance, and
no more than that, to win Saturday's
game with California," declared
"Pop" Warner addressing the 4000
students and spectators who jammed
into the Pavilion for the Big Game
rally which took place just preceding
the burning of the bonfire. "We have
had excellent material this year, and
the men have worked hard. If we
lose Saturday, it will be because I
have failed in my job to best develop
that material," concluded "Pop"
sadly.
Captain "Biff" Hoffman, the next
speaker, disagreed with Warner about
his closing statement. "The team is
determined to win," said Hoffman,
"and it looks bad for Cal. We have
everything to fight for," he added,
"the best coach in the country, the
best system in the country, and the
best school in the country."
"Stanford can rightfully claim the
next two Big Games as her own," de
clared Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, who de
livered the pep talk. "Before Warner
came West, California won five games
in succession from Stanford. Stan
ford has been victorious in the last
three Big Games, and thus has two
more coming to her." Taylor read a
telegram from President Wilbur, who
is absent from the University, extend
ing his best wishes to the team. A
short skit was presented which was
indifferently received by the audience.

students down Lasuen preceding the
rally.
Scott Webster, head yell leader,
served as Master of Ceremonies. He
was assisted by Paul Speegle and
