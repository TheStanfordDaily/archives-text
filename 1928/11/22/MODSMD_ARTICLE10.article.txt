# Famous Tenor Will Sing Tonight In Assembly Hall, Largo Opens Program
## 
### 
"Salut demeure" from Faust, one
of the operas in which Louis Gra
veure made his debut as a tenor in
Berlin, will be sung by this noted
artist in his concert in the Assembly
Hall at 8:15 o'clock tonight. Profes
sor Einstein, well-known German
musical critic, in reviewing this opera,
said: "One takes no risk in asserting
that since Caruso no tenor has been
here with a voice of such nobility,
roundness, concentration, and qual
ity."
Graveure, since his concert under
the A.S.S.U. series in 1926, has aban
doned his well-established position as
a baritone to become a tenor, causing
one of the most remarkable pheno
mena of the musical world in recent
years. He decided on the change after
accidntally discovering his tenor pos
sibilities while coaching a friend.

| Graveure will begin his program to
night with Haendel's Largo from
Xerxes. He will sing four arias, the
one from Faust, mentioned, one from
i Donizetti's "L'Elisir D'Amore," an
other from "Manon" by Massenet, and
will conclude with an aria from
Verdi's "Rigoletto." Included in his
program will be three folk-songs,
Hungarian, Welsh, and Irish. Other
compositions he will sing are Dvorak's
"Songs My Mother Taught Me,"
Chausson's "Apaisement," and Pur
cell's "Passing By."
The famous beard which has been
: Graveure's trade-mark, has been dis-
I pensed with because of the exigicen
-1 cies of makeup on the operatic stage,
j With this change and in the new role
of tenor, Graveure will probably seem
entirely a different artist from the
one who sang baritone here two years
I ago.
