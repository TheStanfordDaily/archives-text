SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 21. (/p)â€”
"Big Game" ticket speculators who
sell tickets for the California-Stan
' ford football game at more than the
regular price of $5 must divide their
profits with the United States govern
ment.
Collector of Internal Revenue John
P. McLaughlin today announced that
deputies from his office will be sta
tioned at the different entrances to
the stadium gates in Berkeley Satur
day to watch for instances of "scalp
ing."
The government has the names of
all regular ticket scalpers and checks
up on their earnings so that the re
quired tax may be forthcoming, he
revealed.
Amateur speculators, however, have
to be caught in the act before the
government can collect, he admitted.
