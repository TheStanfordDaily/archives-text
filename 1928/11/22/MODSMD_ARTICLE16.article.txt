LONDON, Nov. 21. (>P) â€”The Gov
ernment tonight carried its cable mer
ger plan by which the Pacific, West
Indian, and other cables under con
trol of the Government would be sold
to a new company called "The Com
munications Company."
The Imperial Telegraphs Bill was
given its second reading after a mo
tion by Ramsey Mac Donald, Labor
leader had been defeated in the
House of Commons by a vote of 258
ic 134, and the bill had been referred
to the committee of the whole house
for detailed discussion. The debate
lasted throughout the evening, charac
terized by heated Labor attacks on
the Government for a policy which
(hey termed abuse of trust.
Labor Party members denounced
the government for "playing into the
hands of private interests." Mac Do
nald accused the Government of throw
ing away the key to the whole situa
tion by allowing the Beam System to
leave its possession. Early in the de
bate Captain William Wedgwood
Benn moved adjournment on the de
bate on the ground that terms of the
transfer had not been disclosed. The
motion was rejected 219 to 113.
