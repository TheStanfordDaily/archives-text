# CARDINALS LEAVE CAMPUS FOR SECLUSION UNTIL GAME TIME
## Heinecke, Sellman Expected To Be Ready For Action In Big Game; Mush Mailer Is Added To Temporay Sick List After Practice Session 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
T'HIRTY-SEVEN players from the varsity football squad, together with
Coaches Warner, Thornhill, and Winterburn, left the campus immediately
after the bonfire rally last night for Mt. Diablo Country Club where they
will remain in seclusion until the morning of the Big Game Saturday.
The team will practice there today and tomorrow. There is a slight pos
sibility, however, that some of the players, probably the starting team,
will go over to the Berkeley Stadium early tomorrow afternoon for a short

>workout in order that they may get
acquainted with the bowl and the
playing field.
Stock Rises
Stanford stock took a rise last night
from its slump when it was learned
that Walt Heinecke and Tiny Sell
man will be able to play Saturday,
providing their present rate of im
provement from illness continues. But
with this welcome news comes the
report that Mush Muller, the demon
pass-receiver, is suffering with an in
! ternal disorder. It stands to reason
1 that even though all three of these
men are able to play in the game they
will have to go some to overcome the
handicap of weakness which their ill
ness leaves.
Sellman was back at practice yes
terday after an absence of two prac
tice sessions. Heinecke is in the Palo
Alto Hospital where he will remain
until tomorrow night. He will not
have an opportunity to work out be
fore game time.
No Scrimmage
There was no scrimmage here yes
terday as there was on Monday and
Tuesday afternoons when Warner
drilled the first team on defensive
work, particularly on defense against
California pass plays. Yesterday's
practice consisted chiefly of running
signals on the plays which the Cards
will use against Price's Bears.
Pop plans to take thirty men back
with him to New York for the con
test with the West Point Cadets on
the following Saturday. The team will
leave late Saturday night. The list of
those making the trip will not be an
nounced until after the Big Game as
it will depend upon which, if any, of
the players are injured in that fray.
