## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 21. (;P)â€”
After taking additional testimony
charging improper administration of
Indian affairs in California by the
Federal Indian Bureau, the Senatorial
investigating committee left here to
day to iustittue inquiries at River
side.
Beginning tomorrow, the commit
tee will hold meetings during the
rest of the week at that city to hear
the testimony of witnesses regarding
the conditions existing on the south
ern California Indian reservations.
Today's hearing was concluded with
the testimony of Will C. Wood, State
Superintendent of Banks and former
Superintendent of Public Instruction.
Wood declared that "if any school,
under the jurisdiction of the State,
private or otherwise, were of such
low standard as the Indian schools, it
would be immediately closed."
The State, he said, is now power
less in the matter, but if the Swing-
Johnson Bill, now pending in Con
gress, is passed, then the State can
step in and do "great things" for the
education of Indian children in Cali
fornia.
