# By Way of Vindication

### 
Just at the moment when the bonfire was going up rapidly, Leon Levi,
a spokesman of the Rally Committee, rose at the assembly yesterday and
lashed the poor Daily for having placed the blame for the premature burn
ing of the first bonfire upon the Rally and Bonfire Committees, lie was
irked because the Daily took credit for giving out a serious warning that
there was a strong likelihood of premature ignition and because it pointed
out that the freshmen could not be expected to take the thing seriously
"when members of the Rally Committee scolTed at it."
Now the nigger in this woodpile is the fact that the Rally Committee
incited the Daily to write the editorial in question. (It was entitled
"Breathes There a Man With Soul So Dead?" and appeared Monday
morning). So of course the Rally Committee (according to its spokesman
at least) is incensed when the Daily says that it scoffed at the warning.
The Daily owes and herewith freely gives an apology to the Rally Com
mittee for insinuating that it did not believe every word of the warning
in all its seriousness.
Furthermore we were probably unfair yesterday when we said that the
Rally Committee "evidently fell down on their job." The words were
written at a time when it was thought thai .io one had been on guard at
the moment the pyre was set off. As this has since proved untrue the
Rally Committee is absolved of blame. The Rally Committee takes a lot of
blame it doesn't deserve; for it works hard, long and late to organize
rah-rah spirit during the football season. Everyone ought to give it a
silent cheer, and indeed we doubt if there are many who have not admired
the industrious way the red-caps have led in the work of rebuilding the
IxDnfire.
And now. Mr. Levi, we hope that we are at least a "mitigated" liar.
