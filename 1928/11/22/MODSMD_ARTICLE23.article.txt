# Graduate Schools Are Athletically Weak
## 
### 
How baneful the "graduate school idea" is to university athletics is
brought out in a sharp editorial appearing in the Daily Northwestern, tra
ditional foe of the University of Chicago, against which the Northwestern
holds forth. "Chicago is a great educational institution but it can no
longer compete with its former equals of the Big Ten," charges the
Northwestern, urging that the Conference cut out "this dead timber." It
declares:
This athletic downfall of Chicago, once the idol of the Middle
west, is not caused by the students of the University. The under
graduates have gone down fighting a system that is stifling all ath
letics at that university. The handful of men who daily work out on
Stagg field are the remnants of what was once the strong and virile
manhood of the University.
Chicago has fallen before the graduate school idea. Undergradu
ates are barely considered by the faculty and the graduate schools in
crease steadily. Chicago is a great educational institution but it can
no longer compete with its former equals of the Big Ten. To expect
Chicago to have a winning football team is as absurd as planning
teams to represent the Sorbonne, the International Correspondence
Schools, or the Electoral College. The days of athletics are over at
the University of Chicago.
What has happened at the University of Chicago appears to be just a
repetition of J larvard's experience. The Crimson athletic teams have sunk
so low that they are the objects of national humor, yet the report is that no
one at Cambridge seems to care very much. There are many undergradu
ates, we learn from a recent writer on the subject, who do not "give a
damn" about the fortunes of the football team, win lose or draw. So
determined is Harvard to maintain a fine intellectual indifference to chalk
yard-lines, moleskins, and pigskins that the Crimson, its newspaper, plans
to come out on days of big games with heavy intellectual supplements—
book reviews, theater reviews, essays, etc.
In the face of these circumstances, it looks as if Stanford were headed
in the same direction, with the abolition of the Lower Division contem
plated. And when that cataclysmic day arrives, the B. of A.C. will have
to tighten its belt and look forward to some "recciptless" Saturdays.

crease steadily. Chicago is a great educational institution but it can
no longer compete with its former equals of the Big Ten. To expect
Chicago to have a winning football team is as absurd as planning
teams to represent the Sorbonne, the International Correspondence
Schools, or the Electoral College. The days of athletics are over at
the University of Chicago.
What has happened at the University of Chicago appears to be just a
repetition of J larvard's experience. The Crimson athletic teams have sunk
so low that they are the objects of national humor, yet the report is that no
one at Cambridge seems to care very much. There are many undergradu
ates, we learn from a recent writer on the subject, who do not "give a
damn" about the fortunes of the football team, win lose or draw. So
determined is Harvard to maintain a fine intellectual indifference to chalk
yard-lines, moleskins, and pigskins that the Crimson, its newspaper, plans
to come out on days of big games with heavy intellectual supplements—
book reviews, theater reviews, essays, etc.
In the face of these circumstances, it looks as if Stanford were headed
in the same direction, with the abolition of the Lower Division contem
plated. And when that cataclysmic day arrives, the B. of A.C. will have
to tighten its belt and look forward to some "recciptless" Saturdays.
