# Chappie Is a Credit to Stanford
## 
### 
We have a contemporary upstairs in the Press Building which we are
proud to hail today, it is Chaparral (you've all seen stories about it in
the Datly), and is appearing this morning in what is known as the Big
Game Number.
Chappie has seemed to us always a noble example in the field of college
comicalness. It is different from the generality of collegiate magazines,
most of which are as alike as two peas or garbage-cans. It reflects Stan
ford more accurately than other comics reflect their colleges. It is not
too proud to be provincial, but it is careful about the sort of jokes it uses.
There are some fancy features in the Big Game Number today, among
them a cover by Feg Murray; a frontispiece dedicated to Hoover, "Stan
ford's All-American"; a page of caricatures of the team, done by Berk
Anthony; "The Big Game As Variety Would Have It," by Joe Thompson ;
and Scotchograms, by Tom Irwin and Berk Anthony.
