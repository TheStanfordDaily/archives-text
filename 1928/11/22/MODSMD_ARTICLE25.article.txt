The Red Branch. By Charles McMor
ris Purdy. (New York: Robert M. |
Mcßride and Company. 1928. $2.)
Here we have the story of John, \
who was born into a conservative j
heritage of money, class, and a brick i
factory presidency. With his own
mother dead, he finds in Roma and
Tad a mother and brother who help
him fight his way clear of Peruvia and
what it means to him.
When he reaches young manhood
he runs away from a pre-arranged
betrothal to Violet and goes, as young
men often do (at least in novels), to
Paris. There, of course, he meets a
cafe girl, Arlette, falls in love with
her and brings her back to Peruvia
as his wife.
Even though she never loves John,
she tries her best to play the game
fairly; but suceceds at nothing except
winning the sympathy of the reader.
She dies in childbirth, admitting her
son to be another man's. In the mean
time, John has succumbed to the
deadening influence of the brick fac
tory and acknowledges the boy as his
own to the world. A wee bit too mag
nanimously, the book closes here on
this phase of John's adventures.
Purdy has written this book sin
cerely. Particularly nice is the at
mosphere in the first part of the book
dealing with John Panham's child
hood, and the part telling of his ex
periences in Paris is handled with
restraint that is unsual in so young
an author. The tramp lover of Arlette,
Buck, is an extra good characteriza
tion, even though he occupies but lit
tle space.
John Panham himself is both na
tural and lovable. Only Arlette fails
to register as true. It is utterly im
possible to believe that a cafe girl
could fit so impeccably into the Peru
vian life and society to which John
took her.

Against the Sun. By Godfrey Elton.
(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Com
pany. 1928. $2.50.)

Mr. Elton shows an unnecessarily
heavy preoccupation with the philo
sophical implications back of such
things as small dogs, stars and roses,
and young lovers. Men reach after in
nei meanings, come to think that
they have found the truth can make
tliem free. In spite of the mystic,
however, the author is able to save
the central characters from becom
ing either bloodless abstractions or
harmless lunatics.
We are chiefly concerned with
young Anthony Rivers, a rising M.P.,
who is now and again touched by
doubts as to the final significance of
that game of pleasant party politics
played, "as she are," by the English
gentlemen.
And then, there is Anne, the wife
of Anthony, who wins immediately
from the reader a compassionate ten
derness that Tonly did not get until
he had been married to her for five
years. She is always disagreeable
about little things, her spelling is of
ten not of the best, and she repeats
in slightly altered form the old plaint
that her husband doesn't understand
her.
But with all these faults, we can
not deny her charm. We would, in
fact, have enjoyed more of Anne and
less of the discovery of truth. We
think we could have understood her
better than her husband did.
Another charming characterization
is Mrs. Hamp, the housekeeper. Why
are these interesting fiction servants
so prevalent in English novels? Is
it the soil or the climate that pro
duces them? Is it a severe drawback
to American writers that they do not
have their fancy stimulated by these
odd, elderly female retainers?
