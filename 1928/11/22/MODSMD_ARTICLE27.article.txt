The Editor, Sir:
With the Stanford Daily editors
publicly being called liars, with fresh
men playing the parts of dupes, with
the charge of indifference being
hurled at the student body, all will
agree that a grand and glorious mess
exists. If a spectator may add his
voice to the babble, opportunity to re
port certain common observations
about football policies will be appre
ciated.
The charge of "indifference" toward
football brings a laugh; it is the blam
ing of an effect and not a cause. Pep
is not to be generated by keeping
people away from games but by
crowding the stands. The athletic
management policy at Stanford is not
to serve the student body but it is
rather to have it serve the dollar,
since the unreasonable prices and the
taking of certain "home games" to
San Francisco. In making the glib
charge of indifference, the funda
mental and not superficial causes for
empty seats should be examined.
Another practice to be examined is
the bonfire tradition. In a day when
fire-building is an ordinary high
school stunt and when colleges are
abandoning this form of intellectual
ingenuity, why should Stanford up
hold the tradition? Whether certain
journalists are "liars" or not, the fact
remains that the freshmen are put in
the position of dupes. It is they who
must tote, beg, and steal the wood
when the "bigger than ever" piles of
fuel must be rebuilt. This year, per
haps 25,000 man-hours of time will
have been spent in getting ready for
the one- or two-hour blaze for which
the lumber pile is designed.
The procedure is not complimen
tary to the intelligence of the fresh
men or of the school. Between the
consuming of time and materials in
volved, sympathy for the project is
driven away, rather than induced. The
representatives of many homes in the
vicinity frequently remark tfiat one
tenth of one-tenth of one per cent of
the fuel used this year would meet
the sore need for winter fuel used
this year would meet the sore need
for winter fuel in many a home. Pub
lic sentiment regarding economic
waste can be respected or disre
garded, but no mistake is made by
considering it.
The present embroilment at Stan
ford is a disagreeable thing, but if it
leads to a searching examination of
existing policies and traditions, cer

tain vicious circles in cause and ef- | <
feet may be discovered and broken.
Cat and dog fights between Stanford
men are an unfortunate spectacle,
especially when all sides are sincere
in motive. Why not get together and
find a way out from dubious practices
which cause embroilments?

The Editor, Sir:
I would like to add a few remarks
to the already much-discussed food
situation at Encina. Strangely enough
they do not concern the quality of
the food, there has been enough said
on that score already. To be exact,
I would like to lodge my complaint
against the method of access to the
meals.
At the beginning of the quarter, my
roommate and myself were assigned
to one of the smaller dining halls
where we ate with some degree of
regularity until recently. About a
week ago we were told to take cer- :
tain seats which we would keep for
the rest of the quarter. The next day
we were told that this particular table
would not be used any more for the
rest of the quarter, and were shooed
oIT to another hall.
This has been going on ever since,
and we have become quite adept at i
the art of spying out vacant seats
where we might sneak in and grab
a bite to eat, much to the annoyance ;
of the irate and lordly waiter.
We realize that there is an adjust
ment going on, in an attempt to run 1
the dining halls with a minimum of j
overhead expense, but there is no ex
cuse for this not being done in a sys
tematic manner and with some dis
patch, also some consideration for the
insignificant pawns in this game of
incivility.
It might be said that we should (
assume an aggressive attitude and
demand our rights. Perhaps so, but
there doesn't seem to be any ten
dency on the part of the authorities
to make allowances for those whose
home training has not engendered an
adeptuess in the art of fighting for
his food. Sincerely, Jack Doyle.

haps 25,000 man-hours of time will
have been spent in getting ready for
the one- or two-hour blaze for which
the lumber pile is designed.
The procedure is not complimen
tary to the intelligence of the fresh
men or of the school. Between the
consuming of time and materials in
volved, sympathy for the project is
driven away, rather than induced. The
representatives of many homes in the
vicinity frequently remark tfiat one
tenth of one-tenth of one per cent of
the fuel used this year would meet
the sore need for winter fuel used

lic sentiment regarding economic

The present embroilment at Stan
ford is a disagreeable thing, but if it

Cat and dog fights between Stanford
men are an unfortunate spectacle,
especially when all sides are sincere
in motive. Why not get together and
find a way out from dubious practices
which cause embroilments?

The Editor, Sir:
I would like to add a few remarks
to the already much-discussed food
situation at Encina. Strangely enough
they do not concern the quality of
the food, there has been enough said
on that score already. To be exact,
I would like to lodge my complaint
against the method of access to the
meals.
At the beginning of the quarter, my
roommate and myself were assigned
to one of the smaller dining halls
where we ate with some degree of
regularity until recently. About a
week ago we were told to take cer- :
tain seats which we would keep for
the rest of the quarter. The next day
we were told that this particular table
would not be used any more for the
rest of the quarter, and were shooed
oIT to another hall.
This has been going on ever since,
and we have become quite adept at i
the art of spying out vacant seats
where we might sneak in and grab
a bite to eat, much to the annoyance ;
of the irate and lordly waiter.
We realize that there is an adjust
ment going on, in an attempt to run 1
the dining halls with a minimum of j
overhead expense, but there is no ex
cuse for this not being done in a sys
tematic manner and with some dis
patch, also some consideration for the
insignificant pawns in this game of
incivility.
It might be said that we should (
assume an aggressive attitude and
demand our rights. Perhaps so, but
there doesn't seem to be any ten
dency on the part of the authorities
to make allowances for those whose
home training has not engendered an
adeptuess in the art of fighting for
his food. Sincerely, Jack Doyle.
The Editor, Sir:
With the Stanford Daily editors
publicly being called liars, with fresh
men playing the parts of dupes, with
the charge of indifference being
hurled at the student body, all will
agree that a grand and glorious mess
exists. If a spectator may add his
voice to the babble, opportunity to re
port certain common observations
about football policies will be appre
ciated.
The charge of "indifference" toward
football brings a laugh; it is the blam
ing of an effect and not a cause. Pep
is not to be generated by keeping
people away from games but by
crowding the stands. The athletic
management policy at Stanford is not
to serve the student body but it is
rather to have it serve the dollar,
since the unreasonable prices and the
taking of certain "home games" to
San Francisco. In making the glib
charge of indifference, the funda
mental and not superficial causes for
empty seats should be examined.
Another practice to be examined is
the bonfire tradition. In a day when
fire-building is an ordinary high
school stunt and when colleges are
abandoning this form of intellectual
ingenuity, why should Stanford up
hold the tradition? Whether certain
journalists are "liars" or not, the fact
remains that the freshmen are put in
the position of dupes. It is they who
must tote, beg, and steal the wood
when the "bigger than ever" piles of
fuel must be rebuilt. This year, per
haps 25,000 man-hours of time will
have been spent in getting ready for
the one- or two-hour blaze for which

on that score already. To be exact,
I would like to lodge my complaint
against the method of access to the
meals.
At the beginning of the quarter, my
roommate and myself were assigned
to one of the smaller dining halls
where we ate with some degree of
regularity until recently. About a
week ago we were told to take cer- :
tain seats which we would keep for
the rest of the quarter. The next day
we were told that this particular table
would not be used any more for the
rest of the quarter, and were shooed
oIT to another hall.
This has been going on ever since,
and we have become quite adept at i
the art of spying out vacant seats
where we might sneak in and grab
a bite to eat, much to the annoyance ;
of the irate and lordly waiter.
We realize that there is an adjust
ment going on, in an attempt to run 1
the dining halls with a minimum of j
overhead expense, but there is no ex
cuse for this not being done in a sys
tematic manner and with some dis
patch, also some consideration for the
insignificant pawns in this game of
incivility.
It might be said that we should (
assume an aggressive attitude and
demand our rights. Perhaps so, but
there doesn't seem to be any ten
dency on the part of the authorities
to make allowances for those whose
home training has not engendered an
adeptuess in the art of fighting for
his food. Sincerely, Jack Doyle.
The Editor, Sir:
With the Stanford Daily editors
publicly being called liars, with fresh
men playing the parts of dupes, with
the charge of indifference being
hurled at the student body, all will
agree that a grand and glorious mess
exists. If a spectator may add his
voice to the babble, opportunity to re
port certain common observations
about football policies will be appre
ciated.
The charge of "indifference" toward
football brings a laugh; it is the blam
ing of an effect and not a cause. Pep
is not to be generated by keeping
people away from games but by
crowding the stands. The athletic
management policy at Stanford is not
to serve the student body but it is
rather to have it serve the dollar,
since the unreasonable prices and the
taking of certain "home games" to
San Francisco. In making the glib
charge of indifference, the funda
mental and not superficial causes for
empty seats should be examined.
Another practice to be examined is
the bonfire tradition. In a day when
fire-building is an ordinary high
school stunt and when colleges are
abandoning this form of intellectual
ingenuity, why should Stanford up
hold the tradition? Whether certain
journalists are "liars" or not, the fact
remains that the freshmen are put in
the position of dupes. It is they who
must tote, beg, and steal the wood
when the "bigger than ever" piles of
fuel must be rebuilt. This year, per
haps 25,000 man-hours of time will
have been spent in getting ready for
the one- or two-hour blaze for which
the lumber pile is designed.
The procedure is not complimen
tary to the intelligence of the fresh
men or of the school. Between the
consuming of time and materials in
volved, sympathy for the project is
driven away, rather than induced. The
representatives of many homes in the
vicinity frequently remark tfiat one
tenth of one-tenth of one per cent of
the fuel used this year would meet
the sore need for winter fuel used
this year would meet the sore need
for winter fuel in many a home. Pub
lic sentiment regarding economic
waste can be respected or disre
garded, but no mistake is made by
considering it.
The present embroilment at Stan
ford is a disagreeable thing, but if it
leads to a searching examination of
existing policies and traditions, cer

tain vicious circles in cause and ef- | <
feet may be discovered and broken.
Cat and dog fights between Stanford
men are an unfortunate spectacle,
especially when all sides are sincere
in motive. Why not get together and
find a way out from dubious practices
which cause embroilments?
