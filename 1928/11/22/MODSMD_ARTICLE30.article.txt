# WORKING DOORS OF VESTRIS KEPT OPEN ON VOYAGES
## Ventilation Served in That Manner, Says Lloyds Insurance Man 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 21. (JP)— An in-
Hurance surveyor for Lloyds of Lon
don, which rated the lost liner Ves
tris under its highest classification,
told the board of inquiry of the De
partment of Commerce today he had
been informed that a working door
near the water line on the starboard
Hide of the vessel usually was kept
open on most of the southern voyages
for ventilation to the crew's head
quarters.
It was through these working or
half doors, some witnesses have tes
tified in the Commerce Department in
quiry and in another before U.S. Com
missioner O'Neil, that water poured
into the liner and created a list to
starboard before it sank off the Vir
ginia Capes a week ago Monday with
the loss of more than 100 lives.
Coal Ports Leaking
James J. Short of New York, wlio
said he obtained his information
about the door from J. Blue, third of
ficer of the Vestris, testified that, un
like the coal ports, which also were
said by some witnesses to have been
leaking, the working door was closed
from within. When he last examined
the vessel the door was fitted proper
ly with gaskets and packing. Other
doors and the lifeboats, he said, were
in proper condition.
Short was one of the final witnesses
of the day in which the board heard
from survivors that some equipment
< f the vessel was defective, and from
officers of one of the rescue vessels
that lifeboats were in seaworthy con
dition.
Captain Schuyler Forbes Cummings
and three of his officers on the steam
er American Shipper, which picked
up five boatloads of Vestris survivors,
said they found the lifeboats in good
condition despite a 20-hour hammer
ing in a stormy sea after me liner
went down. The lifeboats were not
picked up by the rescue steamer be
cause of lack of time, he said.
