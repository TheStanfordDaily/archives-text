NEW YORK, Nov. 21. (/P) —A pic
ture of confusion in striking contrast
to the popular conception of sea disci
pline during emergencies was painted
in a Federal courtroom today by Chief
Officer Frank Johnson of the steamer
Vestris, in telling for the second time
the story of the ship's sinking nine
days ago off the Virginia Capes.
The release mechanism on the life
boats failed to work in every in
stance, he said. Women and children
were put in boats which stood the
poorest chance of being safely

launched, subordinate officers ig
ncred the orders of their superiors,
and the crew failed to go to their
assigned lifeboat stations to help in
saving the passengers.
Although Johnson was on the stand
for a long time when the hearing into
the disaster, which cost more than
100 lives, first opened before United
States Commissioner F. A. O'Neill,
most of the testimony elicited from
him today was not brought out at his
initial questioning.
