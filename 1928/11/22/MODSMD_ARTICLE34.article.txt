# ARMY-NEBRASKA TEAMS MEET IN EAST SATURDAY
## Public Interest in Tussle Wanes Following Last Week's Reverses 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 21. (>T>)â€”Nebras- '
lea's tussle with the Army will be the
j only intersectional football in the
j East Saturday.
The game is not drawing the same
: public interest it might have but for
; two unforseen incidents during the
last two weeks or so. Army apparent
ly was a certainty to enter the battle
with the Cornliuskers undefeated but,
Notre Dame spoiled all that on No
vember 10. Last Saturday., Nebraska,
unbeaten and untied, was held to a
scoreless draw by Pittsburgh.
Army and Nebraska, however, will
draw plenty of attention even on a j
card that includes such big-time com-!
|
bats as those between Yale and Har
vard at New Haven; New York Uni
versity and Carnegie Tech at Pitts
burgh; Princeton and Navy at Phila
delphia; and Georgetown and Ford
j ham at the Polo Grounds, New York.
A Yale-Harvard battle draws its
1 70,000 spectators, rain or shine, un
| successful season or otherwise. Noth
i ing short of an earthquake can affect
| that attendance. Although Johnny
Garvey and Ed Decker are expected
to play a part of the game against j
Harvard, Yale seems destined to !
enter the fray the underdog.
Bill Roper is experiencing plenty
of trouble in convincing his Prince
ton Tigers that the season didn't end
with the Yale game. There's a strong
Navy team to be met at Philadelphia
Saturday, Bill is telling his men, and
the Tigers will have to approximate
the form they showed against Old Eli
to keep their season's record clear of
defeat.
Chick Meehan, fearing that in
sheer power Carnegie Tech will be
more than a match for his New York
University eleven, indicates he will

depend more upon speed than any
thing else to snap the Pittsburgh En
gineers' winning streak. He plans to
put the five-foot three-inch, 120-pound
Dudley Hormel into the Violets" back
fluid in place of Follet. Hormel can
run like a streak but it's a question
whether he can stand up for long un
der the battering he is certain to re
ceive at Pittsburgh.
Fordham is given only an outside
chance of beating Georgetown and
only a Maroon alumnus will go that
far.
