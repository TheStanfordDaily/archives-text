## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 21 (JP).â€”Word
that Charley Boren, valuable cog of the
University of Southern California foot
ball team at running guard, might be able
to play against Notre Dame here Dec. 1,
brought great cheer to the Trojan campus
today.
Boren, who re-injured bis left knee
during the game with Washington State
here last week, would be greatly missed
from the squad, being a bulwark of the
Trojan defense. The team physician ex
amined Boren's knee today, and declared
that the injury was not as bad as it has
been painted.
Meanwhile Coach Howard Jones con
tinued to work his squad in formations
to be used in the Trojans final conference
game of the season, that with Idaho Sat
urday.

Jones is awaiting the arrival of Aubrey
Devine, assistant coach, who has been
scouting Notre Dame in its recent games,
before concentrating on preparing a de
fense for Knute Rockne's invasion. De
vine, due home tomorrow with reams of
stuff about Notre Dame's ups and downs,
scouted Rockne's team in the games with
Penn State, Army and Carnegie Tech.
