# MACHINERY IS DANCE THEME OF '28 REVUE
## No Paid Dress Rehearsal Is Announcement Made by Dramatic Council 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
There will be no paid dress re
hearsal of the Big Game Gaieties
this afternoon, as was previously
announced by the Dramatic Coun
cil. There are still a few tickets
for the Friday performance at
the Union and at Crandall's in
Palo Alto.

The most strikingly ingenious fea
ture of this year's Football Show is
the act which has been known as the
"surprise" ballet. This is called
"Creation —a Ballet of Machinery." It
is an interpretation of the original
composition of modern music written
by Jack Meakin.
"All ordinary dancing is imitative
of something else or a re-arrangement
of an old theme," said Harold llelven
ston who has created the movements
of the ballet. "Dancing, in its ideal
state, is an irradication of human
personality in terms of geometric
movement. In our dance we have ad
hered to the laws of geometry as
rigidly as the laws of mathematics
are observed in music. The ballet
represents abstract machinery."
This ballet is one of several which
have been produced in the last year
with the theme of machinery. It will
be different from the Parisian Ballet
Mechanique and also different from
the Machinery Ballet of Earl Carroll's
1928 Vanities in New York. Stanford's
ballet is built around Mechane, the
name given to the central creation,
and Mechane is interpreted by Jean
nette Owens.
The ballet is divided into several
parts. First comes the awakening of
the machine, the slow gradual assump
tion of power, and then the complete
ly awakened machine whose power is
stronger than itself. The costumes for
this act are entirely original and de
signed not only for hte mechanical
line and color but for the ease and
facility of movement for the dancer.
Primary colors of light are being
used in combination to produce a
purely abstract effect. The stage is
kept extremely simple, and there is
no realistic setting for the back
ground of the machinery creation.
