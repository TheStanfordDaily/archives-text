## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 21. (/P)—Chair
man T. V. O'Connor of the Shipping
Board, declared here tonight that
though the present outlook for a Mer
chant Marine is more encouraging
than it has been for many years it is
"now the turn of the American ship
pers to demonstrate whether or not
they really want an American Mer
chant Marine."
Speaking before the Foreign Com
merce Club, Chairman O'Connor said
that it is within the power of the
American shippers "either to make
or ruin" the whole project of a large
American Merchant Marine." He was
confident, he added, that the "decision
will, of course, be expressed in terms
of cargo placed in the holds of Ameri
can ships."
