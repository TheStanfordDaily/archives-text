# Good Will Assembly Features Templeton, Hoffman, U.C. Head
## 
### 
"There is just one difference be
tween what the California team did
in Amsterdam and what the Califor
nia team has to do Saturday," said
Dink Templeton in his "fight talk"
at the assembly held at the bonfire
yesterday morning. "It is that it won't
lick the Stanford varsity—not by a
hell of a way.
"This is one of the two times of
the year that I haven't any good-will
for California," said Dink. Then he
went on to tell of times when he did
feel friendly toward U.C., and related
the experiences of the crew at the
Olympics. He pointed out that Cali
fornia is using the crew team as an
example for the Bear varsity Satur
day.
Chester Zinn, president of the U.C.
student body, offered hospitality to all
Stanford the day of the Big Game, and
said: "I certainly have a message to
bring to you from California, and I
certainly hope I haven't dropped the
ball," alluding to one of Andy Smith's
stories.
Captain Biff Hoffman spoke con
cerning the much-talked-about. Stan
ford spirit. "It's up to the student
body to snap out of it; it has already
snapped out of it as shown by that
bonfire over there. Let us hope that
that fire has started the old Stanford
spirit again," he said. "Let us not
think of the Stanford rooting section
and the team as two separate units.
! Let us be fighting together."
"Rabbit" Bradshaw, new assistant
! basketball coach, challenged the stu
! dent body for its spirit, when he said:
i "You have a good football team. The
i only reason that you haven't had a
i great football team is because of the
j attitude of the campus toward the
j team. California lias more than an
| even chance to beat Stanford because
] it, is the underdog, and because its
j student body is behind the team. You
' hav about 24 hours to show this team
that you are back of them. You had
'■ better make up for lost time."
The Stanford band and yell leaders
j led some songs and yells, and the as
| sembly was considerably surprised
by an unknown Stanford enthusiast
! who upbraided the lack of spirit, and
aided the yell leaders in producing
I louder yells.
