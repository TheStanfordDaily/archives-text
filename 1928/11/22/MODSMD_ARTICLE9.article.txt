Each member of this trio should see action in Berkeley Saturday and
should cause plenty of grief to the opposing side. Frentrup, with his punting,
passing, and clever ball-carrying, is one of the most valuable backfield men
on Warner's squad. Lom has looked mighty good all year at halfback for the
Bears, and East-Bay sports-writers claim that he is the best halfback on the
Pacific Coast. Schwartz is a fast-charging guard who has been one of the
mainstays of the California line this year.
