Gentlemen:
I have used Edgeworth Smoking
Tobacco for the past twenty-five years.
Two years ago 1 took my trusty briar
along on a trip abroad, intending to
revel in the delights of the famous
mixtures in London. I confess that I
did not carry along with me any of the
little blue tins of Edgeworth. Rut the
joke was on me. I went back to Edge
worth, only this time 1 had to pay 45c
for a 15c tin of Edgeworth!
Incidentally, on a trip through
England and later through Ireland, I
was surprised to find the wide distribu
tion and ready sale of Edgeworth in
Great Rritain. A frequent and famil
iar sign in Dublin, Cork and other
cities in Ireland was a white streamer
announcing a new shipment of Edge
worth. To make such a conquest in
the home of smoking tobacco must be
very gratifying to your house.
Sincerely,
J. B. Kelly
