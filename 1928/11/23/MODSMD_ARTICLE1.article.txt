# RAM'S HEAD SOCIETY OFFERS 'BIG GAME GAIETIES OF 1928' TONIGHT
## Kick-Off Is At 8:15; Coach Davis Confident Team' Will Score Heavily 'Bubbles' Act Features Bill Worthington's Orchestra; Fitz, Speegle Star 
### 
"With the breaks in their favor, the
Football Gaieties Team should play
one of the best games tonight Stan
ford has ever seen," said Coach Gor
don Davis yesterday afternoon as his
team went into final practice.
The opening whistle for the Big
Game Gaieties will come tonight at
8:15 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
The show will begin "Bubbling Over
With Joy," and end up in "The Land
of Jazz." Exceptionally tuneful music,
played with enthusiasm by Billy
Worthington's orchestra, is one of the
highlights of the Gaieties.
Sixteen Numbers Used
Sixteen numbers are included in
ibe two acts. The opening chorus in
troduces Jack Wiggin's song, "Bub
bling Over With Joy," which will be
sung by Helen Ward. Con Conroy,
George Mauser, and Dick Fisher will
help the number to bubble over.
Five skits will be presented in the
Show. The first of these, "Registra
tion Day," by Greg Williamson and
Joe Thompson, gives sideline slants
on current campus problems, while
"The Queen's Washstand" by the
stime authors is a royal burlesque on
kingly ways and activities.
Politics Unearthed
"The Vanishing Orphan" from the
pens of Tom Irwin and Dave Lamson
holds a new angle on Stanford poli
tics, and it is rumored that the Uni
versity's politics have never been pre
sented in quite the same light before.
Five alumni of considerable promi
nence in earlier campus dramatics
will appear in this skit. "A Radio
! Fiasco" by Burnell Gould and Paul
Speegle is crammed with laughs, as is
Winston Norman's "Shave Me Close."
"Creation, a Ballet of Machines,"
will be a startling innovation in Foot
ball Shows because of its unique cre
ative quality. The music, according
to Jack Meakin, who wrote it, was in
spired by the idea of the machine
creation, and the ballet was inspired
by the music, according to Harold
Helvenston, who performed the
choreography.
Days of '99 Recalled
The dear old days of '99 will come
in for their share of frolic in the
"Fin de Siecle Follies." Katherine
Keho and Fenton Barret lead this
number, assisted by Stan Mullin and
Helen Thompson and several ladies
of the chorus.
Jack Meakin's "Blue Man Sam"
will be introduced by Kathleen Fitz
in the Black and White Fantasy. This
number includes some special chorus
work as well as Malmquist and Mar
quis in a tap dance. The Stanford
Glee Club will preseut one number,
while Larry Staley and Payne The
baut give a banjo duet.
The Cardinal Quartette, Military
Maneuvers, a clog dance by Frances
Boone, and a specialty dance for two
by Elizabeth Lynch and Gene Walker,
complete the program until the finale
which will sweep the whole show
into "The Land of Jazz." This is a
new piece by Jack Wiggin which
Helen Ward will sing.
A cast dance will be held in the
Wcmen's Clubhouse immediately fol
lowing the Gaieties.
