COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, Nov. 22.
(PIP) —At Columbia University, which
offers a course on how to make leisure
I profitable in terms of culture, the mem
bers of the men's faculty club have
passed a year and a half out of the last
eight years, playing bridge. Some mis
chievous person found a book containing
the scores, which revealed that at least
25,000 rubbers, at a rate of thirty-five
minutes each, had been played in the
preceding eight years—making a total of
500 days.
