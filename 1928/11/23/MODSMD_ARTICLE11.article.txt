BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 22 (i«P). —
Another name has been added to the roll
of football victims, but this time, Mon
tress Freeman, a student at Birmingham-
Southern College, died from a pistol
wound inflicted by O. H. Westbrook,
student of a rival institution, Howard
College, which came as a climax of in
tense rivalry between the two student
bodies over the annual football game
scheduled for Saturday.
Coroner J. D. Russum, of Jefferson
county, returned a verdict of first degree
manslaughter late today after question
ing several witnesses. Westbrook was
released from the city jail in custody of
city detectives pending posting of $2,500
bond.
H. A. Nelson of Birmingham testified
at the inquest that Westbrook snapped a
revolver once while pointed at the feet
of the 230-pound freshman before send
ing a bullet through Freeman's chest
when the latter advanced toward him
threatening to shave Westbrook's head.
Head shaving has been employed fre
quently in the intense rivalry between
students of the colleges which has come
to be traditional in Birmingham prior to
their annual football game.
Meanwhile authorities of the two in
stitutions and officials of the Birmingham
American Legion went forward with
plans for the twentieth annual game here
Saturday. City officials left with them
the decision whether the game should be
played in the face of numerous requests
from citizens that it be cancelled.
