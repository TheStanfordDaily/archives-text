Introduction by Wilbur
"The presidential campaign of 1928
was as significant as that of 1860," Dr.
! Wilbur says in his introduction. "Not

; since the Lincoln-Douglas debates lias
the country followed the issues of a cam
paign with more intensity. The speeches
of Mr. Hoover were measured statements
of a new liberalism facing new conditions
with courage and with confidence in the
individual human being to act wisely for
J himself and for his neighbors.
"The Stanford University Press asked
i for the privilege of publishing these ad
! dresses of Mr. Hoover so that a perma
| nent and authoritative record would be
! available. Just as his life and deeds have
j been an inspiration to generations of
I Stanford men and women we think that
\ they will stimulate, guide, and hearten
I the people of our great democracy in the
critical and formative years now before
us."
The Stanford University Press is a
j department of the University from which
j Hoover took his degree in 1895. It was
here that the reading copies of the Ad
dress of Acceptance and the West
Branch speech were printed.
