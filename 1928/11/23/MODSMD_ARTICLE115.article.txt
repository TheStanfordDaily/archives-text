## Big Ten Schedule Marked by Upsets; Northwestern Plays Dartmouth 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 22. (/P) —'The upset
cycle of the big ten's football champion
ship race points toward a Minnesota
triumph over Wisconsin Saturday.
For four successive weeks, the cycle
has grown until now it is regarded by
the more superstitious prognosticators as
the "sure dope."
Starting with October 27, the favored
team is the most important game of each
week's schedule has been defeated. On
that date, lowa astounded even its own
supporters by defeating Minnesota, 7 to
b, at lowa City. A week later, Michigan,
which hadn't won a game all season, up
set the Illinois, 1927 champions, 3 to 0.
On November 10, lowa again scored the
upset by routing Ohio State, 14 to 7, and
to complete the latest link in the cycle,
Wisconsin beat lowa last Saturday, 13 to
0, when about one critic out of twenty
believed it possible.
Wisconsin Strong
This week, Wisconsin is the experts'
choice to defeat Minnesota, a powerful
team which was pushed out of the race
by a pair of one-point defeats by lowa
and Northwestern. In this game the up
set cycle has a chance to finish with a
perfect record.
The Northwestern-Dartmouth game at
Evanston promises to be a battle of
passes. Both teams have found the aerial
route their best medium of attack and
have been drilling on that offense this
week. Dartmouth left for Chicago last
night.
Ohio State may start a revised lineup
against Illinois Saturday in an attempt
to counter the Illini style of play.
Illinois' lineup seems to be definitely
decided and the same men who trounced
Chicago last week are expected to start
against the Buckeyes. The Illini held
their last strenuous workout of the sea
son last night and are in splendid physi
cal condition.
With both schools boasting dangerous
elevens, interest in the thirty-first re
newal of the Purdue-Indiana game has l
created greater interest than ever and all
reserved seats have been sold.
