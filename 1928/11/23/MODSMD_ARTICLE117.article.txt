# IDAHO HEARTENED AS S.C. REPORTS PLAYERS INJURED

MOSCOW, Idaho, Nov. 22. (/P)â€”The
Vandals of Idaho today were headed to
ward Los Angeles, heartened by reports
that five Trojan regulars were out of
the game because of injuries. The Ida-
I hoans meet the University of Southern
California at Los Angeles Saturday in
the last conference game for both teams.
Although Charlie Erb's squad was in
its best physical condition of the year and
Bill Kershisnik, his great plunger, was
back in the lineup, the best he could hope
for, he said, would be to hold the score
as low as possible. Although he rated
the Vandals' strength just "one touch
down under that of Washington State
College," he could see nothing in his
lineup that would break the continuous
line of victories for the Trojans this
season.
The following men were en route:
Burgher, captain; O'Brien, Dittman, and i
Price, ends ; Diehl, Thomas and Sumpter,
tackles; Brimhall, Stark, Sproat and
Martin, guards; Kirkpatrick and Carl
son, centers; Robertson and Cheyne,
quarterbacks; Kershisnik, fullback; Hult,
Hutchinson, Perrins, Nordby, Owens,
Halliday and Booker, halfbacks.
The Vandals, who entrained last night,
were expected to reach Los Angeles
Friday.
