# OREGON U. SQUAD WORKS HARD FOR MONTANA FRACAS:
## 
### 
EUGENE, Ore., Nov. 22.
though overjoyed by its 12 to 0 victory
over Oregon State College at Corvallis
last Saturday, the University of Oregon
football team isn't letting up on practice.
A hard game is expected with Montana
here Saturday despite the fact that the
Grizzlies have not won any conference
games this season. Saturday will be Ore
gon's annual homecoming.
Montana has one of the biggest teams
in the whole conference. It never had a
chance this season, Coach McEwan of
Oregon believes, as the Grizzlies played
five hard games on successive Saturdays.
But a team cannot help but profit from
experience, and the Grizzlies have been
improving at such a rapid clip that they
may take the webfoots into camp if they
get over-confident, is theory.
Regulars to Start
At any rate, McEwan not only will
start his regular lineup, but he will use
it through most of the game, or at least
until Oregon gets a commanding lead,
if such a feat is possible.
Although the Oregon players took a
hard battering from the plunging Grange
men the team as a whole is in better
j shape than at any time this season since
the Washington game. Christensen,
tackle, and Stadelman, center, although
| both have badly bruised ankles, reported
for practice this week, and expect to ,
play the whole game. All the other web
foot players are in great shape except
Dave Mason, plucky halfback, who has
been out all season with a broken ankle.
