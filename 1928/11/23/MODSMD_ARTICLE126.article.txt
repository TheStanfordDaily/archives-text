# SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE INSPIRATION FOR WRIGHT BROTHERS' FIRST PLANE

DAYTON, 0., Nov. 22 (£>).—Sport
ing blood, love of adventure and a keen
desire to "make something out of noth
ing" was in a large measure responsible
for the Wright brothers' experiments
with airplanes, which finally resulted, 25
years ago, in the first human flight with
a power-driven hcavier-than-air machine.
"We began our tinkering and experi
menting for the pure sport of the tiling,
never hoping or even entertaining a
thought that we might make a penny
profit," recalled Orville Wright, who ac
tually piloted the plane, which he had de
veloped with his brother, the late Wiibur
Wright, on its first successful flight at
Kitty Hawk, N.C., in 1903.
"We thought it would be great sport
| to build something capable of carrying us
! aloft, and even as boys we kept building
I our kites bigger and bigger, hoping we
i might get one big enough to support us
j in flight.
"After we had flown successfully at
Kitty Hawk both Wilbur and I often
talked of the possibilities of flying as the
greatest of all sports, one that would
eclipse auto racing and other sports in

which men indulged for the joy of the
j thing.
"It has really been very disappointing
! to me to realize that sportsmen have fa.il
,ed to take to flying as a sport. The mil
! itary and commercial branches of flying
i have developed beyond our early expec
j tations in many ways, but the last 25
j years have seen little real interest in fly
; ing as a civilian sport. This is a phase i
of aviation which I hope will enjoy
greater development in the future."
Gliding, while of no practical value,
he says, is also a great sport, deserving j
of more popularity as a pastime. But j
j there is little interest in gliding in Amer- |
ica. Some attention lias been given it in !
Europe in recent years, however.
"The last time I visited the scene of
our first flights at Kitty Hawk was in
1911, when I went there to do some glid
ing with an English companion on vaca
i tion. It is a fascinating sport that should
i grip any true sportsman once he has
! tried it.
