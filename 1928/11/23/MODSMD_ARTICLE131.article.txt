# DIESEL EQUIPPED GERMAN TRACTOR REPORTED IN USE

### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22. (/P)—Soon
after the Packard Motor Company's
recent announcement that it has in
stalled successfully a new type Diesel
engine in an airplane, the department
of commerce has been informed by
Its Berlin trade commissioner that a
new tractor powered with a Diesel
motor has been put on the German
market.
The new German oil-burning trac
tor, which is being manufactured
with equipment for both agricultural
purposes and for street hauling, has
attracted much attention within the
German motor industry, James E.
Wallis, Jr., American trade commis
sioner at Berlin, reported to the de
partment.
Adaptation Is Recent
Adaptation of the Diesel oil-burning
type of engine, now in common use
in ships at sea, to the purposes of the
motor or airplane industry, had
shown little progress until the recent
experiments were completed with suc
cess.
The National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics has been working on
the development of an oil injection
engine for airplanes at its Langley
Field laboratories for some time, and
has reported encouraging progress in
its experiments. The Packard Motor
Company, from experiments carried
on privately and from aid obtained
through the National Advisory Com
mittee, recently perfected a Diesel
engine, installed it in an airplane,
and flew it with reported success.
The new German tractor engine
consists of a two-cylinder, compres
sorless Diesel motor having a con
tinuous output rating of 27 horse
power, and a maximum rating of 30
horsepower, at 850 revolutions a min
ute. The motor has been especially
developed for tractor work, with great
advantages both in fuel economy and
safety of operation.
