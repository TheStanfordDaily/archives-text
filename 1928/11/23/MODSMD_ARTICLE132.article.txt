# Violinist To Assist Allen At Beethoven Program in Memorial Church Sunday
## 
### 
Samuel Savannah, violinist, will assist
Warren D. Allen, University organist, in
a Beethoven program Sunday, at 7:30
o'clock in the Memorial Church. The
violin will be played both with the organ
and as a solo.
Ludwig von Beethoven left no works
for the organ, but some of his chamber
music and sonata movements can be
adapted for, and, in some cases, enriched
by the majesty and orchestral suggestions
of the organ. When a transcription of
a symphonic movement is essayed, only
a suggestion of the original colors can
be conveyed, but more successfully per
haps lhan with the piano.
The program is as follows:
Largo in C Major, from the Sonata
Opus 7 for Pianoforte.
Minuet in G (arranged for violin and
organ).
Andante and Scherzo from the Fifth
Symphony.
Adagio from the Sonate Pathetique,
Opus 13 (violin and organ).
Allegretto from the Seventh Sym
phony.
Romanze in G (for violin).
Hallelujah Chorus, from the "Mount
of Olives."
