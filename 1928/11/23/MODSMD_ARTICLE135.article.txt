## 
### 
CORVALLIS, Ore., Nov. 22. (/P)â€”
With a large tank of Corvallis water
aboard, 29 Oregon State gridders, ac
companied by Coach Paul Schissler,
Assistant Coach Scott, Trainer
Brower, and Student Manager Tuft,
left here today for their game with
New York University in the Yankee
Stadium, Thanksgiving Day.
The Beavers will work out on Sol
diers' Field, Chicago, next Monday
and Tuesday, and will meet Jim
Dixon, line coach, who has already
gone to scout the New York-Carnegie
Tech game in Pittsburgh, on the
twenty-fourth. Howard Maple, the
rousing quarterback, who has gone to
Illinois to attend the funeral of his
father, will also join the squad in
Chicago.
Reports from New York indicate
that the game will pack spectators to
capacity at the Yankee Stadium, par
ticular if the Violet pulls out on the
long end of the score, when it tangles
with the Tech men in Pittsburgh.
