# ALUMNI PLAN ELABORATE CELEBRATION
## California and Stanford Graduates Will Join in "Making Whoopee" at Numerous San Francisco Hostelries 
### 
Nearly every big Stanford and Cali
fornia alumni club in the country, and a
few others in large cities of other parts
of the world, has made elaborate plans
for celebrating tomorrow night, accord
ing to information issued from the office
of the Alumni Secretary. In practically
every case Stanford and California
alumni will meet jointly. In the after
noon the clubs will listen to play by
play accounts of the Big Game; follow
ing dinner and dancing will constitute
the principal entertainment.
A bulletin from New York City an
nounces that both Stanford and Califor
nia alumni will celebrate the Big Game
at the Aldine Club in the Fifth Avenue
Building. Play by play acounts of the
game will be received from 5:30 o'clock
on; dinner and dancing will follow, and
moving pictures of campus scenes on both
sides of the San Francisco Bay will be
shown during the evening.
Other Plans Made
Plans similar to those of the New
York clubs will be carried out wherever
the larger alumni groups are located.

Among others, the following clubs will
be active tomorrow night: Chicago, Phil
adelphia, Washington, Pittsburgh, Wil
kinsburgh (Pa.), Minneapolis and St.
Paul (combined), St. Louis, Kansas City,
Boston and Harvard (combined), Tulsa,
Dallas, and Honolulu.
Most of the clubs in the Bay region
have already carried out whatever Big
Game plans they may have had. All
these more or less local clubs have had
their entertainments before the Big Game
for the reason that a majority of the
members plan to attend the game in
Berkeley, and their own celebrations later.
