"At the beginning of the year
Stanford was a heavy favorite to
win over the Bears, but as the sea
son has rounded out it looks as
though we will meet on even terms.
We realize that we have the tough
est battle on our hands that the
coast has seen this season. It will
be our intention to match Califor
nia's defense with one just as
tough.
"The team is set to turn in its
best game of the year, and the
Cardinals' fight will be intensified
by the fact that the entire starting
backfield and three linesmen, Ro
besky, Post and Sellman, will be
playing their last Big Game.
"I look forward to a real battle."
