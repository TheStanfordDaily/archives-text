Husky Hunt and his
yearling eleven upset
California this year—an
evil portent for the
I Sears tomorrow. The
Card Babes climbed up
from the bottom of the
dope bucket to eke out
a 7 to 6 win from the
Cubs. Both outfits came
through a grueling sea
son with impressive rec
ords, but Hunt's team
fell before the young
sters from Troy, while
the Berkelevites tied the
Southerners.
