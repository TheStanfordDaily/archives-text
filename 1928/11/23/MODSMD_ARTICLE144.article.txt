# STANFORD ENTERS TOMORROWS FRAY AFTER HECTIC SEASON OF SURPRISES
## Grid Year Initiated With Defeat at Hands of Winged "O" Eleven; Loss to U.S.C. Hardest Blow for Card Team; Six Wins—Two Beatings Is 1928 Record for Warner Men 
### 
QTANFORD will enter tlie Big Game Saturday on even terms with California
after going through a season of ups and downs. At times the Cards have
been unbeatable, but on several occasions the Big Red Team has looked
like a second-rate outfit.
Stanford opened the season with an easy win over the Army, 21 to S.
Although the Cards had only been practicing for a week, they displayed
mid-season form in beating the soldiers. But on the next Saturday the
varsity received a setback at the hands of the Olympic Club, losing 12 to 8.
Kaer, former All-American, and the outstanding star in the club lineup, fea
tured the game when he ran a punt back through the entire Stanford team
for a touchdown. The varsity received a serious blow, as Johnnie Perston,
stellar end, broke his arm during the contest, an injury that kept him out
of the lineup until the Washington game last week.
On the following Saturday Stanford traveled up north and played Oregon
in its first Conference game. The varsity won by a two-touchdown margin,

but only after a hectic battle. Then the play
ers returned home to run over a green team
from U.C.L.A. The southern team managed to
score 'a touchdown early in the game when
Forster, flashy halfback, ran a kickoff back
through the whole Card team. But the Stan
ford offense got going in the second half and
ran up a score of 45 points.
Idaho proved soft for Stanford. The Big
Red Team bucked, passed, and faked its way
through the fog at Kezar Stadium for seven
touchdowns. A second-string backfleld played
better bail than the first string. Particularly
outstanding was the work of Bill Simpkins at
fullback and Spud Lewis at halfback.
The first-string players took a complete rest
on the next week-end. The third, fourth, and
fifth squads trampled on the weak Fresno
State team for a -17-to-0 score.
Trojans Win
Then came the awful upset at U.S.C. when
Stanford marched its way all over the field.
Three times the Cards got the ball down to the
Trojan 5-yard line —and three times the varsity
fumbled away its chance to score. Stanford
beat herself. The work of the entire Stanford
line was outstanding. Time after time "Dy
nacic Don" Williams hurled himself at the
line—and time after time he was held for no
gain. But a couple of lucky breaks, a pass, a
place-kick—and Stanford went down to defeat,
10 to 0.
Another breathing spell followed after the
U.S.C. battle. Stanford avenged her last year's
defeat at the hands of Santa Clara by whip
ping the Broncos by the score of 31 to 0. Once
more the work of a second-string backfleld
combination stood out.
Last Saturday the varsity had a close call.
Stanford defeated Washington by two touch
downs, but had a real tough time in doing so.
For the lirst time this season Stanford failed
to make more yards than her opponent. The
Simkins to Muller passing and receiving com
bination gave the Cards their fourth win.

through the fog at Kezar Stadium for seven
touchdowns. A second-string backfleld played
better bail than the first string. Particularly
outstanding was the work of Bill Simpkins at
fullback and Spud Lewis at halfback.
The first-string players took a complete rest
on the next week-end. The third, fourth, and
fifth squads trampled on the weak Fresno
State team for a -17-to-0 score.
Trojans Win
Then came the awful upset at U.S.C. when
Stanford marched its way all over the field.
Three times the Cards got the ball down to the
Trojan 5-yard line —and three times the varsity
fumbled away its chance to score. Stanford
beat herself. The work of the entire Stanford
line was outstanding. Time after time "Dy
nacic Don" Williams hurled himself at the
line—and time after time he was held for no
gain. But a couple of lucky breaks, a pass, a
place-kick—and Stanford went down to defeat,
10 to 0.
Another breathing spell followed after the
U.S.C. battle. Stanford avenged her last year's
defeat at the hands of Santa Clara by whip
ping the Broncos by the score of 31 to 0. Once
more the work of a second-string backfleld
combination stood out.
Last Saturday the varsity had a close call.
Stanford defeated Washington by two touch
downs, but had a real tough time in doing so.
For the lirst time this season Stanford failed
to make more yards than her opponent. The
Simkins to Muller passing and receiving com
bination gave the Cards their fourth win.
QTANFORD will enter tlie Big Game Saturday on even terms with California
after going through a season of ups and downs. At times the Cards have
been unbeatable, but on several occasions the Big Red Team has looked
like a second-rate outfit.
Stanford opened the season with an easy win over the Army, 21 to S.
Although the Cards had only been practicing for a week, they displayed
mid-season form in beating the soldiers. But on the next Saturday the
varsity received a setback at the hands of the Olympic Club, losing 12 to 8.
Kaer, former All-American, and the outstanding star in the club lineup, fea
tured the game when he ran a punt back through the entire Stanford team
for a touchdown. The varsity received a serious blow, as Johnnie Perston,
stellar end, broke his arm during the contest, an injury that kept him out
of the lineup until the Washington game last week.
On the following Saturday Stanford traveled up north and played Oregon
in its first Conference game. The varsity won by a two-touchdown margin,

but only after a hectic battle. Then the play
ers returned home to run over a green team
from U.C.L.A. The southern team managed to
score 'a touchdown early in the game when
Forster, flashy halfback, ran a kickoff back
through the whole Card team. But the Stan
ford offense got going in the second half and
ran up a score of 45 points.
Idaho proved soft for Stanford. The Big
Red Team bucked, passed, and faked its way
through the fog at Kezar Stadium for seven
touchdowns. A second-string backfleld played
better bail than the first string. Particularly
outstanding was the work of Bill Simpkins at
fullback and Spud Lewis at halfback.
