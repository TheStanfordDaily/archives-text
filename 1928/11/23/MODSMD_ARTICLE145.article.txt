Ramblers from the Middle West. On the other
hand, the Cards, if they win from California to
morrow, will go east with the approval of the
West as its worthy representative in spite of the
setback at the hands of the Trojans, for the
Berkeley Bears have tied the Trojans.
The contest will present not less than two All -
American candidates, Captain Biff Hoffman, and
Christian Caglc of Army. Possible candidates
