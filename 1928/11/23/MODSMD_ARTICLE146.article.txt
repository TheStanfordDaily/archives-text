That is tne question perplexing
thousands today. Here is what two
gentlemen from Berkeley have to say
on the subject. Introducing Mr. "Nibs"
Price, California grid mentor, and
Mr. Irv. Phillips, varsity captain:
NIBS PRICE—"It will be a hard
struggle. California, getting her share
of the breaks, has a good chance to
win this year's Big Game. We are in
a better position to take the Stanford
contest than we have been for sev
eral years. It is difficult to predict
the outcome."
CAPT IRV. PHILLIPS—"I don't
know what to say about the Big
