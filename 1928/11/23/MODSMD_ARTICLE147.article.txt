# BEAR LEADER
## 
### 
Irvine Phillips, captain and
right end of the Blue-and-Gold
outfit, is climaxing a brilliant
gridiron career in tomorrow's
battle in the Berkeley Stadium.
He is expected to figure promi
nently tomorrow on defense as
well as offense. On numerous
occasions this season he has
demonstrated his ability as a
pass-received and sure tackier.
Phillips is the man who in
tercepted Duffield's last-minute
pass in the thrilling 0-0 tie game
with the Trojans, thus saving
the day for California whose
goal seemed sure to be crossed
by the desperate twelfth-hour
attempts of the U.S.C. quarter
back. He was a constant threat
all through the contest as a
pass-receiver and netted his
team considerable yardage via
the aerial route. In addition, he
showed Southern California
early in the game that his end
of the line was a poor place for
the Thundering Herd to direct
its sweeping end runs.
California's greatest line
strength is in the ends with
and Averv.
