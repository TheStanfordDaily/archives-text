# PRESIDENT-ELECT PLANS DAYLIGHT TRIP OVER ANDES
## 
### 
U.S.S. MARYLAND, Nov. 22 (/P).—
Having hooked two fish from the deep
sea waters off the southernmost tip of
Lower California, Herbert Hoover today
put thoughts of fishing foremost as the
Maryland steamed south toward his first
port of call on his goodwill tour.
Fishing from a motorboat 25 miles off
Cape San Lucas, Mr. Hoover in 45
minutes caught a 15-pound dolphin and
a five-pound Spanish mackerel. He lost
what was apparently his largest strike
when his line fouled.
The Maryland is expected to arrive at
the Gulf of Fonesca on Sunday and Mr.
Hoover will then visit the ports of
Amapala, Honduras, and La Union, Sal
vador. As the vessel continued south
ward today plans for the trip northward
from Rio Janeiro on the U.S.S. Utah
were still under discussion. Mr. Hoover
expected to visit Havana and might go
from there to Mexico. He will also visit
Montevideo and may possibly go to San
to Domingo.
The only Central American capital to
be visited is San Jose, Costa Rica, where
he will journey by automobile from the
port of Punta Arenas. Time and dis
tance will prevent overland journeys to
other Central American capitals. For
these reasons when he reaches Guayaquil,
Ecuador, Mr. Hoover will be unable to
visit the capital at Quito. He does plan,
however, to journey inland to Lima from
the port of Callao, I'eru.
The Hoover party will leave the Mary
land at Valparaiso, Chile. From there
he will go to Santiago for a ; stay of a
day and a night. He will start across
the Andes in a special train early in the
morning so that the run between the
high mountain peaks may he enjoyed by
daylight.
The special train will stop long enough
to permit the party to inspect the statue,
"Christ of the Andes," which was erected
in commemoration of the adjustment of
the boundary line between Chile and Ar
gentina.
