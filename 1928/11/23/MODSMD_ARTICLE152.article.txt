# Memorial Stadium Will Have Giant Loudspeaker For Contest Tomorrow
## 
### 
Eight giant horns on the north score
board of the California Memorial Sta
dium at Berkeley will tell eighty thou
sand spectators of the progress of the
Cardinal against the Golden Bear.
> The loudspeaker resembles the elevcn
! horn unit in the Stanford Stadium in
that the amplifiers are connected direct
: to the power lines, giving clarity which
|is impossible with battery electricity.
First used for the Nevada game, the
i unit had but six horns, which were found
! inadequate for a large audience.
With this new outfit it is thought
that people who have seats on Tightwad
hill will be able to follow the game more
closely, and with this in view, seats there
; have been sold at one dollar each.
