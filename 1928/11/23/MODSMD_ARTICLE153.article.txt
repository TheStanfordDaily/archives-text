# BEARS CONFIDENT OF WINNING BIG GAME
## CALIFORNIA SQUAD EXPECTS TO CHECK CARD OFFENCE WITH TIGHT DEFENCE California Expects Nibs Price to Open Bag of Tricks as lough Fight Looms; U.C. Sports Writer Reports That Golden Bear Will Win on Its Defensive Strength Alone 
### FRED LAWLESS, '29 Assistant Sports Editor, Daily California 
nERKELEY, Nov. 22. (Special to the Stanford Daily)—The office wise
cracker draped himself over our shoulders this afternoon and remarked

<« that the Big Game will be as tight as a drunken
sailor on f-horo leave.
No one will rise to dispute that statement.
The sons of the Stanford Red display, on little
or no urging, facts proving the Cardinals will
i win. The Golden Bears are a bit grim about it,
| but they, too, will prove to you that California
i can win.
Everybody Is Happy
Everybody is happy about it. A 1 and George,
J the boomers, because they can lift horns win,
! lose or draw. Bob, the rooter, because ho has
J some swell chest tones he has been practicing
iin the bathtub. Only Bill Monahan, who sits
I in the graduate manager's chair, is a bit
gloomy. Some of the alumni and boys with
pull have been making life pretty hot for Bill
these days. And there just aren't any more
seats in the Stadium.
All because of a football game. The office
wisecracker didn't even coine near the mark
when he said a football game was two halves,
four quarters, and a lot of loose change from
the alumni.
To get down to cases, let's see how the two
teams stack up from the California angle:
CALIFORNIA —The best defensive team on
the Coast. You can't lose a game when the
opposition can't score on you, and that's the
chief reason why the Bears have won three
and tied one to share the the Conference lead
with the Trojans. Price's men are real ball
hawks and make breaks for themselves on the
slightest excuse. California hasn't shown a
genuine offensive punch yet, but neither has
any team against California.
STANFORD —Potentially the champion of
the Coast; actually, in third place. The Cards
have shown at times the greatest attacking
power of any team in re.cent years, but have
broken up their own power with mistakes. If
they fumble in the Big Game as they did for
U.S.C., Heaven help 'em! Defensively, the
Cards' only real weakness is against passes,
the Bears' only real strength in attack as
shown in past games.
Is Price Tricky?
Whispers from Memorial Stadium have it
that Nibs Price will pull several fast ones on
Pop Warner's boys. The Bear chief has sev
eral plays, so it is said, that are sure shots
against any team —and Price hasn't been

forced to use any of them this year.
Price came out today and said
flatly he was not worried over the
results of the game, and when Nibs
speaks for publication he always has
plenty to back up his word. More
over, there is plenty of California
money over here, and the alumni
aren't howling too loudly for odds.
The grads that were yipping at
Price's heels last year are yelling just
as loudly for him this season.
Odds Are Even
Anybody that wants to can bet on
hopes, but on records, Stanford really
is no better than even money with
California. The Bears stormed through
Nevada to wind up a season, up to
the: Big Game, that is without a flaw
on the record sheets.
The Bears tied the Trojans when
they weren't given a chance to win,
and beat everybody else. They won on
defensive football, just as they did in
1923 when they beat Stanford 9 to 0
by simply cashing in on the Cards'
mistakes.
The inhabitants of the California
camp see the Golden Bear on top this
year because of that marvelous de
fensive football. Many of them have
deserted Pop Warner's throne to get
on the bandwagon with Price, al
though last year they were following
in the footsteps of the enthusiastic
young Stanford gentry who had in
vested Pop with the miracle halo the
last three years.
