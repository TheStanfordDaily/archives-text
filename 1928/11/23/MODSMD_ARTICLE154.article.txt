# MILES LECTURES ON INVESTIGATION OF DRUG EFFECTS
## Psychology Professor Tells Method of Testing at Medical Assembly 
### JEAN BLUM 
"The Psycho-biological Investiga
tion of Drugs" was the general topic
of three lectures by Dr. Walter R.
Miles, Professor of Experimental
Psychology, last week, in the initia
tion of the Benton N. Colver Lecture-
Hhip established in Los Angele√ü this
year. The lectureship was established
ut the College of Medical Evangelists
and is the first of its kind in that
city.
The lectures were attended largely
by doctors and medical Btudents of
Los Angeles. The final lecture was
given at the time of the county medi
cal society meeting, which was one
of the largest ever held.
Methods Explained
"Animal Learning and the Psycho
bioassay of Drugs" was the topic of
the first lecture given on November
13. In this talk Dr. Miles explained
the three methods of drug-testing. The
first and primitive one is by experi
ence. Under this method advance
ment is made, but usually at a great
cost to humanity, he explained. The
second method is known as experi
mentive. This was a great improve
ment and has been used almost con
sistently up to the present day. It
was carried on by applying the drug
to the various parts of the body such
as the heart, muscles, and intestines.
The final method is the most com
plete and a system lately introduced
to the medical science by psychology,
he said. This process is known as the
psycho-bioassay of drugs. The drugs
are applied to the acquired traits
through the nerve centers. Dr. Miles
explained that in cases where the
orug will have no effect on the parts
of the body they will have a strong
effect on the various acquired traits.
Maze Is Used
Lecture number two was "Import
ant Drugs Weighed on the Behavior
Balance." In this lecture Dr. Miles
used a maze to explain his topic. By
placing food at one end of a maze,
after twenty trials the mouse was
able to reach the food without a mis
take en route. Various drugs were
then injected into the blood stream
of the animal. With the injection of
natural drugs such as adrenin and
insulin, the passage through the maze
was slower and with less efficiency.
With the injection of other drugs
many interesting facts were brought
to light. Presence of morphine makes
the muscles tight and slows action.
Hyoscine has the queer property to
blot out the memory but not effect the
physical actions. Caffein had the near
est normal effect. None of drug sub
stances cause the animals to be
quicker or more accurate than when
normal, Miles explained.
The final lecture was on the topic,
"Dilute Alcoholic Beverages and Hu
man Behavior." It showed that with
the administration of a dilute alco
holic beverage the co-ordination of
human behavior was lowered from
five to ten per cent.
Dr. Walter R. Miles was the first
psychologist to speak before a medical
assembly of this type on the topic.
