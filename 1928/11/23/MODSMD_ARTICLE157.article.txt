# FORD COLLECTING OLD ANTIQUES FOR VILLAGE
## 
### 
Henry Ford is busily collecting Ameri
can antiques for a village, Dearborn, near
Detroit, in which will be a full series of
every article used or made in America
from the days of the first settlers to the
present time. When the project is com
pleted it will contain blacksmith shops,
brickyards, a tannery, a general store, a
candleshop, cigar store, gun shop, rug
store, public buildings, daguerrotype stu
dios, school, church, and fire house.
Mr. Ford plans to recruit his inhabi
tants from among his employees; and
intends that rather than a "dead mu
seum," this village is going to be a visi
ble connection between early industry and
its modern developments.
