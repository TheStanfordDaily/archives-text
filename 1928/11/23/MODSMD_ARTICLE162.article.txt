# HUNT, BRADSHAW DEVELOP FIGHTING FROSH GRIDSTERS
## Freshman Team Has Finished Successful Season With California Victory 
### FRANK WHITELY 
From a small squad of, for the most
part, light and inexperienced freshman
gridsters, Coaches Husky Hunt and
Rabbit Bradshaw developed a fighting
eleven and guided it through a successful
1928 season, climaxed by a 7-6 victory
in the Little Big Game, and marred by
only one defeat, at the hands of the
U.S.C. freshmen, and a tie with the 250 th
Coast Artillery.
The Little Big Game with the Califor
nia freshmen, which concluded the Card
first year men's season, was a classic
among freshman games. It was a game
filled from start to finish with thrills,
breaks and good football. The Stanford
frosh outfought a more powerful Bear
team and deserved that victory if ever
a team from the Farm did.
In the next most important game of
the year, that with the U.S.C. freshmen
the week preceding the California con
test, HuntJ's eleven fought hard and
played well but was beaten by the breaks,
a blocked punt and a fumble accounting
for the 12 Southern California Points.
The other games, with the exception
of the Coast Artillery contest which was
the first played by the freshmen, resulted
in overwhelming victories for the Cardi
nal yearlings. They trounced the Santa
Rosa Junior College, 39-0; Santa Clara
Junior College, 42-0; Pasadena Junior
College, 33-0; St. Mary's Junior College.
19-0; and the Southern All-Stars, 26-0.
In eight games the freshmen scored
171 points, allowing but 24 to be scored
against them.
Tnere was not such a plentitude of
good varsity material in the freshman
squad this year as last, but there were
some exceptionally good men, both in
the line and the backfield; and these
should see service under Pop Warner
during the next three years.
