### 
ITHACA, N.Y., Nov. 22 (PIP)â€”A
federal investigation of the liquor situ
ation at Cornell is expected by the fra
ternities in the near future.
The Daily Sun, student paper, warns
men students that the investigating offi
cers will not "be heralded by trumpets"
and "that a campus Paul Revere will not
be appointed to ride ahead and warn all
students to throw away their liquor."
Since investigation, rather than immedi
ate action is the purpose of the authori
ties, the student body is advised to so
deport itself that action will not be
necessary.
