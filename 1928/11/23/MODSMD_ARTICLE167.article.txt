### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22 (/P).â€”'The
annual trek of this section's football fans
and alumni of both institutions to the
Stanford-California "Big Game" at
Berkeley tomorrow is expected to be the
greatest in the history of the gridiron
clash.
Reports by various transportation sys
tems which are preparing for the rush
indicate that between 7,000 and 10,000
will go by air, rail, water and automo
bile to the scene of the struggle. The
Southern Pacific railway announced that
it will dispatch three special trains to
night. Wesetrn Air Express states that
most of the capacity of its regularly
scheduled planes for Friday and Satur
day has been spoken for, and additional

craft will be put on the northern run if
demand warrants.
The game tomorrow will draw many
followers of the University of Southern
California football team, now tied with
California for the Pacific Coast confer
ence championship. A Stanford victory
will give Southern California the con
ference title, where a California triumph
would result in a tie between the Golden
Bears and the Trojans.
