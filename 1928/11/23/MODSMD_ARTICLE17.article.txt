LOS ANGELES, Nov. 22. (/P) â€”
Coach Howard Jones of Southern
California fell victim to the influenza
today, taking to his bed while the
Trojan footballers went through their
daily workout in preparation for the
games with Idaho and Notre Dame
under the eyes of his assistants.
Jones was confined with only a
slight attack of the "flu," and is ex
pected to be on the field again in a
day or two.
A hopeful sign for the Conference
climaxing game with the giant Idaho
Vandals Saturday was seen in the re
turn to uniform of Francis Tappaan,
star end. Tappaan, who twisted his
aiikle in the Washington State game
last week, was thought to be out of
the lineup for at least one more week.
Charley Horen, running guard, re
mains as the lone injury on the Tro
jan squad. His twisted left knee was
reported as greatly improved.
