# CARD FOILSMEN SECOND IN HERON TROPHY MATCHES
## 
### 
Stanford's fencing team has completed
its activities for the fall quarter with a
record of two victories and one defeat
in competition for the \V. S. Heron tro
phy. The annual competitors tor this
trophy include Stanford, California, the
Olympic Club, and the Unione Sportiva
Italiana Virtus.
The Olympic Club won the trophy this
year when it defeated the Stanford foils
men 10-9. Stanford won from the Uni
versity of California and from the
Unione Sportiva Italiana Virtus.
The Cards scored a total of thirty
eight points to thirty-seven for their op
ponents. Competition for the Heron
trophy is between five-man teams. For
Stanford, Herk Adams, varsity captain,
has been the outstanding point-winner.
Fletcher Dutton, Orray Taft, and Jack
Snyder have accounted for many of the
Cardinal points. Udell Walk and Henry
Haussamen, newcomers, gained valuable
experience during this year's matches.
Lack of experience has been the great
est weakness of the Stanford team. Coach
Ehvyn Bugge has scheduled a good many
of these matches for the purpose of de
veloping experienced fencers who will be
able to hold their own when the more im
portant intercollegiate tilts take place
next April.
