# Purdue Renews Relations With Wabash After Lapse
## 
### 
LAFAYETTE, Indiana, Nov. 22.â€”

dating back to 1889, was renewed here
last Saturday when the Purdue Boiler
makers met the Wabash eleven in the
twenty-seventh meeting between the two
foes. Last year marked one of the few
reasons the two teams have not met.
