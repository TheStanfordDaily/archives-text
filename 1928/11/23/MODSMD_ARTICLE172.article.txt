# CARDS HAVE WON MAJORITY OF BIG GAME CONTESTS
## Stanford Leads California By Three Tilts Out of Thirty-Three Played 
### 
The California-Stanford football game,
blue ribbon event of Pacific Coast sports,
will be played for the thirty-fourth time
tomorrow before a crowd of 82,000.
This annual struggle between the Cali
fornia Bear and the Stanford Cardinal
has grown to be one of the most famous
and spectacular sport events in the en
tire United States. It was in March,
1892, that these teams first met, almost
four decades ago. At that time a mere
handful of spectators looked 011 and
now more than 200,000 clamor for seats
to this classic. Even when the outcome
has been a foregone conclusion, interest
has always been at a peak.
Stanford Wins Majority
Out of thirty-three games, California
has won twelve, Stanford fifteen and
six have ended in a tie. American foot
ball has been played twenty-four times;
the Blue and Gold winning nine of the
games, Stanford ten, and five have been
tied. The Bear has conquered in .three
out of the nine Rugby games, the Cardi
nal five, while one resulted in a tie.
Stanford won four games and tied
three in the first seven games played
from 1892 to 1897. In 1898 California
broke through to its first victory and
until 1919 the two teams battled back
and forth, either of them seldom win
ning more than two consecutive con
tests. In 1919 the Blue and Gold started
a winning streak that lasted until the
famous struggle of 1924 when the first
Warner-coached Stanford team came
from behind in the final quarter to score
two touchdowns and knot the score at
20-20. Since then Warner's eleven has
come out on the long end of the score
every time. Tomorrow afternoon "Pop"
sends his fifth Stanford varsity against
the third Bear eleven trained under
"Nibs" Price, in what many believe will
be one of the closest and most exciting
of all Big Games.
