Johnny Preston, swift left end on the Card squad and Palo
Alto's contribution to Stanford, is back in the game after an
absence of seven weeks. He had his forearm fractured in the
Olympic Club game at the start of the season and consequently
was kept on the bench until last Saturday when he started at
his regular position against the Washington Huskies. He will
play tomorrow against the Bears and expects to see action in
the game in New York with the Napoleons from the Hudson
district.
Preston, having another-year of collegiate competition, will
be counted upon for much service on the big Red line during
the 1929 season when Sellman, Post, and Robesky will have
been lost through graduation.
