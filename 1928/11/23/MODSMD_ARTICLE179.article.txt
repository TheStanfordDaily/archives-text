# NEW CANDIDATES BOOST PROSPECTS OF CARD CAGERS
## 
### 
An average of twenty-two candidates
for Stanford's 1928 varsity basketball
squad, including four lettennen and last
year's complete freshman team, are work
ing out from four to six o'clock every
afternoon under the watchful eyes of
Coach Ernest "Husky" Hunt and Assist
ant Coach James "Rabbit" liradshaw.
"It's hard to tell anything about the
season's possibilities this early," says
Hunt, "but I am unusually pleased with
speed with which the boys are rounding
into shape. There is plenty of competi
tion for every position, and this should
be a great aid in turning out a good
team."
Practice Drill
During the past two weeks Hunt has
been running the candidates through a
fast practice drill, which covers nearly
every department of the game in general
and the pivot, overhand pass and short
shot in particular. Husky is being assist
ed in the coaching this year by Rabbit
Bradshaw, former member of the Uni
versity of Nevada coaching staff.
The four lettermen who have been
turning out for the practice sessions are
John McCandless, center on the 1926
team who did not return* to school last
year; Harry Berg, captain of the 1926
freshman team and a promising forward;
Bill Clark, and Dowle Richards, also
forwards on last year's team.
Captain Harlow Rothert and Greer
Thompson, first string guards on last
year's varsity, are still out for football
and will probably not return to the courts
until after the Army game on December
1. Chuck Smalling, lirst string center on
the same team, is also on the football
squad.
Promising Sophomores
The 1927 freshman quintet has return
ed intact with Mears, center, Reynolds
and Tampcke, guards, and Fawcett and
Hawkins, forwards, all on deck. In ad
dition to these, there are several other
promising sophomores turning out for
the practice sessions, Hunt says, including
Virgil Hepp and Yard Loomis, forwards,
and William Okker and Charles Bonndr,
centers.
A defiinite schedule has not been drawn

team."
Practice Drill
During the past two weeks Hunt has
been running the candidates through a
fast practice drill, which covers nearly
every department of the game in general
and the pivot, overhand pass and short
shot in particular. Husky is being assist
ed in the coaching this year by Rabbit
Bradshaw, former member of the Uni
versity of Nevada coaching staff.
The four lettermen who have been
turning out for the practice sessions are
John McCandless, center on the 1926
team who did not return* to school last
year; Harry Berg, captain of the 1926
freshman team and a promising forward;
Bill Clark, and Dowle Richards, also
forwards on last year's team.
Captain Harlow Rothert and Greer
Thompson, first string guards on last
year's varsity, are still out for football
and will probably not return to the courts
until after the Army game on December
1. Chuck Smalling, lirst string center on
the same team, is also on the football
squad.
Promising Sophomores
The 1927 freshman quintet has return
ed intact with Mears, center, Reynolds
and Tampcke, guards, and Fawcett and
Hawkins, forwards, all on deck. In ad
dition to these, there are several other
promising sophomores turning out for
the practice sessions, Hunt says, including
Virgil Hepp and Yard Loomis, forwards,
and William Okker and Charles Bonndr,
centers.
A defiinite schedule has not been drawn
up as yet, but several practice games
have been arranged for the first and sec
ond week of December, announces Major
Godsol, manager.
An average of twenty-two candidates
for Stanford's 1928 varsity basketball
squad, including four lettennen and last
year's complete freshman team, are work
ing out from four to six o'clock every
afternoon under the watchful eyes of
Coach Ernest "Husky" Hunt and Assist
ant Coach James "Rabbit" liradshaw.
"It's hard to tell anything about the
season's possibilities this early," says
Hunt, "but I am unusually pleased with
speed with which the boys are rounding
into shape. There is plenty of competi
tion for every position, and this should
be a great aid in turning out a good
team."
