# CARDS SET FOR CALIFORNIANS
## PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENT FAVORS STANFORD IN CLASSIC GRID GAME Red Lineup Will Be Composed Of Regulars; Heinecke, Sellman, Muller Expected To Be Ready For Action 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
DSYCHOLOGY, that subtle element of football which has decided so
many games, will be much in evidence in tomorrow's momentous battle
between Stanford and California and, unless the flu jinx Incomes more
serious than it is now, the venerable Pop Warner will have ahold of the
psychological puppet strings to direct the drama in favor of the Cardinals.
The game, being one of a strong offense system against a strong
defense system, black against white, will be won on the strength of these
respective factors. If the black pigment in the solution has sufficient in
tensity to absorb the white, then the presence of white will no longer
exist. Stanford will win if the Warner offense is stronger than the
Price defense.
Here is how the two teams stack up in the matter of their respective
strength:
Stanford has a strong offense as is demonstrated by its scoring this
season. The Cards scored twelve points on Washington whom the Bears
were able to defeat only by six points on a sloppy field, the kind that

'favors their own style of play. Stan
ford defeated a fighting Santa Clara
squad 31-0 with a substitute back
fiekl; the Blue-and-Gold won from
the Broncos 22-0. Stanford scored
twenty-six points against Oregon;
the Bears were able to score only
twelve.
Great Defense Record
California has its finest defensive rec
ord since the days of Andy Smith. Its
goal has not been crossed once this sea
son by a college team. It held the Olym
pic Club to two touchdowns but was
unable to score against the "Winged O"
as Stanford was. Its biggest achieve
ment is its tie with Southern California,
the Cards' victors.
To compare the strength of the two
rivals reveals that California has a great
defense, but not one which cannot be
superseded by Stanford's offense at its
best. And there lies the question that
the Red's supporters are pondering upon.
Will the Warner machine be at its best ?
Will it play as it did against the Tro
jans, or will it function as it did against
Idaho and others?
Cards at Top Form
Providing that Heinecke and Sellnian
are able to play—and it seems that they
will—the Cardinal squad should work
better than it has at any time this rea
son, for the Redshirts have learned a
valuable lesson which will give them an
advantage over the confident Berkeley
outfit.
Tiny Sellman and Mush Muller have
joined the team after an absence with
illness and will probably be able to start
in the game tomorrow at their regular
positions. Walt Heinecke is still in the
Palo Alto hospital. He will join his
team-mates tonight at the Mt. Diablo
Country Club where they are staying
until tomorrow morning.
Warner believes that the majority of
his men are at their peak of physical
condition. He let them practice only a
half hour yesterday and then only to run
signals on the plays with which Pop
hopes to surprise his young rival, Nibs
Price.
Outing Planned
The team will have an opportunity to
forget the game and all of the worries
connected with football when they jour
ney up to Mt. Diablo this morning for a
three hours outing. While they arc
making that pleasure trip, Warner, Cap
tain liiff Hoffman and one of the start
ing linesmen will travel over to the Berk
eley Stadium to examine the turf and
acquaint themselves with the playing
field.
The probable starting lineup for to
morrow will be:
Muller REL Avery
Artman RTL Fitz
Robesky RGL Gill
Heinecke C Riegcls
Post LGR Schwartz
Sell man LTR Bancroft.

half hour yesterday and then only to run
signals on the plays with which Pop
hopes to surprise his young rival, Nibs
Price.
Outing Planned
The team will have an opportunity to
forget the game and all of the worries
connected with football when they jour
ney up to Mt. Diablo this morning for a
three hours outing. While they arc
making that pleasure trip, Warner, Cap
tain liiff Hoffman and one of the start
ing linesmen will travel over to the Berk
eley Stadium to examine the turf and
acquaint themselves with the playing
field.
The probable starting lineup for to
morrow will be:

DSYCHOLOGY, that subtle element of football which has decided so
many games, will be much in evidence in tomorrow's momentous battle
between Stanford and California and, unless the flu jinx Incomes more
serious than it is now, the venerable Pop Warner will have ahold of the
psychological puppet strings to direct the drama in favor of the Cardinals.
The game, being one of a strong offense system against a strong
defense system, black against white, will be won on the strength of these
respective factors. If the black pigment in the solution has sufficient in
tensity to absorb the white, then the presence of white will no longer
exist. Stanford will win if the Warner offense is stronger than the
Price defense.
Here is how the two teams stack up in the matter of their respective
strength:
Stanford has a strong offense as is demonstrated by its scoring this
season. The Cards scored twelve points on Washington whom the Bears
were able to defeat only by six points on a sloppy field, the kind that

'favors their own style of play. Stan
ford defeated a fighting Santa Clara
squad 31-0 with a substitute back
fiekl; the Blue-and-Gold won from
the Broncos 22-0. Stanford scored
twenty-six points against Oregon;
the Bears were able to score only
twelve.
Great Defense Record
California has its finest defensive rec
ord since the days of Andy Smith. Its
goal has not been crossed once this sea
son by a college team. It held the Olym
pic Club to two touchdowns but was
unable to score against the "Winged O"
as Stanford was. Its biggest achieve
ment is its tie with Southern California,
the Cards' victors.
To compare the strength of the two
rivals reveals that California has a great
defense, but not one which cannot be
superseded by Stanford's offense at its
best. And there lies the question that
the Red's supporters are pondering upon.
Will the Warner machine be at its best ?
Will it play as it did against the Tro
jans, or will it function as it did against
Idaho and others?
Cards at Top Form
Providing that Heinecke and Sellnian
are able to play—and it seems that they
will—the Cardinal squad should work
better than it has at any time this rea
son, for the Redshirts have learned a
valuable lesson which will give them an
advantage over the confident Berkeley
outfit.
Tiny Sellman and Mush Muller have
joined the team after an absence with
illness and will probably be able to start
in the game tomorrow at their regular
positions. Walt Heinecke is still in the
Palo Alto hospital. He will join his
team-mates tonight at the Mt. Diablo
Country Club where they are staying
until tomorrow morning.
Warner believes that the majority of
his men are at their peak of physical
condition. He let them practice only a
half hour yesterday and then only to run
signals on the plays with which Pop
hopes to surprise his young rival, Nibs
Price.
