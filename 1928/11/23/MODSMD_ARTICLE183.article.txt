# Revision of Plans for New Women's Gym Are Now Under Roth's Direction
## 
### 
Revision and completion of the ten-i
tative plans for a proposed new women's
gymnasium on the campus have been
under way during the last two weeks
under the supervision of Comptroller!
Roth, Helen Masters Bunting, head of
the women's physical education depart
ment, and the associated architects of
the University, Bakewell and Brown. Re
drafts of the plans have been made, and
the architectural drawings are expected
to be finished in the near future.
The proposed gym would be built
around an artistic patio following the
architecture of the University, according
to the tentative plans. Provisions are
made for basketball, fencing, archery, I
rifle, and other organized sports. There
will be a dance studio, a corrective clinic
with rest rooms and a sun porch, and
finally a unit for housing a major de
partment making possible the training of
teachers in physical education. There has
been a constant demand for a major de
partment in the last ten years, according
to Helen Masters Bunting, head of the
women's physical education.
The present women's gymnasium on
the campus was built when the Univer
sity was opened, 1891, thirty-six years
ago. At that time it was called a "tem
porary structure."
