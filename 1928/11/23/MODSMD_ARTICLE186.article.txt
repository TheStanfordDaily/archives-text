# STANFORD GRAYS HAVE DIFFICULTY SECURING GAMES
## 
### 
Coach Kd Walker's efforts to procure
a post-season game for the Stanford
Grays against the St. Ignatius reserves
were futile, due to the fact the S;*i
Francisco team has disbanded for the
season. The Grays have had hard hiclt
getting games all year as two scheduled
contests were called off at the last min
ute.
Although unable to get much opj>osi
tion, the Grays have shown up well in
the two games they played. Against tli*:
St. Mary's reserves, the local team scored
three touchdowns, and had practically no
trouble in advancing the ball at will. The
contest against the Bear Goofs was al
most a rout. The Grays had the Bears,
on the run during all four quarters, and
assembled a total of twenty-six points.
A number of likely looking linesmen
form this year's Gray organization and
should make a good bid for berths on
next season's varsity squad. Albert son,,
at center, and Oliver, Erhorn, and Daw
son at either guard or tackle positions,
are going to put up a stiff battle for
places on the '29 varsity. All of these
men have played a consistent brand of
football.
Phil Moffat and Jake May are the
two most likely looking prospects from
the backfield. The former is a powerful
ball pusher, and is good at kicking and
passing. May has played a steady game
at all times, lie is good at catching
passes and at running interference.
The Grays will not disband until the
season is over for the first string men.
They will continue to come out three
times a week, and work out against the
varsity when the occasion demands.
