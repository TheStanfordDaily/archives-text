# HERO OF COLLEGE DRAMA NOW ON LEGITIMATE STAGE
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
. ; College theatricals very definitely gave
'Charles Brokawi the romantic young hero
of "The Squall" at the Geary theater,
to the stage. If he hadn't been cast in
a campus play during his junior year at
Ohio Slate University, but he was. And
here he is far from home now—a suc
cessful actor.
As Juan Mendez, a hot blooded Span
ish youth tempted by the Gypsy adven
turess, Nubi, he makes a melodramatic
role human. "It's hard to say some of
the lines seriously," he admitted to me
recently. But one forgets the unreality
of the character when watching Mr. Bro
kaw living Juan.
Stanford alumni will be interested to
learn that Mr. Brokaw is the husband
of Florence Mason, a Stanford Theta
who has made good as an actress in New
York City. They were married last year,
and Until last Spring they both played in
New York.
When Jane Cowl came West with "The
Road to Rome" this summer, Mr. Bro
kaw was in her company. He had been
j>laying with Miss Cowl for more than a
year, but when she started back he de
cided to stay on the Coast for awhile.
He stepped into the leading male role of
"The Squall" and Miss Mason, his wife, '
is playing in "The Marriage Bed" which
ojxmis Monday night at the Columbia
Iheater.
"I belonged to the dramatic societies
at Ohio State, and they gave me the
ambition to go on the stage. I was study
ing singing when in college, and only the
fact tfaat my first job was in a legiti
mate play determined that I would not
do muMcal comedy work.
"Yes, I started right for New York
when I finished college—just like 'Mer
ton'. Only had a few hundred dollars
■and no job in sight But inside of three
weeks I landed orte."
Mr. Brokaw has done a number of i
prominent parts in New York, and has j
even had a flyer in motion pictures. He
was one of the Paramount junior stars
—attending the training school that grad
uated Buddy Rogers. Now that he is
out here on the Coast he is interested in
talking pictures, and it is possible that
he will join the Hollywood colony.
"Just now I can't decide whether I
should go on back to New York where
all ray theatrical connections are, or
whether to stay out here. I expect to be
in another play for the next few months,
anyway. The purchasers of 'The Squall'
are considering 'The Front Page' and
Belle,' and I shall probably have a
lead>4* whichever they select."
Interesting, but uncertain, is the way
Mr. Brokaw describes his profession. His
success ought to interest other college
students who have similar longings, for
tie proves that a university education is
one step to theatrical fame.
