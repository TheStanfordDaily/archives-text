# POSSIBILITIES OF '29 VARSITY NOT EQUAL TO 1928
## Eighteen on Stanford Team Graduate; Twenty-Eight Return Next Year 
### 
The possibilities of the 1929 varsity do
not look as promising as the present team
looked at the same time last year; in fact
Warner's men will have to get all the
luck and breaks next year to even have
a crack at the championship. The first
string looks fairly well, but the chief
trouble appears to lie in the matter of
experienced reserves. Only twenty-eight
of the men on the present varsity squad
will return, and many of these have had
little or no experience in the game this
year. Warner's strong reserves, so long
a big factor in previous seasons, seem
weak. In past years "Pop" has been able
to rely on almost unlimited reserves,
especially on the ends and in the back
fields; now there are but four experi
enced ends and only six or seven backs.
Eighteen Leave Varsity
The two great guards, Post and Ro
besky will be gone. Sellman plays his
last coast conference game tomorrow.
Worden, Harder, and Davidson will be
the missing ends. Halfbacks Wilton,
Sims, and Lewis are playing their last
year in addition to Captain Hoffman,
potential All-American fullback. In ad
dition to these men, Cook, Vermilya,
Wilson, Ingram, Doyle, and Snyder in
the line, and Crary and Reise in the back
field will also be gone.
Present varsity men on whom Warner
will build the 1929 varsity include:
Heinecke and Mann, centers; Driscoll,
Forster, Heiser, Hamilton, and Bardin,
guards; Artman, Tandy, Steinbeck,
Thompson, Klabau, and Burke, tackles;
Muller, Preston, Bush, and K. Albertson,
ends; Fleishhacker, Smalling, and Reh
rig, quarterbacks; Frentrup, Clark, Hill
man, Marks, Winnek, Murphy, and Way
man, halves; and Simkins and Rothert,
fullbacks.
Supply from Goofs, 1932
There will also be practically all of
the men on the present Goof and Lresh
man teams for "Pop" to draw from.
Mo flit, halfback, and M. Albertson, cen
ter of the Goofs, seem, at present, the
most outstanding men. The whole Gray
line shows promising possibilities and
this is where most of the reserve ma
terial is needed. Rintala, speedy half,
and Allen, fullback, are the two best
bets for varsity material from the fresh
men. Taylor, who was unable to report
for football this fall due to injuries,
may see action at either a fullback or
end positions.
Taking all in all, the lineup for next
year will probably be: Heinecke, c;
Driscoll and Forster, g; Artman and
Tandy, t; Muller and Preston, e; Fleish
hacker, q; Frentrup and Clark, h; and
Simkins, 112.
