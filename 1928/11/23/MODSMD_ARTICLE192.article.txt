BERKELEY, Nov. 22 (IMP)â€”Pro
fessional gambling on the California-
Stanford Game has stirred the police of
San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley
into action in a drive to wipe out gam
bling houses and betting commissioners
suspected of breaking state gambling
laws.
Every suspected gambling house in San
Francisco was placed under surveillance
Saturday and will be closely watched to
prevent professional gamblers from
"cleaning up" on the coming game.
