# BEARS WILL END YEAR WITH BEST RECORD SINCE '24
## 
### 
Whatever the result of the Big Game,
tomorrow will see the completion of the
i most successful season California has en
joyed since its tie for first place with
Stanford in 1924. For the first time since
that year, California will enter the Big
Game undefeated by a collegiate team.
The defensive power of Coach Price's
aggregation is attested by the fact that
only the undefeated Olympic Club has
succeeded in crossing its goal line, the
only other score made during the sea
son by an opposing team being a field
goal by Washington State.
I California began its conference season
'by defeating the strong Washington
State team 13 to 3, after Santa Clara
and the ever dangerous St. Marys has
been beaten in pre-season games.
Entering the Trojan game de
cidedly the underdogs, the Bears suc
ceeded in gaining a scoreless tie after
the Trojans had been kept from within
twenty yards of the goal line by the kick
ing of Benny Lom and the ability of
the line at hold at the cruical moments.
The Olympic Club succeeded in ad
ministering the only defeat of the sea
son in the game which was opened by
Kacr's run of 67 yards to a touchdown.
It is only fair to point out that many
of the varsity were not allowed to play
in the Winged-O game, as Price was re
serving his strength for the impending
struggle with Oregon, in which game
California again held a strong opponent
so that it never made a serious threat
to score.
Handicapped by the necessity of playing
in the rain or mud, and by the absence of
Lom, the Bears beat Washington by the
narrow margin of one touchdown, which
was made only after the completion of
two wild passes to Lee, in the last quar
ter. The generalship and playing of Lee
Eisan were a deciding factor in the
game.
Last Saturday, the California second
team routed Nevada at the rate of a
point a minute, piling up a total of
60 to 0.
The Stanford-California game, then
will either give the Conference cham
pionship to U.S.C., leaving Stanford in
second place, or it will leave U.C. and
the Trojans tied for first place.
