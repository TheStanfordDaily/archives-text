Stanford's "premature conflagra
tion," which burned the freshman
pyre to the ground two days ago, calls
to inind an incident that occurred
about fifteen years ago one of the
most desperate fights to guard the
bonfire.
Barricades of great strength and
efficiency were placed across the
bridge of San Fruncisquito Creek on
the highway, and all machines were
inspected and searched before being
allowed to pass into Santa Clara
county. All went well with the frosh
guardsmen until a machine load of
U.C. students arrived at the barri
cade.
Upon being challenged, the Berke
ley men reacted in various ways—
one of the most effective being the
violent hurling of an immense jug
(containing gasoline—the purpose of
which is inconceivable) at an unsus
pecting freshman. In other words —
one down!
When the incapacitated one had
been revived by his fellow students,
the U.C. men had turned and fled.
Then followed a desperate chase
from the bridge as far as Redwood
City, where the fugitives took to the
marshes. And "through the black of
night" the pursuit continued with
much muddiness and wetness until
the visitors were lost in the swamp—
that is, lost to the guardians of the
bonfire. They were never appre
hended, but they never succeeded in
using their gasoline as previously
planned.
