### 
ELYRIA, Ohio, Nov. 22. (I.P.)â€”Foot
ball coaches throughout the United States
| are joining with Coach Bill Roper, of
Princeton, in a campaign to put an end
to cigarette companies advertising their
brands through recommendations from
football players and coaches.
Roper wrote a letter to all grid coaches
in the country, which reads as follows:
The Lucky Strike Cigarette Company
has been conducting an active advertising
campaign through signed endorsements of
their products by numerous professional
baseball, golf and other athletes. These
have been appearing conspicuously in
magazines and on billboards.
"I have noticed with real concern, in
the past few weeks, a leading football
coach in the East, and several players
prominent in football during their under
graduate days, have been lending the use
of their names in this campaign. In my
opinion, the endorsement of any cigarette
by anyone connnected with football is
distinctly harmful to the best interests of
the game. As coaches we again and again
stated that no one could hope to play
football, even moderately well, who did
not keep his body in good condition.
"I believe cigarette smoking distinctly
harmful to any boy or girl under 21 years
of age. No one on my football squad
is permitted to touch a cigarette during
the season.
"Under all those circumstances, in my
opinion, it comes with particularly bad
grace for any football coach to advertise
or endorse cigarette smoking. . .
