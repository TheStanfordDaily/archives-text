SACRAMENTO, Nov. 22. (JP)—Bills,
bills, bills.
It's worse than any flrst-of-the
month at headquarters of the state
legislative counsel bureau, Fred
Wood, head of the bureau, said today.
The biennial rush of bills, each of
which must pass through the bureau,
is under way.
Seventy-five of them already, and
more to come. Chief among them is
a bill to repeal California's "gin mar
riage" law, said by justices and many
ministers to have failed of its object,
and to have cost the state many thou
sands of dollars in license fees spent
in other states, principally at that
hybrid spot where aspirants and
Protestants alike foregather to ac
quire and disown the bonds of matri
mony—Reno, Nevada.
