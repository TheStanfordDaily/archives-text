# Food Research Institute To Publish Wheat Studies
## 
### 
According to advance plans, the
current volume of Wheat Studies,
compiled by the Food Research Insti
tute, is to contain, in addition to the
usual review and survey issues,
studies dealing with the place of
wheat in the diet; the forecasting of
wheat yields from the weather; some
important region—Australia, Russia,
or the Danube basin —as a producer
and exporter of wheat; wheat exports
from the Pacific Coast; and millfeed
prices.
In vie wof the present disturbances
in the wheat market Wheat Studies
bhould be of particular interest this
year.
On the merits of these works the
Chicago Journal of Commerce says
they are "the most complete and au
thoritative studies of the wheat situa
tion ever compiled."
