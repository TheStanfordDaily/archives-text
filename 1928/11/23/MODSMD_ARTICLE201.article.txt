# FORMER CARDINAL COXSWAIN TELLS OF ROWING DAYS
## Starts as Intercollegiate Sport On Coast in '04 With U.C.-Card Race 
### JOHN ISAACS 
"Rowing as an intercollegiate sport,
when properly conducted, offers less
chance for either temporary or perma
nent injury to participants than football,"
declared Frank L. Guerena, '12, in an
interview given the Daily yesterday.
Guerena served four years as varsity
coxswain and then later three years more
as Stanford crew coach. He is now
Deputy United States Attorney in San
Francisco and a member of the Stanford
Board of Athletic Control.
"Is there any possibility of the re
establishing of crew as a sport at Stan
ford?" Guerena was asked.
"That depends entirely upon the atti
tude of the student-body," he replied.
If there is a great deal of popular favor
among the students themselves, for the
return of rowing at Stanford, it is very
likely that the Board of Athletic Con
trol will support the action.
Started in 1904
"Rowing started as an intercollegiate
sport on the Pacific Coast in 1904 when
both Stanford and California turned out
crews," continued Guerena. "Four
oared shells were used for that first big
regatta. California won in 1904 and
again in 1905. But the Cardinal crew
plugged on and won the next race which
was the first eight-oared competition.
Stanford and California crews met again
on twelve occasions and Stanford
emerged victorious eight tins.
"The first paid coach was Dan Mur
phy, a professional of the old school.
He did not take charge until 1906. Be
fore that time the men coached them
selves. Murphy sent two crews against
the Blue and Gold, and won both times.
"After the 1909 season, rowing was
abolished at both Stanford and Califor
nia. It was said that the training was
too rigorous and injured the health of
the competing men. Immediately the
Cardinal crew organized the Lagunita
Boating Club. The Berkeley men banded
together in a similar organization and
thus the annual regatta was carried on.
A paid coach was dispensed with and a
a committee composed of the coxswain,
captain, and stroke served in this capa
city. The 1910 season was such a suc
cess that the sport was reinstated in both
the schools.
Triangular Meet Held
"Washington joined California and
Stanford in 1912, making the regatta a
triangular race. In 1912 Stanford sent
her first crew to Poughkeepsie. This was
the first western cruw to go east. After
winning easily over two western rivals,
Stanford went east to finish a bad last.
"As a result of the eastern trip, Stan
ford adopted a more scientific style and
went to Poughkeepsie again in 1915. This
time the Cardinals missed winning the
regatta by but eight feet.
"The war seriously hurt Stanford row
ing. The teams, though, fighting to the
last, began to decline, and at the close
of the 1920 season, the sport was sus
pended. This was chiefly due to a lack
of funds and proper facilities.
"Stanford oarsmen were always han
dicapped by the poorest of facilities. The
old Redwood boathouse was located on
a slough two and a half miles back of
the open water of the bay. Frequently
the crew could not get on water because
of low tide, or would return from a long
row to find the tide out and thus be
forced to wait out in the bay several
hours until the water returned into the
channel.

"There was but one coach, and no
trainer or rigger. The boathouse was
nothing but a barn without even running
water. The men used to shower in a
barrel with a sponge. Transportation
was not as easy ten years ago as it is
now and much valuable time was lost
traveling.
"California has been handicapped by
the same difficulties that hampered Stan
ford. Since their victories last summer,
there is no doubt that the Bear eight will
I rcceive better facilities in the future,
j Eastern crews maintain a large coaching
i and training personnel as well as a skill-
I ed staff of riggers."
