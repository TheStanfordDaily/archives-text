# CARD ASSISTANTS WERE ONE-TIME WARNER PUPILS
## 
### 
While coaching at Pittsburgh, Glenn
Warner developed two men who now
have much to do with the proper func
tioning of Stanford's "Big Red Ma
chine" : Tiny Thornhill, line coach, and
Chuck Winterburn, backfield coach. Both
these men were selected by Walter Camp
as members of the all-American eleven.
Thornhill, who graduated from Pitts
burgh in 1916, had played varsity tackle
all three years of college competition.
Upon graduation he became coach at
Center College. Stanford adopted the
Warner system under Andy Kerr in 1922,
and Thornhill was appointed line coach
at that time.
Winterburn played at either half back
or quarterback position. He followed
Warner to the Pacific Coast immediately
after graduation, and coached at Santa
Ana High School his first season, and
at San Mateo Junior College the next.
He came to Stanford in 1925.
Ed Walker and Ernie Nevers, both
members of the Warner's Stanford
teams, have returned to their Alma Mater
as members of the coaching staff. Walker
has directed the activities of the Stanford
greys and Nevers has assisted "Husky"
Hunt with the freshmen.
Trainer Wallace Denny, the man en
trusted with the physical well-being of
the cardinal varsities, is a full-blooded
Oneida Indian. Denny first met "Pop"
while a student at Carlisle where he was
prominent in all branches of athletics.
He has served as trainer under Warner
ever since graduation more than a quar
ter of a century ago.
