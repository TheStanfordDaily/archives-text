# HISTORY OF AXE DATES BACK TO 1898
## Stanford Weapon Taken From Bearer Following Baseball Game in San Francisco; Kept in Bank Vault 
### 
That was the cry of 2,000 rooters at
the Big Game rally when a duplicate of
the old Stanford axe was exhibited Wed
nesday night.
Thirty years ago, in 1898, a similar
scene was enacted at a slightly smaller
but equally vociferous Big Game rally
when the original Stanford axe expe
rienced its first Big Game thrill. Today
that same axe, tarnished from lack of
use, lies in a government protected vault
in a Berkeley bank.
The mighty Stanford weapon came into
the hands of the California horde in the
following manner: The opening game of
the Stanford-California baseball series of
1899 was played on the old Haight street
grounds, located near Market in what is
now the heart of San Francisco's busi
ness center.
Axe Honored
On that occasion the axe occupied a
position of honor in the Stanford rooting
section, where it excited the envy and
jealousy of the Golden Bear cohorts. For
some reason no guard was provided for
gleaming instrument. It was intrusted
to one man, E. A. Stout, who is now
manager of the San Francisco Mines of
Mexico, Ltd. As Stout was going down
a side street after the game he was
overpowered by a group of California
students and the axe was taken away.
The Berkeleyites celebrated the capture
of the axe in gigantic style, holding a

banquet and rally at a leading San Fran
cisco hotel the same night. Fearful the
prize would be regained by its rightful
owners, the thieves had it locked in a
vault and they did not even bring it from
its hiding place for many years. They
finally became brave enough to remove
it for tig Big Game rally under a guard
of the entire freshman class. Following
the exhibit the rusty tool was hurriedly
returned to the vault.
Reward Offered
Stanford alumni offered a reward of
$10,000 for any undergraduate who would
regain the weapon, but the years slipped
by without anyone divising a way of at
tack. The reward still stands but the
identity of thg persons who offered it is
forgotten.
In 1922 the old symbol was reborn. At
the Big Game rally of that year the
gleaming red broad-axe, that was shown
Wednesday night, was brought out. This
axe has more history behind it than the
original weapon. It was found in Bret
Harte county by J. E. Peterson, a resi
dent of Palo Alto, who has been con
nected with the University for many
years. In all probability it was wielded
by some old pioneer. It is now under
the guardianship of the Scalpers Society.
At the time of the Big Meet last
spring, a group attempted to recapture
the axe which was exhibited at the rally.
Because of lack of co-operation the at
tack failed.

Reward Offered
Stanford alumni offered a reward of
$10,000 for any undergraduate who would
regain the weapon, but the years slipped
by without anyone divising a way of at
tack. The reward still stands but the
identity of thg persons who offered it is
forgotten.
In 1922 the old symbol was reborn. At
the Big Game rally of that year the
gleaming red broad-axe, that was shown
Wednesday night, was brought out. This
axe has more history behind it than the
original weapon. It was found in Bret
Harte county by J. E. Peterson, a resi
dent of Palo Alto, who has been con
nected with the University for many
years. In all probability it was wielded
by some old pioneer. It is now under
the guardianship of the Scalpers Society.
At the time of the Big Meet last
spring, a group attempted to recapture
the axe which was exhibited at the rally.
Because of lack of co-operation the at
tack failed.
That was the cry of 2,000 rooters at
the Big Game rally when a duplicate of
the old Stanford axe was exhibited Wed
nesday night.
Thirty years ago, in 1898, a similar
scene was enacted at a slightly smaller
but equally vociferous Big Game rally
when the original Stanford axe expe
rienced its first Big Game thrill. Today
that same axe, tarnished from lack of
use, lies in a government protected vault
in a Berkeley bank.
The mighty Stanford weapon came into
the hands of the California horde in the
following manner: The opening game of
the Stanford-California baseball series of
1899 was played on the old Haight street
grounds, located near Market in what is
now the heart of San Francisco's busi
ness center.
Axe Honored
On that occasion the axe occupied a
position of honor in the Stanford rooting
section, where it excited the envy and
jealousy of the Golden Bear cohorts. For
some reason no guard was provided for
gleaming instrument. It was intrusted
to one man, E. A. Stout, who is now
manager of the San Francisco Mines of
Mexico, Ltd. As Stout was going down
a side street after the game he was
overpowered by a group of California
students and the axe was taken away.
The Berkeleyites celebrated the capture
of the axe in gigantic style, holding a

banquet and rally at a leading San Fran
cisco hotel the same night. Fearful the
prize would be regained by its rightful
owners, the thieves had it locked in a
vault and they did not even bring it from
its hiding place for many years. They
finally became brave enough to remove
it for tig Big Game rally under a guard
of the entire freshman class. Following
the exhibit the rusty tool was hurriedly
returned to the vault.
