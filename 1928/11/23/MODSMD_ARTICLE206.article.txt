# TOMORROWS TILT WILL BE PRICE'S THIRD BIG GAME
## 
### 
Nibs Price, diminutive California men
tor, enters his third Big Game as head
coach of the Bears with the most power
ful team that has represented the Berk
eley institution since the days of the fa
mous "Wonder" teams. By many critics,
the present team is very favorably com
pared to the great teams of 1920-21, and
not without reason, for no college team
has this year crossed the California goal
line.
Price is a thoroughbred California man,
graduating from that institution in 1914.
WTiile in the university, he starred in
basketball, baseball, and rugby football,
and after his graduation attained great
success as football coach at San Diego
High School. Attracted by his showing
there, California made Price freshman
coach in 1919, and in 1920 promoted him
to the position of chief assistant to Andy
Smith.
Price's versatility as a coach is shown
by his success in developing basketball
teams. After his appointment as basket
ball coach in 1925, California won three
consecutive Pacific Coast Conference bas
ketball championships, and a tie with
U.S.C. last year in the percentage col
umn. However, U. S. C. was given the
right to play Washington for the Con
ference title by virtue of an early season
win over California.

Price took over the coaching job at
Berkeley on the death of Andy Smith
in 1926. That year the team was in a
bad slump, failing to win a single con
ference contest. The next year, Cali
fornia won two and lost three conference
games.
This year, with a record of no confer
ence defeats and a. tie with U.S.C., the
Bears stand as testimony to the prowess
of their coach.
