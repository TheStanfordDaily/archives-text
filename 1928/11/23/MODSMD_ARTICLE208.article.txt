# GORDON OFFERS VIEWS ON POLO SITUATION HERE

"Before the varsity polo team can
have any outside competition, remount
horse 6 must be trained into shape," said
Captain Richard A. Gordon in discus
sing the polo situation for the season.
"We have only enough animals to
mount our own team, and it would be
impossible to meet a visiting squad and
furnish them horses. New ones must be
trained, and the process takes a long j
time. We have just condemned two of
our old horses, and are considerably be
low the number which we need."
There are twelve men turning out with
the varsity, and a few more than that
on the "B" squad. The number may be
increased in the spring when freshman
material is called for. At present, prac
tice is being held on the Encina polo
field. The ground has just been dragged,
and with the moisture of the last rains
still in the soil, it is in the best possible
condition. Work in training the re
mounts is done in the riding hall with
practice balls.
"Practice has been quite satisfactory so
far," said Gordon. "In the riding hall we
take it rather slowly so as to break in
the new ponies to the game without get
ting them too excited and spoiling their
control permanently. Any games that we
may play this fall will be with pre-de
termined teams for at least three chuk
kers will be against a composite squad
of players who can give our varsity some
stiff competition, and who will be
mounted on their own animals."
The varsity field, next to the highway,
has grown a pretty good turf, but can
not be played on yet. It is soft from the
rains and would be cut to pieces in a few
chukkers. Besides the riding hall, team
members have two wooden horses to
practice on, but further developments are
hindered by lack of funds.
