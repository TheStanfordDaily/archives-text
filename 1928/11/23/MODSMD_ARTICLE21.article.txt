â€”As a definite step toward the realiza
tion of an all-religion building on the
new Westwood campus, plans were ap
proved at the meeting of the Committee

Under the committee program, each
religious group on the campus will be
under the supervision of its own leader,
but all groups will be housed in the
same building. Not less than one re

250 students.
