# SWIMMING TEAM READY FOR P.A.A. TITLE MATCHES
## Harrison, Driggs, Cundall Are Expected to Star Again This Year 
### 
P.A.A. championship contests are the
main items of to tfre swimming
team during fall quarter, as the regular
water-polo and swimming meets do not
come until winter and spring.
Card mermen have done pretty well
so far, having taken three places in
P. A. A. races since September. Ogden
Driggs has taken a first, Bill Cundall a
second, and "Bobo" Brown a third.
Summary Given
A summary of this year's varsity ma
terial, by acting coach Ted Smith, has
a .very promising outlook.
"Middle-distance races are well taken
care of. Ogden Driggs is the veteran
• mainstay, and the coming star seems to
be Brown, who has done good work both
in competition and in practice. These
men also swim the backstroke.
"Hadley Bramel has made as good
time as any of the team members in
middle-distance events, and will be a
winner this year if he hits his stride in
competition.
Much New Material
"Reggie Harrison is the best sprinter
on the He lias had. several years'
experience and can be counted on for a
good, fast race at any time. There is a
wealth of new material- to draw from in
the century; Thomas, Lucy, Tanzer, and
Morey are all fast performers who are
exported to develop speed this season.
"In the brcaststroke race two very de
4H-ndable performers have been developed i
'Whitey' Burns and Bill Cundall. Burns, i
•who is now a sophomore, swam well j
enough to be just barely nosed out of
third place for the 440-yard brcaststroke
contest in the national championship meet
Jield at San Francisco last year."
Champion Divers
In the diving events Stanford has been
fortunate in having men of world re
nown. Since 1920 the Farm has been
known in many far-off corners of the
world only because of what her divers
have done in international competition.
For the past three Olympic Games, L. S.
J.U. holds the record for world diving
championships, and her fame has spread
accordingly.
Fete Desjardines, '31, this summer re
peated the performance of another Stan
ford man, A 1 White, by winning both
.first placcs in diving at the Olympics,
taking ten points for the American team.
Either Herb Marsh or Ed Throndson
paired with Desjardins would make a
team good for a first and second place
against any college in the country, de
clare diving experts. Both are perform
ers of exceptional ability, and will im
prove as they gain experience in compc- j
tition.
