It was thirty-seven years ago that Pop
Warner saw his first game of football,
played at Ithaca, New York, in 1891.
He played in that game, too, and aided
his Cornell teammates to overwhelm
Syracuse 58-0. Pop played at Cornell
for four years and was honored by being
chosen on one of the first mythical Ail-
American teams ever selected. During
his last year he captained the Cornell
eleven.
Following his graduation, Pop went to
Ames, lowa, as coach of the lowa State
varsity and remained there for one year.
During the short time he was there he
developed one of the most powerful
teams in the Middle West that year, a
team which astonished the football pub
lic by swamping the Northwestern Uni
versity gridsters 36 to 0. The Chicago
Tribune of September 29, 1895, in dis
cussing this game, declared: "North
western might as well have tried to play
football with an lowa cyclone as with
the lowa team it met yesterday."
From lowa State Pop returned to
Cornell, going to Carlisle to coach the
Indians some time later. It was with
the Indians that Pop gained fame as a
coach, and the many great teams he de
veloped there are famous in football his
tory. It was Pop who coached the "one
and only" Jim Thorpe at Carlisle.
Pop went to the University of Pitts
burgh from Carlisle and was head coach
there during six victorious years before
coming to Stanford in 1924.
