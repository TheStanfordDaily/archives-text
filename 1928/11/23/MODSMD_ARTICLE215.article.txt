# FIRST CARD-BEAR CLASSIC LACKED POMP, CEREMONY, BUT NOT RIVALRY
## 
### 
Thirty-four years ago, five thousand
people witnessed the first Big Game be
tween Stanford and California. The af
fair took place at the old Haight street
Recreation Park in San Francisco. There
was very little pomp and ceremony, and
practically no organization, yet the con
test did not lack the traditional spirit,
noise, enthusiasm, and intense rivalry
which now characterizes the present
Card-Bear classic.
There was a great amount of hesita
tion in Roble Hall as to the propriety of
the women to attend the game. Finally
the women students of California fav
ored the idea and Ruble soon followed.
California entered the game a 3 to 1
favorite over Stanford. Neither had the
tutelage of an eastern coach. The cap
tain was the sole director of the team,
and the manager was usually a member
of the eleven. The only coaching the
first Stanford team had received was
the services offered gratis by various men
interested in the game. On the other
hand California had been playing the
game for ten years and was well ex
perienced. Both teams, however, had
little cleverness and strategy and relied
mainly on "brawn, strength, and will."
Before the second Big Game, Stanford
secured Walter Camp as eoaeh.
The old V-shape formation of flying
wedge was the forte of both teams al
though open field running was also pres
ent. Clemens, Stanford fullback, scored
the first Big Game touchdown on a thirty

yard run about the middle of the first
half. The betting odds on the sidelines
California to 2to 1 oh Stanford. Clem
ans followed this up with a second score
a few minutes later by a thrilling run
in which he left his interference, dodged
his tackier?, and crossed the goal line.
Ten minutes later Wittimore made the
third Stanford touchdown by ยง long run
along the side lines. The half ended
14-0 in favor of the Cardinals.
In the second half the heavier and
more powerful California team battered
its way through the Stanford wedge to
two touchdowns but lacked the punch to
make another and the first Big Game
passed into history with an unexpected
Stanford victory of 14-10.
After the game the Stanford crowd
started the custom of buying out the
Stockwell theater to wind up the me
morable day. The California support
ers did the same, but to prevent serious
difficulties, they bought out a different
theater.
The second Big Game on December 17
of the same year bad a crowd of 8,000.
It ended in a tie with Stanford still re
taining the championship.
People were aghast in 1894 when 10,-
000 saw the Big Game and wondered
what the world was coming to because j
the gate receipts exceeded several thou
sand dollars. Compare that with the 80,-
000 crowd at the present Blue and Gold-
Cardinal classic and the some $400,000
in gate receipts. Yes, times have changed.
