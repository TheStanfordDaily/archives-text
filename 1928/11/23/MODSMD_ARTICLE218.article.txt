# Varsity, Frosh Golfers Given Stiff Workouts For Approaching Meets
## 
### 
Playing one practice match so far this
quarter, the Stanford golf team has spent
most of its time preparing for the inter
collegiate competition which comes next
quarter.
The Stanford freshmen have played no
matches as yet this year but indications
are that Harry Eichelberger, Norman
Macbeth, Richard Thompson, and Jef
ferson Stephens will be the Rabcs' best
players. Eichelberger is Southern Cali
fornia Junior champion and was runner
up in the state junior play. Macbeth
was formerly Southern California junior
champion. Stephen is San Luis Obispo
county champion.
