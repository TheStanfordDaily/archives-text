# TOMORROW'S TILT WILL DECIDE GRID TITLE ON COAST
## 
### 
With five games of Pacific Coast con
ference competition yet to be played. S.C.
and the University of California are tied
with no defeats and one tie. Next in
line for coast honors is Stanford who
has suffered one defeat at the hands of
the S.C. eleven.
Tomorrow the Stanford-California
battle will be in the limelight of the na
tion. Stanford has won the last three
Big Games and now California goes into
the contest with the best chance of a
victory since Andy Smith's Wonder
teams. California has the record of nut
having her goal line crossed once by a
college team. Stanford has been scored
upon many times but in the meantime
has run up mighty scores against her
opponents.
S. C. Meets Vandals
In the South, Idaho meets a weakened
S.C. eleven in another important tussle.
The Vandals have a heavy team but they
have been beaten by the more powerful
conference teams this year. Should an
upset take place either Stanford or Cali
fornia would take the coast honors, de
pending upon the outcome of the Big
Game.
Oregon will meet Montana in the final
conference game for tomorrow. Both
teams are out of the championship run
ning but a close game is expected. Judg
ing from previous records the Oregon
team is favored to win.
Husky, Cougar Game
On Thanksgiving Washington meets
Washington State in the "Big Game" of
the North. Both teams have strong
records but the comeback of the Huskies
in the last three games make them the
favorite to continue the winning streak.
In the final game U.C.L.A. will battle
Oregon in Los Angeles on Thanksgiving.
The southern university has not won a
conference game this year and should
prove to be no obstacle for the Oregon
eleven.
