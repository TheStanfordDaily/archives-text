"The Stanford team has thus far
not come up to the expectations of
the coaching staff and the team's
supporters. It has played some
good football and at times has
shown great strength, but at other
times it has shown a surprising
lack of finish and strength.
"On the other hand, California
has shown considerable improve
ment right through the season and
followers of the Bears are justi
fied in looking forward to a Cali
fornia victory.
"I regard Stanford's chance as
not quite as good as their oppo
nents'. Certainly the Stanford team
will have to play much better than
it has in the last two games if a
defeat is to be averted."—Pop.
