MELBOURNE, Australia, Nov. 22.
(JP) â€”A boarding house in South Mel
bourne was bombed today, the seventh
outrage of the kind that has taken place
in recent weeks. One man was injured
and several residents had narrow escapes.
The newspapers have published de
mands that the police throw their whole
resources against the bomb throwers.
The new premier of the state. Sir \\ ii
liam McPherson, made one of the gov
ernment's chief policies the suppression of
these outrages which began during the
recent strike of Waterside Workers and
are attributed by the police to communist
elements.
