MILAN, Italy, November 22. (JP)â€”
Premier Mussolini's own newspaper,
Popolo D'ltalia, has fallen afoul of
censorship.
The paper's late city edition was
"sequestered" by the Prefect of Milan
because it contained a crime story a
little too dark in character and there
fore contrary to directions that the
Premier had given the Fascist press.
