DELAWARE, Ohio, Nov. 22. (LP.)
—New bells —bigger and better —have
been installed in the corridors of the
women's domitory at the Ohio Wes
leyan University to arouse the sleepy
co-eds from their peaceful slumbers,
which have heretofore continued un
disturbed. A smaller number of 7:45
classes cut, and a larger attendance
at breakfast are the results hoped for.
