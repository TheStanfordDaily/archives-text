# BRAND DESCRIBES ORIENTAL RUGS IN TALK WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
"Western influence has driven the
art from the making of Oriental rugs,"
said Professor Carl F. Brand in his
informal talk at the Stanford Art Gal- j
lery Wednesday afternoon. "The
weavers are not interested in the rugs
they make for commercial consump
tion."
Brand described the bazaars of
Constantinople, where he purchased
his collection. He spoke of the socia
ble attitude of the merchants toward
prospective buyers, and the subse
quent bargaining and haggling. Some
times the deal is closed, and the
terms once decided on are never al
tered, and sometimes negotiations just
stop.
"The Weaver lias only three imple
ments," Brand continued, in telling
i how the rugs are made. "They are
j the loom, the knife, and the comb.
IA few threads are run across the
warp, and wound around two threads
of the warp. He carries the design in
his mind, weaving all the knots of the
same color at the same time. Girls,
their ages averaging about twelve
years, do the weaving. They can
weave sixty knots in one minute."
Brand went on to say that the early
history of rug weaving is obscure.
The oldest rug, found in northwestern
Persia in the fourteenth century, is so
perfected that the art must have cen
turies of development behind it. The
art. spread to China, and followed
Mohammedan progress into many
countries.
