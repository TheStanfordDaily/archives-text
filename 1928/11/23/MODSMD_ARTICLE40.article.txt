BERKELEY, Nov. 22. (P.1.P.) â€”
: Modern flappers with their short
i skirts, bobbed hair, and stockingless
! legs are no less modest than the
' more abundantly garbed damsel of a
i generation ago, according to Dr.
Edith Bryan of the U.C. department
of hygiene. "The girl who grows up
accustomed to short dress is not im
modest when she continues to wear
; them," said Dr. Bryan.
