WEST POINT, N.Y., Nov. 22.—
"Just before white-robed December
Strews her snowf lakes on the ground,
Towards the end of gray November,
Such a joyful time comes 'round."
Only this time it is the first tiny of
December, and it may not be such a joy
ful time after Jill, at least from the
Cadets' point of view. VY Wrt the Cardi
nals clash with Army at the Yankee Sta
dium, New York City, the season will
be climaxed for two of the greatest
teams in the country, each distinctly rep
resentative of its section. It should be
a great game, and West Point is laboring
under no illusions as to its certainty of
success against its western foe.
Texans Defeated
The Cadets have made the best of a
tough schedule. Turning back an early
threat by Southern Methodist University,
recognized as the leaders of the great
Southwest, and possessed of one of the
greatest passing teams in the history of
the game, Army strode on to conquer
Harvard and Yale on successive week
ends. Defeated by the Irish of Notre
Dame in a game to which experts agreed
one more minute might have written a
different ending. West Point refused to
be down hearted, and came back to
swamp Carleton College of Minnesota
32 to 7.
In addition, Boston University, Provi
dence College, and De Pauw University
have fallen before the attack of the Sol
diers this season. The struggle with the
mighty Nebraska machine on the plains
of West Point tomorrow will be a tough
one for both teams.
Cagle Shines
Whatever may happen to the Army at
tack, Cagle is still Cagle, and in that red
head lies an ever dangerous threat. Pass
ing, rurlning, kicking, blocking, tackling
—he is a man to be feared by the opposi
tion and admired by the Cadets. East
ern sports writers are unanimous in their
choice of him as an Ail-American, and

his showing against the Cardinals should
be equally impressing to Western news
papermen. His runs of 72 and 52 yards
for touchdowns against the Yale Bull
dogs will be long remembered by the big
Blue team. His hurling of scoring passes
is equally well known.
The Army back field is a well rounded
one, however, and though Chris Cagle is
its star, there are others of no mean abil
ity. Though the Cadets have no one to
match the redoubtable Bid Hoffman,
I they have in Hertz Murrel a fullback
J who will worry the Stanford line They
1 have in Charlie Allen and Richie O'Keefe
' two interfering backs of proven ability,
j and in Spike Nave a first-class quarter
back. Hutchinson, Piper, Bowman, Carl
son, Gibner and Timberlake are second
string hacks who have seen action in
nearly every game.
Sprague is Captain
In the line, Army's only big men are
Buster Perry and Bud Sprague, tackles.
Sprague is captain of the Cadet eleven
and is playing his last year for West
Point. The guard positions are regularly
filled by Hammack and Humber, though
Dibb has also played considerably. Bill
Hall fills the pivot, and Messinger and
Carlmark, both yearlings (sophomores
in civilian colleges) are the guardians of
the wings. Both have improved remark
ably this season, handicapped as they
were with the problem of filling the
shoes of Born and Harbold, rcgalars
who graduated last year. Major Sasse,
noted in the East as an "end builder,"
i raced a great problem in prcducing ends
| for this year, but his products have been
| giving a good account of themselves and
| should continue to do so.
The Corps and the team will entertain
|no overconlidence when they face the
j Stanford Cardinals next Saturday. They
realize that anything may happen in the
Yankee Stadium —as if the Notre Dame
game was the only reminder. They are
confident of making a fight winning or
losing, struggling to the last whistle to
down the western invaders.
