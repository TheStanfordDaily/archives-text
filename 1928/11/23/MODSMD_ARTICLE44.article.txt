# HABITS OF DOGS, BIRDS DISCUSSED BY ZOOLOGY CLUB
## 
### 
The intelligence of dogs and the mi
gration habits of birds were the two
subjects of informal talks given Wednes
day before the Zoology Club.
Editha Wright discussed the intelli
gence of dogs, with especial stress laid
on the ability to respond to verbal stimuli
and the capabilities of the German
shepherd dog, "Fellow." 1 his animal was
the subject of an exhaustive paper by
C. J. Warden and L. H. Warner and
was found to have a vocabulary equal
to that of the average six-year-old child.
"Fellow" is superior in intelligence to
the cat, and inferior to the monkey and
the racoon; and his senses of smell and
of sound are keener than those of man.
The literature of Wells W. Cooke on
the migration of birds was reviewed by
Philip Savage at the same meeting, and
it was pointed out that the ice age may
have been influential in the development
of migratory habits. Savage also noted
unusual phenomena in this field such as
the Arctic tern, which migrates from
the North Pole to the South, the Ameri
can golden plover, which flies a distance
of 2,000 miles, and the boblink, which
has been changing its annual route ever
since the coming of the white man to
the New World.
