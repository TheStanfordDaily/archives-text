## 
### 
BERLIN, Nov. 22 {IF). —The German
foreign office let it be known today tliat
negotiations for a reparations conference
between the Allies and this country had
not progressed beyond the stage of dip
lomatic conversations and informal mem
orandums.
No replies have been received from the
powers to whom on October 30 German
representatives abroad presented memor
anda giving Germany's views as to the
makeup of the committee of experts that
is to deal with the proposed revision of
the Dawes Plan. It was stated, however,
that both England and France had asked
certain special questions, chiefly concern
ing the powers of the experts in the pro
posed conference. These questions were
presented through conversations with the
German ambassadors in London and
Paris and were augmented by written
memoranda.
The memoranda are now being exam
ined by the German Foreign Office.
It has been reported that each of the
powers to whom Germany addressed its
communication—France, England, Italy,
Belgium and Japan—were trying to
frame identic responses. The Berlin
government, however, assumes that each
of these powers will reply independently.
