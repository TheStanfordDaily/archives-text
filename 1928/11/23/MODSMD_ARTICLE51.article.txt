# BOULDER DAM IS DISCUSSION TOPIC OF COOLIDGE, KING
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 The
Boulder Canyon Dam Bill and Philip
pine Independence were the subjects of
a conference today between President
Coolidge and Senator King, Democrat,
Utah.
The senator said he was particularly
interested in the engineers' report on the
Boulder Canyon proposition, but would
not reveal its nature. Although he op
poses the bill, he predicted that in "some
form or another" it will be passed at the
coming session of Congress. "The votes
are there," he said.
The senator has had a bill before Con
gress for some time which would grant
the Philippine Islands their independence
after they had held a constitutional con
vention. He said that he recommended
for the present that in addition to the
passage of this bill a treaty be negoti
ated with Japan and other powers influ
ential in the Orient under which the neu
trality of the Philippines would be guar
anteed.
