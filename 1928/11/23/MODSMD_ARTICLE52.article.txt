# BREAD MINUS BUTTER NOW MENU IN RUSSIA
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Nov. 22 (/P) â€”The way to
say it in Russia is not with flowers, but i
with butter. Flowers are plentiful and
butter is hard to get. This autumn it has
become a token. A pound of it is some
times presented as a gift when people j
call on kin or friends who are celebrat- |
ing the day of their patron saint.
For several weeks butter has been ra
tioned in Moscow, and elsewhere. Long
lines of women stand in front of the
shops every morning patiently waiting in
the cold to get inside and buy their share.
A little more than a third of a pound
is the limit fixed for each customer in
the government and co-operative shops.
