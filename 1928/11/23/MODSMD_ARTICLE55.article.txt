### 
PITTSBURGH, Pa., Nov. 22 (fP). —
America's coal supply has been extended
hundreds of years by the chemical and
mechanical wizardry which is making
one pound of coal do the work that re
quired two pounds a few years ago.
This was the report given to the second
International Conference on bituminous
coal today at Carnegie Institute of Tech
nology by F. G. Tryon, fuel economist,
United States Bureau of Mines, Wash
ington.
Ten years ago, Tryon said, it took 170
pounds of coal to do 1,000 gross ton
miles of work on railroads in the United
States. Today it requires 135 pounds of
coal to accomplish the same task and on
one railroad a locomotive does the same
work on 70 pounds of coal, he declared.
