### 
OREGON STATE COLEGE, Cor
vallis (PIP) â€”A revival of sportsmanlike
etiquette at athletic contests is being en
couraged here. Traditions and conduct of
students at games have been sadly ne
glected, is the belief and a reminder of
'this is one remedy, according to the yell
leading staff of the college.
It will now be the policy of students
to remain until the end of all contests
and sing the alma mater. All men stu
dents are urged to wear rooter's lids,
formerly left as an act of the freshman
class. Although all aspects of this prob
lem have not been discarded, the con
tinuance of acts such as cheering for a
rival who is injured or makes a good
play, cheering for the opposing team, and
abolishment of all cat-calls or booing,
is doubly encouraged.
