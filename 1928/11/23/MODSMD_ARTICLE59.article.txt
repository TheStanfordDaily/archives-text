# 50-MILE SPEED DECLARED SAFE FOR MOTORISTS
## 
### 
DETROIT, Nov. 22 (/P). â€”Although
nearitig the half century mark in age,
Col. J. G. Vincent, co-designer of the
Liberty airplane motor and now vice
president of engineering for the Packard
Motor Lar Company, thinks nothing of
driving an automobile at a ICC-milc-an
hour clip, but he believes that most peo
ple should not be allowed to drive more
than 50.
"There is some demand among motor
ists for very high speed, but most of
them want smooth, powerful, safe oper
ation at relatively moderate speeds,"
Colonel Vincent says. "We now have
automobiles capable of speeding along
over highways at 50 and 60 miles an
hour with more safety than we were as
sured a few years ago at 25 miles an
hour. Speed itself is not dangerous if
the car is Capable of being controlled by
the driver at all times, but when either
the car or the driver is not capable of
attaining high speeds with safety both
are a menace.
When friends ask him why he does
not leave these high speed tests for
younger men who are not acting in an
executive capacity, he explains that the
best way to solve an engineering problem
is first to understand the problem thor
oughly and have first-hand knowledge of
it.
Did Not Like Job
Twenty-five years ago, Colonel Vin
cent was poring over the ledgers of a St.
Louis commission company, trying to
leain bookkeeping. He did not like his
job.
In 1898, the year the first Packard was
built, he left bookkeeping and became a
machinist's apprentice. A few years
later found him devoting his inventive
genius to the building of adding ma
chines with Alvan Macauley, now presi
dent of the Packard Motor Company, as

j his chief. Colonel Vincent later became
chief engineer of Hudson Motor Car
Company, and in 1912 rejoined his old
: chief in the development of Packard.
Today, at 48, lie is vicc-presidcnt in
' charge of engineering.
Advises Drive Slowly
"Since man's vision and ability to re
i act quickly to situations which confront
him while driving are limited, 1 believe
I that we can hardly hope to develop au
j tomobilcs which the great masses of mo
| torists will be capable of driving with
safety at more than a 60-mile-an-hour
| gait. Most of them should not drive at
speeds above 50."
Although Colonel Vincent has very
definite notions about the average motor
ist's desires and capacity for high speeds,
j he often takes one of the cars which he
! is helping to perfect and puts it through
i several laps at 100 miles an hour on the
I two-mile Packard speedway just outside
J Detroit.
