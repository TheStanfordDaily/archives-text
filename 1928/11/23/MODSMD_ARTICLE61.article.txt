# Mellon Lifts Anti-Dumping Order Restricting German Importation of Pig Iron
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22
retary Mellon today lifted the aiuti
dumping order against pig iron from
Germany which has been in effect since
1926. This product may now be im
ported without restriction.
In 1926 the treasury conducted an in
vestigation into pig iron imports from
Germany after they had reached a maxi
mum of 160,000 tons. The restriction
was then placed on the imports which
were believed to be injuring the Ameri
can industry.
Under the tariff act of 1922 where
commodities are imported for sale at
less than in the country of origin the
treasury is empowered to assess duties
to protect the domestic industry.
