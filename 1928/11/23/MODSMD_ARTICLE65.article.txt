# It'll Be a Great Day, Mrs. Murphy

And it's with us again—the greatest clay of Stanford's year, the day
when Cardinal and Golden Bear settle their supremacy on the gridiron.
Yes, Stanford men and women remember Big Game time after other
undergraduate memories have faded in the mists of the past. To the
materialist it all seems foolish—the chaos, the feverish excitement, the
bonfire building, the cheers, the singing.
And it really is foolish, of course. But what glorious
foolishness! May Stanford's Sons and Daughters never
realize how foolish they are!
There is a spirit of grimness on the Farm today. A great Cardinal
team is to enter the field of battle tomorrow. But a great California
machine will be there too, desperate, fighting, determined that another
Stanford victory shall not come to pass. Stanford realizes this, and so
is grim.
Were this being written a week ago the theme would
have been an impassioned plea for bigger and better spirit.
But since that time several gallons of water have trickled
down the rain spout; a bonfire has been burned; a golden
letter in the Berkeley Hills has been painted; hundreds
of words have been utilized denouncing undergraduate leth
argy.
That is that —and enough.
If Stanford spirit is not what it should be after all these events,
nothing written here would have an effect. If Stanford's spirit is not
what it should be tomorrow, students in this University had best go in
for supporting women's hockey.
Likewise it is wasted space used to dope tomorrow's victor. Both
teams have been doped until they should be in a stupor. Both teams
jolted their respective adherents and proved that the dope bucket leaks
like a sieve—Stanford against Troy and California against the Husky
dog.
Here is a perfectly good dope sheet to be used for either
team. Fill in the blanks yourself. (It's better than across
word puzzle, only not as instructive.)
If shows the same power displayed against
, and does not play at top form
may be the winner of tomorrow's conflict, providing, of
/ course that , , , and
are in good shape. Coach would comment but
little on his team's chances yesterday, a fact which indi
'■'< cates he has some tricks up his sleeve. Considering this it
looks as if has a chance to trounce the... s
if the former succeeds in pushing over a few more touch
downs. But after all, football is an up and down sport, and
breaks may decide the battle.
. ; And so, boys and girls of radioland, you know as much now about it
as anyone else. Let's all guess.
Seriously, the conflict is going to be tense and hard. All Stanford
thinks the Cardinal will wave triumphantly tomorrow night, but fears
that it won't. The same psychology exists among the "dear enemy" at
Berkeley.
p Only two certainties arc really certain. There will be .some 80,000
sore throats after the game tomorrow and this same grand foolishness
is to be gone through again next year and for many more to come.
