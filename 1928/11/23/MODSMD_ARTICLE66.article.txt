After considerable delay, the Lit has apj>eared in a thoroughly red
cloak, making its bow to the present generation of thoughtful students
who hold enough interest in what takes place within college writers'
minds to subscribe for it. The search for profound thoughts is not
futile in this issue. A hasty perusal of the new foetus brings the eye to
Miss Olsen's essay on Women, wherein Miss Olsen, herself, (strangely
enough) a woman, hurls considerable invective against the members of
the female contingent for the fact that they continually clamor unin
telligently for a place of recognition which they would, if they had it,
find unbearable.
Woman will never be man's equal in business, the writer shows, be
cause of two reasons: one, she usually takes a job with the ultimate pur
pose of getting married, and is accordingly a poor one for her firm to
train for a responsible place. Two, she is vastly more inefficient than
man, spending her office time in petty intrigues and giving frequent ex
hibitions of jealousy and poor sportsmanship. She wants "to draw a
tftan's pay, but .... unquestioningly to be yielded a seat in the street-car
coming home from that work."
