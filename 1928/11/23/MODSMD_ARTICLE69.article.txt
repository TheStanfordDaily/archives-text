## WE ARE NOW QUITE CONVINCEDâ€”NO DOUBT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is our desire to correct a certain
miscellaneous idea which seems to be
in circulation due to the unfortunate
loss of a wallet on the hill locating
the big "C." It seems that a few peo
ple hastily jumped to the conclusion
that because one of our wallets was
found upon the hill we painted the
"C." These suspicious persons do us
a great wrong. Here is our story.
Immediately upon seeing our bon
fire go prematurely up in flame, we
were harrassed by the fear that some
certainly non-Stanford group, wrong
ly of course, attributing the bonfire
incident to the Gold and Blue, would
attempt to correct the color of the
big "C"; and so fearing that Stanford
would be suspected, we took it upon
ourselves to go over and do our best
to avert such an act of vandalism,

barbarity, and destruction.
But alas, after trekking up the hill
with the best of intentions, and with
a most sincere Stanford spirit, we
found the "C" red, so there was noth
ing for us to do but to return. And it
must have been while we were upon
the hill that our wallet was lost.
We are deeply hurt to think they
suspect us of such base actions, and
we want to state that it is our earnest
belief that no Stanford student would
have done such a thing.
P.S.: We don't wish to cast reflec
tions upon the negligence of the
sophomore big "C" committee as per
haps our actions in helping guard the
"C" might indicate, for we know that
that body always functions to the best
of its ability.
Also we want to extend our sincere
regret that such a dastardly act was
perpetrated.
