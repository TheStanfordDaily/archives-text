# HE SAYS: "TO HELL WITH THE GOLD AND BLUE"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Born and brought up in Berkeley
and an intensely partisan rooter for
California, I did not want to go to
Stanford. Force of circumstances de
creed that I come to Stanford at the
beginning of an Autumn Quarter, but
I fully intended to go to Cal at the
beginning of their next semester.
There was only one flaw; I came here
during a football quarter, and, al
though Stanford lost to Cal that year
and the next, and the next and the
next, I have as yet been unable to
leave here. While I lived in Berkeley
we always knew that the only way
that California could win from Stan
ford was for her to have a much bet
ter team. We knew that Stanford's
team would outfight Cal and the Stan
ford Rooters outyell us, and they did.

Pop's done all he can and he looks
damn blue. He knows that our team
is potentially able to win the game
but I think he knows that he alone
cannot put the Old Stanford Fight
in them.
There is only one way to win the
Big Game and that is to start ROAR
ING for victory when the team comes
on the field and keep roaring for it
for sixty minutes. Why in hell wasn't
the team given a cheer when they
came on the field last Saturday at the
beginning of the second half? Do we
have to wait for the yell leaders?
I wouldn't give a damn if they were
the rottenest bunch of players we
ever had —they are the Stanford Team
and I am going to back them every
minute of the game. To hell with the
Gold and Blue.
