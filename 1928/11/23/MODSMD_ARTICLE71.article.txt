# DEMANDING AN INVESTIGATION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir: Why not call it the
Stanford Daily Chameleon? After that
editorial apology to the Rally Committee
this would be nothing if not appropriate.
If the criticism that went a day ahead
of the retraction was garbled in tech
nicality it was right in spirit. The Rally
Committee has tried to dodge responsi
bility long enough.
Let us have an investigation. We want j
facts, not retractions, cries of "liar," un- ;
mitigated whisperings, and unparalleled
buck-passing.
The vandal(s) who touched off the

first bonfire must be found and punished.
This is not a cry for revenge, but a pro
test against the tendency to blush, shout
loudly, and drop the whole matter.
An investigation will certainly show
that the Rally Committee did NOT burn
the first wood pile. It should silence the
cynical, but it must also satisfy those
who are sick and tired of passing things
off with a sheepish laugh accompanied
by fireworks.
Every spree must have its morning
after. The students demand an investi
gation.
