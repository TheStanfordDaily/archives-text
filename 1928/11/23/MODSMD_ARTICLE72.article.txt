The Great Horn Spoon. By Eugene
Wright. (Indianapolis: Bobbs-
Merrill Company, 1928. $4.)
Are you another one of those pessi
mistic souls who has just about
given up hope of ever finding a travel
book that was really interesting, one
that you could read for itself alone,
and not merely for "cultural value"?
Draw near and take a new breath of
hope, for here's one that will hold
you open-mouthed to the last sen
tence.
Sit down in a cozy chair, take this
book in your hands, and then prepare
to spend an evening in an orgy of
action, excitement, and adventure
done by a young author who is an al
most fanatical devotee to beauty and
who revels in writing raw richness of
imagery.
The author seems to have been
literally inspired by a mad wander
lust. When most boys of his age were
still with their nurses, he was wan
dering along the Oakland waterfront,
talking with sailors, watching the
ships slide in through the Golden
Gate, roaming over the hills with a
big gun on his shoulder, spending
days alone far back in the mountains.
Before he was twenty-one —he is
not much more now —he had broken
with college, panned gold in the
Rockies, explored the deserts of Ari
zona, had been shipwrecked in a hur
ricane (coming from the West Indies).
But the greatest adventure of his
life, and the one about which this
book is written, began when he talked
himself into possession of a first-class
seaman's card and was given the job
of steering the S.S. Hyacinth out of
New York Harbor, bound for India,
Persia, Ceylon, Borneo, Arabia, Java,
and the Islands of the Arafura Sea.
When Talbot Mundy, the novelist of
India, finished reading "The Great
Horn Spoon," he telegraphed the fol
lowing words to the publishers: "I
don't know who this man is or where
lie is. I only know he should be
traveling in quest of more adventure.
This is a passionate book, drunk with
love of life and splendid with free
dom of spirit. The next best thing to
having lived and written such a saga
is to read it and have breath enough
remaining to gasp for more —more —
more!"
And so we join in and shout, "more
—more!"

A collection of short biographies,
literary portraits, and memoirs chosen
from the literatures of the Ancient

THEATRE ATTRACTIONS
IN SAN FRANCISCO
Stanford students who are not at
tending dinner parties right after the
Big Game will have a wide choice of
shows to attend. Following is a list of
the Saturday night attractions at tho
San Francisco theatres:
Curran —"The Desert Song," a thrill
ing operetta with three or four big
song-hits. Fine male chorus.
Geary—"The Squall," advertised as
the year's most daring play. Hot
tamale Spanish passion. Good cast
makes it plausible.
New Capitol—"Kongo," a drama of
jungle vengeance. Everyone in this
goes wrong to the tune of some fancy
cuss-words.
Alcazar—"ln Ixjve With Love," a
charming comedy starring Dale Win
ter and Henry Duffy. Hilarious.
President — "Mother's Millions,"
also a clever comedy. Stars May Rob
son, famous character actress, in a
role she has played for years.
Players' Guild —"Fallen Angels," a
highly sophisticated comedy co-star
ring two fine actresses, Charlotte
Walker and Sarah Padden.

book in your hands, and then prepare
to spend an evening in an orgy of
action, excitement, and adventure
done by a young author who is an al
most fanatical devotee to beauty and
who revels in writing raw richness of
imagery.
The author seems to have been
literally inspired by a mad wander
lust. When most boys of his age were
still with their nurses, he was wan
dering along the Oakland waterfront,
talking with sailors, watching the
ships slide in through the Golden
Gate, roaming over the hills with a
big gun on his shoulder, spending
days alone far back in the mountains.
Before he was twenty-one —he is
not much more now —he had broken
with college, panned gold in the
Rockies, explored the deserts of Ari
zona, had been shipwrecked in a hur
ricane (coming from the West Indies).
But the greatest adventure of his
life, and the one about which this
book is written, began when he talked
himself into possession of a first-class
seaman's card and was given the job
of steering the S.S. Hyacinth out of
New York Harbor, bound for India,
Persia, Ceylon, Borneo, Arabia, Java,
and the Islands of the Arafura Sea.
When Talbot Mundy, the novelist of
India, finished reading "The Great
Horn Spoon," he telegraphed the fol
lowing words to the publishers: "I
don't know who this man is or where
lie is. I only know he should be
traveling in quest of more adventure.
This is a passionate book, drunk with
love of life and splendid with free
dom of spirit. The next best thing to
having lived and written such a saga
is to read it and have breath enough
remaining to gasp for more —more —
more!"
And so we join in and shout, "more
—more!"

A collection of short biographies,
literary portraits, and memoirs chosen
from the literatures of the Ancient

THEATRE ATTRACTIONS
IN SAN FRANCISCO
Stanford students who are not at
tending dinner parties right after the
Big Game will have a wide choice of
shows to attend. Following is a list of
the Saturday night attractions at tho
San Francisco theatres:
Curran —"The Desert Song," a thrill
ing operetta with three or four big
song-hits. Fine male chorus.
Geary—"The Squall," advertised as
the year's most daring play. Hot
tamale Spanish passion. Good cast
makes it plausible.
New Capitol—"Kongo," a drama of
jungle vengeance. Everyone in this
goes wrong to the tune of some fancy
cuss-words.
Alcazar—"ln Ixjve With Love," a
charming comedy starring Dale Win
ter and Henry Duffy. Hilarious.
President — "Mother's Millions,"
also a clever comedy. Stars May Rob
son, famous character actress, in a
role she has played for years.
Players' Guild —"Fallen Angels," a
highly sophisticated comedy co-star
ring two fine actresses, Charlotte
Walker and Sarah Padden.

big gun on his shoulder, spending
days alone far back in the mountains.
Before he was twenty-one —he is
not much more now —he had broken
with college, panned gold in the
Rockies, explored the deserts of Ari
zona, had been shipwrecked in a hur
ricane (coming from the West Indies).
But the greatest adventure of his
life, and the one about which this
book is written, began when he talked
himself into possession of a first-class
seaman's card and was given the job
of steering the S.S. Hyacinth out of
New York Harbor, bound for India,
Persia, Ceylon, Borneo, Arabia, Java,
and the Islands of the Arafura Sea.
When Talbot Mundy, the novelist of
India, finished reading "The Great
Horn Spoon," he telegraphed the fol
lowing words to the publishers: "I
don't know who this man is or where
lie is. I only know he should be
traveling in quest of more adventure.
This is a passionate book, drunk with
love of life and splendid with free
dom of spirit. The next best thing to
having lived and written such a saga
is to read it and have breath enough
remaining to gasp for more —more —
more!"
And so we join in and shout, "more
—more!"

THEATRE ATTRACTIONS
IN SAN FRANCISCO
Stanford students who are not at
tending dinner parties right after the
Big Game will have a wide choice of
shows to attend. Following is a list of
the Saturday night attractions at tho
San Francisco theatres:
Curran —"The Desert Song," a thrill
ing operetta with three or four big
song-hits. Fine male chorus.
Geary—"The Squall," advertised as
the year's most daring play. Hot
tamale Spanish passion. Good cast
makes it plausible.
New Capitol—"Kongo," a drama of
jungle vengeance. Everyone in this
goes wrong to the tune of some fancy
cuss-words.
Alcazar—"ln Ixjve With Love," a
charming comedy starring Dale Win
ter and Henry Duffy. Hilarious.
President — "Mother's Millions,"
also a clever comedy. Stars May Rob
son, famous character actress, in a
role she has played for years.
Players' Guild —"Fallen Angels," a
highly sophisticated comedy co-star
ring two fine actresses, Charlotte

The Great Horn Spoon. By Eugene
Wright. (Indianapolis: Bobbs-
Merrill Company, 1928. $4.)
Are you another one of those pessi
mistic souls who has just about
given up hope of ever finding a travel
book that was really interesting, one
that you could read for itself alone,
and not merely for "cultural value"?
Draw near and take a new breath of
hope, for here's one that will hold
you open-mouthed to the last sen
tence.
Sit down in a cozy chair, take this
book in your hands, and then prepare
to spend an evening in an orgy of
action, excitement, and adventure
done by a young author who is an al
most fanatical devotee to beauty and
who revels in writing raw richness of
imagery.
The author seems to have been
literally inspired by a mad wander
lust. When most boys of his age were
still with their nurses, he was wan
dering along the Oakland waterfront,
talking with sailors, watching the
ships slide in through the Golden
Gate, roaming over the hills with a
big gun on his shoulder, spending
days alone far back in the mountains.
Before he was twenty-one —he is
not much more now —he had broken
with college, panned gold in the
Rockies, explored the deserts of Ari
zona, had been shipwrecked in a hur
ricane (coming from the West Indies).
But the greatest adventure of his
life, and the one about which this
book is written, began when he talked
himself into possession of a first-class
seaman's card and was given the job
of steering the S.S. Hyacinth out of
New York Harbor, bound for India,
Persia, Ceylon, Borneo, Arabia, Java,
and the Islands of the Arafura Sea.
