# Sam Pepys' Little Niece

November 22nd.
Past the Assembly Hall this late after
noon, and hearing curious noises did
stop to investigate, for I have heard so
many varsity-sixes in the last few days
that I did not know whether it was an
echo from the bonfire, or something else
being burned up; hut was agreeably sur
prised to discover a dress rehearsal of
tomorrow night's Gaieties, so did listen
until curious passersby abashed me with
their stares.
And so home to telephoning almost
everyone in the bawlout, not to mention
all the invalids I know, or have heard
of, trying to get a spare ticket for the
Big Game, for my uncle did wire me
excitedly last night that a business ac
quaintance of his was most anxious to
attend the festivities. But inasmuch as
the only ticket I have heard of unused is
up at the Daily California office, and
would require some difficult explana
tions to secure, and is probably covered
with red paint anyway, did wire my
uncle I could not fill his request.
So home to bed early tonight, to catch
up on spare sleep, and to dosing myself
with aspirin, just in case the cold in my
head should be a minor type of flu. Do
solemnly hope that nothing new in the
way of excitement will come off this eve
ning, though there is really nothing left
to happen but an earthquake, or to sub
stitute the Stanford clock tower for the
California Campanile, or unless the cer
tain students on this campus have so
caught the habit of building bonfires that
they want to have another. Which docs
bring to my mind the axiom of my aunt
that children should not be allowed to
play with fire.
Am relieved to see that the fire hy
drants in front of the Administration
building are again painted white, for 1
have such difficulty seeing them when
I am parking a car now that any change
in their color scheme would be discom
fiting—though do hear comments that
they were prettier in vari-colors. Do en
joy mightily the many groups of stu
dents discussing the Game situation that
I do stumble upon from time to time, and
overheard the funniest man on the
campus express the opinion that the
gentleman who was careless with his
matches last Tuesday morning was a
more important captive than the Golden
Bear.
