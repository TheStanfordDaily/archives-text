### 
DENVER, Nov. 22 (/P). — The co
operative agency as a means of solving
the "farm problem" was commended to
Congress today by the Farmers' Educa
tional and Co-operative Union of Ameri
ca in the final session of its annual con
vention as a basis on which to work in
the designing of any relief legislation.
The convention resolved that Congress
should effect legislation providing for
the control of all contract grain markets,
together with the supervision of all grain
weighing, inspection and laboratory test
ing, to come under the authority of the
Secretary of Agriculture.
The McNary-Haugen Bill, the prin
ciples of which were endorsed by the
Union convention a year ago, was not
mentioned in the resolutions adopted to
day. The committee on legislation, of
which Governor Walter J. Maddock of
North Dakota was chairman, recom
mended to the Union the attitude that
the incoming national administration
"comes solemnly pledged to a study of
the agricultural problem and an adequate
treatment of it, insofar as legislation can
serve. We express confidence that the
administration will keep its pledge to the
American farmers."
The committee's report was adopted
by a unanimous vote.
Among the other resolutions adopted
was one favoring tariff protection of the
home market for all farm products 011
which the tariff is operative, and making
effective the tariff 011 such farm products
as have exportable surpluses, "to the end
that the farmer may have a market as
well protected as industry enjoys at all
times."
