# Card Rooters Buy 2758 Tickets; Block "S" Men Receive 1055 As Share

Twenty-seven thousand, four hundred
and sixty-seven of those priceless, unob
tainable pieces of pasteboard that they
call tickets to the Big Game went out
from the ticket office of the Stanford
Board of Athletic Control during the
past few weeks. This number represents
35 per cent of the seating capacity of the
Memorial Stadium at Berkeley.
Rooters, rooters, and then more root
ers, to the number of 2758, will send
cheers for the sons of the Stanford Red
roaring across the field. California's
rooting section will probably be twice as
large.
Block "S" men received 1,055 tickets,
which means that about 525 men applied,
since most applications were for two
tickets. Alumni received the greater
portion of Stanford's allotment, a total
of 10,785. Stanford students purchased
5,394 seats in addition to their rooters'
tickets, and the rest of Stanford's tick
ets went to faculty, stadium Subscribers,
scrip holders, and specials such as trus
tees and the Stanford National Board.
