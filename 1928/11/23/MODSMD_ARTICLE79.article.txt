LOWELL, Mass. (^P)â€” Every per- |
son must have three prejudices in life
if he is to have consistent, stable
standards, says Professor Herman H. |
Prase, psychologist and member of '
the faculty of the State Normal School
here. These prejudices, he says, are:
That he has the best mother in the j
world.
That he believes in and belongs to j
the finest church on the face of the
earth.
That he belongs to the finest na
tion in the world.
