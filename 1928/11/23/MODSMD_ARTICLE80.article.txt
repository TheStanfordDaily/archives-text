# Couple Sailing Down River In Frail Home-Made Scow
## 
### 
GRAND CANYON, Ariz., Nov. 22.â€”
With about two weeks of adventurous
"sailing" ahead of them, Mr. and Mrs.
Glenn R. Hyde of Hansen, Idaho, arc
somewhere between here and Needles,
Calif., their destination, journeying down
the turbulent Colorado River in a sturdy,
home-made scow.
The couple passed Bright Angel Creek
a few days having passed over the
most dangerous part of their trip, but
must encounter some more threatening
rapids in the canyon west of here before
they reach smoother water.
