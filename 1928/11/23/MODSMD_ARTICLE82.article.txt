# BIG GAME ECHOES TO LAST ALL NIGHT
## Stanford Spirits to Overflow in After-Game Festivities as S.F. Hotels Make Special Preparations 
### 
The Big Game spirit which has mani
fested itself in rebuilding bonfires, which
have been prematurely burned, and
cheering the team on to victory will not
diminish in strength when the final
whistle of the game rings through the
Berkeley air tomorrow afternoon.
The sons of the Stanford Red will
mingle with the faithful adherents of
the Blue and Gold in merry festivities
far into the hours of tomorrow night,
and into the cold but happy dawn Sun
day morning. The chief scenes of fes
tive activity will be San Francisco's
large hotels, but merrymaking of all
sorts will go on, whether in a small or
a large way.
The Fairmont will be the official head
quarters of Stanford, and the lovers of
the Cardinal will perform the rites of
Big Game Night in much the same spirit
that the bonfire was rebuilt, one of hap
py determination and celebration.
High Point of Year
Big Game Night is the high point of
San Francisco hotels' hospitality. It sur
passes all other nights of the year in
the number of people served and lodged
in the hotels. The night of the Stanford-
California game has become a larger

affair than even New Year's Eve in San
Francisco. Hotel reservations are se
cured as far ahead as a whole year.
The Mark Hopkins will take care of
about sixteen hundred people tomorrow
night. There has been a waiting list of
five hundred for some weeks past. The
entire main floor and the mezzanine floor
will be used for dancing. Two orches
tras will play.
St. Francis Packed
Twenty-one hundred reservations have
been sold at the St. Francis, where the
three rooms, the Fable, the Mural and
the Colonial, will be used for the cele
brations. The Palace is preparing to
serve dinner to approximately one thou
sand guests for the evening.
The Stanford Alumni Association is
handling the two thousand reservations
at the Fairmont. All the sons and daugh
ters of the Stanford Red will be seen at
least once during the evening at this
miniature university where pleasure
reigns supreme.
For, no matter whether the Cardinal
or the Gold and Blue emerges victorious
from the gridiron struggle tomorrow,
everyone will be making "Big Game
whoopie" from 7 o'clock at night to 7
o'clock in the morning.

San Francisco hotels' hospitality. It sur
passes all other nights of the year in
the number of people served and lodged
in the hotels. The night of the Stanford-
California game has become a larger

affair than even New Year's Eve in San
Francisco. Hotel reservations are se
cured as far ahead as a whole year.
The Mark Hopkins will take care of
about sixteen hundred people tomorrow
night. There has been a waiting list of
five hundred for some weeks past. The
entire main floor and the mezzanine floor
will be used for dancing. Two orches
tras will play.
St. Francis Packed
Twenty-one hundred reservations have
been sold at the St. Francis, where the
three rooms, the Fable, the Mural and
the Colonial, will be used for the cele
brations. The Palace is preparing to
serve dinner to approximately one thou
sand guests for the evening.
The Stanford Alumni Association is
handling the two thousand reservations
at the Fairmont. All the sons and daugh
ters of the Stanford Red will be seen at
least once during the evening at this
miniature university where pleasure
reigns supreme.
For, no matter whether the Cardinal
or the Gold and Blue emerges victorious
from the gridiron struggle tomorrow,
everyone will be making "Big Game
whoopie" from 7 o'clock at night to 7
o'clock in the morning.
The Big Game spirit which has mani
fested itself in rebuilding bonfires, which
have been prematurely burned, and
cheering the team on to victory will not
diminish in strength when the final
whistle of the game rings through the
Berkeley air tomorrow afternoon.
The sons of the Stanford Red will
mingle with the faithful adherents of
the Blue and Gold in merry festivities
far into the hours of tomorrow night,
and into the cold but happy dawn Sun
day morning. The chief scenes of fes
tive activity will be San Francisco's
large hotels, but merrymaking of all
sorts will go on, whether in a small or
a large way.
The Fairmont will be the official head
quarters of Stanford, and the lovers of
the Cardinal will perform the rites of
Big Game Night in much the same spirit
that the bonfire was rebuilt, one of hap
py determination and celebration.
