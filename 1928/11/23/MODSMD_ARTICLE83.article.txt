# New U.S.C. Library To Be Monument To War Dead
## 
### 
In keeping with the generally accepted
idea that memorials should serve the liv
ing as well as commemorate the dead,
the University of Southern California
has designated that the new library,
shortly to be erected on the campus, is
to stand as the monument to the thirty
five Trojans who died in the World War.
The library has been chosen as a me
morial, it was said, because it is the one
building that will serve the entire insti
tution. According to preliminary plans
the proposed library is to cost approxi
mately $750,000 of which $450,000 has
already been pledged by students.
