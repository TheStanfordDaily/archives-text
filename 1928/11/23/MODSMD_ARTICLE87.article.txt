# BOHEMIAN STUDENTS GIVEN NEW HOTEL
## Parisian Educators in Favor of Comfort and Convenience; Hotel Is Gift of American Philanthropist 
### 
PARIS, Nov. 22. (/P) —Bohemian
student life is out of fashion in Paris.
So are bad beds and cold study rooms
as an aid to concentration.
Modern Parisian educators favor
comfort and convenience with ade
quate supervision of diet, rest, and
recreation. Young women students,
comparative newcomers in the Pari
sian student scheme, are even pro
vided with suitable chaperones in
some circles.
The latest step toward student pro
tection is the dedication of a hostel
with accommodations for 120 women
in the far-famed Boulevard St. Michel,
lovingly called the Boul' Mich 1 in
other less supervised student times.
The new hostel is the gift of an
American woman, Mrs. Wliitney-
Hoff, philanthropist, whose gifts to
aitists and students are well known
in Europe.
Students from more than 20 nations
are housed in the new Boulevard St.
Michel retreat. Twenty-live of the
young women are French, 25 are Brit
ish or American, and the remaining
70 come from various countries. Life

Lii the hostel Is more sheltered even
tliun in the modern Cit6 Universitaire,
international model student center
just outside the Porte d'Orleans.
Despite the desires of French edu
cators, not all students here have
modern quarters. Some are lodged in
houses hundreds of years old with
narrow windows which look into
streets and courtyards of medieval
origin. Such accommodations shel
tered the self-reliant students who
came to Paris from Genoa, Warsaw,
Vienna, and Utrecht in the middle
ages to soak up wisdom from teach
ing philosophers like Robert Sorbon,
from whom the Sorbonne takes its
name.
Many of the modern students have
to obtain water from outdoor pumps,
and bathtubs are unknown luxuries.
The other extreme of student exist
ence is the clubs sometimes formed
by wealthy students, usually foreign
ers, who take modern furnished apart
ments and share expenses of main
taining them. Most of the clubs are
located in Montparnasse, Latin quar
ter center for foreign artists, writers,
and musicians.

comparative newcomers in the Pari
sian student scheme, are even pro
vided with suitable chaperones in
some circles.
The latest step toward student pro
tection is the dedication of a hostel
with accommodations for 120 women
in the far-famed Boulevard St. Michel,
lovingly called the Boul' Mich 1 in
other less supervised student times.
The new hostel is the gift of an
American woman, Mrs. Wliitney-
Hoff, philanthropist, whose gifts to
aitists and students are well known
in Europe.
Students from more than 20 nations
are housed in the new Boulevard St.
Michel retreat. Twenty-live of the
young women are French, 25 are Brit
ish or American, and the remaining
70 come from various countries. Life

Lii the hostel Is more sheltered even
tliun in the modern Cit6 Universitaire,
international model student center
just outside the Porte d'Orleans.
Despite the desires of French edu
cators, not all students here have
modern quarters. Some are lodged in
houses hundreds of years old with
narrow windows which look into
streets and courtyards of medieval
origin. Such accommodations shel
tered the self-reliant students who
came to Paris from Genoa, Warsaw,
Vienna, and Utrecht in the middle
ages to soak up wisdom from teach
ing philosophers like Robert Sorbon,
from whom the Sorbonne takes its
name.
Many of the modern students have
to obtain water from outdoor pumps,
and bathtubs are unknown luxuries.
The other extreme of student exist
ence is the clubs sometimes formed
by wealthy students, usually foreign
ers, who take modern furnished apart
ments and share expenses of main
taining them. Most of the clubs are
located in Montparnasse, Latin quar
ter center for foreign artists, writers,
and musicians.
