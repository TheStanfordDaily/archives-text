## 
### 
VICTORIA, 8.C., Nov. 22 (/P).â€”Bad
ly down at the head, which gave her a
lopsided appearance, the big British
freighter Albion Star, limped into port
at Esquimalt today, after grounding on
Rosedale Reef, half a mile south of Race
Rocks, shortly after midnight.
There were three or four feet of water
in the stokehold but other than this lit
tle damage was caused by the impact
with the reef. Pumps were put to work
as soon as the vessel tied up alongside
the drydock.
It is expected that the cargo will have
to be taken off so that the ship will be
able to enter drydock if the damage
proves at all serious.
