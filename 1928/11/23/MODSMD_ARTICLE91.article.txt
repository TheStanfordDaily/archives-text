SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 22 (/P). â€”
The fallacious fancy that spuds and
sylphs are strangers is all wrong, po
tato men think today.
Petite flappers can safely eat these
succulent tubers without endangering
that modish figure, it was asserted by
VV. P. Romans, manager of the Pacific
Northwest Potato Growers' Association,
now in convention here.
"The old notion that potatoes should
be tabooed by those seeking slenderncss,"
he declared, "has been dissipated by sci
entific discoveries. One leading food
authority declared that if the average
American would eat four or five times
as many potatoes as he now eats, the
result would be a marked increase in
physical fitness and freedom from crip
pling illnesses."
"Besides," he concluded, "that notion
is piling up a surplus of potatoes that
spells losses to growers all over the coun
try."
