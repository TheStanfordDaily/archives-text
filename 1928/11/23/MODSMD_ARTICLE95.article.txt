thrills in the San FrancisCo Civic Audi

The board of supervisors of the City
and County of San Francisco, through j
the auditorium committee, have arranged j
for the free broadcast of the Big Game j
at the Civic Auditorium, Grove and Lar- j
kin streets, San Francisco, tomorrow at j
2:15 o'clock.
The auditorium will be divided into â– 
two sections, one for the Stanford sup
porters, the other for backers of the Gold

ball field will be erected, and will show
the plays simultaneously with those tak
ing place at Berkeley. Scoreboards will
rceord the touchdowns.
K.PO will handle the broadcasting and
will assure listeners a reproduction of
the songs; yells, the blare of the bands,
and a description of the rooters' stunts
as they arc carried out in the Big Game.
