or Harvard Stadium through the season,
the annual Yale-Harvard clash is an out
standing gridiron event of the Saturday

ing back to 1875, has made it that and
the-same traditiqti will bring a capacity
crowd to the bowl Saturday for the game
despite the reverses Oach tcatii has suf
fered this season.
The Sons of Eli have taken the short
end of the score three times, from Army,
Maryland and Princeton, while John
Harvard has bowed to Army and Penn
sylvania and played a drab scorless tie
with Holy Cross last Saturday. However
it is m the hooks that it will be a close
: hard-fought game, as it always has been,
. and the big game of the week.
: Princeton, defying tradition to play-
Navy a week after the Yale game, may
provide something to detract some inter
est from the Yale-Harvard struggle. The
Tigers and Midshipmen have put on a
! good many hot mid-season clashes and
there is no indication that the change in
date will affect the game appreciably.
Princeton still is undefeated, although
tied'tvHee, but Bill Roper has found nu
merous reasons to complain' of the diffi
culties of taking on a team as strong as
Navy a week after the traditional sea
son's-end battle.
