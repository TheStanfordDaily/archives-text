# History of Grid Career Of Stanford's Tackling Fullback Is Now Given
## 
### 
Six feet-two, 192 pounds of dynamic j
power —that's Captain Biff Hoffman,
Stanford's kicking, passing, line-bucking, !
tackling fullback.
Kiff, who hails from Petaluma High }
School, began his Cardinal gridiron ca- ,
reer somewhat inauspiciously, going
through the freshman football season j
(1924) as a substitute fullback. The
Daily Palo Alto, in discussing freshman
f(x>tball possibilities of that year, made j
the following comment: "Hoffman, who
played for Petaluma High School, is also
out for the fullback position. He needs
experience, hits too high, and is not as
consistent with his punts as Millage, the
other candidate for this position."
The next year Ernie Nevers was func
tioning as fullback on the varsity, and
doing it so well that he was the unani
mous choice for the All-American first
team; and, as a result, Hoffman's oppor
tunity to win a block "S" via the full
back route was very, very negligible.
In 1926 Biff stepped into Ernie's shoes.
He came into his own in the Big Game
last year with the great exhibition of
football.
Besides his activity on the gridiron,
Hoffman won three varsity track letters
as a shot-putter and discus-thrower of'
note.
