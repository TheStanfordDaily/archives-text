g friends of you and for you. It is constantly p
6 offering kindly assistance by introducing worthy ®
rg merchandise to you. It tells you of the best
clothes; of the newest time and labor-saving
p devices; of opportunities to save money by &
g making certain purchases at certain stores on gfj
g specified days. It even points the way that ®

E Advertising is, unconsciously to you per- K
g haps, your steadfast friend. It has established
g an era of good feeling between you, the stores,
E the manufacturers and their products. Adver- S
g tising is honest and sincere. You can believe it g
g and believe in the product it calls to your at- g
& tention. Advertising is a real friend-maker. S
