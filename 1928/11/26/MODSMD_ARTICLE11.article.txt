# 'FRANKLIN' TOPIC OF FAY LECTURE TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
"Benjamin Franklin" will be the
subject of a lecture by Professor Ber
nard Fay, eminent French historian,
in the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock
tomorrow evening. Professor Fay is a
member of the faculty at the Univer
sily of Clermont-Ferrand in France,
and at present is studying at the
Huntington Library near Los Angeles.
The intellectual development of
France, especially during the eight
eenth century, is Professor Fay's spe
cialty. It is from this angle, looking
at Franklin as a significant repre
sentative of the period, that Professor
Fay depicts the famous American. He
is also very much interested in mod
ern French literature.
This will be the second lecture
which Professor Fay has given at
Stanford on the Tuesday evening lec
ture series in the last two years. He
spoke here in June 1927 on "Interna
tionalism versus Cosmopolitanism in
Contemporary French Literature." He
was at that time a visiting professor
at Columbia University.
