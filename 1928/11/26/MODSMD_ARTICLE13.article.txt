# QUARTERS MADE READY FOR NEW "FLU" PATIENTS
## 
### 
In order to be prepared for an in
creased number of "flu" patients
which are expected to develop as a
result of Big Game activities and the
rebuilding of the Bonfire, the unused
Branner dining hall is being equipped
as an emergency hospital unit, accord
ing to a statement issued last night
by Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Medical Ad
visor of Men.
"We are uftder no immediate pres
sure," said Dr. Storey, "but we are
merely looking ahead." The present
hospital facilities on the campus and
in Palo Alto are not over-crowded.
"Sunday there were no patients in
the Isolation Hospital, indicating a
typical week-end situation in which
wards are emptied on Friday and Sat
urday and refilled on the following
Monday. Last Monday seventy men
came into the medical department for
advice."
From twenty to thirty beds for men
will be placed in the Branner dining
hall should the situation become
more serious. Janitors were cleaning
and disinfecting the dining hall all
yesterday afternoon so that no time
will be lost should an emergency
arise.
The number of women patients be
ing cared for in wing A of Roble had
dropped from six to one, Sunday af
ternoon. The Roble unit and the
Hempl house are planned to take
care of the overflow of women from
the Palo Alto Hospital; the Branner
Hall ward and the Isolation Hospital
are intended to take care of the extra
men.
It was through the courtesy of Dr.
Langnecker that the Hempl house, 741
Santa Ynez, has been entirely turned
over to use for students as a hos
pital until the "flu" epidemic passes.
The Stanford Mothers Club has ar
ranged two rest-homes for convalesc
ing students, with the idea of giving
them quiet sleep and home-cooked
food after leaving the hospital. Men
are sent to Mrs. Morrison's home, 536
Alvarado, and women to Mrs. Owen's
home, 553 Salvatierra.
