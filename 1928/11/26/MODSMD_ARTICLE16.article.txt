# NEW MYSTICISM TO SAVE MODERN WORLD-NEWMAN
## 
### 
That a complete reliance on the
power of economic facts, and a ra
tionalism which places its whole
trust and reliance on reason, charac
terize the present modern machine
age of science, and that a revival of
mysticism will save the world of the
Great God Science from its own de
struction, was the belief expressed
yesterday morning by Rabbi Louis I.
Newman of the Temple Emmanu-El
I in San Francisco in his sermon in the
! Memorial Church.
Dr. Newman began his sermon on
! modern religion with the old concep
i tion of it as a discipline and a yoke.
("Religion," he said, "comes from a
1 Greek word meaning that which
i binds, and it should be a set of duties,
j responsibilities, and disciplines which
I ask from us the best we have to offer
| to life, instead of the modern idea of
| people's demanding from life its best."
"Man is not satisfied with being
only a 'thinking machine,' " continue
Dr. Newman. "Modern rationalists say
that religion is an illusion by which
men and women may be adjusted to
J rtality, but we cannot brush aside the
j mystic powers and spiritual yearnings
of many by saying religion is an illu
sion. This scientific agfe will never be
content until it has probed again into
the world of dreams, ideals, folk-lore,
| poetry, art, and mysticism, and it will
! be a new revival of mysticism that
! will ultimately save the machine-age
| of technical science from the seeds of
I destruction inherent within it."
