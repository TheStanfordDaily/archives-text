# CARDS BATTLE BEARS TO 13-13 TIE IN EXCITING GAME BEFORE 90,000
## Simkins-Frentrup Pass Scores Second Card Touchdown With But One Minute To Play; Second String Backfield Great In Rally 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
After Saturday's thrilling spectacle in Berkeley not less than 90,000
people are firm believers in the old expression that "truth is stranger
than fiction." Not even the wildest college novel or collegiate movie
could get away with the plot involved in the Big Game: Stanford six
points bhind, the ball on the 22-yard line, fourth down, one and one-half
minutes to play, and a substitute backfield combination completing a long
pass (one-yard line from the end zone) to tie the score 13-13.

That was the situation, a repeti

ints from two touchdowns scored in
seven points from Simkin's touch
-down and Lewis' conversion in the
third quarter.
Cards Start in Last Half
From the way they started the sec
ond half the Cardinals seemed good
for at least two touchdowns. They
scored once in the first few minutes
of the half and started down the field
again but lost the ball on an incom
pleted pass over the goal line.
In the final period the Redshirts
twice battered and passed their way
deep into Blue-and-Gold territory only
to lose the ball on intercepted passes.
With the determination of Robert
Bruce they again took the ball and
fought their way goalwards. With
one and one-half minutes to play and
one down remaining, Bill Simkins
threw a long pass over the goal, over
the head of "Speed" Newman, "cover
ing" Frentrup for California, into the
waiting arms of "Elusive" Lud who
stood less than one yard from the end
zone.
Winnek Fails to Convert
On the try for the extra point Win
nek's kick was blocked by Fitz, Cali
fornia tackle, whose speed was aided
by the delay before the kick. A few
more seconds and the game ended, a
13-13 tie.
The first half belonged to Califor
nia. Up to half-time the Bears looked
invincible. Once they scored o,n an
intercepted pass, Bancroft/ U.C.
tackle, taking Biff's pas#'on the 24-
yard line and running 76 yards to a
touchdown. Barr failed to convert. A
Lom-to-Avery pass scored another
touchdown just before the half ended.
This time Barr kicked goal.
The story of the second half is a
complete reversion. It was Stanford
all the way.
Simkins, Frentrup Star
Simkins and Frentrup were the
heroes of the day but backfield hon
ors were shared also by Sims and
Lewis; all four of these men started
the second half while Wilton, Fleish
liacker and Captain Biff Hoffman sat
on the bench. It was their last Big
Game, but Pop's judgment in keeping
them out was justified in just a few
minutes of play. The new combina
tion had it all over the starting line
up. Sims remained in the game until
near the end when Warner sent in
Winnek, goal-kicking specialist, to at
tempt conversion on the expected
score. Again it was a Warnerism that
would have saved what, to others,
looked like a lost game.
If All-Americans are to be consid

field Saturday who exhibited suffi
