# SPECTATORS LAUD ROOTING STUNTS IN CARD SECTION
## 
### 
Some seventy thousand spectators
at the Big Game Saturday, curious as
to what would be pulled in the way
of card stunts, were anything but dis
appointed when both California and
Stanford executed some of the most
ingenious and intricate pictures ever
seen.
Big Game stunts fame has spread
far, and the Red rooting section
started the half-time program by
framing a gold "13" score on a blue
field. Followed a picture of Captain
Biff in a typical passing pose, and
the stunt which spelled Pop's name.
California was honored by a pic
ture of her prize-winning crew, pic
lured in blue and gold, with the cap
tion "Olympic Champs" written be
neath. But the final stunt was the
best. The picture opened as the White
House. The flagpole on the dome was
a real pole at the top of the rooting
section, and a flag was raised to the
top of it from the bottom of the
bleachers. "Hoover" was spelled
across the White House steps.
Ropes were swung down from the
â€¢center with the effect of a curtain
lowering, until the picture was blank
eted with a huge block "S" on a
cardinal field.
