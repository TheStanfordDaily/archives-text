# SOCCER VARSITY DROPS 3-0 GAME TO U.C. PLAYERS
## 
### 
With two games and the California I
series in their hands, the varsity soc-!
oer squad lost the third and last
game with the Berkeley squad Sat
urday morning on the opponent's field,
3 to 0. This does not take the series
championship away from the varsity '
but it prevents its having undisputed
superiority over the Bear squad.
1 The team played without five or six
of its first-string players, including i
Walter Fell, captain; Ed Robinson,
goalkeeper; Robert Burns, fullback; !
and Herbert Mayer. The fact that
these men were in the hospital with
flu was a decided loss to the unity
and regular calibre of the team.
California showed a change of tac- |
tics when it shifted one of the star [
backfield men to the forward line, and ]
in this new position he was able to ,
score two out of the three goals. Ac- j
cording to Coach Ward Smith, the
California team showed a decided im- ,
provement in its playing Saturday J
over that of the previous two weeks.
"Walter Buckingham played a good j
game and endeavored valiantly in his
forward position to add up a few j
goals for the varsity," stated Smith. |
