# Mr. Fowler Prefers To Be Editor
## 
### 
Would you rather be editor of the Daily than captain of the football
team? It's a ten-to-one shot you wouldn't, and you can take it from us
it is probably just as much work to arrive at this dizzy pinnacle of
campus journalism as to fight your way into the leadership of the beef
which Stanford, and indeed the whole of California, worships as its
football team.
Whether you, dear reader, would or would not subscribe to the
sentiment that the pen is mightier than the pigskin, Mr. W. H. B. Fowler,
general manager of the San Farncisco Chronicle, thinks it is. At the
banquet of former editors of the Daily held last Thursday night, he
said in so many words that as an undergraduate he would rather be
editor of the Daily than football captain. Mr. Fowler did not go on
to explain his reasons, palpably assuming that since all those who heard
him had been editors of the Daily and none captains of the football team,
they would acquiesce with him. Incidentally, Mr. Fowler is to go to
New York for the Stanford-Army game. Testimony was afterward
given by other speakers, however, in which it was declared that the
ability of expression, self-reliance, and the many other lessons learned
through work on the campus newspaper were worth more to the pos
sessors than most of what they derived from courses taken in the
University. Moreover, it was pointed out that the group was a very
prosperous one, albeit it included former journalists, some of whom still
were servants of the Fourth Estate.
A fact brought out at the reunion and which made a particular im
pression upon the present editor of this long-established organ of light
was that the publications have been relieved of the greater part of the
obnoxious censorship which formerly oppressed them. In the old days,
an editor of the Daily Palo Alto was almost to be regarded as a
failure if he escaped being kicked out of the University during his term.
The Student Affairs Committee, the president, and other regulators of
student ways, used aforetime to come down heavily when anything con
trary to their liking appeared in the Duty's columns. Some of the
best men we saw at the reunion last Thursday admitted that they had
been expelled at one time or other as a result of their views.
Nowadays, an editor has hardly the slightest fear of expulsion. It
may be that the removal of the basis of fear has resulted in Daily
editors resultantly toning down; at any rate, we seem so far this quarter
to have avoided inciting great antagonism in every quarter but that im
portant one which the Rally Committee occupies.

New York for the Stanford-Army game. Testimony was afterward
given by other speakers, however, in which it was declared that the
ability of expression, self-reliance, and the many other lessons learned
through work on the campus newspaper were worth more to the pos
sessors than most of what they derived from courses taken in the
University. Moreover, it was pointed out that the group was a very
prosperous one, albeit it included former journalists, some of whom still
were servants of the Fourth Estate.
A fact brought out at the reunion and which made a particular im
pression upon the present editor of this long-established organ of light
was that the publications have been relieved of the greater part of the
obnoxious censorship which formerly oppressed them. In the old days,
an editor of the Daily Palo Alto was almost to be regarded as a
failure if he escaped being kicked out of the University during his term.
The Student Affairs Committee, the president, and other regulators of
student ways, used aforetime to come down heavily when anything con
trary to their liking appeared in the Duty's columns. Some of the
best men we saw at the reunion last Thursday admitted that they had
been expelled at one time or other as a result of their views.
Nowadays, an editor has hardly the slightest fear of expulsion. It
may be that the removal of the basis of fear has resulted in Daily
editors resultantly toning down; at any rate, we seem so far this quarter
to have avoided inciting great antagonism in every quarter but that im
portant one which the Rally Committee occupies.
Would you rather be editor of the Daily than captain of the football
team? It's a ten-to-one shot you wouldn't, and you can take it from us
it is probably just as much work to arrive at this dizzy pinnacle of
campus journalism as to fight your way into the leadership of the beef
which Stanford, and indeed the whole of California, worships as its
football team.
Whether you, dear reader, would or would not subscribe to the
sentiment that the pen is mightier than the pigskin, Mr. W. H. B. Fowler,
general manager of the San Farncisco Chronicle, thinks it is. At the
banquet of former editors of the Daily held last Thursday night, he
said in so many words that as an undergraduate he would rather be
editor of the Daily than football captain. Mr. Fowler did not go on
to explain his reasons, palpably assuming that since all those who heard
him had been editors of the Daily and none captains of the football team,
they would acquiesce with him. Incidentally, Mr. Fowler is to go to
New York for the Stanford-Army game. Testimony was afterward
