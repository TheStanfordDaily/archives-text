# To The Gaieties
## 
### 
The Football Gaieties was a worthy tribute to Stanford's dramatic
tradition. The program as a whole went off with a professional click,
none of the usual entr'acte gaps being manifest. Harold Helvenston's
and Jack Meakin's "Machinery Ballet" was one of the artistic highlights
of the year, but for hearty laughter we favored Mr. Philip Space's and
Mr. Paul Speegle's radio broadcast opus. It will be a long time before
the leading newspaper of the Pacific Coast outlives the epithet
"Barnacle."
Gordon Davis, the technicians, and the cast of the Gaieties are the
more to be congratulated for their success because of the fact that
several rehearsals had to be held elsewhere than in the Assembly Hall,
since that ancient edifice was often in use last week.
