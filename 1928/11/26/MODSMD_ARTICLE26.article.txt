Peru and Bolivia, returning to Los
Angeles in 1894. In 1912 he suffered
a temporary attack of blindness after
contracting fever in Guatemala.
On pleasure bent, I)r. Lummis quit
his job on an Ohio newspaper more
than two score years ago, slung a
pack over his shoulders, and set out
to walk the country that lay west
ward to the Pacific Coast.
