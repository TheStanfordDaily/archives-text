THE GOOD GENII
Football, the genii which escaped
from the bottle, has become so big
within the past few years that it is
beyond the control of college adminis
trations. Many a university president
would like to put the genii back into
the bottle, feeling that the game, with
its attendant publicity, obscures learn
ing as the chief purpose of a college.
Such a move would not only incur the
almighty wrath of alumni, students,
and general public, but would elimi
nate the school's chief medium of pub
licity.
Publicity has become a highly
necessary evil in higher education.
Nowadays the cloistered halls of
learning must be ballyliooed in the
same manner as the latest musical
comedy, and for the same reason:
money. The university that doesn't
ring up an appropriation in its cash
register now and then is headed for
slow death.
As an illustration of the publicity
value of football, consider Center Col
lege, which nobody ever heard of
previous to the time that Bo McMil
lan and his gang blazed a trail of
victory through the East and caused
Center College to become 76-point
news. Since the passing of that ex
ceptional team, Center has been for
gotten. St. Mary's is another example
of the obscure small school which
has achieved fame through football.
Since 1924, the football genii has
been exceedingly kind to Stanford.
This University is now almost as
widely famed as Oxford, and winning
football must be credited with the
greater share of this fame-producing
honors. In case you cherish any dis
appointment with regard to the sea
son now ending, pause and contem
plate the following slub of history:
In five years, Stanford has lost but
two Conference games. Once the var
sity stubbed its toe at Seattle, and

once, through unintentional charity,
it presented U.S.C. with a win. Other
wise the story has been all victory,
with the exception of two or three tie
scores. During this same period Stan
ford has represented the West four
times (including next Saturday) in
outstanding intersectional games.
Back East they have quit calling us
The Leland Stanford Junior College.
That is progress! Stanford, with the
assistance of the varsity and Presi
dent-elect Hoover, is now running a
race with Harvard for foremost posi
tion among American universities.
Remember also that the local stu
dent body is comparatively small —
not much of a field for the selection
of championship material. Pop has
been earning his salary twice over.
If you are still a disappointed
rooter, consider further that Stanford
is enjoying its athletic heyday—an
unprecedented period of victory in
sport. Naturally we must slip sooner
or later. Humans are built that way.
Pop Warner's trouble is that, while
be is the author of most of the new
stuff, he can't prevent lesser satellites
from using it.
The reader will probably be trip
ping over his white whiskers before
such another period of athletic pros
perity comes to Stanford.
Thirty young men left yesterday
morning for New York, to boost the
Cardinal banner higher still. Incident
ally, it is to be hoped that they will
do New York some good as well. The
average New Yorker thinks that Chi
cago is as far west as a mortal could
go, and will listen pop-eyed to stories
of recent Indian massacres on the
streets of Los Angeles. New York is
the most provincial town in the coun
try. The Stanford-Army game will
help convince Gothamites that, as
Will Rogers pointed out, there are
several people living west of the Hud
son River. —Winston Norman.
