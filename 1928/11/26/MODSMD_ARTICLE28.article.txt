The Editor, Sir:
It's all over but the chafed hands
and postmortems; the chafed hands
will become a memory in a day; i. )st
mortems are always in vogue. Anyone
who fails to see any redeeming fea
tures in the rebuilding of the Cali
fornia pyre is in limbo. The activities
in the erecting of the second bonfire
done in such spirit and good humor
was the most genuine exhibition of
Stanford spirit for some time, a dis
play that is mute but unassailable. It
was great to be there. No matter if
one were tired he meandered back to
the scene of building just to be a part
of the achievement.
The person who ignited the Frosli
pyre simply aroused the hitherto dor
mant Stanford energy. To that per
son may we thank the present Stan
ford spirit which made the rally what
it was and replaced the stale, smug
complacency that passed for our ardor
this quarter. We have like many other
colleges slept on our prestige, but
given the obstacle we have surmount
ed it decisively. It was a favor be
stowed on a college spirit gone to
seed by making it bloom forth attrac
tive and sincere.
The Frosh, being the first on the
grounds to start the actual rebuilding
and showing great willingness at all
times, have acquitted themselves.
Even the much-mooted Roble women
responded gracefully and along with
the upperclasswomen made them
selves useful in doling out the vic
tuals. To be sure they shouldn't have
employed such attractive hashers as
they distracted so many of the work
ers from the labor. It was no effort
to linger around the food-dispenser
with the feminine pulchitrude doing
the hot-dog stand act.
Thus, with the whole student body
acting together and many students
who probably were not aware of each
other's presence before, working in
unison, there spread a feeling of
democracy as well as intimacy that
would never have existed had not an
emergency arisen like the conflagra
tion of the initial pyre. The building
of the bonfires is a boon to companion
ship in the freshman class. One meets
more in working collectively on an
activity of this sort and has a ten
dency to place some value on these
acquaintances; mixers are superficial
compared to laborfcig under common
conditions as a means of acquainting
classmates. There is no reason why
the bonfire shouldn't go on as before,
it is the keynote of student enthu
siasm, it is the symbol of Stanford
Spirit. —Julius Berg, *32.

The Editor, Sir:
The editorial "Graduate Schools
Are Athletically Weak," appearing in
the Stanford Daily, Thursday, Novem
ber 22, quite convinced me that they
are. It is likewise evident that Stan
ford is becoming moro and more a
graduate school. And when it does, I
agree that the B. of A. C. will ex
perience "receiptless" Saturdays.

i The strange thing about the edi
torial is not the facts and judgments
presented but the tendency to view
with alarm "that cataclysmic day"
when Stanford will be predominantly
a graduate school and athletics will
take a lower place than the high one
it now occupies.
The University of Chicago and Har
vard are the two horrible examples
cited. It should be noted, however,
that "Chicago is a great educational
institution" still and that Harvard
students "do not give a damn about
the fortunes of the football team,
win, lose, or draw."
Why then should we be wrought up
concerning the future of Stanford
when, by the analogy in the editorial,
it will be a great educational institu
tion attended by students who don't
give a damn about athletics? Presum
ably we have football for the honor
of the school and because the students
love the sport. But if the school does
not need the honor and the students
do not love the sport, why bother
about "Receiptless Saturdays"?
—C. W. B.
One of the many criticisms directed
at higher education in the past few
years is that it is impractical. One
of the outstanding reasons why Stan
ford should be exempted from this
accusation is our bonfire tradition.
A certain school of educators has
set up seven cardinal principles
which represent the ne plus ultra of
what any course should represent. Let
us take them in order and see how
many are represented in the bonfire
activity.
It is perhaps true that a knowledge
of the fundamental subjects is nei
ther necessary for nor developed by
this tradition. But look at the com
pensating factors —health, worthy
home membership, worthy use of lei
sure, ethical training, preparation for
citizenship, and vocational training
(especially for engineers and pre
meds.) —all six of these —count them
—are embodied in, increased by, and
excuses for the pyre building activity.
Accordingly as a matter of far
sighted, educational policy, all the
forces of the University should com
bine in an effort to rebuild our bon
fire. First, the student body should
be segregated into the sheep and the
goats—the latter, of course, repre
senting the conscientious objector ele
ment. This could be done by the use
of the Moot Courts recently inaugu
rated by (he Law School. The depart
ment of Educational Psychology
could do somo fine work by testing
the average intelligence of the sheep
and the goat leaders.
The History Department could jus
tify its existence by having the seml
nnr students chronicle the events. De
! Foe's "Journal of the Plague Year"
offers an example of what English
students might produce. The Military
Department could be used in herding
up the sheep and subduing the goats.
Credit in Physical Training with A

grade must be given to every one j
who carries wood all night.
Public Speaking and Journalism
might combine forces to organize lit- ;
erary and oratorical campaigns in I
support of the movement. Graduation
with distinction should be earned on j
the open field as well as in the class- i
room. I
Out-of-date classroom equipment i
should be rushed to the pyre. Enthu- j
siastic alumni would be more than !
willing to purchase new, when they
see the worthy use to which the old
has been put.
In short, the whole thing should be
made an intellectual and scientific af- i
ialr —something which will make his
tory In the records of Stanford. Let
us have no accusations of emotional
ism! Excelsior!
—L. 11. Kirkpatrick, '29.

The Editor, Sir:
It's all over but the chafed hands
and postmortems; the chafed hands
will become a memory in a day; i. )st
mortems are always in vogue. Anyone
who fails to see any redeeming fea
tures in the rebuilding of the Cali
fornia pyre is in limbo. The activities
in the erecting of the second bonfire
done in such spirit and good humor
was the most genuine exhibition of
Stanford spirit for some time, a dis
play that is mute but unassailable. It
was great to be there. No matter if
one were tired he meandered back to
the scene of building just to be a part
of the achievement.
The person who ignited the Frosli
pyre simply aroused the hitherto dor
mant Stanford energy. To that per
son may we thank the present Stan
ford spirit which made the rally what
it was and replaced the stale, smug
complacency that passed for our ardor
this quarter. We have like many other
colleges slept on our prestige, but
given the obstacle we have surmount
ed it decisively. It was a favor be
stowed on a college spirit gone to
seed by making it bloom forth attrac
tive and sincere.
The Frosh, being the first on the
grounds to start the actual rebuilding
and showing great willingness at all
times, have acquitted themselves.
Even the much-mooted Roble women
responded gracefully and along with
the upperclasswomen made them
selves useful in doling out the vic
tuals. To be sure they shouldn't have
employed such attractive hashers as
they distracted so many of the work
ers from the labor. It was no effort
to linger around the food-dispenser
with the feminine pulchitrude doing
the hot-dog stand act.
Thus, with the whole student body
acting together and many students
who probably were not aware of each
other's presence before, working in
unison, there spread a feeling of
democracy as well as intimacy that
would never have existed had not an
emergency arisen like the conflagra
tion of the initial pyre. The building
of the bonfires is a boon to companion
ship in the freshman class. One meets
more in working collectively on an
activity of this sort and has a ten
dency to place some value on these
acquaintances; mixers are superficial
compared to laborfcig under common
conditions as a means of acquainting
classmates. There is no reason why
the bonfire shouldn't go on as before,
it is the keynote of student enthu
siasm, it is the symbol of Stanford
Spirit. —Julius Berg, *32.

The Editor, Sir:
The editorial "Graduate Schools
Are Athletically Weak," appearing in
the Stanford Daily, Thursday, Novem
ber 22, quite convinced me that they
are. It is likewise evident that Stan
ford is becoming moro and more a
graduate school. And when it does, I
agree that the B. of A. C. will ex
perience "receiptless" Saturdays.

i The strange thing about the edi
torial is not the facts and judgments
presented but the tendency to view
with alarm "that cataclysmic day"
when Stanford will be predominantly
a graduate school and athletics will
take a lower place than the high one
it now occupies.
The University of Chicago and Har
vard are the two horrible examples
cited. It should be noted, however,
that "Chicago is a great educational
institution" still and that Harvard
students "do not give a damn about
the fortunes of the football team,
win, lose, or draw."
Why then should we be wrought up
concerning the future of Stanford
when, by the analogy in the editorial,
it will be a great educational institu
tion attended by students who don't
give a damn about athletics? Presum
ably we have football for the honor
of the school and because the students
love the sport. But if the school does
not need the honor and the students
do not love the sport, why bother
about "Receiptless Saturdays"?
—C. W. B.
One of the many criticisms directed
at higher education in the past few
years is that it is impractical. One
of the outstanding reasons why Stan
ford should be exempted from this
accusation is our bonfire tradition.
A certain school of educators has
set up seven cardinal principles
which represent the ne plus ultra of
what any course should represent. Let
us take them in order and see how
many are represented in the bonfire
activity.
It is perhaps true that a knowledge
of the fundamental subjects is nei
ther necessary for nor developed by
this tradition. But look at the com
pensating factors —health, worthy
home membership, worthy use of lei
sure, ethical training, preparation for
citizenship, and vocational training
(especially for engineers and pre
meds.) —all six of these —count them
—are embodied in, increased by, and
excuses for the pyre building activity.
Accordingly as a matter of far
sighted, educational policy, all the
forces of the University should com
bine in an effort to rebuild our bon
fire. First, the student body should
be segregated into the sheep and the
goats—the latter, of course, repre
senting the conscientious objector ele
ment. This could be done by the use
of the Moot Courts recently inaugu
rated by (he Law School. The depart
ment of Educational Psychology
could do somo fine work by testing
the average intelligence of the sheep
and the goat leaders.
The History Department could jus
tify its existence by having the seml
nnr students chronicle the events. De
! Foe's "Journal of the Plague Year"
offers an example of what English
students might produce. The Military
Department could be used in herding
up the sheep and subduing the goats.
Credit in Physical Training with A

grade must be given to every one j
who carries wood all night.
Public Speaking and Journalism
might combine forces to organize lit- ;
erary and oratorical campaigns in I
support of the movement. Graduation
with distinction should be earned on j
the open field as well as in the class- i
room. I
Out-of-date classroom equipment i
should be rushed to the pyre. Enthu- j
siastic alumni would be more than !
willing to purchase new, when they
see the worthy use to which the old
has been put.
In short, the whole thing should be
made an intellectual and scientific af- i

The Editor, Sir:
It's all over but the chafed hands
and postmortems; the chafed hands
will become a memory in a day; i. )st
mortems are always in vogue. Anyone
who fails to see any redeeming fea
tures in the rebuilding of the Cali
fornia pyre is in limbo. The activities
in the erecting of the second bonfire
done in such spirit and good humor
was the most genuine exhibition of
Stanford spirit for some time, a dis
play that is mute but unassailable. It
was great to be there. No matter if
one were tired he meandered back to
the scene of building just to be a part
of the achievement.
The person who ignited the Frosli
pyre simply aroused the hitherto dor
mant Stanford energy. To that per
son may we thank the present Stan
ford spirit which made the rally what
it was and replaced the stale, smug
complacency that passed for our ardor
this quarter. We have like many other
colleges slept on our prestige, but
given the obstacle we have surmount
ed it decisively. It was a favor be
stowed on a college spirit gone to
seed by making it bloom forth attrac
tive and sincere.
The Frosh, being the first on the
grounds to start the actual rebuilding
and showing great willingness at all
times, have acquitted themselves.
Even the much-mooted Roble women
responded gracefully and along with
the upperclasswomen made them
selves useful in doling out the vic
tuals. To be sure they shouldn't have
employed such attractive hashers as
they distracted so many of the work
ers from the labor. It was no effort
to linger around the food-dispenser
with the feminine pulchitrude doing
the hot-dog stand act.
Thus, with the whole student body
acting together and many students
who probably were not aware of each
other's presence before, working in
unison, there spread a feeling of
democracy as well as intimacy that
would never have existed had not an
emergency arisen like the conflagra
tion of the initial pyre. The building
of the bonfires is a boon to companion
ship in the freshman class. One meets
more in working collectively on an
activity of this sort and has a ten
dency to place some value on these
acquaintances; mixers are superficial
compared to laborfcig under common
conditions as a means of acquainting
classmates. There is no reason why
the bonfire shouldn't go on as before,
it is the keynote of student enthu
siasm, it is the symbol of Stanford
Spirit. —Julius Berg, *32.

The Editor, Sir:
The editorial "Graduate Schools
Are Athletically Weak," appearing in
the Stanford Daily, Thursday, Novem
ber 22, quite convinced me that they
are. It is likewise evident that Stan
ford is becoming moro and more a
graduate school. And when it does, I
agree that the B. of A. C. will ex
perience "receiptless" Saturdays.

i The strange thing about the edi
torial is not the facts and judgments
presented but the tendency to view
with alarm "that cataclysmic day"
when Stanford will be predominantly
a graduate school and athletics will
take a lower place than the high one
it now occupies.
The University of Chicago and Har
vard are the two horrible examples
cited. It should be noted, however,
that "Chicago is a great educational
institution" still and that Harvard
students "do not give a damn about
the fortunes of the football team,
win, lose, or draw."
Why then should we be wrought up
concerning the future of Stanford
when, by the analogy in the editorial,
it will be a great educational institu
tion attended by students who don't
give a damn about athletics? Presum
ably we have football for the honor
of the school and because the students
love the sport. But if the school does
not need the honor and the students
do not love the sport, why bother
about "Receiptless Saturdays"?
—C. W. B.
One of the many criticisms directed
at higher education in the past few
years is that it is impractical. One
of the outstanding reasons why Stan
ford should be exempted from this
accusation is our bonfire tradition.
A certain school of educators has
set up seven cardinal principles
which represent the ne plus ultra of
what any course should represent. Let
us take them in order and see how
many are represented in the bonfire
activity.
It is perhaps true that a knowledge
of the fundamental subjects is nei
ther necessary for nor developed by
this tradition. But look at the com
pensating factors —health, worthy
home membership, worthy use of lei
sure, ethical training, preparation for
citizenship, and vocational training
(especially for engineers and pre
meds.) —all six of these —count them
—are embodied in, increased by, and
excuses for the pyre building activity.
Accordingly as a matter of far
sighted, educational policy, all the
forces of the University should com
bine in an effort to rebuild our bon
fire. First, the student body should
be segregated into the sheep and the
goats—the latter, of course, repre
senting the conscientious objector ele
ment. This could be done by the use
of the Moot Courts recently inaugu
rated by (he Law School. The depart
ment of Educational Psychology
could do somo fine work by testing
the average intelligence of the sheep
and the goat leaders.
The History Department could jus
tify its existence by having the seml
nnr students chronicle the events. De
! Foe's "Journal of the Plague Year"
offers an example of what English
students might produce. The Military
Department could be used in herding
up the sheep and subduing the goats.
Credit in Physical Training with A

The Editor, Sir:
It's all over but the chafed hands
and postmortems; the chafed hands
will become a memory in a day; i. )st
mortems are always in vogue. Anyone
who fails to see any redeeming fea
tures in the rebuilding of the Cali
fornia pyre is in limbo. The activities
in the erecting of the second bonfire
done in such spirit and good humor
was the most genuine exhibition of
Stanford spirit for some time, a dis
play that is mute but unassailable. It
was great to be there. No matter if
one were tired he meandered back to
the scene of building just to be a part
of the achievement.
The person who ignited the Frosli
pyre simply aroused the hitherto dor
mant Stanford energy. To that per
son may we thank the present Stan
ford spirit which made the rally what
it was and replaced the stale, smug
complacency that passed for our ardor
this quarter. We have like many other
colleges slept on our prestige, but
given the obstacle we have surmount
ed it decisively. It was a favor be
stowed on a college spirit gone to
seed by making it bloom forth attrac
tive and sincere.
The Frosh, being the first on the
grounds to start the actual rebuilding
and showing great willingness at all
times, have acquitted themselves.
Even the much-mooted Roble women
responded gracefully and along with
the upperclasswomen made them
selves useful in doling out the vic
tuals. To be sure they shouldn't have
employed such attractive hashers as
they distracted so many of the work
ers from the labor. It was no effort
to linger around the food-dispenser
with the feminine pulchitrude doing
the hot-dog stand act.
Thus, with the whole student body
acting together and many students
who probably were not aware of each
other's presence before, working in
unison, there spread a feeling of
democracy as well as intimacy that
would never have existed had not an
emergency arisen like the conflagra
tion of the initial pyre. The building
of the bonfires is a boon to companion
ship in the freshman class. One meets
more in working collectively on an
activity of this sort and has a ten
dency to place some value on these
acquaintances; mixers are superficial
compared to laborfcig under common
conditions as a means of acquainting
classmates. There is no reason why
the bonfire shouldn't go on as before,
it is the keynote of student enthu
siasm, it is the symbol of Stanford
Spirit. —Julius Berg, *32.

The Editor, Sir:
The editorial "Graduate Schools
Are Athletically Weak," appearing in
the Stanford Daily, Thursday, Novem
ber 22, quite convinced me that they
are. It is likewise evident that Stan
ford is becoming moro and more a
graduate school. And when it does, I
agree that the B. of A. C. will ex
perience "receiptless" Saturdays.

i The strange thing about the edi
torial is not the facts and judgments
presented but the tendency to view
with alarm "that cataclysmic day"
when Stanford will be predominantly
a graduate school and athletics will
take a lower place than the high one
it now occupies.
The University of Chicago and Har
vard are the two horrible examples
cited. It should be noted, however,
that "Chicago is a great educational
institution" still and that Harvard
students "do not give a damn about
the fortunes of the football team,
win, lose, or draw."
Why then should we be wrought up
concerning the future of Stanford
when, by the analogy in the editorial,
it will be a great educational institu
tion attended by students who don't
give a damn about athletics? Presum
ably we have football for the honor
of the school and because the students
love the sport. But if the school does
not need the honor and the students
do not love the sport, why bother
about "Receiptless Saturdays"?
—C. W. B.
One of the many criticisms directed
at higher education in the past few
years is that it is impractical. One
of the outstanding reasons why Stan
ford should be exempted from this
accusation is our bonfire tradition.
A certain school of educators has
set up seven cardinal principles
which represent the ne plus ultra of
what any course should represent. Let
us take them in order and see how
many are represented in the bonfire
activity.
It is perhaps true that a knowledge
of the fundamental subjects is nei
ther necessary for nor developed by
this tradition. But look at the com
pensating factors —health, worthy
home membership, worthy use of lei
sure, ethical training, preparation for
citizenship, and vocational training
(especially for engineers and pre
meds.) —all six of these —count them
—are embodied in, increased by, and
excuses for the pyre building activity.
Accordingly as a matter of far
sighted, educational policy, all the
forces of the University should com
bine in an effort to rebuild our bon
fire. First, the student body should
be segregated into the sheep and the
goats—the latter, of course, repre
senting the conscientious objector ele
ment. This could be done by the use
of the Moot Courts recently inaugu
rated by (he Law School. The depart
ment of Educational Psychology
could do somo fine work by testing
the average intelligence of the sheep
and the goat leaders.
The History Department could jus
tify its existence by having the seml
nnr students chronicle the events. De
! Foe's "Journal of the Plague Year"
offers an example of what English
students might produce. The Military
Department could be used in herding
up the sheep and subduing the goats.
