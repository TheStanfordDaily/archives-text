ow East, Now West. By Susan Ertz.
(D. Appleton and Co. New York.
1928.)
Just about the time that George
Goodall decides that life really is a
very pleasant affair after all, his
clever, pretty young wife drags him
over to Europe. This proves disas
trous to both of them in the end, with
the final solution coming as a tre
mendous surprise to the reader who,
ten to one, has figured out in the first
chapter just what he thinks is going
to happen.
But Susan Ertz is too good a writer
to slip into the obvious. Even in the
character of Althea, which one can
recognize after about three lines, as
the "social climber" type, she uses
such consumate art that this over
worked figure of modern fiction re
veals not the slightest hint of stale
ness.
Miss EJrtz does not permit any of
her characters in the book to be at
tractive, with the possible exception

of the middle-aged widow, Mrs. Good- I
all, whose good looks are matched by i
her intelligence. Otherwise it is a
question whether the reader is more j
irked at the scheming selfishness of !
Althea when, to gain her end, she re-!
sorts to wild tears, and sobs on her j
husband's shoulder, or at the patient j
blindness of George as he soothes her
hair with humble and practiced hand,
and grants her desire. Francis Mort- j
lake, with his insinuating, continental
polish, has a certain charm, but then ;
no one likes a cad, even a very hand- i
some one, and that is what Mortlake j
undeniably is.
The story entertains throughout, i
yet somehow one feels that the char- i
acters are not behaving as real life !
would inevitably have them behave, |
but rather merely as Miss Ertz sees \
fit to allow them. They are pawns in !
the hand of a skilllful writer, and are ■
juggled around over Europe and j
America at her pleasure. The result !
is a book, cold, sophisticated, and i
brittle. —M. L. R.
