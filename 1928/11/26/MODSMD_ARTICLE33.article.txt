So home tonight and never was so
glud to see my bed before in my life, ;
and do wonder il' I can ever sleep off j
my great fatigue. Am now in a quan- \
dary whether such festivities are j
\vo/th while, and am a little fearsome
when I consider the three years of
college life still ahead of me, for how
I did live through Saturday night is
still a miracle, and do not know j
whether I could stand another such. |
To the game Saturday, which con- j
vinced me that I was quite right in
believing the Lord was on our side, I
though for awhile I did not think any- |
one was. And then back across the
bay, sitting in a strange man's lap
every time the suburban trolley went j
around a corner, and across the bay,
wishing fervently my escort had
thought to get reservations on the \
ferry instead of at the Fairmont. j
At the St. Francis late in the eve- !
ning, did see a group of slightly 1
recognizable students digging angle J
worms in the potted palms, which I
did think a childish sport, but refresh-,
ing in the midst of all the sophisti
cated festivities. And did insist upon
riding home in a cable car to the
home of my aunt, for though did trust
the driving of Ay escort of the eve
ning, the San Francisco traffic was j
more like that of Los Angeles with
delirium tremens than aught else, j
Even a cable car seemed safe.
Do plan to spend most of my j
Thanksgiving vacation studying, !
though in the short time I do not see
how I can ever catch up with all the
work everyone else in my classes has
done. And do thing it most fortuitous ;
that this vacation follows the Big
Game, though it may have been by j

forethought of the administration, for
surely the student body will not be
very intellectual or even intelligent
for some days. And so to bed, wishing
devoutly that San Francisco furnished
slot machines with handkerchiefs in
them, like the gum machines, for the
cold in my head is speedily becoming
worse. â€”Hallie Keating.
