# DAILY EDITORS DECIDE TO HOLD YEARLY REUNION
## Thirty Former Editors Hear Telltale Edits Read By Irwin at Fest 
### 
A proposal for an annual gathering
of past editors of the Daily was made
and heartily accepted at the initial
reunion held last Thursday night at
Camille's Restaurant, San Francisco.
Thirty former editors were present.
The reunion was sponsored by the
Daily with funds derived from the
Fall Quarter registration dance which
it sponsored.
Short speeches of reminiscence
were made by all the guests at the
dinner, following the reading of
choice editorials representing each
editor's regime. Tom Irwin, instructor
in journalism and editor in 1923, read
the edits, calling upon the author to
" 'fess up" when he recognized his
effusion. The agony was quick in
most cases, the author shamefacedly
admitting parenthood.
Mr. W. H. B. Fowler, general man
ager of the San Francisco Chronicle,
made a short speech in the course
of which he declared that he would
"rather be editor of the Daily than
captain of the football team."
Friday night, certain of the editors
were guests of the Daiyl at the Foot
ball Gaieties.
The guests at the banquet were:
Archie Rice, Professor E. W. Smith,
C. P. Cutten, Dr. Frank Hinman,
Terry E. Etephenson, A. A. Hampson,
B. C. Dey, W. H. B. Fowler, L. H.
