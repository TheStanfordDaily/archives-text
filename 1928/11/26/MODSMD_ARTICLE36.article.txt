It is hard to imagine that the cus-
I torn of paying $5 for Big Game tickets
; will ever die out. A seat at a game
like Saturday's is a good investmeht
at $5; it brings pleasure, thrills, and
an outdoor spectacle which you would
, nave to go far back in the past to
i duplicate.
Consider how many people con
spire to make the Big Game day
a grea't day for you, Mr., Mrs., or
Miss Reader! The ticket bureaus
have been working steadily since
June first attempting to decide
whom not to give tickets to. The
team has worked out at least
once daily (Sundays excepted)
since the 15th of September; the
Rally Committee has labored long
on stunts, rallies, and the bonfire;
sports writers have for several
weeks been continually flecked
with foam as they have argued
about the strength of the teams
and the likely winner; bootleg
gers have been active; hotel own
ers have been busy thinking up
names for the salads and entrees,
at the same time watching the
budget to make sure they do not
give their full fifteen dollars'
worth. Pop Warner has even con
ceived plays in his dreams. Not
to mention the Daily and Chapar
ral, which have strained every
typewriter getting out editions
suitable to commemorate the day.

M'Lud Frentrup and Daddy Simkins
are our choices to receive posterity's
awe. Simkins is one of the prettiest
passers now playing football on the
Pacific Coast; and he is a great
player in every department of the
game. Frentrup is one of the prancing
est backs that you'll see, and we have
no complaint to make of the way he
nabs passes. Spud Lewis certaintly
gets down under passes in a way to
notice.
Walt Heinecke is uncanny as a fol
lower of the ball; Post and Robesky,
Artman, Tandy, Sellman and Klabau,
Preston and Muller were players
whose work simply warmed your
i heart. It is hard to see what those
; abseure gentlemen are about, but it
j is certainly satisfying when they are
[ successful in their jobs —and distress
ing when they slip up.

And now we have got around
to the starting backfield. There
are a number who have pointed
out how the second half backfield
had drive and the first had not.
We regard Hoffman, Fleishhacker,
Sims, and Wilton as having been
the batterers of the California
line. They did their work, visibly
somewhat negligible, but actual
ly indispensable, during the first
half. Then the speed was injected
and the offensive could commence.
Captain Biff Hoffman, we think,
played a damn good game. How
ever, it must be admitted that
Biff has not been the player this
year that he was last. Nor has
Frank Wilton. Somehow, Wilton's
exhibition was the most disap
pointing of all. Frank was sup
posed to be the Pacific Coast's
greatest halfback this season. Yet
he has never been able to get
away on those sweeping runs
which made Wilton more valuable
to the team last year than Hy
land, whose substitute he was.
Wilton has been a cripple part of
the season; then, too, he has been
worried over his failure to show
up as well as he was supposed to.
* *■ *
Bob Sims is certainly a fighter;
there are few sights to be seen on
the field more picturesque than old
Bob headed for a knot of tacklers as
if his life depended on it. We've seen
Sims turn somersaults from which it
hardly seemed he could escape with
his neck. Yet he always comes up
shaking his head as if asking for
more. A great Stanford player, if you
ask us. —Templeton Peck.

It is hard to imagine that the cus-
I torn of paying $5 for Big Game tickets
; will ever die out. A seat at a game
like Saturday's is a good investmeht
at $5; it brings pleasure, thrills, and
an outdoor spectacle which you would
, nave to go far back in the past to
i duplicate.
Consider how many people con
spire to make the Big Game day
a grea't day for you, Mr., Mrs., or
Miss Reader! The ticket bureaus
have been working steadily since
June first attempting to decide
whom not to give tickets to. The
team has worked out at least
once daily (Sundays excepted)
since the 15th of September; the
Rally Committee has labored long
on stunts, rallies, and the bonfire;
sports writers have for several
weeks been continually flecked
with foam as they have argued
about the strength of the teams
and the likely winner; bootleg
gers have been active; hotel own
ers have been busy thinking up
names for the salads and entrees,
at the same time watching the
budget to make sure they do not
give their full fifteen dollars'
worth. Pop Warner has even con
ceived plays in his dreams. Not
to mention the Daily and Chapar
ral, which have strained every
typewriter getting out editions
suitable to commemorate the day.

M'Lud Frentrup and Daddy Simkins
are our choices to receive posterity's
awe. Simkins is one of the prettiest
passers now playing football on the
Pacific Coast; and he is a great
player in every department of the
game. Frentrup is one of the prancing
est backs that you'll see, and we have
no complaint to make of the way he
nabs passes. Spud Lewis certaintly
gets down under passes in a way to
notice.
Walt Heinecke is uncanny as a fol
lower of the ball; Post and Robesky,
Artman, Tandy, Sellman and Klabau,
Preston and Muller were players
whose work simply warmed your
i heart. It is hard to see what those
; abseure gentlemen are about, but it
j is certainly satisfying when they are
[ successful in their jobs —and distress
ing when they slip up.

And now we have got around
to the starting backfield. There
are a number who have pointed
out how the second half backfield
had drive and the first had not.
We regard Hoffman, Fleishhacker,
Sims, and Wilton as having been
the batterers of the California
line. They did their work, visibly
somewhat negligible, but actual
ly indispensable, during the first
half. Then the speed was injected
and the offensive could commence.
Captain Biff Hoffman, we think,
played a damn good game. How
ever, it must be admitted that
Biff has not been the player this
year that he was last. Nor has
Frank Wilton. Somehow, Wilton's
exhibition was the most disap
pointing of all. Frank was sup
posed to be the Pacific Coast's
greatest halfback this season. Yet
he has never been able to get
away on those sweeping runs
which made Wilton more valuable
to the team last year than Hy
land, whose substitute he was.
Wilton has been a cripple part of
the season; then, too, he has been
worried over his failure to show
up as well as he was supposed to.

Bob Sims is certainly a fighter;
there are few sights to be seen on
the field more picturesque than old
Bob headed for a knot of tacklers as
if his life depended on it. We've seen
Sims turn somersaults from which it
hardly seemed he could escape with
his neck. Yet he always comes up
shaking his head as if asking for
more. A great Stanford player, if you
ask us. —Templeton Peck.
