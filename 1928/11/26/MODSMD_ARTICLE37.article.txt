## Two Eastern Captains 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Behold two leaders of men, cap
tains of prominent football elevens,
whose meeting last Saturday has the
whole Atlantic seaboard talking. Did
Princeton ever schedule a game after
the Yale game within the memory of
man, or did the Navy ever play its
last contest of the regular season
with any team besides the Army be
fore? Not unless this cartooner is
mistaken, and that's why the meet
ing between Captain Howe, of Prince
ton, and Captain Burke, of the Navy,
has the whole East talking.
Consider Eddie Burke, tousle-haired
leader of Bill Ingram's sailors. Eddie
grew up around the coal-breakers of
northeastern Pennsylvania. No, he
didn't exactly work in the mines, but
he palled around with the boys who

did, and it was rough palling too, so I
he had to learn to use his fists, and '
to use them well. The fact that Eddie J
is light-heavyweight boxing champ of 1
the Naval Academy shows that he is |
no slouch as a fighter. He plays guard !
on the Navy team, and is a finished j
linesman.
"Chuck" Howe, Princeton center (
I and captain, reminds one of McMil
i |
lan, greatest snapper-back in Old Nas
sau's history, and is looked upon as
the leading center in the East, al- j
i though Hall of the Army could prob-1
| ably give him an argument. '-'Chuck" j
completely outplayed Barratt, 245- j
pound Ohio State pivot man, called ,
the best center in the Big Ten. Much I
of the success of Bill Roper's team
! this year is due to the fine playing
and leadership of "Chuck" Howe.
