SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 25. (>P) —
The Examiner today declared that the
name of Will Rogers, actor and humor
ist, had been withdrawn by his sponsor
from nomination as an associate member
of the exclusive Bohemian Club of San
Francisco.
The newspaper reported that among
the reasons for the withdrawal was an
accusation that while Rogers was a "dis
tinguished guest" of the club at its an
nual High Jinks last August he "stole
the show" by occupying the limelight for
an hour and a half instead of keeping
to the five minutes alloted to him.
Rogers, according to the newspapers,
kept in the middle of the calcium-lighted
circle so long that numerous other ce
lebrities were crowded off the schedule.
It further declared that Rogers aroused
the feelings of the members when he re
ferred to the High Jinks in a syndicated
newspaper article as a form of week-end

divertisement for tired business men |
from which it took them about twoj
weeks to recover.
The article did not name Rogers' j
sponsor.
