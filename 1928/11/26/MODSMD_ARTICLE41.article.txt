# Tryouts For Sophomore Play To Be Held Tonight At 7 O'Clock Says Davis
##

"I would like to see all sophomores
interested in dramatics appear at the
tryouts for the Sophomore Play to
night at 7 o'clock in the Assembly
Hall," said Gordon Davis in announc
ing the third series of tryouts for the
play.
Third tryouts are being held be
cause it is believed that the extra
pressure of activities and excitement
last week kept a number of sopho
mores from attending the previous
ones. Tonight all sophomores will
have an opportunity of trying out for
the mystery play to be given on
December 8.
The students who have passed the
preliminary tryouts are asked to re
port in the Assembly .Hall tonight at
7 o'clock.
