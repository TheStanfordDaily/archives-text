# GAIETIES OF 1928 ACCLAIMED AS OUTSTANDING PRODUCTION
## 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
Long in the history of Football
shows will the 1928 Ram's Head Re
vue be remembered as a distinctly
outstanding production. Although
Gordon Davis' gridiron team played a
rather uneven game in spots last Fri
day night on the Assembly Hall turf,
the distinction, the extraordinary wit,
and the pure artistry of some of the
acts will give the '28 Gaieties an en
viable place in Stanford dramatics. It
is all the more credit to Davis that
the show was prepared in ten days.
Like a silver thread, the art work
of Harold Helvenston brought a new
finesse and touch of beauty to the
performance. The lighting at all times
was excellent, and in particular mo
ments rose to heights unsurpassed
heretofore on the campus stage. One
of these superb touches was the gray
shadow of Mechane, the creation in
the Machinery Ballet, silhouetted
against a background of red, green,
and blue. Throughout the whole show
there were subtle revelations of Hel
venston's influence, one of the most
pleasing being the jazz notes reflected
on the sky in the finale. John New
begin's handling of the lighting was
excellent.
Music Excellent
The music of the show was unusu

ally good, and it was rendered with
abandon and spirit by Bill Worthing
ton's orchestra. "The Land of Jazz,"
by Jack Wiggin, and "Blue Man Sam"
of Jack Meakin's, were the outstand
ing melodies both effectively intro
duced, one by Kathleen Fitz, whose
voice is particularly fitted for the low
Southern crooning of Meakin's num
ber, and the second ended up the
show in a burst of musical enthusiasm.
The Machinery Ballet represented
the artistic height of the Gaieties.
Jack Meakin's music, itself an inno
vation from the jazz music literature
of Football Shows, was distinctly
modern in spirit, and in its disregard
of the natural scale.
Ballet Is Mental Challenge
The ballet proved a mental chal
lenge to the audience. It revealed in
one unit the creative imagination of
Helvenston, for it was he who in
spired the music and he who worked
out the very intricate geometric mo
tions of the chorus. He made a Me
chane, devoid of personality as was
the music, but withal an interpreta
tion in the abstract of the modern
industrial age of steel rivets and
screws. Each individual costume
represented a particular phase of
creating some modern inrustrial struc
ture. This, the most finished Gaieties
number, represented an idea beauti
fully and significantly worked out by
Helvenston, and perfectly executed by
the chorus.
Radio Act Laugh Hit
"Station IXL, Kale Brothers and the
Barnacle" proved the laugh hit of the
show. A masterful satire on broad
casting talent and Stanfordisms, it
was written by Burnell Gould and
Paul Speegle, the product of extraor
dinary wit adn minds keenly alive to
present-day news. Universal in its
appeal, it kept up a continuous flow of
laughter, and this effect was in no
small way due to the spirited per
formances of the co-authors.
Marshall Kirby proved a great fa
vorite with his "Feathered Friends"
lecture, and his interpretation of a
Mauve Moon was something quite
rare in a humorous way. Kirby is a
comedian who can secure laughter
even if he only crosses the stage.
"The Vanishing Orphan," with its
subtle and not-so-subtle implications,
was roaringly received. It will be a
long time before the audience can
forget the "poor 111* innocent" Baby
who wanted to get a "Barr."
Registration Skit Clever
"Registration Day" was a clever
skit with the faculty's make-up com

ing in for special applause. "The
Queen's Washstand" presented Spee
gle as Gordon Davis and also King
Eric VIII with a delightful whimsi
cality in his role. However, the slow
tempo of this skit, as well as "Shave
Me Close," lost a good many laughs.
The "Pin de Siecle" uncovered some
real dramatic ability in Katherine
Keho as the naughty young miss of
'99 Fenton Barrett scored in his
" 'Twas but a Faded Flower."
"Military Maneuvers" again showed
Frances Boone as a very clever
dancer, while "Steps for Two" lacked
deftness and precision. Marquis and
Malmquist- made a good team.

The chorus numbers were a bit i
shaky in the beginning of the show, J
and the lighting was all that saved j
the costumes in the "Black and
White" fantasy. In the finale the
chorus, as well as the orchestra and
audience, came forth in joyful aban- i
don and made this the best of the
chorus numbers. Esthetically, the '28
chorus was particularly effective.
The "Banjo Bums" proved very
popular. The "Cardinal Quartette"
had good voices and it was gratifying I
to hear the Stanford Glee Club sing
so well. The audience expected to |
head Stanford's new song, "Giants in
Red," but to no avail. .
