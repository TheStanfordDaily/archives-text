# SOPHS CHOOSE THRILLER FOR ANNUAL PLAY
## "Haunted House" to Startle Campus; "All For Fun" Says Gordon Davis 
### BURNELL GOULD 
A Mystery Thriller from curtain to
curtain. That is what the sophomores
will present a week from Saturday
as their annual production. "The
Haunted House" by Owen Davis is
the play.
The cast of characters reads like a
roll-call of comedy and melodrama
cleverly interspersed — Morgan, a
tramp; Emily, the Bride, and Jack,
the Groom (not a hostler); Thomas,
the Chauffeur; Isabel, the Girl; Dun
can, the author, and his wife. Ezra,
a country constable, and Ed, a small
town milkman, add a few hilarious
touches to a plot chockful of action.
Grogan, a New York flatfoot, and
Evans, the harrassed father, are two
of the important characters in a cast
in which every part is a good one.
Gordon Davis and the sophomore
committee have chosen a tentative
cast from the tryouts. It is expected
that it will be tomorrow
after an important initial rehearsal
preceded by final decisions on several
of the roles. This will be held this
evening at 7 o'clock in the Little
Theatre.
"The Haunted House," though it
"laid 'em in the aisles" in New York
several years ago, has never been pro
duced in this section. It will serve as
a definite contrast to the colorful and
fantastic satire of "The Devil in the
Cheese" and the rapid-moving bur
lesque and variety of the Big Game
Gaieites.
"Owen Davis is a good workman,"
said the Stanford director. " 'The
Haunted House' is a thriller from the
drop of the hat. It is so much a mys
tery play that it almost burlesques
itself. It has all the tricks and all
the laughs and yells."
"In the Next Room," the sophomore
play produced two years ago, proved
so popular that many requests have
been made since that time for an
other of the same type," Davis stated.
"We are not taking ourselves too
seriously; it is all for fun."
