# BONFIRE CLAIMS TO TOTAL $1200 VINCENTI STATES
## Local Property Owners To Present $400 Bill For Stolen Property 
### 
Claims against the Associated Stu
dents, as a result of the premature
burning of the Big Game Bonfire, total
$1200, according to Student Manager
Louis Vincenti. Besides these mone
tary demands, there is a warrant out
for the arrest of a student for the
theft of a trailer.
A primary claim of $400 is being
presented by the victims of unlawfully
appropriated property, and this along
with the University claims is being
paid by Vincenti out of the A.S.S.U.
account. The Student Body will de
termine later how the burden of the
expenses are to be shared.
Owing to the fact that the Rally
Committee failed to get co-operation
and help from the students in clean
ing up the debris left by the confla
gration, the University has presented
a bill for $300 and made an appeal
for a similar amount for labor, tools,
wire, etc., used in the construction
of the two woodpiles.
In the burning of the first bonfire,
a large number of tools belonging to i
the University were destroyed, and
their replacement will probably
amount to an additional $300. Besides ]
the direct assertions there are still '
a number of minor claims, and re
quests for the return of wagons.
According to the constitution, the
freshman class is to be held responsi
ble for all debts incurred in the con
struction of the bonfire, but as was
the case in 1925, the A.S.S.U. is ex
pected to bear an equal share in the
expenses.
At present, the frosh have $670 in
their treasury. In the two quarters
coming up, dues are to be cut to one
dollar, so that the total will be ap
proximately $1300.
There is a possibility that addition
al claims may be filed against the
student organization for the destruc
tion of the telephone wires, and of
property damage to the Peninsula
Railway by Hallowe'en pranks. The
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co.
is expected to ask for $500 damages,
while the Railway Co. is preparing
to ask $50.
The responsibility for these latter
debts does not rest on the A.S.S.U.,
says Vincenti, and that body refuses
to be held in account.

The responsibility for these latter
debts does not rest on the A.S.S.U.,
says Vincenti, and that body refuses
to be held in account.
Claims against the Associated Stu
dents, as a result of the premature
burning of the Big Game Bonfire, total
$1200, according to Student Manager
Louis Vincenti. Besides these mone
tary demands, there is a warrant out
for the arrest of a student for the
theft of a trailer.
A primary claim of $400 is being
presented by the victims of unlawfully
appropriated property, and this along
with the University claims is being
paid by Vincenti out of the A.S.S.U.
account. The Student Body will de
termine later how the burden of the
expenses are to be shared.
Owing to the fact that the Rally
Committee failed to get co-operation
and help from the students in clean
ing up the debris left by the confla
gration, the University has presented
a bill for $300 and made an appeal
for a similar amount for labor, tools,
wire, etc., used in the construction
of the two woodpiles.
In the burning of the first bonfire,
a large number of tools belonging to i
the University were destroyed, and
their replacement will probably
amount to an additional $300. Besides ]
the direct assertions there are still '
a number of minor claims, and re
quests for the return of wagons.
According to the constitution, the
freshman class is to be held responsi
ble for all debts incurred in the con
struction of the bonfire, but as was
the case in 1925, the A.S.S.U. is ex
pected to bear an equal share in the
expenses.
At present, the frosh have $670 in
their treasury. In the two quarters
coming up, dues are to be cut to one
dollar, so that the total will be ap
proximately $1300.
There is a possibility that addition
al claims may be filed against the
student organization for the destruc
tion of the telephone wires, and of
property damage to the Peninsula
Railway by Hallowe'en pranks. The
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co.
is expected to ask for $500 damages,
while the Railway Co. is preparing
to ask $50.
The responsibility for these latter
debts does not rest on the A.S.S.U.,

to be held in account.
