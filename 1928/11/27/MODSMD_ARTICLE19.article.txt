# WOMEN MEET U.C. SQUAD IN FIRST DEBATE
## Stanford Takes Affirmative That Science Destroys Faith in Theism 
### 
The Stanford women's debating
team changed nineteen opinions to
favor the affirmative of the question
against thirteen opinions changed by
the California speakers in an audience
decision at the debate last night on
"Resolved, That Advanced Science
Tends to Destroy Theistic Faith."
Twelve people still favored the af
firmative side after the debate, which
was the first this year, and thirty
seven retained their belief that sci
ence has not affected religion.
The speakers on the Stanford team,
supporting the affirmative, were Alice
Behner and Isabel Warren. The Uni
versity of California team was com
posed of Evelyn St. Johns and Rose
Terlin. Dr. D. Charles Gardner pre
sided. The largest crowd which has
ever attended a women's debate was
present last night.
Both teams showed an excellent
grasp of the subject in hand, and a
poised stage presence. The Stanford
speakers, who have had no varsity
experience, spoke with a finished
touch. Coached by Eleanor Davidson
and Francis Marshall, they showed
great improvement over their work
earlier in the quarter.
The points were made by the af
firmative that man has outgrown the
need for religion as an incentive for
achievement or for good behavior;
science has replaced religion; and
that science leads the individual to
obey natural laws. The negative side
I advanced the ideas man must have
i faith, it is part of his fundamental
nature; that there is a conscious in
teligence working behind the life and
working of the universe.
Tonight Stanford will uphold the
negative side of this same question
[ at Berkeley.
