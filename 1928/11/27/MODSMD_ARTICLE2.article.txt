### 
MANILA, Nov. 27. (/P)— Reports
over partly restored communication
facilities indicate that the typhoon
•which struck the central islands of
the Philippine archipelago was the
.most severe in the history of the
Philippines. At least twenty-five lives
were lost and the property damage
amounted to millions of dollars.
The typhoon was widespread, its
fury being manifested in the islands
of Luzon, Samar, Romblon, Tablas,
Masbate, Mindoro, Cebu, and Panay.
The roar of the tempest continued
from Thursday until Saturday at
many places, but it swept to the
southward of Manila.
Governor-General Henry L. Stimson
sent a long cablegram to the War De
partment at Washington last night,
stating that the storm was equal in
force to the recent hurricane in Porto
Rico. He said that assistance might
be needed from American relief
agencies.
