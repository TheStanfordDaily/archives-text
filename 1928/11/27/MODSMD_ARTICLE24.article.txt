# SEEKERS OF LUNAR LIGHT DISAPPOINTED BY MOON FADEOUT
## 
### 
"Get out, and get under the
moon."
This was reversed last night,
for Lady moon obliged all lone
ly Stanford students who were
roaming about the cactus gar
den in the midnight hours by
fading gradually and graciously
away until this morning at
12:23 o'clock nothing was left
of her. After a few minutes of
this voluntary withdrawal, the
moon again appeared first as a
crescent, growing into an oval,
and finally regained her former
size at 2:39 o'clock. She had sur
vived a total eclipseâ€”no calami
ties occurred.
This eclipse was visible every
where on the Pacific Coast where
the moon was above the horizon.
It started at 11:24 p.m.
