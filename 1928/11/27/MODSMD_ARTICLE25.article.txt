score was knotted at 8-all. A three
minute play-off was called and during
the extra canto the sophs were able

1931 manager, and Grey, yearling
manager, were the outstanding men
on the floor. Lambert, one of the babe
forwards, also showed up well.
In the preliminary game between
the soph and frosh second teams, the
second-year men again held the long
end of the score to the tune of 12-7.
After being held at 7-7 for over half
the game, the sophomores suddenly
broke away to grab five more points
and cinch the game. Berg and Grace,
yearling forwards, and Smith and
Kelly of the class of '31, were the
luminaries of the second team clash.
"Gary" Garibotto officiated as
referee for both games. Halves were
ten minutes long.
