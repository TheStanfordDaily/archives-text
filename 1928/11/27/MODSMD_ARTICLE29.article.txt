# VARSITY SHOULD BENEFIT BY TRIP EAST FOR GAME
## Physical, Mental Rest Seen For Warner Men Because Of Freedom From Worry Weather Permitting, Cards May Do Better Than They Have So Far This Season 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Stanford's thirty football warriors,
now en route to New York to play
the West Point Cadets next Saturday,
should profit rather than suffer from
the 3,000-mile trip. And if the weather
is favorable they will probably be able
to play a better game than they have
been able to play in their native state
this season.
For one thing, they will be in bet
ter physical and mental condition
than they would be with another
week of strenuous practice which
would only tend to make them "stale."
They are making a leisurely journey
eastwards and are stopping at inter
vals for light workouts. The theory
that a team is handicapped by a long
trip has been blasted more than once,
particularly since Southern California
and Notre Dame played liome-and
home games in Los Angeles in 1926
and in Chicago last year.
With but a few exceptions, the
Cards will be exiled from exterior
annoyances such as from alumni, stu
dents, and sports writers. They can
forget such matters as classwork and
devote all their spare time to study
of the game and to tactics they will
use against the Soldiers. A week of
rest will also give Heinecke, Lewis,
Post, and others a chance to recuper
ate from the scars of the California
battle. Chuck Smalling is expected to
be fully recovered from the flu to be
available Saturday.
The influence of New York will aid
the morale of the team. The players
have more respect for Army's
strength than they had for their op
ponents before the U.S.C. and Cali
fornia contests, but they will be out
to live up to expectations and show
the Gothamites and the East in gen
eral that civilization doesn't cease
just west of the Hudson.
As for the mental condition of the
players, they will be better off in
New York than they would be in
Berkeley or Los Angeles. They will
be in what is not unfriendly territory.
A great portion of the Eastern foot
ball public is impartial; they don't
mind who beats Army just so long
as it is a civilian school. Then too,
1 some of the players will be in a bet
ter mood than possible at home where
former Stanford halfbacks with jour
nalistic "talent" are critically watch
ing every move of their successors.
The thought that they will be razzed
for everything they do, hinders tem
peramental players. The Cardinal
squad contains at least one such
player whose whole season has been
wrecked by such criticism from the
press box.
A great deal depends on weather
conditions, not that the cold of early
December is sharp enough to serious
ly affect the players themselves, but
that the weather will decide the con
dition of the field. Frozen ground is
slippery; thawed ground is always
sloppy after the first snow. A slug
gish field will aid the Cardinals on
defense in that it will stop Chris
Cagle, star of the Cadet backfield, but
it will handicap Stanford on offense,
for most of Pop's plays depend large
ly on speed for successful execution.
