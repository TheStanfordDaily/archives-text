# What Shall We Do With The Bonfire?
## 
### 
Say what you will about bonfires, no one can definitely estimate what
effect the enforced rebuilding of the pyre had in the evident recrudes
ccnce of Stanford spirit manifest last Saturday at the Big Game. The
rooting was certainly better than it was at the U.S.C. game; but, then,
last Saturday's section was soberer, less fatigued physically, and more
uncertain as to the outcome of the game.
Whether Big Game bonfires are desirable is a question which should
now, in the light of the recent blaze, as it were, be settled. Patently, the
system of leaving the building and guarding of the bonfire to the fresh
men is unsatisfactory. Twice in one college generation the pile has been
prematurely touched off and an orgy of fevered rebuilding commenced
thereby. Every year an attempt is made at some time or other during
the three weeks of preparation to burn the fire. A better way to build it,
if it must be built, would be to enlist the whole student body in a giant
effort to build the bonfire on the day of the Big Game rally. That method
would give everyone the spirit which the Rally Committee pleads for, and
it would cure the evil of keeping freshmen out at all hours of day and
night, neglecting classes for weeks.
A writer in yesterday's Palo Alto Times brings up a good argument.
He says:"I think it (the bonfire) is a sinful waste of energy and, more
regretfully, of a large quantity of good fuel. When you think of the
number of needy families which could be kept warm through the winter
by that pile which is burnt in one night over at the campus, it makes you
stop and wonder if the fire is a worth-while tradition after all. In the last
couple of months I have heard of several families which are needy and I
feel that those few are but a small fraction of the number hard put to
keep the home fire burning."
The bonfire which went up in smoke last Wednesday night will cost
the student body in the neighborhood of $1200, according to an estimate
made by Student Manager Louis Vincenti. The University is charging
about $300 to clean up the mess which was left; $300 more was incurred
in expenses for tools, wire, nails, and gasoline for the trucks. Claims for
$400 covering loss of property wrongfully appropriated have come in,
swelling the present sad total to $1000 —and there is sure to be more.
The students are faced with a problem with this bonfire: should it be
abolished ? should it be built by the entire student body in a day or two,
even if at the sacrifice of size? or should it be built —as too often it has—
twice a year ?

in expenses for tools, wire, nails, and gasoline for the trucks. Claims for
$400 covering loss of property wrongfully appropriated have come in,
swelling the present sad total to $1000 —and there is sure to be more.
The students are faced with a problem with this bonfire: should it be
abolished ? should it be built by the entire student body in a day or two,
even if at the sacrifice of size? or should it be built —as too often it has—
twice a year ?
Say what you will about bonfires, no one can definitely estimate what
effect the enforced rebuilding of the pyre had in the evident recrudes
ccnce of Stanford spirit manifest last Saturday at the Big Game. The
rooting was certainly better than it was at the U.S.C. game; but, then,
last Saturday's section was soberer, less fatigued physically, and more
uncertain as to the outcome of the game.
Whether Big Game bonfires are desirable is a question which should
now, in the light of the recent blaze, as it were, be settled. Patently, the
system of leaving the building and guarding of the bonfire to the fresh
men is unsatisfactory. Twice in one college generation the pile has been
prematurely touched off and an orgy of fevered rebuilding commenced
thereby. Every year an attempt is made at some time or other during
the three weeks of preparation to burn the fire. A better way to build it,
if it must be built, would be to enlist the whole student body in a giant
effort to build the bonfire on the day of the Big Game rally. That method
would give everyone the spirit which the Rally Committee pleads for, and
it would cure the evil of keeping freshmen out at all hours of day and
night, neglecting classes for weeks.
A writer in yesterday's Palo Alto Times brings up a good argument.
He says:"I think it (the bonfire) is a sinful waste of energy and, more
regretfully, of a large quantity of good fuel. When you think of the
number of needy families which could be kept warm through the winter
by that pile which is burnt in one night over at the campus, it makes you
stop and wonder if the fire is a worth-while tradition after all. In the last
couple of months I have heard of several families which are needy and I
feel that those few are but a small fraction of the number hard put to
keep the home fire burning."
The bonfire which went up in smoke last Wednesday night will cost
the student body in the neighborhood of $1200, according to an estimate
made by Student Manager Louis Vincenti. The University is charging
about $300 to clean up the mess which was left; $300 more was incurred
in expenses for tools, wire, nails, and gasoline for the trucks. Claims for
$400 covering loss of property wrongfully appropriated have come in,
swelling the present sad total to $1000 —and there is sure to be more.
