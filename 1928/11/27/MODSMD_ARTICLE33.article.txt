# They Left Us At Home
## 
### 
It is a great blow to our pride to admit that we shall be unable to
give the campus our own interpretation of the Army game next Saturday.
We should have liked to send a reporter East with the team to cover
the contest, but the Board of Athletic Control didn't see it that way.
The Board, you know, is paying the expenses of the five San Francisco
sports writers who are members of the Stanford entourage bound for
New York. But when it came to admitting a sixth writer to the party
—that was just too hard on the purse. The B.A.C. is sending the San
Francisco writers East simply to get their good-will. If the San Fran
cisco newspapers point out to the public how much easier it is to come
down to Stanford by train than to go to Berkeley by ferry and electric
car, attendance at football games here will increase, and these five fares
will quickly be paid for. The Board is making a shrewd business move,
but it assumes that it has the Daily's good will (or perhaps that it doesn't
need it), with the result that it ignores this journal in making up its
complement of "trained" observers.
The Daily realizes that the Board is running close to the limit of its
income, but it wishes to make the point that the Board gives too little
consideration to student organizations and student connections with ath
letics. Graduate Manager A 1 Masters refused to send Yell Leader Scott
Webster to the Oregon game early in the season, and again refused to
send him to New York for the game next Saturday. It seems to us to be
clear that the yell leader should at least be sent to every game Stanford
plays on the Pacific Coast. The Idaho yell leaders created a stir at Kezar;
is there good reason why Stanford should not attempt to leave good
impressions with far-off student bodies when the team goes visiting?
The presence of a yell leader might take away some of the sting of
defeat left by the football team.
And furthermore, when they're passing around free trips to New
York again, we should like the Board to know that the Daily's applica
tion is automatically in—and its dues paid.
