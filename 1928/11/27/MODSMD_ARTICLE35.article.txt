"Lombardi Ltd." —Alcazar.
. This comedy is one of the best plays
Henry Duffy has ever presented—and
it is one that is absolutely guaranteed
to please. Leo Carillo, the original
star, once more plays the role of Tito
Lombardi, the volatile Italian dress
designer whose kindness threatens to
bankrupt a flourishing gown shop. His
characterization is perfect. He speaks
with just the right accent to get the
laughs, and delights with his naive,
lovable ways.
Rewritten by the original authors,
"Lombardi Ltd." is as amusing a show
as any you can find today. All three
acts are set in Tioto's shop, and this
gives an opportunity to display many
gorgeous gowns. There are a number
01 models to show the latest styles,
and both the women and the clothes
are beautiful.
While the whole show centers
around Leo Carillo, Mr. Duffy has
provided an unusually noted support
ing cast.
Helen Ferguson, of movie fame, is
the leading lady—and a most attrac
tive one. She is very pretty, and
makes the best of a role which offers
rather limited opportunities. Barbara
Luddy is extremely funny as the new
acts are set in Tito's shop, and this
pared to "sacrifice all" for the sake
of fame and fortune. Miss Luddy's
scenes with Gale Gordon, who plays
her ardent admirer, were high-spots
in the show.
Margaret Landis gets many laughs
from a small part, that of a perfect
3G model who has a wonderful figure
which she can't take out to eat for
fear of gaining weight. William Dills,
as the fussy old bookkeeper who tries
to make Tito listen to business, is
excellent. There are nineteen, alto
gether, in the cast, and each role is
handled well.
"Lombardi Ltd." and Leo Carillo
are something you must not pass by.

Lady Godiva: The Future of Naked
ness. By John Langdon-Davies.
(New York: Harper and Broth
ers, 1928. $2.)
May we present you a diverting
blend of spoofing and common sense?
With much sound truth, and also
much extravagance, Mr. Langdon-
Davies presents the case for nudity.
He takes up the club not merely for
artistic nudity, or stage nudity, or
bathing-beach nudity, but for a uni
versal nudity, a complete and easy
elimination of all clothes.
The serious bases for the argument
in favor of clotheslessness are not
particularly startling or new. Almost
everyone knows that sun and air have
a health-giving effect upon the human
body.
Less generally accepted, perhaps,
but certainly a matter of knowledge,
is the fact that with human beings as
with birds, clothes are counted upon
to enhance, rather than diminish,
what may be biologically stated as
the creature's mating charm. This
' point is stressed entertainingly, espe
cially in the story of the primitive
people which refuses to allow its wo
men to wear any garment, because
they become too attractive to strang
ers when clothed. But his insistence
that nakedness is not immoral is by
no means shocking to us. We have,
all of us, an inhibited hankering to
parade sans everything.
When we are told, however, that j
we can be comfortable without clothes
in the winter climate of the United
States and England, we are shocked
into shivering, indeed. The proponent
of nakedness here becomes totally
unconvincing.
All in all, this book is diverting, as
we said at the start. But it is not par- j
ticularly shocking. We can't help but |
agree, deep down inside, with much i
of it. The scattering of sense and ,
nonsense lends interest to what might
be a dull sort of arguing.

around Leo Carillo, Mr. Duffy has
provided an unusually noted support
ing cast.
Helen Ferguson, of movie fame, is
the leading lady—and a most attrac
tive one. She is very pretty, and
makes the best of a role which offers
rather limited opportunities. Barbara
Luddy is extremely funny as the new
acts are set in Tito's shop, and this
pared to "sacrifice all" for the sake
of fame and fortune. Miss Luddy's
scenes with Gale Gordon, who plays
her ardent admirer, were high-spots
in the show.
Margaret Landis gets many laughs
from a small part, that of a perfect
3G model who has a wonderful figure
which she can't take out to eat for
fear of gaining weight. William Dills,
as the fussy old bookkeeper who tries
to make Tito listen to business, is
excellent. There are nineteen, alto
gether, in the cast, and each role is
handled well.
"Lombardi Ltd." and Leo Carillo
are something you must not pass by.

Lady Godiva: The Future of Naked
ness. By John Langdon-Davies.
(New York: Harper and Broth
ers, 1928. $2.)
May we present you a diverting
blend of spoofing and common sense?
With much sound truth, and also
much extravagance, Mr. Langdon-
Davies presents the case for nudity.
He takes up the club not merely for
artistic nudity, or stage nudity, or
bathing-beach nudity, but for a uni
versal nudity, a complete and easy
elimination of all clothes.
The serious bases for the argument
in favor of clotheslessness are not
particularly startling or new. Almost
everyone knows that sun and air have
a health-giving effect upon the human
body.
Less generally accepted, perhaps,
but certainly a matter of knowledge,
is the fact that with human beings as
with birds, clothes are counted upon
to enhance, rather than diminish,
what may be biologically stated as
the creature's mating charm. This
' point is stressed entertainingly, espe
cially in the story of the primitive
people which refuses to allow its wo
men to wear any garment, because
they become too attractive to strang
ers when clothed. But his insistence
that nakedness is not immoral is by
no means shocking to us. We have,
all of us, an inhibited hankering to
parade sans everything.
When we are told, however, that j
we can be comfortable without clothes
in the winter climate of the United
States and England, we are shocked
into shivering, indeed. The proponent
of nakedness here becomes totally
unconvincing.
All in all, this book is diverting, as
we said at the start. But it is not par- j
ticularly shocking. We can't help but |
agree, deep down inside, with much i
of it. The scattering of sense and ,
nonsense lends interest to what might
be a dull sort of arguing.
—Clifford F. Weigle.
"Lombardi Ltd." —Alcazar.
. This comedy is one of the best plays
Henry Duffy has ever presented—and
it is one that is absolutely guaranteed
to please. Leo Carillo, the original
star, once more plays the role of Tito
Lombardi, the volatile Italian dress
designer whose kindness threatens to
bankrupt a flourishing gown shop. His
characterization is perfect. He speaks
with just the right accent to get the
laughs, and delights with his naive,
lovable ways.
Rewritten by the original authors,
"Lombardi Ltd." is as amusing a show
as any you can find today. All three
acts are set in Tioto's shop, and this
gives an opportunity to display many
gorgeous gowns. There are a number
01 models to show the latest styles,
and both the women and the clothes
are beautiful.

Lady Godiva: The Future of Naked
ness. By John Langdon-Davies.
(New York: Harper and Broth
ers, 1928. $2.)
May we present you a diverting
blend of spoofing and common sense?
With much sound truth, and also
much extravagance, Mr. Langdon-
Davies presents the case for nudity.
He takes up the club not merely for
artistic nudity, or stage nudity, or
bathing-beach nudity, but for a uni
versal nudity, a complete and easy
elimination of all clothes.
The serious bases for the argument
in favor of clotheslessness are not
particularly startling or new. Almost
everyone knows that sun and air have
a health-giving effect upon the human
body.
Less generally accepted, perhaps,
but certainly a matter of knowledge,
is the fact that with human beings as
with birds, clothes are counted upon
to enhance, rather than diminish,
what may be biologically stated as
the creature's mating charm. This
' point is stressed entertainingly, espe
cially in the story of the primitive
people which refuses to allow its wo
men to wear any garment, because
they become too attractive to strang
ers when clothed. But his insistence
that nakedness is not immoral is by
no means shocking to us. We have,
all of us, an inhibited hankering to
parade sans everything.
When we are told, however, that j
we can be comfortable without clothes
in the winter climate of the United
States and England, we are shocked
into shivering, indeed. The proponent
of nakedness here becomes totally
unconvincing.
All in all, this book is diverting, as
we said at the start. But it is not par- j
ticularly shocking. We can't help but |
agree, deep down inside, with much i
of it. The scattering of sense and ,
nonsense lends interest to what might
be a dull sort of arguing.
—Clifford F. Weigle.
"Lombardi Ltd." —Alcazar.
. This comedy is one of the best plays
Henry Duffy has ever presented—and
it is one that is absolutely guaranteed
to please. Leo Carillo, the original
star, once more plays the role of Tito
Lombardi, the volatile Italian dress
designer whose kindness threatens to
bankrupt a flourishing gown shop. His
characterization is perfect. He speaks
with just the right accent to get the
laughs, and delights with his naive,
lovable ways.
Rewritten by the original authors,
"Lombardi Ltd." is as amusing a show
as any you can find today. All three
acts are set in Tioto's shop, and this
gives an opportunity to display many
gorgeous gowns. There are a number
01 models to show the latest styles,
and both the women and the clothes
are beautiful.
While the whole show centers
around Leo Carillo, Mr. Duffy has
provided an unusually noted support
ing cast.
Helen Ferguson, of movie fame, is
the leading lady—and a most attrac
tive one. She is very pretty, and
makes the best of a role which offers
rather limited opportunities. Barbara
Luddy is extremely funny as the new
acts are set in Tito's shop, and this
pared to "sacrifice all" for the sake
of fame and fortune. Miss Luddy's
scenes with Gale Gordon, who plays
her ardent admirer, were high-spots
in the show.
Margaret Landis gets many laughs
from a small part, that of a perfect
3G model who has a wonderful figure
which she can't take out to eat for
fear of gaining weight. William Dills,
as the fussy old bookkeeper who tries
to make Tito listen to business, is
excellent. There are nineteen, alto
gether, in the cast, and each role is
handled well.
