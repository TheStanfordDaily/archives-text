The Editor, Sir:
Why is it that many members of
the Men's Rooting Section have to
give vent to their feelings with such
filthy language? Do they think that
it makes them real "he men"? If this
is their excuse, may I dispel their il
lusions by remarking that I have
spent my share of time in lumber
camps, as well as in construction
camps of various sorts, where one
would expect to find such "he men,"
and never have I heard such rotten
ness pour forth from any person's
mouth as it is the USUAL thing to
hear while sitting in or near the
Stanford Men's Rooting Section.
Where do the men(?) get this idea
that in order to show enthusiasm they
have to use abusive language? To
say that it is childish is the very
mildest criticism that can be made.
I don't pretend to be a modern Polly
ynna in the disguise of a male, but
it certainly does shock my sense of
decency to be amongst a group of
men who literally shout such filth for
all to hear. If for no other reason,
this ought to be stopped out of re
spect to the women who have to sit
in the vicinity of the source of such
disgusting outbursts.
—John O. Palstine.
The Editor, Sir: Here's a rumor or
a Rig Game graft that's sort of grip
ing to those of us who can't get in
on the gravy. We have been told that
one man at the game cleared over
$500 and that another man cleared

$130 because they had the good for
tune to have something to do with
the sale of official programs.
It seems that prospective suckers
with a pocket-full of dough to trade
for admission to the Big Game would
confide their troubles to one of these
men in charge of program salesmen.
He would then feel so sorry that the
old grad couldn't get into the oval
that for a mere pittance of $5, $10, or
?15 he would get him in the stadium
in the guise of a program salesman.
When the grad got inside he would
hand back his armful of programs
to the solicitous youth and find a
seat in the aisle.
We aren't by any means trying to
raise any stink about this last Big
Game; we are merely bringing this
up with the suggestion that in the
future care be taken to carefully
check up every program salesman get
ting into the game. —Tip.

is their excuse, may I dispel their il
lusions by remarking that I have
spent my share of time in lumber
camps, as well as in construction
camps of various sorts, where one
would expect to find such "he men,"
and never have I heard such rotten
ness pour forth from any person's
mouth as it is the USUAL thing to
hear while sitting in or near the
Stanford Men's Rooting Section.
Where do the men(?) get this idea
that in order to show enthusiasm they
have to use abusive language? To
say that it is childish is the very
mildest criticism that can be made.
I don't pretend to be a modern Polly
ynna in the disguise of a male, but
it certainly does shock my sense of
decency to be amongst a group of
men who literally shout such filth for
all to hear. If for no other reason,
this ought to be stopped out of re
spect to the women who have to sit
in the vicinity of the source of such
disgusting outbursts.
—John O. Palstine.
The Editor, Sir: Here's a rumor or
a Rig Game graft that's sort of grip
ing to those of us who can't get in
on the gravy. We have been told that
one man at the game cleared over
$500 and that another man cleared

$130 because they had the good for
tune to have something to do with
the sale of official programs.
It seems that prospective suckers
with a pocket-full of dough to trade
for admission to the Big Game would
confide their troubles to one of these
men in charge of program salesmen.
He would then feel so sorry that the
old grad couldn't get into the oval
that for a mere pittance of $5, $10, or
?15 he would get him in the stadium
in the guise of a program salesman.
When the grad got inside he would
hand back his armful of programs
to the solicitous youth and find a
seat in the aisle.
We aren't by any means trying to
raise any stink about this last Big
Game; we are merely bringing this
up with the suggestion that in the
future care be taken to carefully
check up every program salesman get
ting into the game. —Tip.
The Editor, Sir:
Why is it that many members of
the Men's Rooting Section have to
give vent to their feelings with such
filthy language? Do they think that
it makes them real "he men"? If this

camps of various sorts, where one
would expect to find such "he men,"
