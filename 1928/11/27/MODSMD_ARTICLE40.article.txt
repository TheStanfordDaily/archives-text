November 26th—
Did hear the author of the article
on women, in the new Stanford Liter
ary Magazine, remark that next year
she would be sophisticated and retire
early the night of the Big Game, and
do think that is a sage remark for it
j is pitiful to see the results of deter
| mined dissipation on that evening,
| and do think that staying awake late
is more naive than experienced. Some-
I how most of my activities seem very
flat today, and suppose that 1 have
been intoxicated these last two weeks
with the Stanford spirit which peo
ple are so worried about, for now
that I look back upon these last days,
when I thought I was so excessively
busy and important, I find that I did
not really do anything at all, but per
haps when I recover some of my lost
sleep I may find some of my lost en
thusiasm.

Did hear that Branner Hall was
being equipped as an emergency iso
lation hospital, and cannot think of a
pleasanter place to be quarantined,
what with the garden outside, for 1
do remember that lobby as one of
the pleasantest places for dances on
the campus; though suppose the flu
id a little different from dancing. Am
inclined to think, however, that it
would be almost lucky to be ill at
this point in the quarter, for Lord!
the work that I have yet to make up
frcm illicit cutting is so tremendous
that even a broken leg would scarcely
give me time to finish it.

Do wish most mightily that I could
see the performance of George Arliss
in "The Merchant of Venice" at San
Jose, for next week when it comes to
San Francisco I shall probably be
even busier than I am now, and it is
so much easier to find a legitimate ex
cuse for spending an evening near
home than finding rationalization for
San Francisco, particularly with the
intriguacies. of late leaves to be ar
ranged in regard to the city. Which
leads me to think, in a roundabout
| way, that the distributors of Gideon

] Bibles would bo doing a much more
constructive work if they would do
-1 nate dictionaries to all college rooms,
: for my spelling is getting worse and
worse, and even my instructor in
bonehead English has stopped being
polite about it.
