Professor Fay has recently pub
lished a book concerning Franklin,
upon which he has been working for
several years. He portrays the famous
American as a significant representa
tive of the eighteenth century, since
he is particularly interested in the
intellectual development of France
during this period, it will be from the
French point of view and concerning
the effect that Franklin had upon the
thought of France that Professor Fay
will depict Poor Richard.
During the last two years Professor
Fay has been in the United States
studying and acting as visiting pro
fessor at Columbia University. At
present he is studying at the Hunting
ton Library near Los Angeles. To
night will be the second time that he
has appeared on the Tuesday evening
lecture series.
In June 1927 he spoke at Stanford
on "Internationalism versus Cosmo
politanism in Contemporary French
Literature." He has done a great deal
of work in the field of modern French
literature as well as \n the history of
the development of thought during
earlier centuries.
