# LINDBERGH KEEPS ARRIVAL SECRET AS PUBLIC WAITS

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, Nov. 26. (£>)
— Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh was
back at his alma mater, Kelly Field,
for a brief homecoming visit today.
The belated midnight announcement
of his arrival yesterday by air from
Tampico, Mexico, set at rest charac
teristic public concern for his safety,
which had been felt over the week
end.
The flier, his month's hunting and
flying vacation in Mexico at an end,
is en route to New York for which i
point he probably will hop today.
In evident determination to stay out
of the limelight while going about his
personal business, the Colonel did not j
see newspapermen here and whether
intentional or otherwise, his visit re
maind secret for eight hours, during
which time an anxious vigil was kept
in south Texas and fear for his safety
was felt in two nations.
