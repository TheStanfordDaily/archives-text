Pipe Tobacco
San Francisco, Cal.

Gentlemen:
Since I first started to smoke, I
have always smoked cigarettes.
One day SHE said to me "Ed,
dear, why don't you smoke a pipe. I
think those long straight-stemmed
pipes are so manly-looking."
So, naturally, I had to buy a long
stemmed pipe and a can of well, we'll
call it "Blubs Mixture tobacco." Im
mediately with a certain feeling of
pride in my new pipe, I "lighted up"
and proceeded to have my tongue bit
ten. I tried almost every brand I had
ever heard of, but none satisfied me.
Sadly, I had to confess to HER that
as a pipe smoker I was a good die
titian.
"Did you try Edgeworth?" she
asked. "That is what dad smokes,
and he's always smoked a pipe."
So 1 was forced to try Edgeworth,
and all that I can say is that if every
fellow that has tried to accustom him
self to a pipe, started with Edgeworth,
there would be very few that would go
back to cigarettes.
Yours sincerely,
Ed Maher
