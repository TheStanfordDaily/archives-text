780 000 Chesterfield cigarettes are now sailing
* South-Polewards with the Byrd Antarc
tic Expedition. We are officially informed that the selection
of Chesterfield resulted from the individually expressed
preferences of a majority of the expedition's members.
When it is recalled that these are—in superlative sense
— picked men . . . selected not only for bravery, ability
and experience, but also by searching tests of physical
fitness. ..we may be forgiven for our considerable pride
in their vote. And something of this pride, we believe,
will be shared by all Chesterfield smokers.
It is another of the many proofs piling up that the
surest way to earn popularity is to deserve it!
MILD enough for anybody .. and yet .. THEY SATISFY
