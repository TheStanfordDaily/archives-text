# COUNCIL DECIDES ON PENALTY FOR "BIG C PAINTER"
## McElwain Is Given Choice of Three Sentences For His Supposed Guilt in Affair Refuses to Discuss Alleged Participation in Colorful Work Night Before Rally 
### 
In deference to the existing intercol
legiate agreement between Stanford and
the University of California, the Men's
Council reached a decision yesterday aft
ernoon in the case of Lester McElwain,
whose wallet was found near California's
Big C on the night of November 20, fol
lowing its painting supposedly by a group
of Stanford men.
Basing their decision on the agreement
between the two universities, the Coun
cil gave McElwain a choice of three pen
alties :
(1) Withdrawing from the University
for the balance of the present (fall)
quarter.
(2) Finishing the present quarter and
withdrawal from the University for the
full winter quarter.
(3) An assignment of 300 working
hours at the Convalescent Home to be
•completed before the beginning of the
spring quarter.
McElwain, when questioned by the
Council, refused to comment on the sub
ject. He made no effort to defend him
self, so the Council took his attitude as
an admission of guilt in the affair.
The Council has evidence that eleven
-other men participated in the colorful
work of November 20, but are making no
attempt to discover these. However, it
was stated at the meeting, that if the
parties concerned would admit their guilt
and aid McElwain in his 300 hours of
labor, it would work no real hardship on
anyone, as each man would have only
twenty-five hours work to complete at
the Convalescent Home before the begin
ning of spring quarter.
Following is a copy of the agreement
•between Stanford and the University of
California:
Any disturbance, any act of van
dalism, or any defacement of property
on the University of California campus
committed by a Stanford student or
students is prohibited, and may be pun
ished by expulsion from the Unviersity
for the quarter in which the act oc
curred, or by such other disciplinary
measures on which the Men's Council
for students may dccide.
