# SOPHOMORES CHOSEN FOR CLASS PLAY
## "The Haunted House" Will Give Campus Thrills On December 8 
### JOHN ROGERS 
After a strenuous session of tryout
rehearsals yesterday, Gordon Davis se
lected the following cast for the sopho
more play, "The Haunted House," Owen
Davis' comedy-mystery thriller, which
will be presented in the Assembly Hall
December 8.
The complete cast, with the correspond
ing parts, is:
Morgan, the Tramp Bill Scott
Emily, the Bride Anne Frick
Jack, the Groom Bob Kirkwood
Thomas, the Chauffeur Charles Brink
Duncan, the Author Tom Henry
Helen, the Wife Katherine Keho
Isabel, the Girl Elizabeth Cooper
Ezra, the Constable Burnell Gould
Ed, the Milkman Joe Thompson
Grogan, the Detective Henry Lane
Evans, the Father Irving Rosenblatt
The Sophomore Play is the one re
maining production that is strictly lim
ited to members of a particular class, as
the Junior Opera and the Senior Farce
have long since gone to the other classes
for aid in filling their casts. This year,
due to the quantity and quality of dra
matic talent in the class of '31, Davis'
usual trouble of finding enough material
with which to cast the play was reversed
to the unusual one of trying to find the
best out of a large ntunber of excellent
actors, he reports.
While "The Haunted House" is not a
new drama —it "knocked 'em dead" in
New York several seasons ago—this is
the first time it will have been produced
in this part of the country. Properly
speaking, it is more than just another
mystery play. It out-mystifies the usual
mystery, it out-thrills the usual thriller—
in fact, it is almost a burlesque on this
type of drama that has always proved
popular with the American public. It
has all the startling effects of howls in
the dark and falling bodies and disap
pearing hands, with a few choice bits
added for good measure.
