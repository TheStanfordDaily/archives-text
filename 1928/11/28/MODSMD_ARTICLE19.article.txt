# HOOVER'S VIEWS NEEDED IN FARM RELIEF QUESTION
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.
Bert Hoover may be called upon by
some Congressional leaders to take a
hand in the controversy raging at the
Capitol as to whether farm relief
shall be disposed of at this approach
ing short session or await the leisure
of the extra session promised by the
President-Elect if action is not now
forthcoming.
Returning from his South American
cruise probably in January, it appears
likely that Mr. Hoover will find him
self in this unique, if not embarras
sing, position while Calvin Coolidge
is still at the helm.
From the White House word came
today that Mr. Coolidge had been un
able to decide what the majority
opinion of the wrangling Congression
al leaders appeared to be on this
question. He feels that agreement on
a farm bill by members of Congress
and others interested in the legislation
is the first prerequisite to immediate
action.
Meanwhile the scattered forces at
the Capitol are inquiring eagerly if
there is a spokesman in Washington
for Hoover. The answer comes just as
often as it is asked that there is ap
parently no spokesman for the Presi
dent-Elect.
It is felt at the Capitol in adminis
tration circles that the farm relief
and tariff issues were among the most
important of the Hoover campaign
and that inasmuch as he probably will
be held responsilbe for legislation on
the two questions the far-away Presi
dent-Elect should be consulted and
should indicate his views.
