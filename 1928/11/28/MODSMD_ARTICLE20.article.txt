### 
TORT ANGELES, Wash., Nov. 27.
(yp)â€”A huge section of a sailing ship
hull which had been adrift in the
Strait of Juan T)e Fuca' was beached
here today by Coast Guard patrol
boats. The derelict, which has been
menacing shipping entering Puget
Sound, apparently had once been fast
to a roof. Its heavily reinforced tim
bers were badly rotted bolow the
waterline. There was no indication of
the name of the craft from which it
had come.
