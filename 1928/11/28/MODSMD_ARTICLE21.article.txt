# BEAR ROOTER ASKS EXCHANGE OF CARD CAP FOR GLASSES
## 
### 
From Berkeley comes the
plaintive plea of a Californian
(ostensibly) who wanted a Stan
ford rooter's hat, got it, lost his
glasses in the melee, and now
will trade hat for glasses. His
letter to the Daily follows:
The Editor, Sir:
Last Saturday after the
game I desired a Stanford
rooter's hat for a souvenir.
I got one all right, but in
the chase that followed I
lost a pair of glasses. Now
if any Stanfordite got them
I'd be glad to exchange the
hat for them. I wanted the
hat, but twenty dollars is
too much to pay for one.
Yours,
F. G. Bramble,
2542 Haste St.,
Berkeley.
