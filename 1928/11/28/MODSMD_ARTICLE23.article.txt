NEW YORK, Nov. 27 (A 3 ).—Harry
Wheeler, superintendent of the Lamport
and Holt Lines, operators of the Vestris,
testified today that if the Vestris put to
sea on her fatal voyage with no covers on
the hatches, she was unseaworthy.
Testifying in the Federal inquiry into
the disaster in which 110 lives were lost
November 12 off the Virginia Capes,
Wheeler agreed with Capt. Jessop, Amer
ican nautical expert, that with the seas
coming up it was "the first duty of a sea
going captain" to improvise hatch covers.
Reginald Dickson, sixth engineer on
the Vestris, testified at the Department of
Commerce hearing being held before
Dickerson N. Hoover, supervising in
spector-general of the Steamboat Inspec
tion Service, that when all hands were
needed most to keep the engines running,
the stoke-hold gang was on deck.
"For God's sake, boys," Dickson quoted
Captain Carey as saying to the stokers,
"go below and lend a hand."
The men started, Dickson said, but
once out of sight of the captain scurried
to other parts of the ship. As a result,
Deck officers needed to direct the aban
donment of the ship were obliged to
stoke the boilers.
