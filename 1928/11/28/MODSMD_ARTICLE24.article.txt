# MAN BRUISED IN CAMPUS CRASH; AUTOS WRECKED
## 
### 
Two automobiles were practically de
molished and one man suffered minor cuts
and bruises last night when cars driven
by N. A. Moore, 3230 Main street, May
field, and Rac Helmke, '29, collided at
the intersection of Arguello and Portola
streets on the campus shortly after sunset.
Helmke, driving a car owned by Wil
liam C. Putnam, '29, was headed north
on Arguello, while Moore was driving
toward Mayfield on Portola street. There
were no witnesses to the accident.
Because of the thick gravel recently
placed on the road, both cars had skidded
into the Toyon parking area by the force
of the impact, the coupe being overturned.
BROCKTON, Mass., Nov. 27. (/p)â€”A
young man entering business here
bought a second-hand desk. Finding
some old papers in a drawer, he dis
covered that his father had used the
desk before he, the son, was born.
