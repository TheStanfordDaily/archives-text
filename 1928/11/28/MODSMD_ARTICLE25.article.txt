# CARD-CADET TILT PROMISES TO BE YEAR'S FASTEST
## Cadets, Depending on Speed And Power, Not Deception, To Encounter All Three Middle of Warner Forward Wall Is Strong Enough to Check Soldiers' Line Plays 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Next Saturday's grid clash between the
West Point Cadets and the invading
Stanford Cardinals is likely to develop
into the season's fastest and most spec
tacular game.
The Cardinals will he meeting a team
whose style of play greatly resembles
that of Washington University this year.
Its system of offence play is conservative,
Chris Cagle's apparently extemporaneous
runs providing most of the thrills. "Biff"
Jones, Army coach and former Cadet
linesman, uses a few deceptive plays but
depends more on speed for rounding ends
and power for penetrating the line.
Card Wall Strong
The Soldier forward wall is weaker
than Stanford's except at the tackle po
sitions, held by Captain Bud Sprague and
Buster Perry. The middle of the War
ner line, with Heinccke, Robesky and
Post, appears strong enough to compel
the Army backs to avoid that section.
They will then have to resort to passes
and end runs for yard gains.
Cadets May Use Open Style
And if the Stanford-Washington and
Stanford-California games are any indi
cation, the Cadets will mrt be the only
ones employing the open style of game.
The Cards have used that style so suc
cessfully this season that they are likely
to almost entirely abandon the old War
ner style of power plays wherein smash
ing line plunges counted heavily.
Fast Backfield
The Pointers have what they term a
"well rounded backfield," however, that
does not mean that Cagle is not the man
to be stopped. Eastern sports writers re
port that he is one of the most elusive
gridiron eels that they have seen in some
time. The swift redhead has startled his
audiences on more than one occasion by
breaking away for fifty yard runs single
handed, solely by "shaking" his would-be
tacklers. Cagle is also the man who does
most of his team's punting and passing.
Do Not Use Huddle
Another factor which will speed up the
game is the Soldiers' system of calling
plays. They do not use the huddle, but
line up immediately after the ball is
stopped. Their offence formation is or
thodox. They use a balanced line. The
backfield lines up in a manner resembling
the Notre Dame formation, but with no
shift for the past two years.
Army Scouts Cards
Pop Warner is preparing his men for
the Army with chalk-talks aboard their
east-bound train. Naturally he has re
ceived scouts' reports on the Cadets' sys
tem, but at the same time the boys from
the Military Academy are studying War
ner's system. Army scouts have seen
Stanford play almost every game this
season. Tiny Hewitt, former Pittsburgh
ace under Warner and later Cadet back
field star, is the man whom the Academy
depends upon most. Hewitt has been fol
lowing the Cards for more than five
weeks, witnessing the Trojan, Husky,
and Bear contests.

than Stanford's except at the tackle po
sitions, held by Captain Bud Sprague and
Buster Perry. The middle of the War
ner line, with Heinccke, Robesky and
Post, appears strong enough to compel
the Army backs to avoid that section.
They will then have to resort to passes
and end runs for yard gains.
Cadets May Use Open Style
And if the Stanford-Washington and
Stanford-California games are any indi
cation, the Cadets will mrt be the only
ones employing the open style of game.
The Cards have used that style so suc
cessfully this season that they are likely
to almost entirely abandon the old War
ner style of power plays wherein smash
ing line plunges counted heavily.
Fast Backfield
The Pointers have what they term a
"well rounded backfield," however, that
does not mean that Cagle is not the man
to be stopped. Eastern sports writers re
port that he is one of the most elusive
gridiron eels that they have seen in some
time. The swift redhead has startled his
audiences on more than one occasion by
breaking away for fifty yard runs single
handed, solely by "shaking" his would-be
tacklers. Cagle is also the man who does
most of his team's punting and passing.
Do Not Use Huddle
Another factor which will speed up the
game is the Soldiers' system of calling
plays. They do not use the huddle, but
line up immediately after the ball is
stopped. Their offence formation is or
thodox. They use a balanced line. The
backfield lines up in a manner resembling
the Notre Dame formation, but with no
shift for the past two years.
Army Scouts Cards
Pop Warner is preparing his men for
the Army with chalk-talks aboard their
east-bound train. Naturally he has re
ceived scouts' reports on the Cadets' sys
tem, but at the same time the boys from
the Military Academy are studying War
ner's system. Army scouts have seen
Stanford play almost every game this
season. Tiny Hewitt, former Pittsburgh
ace under Warner and later Cadet back
field star, is the man whom the Academy
depends upon most. Hewitt has been fol
lowing the Cards for more than five
weeks, witnessing the Trojan, Husky,
and Bear contests.
Next Saturday's grid clash between the
West Point Cadets and the invading
Stanford Cardinals is likely to develop
into the season's fastest and most spec
tacular game.
The Cardinals will he meeting a team
whose style of play greatly resembles
that of Washington University this year.
Its system of offence play is conservative,
Chris Cagle's apparently extemporaneous
runs providing most of the thrills. "Biff"
Jones, Army coach and former Cadet
linesman, uses a few deceptive plays but
depends more on speed for rounding ends
and power for penetrating the line.
Card Wall Strong
The Soldier forward wall is weaker
than Stanford's except at the tackle po
sitions, held by Captain Bud Sprague and
Buster Perry. The middle of the War
ner line, with Heinccke, Robesky and
Post, appears strong enough to compel
the Army backs to avoid that section.
