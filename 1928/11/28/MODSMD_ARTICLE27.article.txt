# It All Started From a Wallet

### 
Sober reflection (and almost all of us ought to be capable of that by
now) will lead one to the conclusion that the Alen's Council was essentially
just in its disposition yesterday of the case of Lester McElwain, whose
misfortune it was to drop his wallet near the Big C on the night 011 which
it was painted red. McElwain was given three choices : (1) withdrawing
from the University for the remainder of this quarter; (2) completing
this quarter s work and staying out of the University during winter quar
ter; or (3) working 300 hours at the Convalescent Home before Registra
tion Day of spring quarter.
At first glance, it would appear that Mr. McElwain's wisest course
of action would be to absent himself winter quarter, but the Council had,
as a matter of fact, a definite punishment in mind when it offered the third
course of action. It has reason to believe that there are eleven other men
implicated in the prank along with McElwain. If these men share with
him the penalty of 300 hours, the punishment for each will amount to 25
hours. J hat penalty is not unreasonable, inasmuch as the men would have
two vacations and one full quarter to work it off. If the fellows who ac
companied McElwain are sporting, we think they will step up and share
with him the 300-hour assignment, if he wants them to.
The question may arise why the Men's Council gave so heavy a punish
ment. Ihe sole reason was that it wants to discourage invasion of the
California campus for such decorative purposes as painting the C. It does
iK) harm to paint the C—in fact that process helps it endure the weather—
but painting the C too often leads to painting Sather Gate and the Cam
panile, actions which no Stanford or California man or woman would
tolerate for an instant.
Paint and the Big C will not mix, if the Council has its way. The
Daily supposes that that is just as well. Its first attitude was that Mr.
McElwain should have been awarded a Block S for his work. Indeed, the
only complaint raised by representatives of the Daily Calif omian in regard
to the incident was that Stanford has not a Big S which might lend itself
to a blue and gold color scheme.
At all events the case has been "vigorously dealt with"—which is a
description that sounds well in print and that will quiet those few souls who
were not secretly glad to hear of the Big C's having been rouged.
