# Pledging To The Daily Staff
## 
### 
Part of the news appearing in the columns of the Daily during the
present quarter has been written by insignificant tryoutees, who have not
yet l>een dignified by being admitted to the masthead. This fall crop of
aspirants was a good one, though, and we have at lenth chosen eighteen to
join our happy group.
These are: Leonard Bartlett, Francis Binkley, Barbara Hoggs, Reid
Briggs, Stephen Dietrich, Jessie Fleming, Elizabeth Hawkins, Louise
Hewlett, John Knox, Max Krakauer, Elisabeth Larsh, Ruth Logie, George
Mittauer, Edward Peck, Robert Ricklefs, Virginia Tanzey, Mary Thayer,
and Edwin Williams.
The abundance of material made the problem of choice difficult, but
we feel we have a good "class," and we can say that we got every one
we bid.
Freshmen who failed to make the grade this time are urged to try out
again in the spring. The loss of two quarters of the freshman year brings
no handicap, if one may judge from the fact that the previous editor did
not try out until spring of his freshman year and the present editor, having
been eliminated in the fall tryouts, waited until winter, when it was easy
to sneak into the masthead.
The Daily also announces with pleasure the appointment of Anson
Reeder and Kenneth Mansfield to the position of copy editor. Reeder has
made a phenomenal advance on the staff, having commenced work in
campus journalism only last summer. Mansfield was a tryoutee only last
spring quarter.
