# Put Out Fires With Gasoline!
## 
### 
Campus residents apparently little realize the extreme advantage that
they enjoy in the matter of insurance rates and local taxes. No other com
munity on the Peninsula has such low policy rates, and no other community
of this size escai>es the burden of city taxes.
This saving is due largely to the fact that the University established
the Stanford University Fire Department, the greatest part of the upkeep
of which is paid by the profits from the campus gas station, the remainder
l>eing furnished by the University. Thus, the residents are receiving first
class fire protection without paying for it, except as they buy gasoline here.
So simple a way of benefiting the community in which one lives ought
not to be disregarded. Gasoline, if one owns a car, must be bought some
where; and since the price is uniform the country over, how simple it
would be to increase the efficiency of the Stanford fire protection at the
same time one fills one's tank! The better the department, the lower will
be insurance rates here.
It seems unnecessary to urge Stanford people to take advantage of this
mutually beneficial patronage. But the majority of them arc unaware of
the way the thing works. Ix:t each gallon of gas represent a step toward
more and better fire equipment!
