The Editor, Sir:
1 should like to add a comment on
the Honor System to the many I have
seen in your column.
I am a transfer student and entered
Stanford this fall. 1 came here with
the impression that I was entering a
school where the students were thor
oughly impressed with the idea of
holding up the honor of the school by
not cheating or allowing anyone else
to cheat. I came here feeling that
there was a high code of ethics set
that I was expected to live up to. A
feeling of duty to my school rested
on my shoulders and I am sure that
ihe freshmen and other transfers that
were as green or greener than 1 had
the same feeling.
Before long my golden ideal began
to get a little tarnished, and it is so
corroded now that I have a suspicion
that I was goldbricked, or in the Stan
ford vernacular, very sadly "rooked."
The first time I saw a person cheat I
waited breathlessly for a rattle of
pens and group of stern visages
turned on the offender. I then ex
pected him to tear up his paper never
to return again. Nothing of the kind;
he seemed to be quite complacent.
His neighbors seemed to think it
quite the thing. This pulled out the
props from under the Stanford code
of ethics for me. I didn't expect the
offender to break down and weep or
his fellow students to tell him to take
the next train, but I didn't expect
quite the barefaced cheating that I
did see.
The thing that capped the climax
for me was in an ex I took awhile
back. It was a fill-in type of examina
tion, and the teamwork I saw there
would have done any football squad
credit. It appears that each person
took a certain section of the work
and learned it perfectly so that it

SCOTCH A CHEATER
might be transferred to the group
during the ex. They didn't seem to
lu:ow anything about the Honor Sys
tem but they sure had the "huddle
system" perfected. If they didn't do
that, they "forward-passed" the an
swer from one end of the line to the
other. This griped my soul exceed
ingly, as I had studied for that
damned ex for two days and had sat
up ,until 1 o'clock the morning previ
ous to be sure I knew all dates,
places, and so forth.
You will say then, "Why didn't you
tap your pencil or say that someone
was cheating in the room?" I would
if I thought that school spirit was
with me, but I don't think it is.
In all the time I would be here I
could never live down the stigma of
being honest. I would crucify my
chances of ever getting anything out
of tne social side of life. Others might
agree with me but they would be
afraid to say so lest they be tainted
with the mark of honesty. In short I
would rather let those persons' who
cheat cut my throat seholastically
than have all my chances of making
friends lost.
Perhaps I am wrong; it is very un
likely I saw a particularly aggravat
ing case. I do not know but I must
say that my opinion of the Honor
System as practiced at Stanford has
fallen low.
I think Mr. Cavalero's plan a very
good one if the seniors would all
practice it, but it doesn't appear that
they do.
My idea would be to place the three
classes under the proctor system and
then start With a clean slate with the
freshmen. In this way they would not
have any upperclassmen to disillusion
their ideals.
Yours for better days for the Honor
System. —A Bewildered Transfer.

could never live down the stigma of
being honest. I would crucify my
chances of ever getting anything out

would rather let those persons' who
cheat cut my throat seholastically

friends lost.
Perhaps I am wrong; it is very un
likely I saw a particularly aggravat

say that my opinion of the Honor
System as practiced at Stanford has
fallen low.
I think Mr. Cavalero's plan a very
good one if the seniors would all
practice it, but it doesn't appear that
they do.
My idea would be to place the three
classes under the proctor system and
then start With a clean slate with the
freshmen. In this way they would not
have any upperclassmen to disillusion
their ideals.

The Editor, Sir:
1 should like to add a comment on
the Honor System to the many I have
seen in your column.
I am a transfer student and entered
Stanford this fall. 1 came here with
the impression that I was entering a
school where the students were thor
oughly impressed with the idea of
holding up the honor of the school by
not cheating or allowing anyone else
to cheat. I came here feeling that
there was a high code of ethics set
that I was expected to live up to. A
feeling of duty to my school rested
on my shoulders and I am sure that
ihe freshmen and other transfers that
were as green or greener than 1 had
the same feeling.
Before long my golden ideal began
to get a little tarnished, and it is so
corroded now that I have a suspicion
that I was goldbricked, or in the Stan
ford vernacular, very sadly "rooked."
The first time I saw a person cheat I
waited breathlessly for a rattle of
pens and group of stern visages
turned on the offender. I then ex
pected him to tear up his paper never
to return again. Nothing of the kind;
he seemed to be quite complacent.
His neighbors seemed to think it
quite the thing. This pulled out the
props from under the Stanford code
of ethics for me. I didn't expect the
offender to break down and weep or
his fellow students to tell him to take
the next train, but I didn't expect
quite the barefaced cheating that I
did see.
The thing that capped the climax
for me was in an ex I took awhile
back. It was a fill-in type of examina
tion, and the teamwork I saw there
would have done any football squad
credit. It appears that each person
took a certain section of the work
and learned it perfectly so that it

SCOTCH A CHEATER
might be transferred to the group
during the ex. They didn't seem to
lu:ow anything about the Honor Sys
tem but they sure had the "huddle
system" perfected. If they didn't do
that, they "forward-passed" the an
swer from one end of the line to the
other. This griped my soul exceed
