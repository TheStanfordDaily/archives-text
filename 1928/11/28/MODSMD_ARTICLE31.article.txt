# WANTS THE STUDENT BODY TO BUILD THE FIRE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Our bonfire needs consideration. Its
function, I take, it, is to put the Stu
dent Body in a unified spirit of enthu
siasm, and to demonstrate this enthu
siasm. Our last fire did this admirably,
but at an unduly heavy expenditure
of time and labor.
I suggest for the future:
1. That the bonfire be built under
the> supervision 01 a committee which
shall be organized about a month be
fore the rally, and shall immediately
proceed to locate material and ar
range transportation facilities; but
2. That actual work on the pyre
shall not be begun till four days be
fore the rally, and further,

3. That the entire Student Body
shall be called upon to do the work of
construction.
In support of these proposals, I of
fer the following points:
1. Student Body spirit is not greatly
stirred when the frosh do all the
work. The rallies of '25 and '28 were,
I think, much greater exhibitions
than those of '26 and '27.
2. The limitation of the Lower Divi
sion puts the burden of construction
on a smaller and smaller body of men.
3. A strong guard—or a group of
workers —could be maintained for a
few nights, rather than a weak guard
for many. This would greatly de
crease danger of premature ignition.
