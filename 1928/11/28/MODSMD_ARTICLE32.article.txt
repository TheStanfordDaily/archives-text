# "FAIR PLAY" OBJECTS TO PROVINCIALISM

### 
The Editor, Sir:
The exhilarating effect of the Big
Game had not yet left our Mr. Nor
man when he wrote his article, "The
Good Genii." I am referring especially
to his word picture of the average
New Yorker. Seemingly Mr. Norman
knows as little about the East as his
"average" New Yorker knows of the
West. But we will have to admit that
the East has advanced to the extent

t that it has a few newspapers which
keep the people in touch with the
outside world, even with the sophis
ticated West; yes, even with Los An
| geles. One really should not be quite
so harsh with the poor New Yorkers,
for with time they may become edu
cated enough to know that Indians
do not fight on the streets of Los An
l geles. That privilege is reserved for
! white folks. I am not a citizen of New
York. â€”Fair Play.
