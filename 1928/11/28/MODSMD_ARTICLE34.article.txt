has been touched by pathos of the

mother. "Isn't The Bonfire Beau

Mary and her mother live in a little
house at the edge of town. There are
only two rooms. The fence is a little
tumbled down, perhaps, but Mary's
mother has planted a few flowers
near the gate. They try bravely to
hide the fact that the little house
needs a coat of paint. One window is
broken. Not much chill gets in,
though, because there is a board
nailed across.
It is sometimes cold during the win
ter months. Mary and her mother
have a tiny stove. It doesn't make
much heat but it is enough—when
there is fuel. Mary sometimes goes
around the neighborhood and finds lit
tle sticks for the fire. But Mary and
her mother are proud and sometimes
the little stove isn't very warm. Mary
goes to school every day. She likes
school, but it is hard to study at home
when it's cold.
Mary's mother works in the town,
She does sewing and takes care of
children. It is often warmer in other
people's homes. Mary and her mother
are happy —especially in the summer.
They go out of town into the fields
and pretend they are far away on a
vacation.
The other night Mary and her
mother sat around the little stove.
There wasn't much fuel. Mary was
telling her mother how the boys out
at the University had spent two weeks
building a big bonfire. Someone had
burned it the morning before.
Mary had watched the wagons go
by loaded with wood. They were re
building the bonfire. It was very ex
citing. That night the second bonfire
was going to be burned.
Mary looked out of the window. The
s:ky was lighted with flame.
Mary's mother didn't notice. "It is
cold," she murmured —low, so that
Mary could not hear.
But all that Mary said was, "Isn't
the bonfire beautiful?"

hide the fact that the little house
needs a coat of paint. One window is
broken. Not much chill gets in,
though, because there is a board

It is sometimes cold during the win
ter months. Mary and her mother
have a tiny stove. It doesn't make
much heat but it is enough—when
there is fuel. Mary sometimes goes
around the neighborhood and finds lit
tle sticks for the fire. But Mary and
her mother are proud and sometimes
the little stove isn't very warm. Mary
goes to school every day. She likes
school, but it is hard to study at home
when it's cold.
Mary's mother works in the town,
She does sewing and takes care of
children. It is often warmer in other
people's homes. Mary and her mother
are happy —especially in the summer.
They go out of town into the fields
and pretend they are far away on a
vacation.
The other night Mary and her
mother sat around the little stove.
There wasn't much fuel. Mary was
telling her mother how the boys out
at the University had spent two weeks
building a big bonfire. Someone had
burned it the morning before.
Mary had watched the wagons go
by loaded with wood. They were re
building the bonfire. It was very ex
citing. That night the second bonfire
was going to be burned.
Mary looked out of the window. The
s:ky was lighted with flame.
Mary's mother didn't notice. "It is
cold," she murmured —low, so that
Mary could not hear.
But all that Mary said was, "Isn't
the bonfire beautiful?"

Mary and her mother live in a little
house at the edge of town. There are
only two rooms. The fence is a little
tumbled down, perhaps, but Mary's
mother has planted a few flowers
near the gate. They try bravely to
hide the fact that the little house
needs a coat of paint. One window is
broken. Not much chill gets in,
though, because there is a board
