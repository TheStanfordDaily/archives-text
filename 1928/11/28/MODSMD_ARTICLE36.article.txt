LOS ANGELES, Nov. 27 (£>).—The
cret of Trojan hopes for a grid victory
•turday against the Irish from Notre
mie today seemed to be locked in Coach
oavvard Jones' plans for Russ Saun
rs, racehorse fullback.
Russ Saunders is an old hand in the
•uthern California backfield, and pres
t indications are that he is being dis
ised as a quarterback. "Dynamic" Don
illiams, de luxe member of the Trojan
ckfield quartet, had not weakened, but
; understudy, the 18-year-old sensation,
arshall Duffield, plunged just once too
ten into the sturdy Idaho line last Sat-
Jay and may not be in uniform again
s season. He chipped a shoulder bone.
The plunging methods Saunders uses in
. offensive work, and his dependability
the tight places single him out as the
>t bet for a Southern California hero,
d Jones, evidently, is planning to have
nember of his team receive the laurel
eath this year.
But while the Trojan warhorse went
ough its paces behind locked gates last
;lit, Knute Rockne was planning for a
le set-to with the Arizona Wildcats
Tucson tomorrow night. The wily
ich from Notre Dame schedules a two
{ stayover at the home of the Arizona
iiversity on his invasions of the Pacific
ast and gives the players a warm-up
the Wildcat lair.
The Trojan team was whole again last
ht when Charley Boren, running
ird, appeared in uniform for the first
ie in a week. Marshall Duffield was
there, but there seemed to be a di
ion of opinion on how long he would
lain away from the practice field.
inme said that Duffield would not be
k this season, while others were cou
nt that he would appear on the turf
ight with a special shoulder pad, and
lid be ready to go in should Williams
ie out in the Notre Dame clash.
