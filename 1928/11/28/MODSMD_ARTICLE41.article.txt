I With the Big Game or I C J2B a matter
iof history, vociferous arguments are aris
ing at Berkeley regarding the contest and
California's inability to maintain its thir
teen-point lead of the first half. The
referee is blamed for the tie score, being
charged with failure to penalize Stanford
for asserted illegal play in the second
half, once when Frentrup received Sim
kins' pass and tied the score, and on nu
merous other occasions when Simkins
passed to Lewis. The Berkeley post pior
tem has delivered the verdict that these
plays were illegal and, as a result, vic
tory belongs to California.
A sports writer of The Daily Cali
fornian says of the passes:
"Do not biame Speed Newman
for failing to knock down that
touchdown pass." According to
Newman (goat in the case),
"Frentrup shoved me as he ran
past into the end zone. I was un
able to get my balance in time to
get back to the ball and try to
knock it down."
The same authority publishes the fol
lowing opinion concerning the passes to
Lewis :
"If Pop Warner wishes to use
his pet screened pass he should be j
the rules committee of the game.
Nibs Price, chief coach, is the au
thority for that statement, and is
supported by many other experts,
that those passes to Lewis were il
legal."
In both cases the writer refers to vio
lations of Rule XVI, section three, which
provides that no player of the side mak
ing a pass "shall, either before or after
the pass has been made, in any manner
interfere with an opponent until the ball
has been touched, except in an actual at
tempt to catch or bat the ball himself."
If Frentrup did purposely knock New
man off his feet, and if the Stanford
players did protect the passes to Lewis
by eliminating the Bears' pass defence,
then Stanford did violate the rules and
was therefore subject to penalties. How
ever, with such capable officials present
as George Varnell, member of the Rules
Committee, Sam Dolan, Tommy Fitz
patrick and Ralph McCord, it seems un
likely that such asserted violations could
be overlooked. Varnell, the referee, used
to have more admirers across the Bay
than on the Farm. He was California's
choice for the job. The Friday issue of
The Daily Californian regarded him as
"one of the most competent officials in
the country."

The eternal triangle of football
will exist next Saturday with Stan
ford, Notre Dame and Southern

California each occupying one of
the angles. The Trojans, conquer
ors of the Cards (10-0) will be
playing Notre Dame, victor of
Army (12-6). Before this game
starts, Stanford and Army will
have battled it out in New York.
Comparative scores may be en
lightening as to just how big a
part Lady Luck played in U.S.C.'s
victory over the Cardinals a month
ago.

The score of the West Point game will
also give some idea of Stanford's strength
with other national gridiron leaders, for
the Cadets have defeated Yale, Harvard,
Southern Methodist and Nebraska, all
leaders in their respective territories.

Another angle of intersectional ratings
may be gained from the Thanksgiving
headliner, Oregon State vs. New York
University. The N.Y.U. Violets defeat
ed Carnegie, bust lost to Georgetown.

I(t looks like the national fooltball
championship will be decided this year
by intercollegiate debates starting next
Monday and lasting until after the New
Year's game in Pasadena.
