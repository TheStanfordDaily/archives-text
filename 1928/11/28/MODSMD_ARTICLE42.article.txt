# ATHLETIC CONTESTS ARE PROVING USEFUL IN TREATING MENTALLY ILL
## 
### 
PERRY POINT, Md., Nov. 27
Athletic contests, such as baseball, volley
ball, tennis and swimming, are being
shown to have a distinct scientific value
in the treatment of certain neurotic and
psychologic conditions at the United
States Veterans' Hospital here.
Appealing to the primal racial instinct
to play, John Eisle Davis, the senior
physical director, explains, the principle
objective of the hospital's physical pro
gram is the development, through infor
mal group games, of the mental attitudes
which attend and grow out of them so
that social adjustments will result.
It is believed, he says, "that the utili
zation of the basic instinct, play, as a
starting point in this intricate process of
resocialization, is particularly effective in
awakening valuable interests and creating
an outlook upon life which will tend to
ward the ultimate improvement and hap
piness of the mentally ill."
This form of treatment, he has found,
is particularly valuable in combatting nu

merous cases which he calls the "William
Smith type."
"William Smith," he relates, "has lost
his grip, the will to survive, to enter
into the closely competitive relationships
of life. But he has not lost entirely the
desire for happiness which is so closely
allied to an active social experience, and
so, unable for the time to become the
real actor on the stage, he finds pleasure
in reproducing life's battles in an at
mosphere of his own making, the base
ball diamond or volley ball court.
"In addition to the pleasures derived
from this joyous exercise, William Smith
may also feel the urge to do the real
thing and enter into the greater issues
of normal life."
The form of competitive exercise se
lected for a patient, he says, must con
tain powerful elements of interest so as
to control his mental state and overcome
distracting and disintegrating ideas, lead
ing him toward a concentration rather
than a diffusion of both mental and physi
cal activity.
