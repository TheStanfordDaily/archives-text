## "Pointer" Sports Editor Says Eastern Team Has No Over-Confidence

Special lo The Stanford Daily
On the banks of the Hudson the G>rps
is waiting—waiting for the attack of the
red-aad-white jerseyed invaders speeding
eastward.
The Soldiers arc ready for the Cardi
nal foe, as soldiers should be. They are
awaiting an enemy whose strength is not
actually known in the East, but is ex
pected to be great, judging from "intel
ligence department" reports.
West Point anticipates a battle that it
will long remember. The Corps and the
team entertain no over-confiidcnce for the
grid clash Saturday. They realize that
anything may happen in the Yankee Sta
dium- as if the Notre Dame game was
the only reminder. They arc confident
of making a fight and, winning or losing,
struggling to the last whistle to down
the Western invaders.
Successful Season
Regardless of the final score, the game
will climax a most successful football
season for the Pointers. Army is one
of the very few eastern grid teams to go
through the entire season without a de
feat from another eastern teaxi. As a
representative of the Atlantic seaboard
it leads Carnegie, New York University
and Georgetown, for its only defeat (by
a 12-6 score) has been received at the
hands of the Fighting Irish of South
Bend.
West Point has defeated the powerful
outfits from Yale, Harvard. Southern
Methodist, and Nebraska. It has sur
vived a tough season with but one scar.
The Cadets look forward to the Stan
ford power plays. They are anxious to
witness the speed reverses, the passes,
and the punts of which they have heard
so much this season. They look forward
to seeing Heinceke, Fientrup, Simkins,
and Captain 'Hofftpan in action. They
expcct to see a great line playing a great
game.
Though the Black - Gray - and - Gold
squad has no fullback to match with the
redoubtable Biff Hoffman, it has a half
back in Chris Cagle who will keep the
defence busy. Whatever may happen to
the Army attack, Cagle is still Cagle, and
in that sensational redhead lies an ever
dangerous threat. Passing, running,
lacking, blocking—he is a man to be fear
ed by the opposition and admired by the
Cadets.
Cagle is Star
Army's hackfield is a well rounded one,
however, and though Cagle is its star,
there are others of no mean ability. They
have in Hertz Murrel a fullback who will
worry the Stanford line, in Charles Allen
and Richie O'Keefe, they have two in
terfering backs of proven ability, and in
Spike Nave a first-class quarterback.
Hutchinson, Piper, Bowman, Carlson,
Gibner and Timberlake are second-string
backs who have seen action in nearly
every game.
In the line, Army's only big men are
Buster Perry and Bud Sprague, tackles.
Spragne is captain of the Cadet eleven
and is playing his last year for West
PoinL The guard positions are rcgularl}
filled by Hammack and Ilumber, though j
Dibb has also played considerably. Bill i
Hall fills the pivot, and Messinger and j
liai Imark, both yearlings (sophomores in j
the civilian college} are the guardians of i
the wings. Both have improved remark- j
ably this season, handicapped as they
were with the problem of filling tlve shoes
of Born and Harboid, regulars who grad
uated last year. Major Sasse, noted in
the East as an "end builder," faced a

great problem in producing ends for this
year, but his products have been giving
a good account of themselves and should
continue to do so.
It should be a great game and West
Point is laboring under no illusions as
to its certainty of success against its
western foe.

vived a tough season with but one scar.
The Cadets look forward to the Stan
ford power plays. They are anxious to
witness the speed reverses, the passes,
and the punts of which they have heard
so much this season. They look forward
to seeing Heinceke, Fientrup, Simkins,
and Captain 'Hofftpan in action. They
expcct to see a great line playing a great
game.
Though the Black - Gray - and - Gold
squad has no fullback to match with the
redoubtable Biff Hoffman, it has a half
back in Chris Cagle who will keep the
defence busy. Whatever may happen to
the Army attack, Cagle is still Cagle, and
in that sensational redhead lies an ever
dangerous threat. Passing, running,
lacking, blocking—he is a man to be fear
ed by the opposition and admired by the
Cadets.
Cagle is Star
Army's hackfield is a well rounded one,
however, and though Cagle is its star,
there are others of no mean ability. They
have in Hertz Murrel a fullback who will
worry the Stanford line, in Charles Allen
and Richie O'Keefe, they have two in
terfering backs of proven ability, and in
Spike Nave a first-class quarterback.
Hutchinson, Piper, Bowman, Carlson,
Gibner and Timberlake are second-string
backs who have seen action in nearly
every game.
In the line, Army's only big men are
Buster Perry and Bud Sprague, tackles.
Spragne is captain of the Cadet eleven
and is playing his last year for West
PoinL The guard positions are rcgularl}
filled by Hammack and Ilumber, though j
Dibb has also played considerably. Bill i
Hall fills the pivot, and Messinger and j
liai Imark, both yearlings (sophomores in j
the civilian college} are the guardians of i
the wings. Both have improved remark- j
ably this season, handicapped as they
were with the problem of filling tlve shoes
of Born and Harboid, regulars who grad
uated last year. Major Sasse, noted in
the East as an "end builder," faced a

great problem in producing ends for this
year, but his products have been giving
a good account of themselves and should
continue to do so.
It should be a great game and West
Point is laboring under no illusions as
to its certainty of success against its
western foe.

On the banks of the Hudson the G>rps
is waiting—waiting for the attack of the
red-aad-white jerseyed invaders speeding
eastward.
The Soldiers arc ready for the Cardi
nal foe, as soldiers should be. They are
awaiting an enemy whose strength is not
actually known in the East, but is ex
pected to be great, judging from "intel
ligence department" reports.
West Point anticipates a battle that it
will long remember. The Corps and the
team entertain no over-confiidcnce for the
grid clash Saturday. They realize that
anything may happen in the Yankee Sta
dium- as if the Notre Dame game was
the only reminder. They arc confident
of making a fight and, winning or losing,
struggling to the last whistle to down
the Western invaders.
Successful Season
Regardless of the final score, the game
will climax a most successful football
season for the Pointers. Army is one
of the very few eastern grid teams to go
through the entire season without a de
feat from another eastern teaxi. As a
representative of the Atlantic seaboard
it leads Carnegie, New York University
and Georgetown, for its only defeat (by
a 12-6 score) has been received at the
hands of the Fighting Irish of South
Bend.
West Point has defeated the powerful
outfits from Yale, Harvard. Southern
Methodist, and Nebraska. It has sur
