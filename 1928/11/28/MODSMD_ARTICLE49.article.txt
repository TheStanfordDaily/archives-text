Saturday, December 8, has been an
nounced as the date for the International
Student Service bridge tea which will be
given under the auspices of the Y.W.C.A.

The International Student Service is
an organization of students throughout
the world. The money which is being
raised in America this year will be used
to continue the operation of such agencies
as rest homes, employment bureaus, sani
tariums, and other enterprises to aid
students. Stanford through a Y.W.C.A.
bridge tea last year contributed $150 to
the American fund which was $12,000.
Following the war, conditions of stu
dents in European countries were very
bad, and many students, especially in
France, Austria, and Germany, lived be
low the poverty line which was $36 per
month in Paris. I.S.S. attacked this prob
lem by reducing the cost of living to al
most nothing. In order to do this, it ran
restaurants, on a losing basis, aided the
students in getting employment, and in
countless other ways.
