### 
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Nov. 27 (JP). â€”
The Yankee Doodle, famous record flight
plane which carried Harry Tucker and
Captain C. B. D. Collyer to their deaths
in the mountains near here recently,
soared lialf a mile with half a wing
missing.
R O. Pecht, Los Angeles aviator and
friend of the men who met death in the
ill-fated plane, disclosed tonight that he
had found a six-foot section of the Yan
kee Doodle wing near a tree on a ridge
half a mile from the scene of the actual
crash. High up on the tree a great scar
with traces of enamel similar to that on
the wings of the plane was found.
Pecht says that Captain Collyer evi
dently struck the tree, crippled the plane,
and then managed to maneuver to a much
lower altitude before dropping the plane
to the canyon wall where it was found,
a crumpled mass.
