## 
### 
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Nov. 27. (&)â€”
Permit or no, the West Allis Presby
terian Church plans to hold boxing
classes with Myron "Pinky" Mitchell,
former junior welterweight cham
pion, as the tutor.
When the church applied for a per
mit, the request was held up because
one member declared it could not be
iesued to the church which, he said,
was not incorporated for the specific
purpose of teaching boxing as required
by law.
Today Rev. W. S. Critchley, pastor,
said that if the commission refused
to issue a permit, members of the
church would hold classes without
one.
