# CARDS TO OPPOSE SAN JOSE CAGERS IN FIRST CONTEST
## 
### 
Stanford's 1928 varsity basketball sea- j
son will officially get under way next
Tuesday evening in the Cardinal pavilion ;
when Coach Husky Hunt's charges take
on the San Jose State Teachers College '
Spartans in their first game of the year, j
The contest will start at 7 :30 o'clock.
The game has been scheduled, accord
ing to Hunt, for the purpose of bringing
out the results of the early practice ses
sions and to give the players a taste of
actual competition before the season Ix*-
gins in earnest.
The Stanford coach is still undecided
as to who will be on the floor at the
opening whistle, but, because of the fact
that several of the most promising candi
dates for this year's team, including Cap
tain Harlow Rothert, are traveling in the
East with the football squad, choice is
limited to a scant few.
Tampcke and Reynolds, first string
guards on the 1927 freshman team, will
probably fill the defense berths in the
absence of Rothert and Thompson, mem
bers of last year's varsity.
The center position will be occupied by
John McCandless or William Okker, with
Chuck Stnalling, first string center 011 the
1927 varsity in the Hast and James
Mears, promising sophomore candidate,
ill with the "flu."
Choice of forwards lies between Berg,
Clark, and Richards, members of last
year's varsity, and Hawkins and Hepp,
sophomores.
