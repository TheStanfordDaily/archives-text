# STOREY BELIEVES PEAK OF RECENT EPIDEMIC IS PAST
## 
### 
In a statement last night, Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, University Health
Officer, said that the peak of the re
cent "flu" epidemic seems to have
passed and that the number of cases
on the campus are rapidly declining.
"The situation is encouraging but
there is still necessity for the exer
cise of extreme care on the part of
students," Dr. Storey said. "Students
are urged to take care of common
colds or any other illnesses, either
it porting to the offices of the Medical
Advisers for advice, or else consult
ing their private physicians.
"There is an adequate number of
hospital beds available for both men
and women students, and the hospital
is the wisest place for students ill
enough to be in bed."
At present, the Isolation Hospital
has 9 men patients with 12 beds avail
able. Fourteen men and 5 women pa
tients are in the Palo Alto Hospital,
and although there is only one extra
bed available at present, there is
room for IS women at the Student
Hospital Annex.
