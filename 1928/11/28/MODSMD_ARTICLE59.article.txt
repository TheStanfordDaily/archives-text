# FERRY BOATS COLLIDE IN DENSE FOG ON BAY
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 27. (ff)—
Bay commuters had a shock today
when two ferry boats, one of them
loaded with passengers, grazed each
ether in a dense fog on San Francisco
Bay. The Southern Pacific ferry Santa
Clara was about to enter its slip on
the San Francisco side of the bay
when the Northwestern Pacific auto
ferry pulled out of its pier on a run
to Sausalito.
As the boats came together the
auto boat knocked out a portion of
the Santa Clara's bulwark. Both ves
sels were proceeding slowly and there
was little disorder although there was
a report some of the passengers tried
to launch a lifeboat.
Both ferries proceeded on their
scheduled trips.
