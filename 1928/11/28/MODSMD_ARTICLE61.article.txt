# SAN MATEO WINS OVER CARD BABES IN SOCCER GAME
## 
### 
In the second meeting of the two teams
this season, the San Mateo Junior Col
lege soccer outfit again defeated the Card
frosh. The yearlings showed a decided
improvement since their last contest and
succeeded in holding their experienced
rivals to a score of 3 to 1.
The Redshirt offense did not begin to
function until the closing moments of
the game, when they worked the ball up
the turf by a series of long kicks, and
then shot it by the goalie. The defensive
backs were continually 011 the run trying
to cover the elusive San Mateo forwards,
and did a pretty fair job of it when the
strong offense of their opponents is con
sidered. Day, Stanford forward center,
played a nice game, and was the main
stay of the frosh defense.
Yesterday's contest was the final game
of the season, but the frosh are expected
to continue practice until final week. The
lone victory of the freshmen was chalked
up against the U.C. frosh last week, the
contest ending 3 to 0 in Stanford's favor.
