# SPORTS OF 1928
## Stanford's Brains 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The "Sly Old Fox" of football,
Glenn Scobey Warner, will strut his
stuff in New York for the first time
in many years when his Stanford
boys play the Army on December
first. The Redshirts are a big, strong,
fast outfit, with an abundance of
"Pop" Warner's trick plays—some
said they had too many of them in
the game with Southern California,
which they lost by fumbling away
three or four fine scoring chances —
and will put on a great show if given
any kind of decent weather.
"Pop" had the whole West Coast
talking about "Formation B" this fall,
but, after Southern California showed
that they could call it "Formation B
damned" and get away with it, "Pop"
took to using "Formation A" about
half the time. The boys line up an
offensive as in the diagrams, with the
line unbalanced, the strong side al
ways to the right. The fullback, either
Hoffman or Simkins, and the quarter
back, either Fleishhacker or Smalling
(who are really another pair of full
backs), are both in a position to
handle the ball, with the quarterback
doing most of the faking. Wilton and
Frentrup play left half about fifty
fifty, while Sims and Lewis divide the
other halfback's job. Then there is
Harlow Rothert, Olympic shot-putter,
to fill in at fullback, if needed^
"Heinie" .Heinecke, the center,
though only 5 feet 7 inches tall and
weighing 175 pounds, is a player with
real football sense, and will bear
watching against the Cadets. He calls
signals part of the time, quite an un

, usual job for a snapper-back. "Pop"
has other fine players in the line,
especially Post and Robesky, the
; guards, who often are given a ball
i carrying assignment.
