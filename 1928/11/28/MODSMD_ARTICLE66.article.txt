# Mount Etna Is Benefit To Sicily Even Though It Causes Destruction
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 27. (#>) â€” j
Mount Etna is a benefactor as well as ,
a destroyer.
The great volcano which has been !
pouring death and destruction over j
the surrounding countryside does
good as it works evil, the National
Geographic Society says.
By eruptions, Etna fertilizes the
fitlds. If there were no Etna, there j
probably would be no Sicily. If there
were not lava Hows, the slopes of i
Europe's greatest volcano would be- j
come an abandoned desert.
Farmers on Etna's slopes now blast |
holes in old lava beds and in the j
pits plant almond, chestnut, lemon, |
and olive trees which thrive vigor
ously on the disintegrating volcanic i
rock. The best wine of Sicily, it is
said, comes from vineyards on the j
thinks of. Etna.
