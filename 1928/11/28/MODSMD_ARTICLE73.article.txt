### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 27. (/P)-
Will Rogers and the San Francisco
Bohemian Club, figuratively speaking,
have kissed and made up.
Rumors were current recently that
because Will talked too long at a
Bohemian Grove entertainment his
application for membership had been
unfavorably acted upon.
Today Herbert A. Schmidt, presi
dent of the club, telegraphed Rogers
denying the rumors and asserting he
would be welcomed as a member any
time the comedian cared to enter the j
organization.
