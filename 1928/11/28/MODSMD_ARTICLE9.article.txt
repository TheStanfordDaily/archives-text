# COMMONERS GIVEN FAITH BY FRANKLIN
## Fay Describes 'Poor Richard' As Being Greater Than Contemporaries 
### 
"Benjamin Franklin, through the
medium of his 'Poor Richard's Al
manacs,' furnished the common peo
ple of Europe and America a cate
chism which amounted to a regular
religion," said Professor Bernard Fay
in a well-received talk in the Little
Theatre last night.
"Franklin was the greatest man of
his time, although a contemporary of
Voltaire and Rousseau. His popularity
lay in the sympathy which he always
held for the bourgeoisie.
Son of Chandler
Born the son of a chandler, Frank
lin was raised among the poor class,
made his fortune by selling almanacs
which were written to be read by
them, and all through life kept in
touch with the middle class of people.
"In science, as in religion, Franklin
was a bourgeois, making his ideas a
practical and material thing. His
scientific work did more than any
thing else to make his name known.
Franklin was the first to establish
the fact that thunderstorms are na
tural phenomena, and not evidences
of the wrath of God. However, be
cause of these proofs, for ten years
he brought the 'wrath of God on his
own head' from the clergy, who con
demned him as irreligious.
Not a Political Leader
"As a political leader, Franklin was
not a success either in Pennsylvania,
the American Congress, or England.
His shrewd scheme of federating the
Colonies under English rule was hated
by the more radical, rebellious ele
ment. At different times he was the
most detested man in America and
France. Franklin was too clever. His
superior shrewdness made him feared
and disliked by rival statesmen.
"Franklin's plain tastes and straight
forward ideas were shown when he
appeared before the French queen for
the first time, plainly dressed with
out ribbons or wig, which was a most
unheard-of thing," he concluded.
