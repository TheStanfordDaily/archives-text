AT ANY COTILLION
A Phelps-Terkel Tuxedo will make you feel like
the "best-dressed man" at the Cotillion. They are
correctly fashioned for University men—correct
in style, material, and pattern —a tuxedo that will
give you the poise and self-assurance which come
only of the knowledge that you are properly at
tired for the occasion.
We have every accessory for evening wear —all
as fashionably correct as the tuxedo itself.
$45 and up
Just received! A selection of the newest
calfskin evening shoes to go with your Tux.
They combine the necessary qualities of danc
ing comfort and immaculate appearance to
the highest degree.
Cost but ten dollars
