### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2. (#>)â€”
Fifteen minutes of rioting ended a
soccer football game here today be
tween Union Sportiva Italiana and
Unione Espanolo, respectively Italian
and Spanish athletic clubs.
The trouble started over a disputed
goal which the referee allowed the
Italians, making the score 4 to 2 in
their favor. Onlookers said two Span
ish rooters struck George Hynd, the
referee, who retorted in kind. Nearly
100 excited spectators rushed into the
fight, which lasted for about 15 min
utes. Umbrellas and fists were the
weapons. The fight was staged in a
downpour of rain.
After order had been restored with
out police interference, Unione Es
panolo refused to continue tne game.
Both team and rooters left the field.
