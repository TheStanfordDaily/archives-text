# Gerckins' Syncopaters To Play at Sophomore Cotillion December 7
## 
### 
Leo Gerckins and his orchestra are
| slated as the chief attractions at the
\ Sophomore Cotillion December 7.
The Gerckins syncopators have a
coast-wide reputation and are much
in demand both in San Francisco and
Southern California cities.
Selection of an Egyptian motif has
given the decorations committee op
portunity to produce something new
in dance motifs. This will be the
first time that the hall has been made
to reflect the mode of the ancient
Valley Nile.
A number of bids for the Cotillion
I are still available at the office of the
Old Union, but as the demand for
them is increasing daily, those who
wish to take advantage of the sale
should do so immediately. The sale
is open to the campus at large and
not restricted to sophomores.
