# SATURDAY GAMES END CONFERENCE FOOTBALL SEASON
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2. (/P)—
Western football has practically run
j its course for 1928 but the trail it has j
: left behind is paved with the most j
impressive performances in its grid
iron history.
On the Coast Saturday, Southern
California's Trojans, flushed with the
■ confidence that denotes a successful
season, ran riot through the ranks of
an invading Notre Dame eleven to
swamp the visitors under a 27-14 1
score. Eighty thousand spectators,
crowded into the Los Angeles Coli
seum, watched the undefeated Tro
jans climax their winning of the Coast
Conference championship with a
brilliant victory over their intersec
tional rivals. In terms of football,
Southern California was just a couple
of touchdowns better than the Rockne- ;
men and dominated the game almost
from start to finish.
Oregon Defeats N.Y.U.
Thanksgiving Day tilts ended the
Coast Conference year with Washing
ton whipping its old-time rival —
Washington State —by a G-0 count,
while Oregon tumbled University of
California at Los Angeles with a 2G-6
defeat. Montana closed a disastrous
year, in which it lost every Confer
ence game, by nosing out Gonzaga,
7-0, while St. Mary's battered its tra
ditional foe, Santa Clara, into 20-7
i submission.
Oregon State, in the second divi
sion, so far as Conference play is
concerned, gave Eastern fans a
Thanksgiving Day thrill by cleaning
up on New York University in the
latter's bailiwick, 25-13. Oregon State
bowed to Southern California, Ore
gon, and Washington State, and as
New York was in a position to lay
claim to at least Eastern football
supremacy, the Western style of play
achieved not a little distinction.

ditional foe, Santa Clara, into 20-7
i submission.
Oregon State, in the second divi
sion, so far as Conference play is
concerned, gave Eastern fans a
Thanksgiving Day thrill by cleaning
up on New York University in the
latter's bailiwick, 25-13. Oregon State
bowed to Southern California, Ore
gon, and Washington State, and as
New York was in a position to lay
claim to at least Eastern football
supremacy, the Western style of play
achieved not a little distinction.

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 2. (/P)—
Western football has practically run
j its course for 1928 but the trail it has j
: left behind is paved with the most j
impressive performances in its grid
iron history.
On the Coast Saturday, Southern
California's Trojans, flushed with the
■ confidence that denotes a successful
season, ran riot through the ranks of
an invading Notre Dame eleven to
swamp the visitors under a 27-14 1
score. Eighty thousand spectators,
crowded into the Los Angeles Coli
seum, watched the undefeated Tro
jans climax their winning of the Coast
Conference championship with a
brilliant victory over their intersec
tional rivals. In terms of football,
Southern California was just a couple
of touchdowns better than the Rockne- ;
men and dominated the game almost
from start to finish.
Oregon Defeats N.Y.U.
Thanksgiving Day tilts ended the
Coast Conference year with Washing
ton whipping its old-time rival —
Washington State —by a G-0 count,
while Oregon tumbled University of
California at Los Angeles with a 2G-6
defeat. Montana closed a disastrous
year, in which it lost every Confer
ence game, by nosing out Gonzaga,
7-0, while St. Mary's battered its tra
ditional foe, Santa Clara, into 20-7
i submission.
