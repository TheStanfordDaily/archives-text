# CARDS FEATURE EASTERN ROUT WITH 26-0 VICTORY OVER ARMY
## Stanford Team at Peak of Form Outplays Cadets Throughout Game 
### MILTON SILVERMAN 
Four Stanford backfield men, each
playing for the last time on a Stan
ford varsity football team, buckled
down with a youngster or two to im
press upon the minds of New Yorkers
that, a western eleven is a thing to
bo feared. Oregon State first broached
the subject on Thanksgiving Day
when it handed the powerful N.Y.U.
aggregation a 26-13 drubbing. Stan
ford offered final proof Saturday
when they ran the West Point Cadets
to earth with a score of 2C-0.
And the Army may seriously con
sider the advisability of dropping
football and other rough activities,
and get back to facing howitzers and
ruining rebellions.
Backfield Strong
These four men, mentioned above,
were Hoffman, Sims, Lewis, and Wil
ton; and in the minds of Coach Biff
Jones, Captain Sprague, and Red
Cagle, there would have been little
or no hard feelings if the four had
been excused from active football
since the Big Game.
Stopping the great Cagle, Army's
gift, to football, time and again, hold
ing him at the line, downing him in
the open field, breaking into his pass
ing attack, Stanford proved its de
fensive strength. And then unleashing
an offensive that would have done
them credit on any battlefield, the
Cards crashed through the Army wall,
skirted its flanks, and let forth such
an overhead barrage that the power
of West Point vanished in a tactful
retreat.
Deceptive Plays Used
Enlightenment dawned for the East
erners in the form of reverses, de
layed bucks, cut-back plays—of later
al passes, fake passes, and real passes
I that pried their way through the
1 Army secondary defense for long
; gains.
Cagle may have been Cagle Satur
day, even though he led the hopeless
1 cause of the Cadets. Throughout most
of the game, however, he was only a
menace. Instead, there came as the
| stars of the conflict, eight Cardinals
who, today, are more praised in New
ork than they ever were in Cali
fornia.
Hoffman Outstanding
Leading the power of Stanford was
Captain Biff Hoffman, who terminated
his grid career in what sport writers
are wont to term a "blaze of glory,"
in place of a better term. For, Satur
day, Biff was the center of attraction
in the Yankee Stadium. Passes radi
ated from his good right arm, long
punts from his equally good right
foot, and power from all of his 186
pounds.
Vieing for brilliancy in the Cardi
nal backfield were Bob Sims, Frankie
j Wilton', and Spud Lewis, the veterans,
and Lud Frentrup, the "youngster."
Sims, general handy man of the
j varsity, came into his own as a star
; when lie ended three years of hard
tackling and beautiful interference-
I running by handing out an assortment
! of reverses and bucks, and taking
I more than his share of the passes.
Wilton, Lewis Star
Wilton finished his period of tackle
punishing by demonstrating the ap-
I proved methods of liis famed off-:
; tackle smear. To Lewis goes the J
credit for the unusually large number ;
of intercepted or incompleted Army
1 tosses. The nervy Card quarterback j
i can also claim a goodly share of the !
yardage-gained total, after his display
; of offensive drive.
j Frentrup provided the only long run
; of the afternoon —morning, Pacific
, time —when he scooped up a pass
with one hand and galloped 64 yards
to the goal line.
Line Powerful
New York, and especially Coach
Biff Jones, will long remember the
play of the Stanford line. With tiny
' Walt Heinecke madder and better

j than ever, at center, and Post, Ro
jbesky, and Driscoll at the guard berths,
the Cardinal defense remained cool,
calm, and unsullied, meanwhile rip
ping to shreds any Army plays that
I came near and ploughing huge holes
i through which the Card backs could
I carry footballs, drive hearses, or do
| most anything.
