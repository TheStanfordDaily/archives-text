# Western Avalanche Crushes East's Greatest Teams During Holidays

NEW YORK, Dec. 2. (#>)—Whether
or not the brand of football played
in the Far West is essentially better
than that played east of the Missis
sippi, the fact today is that after a
three-day period of spectacular inter
sectional rivalry, the score stands:
Pacific Coast 80; East 27.
Three smashing triumphs, two on
Eastern soil and one on the West
Coast, offer by far the most striking
accomplishments by the college grid
iron forces of any one sector in a
; season fast drawing to a close in the
bewilderment of its inconsistencies,
the astonishing character of its up
sets, and the immensity of its popular
interest as displayed in the cold fig
ures of record attendance and gate
receipts.
Two Colleges Unbeaten
Not even the fact that Boston Col
lege, alone of the Eastern clan, and
Detroit, alone of the Middle Western
troupe, were winding up unbeaten
seasons in brilliant fashion yesterday,
could take away the spotlight from
the Far Western avalanche.
Here were two of the East's ac
knowledged leaders, two teams with
a brace of the country's greatest stars
in Ken Strong of N.Y.U., and Red
Cagle of West Point; two well-knit,
powerful aggregations coached by
Chick Meehan and Biff Jones, majors
of strategy. Yet they were both out
classed, beyond the palest shadow of
argument.
Favorites Defeated
Less than a week after Eastern
critics were acclaiming New York's
Violets as one of the greatest in the
country, following their triumph over
Carnegie, Strong and Company were
being smothered by an Oregon horde
led by chunky Howard Maple. Exact
ly a week after the husky Army team
had walloped the formidable Nebras
lcans, Cagle and his clan were being
routed disastrously by the white
shirted Stanford host coached by Pop
Warner and led by Biff Hoffman, who
earned his nickname by the way he
smashes a line.
Two of the East's best not only
were licked but were overwhelmed.
Their defenses were battered, they
were bewildered by the speed and
deception of the invaders, and their
attacks were almost smothered by the
defensive bulwarks of those hard
charging lads from the Pacific Coast.
Strength of West Proved
Neither Oregon State nor Stanford
were good enough to win the Pacific
Coast Conference championship. The
Beavers were beaten by California,
Washington State, and the University
of Oregon. Yet they had enough stuff
left to trim the mighty Violets. Stan
ford was beaten by Southern Califor
nia thereby being put out of the run
ning of the Coast, but the Cardinals
looked as powerful yesterday as any
team in the country.
Stanford turned loose enough
power before 86,000 at the Yankee
Stadium yesterday to score seven or
eight touchdowns. Only the most
courageous defensive work by the
Cadets prevented the contest from
being more one-sided than it was. The
Cardinal line ripped the soldiers' for-
Vvvmwuuvu
ward wall to bits, Biff Hoffman out
passed Cagle with the aid of better
protection, and Stanford's great array
lof ball-carriers outrushed the Army
| nearly four to one, whether figured in
I yardage or first downs.
The only thing now that stands in
I the path of a Far Western sweep in
the intersectional tussle for this cam
paign is Georgia Tech's Tornado,
j which will sweep out of the South
i to play California in the New Year's
Day game at Pasadena.
NEW YORK, Dec. 2. (/P) —Christian
1 Keener (Red) Cagle, of Merryville,
La., tiie Army's outstanding football
star and an All-American backfield
candidate, will captain West Point's
team in 1929.
