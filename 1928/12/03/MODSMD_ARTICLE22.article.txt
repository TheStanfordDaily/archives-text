# The 						Bonfire Ought To Be Abolished
## 
### 
What good end does the bonfire serve ? There are many students
who would like to hear an intelligent discussion of this question, for
the problem of what to do about the annual Big Game bonfire is one of
the most important now facing us.
The Daily's opinion is that the bonfire has outgrown its period of
usefulness. In the heyday of Stanford bonfires, when everyone took a
deep dislike for the University of California along about the third week
in November, and when something gigantic like an 80-foot pyre was
needed to arouse interest in what it was hoped the varsity would do,
there was good cause to ask, nay demand, that freshmen devote fifteen
or twenty hours to building and guarding bonfires. But now changed
circumstances argue the need for abolishing this ancient institution:
J The Lower Division is to be steadily reduced; so that the work of
construction will become an increasingly great burden upon each
freshman.
2 No longer is there need of igniting many cubic yards of good wood
to inflame interest in a game which receives such universal attention.
We believe that time and talent would be better spent in organizing good
rally programs than in heaping up railroad ties and packing boxes.
The attitude of the student body at large is such that it would be
fairly impossible to get the services of all students in building a
great, official A.S.S.U. Bonfire.
Many prate endlessly about Stanford spirit being fostered by a
bonfire. In the years when the pyre escapes premature combustion, the
sophomores and upperclassmen stroll out to watch the flames lick up
the California coffin, then stroll home again. No hearty interest is
shown. In the years when the whole student body has to turn out at
the last minute and build the fire, everyone is so tired by the time the
thing burns that lie refuses to shout evangelically for team, coach, and
college.
Perhaps we misinterpret the attitude of the students toward the
bonfire. Whatever it is, it should be expressed, and action for or against
bonfires should be taken by the Associated Students.
