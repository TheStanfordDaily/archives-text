# Campus Opinions Must Be Signed
## 
### 
The Daily received last week one campus opinion which was libelous,
one which was unsigned, and one which was signed only with initials, yet
which contained an attack, highly colored with personal bias, upon the
Rally Committee.
The libelous letter we shall not print; the unsigned letter we refuse
to print until the author is disclosed; and in regard to the third letter,
we have a new policy to announce: we shall refuse, at our own discretion,
to print any serious charge against a person or an organization except
over the name of the writer.
