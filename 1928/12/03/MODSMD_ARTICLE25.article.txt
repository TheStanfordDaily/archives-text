# Fancied Metropolitan Advantages

The Daily Trojan, official publication of the University of Southern
California, again editorializes on the advantage of a university's being in a
large city. The editorial (written by a woman) is evidently not in the
least influenced by the lack of campus at U.S.C. and the presence of it
at other institutions in California. Entitled Metropolitan, it eulogizes on
Southern California's situation as follows:
"We do not realize the tremendous advantages of location we have here
at U.S.C. over other universities. To begin with we are in a very large city
and enjoy the advantages that only a large city can give. We have the
finest in music Just this past week Fritz Kreisler and Sousa gave
wonderful concerts. In a few more months we will be able to enjoy an
other famous opera company."
It is with appreciation rather than complacence that we recall that on the
Stanford campus alone we have heard Lawrence Tibbett, Sousa, Toscha
Seidel and Louis Graveure this quarter, to say nothing of other cultural
treats available on the campus and in San Francisco.
Why must a university be situated in a noisy city of a million distrac
tions? Why is it necessary to tolerate the distractions and disturbances
of speeding police carts and clanging street cars on "the campus" just to
enjoy cultural entertainment provided by artists who are willing to per
form in the seclusion of an isolated campus?
To stop learning and start studying is the advice of a Columbia
University professor to all who would be liberally educated. A student
can't study, however, if lie has to spend all his time learning facts.
