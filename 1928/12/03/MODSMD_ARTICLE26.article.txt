The Stanford varsity polled a total
of 444 electoral votes Saturday, quite
generally sweeping the country.

Array got mixed up in a lot of Red
tape, which proved thoroughly ad

very invincible on the barred turf.

It was a great victory by civil

Watch enrolment in the R.O.T.C.
go down!

Let's all send in an applause card
to this cadet whom they designate as
Cagle. A man has to he good to show
up as Ail-American when tacklers
like Sims, Robesky, and Heinecke are
out after him.

We feel that Biff Hoffman has
now redeemed himself for mak
ing those phonograph records. But
he will have to run 100 yards to
a touchdown before we forgive
him for some of the steaks he
serves downtown.

At last "Roast Biff Hoffman" has
ceased to be the cry of the sport
writing dyspeptics.

"You are listening in on the Army-
Stanford game in the Yankee Sta
dium. This is the voice of G. Andrew
McNamee speaking over National
Bombast. Well, they're going at it
again down there. Army substituted
a man for —let's see, I think it's Allan
—well they're starting play now, so
I'll get it for you later. Frentrup of
Stanford took the ball on a reverse.
He's away now; Frentry cut in
through right tackle and it looks as
if he's made a first down. They're
piled up on him and I can't see, but
I'll tell you in a minute. No, he seems
to have missed it by about a yard.
Oh! That was a beautiful play. Let
me describe it to you.
passed the ball to Sims, who handed
it to Hoffman, and Hoffman doubled
back and passed it to Frentry—Frent
rup, rather. Frentry cut through guard
and, eluding the Army's worn-out sec
ondary defense, burst down the side
lines to the —let me see —I—ha, ha,
it's pretty hard to tell where the ball
is, but I'll have it for you in a minute.
Make no mistake, these Stanford men
are sweeping the Army off its feet —
simply demoralizing it. Let me see
now, Frentrup took the ball about fif
teen, twenty, twenty-two yards to the
Army's five-yard line. Let me explain
that you haven't missed anything dur
ing this description, as the Army has
taken time out, and believe me,
they're tired. They're sprawled out.
The Stanford men are all standing up,
and they're playing a wonderful game.
I'll cut you in now on the Cadet
band."
It is nearly as nerve-wracking
to listen to the radio broadcast
of a game as to watch it.

That is one reason why people are
willing to pay $5 for football tickets.

Gord! Why did the Board of Ath
letic Control schedule that game for
New York? Stanford rooters have
been waiting all season to see the
varsity get organized; so it packed its
trunks and went three thousand miles
away to do that.

Bob Sims was the man who earned
everyone's heartfelt thanks for the
way in which he nailed Cagle each
time that slippery youth threatened
to get loose. Patrons of the game may
remember that Mr. Sims played an
excellent game of football on Nov. 24
in Berkeley, Cal. On the basis of
these performances particularly, we
have placed Sims on our all-coast
eleven. We haven't yet named the
other ten men, although at the mo
mnt we can think of three men play
ing in the center of the Stanford line
whom we should carefully consider.

It seems to be well established
that everybody came through last
Saturday. But none, we should
say, more gloriously than Cap
tain Biff Hoffman. Hoffman has
been given plenty of criticism
this season, and not all of it has
been undeserved, but Biff broke
into the all-American spotlight in
New York. Old muscle-bound
Biff! Hooray!

Riegels is next year's California
captain, Barragar U.S.C.'s —both cen
ters. As this is fed into the linotype,
no Stanford choice has been made,
but everyone admits the possibility
of Heinecke's being the Cardinals'
1H29 leader. Linemen are given little
consideration by the crowds, but very
often team captains are chosen from
among them. Linemen play more con
sistently than baekfield men.
Jessup of Washington is 6 feet 7.
If Heinecke is the Stanford captain
next year, there will be a laugh when
lie, measuring 5 feet 6, shakes hands
with the towering Washingtonian.
