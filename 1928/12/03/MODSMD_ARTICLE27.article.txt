KNUTE ROCKNE
Said Knute Rockne, "Better foot
ball can be developed at colleges
where there are no women." This
was in answer to the question, what
of the Big Ten this year? Unper
turbed by that question he had an
swered the above and went on to
say, "Newspapers had me wrong. 1
didn't say co-education is bad for
football."
"Mr. Rockne, how will your team
stack up with S.C. this year?"
To this, shrewd, pug-faced Rockne
replied, "I always did think Stanford
had the prettiest campus in the coun
try. Stanford and Princeton have
the two prettiest campuses. Of course
they're different, I like them both."
Since he wouldn't give out any in
formation along the lines taken, I de
cided to fiind out more about his at
titude towards co-education in its re
lation to football. "Upon what do
you base your conclusion concerning
non-co-educational institutions being
better for football?"
"Sleep, study, and football are the
three ingredients of the football man's

, twenty-four hours. Give him a girl
j and one of the three is going to suf- I
j fer. And they all have 'em at co
educational colleges."
"Were you surprised, Mr. Rockne,
:to see S.C. beat Stanford?" (This in
-1 terview occurred at Notre Dame the
j Friday prior to the Big Game).
"When 1 talked to Pop Warner in
Europe last summer, he seemed to
think he had the game on ice."
Thus ended a five-minute conver
sation with the man who turned loose
the Four Horsemen to ravage the
football countryside and whose teams
have whipped everything from Tro
jans to Army berserks.
Exemplary of Rockne strategy is !
the following. Carnegie Tech whip- !
ped Notre Dame last year. Rockne '
never mentioned it to the team after j
the game. The night before the team !
left to play S.C. each man found in !
his suitcase a copy of the Carnegie |
Tech newspaper published after the
Notre Dame game. Glaring headlines
told of Notre Dame's defeat. Notre ;
Dame whipped S.C.
—Calvin D. Wood.

ball can be developed at colleges
where there are no women." This
was in answer to the question, what
of the Big Ten this year? Unper
turbed by that question he had an
swered the above and went on to
say, "Newspapers had me wrong. 1
didn't say co-education is bad for
football."
"Mr. Rockne, how will your team
stack up with S.C. this year?"
To this, shrewd, pug-faced Rockne
replied, "I always did think Stanford
had the prettiest campus in the coun
try. Stanford and Princeton have
the two prettiest campuses. Of course
they're different, I like them both."
Since he wouldn't give out any in
formation along the lines taken, I de
cided to fiind out more about his at
titude towards co-education in its re
lation to football. "Upon what do
you base your conclusion concerning
non-co-educational institutions being
better for football?"
"Sleep, study, and football are the
three ingredients of the football man's

, twenty-four hours. Give him a girl
j and one of the three is going to suf- I
j fer. And they all have 'em at co
educational colleges."
"Were you surprised, Mr. Rockne,
:to see S.C. beat Stanford?" (This in
-1 terview occurred at Notre Dame the
j Friday prior to the Big Game).
"When 1 talked to Pop Warner in
Europe last summer, he seemed to
think he had the game on ice."
Thus ended a five-minute conver
sation with the man who turned loose
the Four Horsemen to ravage the
football countryside and whose teams
have whipped everything from Tro
jans to Army berserks.
Exemplary of Rockne strategy is !
the following. Carnegie Tech whip- !
ped Notre Dame last year. Rockne '
never mentioned it to the team after j
the game. The night before the team !
left to play S.C. each man found in !
his suitcase a copy of the Carnegie |
Tech newspaper published after the
Notre Dame game. Glaring headlines
told of Notre Dame's defeat. Notre ;
Dame whipped S.C.
