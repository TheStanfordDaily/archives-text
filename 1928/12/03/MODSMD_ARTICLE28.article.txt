Natural Conduct: Principles of Prac
tical Ethics. By Edwin B. Cope
land. (Stanford University Press,
1928. $3.50.)
As the title implies, here is a book
concerned with laying down the car
dinal principles of practical ethics to
fit the present scheme of life. The au
thor believes that youth today suffers
from a lack of sound ethical train
ing. He says, "Our public education
pays utterly inadequate attention to
the principles of conduct and to the
nature and promotion of happiness.
In this writer's belief, it is a still
more disquieting fact that this neg
lect endangers the stability of our
culture and the future of our race."
With this need in mind, he pro
ceeds to present a code of ethics
based on the teachings of modern
biology—the ethical code of the sci
entist. The author adheres to the
belief that all conduct favorable to
the survival of the race is good,
right, and wise; all conduct preju
dicial to theprospect of survival is
bad, foolish, wrong, or sinful.
Although Mr. Copeland claims that
the attitude of science is maintained
throughout, the average college stu
dent will feel as he reads this book
that the author often gets off the
track. He gets his scientific atti
tude mixed up with strongly condi
tioned reactions based on early reli
gious training and prejudice.
Naturally this system of ethics
based on teaching of science affirms
many of the old, familiar ideals, codes,
and virtues. As a usual thing, the
older they are the more thoroughly
they have demonstrated their surviv
al value. But the student-reader will
feel that too many of the old virtues
and ideals are revived, brushed up,
and presented, blushing with modesty,
to a wild modern generation.
But youth is rash, and the judg
ments of youth are incautious. May

be when he reaches middle age or
beyond he will agree with Mr. Cope- i
land that woman's place is in the ;
home (!) and that chastity is one of j
life's greatest virtues.
In the meantime, we take back all
things we said about the mod- :
ern scientific attitude. We actually :
blamed it for most of the unduly '
progressive ideas fermenting in the j
head of youth today.

to a wild modern generation.
But youth is rash, and the judg
ments of youth are incautious. May

be when he reaches middle age or
beyond he will agree with Mr. Cope- i
land that woman's place is in the ;
home (!) and that chastity is one of j
life's greatest virtues.
In the meantime, we take back all
things we said about the mod- :
ern scientific attitude. We actually :
blamed it for most of the unduly '
progressive ideas fermenting in the j
head of youth today.

Natural Conduct: Principles of Prac
tical Ethics. By Edwin B. Cope
land. (Stanford University Press,
1928. $3.50.)
As the title implies, here is a book
concerned with laying down the car
dinal principles of practical ethics to
fit the present scheme of life. The au
thor believes that youth today suffers
from a lack of sound ethical train
ing. He says, "Our public education
pays utterly inadequate attention to
the principles of conduct and to the
nature and promotion of happiness.
In this writer's belief, it is a still
more disquieting fact that this neg
lect endangers the stability of our
culture and the future of our race."
With this need in mind, he pro
ceeds to present a code of ethics
based on the teachings of modern
biology—the ethical code of the sci
entist. The author adheres to the
belief that all conduct favorable to
the survival of the race is good,
right, and wise; all conduct preju
dicial to theprospect of survival is
bad, foolish, wrong, or sinful.
Although Mr. Copeland claims that
the attitude of science is maintained
throughout, the average college stu
dent will feel as he reads this book
that the author often gets off the
track. He gets his scientific atti
tude mixed up with strongly condi
tioned reactions based on early reli
gious training and prejudice.
Naturally this system of ethics
based on teaching of science affirms
many of the old, familiar ideals, codes,
and virtues. As a usual thing, the
older they are the more thoroughly
they have demonstrated their surviv
al value. But the student-reader will
feel that too many of the old virtues
and ideals are revived, brushed up,
and presented, blushing with modesty,
to a wild modern generation.
