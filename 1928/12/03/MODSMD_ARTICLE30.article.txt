# '28 BASKETBALL SEASON TO OPEN TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford basketball enthusiasts will
have their first opportunity to view
Coach "Husky" Hunt's 1928 team
when the Cardinals open their sched
ule with a pre-seasou game with the
San Jose State Teachers College
Spartans tomorrow night in the Stan
ford Pavilion. The contest will begin
at 7:30 o'clock.
Three of the most promising can
didates for this year's live, Captain
Harlow Rothert, Chuck Smalling, and
Greer Thompson are in New York
City with the football squad; so Coach
Hunt has not yet selected his starting
lineup.
Tampke and Reynolds, first string
guards on the 1927 freshman team,
are the most likely candidates to fill
the temporary vacancies left by Koth
ert and Thompson. Both these men
are valuable offensive players in ad
dition to their ability at defense.
John McCandless or William Okker
will begin the game as center in place
of Smalling, first string pivot man
from last season's varsity, or Jim
Mears, promising sophomore candi
date who is ill with the "flu." Mc-
Candless was a member of the var
sity squad two years ago, but did
not return to college last year. He is
a big man and plays a rough and
tumble brand of basketball. Okker is
a newcomer who is developing rap
idly.
Choice of forwards lies among Berg,
Clark, and Richards, members of last
year's varsity, and Hawkins, Fawcett,
Hepp and Loomis, sophomores.
