# GERMAN CONSUL TO SPEAK HERE ON AFGHANISTAN
## 
### 
"The Closed Land, Afghanistan, and
the Diplomatic Mission in 1915," will
he the subject of a lecture by the
German Consul General in San Fran
cisco, Dr. W. O. von Hentig, in the
Little Theatre tomorrow evening at
7:30 o'clock.
At the age of twenty-nine Dr. von
Hentig was dispatched to Afghanis
tan by the German government, and
succeeded in reaching that country
easily, but after caryying out his
mission, he was forced to return to
Germany by the eastern route across
the continent of Asia because enemy
troops blocked the usual route. With
incredible physical endurance, von
Hentig went from Bagdad to Shang
hai on horseback and on foot, through
enemy spies and outposts, through
the salt desert of Persia, taking about
130 days to cross the Desert of Gobi,
and over the Hindu-Kush Mountains,
14,000 feet high, where his entire
party was attacked by mountain sick
ness. Often during this trip he was
without food, water, or fodder.
From Shanghai he stowed away on
a ship bound for the United States,
but found in Japan that America had

[entered the war. He remained on
! board the ship, and when it entered
the harbor at Honolulu, Dr. von Hen
tig jumped out of a porthole with his
bag, and swam to shore. He turned
himself over to officials of the United
States government, and through them
was given safe passport to Germany
because of his rights as a diplomat.
Thus after a trip around the world,
he reached Germany two years after
leaving Afghanistan.
