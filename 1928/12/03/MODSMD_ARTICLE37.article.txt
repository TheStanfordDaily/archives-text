## 
### 
CHICAGO, Dec. 2. (A 3 ) —Anthony
Fokker, who has built 11,000 airplanes
' since 1911, has designed a giant 32-
| passenger monoplane which will be
put into operation on a 36-hour trans- j
continental flying schedule between
New York and the Pacific Coast next j
| year.
The planes will have a high speed
;of 145 miles an hour, Fokker said,
will climb 1400 feet from the ground
in the first minute, and maintain a
| maximum altitude of 18,000 feet. The
I span of the wing will be 100 feet and
the over-all length of the ship 65 feet. I
Fokker said he hoped to be able to
; turn out the giant ships at the rate
!of two each month in the Hasbrouck
Heights, N.J., factory, which will be |
devoted to this construction work. I
The luxurious air liners, the first of !
which is now under construction at
' the Fokker plant in Hasbrouck
Heights, N.J., are to be similar in |
general appearance and construction !
to the Fokker planes used by Com
mander Byrd across the Atlantic, j
Lieutentants Maitland and Hegenber- j
ger to Hawaii, and the Southern j
Cross flight from California to Austra- :
lia.
