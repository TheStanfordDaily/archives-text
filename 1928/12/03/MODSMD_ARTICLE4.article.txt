# Orientals Score Race Prejudice At Conference
## Student Institute of Pacific Relations Holds Meet At Montezuma 
### MAXINE CUSHING 
"Americans can do three things
right now to help the Oriental," said
one of the Japanese delegates to the
Student Institute of Pacific Relations.
"You in this group can begin by re
moving your own race prejudice and
bringing your friends as well to
realize its uselessness; most import
ant, instead of considering all Orient
als as a single classification treat us
as individuals."
Criticism of this "lump classifica
tion" of Orientals was several times
made at the conference, held at Mon
tezuma School during the past week
end. The group maintained that in
contacts between East and West em
phasis should be laid on the person
ality of the individuals, that the Ori
ental should be considered not as one
of a foreign race and therefore due
to be patronized, but rather as an
other person who may or may not be
interesting in himself.
One problem the Institute consid
ered was means of increasing con
tacts between students of different
nationalities, since it was obvious that
informal propinquity leads most di
| rectly to understanding. Living to
i gether was agreed upon as the ideal
i means of establishing informal con
tacts; other suggestions were work
i ing together in student enterprises
I and problems, and fostering informal
; social contact. In every case, the
i group agreed, the emphasis should be
lon the equal participation of indi
j viduals, totally divorced from any
i idea of "being kind to foreign stu-
I dents."
