Paintings of California landscapes
and a Grand Canyon scene by Charles
H. Harmon of San Jose, went on ex
hibit at the Stanford Art Gallery yes
terday and will continue through De
cember 30. There are about forty
j paintings in many sizes. Most of them
' are painted on horizontal, rectangular
j canvases. Some are nearly square;
others are much longer.
The paintings depict spring, au
itumn, and winter scenes, mountains,
trees, valleys, and scenes by the
ocean. Harmon's paintings are of a
poetic nature. In some of them, the
whole color scheme is blended into a
quiet harmony such as "Autumn in
Humboldt," "Spring in Santa Clara
Valley," and "Path of Spring." Others
show more contrast in their tonal
values such as "Mt. Diana," "Asiloniar
Dunes," and "Autumn at Almaden,"
while some are more virile with de
cided darks and lights like "Autumn,"
"Carmel Bay from Pt. Lobos," and
"Surf."
