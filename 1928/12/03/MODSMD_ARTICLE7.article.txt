# FOUR GAMES TO CONCLUDE TOUCH FOOTBALL SEASON
## 
### 
Final games of the intramural
touch football season, which were
scheduled for Thanksgiving Day, will
be played tomorrow according to
Charles Davis, director of intramural
sports. All games will start promptly
at 4:15 o'clock.
The winners of the four leagues
will meet in post-season contests to
determine the University champion.
A trophy will be awarded to the final
victor. Twenty-two organizations en
tered teams in the competition.
Touch football is not included in
the regular intramural program this
year, but is going through a trial
period. Its success has been so
marked, according to Davis, that
there is little doubt that the Intra
mural Committee will include it on
the regular schedule next season.
Tomorrow's schedule is as follows:
Field Teams
I. Zeta Psi vs. Theta Chi.
11. Breakers vs. El Tigre.
111. Delta Chi vs. Zeta 7heta Pi.
IV. Kappa Alpha vs. Alpha Delta Phi.
