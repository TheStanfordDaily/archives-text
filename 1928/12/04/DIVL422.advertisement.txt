The ARCHLAST EIGHT
Keep Your Feet Healthy
The Archlast Eight involves a principle in shoe-making which checks the foot
difficulties with which men are threatened. We are no longer pedestrians—we're
motorists—and as a result we are weakening the muscles of our feet; we are
undermining, as it were, the foundations of our metatarsal arch. The ARCHLAST
EIGHT is designed to prevent rather than cure arch troubles. A concealed steel
support, tempered and moulded to hold the arch in proper and natural position,
and still to allow the foot to function properly under any condition.
This steel support is always the same—no matter how old the shoe is—it never sags.
