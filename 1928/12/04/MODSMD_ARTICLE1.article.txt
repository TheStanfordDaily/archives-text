# CONGRESS FINDS SECTIONAL BILLS AWAITING ACTION
## Tariff and Farm Problems To Receive Attention of Lame Duck Congressmen House Files 500 Measures; Senate Introduces None in Opening Day Sessions 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. (/P)â€”The
flow of bills into the hoppers of Con
gress was of rivulet size today com
pared with the torrent which gushed
forth a year ago when more than 6000
pieces of embryo legislation were pre
sented to the House and Senate.
The measures forthcoming today
were all from the House side and
were of sectional rather than national
concern with the exception of several
<!ealing with the tariff and farm prob
lem. All the bills, including the tariff
and farm measures, were referred to
committees. The Senate ledger failed
tc show a bill introduced.
The total number deposited in the
House bill basket was estimated by
clerks at about 500. Many of this
number, however, were old proposals
dressed up in new legislative rain
ni ent.
Those drawing major attention, in
view of the contemplated complete
revision of the tariff law, were the
ones by Representative Williamson,
Republican, South Dakota; Taylor,
Democrat, Colorado, and Howard,
Democrat, Oklahoma, proposing tariff
modifies, principally farm.
The Williamson proposal would
increase the duty on onions and cattle
rate changes on a number of com
hides while Howard's would increase
(lie tariff on imported crude oil and
would place duties on all imported
petroleum distillates.

Of the several resolutions one was
by Representative Leavitt, Repub
lican, Montana, would create a Con
cessional committee to study and

then report to the next Congress on
proposed amendments to the Consti
tution fixing a new time for the meet
ing of Congress to eliminate "Lame
Duck" sessions.

Representative McLeod, Republican,
Michigan, re-offered a proposal pre
sented last year to make reapportion
ment of Representatives the first
business before the House and to de
termine whether the House wanted
the number of Representatives to ex
ced 435.

Another proposal by Laguardia, Re
publican, New York, sougnt to revise
and make more stringent the shipping
laws in an effort to improve safety
at sea. He also submitted a bill to
fix the liability of owners and masters
of seagoing vessels in case of loss of
cargoes by fire and other disaster.
