# DEATH TOLL OF CHILE QUAKE MOUNTS HIGHER
## 
### 
CHILE, Dec. 3. (/P)â€”The death toll
and property damage from Saturday's
earthquake, centering at Talca and
Constitution, continued to grow to
day. This afternoon the known deaths
numbered 218, the seriously injured
257, the slightly injured more than
2000, and the homeless in the neigh
borhood of 20,000.
The situation in Talca and Constitu
tion was disheartening. Both places
were in ruins and the injured were
without shelter from rain which
started today. Efforts were being
made to remove the more seriously
hurt to this city.
National subscriptions for relief of
the earthquake sufferers were well
under way tonight.
