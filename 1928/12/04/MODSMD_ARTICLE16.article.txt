# Cards Will Open 1928 Basketball Schedule Tonight
## Three Stanford Cagers in East With Cardinal Football Team 
### 
Basketball will make its first bid
for campus interest at 7:30 o'clock to
il ight in the Pavilion when Coach
Husky Hunt sends his varsity against
the San Jose State Teachers College
quintet.
With ail-American and all-Coast se
lection uppermost in the collegiate
mind, Old Man Football is still in
lus heyday. He claims three veteran
cagers, Captain Harlow Rothert, Red
Thompson, and Chuck Smalling, who
are en route from New York with the
Stanford eleven, so the Cards will not
have their full strength on the floor.
The Cardinals have the best ma
terial and the best prospects that they
have had in recent years. Seven let
termen and a number of good pros
pects from last year's sensational
freshman team furnish at least two
good men to fight for each position.
Last year Hunt was hampered by the
fact that the Card grid season did
not close until New Year's, but this
year he will get an earlier opportunity
to get a line on his men.
The starting lineup for tonight will
be: McCandless, center; Berg and
Fawcett, forwards; Tampcke and
Reynolds, guards. Fawcett, Tampcke,
and Reynolds are all sophomores and
riiey will give any of the veterans a
good fight for their positions. Mc-
Candless, who is an experienced cen
ter and also a forward, was conceded
a place on the varsity last season but
did not return to college.
Bill Clark and Dowell Richards,
both lettermen, are experienced for
wards and will see action in tonight's
tilt. Hunt will probably use a large
number of substitutes to get a line
on the combinations that work well.
