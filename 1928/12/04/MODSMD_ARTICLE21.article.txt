# TICKET SALE OPENS AT CLUBHOUSE FOR MYSTERY THRILLER
## 
### 
Visit the "Hounted House"!
All students who enjoy the
thrills attendant on strange
faces appearing behind doors,
irregular disappearance of guns,
and clanging chains in dark
rooms, are hereby invited to visit
Gordon Davis' exhibition of the
"Haunted House" Saturday night
in the Assembly Hall.
The Dramatic Council is issu
ing the invitation, and will be
present in front of the Women's
Clubhouse to see that no one is
disappointedâ€”at least not if
they produce $1 or $1.50 for the
tickets.
"The Haunted House" is one
of the good old mystery thrillers
which have been so popular in
the last year. Following the
early lead of "The Bat" and "The
Cat and the Canary," later plays
as "The Dracula" and "The
Spider" have continued to tickle
the spines of play patrons and
retain popular favor. Gordon
Davis' offering is as good as all
these.
