Herbert Hoover as "the man des
tiny has been training" to meet the
emergencies created by the World
War was eulogized in a moving pic
ture entitled "The Master of Emer
gencies" presented last night in the
auditorium by the committee on pub
lic exercises. The picture was assem
bled and edited by Will Irwin, Stan
ford alumnus and author of the out
standing biography of Hoover.
The densely populated districts of
Belgium, invaded by the Germans and
blockaded by the Allies, were first
shown in the picture. Hoover's life,
including several scenes at Stanford,
was then traced. The starving peoples
of Belgium, Germany, Austria, France,
Poland, and the relief measures taken
by the Hoover organization were pic
tured.
The task of organizing the Depart
ment of Commerce, under Presidents
Harding and Coolidge, was described,
and scenes during the Mississippi
flood of 1927 were shown. The picture
closed with a view of the crowd as
sembled in the Stanford Stadium dur
ing Hoover's speech accepting the
Republican nomination for President.
