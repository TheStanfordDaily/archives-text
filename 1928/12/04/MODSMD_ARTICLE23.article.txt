# ROOTING SECTION PAYS TRIBUTE TO DEFEATED TEAM
## 
### 
The fightin' Irish, sorely crushed
[on the gridiron by the Thundering
! Herd of Southern California, were
j paid tribute last Saturday by U.S.C.'s
13000 rooters in the most colorful
I stunts that the West has ever seen.
At half-time, two sections of the
Trojan band entered the Coliseum
playing their famous War Song. They
were dressed in red and gold and
were led by a youngster 7 years old.
In a few minutes two more sections,
dressed in Gaelic costumes of white
and green, marched onto the turf
playing "When Irish Eyes Are Smil-
I ing." They formed a huge "N.D." and
j saluted the Notre Dame side of the
J stadium. The four sections then com
j bined and formed the word "Trojan,"
! stretching the length of the field.
While the band was marching and
I playing, the U.S.C. rooting section
performed "card stunts," spelling
"Notre Dame" first and then the fol
lowing stunts: "We Greet You"; A
Trojan knight shaking hands with an
Irishman, both 75 feet tall; A giant
shamrock; An armed knight gallop
ing across the rooting section.
The last stunt was "Farewell to"
followed by "Jesse," "Don," "Lloyd,"
"Lowrv," "Charley," "Hilton," and
"Hersh," the nicknames of players
j who were ending their football
icareers.
