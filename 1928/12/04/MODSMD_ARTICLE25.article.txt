# GUARDS ON CARD TEAM SELECTED BY ALL COACHES
## Choosing All-Star Football Squads Is Now Prevalent Fad of Gridiron Mentors David Walsh Picks Post For All-American Team; Jones Places Robesky as Guard 
### CARROLL O'MEARA 
Stanford's incomparable pair of
guards, Post and Robesky, appear to
be the most popular Cardinals in the
epidemic of all-star selections that is
commencing to afflict the nation.
Each or both of these linesmen have
been chosen on every team selected
to date. None of the backfield men
have been chosen for any of the first
string elevens yet, but after the West
Point game last Saturday in New
York, each seems assured at least of
mention.
David Walsh, sports writer for In
ternational News Service, has chosen
Post for guard on his All-American
squad. The New York Sun also makes
the same choice. Robesky has been
chosen for the same position by How
ard Jones of U.S.C., Zuppke of Illinois,
Roper of Princeton, and McGugin of
Vanderbilt. Both Robesky and Post
have been chosen on every All-Coast
team to date, including those of Pop
Warner, Jones, and the Associated
Tress. These two guards are the only
Westerners to be elected to positions
on any of the All-American teams
that have been announced, however
the West will undoubtedly be given
more lenient consideration when
Knute Rockne, Pop Warner, and Tad
Jones convene to form their mythical
team, the one most generally recog
nized as Walter Camp's successor.
Suthern California has had the most
players chosen for the All-Coast
teams, Williams, Thomas, and Bar
rager receiving honors. Likewise,
California has three players, Phillips,
Lom, and Bancroft. Chuck Carroll of
Washington enjoys almost unanimous
election for either half or fullback.
Maple of Oregon State, Frankian of
St. Mary's, and Dressel, Washington
State, are the only candidates who
are not members of the Conference's
"big three."
