# A 						Notable Woman Is Halide Edib
## 
### 
"Halide Edib's career is an honor to her sex and race," is the judgment
of the Nciv York Times upon Turkey's foremost woman leader.
Madame Edib appears in assembly at 11 o'clock Wednesday morning.
Her program is being sponsored by an anonymous friend of the University
in conjunction with the Committee on Public Exercises, and to our way
of thinking there is nothing the anonymous donor might have done which
would afford the students and faculty of Stanford much more pleasure.
If Madame Halide Edib (who is by preference a novelist, although she is
listed also as a nationalist, dramatist, educator, and orator) can speak from
the rostrum which adorns the Assembly Hall stage as well as she can write,
the hour set aside for her will be nothing short of delightful.

Madame Edib's subject is "The Face and Mind of New Turkey," a
subject which will be newer to the Assembly Hall than such topics as the
outlawry of war and the mixing of gasoline and alcohol. What most of
us know about the face and mind of new Turkey we could put in our hats.
It greatly behooves us to attend the assembly and learn something about
Turkey and alxjut one of the most notable women of our time.
