# Taps on the Hudson—Reveille on the Farm
## 
### 
Stanford's Red Host contributed its share to the West's grid triumph
over the East last week by thoroughly skinning Army's sacred mule. In
that same victory the Cardinals also proved themselves to be the country's
most powerful football team of the 1928 season, deserving of a national
collegiate championship, but cheated of such recognition by "breaks" —a
couple of fumbles in the U.S.C. game and a poor pass in the California
contest.
Stanford plays a sportsmanlike game of football and as these breaks
are a part of the game, the Cardinals accept them as such. If they must
lose even a national title on that account they lose cheerfully. With a
defeat and a tie against them in the results column, the Redshirts can make
no justified bid for the championship, in spite of their overwhelming con
quest of the Generals from the Hudson. However, 75,000 spectators at
the West Point game and some hundreds of thousands of other sports fol
lowers are willing to accept Stanford as the nation's greatest football aggre
gation. They draw their conclusions something like this:
A—Georgetown, Army, Nebraska, Carnegie, and N.Y.U. have all been
eliminated from the running, leaving three westerners, California, Stan
ford, and Southern California, and a southerner, Georgia Tech.
B—California was lucky to tie Southern California; the sloppy field
aided their defense. We all know the story of the Big Game. That leaves
Stanford, Southern California, and Georgia Tech.
C—Georgia Tech has an unspotted record but has not met the oppo
sition that the Cards and Trojans have. The Golden Tornado scored only
two touchdowns on the Irish ; the Trojans scored four.
D—Then as to Stanford and Southern California: Notre Dame beat
West Point 12-6 and held the Trojans to a 27-14 score while the Cards
trounced the Cadets 26-0.
