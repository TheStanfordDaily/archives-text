# Yale in the Blues
## 
### 
A tragic thing has happened to the famous Yale University—so tragic
that both the editor of the Yale Daily Nczvs (a daily paper managed and
issued by the students) and the editor of our own Times have agreed to do
their best to avert the results of the tragedy. There is a dance, a modern
dance—and, therefore, one may fear, a debased and demoralized dance—
which is called the "Yale Blues"; and some people may have derived the
impression that it was invented, or at least danced, at Yale University. So
the editor of the Yale Daily News has written all the way from Connecti
cut to correct this lamentable impression; and the editor of the Times has
leapt to his assistance by giving his communication a full headline of its
own instead of consigning it to the "Points from Letters," where suffragan
bishops struggle from time to time with rear admirals for a little modest
notice. Yale, we are assured, "assumes 110 responsibility" for the Yale
Blues; it "is a self-respecting, educational institution, such as Oxford or
Cambridge," and "not a cheap dance hall where ridiculous and sensuous
steps are originated." But did anyone ever suppose that it was a dance hall
of that character—or, indeed, a dance hall of any kind? It would be a
strange thing if one of the very oldest universities in America, founded as
custodian of the strictest tradition of Calvinism and an institution which
dismissed its rector of 1722 because of his "leaning toward episcopacy,"
had now developed into nothing more than an assembly of dancing masters.
The thing is not probable; it is not even possible. Let them lift up their
hearts at Yale and remember that though there is such a thing as a Cam
bridge sausage no one supposes that Cambridge is exclusively a center of
sausage-makers; while Oxford is still famous for other things than trou
sers, marmalade, and easy chairs. But for the present, though it "assumes
no responsibility" for the blues, Yale appears to be deeply immersed in
them. J lowevcr, now that the disclaimer has l)een made with full ceremony
perhaps the depression will disperse.—Editorial in the Manchester (Eng
land) Guardian.
Final editorial staff meeting will be held at 1:00 o'clock this afternoon.
