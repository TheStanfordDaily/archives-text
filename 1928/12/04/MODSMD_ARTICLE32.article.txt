STRANGE ESKIMO
Intermarriage is race suicide, wails
the sociologist. Meat diet is fatal,
moans the dietician. Never to bathe
is to court death, sobs the physician.
Hut the Eskimo, according to John B.
Macmillan, twenty years a nomad
explorer of the northern icecap, mar
ries his daughter, eats nothing but
meat, never bathes, and lives in the
world's most rigorous clime.
"Communism may be new to the
Russians, but Eskimos have lived a
perfect communal life for genera
tions," said Mr. Macmillan. He was
talking informally at a dinner given
him by the Izaak Walton League in
South Bend, Indiana, last week.
"So intense was their excitement
that when an airplane flew over their
igloos, the Eskimos bled at the nose.
We took with us on our last expedi
tion an airplane, an automobile, an
jplectric light, a radio, a phonograph,
k telephone, and a motion picture pro-'
jector. Of these products of civiliza
tion the one thing that the Eskimos
would trek fifty miles through snows
and blizzards to see was the movie.
"On our last expedition we had pic
tures, which were taken of the Eski
mos on the trip before. Some had

] died. When the pictures of the dead
i appeared the audience became
, hushed, silent in utter amazement.
! j "These people have a definite sense
. of humor. One movie showing in the
. ■ last scene the villain being caught in
- a bear-trap sent them into gales of
• | laughter. Again and again they de
manded to see that picture and each
! | time they re-acted in the same man-
I ner."
; For an hour Mr. Macmillan told in
informal table-talk of these strange
j nomad-like people. They have his
deep sympathy because he knows that
' with the white trader their race is
doomed. His only hope is to warn
j them in advance. If syphilis or tu
i bcrculosis reached them, they would
i be wiped out in one winter. His is a
mission of true service.
Knowledge they have only from
father to son, and it is of the ele
mental kind that preserves them
j against their environment. But intel
! l'gence is their heritage. An old wo
iman said to Macmillan, "Ocean cov-
J ered this land once." To prove her
i point she picked up a fossil shell
j from the hilltop where they were
; standing and showed it to him.

STRANGE ESKIMO
Intermarriage is race suicide, wails
the sociologist. Meat diet is fatal,
moans the dietician. Never to bathe
is to court death, sobs the physician.
Hut the Eskimo, according to John B.
Macmillan, twenty years a nomad
explorer of the northern icecap, mar
ries his daughter, eats nothing but
meat, never bathes, and lives in the
world's most rigorous clime.
"Communism may be new to the
Russians, but Eskimos have lived a
perfect communal life for genera
tions," said Mr. Macmillan. He was
talking informally at a dinner given
him by the Izaak Walton League in
South Bend, Indiana, last week.
"So intense was their excitement
that when an airplane flew over their
igloos, the Eskimos bled at the nose.
We took with us on our last expedi
tion an airplane, an automobile, an
jplectric light, a radio, a phonograph,
k telephone, and a motion picture pro-'
jector. Of these products of civiliza
tion the one thing that the Eskimos
would trek fifty miles through snows
and blizzards to see was the movie.
"On our last expedition we had pic
tures, which were taken of the Eski
mos on the trip before. Some had

] died. When the pictures of the dead
i appeared the audience became
, hushed, silent in utter amazement.
