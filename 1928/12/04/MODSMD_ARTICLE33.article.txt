The Marriage Bed. Columbia Theatre.
The moving picture people are tak
ing their Vitaphone seriously. At
least, it would seem so, for now Alice
Joyce and Owen Moore have tem
porarily deserted Hollywood and are
treading the boards in San Francisco, j
acquiring much "speakie" experience.
Although you may go to Ernest
Pascal's latest dramatic opus, "The
Marriage Bed," with the main pur
pose of seeing how Miss Joyce and
Mr. Moore look without the benefit
ol' camera, when you leave the tliea
tre it is the play and not the actors
that will have impressed you.
The drama is good. Using ultra- ,
modern ideas and treating on a deli
cate subject, Pascal has handled his
material for this tragi-comedy of man
ners with such skill that even the
mediocrity of the cast does not kill it. j
There is dirt here, if you care to look
for that item (as several members of
our American Womanhood did last
Friday night) but the dirt is not ap
parent. In fact, it is so subtly—one
really should say smubtly—introduced i
lhat those of the audience who found '
chances for lascivious giggles tarred
themselves and not the play.

Probably the least said about the ;
acting, the better. The leads are stiff, |
and unconvincing, and help prove the j

j statement that cinematic training
does not facilitate legitimate acting.
Aside from Miss Joyce and Mr. Moore,
the cast is more than fair —although
how much of that is due to compari
son and contrast with the leads is
difficult to say.
The action is slow to the extent of
extreme naturalism. And, although
much of the dramatic suspense of
some of the situations is lost be
cause of this slowness, the play does
not drag. Pascal has used a rather
new situation (for the stage, that is,
| for in actual life it is as old as mar
riage) of a wife, a straying husband,
a mistress, and a younger sister who
j is in the same situation as the mis
tress. Of course, these characters are
familiar to most of the plays of this
type that have ever been written,
but Pascal's newness lies in his
j cleverness of construction, the mod
ern attitude of the wife who will not
agree to a divorce, and the beauti
fully executed scene between the wife
t.nd the mistress.
Never does the action step over the
| border-line of decency—although the
1 title might lead one to suspect other
! wise. Hut it is not a play of the bed
room. It is an expression of the twen-

tieth-century's difficult fight against
the medieval conventions that still
bind this life. —J. R.

The moving picture people are tak

Although you may go to Ernest
Pascal's latest dramatic opus, "The
Marriage Bed," with the main pur
pose of seeing how Miss Joyce and
Mr. Moore look without the benefit
ol' camera, when you leave the tliea
tre it is the play and not the actors
that will have impressed you.
The drama is good. Using ultra- ,
modern ideas and treating on a deli
cate subject, Pascal has handled his
material for this tragi-comedy of man
ners with such skill that even the
mediocrity of the cast does not kill it. j
There is dirt here, if you care to look
for that item (as several members of
our American Womanhood did last
Friday night) but the dirt is not ap
parent. In fact, it is so subtly—one
really should say smubtly—introduced i
lhat those of the audience who found '
chances for lascivious giggles tarred
themselves and not the play.

Probably the least said about the ;
acting, the better. The leads are stiff, |
and unconvincing, and help prove the j

j statement that cinematic training
does not facilitate legitimate acting.
Aside from Miss Joyce and Mr. Moore,
the cast is more than fair —although
how much of that is due to compari
son and contrast with the leads is
difficult to say.
The action is slow to the extent of
extreme naturalism. And, although
much of the dramatic suspense of
some of the situations is lost be
cause of this slowness, the play does
not drag. Pascal has used a rather
new situation (for the stage, that is,
| for in actual life it is as old as mar
riage) of a wife, a straying husband,
a mistress, and a younger sister who
j is in the same situation as the mis
tress. Of course, these characters are
familiar to most of the plays of this
type that have ever been written,
but Pascal's newness lies in his
j cleverness of construction, the mod
ern attitude of the wife who will not
