WHEN WEST IS EAST
For some years past it has been
the custom to hold frequent football
encounters between California's lead
ing elevens and prominent teams
from the East and Middlewest. Most
of them have been post-season battles
such as the Tournament of Roses af
fairs and the outcome has been either
thirty-one victories to fourteen de
feats for the Californians or twenty
nine victories to seventeen defeats
for the Eastern and Middlewestern
teams, depending upon who tells the
tale and what section of the country
he hails from.

The important point, however, is
that the Eastern and Midwest teams
have had to cover a long distance by
rail to get to the football field and in
some cases have had the full benefit
of almost a week's continuous prac
tice in Pullman cars. Most coaches
agree that it's hard to get a line
smash under way from a start in a
lower berth. In addition to the con
finement to narrow quarters and the
rigors of overland travel, there was
(he item of a change in climate. But
it may be a mistake to bring up the
subject of climate. Some Californian
might take the chair and there would
n't be anything more heard about
football all day.
The ordinary custom, then, was for
Eastern teams to follow Horace Gree
ley's advice. This year, however, Stan
ford will reverse the field. Pop War
ner's lads from Palo Alto will try
that stunt of signal practice in Pull
man aisles as they roll across country
to meet the Army at the Yankee Sta
dium in New York on December 1.
After that game it may bo possible
to state with authority whether or not
a transcontinental trip slows up a
backfleld and how much damage can
bo done to a football team by a week's
shaving while going around curves.

It is known that California produces
the most luscious fruit, the most beau
tiful girls, the finest men, the brawn
iest oarsmen, the greatest baseball
players, the fastest runners, the
cream of the tennis crop, the biggest,
trees, the most gorgeous flowers, and

the finest weather in the world (sub
ject to postponement 011 account of
rain). But football is a game of cold
weather, of dark and blustery days,
of chilling frosts and incipient snow
storms. When Californians attempt to
establish a reputation for their state
as a football sector, they are out of
character. They might as well boast
of their icebergs and polar bears and
the depth to which the frost pene
trates in their lemon orchards every
April.
They have good, tall lads out that
way, elegant playing fields, fine
whistlese for the referees. They have
good coaches in Pop Warner (from
the East) and Howard Jones (from
the East). The views from the fifty
yard line are magnificent and soul
stirring in either direction.

But California has no bleak New
England Saturdays, no marrow-chilling
November rains, no freezing winds
running riot between the goalposts.
It isn't a natural football sector.
Flowers, runners, golfers, scenery,
tennis stars, birds, oarsmen, trees —
yes! But football players? No. Those
Coast teams simply lie in wait for the
worn and weary tourists from the
East and push them over before they
realize they are no longer arguing
with the conductor and a couple of
Pullman porters.
Don't debate it, especially with
Californians, all of whom are orators
by instinct and boosters by profes
sion. Just wait until Stanford makes
that trip East to meet the Army. You
can keep mailing the score of that
game to Californians for years to
come. It will annoy them profusely.
If I'm wrong, sue the Army.
