The "contra-vuntal" system . . . .
a new European development in light
ing arrangement, which Harold Hel
venston has employed with marked
success on the Stanford stage, will be
used to light the Basketball Pavilion
for the Sophomore Cotillion Friday
night. These lights were found to be
particularly effective in bringing out
the green and old gold colorings
which will dominate in the # decora
tions.
A novel feature of this year's cotil
ion will be the Egyptian gold brace
lets which will be given as favors
with dancing programs of Oriental
design attached.

A few bids are still available at the
