# CARD WRITES U.C. MAN Spectacles To Be Returned DEMANDS ROOTERS' CAPS
## 
### 
Here is a proposition for the Cal
rooter who in Wednesday's Daily
made public his regret at having been
so careless as to have lost a pair of
glasses while making oft' with a Stan
ford rooter's hat at the Big Game.
Dear Mr. Bramble:
The Stanford Daily informs me
that you are in the mood to trade
a Stanford rooter's cap for a
twenty-dollar pair of glasses. Now
1 have such a pair of glasses
which I picked up in Gerkeley last
Saturday afternoon after having
chased (with homicidal intent) a
fleet-footed, hat-snatching Bear
down one of Berkeley's hills. The
glasses are a bit too strong for
my eyes, and while I admit they
give me a scholarly appearance
that I have never before been able
to achieve, and while they serve
as a satisfactory trophy of the
Big Game, I might be induced to
part with them.
Don't you think, however, that
one rooter's cap is a small price
to pay for such a good pair of
glasses? I am inclined to suggest
that we make it two caps since
you will remember that my little
six-foot companion lost his cap
at the same time that mine went
away. For a while I thought of de
manding as additional ransom one
of the blue "sky pieces" which
the Bears wear, in order that I
might have a trophy of my own.
But after all, the game was a tie,
and the fight (I mean flight) was
a friendly one, so we will forget
about the additional pound of
flesh.
So two rooters' caps mailed to
the address given below will bring
your "eyes."
Yours very truly,
Carl C. Addison.
P.S.: It pays to advertise in the
Stanford Daily!
