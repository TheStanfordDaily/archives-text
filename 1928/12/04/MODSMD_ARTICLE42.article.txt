December 3d—
To an ex this morning, late, for 1
have made a new policy of so going
to all my classes that I may identify
myself with the professor; and do not
think that I did do so well, albeit the
questions seemed to have been all the
things that were not covered in the
lectures or the outside reading. Sup
pose that the professor was anxious
to draw such things to our attention
in some way. So did fill in the pages
of my book with merry persiflage,
and a discussion of various contem
porary problems in which I thought he
might be interested, and so show him
that I was not illiterate as well as

uninformed.

Ito hear much gossip about the bill
for the recent inflammable festivities,
and am appalled by the large debts
for the bonfire party. Of course, the
damage done up to 10 o'clock of the
Tuesday of the first bonfire is quite
rightly freshman responsibility,
I but as for the rest it is not quite fair
! to assume the freshmen are criminally
j negligent. And it does worry me to
think of presenting my budget for this
quarter to my uncle, and explaining
that my freshman dues were for pay
ing for new telephone wires for the
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph
Company, for in his usual way lie is
apt to make puns about "burning up
: the wires." For though I was most
' happy to assist my class by making
sandwiches for them in the small
hours of the night, I scarcely see how
; I am implicated if someone else stole

J a trailer for the bonfire in a mis
guided way.

and was forced to walk in the gutter
most of the way, since the floods of ,
men similarly bound was so large,
and though I do not belong to the
school that holds men should give up
i their seats In street cars to women,
j still I dislike to scuff my new shoes in ;
, this manner. Which also led me to
i ; think long upon the habit of pro
; ; fanity among men, and to wondering
. 'whether I should not wear a little
, ; bell about my neck so that men con
i versing on their way up the street
; might know that a woman, and per
, haps a lady, was behind them.
