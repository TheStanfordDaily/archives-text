# KING RALLIES AS SUBJECTS AWAIT PALACE REPORTS
## Commission Will Take Over Duties of Ruler While Illness Persists 
### 
LONDON, Dec. 3. (,/P)lt was stated
authoritatively at Buckingham Palace
at 10:30 o'clock tonight that the
slight improvement in the condition
of the King indicated in the evening
bulletin still was maintained. Sir
Stanley Hewett was the only physi
cian remaining at the palace and it
was understood that no midnight bul
letin would be issued.
LONDON, Dec. 3. (>P) —Four of the
live doctors who at different times
have been called into consultation on
the illness of King George, tonight
signed a bulletin stating that the con
dition of His Majesty's heart still was
causing anxiety.
Although this was the disquieting
feature of an otherwise favorable re
port, the ever-growing crowds that
gathered outside the palace to await
the evening bulletin, found little in it
to lessen their anxiety.
They obtained some small comfort
from the fact that the physicians
made their report after only a normal
time for examining their patient.
Some of the observers believed that
this indicated there was nothing more
alarming in His Majesty's condition
than in the past two days.
The evening bulletin, signed by
Lord Dawson, of Penn, Sir Stanley
Hewett, Sir E. Farquhar Buzzard, and
Sir Humphrey Rolleston, said:
"A slight improvement in His Maj
esty's condition noted this morning
has been maintained. His temperar
ture is near normal, but it is neces
sary to emphasize that the anxiety
concerning the heart still persists."

LONDON, Dec. 3. (/p) —The Daily
Mail says decision has been reached
to appoint a commission to act for
the King, as was done when His Maj
esty was absent from England after
his illness in March 1925. Discussion
of the commission had been in view
several days, the paper adds, and de
cision was based on the present seri
ous character of the Sovereign's ill
ness.
While the thoughts of the public
and officialdom were mainly at the
Palace, all eyes were turned in the
direction of South Africa and the In
dian Ocean to watch the home speed
ing of the Prince of Wales and the
Duke of Gloucester. Both of the
King's sons were today in position
to get frequent reports by wireless or
telegraph of the progress of their
father's illness.
