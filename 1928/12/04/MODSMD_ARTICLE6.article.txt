That joyful fall-time sport, picking
mythical elevens, is now getting un
der full swing. As a preliminary to
the selection of numerous and contro
versial all-American grid teams, the
arbiters are now warming up on all-
Conference choices.
No list of all-Coast grid stars would
he complete without Pop Warner's
choice. With it are given the Asso
ciated Press selection and that of the
Stanford Daily—take it or leave it.
For comparison with the all-Coast
team. This is composed of the out
standing Stanford men who have
played their last game on a Cardinal
team, either this year or in years
gone by.
