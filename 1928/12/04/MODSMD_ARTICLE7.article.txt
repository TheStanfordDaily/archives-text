# German Diplomat To Give Lecture On Perilous Trip
## Dr. Von Hentig Will Relate Experiences on Mission To Afghanistan 
### 
After making one of the longest
horseback rides in history—across
the entire continent of Asia, through
enemy spies and outposts—stowing
away to Honolulu, and continuing to
Germany by way of the United States,
R. Werner Otto von Hentig, German
Consul-General in San Francisco, ful
filled his diplomatic mission to Af
ghanistan in 1915. Dr. von Hentig
will tell the experiences he had on
this trip in a lecture, "The Closed
Land, Afghanistan, and the Diplomat
ic Mission in 1915," in the Little
Theatre at 7:30 o'clock tonight.
The route which Dr. von Hentig
took to get to Afghanistan was closed
by enemy troops when he had finished
his mission, and in order to get back
he had to take the eastern route
across the salt desert of Persia,
through the Desert of Gobi, taking
about 130 days, over the Hindu-Kush
mountains, where the altitude of
14,000 feet caused serious mountain
sickness. Often he was without food
and water, and he "showed absolutely
incredible physical endurance," ac
cording to Professor W. A. Cooper,
of the German department and a
friend of Dr. von Hentig.
His ability as a long-distance
swimmer (he has two medals for life
saving), proved a great aid when he
entered the harbor of Honolulu and
found that the United States had en
tered the war. Having stowed away
from Shanghai, he jumped out of a
port hole on entering the Hawaiian
harbor, and with his bag swam to
shore. It took Dr. von Hentig two
yf,ars to get back to Germany.
