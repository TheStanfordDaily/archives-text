# FRESHMAN CAGE TEAM MEETS JUNIORS TODAY
## 
### 
Freshman cagers will meet the jun
ior interclass team this afternoon in
the third game of the class basketball
tournament. Despite the fact that the
frosh lost to a fast 1931 five last Tues
day, they are favored to win today.
Both teams went through a light
practice yesterday and are prepared
for the tilt. Under the coaching of
"Rabbit" Bradshaw, the 1932 squad
is making rapid advancement and
should exhibit some flashy play
against the upperclassmen.
In their first game, both the jun
iors and seniors showed weak squads.
Having defeated the yearlings, the
sophomores should have little diffi
culty in winning the class tourna
ment.
