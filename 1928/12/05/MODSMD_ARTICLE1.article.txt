# COOLIDGE'S LAST MESSAGE URGES NAVAL INCREASE
## Right to Criticize Dry Law Upheld Before Congress in Probable Valedictory President Makes Suggestion To Congress for Creation Of Board for Farm Relief 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. (/P) â€” In
what probably will be his valedictory
to Congress, President Coolidge to
day emphasized once more his desire
for an increase in America's naval
strength, urged a farm relief program
which would meet approval of the ad
ministration, made suggestions for
legislation covering the most import
ant subjects, and ended by declaring
the nation was in an era of prosperity
and peace such as never before had
been experienced.
For farm relief, Mr. Coolidge reiter
ated his suggestion for the creation
of a federal farm board in order that
the government might aid in promot
ing orderly marketing and in han
dling surpluses clearly due to weather
and seasonal conditions. He suggested
a revolving fund from government
money, until producers associations
had erected stabilizing organizations
to finance themselves through regular
credit institutions.
Sanctions Cruisers
Following the lines of his Armistice
Day speech, the President's message
repeated his desire for passage of the
tifteen cruiser bill now pending in the
Senate. The President also reiterated
hH opposition to putting the govern
ment into the power or nitrate busi
ness in connection with legislation
affecting the Colorado River or
Muscle Shoals.
The question of prohibition was dis
posed of by Mr. Coolidge in brief
form:
"The country has duly adopted the
eighteenth amendment," he said.
"Those who object to it have the
right to advocate its modification or
repeal. Meanwhile it is binding upon
the national and state governments
and all our inhabitants."
Approves Boulder Dam
The flood control, irrigation and
domestic water purposes of the Boul
der Canyon Dam project are phases
into which the government could ex
tend its functions, he said.
"In the foreign field there is peace,
the good-will that comes from mutual
understanding, and the knowledge
that the problems which a short time
ago appeared so ominous are yielding
to the touch of manifest friendship,"
he said.
The message was concluded with a
plea to the people to remember that
in times of prosperity unremitting toil
is necessary to keep what has been
gained.
