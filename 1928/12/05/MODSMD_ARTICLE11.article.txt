# ARLISS CREATES A DIFFERENT SHYLOCK
## "The Merchant of Venice," at the Geary, Is a Notable Production; Mechanics Perfect 
### TEMPLETON PECK 
"Why it was lovely; it didn't seem
like Shakespeare at all," said a young
woman after she had seen Winthrop
Ames' production of Shakespeare's
comedy, "The Merchant of Venice,"
now at the Geary.
George Arliss told of the incident
in his curtain speech at the opening
of the production in San Francisco
Monday night. Arliss is essaying, for
the first time in his distinguished
career, the role of Shylock, one of the
greatest characters ever portrayed on
the English stage, and it might seem
ns if the young woman's remark sig
nified failure of him and of the other
artists.
But not at all. "The Merchant of
Venice," as Winthrop Ames stages it
and Arliss and his supporting cast
act it, is far from Elizabethan in
rudeness of setting and clumsiness
of presentation. The reason the piny
did not seem "like Shakespeare" to

I the young lady was that the scenes
1 shift like lightning and the sets are
modern in respect of the fact that
their effect is gained through sim
plicity.
Arliss Is Great, But Not All
There are some who will think that
George Arliss is the production, that
on his performance hinges the sue
i cess of the play. We are persuaded,
however, that in the first place the
i author gave the stage a play, which,
iif read with any intelligence what-
I ever, is certain to delight. But add to
j the greatness of "The Merchant of
j Venice" the discriminating interpreta
tion given by Arliss and his cast and
i you may have a conception of the
! excellence of the Geary's offering.
George Arliss is not a great Shy
lock; still he is a definite, sure, dis
tinct, in part original Shylock, whom
j one will long remember. His por
i trayal differs from the favorite in-
terpretation of the past ten years; he
makes no effort to bring the audience
into sympathy with the Jewish
trader. And in refusing to crusade
for tolerance of the tribe of Judah
j lie has put the full Elizabethan raean
i ing into the part.
Portia Is Charming
Miss Frieda Inescort, as Portia, one
!of the most gracious, lovely cliarac
j ters who ever trod the boards, was,
! for us, perfect. Her sprightly elegance,
j her diction, her every look and ges
ture, were prompted by a subtle un
derstanding •of the part. She had a
| charming maid, too, Nerissa, played
! by Eleanor Stuart. And Jessica (Elea
nor Phelps), daughter of Shylock,
whose ducats she abducts to elope
with Lorenzo —well, we intend to
swear out a writ of habeas corpus for
Jessica. Jessica said "love is blind,"
but praise God we weren't.
Noble Antonio was well done by
Leonard Willey, particularly in the
court scene, where Shylock demands
his pound of flesh. Shylock, too, was
incomparable at this climax. His
supreme disdain of Antonio who
helped him to his feet after he had
fallen was a fine, revealing bit of
work.
Great Lines Properly Subordinated
{ Portia read her famous sermon,
I "the quality of mercy is not strained,"
| flawlessly and naturally. Indeed, all
i the celebrated lines, universally ap
pearing in the anthologies, were no
table because they did not intrude
like sore thumbs.
A word for Bassanio —Leslie Barrie
was not as handsome as we should
j have liked him to be, but he suited.
Launcelot Gobbo was somewhat like
!A1 Cass in appearance, and neces-
I sarily so in action. A further side
j light—Balthasar, when he announced
! to Portia, "Madam, I go with all con
| venient speed," wrapped his blue cap
i around him and paced off the stage
j for all the world like Dr. Bailey, our
j own Shakespearian authority. Dr.
I Bailey, by the way, will be especially
| interested in hearing the Elizabethan
j "madrigals and glees" which were
] sung in the gay moments.
| Fail not to see "The Merchant of
! Venice," if you would give yourself
! pleasure in which you are not
! ashamed of yourself for having in
| duiged.
