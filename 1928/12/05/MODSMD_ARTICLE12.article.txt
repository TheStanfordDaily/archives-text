# ASSEMBLY WILL FEATURE SPEECH ON NEW TURKEY
## Mme. Halide Edib, Leader in Near East, To Give Talk At Eleven O'Clock 
### 
As a symbol of the transformation !
of Turkey, where she has taken a j
leading part as journalist, novelist, i
soldier, and cabinet minister, Madame I
Halid6 Edib will talk on "The Face
and Mind of New Turkey" at a Uni
versity assembly this morning at 11 !
o'clock. Madame Edib is the outstand
ing woman of Turkey today, as well
as one of the prominent world lead
ers.
She received the first B.A. degree
granted to a Moslem woman by the !
Ameriban College for Women in Con- j
stantinople, and was the first of her !
sex to go unveiled in the streets. In
the Turkish constitutional revolution 1
of 1908, which removed the strict
censorship of Abul-Hamid, she identi
fied herself with the Young Turk
Movement through her articles in the
Tanine, leading Turkish newspaper.
In the drive against the Greeks dur
ing the late war, Halidd Edib enlisted
and fought under Kemal Pasha
throughout the twenty-three-day bat
tin of Sakaria, for which she has
been called the "Joan of Arc" of Tur
key. When Kemal became the head
of the Turkish nation, he asked her j
to systematize the public school sys
tem, and appointed her the first Min- ,
ister of the Department of Education.
Is Active Politician
"I want to be thought of as a novel
ist," says Madame Edib. "It is my j
work. I am not a politician." However,
it is in the latter role that she has
come to tiie United States. The Insti- j
tute of Politics at Williamstown.
Massachusetts, invited Halid6 Edib
to attend its meeting, the first woman
from abroad to be asked to this con- :
i'crence. She made a striking success
when she addressed this group.
Her "Memoirs," published in 1925,
attracted world-wide attention, so
much so that a second volume, "The
Turkish Ordeal â€”Further Memoirs of
Halid6 Edib," is being published this
year. Her first novel, "Ruined Tem
ples," appeared in 1910; others that
she has written are "Handan" and
"New Turan."
Looks Like Spaniard
In appearance she is very much
like a Spaniard or an Italian, small,
with straight, black bobbed hair, and
black eyes. She dresses in European
style, and though this is her first visit
to the United States, she has spent
a good deal of time in London and
Paris. Madame Edib is a little over
forty years old, and has two sons,
both of whom attended the Univer
sity of Illinois while she was in hid
ing in Angora during the troublous
times of 1920.
