# HENTIG TELLS OF PERILOUS WAR MISSION
## Adventurer Relates Escape From Soldiers While Crossing Desert 
### 
Crossing the worst desert in the
world, where water is ten days apart,
to attempt a vain mission for the Ger
man Foreign Office, and eluding with !
six men and a doctor two columns of
enemy troops in Afghanistan when j
his "fighting force" was a single man
who had to use his thumb for trigger
finger because of a broken hand:
these were some of the experiences i
described by Dr. Werner Otto von
Hentig, German Consul-General in
San Francisco, in his talk in the Lit- j
tie Theatre last night.
Early in the World War, Germany
decided that Afghanistan would af
ford a good opening for expansion, j
and von Hentig was sent across the 1
terrible, glaring salt deserts as minis- '
ter to try and form an alliance with j
the Amir of that country. After much j
hesitation and vacillation, the Amir i
accepted a British offer of two hun- '
dred million rupees, so the German |
had to make his escape across Asia,
through China, and over to America. j
Von Hentig was imprisoned in first ;
one castle and then another, trying ,
to obtain an audience with the Amir.
However, they found no well-organ
ized army as expected; ancient, muz- ;
zle-loading Martini rifles were the ]
cnly arms, and the palace guards
were arrayed in uniforms ranging
from those of King George's Dragoons j
to those of the Scotch Guards.
