# BRAINY SLEUTHS SUPPLY LAUGHS FOR 1931 PLAY
## 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
Who fired the shot while Isabel's
car was being fixed? Who stole the I
| gun when the lights were out? Why is
the Evans' summer cottage in New
\ York haunted?
These are a few of the questions
which will baffle Stanford theatre
; gcers Saturday night when Owen
| FJavis' "Haunted House" is presented
in the Assembly Hall. The play will
mark the culmination of Sophomore
Week, and is the last campus play
j for 1928.
"Clierchez la femme" is the key
j note of the detective tactics employed
by Desmond Duncan, a novelist
i whose creative brain has brought
forth such books as "Blood and
Sword," "The Beautiful Siren," and
! "Her Love." Duncan, the character
played by Tom Henry, seeks to un
ravel the threads of the mystery by
i means of his intellectual superiority.
He gets most amazing results.
In the "Haunted House," Gordon
Davis has a vehicle embodying all the
| elements of a good mystery play from
strange faces behind doors, spiritual
istic scenes, ghosts walking, and
clanging chains to warnings that
i "strange happenings" go on in the
haunted house.
Owen Davis' comedy is not guilty
I of the crime of which most mystery
i plays can be accused, that of taking
| itself too seriously. A breezy spirit
i of humor abounds in the lines, and a
j laugh follows every shudder.
The county constable who plays the
: part of the police force which hasn't
had anything to do for ten years be
-1 fore the night of the play, the rural
I milkman whose daily task involves
lnm in the queerly irregular events
j surrounding the haunted house, and
| Dan Grogan, the New York sleuth,
i supply a good many laughs. These
roles are taken by Burnell Gould, Joe
Thompson, and Henry Lane.
