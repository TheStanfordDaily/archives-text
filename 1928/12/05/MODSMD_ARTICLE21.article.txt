RICHMOND, Va„ December 4. (Jp)
j —Students at the University of Vir
i ginia have been charged with exces
sive drinking and their president,
; Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, has come to
their defense.
Following publication of a letter by
(he Rev. David Hepburn, superintend
ent of the Virginia Anti-Saloon
League, to Governor Byrd, of Vir
j ginia, in which he said that reports
| indicated that, drinking at the school
! amounted to a state-wide scandal, Dr.
| Alderman replied that liquor consump
tion at Virginia was no greater than
! at other similar institutions. He also
declared emphatically that in no
sense was it entitled to be character
ized as a state-wide scandal.
Dr. Hepburn called upon Governor
Byrd to permit federal prohibition
agents an uninterrupted access to the
university grounds, fraternity houses,
and student body as bootleggers are
now reported to have. He explained
i that the purpose of the agents would
| not be to punish drinking professors
or students but to protect them from
| bootleggers.
