# HUNT'S CARDINAL CABERS TRIUMPH IN INITIAL GAME
## Card Veterans Held to 11-10 Score by State College Men In Opening Half of Tilt Sophomores Enter Game to Give Stanford Victory in Third Period of Contest 
### WHITNEY WRIGHT 
Four sophomores and one little red
headed veteran of last year's team
proved a winning combination for
Coacli Husky Hunt last night when
Stanford's varsity cage squad opened
i the 1928 season by snatching a 27 to
; IS victory from the San Jose State
I Teachers College Spartans after a
' see-saw battle of four quarters, dur
-1 ing which the lead changed hands at
least four times.
I Hp to the end of the third period
things looked bad for the Cardinal
quintet, the speedy little forwards of
1 the visitors tinding the basket with
, alarming ease. At this point, however,
with the score 17 to 14 in favor of
the San Jose players, Hunt substi
tuted Hawkins and Mears, forward
and center respectively of last year's
j freshman team, and matters began to
pick up.
i Within a few minutes Hawkins had
scored three baskets, placing the
â–  Cardinals in the lead, Mears and
Reynolds each adding another. A
! field goal by Berg and a free throw
, by Mears had raised the score to 27
j when the final whistle blew.
All in all, the playing of the Stan
ford team was rather slow, the good
headwork of Reynolds and Tampcke,
sophomore guards, being the only
thing that saved the Redshirts from
utter rout during the first half of the
j contest.
Following is the box score of the
