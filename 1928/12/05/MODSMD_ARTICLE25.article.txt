# Poker Leaves Them Homeless

A couple of lads have been denied the privilege of living in the dormi
tories next quarter because they have been guilty of making poker-playing
a business. Both are upperclassmen, one living in the fifth story of
Encina and the other in Toyon. They were alleged to have been trimming
some frosh of their pin money; so the Dean of Men promptly let them
out.
Poker is a game which is deprecated most of all by those who play
it. As a time-waster, it is supreme. Some fellows keep at it if they are
lucky, while others continue with it even if they are unlucky. There is
always a chance.
A year or so ago the Union Board of Governors banned card-playing
from the Old Union Lobby, because the play began to be too incessant
and too feverish. Moreover, crooked poker players always ooze into
congenial groups, and then the harvest begins.
Incessant poker playing is the chief indoor sport of American college
men today, and at the same time the chief obstacle to intellectual progress.
There are a lot of men on this campus who would be likely to graduate
with 180 more grade points than they will have, if they had never culti
vated poker as a habit. We'd trade four years of poker (if we had it to
trade) for 180 grade points any day you name.
