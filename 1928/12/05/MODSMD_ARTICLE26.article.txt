# Why Not Telephone Numbers in the Bawlout
## 
### 
Casting about recently for something constructive to do, we came to
the conclusion that what this University needs is telephone numbers in
the bawlout. The telephone now appears to be a fairly well established
and reliable adjunct to our busy households, and it would seem as if
recognition ought to be taken of the necessity for having the telephone
number of every student listed in the directory.
The proposition was made to Registrar J. P. Mitchell, who granted
that telephone numbers ought to be included in the bawlout if possible,
but asserted it would be pretty difficult to find room in the present-sized
directory. The typographers of the University Press say that the size of
the type could be reduced and the present margin encroached upon suffi
ciently to allow for the inclusion of telephone numbers.
The result of this project, which the Registrar is now considering,
will be awaited with interest by everyone who uses the bawlout. The
chief need for telephone numbers is caused by the fact that many students
live in private homes in Palo Alto. They cannot be traced through the
telephone book. The only way to get their phone numbers now is to ask
them. A complete bawlout would save time and uncertainty in this
regard.
