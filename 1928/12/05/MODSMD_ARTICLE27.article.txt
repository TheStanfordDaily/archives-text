# Northwestern Weeps Crocodile Tears
## 
### 
Northwestern University student leaders (ah! to be a "student
leader") were incensed at an editorial in the Daily Northwestern which
suggested that the University of Chicago withdraw from the Big Ten
because of its poor athletic record during this past season. So the student
leaders formally apologized to dear old University of Chicago. The Asso
ciated Press quotes the apology as follows:
We wish to assure the students of the University of Chicago
that the editorial in the recent issue of the Daily Northwestern,
entitled "The King Is Dead," does not express the student opinion
of our campus. To the contrary, we sincerely wish that success in
the future which has so frequently been yours in the past, and at
the same time congratulate you on your courageous spirit in the
face of an unprecedented series of "tough breaks."
Damning with simulated praise, we calls it. Nothing, we venture to
predict, will assuage the University of Chicago alumni but a victorious
Chicago team. Kind words from opponents do no more good than unkind
words; the hard and fast rule of football is: there is 110 peace—for coach,
team, or college—without victory.
