# Oregon Professors Welcome End of Apple-Polishing
## 
### 
No one at the University of Oregon, least of all the professors,
regrets that the old-time practice of apple-polishing is on the decline
at that institution. It seems strange that such a custom should ever
have become popular; certain it is that not one student in a hundred
has skill sufficient to "p llt it over" on the professor.
