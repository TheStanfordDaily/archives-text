THE STUDENT CREDO
Religious views of American col- j
lege students are practically unknown ;
to outsiders, and little better known j
to .students themselves. That is, each J
has his own ideas of theology, but
has seldom examined the faith of his
fellows.
The average college student goes
to church perhaps live times in a
year. Usually he considers rest, study,
or catching up lost sleep of more im
portance than attending services.
Aside from an infrequent bull ses
sion on the subject, he has ceased to
give any deep thought to religion. He
has found it depressing because it
leads him far afield into problems too
vast for the human mind. "Don't
think about religion" is one of his
self-commandments.
At the age of thirteen or so he
was probably an atheist. He asked
himself such questions as: "If there
is a Heaven and a Hell, exactly where
are they located?" "Granting that
God created heaven and earth, who,
in turn, created God?" Or, "If God is
omnipotent, he should be above petty
motives —why did he not make man
perfect, instead of damning him to
sin and suffering?"
Probably fifty per cent of American
students believe in God, but not the
orthodox God. The atom, infinity,
some pliysio-chemical force not yet
known —these and other vague defini
tions constitute their conception of
the Deity.
The average student neither prays
nor believes in the efficacy of prayer
except as a sedative. Under stress of
some great crisis he may pray silent
ly, as a reversion to childhood train
ing.
He does not believe in the soul or
in life hereafter. Analyzing his deep

sleep, he has concluded that death is
(he same sort of oblivion, plus the
ceasing to function of certain nerves
and muscles not controlled by the
will. The thought of ceasing to be en
tirely is discouraging; therefore he
covers it with some such philosophy
as: you're here only a while —make
the most of it. Or perhaps he believes
tl'at only through procreation is man
immortal.
He has never read the Bible. Not
all of it, anyhow.
He considers organized religions
unnecessary in this age. For the per
secutions of Galileo, of Copernicus,
of Scopes, and hundreds of others
who disseminated truth, he finds it
difficult to forgive organized theology.
The average student has evolved,
or is in the process of evolving, a
personal religion which is actually a
philosophy of life, a system of ethics.
The Golden Rule or some expression
thereof is generally the keynote of
that philosophy. His other tenets may
vary greatly. To orthodox people most
of them would seem sinful and blas
phemous.
It is easy, of course, for the stu
dent to be iconoclastic, atheistic, ag
nostic. He is young, life looks long
and simple. Later, when death is
nearer and discouragement frequent,
he may turn to some "orthodox"
theology as a solace.
But probably he will not. Life is
changing. Religion must do so too. It
is our guess that in many respects
the religious views of the average
student are paralleled by those of the
non-student of the same age. If this
is true, organized religions will dis
integrate, and most of our churches,
a few decades hence, will be replaced
by structures of material purpose.
