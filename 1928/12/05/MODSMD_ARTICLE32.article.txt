The Editor, Sir:
I am a graduate student in this
University.
I did not go to the Big Game.
I did not go to the bonfire rally.
I did not so much as touch one
stick of wood to contribute to the
lire.
However, since as an undergradu
ate I did my share of "making
whoopee," I wish to offer a vigorous
protest to the situation rising out of
the Game.
The full text of the inter-university
pact mentioned on the 21st has not
been published. However, the Men's
Council apparently had the power to
call off the Big Game and should have
done so when the first bonfire was
prematurely burned. The Big "C"
would never have been painted red. j
They did not do this nor did they j
punish McElwain before the game
while efforts were being made to in
crease Stanford spirit by mob psych
ology.
I do not know Lester McElwain,

ENLIST NOW; LESTER McELWAIN NEEDS YOU!

or, as far as I am aware, do I know
any member of the Men's Council.
However, as an impersonal protest
against one man being made the hor
j rible example for an act in which the
! majority of the Student Body seems
! to glory, I will devote one hour of my
j time to work at the Convalescent
j Home on condition that two hundred
I and ninety-eight other students, in
' eluding the Wednesday editor and the
! November 23d editors of this paper,
J will do likewise.
In conclusion, I do not approve of
painting the Big "C" red, if this is
contrary to inter-university agree
ment. On the otber hand, with such
an agreement no guard should be
necessary for either the bonfire or the
Big "C." To use the words of our op
ponent, the actions of both institu
tions are "becoming boys of high
school age." This pact should either
receive the support of both student
bodies or else the rules for the extra
Big Game activities should be revised
to include certain specified strife.

I do not know Lester McElwain,

ENLIST NOW; LESTER McELWAIN NEEDS YOU!

or, as far as I am aware, do I know
any member of the Men's Council.
However, as an impersonal protest
against one man being made the hor
j rible example for an act in which the
! majority of the Student Body seems
! to glory, I will devote one hour of my
j time to work at the Convalescent
j Home on condition that two hundred
I and ninety-eight other students, in
' eluding the Wednesday editor and the
! November 23d editors of this paper,
J will do likewise.
In conclusion, I do not approve of
painting the Big "C" red, if this is
contrary to inter-university agree
ment. On the otber hand, with such
an agreement no guard should be
necessary for either the bonfire or the
Big "C." To use the words of our op
ponent, the actions of both institu
tions are "becoming boys of high
school age." This pact should either
receive the support of both student
bodies or else the rules for the extra
Big Game activities should be revised
to include certain specified strife.
