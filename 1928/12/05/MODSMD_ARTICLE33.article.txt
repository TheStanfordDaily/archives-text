The Editor, Sir: ,
The Daily of November 26 informs j
us that the Men's Council has ar
rived at a decision regarding the pun
ishment of a fellow-student, Lester
McElwain, alleged participator in
painting the Big "C."
Being a broad-minded body, it has
given Mr. McElwain a wide choice,
among which is "an assignment of 300
hours at the Convalescent Home."
The Council is not particular, ap
parently, who helps Mr. McElwain;
so why not, fellow-students, turn out

some afternoon about three hundred
strong, each working off an hour to
Mr. McElwain's credit.
To this writer's way of thinking the
fellows who burned the fire, and
those who were passing rumors that
Cal. fellows did it, etc., are more
guilty than Mr. McElwain; yet the
Council is not making any attempt to
find out who they are and punish them
also.
In other words, Mr. McElwain is
the scapegoat of this year's resump
tion of the "traditional?" bonfire
fiasco. —E. J. Scott.
