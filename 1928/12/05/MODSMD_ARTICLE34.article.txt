Great Short Biographies of the World.
By Barrett H. Clark. (New York:
Robert M. Mcßride & Co. 1928.
$5.)
One of those books that no man's
library is complete without; one of
those books that makes an admirable
Christmas present—that is Great
Short Biographies of the World.
The author of this collection of
short biographies has searched
through thousands of volumes in order
to glean one good-sized volume com
posed of fifty biographies of repre
sentative great men of the ages.
The lives of great men have al
ways attracted famous writers so
that the table of contents of this col
lection reads like a roll of honor of
the illustrious of all ages. Thus,
glancing at the contents the reader
will find, among others, such subjects
as Socrates, Alexander the Great,
Charlemagne, Jeanne D'Arc, Dante
Alighieri, Columbus, Mary Queen of
Scots, Moliere, Newton, Peter the
Great, Walt Whitman, Shelley, and
Napoleon Bonaparte.
As if the subjects were not great

enough, there are such authors as
Plutarch, Boccaccio, Stevenson, Isaak
Walton, Voltaire, Thackeray, Samuel
Johnson, DeQuincey, Romain Holland,
and Emil Ludwig.
What is even more important from
the reader's point of view is that the
author has made final selections with
an eye to their readability. In this
connection, it may be apt to quote
Voltaire who opens his little life of
Moliere with the following words:
"The prediliction of many readers
for the frivolous, and the desire to
make up a volume out of what ought
to fill only a few pages, are the rea
sons why the biographies of cele
brated men are nearly always ruined
by the inclusion of useless details
and popular fairy-tales, as false as
they are insipid."—Clifford P. Weigle.
