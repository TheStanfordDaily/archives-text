# Sam Pepys' Little Niece

### 
December 4th—
Did spend most of the last day In
bed, between mustard plasters, and ;
lord! what with things to sniff, and
sprays, and vile drugs to inhale, not j
to mention ointments with which to
rub, do feel 1 resembled nothing more
than a syphon. Even my dinner did
taste somewhat of vaporub, and the
lunch of vaseline, but suppose 1
should be thankful that my sense of
taste was strong enough to distin
guish the various flavors, and at any
rate I was not reduced to that atro
cious invalid diet of junket and milk
toast.
♦ * *
My good aunt did write complain
ing of the many garments I left
home this vacation to be mended,
and the undergarments to be washed,
for though I did point out to her how
much it saved from my allowance in
bringing them home, thusly, she did
object that my clothes showed wear
even a day laborer's overalls could
not survive. Which I suppose is true,
but these last three weeks the hems
of my skirts seem determined to
come out, and buttons and hooks
have gone out of their way to become
impossible to wear.
* * «
And so back to classes again,
anxious to catch up in my work, for
I fear sometimes that my days as a
Stanford freshman are numbered,
what with my four cuts in archery
(which though I explained that I was
going South for a football game and
had several tea dates I did fear to
bring, the gymnasium instructor is
apt to be rude about), and the unkind
comments of my Bonehead instructor,

I not to mention the difficulty of locat
ing amoebas in a microscope before
! they die, and the vast quantity of
; reading for Citizenship. Besides my
aunt Pepys did remark this last visit
! rather sharply on the advisability of
I a young maid being finished in other
: ways than with the Stanford veneer.
