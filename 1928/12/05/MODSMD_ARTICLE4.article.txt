# FRESHMAN CLASS FOOTBALL TEAM GIVEN NUMERALS
## 
### 
The Executive Committee last night
awarded sixteen numerals to members of
the freshman interclass football team
which won the class grid championship
this season. The question was raised
whether the juniors should be allowed to
replay their game with the sophomores,
giving them another chance at the cham
pionship. In the junior-1931 game the
re force ruled that the touchdown which
decided the game was good, and according
to the rules it may not have been. Sev
eral officials after considering the facts
decided that the game should not be re
played, and that the championship should
go to the freshmen, whom the juniors de
feated.
The freshmen who received numerals
were: Alan Bartlett, Philip R. Bill, Oli
ver J. Carter, Jack Cornell, Edward
Cressler, John B. Deuel, Ralph H. Giber
son, Hal B. Hammons, John M. Hanna,
John VV. Hiitchliffe, Louis D. Janin,
Robert E. Keeble, Burt C. Kendall, Jesse
Mechem, Charles Nims, Kernick Smith.
