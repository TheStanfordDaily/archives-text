# SUMMARY OF THE SECTION ON CULTURAL PROBLEMS
## 
### MAXINE CUSHING 
Behind all of the discussion in the j
five meetings held by the cultural sec
tion was this idea: the time has come
when an exchange of cultures be
tween East and West must be empha
sized instead of stressing work in a
tsingle direction, as exemplified in j
American missionary activity which i
lias always faced East without at- j
tempting to bring back to America j
anything more than a numerical count j
of "heathen" converted. Just as much J
Oriental thought and culture can
benefit the West as Western ideas
can help the East, and it is this
equalization of exchange which must
be sponsored.
One rather interesting prophecy
was voiced in connection with this
opening consideration of missions:
unless missions make more than a
one-way contribution to an exchange
of cultures they are in danger of
being supplanted by more purely edu
cational and more equally active
agencies.
America's Contributions
An analysis of America's contribu
tions to civilization revealed fourteen
points, the most important of which
were the scientific attitude, the con
quering of nature in behalf of hu
manity, ideals of progress, initiative,
mutual trust and co-operation, a code
of business honor, and worth of the
individual, as expressed in our demo
cratic and Christian ideals and as op
posed to the low valuation put on
human life by the average Oriental.
Most of these, of course, are held in
common by other Western nations.
A similar review of Eastern cul
ture centered around three main
characteristics: a seemingly inherent
love of beauty, respect for authority
—evident in both government (Japa
nese adoration of the Emperor) and
in the family (respect for elders, in
tense loyalty to the family)—and
finally the Oriental emphasis on medi
tation and thought as an essential
part of living.
Granting that both Eastern and
Western culture can profit by an ex
change—and the group agreed that
they can —the mai nproblem concerns
the means of effecting this exchange.
In both directions the key, of course,
is increased contacts.
Western Ideals in Orient
Certain elements of American civili- j
zation are already established in the ,
East, notably our ideals of efficiency |
and co-operation. This has been the,
work of American business, to date j
our most widespread and effective j
agent; but unfortunately, American j
business men are not necessarily the
most adequate ambassadors for other
and more idealistic phases of Western
culture. They, then, must be seconded
by other kinds of contacts. Our next
most powerful agent is the moving
picture, which more often than not
distorts American ideals beyond the
point of recognition. Since projection '
of our ideals abroad seems to have
been but partially effective we must
turn to those representatives of the
East who have come to us —notably
exchange students from China, Japan,
India, and the Philippines. If these
thinking and receptive individuals
trom across the Pacific can be as
sisted in gaining a true impression of
American civilization (and they are |
eager for an unbiased, fair impres- j
sion), then we will have materially
aided this exchange of cultures.
Contact of Americans
These same foreign students are a
factor in the opposite exchange, that
from East to West, for they are the
only genuine contact which many j
Americans have with the Orient. It;
follows that where opportunity for |
knowing Japanese and Chinese and !
other Orientals is theirs for the ask-1
ing, Americans owe it to themselves j
to make such acquaintances. Other 1
means of making Eastern culture
more accessible for the West, as dis
cussed by the group, are these: spon

soring the learning of Oriental lan
guages—an open door to the culture
of the particular country —and the
translation of Oriental literatures. (If
the original Chinese characters are
! appended they really ought to be in
I proper order instead of upside down
as were those in the last Stanford
"Lit.") Decidedly important, too, is
the inclusion of accurate, adequate,
and up-to-date information on the
Orient in grammar, high school, and
j college curricula.
Ideal Results Prophesied
The members of the section were
j interested in prophesying the ideal
{results of a far-reaching exchange of
i Eastern and Western cultures. The
i East would be offered two rather dis
| tinctly different Americanisms: an
accelerated and efficient type of ma
terialism, typified by the immense
business network that is reaching all
over the world; and the democratic
and Christian ideal of individual
worth. America would be given an
insight into the real meaning of
Oriental philosophy and perhaps
would find that its meditative empha
sis would enrich the leisure time
which will be ours as a result of in
creasing mechanical efficiency. They
felt that this Eastern attitude of mind
could be especially valuable to stu
dents: a revaluation of time might
save them from the harmful results
of an increasingly complex student
life.
In both these exchanges, however,
the group decried any attempt to
force one set of ideals on the people
of the other group. Both cultures
should be offered to East or West for
voluntary adoption and adaptation;
the inevitable result of this exchange
is mutual understanding.
