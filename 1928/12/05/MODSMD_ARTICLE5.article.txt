The purpose of the International Stu- j
dent Service, an organization of students |
throughout the world,' is to give aid to '
fellow students where it is most needed, j
The fund which is being raised in the
United States this year will be used for;
the upkeep of work already started, such
as sanitariums, employment bureaus, and |
restaurants.
Students in Russia, Germany, Austria, j
Hungary, and France have received a j
great deal of help from the organization, j
A student restaurant was established in j
Paris in 1926 where three-course meals |
were served for the price of 16 cents. |
The student employment bureaus have!
aided greatly also, for they supply part
time work, and make it possible for many
to attend university who could not other
wise go.
During the last year, fifty-seven stu
dents have received stipends from I.S.S.
ranging from $4 to $12 a month.
