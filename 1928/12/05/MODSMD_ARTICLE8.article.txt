# NEW GYMNASIUM TO FEATURE TWO SWIMMING POOLS
## 
### 
As a special feature, the architectural
plans for the proposed new women's gym
include two swimming pools enclosed by
arches and plate glass, it was revealed
by Helen Masters Bunting, head of the
women's physical education department,
who met with Comptroller Roth and the
University architects, Bakewell and
Brown, last Friday.
This style of enclosure follows that of
the swimming pool at Lake Louise. The
plate glass affords protection and allows
the sunlight to penetrate.
The two swimming pools will be at the
southwest end of the gymnasium, and
will be seventy-five feet apart, the arcade
enclosing both of them. One pool \vill
be used for instruction and the other for
recreation. Following the architecture of
the University, the gymnasium will be of
plaster and have a red-tiled roof.
