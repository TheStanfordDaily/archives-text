BERKELEY, Dec. 4. (/P)â€” An edi
torial protesting the punishment
measured out to Lester McElwain
Stanford University student, whose
wallet was found near the Big "C" of
the University of California after it
had been painted red, appeared today
in the Daily Californian, student pub
lication.
The editorial pointed out that the
painting of the C in Stanford's color
was done in a spirit of friendly rival
ry before the Big Game between the
two institutions, and decried the pun
ishment to be given McElwain as too
severe.
