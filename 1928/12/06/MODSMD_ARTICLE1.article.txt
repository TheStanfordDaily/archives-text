# STANFORD PLANS WELCOME RALLY FOR CARD TEAM
## Victorious Football Squad's Campus Arrival Scheduled For Tomorrow Noon Hour San Francisco Prepares For Gigantic Reception, Parade Up Market With Bands 
### 
Stanford will hold its own rally
to welcome its victorious football
warriors at 12:05 o'clock tomor
row when the players will be
given a student ovation at the
Memorial Arch. A telegram has
been received from the team that
it will continue down to the Uni
versity in a body after the wel
come in San Francisco.
it was thought that students
would prefer to greet the team on
â€¢the campus because it would give
them a better opportunity to ex
tend their welcome. It would be
impossible for many students to
arrive in San Francisco in time
for the rally. Students are urged
to watch the Daily for any change
in time or plans.
All San Francisco is making plans j
to give the Stanford varsity a gigan- j
tic "Victory and Welcome" rally when j
it arrives home tomorrow from New j
York, where it amazed the East and j
Avon the plaudits of the West by j
trouncing the brilliant Army eleven !
after a 3000-mile train ride.
The team has given enthusiastic
approval of the plans, according to i
telegrams received by city papers, !
;uid is looking forward to the event. 1
Pop Warner is in New Orleans, so !
Captain Biff Hoffman and Alfred R. j
Masters, general manager of the |
Board of Athletic Control, gave the
approval of the squad.
Present reports say the Cardinals
will arrive at the Ferry Building be
tween S:3O and 8:45 o'clock. But San
Francisco is so enthusiastic to pay
homage to the Stanford football
heroes that it will send a fireboat
across the bay to accompany the
Cards, who will arrive on a specially
decorated Southern Pacific ferry. A
water spectacle has been promised
the crowd expected at the Ferry
Building.
Then will begin the triumphant
march down Market Street, and Mar
ket Street merchants have even made
Santa Claus take a back place while
they adorn their windows with the
colors of Stanford. The Municipal
hand, the Police band, and possibly
the Shrine musicians will join to add
music and pep to the great parade to
the City Hall, where Major James
Kolph, Jr., and other city and county
officials will lead the welcoming cere
monies.
