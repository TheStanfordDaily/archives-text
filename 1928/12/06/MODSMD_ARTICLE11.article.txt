will be featured by Warren D. Allen,
University organist, at 4:15 o'clock this

follows:
Three Chorale Preludes on "In dulci
jubilo" Bach
a) Maestro in A. for full organ
b) Trio in G Major (as a cradle song)
c) Canon in A Major (from The Lit
tle Organ Book)

Sigfrid Karg-Elert
Noel sur les flutes Claude Dequin
Fantasia on Old English Carols

The Resonet in laudibus is from "Ca
thedral Windows" and the theme is that
of an ancient Christmas melody. An un
usual effect is obtained by the continu
ous sound of F sharpâ€”B on high,
ethereal tones throughout the piece.
