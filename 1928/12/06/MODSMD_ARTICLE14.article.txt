# TURKISH LEADER DEPLORES EXISTENCE OF NATIONALISM
## 
### 
i DOLITICAL NATIONALISM is one of the worst tilings that has happened
to the world," said Madame Halid6 Edib, the outstanding woman of
| Turkey and one of its prominent leaders, in a lecture yesterday at an assem
| hly on "The Face and Mind of New Turkey." "I do not know of anything
[ which has led to more strife and tragedy than it has."
j Madame Edib outlined briefly the history of the Ottoman Empire, telling
| the beliefs and customs of the "primitive Turk," the changes that he under
j went at the time of the founding of the Ottoman dynasty, and finally the

declared Halid6 Edib. The fear of |
Russia and of capitulations influenced '
the decision of the Turks at this j
crisis. In 1918 after the armistice |
"we wqre giving up two-thirds of the |
empire. We thought we would be left j
alone in the predominantly Turkish j
places. Then came the ghost of ag
gression.
"Both the Greeks and Turks realize
that there is going to be a Near East
just as there is a Europe, and that
they must settle their questions
among themselves," continued Mad
ame Edib. "Whatever government
comes to rule in Turkey it is bound
to be progressive, supported by the
army. The conservatives have lost i
their power."
In speaking of the result of the late
v/ar, she said: "The Great War has
inaugurated a human era; we are no
longer in what we have called the i
modern age." From the world point
of view, Madame Edib turned to con- j
sider America: "Russia and Ameri-{
ca are of immense importance. Rus
sia is the dominating force of the
East. The importance of America is
that she is the new West."

' transformation which has come about<s>
j in,the last century, making the "New
! Turkey."
In 1839 there arose an intelligentsia
1 I which was interested in politics, in j
1 j the improvement of the vernacular
1 | language and prose, and in European
I ideas.
In 187G the first parliament, under
a constitution which had just been
' completed, opened, but was closed by
1 the sultan, and all European ideas
which had been propogated were sup
' pressed. In 1908 a revolution took
' place, and as a result the Sultan was
' forced to carry out the Constitution
' of 1876.
This new movement led by the ;
| Young Turks was at this time demo
cratic. The Christians in Turkey took
j the nationalistic side, which started
| a series of tragic events, causing in-
I 1 tense racial hatred. As a result of ;
; this hatred the people, including the
l Young Turk party, became nationalis- ,
: tic in feeling. Then came the World

the war on the wrong side because 1 !
