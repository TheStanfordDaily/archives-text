# NOVEL BRACELETS ARE FAVORS FOR SOPH COTILLION
## 
### 
i Gold bracelets, inscribed with Egyp-j
tian symbols, and bearing small Stan
ford emblems attached to the orna- j
nient by means of gold chains, form
i the unique favors for the Sophomore
■Cotillion Friday night. The favors, to- I
j gether with the programs of Egyptian
design, are now ready for distribu
tion at the office of the Old Union
<and may be obtained, upon presenta
tion of a Cotillion bid, between the
hours of 9-12 and 1-5, both today and j
; tomorrow. There are still a limited
number of bids left and will be on
| sale from now until 5 o'clock Friday J
j afternoon.
The Pavilion is rapidly taking on i
the semblance of an Egyptian temple.
! A huge canopy bordered with Sphinx
| heads forms the ceiling. Pillars, idols,
I and other ornaments, in green and j
| old gold shades, border the walls. The j
j entrance to the floor is marked by j
two statues suggestive of the Valley
Nile.
The entire effect will be enhanced
by the "contra-vuntal" system of!
lighting arrangement, a new Euro- j
pean development, that Harold Hel- !
venston has employed with success I
on the Stanford stage, and which was
largely responsible for the striking
I effect of the Machine Ballet in the j
j recent Football Gaieties.
Leo Gerckins and his orchestra,
i whose reputation insures the best of |
j music for the dance, will occupy the |
least end of the hall, a distinct de- ]
j parture from the usual position of
■ the band in Pavilion dances.
