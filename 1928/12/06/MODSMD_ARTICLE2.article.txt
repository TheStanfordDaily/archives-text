# Polo Squads Discontinue Practice Until Next Year
## 
### 
Polo practice for both varsity and
"B" squads will not be held today nor
any time for the rest of the fall quarter,
announces Captain Richard A. Gordan,
coach.
The student committee decided at a
meeting yesterday that because of the
need to study for approaching final ex
aminations, it would be best to discon
tinue practice until next year. This va
cation will also give the horses a much
needed rest.
