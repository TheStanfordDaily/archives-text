# BOULDER CANYON DAM IS SUBJECT OF LONG DEBATE
## Hoover's Attitude on Water Distribution Gives Rise to Speculation of Senators Controversy Centers Around California-Arizona Dispute Over Irrigation Allotment 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 (£>). — The
Senate resumed deliberation on the Boul
der Canyon Dam bill today in an at
mosphere that promised long-drawn-out
sessions before any action is taken.
Called to the floor as the unfinished
business of last session by Senator John
i son of California, one of the authors of
the Swing-Johnson bill for the construc
tion of the huge irrigation, flood con
trol, and power project, the measure's
supporters and opponents lost little time
in airing their differences over one of
the chief controverted points—how the
; water from the Colorado river would be
| allocated.
Hoover Mentioned
The name of President-Elect Hoover
figured in the debate when several Sena
tors speculated as to his attitude regard
ing water distribution.
Although Senator Hayden, Democrat
from Arizona, held the Hoor throughout
the two and one-half hours of discussion,
Senator Johnson came in for a good
share of the talk by virtue of questions
j fired at him by the Arizonian. During
I one of their verbal duels, Senator John
son announced he had received a com
munication from the builder of the huge
Coolidge dam in which the engineer of
fered to construct Bouider dam for a less
amount than that contemplated in the
i pending legislation.
California vs. Arizona
Much of the debate centered around
! the old controversy between California
i and Arizona over the distribution of
water for irrigation purposes and it was
jat this point that' Senator Hayden
brought in the name of Mr. Hoover. The
Arizona senator declared the president
elect in a speech at Los Angeles during
the campaign said that California should
meet every reasonable demand of the
other states in the Colorado river basin
and that the question of water distribu
tion should be solved by fairness and
justice.
About 8,500,000 acre feet of water has
been allotted to California, Nevada and
Arizona, of which 300,000 would go to
j Nevada. California has set its "irredu
cible minimum" at 4,600,000 acre feet,
which is more than Arizona is willing
to concede.
