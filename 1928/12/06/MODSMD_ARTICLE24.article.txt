Fair California's Big C might just as well be periodically rouged at
the hands of Stanford roughs, thinks the Daily Californian, That journal
serenely attacks the Stanford Men's Council for attempting to uphold
the Stanford-California greement against invasion of the one's campus
by students of the other. It asserts the punishment meted out to Lester
McElwain, the indiscreet loser of wallets, is "absurd." Its editorial of
Tuesday morning follows:
PUNISHMENT ADMINISTERED STANFORD
STUDENT IS UNNECESSARILY HARSH
The punishment which Stanford's Men's Council has meted out
to the one unfortunate Stanford student convicted of participation
jin the painting of the Big "C" before the Big Game is absurd.
; , There is no ground for believing that student opinion, frankly in
. favor of such expressions of friendly rivalry, is going to support
the decision handed down by the Stanford student judges. They, of
course, were put in a difficult position when the discovery of a poc
ketbook belonging to the raider definitely proved his guilt. It was
up to them to uphold the agreement between California and Stan
ford which expects punishment of convicted "vandals," but the three
punishments of which he was given the choice are unjustifiably
harsh.
It would be far better to abrogate all agreements, written or
unwritten, if they forced the imposition of so severe a penalty for
so trivial an offense.
The situation would be different, and would justify extreme
measures, if the so-called "acts of vandalism" were committed in a
bitter and unworthy spirit, and amounted to unnecessary destruction
of property. Our "gentlemen's agreement" should apply only in
such cases.
It is quite sporting of the Daily Calif ornian to offer to abrogate the
inter-university agreement. Moreover, we wonder if it would be possible
for the Daily Calif ornian to arrange for the blowing up of the vault
wherein the Stanford axe is contained, so that we may have a fair chance
at that ancient weapon.
As far as the Daily Californian s argument goes, there is prevalent
feeling here that McElwain was a scapegoat of the Big C painting prank;
indeed, the Men's Council itself thought that, but it thought also that a
decent respect for California demanded some sort of simulated indig
nance.
A number of writers in Campus Opinion have suggested that 300
men gather in a sort of sympathy labor gang and spend an hour working
at the Convalescent Home in order to work off McElwain's sentence.
This is generous, and it appeals to our imagination, but obviously it is
making a farce of something which we think ought to be taken seriously.
As -a matter of fact, painting Big C's is a harmless occupation, as
long as it is done unostentatiously, without a strewing around of wallets
(dammit, McElwain, why did you ever take your wallet with you?), but
when the papers play up the affair in prominent positions, and the Daily
Calif ornian invites repetition of the prank at any convenient time, the
prankers to go unscathed by special dispensation of the Daily Calif ornian
and a hurried abrogation of the Stanford-California agreement, it is
wisdom to come down fairly hard on the practice. The next time the
Campanile, or even the office of the Daily Calif ornian might suffer.

harsh.
It would be far better to abrogate all agreements, written or
unwritten, if they forced the imposition of so severe a penalty for
so trivial an offense.
The situation would be different, and would justify extreme
measures, if the so-called "acts of vandalism" were committed in a
bitter and unworthy spirit, and amounted to unnecessary destruction
of property. Our "gentlemen's agreement" should apply only in
such cases.
It is quite sporting of the Daily Calif ornian to offer to abrogate the
inter-university agreement. Moreover, we wonder if it would be possible
for the Daily Calif ornian to arrange for the blowing up of the vault
wherein the Stanford axe is contained, so that we may have a fair chance
at that ancient weapon.
As far as the Daily Californian s argument goes, there is prevalent
feeling here that McElwain was a scapegoat of the Big C painting prank;
indeed, the Men's Council itself thought that, but it thought also that a
decent respect for California demanded some sort of simulated indig
nance.
A number of writers in Campus Opinion have suggested that 300
men gather in a sort of sympathy labor gang and spend an hour working
at the Convalescent Home in order to work off McElwain's sentence.
This is generous, and it appeals to our imagination, but obviously it is
making a farce of something which we think ought to be taken seriously.
As -a matter of fact, painting Big C's is a harmless occupation, as
long as it is done unostentatiously, without a strewing around of wallets
(dammit, McElwain, why did you ever take your wallet with you?), but
when the papers play up the affair in prominent positions, and the Daily
Calif ornian invites repetition of the prank at any convenient time, the
prankers to go unscathed by special dispensation of the Daily Calif ornian
and a hurried abrogation of the Stanford-California agreement, it is
wisdom to come down fairly hard on the practice. The next time the
Campanile, or even the office of the Daily Calif ornian might suffer.
Fair California's Big C might just as well be periodically rouged at
the hands of Stanford roughs, thinks the Daily Californian, That journal
serenely attacks the Stanford Men's Council for attempting to uphold
the Stanford-California greement against invasion of the one's campus
by students of the other. It asserts the punishment meted out to Lester
McElwain, the indiscreet loser of wallets, is "absurd." Its editorial of
Tuesday morning follows:
PUNISHMENT ADMINISTERED STANFORD
STUDENT IS UNNECESSARILY HARSH
The punishment which Stanford's Men's Council has meted out
to the one unfortunate Stanford student convicted of participation
jin the painting of the Big "C" before the Big Game is absurd.

the decision handed down by the Stanford student judges. They, of
course, were put in a difficult position when the discovery of a poc
ketbook belonging to the raider definitely proved his guilt. It was
