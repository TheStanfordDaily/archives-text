# Funds Sought in a Teacup
## 
### 
Directly after the War, there was organized in European and Ameri
can colleges a fund which would help those students who had been im
poverished to attain a University education. This became known as the
International Student Service, to which colleges still send in yearly con
tributions.
At the present time conditions have so improved on the Continent
that only a small part of the sum goes towards the direct maintenance of
individual students at universities. The functions of the I.S.S. have
today so broadened that in Paris it has been able to establish student
restaurants, a lodging and employment bureau, and medical services for
nominal sums. Similar work is being undertaken in other countries.
Too much can not be said in regard to the internationalizing work that
it is doing.
On Saturday there will be a tea in the Women's Clubhouse for the
purpose of raising the Stanford quota for the I.S.S. This is a good
movement worthy of hearty support.
