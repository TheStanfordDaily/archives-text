# Why Do Students Drink?

(Exccrpt from an editorial by G. //. M. in What the Colleges Are Doing
published by Ginn and Company)
The charge that youth is drinking its way into notoriety just
because there is a laic against drinking is as absurd as to suppose
that these same young people arc breaking the speed law on the
highways just because there is a law against speeding. They are
consuming many more cigarettes than they are cocktails or high-

balls, and -there is no restraint against the former at all comparable
to the highly desirable restraint against the latter. It is not a ques
tion of good or of bad form (remember that the inhibitions of the
very young are of the post-war type). It is not personal liberty,
or individual rights, or social rebellion that creates the so-called
drink issue in the college or out. It is the supposed thrill of it, the
childish bravado of it, coupled with the strange fact that for the
moment and in certain small circles of would-be Sophisticates it is
the Code.
G. IT. M., like other supporters of Amendment XVIII, forgets that
potation is a pleasure to be sought for its own sake, even through dark
alleys and barred doors. Critics of this generation to the contrary, stu
dents who drink are primarily hedonists, not faddists. If people will
persist in insinuating that we do break the Volstead Law, we wish they
would award us credit for having as our motive pleasure, and not simply
"childish bravado."
