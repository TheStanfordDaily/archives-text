WHEN '95 BATTLED '96
The imperturbable sphinxes blink
not an eye and continue their age
long vigil at the vault of the Univer
sity's founders. Undergraduates, dead
in earnest, hide nearby. A rustling in
the arboretum. The undergraduates
become tense. Freshmen, their ene
mies, a handful of them creep through
the trees and near the Mausoleum.
Commanche-like the hiding sopho
mores leap on them, no doubt whoop
ing the war cry, "To hell with *96."
Securely tied, the assaulted fresh
men are carried to a nearby wagon
and dumped in. The captors climb
aboard and whip up the horses. Down
Palm Drive they gallop. They are in
enemy territory and are making a
dash for their own lines. The wagon
bounces, careens from side to side,
shaking up the hog-tied captives like
proverbial peas in the pod. The gate
is ahead. In no time the sophomores
will reach camp and boastfully march
in their captives. Suddenly the driver
hauls back on the reins, the horses
rear back, the wagon is stopped with
tremendous effort. The gate has been
closed. From all sides wild freshmen
board the wagon, free their class
mates, and bind the fleeing invaders.
The wagon continues on its riotous
loute commandeered by new drivers.

- A secluded road is reached in Menlo
Park. The freshmen lug their hound
up enemies to the roadside. With
more rope they tie the unfortunates
to fences, in spread-eagle fashion, and
assured that they can not get loose,
the victorious crew departs. Hours
later one of the victims wriggles loose
j and the lot of them trudge campus
: ward.
In this escapade were Hinsdale,
Hoover, and Hicks, names to conjure
> with in the heated political battle of
two years later. Hinsdale ran for stu
; dent body president, Hoover for treas
urer, and Hicks for football manager.
They won their campaign.
In a toast at the Chicago alumni
Big Game banquet last fortnight, Her-
I bert S. Hicks, one-time football man
-1 ager of the A.S.S.U., and now state
senator for Illinois, told this incident.
In introducing Senator Hicks, the
toastmaster accused him of conniving
with Hoover in campus politics, say
ing, "Rumor had it that Hoover draft
ed all the oriental laborers on the
campus and made them vote." Sena
i tor Hicks defended himself and Hoo
ver by replying that Hoover had
marched to the Quad followed by a
delegation of orientals who were not
laborers, but students.
