"Understanding Spain," by Clayton
Sedgewick Cooper. (Frederick A.
Stokes Company, r-Jew York.)
Before one has finished five pages
of Cooper's book on Spain, one is
struck by its extreme readability. The
title of the book, of course, gives it
away as falling under the category of
educational or informative books, that
must be picked up warily, in anticipa
tion that the author intends to over
whelm the reader with laborious sta
tistics, quotations, and facts.
But I assure you that it would be
a mistake to pass up "Understanding
Spain" because of any such fears.
It is told in a vivid, entertaining
style, with just the right amount of
anecdotes, and interesting experi
ences of the author to give that inti
mate personal touch to the accounts,
that adds so much to a book of this
type.
It frequently happens that such a
book achieves interest only at the
sacrifice of authenticity, yet Cooper

has combined both qualities to a rare
degree. The average reader is perliapß
more concerned that a book be inter
esting than authentic. However the
sincere student of modern history
will keenly appreciate Cooper's expo
sition of the Spanish heritage, traits,
and customs, which his first hand ex
perience makes accurate and depend
able.
Mr. Cooper has supplemented his
own careful observations with the
views and information given him by
many of Spain's own outstanding
scholars, with whom he is closely ac
quainted.
The book is built around the people
of Spain themselves, so that the dif
ferences between the Spain of today
and the Spain of yesterday are shown
in terms of its men and women, and
especially of its youth. This manner
of approach affords the reader a clear
and concrete grasp of Spain's chief
problems, her requirements, and her
present tendencies. —M. L. R.
