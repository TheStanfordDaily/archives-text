The Cardinals' triumph over the
West Point Cadets adds the most
brilliant page to local football his
tory. It was a great game and a benefit
to Stanford. It put the name of Stan
ford on the front page of a thousand
newspapers and on the lips of hun
dreds of thousands of people; it put
the name in a position of permanent
prominence. But overlooking such ad
vantages, it will be remembered as
the initiation of football relations be
tween the Cardinals and the United
States Military Academy, a pact
which we hope will not be broken
at the end of the present two-year
agreement. Stanford would have to
search for some time to find a rival
who can equal Army for sportsman
ship.

The West Pointers are in the
habit of winning football con
tests. They are ardent supporters
of the Black-Gold-and-Grey in de
feat or victory, but win or lose,
they accept their lots as true sol
diers.

An excellent example of the spirit
of sportsmanship which exists at the
Point is contained in an editorial pub
lished recently (before the Stanford
game) in the Academy's official maga
zine, The Pointer. The article refers
to Notre Dame's unexpected victory
over the Cadets. The 12-6 defeat was
a severe blow to the Soldiers; it
marred what was a perfect record
for Army; in addition, it was a defeat

that might have been averted if the
game had lasted ten more seconds.
Army was on the Irish one-yard line
and was calling signals on the final
drive when the timekeeper fired the
gun.

The editorial reads: "We are
not munching 'sour grapes,' nor
are we wailing and shouting and
gnashing our teeth in some vain
and futile attempt to comfort our
selves for a fresh memory of
Notre Dame 12, Army 6. Sincere
ly we ask our readers to believe
that we pass our own laurels to a
fast, fighting, foe-worthy team
from South Bend, and give credit
honestly. For our opponent we
have only that cry of friendly ri
valry, 'just wait till next year!'
It was a great game, and a great
team who beat us; we would not,
if we could, detract one iota from
their glory."
—Carroll O'Meara.
