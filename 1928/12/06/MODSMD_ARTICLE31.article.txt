December 5th —
Most of this morning in doing fig
ures of my potential grades, and can
not decide, what with this intricate
system of minuses and plusses, hour
counts and honor points, whether my
record at the end of the quarter will
| be minus sixteen, or nine plus two, or
J four minus four, but whatever it is,
'twill be very bad I fear. So upon
I the advice of my sponsor did write
my uncle and aunt how sadly my eyes
were tired, and of the grievous cavity
in my tooth. And to the Dean of Wo
men's office and to the women's doc
tor, explaining the huge and tremen
dous size of my cavity, and of the ill
effects upon my general health, to
; which they did listen most sympa
| thetically, albeit commenting a little
! upon the natural tendency of the
j tongue to exaggerate.
But they agreed that perhaps the
best thing for me was to petition for
a leave of absence for the rest of the
quarter, and since I have filled and
filed the various papers, I feel it is
very wise for I am now feeling most
badly. To packing my bags and paying
laundry bills the rest of this after
noon, and to returning to their own-
I ers the various parts of my wardrobe,
till the corridors of Roble semed as
long and as blank as a prison.
I have enjoyed my short visit on
the Stanford campus greatly, and it
makes me most melancholy to think
I shall not be here for the Military
Ball and for spring quarter, which I
am told by all the upperclass women
is a most romantic and dramatic sea-
Bon. In many ways this University
seems to me a most delightful but pe
culiar place, inasmuch as there al
ways seem to be conflicts, or feuds,
or political excitements somewhere
upon it. But there are a number of
reforms that I think would add great
ly to the attractiveness of the cam
pus, and this puts me in mind to
spend tomorrow night in writing to
the President, as I probably shall not
be back for some time, and do hate
to bother such a busy man with a con
ference on minor details.

makes me most melancholy to think
I shall not be here for the Military
Ball and for spring quarter, which I
am told by all the upperclass women
is a most romantic and dramatic sea-
Bon. In many ways this University
seems to me a most delightful but pe
culiar place, inasmuch as there al
ways seem to be conflicts, or feuds,
or political excitements somewhere
upon it. But there are a number of
reforms that I think would add great

pus, and this puts me in mind to
spend tomorrow night in writing to
the President, as I probably shall not
be back for some time, and do hate
to bother such a busy man with a con
ference on minor details.

December 5th —
Most of this morning in doing fig
ures of my potential grades, and can
not decide, what with this intricate
system of minuses and plusses, hour
counts and honor points, whether my
record at the end of the quarter will
| be minus sixteen, or nine plus two, or
J four minus four, but whatever it is,
'twill be very bad I fear. So upon
I the advice of my sponsor did write
my uncle and aunt how sadly my eyes
were tired, and of the grievous cavity
in my tooth. And to the Dean of Wo
men's office and to the women's doc
tor, explaining the huge and tremen
dous size of my cavity, and of the ill
effects upon my general health, to
; which they did listen most sympa
| thetically, albeit commenting a little
! upon the natural tendency of the
j tongue to exaggerate.
But they agreed that perhaps the
best thing for me was to petition for
a leave of absence for the rest of the
quarter, and since I have filled and
filed the various papers, I feel it is
very wise for I am now feeling most
badly. To packing my bags and paying
laundry bills the rest of this after
noon, and to returning to their own-
I ers the various parts of my wardrobe,
till the corridors of Roble semed as
long and as blank as a prison.
I have enjoyed my short visit on
the Stanford campus greatly, and it
makes me most melancholy to think
I shall not be here for the Military
Ball and for spring quarter, which I
am told by all the upperclass women
is a most romantic and dramatic sea-
Bon. In many ways this University
seems to me a most delightful but pe
culiar place, inasmuch as there al
ways seem to be conflicts, or feuds,
or political excitements somewhere
upon it. But there are a number of

pus, and this puts me in mind to
