# DIFFICULTIES OF SECOND GENERATION ORIENTALS DISCUSSED AT INSTITUTE
## 
### 
SUMMARY OF THE SECTION ON
INTER-RACIAL PROBLEMS
(Editor's Note: This is the second of a
series of articles on the Student Institute of
Pacific Relations.)
Discussing particularly the difficult
position of second-generation Japa
nese —a group of Americans who are
subjected to the same discrimination
as Oriental-born immigrants—the sec
tion on inter-racial problems finally
concluded that the blanket prejudice
which Americans show toward Orien
tals is absolutely opposed to our pro
fessed ideals of democracy and indi
vidual worth, that it has no biological
foundation and, if impossible to over
come, should at least be controlled,
and that any discrimination should
have an individual and not a color
basis.
This idea of person-to-person judg
ment instead of a general attitude of
indifference or opposition to Orien
tals was found to be a solution to
practically all of the adjustment prob
lems ordinarily connected with the
whole second-generation question. A
few applications of this principle of
individual valuation follow:
Ideal Bases of Immigration
(1) The ideal basis for immigration
restriction is not discrimination
against a whole race but rather
against undesirables of any color;
(2) vocations should be open to any
one who can prove himself competent
to handle the job, regardless of his
color; (3) all potential customers
should be so considered instead of
permitting the type of discrimination
found in certain barber shops, for in
stance, which refuse to serve Orien
tals; (4) residential segregation of
Orientals because of their color
should be displaced by acceptance or
non-acceptance of them as individual
residents and neighbors; (5) whole
sale invitations of "foreign students"
to social functions should be discour
aged in favor of a more personal de
sire to entertain certain of their num
ber; (6) a marriage between mem
bers of the two races should be judged
entirely on the personal compatibility
of the couple and not as the beginning
of a "menace to the white race," etc.
The two races would never wholly
lose their identities or want to, and
since it is only the fringes which ex
perience intermarriage it is only kind
to the individuals who attempt it to
remove the incubus of public opinion
against all such alliances. Likewise
any sort of social contact between
Americans and Orientals should be a
matter of personal choice without re
gard to color.
"Lump Classification" Opposed
The tenor of the whole discussion
was decidedly against "lump classifi
cation" of Orientals. Emphasis was
again and again laid on their separate
treatment as individuals educational
ly, vocationally, and socially.
In an attempt to discover what de
termined the prejudice the group ana
lyzed its causes to be mainly: (1) Eco
nomic—fear of competition; (2) his
torical —an early "conditioning" pro
cess of distaste for the early coolie
type of Oriental; (3) environmental —
a continuous campaign, usually blind
and unfounded in fact, in the home,
the school, and the press to maintain
public opinion against the Oriental
(perhaps an outgrowth of the self
preservation instinct in racial life).
Assimilation or What?
Shall it be assimilation or the main
taining of a parallel civilization? The
group of Orientals in America is too
small to be economically independent
nor is the parallel idea economically
sound; complete assimilation through
intermarriage is not the aim and pur

pcse of Orientals in this country: they
desire instead acceptance as Ameri
cans, individual treatment, and a lift
ing of public censure on intermarriage
j for those who wish to cross the color
; line.
Most desirable, then, is it to meet
Orientals as individuals who repre
| sent a different and culturally rich
1 civilization and to disparage the some
i what prevalent attitude of superiority \
which Americans hold toward those
! of another color.

against all such alliances. Likewise
any sort of social contact between
Americans and Orientals should be a
matter of personal choice without re
gard to color.
"Lump Classification" Opposed
The tenor of the whole discussion
was decidedly against "lump classifi
cation" of Orientals. Emphasis was
again and again laid on their separate
treatment as individuals educational
ly, vocationally, and socially.
In an attempt to discover what de
termined the prejudice the group ana
lyzed its causes to be mainly: (1) Eco
nomic—fear of competition; (2) his
torical —an early "conditioning" pro
cess of distaste for the early coolie
type of Oriental; (3) environmental —
a continuous campaign, usually blind
and unfounded in fact, in the home,
the school, and the press to maintain
public opinion against the Oriental
(perhaps an outgrowth of the self
preservation instinct in racial life).
Assimilation or What?
Shall it be assimilation or the main
taining of a parallel civilization? The
group of Orientals in America is too
small to be economically independent
nor is the parallel idea economically
sound; complete assimilation through
intermarriage is not the aim and pur

pcse of Orientals in this country: they
desire instead acceptance as Ameri
cans, individual treatment, and a lift
ing of public censure on intermarriage
j for those who wish to cross the color
; line.
Most desirable, then, is it to meet
Orientals as individuals who repre
| sent a different and culturally rich
1 civilization and to disparage the some
i what prevalent attitude of superiority \
which Americans hold toward those
! of another color.
SUMMARY OF THE SECTION ON
INTER-RACIAL PROBLEMS
(Editor's Note: This is the second of a
series of articles on the Student Institute of
Pacific Relations.)
Discussing particularly the difficult
position of second-generation Japa
nese —a group of Americans who are
subjected to the same discrimination
as Oriental-born immigrants—the sec
tion on inter-racial problems finally
concluded that the blanket prejudice
which Americans show toward Orien
tals is absolutely opposed to our pro
fessed ideals of democracy and indi
vidual worth, that it has no biological
foundation and, if impossible to over
come, should at least be controlled,
and that any discrimination should
have an individual and not a color
basis.
This idea of person-to-person judg
ment instead of a general attitude of
indifference or opposition to Orien
tals was found to be a solution to
practically all of the adjustment prob
lems ordinarily connected with the
whole second-generation question. A
few applications of this principle of
individual valuation follow:
Ideal Bases of Immigration
(1) The ideal basis for immigration
restriction is not discrimination
against a whole race but rather
against undesirables of any color;
(2) vocations should be open to any
one who can prove himself competent
to handle the job, regardless of his
color; (3) all potential customers
should be so considered instead of
permitting the type of discrimination
found in certain barber shops, for in
stance, which refuse to serve Orien
tals; (4) residential segregation of
