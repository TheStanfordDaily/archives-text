# COMMISSIONER IS QUESTION BEFORE COAST COACHES
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5.
terranean rumblings that shook this
mecca of the West's football clan to
night as coaches, graduate managers,
and faculty representatives of the
Pacific Coast Conference prepared to
open their annual meeting here to
morrow, indicated that the question
of a commissioner for the circuit
would come up before the gathering.
Talked about for the last two or
three annual meetings, the question
never has been brought up on the
convention floor. However, it was in
dicated that there has been a decided
trend in favor of such a football head,
one who would appoint all officials
and settle all matters of eligibility,
as Major J. L. Griffiths does in the
"Big Ten."
But one obstacle was reported as
standing in the way of the selection
and appointment of a commissioner,
and that was the man to fill it. With
the job a big one, it requires a big
man to fill it, and as yet the right
one has not been found, it was said.
Coach Charley Erb of Idaho is ex
pected to bring onto the floor of the
convention a motion that fould limit
Stanford, California, Washington, and
Southern California each to 30 players
when playing against the smaller
teams of the conference. The greater
reserves of the "big four" institutions,
he contends, stand as a heavy handi
cap to the smaller teams.
