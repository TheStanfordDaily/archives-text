# MOVIES OF ARMY TILT SHOWING IN PALO ALTO
## 
### 
The New Stanford Theater is now
running exclusive pictures of the Stan
ford-Army football game, played in New
York December 1, at the Yankee Stadi
um. These pictures were received over
air-mail Tuesday night and will be shown
this week.
The Stanford fans who sat in front
of a radio last Saturday and pulled loy
ally for the team can seize the opportun
ity to supplement their mental pictures
of the game received from the announc
er's account, with some actual views of
the team in action. It is reported that
the pictures are exceptionally clear and
easy to follow, and unusually detailed.
They are considered the best pictures of
football taken this season.
