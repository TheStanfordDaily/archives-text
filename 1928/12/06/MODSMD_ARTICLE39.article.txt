# CONFERENCE ON WAR MATERIAL MAY BE CALLED
## 
### 
GENEVA, Dec. 5 (./P). —An interna- |
tional conference may be convoked as
the result of a meeting which started
here today of the special commission
which is seeking to frame an agreement
concerning the control and the manufac
ture of war material. A free exchange
of views between members of the com
mission gave rise to a hope that it could |
find common ground among the many I
divergent \iews on the subject.
There were two principal schools of
thought in the conference, reflecting
ideas which had been advanced at previ
ous gatherings. Countries which do not
manufacture arms have complained that
they might be under the handicap of re
vealing their full equipment for national
defense, whereas manufacturing coun- !
tries would be under no such obligation, i
The amount of publicity to be given to
the purchase of arms abroad as compared
with that given to the manufacture of
arms at home, was the dividing point.
