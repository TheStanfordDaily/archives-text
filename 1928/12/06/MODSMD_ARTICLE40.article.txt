LONDON, Dec. 5 (/P). —The condition
of King George tonight was not very
reassuring. His physicians in the usual
evening bulletin said that his temperature
had risen in the last 24 hours, indicating
increased activity of the lung infection.
The uneven nature of the fight which
His Majesty is waging against the dis
ease was shown by the official reports
issued today. Two factors, however
stand out as important. The king has
been able to get good periods of sleep
and it was announced in an otherwise
less favorable bulletin this evening that
his "strength is maintained."
The Prince of Wales is making good
speed on his homeward journey. The
cruiser Enterprise, after loading supplies
at Aden today, again headed for Suez
where it is due early on Friday. The
Duke of Gloucester continued his jour
ney to Capetown from where he will sail
for London.

Fifteen thousand questionnaires j
have been sent out by Harvard Uni
