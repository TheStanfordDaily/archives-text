# WARNING NOTE ISSUED IN 1931 MYSTERY PLAY
## Several Sophomores Make Campus Debuts in Davis' Comedy-Thriller 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
Beware of the haunted house!
This is the warning given by Edward
Evans, father of Emily who is spending
| her honeymoon in the house her father
| believes to be haunted, in the Sophomore
J play which will be given Saturday night
|in the Assembly Hall. Evans writes to
hCr:
"My dear children: Once more I beg
11 of you not to spend a night in that ter
rible house. Charge it to an old man's
folly if you please, and let Thomas (the
chauffeur) drive you on to the hotel at
Ridgefield."
This is the opening situation of Owen
Davis' comedy-thriller. Gordon Davis
has chosen a play replete with thrills,
chills, and laughs, and he has a group
of students who will be making their
| campus debuts in the "Haunted House."
Tom Henry will make his first campus
I appearance as Desmond Duncan, the
I writer of mystery novels, who carries the
j play along with his lines. Henry has
| had a good deal of experience in Shake
spearean roles before he came to Stan
ford, and promises a good performance.
Katherine Keho, as Helen, the wife
of Duncan, has one of the main roles.
She appeared in the Gaieties with tnark
; ed success as the naughty young miss of
| '99. Anne Frick plays the part of the
J young bride about whom the action cen
i ters. Robert Kirkwood plays the young
1 husband who is involved in the intrigues
I of the haunted house.
Elizabeth Cooper has the role of Isa
bel, who is quite well-known to all the j
i characters in the play, and she has an !
excellent opportunity to show her dra- j
matic ability in the role which is inti-
J mately connected with the Strang occur- j
j ences in the haunted house.
Harold Helvenston has created one j
! the scene of the Evans' summer home
j set for the action of the play. This is
!at Cedar Bluff, New York. The set is
| flexible enough to represent the many
1 moods of the play as the shudders and ;
J laughs of the lines follow each other. It |
is a realistic set.
Off-stage noises are very important in j
j this mystery comedy, and the lighting |
I will set off the spiritualistic seance of I
j the second act. Arthur Hurt and Char- j
lotte Hatch are helping Gordon Davis
in the staging of the play.
There are still some good seats left
at the Old Union, according to Edwin
Smith, dramatic manager. These may
be secured from 1 to 5 o'clock in the
Union for $1 and $1.25.

This is the opening situation of Owen
Davis' comedy-thriller. Gordon Davis
has chosen a play replete with thrills,
chills, and laughs, and he has a group
of students who will be making their
| campus debuts in the "Haunted House."
Tom Henry will make his first campus
I appearance as Desmond Duncan, the
I writer of mystery novels, who carries the
j play along with his lines. Henry has
| had a good deal of experience in Shake
spearean roles before he came to Stan
ford, and promises a good performance.
Katherine Keho, as Helen, the wife
of Duncan, has one of the main roles.
She appeared in the Gaieties with tnark
; ed success as the naughty young miss of
| '99. Anne Frick plays the part of the
J young bride about whom the action cen
i ters. Robert Kirkwood plays the young
1 husband who is involved in the intrigues
I of the haunted house.
Elizabeth Cooper has the role of Isa
bel, who is quite well-known to all the j
i characters in the play, and she has an !
excellent opportunity to show her dra- j
matic ability in the role which is inti-
J mately connected with the Strang occur- j
j ences in the haunted house.
Harold Helvenston has created one j
! the scene of the Evans' summer home
j set for the action of the play. This is
!at Cedar Bluff, New York. The set is
| flexible enough to represent the many
1 moods of the play as the shudders and ;
J laughs of the lines follow each other. It |
is a realistic set.
Off-stage noises are very important in j
j this mystery comedy, and the lighting |
I will set off the spiritualistic seance of I
j the second act. Arthur Hurt and Char- j
lotte Hatch are helping Gordon Davis
in the staging of the play.
There are still some good seats left
at the Old Union, according to Edwin
Smith, dramatic manager. These may
be secured from 1 to 5 o'clock in the
Union for $1 and $1.25.
Beware of the haunted house!
This is the warning given by Edward
Evans, father of Emily who is spending
| her honeymoon in the house her father
| believes to be haunted, in the Sophomore
J play which will be given Saturday night
|in the Assembly Hall. Evans writes to
hCr:
"My dear children: Once more I beg
11 of you not to spend a night in that ter
rible house. Charge it to an old man's
folly if you please, and let Thomas (the
chauffeur) drive you on to the hotel at
Ridgefield."
