# EL TORO TAKES TRACK LAURELS IN MURAL TILT
## Oliver Crandall Cracks Old Record in High Jump; Taylor Wins Shot, Discus Breakers Win Second Place; Freshmen Show Strength; Theta Xi Leads on Row 
### 
A new high jump record for the fall
intramural track and field meet was set
yesterday by Oliver Crandall, El Toro
performer, when he cleared the bar at
five feet, ten and three-quarters inches,
which eclipses the former record by more
than an inch.
El Toro, taking points in eleven out of
fifteen events, easily won first place for
total score, while Breakers and Encina
2E followed for second and third honors.
Theta Xi, high-point fraternity, tied
for fourth place with Encina 3E.
Good Records Made
Records in all events for the day were
very fair. Ray Ede, Breakers distance
runner, holder of the present record, was
hard-pressed up to his last lap by Ed
Kennedy, Theta Xi, who finished second.
Walt Cooper's time of 2:07 in the half
mile run is only one second over the old
record, and Virgil Dowell's broad-jump
of 22 feet 6J4 is worthy of mention.
Perry Taylor, Breakers weight-throw
er, was the only man to take two first
places. He won the shot-put and discus
throw. Paul Mott, unattached, had next
high individual score with eight points,
while Crandall took six.

intramural track and field meet was set
yesterday by Oliver Crandall, El Toro
performer, when he cleared the bar at
five feet, ten and three-quarters inches,
which eclipses the former record by more
than an inch.
El Toro, taking points in eleven out of
fifteen events, easily won first place for
total score, while Breakers and Encina
2E followed for second and third honors.
Theta Xi, high-point fraternity, tied
for fourth place with Encina 3E.
Good Records Made
Records in all events for the day were
very fair. Ray Ede, Breakers distance
runner, holder of the present record, was
hard-pressed up to his last lap by Ed
Kennedy, Theta Xi, who finished second.
Walt Cooper's time of 2:07 in the half
mile run is only one second over the old
record, and Virgil Dowell's broad-jump
of 22 feet 6J4 is worthy of mention.
Perry Taylor, Breakers weight-throw
er, was the only man to take two first
places. He won the shot-put and discus
throw. Paul Mott, unattached, had next
high individual score with eight points,
while Crandall took six.

fifteen events, easily won first place for
total score, while Breakers and Encina
2E followed for second and third honors.
Theta Xi, high-point fraternity, tied
for fourth place with Encina 3E.
Good Records Made
Records in all events for the day were
very fair. Ray Ede, Breakers distance
runner, holder of the present record, was
hard-pressed up to his last lap by Ed
Kennedy, Theta Xi, who finished second.
Walt Cooper's time of 2:07 in the half
mile run is only one second over the old
record, and Virgil Dowell's broad-jump
of 22 feet 6J4 is worthy of mention.
Perry Taylor, Breakers weight-throw
er, was the only man to take two first
places. He won the shot-put and discus
throw. Paul Mott, unattached, had next
high individual score with eight points,
while Crandall took six.
