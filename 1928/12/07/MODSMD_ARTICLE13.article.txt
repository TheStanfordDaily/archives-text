# APPOINTMENT OF NEW REPARATIONS GROUP EXPECTED
## 
### 
PARIS, Dec. 6 (/P). â€”Confidence is
expressed in official circles in Paris that

a new committee of reparations experts
will he appointed before the end of the
year despite delay in the reply by the
entente powers to the latest German
note on the matter.

It is stated that Germany's position
regarding the political aspects of the
negotiations will have no bearing on the
work of the experts which in no sense
will be considered here as final or as
binding on the governments.

S. Parker Gilbert, agent-general for
reparations, went over all the remaining
details with Premier Poincare while here
recently and it is understood that the
two men are in full accord.
