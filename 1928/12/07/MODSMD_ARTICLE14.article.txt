# KROUGH LEAVES TOMORROW FOR N.S.F.A. MEETING
## Wilbur May Speak at Fourth Congress of Students Held in Missouri 
### 
Ted Krough, vice-president of the
A.S.S.U., will leave tomorrow to at
tend the Fourth Annual Congress of
the National Student Federation of
America to be held at the University
of Missouri, Columbia, from Decem
ber 12 to 15. Krough was apopinted
as Stanford's representative by the
Executive Committee in the place of
Phil Cavalero, A.S.S.U. president,
whose work in the law school pre
vented him from attending. President
Wilbur has been invited to speak at
the Congress, and there is a possi
bility that he may.

"Stanford has something of real
value to contribute to the Federation
in its Students' Organization Fund,"
according to Krough. "We are the
only University in the country with
the exception of the University of
Kansas that has such a fund."
Fund Founded in 1919
In October 1919 the Students' Or
ganization Fund was founded for the
purpose of consolidating and co-ordi
nating the accounts carried by vari
ous student organizations. The Uni
versity of Kansas organized its sys
tem in 1924 upon the basis of the
Stanford Fund. The business of the
fund is carried out under the direc
tion of the Manager and Treasurer
appointed by the President and Execu
tive Committee of the A.S.S.U. All
student organizations receiving sub
scriptions, donations, or other funds
with the exception of living groups
and clubs operate under this Organi
zation Fund. "It has proved very ef
ficient," said Krough.
To Discuss Honor System
Discussion groups will be one of
the main features of the N.S.F.A. con
gress, and in the subjects will be the
interests and problems of the Ameri
can students. The Honor System is
scheduled to take a leading place in
the discussions. J. T. Jackson, a
graduate of the University of Ala
bama who has written a thesis on
the Honor Systems of practically all
the institutions of the country, will
read his paper, and lead the discus
sion on this subject. Stanford should
get something of value from this,
since the Honor System is its prin
ciple student problem today.

Other topics which will be taken
up are athletics, militarism in educa
tion, and the value of the R.O.T.C.
The Federation is now working on a
financial and executive basis for itself,
and is establishing a President's of
fice and a Permanent Central office
in New York City. It has also done
a great deal along the line of student
travel and foreign relations.

Kansas that has such a fund."
Fund Founded in 1919
In October 1919 the Students' Or
ganization Fund was founded for the
purpose of consolidating and co-ordi
nating the accounts carried by vari
ous student organizations. The Uni
versity of Kansas organized its sys
tem in 1924 upon the basis of the
Stanford Fund. The business of the
fund is carried out under the direc
tion of the Manager and Treasurer
appointed by the President and Execu
tive Committee of the A.S.S.U. All
student organizations receiving sub
scriptions, donations, or other funds
with the exception of living groups
and clubs operate under this Organi
zation Fund. "It has proved very ef
ficient," said Krough.
To Discuss Honor System
Discussion groups will be one of
the main features of the N.S.F.A. con
gress, and in the subjects will be the
interests and problems of the Ameri
can students. The Honor System is
scheduled to take a leading place in
the discussions. J. T. Jackson, a
graduate of the University of Ala
bama who has written a thesis on
the Honor Systems of practically all
the institutions of the country, will
read his paper, and lead the discus
sion on this subject. Stanford should
get something of value from this,
since the Honor System is its prin
ciple student problem today.

Other topics which will be taken
up are athletics, militarism in educa
tion, and the value of the R.O.T.C.
The Federation is now working on a
financial and executive basis for itself,
and is establishing a President's of
fice and a Permanent Central office
in New York City. It has also done
a great deal along the line of student
travel and foreign relations.
Ted Krough, vice-president of the
A.S.S.U., will leave tomorrow to at
tend the Fourth Annual Congress of
the National Student Federation of
America to be held at the University
of Missouri, Columbia, from Decem
ber 12 to 15. Krough was apopinted
as Stanford's representative by the
Executive Committee in the place of
Phil Cavalero, A.S.S.U. president,
whose work in the law school pre
vented him from attending. President
Wilbur has been invited to speak at
the Congress, and there is a possi
bility that he may.

"Stanford has something of real
value to contribute to the Federation
in its Students' Organization Fund,"
according to Krough. "We are the
only University in the country with
the exception of the University of
Kansas that has such a fund."
