CAMDEN, N.J., Dec. 6 (/P). — The
Navy dirigible Los Angeles today as
sisted in a test of a contrivance designed
to make safer the landing of aircraft in
fog, and called a "super-directional
horn."
The horn is so constructed it can
throw a volume of sound along a path
as a searchlight can focus light. The
sound is not diffused and may be di
rected at the will of the operator. The
device was developed by Lieut. R. C.
Mayer of the Los Angeles' crew and
S. T. Williams of the Victor Talking
Machine company.
When the Los Angeles was 3,0()0 feet
above the roof of the Victor company's
plant where the horn was placed, music
was thrown toward it, and the dirigible
replied by Hashing a light that it had
heard the sound. Other music was
thrown successfully as the ship flew
10,000 feet away from the horn.
