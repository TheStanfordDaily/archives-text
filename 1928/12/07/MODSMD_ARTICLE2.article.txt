# COTILLION OPENS SOPH FESTIVITIES
## 
### 
Shades of Cleopatra! Mark Antony,
Julius Caesar, King Tut, and Old Ra
meses II will stalk in spirit at the So
phomore Cotillion tonight.
With all plans completed, the Pavilion
has been transformed to represent one
of the old temples of the Valley Nile,
with much of the glamour and color of
ancient Egypt in the decorations.
Leo Gerckins and his orchestra will
be housed in a brilliant arras at the east
end of the Pavilion, this arrangement
prohibiting the roughs from viewing the
dance, as the eastern bleachers will be
hidden behind the drapes forming the
orchestra's stand. Punch and cakes will
be served from niches at the west end
of the hall, and rooms in keeping with
the Egyptian motif have been provided
for the patrons and patronesses, who
will include Dean Mary Yost, and Dean
Culver.
Eavors and programs for die dance ar
rived yesterday and may be obtained at
the office of the Old Union upon pres
entation of both bids and tickets. Fa
vors this year arc a distinct departure
from former styles. They are in the
form of bracelets, made of six bands of
imitation gold and silver and clasped by
a ring from which a Stanford pennant is
suspended.
A very few bids still remain and will
be on sale until the office closes at 5
o'clock tonight.
