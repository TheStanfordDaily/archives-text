# Everybody Wants to Welcome the Varsity Today!

It would be a fine thing, a fine thing if the cheering thou
sands who attend the rally this noon could stave off the
demands of appetite until about 12:30, by which time the
proper amount of welcoming will have been accomplished.
Encina Commons will wait lunch fifteen minutes, commenc
ing the dote of rations at 12:30; other tables might well fol
low suit.
After all, we ought to devote at least twenty-six minutes
to a team which made twenty-six points.
The football team is certainly coming in for the lion's share of glory,
land, and honor. San Francisco will gulp down its coffee this morning and
haste away to Market Street, up which the Reds will be escorted in parade
at 8:30 o'clock. The Mayor is to welcome them at the Civic Auditorium
and present them with souvenirs of the pride California has in them. San
Francisco is turning itself inside out to honor the Stanford Varsity; Stan
ford students ought to appreciate the tribute the metropolis is paying their
team. For a long time we have been trying to steal some of the good will
which San Francisco has until recently lavished upon Berkeley. Now we
are in the graces of the big city, they're pulling for our team, and they
think we're O.K.
It is in view of this peculiar situation that the Daily was sorry to see
the l>and refused permission to participate in San Francisco's welcome.
While to think of dismissing classes and allowing the entire student body
to go to San Francisco was out of the question, still the band ought to have
been given leave to represent the student body. The Stanford Band is the
most popular band in Northern California, we venture to say, and its pres
ence on Market Street, expressing Stanford spirit with some lusty tooting,
would have added to the occasion the Stanford atmosphere which it will
now lack.
If the team can be spared two weeks in which to go to New York, the
band ought to have been spared four hours for a highly important mission
in San Francisco.
Forgetting our snarling for the nonce, let us now give a cheer for the
city where fog and water meet. We like its spirit!

to go to San Francisco was out of the question, still the band ought to have
been given leave to represent the student body. The Stanford Band is the
most popular band in Northern California, we venture to say, and its pres
ence on Market Street, expressing Stanford spirit with some lusty tooting,
would have added to the occasion the Stanford atmosphere which it will
now lack.
If the team can be spared two weeks in which to go to New York, the
band ought to have been spared four hours for a highly important mission
in San Francisco.
Forgetting our snarling for the nonce, let us now give a cheer for the
city where fog and water meet. We like its spirit!
