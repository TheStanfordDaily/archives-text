# A 						Different Picture Today
## 
### 
Not so many years ago a college president could deliver a baccalaureate
sermon with good conscience and conceivably even with some enthusiasm.
He was wise and his youthful congregation admittedly foolish. He knew
what was true and they probably did not. His opinion carried weight and
authority, which some at least of his auditors were prepared to admit. How
different the picture today! To encounter the prestige of authority, one
must repair to a museum of antiquities. Youth is both morally and intel
lectually superbly self-confident. Despite the pronouncement of Professor
Whitehead that we are all afflicted with invincible ignorance, youth knows
the most extraordinary things, not a few of which are true, and it has no
taste for listening to its elders laying down the law. . . .
Your generation is allegedly keen for intellectual and moral liberty, just
as your Colonial forbears were keen for political liberty. Much of the lure
of the so-called radical doctrines which have always fascinated youth, as
no doubt they fascinate you, is that they often promise freedom to do and
think exactly what one likes, casting aside the tiresome shackles of estab
lished moral habit and religious tradition. To be sure, this promise of a
moral Elysium involves ultimately a painful disillusionment. Freedom of
a genuine kind is not to l>e won by any such simple process of mere intel
lectual and moral disrobing. But the sudden sense of a removal of old
restrictions and inhibitions, long grown irksome, is extremely exhilarating
while it lasts.â€”President Angell, Yale University.

Merry Christmas to all, and we hope you get a lot of neckties
