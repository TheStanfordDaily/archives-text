## WINSTON NORMAN IS SADLY RIDDLED 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems that we have in our midst an
ambitious journalist who is attempting
to "out sibyl the Sibyls"; namely, one
Winston Norman, editor of the "Bull
session." In succession, he has chal
lenged, and disposed of, several of our
most complicated problems. The relation
of football to the universities has been
covered; the alcohol question has had its
inning; the working students of the Uni
versity have been informed that they are
burning both ends of the candle.

In its last edition, the "Bullsession" cli
maxes its oracular career by casting or
ganized religion, bag and baggage, into
the discard. After reading "The Student
Credo," one is inclined to believe that the
"alcoholic days" which a former article
described as "the happiest of the year"
have not failed to leave an effect upon
the "Bullsession." In a most flagrant
"ipse dixit" attitude, it comes forth with
the news that "organized religions will
disintegrate, and most of our churches,
a few decades hence, will be replaced by
structures of material purpose"â€”depend
ent, of course, upon a series of causes
which are dogmatically attributed to the
Religious attitude of the modern stu
dent. Qmte & pronouncement for the
"Bullsession." And yet, it is one which
is far from novel. The column may take
solace in the fact that it is echoing the
sentiments of no less a literary genius
than Voltaire, who gave the Bible about
a hundred years before it should be com
pletely forgotten. Despite the fact, as
the column states it, that the average
student never reads the Bible, it re
mains the world's best seller. Despite
the fact that Mr. Norman kindly allows
our churches a few decades of precari
ous existence, our age is witnessing a
widespread activity in church building.
The greatest American church, the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine, is
steadily rising above the sidewalks of
New York. In our National Capital,
another great Cathedral on St. Albans
Hill is adding its testimonial to the liv
ing faith which has inspired it. Next
door to us in San Francisco, Grace
Cathedral will soon dominate the bay
district from its site on Nob Hill. It

will be decades before most of these great
edifices are finished. Won't it be too bad
that they will be completed only to be
turned into "structures of material pur
pose?" It may be that the "Bullsession"
is related to "Philip Space," who gave
this as the only reason for not adding

the Memorial Church to the bonfire: "It
is unwieldy, and besides, would not burn
well."
In the most approved fashion of dog
. matic theology, the "Bullsession," pre
] sumably having undertaken no research
' on the matter, draws up a list of reli
-1 gious beliefs which the modern student
i has discarded. This, by some strange
paradox, it calls "The Student Credo."
! In its eagerness to put into the student
| mouth everlasting damnation of "organi
! zed theology" its persecutions of "Galli
leo,' Copernicus, and Scopes," it entirely
forgets that except for "organized theol
ogy" very likely there would be no
"modern student" to express such a con
i demnation. The fact that religion was
I the casket of civilization while the world
! was groping in darkness, that during
| those times, it founded the first hospi
| tals, dispensed first justice, and insti-
I tuted the highest morality, escapes un
j noticed. Religion's acknowledged sta
| bilizing influence upon the world today
j is also forgotten. No attention is given
: to the results of a questionnaire circu
lated on our Campus last April. They
are as follows: Atheists, 41; Agnostics,
171; Indifferent, 165; Occasional church
goers, 332; Active church members, 125.
"The Student Credo" is simply a phe
nomenon of an age of unparalleled in
tellectual freedom for youth. From the
restraints and inhibitions of the Victo
rian age, when youth was forced into
religion, "volens, nolens," it has emerged
into a mental freedom which seems in
toxicating. Things formerly held most
sacred arc condemned with impunity;
the learning and wisdom of centuries
are disposed of, in two columns of a
college paper; problems which have en
gaged the minds of the world's great
minds for thousands of years are dis
sipated by youth like so much smoke.
It surely must be but a passing phase.
If correctly interpreted, it should cause
no difficulties. If treated intelligently,
there is no danger of God's throne be
ing overturned, or the world experienc
ing another period of decadence such as
marked the pre-Christian Romans with
their "personal religions which were ac
tually a philosophy of life, a system of
ethics."
I am not a "militant fundamentalist":
just one of those odd souls who still
considers a diurch service of more im
portance than "rest, study, or catching
up lost sleep."
Yours very truly,
STURGIS RIDDLE.
