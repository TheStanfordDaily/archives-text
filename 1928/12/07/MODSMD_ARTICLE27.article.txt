# The 						Bullsession
## STURGIS SOLVES THE GREAT RIDDLE 
### 
(N.B. See Campus Opi
"There is no danger of God's throne
being overturned."
Through this the well-belov«d Riddle
stabbed; and as he plucked his cursed
steel away, mark how the blood of Nor
man followed it. This was the most
unkindest cut of all.
Friends, classmates, lend me your
ears; I come to bury Norman, not to
praise him. The noble Riddle hath told
you Norman was ambitious. He was my
colleague, faithful and just to me in my
recent absence. But Riddle says he was
ambitious; and Riddle is an honorable
man.
He hath brought many an idea to Bull
session, whose diverting words did the
general interest arouse: did this seem
ambitious? Yet Riddle says he was am
bitious ; and Riddle is an honorable man.
When that the thirsty have cried, Nor
man hath wept and given sweet words
of surcease. Ambition should be made
of sterner stuff; yet Riddle says he was
ambitious. And Riddle is an honorable
man.
Oh, freedom of the press, thou art fled
to brutish beasts, and men have lost their
reason. Bear with me; my heart is in the
coffin there with Norman, and I must
pause till it comes back to me.
How sad it is that I haven't a sense of
humor. Although now that Mr. Riddle
has assured me that God is in his heaven
after all, I see no chance of change. I
bow to the inevitable and accept my
humorless fate. But then everything will
come out all right in the end because had
I a sense of humor one glance at Mr.
Riddle's campus opinion printed today
would have sent me laughing myself to
weakness, to unconsciousness, and then,
alas to the grave.
There is a god; there in religion. Mr. j
Riddle said so. But then Mr. Riddle !
where, oh where, have I read that be- I
fore? Surely that can't be original with
yon! Ipse dixit, Mr. Riddle, ipse dixit.
Not agreeing with Mr. Riddle nor yet
with Mr. Norman, allow me (they tell
me 1 am nominal editor of Bullsession) |
to present the following bit of in forma- j
tion. Bullsession is a column of opinion, j
criticism, discussion, comment, and fea- I

! ture material. As yet it has not proven
! oracular, but perhaps now that there is
j a God, there may be hope. I, like Mr.
, Norman, might be called an ambitious
journalist, and what with fifty per month
salaries facing us as the ultimate, per
haps we might be given the breaks and
called brave. Furthermore, if Mr. Rid
dle wants to write a student credo of
his own, he is hereby invited to do so
, and will find this corner of the Daily
j open to him.
As to this Great Riddle answered so
well by Mr. Riddle as to the existence
of God. The editor of Bullsession sadly
echoes (Bullsession's echo says Mr. Rid
dle) the sentiment of Immanuel Kant
who not proving either the existence or
inexistence of God and knowing that be
lief in God could be no disadvantage,
whereas disbelief might prove uncom
fortable sometimes, chose to believe. And
Immanuel is dead. Selah. Menc mene
upharsin.

Through this the well-belov«d Riddle
stabbed; and as he plucked his cursed
steel away, mark how the blood of Nor

unkindest cut of all.
Friends, classmates, lend me your
ears; I come to bury Norman, not to
praise him. The noble Riddle hath told
you Norman was ambitious. He was my
colleague, faithful and just to me in my
recent absence. But Riddle says he was
ambitious; and Riddle is an honorable
man.
He hath brought many an idea to Bull
session, whose diverting words did the
general interest arouse: did this seem
ambitious? Yet Riddle says he was am
bitious ; and Riddle is an honorable man.
When that the thirsty have cried, Nor
man hath wept and given sweet words
of surcease. Ambition should be made
of sterner stuff; yet Riddle says he was
ambitious. And Riddle is an honorable
man.
Oh, freedom of the press, thou art fled
to brutish beasts, and men have lost their
reason. Bear with me; my heart is in the
coffin there with Norman, and I must
pause till it comes back to me.
How sad it is that I haven't a sense of
humor. Although now that Mr. Riddle
has assured me that God is in his heaven
after all, I see no chance of change. I
bow to the inevitable and accept my
humorless fate. But then everything will
come out all right in the end because had
I a sense of humor one glance at Mr.
Riddle's campus opinion printed today
would have sent me laughing myself to
weakness, to unconsciousness, and then,
alas to the grave.
