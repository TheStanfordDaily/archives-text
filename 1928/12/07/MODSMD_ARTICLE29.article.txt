With the approach of the annual
Hypocrisy Season, a great army of
i lake department-store Santa Clauses
; have come out of hibernation, dusted
the mothballs from their regalia, and
j are getting good wages once more for
| the heinous work of deceiving small
children.
"What is your name, my little
man?" asks Santy No. 3719 in a rich
bourbon baritone, beaming from be
[ hind an ambush of snowy goat-hair.
"M-my name is Oscar," trembles
the little chap—"and all I want for
I Christmas is a bobsled and a Shetland
i pony and an electric train and a Mec
cano set and a motorcycle and a shot
gun—and a lot more things but I'm
all out of breath."
"Dear me," says Santy No. 3719,
"how simple your wants are! I and
the Peingold Department Stores, Inc.,
feel sure that when you peek into
your little stocking on Xmas morn,
you will find all those presents neatly
wrapped, service with a smile. Credit
Manager fourth floor." And Santy
winks at the small child's mother.
Oscar's mother, wondering how
much longer the Sheriff will wait pa
tiently on the doorstep, takes her
progeny by the hand and, blushing
pitifully, hurries toward the outer
door of Feingold Department Stores,
Inc.
People of America —up and to arms!
Let us stamp out now and forever
that menace to childhood, mother
hood and husbandry—the bogus de
partment-store Santa Claus!
This accomplished, and becoming
yet more enthusiastic, let us set to
work to eradicate that greatest and
most useless of American sideshows
—Christmas! There is probably no
human custom which has departed so
completely from its original intent as
this, our quaint celebration of the
birth of Jesus Christ.
If there is anything in this Second
Coming business, let us pray that the
Savior doesn't arrive anytime near
Christmas; for if He should watch
human beings trampling on each
other's bodies and tearing one an
other's hair to get at the $1.98 coun
ter, and if He were then told that this
was in preparation for His birthday,
the shock would probably kill Him.
• Dolly Glutz, cute little misspeller
in an insurance office, joins a Savings
Club and piles up a Yuletide sinking
fund. She sends out presents totaling
$122.75. When all returns are in from
outlying relatives, Dolly discovers
that the presents she received cost
a total of $128.10. Hooray! $5.35 to
the good! Christmas has been a suc
cess!
Later, suffering a New Year hang- j
over, Dolly admits that none of her
presents is worth a cent to her. Six
of her maiden aunts sent her muskrat
muffs, and the seventh a pair of
knee-length flannel undies which
would show a foot and a half below
her skirt. Dolly had sent her maiden
aunts some nice, flimsy pantie-chem
ises that those ladies have already
hidden in the attic.
In other words, the Glutz family
have thrown away $250.85, absolutely
(brown it away. And who has won?
Nobody but Feingold Department
Stores, Inc.
Take away the department-store
ballyhoo and Christmas would disap
pear with a dull, sickening thud. And
it would be a good thing.
In addition to all the above incon
trovertible arguments, we personally
are flat broke.

With the approach of the annual
Hypocrisy Season, a great army of
i lake department-store Santa Clauses
; have come out of hibernation, dusted
the mothballs from their regalia, and
j are getting good wages once more for
| the heinous work of deceiving small
children.
"What is your name, my little
man?" asks Santy No. 3719 in a rich
bourbon baritone, beaming from be
[ hind an ambush of snowy goat-hair.
"M-my name is Oscar," trembles
the little chap—"and all I want for
I Christmas is a bobsled and a Shetland
i pony and an electric train and a Mec
cano set and a motorcycle and a shot
gun—and a lot more things but I'm
all out of breath."
"Dear me," says Santy No. 3719,
"how simple your wants are! I and
the Peingold Department Stores, Inc.,
feel sure that when you peek into
your little stocking on Xmas morn,
you will find all those presents neatly
wrapped, service with a smile. Credit
Manager fourth floor." And Santy
winks at the small child's mother.
Oscar's mother, wondering how
much longer the Sheriff will wait pa
tiently on the doorstep, takes her
progeny by the hand and, blushing
pitifully, hurries toward the outer
door of Feingold Department Stores,
Inc.
People of America —up and to arms!
Let us stamp out now and forever
that menace to childhood, mother
hood and husbandry—the bogus de
partment-store Santa Claus!
This accomplished, and becoming
yet more enthusiastic, let us set to
work to eradicate that greatest and
most useless of American sideshows
—Christmas! There is probably no
human custom which has departed so
completely from its original intent as
this, our quaint celebration of the
birth of Jesus Christ.
If there is anything in this Second
Coming business, let us pray that the
Savior doesn't arrive anytime near
Christmas; for if He should watch
human beings trampling on each
other's bodies and tearing one an
other's hair to get at the $1.98 coun
ter, and if He were then told that this
was in preparation for His birthday,
the shock would probably kill Him.
• Dolly Glutz, cute little misspeller
in an insurance office, joins a Savings
Club and piles up a Yuletide sinking
fund. She sends out presents totaling
$122.75. When all returns are in from
outlying relatives, Dolly discovers
that the presents she received cost
a total of $128.10. Hooray! $5.35 to
the good! Christmas has been a suc
cess!
Later, suffering a New Year hang- j
over, Dolly admits that none of her
presents is worth a cent to her. Six
of her maiden aunts sent her muskrat
muffs, and the seventh a pair of
knee-length flannel undies which
would show a foot and a half below
her skirt. Dolly had sent her maiden
aunts some nice, flimsy pantie-chem
ises that those ladies have already
hidden in the attic.
In other words, the Glutz family
have thrown away $250.85, absolutely
(brown it away. And who has won?
Nobody but Feingold Department

Take away the department-store
ballyhoo and Christmas would disap
pear with a dull, sickening thud. And
it would be a good thing.
In addition to all the above incon
trovertible arguments, we personally
are flat broke.
