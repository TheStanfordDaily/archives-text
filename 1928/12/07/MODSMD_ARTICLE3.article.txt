NEW YORK, Dec. 6. (ff)â€”Federal
Judge Thatcher today dismissed a
$30,000,000 suit against the estate of
John Jacob Astor brought by de
scendants of Christopher and Valen
tine Emerick, brothers of John Nicho
las Emerick, who was Astor's partner
a hundred years ago.
The plaintiffs based their suit on an
alleged trust established by John
Nicholas Emerick in 1815. Its terms
provided, the complaint, stated, that
ninety years after the date of its exe
cution, the principal and accumula
tions of Emerick's holdings in his
partnership with Astor should be di
vided among descendants of Emer
ick's brothers, Christopher and Valen
tine.
The suit involved valuable proper
ties now held by the Astor estate,
among them the site of the Hotel
Astor in Times Square and that of
the famous Trinity Church at the
head of Wall Street.
