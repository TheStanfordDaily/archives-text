Agreeing first that imperialism is the
major economic problem ot the Pacific
area, the third section of the conference
devoted its meetings to a consideration of
imperialism in Nicaragua, China, and the
Philippines, especially as related to Uni
ted States policy in these regions.
Regardless of America's ostensible con
cern over dishonesty in Nicaraguan poli
tics and her neighborly participation in
cleaning up the government, the group
came easily to the conclusion that in Cen
tral America imperialism is her main de
sign, dependent in degree on the strength
of the Latin country concerned. But
such a policy is essentially expensive,
both in regard to naval outlay and loss
of good will, and therefore United States
intervention in Nicaragua—a specific in
stance of force backing up capital from
the mother country, and thus decidedly
imperialistic—was judged to be unwise
because economically inexpedient. This,
of course, considers the matter only from
our point of view.
Unprotected Investment
If it is unwise, then, to back up one's
capital in a foreign country by force,
will investors consent to an "unprotected"
investment? Here someone suggested
that capitalists expect to take risks in
ordinary investments and should not de
mand governmental protection simply be
cause certain holdings are on foreign
soil; but the main argument in favor of
sponsoring this denationalized type of
investment was that it created far more
good will toward the investing country
and that, after all, it was good will
which brought in the greatest returns.
Imperialism in China opened a wide
field for speculation. Discussing first
Japanese activities there, the section ad
mitted that Japan's imperialistic moves
have l)een actually as beneficial to China
as they have been disadvantageous, citing
construction of the South Manchurian
railway as one decidedly useful interest.
China does not at all discourage this sort
of economic penetration but does em
phatically refuse to tolerate its being sup
ported by force, especially the unneces
sary use of force that characterized the
recent Tsinan incident.
Japan Follows Investor
On the other hand, Japan argues that
the flag should follow both immigrant
and investor until China achieves eco
nomic equality with the rest of the world
and proves herself strong enough to op
pose foreign aggression, and China comes
back with the assertion that not until
foreign interference is removed can she
achieve this economic stability.
Although the situation seems here to
be deadlocked in a tangle of idealism and
practicality, a way out was found in the
tact that the new Chinese Nationalist
government is actually adhering to Dr.
Sun Yat Sen's principles of stabilization,
and that in spite of continued foreign in
fluence China will fairly soon come into
her own.fl Then economic stability will
be established and will be sufficient guar
anty for foreign investments—and the
Chinese will continue to encourage them.
Investments Bring Political Interest
But there is always a possibility that
economic interest in a foreign country
will lead to an unwelcome political inter
est. Here the point was made, however,
that the economic interests of Japan,
(ireat Britain, and the United States, all
heavy investors in China, will inevitably
interact as the investments increase until
they become a definitely restricting in
fluence on force as employed by any one
of the three. This more or less involun
tary co-operation of the investing coun
tries with one another and with China
will be the best safeguard against direct
imperialism. As the foreign economic
superstructure increases it will be its own
protection.
The section painted a sunny picture of
American interests in China: although
when originally conceived the Open Door
policy might have been tinged with im
perialism — the United States was not
averse to providing for her share of the
spoils—now America's interests in China
are purely economic (as opposed to Ja
pan's desire for Korean and Manchurian
territory for her surplus population) and
are primarily concerned with creating
and maintaining good will between China

and the United States. State Department
policy lias been dictated by this group of
American investors, who seem to realize
what certain people want American in
vestors in Nicaragua to realize: namely,
that good will is more valuable commer
cially than armed backing. There are
still, however, small bits of imperialistc
desire sticking to American policy in
China. And as someone put it, "America
has too much money in China, Japan too
many men."
Philippine Independence
The group found that the question of
Philippine independence is intimately con
nected with American economic interests
in the islands. Consequently the chief op
position to granting independence to the
Filipinos comes from the large investors
there, who evidently feel more secure
under the American flag. As to the Fili
pinos themselves, they admit that their
people are more prosperous than before
they came under United States jurisdic
tion, but at the same time they are will
ing to undergo the temporary economic
depression that would result from their
being granted independence simply be
cause they would be achieving national
status.
The FiHpinos themselves have an al
most child-like faith that the United
States will keep its word (the Jones Act
of 1916, guaranteeing independence when
the people show ability to govern them
selves), even though they have been ready
for independence, according to the terms
of the Jones Act, since the World War
and have not yet seen it granted. But in
view of the fact that American economic
interests are opposed to this, it seems un
likely that chances for independence will
increase when these become stronger ev
ery year. In short, it will have to be
now or never.
Three Conclusions Drawn
Three conclusions were drawn from
the discussions on Nicaragua, China, and
the Philippines: (1) force is an unsatis
factory backing for economic penetration
of a foreign country because it leads so
easily into political imperialism, which
rarely is satisfactory to both parties;
(2) in lieu of force as a guaranty for
foreign investments nations should sub
stitute mutual good will, based on the
economic argument that greater gains
come through this attitude than through
intervention in behalf of vested interests;
(3) for the greater benefit of all parties
foreign investors should drop their na
tionalistic leanings while on foreign soil
and should consider themselves solely as
individual investors, interested in win
ning the good will of the government in
whose country they are investing.
