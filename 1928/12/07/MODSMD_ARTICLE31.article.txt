SACRAMENTO, Dec. 6 (/P)â€”Boxers
who want to fight in California may
have to dig up character references as
well as health credits if the state ath
letic commission adopts the policy it has
been talking about.
When the commission meets next
month to adopt its policy Southern Cali
fornia members are expected to propose
that license applicants not only submit
to a rigid physical examination but pro
duce competent references as to their
morals.
Charles F. Traung, chairman of the
commission, declared today that the
"misfits" are being weeded out of the
California boxing game and that the
commission intends to raise ring stand
ards by making it harder for boxers to
secure licenses.
