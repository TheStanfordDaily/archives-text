Do think that my letters to the presi
dent should touch on a number of things,
for I have found that I have become
excessively angry at a number of times
during the year, but when I stop to
think the major items have all slipped ;
my mind in the melancholy that is be- 1
ginning to surround me at the thought
of losing all my pleasant friends.
But I shall surely write about one j
problem—that the women in this Uni-'i
versity are taking too good care of
themselves, and are taken too good care
of. There does seem to be an almost
nasty-minded readiness on the part of
the majority of women to expect the
worse, and to have a premonition of
disaster rather than optimistic expecta
tions, and that most of the regulations i
for the conduct of women are made with
that attitude uppermost.
It does seem that the ten-thirty ruling
is made with an eye to the terrible things
that might happen if a young girl were
out till later rather than an appreciation
of the virtuous ways in which she might
logically spend her time; and it docs
seem that the regulations about intoxi
cating beverages and smoking are made
with the expectation that if they were
not made the women would instantly
fall prey to the most public and impos
sible dissipation in smoke and alcohol.
And considering this question of virtue
and its protection leads me to think
that the natural flatfootedness of the j
feminine sex is encouraged here at Stan- '
ford at the expense of a great many
qualities.
