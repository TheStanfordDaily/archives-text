# SEAGRAVE TO TRY FOR NEW MARKS IN SPEED REALM
## 
### 
MIAMI, Fla., Dec. 6 (/P). â€” Major
11. O. D. Seagrave, England's noted au
tomobile racing driver, comes to Ameri
ca in February as a double threat artist
in the realm of speed.

The driver who heretofore has limited
himself to wheels, will take a turn at
the rudder of a newly created speed boat
in the Biscayne Bay regatta here next
March, and has challenged Gar Wood to
pit the new "Miss America VII" against
his specially designed "Miss England"
for a "world title."

But before Seagrave tries the water,
he declared in a letter to regatta officials
here, he intends to re-establish a world
speed record on the sand at Daytona
Beach, Fla., in February. Early this year
he established a mark of 206.7 miles an
hour, only to see Ray Keech of Phila
delphia do 207.5 right behind him. Both
had machines regarded of freakish de
sign but which withstood A.A.A. tests.
