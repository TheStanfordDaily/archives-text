### SYLVA WEAVER 
pOMU AT ONCE. There has been a murder." This is the text of a tele-
gram sent from Emily, the young bride, to her father in Owen Davis'
mystery-thriller, "The Haunted House," which will be presented by the
sophomore class tomorrow night at 8:20 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
"There is a pleasing variety of characterization among the members of
the cast," said Gordon Davis last night at dress rehearsal. "Each one of
them has a feeling for his character, and each role is given a distinction

the mystery that sweps the play
i along."
Actors New on Campus
SMost all of the students in "The
Haunted House" are new to the cam
pus stage, and their debuts promise
much interest to Stanford playgoers.
y ' Prom the dramatic ability shown by
l ~ i Katherine Keho in the Gaieties, and
: from the Shakespearian experience of
Tom Henry, good performances will
n be expected of them in their respec
e tive roles of the novelist and the
novelist's wife.
j Robert Kirkwood and Anne Frick
U ! play to each other, and it is around
the young wife's desire to spend her
' honeymoon in the haunted house that
the action of the play rises. Until she
(j
begins to hear weird sounds, to see
C dark doors open strangely, to have
e
j clanging chains dragged by invisible
forces over the second-story floor;
I and to be plunged into utter darkness
j by these same invisible forces, she
' thinks her father's summer cottage is
0 a precious little place.

Comedy Element Present
A good deal of the comedy element
t is supplied by Burnell Gould as the
county constable whose tender heart
; causes him to flutter about helplessly
and then faint at the sight or men
-0 I
I tion of blood. Gould gives his role a
c |
. j sympathetic interpretation. Joe
| Thompson as Ed, the milkman, Henry
y Lane as the New York detective,
s
Charles Brink as Tomas, and Bill
1 Scott as the tramp come in for their
. share of the laughs. Irving Rosen
-3 blatt, from his previous campus ap
pearances, promises well as the father
of the bride.
Elizabeth Cooper has the most
melodramatic role in the play. She is
i Isabel —the object of Duncan's
' j"cherchez la femme" policy, and the
J \ mystery clings to her skirts, and
| while it might be said that that isn't
1 all that clings to Isabel's skirts, per
i ; haps the playgoers had better wait
f | for the final curtain to unravel the
- skeins of Isabel's mystery knot for
- ! them.
- I Thrills Promised
* I "The Haunted House" will afford
! the campus a thrilling evening of
i | deep, black mystery and "whoopie,"
i and should prove a most entertaining
> and delightful version from the peru
t i sal of the books in the light of the
- midnight oil that is going on during
- | these cold nights before finals.
! { There are still a few good seats left
- : for the play, according to Edwin
- Smith, dramatic manager. These seats
■ will be on sale today from 1 to 5
o'clock in the Old Union. Roughs'
• seats will be sold at the performance
, tomorrow night.
