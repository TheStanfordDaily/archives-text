### 
CHICAGO (£>).—A parrot with a 250-
word vocabulary and a goldfinch that
operates a windlass were among the
strange pets entered by amateur owners
in the first national pet show here.

There also were midget horses that
can cakewalk, a dog of five feet, a 23-
pound cat, a talking cuckatoo, trick dogs
and milk goats without an odor.
The goldfinch hoisted drinking water
into his cage with a tiny windlass and
pulled feed in a cart. Prizes were given
animals showing unusual intelligence and
others that had chxibited heroism. The
most valuable pet was a $10,000 German
shepherd dog, owned by Mrs. Elizabeth
Trass.
