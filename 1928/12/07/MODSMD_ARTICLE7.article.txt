# SOLONS BATTLE ON IMMIGRATION ALLOTMENT ACT
## Boulder Dam Again Placed In Preferred Position For Discussion 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. (/P)—Con
gress had its first post-campaign
political skirmkish today, revolving
around the relative positions of Her
bert Hoover and Governor Smith on
immigration, and its mildness empha
sized the letdown in the firing which
blazed away so heavily from both
sides prior to the national conven
tions last June.
It was a debate in the Senate over
the national origins clause of the Im
migration Act which would fix the
number of immigrants coming into
this country on the basis of immi
grants already admitted from various
countries. Both Governor Smith and
Mr. Hoover figured in the running
debate which went along for an hour
or more, with various Senators cit
ing their immigration stands but
without the heat exhibited in the ses
sions of six months ago.
Boulder Dam Up Again
Finally the discussions ended quiet
ly when the Boulder Dam bill was
once again placed in its preferred
place as the business at hand, and
the Senate proceeded with this much
disputed piece of legislation.

Although the day was a quiet one
for the two houses, President Coolidge
furnished an issue, should anyone de
sire to so consider it, by sending up
the names of Roy O. West of Illinois,
and William F. Whiting of Massachu
setts, to be secretaries of the Interior
and Commerce departments. Indica
tions that there might be a fight on
Mr. West cropped up immediately.
Chairman Nye of the Public Lands
Comittee, said he would ask the sec
retary to appeal before the commit
tee for questioning as to whether he
had been connected with the Samuel
Insull utility interests of Chicago. Nye
called his committee into session for
Saturday at the request of several
Senators who wanted the matter
threshed out.
