# SOME GREAT KICKERS
## 
### Feg Murray 
"Great kicks from little to-corns grow,"
as Aesop or Shakespeare—no, I guess it
,was Bunyan—once said, and I can prove
the truth of the saying by the bare-footed
punting, drop-kicking, and place-kicking !
of Mr. Henry "Honolulu" Hughes, of j
the Oregon State Agricultural team
which gave the Violent Violets of New j
York University such a surprising trim
ming on Thanksgiving day. Henry gave
an exhibition before the game of kicking ,
a hard football with his bare tootsies, but
put on his booties when the game began.!
Among the great kickers in football j

history, the names of such old-timers as
Pat O'Dea, Alex Moffat, and Walter
Eckersall stand out, although nobody
around here is trying to prove that they
; were better all-around booters than
| Harry Kipke, Cbarley Brickley, or
| George Gipp. Eckersall, of Chicago, was
I a fine punter, but excelled in drop-kicking
i field-goals, kicking five against Illinois
in 1905 and repeating against Nebraska
the following year. Charley Brickley
kicked field-goals for Harvard against
i Yale in 1913. Alex Moffat, of Princeton,
j is supposed to have invented the spiral

kick. He kicked with either foot with
equal ease. Pat O'Dea, of Wisconsin, is
known as football's longest kicker. He
once kicked a 50-yard drop kick while
running at full speed, and both he and
George Gipp, of Notre Dame, have 62-
yard field goals to their credit. J. T.
Haxall, a Princetonian contemporaneous
with Moffat, once made a 65-yard kick.
Sam i'elton, of Harvard, was one of
the most famous of all left-footed kick
ers. Billy Bull; of Yale, was another.
Harry Kipke, of Michigan, is known as
the most accurate of all punters. He used

to practice kicking a football all sum
mer long. Two boys who came through
in the pinches for "dear old Harvard"
! were Vic Kennard, who beat Yale in 1908
I with a left-footed drop-kick, and Karl
Pfaflfman, who won in 1923 with field
! goal with his right foot.
J George Walsh, of movie fame, known
! as one of the best-built men in America,
I was a famous all-around star at Ford
' ham back in 1909. He was a great base
| ball player, and one of the best kickers
! the East ever knew. He could boot 'em
: high, wide, and handsome !
