# LINOTYPE OPERATED BY TELEGRAPH WIRE IN EXPERIMENT AT ROCHESTER
## 
### 
ROCHESTER, N.Y., Dec. 6 (JP).—A !
telegraph wire operated two newspaper j
typesetting machines here today at the i
plant of the Rochester Times-Union.
Dispatches by wire were transferred t
mechanically directly into the machines,
with human touch eliminated, and were ,
recorded in lines of metal type, each as
long as a news column is wide.
The object of the invention is to I
shorten the time and work required to ;
transfer news from the place where it
occurs to the printed page. It is de
signed to be another step in development :
of the distribution oi the printed word,
which lx:gan when movable type was
invented l»y Johannes Gutenberg at
Strassburg in 1438.
Test Made in One Room
The sending was done in the demon- j
stration room to two machines on the |
opposite side of the room, which were
operated simultaneously from the same ;
wire. One was a linotype and the other ■
an intertype. The short sending wire
was made equivalent to a distance of
140 miles by resistance coils.
The sender punched a tape, seven- i
eighths of an inch wide, which operated !
the telegraph wire by sending impulses !
corresponding to the holes in the tape. ;
At the receiving end an instrument a
little larger than a typewriter produced j
a punched tape exactly similar to the ,

| sending tape. This receiving tape then j
ran automatically through a small elec
i trical machine on a stand beside the
! typesetting machine. The little machine
i once more translated the tape holes into ;
| electrical impulses. >
j The electric waves were carried by a j
wire to an apparatus roughly resembling ;
: a large human hand, fastened to the side !
lof the typesetting machine. Each metal |
; finger controlled a number of letters and
| characters of the typesetting machine, :
which it released according to the im- '
pulse received, and when it gave the re- j
lease signal the typesetting machine func- |
tinned exactly as if a human operater ;
i had pressed down the key for a letter or ;
' character.
The teletype setter is a development of ,
j automatic telegraph printers, differing ;
| principally in but one respect, that it j
uses a tape with six punch units, instead !
!of the standard five units. The extra
\ unit is required to cover all characters
of a typesetting machine, which out
, number those of automatic printers.
| The sponsors predict special value for j
j the teletypesetter in transmitting market i
| quotations directly into type, and an op
! portunity for book publishers to save
j the expense of keeping large stores of |
metal type plates. Instead of metal plates j
i the tape may be filed, ready for return
! when reprints are desired.
