Now that (with apologie√ü to 110 ,
one) the "Big Game" is over, let us | .
get something off our chest. We would ,
fain have done this immediately after i |
the occurence of the incident, but we j ,
patriotically refrained due to our de- !
sire to present a united front against i
the Golden Bear.
Yes, you have guessed it, it's about !
the premature burning of the bonfire.
If you would tell us to forget it, that
it's all over, we retort, all over but
the paying! According to the Daily
of Nov. 27, we, the Associated Stu
dents, are to be presented with a bill '
somewhere around $1200. We would 1
gladly forget the fire if the bill is |
forgotten also.
Therefore, as long as this little
trick is to cost us a "pretty penny,"
seems fair that we should have the
right to be concerned with the mat
ter. Here is our suggestion: That the
President of the Student Body ap
point a special committee of five (5)
(of which no member shall be a mem
ber of the Rally Committee or the
Daily) which shall have the power
to subpoena any member of the stu
dent body, and whose duty shall be
to investigate this ease thoroughly.
This committee shall then make such
recommendations as it may see fit to
the Men's (or Women's) Council (or 1
both).
We concede that this may be an
unusual case.
We might add also that if this sug
gestion is not followed (and it does
appear to us that our officers hardly i
ever take the initiative in anything
unless forced by petitions) we shall
regard it as connivance and will act
accordingly.
