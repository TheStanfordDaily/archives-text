SACRAMENTO, Dec. 6 (/P). — Al
though the epidemic of influenza that has
prevailed in California in mild form
since the tirst of October is the first
since the 1918 run of the disease, it is
by no means serious or widespread, the
state department of public health re
ported today.
Statistics show that in 1918 approxi
mately 150,000 cases of influenza were
reported during the preceding six weeks
and that deaths totaled in the neighbor
hood of 10,000.
The health department's reports for
the six weeks' period ending Nov. 17,
1928 shoy a total of 10,426 cases and a
negligible number of deaths.
Dr. Walter M. Dickie, head of the de
partment, stated that in general the in
fection this year has been mild. His
survey shows that the epidemic first
broke out in the Bay district—that it has
eased up here and prevails in the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin valleys and is
extending to the southern part of the
state.
Dickie said that a second wave may
appear during the winter months.
