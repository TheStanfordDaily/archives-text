PULLMAN; Wash., Dec. 6 (P.1.P.)
A troupe from the Imperial Theater of
Tokio recently gave a performance at
the Washington State College. The cast
included thirty of the most prominent
actors in present day Japan, and the
production included instrumental music
of the most Oriental type, sword com
bats, jiu-jitsu encounters, and daring
leaps from high balconies. The costumes
used were hand-worked garments of
beautiful materials, enough goods having
been used in each one for three occi
dental dresses.
