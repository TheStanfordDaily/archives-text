SACRAMENTO, Dec. 6 (/P). â€”A pro- j
posal to draw the net still tighter about '
California's "maniac" slayers is contained !
: in a bill to be submitted to the lcgisla- j
i ture in January by Assemblyman S. L. j
i Heisinger of Selma.
The bill, as Heisinger outlined it for
i the Associated Press, provides that a !
prisoner will automatically incur life I
imprisonment with the plea of "not j
guilty by reason of insanity."
Prisoners who wish to escape the pen- j
alty for premeditated murder will iind
; the possible retreat through the asylum
to freedom closed to them, Seisenger ,
I said.
"Such a law," Heisinger said, "would
I obviate miscarriages of justice, protect !
k society from the company of the dan
gerously insane, deter would-be murder
ers and take from the people the burden <1
; of proof of sanity in the majority of i
murder cases."
