# HUNT PREPARES CAGE TEAM FOR COMING SEASON
## 
### 
With one scalp safely under his belt
plenty of room for inure, Coach
Husky Hunt, Cardinal cage mentor, is
now busily engaged preparing his charges
for tin: start of the regular basketball
season early next quarter. For the pur
pose of getting a better idea of the pros
pective material now on hand, a second
game has been scheduled with the San
Jose State Teachers College Spartans for
next Friday.
The San Jose quintet will be coming
Up the peninsula determined to repay the
Stanford ragers for the 27 to 18 defeat
at their hands last Tuesday, and, if
I lunt's charges don't show a better brand
of pl.ly in this game than in the last,
their chances are not inconsiderable.
Hunt Enthusiastic
The Cardinal coach is enthusiastic over i
the prospects for the coming season and
declares himself satisfied with the show
ing of the team in last Tuesday's game.
Practice for the next few days will be i
taken up principally with the develop
ment of a strong defensive, since prac
tice sessions for the past week or so
have been concerned only with the of- j
fensive department of the game.
With the return of the football team '
to the campus, four valuable players will
Ik- added to the cage squad including
Captain Harlow Rothert, Greer Thomp
son and Bill Simpkins, guards, and
Chuck Smalling center. Some of these
men are sure to see action in the return
game with San Jose.
McCandless May Start
John McCandless, husky center, who
was taken out of last Tuesday's game
on four fouls in as many minutes of
play, will probably l>e given another
chance to prove his worth. Competition
4<etwecn McCandless, Mears and Small
ing is expected to be very keen, with
William Okker, lanky red-head, hot on
their heels.
/Ymong the forwards who have been
showing up well in practice are Berg, i
Hawkins, Hepp, and Richards, Haw- \
kins, although only a sophomore, proved I
himself to be one of Hunt's l>est pros-!
pects when he saved the game for the \
Stanford team last Tuesday and took,
high point honors in one quarter of play, j
