SACRAMENTO, Dec. 6 (/P). â€” The
city of Sacramento is going to take a
hand in making the city safe for
everyone. City Engineer B. C. Clark has
offered free inspection of Christmas tree
electric lighting system.
"We don't want serious accidents mar
ring the holiday spirit," Clark declared,
"and the only way to be sure that the
proper electrical installations have been
made is to inspect the trees after they
have been decorated."
