Dallas—A Skyscraper City of the Southwest
A GREAT change in the skylines of this country has taken
place in recent years, especially in the West. Where
formerly great expanses ot open range were the rule, now
the West is dotted with rapidly growing cities and towns, and
where one and two-story buildings were ample for the commer
cial needs of these cities, today the tall building is necessary.
More and more, as the center of population moves
steadily westward, our cities beyond the Mississippi are grow- B
ing upward, and Otis equipment and Otis service, instantly
available anywhere, are doing their part in the vast develop
ment program.
All skyscrapers, East orW W est, were made possible by the
elevator—and the world's first safe elevator was an Otis.
