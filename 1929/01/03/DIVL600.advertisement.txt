Jest a-sittin', smokin' Edgeworth
An' a-thinkin', dear of you;
An' a candle's burnin* brightly.
An' it says your love is true.
For the days are long, of waitin',
An' the nights are longer still,
An' sometimes (always smokin')
I pick up this old quill—
An' try to write some poetry
To tell you of my love.
As poetry it ain't much good.
But—holy days above-
It's jest the best I can, an' so
You'll find me, when I'm through.
Jest a-sittin', smokin' Edgeworth,
An' a-thinkin', dear, of you.
