# VARSITY GAGERS TRIM Y.M.I., WIN, LOSE AT NEVADA
## Extra Period Rally Defeats Institute Team at Kezar; Pacific Is Next Opponent 
### BURNELL GOULD 
While the merry, merry college boys
and girls were away getting Christ
mas packages in their socks, turkey
in their stummicks, and confetti down
their necks during the holidays, the
hard-working Stanford varsity cagers
were traveling hither and yon in the
attempt to win a few basketball
games.
That their attempt was moderately
successful is shown in an extra-period
victory over the San Francisco Y.M.I,
and two games divided with the
Nevada Wolfpack at Reno. The Sage
brush battles both ended with the
score 26-22, while Stanford trimmed
the Institute pastimers 37-31, or 37-33,
one of the two.
Cards Favored
There's some dispute about the
score, but most people are willing to
concede Stanford won. Things were
kind of confused at Kezar Pavilion
anyhow, what with the lights going
off for ten minutes, and the Cards
leading at the half after they had
gone on again.
Two vicious scoring attacks were
all that saved the Redshirts in the
iwo games that they won. In the
Y.M.I, fracas Stanford allowed the
fast San Franciscans to creep up and
tie the score at the end of the regu
'ar time.
Then Fawcett went wild. (If he
goes wild a little oftener this season,
Stanford should have a real forward.)
Content with feeding Red Berg up to
this time, Fawcett broke loose with
two baskets to put Stanford out in
front. Berg likewise looped one, in
fact he looped enough to be high
point man.
Nevadans Falter
Another sweeping rally featured the
second Nevada contest. Behind at
halftime, the Cards came back to
push the Sagebrushers out of the way
and win.
It was Johnny McCandless who did
most of the scoring at Reno. His four
straight baskets in the second game
were responsible for quite a bit of
consternation and elation, with
Nevada registering the former and
McCandless' teammates the latter,
and why not?
"Ye author" did not go to Nevada
and didn't seem to have much time
to get around to practice yesterday
afternoon, so the gentle reader will
have to form "his" own conclusions
regarding the team's present ability.
However, Stanford will tackle the
College of the Pacific Tigers tomor
row night in the local Pavilion (right
here on the campus, you remember)
and at this time Stanford fans will
have a chance to see the varsity in its
official Homecoming game.
Tampcke to Start
Swede Righter, Stanford alumnus,
is coaching the Tigers to wallop the
daylights out of the Cardinals, but
Husky Hunt has other plans. With
Mike Reynolds out of the lineup with
a touch or two of influenza and Red
Thompson ineligible until he hits the
books a bit, Hunt will use John
Tampcke with Captain Harlow Roth
ert at guard.
Red Berg and Vance Fawcett are
in the lead for the forward jobs, with
McCandless playing offensive pivot
man. Rothert jumps center and then
drops back to his guard position.

Stanford should have a real forward.)
Content with feeding Red Berg up to
this time, Fawcett broke loose with
two baskets to put Stanford out in
front. Berg likewise looped one, in
fact he looped enough to be high
point man.
Nevadans Falter
Another sweeping rally featured the
second Nevada contest. Behind at
halftime, the Cards came back to
push the Sagebrushers out of the way
and win.
It was Johnny McCandless who did
most of the scoring at Reno. His four
straight baskets in the second game
were responsible for quite a bit of
consternation and elation, with
Nevada registering the former and
McCandless' teammates the latter,
and why not?
"Ye author" did not go to Nevada
and didn't seem to have much time
to get around to practice yesterday
afternoon, so the gentle reader will
have to form "his" own conclusions
regarding the team's present ability.
However, Stanford will tackle the
College of the Pacific Tigers tomor
row night in the local Pavilion (right
here on the campus, you remember)
and at this time Stanford fans will
have a chance to see the varsity in its
official Homecoming game.
Tampcke to Start
Swede Righter, Stanford alumnus,
is coaching the Tigers to wallop the
daylights out of the Cardinals, but
Husky Hunt has other plans. With
Mike Reynolds out of the lineup with
a touch or two of influenza and Red
Thompson ineligible until he hits the
books a bit, Hunt will use John
Tampcke with Captain Harlow Roth
ert at guard.
Red Berg and Vance Fawcett are
in the lead for the forward jobs, with
McCandless playing offensive pivot
man. Rothert jumps center and then
drops back to his guard position.
While the merry, merry college boys
and girls were away getting Christ
mas packages in their socks, turkey
in their stummicks, and confetti down
their necks during the holidays, the
hard-working Stanford varsity cagers
were traveling hither and yon in the
attempt to win a few basketball
games.
That their attempt was moderately
successful is shown in an extra-period
victory over the San Francisco Y.M.I,
and two games divided with the
Nevada Wolfpack at Reno. The Sage
brush battles both ended with the
score 26-22, while Stanford trimmed
the Institute pastimers 37-31, or 37-33,
one of the two.
Cards Favored
There's some dispute about the
score, but most people are willing to
concede Stanford won. Things were
kind of confused at Kezar Pavilion
anyhow, what with the lights going
off for ten minutes, and the Cards
leading at the half after they had
gone on again.
Two vicious scoring attacks were
all that saved the Redshirts in the
iwo games that they won. In the
Y.M.I, fracas Stanford allowed the
fast San Franciscans to creep up and
tie the score at the end of the regu
'ar time.
Then Fawcett went wild. (If he
goes wild a little oftener this season,
Stanford should have a real forward.)
Content with feeding Red Berg up to

two baskets to put Stanford out in
front. Berg likewise looped one, in
