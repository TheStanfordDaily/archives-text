LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2. (/P)— At
9:40 tonight, the Army plane
Question Mark was still flying in
an attempt to shatter the inter
national endurance refueling rec
ord.
METROPOLITAN AIRPORT, Los
Angeles, Jan. 2. (/P) —With the crucial
first 24 hours of continuous flight
safely behind it, the army refueling
endurance test plane Question Mark
tonight was nearing the time record
set in the only previous American re
fueling endurance test. Already hav
ing remained in the air 35 hours, the
tri-motored Fokker at 8:45 o'clock
here tonight will have passed the
mark of 37 hours, 15 minutes, 40 sec
onds, made in August 1923, by Lieuts.
Lowell Smith and Paul Richter, in
an army plane at Rockwell Field, San
Diego. The present world record, 60
hours and 7 minutes, was made by
two Belgian army fliers at Tirlemont,
Eelgium, last June.
Steadily purring over a loop course
between here and San Diego, the
Question Mark late this afternoon
swung about the Metropolitan Airport
pylon. A message was dropped re
questing that Rockwell Field's uupply
plane be notified to meet the big Fok
ker along the coast near San Diego
with 250 gallons of gasoline. The
plane's schedule calls for refueling at
4 p.m., midnight, and 8 a.m., daily,
according to a plan adopted by Major
Carl Spatz, commanding officer, and
dropped here today.

The Question Mark's log, a copy of
which is dropped in sections here, re
ported today that night refueling "is
easy." The declaration was made after
the first night refueling was accom
plished over San Diego at midnight
with Capt. Eaker, pilot, who handles
the controls during refueling contacts,
as its author. However, Major Spatz,
who handles the receiving end of the
gasoline hose, was obliged to make a
varying report when he recorded that
the first aid kit was used as the re
sult of the retreating hose spraying
his face with a shower of gasoline.
