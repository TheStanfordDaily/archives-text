The rules will be the same as usual.
During the first period a sorority may

being allowed to issue a further in

house. Dates include only luncheon
and dinner, the former starting at
12:15 and ending at 1:30 o'clock,
when all freshmen must be out of
the houses. The dinner dates are from
6 to 8:15 o'clock. Flowers, candles,
place cards, and nut cups, which the
first-year women cannot take as sou
venirs, are the only decorations al
lowed, according to Panliellenic rules.

The invitations are given by the
sororities to Ellen Woerner, president
of Panhellenic, who distributes them
in Roble to the freshman women. In
vitations for the first period came out
tarly this morning, and for the sec
ond period they will be given out next
