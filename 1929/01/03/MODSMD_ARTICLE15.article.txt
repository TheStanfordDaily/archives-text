# JUDGE LINDSEY GIVES EXPLANATION OF COMPANIONATE MARRIAGE VIEWS
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
"Companionate marriage is not a new
kind of marriage," said Judge Ben B.
Lindsey in an interview, "nor is it a
proposal for such. It is a proposal to
legalize and scientifically direct the cus
toms of modern, present-day marriage.
"We are going through a terrific
j change in our living conditions. The
i old-fashioned home has broken down
and is fast passing away. I have evolved

America are married. If we legalized the

Air Economic Fight
"Companionate marriage is a fight for

j fewer large families, for the poorer
mothers who are denied the knowledge
{ the well-to-do people get illegally now.
"My plan will successfully reconcile
more than one-third of the discordant
I couples who separate. It provides for the
i establishment of houses of human wel

: houses would be run by committees con

[ in domestic relations.
"As for the utterly incompatible cou
ples, they ought to have a divorce. There
I i.s nothing more idiotic than the present
1 law which orders the judge to forbid a
1 divorce when t.c knows that both hus-
I band and wife want it.
