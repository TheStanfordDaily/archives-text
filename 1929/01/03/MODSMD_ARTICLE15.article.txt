# JUDGE LINDSEY GIVES EXPLANATION OF COMPANIONATE MARRIAGE VIEWS
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
"Companionate marriage is not a new
kind of marriage," said Judge Ben B.
Lindsey in an interview, "nor is it a
proposal for such. It is a proposal to
legalize and scientifically direct the cus
toms of modern, present-day marriage.
"We are going through a terrific
j change in our living conditions. The
i old-fashioned home has broken down
and is fast passing away. I have evolved
| a program to help remedy this dcplor
-1 able situation. I want to preserve mar
i riage and family life.
Present Customs Illegal
"Companionate marriage means the
| legalization of the present customs which
; are illegal and consequently bootlegged,
j It is a demand for the recognition of
! the right to use the best birth control
| methods, when children are not wanted,
I and for the recognition of divorce by
! mutual consent.
"Companionate marriage—when le
galized—will result in many more mar
riages and many less divorces. Only
M per cent of the eligible youth in
America are married. If we legalized the

| customs of marriage, many who fear
I the responsibilities of an unwanted fatn
j ily would get married.
Air Economic Fight
"Companionate marriage is a fight for
I the economic equality and freedom of
j women and the greater permanence of
! the marriage vows. It will result in a
1 greater number of smaller families, and
j fewer large families, for the poorer
mothers who are denied the knowledge
{ the well-to-do people get illegally now.
"My plan will successfully reconcile
more than one-third of the discordant
I couples who separate. It provides for the
i establishment of houses of human wel
j fare in place of divorce courts. These
: houses would be run by committees con
j sisting of psychiatrists and specialists
[ in domestic relations.
"As for the utterly incompatible cou
ples, they ought to have a divorce. There
I i.s nothing more idiotic than the present
1 law which orders the judge to forbid a
1 divorce when t.c knows that both hus-
I band and wife want it.
"San Francisco's present annual di-
vorce bill amounts to more than three >
million dollars. My house of human
| welfare commission could reconcile;
many of these cases and function for one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars a,
year.
"The state now backs up the church |
and the legal profession against com- j
panionafe marriage. The fundamental !
theory of the church was that sex is a
sin. Therefore, the church sanctions only
the procreative marriage anil opposes
birth control.
"I do not advise young men to take
up law. I have the greatest respect for
the bar, but one-half of its business is
devoted to the trying of divorce cases —
and that half is unnecessary. Out of
every one hundred cases tried in my
court in Denver, a lawyer was needed
for only one. One-half of the legal busi
ness will cease when companionate mar
riage is legalized.
Church, Bar Are Opponents
"My plan is opposed, you see, by the
church because of the theory that sex is
sin, and by the lawyers because it would
take away half their business. The medi
cal profession, however, is in sympathy
with the companionate marriage—the
doctors realize that you cannot make
young people good by keeping them ig
norant.
"There is an additional point to the
plan—the compulsory education of par
ents for the responsibility of raising
children. And this is necessary if we
are to make domestic relations a success.
"I have been misquoted and deliber
ately misunderstood. Companionate mar
riage has absolutely nothing in common
with theories of trial marriage or free
love. And it is absurd to say that my
plan will result in easier divorces. There
is nothing so easy now as getting a
divorce under the system of expensive
law courts. I merely ask for honest
divorces."
There are two responsibilities that
fall upon a judge, he explained. The
first is consideration of the case which
has come before the court, and the sec
ond is pointing out the causes that bring
it into court.
Causes of Domestic Troubles
"This second, and equally important
responsibility, is sadly neglected," ac
cording to Judge Lindsey. "After twen
ty-eight years' experience as a judge in
Denver, I am now utilizing my extensive
knowledge in the discussion of the causes
of domestic troubles."
He has written two much-discussed
books, "Companionate Marriage" and
"The Revolt of Modern Youth," based
on the cases that came into his court.
"I am going to write and lecture for the
next few years on the same subjects," he
replied when asked about his future
plans.
While in San Francisco he made per
sonal appearances at the Pantages Thea
ter. "This is the first time I've ever
done anything like this," he smiled, "and
I'm only doing it here in San Francisco.
People don't like to read books nowa
days—they'd rather go to shows. So per
haps I can reach many this way who will !
not take the trouble to read upon the
subject of companionate marriage."
Moving picture companies threatened j
to produce free love films and label them
an exposition of companionate marriage. !
"So 1 was myself forced into making |
a picture under the name of "Compa- j
nionate Marriage." We had to sue the
other companies to make them stop pi
rating my name for pictures absolutely ,
misrepresenting my ideas." Betty Bron- i
son is featured in the Lindsey film, which
he describes as "all right as far as it
goes."
"We're stewed in hypocrisy," he con
cluded, "but in time companionate mar
riage or some other progressive plan
will be favored by the thinking people |
of tliis country."
Women students at Northwestern
University are going to operate a
"dress clinic" in an attempt to stand- I
ardize their appearanee.

! mutual consent.
"Companionate marriage—when le
galized—will result in many more mar
riages and many less divorces. Only
M per cent of the eligible youth in
America are married. If we legalized the

| customs of marriage, many who fear
I the responsibilities of an unwanted fatn
j ily would get married.
Air Economic Fight
"Companionate marriage is a fight for
I the economic equality and freedom of
j women and the greater permanence of
! the marriage vows. It will result in a
1 greater number of smaller families, and
j fewer large families, for the poorer
mothers who are denied the knowledge
{ the well-to-do people get illegally now.
"My plan will successfully reconcile
more than one-third of the discordant
I couples who separate. It provides for the
i establishment of houses of human wel
j fare in place of divorce courts. These
: houses would be run by committees con
j sisting of psychiatrists and specialists
[ in domestic relations.
"As for the utterly incompatible cou
ples, they ought to have a divorce. There
I i.s nothing more idiotic than the present
1 law which orders the judge to forbid a
1 divorce when t.c knows that both hus-
I band and wife want it.
"San Francisco's present annual di-
vorce bill amounts to more than three >
million dollars. My house of human
| welfare commission could reconcile;
many of these cases and function for one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars a,
year.
"The state now backs up the church |
and the legal profession against com- j
panionafe marriage. The fundamental !
theory of the church was that sex is a
sin. Therefore, the church sanctions only
the procreative marriage anil opposes
birth control.
"I do not advise young men to take
up law. I have the greatest respect for
the bar, but one-half of its business is
devoted to the trying of divorce cases —
and that half is unnecessary. Out of
every one hundred cases tried in my
court in Denver, a lawyer was needed
for only one. One-half of the legal busi
ness will cease when companionate mar
riage is legalized.
Church, Bar Are Opponents
"My plan is opposed, you see, by the
church because of the theory that sex is
sin, and by the lawyers because it would
take away half their business. The medi
cal profession, however, is in sympathy
with the companionate marriage—the
doctors realize that you cannot make
young people good by keeping them ig
norant.
"There is an additional point to the
plan—the compulsory education of par
ents for the responsibility of raising
children. And this is necessary if we
are to make domestic relations a success.
"I have been misquoted and deliber
ately misunderstood. Companionate mar
riage has absolutely nothing in common
with theories of trial marriage or free
love. And it is absurd to say that my
plan will result in easier divorces. There
is nothing so easy now as getting a
divorce under the system of expensive
law courts. I merely ask for honest
divorces."
There are two responsibilities that
fall upon a judge, he explained. The
first is consideration of the case which
has come before the court, and the sec
ond is pointing out the causes that bring
it into court.
Causes of Domestic Troubles
"This second, and equally important
responsibility, is sadly neglected," ac
cording to Judge Lindsey. "After twen
ty-eight years' experience as a judge in
Denver, I am now utilizing my extensive
knowledge in the discussion of the causes
of domestic troubles."
He has written two much-discussed
books, "Companionate Marriage" and
"The Revolt of Modern Youth," based
on the cases that came into his court.
"I am going to write and lecture for the
next few years on the same subjects," he
replied when asked about his future
plans.
While in San Francisco he made per
sonal appearances at the Pantages Thea
ter. "This is the first time I've ever
done anything like this," he smiled, "and
I'm only doing it here in San Francisco.
People don't like to read books nowa
days—they'd rather go to shows. So per
haps I can reach many this way who will !
not take the trouble to read upon the
subject of companionate marriage."
Moving picture companies threatened j
to produce free love films and label them
an exposition of companionate marriage. !
"So 1 was myself forced into making |
a picture under the name of "Compa- j
nionate Marriage." We had to sue the
other companies to make them stop pi
rating my name for pictures absolutely ,
misrepresenting my ideas." Betty Bron- i
son is featured in the Lindsey film, which
he describes as "all right as far as it
goes."
"We're stewed in hypocrisy," he con
cluded, "but in time companionate mar
riage or some other progressive plan
will be favored by the thinking people |
of tliis country."
