# Stanford To Be Host To N.S.F.A. Meeting In 1930
## Ted Krough, Vice-President A.S.S.U., Returns From Missouri Congress 
### 
Stanford is to be host to the Fifth
Annual Congress of the National Stu
dents Federation of America, an
nounces Ted Krough, delegate to the
recently held Congress at the Univer
sity of Missouri.
On the last day of the convention a
resolution was passed accepting Stan
ford's bid for 1930 honors. For the
past three years the student repre
sentatives have met in the Middle
West. The new idea is to alternate the
location from extreme east to west,
so that delegates may see more of
their country.
The meeting which is to be held 011
the Farm will be the first week of
winter quarter, 1930. It will be na
tionally representative, bringing many
Easterners out here and give them
an idea of Coast country and condi
tions.

"One hundred and thirty-three dif
ferent colleges and universities were
represented by one hundred and
eighty different delegates," said
Krough. "The most important things
were accomplished in discussion
groups. Problems of student govern
ment were taken up; they formed a
clearinghouse of ideas where small
schools could present their problems
and get specific answers from larger
schools which had already met and
solved such difficulties."
