## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 2 (#>).â€”
Surgeon General Cumming today set
January 10 as the date for convening the
Public Health Service's national confer
ence on influenza.
Decision to hold the conference at that
time was announced after a conference
between the Surgeon General and Secre
tary Mellon of the Treasury. Secretary
Mellon, whose department has jurisdic- j
tion over the health service, it was said |
"heartily favored" the conference, par- ;
ticularly the opportunities it would pro- ]
vide to outline intensive research in the ;
disease.
Reports from thirty-two states, public
health officials said, indicated today that J
influenza declined in prevalence during
the holidays.
They repeated their belief in the prob
ability that the peak of this wave of in
fluenza has been reached, but still saw
the possibility that cases not yet reported
might be as many as existed during the j
week ended December 15.
A total of 132,682 new cases in thirty
two states during the week ending De
cember 29 was reported today. Officials
estimated this indicated at least 003,410 j
cases actually existing in these states, j
They estimated more than a million and !
a quarter cases in forty-two states for
the week ending December 15.
Officials said the conference to be held
here would be the largest ever held to i
study influenza. They noted that little
could be done to cut short the present
wave, but that information gained from
this may assist in curbing the spread in j
the future.
