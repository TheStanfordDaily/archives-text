# Hoover's Gain Is Stanford's Loss
## 
### 
The Classical Literature department, the School of Letters, and the
entire University have been dealt a sad blow by the new Administration.
President-elect Hoover has invited Dr. Augustus Taber Murray to be
resident minister at Washington of the Society of Friends. Dr. Murray
has accepted the place and will go to the capital at the end of the present
quarter.
As a resident of Palo Alto, Dr. Murray has been one of the leaders
of the Friends of this vicinity and has often preached in the Memorial
Church. He is a close friend of the Hoover family, and at Washington
he will of course be the "President's pastor."
Since 1892 Dr. Murray has been professor of Greek at Stanford,
holding alternately with Professor Emeritus Henry Rushton Fairclough
the title of head of the Classical Literature department. At present Dr.
Murray is chairman of the Council of the School of Letters.
Dr. Murray was educated at Johns Hopkins under Professor Gilder
sleeve, the celebrated classical scholar, and studied later at the Universi
ties of Leipzig and Berlin. Among his works are translations of Homer
for the Loeb Classical Library and of Euripides (forthcoming) and an
edition of Xenophon's Anabasis.

The loss of Dr. Murray fairly cripples what was once one of the
strongest departments of the classics to be found in any American col
lege. Two years ago Professor Fairclough was retired by operation of
the 65-years age limit. (Professor Fairclough has since been teaching
twelve months of the year at Amherst and Chicago.) Last summer quar
ter ended the professorial career of Dr. Jefferson Elmore, professor of
Latin. The latest departure leaves Professor B. O. Foster, present head
of the department, and E. W. Martin of the Old Guard, and Professors
Hansen and Harriman as recent additions to the department faculty.
On the selfsame day, the retirement of Dr. Murray and the acqui
sition of a million dollars are announced. Some may think that the gain
of the latter more than makes up for the loss of the former, but we
incline to the statement of Professor William B. Munro of Harvard that
''there is no substitute and there never can be any substitute for men in
the process of educationâ€”for earnest, enthusiastic, capable men in the
faculty and in the student body."
