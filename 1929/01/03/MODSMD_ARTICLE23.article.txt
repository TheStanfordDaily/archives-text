# The 						Finish In Sight

### 
At last the year after which the senior class was named rolls 'round,
that once distant, now too immediate, 1929. How imposing 1929 will look
when properly lettered in Gothic upon a diploma! How much it means
to seniors who will leave Stanford bearing it as a brand! This significant
year is the point dc depart of many careers, and as such is interwoven
with hopes, ambitions, dreams, and plans which, if laid end to end, would
reach entirely too far. Yet 1929 sees the final shattering of a lot of
perfectly good dreams, ambitions, etc.
Once intending athletes who now content themselves with intramural
horseshoes, engineers who have since gone into economics, bright high
school lads who are interested now in just getting by, promising person
alities warped by unfortunate friendships—these are the wrecks that the
four undergraduate years have made. Seniors are at length rounding the
last turn and coming into the home stretch, and—well, that is about all
there is to say. The race is nearly run. Stretch the tape, judges!
