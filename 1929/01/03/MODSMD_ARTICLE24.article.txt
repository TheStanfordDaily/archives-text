At a recent meeting of the Board of Athletic Control, a proposal was
taken into consideration to admit all students free to all varsity athletic
contests except the California, U.S.C., and post-season football games.
The board will make final decision as to this largesse at the time when
next year's budget is under scrutiny.
Free admittance to virtually every varsity contest would lift a con
siderable financial burden from the average student, inasmuch as the
average student is a faithful athletics fan. Naught but commendation for
the proposal now before the board can be voiced by this organ of opinion,
favoring, as it does, free tickets to games and campus dances and six-cent
bottles of milk at the Union store.
