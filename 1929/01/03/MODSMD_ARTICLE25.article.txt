A homily upon Clothes and the Alan emerges from the typewriter of
an editorial writer on the Illinois Daily lllini:
Well Dressed lllini
Men of the University arc reckoned among the elite of the well dressed
college boys, according to the statement of a clothier's representative who
spends his time seeking style hints among America's leading universities,
lllini set new styles with satisfying frequency, according to this observer,
and they are at all times dressed in the quintessence of collegiate fashion.
hven if the University of Illinois is primarily an educational institution,
wc presume wc should feel immensely flattered by the encomiums heaped on
lllini heads—or on lllini coats and trousers—by one who should know. We
presume it is now in order to perform the usual contortion involved in pat
ting ourselves on the back. But although being stylishly dressed is all well
enough, and although most Illinois men probably merit that appellation, we
are not so flattered as wc might be. The dearth of creative work on the
campus in student fiction, good poetry, student drama, is so appallingly
noticeable that we can muster only a lugubrious smile at compliments upon
our outer trappings.
Clothes—so runs the old adage -do not make the man. And clothes, we
might add, come a tremendously long way from making the student.
