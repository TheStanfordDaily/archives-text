NEW FIELDS TO CONQUER
Go West, young man! With this
brave phrase ringing in his ears the
young ambitions of the eighties and
the nineties forged toward the set
ting sun, his place therein to make.
Buckaroos, aborigines, painted ladies,
and badmen of Diamond Dick fame
peopled that vast wilderness. But
there was gold, lands, forests, un
bounded resources and unbounded op
portunity, and these were the real
things he sought.
Horace Greeley of the New York
Tribune flung out that phrase and
thereby set sail a thousand argosies
into the untamed West. The move
ment was inevitable despite Greeley;
he merely indicatd its inevitability
and advised the young hopefuls.

A new day and a new phrase is
caught up on the winds of ambition.
Go South, young man! Go south to
the pampas, the Andes, the Matto

Grosso, the growing cities of silver,
the land of rich unmined ores, virgin
forests, vast lands, and immeasurable
opportunity, the land bounded by the
Atlantic and the Pacific and south of
our own country.
That the President-elect should visit
there is obvious evidence of its in
creasing importance in our national
life. And in the words of Karl A.
Bickel, '07, president of the United
Press Associations, a newspaper man
of the new day, South America must
become the bread-basket of the United
Slates. Increased industrialism and
ever-growing population will make of
us manufacturers, not farmers nor
producers of raw product. We must
look to the Southland for these things.

Hei'e then is a new field to con
quer. A field for the engineer, the
business executive, the journalist, the
scientist; for the specialist in every
line. —Calvin D. Wood.
