"The Trail of Mary Dugan"—Co
lumbia.
Bayard Veiller's melodrama of New
York life is one of the tensest, most
engrossing plays of recent years. Mary
Dugan, a Follies beauty, is accused of
the murder of lier lover, a prominent
banker. The entire action of the play
takes place in the courtroom where her
trial is conducted. The curtain is up
when one enters the theater, and it is
not lowered until the guilt of Mary Du
gan is finally settled, ten seconds before
the last line is spoken!
Stanford is particularly interested in
the present production of this show, be
cause the title role of Mary Dugan is
being played by a Stanford graduate,
Florence Mason, Kappa Alpha Theta.
Miss Mason was outstanding in campus
productions. For the past few years she
has been leading lady to some of the
biggest Broadway stars. She handles her
dramatic moments on the witness'stand
during her "trial" so well that we are
proud to say she is a product of the
University.
There are many distinctive character
roles in "The Trial of Mary Dugan,"
and the present company is chosen to
perfection. Charlotte Walker, the actress
with the lovely voice, is the widow of
the murdered man. Miss Walker is very
good in this part, but she is deserving
of better ones—such as she had in "The
Royal Family" and "Fallen Angels."

"The Trial of Mary Dugan" is good
mystery—an evenings entertainment real
ly worth a trip to the city. It has
achieved long run records in New York
and London, and a talking picture ver
sion is now being made with Norma
Shearer in the role Florence Mason por
trays here.
