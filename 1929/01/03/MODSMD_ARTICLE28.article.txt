# ALL KNEELING
## (Harper and Brother's, New York and London, 1928) 
### Anne Parrish 
Christabel Caine. The name does her
ample justice. Like it she is beautiful,
extravagant, and insipid.
1 wonder if men really do fall in love
with creatures like this heroine of Anne
Parrish's latest novel. It hardly seems
reasonable. She is exquisitely beautiful,
of course, but can even beauty compen
sate for a mind responsible for this:
"To sink slowly, slowly, down to the
trees of white and rose-red coral massed
with bubbles, to the sprays of pearl, to
drift and turn until my bones were white
and delicate, covered with small rose
pink shells and silver bubbles, drifting
and turning forever in that still depth of
peace ?
The title of the book is deceptive. ' It
leads one to expect a gorgeously fas
cinating woman, who has the world of

men at her feet worshiping her beauty
and charm. So the reader finds it hard
to adjust himself to a foolish, egotisti
cal, sentimental woman, who feels she is
endowed with the divine creative spark,
and endears herself to silly romantic old
spinisters by writing endless quantities
of slush.
As a character, she is artistically well
done. Yet the trouble is that almost
exactly the same sort of thing was done
a year before by Booth Tarkington and
his Claire Ambler; so if you have read
the latter you will probably find most of
All Kneeling a rather tiresome repiti
tion. Both give a devastatingly unflatter
ing revelation of the mental processes
and emotional life of a spoiled and selfish
girl. It becomes really painful to read
All Kneeling through, for each page
makes Christabel Caine appear a little
more ridiculous. Claire Ambler at least
had her moments of honesty, but Chris
tabel never wakes up. Her conceit and
self absorbtion is so complete, that she
accepts her own perfection without the
slightest question. The book is diverting
if taken in small doses. Otherwise it is
more than a little tedious.

to adjust himself to a foolish, egotisti
cal, sentimental woman, who feels she is
endowed with the divine creative spark,
and endears herself to silly romantic old
spinisters by writing endless quantities
of slush.
As a character, she is artistically well
done. Yet the trouble is that almost
exactly the same sort of thing was done
a year before by Booth Tarkington and
his Claire Ambler; so if you have read
the latter you will probably find most of
All Kneeling a rather tiresome repiti
tion. Both give a devastatingly unflatter
ing revelation of the mental processes
and emotional life of a spoiled and selfish
girl. It becomes really painful to read
All Kneeling through, for each page
makes Christabel Caine appear a little
more ridiculous. Claire Ambler at least
had her moments of honesty, but Chris
tabel never wakes up. Her conceit and
self absorbtion is so complete, that she
accepts her own perfection without the
slightest question. The book is diverting
if taken in small doses. Otherwise it is
more than a little tedious.
