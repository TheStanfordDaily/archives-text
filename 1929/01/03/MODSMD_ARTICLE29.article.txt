# THE 						WOMEN AT THE PUMP
## 
### Knute Hamsun 
(New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928)
Translated from the Norwegian by
Arthur G. Chater, Knut Hamsun's latest
book is interesting, hut not altogether
pleasant. He applies his lucid, realistic
style indiscriminately to subjects which
English writers usually avoid as being,
not potentially immoral, but unesthetic.
The story is about the simple folk of
a small Norwegian coast town. The title.
Women at the Pump, is symbolic of
gossip. The theme is the appearance of
brown-eyed children in certain blue-eyed
families, particularly that of Oliver An
derson, a rather simple-minded, crippled
sailor who is proud of his brown-eyed
children "with the family eyes" and
suspicious of his two blue-eyed daugh
ters. The gossip of the women around
the pump, the town doctor's intelligent
observation, and Oliver's own blundering
investigations, eventually solve the mys
tery of the brown eyes.
Knut Hamsun is a skillful story
weaver—lie won the Noble prize in 1920
—but his strongest point is unquestion
ably his characters. They are individual
and convincing, both externally, and in
their thinking. Knut Hamsun has one
trait—he never lets his reader despise
people, though lie allows him to be
amused at the stupid, and animal-like
way they think and act. There is al
ways a sympathetic deftness in present
ing motives and an almost fatalistic ac
ceptance of men, as limited beings, that
prevents this.
