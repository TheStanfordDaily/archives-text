# X-RAY SPECTRUM MAY REVEAL NEW ATOM STRUCTURE
## 
### 
ITHACA, N.Y., Jan. 2. (/P)—-An- j
nouncement is made at Cornell Uni
versity of results obtained from study
of X rays that rnveal the possibility
of new knowledge of the structure of
atoms.
Although atoms, the smallest units
of the chemical elements such as oxy
gcu, gold, and silver, never have been i
seen, belief in their existence is sup- I
ported by a vast amount of evidence ;
from physics, chemistry, and astron
omy. The Cornell research is one of
many excursions into this field, and
is producing additional data in sup- |
port of atomic theories.
Dr. F. K. Richtmyer, professor of |
physics, one of the authorities on
X-rays, working under an August
Hecksher grant, is studying the "satel
lite" lines in the X-ray spectrum.
Spectroscope Used
This work may he visualized by
comparing it with a photograph of
the spectrum of visible light as made
by a spectroscope, an instrument
which acts upon a beam of light in
much the same way as raindrops act j
upon the sun's rays in producing a I
rainbow. Such prints, usually called
spectograms, frequently contain sharp,
transverse lines which reveal the kind
of substance from which the light
emanated.
Although X-rays are invisible, X-ray
spectograms can be made by suitable
apparatus and such spectograms show
lines analogous to those found in the
visible spectrum. These X-ray spec
trum lines have been known for many
years. According to current atomic
theory they originate as a result of
the falling or "jumping" of electrons
from the outside of atoms toward the
inside.
New Lines Found
The "satellites" which the Cornell
physicist is investigating are very
faint lines lying close to the more in
tense/X-ray lines. As a result of a
careful study Professor Richtmyer
has found many new satellite lines
and in a recent paper before the Na
tional Academy of Sciences, has sug
gested "the possibility—to be tested
hu further experiments—that the
aatellites may be due to two-electron
jumps within the atom."
If correct, this means that, under
certain conditions, two electrons, in
stead of one, may simultaneously
■"jump" toward the center of the atom
and send out an X-ray. A further
study of this important field seems
likely to add valuable data with re
gard to the structure and behavior of
atoms.
