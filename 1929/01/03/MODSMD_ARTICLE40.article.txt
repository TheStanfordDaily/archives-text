# Cops Cannot Lecture? Irish Fail In Adoption Of National Language
## 
### 
DUBLIN, Jan. 2. (/P)— For three
years every effort has been made to
give Ireland a national language—
Irish.
It has been taught in the schools.
It has been lettered on windows. It
stands above English on telegraph
forms and government forms. It has
been lectured in and spoken in from
the pulpit.
But today Ireland is as much Eng
lish in language—with, of course, the
slight coloring of Irish brogue—as it
was long before the Irish Free State
came into existence.
Business is conducted in English.
Social life goes on in English. The
church has kept to English. Telegrams
and government forms, though Irish
is printed upon them, deliver their
messages in English.
In only a few isolated sections of
the rugged southwestern part of Ire
land, chiefly County Kerry, is Irish
the native language, and this is so not
as a result of the campaign of the
Irish Free State, but because the in
habitants of those districts inherited
their language from father and grand
father.
Children regard Irish as they would
Latin and Greek, more as a mental
exercise than a living tongue in which
to ask for their bread and butter.
