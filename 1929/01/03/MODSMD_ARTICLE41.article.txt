# ELECTRICITY PURIFIES MILK OF TUBERCULOSIS
## 
### 
RICHMOND, Va., Jan. 2. (/P)â€”An
electrical method of ridding milk of
tuberculosis infection was described
to the American Society of Bacteri
ologists here today.
Raw and pasteurized milk heavily
infected with human and bovine tu
berculosis was subjected to heating
produced by pumping milk between
two electrodes. This produced tem
peratures of 150, 155, and 100 degrees
Fahrenheit.
Tests on guinea pigs revealed no
evidence of tuberculosis front milk of
155 degrees or higher, but from 150
degree milk some symptoms devel
oped. The report was made by C. M.
Carpenter, New York State Veterin
ary College, Cornell University.
