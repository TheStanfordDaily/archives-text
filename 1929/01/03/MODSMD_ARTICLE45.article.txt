STAMFORD, Conn., Jan. 2. (IP) â€”
What is the money-value of a tree?
Dr. E. P. Felt of the Bartlett Re
search Laboratories here, says that
refusal to part with a tree for $10,000
is not unusual, and that he knows of
50 fair-sized elms that sold for $5,000
each.

He estimates the trees for which
the town of Greenwich, Conn., is cele
brated at "not less than one-fourth
the town's assessed valuation," which
would put their figure at about $25,-
000,000. Mr. Felt says that from his
point of view the value ought to rate
at $50,000,000.
