# PLANTS DESTROYED BY SNEEZING FUNGI
## Eastern Scientist Finds Certain Flowers Suffer From Colds, Other Epidemics' Same as Bipeds 
### 
ITHACA, N.Y., Jan. 2 (^P). —Sneezing
and the ills that it causes have their
counterparts in the world of flowers and
plants.
The organisms that almost literally
sneeze arc described by H. H. Whetzel,
professor of plant pathology of the New
York State Agricultural College of Cor
nell University, who is working under an
August Heckscher grant.
They are cup-shaped seed holders of
various destructive fungi. The cups are
filled with tiny pods, each containing
eight seeds. At the bottom of each pod
hag is a charge of starch, that ferments
and explodes, blowing the seeds an inch
or more into the air.
Photographs Sneeze
Whetzel has a photograph of a sneez
ing period by a mass of such cups, which
shows billions of seeds swirling like a
dust cloud. They are microscopical,
floating in the air to light on plants and
take root there.
The effects on plants are described by
Professor Whetzel as similar to colds.

Each plant has its own types of colds
and plenty of them, which do not attack
other plants, even in the same garden.
Three walls in his office are lined to
the ceiling with shelves bearing glass
tubes, each containing a different live
fungus. • It requires three month' work
each year by one person to replenish the
fungus food ii) these tubes and record
the growth. A card index of the fungus
pests tills solidly a three-foot drawer.
To Aid Posterity
Professor Whetzel believes that new
processes for utilizing growing plants
will become increasingly common. His
purpose is to have ready a compendium
that will enable future generations to go
into quantity raising of any useful plant,
without first having to discover how to
keep it healthy.
He has shown that dead spots that ap
pear in geranium flowers are not due to
age, but to some of the plant "colds." He
has discovered nearly forty new species
of these plant fungus enemies. Peonies,
lilies of the valley, roses, onions—all are
among the green proteges he has helped.
