# SCIENTISTS ANNOUNCE DISCOVERY OF SERUM TO PREVENT YELLOW FEVER
## 
### 
I PARIS, Jan. 2 (/P). —An announce-,
ment which declares they have discov- j
ered a serum that both prevents and ;
cures yellow fever lias been made to
the Academy of Medicine by two phy- |
sicians of the Pasteur Institute.
The discoverers are Prof. Auguste ;
j Pettit and Dr. Georges Stefanopoulo, a
I Greek physician.
Pettit summed up the results of his
experiments in four points. He said
the new serum has no unfavorable ef
fect ; it neutralizes in test tubes the virus j
of yellow fever; it protects the Asiatic j
I monkey Macacus Rhesus—very suscepti- j
i ble to yellow fever—against the disease; I
i and it prevents yellow fever from de- j
J claring itself in this monkey from one '
j to three days after injection of virus.
Monkeys Used
The physicians took these experiments j
tin monkeys as conclusive since yellow •
fever in the monkey not only resembles j
that malady in man but is still more
severe. Nearly all monkeys inoculated i
die, but the mortality for human beings j
in Africa is around 70 per cent.
Pettit used both African monkeys and |
a horse to prepare his serum. After four j
or five injections of an emulsion of the
| virulent liver of a monkey dead of yel
low fever, the serum of these African
monkeys "acquires marked neutralizing
and immunizing properties."
Twelve small Asiatic monkeys were
1 tested by Pettit and Stefanopoulo to j
j make sure that the serum had preventive j
and curative effects.
Two monkeys served to test the viru
lence of the yellow fever inoculation.
One died the sixth day of yellow fever,
the other got well after a severe attack.
None of the other ten experimented
upon was infected with yellow fever. All
of them resisted another inoculation of
virus given two weeks after the first in
oculation.
Harvard Man Aids
Pettit worked in the beginning with

congealed yellow fever virus put at his
disposition by Professor Andrew Watson
Sellards of Harvard University, to
whom Pettit paid a warm tribute for his
"shining example of scientific spirit and
humanitarian solidarity."
This was most important, since it is
no longer possible for scientists to work
in Africa under the conditions which
killed Adrian Stokes, Young, and H. No
guchi. The inoculation of monkeys there
caused a panic after these three men fell
victim to their own experiments and the
local governments no longer allow the
inoculation of large groups of monkeys.
Congeals Virus
It remained for Sellards to devise the
ingenious method of congealing the vi
rus, enabling scientists far from centers
of yellow fever to study it.
Pettit and Stefanopoulo also discov
ered a vaccine for yellow fever which
they were experimenting with when Pro
fessor Hiiulle announced discovery of a
successful vaccine. According to proced
ure among scientists priority belonged to
Hindle who announced his discovery
fourteen clays before Pettit and Stefano
poulo.
Pettit said that he has definitely dis
proved the theory that spirochetes are the
microbes of yellow fever, which was held
by many scientists in accord with the
Rockefeller Foundation scientist, No
guchi. Pettit thinks that students must
return to the conception of an invisible,
filtering germ.

microbes of yellow fever, which was held
by many scientists in accord with the

return to the conception of an invisible,
filtering germ.
I PARIS, Jan. 2 (/P). —An announce-,
ment which declares they have discov- j
ered a serum that both prevents and ;
cures yellow fever lias been made to
the Academy of Medicine by two phy- |
sicians of the Pasteur Institute.
The discoverers are Prof. Auguste ;
j Pettit and Dr. Georges Stefanopoulo, a
I Greek physician.
Pettit summed up the results of his
experiments in four points. He said
the new serum has no unfavorable ef
fect ; it neutralizes in test tubes the virus j
of yellow fever; it protects the Asiatic j
I monkey Macacus Rhesus—very suscepti- j
i ble to yellow fever—against the disease; I
i and it prevents yellow fever from de- j
J claring itself in this monkey from one '
j to three days after injection of virus.
Monkeys Used
The physicians took these experiments j
tin monkeys as conclusive since yellow •
fever in the monkey not only resembles j
that malady in man but is still more
severe. Nearly all monkeys inoculated i
die, but the mortality for human beings j
in Africa is around 70 per cent.
Pettit used both African monkeys and |
a horse to prepare his serum. After four j
or five injections of an emulsion of the
| virulent liver of a monkey dead of yel
low fever, the serum of these African
monkeys "acquires marked neutralizing
and immunizing properties."
Twelve small Asiatic monkeys were
1 tested by Pettit and Stefanopoulo to j
j make sure that the serum had preventive j
and curative effects.
Two monkeys served to test the viru
lence of the yellow fever inoculation.
One died the sixth day of yellow fever,
the other got well after a severe attack.
None of the other ten experimented
upon was infected with yellow fever. All
of them resisted another inoculation of
virus given two weeks after the first in
oculation.
Harvard Man Aids
Pettit worked in the beginning with

congealed yellow fever virus put at his
disposition by Professor Andrew Watson
Sellards of Harvard University, to
whom Pettit paid a warm tribute for his
"shining example of scientific spirit and
humanitarian solidarity."
This was most important, since it is
no longer possible for scientists to work
in Africa under the conditions which
killed Adrian Stokes, Young, and H. No
guchi. The inoculation of monkeys there
caused a panic after these three men fell
victim to their own experiments and the
local governments no longer allow the
inoculation of large groups of monkeys.
Congeals Virus
It remained for Sellards to devise the
ingenious method of congealing the vi
rus, enabling scientists far from centers
of yellow fever to study it.
Pettit and Stefanopoulo also discov
ered a vaccine for yellow fever which
they were experimenting with when Pro
fessor Hiiulle announced discovery of a
successful vaccine. According to proced
ure among scientists priority belonged to
Hindle who announced his discovery
fourteen clays before Pettit and Stefano
poulo.
Pettit said that he has definitely dis
proved the theory that spirochetes are the
microbes of yellow fever, which was held
by many scientists in accord with the
Rockefeller Foundation scientist, No
guchi. Pettit thinks that students must
return to the conception of an invisible,
