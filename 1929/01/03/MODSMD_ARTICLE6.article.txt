Delivering the first general address
;in connection with the eighty-fifth
meeting of the American Association
j for the Advancement of Science in
! New York City, Dr. Bailey Willis,
I head of the Geology Department, ad
' vanced the theory that continents
are formed by the eruption of enor
' rnous subterranean "blisters" several
hundred miles across and from ten to
[ twenty miles deep. The Association
! was officially called to order Decem
! her 27 and was concluded last night.
Dr. Willis, retiring president of the
Geological Society of America, de
j scribed the formation of these large
j bodies of melted rock, miles below
the earth's surface, which he calls
"blisters." lie also described the man
ner in which these "blisters" eventu
ally break through, flatten out, and
form cordilleras or continents. This
was contained in his address before
' the gathering on "The Origin and
Development of Continents" at the
Amercan Museum of Natural History.
"A blister spreading beneath the
j earth's skin by melting may grow sev
eral hundred miles across and be ten
jto twenty miles deep. During the
growing stage this would be tightly
enclosed, but we cannot imagine that
i the blister could continue to grow in-
I d» finitely without breaking," says Dr.
