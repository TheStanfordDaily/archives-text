NILL, !• ranee, Jan. 1 (/P). —l-rank Jay
Gould's new $5,000,000 casino may be
come a white marble elephant on his
hands. The gala opening, widely adver
tised for January 1, was called off at the
last moment because the French govern
ment had not issued a license that would
allow the little horses to run, and play at
the baccarat and other tables to proceed.
City leaders fear that failure to open
the casino, with the resultant heavy loss
to its builder, might create unwillingness
among other foreign capitalists to invest
their money in France.
