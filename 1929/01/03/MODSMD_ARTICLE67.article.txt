## OUT-HYLANDING HYLAND 
### 
Roy Riegels out-Hylanded Hvland in
the April 1 classic. The California cap
tain-clect certainly established a reputa
tation which will be hard for him to live
down. In the 1920 Stan ford-Alabama
game, Rampant Richard eased back
twenty yards, circled one of his own goal
posts, and then advanced thirty—a feat
which up until the first of this year Hy
land had not succeeded in living down.
It gives one pause now to think of the
consequences of this uncatalogued play
of Riegels'. So unlike California, too—
California, which is noted for its smooth,
heads-up football and its quiet, unsung,
uphill battles against big odds and biased
officials.
Throughout the season, Cali
fornia has seemed like a bridge
player trying to make a four bid
with simple honors against him.
The Bears turned the trick and
turned it nobly against U.S.C.
and Stanford. But the California
style of play is not the proper
style for the winning of foot
ball games; its chief effective
ness is in keeping the opposition
from winning.
Perhaps that is about as mean as we
ought to be toward California and poor
Captain Riegels. When all is said and
done, the only game to which Stanford
can point with any pride is the Army
game, and that is fast fading into the
utter oblivion which is winter quarter.
Only a few derbies serve to remind us
of that gTeat triumph.
Why not adopt the derby as the sym
bol of victory? Wear derbies until Army
beats us. It is high time iron hats and
paper money were penetrating this rude
region, anyhow. The victory derby, it
seems to us, would be inexpressibly
hoity-toity. We plead for its adoption.

The Daily congratulates Captain-elect
Mush Muller, who was chosen for the
leadership of the 1929 football team at
the end of last- quarter. At the same
time, it congratulates, perhaps even more
heartily, Bob Sims, who was voted the
Glenn S. Warner award for being the
player most valuable to the team.

Roy Riegels out-Hylanded Hvland in
the April 1 classic. The California cap
tain-clect certainly established a reputa
tation which will be hard for him to live
down. In the 1920 Stan ford-Alabama
game, Rampant Richard eased back
twenty yards, circled one of his own goal
posts, and then advanced thirty—a feat
which up until the first of this year Hy
land had not succeeded in living down.
It gives one pause now to think of the
consequences of this uncatalogued play
of Riegels'. So unlike California, too—
California, which is noted for its smooth,
heads-up football and its quiet, unsung,
uphill battles against big odds and biased
officials.
Throughout the season, Cali
fornia has seemed like a bridge
player trying to make a four bid
with simple honors against him.
The Bears turned the trick and
turned it nobly against U.S.C.
and Stanford. But the California
style of play is not the proper
style for the winning of foot
ball games; its chief effective
ness is in keeping the opposition
from winning.
Perhaps that is about as mean as we
ought to be toward California and poor
Captain Riegels. When all is said and
done, the only game to which Stanford
can point with any pride is the Army
game, and that is fast fading into the
utter oblivion which is winter quarter.
Only a few derbies serve to remind us
of that gTeat triumph.
Why not adopt the derby as the sym
bol of victory? Wear derbies until Army
beats us. It is high time iron hats and
paper money were penetrating this rude
region, anyhow. The victory derby, it
seems to us, would be inexpressibly
hoity-toity. We plead for its adoption.

The Daily congratulates Captain-elect
Mush Muller, who was chosen for the
leadership of the 1929 football team at
the end of last- quarter. At the same
time, it congratulates, perhaps even more
heartily, Bob Sims, who was voted the
Glenn S. Warner award for being the
player most valuable to the team.
