# SPORTS OF 1929
## A 						Popular Veteran 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The Sleepless Carnival has hit New
York again, and Madison Square Gar
den is bulging with screeching, yelling
maniacs every night between the
hours of 11 P.M. and 3 A.M. Why
do otherwise respectable people lose
their self-control and voices—and
often their overcoats —just because a
bunch of boys and bikes are riding
'round and 'round a wooden saucer,
never getting any place, and with the
teams so hand-picked that it is no
contest at all as far as the chances
of morS than half the competitors are
concerned?
Why? Well, spills and jams and
thrills and the chance to meet old
friends and sit up all night, and
smoke and drink and argue — and
Maurice Brocco! Yes, Maurice Brocco
is one reason why an otherwise nor
mal man or woman will sit on a hard
seat in a smoke-filled arena watching
a mob of foreigners ride bicycles
around an endless pine track. The
fans have always liked Brocco, and
always will. He is old and battle
scarred and loves to jam and never
seems to get tired, and his name just
naturally adapts itself to a spontane
ous long-drawn-out yell of encourage
ment. When things get dull, some
body starts yelling Broccooooo," and
others take it up. Brocco is inspired

i body is pop-eyed with excitement,
i Brocco was born at Fismes, France,
jof Italian parentage, on January 28,
I 1885, and served in the French army

ished second four times, and third
j four times. He knows his vegetables,
does Mr. Brocco.
