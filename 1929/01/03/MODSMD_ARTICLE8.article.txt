# BABE CAGE TEAM BEGINS WORKOUT FOR PRACTICE TILT
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball team
met yesterday afternoon in their first
real practice to prepare to meet the
College of the Pacific freshmen to
morrow evening. Difficulties in their
schedule made it impossible for the
1932 men to get together as a team
during the fall quarter, so they will
go into their first game with only two
days of practice as a team.
The Pacific freshmen will invade
Stanford sporting a center who meas
ures six and a half feet tall, and the
whole team is reported to be big.

They have played several games, and
will have some advantage over the
Stanford freshmen in experience.
At last night's practice Coach "Rab
bit" liradshaw found that he had a
lot of good material. At the forward
positions, Tom Lambert, James Shra-
I der, and Alvin Ray appear at present
Ito be the best of the lot. Lambert,
who is from Tulsa, Oklahoma, played
; freshman football. Shrader was an,
all-city forward in Los Angeles last
year. Ray played with the San Mateo
lightweight team and is one of the
! cleverest players and best shots on
j Bradshaw's squad.
William Doub, of Berkeley, is the
| leading candidate for center, and
! Lyman Baker, from Watsonville, and
| Rudie Rintala, from San Francisco,
j will probably be seen at the guard
| positions. Both played freshman foot-
I ball.
Next Tuesday evening the freshmen
i will play the St. Mary's frosh.
