ANNOUNCEMENT
Faculty members and students will be pleased to hear of our
new monthly board rate plan. Three meals per day, and
regular chicken dinner on Sunday, served at remarkable
saving.
Those who eat in town may make an appreciable cut in their
expenses and at the same time eat in a clean, homelike at
mosphere. Table or counter service will be furnished. Step
in and ask about this low-rate plan.
