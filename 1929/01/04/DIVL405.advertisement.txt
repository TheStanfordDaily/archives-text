Sleeping Porch Fashions
insist on comfort in a quaint
grandmotherly way
Brief little crepe-de-Chine affairs are all very well for pa jama parties
but when it comes to the serious business of sleeping out in the great
open spaces style becomes a very secondary consideration and comfort
a matter of supreme importance.
Flannelette Pajamas offer a surprising number of good looking
patterns $2.95
Flannelette Gowns keep yon toasty warm in their ample folds $2.95
Striped Flannel Robes are mannishly tailored for out-of-door
co-eds $8.95
Padded Silk Robes iti pastels or gayer shades interlined with real
lambs' wool $8.95
