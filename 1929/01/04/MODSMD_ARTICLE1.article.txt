# CARDS TO MEET PACIFIC QUINTET ON LOCAL COURT
## Husky Hunt's Charges Start 29 Season at 8 O'Clock; '32 in Preliminary Game 
### ANSON REEDER 
Following a week of intense off en-1
Rive drill, Coach Husky Hunt's Stan- ]
ford varsity basketball team is pre-;
pared to swing into action against I
the strong College of Pacific five in j
the first contest of the new year to- |
night. The varsity game will begin at j
8 o'clock following a preliminary tilt i
between Stanford and College of Pa- I
cific freshmen.
Neither team has shown anything
particularly impressive to date, but
the Cards, because of their victory
over the Y.M.I, team, are conceded a
good chance to win. Several develop
ments during the past few days have
served to brighten the outlook for the
1929 season. Spud Lewis, varsity
guard of two years ago, reported for
practice yesterday, while Mike Rey- '
nolds, another guard, was released
from the hospital where he has been
recovering from an attack of the fiu.
The return of these two players will
bolster an already strong defense.
Tigers Fast
Coach Swede Righter, as in past
years, is expected to present a fast
quintet against the Cards. The Tigers'
style of play features a man to man 1
defense, and an offensive style simi
lar to that used by the famous Ore- 1
gon State teams.
Inexperience has been the visitors'
main handicap so far this season, but '
each contest has shown improved '
teamwork, so tonight's game should J
mark the first real test for the Tigers.
Heath, Tiger forward, is rated as
the big threat of the Stockton quin- '
tet, while Disbrow, center, and Coun
trymen at the other forward position
are consistent basketsliooters. The
guard positions are handled by two
gentlemen, Shuman and Russell by
name, who remain more or less a
mystery as far as ability is con
cerned. Their showing to date, how- j
ever, despite their inexperience, has
proven to Coach Righter that he has
made no mistake in giving them first
call. j
Split Reno Series
The Stanford cagers, on the other j
1-and, saw considerable action over |
the holidays. While the rest of the
•world was making merry the Card
quintet was taming the Nevada Wolf !
Pack and the San Francisco Y.M.I, j
team. Handicapped by a small court I
the Cards lost the first Nevada game j
by two points, only to return the fol
lowing evening and wallop the same j
aggregation by a lopsided score. The j
Y.M.I, contest was one of those nip- ,
and-tuck affairs which required an!
extra period to decide the outcome, j
Berg, Fawcett, and McCandless ;
have been the main strength on the |
offense, but as yet lack the teamwork
which comes only with more experi
ence together. Captain Rothert,
Trmpcke, and Reynolds have been
playing a consistent game at the
guard positions and may be depended
upon to handle that end of the play
consistently. If the Card offense func
tions as it is capable of functioning,
Stanford should win. On the other
hand, if they play erratically as they
have so far this season, the game
Should be a toss-up.
The probable line-up follows:
Stanford — College of Pacific —

Inexperience has been the visitors'

Heath, Tiger forward, is rated as

guard positions are handled by two
gentlemen, Shuman and Russell by

the holidays. While the rest of the
•world was making merry the Card
quintet was taming the Nevada Wolf !

team. Handicapped by a small court I
the Cards lost the first Nevada game j
by two points, only to return the fol
lowing evening and wallop the same j
aggregation by a lopsided score. The j
Y.M.I, contest was one of those nip- ,
and-tuck affairs which required an!
extra period to decide the outcome, j
Berg, Fawcett, and McCandless ;
have been the main strength on the |
offense, but as yet lack the teamwork
which comes only with more experi
ence together. Captain Rothert,
Trmpcke, and Reynolds have been
playing a consistent game at the
guard positions and may be depended
upon to handle that end of the play
consistently. If the Card offense func
tions as it is capable of functioning,
Stanford should win. On the other
hand, if they play erratically as they
have so far this season, the game
Should be a toss-up.

Following a week of intense off en-1
Rive drill, Coach Husky Hunt's Stan- ]
ford varsity basketball team is pre-;
pared to swing into action against I
the strong College of Pacific five in j
the first contest of the new year to- |
night. The varsity game will begin at j
8 o'clock following a preliminary tilt i
between Stanford and College of Pa- I
cific freshmen.
Neither team has shown anything
particularly impressive to date, but
the Cards, because of their victory
over the Y.M.I, team, are conceded a
good chance to win. Several develop
ments during the past few days have
served to brighten the outlook for the
1929 season. Spud Lewis, varsity
guard of two years ago, reported for
practice yesterday, while Mike Rey- '
nolds, another guard, was released

recovering from an attack of the fiu.
