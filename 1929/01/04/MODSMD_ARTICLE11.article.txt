# WYCKOFF FIGHTS DEATH FOLLOWING TONSIL OPERATION
## 
### 
GLENDALE, Jan. 3. (/P)â€”Frank
Wyckoff, the high school boy who
burned the cinders last year for a na
tional sprint championship, today lay
critically ill in a hospital here, kept
alive by blood transfusion frcra his
coach, Norman Hayhurst, and Dick
Ryan, another Glendale athlete.
Wyckoff, whose feat of beating
Charley Paddock in two races on the
same day in the Olympic trials, placed
the boy, then IS years old, on the pin
nacle of track success, underwent a
tonsil operation last month. A hemor
rhage was followed by two operations
in an effort to heal his throat, but it
was announced today that the young
athlete had not eaten in two weeks
and was too weak to talk.
Wyckoff skyrocketed to fame last
year when he beat all competition in
the American tryouts for the Olym
pics, and placed fifth in the 100-yard
dash in the finals in Holland. Coach
Hayhurst, who trained WyckofL at
Glendale High School and accompa
nied the youth abroad, said that he
would be so weak upon his recovery
that he could not enter competition
this spring.
