### 
CAIRO, Egypt, Jan. 3. (/P) — The
ancient Islamic university of El Az
har, the greatest in all the East,
where the 14,000 students pay no
fees and the professors get no pay,
is to be modernized.
Not with football teams, cheer
leaders, and campus flappers, but by
raising the standard of education,
and providing schools organized on
modern lines for the thousands of
students who gather from all the Mo
hammedan world. Instead of 14,000
students, as at present, the number
will be limited to 5,000.
Hitherto, old Azhar has been con
cerned chiefly with the teaching of
the Koran. Professors made their liv
ing by private teaching and by copy
ing manuscripts, students theirs by
the same methods or by reciting the
Koran.
To meet the demand for better
qualified judges in Moslem courts,
various reforms have been attempted,
but from time to time abandoned.
Now the objects of the university are
tc produce qualified teachers of Mo
hammedan theology, Mohammedan
law, and the Arabic language, and
men who can be trained as judges
and lawyers, also to provide mission
aries for Mohammedan countries.
