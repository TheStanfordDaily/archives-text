# KELLOGG TREATY, NAVAL BILL ARE PRINCIPAL ISSUES FACING SENATORS
## Appropriation Bills Occupy House, Providing Vehicle For Farm Debate 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. (/P) — A
treaty for world peace and a bill to
build more cruisers for the Navy
faced Senators who returned to Capi
tol Hill today after a Christmas re
cess, and when the day had ended
the Kellogg Treaty for renunciation
of war as a National Policy held the
floor —with the consent ol the Navy
advocates.
These two measures, both with Ad
ministration support, have the right
of-way in the Senate while the House
works on appropriation bills. The
supply bill presented today happened
to be the measure for the War De
partment, carrying $435,428,415 for
the civilian and military needs of
that branch of the national govern
ment. It provided, however, a vehicle
for a farm relief debate.
The Treaty-Cruiser argument occu
pied nearly all of the Senate's time,
although there was a brief flurry over
Prohibition when Senator Jones, of
Washington, offered a resolution for
an investigation of enforcement by its
friends. He drew a brief prodding
from Senator liruce, of Maryland, a
wet, after which the business at hand
was the introduction of the Cruiser
bill by Chairman Hale of the Naval
Committee, a speech by him in its
behalf, and the taking of the treaty.
Senator Borah, of Idaho, Chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee,
took over the task of guiding the
treaty through and he spoke for more
than two hours with little interrup
tion.
One legislative achievement of the
Senate was the passage of the appro
priation bill for the departments of
State, Justice, Commerce, and Labor.
It carried a total of $111,832,000, but
it now must go to conference because
the Senate changed some items in the
measure as it was passed by the
House.

Prohibition when Senator Jones, of
Washington, offered a resolution for
an investigation of enforcement by its
friends. He drew a brief prodding
from Senator liruce, of Maryland, a
wet, after which the business at hand
was the introduction of the Cruiser
bill by Chairman Hale of the Naval
Committee, a speech by him in its
behalf, and the taking of the treaty.
Senator Borah, of Idaho, Chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee,
took over the task of guiding the
treaty through and he spoke for more
than two hours with little interrup
tion.
One legislative achievement of the
Senate was the passage of the appro
priation bill for the departments of
State, Justice, Commerce, and Labor.
It carried a total of $111,832,000, but
it now must go to conference because
the Senate changed some items in the
measure as it was passed by the
House.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. (>P) — The
Smate was given an illustration of
the methods of its future presiding
officer today when Senator Curtis of
Kansas, the Vice-President-Elect, took
the chair in the absence of Vice-Presi
dent Dawes.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. (/P) — A
treaty for world peace and a bill to
build more cruisers for the Navy
faced Senators who returned to Capi
tol Hill today after a Christmas re
cess, and when the day had ended
the Kellogg Treaty for renunciation
of war as a National Policy held the
floor —with the consent ol the Navy
advocates.
These two measures, both with Ad
ministration support, have the right
of-way in the Senate while the House
works on appropriation bills. The
supply bill presented today happened
to be the measure for the War De
partment, carrying $435,428,415 for
the civilian and military needs of
that branch of the national govern
ment. It provided, however, a vehicle
for a farm relief debate.
The Treaty-Cruiser argument occu
pied nearly all of the Senate's time,
although there was a brief flurry over
Prohibition when Senator Jones, of
Washington, offered a resolution for
an investigation of enforcement by its
friends. He drew a brief prodding
from Senator liruce, of Maryland, a
