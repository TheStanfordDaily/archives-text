# Sprinkling "Shirtee Allee Samee Mouth" Brings $50 Fine For Chinese Laundry

### 
EVANSTON, 111., Jan. 3. (#>)—' The
most honorable Chinese custom of
! sprinkling shirts from the most hon
• orable mouth found itself rebuked to
j day by Evanston's most honorable
j law.
Mr. Joe Dong Dong, who favored
j the mouth method at Charlie Young's
1 laundry, was non-committal conceru
; ing the legal and sanitary aspects of
! the art when Judge Brightmire ques
i tioned him yesterday.
i "Sure, I sprinkle shirtee allee
samee mouth," he affirmed.
"That will be $10," said Judge
Brightmire.
"1 sprinkle shirtee allee samee like
my boss tell me to," explained Mr.
Joe Dong Dong.
"In which case," said the Court, "I
hereby fine your boss, Charlie Young,
■ $50."
It is cheaper, runs a very, very old
J Chinese proverb, to sprinkle shirts by
! mouth than to tell someone else to
do so; approximately $40 cheaper.
