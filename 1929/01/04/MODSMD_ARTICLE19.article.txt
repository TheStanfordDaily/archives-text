# FROSH CAGE TEAM CHOSEN FOR TONIGHT
## Bradshaw's Squad Prepared For Encounter With Pacific Yearlings 
### 
Line-up for this evening's frosh
basketball encounter against the Col
lege of the Pacific yearlings has been
announced by Coach "Rabbit" Brad
shaw. Jim Kelly, Los Angeles High
School star, will be left forward, and
Alvin Ray, a highly rated player from
San Mateo, will be his running mate
at right forward.
The center job will be held down
by Bill Doub, who has had consider
able experience at Berkeley. Rudie
Rintala will play guard, as will Lyman
Baker. If Rintala does as well at bas
ketball as he did at football, that
team will have at least one reliable
man at guard position.
"The Pacific men are a tall, heavy
aggregation," said Bradsliaw. "But as
they are rather slow, I think we have
a good chance against them. The
main handicap of the freshmen is the
fact that they have had no previous
experience in playing together."
