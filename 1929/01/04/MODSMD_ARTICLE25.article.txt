# FLETCHER MAY BE HOOVER'S CHOICE FOR CABINET JOB
## 
### 
ABOARD U.S.S. UTAH, En Route
to Hampton Roads, Jan. 3. (>P) â€”The
assistance rendered by Henry P.
Fletcher to Herbert Hoover on his
Latin-American goodwill tour prob
ably will result in the now ambassa
dor to Italy becoming one of the chief
advisers to the new President in for
eign affairs, particularly in Central
and South American relations.
While there has been some talk of
Mr. Fletcher for a cabinet position,
just what place he will have in the
new administration is for the Presi
dent-elect to decide and he is keeping
his own counsel. However, it is
known that he regards the ambassa
dor as one of the ablest of the diplo
matic career men and is highly
pleased with his work as a member
of the goodwill mission.
Since one of the major foreign poli
cies of Hoover's administration will
be the fostering of better relations
with other American republics, it is
expected that Mr. Fletcher's advice
and counsel will be called for fre
quently as he has a very wide circle
of friends among the governments of
the Latin-American republics.
