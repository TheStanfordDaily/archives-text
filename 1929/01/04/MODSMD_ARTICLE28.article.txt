# What Magazine For The College Student?
## 
### 
Magazines which express one's opinions are hard to find. College men
and women think with a liberal conservatism â€”their liberality coming
from a few "eye-opening" courses given them, and their conservatism
being a reflection of thought at home. Now, a liberalism which is a bit
conservative or a conservatism which is just liberal enough is rare in a
magazine, and consequently there are 110 magazines which students in
general swear by. The Atlantic, although one of the leading journals,
gets pretty dismal, the Saturday Evening Post is read widely for its ex
emplary advertising, the American Mercury is too erratic and Mencken
esque, and the Nation, a notable liberal sheet, is somehow unsound. Such
are the objections of ordinary student to some of the representative
magazines of the day.
The Nation would appear to be the most hopeful organ of liberal
thought to attract the college reader, yet according to a critic of it who
writes in its own columns, the Nation is not the nation but a small and
alien part of it, New York. "It emanates from New York not only physi
cally but mentally." That probably explains the perplexity of one who
thinks he is a liberal, but finds himself unable to agree with the liberal
Nation. New York is not the nation, but the Nation is New York;
therefore the Nation is not the nation. Quite simple and fundamental,
and if the Nation accepts its critic's judgment, it may step into the wait
ing place of interpreter of liberalism everywhere, gain a collegiate and a
wider intellectual following, and commence running the Saturday Eve
ning Post a race. The sooner that race commences, the more easily we
shall rest.
