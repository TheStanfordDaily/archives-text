Princeton has a pretty habit of sending out questionnaires and re
ceiving the most unexpected answers in the world. Questionnairing
groups at Princeton are continually making impertinent and unorthodox
replies. The Freshman Class, for example, must be composed of a strange
lot, for it has voted that it prefers a Phi Beta Kappa key to a major sport
letter, that it would rather go out with college girls than with those who
have not received a higher education, and that it does not favor com
panionate marriage.
These same remarkable freshmen listed their preferences for campus
activities as: first, the college daily; second, track; third, crew; fourth,
tennis; fifth, baseball; and sixth, football. Only 110 of the 300 who
answered smoke, whereas 170 of them drink.
Princeton seniors make much of a questionnaire which they fill out
at commencement time. They determine the wisest, the best looking, the
most likely to succeed, the best student, the most gifted, and other leaders
of their class. Results are quite widely published. The custom seems to
be intelligent as well as diverting; why does not the Senior Class ait
Stanford adopt a similar questionnaire to while away the dull hours of
the last of May? Surely one would prefer to be adjudged the most some
thing-or-other of his class than elected King of the Masque Ball, for
example. The idea of a questionnaire is one which President Richard
Holt of the Senior Class might well consider.
