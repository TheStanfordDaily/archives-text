# An "Other Half" Speaks

Herewith is an amusing poem presenting the defense of the much
maligned Xantippe, wife of Socrates. It is reprinted from What the
Colleges Are Doing. It originally appeared anonymously in the Bates
Alumnus.
Xantippe
If you had worked all day with river rushes and sand
Scrubbing the atrium
And cleaning between the tiles of the impluvium
And coaxing fresh air and sunshine through the compluvium
And then a mere man
In the name of Philosophy
Came in from the Agora
Without even wiping the mud from his sandals
And refused to eat his dinner while it was hot,
Perhaps you, too,
Would brighten the corner where you are
With a few scintillating remarks.
