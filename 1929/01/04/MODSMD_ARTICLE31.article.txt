NUGGET SEASON
Hist. Nugget season is at hand.
Burnish up the door-knob of dear old
Nu Kappa Nu. Drag out the old
trophies. Buy that new rug. Polish
apples with the cook. And let the
brothers and sisters get off the dime.
It's open season for Sally Campus;
as for Joe College his time is near.
The process of picking and being
picked in the interests of the local
tongs is an arduous one.
Amid the clatter of rushing, recol
lection comes to mind of that great
campus classic, Hall versus Row.
Rushing is its inception. They are all
freshmen now; later, they will re
turn sophomores with bawl-out ad
dresses classifying them Hall or Row.

Calm reigns. Then conies election j
day and the roar and rumble of the
old imbroglio reaches up from sub- j
terranean depths.
In the words of Don Marquis, what
the hell, what the hell? Suppose one- j
time friends are separated by the dis- i
lance of Hall and Row. Suppose one
man has chosen to be known as Bill
Blurp of Whoop Whata Whoop and |
the other Jack Nertz, 777 Insana
Hall. It doesn't change them. Why be- j
come enemies, even political?
Arrogating importance to wearing
Greek letters in brass and further 1
making a poltical issue of it is very
collegiate. And if one must be colle- [
giate, what the hell, what the hell?
—Calvin D. Wood.
