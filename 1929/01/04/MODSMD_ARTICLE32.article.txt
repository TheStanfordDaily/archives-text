NOW THAT SANTA CLAUS—
Has gone back to the North Pole
for another year; and the Baby 1929
has come to earth amid a carousing
welcome; we can once more settle
down in our Morris chair and peruse
books both good and bad.
Oh yes, two resolutions have been
scrolled by the reviewing department.
Number 1. —Readers of the Daily are
urged to criticize and differ with any
review appearing. If we pan a book
you like, write in and tell the editor;
if we praise a book you abominate,
drop a line and tell us why we're
wrong.
Resolution 2.—We would appreciate
having our attention called to any
new book which you feel is particu
larly worthy of review, and which
you think would be interesting to a
large number of readers.
ALL OF WHICH—
Is a sort of an introduction to the
fact that we have before us a whole
stock of books that have accumulated
over the holidays. Some of the books
look good, too.
Of importance is a new book by Al
bert Guerard, professor of General
Literature. The title is The Life and
Death of an Ideal. It deals with
France in the Classical Age, and is
published by Scribner's.
Another book on hand is the Stan
ford University Press publication
which came out about the first of
last month, The New Day—"The Cam
paign Speeches of Herbert Hoover."
Then we have two books with defi
nite motives. One is Between War

and Peace, by Florence Brewer Boeek
el, education director of the National
Council for Prevention of War. It is
called "A Handbook for Peace Work
ers," and is published by McMillan.
The other book is Birth Control Laws,
by Mary Ware Dennett, "the woman
who took the birth control problem
to Congress." Frederick H. Hitchcock
is the published of this comprehen- j
sive work on a vital subject in pres- [
ent-day society.

Knock Wood! Superstition Through j
the Ages. By Daniel Deerforth. (New-
York: $3).
Considering this altogether tricksy I
title, it would seem that Dr. Deerforth |
is out for a good old-fashioned lark.
But such is not the case.
After one has read interestedly a j
few pages that promise something in i
the way of a microscopic "Golden
Bough" it suddenly turns out that the
author has an anti-ecclesiastic ax to
grind. The book is an artlessly com
posed document to that end, contain
ing many samples of the Church's op
position to scientific progress.
The doctor unbends so far as to in- j
elude mention of that Dr. John Light
foot, of Cambridge, who declared man-!
kind was created October 23, 4004
8.C., at 9 o'clock in the morning. !
Needless to say, this meets with a
lirm denial from the author.
It is perfectly all right for an au
thor to grind an ecclesiastic ax, or |
any other kind of an ax, but why
try to fool the reader with a fancy
title? As P. T. Barnum said —etc., etc. j
—Clifford F. Weigle.
