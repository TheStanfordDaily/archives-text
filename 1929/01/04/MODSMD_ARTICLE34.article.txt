NEW YORK, Jan. 3. (/P)—William
Randolph Hearst, the publisher, who
yesterday announced a prize of $25,000
for the best plan to repeal the Eight- ;
eenth Amendment, today sent a tele
gram to W. C. Durant, who created a
$25,000 prize for the best method of
enforcing the amendment, saying that
"they were not so far apart as might
seem at first glance."
The telegram was in response to
one sent to the publisher by Mr. j
Durant in which he said he believed
great good would come out of a public j
discussion stimulated by the prize I
offer.
Mr. Hearst said he had been a cru- I
sader in the temperance movement
for more than 40 years but he did not '
believe prohibition was the intelli
gent and practicable way to promote
the cause. Criminal conditions created
by the dry law demanded a better
plan, he said.
