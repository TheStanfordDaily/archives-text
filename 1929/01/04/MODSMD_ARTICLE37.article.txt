# MUSICAL COMEDY IS VALHALLA OF POPULAR ACTRESS
## Charlotte Greenwood, Star of Warfield Play, Seeks Role For Personality 
### BEN MADDOX 
"She's taking a bath —getting some j
of the dirt from lier act off." Charlotte j
Gieenwood had just finished an hilari- |
ous skit, "Her Morning Bath," on the j
Warfield stage, and was taking a real !
one when I called. Her husband ex- !
plained that she usually got more :
soiled than cleaned in the process of i
play-acting a bath.
Finally the erstwhile star of "So j
Long Letty" and many other popular I
musical comedic.i emerged ready to j
"t>e cross-examined. Public or private !
baths—she's never safe from interrup
tion, it seems.
Miss Greenwood's chief claim to j
fame is the unique way in which she |
steps over whatever may be on the j
stage. She is tall and blonde and |
better-looking at close range. But not j
peppy, as one would expect. Very lan- :
guid when not facing her public.
"This is my first appearance in pic- j
ture houses," she said. "Since every- i
one goes to the movies nowadays, I |
want to play where the crowds are.
I want to get acquainted with the new
generation of theatregoers that pre- j
fers pictures to vaudeville.
"If I could only find a musical com- j
edy with a good part for me I'd be i
happy. Last year I starred in a New !
York revue, and 1 have a script for a |
new show under consideration now." >
Miss Greenwood's talents are so in-!
dividual that it is hard for her to get i
suitable roles. She can dance and sing J
in a way all her own —but the prob-1
lem of finding the right parts is a i
distressing one.
She played in one moving picture
last summer —"Baby Mine," a Karl;
Dane-George K. Arthur comedy. She j
Pked the film work very much and !
would like another chance at picture" j
The talkies may lure her to th>; |
screen again, for she is equipped with
an A1 Jolson personality.

fame is the unique way in which she |
steps over whatever may be on the j
stage. She is tall and blonde and |
better-looking at close range. But not j
peppy, as one would expect. Very lan- :
guid when not facing her public.
"This is my first appearance in pic- j
ture houses," she said. "Since every- i
one goes to the movies nowadays, I |
want to play where the crowds are.
I want to get acquainted with the new
generation of theatregoers that pre- j
fers pictures to vaudeville.
"If I could only find a musical com- j
edy with a good part for me I'd be i
happy. Last year I starred in a New !
York revue, and 1 have a script for a |
new show under consideration now." >
Miss Greenwood's talents are so in-!
dividual that it is hard for her to get i
suitable roles. She can dance and sing J
in a way all her own —but the prob-1
lem of finding the right parts is a i
distressing one.
She played in one moving picture
last summer —"Baby Mine," a Karl;
Dane-George K. Arthur comedy. She j
Pked the film work very much and !
would like another chance at picture" j
The talkies may lure her to th>; |
screen again, for she is equipped with
an A1 Jolson personality.
"She's taking a bath —getting some j
of the dirt from lier act off." Charlotte j
Gieenwood had just finished an hilari- |
ous skit, "Her Morning Bath," on the j
Warfield stage, and was taking a real !
one when I called. Her husband ex- !
plained that she usually got more :
soiled than cleaned in the process of i
play-acting a bath.
Finally the erstwhile star of "So j
Long Letty" and many other popular I
musical comedic.i emerged ready to j
"t>e cross-examined. Public or private !
baths—she's never safe from interrup
tion, it seems.
