# LAWYERS WANT TO RUSH AHEAD PARIS DIVORCES
## 
### 
PARIS, Jan. 3. (/P) â€”American de
mand for French divorces has ex
ceeded the supply so far that two
years are required for delivery.
Under the French government's
policy of strict curtailment the di
vorce machinery of the courts has
been slowed down to a point requir
ing more patience than most divorce
seekers are able to muster.
The result lias been such conges
tion on the divorce calendar of the
Palace of Justice that the Paris bar
is complaining. French divorces are
dragging along as slow as snails and
blocking other cases.
Two years for a Paris divorce from
demand to receipt is the average time
estimated by lawyers.
The Paris bar favors a return to
former procedure which finished oft
cases in IS months at latest.
What lawyers are asking for spe
cifically is the return of the "divorce
by mutual consent." Under this sys
tem, the judge received couples seek
ing divorce in his office before court
opened. These cases were not in
scribd on the court register and the
lawyers limited their eloquence to
brief remarks.
The method was expeditious. Most
lawyers feel that listing all divorce
cases on the court register is like
throwing a monkey-wrench into the
already slow-moving wheels of jus
tice.
Postponement of cases scheduled
for trial should be made more diffi
cult, it is felt.
