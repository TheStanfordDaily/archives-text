SANTA BARBARA, Jan. 3. (/p)â€”
I One may be too kind to animals, hu- |
j mane officers of Santa Barbara ruled.
The result of the ruling was that a

woman here who shared her bunga
low with her two horses, was cum
I pelled to turn them out to grass. Thi
horses had lace curtains on their
stalls and interior decorations, but
the humane officers held they needed
fresh air and exercise.
