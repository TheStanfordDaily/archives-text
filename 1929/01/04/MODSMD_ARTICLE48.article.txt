# TEMPLETON HURLS LIE AT ACCUSER; "NEVER LEFT CHAIR" CLAIMS COACH
## 
### 
Boyd Comstock, track coach at Los |
Angeles Athletic Club, related an in- \
teresting story about "Dink" Temple- '
ton, Stanford mentor, in a recent is- :
sue of the "Mercury," the southern
club's publication.
A group of coaches and a few atli- j
letes were sitting in the officials' !
room in the Harvard training quar- j
ters. Charley Paddock and Dink Tem- |
pleton were having a quiet little dope 1
talk with several of their friends — |
figuring chances in the Amsterdam ]
games and touching on Stanford's j
chances in the '29 Intercollegiates, :
when a newcomer —a coach from a
small New England College—broke in j
on the discussion.
"I overheard what you said about j
Stanford, California, and U.S.C., and
I guess maybe you have the dope
down right. The Coast boys seem to j
have the natural stuff and they're get-1
ting better all the time, but at that i
you can't hand all the credit to their j
coaches. Tha's the bunk and you i
know it. You've been around a lot ;
and you know that the reason Cali- j
fornia wins is because you've got the j
climate and athletes.
" Why take this fellow Templeton
—who holds down the coaching job
at Stanford. They tell me that he's
just naturally lazy and lucky. I
watched him yesterday when he was !
working with some of his field boys
and that's just the way I figure him. j
Ho gets out on the field with an old
wooden chair and sits down where he j
can watch the boys do their stuff and
then he just sits there and looks wise.
Every once in awhile he gets up and
goes over to his high jumper or one j
of his shot putters and says, 'Great j
stuff, kid, let's see you do that again.' |
I
You know —the same line of bull we j
all hand out when we can't think of
anything else to say." The speaker j

| glowered at Charley Paddock and
j waited for him to Jump to the defense
' of the coast. When Charley remained
| quiet he again took up his plaint,
"Can you imagine that —a real coach
j sitting out there on a chair and get
j ting up every fifteen minutes or so to
hand out a line of bull."
The room grew very still and every
| one looked a trifle embarrassed. Most
jof them were well acquainted with
] Templeton and they figured that he
J would never let this fellow get away
I with his line of talk. And they were
( right. Templeton rose from his chair
and they could see that he was set
| for a verbal explosion.
"That's a lie," he shouted angrily,
: facing the astounded New Englander.
"A double-dashed, hyperbolated lie. I
never get up from my chair."
