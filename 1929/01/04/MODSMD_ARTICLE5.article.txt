## 
### 
•
Stanford's versatility will be proved j
again next Wednesday night when the J
first all-campus motion picture pro- j
duction, "The Fast Male," featuring
such local talent as Biff Hoffman and
Powell Carpenter, is presented to Uni
versity students in the Assembly Hall. '
The picture which has been in pro- ; '<
duction for the last eight months is | <
a creation of Stanford Studios under ;
the direction of Ernest W. Page. The |
scenario, the direction, the photogra- i
pliy, the art work and titles, the de- j
veloping and the laboratory work, '
have been done by students of the !
University. "The Fast Male" is a four-j
reel photoplay which reveals the j
secrets of modern college life from a j
new angle.
Our hero, Powell Carpenter, comes ;
to college as the greenest of fresh- J
men, and as freshmen are wont to do, j
he falls in love with the most beauti-1!
ful co-ed on the campus. She, how
ever, "queens" steadily with the great j
college hero, played by Biff Hoffman.
The story of the rivalry over the most
beautiful co-ed forms the main olot i
of the picture. (
"The Fast Male" was filmed en
tirely on the campus and possesses j
several scenes in which students may
discover themselves. At last year's
Masque Ball a few shots were taken,
and as the college hero is a track (
star, pictures of several track meets
are included.
Seven short features will precede j
the presentation of the picture. "Idle j
Hours," a scenic study of the cam- j'
pus, "Kampus Nooze," "Liqi'id Air," j
a series of experiments performed by !
Ur. E. C. Franklin in the Chemistry
building, the "Days of a Man," a life i
study of Dr. Jordan, a resume of j
Iloover's activities on the campus, I'
the highlights of Stanford sports in
slow motion, and a specialty musical
number by the Staley-Spalding or
chestra are the shorter bits of enter
tainment.
General admission to the show will
be sold at the Assembly Hall at 8
o'clock Wednesday night for twenty- i
five cents.

reel photoplay which reveals the j
secrets of modern college life from a j
new angle.
Our hero, Powell Carpenter, comes ;

ful co-ed on the campus. She, how
ever, "queens" steadily with the great j
college hero, played by Biff Hoffman.
The story of the rivalry over the most
beautiful co-ed forms the main olot i
of the picture. (
"The Fast Male" was filmed en
tirely on the campus and possesses j
several scenes in which students may
discover themselves. At last year's
Masque Ball a few shots were taken,

are included.

the presentation of the picture. "Idle j
Hours," a scenic study of the cam- j'
pus, "Kampus Nooze," "Liqi'id Air," j

tainment.
