# NEW RECORD IN SUSTAINED FLIGHTS SET
## Question Mark Exceeds Old Limit by Two Hours; Plane Still in Air 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3. (/P)—
The world's endurance flight rec
ord of sixty hours and seven min
utes was broken by the Army's
tri-motored Fokker monoplane,
Question Mark, as it circled over
Imperial Valley at 9:26 o'clock to
night.
Reports said that Army officers
declared the plane had broken by
two hours the old record set by
two Belgian army fliers last June.
The plane still continued flying,
and the motors hummed smooth
ly as the plane passed over Braw
ley, California, soon after break
ing the record.
METROPOLITAN AIRPORT, LOS
ANGELES, Jan. 3. (^) —Fog late to
day forced the Question Mark, army
Klane attempting to shatter all endur
ance flight records, to abandon its
stated course between Rockwell Field,
San Diego, and here, and to cross the
Santa Rosa mountains into Imperial
Valley.
The tri-motored Fokker appeared
1,000 feet above Brawley, in the heart
of the valley, at 4 o'clock. Her motors
were purring smoothly and with the
sun shining brightly, visibility was
excellent. The plane headed north
ward up the valley, which she is ex
pected to circle throughout the night.
After a night described as "hectic"
by Major Carl Spatz, commander, of
the plane, and a day during which
poor visibility placed the tri-motored
Fokker monoplane in constant dan
ger, the huge craft wheeled its way
to the valley which lies below sea
level, and is surrounded by moun
tains.
Refueling plane No. 2, formerly sta
tioned at San Diego, was ordered to
proceed to Imperial Airport, near El
Centro, Calif., and to prepare to re
main there until the fog on the coast
was dispersed. The Question Mark
will circle the valley indefinitely.
Should a landing be forced before the
ship can return to the coast it will be
made at the government airport in
Mtxacali, Lower California, Major
Spatz indicated.
In the event the big craft is forced
to land in Imperial Valley its attempt
at records will be futile, observers
here said, since the rules require that
the plane end its flight at the port
trom which it took off.
An optimistic message from the
Question Mark indicated that there
was no danger of an immediate land
ing. Everyone aboard was reported
well and the condition of the plane
was described as "normal." The
Wright-Whirlwind motors, with which
the plane is equipped, were running
smoothly. t

pected to circle throughout the night.
After a night described as "hectic"
by Major Carl Spatz, commander, of
the plane, and a day during which
poor visibility placed the tri-motored
Fokker monoplane in constant dan
ger, the huge craft wheeled its way
to the valley which lies below sea
level, and is surrounded by moun
tains.
Refueling plane No. 2, formerly sta
tioned at San Diego, was ordered to
proceed to Imperial Airport, near El
Centro, Calif., and to prepare to re
main there until the fog on the coast
was dispersed. The Question Mark
will circle the valley indefinitely.
Should a landing be forced before the
ship can return to the coast it will be
made at the government airport in
Mtxacali, Lower California, Major
Spatz indicated.
In the event the big craft is forced
to land in Imperial Valley its attempt
at records will be futile, observers
here said, since the rules require that
the plane end its flight at the port
trom which it took off.
An optimistic message from the
Question Mark indicated that there
was no danger of an immediate land
ing. Everyone aboard was reported
well and the condition of the plane
was described as "normal." The
Wright-Whirlwind motors, with which
the plane is equipped, were running
smoothly. t
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3. (/P)—
The world's endurance flight rec
ord of sixty hours and seven min
utes was broken by the Army's
tri-motored Fokker monoplane,
Question Mark, as it circled over
Imperial Valley at 9:26 o'clock to
night.
Reports said that Army officers
declared the plane had broken by
two hours the old record set by
two Belgian army fliers last June.
The plane still continued flying,
and the motors hummed smooth
ly as the plane passed over Braw
ley, California, soon after break
ing the record.
METROPOLITAN AIRPORT, LOS
ANGELES, Jan. 3. (^) —Fog late to
day forced the Question Mark, army
Klane attempting to shatter all endur
ance flight records, to abandon its
stated course between Rockwell Field,
San Diego, and here, and to cross the
Santa Rosa mountains into Imperial
Valley.
The tri-motored Fokker appeared
1,000 feet above Brawley, in the heart
of the valley, at 4 o'clock. Her motors
were purring smoothly and with the
sun shining brightly, visibility was
excellent. The plane headed north
ward up the valley, which she is ex
pected to circle throughout the night.
