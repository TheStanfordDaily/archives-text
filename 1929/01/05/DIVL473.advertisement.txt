I \"\ THH-E Ethyl gasoline will improve the performance
W of any car, it is an absolute necessity in the newer high
compression motors. If you are driving such a motor, with
properly advanced spark, you must use Ethyl to enjoy full high
compression performance—increased speed and power—less
fuel consumption and generally reduced operating costs.
Developed after years of scientific research in the great lab
oratories of the General Motors Corporation, Ethyl was
made to fit the needs of high compression motors and is
recognized by automotive engineers as the only commercially
practical substance that will overcome destructive "knock.
ing" and develop highest power and efficiency in any motor.
Two years ago only one per cent of American automobile
manufacturers produced high compression motors. Today,
as the result of Ethyl, there are more than fifty-six per cent.
Forty-two of the largest and best known oil companies in
the world add ETHYL brand of anti-knock compound to
their finest gasolines.
Because Ethyl Gasoline is dyed to distinguish it from or
dinary gasolines, many imitators have produced dyed or so
called anti-knock gasolines whose chief merit is their many
claims. Ethyl Gasoline is the only genuine, anti-knock, high
I compression fuel; and can be obtained only from author- I
