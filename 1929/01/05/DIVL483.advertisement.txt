Dear Sirs:
Having just returned from my fishing
camp in northern Ontario, and in the
reflections upon a fortnight of most
excellent weather, wonderful fishing
and complete camp comfort, I feel
that an appreciation of Edgeworth is
due, as one of the principal factors of
our enjoyment.
In past, years, I have taken along a
supply of various well-known brands
of smoking tobacco, never having be
come fully acquainted with the differ
ence in the smoking qualities of the
so-called high-grade tobaccos now
upon the market, and acting upon a
tip from an old smoker friend, and as
a matter of convenience in packing,
this year I took along a dozen tins of
Edgeworth Plug Slice.
There are no places nor conditions
in existence where the contentment
drawn from a briar pipe meets with
keener enjoyment or more critical
analysis than beside the camp-fire
after a strenuous day in the great
outdoors.
It is the unanimous opinion of the
smokers among my party that Edge
worth is without a peer, and that its
smoothness, fragrance and fine smok
ing qualities are unsurpassed and un
matched: and I thank you for making
it possible to obtain it.
Yours truly,
(Signed) 11. N. Curtiss
