# CARD FIVE WILL MEET GRAY FOG CAGERS TONIGHT
## Visiting Quintet Has Won 11 Straight Victories; Rated As Best on Pacific Coast Hawkins, Tampcke, Rothert, Tyler, Fawcett to Start Against St. Ignatius Team 
### MERLE EMRY 
Pepped up from their two victories
over U.C.L.A., the Stanford basket
ball players clash with the all-power
ful St. Ignatius team at 8 o'clock to
night in the Pavilion.
In meeting the Gray Fog quintet,
the Card cagers are up against a team
that, is rated as the strongest on the
Pacific Coast; one that has won
eleven straight victories so far this
season; one that trounced the Uni

Jimmy Needles has a team that has
aspirations to represent the Coast in
the A.A.U. play-offs and tonight's con

toward that air-castle as far as they
are concerned. In addition, the St. Ig
natius players have another reason

wipe out the defeat the Redsliirts
handed them last year.
The Gray Fog team is composed of
two crack basket-shooters, Captain
Hay Maloney, forward, and Jay Hale,
rangy left-handed center. Maloney has
tallied ninety-two points in ten games,
while Hale is high-scorer on the squad,
making 121 points in eleven contests.
These men are versatile basket
shooters, calling their shots from
every conceivable angle of the court.
Cameron Jumps Center
Cameron, guard, jumps on the tip
off and then falls back to standing
guard where he combines speed and
power to get the hall off of the back
board. Rene Bareilles is Cameron's
running-mate as well as being the
key man on the Gray Fog's offense.
Kleckner plays the other forward
position.
Coach Hunt put the Cards through
a stiff workout yesterday afternoon
preparing for the St. Ignatius aggre
gation. The Stanford mentor saw St.
Ignatius hand California a 34 to 22
drubbing and plans to strengthen the
