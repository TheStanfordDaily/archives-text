" 'What Every Woman Knows' is
one of the great plays of the modern
stage, and will outlive most of its con
temporaries," said William Lyons
Phelps, president of Yale University
and a well-known dramatic critic, in
speaking of the Masquers' play which
will be given Friday night in the As
sembly Hall.
"Barrie's comedy reveals courage
as the dynamic quality of his dramas,"
said Phelps. "Ilis heroes and his hero
ines have it; his villains do not. Mag
gie saves John Shand by courage. His
plays are not sentimental like melo
! dramas and some motion pictures,
but they are humanly sympathetic
and are dramas of ideas rather than
dramas of opinions."
"What Every Woman Knows" is a
realistic drama of an overwhelming
! love which overcomes all obstacles in
its way. Maggie, the real Maggie, is
a study, not of the love John Shand
| gives her, but of "her own sweet love
\ for him." Gordon Davis, in the Stan-
I ford production, is attempting to cor

] relate the spirit and rhythm of the
I play with the action.
"There is a definite rhythm in the
lines of Barrle's play," said Gordon
i Davis. "Each act lias its own tempo
land rhythmical meter and is an artis
tic unit in itself, although the four
acts are welded together in harmoni
j ous unity."
In the first act, the family feeling
of the Wylies is the predominant
j theme. There is the slow steady beat
lot' the Scotch loyalty and devotion.
The tempo of the second act is
much faster and vivacious. It is an
election night of stirring excitement,
six vears later than (lie first scene,
I
| and John Shand is awaiting the news
that will make him or break him.
The third act reveals Maggie's loy
laity and devotion to her husband de
| spite his interest in one of London's
| fashionable beauties. The fourth act
shows Maggie's cleverness, and her
overwhelming love which triumphs in
the end.
Seats for the play are on sale now

" 'What Every Woman Knows' is
one of the great plays of the modern
stage, and will outlive most of its con
temporaries," said William Lyons
Phelps, president of Yale University
and a well-known dramatic critic, in
speaking of the Masquers' play which
will be given Friday night in the As
sembly Hall.
"Barrie's comedy reveals courage
as the dynamic quality of his dramas,"
said Phelps. "Ilis heroes and his hero
ines have it; his villains do not. Mag
gie saves John Shand by courage. His
plays are not sentimental like melo
! dramas and some motion pictures,
but they are humanly sympathetic
and are dramas of ideas rather than
dramas of opinions."
"What Every Woman Knows" is a
realistic drama of an overwhelming
! love which overcomes all obstacles in
its way. Maggie, the real Maggie, is
a study, not of the love John Shand
| gives her, but of "her own sweet love
\ for him." Gordon Davis, in the Stan-
I ford production, is attempting to cor

] relate the spirit and rhythm of the
I play with the action.
"There is a definite rhythm in the
lines of Barrle's play," said Gordon
i Davis. "Each act lias its own tempo
land rhythmical meter and is an artis
tic unit in itself, although the four
acts are welded together in harmoni
j ous unity."
In the first act, the family feeling
of the Wylies is the predominant
j theme. There is the slow steady beat
lot' the Scotch loyalty and devotion.
The tempo of the second act is
much faster and vivacious. It is an
election night of stirring excitement,
six vears later than (lie first scene,
I
| and John Shand is awaiting the news
that will make him or break him.
The third act reveals Maggie's loy
laity and devotion to her husband de
| spite his interest in one of London's
| fashionable beauties. The fourth act
shows Maggie's cleverness, and her
overwhelming love which triumphs in
the end.
