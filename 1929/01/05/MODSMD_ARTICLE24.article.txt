llow can a newspaper measure its accomplishment when it crusades
in behalf of something or other?
Its duty is simply to expose the situation; having faithfully done that,
it has done its duty.
So Professor Edgar E. Robinson yesterday in his Westward Move
ment class answered a hypothetical question as to what had been the good
of the agitation in the Daily's columns over the living and working con
ditions of the campus janitors. Whilst the influence which the many yards
of type may have had is as yet unobservable, said Professor Robinson,
the effect probably was such that when further arrangements are made
between the University and the American Building Maintenance Com
pany, the exposition of facts made by the Daily will be held in mind.
Professor Robinson's definition of a newspaper's measure of success
in campaigning for or against a thing is encouraging to us and probably
will be enlightening to the reader. Volume 74 lias been nurtured quite
extensively on controversies, which have seemed to flare up, only to go
out, even as the Big Game Bonfire is wont to do. But the latent fact is
that discussion, in Campus Opinion and in this and other columns, has
probably helj>ed to fix in the mind of the reader a definite attitude on
the subjects of controversy.
And it is true that the battles of the past four months are having, and
will continue to have, an influence upon the frontier of student thought.
The bonfire will come up to a vote at the elections next Tuesday. The
honor spirit, we feel confident, has been strengthened. Rooting, it is
likely, will in future err much less on the side of obscenity. The sorority-
Roble issue already has come to a head. Now, these issues, whether or
not anything has been, or will be, done to settle them, are the better for
having been aired, and it is undeniable that as a result a more vigorous,
firm, and definite opinion upon them has taken possession of the student
mind.

But to continue Professor Robinson's remarks: he devoted most of
his lecture hour yesterday to paying a hearty tribute to the Daily which
the staff and the editor appreciate and are, we hope, modestly thankful
for. We find the members of the faculty generally quite tolerant of the
foibles and mistakes of undergraduate journalism; when one of them
deviates from his lecture to a class of 200 or so to compliment the Daily,
we begin to gloat.
In Professor Robinson's opinion, the Daily, for the first time in its
career, as he has observed it, has become an influential local paper. It
presents throughout a judicious selection of well-written news. Its col
umns are well done, and Winston Norman's Bullsession of yesterday was
an excellent diagnosis of the faults of the Cruiser Bill, now before Con
gress. Speaking further of the Gonfalier of Reform, Probessor Rob
inson said that while such discussions as the abolition of sororities, in
itiated by Mr. Norman, may cause ohs and ahs to be voiced off campus,
their effect, whatever their outcome, is salubrious on the campus. The
host of Campus Opinions which have flocked in are not only valuable in
themselves, but also are proof that the paper is commanding thought.
These and many other things did Professor Robinson say, and after
ward he dismissed his class twenty minutes early. Whereat all were
pleased.
