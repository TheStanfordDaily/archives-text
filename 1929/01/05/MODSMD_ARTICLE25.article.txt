# Silent Cal on the Standards of the Collegian

(From the Oregon Emerald)
Said President Coolidge: "Two great tests in mental discipline are
accuracy and honesty. It is far better to master a few subjects thoroughly
than to have a mass of generalizations about many subjects. The world
will have little use for those who are right only a part of the time. What
ever may l>e the standards of the classroom, practical life will require
something more than 60 per cent or 70 per,cent for a passing mark. The
standards of the world are not like those set by the faculty, but more
closely resemble those set by the student body themselves. They are not
at all content with a member of the musical organizations \vho can strike
only 90 per cent of the notes. They do not tolerate the man on the
diamond who catches only 80 per cent of the balls. The standards which
the student body set are high. They want accuracy that is well-nigh
complete. They apply the same standards to candor and honesty. Bluff
and pretense may be permitted in the classroom; but in their relations
with each other students regard such practices with contempt, and those
who resort to them arc properly considered to be cheap. They may be
willing to view with considerable tolerance those who break the rules of
the school, but they will not fail to mete out condemnation and penalty
to those who break the rules of training. When the world holds its ex
aminations it will require the same standards of accuracy and honesty
which student bodies impose upon themselves. Unless the mind is
brought under such training and discipline as will enable it to acquire
these standards at an early period, the grave danger increases that they
may never be acquired."
And, though it is a well-known fact that the President is always
wrong, for once, wc say, Silent Cal uttered a mouthful.
