# An Affair Worthy of Support
## 
### 
The masque ball to be sponsored by the Palo Alto School of Aviation
is not an intended advertising scheme, but a celebration of the first year
of the school's existence, and as such is entitled to the support of the
student body. The school is established on University property and is
to be considered almost a part of the University. During its first year,
by the way, its students have had no fatal accidents —a record of which
it is deservedly proud.
Saturday night at 9:30 o'clock—after the California-Stanford basket
ball game—has been chosen as the time for the masque ball. Proceeds
from the sale of tickcts will be given to the ever worthy Stanford Con
valescent Home.

To the Editorial Staff:
The election of an editor for Volume 75 of the Daily will take place
today from 12:45 to 1:30 o'clock.
