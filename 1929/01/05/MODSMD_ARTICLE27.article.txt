Stanford Literary Magazine. January
1929.
Whew! Steaming shade of Hades.
We can recommend the current Lit
a3 being what a Jim Tully edition of
the American Mercury might be.
As a recipe for the January Lit, we
suggest: Use a base of blood and
thunder, add generous quantities of
murder, suicide, and rape with a dash
ot Powell Street prostitutes and queen
ly bawds. Shake well, and take spar
ingly!
One delicate touch is added to the
book by Blanch Barnett's story,
"Judy." There is a tenderness of feel
ing and expression in this story that
exceeds anything the Lit has seen in
several moons.
"Shadows," by Lincoln Hobson,
furnishes the "piece de resistance,"
of the magazine. A suicide theme it
is, and tolerably well handled with
one exception. The story doesn't ring
true unless you presuppose that the
main character has a diseased mind
to start out with. It is hard to ima
gine any normal person so self-con
scious.
The frontispiece is good. Something
different from the usual black-and
white work one sees. May I shake
hands with Shapovalov for this new
interpretation of the Library.
"And Falstaff Laughed" because his
hear was broken. John Rogers has
written a story that called to mind a
couple of verses from a poem called
"The Broken of Heart" by James
Rorty:
"The heart is a thing to be broken
And drowned in the deepest sea;
A thing to be scattered and sown
Till the proud soul laughs and is free.
"As soon as may be, the old man said,
Be done with your heart, and give it
away;
Then build for your hopeless soul a
house,
And laugh, and be kind and gay."
All of which is not at all a pleasant
philosophy, but Rogers presents it
vividly a*»i with all its unpleasant
ness.
As to the poetry, I just want to let
you in on a little secret. The clever
piece called "Trepidation" is credited
falsely to a certain Edith Dorothy
Sherman. In reality it is done by the
bashful editor himself, Jim Tucker.

In a bit called "Restaurant" John
Dean attempts to give us a snatch of
ultra-realism. A careful reading of the
thing would suggest that possibly the
love of strong words as such ran away
with his sense of balance. The sketch
is too concentrated; there is too much
highly flavored verbiage for one 700-
word meal.
In her verse, "To a Professor," Hal
lie Keating refers to a university
class responding to a lecture like a

sensitive bit of protoplasm. I hate to
differ with Miss Keating, but in most
classes of my experience there has
been just a sensitive speck of proto
plasm here and there, and the class
as a whole has been, may I say,
rather dumbly drowsy and unrespon
sive.
To close this hodge-podge of com
ment —If you get sick and tired of
tbe reviews in the Daily I strongly
recommend that you read those in
the Lit. They're interesting and con
scientiously done. It's a minor fault
that they have the usual cock-sure
attitude of reviews written by college
men. May God speed the arrival of
the day when we university students
can admit that we don't know every
thing! —Clifford F. Weigle.

"The Gondoliers." By Gilbert and
Sullivan. At the Columbia.
When children are exchanged in
their cradle (as they have a way of
being in Gilbert librettos) a pretty

mess is sure to result. And that forms
the theme for an amusing series of
complications in "The Gondoliers,"
the second production of the D'Oyly
Carte Company, playing a limited en
gagement of Gilbert and Sullivan re
pertoire at the Columbia Theatre.
"The Gondoliers" is an ambitious
comic opera, and was given a great
production by the English company.
In fact, one wonders if they could fail
to give a good show. They are the
original company, and are carrying
on the tradition of the famous Savoy
Theatre, where Sir William S. Gilbert
and Sir Arthur Sullivan, with D'Oyly
Carte as manager, were delighting
Englishmen and soon the whole the
atrical world with their brilliantly
comic musical lampoons.
The story of "The Gondoliers" is
laid in Venice, obviously, and con
cerns two gondolieri who are the hit
of the old town. All the girls swim
miles to worship them. They finally
choose wives by the blindfold test, a
dangerous proceeding at best, and get
just the ones they want —this being
a comic opera.
But Fate in the shape of The Duke
of Plaza Toro, an impoverished Span
ish nobleman, and The Grand In
quisitor of Spain step in ,or rather,
row in. It seems that one of the two
gondoliers is the heir to the throne
of Barataria. Of that, sings the In
quisitor, there is "no possible doubt
whatever." The only trouble is no one
knows which is the King and which
the humble boatman.
So it is decided that they must go
to Barataria and reign jointly with
Casilda, daughter of the Duchess of
Plaza Toro, to whom one of them was
married, by proxy, at an early age.
"But we're both married," cry the
Venetians. "That," admits the Inquisi
tor, is "awkward. One of you is cer
tainly a bigamist."
Affairs are somewhat mixed for a
lime, but the untangling is accom
plished in a splendidly built-up en
trance for the Nurse who attended the
heir when he was a prattling infant.
But the Nurse, for reasons of her
own, exchanged prattles, and the true
King of Barataria comes in, attired
in royal raiment, and everything is
jake.

"The Gondoliers," save in its plot,
is far from the funniest of the Gilbert-
Sullivan operas. It wasn't meant to
be. It is one of the most ambitious,
however, and the splendid color in
costumes, setting, and music was
brought out to perfection by the Eng
lish players.

It is the Inquisitor's show, and Syd
ney Granville, as Don AlhamUra del
Balero, made the most of his chances.
Bertha Lewis was splendid as the
Duchess, and Henry Lvtton's Duke of
Plaza Toro was an amusing charac
terization. Every part was well
played, with Blossom Gelsthorpe look
ing very lovely in a "minuet" cos
tume.
The music, if not memorable, fits
the plot to perfection. It deserves to
be better known.

"Trial by Jury" and "The Pirates
of Penzance" will be played together
until Wednesday, "lolanthe" until
Saturday, and "Ruddigore" till next
Wednesday. Then single repeat per
formances will be given of four
operas, ending with the evergreen
"Mikado" a week from Saturday night.

Don't miss these shows. Forget the
performance of "The Pirates of Pen
zance" that was given by the Ladies'
Aid Society of the First Presbyterian
Church of Cow Hollow and go and
see comic operas produced as the
authors, the critics, and everybody
else want to see them produced. A
grand show, mates, and three more to
come! —Burnell Gould.
