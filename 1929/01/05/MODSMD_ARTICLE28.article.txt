## WHY NOT INSTALL BARBERS' CHAIRS AT THE LIBRARY TABLES? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There has been something that
Stanford has lacked a long time,
namely, library rest rooms. Students
sleepy from one cause or another go
to the library instead of wasting the
time in a beneficial nap at home. But
the restful, quiet atmosphere of the
library is more conducive to sleep
than anywhere else on the campus,
including lecture rooms and the
chapel. After several minutes attempt
ing to study, the tired student gives
up the struggle and dozes. If he de
cided to take the trouble to go home
and sleep, he would get wide awake
as soon as he was outside. But doz
ing in the library for a couple of
hours does not rest a person. At best
he is embarrassed, not to mention
such tliinßs as limbs that go to sleep,
sore backs, and aching necks that are
wont to accompany sleeping in un
comfortable positions. On the other
hand, it is quite possible that the
desk or books he uses could be uti
lized by someone else to better ad
vantage.

If the University was open-minded
enough in this direction to test the
efficiency of a rest room or two, or
lower temperatures, the students
would soon take advantage and either
reap the benefits of a good nap or a
good wide-awake study period, which
is impossible now.
