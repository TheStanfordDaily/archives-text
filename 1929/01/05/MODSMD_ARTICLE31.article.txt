We understand that the house
meeting of a certain sorority yester- I
day opened with a prayer, followed i

Homes."
"Old business will be transacted
first," says a Big Scoop in the Daily.
Following it the report of the Com

The Sergeant-at-Arms will eject all

it is expected that our able Regis
trar's office will shortly issue regular

of the seed.

Tobacco seeds are so small that a
thimbleful will furnish enough plants for
an acre of ground.
