## 
### 
The question of widening and pav
ing El Caniino Real along the Palo
Alto-Stanford frontage was discussed
at a recent meeting attended by A. E.
Roth, University comptroller, Col. J.
H. Skeggs, division engineer of the
state highway department, and Palo
Alto city officials.
Colonel Skeggs stated that the state
contemplates widening and paving the
highway in this section by about
July 1.
The plan calls for a right of way
100 feet wide, with a central paved
«trip 40 feet wide. It is proposed to
widen the bridge over San Francis
cjuito creek as well. Minor changes in
alignment on the highway between the
creek and University avenue are
planned.
The electric car tracks on the high
way present a problem which must
be solved before the paving com
mences. If they are allowed to remain,
the state takes the position that they
must be centered on the highway and
must be walled on both sides. Col
onel Skeggs said he would prefer to
see them taken off the road altogether,
ft was apparently the belief that the
best solution of the car track problem
would he for the line to parallel the
Southern Pacific tracks from the
highway crossing below Mayfield, us
ing the railroad's right-of-way.
