teen seconds of play enabled El
Campo to win over Phi Kappa Sigma
in the fastest game played yesterday

championship of League 2. Gatzert \
played a nice floor game for the win- j
ners. Ward Edmonds, forward for the !
Plii Sigs, was high-scorer with 10 1

The Chinese Club pulled a surprise i
jesterday afternoon, when it played
lings around a sluggish Encina Base- ;
ment outfit to chalk up its first win j
to date. The winners displayed a j
speedy brand of floorwork and tossed j
in shots when they were needed, j
Lowe and Fong each tallied 8 mark

Delia Chi in a slow game and thereby
walked off with the title of League 3. !

pendent squad and scored 8 points.
Behides playing a strong game at
guard, McAnaw put in 7 tallies for the

After piling up a 10-point lead in j
the first quarter, the Lawyers went i

trounced by Encina 2E. Smith, for- j
ward for the hall outfit, featured the |
game with two,long shots from the
center of the court. Wayman was

the game and was high-scorer with
6 tallies. Eastman stood out at stand- >
ing guard for the Alpha Delts.
