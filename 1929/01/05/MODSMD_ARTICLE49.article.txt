Intramural tennis matches sched
uled for Monday were called on ac
count of rain. These matches are to
be played in regular order, but one
day later all week. Matches forty-one
to forty-five will be played today.
Charles Davis, intramural sport di
rector, reminds the mural teams that
they must be careful to post their
match results on the Encina gym bul
letin board, as that is the only record
of their matches.
