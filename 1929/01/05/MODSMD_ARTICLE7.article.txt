# Film To Show Radium Effects In Cancer Cure
## Picture Producer in London Will Illustrate Kofoid Lecture Tonight 
### 
Tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall Dr. Charles A. Kofoid,
of the University of California, will
interpret a film in which living cells
will be shown functioning. The film
was made by Dr. Reginald Canti ot
St. Bartholomew's Hospital in Lon
don, and was brought to Berkeley by
Dr. Kofoid for its first public show
ing.
The effect of radium upon living
cells is shown in the film. Treatment
of cancer by radium, according to Dr.
Kofoid, is generally accepted by
i scientists. The chief field for research
is therefore the technique of its ap
plication. Various types of cells are
shown in the film; among them are
chromosomes, cells that carry the
j hereditary traits, filmed in several of
j their reproduction processes.
The film was presented at the Lis
ter Anniversary meeting of the Brit
j ish Medical Association in Edin
| burgh, at the eleventh Zoological Con
gress in Budapest, and recently at
I Pomona College. At each showing, a
repetition of the film was demanded.
