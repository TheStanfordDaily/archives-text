# CARDS TO MEET GAEL HOOPSTERS HERE TOMORROW
## Stanford Five Beats Strong College of Pacific Squad With Score of 34 to 31 Tazer Is Moragan Mainstay; Appearance of Reynolds Boosts Cardinal Chances 
### ANSON REEDER 
With the first game of the New
Year against the strong College of
Pacific quintet chalked to their credit
by virtue of a 34-31 victory, the Stan
ford varsity basketball team is sched
uled for some intensive drill prior to
its tete-a-tete here in the Pavilion
with the Galloping Gaels from St.
Mary's tomorrow night.
The big noise of the Moraga cagers
is a young man named Tazer who has
been solely responsible for one-third
of the team's points during their last
two games. Tough competition was
what the Gaels were looking for and
they found it when they tackled the
Rossi florists of San Francisco, and
the San Jose Golds, a club team from
that city. Although losing both games
by close scores the Oaklanders
showed a second period offensive that
threatened to change matters. As in
football the visitors can always be
depended on to present a fighting ag
gregation, so the contest should not
lack interest.
Card conference hopes were raised
considerably with the appearance Fri
day of Mike Reynolds, captain and
star guard on last year's yearling
team, who has been confined to the
hospital with the flu for the past
week. Reynolds will probably see ac
tion for a short time tomorrow night
and if he is able may start the first
conference game against UCLA here
Saturday.
Friday's contest with the College
of Pacific was one of the best ex
hibitions of basketball seen in these
parts for some time. The passing and
floor work of the Cards was bettec
than any displayed by a Stanford
team in several seasons. Coach
Husky Hunt rejuvenated his cage
squad by using four sophomores in
the line-up during the course of the
melee. The net result was that the
lour, Fawcett, Mears, Hawkins, and
