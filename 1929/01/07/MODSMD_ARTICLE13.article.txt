# President-Elect Reaches Capital After Long Tour
## Hoover to Open Temporary Headquarters at Hotel For Conferences 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.
dent-elect Hoover returned to Wash
ington today from his Latin-American
goodwill tour to find himself envel
oped in a maelstrom of political dis
cussion involving Cabinet appoint
ments, an extra session of Congress,
farm relief, tariff revision, and a score
of other matters that figured in his
campaign.
Arriving at Old Point Comfort, Va.,
at 8 A.M., on the battleship Utah
from Rio de Janeiro, the last port of
call in South America, the President
elect came to Washington on a special
train and immediately arranged to
open temporary headquarters tomor
row at the Mayflower Hotel where he
will begin a series of conferences
with Republican Party leaders.
While Mr. Hoover had only one
specific engagement—that with Sen
ator Burton of Ohio —he planned to
make an early personal report to
President Coolidge on his Latin-
American trip. He also will hold a
series of conferences on Cabinet ap
pointments after which he will make
his selections, although announce
ment of them probably will be with
held until just before inauguration.
The President-elect returned to
Washington for a brief stay to find a
division among Congressional leaders
who supported him in the election as
to whether farm relief should not be
enacted at this session and the extra
session which has been promised by
him for this legislation avoided until
next fall, at least.
Mr. Hoover will spend much of to
morrow acquainting himself with the
whole domestic situation as it has
developed during his two months' ab
sence from the country. However, his
close associates have flatly declared
that he will offer no suggestions con
cerning problems before this Con
gress as he holds it is highly im
proper for a President-elect to under
take to interfere in any way with
legislative matters pending during
the administration of his predecessor
in office.
Congressional leaders generally
concede that the pending McNary
agricultural bill, which has the en
dorsement of the Coolidge adminis
tration, cannot be enacted at this
short session without word from Mr.
Hoover. Should this legislation fail
the President-elect will call an extra
session of the Twenty-first Congress
to carry through the program which
he outlined during his campaign.
President-elect Hoover has kept his
own counsel about his Cabinet and he
has derived no little amusement from
the efforts of political wiseacres to
pick it for him. Reports of their ac
tivities reached him during his home
ward voyage on the Utah, largely
through the medium of Washington
rispatches printed in the ship's paper,
"The Big U."
We will take the matter of appoint
ments up within a day or two with
those he will invite to his headquar
ters. After a week of conferences
here be will move on to Miami, Fla.,
not to return to Washington until
time for his inauguration.

his selections, although announce
ment of them probably will be with
held until just before inauguration.
The President-elect returned to
Washington for a brief stay to find a
division among Congressional leaders
who supported him in the election as
to whether farm relief should not be
enacted at this session and the extra
session which has been promised by
him for this legislation avoided until
next fall, at least.
Mr. Hoover will spend much of to
morrow acquainting himself with the
whole domestic situation as it has
developed during his two months' ab
sence from the country. However, his
close associates have flatly declared
that he will offer no suggestions con
cerning problems before this Con
gress as he holds it is highly im
proper for a President-elect to under
take to interfere in any way with
legislative matters pending during
the administration of his predecessor
in office.
Congressional leaders generally
concede that the pending McNary
agricultural bill, which has the en
dorsement of the Coolidge adminis
tration, cannot be enacted at this
short session without word from Mr.
Hoover. Should this legislation fail
the President-elect will call an extra
session of the Twenty-first Congress
to carry through the program which
he outlined during his campaign.
President-elect Hoover has kept his
own counsel about his Cabinet and he
has derived no little amusement from
the efforts of political wiseacres to
pick it for him. Reports of their ac
tivities reached him during his home
ward voyage on the Utah, largely
through the medium of Washington
rispatches printed in the ship's paper,
"The Big U."
We will take the matter of appoint
ments up within a day or two with
those he will invite to his headquar
ters. After a week of conferences
here be will move on to Miami, Fla.,
not to return to Washington until
time for his inauguration.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.
dent-elect Hoover returned to Wash
ington today from his Latin-American
goodwill tour to find himself envel
oped in a maelstrom of political dis
cussion involving Cabinet appoint
ments, an extra session of Congress,
farm relief, tariff revision, and a score
of other matters that figured in his
campaign.
Arriving at Old Point Comfort, Va.,
at 8 A.M., on the battleship Utah
from Rio de Janeiro, the last port of
call in South America, the President
elect came to Washington on a special
train and immediately arranged to
open temporary headquarters tomor
row at the Mayflower Hotel where he
will begin a series of conferences
with Republican Party leaders.
While Mr. Hoover had only one
specific engagement—that with Sen
ator Burton of Ohio —he planned to
make an early personal report to
President Coolidge on his Latin-
American trip. He also will hold a
series of conferences on Cabinet ap
pointments after which he will make
his selections, although announce

held until just before inauguration.
