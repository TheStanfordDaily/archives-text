# ARKANSAS BEGINS CENSORSHIP DRIVE ON EVOLUTIONISTS
## Superintendent of Education Ransacks Libraries of Public Schools 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. G (J?).—
Ransacking of school libraries in
search of traces of evolution has
started in Arkansas following passage
of an anti-evolution act by a vote of
the people in the November election. ;
J. P. Woraack, state superintendent j
of education, has started the enforce- j
ment machinery by withdrawing ap
proval of one reference book, the
"World Book," by the state depart
ment of education, and has announced
that other reference books now in
use in schools but not officially ap
proved by his department come under
the ban.
Although personally opposed to the
law, which was approved by a large
majority, Mr. Womack has appealed
for vigorous enforcement, believing
this the best method of bringing
about its repeal.
Meanwhile the American Civil Lib- j
erties Union has broadcast an offer j
to aid any school teacher in contest- ;
ing the validity of the act, explaining
however that it does not wish to
stage another widely advertised con
test such as that which characterized j
the trial of John T. Scopes at Dayton, I
Tenn.
The new Arkansas law, which pro- !
hibits the teaching in any tax-sup- j
ported school or university of any
theory or doctrine that "man ascend- j
ed or descended from a lower order i
of animals," probably will affect the ;
University of Arkansas most, in the ;
opinion of educators.
They believe it will hamper the j
medical and biological departments j
of the university. However, school
libraries generally in the state are
undergoing scrutinization for refer
ences to evolution, which might be
considered violations of the law.
Passage of the act at the November
election concluded a two-year fight by
its proponents to have it written on
the Arkansas statute books.
A. L. Rotenberry, Little Rock at
torney and a member of the 1927 leg
islature, and Ben M. Bogard, a Mis
sionary Baptist minister and anti
evolution leader, are given most of
the responsibility for its enactment.
Rotenberry introduced an identical
measure in the 1927 house of repre
sentatives, which passed it by a ma
jority of one vote. The senate, how
j ever, killed it.
Enlisting the aid of ministers and
others, Rotenberry immediately in
augurated a move to place it before
j the voters as an initiative act. After
l several months sufficient signatures
'were obtained to petitions to force its
j submission.
The act provides a fine not to ex
ceed 5500 for violation, and any
teacher, upon conviction, automati
cally forfeits his right to teach in the
i state public schools. The textbook
j commission likewise is prohibited
| from approving any textbook contain
ing teachings of evolution.
