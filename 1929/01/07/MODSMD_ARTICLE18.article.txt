# PHYSICIAN'S GIFT MAY AMOUNT TO OVER $2,000,000
## Stanford Entitled to Half of Residuary Estate of Late Dr. G. A. Lawrence Neurologist's Ownership of Valuable Patent Disputed; Long Litigation May Ensue 
### 
The bequest of the late Dr. George
Alfred Lawrence, Stanford '92, to the
University may amount to more than
12,000,000 instead of the something
more than $1,000,000 specified in Dr.
Lawrence's will, it was indicated in a
telegram received yesterday by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur from Carroll
Single, Stanford graduate in New
York. Single looked into the will and
found that Stanford is entitled to half
the residuary estate which will
amount to $1,250,000 in addition to
the original million already an
nounced.
As yet Dr. Wilbur has not received
official confirmation of the gift.
Meantime there is some question as
to whether Dr. Lawrence had as much
of an estate as he thought he had.
His right of a forty per cent interest
in a $10,000,000 petx*oleum refining
process patent has been questioned,
and long litigation may ensue. Curt
von Boettinher, executor of the Law
rence estate, said lack of legal proof
of Dr. Lawrence's ownership of 40
per cent of the invention and his own
inability to get the widely scattered
heirs together to take action, made
the appointment of a temporary ad
ministrator necessary, according to
an Associated Press dispatch.
The Surrogate's Court in New York
appointed the American Trust Com
pany of New York temporary admin
istrator.
The executor said that Dr. Law
rence, just before his death, stated
that he owned the oil refining process
in partnership with a Samuel B. Coley,
who had purchased it from George B.
Gifford, the inventor.
Dr. Lawrence came to Stanford in
1891 as a senior from the old College
of the Pacific. He was graduated in
1892 with the first class and then
went to Columbia University, where
he was graduated in 1896 as M.A. and
in 1899 as M.D. During the war he
served in the Medical Corps. He was
famous as a neurologist and was the
author of many medical books.
In recent years Dr. Lawrence made
Stanford a number of small dona
tions. Two years ago he gave $5000
for the purpose of having a history of
the University written.
