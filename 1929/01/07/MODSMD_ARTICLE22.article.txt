# An Honor System Which Works
## 
### 
"The basic principles of the honor system are: No lying,
no cheating, no half-truths. No intentional dishonesty is
excusable, and under no circumstances will it be condoned.
"Every one is bound to report any breach of honor which
comes to his attention.
"Quibbling, evasive statements, or technicalities in order
to shield guilt or defeat the ends of justice will not be
tolerated."
Thus, in three paragraphs, the men of the United States Military
Academy have stated their code of honor. No dishonesty whatever, not
simply "no dishonesty in academic conduct." The penalty is the cold
shoulder.
What prevents Stanford men and women from observing a similar
code? Is it not desirable that civilians should develop as high a sense of
honor as soldiers? "Is there no virtue extant" in any American college,
save in West Point and Annapolis?
The most disappointing fact which has faced the committee investi
gating the honor system is that there is a general unwillingness to see
the honor system stated baldly and violations of it punished strictly.
The rank and file want Castoria, not castor oil, administered to the
"mentaKy rotten. ' Why the objection to naming and branding a cheater
or a liar after he has been found guilty? It isn't healthy to harbor such
people.
