With the beginning of the quarter comes the customary changing of
courses and uncertainty of programs. Students are again faced with the
inability of registering for certain courses because they are already
crowded. In many cases there is no indication given that enrollment will
be limited, and this results in grief and alteration of schedules.
This quarter the Economics department has posted in front of its
door a list of those courses in which enrollment is limited, and for which
students are requested to sign up in advance. Consequently no one in
this department can complain of not knowing that pre-registration for
these subjects is required.
The only flaw in this system is that students not in the department
will probably be unaware of it. Perhaps some information relative to
this might be printed in the time schedule which will let the student
know exactly what chances he stands of registering in the courses he is
desirous of taking.

Our age is so rapid and unquiet that it is increasingly difficult to
retain anything in the memory. The contents of books are evasive to the
restless minds with which most people are provided, and the more we
helplessly cram into our minds, the less we make stick. We personally
have determined to read twice every good book we come upon, in the
hope that the second perusal may cause some of the juicy parts to be
retained. "Not the least important purpose of a university education is
to provide the mind with something to chew on," says Professor Foster.
Granted, but what arc you going to do if that which you put into your
mind is lost before it becomes cud?
Professors from Louvain, Dijon, Vienna, Cologne, Columbia, and
Yale will join the faculty for the Summer Quarter. Indeed, frock coats
and European accents are not uncommon on the Quad during that
pleasant session. Each summer a greater number of undergraduates
wisely takes advantage of the studious atmosphere and freedom from
the never-ending round of ordinary activities.
Arthur Scotten last quarter completed the best academic record ever
made by a Stanford student, lie went straight A throughout his under
graduate career and graduated 10- 170 t- 340. At such a bawlout average
most of us can but sigh.

door a list of those courses in which enrollment is limited, and for which
students are requested to sign up in advance. Consequently no one in
this department can complain of not knowing that pre-registration for
these subjects is required.
The only flaw in this system is that students not in the department
will probably be unaware of it. Perhaps some information relative to
this might be printed in the time schedule which will let the student
know exactly what chances he stands of registering in the courses he is
desirous of taking.

Our age is so rapid and unquiet that it is increasingly difficult to
retain anything in the memory. The contents of books are evasive to the
restless minds with which most people are provided, and the more we
helplessly cram into our minds, the less we make stick. We personally
have determined to read twice every good book we come upon, in the
hope that the second perusal may cause some of the juicy parts to be
retained. "Not the least important purpose of a university education is
to provide the mind with something to chew on," says Professor Foster.
Granted, but what arc you going to do if that which you put into your
mind is lost before it becomes cud?
Professors from Louvain, Dijon, Vienna, Cologne, Columbia, and
Yale will join the faculty for the Summer Quarter. Indeed, frock coats
and European accents are not uncommon on the Quad during that
pleasant session. Each summer a greater number of undergraduates
wisely takes advantage of the studious atmosphere and freedom from
the never-ending round of ordinary activities.
Arthur Scotten last quarter completed the best academic record ever
made by a Stanford student, lie went straight A throughout his under
graduate career and graduated 10- 170 t- 340. At such a bawlout average
most of us can but sigh.
