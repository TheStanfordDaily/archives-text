# The 						Bull session
## OUR OWN PLAN 
### 
William Randolph Hearst's offer of
a $25,000 prize for the best plan to
repeal Prohibition is the publisher's,
most constructive move since ho made
the Spanish-American War a suc
cess. A plan to repeal Prohibition will
require ingenuity. We predict that tlie
winner will earn his money.
Now that the Durant enforcement
plan contest is concluded, we rise to
inquire just why there should be so
much furore of late regarding enforce
ment, for the Eighteenth Amendment
is now being enforced quite effective
ly, with the result that people who
don't want liquor can't get it, and
them as do, can. What more could
law-abiding citizens ask?
The Noble Experiment was ten
years old last Tuesday, and its birth
day was observed in wet and riotous
manner throughout the country. Like
Peter Pan and the movies, Prohibi
tion will always remain in its in
fancy. Twenty years from now, if not
repealed, it will still be a Noble and
Unsuccessful Experiment.
Prohibition will never be a success
in the United States, nor would it be
any more successful in Great Britain,
Brazil, or Omsk, Siberia, The simple
economic law of supply and demand
takes care of that. Given enough
folks who crave liquor, there will
always be enterprising gentlemen to
supply them with that liquor regard
less of mere statutes.
To cite a few geographical in
stances: In spite of the recent sham
battle of enforcement, booze is ex
pensive but easy to obtain anywhere
in New York. As for San Francisco,

j you would think tliat city never heard
of Prohibition. Los Angeles is dry,
| and hence the natives must endure
j horrible drug store gin and drug store
| alcohol. Seattle, also dry, suffers from
j green moonshine and etherized beer,
i In the Midwest, young but non-poison
• ous corn whisky is the staple, and as
for Detroit and Chicago, we blush to
mention them. Then there is prescrip
tion liquor from your neighborhood
doctor, and, in almost any drug store,
I fairly decent port, sherry, and white
wines.
South of Market Street there are
gentlemen who become pleasantly in
sane on gasoline and milk, equal
parts. Poor little ten-year old Prohibi
j tion!
| Major Chester Mills, prize-winner
|in the Durant contest, suggested cut
ting off the liquor supply at its
source. Now we have a personal plan
for enforcing Prohibition which we
consider vastly superior to the Mills
Plan. We suggest cutting off the des
tination, as follows:
Since fifty per cent of us are en
gaged in some manner in liquor traf
fic, let the entire population of the
United States walk through a turn
stile, which, by automatic means, will
shoot every other citizen. Suppose,
however, that some of those who es
cape are violators? Simple—just re
peat the process over and over again
until only one man is left.
When the last man shoots himself,
Prohibition enforcement will be a suc
cess. We consider this plan worth
anyhow $25,000, and if we can get the
$25,000 we shall devote it to laying in
an ample supply of bonded stuff.

William Randolph Hearst's offer of
a $25,000 prize for the best plan to
repeal Prohibition is the publisher's,
most constructive move since ho made
the Spanish-American War a suc
cess. A plan to repeal Prohibition will
require ingenuity. We predict that tlie
winner will earn his money.
Now that the Durant enforcement
plan contest is concluded, we rise to
inquire just why there should be so
much furore of late regarding enforce
ment, for the Eighteenth Amendment
is now being enforced quite effective
ly, with the result that people who
don't want liquor can't get it, and
them as do, can. What more could
law-abiding citizens ask?
The Noble Experiment was ten
years old last Tuesday, and its birth
day was observed in wet and riotous
manner throughout the country. Like
Peter Pan and the movies, Prohibi
tion will always remain in its in
fancy. Twenty years from now, if not
repealed, it will still be a Noble and
Unsuccessful Experiment.
Prohibition will never be a success
in the United States, nor would it be
any more successful in Great Britain,
Brazil, or Omsk, Siberia, The simple
economic law of supply and demand
takes care of that. Given enough
folks who crave liquor, there will
always be enterprising gentlemen to
supply them with that liquor regard
less of mere statutes.
To cite a few geographical in
stances: In spite of the recent sham
battle of enforcement, booze is ex
pensive but easy to obtain anywhere
in New York. As for San Francisco,

j you would think tliat city never heard
of Prohibition. Los Angeles is dry,
| and hence the natives must endure
j horrible drug store gin and drug store
| alcohol. Seattle, also dry, suffers from
j green moonshine and etherized beer,
i In the Midwest, young but non-poison
• ous corn whisky is the staple, and as
for Detroit and Chicago, we blush to
mention them. Then there is prescrip
tion liquor from your neighborhood
doctor, and, in almost any drug store,
I fairly decent port, sherry, and white
wines.
South of Market Street there are
gentlemen who become pleasantly in
sane on gasoline and milk, equal
parts. Poor little ten-year old Prohibi
j tion!
| Major Chester Mills, prize-winner
|in the Durant contest, suggested cut
ting off the liquor supply at its
source. Now we have a personal plan
for enforcing Prohibition which we
consider vastly superior to the Mills
Plan. We suggest cutting off the des
tination, as follows:
Since fifty per cent of us are en
gaged in some manner in liquor traf
fic, let the entire population of the
United States walk through a turn
stile, which, by automatic means, will
shoot every other citizen. Suppose,
however, that some of those who es
cape are violators? Simple—just re
peat the process over and over again
until only one man is left.
When the last man shoots himself,
Prohibition enforcement will be a suc
cess. We consider this plan worth
anyhow $25,000, and if we can get the
$25,000 we shall devote it to laying in
an ample supply of bonded stuff.
