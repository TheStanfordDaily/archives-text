Mr. Blue. By Miles Connolly. (New
York: The MacMillan Co. 1928.)
If Sir Galahad were plopped down
in the middle of New York, his pure
soul would undoubtedly ho immense
ly depressed by noise and pushing
and traffic jams. But Mi". Blue, a 20th ,
century Sir Galahad, solves such a
predicament far more neatly than the
original ever would have; for Mr. |
Blue has as much ingenuity as good- j
ness. He situates himself as a tenant '
on the roof of a thirty-story Broadway
sky-scraper, and thus escapes the
city's mad confusion.
Mr. Connolly has created a hero
better than any mere seeker after a
legendary Grail. Mr. Blue has a very
definite purpose; he believes that
nothing matters except saving his
own soul, and making others noble \
and amiable.
After a page or so it is ten to one
than the reader will suspect he is j
being preached at, and mentally re-!
solve to throw the book aside at the J
end of the first chapter. But it is also '■
an equally good bet that he will finish \
the book in spite of himself. For Mr. i
Connolly is no ordinary idealistic
story-teller. Mr. Blue is no ordinary
romantic vagabond. He has youth,
health, charm, and dreams. They are
fascinating dreams —audacious —even
fantastic. One will want to read
slowely, and more than once, the |
pages where he tells his dreams.
The story of Mr .Blue is told in
the first person by a man who is al
most the hero's direct antithesis. One
priceless line spoken by him gives the
gist of his character, "Blue is right,
next to a good bank account, happi
ness is the greatest thing in the
world." He throws into vivid relief
all the qualities that make Mr. Blue
so lovable with his utter improvi- j
dence and boundles, carefree exhuber- j,
ance. ■ 1
The story is too sentimental, but !
that can be overlooked. What counts !
is the graceful, original, and stimu
lating pen of Mr. Connolly which is
responsible for a fascinating little
story that goes deep in places.

ly depressed by noise and pushing
and traffic jams. But Mi". Blue, a 20th ,
century Sir Galahad, solves such a
predicament far more neatly than the
original ever would have; for Mr. |
Blue has as much ingenuity as good- j
ness. He situates himself as a tenant '
on the roof of a thirty-story Broadway
sky-scraper, and thus escapes the
city's mad confusion.
Mr. Connolly has created a hero
better than any mere seeker after a
legendary Grail. Mr. Blue has a very
definite purpose; he believes that
nothing matters except saving his
own soul, and making others noble \
and amiable.
After a page or so it is ten to one
than the reader will suspect he is j
being preached at, and mentally re-!
solve to throw the book aside at the J
end of the first chapter. But it is also '■
an equally good bet that he will finish \
the book in spite of himself. For Mr. i
Connolly is no ordinary idealistic
story-teller. Mr. Blue is no ordinary
romantic vagabond. He has youth,
health, charm, and dreams. They are
fascinating dreams —audacious —even
fantastic. One will want to read
slowely, and more than once, the |
pages where he tells his dreams.
The story of Mr .Blue is told in
the first person by a man who is al
most the hero's direct antithesis. One
priceless line spoken by him gives the
gist of his character, "Blue is right,
next to a good bank account, happi
ness is the greatest thing in the
world." He throws into vivid relief
all the qualities that make Mr. Blue
so lovable with his utter improvi- j
dence and boundles, carefree exhuber- j,
ance. ■ 1
The story is too sentimental, but !
that can be overlooked. What counts !
is the graceful, original, and stimu
lating pen of Mr. Connolly which is
responsible for a fascinating little
story that goes deep in places.

Francois Villon. By D. B. Wyndham ,
Lewis. (New York: Coward-Mc- (
Can. $5.00.) j
Of the Seven Deadly Sins, Francois j
Villon was held firmly in bond by at i
least five —covetousness, lust, sloth, i
gluttony, and anger. <
But these did not keep him from
writing poetry has never been <
surpassed for pure music. i
Villon lived a life unhampered by <
conventional restrictions. Paris in his <
time justly deserved the title "Gay
Paree," if the descriptions in Wynd
ham Lewis' biography of the rascal
poet are to be believed, and Villon
took full advantage of the opportuni
ties to engage in that pastime which
was not aptly named until the twenty
eighth year of the twentieth century
—"making whoopee."
All this is set forth in considerable
detail in the first authoritative work i
about this half-legendary figure whose
poetry haunts us with its rhythm and j
melody. j f
There are copious footnote transla-1 j
tions in the book, but with one or two \

exceptions they fail to capture the
spirit of the originals.
The fifteenth century French,
though well worth struggling through,
is rather incomprehensible to those
of us who learned our French in high
school (or college) because Villon
just didn't have that sort of vocabu
lary, and some of it, written in the
jargon of the time, defies even the
most erudite scholars, such as:
"De Paour des hurmes
Et des grumes,
Rasurez voez en droguerie
Et faierie,
Et ne sociez plus les joncs
Pour les sires qui sont si longs."
—M. S.
