BASKETBALL BOOMS
Basketball seems at last to be out
of the doldrums. Friday night's game
with the College of the Pacific was
as edifying a spectacle as any lover
of the sport could ask at this stage of
the season.
Husky Hunt has a peculiarly suc
cessful combination in Vance Faw
cett, John McCandless, and Harry
Berg or Phil Moffatt. Successful, that
is, as long as Mr. Fawcett happens to
be on hand. Fawcett was responsible
for 17 of the Cards' 34 points; he ap
pears to be about the best basketball
hope Stanford has had since Nip
McHose.
Discounting Fawcett's brilliance,
the team play was far from sloppy. It
needs a good deal of polishing yet,
but the salutary aspect of the Cards'
play is that there seems to be no
ineradicable weakness. The guarding
of Rothert and Tarapcke was strong,
the passing a little weak, perhaps, the
breaking into offense fast, and the
teamwork satisfactory.
It looks like a good season, If
poliomyelitis keeps its distance.
ALL-AMERICAN ALL-AMERICANS
It is never too late to congratulate. I
The Daily offers its paw to Don Ro- :
besky and Dynamite Post, who made 1
the all-American all-American football |
eleven. The all-American all-Americau
is a compilation of the thirteen lead
ing ail-American teams chosen. This
distilled ail-American was found by
a writer on the Los Angeles Times to
consist of:
Ends, Fesler and Phillips or Hay
craft; tackles, Pommerening and
Getto; guards, Post and Robesky;
center, Pund; backfield, Harpster,
Cagle, Strong, and Scull.
That there should be thirteen
all-Amerlcans, or, indeed even
one, is ridiculous, but to be a
member of the ail-American all-
America n is the best recognition
we know of for the fine work of
Post and Robesky.

PRAISE FOR THE STANFORD
STYLE OF TRAFFIC DIRECTING
(R. A. Cronin, in "As the Crow Flies,"
Los Angeles Herald.)
In most respects yesterday's ball
game at the Pasadena Rose Bowl was
a traffic problem. It was such at the
immediate end of the first period j
when California punted on fourth 1

down with three and one-half inches
to go.
It was such when Riegels took a
Georgia fumble in midfield and raced
toward his own goal, being finally
overhauled by his teammate, Lom, on
his own six-inch line.
It was such when Thomason dashed
! through the California stop signals
| and a myriad of Bear traffic cops in
the third quarter to score that touch-'
down which clinched the ball game.
All day long the California outfit
was troubled by stop-and-go signals,
i They evidently had it on the brain
from liill Monahan, the graduate
, manager, to Left Reynolds and Jack
! McKenzie, a couple of supernumer
aries in the negotiations for traffic
! at Pasadena.
I What young Riegels and Benny
Lom did on the football field was no
worse than Monahan and McKenzie
did to the traffic on the outside of j
the Rose Bowl.
After four or five years of the 100 !
per cent perfection of Stanford Uni- \
versity's handling of the traffic prob-,
lem in the somewhat congested Ar- 1
| royo Seco district, the University of j
j California's personally conducted ar
| rangement of the same problem was :
a disgrace to the traffic engineering I
ability of that college.
The psychological tests of the vari
ous universities indicate that the j
ordinary traffic officer is on an age
parity with a 12-year-old boy. The j
veteran traffic officers at Pasadena
yesterday were ready and willing to
co-operate with the general public, in
spite of what the psychologists might j
have diagnosed as 8-year-old persons j
who were directing the University of j
California's collegiate traffic affairs. |
For the first time in their lives the i
much psycho-maligned traffic patrol-!
men have found somebody worse off
mentally than they are weight for,
i age, etc.
| » After the patently incompetent I
, handling of the traffic jam in the
| Arroyo Seco on the part of the Uni
j versity of California as based against
! the perfect handling of such situa-;
tions by the neighboring and neigh
borly institution at Palo Alto, some
I indignant citizen, just for fun, ought
I to page President William W. Camp s ,
bell of the Berkeley institution. But
mayhap that isn't necessary. W. W. |
may have been caught in the mael-1
! strom of monoxide gas and grinding
! gears.
Anyhow, it was the traffic which
1 smothered the Golden Bears, no mat- ;
ter.
If you'll listen to me, Mr. Rose I
i Bowl from Pasadena, you'll let thr*e :
fellows from Stanford handle traffic j
after this and henceforth. And I guess
you will when all of the squawks are
! in and filed away for 1930.

ALL-AMERICAN ALL-AMERICANS
It is never too late to congratulate. I
The Daily offers its paw to Don Ro- :

the all-American all-American football |
eleven. The all-American all-Americau
is a compilation of the thirteen lead
ing ail-American teams chosen. This
distilled ail-American was found by
a writer on the Los Angeles Times to
consist of:
Ends, Fesler and Phillips or Hay
craft; tackles, Pommerening and
Getto; guards, Post and Robesky;
center, Pund; backfield, Harpster,

That there should be thirteen

PRAISE FOR THE STANFORD
STYLE OF TRAFFIC DIRECTING
(R. A. Cronin, in "As the Crow Flies,"
Los Angeles Herald.)
In most respects yesterday's ball
game at the Pasadena Rose Bowl was
a traffic problem. It was such at the
immediate end of the first period j
when California punted on fourth 1

down with three and one-half inches
to go.
It was such when Riegels took a
Georgia fumble in midfield and raced
toward his own goal, being finally
overhauled by his teammate, Lom, on
his own six-inch line.
It was such when Thomason dashed
! through the California stop signals
| and a myriad of Bear traffic cops in
the third quarter to score that touch-'
down which clinched the ball game.
All day long the California outfit
was troubled by stop-and-go signals,
i They evidently had it on the brain
from liill Monahan, the graduate
, manager, to Left Reynolds and Jack
! McKenzie, a couple of supernumer
aries in the negotiations for traffic
! at Pasadena.
I What young Riegels and Benny
Lom did on the football field was no
worse than Monahan and McKenzie
did to the traffic on the outside of j
the Rose Bowl.
After four or five years of the 100 !
per cent perfection of Stanford Uni- \
versity's handling of the traffic prob-,
lem in the somewhat congested Ar- 1
| royo Seco district, the University of j
j California's personally conducted ar
| rangement of the same problem was :
a disgrace to the traffic engineering I
ability of that college.
The psychological tests of the vari
ous universities indicate that the j
ordinary traffic officer is on an age
parity with a 12-year-old boy. The j
veteran traffic officers at Pasadena
yesterday were ready and willing to
co-operate with the general public, in
spite of what the psychologists might j
have diagnosed as 8-year-old persons j
who were directing the University of j
California's collegiate traffic affairs. |
For the first time in their lives the i
much psycho-maligned traffic patrol-!
men have found somebody worse off
mentally than they are weight for,
i age, etc.
| » After the patently incompetent I
, handling of the traffic jam in the
| Arroyo Seco on the part of the Uni
j versity of California as based against
! the perfect handling of such situa-;
tions by the neighboring and neigh
borly institution at Palo Alto, some
I indignant citizen, just for fun, ought
I to page President William W. Camp s ,
bell of the Berkeley institution. But
mayhap that isn't necessary. W. W. |
may have been caught in the mael-1
! strom of monoxide gas and grinding
! gears.
Anyhow, it was the traffic which
1 smothered the Golden Bears, no mat- ;
ter.
If you'll listen to me, Mr. Rose I
i Bowl from Pasadena, you'll let thr*e :
fellows from Stanford handle traffic j
after this and henceforth. And I guess
you will when all of the squawks are
! in and filed away for 1930.
BASKETBALL BOOMS
Basketball seems at last to be out
of the doldrums. Friday night's game
with the College of the Pacific was
as edifying a spectacle as any lover
of the sport could ask at this stage of
the season.
Husky Hunt has a peculiarly suc
cessful combination in Vance Faw
cett, John McCandless, and Harry
Berg or Phil Moffatt. Successful, that
is, as long as Mr. Fawcett happens to
be on hand. Fawcett was responsible
for 17 of the Cards' 34 points; he ap
pears to be about the best basketball
hope Stanford has had since Nip
McHose.
Discounting Fawcett's brilliance,
the team play was far from sloppy. It
needs a good deal of polishing yet,
but the salutary aspect of the Cards'
play is that there seems to be no
ineradicable weakness. The guarding
of Rothert and Tarapcke was strong,
the passing a little weak, perhaps, the
breaking into offense fast, and the
teamwork satisfactory.
It looks like a good season, If
poliomyelitis keeps its distance.

PRAISE FOR THE STANFORD
STYLE OF TRAFFIC DIRECTING
(R. A. Cronin, in "As the Crow Flies,"
Los Angeles Herald.)
In most respects yesterday's ball
game at the Pasadena Rose Bowl was
a traffic problem. It was such at the
immediate end of the first period j
when California punted on fourth 1

down with three and one-half inches
to go.
It was such when Riegels took a
Georgia fumble in midfield and raced
toward his own goal, being finally
overhauled by his teammate, Lom, on
his own six-inch line.
It was such when Thomason dashed
! through the California stop signals
| and a myriad of Bear traffic cops in
the third quarter to score that touch-'
down which clinched the ball game.
All day long the California outfit
was troubled by stop-and-go signals,
i They evidently had it on the brain
from liill Monahan, the graduate
, manager, to Left Reynolds and Jack
! McKenzie, a couple of supernumer
aries in the negotiations for traffic
! at Pasadena.
I What young Riegels and Benny
Lom did on the football field was no
worse than Monahan and McKenzie
did to the traffic on the outside of j
the Rose Bowl.
After four or five years of the 100 !
per cent perfection of Stanford Uni- \
versity's handling of the traffic prob-,
lem in the somewhat congested Ar- 1
| royo Seco district, the University of j
j California's personally conducted ar
| rangement of the same problem was :
a disgrace to the traffic engineering I
ability of that college.
The psychological tests of the vari
ous universities indicate that the j
ordinary traffic officer is on an age
parity with a 12-year-old boy. The j
veteran traffic officers at Pasadena
yesterday were ready and willing to
co-operate with the general public, in
spite of what the psychologists might j
have diagnosed as 8-year-old persons j
who were directing the University of j
California's collegiate traffic affairs. |
For the first time in their lives the i
much psycho-maligned traffic patrol-!
men have found somebody worse off
mentally than they are weight for,
i age, etc.
| » After the patently incompetent I
, handling of the traffic jam in the
| Arroyo Seco on the part of the Uni
j versity of California as based against
! the perfect handling of such situa-;
tions by the neighboring and neigh
borly institution at Palo Alto, some
I indignant citizen, just for fun, ought
I to page President William W. Camp s ,
bell of the Berkeley institution. But
mayhap that isn't necessary. W. W. |
may have been caught in the mael-1
! strom of monoxide gas and grinding
! gears.
Anyhow, it was the traffic which
1 smothered the Golden Bears, no mat- ;
ter.
If you'll listen to me, Mr. Rose I
i Bowl from Pasadena, you'll let thr*e :
fellows from Stanford handle traffic j
after this and henceforth. And I guess
you will when all of the squawks are
! in and filed away for 1930.
BASKETBALL BOOMS
Basketball seems at last to be out
of the doldrums. Friday night's game
with the College of the Pacific was
as edifying a spectacle as any lover
of the sport could ask at this stage of
the season.
Husky Hunt has a peculiarly suc
cessful combination in Vance Faw
cett, John McCandless, and Harry
Berg or Phil Moffatt. Successful, that
is, as long as Mr. Fawcett happens to
be on hand. Fawcett was responsible
for 17 of the Cards' 34 points; he ap
pears to be about the best basketball
hope Stanford has had since Nip
McHose.
Discounting Fawcett's brilliance,
the team play was far from sloppy. It
needs a good deal of polishing yet,
but the salutary aspect of the Cards'
play is that there seems to be no
ineradicable weakness. The guarding
of Rothert and Tarapcke was strong,
the passing a little weak, perhaps, the
breaking into offense fast, and the
teamwork satisfactory.
It looks like a good season, If
poliomyelitis keeps its distance.
ALL-AMERICAN ALL-AMERICANS
It is never too late to congratulate. I
The Daily offers its paw to Don Ro- :
besky and Dynamite Post, who made 1
the all-American all-American football |
eleven. The all-American all-Americau
is a compilation of the thirteen lead
ing ail-American teams chosen. This
distilled ail-American was found by
a writer on the Los Angeles Times to
consist of:
Ends, Fesler and Phillips or Hay
craft; tackles, Pommerening and
Getto; guards, Post and Robesky;
center, Pund; backfield, Harpster,
Cagle, Strong, and Scull.
That there should be thirteen
all-Amerlcans, or, indeed even
one, is ridiculous, but to be a
member of the ail-American all-
America n is the best recognition
we know of for the fine work of
Post and Robesky.
