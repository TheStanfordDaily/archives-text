# BLOCK PRINTS BY STARR ON EXHIBIT AT ART GALLERY
## 
### 
An exhibition of 27 block prints by
Judson L. Starr of San Francisco ,
opened yesterday at the Stanford Art
Gallery and will remain until Janu-1
ary 27.
The prints are printed with one
impression of black on white paper.
The strength of Mr. Starr's compo
sitions is shown in the way lie lias
cut away from the surface of the
block the parts he planned to appear
white. That which is not cut away
leceives the ink which prints on the ,
white paper a contrasting black.
Mr. Starr has for some time past
been a successful illustrator in New
York. His earlier training was re
ceived at the San Francisco Institute
of Art, where he is now an instructor.
Exhibitions of his block prints have
been held in various art galleries on
the Pacific Coast.
The Stanford Art Gallery is open
every day from 10 o'clock to 5 o'clock. ;
