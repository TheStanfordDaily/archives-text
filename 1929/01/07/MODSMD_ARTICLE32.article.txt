# THE 						AGE LIMIT IN SPORTS
## 
### Feg Murray 
How long can a man or woman
keep in active participation in an ath
letic spgrt? What sport lends itself
best to "flaming age"? Eliminating
such "sports" as chess, checkers, and
cards, one would naturally expect the
"Ancient and Horrible" pastime of
golf to produce both the widest range
of age and the oldest competitors.
Bobby Jones was breaking 70 when
he was 13, and there is no reason why
he shouldn't still be a star player at
S3, which is a longer possible span
of playing years than any other sport
can show. John Ball, that great Brit

| ish amateur, finished sixth in the
; open championship when he was 15,
and won the amateur title for the
I eighth time thirty-four years later! A
foursome once played at Musselburgh
with the aggregate ages of the play- ,
; ers 340 years. The individual ages
I were 89, 80, 86, and 85. C. B. Kessing, ;
| of Cincinnati, mfl.de a hole in one in
1927, at the age of 83.
Now for tennis. Tilden, fading at
35, can still be a player at 70. (I hope
he doesn't grow a beard!) King Gus
tav of Sweden plays doubles on the
Riviera every winter, and he is 70. j

He plays a fair game, too. The late i
Lord Balfour played when he was 70.
Plenty of youngsters are stars at 15
• nowadays, and there is no reason ;
why a person should not enjoy court
, competition for a span of 50 or 55
years. "Ma" Bundy is still winning
; tournaments, and she was Wimble- j
don champion (as May Sutton) hack
in 1904. Likewise, Mrs. Hazel Hotch
kiss Wightman, who was United
States champion in 1909.
It is surprising how long wrestlers
last. Poddubney and Zbyszko met in
' a terrific mat encounter in 1906, and

: again twenty years later. Ever hear
; of Milo of Crotona, hero of six Olym
piads, undefeated at wrestling for
nearly twenty-five years? Some boxers
enjoy great longevity; others go out
j like a light after one or two hectic
! years. Thirty years elapsed between
I Bob Fitzsimmons' first victory in New
Zealand and his last fight with Bill
Lang. Hans Wagner, a star in 1897,
| can still play a mean game of base
ball. Jim Thorpe is still trying to play
loot ball, though 'way past his prime.
Marathon runners seem to improve
with age.

How long can a man or woman
keep in active participation in an ath

of age and the oldest competitors.
Bobby Jones was breaking 70 when
he was 13, and there is no reason why
he shouldn't still be a star player at
S3, which is a longer possible span
of playing years than any other sport

I eighth time thirty-four years later! A
