# FRESHMAN FIVE DEFEATS PACIFIC YEARLINGS, 36-32
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
: team got off to a good start in their
1 first game of the season last Friday
night in the Cardinal pavilion when
they trounced the College of Pacific
yearlings, 36-22.
At no time during the contest were
the visitors ahead in the scoring. The
Stanford freshmen led by the sub
! stantial margin of 23 to 4 at the half.
Considering the short length of
! time the Cardinal frosh have been
| practicing together as a team, their
showing was satisfactory, particu
larly on the defensive.
High point honors went to Van
Dyke, flashy Stockton guard, who gar
nered ten tallies, with Bill Doub,
Stanford center, a close second with
nine. Ray and Kelly proved a speedy
forward combination for the Cardi
nals. llintala and Baker worked well
together on the defense, Rintala col
lecting eight points and Baker seven.
The Stanford team's principal
weakness seemed to be in its substi
i lutes, since none of the six reserves
who entered the game measured up
to the ability of the regulars.
