NEW YORK, Jan. 6. (/P)â€” Swept by
sharp winds, tke South tonight was
shivering in sub-freezing tempera
tures, except along the Atlantic
Coast, with prospects of record low
marks for the season by dawn of to
morrow.
Even along the Atlantic seaboard,
from Norfolk, Va., as far south as
Charleston, S.C., freezing tempera
tures were expected tomorrow, as
strong winds whipped across from
the West.
