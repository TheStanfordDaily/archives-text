# ARMY PLANE CONTINUES IN LONG FLIGHT
## Passes All Official Records in Endurance Flights After 127 Hours 
### 
METROPOLITAN AIRPORT, Los
Angeles, Jan. 5. (JP) â€”The crew of the
Question Mark, surpassing all known
endurance flight records, sailed the
big army refueling plane on tonight
after passing the 130-hour mark at
5:26:46 P.M.
As night closed in on the big plane,
it swung in a narrow circle about the
airport, never out of sight of those
on the ground. Humming evenly, the
motors which caused the crew con
stant worry last night, began the
sixth night aloft without a sputter to
mar their steady song.
The clouds that overcast the sky
early today were gone tonight and
clear air was seen as a boon to the
flyers' success tonight.
Missing cylinders in the three
motors with which the giant army
Fokker is powered, last night threat
ened to force the plane to earth, and
at least once brought from Major
Carl Spatz, commander of the flight,
an order for all members of the crew
to take their posts and prepare for
the final glide to the airport. For more
than seven hours the ship was kept
at an elevation of 4,000 feet and with
in gliding distance of the field, pre
pared for a forced landing, but short
ly after 1 P.M., the ailing engines ap
parently were readjusted, for the
Question Mark took on a heavy load
of gasoline and began a more coura
geous flight which took in the entire
San Fernando valley.
It was unofficially estimated shortly
after noon today that the Question
Mark had flown 8,800 miles.
