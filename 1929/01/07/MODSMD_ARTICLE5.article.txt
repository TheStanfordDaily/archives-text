the latter part of this week. The ;
matches are to be played on the ;
courts of the Peninsula Athletic Club, j
since Stanford has no four-wall court, j
Practically all of last year's varsity
has graduated, according to John Sau- j
ter, handball manager, so Stanford is :
facing one of its longest and most in
teresting schedules with an inexperi- |
enced team. Sauter has already en
gaged meets with five outside teams,
and negotiations are now under way
for a tournament to be held in San
Francisco with California, Southern
California, and University of Califor
nia at Los Angeles. This tournament
would be held during the first part
of April.
The five matches already arranged j

ary 14; Athens Club at Oakland,

sity are eligible to enter the tourney j
now being started, according to Sau- I
ter, and the varsity team will be j

gible for competition.
"The present tourney," says Sauter,
"is to be a round-robin —every player \
meeting every other player, thereby j
giving a maximum of play to the in- |
, experienced men and compensating
for an 'off' day."
Twenty-four men have already ,
signed up for the tourney on the |
sheet which is posted in Encina gym.
The varsity team will probably be j
composed of six men and one alter- ,
nate.

above dates are tentative only, and
may vary a day either way.
All men registered in the Univer- j
sity are eligible to enter the tourney j
now being started, according to Sau- I
ter, and the varsity team will be j
chosen from the winners who are eli
gible for competition.
"The present tourney," says Sauter,
"is to be a round-robin —every player \
meeting every other player, thereby j
giving a maximum of play to the in- |
, experienced men and compensating
for an 'off' day."
Twenty-four men have already ,
signed up for the tourney on the |
sheet which is posted in Encina gym.
The varsity team will probably be j
composed of six men and one alter- ,
nate.
