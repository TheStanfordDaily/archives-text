# QUESTION MARK, SIX DAYS IN AIR, MAKES LANDING
## Army Plane Falters After More Than 150 Hours of Record-Breaking Cruise 
### 
METROPOLITAN AIRPORT, LOS
ANGELES, Jan. 7. (/P) â€”The army's
endurance flight plane, the Question
Mark, glided to a perfect landing here
at 2:07:01 o'clock this afternoon after
an historic and record-smashing flight
of 150 hours, 40 minutes, and 15 sec
onds. The ship had been in the air
continuously for six nights and nearly
seven days following its take-off here
on New Year's morning at 7:26:46
o'clock.
The end of one of the greatest
flights in all aviation history came
after a crew of five weary men had
fought constantly against time and
motors which piled trouble in a heap
upon them an hour before the landing.
Thirty hours before their work
seemed near an end when the motors
balked, but it cleared away and the
fight went on. This time, as though
in protest to the great strain placed
upon them, the motors stuttered, one
went "dead" and with another rapid
ly failing, they forced the nose of the
ship earthward.

Two thousand people who swarmed
about the airport cheered wildly as
the plane taxied across the field.
About the field scores of army of
ficers Went into wild demonstrations
of delight at the unheard-of record
which the plane had set up.

In its flight the Question Mark es
tablished itself as the longest flying
aircraft, either dirigible or airplane,
in aviation annals. The longest air
plane flight on record, that accom
plished in Germany by Risticz and
Zimmerman, was outdistanced by 85
hours, although the German mark
was accomplished without refueling.
