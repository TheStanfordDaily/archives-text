### 
Two opera plots out of 14 handed
in have been selected by the Junior
Opera Committee, according to Griff
Williams, chairman. "Moving On," a
story of circus life, written by Laird
Doyle, John Paul Jones, and Jim
Webb, is one, and "Louisian," involv
ing a New Orleans Mardi Gras, by
Bob Speers and Carroll O'Meara.
The final selection of the Opera
will be made January 20, so the first
acts of these operas must be in by
that date. The turnout this year was
unusually good, almost twice as many
plots being handed in as usual. All
of them were excellent, according to
Williams; the two chosen are of un
usual calibre, and have excellent op
portunities for humor and songs.
