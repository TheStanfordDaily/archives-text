An Authority on Russia •
Professor Golder had been at Stan
ford since 1921 and was the recog
nized American authority in his field |
of Russian history. He was born in (
Russia in 1877, came to the United
States three years later, was gradu- i
ated from Harvard in 1903, and re
ceived his Ph.D. in 1909. He had
studied much in Russia before the
World War began, and since early in
the War he had annually made trips j

. to that country for purposes of study 1
and of the collection of historical
| documents. In 1917 he was engaged j
in investigation in the Russian arch
ives for the Carnegie Institution and
the American Geographical Society;
from 1917 to 1919 he was a member
of tlie staff of the Colonel House Com
mission of Inquiry; and from 1920 to
1923 he was a member of the Ameri
can Relief Administration, doing spe-j
cial work in Europe, as an associate j
! of Herbert Hoover and as a collector!
: for the Hoover Wan Library.
Collector of Documents
With Professors Ralph H. Lutz and !
Ephraim D. Adams, Professor Colder
j was responsible for the gathering of
j materials for the Hoover Library, and
j chiefly as a result of his labors that |
library contains the greatest collec
i tion of material on the Russian Revo- 1
lution of any library outside of Rus- j
sia.
Tribute to Dr. Golder was yester
day paid by Professor Ralph H. Lutz,
who said: "Dr. Golder, apart from
| his scholarly work in the field of his
tory, was one of the greatest collec
tors of historical documents of the
| War period. His work for the Hoover
I War Library is a permanent monu
! ment to his memory."
! President Wilbur said: "Dr. Golder
! has done unique work in connection
j with his Russian studies. He was one
, of the most productive men in the
I University, being engaged in writing
I a number of books in various fields.
: Tlio most interesting thing about him
i; was his doing things for other people.
He had a very fine personality."
. Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor: "Professor
Golder was the most outstanding au
r! thority on Russian history in the
' United States. He had been in con
. tinuous contact with Russia since
■ early in the War, having gone in
there every year."
Work Unfinished
At the time he was taken ill, Dr.
. Golder was just bringing his work to
fruition, and he had an extensive pro
. gram of work made out, a portion of
which, according to Professor Lutz,
• one of his most intimate friends on
the faculty, will be carried out by his
, friends.
Among Professor Golder's personal
qualities were a love of music, of
which he was rated a good critic, a
penchant for collecting objects of art,
some of which are now in the Stan
| ford Museum, and a fondness for the
! out-of-doors. His literary ability was
| not devoted solely to history, but was
| recently put to the writing of Christ
. ! mas stories, which he sent privately
. j to his friends at Christmas-time. His
' ; published works are: "Russian Ex
pansion on the Pacific" (1914);
I "Guide to the Materials for American
■ I History in Russian Archives" (1917);
1 | "Bering's Voyages" (1922); "John
Paul Jones in Russia" (1927); "On
• the Trail of the Russian Famine"
■ (with Lincoln Hutchinson: 1927); and
"Documents of Russian History"
: (1928). He was also co-author, with
three others, of "The Russian Revo
lution," and he edited Platonov's
"History of Russia."
Was a Sigma Chi
Professor Golder was a member of
the American Historical Association,
i Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa Phi, and
• of the Harvard Club of Boston and
the Cosmos Club of Washington.
He was professor of history suc
! cessively at the University of Mis
souri, Boston University, the Univer
sity of Chicago, and the State College
| of Washington.
