# STANFORD BABES WILL MEET GAEL CAGERS TONIGHT
## Ray, Kelly, Doub, Rintala And Baker May Start Against Visitors 
### 
Coach James "Rabbit" Bradshaw,
Cardinal freshman cage mentor, will
send his charges into their second
game of the season tonight when they
clash with the yearling five of St.
Mary's College in the Stanford Pavil
ion. The game will be a preliminary
to the varsity contest and will begin
at 6:45 o'clock.
Following their showing in the Col
lege of Pacific game last Friday,
which they won 36 to 22, Coach Brad
shaw is enthusiastic over the Cardi
nal babes' chances, although he is
not expecting easy going against the
speedy Gael youngsters.
"The team was playing over its
head last Friday," says Bradshaw,
"and I look for a let-down tonight.
Considering the short length of time
they have been practicing together,
1 am more than satisfied with their
progress."
The probable starting lineup for to
night's game is Kelly and Ray, for
wards, Doub, center, Baker and Rin
tala, guards. This is the lineup which
worked best against the Pacific year
lings and has been showing the most
speed in practice. James Shrader, for
mer Los Angeles ail-city forward,
may start in the place of Ray or
Kelly, however, if he is found to be
eligible.
