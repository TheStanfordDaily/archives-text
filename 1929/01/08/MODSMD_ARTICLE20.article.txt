# DESTINY OF LATE LEAVES DECIDED TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
j Whether or not the granting of
11:30 o'clock leaves should continue
to be automatic, will be decided at a
meeting of Women's Conference held
at 7 o'clock tomorrow. The announce- I
ment was made yesterday by Janet
Harris, president of Associated Wo
men Students.
S The system of granting automatic
! late leaves was on trial during the
i fall quarter. By this method freshmen
j were given two late-leaves a quarter
to be taken at any time they desired;
sophomores were grantedâ€”four, junior
six, and seniors eight. The system
formerly used was that of telephon
ing to a member of Women's Council
|to obtain the desired 11:30 leave dur
ing the week. Under the newer meth
|od, the women signed out in their
! living group books, receiving auto
jmatic late leave.
The approval of Dean Yost and
I President Wilbur will be necessary
before the new method could go into
j effect, provided that Women's Con
' ference decides tomorrow to continue
i under the system.
