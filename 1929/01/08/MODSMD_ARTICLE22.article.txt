# CARDINAL SQUAD READY FOR GAEL QUINTET TONIGHT
## Stanford Favored to Down Moragans; Fawcett, Berg To Lead Redshirt Attack 
### ANSON REEDER 
Five Galloping Gaels from Moraga
will take the floor tonight in the
; Pavilion against one of the best Stan
ford basketball teams seen here in
several seasons. The contest will be
gin at 8 o'clock following a prelimi
nary game between the Card and St.
Mary's first-year men.
j Coach Husky Hunt put his men
J through a stiff workout yesterday af
-1 ternoon in preparation for tonight's
battle. Although the Redshirts are
favored to win, they realize that St.
| Mary's, as in past years, will present
j a fighting aggregation. Tazer is the
| kingpin of the visitors' offense, being
; responsible for a third of the points
! scored so far this season. A fast
breaking five-man arrangement built
around Pitchford, of Moragan foot
ball fame, has been the feature of
their defense.
Cards' Chances Greater
i With the steady improvement in
I teamwork, and the return of Rey
; nolds, last year's babe captain, to
: the line-up, chances for a Cardinal
j year have taken a decided leap. In
I Captain Rothert, Tampcke, and Rey
nolds, Coach Hunt has three stellar
performers from which to pick his
guard combination. At center Me-
Candless has had first call so far this
season, but Hears showed his depend
ability in the College of Pacific game
Friday night when he replaced Me
i Candless who had been disqualified
for having committed four personal
fouls.
Berg, Fawcett Clever
Berg and Fawcett have led the
i Stanford attack so far this season,
i Although both are good shots and
fast, and capable of good floor work,
it has been their teamwork on the
| offensive end of the court that has
brought joy to Card supporters. Last
j Friday night in the Pacific game,
when Berg saw that Fawcett had his
j eye on the basket, he fed the ball to
! his running mate every time he saw
that Fawcett was open.
In the YMI game the situation was
reversed, and Fawcett fed the ball to
i Berg every time the opportunity pre
sented itself. But choosing his start
• ers for the two forward positions still
remains Coach Hunt's biggest prob
| lem, for besides Berg and Fawcett,
he has such men as Moffatt, Hawkins,
Loomis, and Sexton on reserve.
Conference Game Saturday
The first conference game of the
season with UCLA will be played
■ here Saturday night, and from all in
-1 dications should be a whirlwind affair.
But Stanford, according to Coach
Hunt, is not pointing to this game
until after the battle tonight. "We're
taking them as they come," was his
comment.

nary game between the Card and St.
Mary's first-year men.
j Coach Husky Hunt put his men
J through a stiff workout yesterday af
-1 ternoon in preparation for tonight's
battle. Although the Redshirts are
favored to win, they realize that St.
| Mary's, as in past years, will present
j a fighting aggregation. Tazer is the
| kingpin of the visitors' offense, being
; responsible for a third of the points
! scored so far this season. A fast
breaking five-man arrangement built
around Pitchford, of Moragan foot
ball fame, has been the feature of
their defense.
Cards' Chances Greater
i With the steady improvement in
I teamwork, and the return of Rey
; nolds, last year's babe captain, to
: the line-up, chances for a Cardinal
j year have taken a decided leap. In
I Captain Rothert, Tampcke, and Rey
nolds, Coach Hunt has three stellar
performers from which to pick his
guard combination. At center Me-
Candless has had first call so far this
season, but Hears showed his depend
ability in the College of Pacific game
Friday night when he replaced Me
i Candless who had been disqualified
for having committed four personal
fouls.
Berg, Fawcett Clever
Berg and Fawcett have led the
i Stanford attack so far this season,
i Although both are good shots and
fast, and capable of good floor work,
it has been their teamwork on the
| offensive end of the court that has
brought joy to Card supporters. Last
j Friday night in the Pacific game,
when Berg saw that Fawcett had his
j eye on the basket, he fed the ball to
! his running mate every time he saw
that Fawcett was open.
In the YMI game the situation was
reversed, and Fawcett fed the ball to
i Berg every time the opportunity pre
sented itself. But choosing his start
• ers for the two forward positions still
remains Coach Hunt's biggest prob
| lem, for besides Berg and Fawcett,
he has such men as Moffatt, Hawkins,
Loomis, and Sexton on reserve.
Conference Game Saturday
The first conference game of the
season with UCLA will be played
■ here Saturday night, and from all in
-1 dications should be a whirlwind affair.
But Stanford, according to Coach
Hunt, is not pointing to this game
until after the battle tonight. "We're
taking them as they come," was his
comment.
