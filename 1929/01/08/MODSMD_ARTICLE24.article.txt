# Dr. Golder's Death
## 
### 
Dr. Golder was the foremost American authority on Russian history.
That fact alone made him invaluable as a professor of history at Stanford,
but he had other qualifications and qualities which make his death a serious
loss to the faculty. He had an inspiring personality, and on account of it
he was admired and esteemed by the students whom he taught. His contri
bution to Stanford was measurable, though, not alone in contacts with
Undergraduates, but also in the accretion of Hoover War Library material
which he left. Professor Lutz, his colleague and one of his closest friends,
said yesterday that the importance of Dr. Golder's collection of documents
pertaining to Russia during the World War could not be overemphasized.
He was a historian of the foremost rank, a man of world-wide acquaint
ances, and the fortunate possessor of a genial and kindly nature. Be
cause he had so intimate a knowledge of Russia during her period of change
from autocracy to Sovietism, the gap made by his loss probably can never
be filled.
