# Living Up to a Great Tradition

The name of Joseph Pulitzer is one of the few great names of Ameri
can journalism, and although its bearer died seventeen years ago, it is still
remembered by the general public through the annual Pulitzer prizes and
the Pulitzer School of Journalism at Columbia. The newspaper man rec
ognizes Pulitzer as at once the originator of an aggressive journalism which
was devoted to the public interest, and the founder of two of the best
dailies in the United States, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the New
York World.
The Post-Dispatch, Pulitzer's first paper, celebrated on December 9
its fiftieth anniversary by issuing an edition of more than 200 pages. This
edition is a most admirable example of what a newspaper can be, and while
not many hereabouts will see it, there is every good reason to comment upon
the fine record which the Post-Dispatch has made and which it so fittingly
celebrates. Certainly there is no paper west of St. Louis that compares
with the P.-D., and many are of the opinion that none east of that city is
better. The Post-Dispatch has from the start fought for the public interest.
Its most recent accomplishment of national importance was the incessant
demand made by it to investigate Teapot Dome. It ever headed the public's
case for the prosecution of the oil scandals. Senator Norris has called it
"the Manchester Guardian of America."
Joseph Pulitzer wanted his paper always to "lead, lead, lead," and it has
led always. While most newspapers have fine mottoes, the Post-Dispatch
is distinguished by living up to its platform, which was written by Pulitzer
when he retired, and is as follows:
"I know that my retirement will make no difference in its cardi
nal principles; that it will always fight for progress and reform,
never tolerate injustice or corruption, always fight demagogues of
all parties, never belong to any party, always oppose privileged
classes and public plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor,
always remain devoted to the public welfare, never be satisfied with
merely printing news; always be drastically independent; never be
afraid to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or preda
tory poverty."
