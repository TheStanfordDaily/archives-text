# Rickard Was a Peculiar Figure

"They'll never get me with their bowie knives. They can shoot me, but
they can't cut me." In such words Tex Rickard, the late boxing impresario,
is said to have summed up his abhorrence of the surgical knife, which was
at length applied to him too late. Rickard was the greatest showman of
our time; he elevated a one-horse, two-by-four, back-alley sport to a great
industry which made millions for him and for two of its greatest exponents.
Yet with all his worldly wisdom Rickard persisted in several idiosyncrasies,
like the anti-bowie knife complex. For example, he never budgeted the
cost of promoting a big fight. He simply gathered in the money, counted it,
paid his bills, and put the (almost) never-failing balance in the bank. The
reason he usually cleaned up on his big fistic battles was that he consciously
catered to "the best people." When the 400 started going to his fights,
twenty-seven-dollar seats were saleable.
The fighting profession will take a drop, they say, as a result of Rick
ard's death. Consequently, it is not unlikely that there will be a boom in
the popularity of other sports—perhaps in professional tennis, quite likely
in baseball, and undoubtedly in football.
