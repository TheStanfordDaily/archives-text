(From an articlc by Dr. Wilbur, quoted in What the Colleges Are Doing)
The fact that a higher percentage of students is succeeding in the Uni
versity than ever before means that our student body is more stable. The
floater, the idler, the drifter, the bounder, and the boozer are running a
shorter course each year. Ninety per cent of our students are attending to
their business and succeeding with their work. A certain proportion of the
time of these is needed to keep the five or ten per cent from making a
nuisance of themselves and to keep them from hurting the good name of
the University. Personally I have full confidence in our present group of
students. They are going ahead, chasing some false gods, no doubt, but on
the whole looking each situation in the face, analyzing its strengths and its
weaknesses, and making the necessary decisions as to what they shall do
or not do. The great majority of them are acquiring thase steady habits
of work which form the basis of success and satisfaction in life. The world
forgives a great deal in the man who is a worker and who contributes to the
general welfare. The University overlooks much when its work is well
done and when there is evidence that the student is advancing and growing.

There will be a meeting of the editorial staff at 1:00 o'clock today.
