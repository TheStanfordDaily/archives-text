### MAN'S WINGS 
No lusty youngster ever grew out
of three-cornered pants with more
rapidity than did aviation. Now in its
twenty-sixth year, it celebrates with
a six-day, six-night spree; that is to
say, an aircraft, dubbed Question
Mark, soared into space Wednesday
morning with the intent of shattering
endurance flight records of all time
and returned to earth yesterday after
noon. One hundred fifty-one hours of
sustained flight had been made pos
sible by a new refueling device. Here
is another step in the growth of the
youngster.
This feat assumed the proportions
of a conflict, man versus machine,
with man winning which ever way
the battle turned. The crew outlasted
the motor, yet had the motor endured
longer than the crew, man would still
be the winner by reason of having
built the machine.
While Wilbur Wright grabbed off
the Kitty Hawk in a great huff and

sailed to London because the Smith
sonian Institute credited S. P. Lang
ley and liis Aerodrome as pioneer of
aviation, Byrd was pushing into
frozen Anarctiea, the Graf Zeppelin
had hung up a transatlantic record,
and the United States Air Mail pilots
were rolling up a five and a half mil
lion mark in miles flown during the
year. The creation of the Wright
brothers had leaped from infancy to
an adulthood that commandeered the
brains and energies of all mankind to
serve it.
Those of us who have grown up in
the life of aviation will live to board
an airliner at supper and expect to
be served breakfast in London, Tokyo,
Buenos Aires, or whatever place with
in the reach of half a hemisphere that
fancy directs.
More power to the crew of the
Question Mark and their ilk who, in
setting new marks and making new
achievements, will bring that day
when transportation will become a
thing of the air. â€”Calvin D. Wood.
