To The Pure .... A Study of Ob
scenity and the Censor. By Morris
L. Ernst and William Seagle.
(New York: The Viking Press,
1928.)
"Obscenity is only a superstition
of the day—the modern counterpart
of ancient witchcraft." And after
reading this immensely interesting
book you will either agree with the
authors or else you will be stranded
on a thickly populated island between
traditionally intolerant conceptions
and intellectual tolerance.
The authors first tear down and
show the absolutely vague meanings
of the "six deadly adjectives" which
are the basis of all censorship—ob
scene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, inde
cent, and disgusting. Then they pro
ceed to show the comparatively nar
row limits within which definite
statutes can and should be effective
ly employed.
A host of related problems is dis
cussed. "What are the standards and
tests which determine the obscene?
Is it only a matter of fashion? What
effect does obscenity have on society?
Can lewdness be regulated by statute?
What is the function of the obscenity
laws in modern society? What is their
history?"
Many people will read this book
merely to find out what books are ob
scene, and what passages in the Bible
and in Shakespeare are not "fit" to
read. Others will get real value out of
it, and set it down having obtained
fuller conceptions of tolerance and
; hearty distaste for the delusions of
hysterical "pure literature" cam
paigns.
The book closes, "The yearning for
a fuller life has always been thwarted
by the passion of the censor. We may
speculate that eating and hunger in
the early days of the race were the
front trenches of suppression. As
' man attained the right to all foods
the taboo shifted to religion. To pre
vent fresh views on spiritual matters
libraries were destroyed and thou
sands of Brunos were burned at the
stake. Furthermoi-e, the regimenta
tion of the people could not continue
if free thought on matters of state

I were permitted. To whisper about the
| King became sedition. The censor's
i ax was swung with violence.
Food, religion, the state —then sex.
What next? Will those who want to
control the thoughts and emotions of
others shift to new unleavened realms
of taste and aesthetics? Are we at
| the dawn of an era when the word
, "obscene" will be replaced by "un
aesthetic," "lewd" by "in poor taste"?

To The Pure .... A Study of Ob
scenity and the Censor. By Morris
L. Ernst and William Seagle.
(New York: The Viking Press,
1928.)
"Obscenity is only a superstition
of the day—the modern counterpart
of ancient witchcraft." And after
reading this immensely interesting
book you will either agree with the
authors or else you will be stranded
on a thickly populated island between
traditionally intolerant conceptions
and intellectual tolerance.
The authors first tear down and
show the absolutely vague meanings
of the "six deadly adjectives" which
are the basis of all censorship—ob
scene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, inde
cent, and disgusting. Then they pro
ceed to show the comparatively nar
row limits within which definite
statutes can and should be effective
ly employed.
A host of related problems is dis
cussed. "What are the standards and
tests which determine the obscene?
Is it only a matter of fashion? What
effect does obscenity have on society?
Can lewdness be regulated by statute?
What is the function of the obscenity
laws in modern society? What is their
history?"
Many people will read this book
merely to find out what books are ob
scene, and what passages in the Bible
and in Shakespeare are not "fit" to
read. Others will get real value out of
it, and set it down having obtained
fuller conceptions of tolerance and
; hearty distaste for the delusions of
hysterical "pure literature" cam
paigns.
The book closes, "The yearning for
a fuller life has always been thwarted
by the passion of the censor. We may
speculate that eating and hunger in
the early days of the race were the
front trenches of suppression. As
