"Gay Paree" —Curran.
Glorified vaudeville with nothing
Parisian except the way some of the
j girls are undressed. This third edi
i tion of the Schuberts' "sextravagan
za" is all new. Like its predecessors,
the 1029 "Gay Paree" features a big
chorus, much low comedy, and Chic
j Sale.
If you haven't seen Chic Sale, don't
miss this opportunity. His impersona
: tions of rural types are unequalled—
i like Elsie Janis he apparently lives
the person he is characterizing. He
has a generous number of sketches in
: this year's show. In "The Country
> School" act, wherein he takes off the
school teacher and the boy and girl
speakers at a school entertainment, he
is marvelous. And as the undertaker
' who subs for the minister in "The
j Country Church," he is equally hilari
ous.
When Chic Sale is not on the stage,
there is a lot of pretty vulgar comedy.
If you are in the proper mood the
Green Street type of jokes may be
appreciated. Stanley Rogers plays
the woman in the burlesque scenes,
' and is really funny despite crudities.
Sylvia Froos leads most of the
j chorus numbers. She is very young,
pretty, and tuneful in her singing. So
much cannot be said for the ladies
supporting her. There are some beau
tiful spectacle scenes deserving of
| praise—richly costumed and at the
j same time quite undressed. What
more can you ask?
"Gay Paree" is a revue without a
plot—so it's easy on the brain. And
j easy on the eyes.
