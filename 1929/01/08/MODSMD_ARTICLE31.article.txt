ROSE *
(Fragment of an ancient ballad
found in the ruins of the Press Build
ing in the famous graduate tutoring
seminary, Stanford University. Be
lieved to have been written between
the 14th and 21st centuries. The only
discernible signature was
By Phil-p Space
which doesn't seem to make much
sense.)
Oh 'twas 'way 'way back
In Frisco town
In the spring of umpty eight.
That I met Rose *
In her Sunday gown
And wo walked by the Golden
Gate.
Refrain (if you please)
Oh the fog may rise
And the waves roll high
And salt breeze blow across the bay.
For I was happy
As happy could be
But my love she wandered away.
She was five feet four
And her eyeß were blue
Oh there was a cooper named Tim.**
Well I loved that girl
In my rough-house way
But she went off with Him.***
Oh the fog may rise
And the waves roll high
And the brisk breeze blow across
the bay
But I must go
Far from 'Frisco town
For my love she has wandered far
away.
Oh I sw«re a curse

And I filled my .44
And I hopped the Eastern train.
The French they are a funny J
race****
And I never never saw her again.
Oh the fog may rise
And the waves roll high
And the brisk breeze blow across j
the bay
But I must go back
To 'Frisco town
Where my false love and a load
of hay.*****
It was down at the corner
Of Kearney and Clay
When the 'Frisco night was black —
That I met the man
Who wrecked my life
—That man will never come back.
Oh the breeze dies down
And the waves roll smooth
And the sun slants down across j
the bay.
And I'll live my last days
Tn dear old 'Frisco town
Where my love she wandered away.
*Name withheld.
**Nobodv knows why this is in here.
***Not Tim.
****This must be from something
else.
***** . . there was an old man of I
Duluth."
