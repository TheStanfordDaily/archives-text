# "CHIC" SALE, STAR OF "GAY PAREE," IS EX-COLLEGIAN
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
Charles "Chic" Sale is the world's
most famous hick —on the stage. But
the rest of the time he plays golf and
enjoys life as thoroughly as any col
lege man. He is, you see, really an
ex-collegiate.
We were talking between acts of
"Gay Paree," the musical revue at
the Curran in which Sale is the star,
when the university connection
turned up. "Chic" had been telling me
how he contributed the clean part of
the show. His skits are always above
reproach, no matter how questionable
the rest of the revue is.
For the past three years "Chic" has
headed the "Gay Faree" company.
Last summer he made four Movietone
recordings of his most noted charac
terizations. Now he is headed for
Broadway with the 1929 version of
the Schuberts' sextravaganza.
But I was going to tell about Sale's
college days. They didn't last long,
but he actually attended the Univer
sity of Illinois for several months.
While there he was pledged Sigma
Nu, but left school before actually
joining.
Two years ago when playing near
the old stamping-grounds, "Chic" was
formally—and informally — initiated
into the fraternity. Now he proudly
displays his membership card when
anyone brings up the subject of col
lege.
