janitors. A single shower, situated in
a corner of a dirty shack —a single
shower must be used by all, so your
janitor waits his turn.
His shower over, your janitor goes
to breakfast in the dining room, a
place as wholly unheated as his dark,
| dingy bedroom was. Your janitor
looks about him. Ah, there are new
faces here at the table, faces that
never were here before. But your
janitor knows the reason, knows why
new faces appear to him. Janitors do
not work on the campus long —two
weeks, a month or two perhaps—then
leave, for living conditions are bad.
Might Be Worse, But Not Much
Then your janitor goes to work.
Still shivering, perhaps, he begins his
making of beds and his cleaning of
rooms. Life could be worse: he might
be without a Job, starving. Life could
be worse, he might think, to console
himself —yet not very much worse.
What might be done to make (he
life of a janitor better? Might not
janitors each of them stay here longer
and might not the janitors as a group
be of a better class if living condi
j tions were better?
