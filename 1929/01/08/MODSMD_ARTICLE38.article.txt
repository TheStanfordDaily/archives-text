# SPORTS OF 1929
## Winter B's 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"How doth the little busy 'B' im
prove each winter sport," as some
poet, afflicted with a bad case of the
hives, once wrote, and to prove that
he was right, I have constructed the
above diagram. "Exhibit A" is not
Anywhere Around, but "Exhibit B" is,
B-lieve me!
Winter B's B-gin to swarm at the
end of football season, and many a
gridiron star goes from the gridiron
to the court, stopping only to change
his Bloomers. Basketball is, without
doubt, the Queen-B of all winter
sports, rivaling football in popularity
in some sections of the country, and
being actually played by many more
persons.
Indoor Boxing is a popular Winter
B, as are Bowling and Billiards, which
are also played all the year round,
only always indoors (except for Lawn
Bowls). Bicycling is essentially an

I outdoor sport, but the semi-annual
j Six-Day Bike race in Chicago and
! New York must be classed as a Win
ter B, especially as it attracts so
, many Bugs.
Badminton, that English game
played with a Battledore and shuttle
jcock, is rapidly growing in popularity.
I Bridge has always been a Big B, both
' summer and winter. Baseball, the
King B of them all, is merely a
| Bench-warmer, though trade winds j
Blow and winnters Boast and Brag.
Such Winter B's as Barrel-jumping
J (on skates), Bareback-riding, Bunion
derbies, and Bathing need scarcely
be mentioned, but the good old sport
!of Bending-the-elbow can's B over
looked. Who is there who is Bored
By a Beaker Brim-ful of Basement-
S Brown Beer, or a Bun Begun on a
Bottle of Bootlegger's Brandy? Away
| with the Blues! B Yourself!
