FAYETTEVILLE, Ark., Jan. 7. (JP) '
â€”A human basketball ladder, five men I
standing more than six feet each, will j
be on the Southwestern Conference ,
courts this season in an attempt to
bring the University of Arkansas its
fourth consecutive title.
"When will this tall-man timber
play out?" other conference institu
tions ask; but from the looks of the
recruit squad of six-footers coining
up, Arkansas has a vast reserve sup
ply to draw upon for several years to
come.
During the past three seasons, the
Porkers have swept the conference,
winning 31 out of 34 contests by lop
sided margins.
The team this season will have a
pair of veterans for co-captains, Tom
Pickell, center and leading individual
high point scorer of the conference
last season, and Eugene Lambert,
lanky guard, directing the Raior
backs.
