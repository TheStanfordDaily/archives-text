# No Restrictions To Million Gift
## 
### 
Dr. G. A. Lawrence's bequest to the
University was made without restric
tion, according to President Wilbur,
who yesterday received a copy of the
late benefactor's will. The total sum
\
which Stanford will receive is prob
lematical, but it will be somewhere
between one and two and one-quarter
million dollars. The New York World
estimated Dr. Lawrence's estate as
of five million dollars' value, and on
the basis of that estimate the dona
tion of one million dollars and of half
the residuary estate is expected to
amount to $2,250,000.
Dr. Wilbur said when he announced
the receipt of the will that he was
particularly pleased the gift was yn
restricted. Donations free from at
tached strings are twice blest. Such
gifts can readily be put to the most
needy purposes.
