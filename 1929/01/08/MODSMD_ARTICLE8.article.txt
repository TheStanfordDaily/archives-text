# COYLE TALK WILL REVEAL WAR THEORY
## Lecturer to Discuss Russian Situation in Regard to Permanent Peace 
### 
"Present Political Trends in Eu
rope" will be the topic of a lecture in
the Assembly Hall tonight at 7:30
o'clock, by Albert P. Coyle, '16. He
will disclose Kaiser Wilhelm ll's
opinion as to who caused the World
War; that of the late Count Leo Tol
stoi as to how another such war can
be prevented; and what the present
situation in Soviet Russia promises
for war or peace.
The lecturer returned to San Jose
only two weeks ago from a five
months' stay abroad, his third trip
to Europe in the past year and a half.
He was accompanied by United States
Senator Elmer Thomas of Oklahoma,
Congressman John J. Lentz of Ohio,
and other public men interested in
gaining an insight into economic and
political conditions in Europe. Coyle
is the first American since the World

War to secure an audience to discuss
international politics with the Kaiser,
still living as "His Imperial Majesty"
in an old Dutch mansion near Doom,
Holland.
Coyle served as Secretary of the
American Commission on Conditions
in Ireland and the American Co-oper
ative Commission after his studies at
Stanford and Yale universities and
in Europe, and was editor of the En
gineers' Journal. He left this position
a year ago to become secretary of a
delegation of economists and sociolo
gists from Harvard, Yale, Columbia,
and Chicago universities to investi
gate developments in the Soviet
Union. In company with Dr. Frederic
C. Howe, former United States Com
missioner of Immigration, he returned
to Europe last winter to survey the
co-operative movement in fifteen
countries, and has spent the past
four months in Eastern Europe on a
mission of political and economic im
portance, on which he bases the theme
for his address tonight.
