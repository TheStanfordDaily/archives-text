8395 Decisions
Favoring
This Smoke
Ipswich, S. D.
Larus & Brother Co., Sept. 4, 19-S
Richmond, Va.
Gentlemen:
In answer to the challenge of J. J.
Roberts of Columbia, S. D., as printed
in the Minneapolis Journal dated Sun
day, September 2nd, I have smoked
Edgeworth for twenty-three (23) years
and for two years previous to that
time I smoked Qboid, which, I believe,
is manufactured by your iirm.
During this time I have smoked at
least one can each day, and to verify
this statement you may address the
C & C Cafe of this city, where I make
my tobacco purchases.
It may be interesting to know that
my purchases of Edgeworth during
this period have totaled more than
8395 (eight thousand three hundred
ninety-five)cans,representingatotal ex
penditure of more than $1259 (twelve
hundred fifty-nine dollars).
I have never smoked any other
brand of tobacco but Edgeworth dur
ing the twenty-three years.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) Chas. Bostock
Justice of the Peace
