# HOOVER REFUSES TO INTERFERE IN CONGRESS WORK
## Simple Inaugural Plans for March 4 Approved by Next Chief Executive in Meeting Confers With Moses, Borah, Mellon, Other Republican Leaders on Extra Session 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 8 (/P).â€”
President-elect Hoover talked over many
problems today with Secretary Mellon
and a number of Congressional leaders
and approved plans for a simple inaugu
ration to be followed by a military and
civic parade lasting about two hours.

Members of the Senate and House who
discussed legislative affairs with Hoover
were informed that he would have no
suggestions to make on pending measures
as he would consider such a course im
proper.
Members of the lowa congressional
delegation quoted him as having said that
President Coolidge still was chief execu
tive and that his administration would
have to solve its own problems.
Secretary Mellon, whose reappointment
to the Treasury post is regarded now as
almost a foregone conclusion, had lunch
with the President-elect at his headquar
ters at the Mayflower Hotel. They were
closeted together for nearly two hours,
but neither had any statement to make re
garding the conference.
Conference with Borah
Hoover started off on his second day
in Washington since his election with a
breakfast conference with Senator Borah
of Idaho, who urged an extra session of
the seventy-first Congress in the early
spring to put through a farm relief pro
gram. Senator Smoot of Utah also sug
gested an extra session for tariff revision.
The determination of the President
elect not to interfere in the present legis
lative situation was expressed first dur
ing a conference with Chairman Hale of
the Senate Naval Committee, who re
quested that he make a public statement
endorsing the pending measure authoriz
ing the construction of fifteen light cruis
ers and an aircraft carrier.
The policy of non-interference was re
iterated to the lowa delegation in the
House, which reported that the consensus
in Congress was that farm legislation
could not be enacted at this session, and
again was voiced during a conference
with Senator Moses of New Hampshire,
president pro tempore of the Senate, who
reported on the legislative situation in
that body.
Favors Kellogg Treaty
The New Hampshire Senator said he
had told the President-elect that the Kel-

logg treaty to renounce war as an instru
ment of national policy would be ratified
and that the cruiser bill would be passed
by the Senate and sent to the President.
Beyond that Senator Moses did not go,
other than to say that if the Senate would
get down to work it could pass an agri
cultural measure at this session.
