# Europe Arming For Inevitable Conflict-Coyle
## Stanford Alumnus Declares That It Rests With U.S. To Insure Peace 
### 
"No man can go to Europe and
come back with an optimistic view
about the possibility of war in the
noxt five years," declared Albert F.
Coyle, '16, in his lecture last night in
the Assembly Hall.
Growth of armament since the
World War has been phenomenal,
according to Coyle. With the 2000 per
cent increase in airships, the elabo
rate perfection of poison gases, and
the large standing armies and bodies
of reserves, all Europe is back on the
old trail of secret diplomacy.
"It rests with the United States to
bring about world peace within the
next five years by her example and
influence, or everything we hold dear
will be swept away," continued the
speaker. "There is no substitute for
immediate and complete disarma
ment; we have tried limitation and
it did not work. Yet in our proposal
to build fifteen new battleships, we
are inevitably forcing Europe into the
xace for armament which will bring
catastrophe."
One of the important trends in Eu
rope is toward the assumption of risks
by the government, says Coyle, by
which the worker is insured for al
most every incident in his life. An
other is the government control of
public utilities, including building
hemes for workers, supported by di
rect taxation. Vienna's slums have
been wiped out by this means, he de
clares. In Russia in certain localities
the workers have been supplied with
homes, rent-free. Socialization is
spreading the strong and voluntary
co-operative movement, as well.

In concluding his address, Coyle de
clared, "We cannot keep out of Eu
rope; we are already in it inextric
ably, through our government loans.
Disarmament is the one path by which
Europe and the United States can be
saved, and the establishment of world
pcace is a challenge and responsi
bility to the American people."
