# STAR OF "THE SILVER CORD" KNOWS AUTHORS AS FASCINATING PERSONS

Authors are fascinating creatures
in the eyes of Nance O'Neil, star o£
"The Silver Cord" at the Geary Thea
tre now.
"I get to meet so many interesting
writers by acting in their plays," she
said to me the other day. "Sidney
Howard, who wrote my present play,
is from Piedmont. I was born in Oak
land —so we had a lot in common
when we met.
"This new view of motherhood
which Mr. Howard shows in 'The Sil
ver Cord' is admirably worked out, I
think. Making the daughter-in-law
who rips up the mother's shams as a
scientist is a particularly tine touch.
Both sides of the mother-love ques
tion are fairly shown —and the audi
ence is left to decide to what degree
the rebellious daughter-in-law is justi
fied."
Miss O'Neil says that this is the
first time she has ever played in a
real comedy. An Oakland woman, she

j has been starring on Broadway for j
years with occasional trips to the ;
Pacific Coast. Three years ago she ap
j peared in a big production in the
i Greek Theatre in Berkeley.
"Last season I co-starred with Elsie
| Ferguson in 'The House of Women' !
in New York. This play was an adap- i
tation of Louis Bromfield's novel,
| 'The Green Bay Tree.' Mr. Bromfleld
I is another one of the delightful au- j
! thors I have met through theatre j
I ,
work.
"My husband, Alfred Hickman, was 1
called to Hollywood this fall to play '
in Roland Colman's picture, 'The Res
cue,' and 1 came with him to enjoy a
vacation. But a new repertory theatre
was opened in Los Angeles and I was
asked to do 'The Silver Cord' as the
first, attraction."
San Francisco is lucky to have one j
of Broadway's brightest stars to in- i
terpret the all-absorbing, egotistical
principal character in "The Silver
1 Cord."
