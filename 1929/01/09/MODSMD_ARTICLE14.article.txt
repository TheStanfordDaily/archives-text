# WILBUR CREATES NEW CONVENTION PLAN COMMITTEE
## 
### 
President Wilbur yesterday sent
out the following letter, which ex
plains itself:
January 7, 1929
TO MEMBERS OF THE FAC
ULTY, OFFICERS OF THE AS
SOCIATED STUDENTS, AND
EDITOR OF THE STANFORD
DAILY:
An increasing number of con
ventions of various sorts is com
ing to the Stanford campus for
meetings. With our limited re
sources, each of these conven
tions puts a considerable strain
on some of the facilities of the
University. If we are to act as
hosts, it is important that we
should know exactly what is ex
pected of us and thâ€žt dates
should be so arranged that there
will be no conflicts. It is also
important to know whether the
University will be put to any ex
pense in connection with any of
these meetings.
In the future, therefore, will
you be kind enough to see that
no invitations are extended to
conferences of any kind to meet
on the Stanford campus without
first obtaining the permission of
the President of the University.
A Committee to consider plans
for conferences in general has
been appointed by the President,
and all requests will first be re
ferred to this Committee. The
Committee is made up of the
Chairman of the Committee on
Public Exercises, as chairman,
and the Dean of Men, Dean of
Women, the Comptroller or a
representative of the Comptrol
ler's Office, and the President of
the Associated Students when
the conference involves the stu
dents in any way.
The question of meeting places
and of the housing of those who
come to the campus to attend the
conferences is also to be handled
through this Committee.
RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.
