# CARDS CONQUER GAELS 35-33 IN OVERTIME PLAY
## Hawkins Adds Winning Score For Cardinals With Field Goal in Last-Minute Play Stanford Fights High Count Piled Up by Moragans at Beginning of Fast Battle 
### ANSON REEDER 
Fighting a desperate uphill battle
which involved an extra period of
play, the Stanford basketball team
took the measure of a fast-playing
quintet from St. Mary's College in
the Pavilion last night by a 35-3S
score.
With the count standing twenty
nine apiece at the end of the regular
play, an extra session was in order.
The visitors started it off by scoring
twice on field goals by Tazer and
Boyle. It looked like curtains for
Stanford, but Hawkins brought cour
age to Card supporters when he sunk
one from the side court. At this point
Tazer, one of the real threats of
the Gael five, was removed from the
fame for having committed four per
sonal fouls, Cruse replacing him. Faw
cett was given a free throw on ac
| count of this, but failed to convert.
Captain Rothert, who played a won
! derful game, was right on hand to
take the rebound, and tossed the ball
into the basket, adding another two
points to tie the score up again.
Score in Last Minute
It looked like another extra period
to the spectators who were applaud
j ing loudly for another Stanford score.
I Hawkins, who had replaced Mears at
| center near the middle of the second
| half, responded to their cries by drib
| bling down the center of the court to
toss in a short one, making the count
Stanford 35, St. Mary's 33. The gong
sounded the end of the extra period
; a moment later.
Long shots seemed to be the spe
j c'alty of Dutch Conlan's quintet, Mul
holland and Tazer making beautiful
tosses from near the center of the
court time and time again. The fast
breaking offense of Oaklanders kept
the Cards on edge during the first
half. A lightning defense broke up
many Stanford attempts to get in
under the basket.
Gaels Hold Lead
The Cards seemed to be in a daze
during most of the early period. They
; started off with a bang to score five
I points before the visitors realized
what had happened. Then the Gaels
got busy and counted nine markers
1 before Stanford woke up to the fact
that the basketball game was still
going on. The visitors kept the lead
fiom then on through the first half
| and most of the last. At half time the
i score stood 18 to 10 in favor of St.
Mary's, anil it .looked like it was just
a question of how big a score the
visitors would run up. But the Gaels
were not expecting a comeback such
as the Cards made during the second
half last night.
The contest was one of the best
seen here for several years, and never
lacked action at any time. Coach
| Hunt played two full teams during
the course of the performance to
enable the Cards to snatch a victory
from the St. Mary's quintet. Fawcett
; was high-point man for Stanford,
scoring four field goals and one free J
throw for a total of nine points. It
would be hard to say who the real
stars were in last night's game, but ,
the playing of Captain Rothert, Berg,
; Fawcett, Reynolds, and Hawkins
stood out a shade more than the reßt.
