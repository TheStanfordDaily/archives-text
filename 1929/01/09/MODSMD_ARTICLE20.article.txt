# Winter Rushing For Men Would Not Be For The Best Interests Of The Freshmen
## 
### 
Disapproval of the winter quarter Encina-Row smokers is expressed
in Campus Opinion today. The writer, Beverly McAnear, a varsity de
bater, advances the argument that the system eventually means winter
quarter rushing for men, and flint, he thinks, means the loss of opportunity
for the forming and solidifying of friendships. The freshmen are pictured
as devoting autumn quarter to study, then, coming back in the winter and
finding that they have stayed in college, as branching out, becoming more
widely acquainted with one another, and "learning the score."
McAnear is perfectly right. It is not to the benefit of the freshmen
that winter quarter rushing should be introduced. The smokers which are
to be held in Encina and at the houses are mild enough, but they are right
fully regarded as the first step toward winter rushing. The fraternities
probably would welcome winter rushing, since it would eliminate the neces
sity for the illegal rushing which always goes 011 during winter quarter.
The business of fraternities is getting nuggets; the sooner they do this, the
greater part of the year do they have in which to rest easily. They want to
forage in "isolated, communal Encina." That's their job. Since the fresh
man's interest is for a rushing period deferred until spring quarter, the
only course which would balance the interests of the two parties is for the
Dean of Men to take the side of the freshmen in determining with the Inter
fraternity Council when rushing will take place. Undoubtedly, as counsel
for the freshmen, Mr. Culver will fight to retain spring rushing, if the
Inter fraternity Council wants to change. There is hardly a Stanford man
who would not agree that two quarters in Encina unbroken by divisions and
intrigues attendant upon affiliation with fraternities are better than but one.
