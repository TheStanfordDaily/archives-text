# Shameful Habitations
## 
### 
Responsibilitv for maintenance of the campus janitors rests witli the
American Building and Maintenance Company, by which they are em
ployed. Commenting on the article in yesterday's Daily in which the un
sanitary housing conditions provided for the janitors were described, Audi
tor E. S. Erwin said that the University originally provided the shanties
for the company's use, free of charge, and the company has not kept them
in repair. The shacks are shameful as human habitations, and should be
put in condition by the Maintenance company. Moreover, it is to the Uni
versity's interest to see that this is done, for a constant stream of janitors
coming and going makes for inefficiency, and the Lord knows Encina
could lie kept cleaner.
