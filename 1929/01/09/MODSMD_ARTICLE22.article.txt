# Recognition for a Stanford Newspaperman
## 
### 
Ralph E. Renaud, ex-'O3, succeeds Herbert Bayard Swope as managing
editor of the New York World. Another triumph for Stanford journalism.
Renaud was as an undergraduate here editor of Chaparral; he worked
afterward on the Bulletin and the Chronicle, in San Francisco; then went
to New York and worked for the Globe, the Tribune, and finally the Eve
ning Post, from the managing editorship of which sheet he stepped into the
World. He is reputed to be quite a wit. having once "subbed" for Don
Marquis on the Post and risen to the height of originating the epigram:
"It's not the heat, it's the stupidity." Renaud knows the theater, is the
author of several plays, and was for a while manager of the Chestnut Street
()pera House, Philadelphia.
Surprise was expressed when he was announced as Swope's successor,
because he was said to be anti-Al Smith, uncompromisingly Protestant,
and a jingo patriot. He replied : "It's absurd to think I have any religious
prejudice. I have none. I was bred a Unitarian, but l>elong to no church.
As for the Germans, yes, during the war I was against Germany. I was a
loyal American. But since then I've held no animus. And 1 did vote for
Hoover. But if Mr. Pulitzer (owner of the World) were hiring a manag
ing editor on account of his vote, I suspect he wouldn't have hired me
I'm going to the World as managing editor. A managing editor should be
impartial. I imagine I was chosen for the job because 1 know newspaper
work."
As managing editor of the New York World Renaud holds not only one
of the most enviable jobs of any Stanford-trained journalist, but also one
of the most influential positions in American newspaperdom.
Police interference with student activities at Harvard has become a
habit. Several years ago they censored the Lampoon, and this year they
have gone in for dramatic criticism. "Fiesta," Michael Gold's drama of life
among the lowly Mexican peons which the Harvard Dramatic Club pro
duced at great expense this year, was barred from Boston following an
unfavorable report upon its first showing in Cambridge. The police found
some obscene lines in the play, according to their report to Mayor Nichols.

For grotesque appellations, Time, national condensed-news weekly,
takes the non-perforated postage stamp. It refers to Malcolm D. Almack,
the Durant prize winner, as "Hoover Townsboy" Almack. To lis, that
would seem to approach libel, but then we shall never get into Time.
Lipstick, says a Parisian cosmetic expert, contains: perfume, cocoa
butter, beeswax, lanolin, spermaceti, paraffin, and vegetable coloring. And
Act women draw the line at masculine lips which have merely touched
liquor!
