"I SEE BY THE MORNING'S DAILY"
"Oh my," fluttered little Sally
Glutz, 607 Roble, "Isn't it horrid.
Those poor dear janitors. Only one
shower. And cast-off clothing. And
sheets of paper where once were
glass panes in their rooms. Oh, oh."
"Free-thinking, athletic, women's
rights supporter, Dora Dimple, moaned
to her roommate, "And now they're
taking automatic late leave away from
us. Next they'll put us on milk toast
and roller skates will be provided by
the University to be taken on all
dates."
"Well," grumbled Jack Jones, Se
quoia 506, over pale Java in the Roost,
"I see where the two million Law
rence bequest is given without re
strictions. Well, the rats can expect
a new hotel. And perhaps they might
add a monkey cage or two."
"Who's this simple Joe Doak writ-

I ing Bullsessions?" Joe College of
I Whoop Whata Whoop at the micro
! phone. "Row-Hall battle collegiate!
I Whassa matter wasn't he rushed?"
"Mighty fine edtiorials in the Daily
' from the New York Times, the Post
! Dispatch, the Philadelphia Public
j Ledger, the San Francisco Chronicle,
| and the Chicago Tribune," commented
disgruntled Gerbert Gadzook, also-ran
I for office" of croquet manager.
"Say Jamie, Philip Space rolled out.
Can you imagine. I heard he fell in
love with the undertaker's wife in
Mountain View and npent all his time
writing sonnets to her husband's
corpses."
"No, it can't be! I always thought
Philip Space was one of those ghost
writers that might be anybody, even
' President Wilbur. But then we'll go
; see the Fast Male tonight and see Biff
Hoffman in action."
