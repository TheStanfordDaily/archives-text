## DISAPPROVAL OF THE FRATERNITY SMOKERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It was a serious blow when I re
turned from a six months' exile to
learn that rushing rules had been so
altered as to schedule informal
"smokers" between Frosh and fra
ternity men during winter quarter.
And a blow it was, for I believe it to
be nothing more nor less than a de
liberate attack at the Stanford idea
of a Freshman dormitory.
Now that idea stipulates that the
Frosh live apart for a year, there and
then to gain their feet and "to learn
what the score is." And that year is
very largely filled with seeking by
the Frosh, individually and collective
ly, to find their way through to their
Stanford. That system is at one and
the same time made possible and fos
tered by the isolated and therefore
intense community life at Encina. The
men there are Frosh; each knows as
much and no more than the other. All
are seeking: none know; but that ig
norance only impels them to more
questions, to more intense introspec
tion, to a continued search. To call
it "search" is stilted, I know; but
some phrase is needed, and my feeble
imagination cannot evolve one better.
But by "search" I mean which every
Stanford man who has lived in Encina
must recognize. Some speak of that
process as "getting acquainted"; some
| call it "learning the score"; some
know it as a good time. Yet, regard
less of nomenclature, I believe that
that year's experience of interlocking
j oneself with the life about is funda
mentally the same.
And I believe that this procedure of
self-searching for Stanford and self
building of Stanford men had, in the
past, winter quarter as its most in
tense period of activity. In the fall,
lessons were too threatening; by the
second quarter, that problem was
solved. So the Frosh had time to
stop, to look at himself, to see the
school about him, to measure himself
by meeting his classmates. And as he
changed, so did his classmates, and
all formed a compact and close-knit
union of fellowship and then of friend

ship. But, with spring quarter, rush
ing came; attention of the Frosli was
therefore drawn elsewhere; the iso
lated, communal life of Encina was
smashed. The Frosh went out to be
! row men or hall men, Alpha Delts or
| Betas. But yet, beneath that later af
; filiation, there ran a deeper current,
j a realization that there was once no
I differentiation, that they were once
| only Stanford men, seeking to be of
' and for Stanford, and that to that
| deeper faith they would, on gradua
! tion, return. That lesson they had
! learned in Encina; each by himself
j had discovered many of its primary
! truths in the comparative leisure of i
winter quarter.
j So it was; I fear it is of the past,
j Therefore, forgive these tears, for I
, believe I shed them at a funeral. For
i the fraternity council has ordained a
j series of smokers during winter quar
ter to entertain the Frosh on the row,
and, henceforth, during winter quar
i ter, it is. there that the imagination
j of the Frosh shall dwell. The Stanford
:of peace, the Stanford of friendship
lof the fellows about him, that Stan
; ford of self will be gone. For the fear |
| of lessons will tread in the fall quar
] ters to come as sadly as they have
j in the past; and, with fraternity rush-
S ing moved forward a whole quarter, I
j the time for founding Encina friend
! ships will be gone. The smokers are
! not many, I grant, but they will serve
I for the purpose of luring the interest
of the Frosh to the houses of the hills.
And it will do a more important
thing, too: it will serve as a prece
dent to move the rushing proper j
| ahead to winter quarter, even as did
the sororities. And with this change j
of rushing dates, there will openly
change the whole spirit of the Fresh
man dormitory. With that change 'of
; spirit in the Freshman dormitory, |
there will disappear that spirit of
i Stanford, that spirit of a common !
group, and in its place will grow only i
the over-consciousness of some petty I
divisions. What had been a faith will ;
become a tradition.
