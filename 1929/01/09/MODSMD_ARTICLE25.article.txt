Hafiz. An English Rubiyat. By Clar
ence K. Streit. (New York: The
Viking Press. $2.)

This adaptation into English of a
portion of the "Divan" of Ilafiz is a
book for all who consider poetic
beauty a rare and precious thing; a
book to be placed alongside your copy
of Fitzgerald's masterful English ren
dering of Omar the Tentmaker.
A single quotation from Hafiz is
better than a column of opinion:
"Though I in Hell pay for my
liberties,
While wine and tavern are, and
maidens please,
There even shall the timid turn
to soothe
The thirst born of the dust that
was Hafiz.
"Immortal daughter of the Vine,
when you
Come to my tomb to serve the
motley crew
Of joyous pilgrims drawn to my
divan,
Ask grace for old Hafiz —he sins
anew.
"O God of men, why hold con
cealed Your light?
When shall Your sun erase this
blot of night?
Can You not spare us but one
flash, one beam?
Must we believe that You are in
our plight?
"Then from the fragile table seize
a tass
And drain the wine of life before
the Klass
Shall crumbling fall, with table
and with you
And with your God into oblivion
pass.
"But ere you free the glass from

all its wine
And through its crystal see a
new world shine,
Throw some to these who knew
its magic, too.
And cool the wind —the wind's
their drink, and mine."
| The New Day. Campaign Speeches
of Herbert Hoover. (Stanford Uni
versity Press, 1928.)
Admirers of Herbert Hoover, espe
cially those who worked for his elec
tion, both need and appreciate this
new publication of the Stanford Uni
versity Press. It contains in perma
nent form all of his speeches of the
recent campaign.
The book opens with an introduc
tion by President Wilbur, which is
followed by a chronology of Hoover's |
life compiled by his brother. A fron- j
tispiec.e shows Hoover standing be
fore a battery of microphones—a sig- !
nificant pose in view of the newly j
great influence of the radio in poll- j
tics.
Then we have the complete text of |
Hoover's six campaign speeches as j
he delivered them in West Branch,
Newark, Elizabeth ton, Boston, and St. j
Louis, as well as his speech of accep- I
tance at Palo Alto.
The New Day is rendered handy
as a reference book by an index in !
the back.
Of Hoover's speeches we read, "In
his campaign speeches he mapped the
I course he will follow. In them we
I
read the forecast of American history
for the next four years." It seems to
us that It is the height of optimism j
to praise campaign speeches as the |

forecast of history. However, let us |
hope that such optimism is not mis
placed. —Clifford F. Weigle.
