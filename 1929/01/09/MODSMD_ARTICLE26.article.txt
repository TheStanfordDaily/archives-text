## "The Silver Cord"—Geary. 
### 
Here is an excellent drama we !
wholeheartedly recommend. It pre- (
sents a new idea of mother love, the j
familiar but neglected fact that moth- j
ers often spoil their children's lives j
by too much love.
This mother loves her two sons in
a jealous, harmful way. The boys are j
without minds of their own until they 1
marry. Then comes the inevitable ;
I clash with the boys' sweethearts. One
son marries without his mother's i
j knowledge, and the other boy be- j
conies engaged to a perfectly suitable j
girl. But the mother cannot bear to
lose her sons' complete devotion, and
i so she does her best to wreck the two j
romances —and every artifice of a
selfish woman is employed.
The end is a compromise, for one
son breaks away from the destroying
influence of the mother —and the
other son is too weak to withstand
i her hysterical appeals.
Nance O'Neil, long one of America's
foremost stars, plays the unsympa
thetic mother. She is excellent in the
role, which is strongly emotional. 1
Adda Gleason, as the daughter-in-law
who dares scientifically to expose the
mother's selfishness, is a remarkably '
I good actress. The other members of |
| the company adequately fulfill the re- {
j quirements of their roles.
"The Silver Cord" is one of the j
I best plays San Francisco has seen !
this winter. You are sure to like it.
