Many improvements and new fea
taures will disUnguish the 1928-29
Quad when it comes off the press in
June. The seven color plates and six
feature plates comprising the art
work of the feature section have been
finished. Instead of the four-color pro
cess plates formerly used for the
color work, this year's Quad is using j
a new style of eight flat colors for |
each colored page. Every color, even
each shade, sometimes as many as
three of one color, has its own plate j
and will be printed on antique stock.
The drawings are the work of Rauch
nabel, who has done work with prevl- ,
ous Quads, and George Kegg, a new- j
comer to Quad art.
