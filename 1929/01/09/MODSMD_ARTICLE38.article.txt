# SPORTS OF 1929
## 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
I Happy New Year! How did you be
j gin 1929? Like Roy Riegels, or like
George Dexter? Of colirse, you know
all about Roy, the most-talked-about
man of the year—so far. He's more
to be pitied than censored, for, while
calling him a "bonehead" for running
70 yards in the wrong direction, you
must sympathize with him for his
tough luck in becoming the goat of
the game, and likewise commend him
for being on the job and alert enough
to recover an opponent's fumble.
"Snooks" Dowd, of Lehigh, once did
the same stunt, only he realized his
mistake in time, turned and raced al
most the length of the field in the
right direction to score a spectacular
touchdown!
George Dexter, who is not nearly
I so well-known as Roy Riegels, started
I the new year perfectly, both from a

golfing and a technical viewpoint. On
the first stroke of his first round of
1929, he made an ace at the Brook
Hollow Country Club, Dallas, Texas!
A hole-in-one shot number one on
January 1!
New Year's Day was also Valen
tine's day at Newburgh, New York,
where the Middle Atlantic Skating
Association speed championships
were held. Valentine Bialis, of Utica,
New York, won the title by beating
Allan Potts, of Brooklyn, in a special
half-mile skate-off.
Other New Year's Day winners
were Young Stribling, the New York
Rangers. Detroit Cougars, Boston
Bruins, Montreal Maroons, Fall River
Soccer team, the Pitt, Michigan,
Penn, and Fort Wayne basketball
