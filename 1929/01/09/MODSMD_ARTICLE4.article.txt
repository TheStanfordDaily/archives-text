# CAPTAINS CHOSEN FOR SEASON BY AQUATIC TEAMS
## Driggs Is Swimming Leader; Clapp, Booth Named by Frosh for 1929 
### 
Ogden Driggs, tried and proven
middle-distance man on the aquatic
team, was elected swimming captain j
yesterday afternoon at a meeting of
the varsity squad at Encina pool.
Reggie Harrison has already been
named water polo captain for the sea-,
son.
The freshmen elected Austin Clapp,
by unanimous vote, as swimming cap
tain, and Frank Booth polo captain.
Clapp was interscliolastic quarter
mile champion last year, member of
the American Olympic team, and
holder of several junior titles.
John Barry, manager, issued a ten
tative schedule of swimming and j
waterpolo meets for the winter quar
ter, which is as follows: polo with
the University of California at Athens |
Club, Oakland, February 8; swimming j
with the University of Oregon, here, |
February 16; swimming and polo on i
March 1 with either Athens Club, at
Oakland, or with Northwestern Uni- |
versity, here. A trip south is being
planned for the spring vacation, when
the team would meet the University
of California at Los Angeles, South
ern California, and one of the city
athletic clubs.
"The University of Oregon will fur
nish us some of the hardest competi- !
tion that we will find on the Coast,"
said Coach Ernst Brandsten in his I
talk to the team yesterday. "Califor-.
nia, our old rival, has a squad of the I
usual strength. Northwestern is prob- j
try, and if we meet them, it will take
all we can show to even hold them."
Some of the men at the pool were 1
trying the "screw back stroke," latest |
development in swimming from Eng- j
land which was described by George J
F. Lineer in the San Francisco Chron- j
icle. It is found to be a fast stroke, j
but while executing it the swimmer
is so far over on each side that it
may be considered illegal. The rule j
requires that in the backstroke, a
man must not turn over on his side J
or stomach.

Ogden Driggs, tried and proven
middle-distance man on the aquatic

John Barry, manager, issued a ten
tative schedule of swimming and j
waterpolo meets for the winter quar
ter, which is as follows: polo with
the University of California at Athens |
Club, Oakland, February 8; swimming j
with the University of Oregon, here, |
February 16; swimming and polo on i
March 1 with either Athens Club, at
Oakland, or with Northwestern Uni- |
versity, here. A trip south is being
planned for the spring vacation, when
the team would meet the University
of California at Los Angeles, South
ern California, and one of the city
athletic clubs.
"The University of Oregon will fur
nish us some of the hardest competi- !
tion that we will find on the Coast,"
said Coach Ernst Brandsten in his I
talk to the team yesterday. "Califor-.
nia, our old rival, has a squad of the I
usual strength. Northwestern is prob- j
try, and if we meet them, it will take
all we can show to even hold them."
