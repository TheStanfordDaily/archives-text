# "Fast Male" Promises Evening Of Thrills: Is First All-College Movie
## Leads in Stanford Picture Played by Biff Hoffman, Powell Carpenter 
### 
A youthful, naive freshman!
A ravishingly beautiful co-ed!
A great college track star!
Mix these three well with two parts
of gasoline, six parts of Encina, and
the shadier parts 'of the Stanford
Quad, adding one love potion and a
pinch of rivalry. Stir thoroughly.
Result: "The Past Male," and a
riotous evening of enjoyment tonight
at 8 o'clock.
Stanford's first motion picture, "The
Fast Male," will be presented in the
Assembly Hall. For the last eight
months the Stanford Studios has been
trailing a Fast Male, and he has been
captured and secured and will reveal
his tricks tonight. According to Er
nest Page, William Palmer, and Burt
Davis, who have been carrying on
the man-hunt, this freshman who un
dergoes metamorphosis under the
arches of the Quad is one of the
i Fastest Males alive, and his speed is
I such that even the quickest students
J on the campus will be amazed.
Stanford Studios is owned and
operated—not by KHJ —but by stu
' dents of the University, and tonight's
; picture presentation marks the first
j all-college production in the country.
, "The Fast Male" is unique in that it
was written, directed, filmed, pro
! duced, and will be shown on a college
j campus.
Biff Hoffman, who is already well
! known in several lines, will make his
| debut as a motion picture actor.
Powell Carpenter, who has been seen
on the campus stage several times,
j will now appear on its screen. As
j there are sixty thousand people in
' eluded in the picture, almost any
! Stanford student can expect to find
himself in some flash of a Quad scene,
a track meet, or as a reveler in the
Masque Ball of last spring quarter,
j Dink Templeton also appears in the
picture.
Seven short features will precede
the photoplay. They are: "Idle Hours,"
,a scenic study of the campus; "Kam
pus Nooze," a surprise for the profes
isors; "Liquid Air," a series of exper
iments by Dr. E. C. Franklin; the
j "Days of a Man," in which Dr. Jor
dan appears; a resume of Hoover's
activities on the campus; a Cardinal
| sports reel; and a musical number by
the Staley-Spalding orchestra.
Tickets for the show will be sold
|at the Assembly Hall tonight for
j twenty-five cents.
