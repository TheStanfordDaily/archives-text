### 
Ruth Lansburgh was appointed by
the Executive Committee at its meet
ing last night to serve as senior wo
man member of that body in the
place of Ann Bancroft, who is not in
school this quarter. Miss Lansburgh,
who is a member of Women's Council,
ana who has been active in student
aitairs, will act until the winter quar
ter elections in February when a
senior woman will be chosen to fill
the term.
Twenty-five men were granted their
Block "S" for football, having played
the required length of time during
the 1928 season. They are: C. W.
Ariman, Hodge Davidson, T. A. Dris
coll, Herb Fleislihacker, Lud Frent

Eight men were awarded gold foot
balls by the Executive Committee as
victory awards for 1927. Last year
when the other gold footballs were
awarded the word "team" in the vic
tory award provision of the Constitu
tion was construed to mean only
those men playing in the California
game. The meaning as construed by
the Board of Athletic Control is that
Tiny man who makes his Block "S"
during the season whether he plays
in the California game or not is en
titled to his victory award.
