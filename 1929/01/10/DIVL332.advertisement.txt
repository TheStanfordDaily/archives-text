COMMENCEMENT day is coming—sooner than you ever thought
possible. Soon you will have received your college award—your
degree. It will have been worth working for, not just for possession of
the sheepskin, but because it stands for four years of accomplishment.
When you leave college, you will hear of the Charles A. Coffin Award,
the highest gift in the utilities industry for excellence of operation.
During the six years of the Coffin Foundation, three of the Gold
Medals symbolizing first place have been won by companies under
Stone 8C Webster executive management.
No matter what profession or business you choose, you'll meet
Stone 6C Webster men—financing utilities, operating gas, electric, and
transportatioii companies, building power and industrial plants. They're
wide awake, alert, progressive. You'll find the Stone 8C Webster organiza
tion is worth knowing and worth doing business with.
