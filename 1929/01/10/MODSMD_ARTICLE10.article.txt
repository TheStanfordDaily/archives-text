# POP WARNER DECLARES EAST ADMITS PACIFIC COAST FOOTBALL SUPREMACY
##

By ANSON REEDER
The inevitable cigarette in one cor
ner of his mouth. A smile on his face.
The subject was football.
"Seems good to be home agani,"
drawled the maker of Stanford won
der teams, as he greeted us in the
study of his home yesterday. A mo
; ment's pause. A question about the
Stanford-Army game. And then foot
ball took precedence over all other j
| matters. His grid plans for next year, 1
' Cagle, Lom, and the New Year's
; game consumed the conversation.
To Use A and B Formations
"We will use both A and B forma- !
tions next year," Pop declared, in
speaking of his plans for the 1029 sea
son. He seems to feel that the use of
: B formation alone does not give the
team enough variety in its attack.
Stanford ought to be able to take
care of herself when the next grid ;
season rolls around, regardless of the

fact that a good many men will be j
lost to the squad through graduation,
was the belief expressed by him. At. i
present the guard positions look as
though they would be the hardest to
fill.
In the "Old Man's" opinion the East
has definitely bowed to the Pacific
Coast's football supremacy. They ad
mit that their type of play is too con- \
servative to compete with the present '
style used by the West. The lesson j
taught them by Pacific Coast teams
this season, however, should cause
some radical departures from the j
system used in that section last fall.
"He's a whizz," was Pop's comment
when asked about Cagle, the great j
Army star. "An all-American if there !
ever was one. And you can bet that
any game he plays in is worth watch
ing."
The Card coach remained in New
York till the Thursday following the
Army game. During his stay there he
was invited to attend the Ziegfield
Follies by Will Rogers, who does a
turn or two in the present edition.
Pop.accepted the invitation, and when
he put in his appearance Rogers in
troduced him to the audience. The
"Old Fox" got quite a kick out of
some of the gags about the Army
game which the comedian pulled dur
ing his act. And some of Will's jokes,
by the way, were quite pointed, owing
to the fact that he claims the distinc
tion of being a California resident
himself.

Between puffs of a newly lighted
cigarette, the "Old Man" told us about
his trip down the Atlantic Coast to
New Orleans where he attended a
meeting of college football coaches.
At this meeting he spent much of his
time with Knute Rockne, Notre
Dame's great mentor. Knute seemed
quite upset over the fact that he had
just completed one of the most dis
mal seasons in some time. "Judging
from comments which he made peri
odically during our stay in New Or
leans, I would not be surprised to see
him make some radical changes in
the famous Rockne system next fall,"
Pop declared.
After the meeting the "Old Fox"
journeyed to Los Angeles in time to
see the New Year's game between
California and Georgia Tech. He was
particularly impressed with Lom's
work in the contest, although the
play of the two teams as a whole he
described as "ragged and as resem
bling an early October game."
Explains Lom's Blocked Kick
In speaking of the January first
battle he brought forth a new angle
in regard to Lom's blocked kick which
resulted in a safety against California.

It was not the rushing of the Tech
forwards, especially, nor his slow
ness in getting off the kick that re
sulted in the mishap, but rather the
fact that Lom was forced to stand
within the end zone, less than ten
yards from the line of scrimmage, to
make the punt. For if he had made a
step backwards in kicking beyond the
end zone, in kicking out of danger,
it would have automatically given
Georgia Tech a safety. An unusually
quick boot was required, so quick In
fact, that Lom was smothered by the
Tech forward wall before he ever had
a chance to get it off.

New Orleans where he attended a
meeting of college football coaches.
At this meeting he spent much of his
time with Knute Rockne, Notre
Dame's great mentor. Knute seemed
quite upset over the fact that he had
just completed one of the most dis
mal seasons in some time. "Judging
from comments which he made peri
odically during our stay in New Or
leans, I would not be surprised to see
him make some radical changes in
the famous Rockne system next fall,"
Pop declared.
After the meeting the "Old Fox"
journeyed to Los Angeles in time to
see the New Year's game between
California and Georgia Tech. He was
particularly impressed with Lom's
work in the contest, although the
play of the two teams as a whole he
described as "ragged and as resem
bling an early October game."
Explains Lom's Blocked Kick
In speaking of the January first
battle he brought forth a new angle
in regard to Lom's blocked kick which
resulted in a safety against California.

It was not the rushing of the Tech
forwards, especially, nor his slow
ness in getting off the kick that re
sulted in the mishap, but rather the
fact that Lom was forced to stand
within the end zone, less than ten
yards from the line of scrimmage, to
make the punt. For if he had made a
step backwards in kicking beyond the
end zone, in kicking out of danger,
it would have automatically given
Georgia Tech a safety. An unusually
quick boot was required, so quick In
fact, that Lom was smothered by the
Tech forward wall before he ever had
a chance to get it off.

The inevitable cigarette in one cor
ner of his mouth. A smile on his face.
The subject was football.
"Seems good to be home agani,"
drawled the maker of Stanford won
der teams, as he greeted us in the
study of his home yesterday. A mo
; ment's pause. A question about the
Stanford-Army game. And then foot
ball took precedence over all other j
| matters. His grid plans for next year, 1
' Cagle, Lom, and the New Year's
; game consumed the conversation.
To Use A and B Formations
"We will use both A and B forma- !
tions next year," Pop declared, in
speaking of his plans for the 1029 sea
son. He seems to feel that the use of
: B formation alone does not give the
team enough variety in its attack.
Stanford ought to be able to take
care of herself when the next grid ;
season rolls around, regardless of the

fact that a good many men will be j
lost to the squad through graduation,
was the belief expressed by him. At. i
present the guard positions look as
though they would be the hardest to
fill.
In the "Old Man's" opinion the East
has definitely bowed to the Pacific
Coast's football supremacy. They ad
mit that their type of play is too con- \
servative to compete with the present '
style used by the West. The lesson j
taught them by Pacific Coast teams
this season, however, should cause
some radical departures from the j
system used in that section last fall.
"He's a whizz," was Pop's comment
when asked about Cagle, the great j
Army star. "An all-American if there !
ever was one. And you can bet that
any game he plays in is worth watch
ing."
The Card coach remained in New
York till the Thursday following the
Army game. During his stay there he
was invited to attend the Ziegfield
Follies by Will Rogers, who does a
turn or two in the present edition.
Pop.accepted the invitation, and when
he put in his appearance Rogers in
troduced him to the audience. The
"Old Fox" got quite a kick out of
some of the gags about the Army
game which the comedian pulled dur
ing his act. And some of Will's jokes,
by the way, were quite pointed, owing
to the fact that he claims the distinc
tion of being a California resident
himself.

fact that a good many men will be j

was the belief expressed by him. At. i
present the guard positions look as
though they would be the hardest to
fill.
In the "Old Man's" opinion the East
has definitely bowed to the Pacific
Coast's football supremacy. They ad
mit that their type of play is too con- \

taught them by Pacific Coast teams
this season, however, should cause
some radical departures from the j
system used in that section last fall.
"He's a whizz," was Pop's comment
when asked about Cagle, the great j
Army star. "An all-American if there !
ever was one. And you can bet that
any game he plays in is worth watch
ing."
The Card coach remained in New
York till the Thursday following the
Army game. During his stay there he
was invited to attend the Ziegfield
Follies by Will Rogers, who does a
turn or two in the present edition.
Pop.accepted the invitation, and when
he put in his appearance Rogers in
troduced him to the audience. The
"Old Fox" got quite a kick out of
some of the gags about the Army
game which the comedian pulled dur
ing his act. And some of Will's jokes,
by the way, were quite pointed, owing
to the fact that he claims the distinc
tion of being a California resident
himself.

Between puffs of a newly lighted
cigarette, the "Old Man" told us about
his trip down the Atlantic Coast to
New Orleans where he attended a
meeting of college football coaches.
At this meeting he spent much of his
time with Knute Rockne, Notre
Dame's great mentor. Knute seemed
quite upset over the fact that he had
just completed one of the most dis
mal seasons in some time. "Judging
from comments which he made peri
odically during our stay in New Or
leans, I would not be surprised to see
him make some radical changes in
the famous Rockne system next fall,"
Pop declared.
After the meeting the "Old Fox"
journeyed to Los Angeles in time to
see the New Year's game between
California and Georgia Tech. He was
particularly impressed with Lom's
work in the contest, although the
play of the two teams as a whole he
described as "ragged and as resem
bling an early October game."
Explains Lom's Blocked Kick
In speaking of the January first
battle he brought forth a new angle
in regard to Lom's blocked kick which
resulted in a safety against California.

It was not the rushing of the Tech
forwards, especially, nor his slow
ness in getting off the kick that re
sulted in the mishap, but rather the
fact that Lom was forced to stand
within the end zone, less than ten
yards from the line of scrimmage, to
make the punt. For if he had made a
step backwards in kicking beyond the
end zone, in kicking out of danger,
it would have automatically given
Georgia Tech a safety. An unusually
quick boot was required, so quick In
fact, that Lom was smothered by the
Tech forward wall before he ever had
a chance to get it off.
By ANSON REEDER
The inevitable cigarette in one cor
ner of his mouth. A smile on his face.
The subject was football.
"Seems good to be home agani,"
drawled the maker of Stanford won
der teams, as he greeted us in the
study of his home yesterday. A mo
; ment's pause. A question about the
Stanford-Army game. And then foot
ball took precedence over all other j
| matters. His grid plans for next year, 1
' Cagle, Lom, and the New Year's
; game consumed the conversation.
To Use A and B Formations
"We will use both A and B forma- !
tions next year," Pop declared, in
speaking of his plans for the 1029 sea
son. He seems to feel that the use of
: B formation alone does not give the
team enough variety in its attack.
Stanford ought to be able to take
care of herself when the next grid ;
season rolls around, regardless of the

fact that a good many men will be j
lost to the squad through graduation,
was the belief expressed by him. At. i
present the guard positions look as
