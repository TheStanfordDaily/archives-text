# WOMEN VOTE TO CARRY ON TRIAL OF LATE LEAVES
## Conference Rules Women Can Sit Downstairs in Assembly Hall 
### 
Women's Conference recommended
at a meeting last night the continu
ance of granting automatic 11:30
leaves for the coming winter and
spring quarters, according to the sys
tem under trial during the last fall
quarter.
Under this system freshman wo
men can obtain two late leaves per
quarter by signing out on the week
night they desire the leave. Sopho
more women will have four per quar
ter; junior women, six; and senior j
Avomen, eight. Special leaves for play
rehearsals or for work on campus
publications must be referred to
Janet Harris, president of Associated
Women Students.
President Wilbur's and Dean Yost's !
approvals are necessary before the
granting of automatic late leaves can
become permanent.
The method of granting leaves for
merly was that of telephoning a mem
ber of Women's Council for permis
sion. Under the newer method, which j
has proved more satisfactory, women
receive automatic leave by signing
out in living group books.
Another decision of the Women's
Conference was that women who so i
desired might be permitted to sit !
downstairs in the Assembly Hall at j
assemblies.
