# President Wilbur Asks That B. A. C. Consider Abolishing Rooting Section
## Abuse of Ticket Privileges, Obscenity Causes of Many Complaints; Board Refers Problem to Students 
### 
Asserting that he had received
I many "complaints in regard to the
I use of foul, obscene, and profane lan
guage" in the Stanford rooting sec
tion at football games, President Wil
bur has requested that the elimina
■ tion of the rooting section be con
j sidered by the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
The suggestion was made in a letter
written to Alfred R. Masters, general
manager of the board, on December
j 15, but the letter was not made public
until today. The full context of the
I letter appears in the editorial column
of the Daily. It was read at the last
meeting of the Board of Athletic Con
trol and given to Phil Cavalero, presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., and a student
\ representative on the board, to ascer
tain the student reaction. This is the
first inkling that students have had
that anything of this nature was being
j contemplated.
How the student reaction will be
determined has not been decided, but
it is expected that the matter will be
I discussed at the next Ex Committee

meeting and some official action will
be taken at that time. It is possible
that the matter may be placed on the
ballot at the mid-year election.
President Wilbur mentioned the
fact that many students sold their
rooters' tickets to high school stu
dents and others, but that this would
not protect the good name of the
University although it would furnish
an alibi.
Fred Wool, chairman of the Men's
Council and a member of that body
for two years, declared last night that
he was not in favor of the elimina
tion of the rooting sections. Among
other reasons for his stand, he de
clared that no cases of disorderly
conduct from students at rooting sec
tions had come before the Men's
Council during the time that he has
been a member of that body, as far
as he knows.
At a late hour last night it was im
possible to get a statement from Phil
Cavalero, president of the A.S.S.U.
and member of the Board of Athletic
Control, the body which must decide
this issue.

trol.
The suggestion was made in a letter
written to Alfred R. Masters, general
manager of the board, on December
j 15, but the letter was not made public
until today. The full context of the
I letter appears in the editorial column
of the Daily. It was read at the last
meeting of the Board of Athletic Con
trol and given to Phil Cavalero, presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., and a student
\ representative on the board, to ascer
tain the student reaction. This is the
first inkling that students have had
that anything of this nature was being
j contemplated.
How the student reaction will be
determined has not been decided, but
it is expected that the matter will be
I discussed at the next Ex Committee

meeting and some official action will
be taken at that time. It is possible
that the matter may be placed on the
ballot at the mid-year election.
President Wilbur mentioned the
fact that many students sold their
rooters' tickets to high school stu
dents and others, but that this would
not protect the good name of the
University although it would furnish
an alibi.
Fred Wool, chairman of the Men's
Council and a member of that body
for two years, declared last night that
he was not in favor of the elimina
tion of the rooting sections. Among
other reasons for his stand, he de
clared that no cases of disorderly
conduct from students at rooting sec
tions had come before the Men's
Council during the time that he has
been a member of that body, as far
as he knows.
At a late hour last night it was im
possible to get a statement from Phil
Cavalero, president of the A.S.S.U.
and member of the Board of Athletic
Control, the body which must decide
this issue.
Asserting that he had received
I many "complaints in regard to the
I use of foul, obscene, and profane lan
guage" in the Stanford rooting sec
tion at football games, President Wil
bur has requested that the elimina

j sidered by the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
