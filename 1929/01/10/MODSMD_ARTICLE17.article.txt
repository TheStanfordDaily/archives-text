# OLD BOY GIVES LOW DOWN ON THEATRE TODAY
## 
### 
"Although 'The Fast Male' is now
past history," said the Old Boy as he
hobbled out of the Assembly Hall at
midnight yesterday, where he had
been engaged for two hours in loosen
ing his long gray beard from his seat
in which it had gotten tangled dur
ing a hot love scene, "the campus is
going to get some fast theatrical en
tertainment this morning when my
latest Chaparral goes on sale."
The Theatre Number of Chappie
abounds in humor, wit, and advice. A
full page of "vodvil sketches" and a
fantasy entitled "The Student Quince"
is the work of that promising young
playwrite Burnell Gould and his boon
companion, Philip Space. Nelson Car
ter gives an idea of how Shakespeare
would have written had he lived to
day. An impression of Emil Jannings
and Greta Garbo in a love scene as
heard over a talkie is the contribu
tion of Raymond Carlson. That rising
ink-slinger, Berk Anthony, has drawn
a blue cover of a group of chorus
girls vainly trying to keep in the lime
light. And finally the Hammer and
Coffin Society announces the starting
of a fund for a new campus theatre.
The boys suggest a combined Hoover
memorial court, war library, and audi
torium, or else a single building on
the oval opposite the Chem building.
An artist's conception of the new
building is the frontispiece of the
magazine.
