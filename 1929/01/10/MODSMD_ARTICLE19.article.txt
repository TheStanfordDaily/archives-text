# VARSITY CAGERS BEGIN WORK FOR U.C.L.A. CONTEST
## Hawkins, Substitute Center, Surprise Player; Fawcett High-Pointer in Gael Tilt Cards Show Improvement in Free Throws; Indications Favoring a Winning Team Don Tyler, Menlo Junior College basketball star, has been admitted to the University as a transfer and was last night on the Pavilion floor working out with the varsity. Coach Hunt put the newcomer in the first-string lineup, and he looked promising. 
### ANSON REEDER 
; The Cardinal basketball team, fol
lowing their hard-fought victory over
the Moragan quintet, has settled down
to the serious business of preparing
for the first Conference game of the
' season with U.C.L.A. here Saturday
J night.
As predicted the Stanford five won
1 the Gael fracas. But oh, what a game.
I It was anybody's contest till the final
: gong. At half time, with the score
; favoring St. Mary's 18 to 10, nobody
| would have given a thin dime for the
| Cards' chances to win. But they did,
Iby staging a never-to-be-forgotten
comeback.
Hawkins, substitute center, was the
big surprise of the evening. Supposed
ly a third-string center, he entered the
fray late in the second period to put
Stanford in the lead for the first time
since the early part of the game.
Then in the extra period of play he
was responsible for four of the six
points scored by the Cards. His work
easily outshone that of his predecs
sors, McCandless and Mears.
Coach Hunt gave most of his
' charges a chance to show their ability
in the Gael contest. Fawcett's floor
work was beautiful to behold. Time
and again he dribbled down the court,
passing to Berg or Captain Rothert
under the basket. He was high-point
' man for the Cards, with his afore
mentioned running mates as close
i seconds.
Improvement in Free Throws
Compared to their work in the
Pacific game, the squad showed a
I great deal of improvement in making
i free throws, nine of the thirty-five
points being scored by this method.
If the team continues to improve in
the different departments of the game
as it has so far this season, Stanford
should have a winning basketball
, team, something which this institu
' tion has lacked for several seasons.
Saturday's contest with U.C.L.A.
| should be a real test of the Cardinals'
| ability at the hoop game, for the
j Southern team is rated as one of the
; strongest on the Coast. They proved
' their mettle last Saturday night in
S Los Angeles when, after trailing the
j speedy North Dakota team 13-1 at the
I half, they came back to beat the visi
tors by a 41-29 count. At present the
week-end tilt looks like a toss-up.
NEW YORK, Jan. 9. (JP)â€” Jack
Dempsey is expected to announce
definitely tomorrow he has decided
to carry out Tex Rickard's wish that
he return to the ring this year in an
attempt to regain the heavyweight
championship of the world.
