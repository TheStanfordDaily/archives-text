# The 						Rooting Section: Orally Rotten
## 
### 
The fog already is commencing to lift from the local political horizon
and a pair of important issues to appear. One question is certain to go
on the ballot at the elections next monthâ€”what to do about the bonfire.
The other issue was recently raised by President Wilbur in a letter to
Graduate Manager A1 Masters. It is the problem of the rooting section:
its disorderliness, drunkenness, and obscenity. Whether or not there Is
balloting on the question which Dr. Wilbur raises, there will surely be
copious discussion of the matter.
It is no news to anyone who has sat 111 or near the rooting sections
thaf the conduct of certain people wearing rooters' hats is reprehensible.
To be sure, it is consoling to think (although it is no excuse) that some
of the objectionable characters are not Stanford men. But this does not
mitigate the fact that great numbers of alumni and outsiders complain
after each football season about the conduct of Stanford rooters. While
the general public does not expect us to be lilies, it does have standards
of gentlemanliness which very evidently we are offending.
But let President Wilbur's letter be read:
15 Dec. '28
Dear Mr. Masters:
In connection with the distribution of football tickets for the
games to be held during the season of 1929 I should like to have you
consider the question of eliminating the rooting section.
A number of abuses have grown up in connection with the set
ting aside of certain seats for the students of the University. Not
only have some of the students transferred their seats to high school
students or others and seated themselves elsewhere, but there has
been a series of complaints in regard to the use of foul, obscene, and
profane language and of generally disorderly conduct. The situation
is abnormal for those seated near the rooting section in that they
cannot protect themselves or the women whom they may be accom
panying to the game without running the risk of being attacked by
a mob of students. The fact that some of the seats are transferred
to those who are outsiders gives an alibi but does not protect the
good name of the University.
I should be glad to discuss this matter with you.
Very sincerely yours,
R. L. WILBUR, President.
President Wilbur has since explained that he does not by any means
call for the immediate abolition of the rooting section; he simply wants
consideration to be taken of the present state of affairs. His letter was
read to the Board of Athletic Control, and it was straightway referred to
President Cavalero with the advice that it be brought before the students.
It is understood that the Executive Committee will in due time take
offkial action.
The Daily takes occasion to point out that while the football team
has been bringing manifold honors to the University, the rooting section
has become more and more flagrant in violating common decency. The
President is right in asking for an accounting to be made.
