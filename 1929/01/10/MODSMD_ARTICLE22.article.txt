# A 						Theatre Of, By, and For Stanford!
## 
### 
The Theatre Number of Chaparral, out today, carries an announce
ment which should be of tremendous interest to every Stanford student,
present and past. The members of Hammer and Coffin Society have
each given $5 to begin a fund which will eventually finance the building
of a Theatre for Stanford—a theatre worthy of Stanford's prestige in
intellectual and dramatic arts —a theatre which would be a monument of
beauty and a cultural center for the entire Peninsula.
The ball is rolling! The decrepit Assembly Hall can some day be
scrapped, and there will rise a structure which EVERY LOYAL STAN
FORD STUDENT HAS HELPED TO BUILD—an enduring proof
that Stanford Spirit is a real, constructive sentiment—not merely a mat
ter of cheering at games.
It isn't the money or the much-needed theatre that is of greatest
importance to the members of Hammer and Coffin Society, who have
given the first $100 toward the fund. The important thing, they believe, is
that the Fund will offer a common bond of endeavor for all men and
women of Stanford. A unified ambition, and—when the Theatre is com
pleted in years to come—an everlasting memorial to the fact that Stanford
students can work together and win success in a common purpose.
The Fund did not start with the higher-ups. It begins as a student
endeavor, set in motion by students. Above all, it is meant to be volun
tary. Money is needed, yes; but only voluntary contributions, regardless
of amount. It is hoped by those who began the Theatre Fund that no
Stanford student will ever be forced to contribute so much as a penny
to tiie fund against his will.
They believe, however, that all of us will realize of what tremendous!
value this movement can be to Stanford, both as a University and as a:
community of students and alumni with similar ideals; and that, realizing
this, all of us will approve and give aid.
The Stanford Daily has pledged itself to give all aid to Stanford's j
future Theatre, and each month Chaparral and the Illustrated Review
will list contributors to the Fund and report progress.
The amount which you give does not matter —it is the underlying
ideal that counts. Each of us, at one time or another, has a little money
to throw away, which, contributed to the Theatre Fund, would give him
right and title to a share in the ownership of the Theatre. Some day, as
alumnus or alumna, we ca nreturn and stand before the Theatre and say,
alumnus or alumna, we can return and stand before the Theatre and say,'
the keystone in that arch."
The appeal goes to all societies, eating clubs, fraternities, sororities,!
to every living group, and to each Stanford student individually, to (lis-!
cuss this Fund for a Theatre for Stanford, to appreciate the spirit and j
the ideals which began it, and to respond, be it ever so humbly, in the
same spirit.
It is an appeal which every one of us should answer.
