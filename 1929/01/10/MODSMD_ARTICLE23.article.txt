## WANTED: GENII WITH A THEATRE COMPLEX 
### 
A genni with a theatre complex or
a million dollar bequest designated ;
(or a new theatre would put Stanford ;
dramatics at the top where they be
long. Without the genii to be called
on at will and without the million dol- '
lar bequest, dramatics on the Farm
struggle on bravely, ingeniously pro- ;
ducing commendable plays notwith- j
standing.
With things as they are among
ticket-buyers to campus productions,
four out of five have it, i.e., a seat |
from where the stage can be viewed
without one's going home with a stiff
neck or the sense of having seen only
half the stage during the play.
And then that admirable horseshoe j
balcony created no doubt for good
luck and to please the esthetic sense
of the gay nineties. Not only does it .
afford row on row of impossible seats, |
but also the unique feature of stairs
that gracefully run from balcony to ;
stage. A rare sight is it when any ,
given number of Roughs marches up |
them with military precision and
yokel indifference, during the middle
of any given scene in any given play.
Back-stage cursing, if not audible,
must be, should be, voluminous and
vitriolic during the production of a

j play. Were Job himself shifting
i scenes the air would be rent with
' anthema and no end of rare old
I Hebraic curse-words.
j For instance, the grid from which
are hung all respectable walls, ceil
-1 ings, and such claptrap (unknown by
technical name to the man out front),
instead of being capable of drawing
up scenery out of sight, and only draw
it up three-fourths of its length. Pic
ture a scene portraying geraniums
growing around a cabin dooryard.
The scene changes; it is the interior
of. the cabin; but, behold, above the
gorgeous chandelier of the cabin the
same geraniums that once graced the
i dooryard are flourishing in space.
Then, there's the matter of the ar
j chaic pulley system which endeavors
to fly drops and the like, the cyclo
rama which might make a good tent,
j but which at present is rather half a
sky or whatever it happens to repre
| sent, the ragged, worn curtain which
; on occasion fails entirely to work, the
| antiquated permanent lighting system,
and so on, ad infinitum.
Yet they do produce plays despeite
hell, brimstone, and the limitations of
such equipment. Please, God, give us
genni with a theatre complex.
