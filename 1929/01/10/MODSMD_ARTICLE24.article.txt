Theodore Roosevelt's Diaries of Boy
hood and Youth. Charles Scrib
ner's Sons, Publishers, New York
and London. 1928.)
In Theodore Roosevelt's Diaries of
Boyhood and Youth are printed for
the first time the complete journals
of daily observations made by the boy
Roosevelt, beginning from the time
that he was ten years of age, and ex
tending over some nine years.
This book has constructive value
from two different standpoints: first,
if the reader is a Roosevelt fan to
start with (which applies to most
Americans), he will find much to in
terest and amuse him in its 365 pages.
His allegiance almost certainly will
be further strengthened at the end,
for these accounts reveal with de
lightful unconsciousness on the part
of the author those qualities which
made him one of the country's great
est presidents. The man is only the
boy grown up, we are told. Then
these diaries are significant for the
clear picture they give of Roosevelt
the man —from an exceedingly novel
and appealing angle.
As for the alternative point of view,
if the reader is but an indifferent ad
mirer of Roosevelt, he can hardly help
but feel a new admiration and re
spect for the former president after
reading this book. It is impossible not
to respond to the simplicity and the
charm of the boy Roosevelt setting
down earnestly and carefully each
day's little events —its fun, its adven
tures, its disappointments—showing
his courage, his enthusiasm, and his
optimism. Page after page, it must
be admitted, holds only the merest
trivialities. But even these are en
livened by Roosevelt's unique spell
ing. And to offset them are the far
more numerous pages full of quaintly
solemn or decidedly humorous re
marks about things that he saw or did.
