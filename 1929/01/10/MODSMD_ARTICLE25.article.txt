"This Thing Called Love"—President.
Marriage is a success until love

enters into the relationship, reasoned
Edwin Burke when he wrote the cur
rent play at the President. Getting a
novel twist to a domestic comedy is
night onto impossible; yet "This
Thing Called Love" is one of the few
plays that makes an old situation
seem fresh.
One strikingly handsome living
room set is the battlefield for three
acts of matrimonial side show. The
Bertrands, a young couple who love
to fight, are forced for business rea
sons to assume friendly relations for
one evening. They entertain a wealthy
man from Peru, and it is to the hus
band's advantage if the visitor thinks
them a supremely happy pair.
Husband Gets Kissed
Fireworks are started by the jeal
ous wife before yie eminent guest ar
rives, and they finally explode when
the husband gets kissed by a femi
nine guest of whom the wife is in
sanely jealous. The great millionaire
is soon disillusioned about the joys
of this particular home. But, knowing
little of women, he is not discour
aged. He and the sister of the scrappy
wife make an unusual marriage agree
ment and take over the Bertrands'
house when the battling host and
hostess resort to a Paris divorce.
The new marriage plan works fine
for the couple concerned, even though
it shocks everyone else. But, unfor
tunately, "This Thing Called Love"
intervenes and one more happy home
is turned itno a house of jealousy and
suspicion.
Moore Plays Lead
Tom Moore, the movie star, is play
ing the leading part. He is really bet
ter on the stage than on the screen —
and his Irish accent and casual man
ner are "elegant."
Kay Hammond is the leading lady.
She is very human in her part—thor
oughly satisfactory. The supporting
cast is well-chosen, with Mary Jane
Higby, Charlotte Stevens, and Irving
Mitchell deserving of much praise.

sanely jealous. The great millionaire
is soon disillusioned about the joys
of this particular home. But, knowing
little of women, he is not discour
aged. He and the sister of the scrappy
wife make an unusual marriage agree
ment and take over the Bertrands'
house when the battling host and
hostess resort to a Paris divorce.
The new marriage plan works fine
for the couple concerned, even though
it shocks everyone else. But, unfor
tunately, "This Thing Called Love"
intervenes and one more happy home
is turned itno a house of jealousy and
suspicion.
Moore Plays Lead
Tom Moore, the movie star, is play
ing the leading part. He is really bet
ter on the stage than on the screen —
and his Irish accent and casual man
ner are "elegant."
Kay Hammond is the leading lady.
She is very human in her part—thor
oughly satisfactory. The supporting
cast is well-chosen, with Mary Jane
Higby, Charlotte Stevens, and Irving
Mitchell deserving of much praise.
