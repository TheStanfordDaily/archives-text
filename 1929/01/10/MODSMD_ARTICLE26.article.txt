### PHILIP SPACE 
A scurrilous slur has been cast on
our character —and by one of our
trusted cohorts! A man named Wood,
or Wood, in yesterday's Bullsessiou,
inferred that I rolled out. This rumor
has gone too far. Having started it
ourselves as a means of getting sym
pathy from fair females we hereby
withdraw it.
"I heard he fell in love with the
undertaker's wife in Mountain View
and spent all his time writing sonnets
to her husband's corpses."
Now this is a tissue of lies. As a
matter of fact she lived in Menlo, and
I never wrote a sonnet in my life —
or if I did I wouldn't write a sonnet.
Such attacks have gone too far. One
of these days I'll sue for libel, or any
how, I'm liable to.
"I always thought Philip Space was
one of those ghost writers that might
be anybody, even President Wilbur."
There you have it. Our secret is out.
God forgive us, we ARE President Wil
bur. And such puns
Guess we'll spend that million on
a steamer ticket.
A heavenly crew assembled before
the Willesden police court recently.
Their names were Saintly, Paradise,
and Angell.
