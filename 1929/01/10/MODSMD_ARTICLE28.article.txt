Stanford hasn't been famous for the
excellence of its basketball teams
these past few years, but fame or no
fame there was a double-barreled,
hair-trigger, sure-fire hoop game in
the Pavilion Tuesday night, and
Husky Hunt's hopefuls played several j
varieties of nice ball, all reports to j
the contrary notwithstanding.
Of course those who too laudly
singe the praises of the Cardinal
hoopmen are carried away by a
sophomoric enthusiasm for last
minute blood and thunder which,
by the way, was provided in im
pressive quantities as the Gaels
of St. Mary's had a bitter pill
crammed down their throats by
the Stanford stalwarts.
From the dear public's point of
view the game was a 100-100. No mo
tion picture director in his balmiest
moments could crave more thrills
than the Cards and the Saints pro- j
vided those who packed the Pavilion, i
The Stanford play was by no means '
perfect. There were moments when
the Cards seemed to think they were !
playing squash or handball. But what 1
theq lacked in some of the finer points
they made up in steam. And steam,
after all, is a matter of no little im- j
portance in this business of winning
basketball games.
It is true, as has been stated,
that the Cards didn't look perfect
even to the observer with the
rosiest colored glasses. But they
did look good—positively deli
cious—during those last few mo
ments. Th*6 Fawcett person was
no less than amazing in his abil
ity to sweep, single-handed,
through the Gael defense. And he
wasn't the only one. Young Haw
kins, aside from making the pro
verbial last-minute shot for vic
tory, played a heady, steady game. ;
In short, the 1929 Cards look more
like a cage team than any quintet
seen around the Farm in many moons. 1
If they are comparatively as good
later in the season as they were last
night, Stanford will have the unusual
experience of crowing over a suc
cessful hoop season this winter.
