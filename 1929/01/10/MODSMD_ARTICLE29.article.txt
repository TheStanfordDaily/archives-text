# FIRM HIRES JANITORS University Built Quarters CONDITIONS NOT SERIOUS

### GUNNAR NORBERG 
Who is responsible for the main
tenance of the janitors' quarters on
the University campus?
According to Ernest S. Erwin, Uni
versity auditor, the American Build
ing Maintenance Company is responsi
ble for the care of the quarters used
for the housing of the janitors it hires.
Since the University is providing the
quarters, it should not be too much to
ask that the American Building Main
tenance Company should care for
those quarters in such a manner that
they would be fit for men to live in,
as well in winter as in summer, as
well when the weather is cold as
whent it is warm.
John M. Brown, the representative
on the campus of the American Build
ing Maintenance Company, to whom
Mr. Erwin referred the writer for the
attitude of his company toward the
bettering of living conditions, did not
feel inclined to speak definitely about
the alleged responsibility of his com
pany in the matter of caring for the
janitors's quarters here. However, he
stated that, in his opinion, the living
conditions of the janitors here are not
so deplorable as it might be inferred
they are from a reading of the article
appearing in the Daily yesterday. Still
he said that he would be much pleased
to see conditions improved, if he
could see how an improvement might
be effected.
