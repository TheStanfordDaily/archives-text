# Leo, The Lion-Hearted
## 
### 
Track fans who are looking about i
for some American runner capable of
giving Paavo Nurmi a little competi
tion in the coming indoor meets, and
wondering if Lloyd Hahn cannot be
J enticed back into competition for just
one more season on the boards, J
should not overlook the fact that Leo
Lermond, of the Boston Athletic As
sociation, is among those present,
and is quite capable of making the ;
famous Finn do some extra-fast flying, i
Just a year ago the youngster was
starting his most successful indoor
season. He swept through meet after |
meet without tasting defeat, and time i
and again won important races in a !
blaze of glory by coming from behind
with a terrific sprint that always j
started two laps before the finish and
literally ran his opponents dizzy. He i
won the two-mile run at the Prout'
Memorial Games in Boston in 9:37 3-5; !
he ran the same distance in 9:25 1-5
at the Knights of Columbus meet in
New York; did 9:24 at the New York
Athletic Club games; and ran 9:16 4-5

i at the national indoor championships, ;
the second fastest two miles ever run .
by an American, I believe.
It was quite an upset when Mac |
Smith beat him in a thrilling 5,000- I
meter race at the Eastern Olympic j
j tryouts, but eLo came back and beat i
! Smith at the final tryouts and at the j
! Olympics. Leo's game race at Am-
J sterdam, in which he finished fourth
; behind Ritola, Nurmi, and Wide, and
| beat Magnusson of Sweden and Kin
nunen of Finland, gave promise of
! better times to come in American dis
| tance running.

i at the national indoor championships, ;
the second fastest two miles ever run .
by an American, I believe.
It was quite an upset when Mac |
Smith beat him in a thrilling 5,000- I
meter race at the Eastern Olympic j
j tryouts, but eLo came back and beat i
! Smith at the final tryouts and at the j
! Olympics. Leo's game race at Am-
J sterdam, in which he finished fourth
; behind Ritola, Nurmi, and Wide, and
| beat Magnusson of Sweden and Kin
nunen of Finland, gave promise of
! better times to come in American dis

j race were announced today by the >
I Contest Board of the American Auto- j
mobile Association, effective in 1930. '

Denver is exactly one mile above

Track fans who are looking about i
for some American runner capable of
giving Paavo Nurmi a little competi
tion in the coming indoor meets, and
wondering if Lloyd Hahn cannot be
J enticed back into competition for just
one more season on the boards, J
should not overlook the fact that Leo
Lermond, of the Boston Athletic As
sociation, is among those present,
and is quite capable of making the ;
famous Finn do some extra-fast flying, i
Just a year ago the youngster was
starting his most successful indoor
season. He swept through meet after |
meet without tasting defeat, and time i
and again won important races in a !
blaze of glory by coming from behind
with a terrific sprint that always j
started two laps before the finish and
literally ran his opponents dizzy. He i
won the two-mile run at the Prout'
Memorial Games in Boston in 9:37 3-5; !
he ran the same distance in 9:25 1-5
