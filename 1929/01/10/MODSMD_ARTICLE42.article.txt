# TOM MOORE IN "CASUAL ACTOR CLASS"
## Player in "This Thing Called Love" Perfectly at Home on Stage or Screen; Three Brothers Similar 
### BEN MADDOX 
Some movie stars are fat; some are
' thin. Some are lively; some are pas
' sive. Tom Moore falls into the casual
| class—he is just going along—the fu
ture always takes care of itself, in
; his opinion.
Theatre dressing rooms are smaller
■ than you probably imagine, but I
squeezed in while Tom was changing
from his street to his stage suit.
Mr. Duffy,'who is featuring Moore
at the President Theatre in "This
Thing Called Love," had asked him
for three plays before this. Tom had
been anxious to do them, but location
' trips or something or other had al
-1 ways interfered. Mr. Duffy sent a wire
asking Tom to come on up to San
1 Francisco and do this show, and this
i time things worked out satisfactorily.
Moore Likes The Stage
Tom likes the play, and he likes
the stage. He doesn't know how long
this engagement will last, and he is
not getting experience for talking pic
i tures. He hasn't even seen any talkies
made, so he refuses to make predic
tions as to their popularity.
"Twenty-five years ago I had my
first stage role," he commented. "My
family came over from Ireland when
I was thirteen years old. I went on
the stage soon after. When I found
how well I could do, I got my brothers
interested." Owen and Matt Moore,
the brothers, followed Tom onto the
stage. When Tom discovered the
movies, Owen and Matt became screen
stars, too.
Brothers Are Actors
"Matt is playing in a talkie now —
with Mary Pickford in 'Coquette.'
Owen just recently played in the
stage production of 'The Marriage
Bed'."

The three Moores are, therefore, j
equally at home before a camera or
the footlights. And Tom, who has
been leading man for almost all the
famous actresses of Hollywood, is tak
ing another fling at the stage. He is
every bit as good when heard as
when seen, so Henry Duffy will be ,
lucky if Tom consents to do another !
play after this one.

the stage. He doesn't know how long
this engagement will last, and he is
not getting experience for talking pic
i tures. He hasn't even seen any talkies
made, so he refuses to make predic
tions as to their popularity.
"Twenty-five years ago I had my
first stage role," he commented. "My
family came over from Ireland when
I was thirteen years old. I went on
the stage soon after. When I found
how well I could do, I got my brothers
interested." Owen and Matt Moore,
the brothers, followed Tom onto the
stage. When Tom discovered the
movies, Owen and Matt became screen
stars, too.
Brothers Are Actors
"Matt is playing in a talkie now —
with Mary Pickford in 'Coquette.'
Owen just recently played in the
stage production of 'The Marriage
Bed'."

The three Moores are, therefore, j
equally at home before a camera or
the footlights. And Tom, who has
been leading man for almost all the
famous actresses of Hollywood, is tak
ing another fling at the stage. He is
every bit as good when heard as
when seen, so Henry Duffy will be ,
lucky if Tom consents to do another !
play after this one.
Some movie stars are fat; some are
' thin. Some are lively; some are pas
' sive. Tom Moore falls into the casual
| class—he is just going along—the fu
ture always takes care of itself, in
; his opinion.
Theatre dressing rooms are smaller
■ than you probably imagine, but I
squeezed in while Tom was changing
from his street to his stage suit.
Mr. Duffy,'who is featuring Moore
at the President Theatre in "This
Thing Called Love," had asked him
for three plays before this. Tom had
been anxious to do them, but location
' trips or something or other had al
-1 ways interfered. Mr. Duffy sent a wire
asking Tom to come on up to San
1 Francisco and do this show, and this
i time things worked out satisfactorily.
Moore Likes The Stage
Tom likes the play, and he likes
the stage. He doesn't know how long
this engagement will last, and he is
not getting experience for talking pic
i tures. He hasn't even seen any talkies
made, so he refuses to make predic
tions as to their popularity.
