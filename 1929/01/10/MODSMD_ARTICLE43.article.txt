# FROSH CAGEMEN TO MEET SANTA CRUZ SATURDAY
## 
### 
With two decisive victories behind
them and the season's prospects
brightening every day, Stanford's
freshman basketball team will enter
their third game of the year against
the Santa Cruz High School quintet
as a preliminary to the varsity-
U.C.L.A. clash Saturday evening in
the Cardinal Pavilion.
Despite the fact that they have had
less than two weeks of concentrated
practice, Coach "Rabbit" Bradshaw's
charges are already displaying a
smooth brand of basketball and give
promise of developing into one of the
fastest babe teams Stanford has had
in many years.
A new star has been added to the
squad's roster with the eligibility of
Jim Shrader, former Los Angeles all
city forward. The center position
seems to be cinched by Bill Doub,
who has taken high-point honors
among his teammates in their two
games; while Baker and Rintala work
best together in the guard berths.
Reindeer racing is to be given a
trial in Vancouver.
