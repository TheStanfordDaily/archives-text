# University Movie Is Burlesque On Hollywood Ideas
## "Fast Male" To Be Repeated Tonight for Remainder Of Student Body "The Fast Male" will be repeated tonight at 8 o'clock in the Assembly Hall as there were many students who were unable to secure seats last night. 
### SYLVA WEAVER 
With open arms, Stanford welcomed
the newest member of her student ac
complishments, the motion picture,
last night in the Assembly Hall. In
all truth "The Fast Male" can be pro
claimed a howling success, although
it really wasn't the show, but the
spirit in which the show was taken,
that made the evening one of riotous
entertainment.
The chief virtue of "The Fast Male"
is its modesty. It does not take itself
seriously, for which many words of
praise can be given the producers. It
is avowedly a burlesque on the Holly
wood interpretation of college life,
and in a broad, humorous way the
touches of satire are brought out.
The "trimmings by Link Malm
quist" deserve special mention as
they added much laughter to the pre
sentation. The picture is peculiarly
Stanford's own, not only because it
is purely a student production, but
because it is purely a student produc
tion, but because it reflects the spirit
of Stanford from the first flash of the
Palo Alto tree to the fadeout on Lagu
nita. Such touches as the freshman's
cheery "hello," and Templeton's "For
the honor of Stanford" are unforget
table.
Powell Carpenter scores in his in
cognito role of Flash Rawlins, and
one of the best bits in the picture is
played by Ernest Page, co-director,
with Burt Davis and William Palmer
as the member of the Lounge Club
who makes the wager that causes all
the trouble. Hoffman was particularly
popular with the audience.
"The Fast Male" revealed many
points to the campus audience. Hay
seed Freshmen will become popular
overnight. It will be another point of
the collegite credo that all Harvard
men wear tuxedos after 8 o'clock at
night.
As a motion picture, "The Fast
Male" is weak in spots, and is dis
tinctly amateurish, but it must be re
membered that Stanford's movie in
dustry is in its "infancy."
