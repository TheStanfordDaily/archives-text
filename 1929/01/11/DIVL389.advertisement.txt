Dear Friends:
I have been a very heavy pipe
smoker for the last thirty years, and
have always used Edgeworth To
bacco (Plug Slice) and find there is no
other tobacco like it for a cool and
well flavored taste.
I am in the vaudeville business, and
have traveled all over the world with
my brother, and always have had very
great pleasure in recommending your
tobacco; and many a time I have had
to pay double the price in different
countries for it, but I would sooner do
that than smoke anything else, as I
have tried all different brands. I
generally buy a one-pound tin and
roll it up; and believe me, gentlemen,
it is real tobacco.
With best wishes from
Yours sincerely,
Sam La Mert
