of Nankai University, Tientsin.

The speaker was once a sailor in
the Chinese Navy, where he had many
thrilling experiences. In the Chino-
Japanese war his ship was sunk, and
he managed to swim to shore, barely
escaping with his life. He was thei'e
upon fired with a resolve to do some
lasting good for his country, and to
prepare himself he came to America
and studied at Columbia University.
Builds University
While in America, Dr. Chang be
*
came interested in the idea of build
ing a university, and on his return he
was instrumental in the founding of
Nankai University, entirely erected
by Chinese capital, and the largest
non-government and non-missionary
college in his country. Difficulties
facing Dr. Chang were great especial
ly during the recent violent upheavals
in China, but it was owing to him
that the university was able to con
tinue during this time. Innovations
which he introduced are largely bor
rowed from America, as is the resi
dence system, unique in China, where
by students live on the campus.
The lecturer is important in other
circles, being the chairman of the
Research Committee of the Chinese
Council for the Institute of Pacific Re
lations. He is deeply interested and
concerned in the subject of modern
China, on which he will speak this
morning, and his contact with Chi
nese university students especially
fits him to address a college audience.
Dr. Chang will leave the campus
immediately after the Assembly for
a tour of the United States and
Canada, in the interests of his uni
versity. While here he has been en
tertained by the Stanford Chinese
Club and has remained at the home
of President Wilbur, with whom he
is acquainted.
