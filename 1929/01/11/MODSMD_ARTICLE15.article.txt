# STANFORD, U.S.C. DEBATERS CLASH HERE ON MONDAY
## 
### 
Stanford debaters will encounter
keen competition when they meet a
three-man team from U.S.C. in the
Assembly Hall Monday night at 8:15
o'clock on the question, "Resolved,
That Modern Advertising Is More
Detrimental Than Beneficial."

The southern team will be com
posed of Clifford Weimar, Leo Harris,
and Leo Adams, all speakers of at
least two years' experience and rated
among the best at U.S.C. However,
Stanford's squad will not be without

debaters of proven ability also. Virgil
Whitaker, Leon Carley, and Henry
Harris will represent the Cardinal
team.
William Hawley Davis, Professor of
English and Editor of the University
Press here, will act as chairman dur
ing the contest, it was announced
last night.
Preparation for the match Monday
evening indicates that the speeches
will frequently take a satirical or
humorous turn when the inconsisten
cies and half-truths of many modern
advertising campaigns are held up to
public scorn.
The popular American indoor sport
of debunking will be one of the prin
cipal features of the contest, accord
ing to members of the debating squad.
