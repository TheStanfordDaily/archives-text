to the young and ambitious Shand in
his political career.

be played by Lionel Walford, Herbert
Wenig, and Arthur Hurt, who will
characterize Aliek, David, and James
Wvlie, respectively. Marion Freedman
will play Mr. Venables. Dorothy Zit
kowski has the part of the maid.
Election Scene Shown
Three other parts have been as
signed to Orville Witherbee, Harold
David, and Milton Hand. These three
will lead the election scene in which
Shand gets his first bit of success in
the political game.
Gordon Davis has chosen a difficult
play in "What Every Woman Knows,"
and it is particularly difficult from a
technical point of view. .There are
four sets to be constructed by Harold
lfelvenston, and the sketches have
already been made. The settings will
be begun immediately.
"What Every Woman Knows" was
played for many years with Maude
Adams in the title role. The play has
recently completed a two years' run
in Now York and on the road starring
Helen Hayes.
