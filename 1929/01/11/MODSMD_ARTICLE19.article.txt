Spectacular shooting by Eberhardt
featured last night's contest between
Los Arcos and the Sigma Nu team.

with 8 points. Sigma Nu, however,
staged a comeback in the second half
and carried off the honors by a two
point margin.
Encina 4E ran away from the A.T.O.
outfit in a lop-sided game. Smith
scored 12 points for the Hall team

Hossam showed up well at center for
the fraternity men. The score was
only 9 to 6 at the end of the first half,
but the winners hit the basket from
all angles in the next session.
Lacking both an offense and a de
fense, Sequoia 2 was defeated by the
Business Men in the poorest-played
game of the initial round in the
mural tourney. The losers failed to
score a single point in the first half
but managed to garner one field goal
before the fumble fest ended. Erick
son was the only man who showed
any shooting ability, scoring 9 points.

Lacking both an offense and a de
fense, Sequoia 2 was defeated by the
Business Men in the poorest-played
game of the initial round in the
mural tourney. The losers failed to
score a single point in the first half
but managed to garner one field goal
before the fumble fest ended. Erick
son was the only man who showed
any shooting ability, scoring 9 points.
Pavilion Independents 13, El
Cuadro 11
Kappa Sigma 13, Encina 5 12
Sigma Nu 15, Los Arcos 13
Business Men 13, Sequoia 2
Encina 4E 21, Alpha Tau Omega 9
Displaying ability to out-rough their
opponents, the Pavilion Independents
overcame a four-point lead in the last
few minutes of play and emerged at
the long end of the score. G. Smith,
center for the victors, played an out
standing game by tipping in three
shots off the backboard. Dutton led
the scoring for the losers.
Kappa Sigma rallied in the final
quarter to tie the score at the end
of the regular period of time, and
won a close contest from Encina 5 in
an extra session when Mann sank a
free throw. Mann was high-point
scorer of the game with 9 tallies.
Bartlett, at forward, played a good
floor game for the losers.
Sigma Nu Rallies
Spectacular shooting by Eberhardt
featured last night's contest between
Los Arcos and the Sigma Nu team.
The speedy club forward sank a cou
ple of long ones from the center of
the court and was high-point man
with 8 points. Sigma Nu, however,
staged a comeback in the second half
and carried off the honors by a two
point margin.
Encina 4E ran away from the A.T.O.
outfit in a lop-sided game. Smith
scored 12 points for the Hall team
by looping in a number of long shots.
Hossam showed up well at center for
the fraternity men. The score was
only 9 to 6 at the end of the first half,
but the winners hit the basket from
all angles in the next session.
