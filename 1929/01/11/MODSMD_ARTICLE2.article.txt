# HANDBALL CONTESTS WILL START MONDAY
## 
### 
The University four-wall handball
tournament will start Monday after
noon on the courts of the Peninsula
Athletic Club. The exceptionally large
number of entrants made it neces
sary to abandon the original plan of
running the whole tourney as a
round-robin, so the first .two rounds
will be played by regular elimination
and then the round-robin will be
started. There are 28 entrants in the
tourney.
The schedule for all the games has
been posted in the Encina gym; all
matches must be played by the time
for which they are scheduled or be
forfeited. Practice games can be ar
ranged by communicating with John
Sauter, handball manager.
