### ANSON REEDER 
In a contest which promises to be
replete with thrills from start to
finish, Coach Husky Hunt's Stanford
cage team will meet one of the stiffest
hurdles in Pacific Coast basketball
competition, the U.C.L.A. Bruins, in
the first conference game of the 1929
season at the Pavilion tomorrow
night. The varsity fracas will begin
at 8 o'clock following a preliminary
between the freshmen and Santa Cruz
High School.
Coach Caddy Works is bringing his
entire squad north for the contest
lomorrow .night. The Bruin victory
over the University of North Dakota
last Saturday ranks it as one of the
best teams in the country. So far this
season the Blueshirts have won six
and lost but one contest. In five of
these wins, they have made at least
forty points while keeping their op
ponents In the twenties.
Three Veterans Start
Of the Bruins' starting lineup,
Sammy Baiter, a guard, Bill Wood
ruff, center, and Larry Wilde, a for
ward, are all veterans. A1 Sunseri,
the other guard, and Dick Linthicum,
at the other forward position, how
ever, have played basketball for some
time and always give the opposition
plenty of trouble.
There will be two changes in the
Cards' starting lineup when the team
takes the floor tomorrow night. Haw
kins, because of his showing in the
Gael contest, will start at center. And
Reynolds will replace Tampcke, who
was ordered to the hospital yesterday
with a light case of flu.
The probable lineup:
Stanford— U.C.L.A.—
Fawcett F Wildes
Berg F Linthicum
Hawkins C Woodruff
Reynolds G Sunseri
Rothert (C) G Baiter (C)
