# A 						Properly Behaved Rooting Section Is An Individual Responsibility

"Consider the question of eliminating the rooting section," President
Wilbur advises.
Consider, also, the results of abolition. The student body probably
would receive but two tickets, rather than three, for the Big Game. The
"pageantry and carnival display" of that auspicious occasion would exist
no more on the Stanford side of the stadium. There would be no
organized yelling, and the singing would be weaker than it now is. For
these reasons alone, the undergraduate student body would disfavor
abolishment.
The present rooting section, with its profanity, obscenity, and foulness
of mouth, cannot, on the other hand, be allowed to exist.
Therefore, improve your conduct as a rooter (if you are lax) and
help thereby to retain the prestige of Stanford men as gentlemen.
It is 110 more than philosophical to inquire if Stanford must needs
have a rooting section.
Pop Warner says the rooting has no influence upon the team; they
are too busy working at football to notice it. But Warner does deprecate
any idea of eliminating the rooting section, for the reputation which
Stanford has built up with its stunts would be a pity to lose. Preserva
tion of a reputation, then, is one raison d'etre of a rooting section.
The alumni, coming back to the Big Game, expect to see the non
combatants, too, participating earnestly in the Roman display. Alumni
would be almost unanimously disappointed to see no colored cards nor
red hats nor "gyrating yell leaders" in the middle of the stadium's shady
side. To please the alumni is another reason for keeping the rooting
section.
There are very many, particularly lower division students, who derive
considerable pleasure from sitting in the rooting section. To others,
yelling and stunting is a bore —such a bore, in fact, that they prefer to
sell their rooters' tickets to high-school lids and hoary grandfathers and
to sit in five dollar seats.
If the rooting section, for any of the above reasons, justifies its
existence (we believe it does), then those who sit in the Stanford root
ing section should so behave in the section that no criticism can be made
of their actions. The older and saner men of the upper division ought
especially to attempt to set the moral tone of the section. Let's not rely
on policing by the Rally Committee; this is a problem for each man to
solve for his own satisfaction. In that way we can win back our self
respect.

organized yelling, and the singing would be weaker than it now is. For
these reasons alone, the undergraduate student body would disfavor
abolishment.
The present rooting section, with its profanity, obscenity, and foulness
of mouth, cannot, on the other hand, be allowed to exist.
Therefore, improve your conduct as a rooter (if you are lax) and
help thereby to retain the prestige of Stanford men as gentlemen.
It is 110 more than philosophical to inquire if Stanford must needs
have a rooting section.
Pop Warner says the rooting has no influence upon the team; they
are too busy working at football to notice it. But Warner does deprecate
any idea of eliminating the rooting section, for the reputation which
Stanford has built up with its stunts would be a pity to lose. Preserva
tion of a reputation, then, is one raison d'etre of a rooting section.
The alumni, coming back to the Big Game, expect to see the non
combatants, too, participating earnestly in the Roman display. Alumni
would be almost unanimously disappointed to see no colored cards nor
red hats nor "gyrating yell leaders" in the middle of the stadium's shady
side. To please the alumni is another reason for keeping the rooting
section.
There are very many, particularly lower division students, who derive
considerable pleasure from sitting in the rooting section. To others,
yelling and stunting is a bore —such a bore, in fact, that they prefer to
sell their rooters' tickets to high-school lids and hoary grandfathers and
to sit in five dollar seats.
If the rooting section, for any of the above reasons, justifies its
existence (we believe it does), then those who sit in the Stanford root
ing section should so behave in the section that no criticism can be made
of their actions. The older and saner men of the upper division ought
especially to attempt to set the moral tone of the section. Let's not rely
on policing by the Rally Committee; this is a problem for each man to
solve for his own satisfaction. In that way we can win back our self
respect.
"Consider the question of eliminating the rooting section," President
Wilbur advises.
Consider, also, the results of abolition. The student body probably
would receive but two tickets, rather than three, for the Big Game. The
"pageantry and carnival display" of that auspicious occasion would exist
no more on the Stanford side of the stadium. There would be no
organized yelling, and the singing would be weaker than it now is. For
these reasons alone, the undergraduate student body would disfavor
