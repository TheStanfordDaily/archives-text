# Generosity Like This Will Build The Theatre
## 
### 
Stanford Studios are to be congratulated. Not only did they provide
an amusing evening's entertainment for the patrons of their cinema pro
gram, but also they have donated to Chaparral's Theatre Fund their entire
profits from the last two nights' performances. The Studios' donation
probably will amount to more than $200 and with the $100 already con
tributed by Hammer and Coffin and the $1,000 given by the anonymous
donor, the theatre (what a pleasure to write that word!) already begins
to have foundations.

The proprietors of Stanford Studios might well have decided to keep
their profits to compensate them for their labor in making the films. It
is no less than noble of them to turn the money over to the Theatre Fund.
