# The 						Play Goes On
## 
### 
One by one they go. Yesterday we learned of the death of Wallace
Eddinger, favorite light comedian. Only a short while ago it was Theo
dore Roberts, beloved character actor —and Fred Thomson, whose
"Westerns" were the delight of small boys and men who had sneaked in
to see the six-guns blaze—and Larry Semon, whose comedy stirred lws
audiences to deep laughter. And do you remember Eddie Foy and the
"Seven Little Foys"?
John Drew, dean of actors, and Ellen Terry, grand dame of the stage;
George Beban and his pathetic Italians; Robert Mantell, the last of the
old Shakespearean tradition—all have gone, leaving their impress on the
varied pages of the Time Book of the Theatre.
Holbrook Blinn of Stanford, noted character star; Rex Cherryman
and Gregory Kelly, two of the finest of the young leading men—they,
too, are gone.
The overture is over aftd the play goes on, but some will not be
there to speak their lines.
Genius follows genius, and laughter and light arc enternal, yet it is
hard to read the roll-call of the year without feeling that something fine
is gone, never to return.
The death of an actor is the saddest thing in the world. But actors
never really die, for their deeds are etched in memory.
