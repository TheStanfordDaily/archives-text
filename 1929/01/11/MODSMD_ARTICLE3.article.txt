# Zoology Club Members Plan Yosemite Excursion
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Zoology Club
last night, plans were formulated for
a trip to Yosemite, probably on the
week-end of February 15. All students
and faculty members are invited;
those interested should communicate
immediately with George S. Meyers,
Natural History Museum, Campus. In
formation concerning those who can
bring cars is especially desired. It
was estimated that total expenses
would be about seven dollars per per
son.
