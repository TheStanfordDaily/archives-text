# The 						Bullsession
## THE 						MOVIES COME TO STANFORD 
### 
Roaring Roughs and the giggling
Five Hundred crammed into the As
sembly Hall to witness Stanford's
first effort in things cinematographic.
The house was enthusiastic to the
point of clapping in unison, heckling
the silent actors, and cheering either
applause or derision as the case hap
pened to be.
But gather round, aspiring movie
directors, cameramen, and Btars, and
consider well. In the news reel and
feature pictures that preceded that
inimitable, super-jewel, "The Fast
Male," lay the nucleus of a future
campus activity.
The motion picture is something
that even a conservative institution
of learning can not overlook. From
its own point of view as a publicity
means and as a recorder of Univer
sity activities and accomplishments,
a university must accept the practi
cability and utility of movies. From
the point of view of the motion pic
ture industry itself as a possible field
of endeavor for alumni-to-be of alma
mammy, a university might don its
thinking-cap and ponder a bit also.
An industry that turns out three
and a half million dollars worth of
product a week through the media
of one hundred fifty producing com
panies in and around Hollywood
alone is worth the consideration of
the talented and the ambitious. Then
for the social-minded think of its in
fluence among the yokelry of the
land.

With authorities in many fields per
forming invaluable experiments on
the campus, with visitors of note
coming to the campus, with students
doing any manner of strange things,
with the construction of new build
ings and the razing of old ones, with
the continual growth and change of
the University, there is much to be
photographed and stored away for
historic reference and the future en
tertainment of those who will laugh
at current customs and contempor
ary fashions.
Ernie Page and his crew produced
their movies at a minimum of ex
pense. They used small, home movie
machines, developed their own pic
tures, and practiced the closest of
economy with excellent results, con
sidering their limitations.
Expenditure incurred by the group
taking pictures could be readily offset
by a yearly showing of their work
in the Assembly Hall (or the Theatre
to-be). With the assistance of the
University a library could be estab
lished and all films could be filed and
stored for future use.
Movies of campus achievement and
campus life taken from year to year
and stored away can not help being
worthwhile as a means to train stu
dents in the first, embryonic steps of
the movie industry, as historic rec
ords, as instructive aids, and as a
possible means of revenue. Harvard
already is doing this. How about
Stanford? â€”Calvin 1). Wood.
