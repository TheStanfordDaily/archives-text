## WILBUR RIGHT, BUT ABOLITION PREVENTABLE 
### 
The Editor, Sir

President Wilbur's suggestion to
abolish the rooting section is entirely
justified by the apparent growing
tendency of rooting section behavior
during the last two years. Not only
has drinking and swearing been on
the increase, but the sportsmanship i
and courtesy shown visiting teams
and referees has been increasingly
rotten. I think it is safe to say that
every rooting section that sat oppo
site us during the last football season
outdid us far in courtesy and sports- \
clanship, and if the basketball game
last Tuesday was any indication, we
shall continue to be outdone.
There was a time, especially when |
Burt Lapp was yell leader, when boo
ing and unsportsmanship in general,
were absolutely taboo. Rally commit- j
teemen were distributed throughout
the rooting section and the would-be
booers were quickly silenced. Soon a
spirit of co-operation by the students
themselves made the frantic efforts j
of the yell leaders and Rally Commit
tee unnecessary. The sportsmanship
and general conduct was excellent.
The classes that have since entered i

I the University have not been thor
oughly impressed with the sportsman
ship idea, and the conduct has been
increasingly worse as the older classes
graduated. The efforts to restrain the
booers have been feeble and in many
cases, such as at the basketball game
last Tuesday, no effort was made.
To actually abolish the rooting sec
tion would be a disgrace to every
Stanford man. (I refer only to the
men because I feel that they alone
are to blame.) It would mean that
the men now at Stanford are of such
| inferior character as to be unable to j
recognize and abide by the rules of ;
gentlemanly conduct and sportsman- I
| ship. Instead of abolishing the root- |
; ing section, let's snap out of it and
demonstrate that we are all gentle- j
men and clean sportsmen. Surely it
| is obvious to everyone that booing is
only a bad reflection on the person
who does it, 110 matter how "raw" a
referee's decision appears to be. When
you see what seems to be a bad de
|cision, remember that "Silence is
Golden" and that booing belongs to
1 the cheap hick and tin-horn sport who
| does not belong at Stanford.

The Editor, Sir

President Wilbur's suggestion to
abolish the rooting section is entirely
justified by the apparent growing
tendency of rooting section behavior
during the last two years. Not only
has drinking and swearing been on
the increase, but the sportsmanship i
and courtesy shown visiting teams
and referees has been increasingly
rotten. I think it is safe to say that
every rooting section that sat oppo
site us during the last football season
outdid us far in courtesy and sports- \
clanship, and if the basketball game
last Tuesday was any indication, we
shall continue to be outdone.
There was a time, especially when |
Burt Lapp was yell leader, when boo
ing and unsportsmanship in general,
were absolutely taboo. Rally commit- j
teemen were distributed throughout
the rooting section and the would-be
booers were quickly silenced. Soon a
spirit of co-operation by the students
themselves made the frantic efforts j
of the yell leaders and Rally Commit
tee unnecessary. The sportsmanship
and general conduct was excellent.
The classes that have since entered i

I the University have not been thor
oughly impressed with the sportsman
ship idea, and the conduct has been
increasingly worse as the older classes
graduated. The efforts to restrain the
booers have been feeble and in many
cases, such as at the basketball game
last Tuesday, no effort was made.
To actually abolish the rooting sec
tion would be a disgrace to every
Stanford man. (I refer only to the
men because I feel that they alone
are to blame.) It would mean that
the men now at Stanford are of such
| inferior character as to be unable to j
recognize and abide by the rules of ;
gentlemanly conduct and sportsman- I
| ship. Instead of abolishing the root- |
; ing section, let's snap out of it and
demonstrate that we are all gentle- j
men and clean sportsmen. Surely it
| is obvious to everyone that booing is
only a bad reflection on the person
who does it, 110 matter how "raw" a
referee's decision appears to be. When
you see what seems to be a bad de
|cision, remember that "Silence is
Golden" and that booing belongs to
1 the cheap hick and tin-horn sport who
| does not belong at Stanford.
