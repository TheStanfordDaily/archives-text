# A 						SILENT PRAYER FOR THE OLD GUARD
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
While Stanford is glorying in a
smashing football victory over the
East, and an equally smashing victory
in the Presidential election, why not
give a thought to those who laid the
foundation for our victory?
It is a custom in the American
Legion assemblies to observe a mo
ment's silence in honor of the com
rades who had given their lives for an
ideal. It is a bond, poignant, deep,
and eloquent, that moment of silence,
bringing deeper significance to the
spirit of the Legion. What could be
more fitting than in Stanford's tri
umphant hour of victory to observe
a moment's silence at student assem
blies and alumni gatherings, in honor
of the founders of our University and
those grand old leaders, Dr. Jordan,
Dr. Branner, Dr. Sillman, and the
rest, who moulded it? To the students
it would give a deeper significance of
Stanford Spirit, of the debt we owe

to those who gave their lives to the
forming of it; to the alumni it would
be a tender recollection, calling tliera
back to Stanford.
Why not establish it as a custom?
It is not a maudlin sentiment; it is
reverent appreciation of those who
made Stanford and Stanford men and
women possible.
