NOW THAT IT'S OUT
Stanford Chaparral. January, 1929.
Most of you have probably read
from cover to cover the new Chappie
that came out yesterday. And to have j
readers familiar with subject of a
j reviewer's discussion puts him at a
great disadvantage. He can't do as he |
j ordinarily does, say whatever he j
wants to without the majority of
; readers knowing whether he's right
i or wrong.
In the first place, it is both refresh- !
ing and helpful to have Chaparral
take a really definite lead in getting j
what this campus needs badly—a de
! cent theatre. Only future generations
of Stanford men and women can tell
what Chaparral started. But "while
{ there's life there's hope," and we can
all look forward to a New Day when
I Stanford has a theatre with curtains
that work, and seats that are endur- !
able, and a million-and-one other
things the present Assembly Hall ,
lacks. I

And the humor —in this number of
Chaparral it's pointed. "The Student
Quince" is commendable. We sug
gest that the stagers of the Junior
Opera keep a text ot' it in front of
them; so they'll know what not to do.
Also, we're glad to see such a good
ly quantity of local writing. There has
! been a tendency in the near past for

, the best jokes in the magazine to be
the reprints from other sources. We
j dare to predict that the original jokes
in this issue will bo quoted more wide
ly than Chaparral has been for some
time.
And to close —the prize crack in
the whole book is, "Marry in haste,
j and beget at leisure."
