# Bids For "Frisco Frolic" Sponsored By Branner Club Are Now On Sale
## 
### 
Bids for the Branner Club informal
dance to be given on Friday night,
January 25, are now on sale and may
be procured from Wareham Seaman,
president of th eclub, or from Harry
Schoolfield, chairman of the dance
committee. The price of the bids is
$2.50.
Plans for the dance are practically
complete and it has been decided to
call it a "Frisco Frolic." Clever deco
rations and programs have been ar
ranged and the new feature of having
twelve instead of ten dances that
was instituted at the club's last
dance will be adhered to.

Frank Mathews' Louisiana Hi-
Brown Syncopators, the all-negro or
ganization that was given a trial last
quarter at the Branner Plantation
dance, proved so successful that they
have been re-engaged to furnish the
music.
