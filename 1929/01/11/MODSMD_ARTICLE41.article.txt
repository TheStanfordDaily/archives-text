# GOEBEL MAY GIRD GLOBE IN INITIAL NON-STOP FLIGHT
## 
### 
WICHITA, Kans., Jan. 10. (/P)—' The
most daring project of aviation —an
attempted non-stop flight around the
world —which heretofore had been re
garded as beyond the realm of possi
bility, today appeared near realiza
tion within the present year.
Furthermore, announcements of pro
jected flights, made here and in Paris
yesterday, suggested the possibility
of a race to realize that dream of all
endurance and distance fliers. Both
flights would be refueling ventures
and were suggested by the sustained
flight of 150 hours made by the Ameri
can army monoplane Question Mark
in California.
From a sick-bed here where he is
recovering from severe illness and an
operation, Col. Arthur C. Goebel,
noted distance and speed pilot, an
nounced that ho intended to be first
to take the air in an effort to girdle
the globe without a stop. He tenta
tively set August or September for
the flight, which lie said would be
west-to-east from Wichita to Wichita.

Between 60 and 75 women have
turned out to form a Woman's rifle
team at the University of Idaho.
