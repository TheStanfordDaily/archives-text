# HOOVER DEVOTES DAY TO CONFER ON FARM RELIEF
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10.
Bert Hoover gave today over to con
ferences chiefly with congressional
leaders on the questions of farm re
lief and tariff revision and his last
caller, Representative Willis C. Haw
ley," of Oregon, after being closeted
with the President-elect for some
time, forecast an extra session about
the middle of April to tackle both.
Hawley, chairman of the powerful
House Ways and Means Committee
which already has started hearings on
tariff revision, emphasized that he
was voicing his own views as Mr.
Hoover himself had said nothing on
the subject.
The Oregon member, however, said
it was his opinion the new Congress,
the Seventy-first, would be called to
gether about the middle of April, and
that an attempt would be made to put
tariff and farm relief bills through by
July 4.
