# YEARLINGS MEET SANTA CRUZ HIGH IN TILT TOMORROW
## 
### 
Although Stanford's yearling bas
ketball team should have an easy
time defeating the quintet of Santa
Cruz High School when they clash
! with them in the Cardinal Pavilion
tomorrow night, Coach "Rabbit" Brad
shaw is working hard to have the
squad in first-class condition for the
contest.
Yesterday the babes were put
through a stiff workout stressing de
fensive play, since it is in this depart
ment fo the game that the team has
had the least practice. In the two
games which have been played to
date the yearlings' greatest strength
has ben in their breaking fast and
getting the ball down under the bas
ket before the opposing defense could
get set.
With Jim Shrader laid up by an
injury to his ankle, Ray and Kelly
will start in the forward berths
against the Santa Cruz hoopsters.
Doub will begin the game at center;
while Baker and Rintala will hold
down the guard positions.
It is this combination that has
been showing up best in practice ses
sions, Shrader having been ineligible
during the first week of practice.
Doub has been Cardinal high point
man in the two contests, with Rintala
close behind; while Baker has proved
particularly valuable in backing up
the forwards on the offense and in
getting the ball odt from under his
own basket with plenty of speed.
