# Abolition Of Rooting Section Not Wilbur's Aim; Wants Evils Removed
## Phil Cavalero, Pop Warner Believe Causes of Complaint Can Be Eradicated if Students Take Action 
### 
PRESIDENT WILBUR does not demand the abolition of student rooting
*■ sections, but does ask that steps be taken to remove the evils which have
arisen in connection with them. This was brought out yesterday when the
President explained and amplified the letter which he sent to the Board of
Athletic Control on December 15.
This was also the stand of Phil Cavalero, president of the A.S.S.U., and
Pop Warner, who agreed with President Wilbur that steps should be taken
to remove the causes of the complaints. It was the opinion of both that
the students could easily remove the evils which have caused the complaints,

>if they would only show their disap
proval of the misconduct of the guilty
minority.
Following are the statements of
Cavalero and Warner:
Cavalero Statement
To those of us who are prone to be
somewhat hasty in drawing conclu
sions, our first reaction to any sug
gestion that our rooting section has
any serious defects which must be
remedied, is apt to be quite intolerant.
To many of us the rooting section
has come to be almost a tradition and
we are inclined to regard it as an in
dispensable feature of our more im
portant games. But, like most things
that are taken for granted, its true
purpose has been forgotten by some
of our students —and it is the conduct
of these few that is responsible for
the discrediting of the entire rooting
section. I believe that most of us who
have occupied places in the men's
rooting section have at some time or
other heard profane and obscene
language used indiscriminately and
in flagrant disregard of those seated
within hearing distance. Drunken
ness and disorderly conduct, some of
which is admittedly disgusting, are
the other sources of complaint.
That any of these incidents should
occur is regrettable, but the fact re
mains that they do and it is up to us,
the students of the University, to see
that they are eradicated by making
our conduct in the rooting section
above reproach. This requires the co
operation of every fair Stanford stu
dent who is willing to contribute his
bit to the welfare of the group. It is
the least any one of us can do, for I
believe that the majority of the stu
dents want the rooting section and
therefore it is distinctly selfish and
unfair for a few to conduct them
selves in such a way as to discredit
the entire group. For any of us to
say that many of the abuses corn-
plained of are not due to our own
students is a poor excuse, because we
are all aware that our rooters' tickets
are non-transferable.
President Wilbur's letter on this
matter was first read at the last
meeting of the Board of Athletic Con
trol and then given to me for con
sideration before the student Execu
tive Committee. It was considered at
the meeting of the Ex Committee last
Tuesday night and a committee was
appointed to draw up a resolution
condemning the evils which have
caused complaint, and this resolution
will be presented to the student body.
However, a mere resolution will not
remedy the existing situation. It can
do no more than bring the matter to
the attention of the students. True re
form can only come from the students
themselves. None of us want to be
guilty of conduct which will bring dis
credit upon the University. We have
no choice in this matter. The only
thing we can do is the right thing. We
at least owe this much to our fellow
students and to the University. Let
our conduct be such in the future
that it will bring words of commenda
tion and not condemnation.

President of the Associated Students.
Warner Upholds Wilbur
"I agree with President Wilbur that
foul and obscene language should be
eliminated from the rooting section,
because it reflects on all of the stu
dents, despite the fact that a few do
all of the harm," said Pop Warner,
Stanford's football coach, yesterday,
when asked what he thought of the
proposition which President Wilbur
put before the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
"However, I am confident that there
are enough gentlemen at Stanford
University to make the elimination
of the rooting section unnecessary. If
students hear others using foul or ob
scene language, they should show
their disapproval, and I believe that
this would remove the evil. I do not
now how serious it actually is as I
have never heard any complaints of
this type."
Warner stated that he did not be
lieve that the presence of the rooting
section at Big Games was a great
help in inspiring the team to play
I better inasmuch as the team was too
I busy playing football. He did think
| that it would be regrettable if the
spectacular stunts which provide so
much of the color at Big Games should
be discontinued.
He recalled the many compliments
which Stanford had received on the
stunts which were put on at the Army
game, where people are somewhat un
familiar with card stunts, and said
that he would hate to see this feature
go into the discard when the students
cculd so easily prevent it.

are all aware that our rooters' tickets
are non-transferable.
President Wilbur's letter on this
matter was first read at the last
meeting of the Board of Athletic Con
trol and then given to me for con
sideration before the student Execu
tive Committee. It was considered at
the meeting of the Ex Committee last
Tuesday night and a committee was
appointed to draw up a resolution
condemning the evils which have
caused complaint, and this resolution
will be presented to the student body.
However, a mere resolution will not
remedy the existing situation. It can
do no more than bring the matter to
the attention of the students. True re
form can only come from the students
themselves. None of us want to be
guilty of conduct which will bring dis
credit upon the University. We have
no choice in this matter. The only
thing we can do is the right thing. We
at least owe this much to our fellow
students and to the University. Let
our conduct be such in the future
that it will bring words of commenda
tion and not condemnation.

"I agree with President Wilbur that
foul and obscene language should be
eliminated from the rooting section,
because it reflects on all of the stu
dents, despite the fact that a few do
all of the harm," said Pop Warner,
Stanford's football coach, yesterday,
when asked what he thought of the
proposition which President Wilbur
put before the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
"However, I am confident that there
are enough gentlemen at Stanford
University to make the elimination
of the rooting section unnecessary. If
students hear others using foul or ob
scene language, they should show
their disapproval, and I believe that
this would remove the evil. I do not
now how serious it actually is as I
have never heard any complaints of
this type."
Warner stated that he did not be
lieve that the presence of the rooting
section at Big Games was a great
help in inspiring the team to play
I better inasmuch as the team was too
I busy playing football. He did think
| that it would be regrettable if the
spectacular stunts which provide so
much of the color at Big Games should
be discontinued.
He recalled the many compliments
which Stanford had received on the
stunts which were put on at the Army
game, where people are somewhat un
familiar with card stunts, and said
that he would hate to see this feature
go into the discard when the students
cculd so easily prevent it.
PRESIDENT WILBUR does not demand the abolition of student rooting
*■ sections, but does ask that steps be taken to remove the evils which have
arisen in connection with them. This was brought out yesterday when the
President explained and amplified the letter which he sent to the Board of
Athletic Control on December 15.
This was also the stand of Phil Cavalero, president of the A.S.S.U., and
Pop Warner, who agreed with President Wilbur that steps should be taken
to remove the causes of the complaints. It was the opinion of both that
the students could easily remove the evils which have caused the complaints,

>if they would only show their disap
proval of the misconduct of the guilty
minority.
Following are the statements of
Cavalero and Warner:
Cavalero Statement
To those of us who are prone to be
somewhat hasty in drawing conclu
sions, our first reaction to any sug
gestion that our rooting section has
any serious defects which must be
remedied, is apt to be quite intolerant.
To many of us the rooting section
has come to be almost a tradition and
we are inclined to regard it as an in
dispensable feature of our more im
portant games. But, like most things
that are taken for granted, its true
purpose has been forgotten by some
of our students —and it is the conduct
of these few that is responsible for
the discrediting of the entire rooting
section. I believe that most of us who
have occupied places in the men's
rooting section have at some time or
other heard profane and obscene
language used indiscriminately and
in flagrant disregard of those seated
within hearing distance. Drunken
ness and disorderly conduct, some of
which is admittedly disgusting, are
the other sources of complaint.
That any of these incidents should
occur is regrettable, but the fact re
mains that they do and it is up to us,
the students of the University, to see
that they are eradicated by making
our conduct in the rooting section
above reproach. This requires the co
operation of every fair Stanford stu
dent who is willing to contribute his
bit to the welfare of the group. It is
the least any one of us can do, for I
believe that the majority of the stu
dents want the rooting section and
therefore it is distinctly selfish and
unfair for a few to conduct them
selves in such a way as to discredit
the entire group. For any of us to
say that many of the abuses corn-
plained of are not due to our own
students is a poor excuse, because we
are all aware that our rooters' tickets

*■ sections, but does ask that steps be taken to remove the evils which have
arisen in connection with them. This was brought out yesterday when the
President explained and amplified the letter which he sent to the Board of
Athletic Control on December 15.
This was also the stand of Phil Cavalero, president of the A.S.S.U., and
Pop Warner, who agreed with President Wilbur that steps should be taken
to remove the causes of the complaints. It was the opinion of both that
the students could easily remove the evils which have caused the complaints,

>if they would only show their disap
proval of the misconduct of the guilty
minority.
Following are the statements of
Cavalero and Warner:
Cavalero Statement
To those of us who are prone to be
somewhat hasty in drawing conclu
sions, our first reaction to any sug
gestion that our rooting section has
any serious defects which must be
remedied, is apt to be quite intolerant.
To many of us the rooting section
has come to be almost a tradition and
we are inclined to regard it as an in
dispensable feature of our more im
portant games. But, like most things
that are taken for granted, its true
purpose has been forgotten by some
of our students —and it is the conduct
of these few that is responsible for
the discrediting of the entire rooting
section. I believe that most of us who
have occupied places in the men's
rooting section have at some time or
other heard profane and obscene
language used indiscriminately and
in flagrant disregard of those seated
within hearing distance. Drunken
ness and disorderly conduct, some of
which is admittedly disgusting, are
the other sources of complaint.
That any of these incidents should
occur is regrettable, but the fact re
mains that they do and it is up to us,
the students of the University, to see
that they are eradicated by making
our conduct in the rooting section
above reproach. This requires the co
operation of every fair Stanford stu
dent who is willing to contribute his
bit to the welfare of the group. It is
the least any one of us can do, for I
believe that the majority of the stu
dents want the rooting section and
therefore it is distinctly selfish and
unfair for a few to conduct them
selves in such a way as to discredit
the entire group. For any of us to
say that many of the abuses corn-
plained of are not due to our own
students is a poor excuse, because we
are all aware that our rooters' tickets
are non-transferable.
President Wilbur's letter on this
matter was first read at the last
meeting of the Board of Athletic Con
trol and then given to me for con
sideration before the student Execu
tive Committee. It was considered at
the meeting of the Ex Committee last
Tuesday night and a committee was
appointed to draw up a resolution
condemning the evils which have
caused complaint, and this resolution
will be presented to the student body.
However, a mere resolution will not
remedy the existing situation. It can
do no more than bring the matter to
the attention of the students. True re
form can only come from the students
themselves. None of us want to be
guilty of conduct which will bring dis
credit upon the University. We have
no choice in this matter. The only
thing we can do is the right thing. We
at least owe this much to our fellow
students and to the University. Let
our conduct be such in the future
that it will bring words of commenda
tion and not condemnation.
PHIL CAVALERO,
President of the Associated Students.
Warner Upholds Wilbur
"I agree with President Wilbur that
foul and obscene language should be
eliminated from the rooting section,
because it reflects on all of the stu
dents, despite the fact that a few do
all of the harm," said Pop Warner,
Stanford's football coach, yesterday,
when asked what he thought of the
proposition which President Wilbur
put before the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
"However, I am confident that there
are enough gentlemen at Stanford
University to make the elimination
of the rooting section unnecessary. If
students hear others using foul or ob
scene language, they should show
their disapproval, and I believe that
this would remove the evil. I do not
now how serious it actually is as I
have never heard any complaints of
this type."
Warner stated that he did not be
lieve that the presence of the rooting
section at Big Games was a great
help in inspiring the team to play
I better inasmuch as the team was too
I busy playing football. He did think
| that it would be regrettable if the
spectacular stunts which provide so
much of the color at Big Games should
be discontinued.
He recalled the many compliments
which Stanford had received on the
stunts which were put on at the Army
game, where people are somewhat un
familiar with card stunts, and said
that he would hate to see this feature
go into the discard when the students
cculd so easily prevent it.
