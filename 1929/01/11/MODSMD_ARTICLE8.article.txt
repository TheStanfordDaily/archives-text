# Abolition Of Rooting Section Not Wilbur's Aim; Wants Evils Removed
## Phil Cavalero, Pop Warner Believe Causes of Complaint Can Be Eradicated if Students Take Action 
### 
PRESIDENT WILBUR does not demand the abolition of student rooting
*■ sections, but does ask that steps be taken to remove the evils which have
arisen in connection with them. This was brought out yesterday when the
President explained and amplified the letter which he sent to the Board of
Athletic Control on December 15.
This was also the stand of Phil Cavalero, president of the A.S.S.U., and
Pop Warner, who agreed with President Wilbur that steps should be taken
to remove the causes of the complaints. It was the opinion of both that
the students could easily remove the evils which have caused the complaints,

>if they would only show their disap
proval of the misconduct of the guilty
minority.
Following are the statements of
Cavalero and Warner:
Cavalero Statement
To those of us who are prone to be
somewhat hasty in drawing conclu

To many of us the rooting section
has come to be almost a tradition and
we are inclined to regard it as an in
dispensable feature of our more im

that are taken for granted, its true
purpose has been forgotten by some
of our students —and it is the conduct
of these few that is responsible for
the discrediting of the entire rooting
section. I believe that most of us who
have occupied places in the men's
rooting section have at some time or
other heard profane and obscene
language used indiscriminately and
in flagrant disregard of those seated
within hearing distance. Drunken
ness and disorderly conduct, some of
which is admittedly disgusting, are
the other sources of complaint.
That any of these incidents should
occur is regrettable, but the fact re
mains that they do and it is up to us,
the students of the University, to see
that they are eradicated by making
our conduct in the rooting section
above reproach. This requires the co
operation of every fair Stanford stu
dent who is willing to contribute his
bit to the welfare of the group. It is
the least any one of us can do, for I
believe that the majority of the stu
dents want the rooting section and
therefore it is distinctly selfish and
unfair for a few to conduct them
selves in such a way as to discredit
the entire group. For any of us to
say that many of the abuses corn-
