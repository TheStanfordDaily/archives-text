FORD GOING INTO ,
HEAVY PRODUCTION
j The Ford Motor Co. is now ready
to go into heavy production, is infor
mation received today by Walter G.
Bernthal, local Ford Dealer.
During the year 1925, the Ford
Motor Co. manufactured 750,000 or J
three-quarters of a million new model
"A" cars and trucks, and a schedule :
of 2,000,000 cars and trucks has been
mapped out for the present year. ;
Thousands of extra workmen have \
been added and with a daily present •
output of 6,500 cars and trucks, this J
schedule will be raised to 8,000 cars j
and trucks a day within the next few j
j weeks, and a higher schedule is set j
for a later day.
Proved performance is what you !
are buying when you purchase the i
new model "A" Ford car. There is no '
experiment about it. Letters from !
users show a delivered value far be- !
yoiul expectations—almost without !
i exception they stress reliability—you j
I sense a feeling of sincere pride in the
oft-repeated phrase:
"Let me tell you what my new Ford
• did."
A well-known tire company, solely
to test tires, drove a new Ford car
for 90,000 miles in six months. '
Throughout that time, the car was
run day and night, an average of
| twenty-two out of ever ytwenty-four j
hours. The entire cost of repairs was ;
only $38 for the entire 90.000 miles, j
Another tire company for the same i
purpose, drove a new Ford Model "A" j
] SO,OOO miles in a short period at a '
cost fully 60% less than any figure it j
had previously known.
A news-reel photographer tells how i
the brakes of his new Ford saved his [
life when, speeding through a bliz- j
zard to film a shipwreck, he found j
himself suddenly on the very edge of j
a 50-foot cliff. From a nearby county
a husband and father writes to tell
how the sturdiness of the new Ford
"saved the lives of my family" when
the car was struck by a hit-and-run
! driver.
