# HERBERT HOOVER PLANS TO CALL EARLY CONGRESS
## Hoover's Appointment Plans For Next Cabinet at Hand; Washington Stay Extended Special Session Will Dispose Of Two Pressing Problems: Farm Relief, Tariff Change 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. (/P)— Presi
dent-elect Hoover will be able to de
vote more time to Cabinet and other
appointments now that Congressional
leaders know that he intends to call
an early session of the new Congress
to dispose of the most pressing legis
lative problems to come before his
administration —farm relief and tariff
revision.
He has decided to prolong his stay
in Washington until Thursday in |
order that he may see as many Re
publican leaders as possible before i
leaving for Florida to remain away ;
from the Capital until just before his
inauguration.
This evening Mr. Hoover had as
dinner guests at his home Senator
Couzens, of Michigan, one of the
Htaunohest of his Senate supporters
in both the pre-convention and the :
presidential campaign, and Mrs. Alvin ;
T. Hert, of Kentucky, a vice-chairman !
of the Republican National Commit
tee, who has been urged for appoint
ment to the post of Interior Secretary.
Some of those close to Mr. Hoover
still hold to the opinion that the next
< hief Executive has made no deci
sions as to his Cabinet with the ex- j
of Mr. Mellon. Moreover, they
assert that the final slate will not be
determined upon until a few days be
fore inauguration.
There appears to be a general be-1
lief in circles close to the President
elect that there will be no women in
the Cabinet circle although rather
strong pressure is being exerted upon
Mr. Hoover to give a major appoint- j
ment to some outstanding women of j
the party in recognition of the im- j
pcrtant part women played both in his i
campaign and in the vote of Novem- i
ber 6.
Predictions running the round on !
Capital Hill are that in making up
his Cabinet Mr. Hoover will give
recognition to the Conservatives and
Independents of his party in about
equal proportions, while others are
that he will select several personal |
triends, who, while not generally
known in the political world, have j
demonstrated to him in the past their
capacities for the post to which ap
pointed.

There appears to be a general be-1
lief in circles close to the President

the Cabinet circle although rather
strong pressure is being exerted upon
Mr. Hoover to give a major appoint- j

WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. (/P)— Presi
dent-elect Hoover will be able to de
vote more time to Cabinet and other
appointments now that Congressional
leaders know that he intends to call
an early session of the new Congress
to dispose of the most pressing legis
lative problems to come before his
administration —farm relief and tariff
revision.
He has decided to prolong his stay
in Washington until Thursday in |
order that he may see as many Re
publican leaders as possible before i
leaving for Florida to remain away ;
from the Capital until just before his
inauguration.
