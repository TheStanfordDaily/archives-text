tain the extemporaneous character of
the contest required by the rules,
specific sub-topics will be assigned in
dividual speakers one hour before
they are to try out for positions on
the Stanford team Friday afternoon
in the Little Theatre.
"Each speaker intending to enter
the Joffre contest will be required to
sign a list posted on the door of
Room 200C, indicating the time he
will call for his special assignment
Friday in Room 95 of the Philosophy
building," said Emerson in making
his announcement.
Sub-Topics
Sub-topics will be handed out be

minutes thereafter until every con
testant has an assignment. One hour
after the individual has received his
topic, he will make a five-minute ex
temporaneous speech in the Little
Theatre. Specific instructions for men
intending to enter the tryouts are
posted with the sign-up sheet at
Room 200C.
"â€¢1 expect at least 20 or 25 men to
appear for the initial elimination con
test Friday," said Emerson. "Gradu

April 16 is set as a tentative date
for the final contest in which both
Stanford and California forensic stars
will appear. It will be held here this
year in accordance with the plan to
alternate the place annually.
The Joffre Debate is considered the
outstanding forensic event of the year
at Stanford and California and the
winning of the medal is the highest
honor to which a student speaker
may aspire. Last year Phil Cavalero,
president of the Student Body, won
the contest held in Berkeley. Robert
Hume and Herbert Wenig were also
on the Stanford squad and are ex
pected to try for the medal again
this year.
