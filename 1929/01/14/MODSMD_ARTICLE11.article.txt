"If you can get somebody to suggest
a practicable improvement for the
janitors' quarters, I would be very
glad to see that improvement made,"
said John M. Brown, the representa
tive on the campus of the American
Building Maintenance Company, when
interviewed by the Daily yesterday,
"but the money for making such an
improvement as might be suggested
| would have to come from somewhere
—and, I don't know where it would
come from —myself.
"Of course, 1 could suggest putting
| up a new system, a new building to
i house the janitors. But I don't see
where the $20,000 or so needed would
'| come from. About the only thing I see
tliat could be done, would be to grow
I a hedge to cover us up, you might,
say, that is grow a hedge to keep
these quarters, we got, out of sight.
Myself, I think these quarters we got
aren't so bad.
"Speaking about the article that ap
peared in the Daily last week, I would
say that it is my opinion that the less

| attention that is called to us janitors
| and our quarters, the better it is for
I everybody concerned.
"My company has been here now
| for about eight years and it's been
giving good service year after year or
! else it wouldn't have kept the con
i tract.
"Of course, conditions could be bet
ter for the janitors, but, after all,
1 they're janitors and the conditions
are about as good as you'd find 'em
anywhere. My men have been here,
j most of 'em, for years. Of course, I
get one now and then who doesn't
stay long, but most of 'em stay here
1 —and they're good, fine men, taking
'em as a whole. If conditions were
worse than somewhere else, they'd
leave, but most of 'em have been here
for years. You must have talked to a
couple of fellows who just came here,
! when you said they stay only a few
weeks. Most of my men have been
with me for years, and they're good
! janitors.
"In that article last week, you said
! something about blankets. It's not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time we get a new man. They're
good, healthy men, the men we get
i here. If the men need some blankets,
in addition or in place of the ones
they've got, in order to keep warm,
all they've got to do is come and tell
me. I'm always willing to co-operate
with the men, that is, for instance,
get them blankets. But they've got
jto ask me, tell me how things are. I
don't go inside all the rooms all the
time, because it would sort of em
barrass the men probably, but if they
come to me and tell me about any
thing that's wrong, I always do what
I can to help 'em out."
As Mr. Brown took the writer
through the rooms in which the jani
tors sleep, he spoke of the heating
facilities provided in the janitors'
! quarters.
"Of course, coming inside one of
these rooms, I stand here shivering—
you can see that," said Mr. Brown.
"But then I'm in the office all the
time. I'm not used to conditions here,
the way the men are. Of course,
there's no steam heat here —it would
cost too much to put in a system from
the power house —but most of the
men have got themselves electric
heaters, and I never kick about it, if
! they use a lot of electricity."
Speaking later about the showers,
Jor the lack of them —since there is
only one —Mr. Brown stated that there
; is, in addition to the one shower, a
j bathroom the janitors may use.
