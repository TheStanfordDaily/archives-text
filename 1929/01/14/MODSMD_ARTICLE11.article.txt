"If you can get somebody to suggest
a practicable improvement for the
janitors' quarters, I would be very
glad to see that improvement made,"
said John M. Brown, the representa
tive on the campus of the American
Building Maintenance Company, when
interviewed by the Daily yesterday,
"but the money for making such an

'em as a whole. If conditions were
worse than somewhere else, they'd
leave, but most of 'em have been here
for years. You must have talked to a
couple of fellows who just came here,
