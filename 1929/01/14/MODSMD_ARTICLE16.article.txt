# REDSHIRTS DOWN BRUINS IN FIRST CONFERENCE TILT
## Fawcett, Berg High Scorers As Stanford Trims U.C.L.A. 34-20 in Exciting Contest Confidence Expected to Aid Hunt's Hoopsters in Clash Tomorrow with Bronc Five 
### ANSON REEDER 
"We are not pointing for any par
ticular games this season because
j there are no set-ups on our schedule.
We are taking them as they come."
; The statement was made by Husky
' Hunt, Stanford's diminutive coach,
not long ago, and it looks at present
as though he and his Stanford quintet
! were doing that very thing, "taking
j them as they come."
The Cards, so far, have enjoyed a
happy and prosperous new year with
victories over the College of Pacific,
St. Mary's, and'finally over U.C.L.A.
!in the first conference game of the
season. The Southern team was a
heavy favorite to win this affair, but
! Stanford came through in great style
'to give them an unexpected 34-20
thumping here Saturday night. After
'this decisive victory, the Redshirts,
with renewed confidence, will tackle
| the Broncos from Santa Clara College
I in the Pavilion tomorrow night.
They may need all the confidence
j they can muster, too, against the in
vaders from Santa Clara, for this
i team boasts a fast combination. Last
| Thursday night they took the strong
! San Jose Golds team into camp by a
1 36-21 count. The Golds, by the way,
1 were the same team that defeated
; the Gaels by a good margin. That
means Stanford's cagers will have to
! be on their toes that night if they
are to come through as they have so
far this season. Scores probably mean
less in basketball than they do in
football, but it is interesting to note
that the Golds beat St. Mary's by ten
points, while Stanford beat the Gaels
by only two, and then it took an extra
five-minute session. Yet the Broncs
turn right around and give the Golds
j a trouncing. All of which means Stan
ford will have her hands full here to
morrow night. Connolly, center, and
Leahy, forward, have been the visi
tor's outstanding stars so far this
| season.
Stanford's football team used to be
famous for its second-half comebacks.
Now the same fever seems to have
struck the Card quintet. Throughout
the first half, except for the work of
Vance Fawcett, they looked ragged.
Perhaps they were overcautious. At
any rate the score at the end of the
half favored Stanford by only three
points. The count was 12 to 9.
The visitors came back with a
whirlwind offense which threatened
to wreack havoc when Linthicum,
Bruin forward, sunk two in quick suc
cession, and his teammate Woodruff,
center and high-point man for the
visitors, followed with another field
goal, making the count U.C.L.A. 15,
Stanford 12. Then the Cardinal crew
got busy. Berg shot two field goals
and a free throw before the Southern
ers realized what had happened. And
from that time on the Redshirts held
the lead.
Berg was high-point man for the
game. Fawcett, and Woodruff of the
visitors, tied for second honors. The
fioorwork of Berg and Fawcett was
flashy, and kept the stands in an up
roar most of the evening. Captain
Rothert and Reynolds at the two
guard positions played wonderful ball,
keeping the scene of activities down
near Stanford's goal most of the time.
Hawkins and McCandless both looked
good at center. Woodruff and Captain
Baiter did outstanding work for the |
visitors.

They may need all the confidence

| Thursday night they took the strong
! San Jose Golds team into camp by a
1 36-21 count. The Golds, by the way,
1 were the same team that defeated
; the Gaels by a good margin. That
means Stanford's cagers will have to
! be on their toes that night if they
are to come through as they have so
far this season. Scores probably mean
less in basketball than they do in
football, but it is interesting to note
that the Golds beat St. Mary's by ten
points, while Stanford beat the Gaels
by only two, and then it took an extra
five-minute session. Yet the Broncs
turn right around and give the Golds
j a trouncing. All of which means Stan
ford will have her hands full here to
morrow night. Connolly, center, and
Leahy, forward, have been the visi
tor's outstanding stars so far this
| season.
Stanford's football team used to be
famous for its second-half comebacks.
Now the same fever seems to have
struck the Card quintet. Throughout
the first half, except for the work of
Vance Fawcett, they looked ragged.
Perhaps they were overcautious. At
any rate the score at the end of the
half favored Stanford by only three
points. The count was 12 to 9.
The visitors came back with a
whirlwind offense which threatened
to wreack havoc when Linthicum,
Bruin forward, sunk two in quick suc
cession, and his teammate Woodruff,
center and high-point man for the
visitors, followed with another field
goal, making the count U.C.L.A. 15,
Stanford 12. Then the Cardinal crew
got busy. Berg shot two field goals
and a free throw before the Southern
ers realized what had happened. And
from that time on the Redshirts held
the lead.
Berg was high-point man for the
game. Fawcett, and Woodruff of the
visitors, tied for second honors. The
fioorwork of Berg and Fawcett was
flashy, and kept the stands in an up
roar most of the evening. Captain
Rothert and Reynolds at the two
guard positions played wonderful ball,
keeping the scene of activities down
near Stanford's goal most of the time.

; the Gaels by a good margin. That
means Stanford's cagers will have to
! be on their toes that night if they
are to come through as they have so
far this season. Scores probably mean
less in basketball than they do in
football, but it is interesting to note
that the Golds beat St. Mary's by ten
points, while Stanford beat the Gaels
by only two, and then it took an extra
five-minute session. Yet the Broncs
turn right around and give the Golds
j a trouncing. All of which means Stan
ford will have her hands full here to
morrow night. Connolly, center, and
Leahy, forward, have been the visi
tor's outstanding stars so far this
| season.
Stanford's football team used to be
famous for its second-half comebacks.
Now the same fever seems to have
struck the Card quintet. Throughout
the first half, except for the work of
Vance Fawcett, they looked ragged.
Perhaps they were overcautious. At
any rate the score at the end of the
half favored Stanford by only three
points. The count was 12 to 9.
The visitors came back with a
whirlwind offense which threatened
to wreack havoc when Linthicum,
Bruin forward, sunk two in quick suc
cession, and his teammate Woodruff,
center and high-point man for the
visitors, followed with another field
goal, making the count U.C.L.A. 15,
Stanford 12. Then the Cardinal crew
got busy. Berg shot two field goals
and a free throw before the Southern
ers realized what had happened. And
from that time on the Redshirts held
the lead.
Berg was high-point man for the
game. Fawcett, and Woodruff of the
visitors, tied for second honors. The
fioorwork of Berg and Fawcett was
flashy, and kept the stands in an up
roar most of the evening. Captain
Rothert and Reynolds at the two
guard positions played wonderful ball,
keeping the scene of activities down
near Stanford's goal most of the time.
Hawkins and McCandless both looked
good at center. Woodruff and Captain
Baiter did outstanding work for the |
visitors.

"We are not pointing for any par
ticular games this season because
j there are no set-ups on our schedule.
We are taking them as they come."
; The statement was made by Husky
' Hunt, Stanford's diminutive coach,
not long ago, and it looks at present
as though he and his Stanford quintet
! were doing that very thing, "taking
j them as they come."
The Cards, so far, have enjoyed a
happy and prosperous new year with
victories over the College of Pacific,
St. Mary's, and'finally over U.C.L.A.
!in the first conference game of the
season. The Southern team was a
heavy favorite to win this affair, but
! Stanford came through in great style
'to give them an unexpected 34-20
thumping here Saturday night. After
'this decisive victory, the Redshirts,
with renewed confidence, will tackle
| the Broncos from Santa Clara College
I in the Pavilion tomorrow night.
They may need all the confidence
j they can muster, too, against the in
vaders from Santa Clara, for this
i team boasts a fast combination. Last
| Thursday night they took the strong
! San Jose Golds team into camp by a
1 36-21 count. The Golds, by the way,
1 were the same team that defeated
