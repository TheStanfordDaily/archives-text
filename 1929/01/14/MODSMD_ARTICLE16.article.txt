## Fawcett, Berg High Scorers As Stanford Trims U.C.L.A. 34-20 in Exciting Contest Confidence Expected to Aid Hunt's Hoopsters in Clash Tomorrow with Bronc Five

"We are not pointing for any par
ticular games this season because
j there are no set-ups on our schedule.
We are taking them as they come."
; The statement was made by Husky
' Hunt, Stanford's diminutive coach,
not long ago, and it looks at present
as though he and his Stanford quintet
! were doing that very thing, "taking
j them as they come."
The Cards, so far, have enjoyed a
happy and prosperous new year with
victories over the College of Pacific,
St. Mary's, and'finally over U.C.L.A.
!in the first conference game of the
season. The Southern team was a
heavy favorite to win this affair, but
! Stanford came through in great style
'to give them an unexpected 34-20
thumping here Saturday night. After
'this decisive victory, the Redshirts,
with renewed confidence, will tackle
| the Broncos from Santa Clara College
I in the Pavilion tomorrow night.
They may need all the confidence
j they can muster, too, against the in
vaders from Santa Clara, for this
i team boasts a fast combination. Last
| Thursday night they took the strong
! San Jose Golds team into camp by a
1 36-21 count. The Golds, by the way,
1 were the same team that defeated
; the Gaels by a good margin. That
means Stanford's cagers will have to
! be on their toes that night if they
are to come through as they have so
far this season. Scores probably mean
less in basketball than they do in
football, but it is interesting to note
that the Golds beat St. Mary's by ten
points, while Stanford beat the Gaels
by only two, and then it took an extra
five-minute session. Yet the Broncs
turn right around and give the Golds
j a trouncing. All of which means Stan
ford will have her hands full here to
morrow night. Connolly, center, and
Leahy, forward, have been the visi
tor's outstanding stars so far this
| season.
