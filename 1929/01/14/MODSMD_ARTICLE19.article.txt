"If you can get somebody to suggest a practicable improvement for
the janitors quarters. I would be very glad to see that improvement
made." Thus spake John M. Brown, foreman of the American Building
Company's campus janitorial staff.
We will suggest some improvements, Mr. Brown. Put panes in the
windows; repafr the roof sTS that during rains streams of water do not
pour upon the place beneath; provide heat for the quarters in order to
obviate the necessity of the janitors building each morning in the yard an
open fire, around whose feeble flames they may keep warm from the time
they get up until breakfast. Provide showers in a reduced per capita
ratio—i.e., more than one to every forty men. Give new men clean
blankets, Mr. Brown —untattered blankets if possible. Do this, we sug
gest, or else in fairness refrain from charging the men $35 per month for
room (ha, ha!) and board which can't possibly cost you more than $25.
"They're good, fine men," you say. If they are such, we are Lind
bergh. The greater part of your janitors are uneducated men, most of
whom when they come here don't know the first thing about janitor
ial work. Their clothes are disreputable, and as a consequence they
appear disreputable—to the undoubted credit of the halls and University
buildings in which these men work.
Furthermore, they are good janitors, you insist. Some of them are,
to be sure, but not because of any great encouragement given them by
their foreman. Is it to be supposed that you advance the cause of
co-operation with the students when you say to your men: "If you have
any complaints to make, make them to me; don't pay any attention to
those snots of students ?"

It is your opinion, we understand, that "the less attention that is called
to us janitors and our quarters, the better it is for everybody concerned."
We scarcely think it is better for the janitors, because unless the Uni
versity authorities or continued publicity force the American Building
Maintenance Company to put up habitable quarters for its men, condi
tions will keep on getting worse until fire or disease enter into those
shacks and take their tolls of lives.

pour upon the place beneath; provide heat for the quarters in order to
obviate the necessity of the janitors building each morning in the yard an
open fire, around whose feeble flames they may keep warm from the time
they get up until breakfast. Provide showers in a reduced per capita
ratio—i.e., more than one to every forty men. Give new men clean
blankets, Mr. Brown —untattered blankets if possible. Do this, we sug
gest, or else in fairness refrain from charging the men $35 per month for
room (ha, ha!) and board which can't possibly cost you more than $25.
"They're good, fine men," you say. If they are such, we are Lind
bergh. The greater part of your janitors are uneducated men, most of
whom when they come here don't know the first thing about janitor
ial work. Their clothes are disreputable, and as a consequence they
appear disreputable—to the undoubted credit of the halls and University
buildings in which these men work.
Furthermore, they are good janitors, you insist. Some of them are,
to be sure, but not because of any great encouragement given them by
their foreman. Is it to be supposed that you advance the cause of
co-operation with the students when you say to your men: "If you have
any complaints to make, make them to me; don't pay any attention to
those snots of students ?"

It is your opinion, we understand, that "the less attention that is called
to us janitors and our quarters, the better it is for everybody concerned."
We scarcely think it is better for the janitors, because unless the Uni
versity authorities or continued publicity force the American Building
Maintenance Company to put up habitable quarters for its men, condi
tions will keep on getting worse until fire or disease enter into those
shacks and take their tolls of lives.
"If you can get somebody to suggest a practicable improvement for
the janitors quarters. I would be very glad to see that improvement
made." Thus spake John M. Brown, foreman of the American Building
Company's campus janitorial staff.
We will suggest some improvements, Mr. Brown. Put panes in the
windows; repafr the roof sTS that during rains streams of water do not
pour upon the place beneath; provide heat for the quarters in order to
obviate the necessity of the janitors building each morning in the yard an
open fire, around whose feeble flames they may keep warm from the time
they get up until breakfast. Provide showers in a reduced per capita
