# Judge Lindsey's "Erratic" Ideas
## 
### 
Judge Ben B. Lindsey is promulgating "erratic ideas" which would
involved "tragic consequences"—at least that is the opinion of the Palo
Alto Times, in an editorial printed when the Judge was in San Francisco
recently. Commenting on an interview, the Times says, among other
things, that "instead of releasing womankind from 'abject slavery to sex,'
the Lindsey marriage scheme would only victimize more women hope
lessly into that status."
Now this statement of the Times may be very true, and then again it
may not. But the attitude the Times seems to take is hardly a defensible
one.
There has been altogether too much "Lindsey-baiting" in this country,
and it was not a particularly sterling defense of Morality that the Times
made. It only followed the conventional path. Every time a man advo
cates reform on smug institutions, a tide of ridicule, invective, spleen,
and personal bias turns on him.
Perhaps Judge Lindsey's ideas are wrong; certainly his vaudeville
appearances, evidently scheduled so that his message might be wide
spread, tended to cheapen his stand. Perhaps Judge Lindsey is off on
an impossible tangent; certainly he is ahead of his time.
But one thing remains—one that the Times has not bothered to con
sider—Judge Lindsey is sincere, and he advocates a definite and well
weighed reform. Years of experience have engenedered his ideals. Can
his critics say as much ?
Whatever your views on marriage, companionate or otherwise; what
ever your stand on Judge Lindsey's proposal, you will be sure that the
Judge has a right to be considered as an earnest, intelligent, and sympa
thetic gentleman, not a half-baked radical.
Then Judge Lindsey's "erratic ideas" may take on new significance.
