# The 						Junior College’s Ambition Needs Curbing
## 
### 
Professor Proctor of the Education Department, in a letter to the
Palo Alto Times, emphasizes President Campbell's point that the State
government ought to continue to discourage the establishment of four
year "junior" colleges in the communities. Certain ambitious cities want
to have colleges of their own and seem foolishly willing to pay for them.
Yet from the point of view of the educator, it is apparent that four-year
institutions in hamlets here and there would soon drain the supply of
good teachers; would from the outset be unable to give proper advanced
instruction; and would be filling a need already taken care of by the
colleges now existent.
There is at Pasadena, Professor Proctor points out, a four-year junior
college, but this comprises grades eleven, twelve, thirteen, and fourteen,
including students of the ages from sixteen to twenty It is supposed to
be the best form of junior college, because it takes the student at the
time when he first commences to be "knowledge-minded" (to paraphrase
Lindbergh) and keeps him until he is prepared to go into the advanced
work of what is now the Upper Division of the college. The system is
financially and administratively more sound because it uses but two
schools —the junior high and junior college—where there were three
before—the junior high, high, and junior college.
