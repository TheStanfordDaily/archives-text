President Wilbur's recent and
much discussed communication to
| the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
| trol, in re "foul and obscene lan
guage" of Cardinal rooters, evidently
caused certain thoughtless souls to
wonder if students at the University
of California so forget their gentle
manly instincts as to hurl unsavory
x-emarks during football games.
Tsk! Tsk! Heaven forbid! Just
imagine asking that!
According to a San Francisco
morning newspaper, Bill Monohan,
graduate manager at the Berkeley
institution, made known his belief
recently that California rooters
don't swear during football games.
All of which reminds us of Mayor
Rolph's classic statement that he
wouldn't know where to buy a drink
in San Francisco. There are those
who made bo bold as to opine that
Mayor Rolph must never have had
occasion to try.
Likewise, we wager that Mr.
Monohan wasn't sitting in the Cali
fornia rooting section during the
Bear-Georgia Tech melee, when
Roy Riegels, next year's skipper of
the Berkeley eleven, misread the
points of the compass and navi
gated directly away from his home
port.
It has been said —and the reports
were reasonably reliable, too — that
the California boys and girls didn't
jump up and recite nursery rhymes
or the ten commandments just fol- :
lowing young Mr. Riegels' immortal
act.
But then, of course, Mr. Monohan
knows best.
But it certainly is a moot ques
tion if rooting sections need de
fense. No one, not even Dr. Wilbur,
believes that the rooting section, as
such, is anything but a colorful,
unique institution, well nigh indis
pensable from the point of view of
gridiron glamour.
It is the actions of certain "gentle- (
men" who occupy seats therein that j
have caused the rumpus. Anyone who '
has been in the Stanford rooting sec
tion during football games, and has
been a possessor of unimpaired audi
tory facilities, will admit that the lan- ,
guage of the hoi polloi of the cheerers
isn't that approved in the best church
circles.
It is ridiculous to say that Cali
fornia rooting sections haven't their
gutter-mouthed members, and it is
equally ridiculous to say that the
Cardinal adherents are all perfect- j
ly genteel.

All of which takes us for another
ride on the merry-go-round — back
•where we started from —to the point
that "something must be done." Dr.
Campbell and Mr. Monohan may issue
their defenses and their beliefs from
now till the kingdom come, but the
problem still remains with the Stan
ford rooters whether or not they
choose to run.
