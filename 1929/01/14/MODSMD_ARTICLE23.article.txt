Stanford will debate U.S.C. here to
night on the detriments of modern
advertising.
Anyone who has been in Los An
geles ought to know all about the

Now that Ernie Nevers has given

ments by debaters?
F'rinstance:
Honk Harrass, renowned arguer: "1
always smoke 'Mucky Swipes'—they

Or —Harry Halter, famed baseball
coach: "Three Lucky Strikes and
you're out."
Suggestion for a Gillette ad:
"Ask the man who hones one."
The roommate's lament: "Gillette
