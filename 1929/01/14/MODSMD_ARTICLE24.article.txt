"AND ALL CARDINALS DAMNED"
Ssssssssky — rocket — 800m —Ah—
Mephisto!! The All-Hell fullback has
charged down the field casting aside
the Beelzebub defense like so many
flies and has scored a touchdown.
The Stanford rooters are in a frenzy.
The Day of Judgment has come and
the sheep have been herded from the
goats. The saintly sheep are strum
ming harps and singing All Hail Blue
and Gold in hymnal version. Where
as the sinning Roughs are whooping
it up at the Hades Big Game.
Strange as it may seem, by the
theory of neumesmatics (don't look
this up in the dictionary because it
isn't there) and by aid of sundry
supernatural devices, it is seen clearly
that all Californians are angels and
all Cardinals damned.
Stanford rooters are characterized
by their own president as causing
"complaints in regard to the use of
foul, obscene, and profane language."
Whereas the impeccable Berkeleyans
are touted by their president to be
above this. In his own words, "For
several years my seats at the football
games have been adjoining the root
ing section; neither my friends nor I
ever have noticed any actions or lan
guage that could cause complaint."

That the Stanford rooters are alone
in this thing of offending others by
their language at games can not be

true. The composition of the Califor
nia and the Stanford rooting sections
doesn't differ that much. Is the con
clusion then to be made or not that
there is no ground for complaint?

The facts of the case are that com
plaint has been made about the Stan
ford rooting section and that the elim
ination of that body is under consid
eration. California lias had no com
plaints and is not considering elimin
ating its rooting section. Should the
consideration by the Stanford author
ities result in the elimination of the
rooting section, Big Games in point
of color and enthusiasm will suffer
a severe jolt.
Nothing is more noticeable to the
westerner in the eastern games than
the lack of rooting sections. A root
ing section in itself is certainly a
harmless thing. To the major portion
of the crowd in the stadium, it is a
distinct asset, a portion of the value
received for the five-dollar ticket. To
alumni and students in general, Big
Game stunts and organized rooting
add zest to the fray. The many need
not suffer for the few. Let the root
ing section be given a chance and let
those who want it act as strong and
effective soft pedals for the vocifer
ous who insist upon speaking in re
sounding and entirely superfluous im
precations.
