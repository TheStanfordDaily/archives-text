Between War and Peace. By Florence
Brewer Boeckel. (New York. The
MacMillan Company, 1928.)
This book, subtitled "A Handbook
for Peace Workers," is by the educa- I
tion director of the National Council
for the Prevention of War,, and is
written throughout as a textbook for
campaigning against war. The author
takes the stand that wars are not a
result of human nature, but the re
sult of deliberate action on the parts
of governments, which can be pre
vented only by the action of a ma
jority of the people who have been !
educated to know that they can have
peace if they demand it.
The book is not written for the en
lightenment of the masses, but, as its
subtitle says, as a handbook for i
peace workers. More than half the |
book deals with methods of dealing
with special groups in focusing the i
demand for peace, while the remain- I
der is a study of influences for and
against peace, with chapters devoted
to the League of Nations, internation- |
al labor organization, the World j
Court, the Kellogg Treaty, interna- j
tional law, pacifism, reduction of
armaments, militarism, the Monroe
Doctrine, imperialism, world popula
tion, and similar topics.
One of the most valuable portions
of the volume is a comprehensive
bibliography of over forty pages, list
ing works on war, international rela

tions, the peace movement, and im
portant fiction and drama dealing
with war and peace. —M. S.

The Berkeley Street Mystery. Mr. R.
P. Hatch. (Boston: L. C. Page &
Co.)
To prove that reviewers have extra
weak moments, brought on often by
too much history reading, we present
today a mystery story of very ordi
nary caliber.
All set now? Close your eyes —
! tight — and think of everything a de
tective story should not be. Now open
them, and, presto, you have a good
idea of "The Berkeley Street Mys
tery." It reads like a milky, silly
I love story similar to those in paper
; back novels that used to cost two
bits, or less when bought second-hand.
I There are murders in it, and there
!is a detective; but the murders are
presented with no more thrill than
! might have been used to report a
| friendly game of tiddly-winks, and
i the detective's methods are so child
ishly crude that he would have been
off" instantly by any crim
inal worthy of calling Chicago his
I home.
And our esteemed sleuth, who
! lieavy-foots it through this saccharine
| mystery story, never does discover
j who committed the first murder .

The Berkeley Street Mystery. Mr. R.
P. Hatch. (Boston: L. C. Page &
Co.)
To prove that reviewers have extra
weak moments, brought on often by
too much history reading, we present
today a mystery story of very ordi
nary caliber.
All set now? Close your eyes —
! tight — and think of everything a de
tective story should not be. Now open
them, and, presto, you have a good
idea of "The Berkeley Street Mys
tery." It reads like a milky, silly
I love story similar to those in paper
; back novels that used to cost two
bits, or less when bought second-hand.
I There are murders in it, and there
!is a detective; but the murders are
presented with no more thrill than
! might have been used to report a
| friendly game of tiddly-winks, and
i the detective's methods are so child
ishly crude that he would have been
off" instantly by any crim
inal worthy of calling Chicago his
I home.
And our esteemed sleuth, who
! lieavy-foots it through this saccharine
| mystery story, never does discover
j who committed the first murder .
—CLIFFORD F. WEIGLE.
Between War and Peace. By Florence
Brewer Boeckel. (New York. The
MacMillan Company, 1928.)
This book, subtitled "A Handbook
for Peace Workers," is by the educa- I
tion director of the National Council
for the Prevention of War,, and is
written throughout as a textbook for
campaigning against war. The author
takes the stand that wars are not a
result of human nature, but the re
sult of deliberate action on the parts
of governments, which can be pre
vented only by the action of a ma
jority of the people who have been !
educated to know that they can have
peace if they demand it.
The book is not written for the en
lightenment of the masses, but, as its
subtitle says, as a handbook for i
peace workers. More than half the |
book deals with methods of dealing
with special groups in focusing the i
demand for peace, while the remain- I
der is a study of influences for and
against peace, with chapters devoted
to the League of Nations, internation- |
al labor organization, the World j
Court, the Kellogg Treaty, interna- j
tional law, pacifism, reduction of
armaments, militarism, the Monroe
Doctrine, imperialism, world popula
tion, and similar topics.
One of the most valuable portions
of the volume is a comprehensive
bibliography of over forty pages, list
ing works on war, international rela

tions, the peace movement, and im
portant fiction and drama dealing
with war and peace. —M. S.
