## NO LEGITIMATE REASON FOR ABOLITION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have seen three Big Games dur
ing my time at Stanford, and I can
not see any legitimate reason for
abolishing the rooting section. The
complaints that have reached the
President are all true enough, but it
isn't the whole rooting section that is
at fault. Of course the group must
suffer, and all that.
It is not to our credit that many of
our fellow students cannot conduct
themselves as gentlemen. There is
more drunkenness and obscenity on
Big Game Day than at any other ath
letic event in which the whole school
is interested, but why must it appear
that the whole school rises up and
curses loudly? Only a misguided few
make asses of themselves by doing
that, but the whole school is blamed,
of course.
The small majority of the students
who cause these unfavorable com
ments simply don't know any better.
They would be as foul in any other
part of the stadium as in our midst,
so that a move to do away with the
rooting section would only result in
scattering these worthy representa
tives among 80,000 spectators, and
that, to my mind, is worse than tho
present situation.
The student attitude toward all this
shouting and gin-soaked conduct is
hardly a tolerant one. It certainly
adds nothing to Game Day to have a
rowdy swearing in one's ear. And
yet the students cannot subdue the
unruly one merely by telling him to
key down. That, mode of action gen
erally results in a fight, if the rowdy
has been sucking on a gin bottle long
enough.
It seems to me that the best way
out of this mess lies in placing the
matter in the hands of the student

authorities, and not depending upon
the President to take the necessary
measures. "Conduct unbecoming a
Stanford Gentleman" certainly de
scribes the actions mentioned in the
complaint. We have the machinery
to take care of such cases. If a few
of the blacksheep were to be haled
before the Men's Council and given a
stiff enough sentence, there would be
fewer of these protests laid before Dr.
Wilbur.

I From personal observation I can
j say that the high schooL student in
(he rooting section is not the one who
earns the bad name for the rest of
us. After all, he is an outsider, and
; so he hestitates before cutting loose
j with a string of highly colored re
; marks for fear of condemnation by
i the other young animals wearing root
| ers' caps. No, the blame for all this
j unfavorable publicity must be lodged
'on our doorsteps. It is impossible to
| make an individual a gentleman by
| legislation, but we can deny him the
right to make it unpleasant for us
because he chooses to be a mucker.
Many people who do not know a
j fullback from a goal post, and who
; think that a safety is a little gadget
J used to pin things together, come to
j the Big Game more for the spectacle
than anything else. The very pres
i ence of that vast concourse of people,
the flash and color of the rooting sec
j tions in the late afternoon sun, the
1 music of the bands —that's all they
; see in a Big Game. To them, the sing
; ing and cheering of the root ing sec
-1 tion is part of the vaudeville, and if
' any of the actors offend by forward
remarks, they complain to the author
ities. This type of person has as
j much right to see the Game as any
one. We must be considerate of
I them, even though it is our day.

It is not the matter of abolishing
the rooting section that we must con
j sider —but the question of whether
Stanford, alma mater of thousands of
i decent men and women, is educating
today so many .filthy mouthed muck
ers that we cannot appear in public
as a group without feeling ashamed
j of being a student here.

The Editor, Sir:
The subject of this indignant stu
; dent's letter may be considered by

some moralists to be a trifle-ah-indeli
cate, but the need for complaint
seems to me so pressing that even
with faint heart and trepidation and
after a whole quarter's hesitation, I
take typewriter in hand.
There are on this campus certain
small buildings, the doors of which
will not shut, but remain wide open,
exposing to view certain Interiors
j which in polite society are usually
not so left open to chance inspection.
Cannot the campus mechanics staff
I repair these doors? —*29.
