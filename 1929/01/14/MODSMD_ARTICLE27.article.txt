# CHINA MOVING IN RIGHT DIRECTION SAYS EDUCATOR
## 
### 
"We all believe our country is on
the right track," declared Dr. Chang
Po-ling, president of Nankai Univer
sity, Tientsin, in his address on "Mod
ern China," in the University Assem
bly Friday morning. "If you look at
China through the microscope you
won't see much change, but through
the telescope you can see that it is
moving in the right direction.
"Before China was beaten by the
English she was very proud," said
Dr. Chang. "She called herself the
'Middle Kingdom' and believed other
civilizations barbaric. But after her
defeat about eighty or ninety years
ago she awoke to find herself wrong,
and now she really wants to change,
though it will be very hard because
she is so big and old.

"The Manchus, who were the lead
ing class before the revolution, used
modern conveniences themselves, but
objected to changes in the country
because they did not want to lose
power," asserted the lecturer. "The
fame is true of the militarists; but
they have been beaten by public
opinion. We cannot expect many re
sults yet, but already there are
changes in government. Since the
center of the national government
moved to Nanking there has been a
different spirit; the officials are work
ing hard for the government, taking
up complete tariff and treaty revi
sions, beginning work at 8 o'clock in
the morning instead of 3 in the after
noon. There is a new enthusiasm
everywhere."
What China needs most is a stable
ccntral government, in the opinion of
Dr. Chang, and they are ready to use
every soldier and spend every copper
to obtain it. The constructive work
just begun will be much harder than
the destructive; but the young men
and women of China are glad to have
the opportunity to aid in this under
taking. ,
Several years ago when Dr. Chang
was a sub-lieutenant in the Chinese
navy, he saw that the weakness of
China was in the people, not the
armies; and the way to bring about
a basic change was through educa
tion. He then pledged himself to
give his life and all his efforts to the
problem of education. This is the
third visit he has made to America,
gathering ideas in the fields of edu
cation and the natural and social sci
ences, with a view to bettering living
conditions in his country.
"I want Nankai University to com
pete with Stanford," concluded Dr.
Chang. "We are very ambitious; it
is like the thumb competing with the
thigh. But in using Stanford as a
goal, and the personality of your own
President Wilbur as my example, we
are bound to grow and sometime be
come your competitors."
