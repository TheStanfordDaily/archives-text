# EDMONDS HEADS GOLF RANKINGS; STALEY SECOND
## 
### 
A new ranking of both the varsity
and frosh golf squads, determined by
all the matches played to date, in
cluding the varsity-frosh match at the
Burlingame Country Club Saturday,
has been compiled and will also serve
as a schedule for the ranking matches
to be played this week.

The varsity rating is as follows:
(1) Ward Edmonds, (2) Larry Staley,
(3) Warner Edmonds, (4) Richie
Stevenson, (s)George Kachlien, (6)
Hob Syer, (7) Warren Johnson, (8)
Homer Bumaby, (9) Powell Smith,
(10) Bill Scott, (11) Bob Lewis, (12)
Kenneth White, (13) Bob Paine.
In the matches to be played this
week Edmonds will receive a bye and
beginning with Staley the even-num
bered man will play the odd-numbered
man next below him. The even-num
bered men are responsible for ar
ranging the time and place for the
matches. All matches must be played
by Saturday in order that new rank
ings may be made in time for the
contest with the San Jose Country
Club on that day, January 19.

The freshmen will play ranking
matches this week, using the same
system as the varsity with the ex
ception that, since there are no byes,
the uneven-numbered man plays the
even-numbered man next below him
â€¢ and is rsponsible for the scheduling
of the match.
