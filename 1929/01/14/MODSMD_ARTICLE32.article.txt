# SPORTS OF 1929
## Ready and Willing 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"Morris, Edward; home, Brewton,
Alabama; age, 28; height, 6'2";
weight, 185; bats right, throws right;
won 15, lost 17 for Mobile in 1927."
Thus reads the brief record of one
of the most promising recruits of last
year, as given by the official roster of
the Boston American League Club for
1028. The 1929 roster will tell, with a
pride that doesn't show in the cold
type, that "Big Ed" won nineteen
games for the Red Sox last season
while losing fifteen. Now no Little
Rollo has to be told that winning one
less than twenty games with a team
like the Red Sox is no mean achieve
ment.
The official American League pitch
ing averages show that Ed Morris, in
forty-seven games had a won and lost
percentage of .559 and an earned run

average of 3.52, which placed his
name above such famous hurlers as
Howard Ehmke, Red Faber, Firpo
Marberry, Ted Lyons, and George
Uhle. He worked 258 innings, which
is doing a lot of pitching for a first
| year man. Only six other hurlers in
; the league pitched more innings than
i Morris did. It was his readiness to
i work that so endeared Big Ed to the
j heart of Manager Bill Carrigan.
A story is told of how Carrigan
' didn't realize how good his big new
rookie was until Miller Huggins let
1 drop a remark that he'd heard Morris
' was on the market and if so to please
' let him know before he disposed of
I him to anybody else. Then Bill began
|to use Ed more often, and he dis
covered what a diamond in the rough
he had.
