# NEW LIGHT IS SHED ON CHINESE AND MODERNIZATION BY DR. CHANG PO-LING

### JOHN ROGERS 
"Education in China is not com
pulsory for the simple reason that
there are not enough facilities to care
for those who want to attend the
universities. It is not a problem of
getting - students; it is one of caring
for those who are there." Dr. Chang
Po-ling — tall, well-built, and with
slightly greying hair —said in an in
terview after he had been entertained
at dinner by the Chinese Club last
Thursday evening. "China's internal
trouble, which has been going on
since the second year of the Repub
lic, has hindered educational work.
We have neither the schools nor the
teachers."
Dr. Chang is president of Nankai
University, located at Tientsin,
China's largest non-government and
non-missionary university. He ex
plained that the majority of educa
tional institutions are run either by
the government or by the missions,
a very small number being under pri
vate management. In comparison
with the size of the nation, the num
ber of universities is very small, there
being about sixty missionary univer
sities and approximately tlirty be
longing to the government.
"All of these charge tuition," he

| said, "but not as much as the Ameri- j
can colleges after which the Chinese j
universities are patterned. The Ox- j
j ford plan is not followed. Co-educa
i tion is being tried out —at Nankai we
! have had it for nine years—and, while
the number of women students is
i still very low, at present women com
pose about one-ninth of the student
body."
Dr. Change is visiting the United
| States for a five-months' lecture tour,
and has not come expressly to study
western universities. From America,
he plans to go to Europe, where he '
will stay for three months. He re- ,
I marked that China does not regret
1 the trend of modernization that is
| sweeping the country. In fact, the
j younger Chinese think that every-
I thing that is occidental is the best
j that there is. Today, English is
i taught in practically all the schools,
j he said.
"China's internal trouble has only
i indirectly hurt her universities," he
j continued. "No material damage has
I been done them, although soldiers
| have at times occupied the buildings
■ and used them as barracks. The
| main difficulties caused by the strug
gle are the serious lack of finances to :
carry on the Work and the drain the
wars have made on the students."
