# SENATE SEEKS TO CLEAN UP KELLOGG ROW
## Borah Will Ask Limitation on Treaty Discussion; Cruiser Bill Next 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 13. (Jp) â€” A
; blockade in the Senate growing out
I of the treaty-cruiser row is threaten
ing the entire legislative program of
this session in Congress and leaders
were preparing with some anxiety to
day for a showdown on the situation.
The certainty that a special session
| will be called early in the spring for
i consideration of farm relief and the
tariff removes those issues from
! House and Senate dockets and is ex
! pected to go a long way in clearing
I up the tangle.
The first move in breaking the
blockade will be taken tomorrow by
Chairman Borah of the Foreign Rela
j tions Committee when he will ask
! that further debate on the Kellogg
Treaty to renounce war be limited.
| Meanwhile opponents of the treaty
who are seeking some expression in
the pact to clarify American rights
! under the Monroe Doctrine have been
busy circulating a petition for the
Foreign Relations Committee to bring
in a report setting forth these rights
as expressed by Senator Borah dur
ing his discussion of the pact.
In expectation that the treaty will
| come to a vote on ratification some
i time during the week, the Senate is
preparing to turn to the bill for the
construction of fifteen cruisers which
also faces some rough treatment be
fore it will come to a vote.
Lodged behind the treaty and
cruiser measures in the Senate is the
long list of necessary appropriation
bills to provide funds for running the
; government during the approaching
j fiscal year. Only one of the nine regu
! lar supply measures has received
i final Congressional approval and
! leaders intend to devote first con
sideration to these this week. Some
steady work will clear the calendar
of these and that steady work is
planned along with the grind on the
j treaty and cruisers.
