# CIVILIZATION TO WIPE OUT MEXICAN APACHES
## 
### 
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Jan. 13. (/P)—The
Old West lived again today along the
Mexican border, conjured up from the j
novels in which it had slept for 40
; years by a vigilante expedition |
against a small but murderous band
of Apache Indians living in the wilds
of the Sierra Madre mountains of
Sonora, Mexico.
The civilization which forced Gero-
I nimo and the Chiricahua band of
Apaches out of southern Arizona and |
j New Mexico in the '80's following a j
series of depredations and uncanny |
! Indian escapes, nine days ago for the '
first time began to feel its way into
the rugged mountains of Sonora, to
; wipe out the last descendants of the
most famous of Indian chieftains in
the Southwest.
BERKELEY, Jan. 13. —Roy Riegels,
| U.C.'s most famous captain-elect, is
receiving stacks of fan mail regard
ing his 74-yard run in the wrong direc
tion during the California-Georgia
Tech New Year's game at Pasadena.
The mail includes mash notes, propo
; sals of marriage, and attempts to col-
I lect bets lost because of the blunder
j made by Riegels.
Every member of the University of
Washington team was above the
scholastic standard set for participa
tion.
