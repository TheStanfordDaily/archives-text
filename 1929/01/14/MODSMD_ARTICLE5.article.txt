# CARD TRACKMEN GIVE PROMISE OF BIG 1929 SEASON
## 
### 
A series of creditable performances j
in the regular practice meet last Fri- j
clay indicates that the 1929 Stanford
track and field team is rounding into
form for another victorious season
with the capturing of I.C.A.A.A.A.
honors for the third consecutive year
as its ultimate goal. Friday's per- j
formances were not exceptional, not
even good enough to take first places j
in most of the meets the Cards will
participate in; yet the showings were j
creditable for pre-season competition, j
The best races of the day were the
two-mile and the 120-yard high hur
dles. In the former Loofbourow of the
1928 varsity finished a few yards
ahead of Bob Brown of last year's
freshman team in the time of 10 m. •
17 2-5 s. In the hurdles race Ward
Edmonds, who has gained consider- j
able renown as a pole-vaulter but lit- i
tie as a hurdler, broke the tape just ■
ahead of Captain Itoss Nichols in the j
time of 15 3-5 s.
Candidates for this year's freshman j
team showed promise in several
events. Hay, '32, finished second in \
the 440-yard run, coming in ahead of
Bob Syer and Maynor Shove; while j
Cooper, '32, placed second in the half- j
mile.
The sprints went to two sopho
mores, Dyer winning the century in
10 3-10 s. and McDermott the furlong j
in 22 4-5 s. Lauritzen was second in
each.
The performances in the field events
were only fair, Krenz winning the
shot and discus, Perelli-Minetti the
jrvvelin, Austin the high jump, Zombro
j the broad jump, and Edmonds the
; pole vault.
