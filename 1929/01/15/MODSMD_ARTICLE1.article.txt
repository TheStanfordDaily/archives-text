# VARSITY CAGERS SEEK VENGEANCE IN BRONCO GAME
## Santa Clarans Enter Game With Impressive Record; Three Letter Men to Start Cards Must Play Airtight Basketball to Retaliate Last Year's Overthrow 
### ANSON REEDER 
When tlie Stanford basketball team
meets Santa Clara in the Pavilion to
night, they will be out to avenge the
21-20 defeat handed them by the
Broncs last year. A preliminary be
tween the Card and Santa Clara babes
will precede the varsity contest,
which begins at 8 o'clock.
Three men, Connolly, center, Sher
man, forward, and Barsi, guard,
from last year's line-up, will start the
game for the Broncs. Cough, who
started at the other forward position
last year, may see action, although he
was released from the hospital only
a few days ago. Leahy, Gougli's un
derstudy, has proven himself a valu
able man on the court since illness
forced his running-mate out. Scliup
pert, at the other guard position, is
almost on a par with Barsi, and al
-1 hough not as seasoned a player, he
fits perfectly into the fast-breaking
offensive style used by th 6 visitors.
The Broncs have emerged victori
ous from every game played so far
this season. And their impressive rec
ord is not to be sniffed at. Among
their victims are numbered such
teams as the Stockton Antlers Club,
the San Jose Colds, and a long list of
-club and town teams.
Nearly every game has been won
by twenty points or more, their
closest contest being with the Golds
whom they defeated by a 3(3-21 score.
It is interesting to note that this San
Jose team, which they defeated, is
< omposed of such cage stars as Talt
and Watson, formerly of the Univer
sity of California, and Biaginni, guard
on last year's varsity. Connelly, Bronc
center, was high-point man in this
game, leading the field with fifteen
markers.
The Cardg, so far, look like the
winning basketball team for which
everyone has been waiting the past
tliVee or four years. But Stanford's
quintet will be forced to display a
great deal more polish if they are to
polish off California when the two
teams meet in their first game Janu
ary 26.
Their work during the second half
of the Bruin contest, Saturday, was
real basketball. The whole team
played a whale of a game, but. if they
?\re to keep their record in the win
column, they may be forced to ex
lend themselves tonight.
Following the Bronc game, the
Card squad will spend the rest of the
week preparing for the tilt with S.C.,
t,i be played in Los Angeles Saturday
night.
The same team which started the
(J.C.L.A. contest is scheduled to begin
the game tonight.

The line-up:
Stanford — Santa Clara—
Fawcett F Leahy
Berg F Sherman
Hawkins C Connelly
Reynolds G Schuppert
I'othert (C) G Barsi
When tlie Stanford basketball team
meets Santa Clara in the Pavilion to
night, they will be out to avenge the
21-20 defeat handed them by the
Broncs last year. A preliminary be
tween the Card and Santa Clara babes
will precede the varsity contest,
which begins at 8 o'clock.
Three men, Connolly, center, Sher
man, forward, and Barsi, guard,
from last year's line-up, will start the
game for the Broncs. Cough, who
started at the other forward position
last year, may see action, although he
was released from the hospital only
a few days ago. Leahy, Gougli's un
derstudy, has proven himself a valu
able man on the court since illness
forced his running-mate out. Scliup
pert, at the other guard position, is
almost on a par with Barsi, and al
-1 hough not as seasoned a player, he
fits perfectly into the fast-breaking
offensive style used by th 6 visitors.
The Broncs have emerged victori
ous from every game played so far
this season. And their impressive rec
ord is not to be sniffed at. Among
their victims are numbered such
teams as the Stockton Antlers Club,
the San Jose Colds, and a long list of
-club and town teams.
Nearly every game has been won
by twenty points or more, their
closest contest being with the Golds
whom they defeated by a 3(3-21 score.
It is interesting to note that this San
Jose team, which they defeated, is
< omposed of such cage stars as Talt
and Watson, formerly of the Univer
sity of California, and Biaginni, guard
on last year's varsity. Connelly, Bronc
center, was high-point man in this
game, leading the field with fifteen
markers.
The Cardg, so far, look like the
winning basketball team for which
everyone has been waiting the past
tliVee or four years. But Stanford's
quintet will be forced to display a
great deal more polish if they are to
polish off California when the two
teams meet in their first game Janu
ary 26.
Their work during the second half
of the Bruin contest, Saturday, was
real basketball. The whole team
played a whale of a game, but. if they
?\re to keep their record in the win
column, they may be forced to ex
lend themselves tonight.
Following the Bronc game, the
Card squad will spend the rest of the
week preparing for the tilt with S.C.,
t,i be played in Los Angeles Saturday
night.
The same team which started the
(J.C.L.A. contest is scheduled to begin
the game tonight.
