## President-Elect Confers on Foreign Affairs; Extra Congress Session 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. (£>)—Cabi
| net and other appointments as well
:as foreign affairs and plans for the
! extra session of Congress entered
I into the conversations Mr. Hoover
I had from early morning until late to
| day with upwards of a score of callers,
j The subject of foreign relations
was discussed at an hour's breakfast
conference between the President
i elect and Charles Evans Hughes, for
! mer Secretary of State, and also en-
J tered into later conversations at head
| quarters during the visits of O. H.
Hammond, ambassador to Spain, and
I William Miller Collier, former ambas-
I sador to Chile.
Appointments of Louis S. Gates, of
! Utah, manager of the Utah Copper
Co., William J. Donovan of New York,
; and C. Bascomb Slemp of Virginia, to
his official family were urged upon
Mr. Hoover but their proponents said
the President-elect had given no in
dications as to whether the sugges
. tions found favor in his eyes.
Senator Oddie, of Nevada, pre-
I sented the name of Mr. Gates for
Interior Secretary, explaining that he
was an engineer and economist of
outstanding ability and a two-fisted
fighter. Mr. Cates is a personal friend
of Mr. Hoover.
The promotion of Mr. Donovan from
his present post of assistant attorney
general to that of attorney general
was urged by Harry Woodyard, who
managed Mr. Hoover's campaign in
West Virginia. Since the close friends
jof the President-elect have long ex
pected him to appoint Mr. Donovan
it was assumed that Mr. Woodyard
had become exercised about reports
that such formidable opposition had
arisen to the New Yorker that his se
lection was in doubt.
: The President-elect had an engage
j ment for a conference with another
cabinet officer, Curtis D. Wilbur,
Secretary of the Navy. In the political
gossip attendant upon Mr. Hoover's
; presence in Washington it has been
' suggested that the Navy Secretary
will be given a federal judgeship ap
pointment, probably in California,
something which friends of Mr. Wil-
I bur say he has desired for a long
j time.
