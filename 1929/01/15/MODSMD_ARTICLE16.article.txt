# BUXTON GIVEN HARRIS' ROLE IN MASQUERS PLAY
## 
### 
The role of the Countess de la
Briere in Sir James Barrie's "What
I Every Woman Knows," which will be
: presented February 8, has been given
' to Louise Buxton. This change of cast
! was made necessary by the decision
; that Janet Harris could not carry the
I part on account of her work in As
sociated Women's Students and her
I recent illness.
After an extended series of tryouts
! Lcuise Buxton was chosen. Miss Bux
! ton is well-known to campus audi
ences, having played the part of
i Cjuigley's wife in "The Devil in the
( Cheese," and having been in last
; year's Junior Opera.
I The character of the Countess calls
| for a breeziness in word and act, and
, Miss Buxton is especially suited for
the part. The Countess possesses a
i sparkling personality which is re
vealed in select French phrases, and
bits of clever repartee. She is gener
! ous-liearted, and is intelligent enough
to appreciate the real depths of Mag
j gie. The Countess, with Maggie,
! realizes "What Every Woman Knows"
jabout her husband.
Helen Ward will portray the young
! lady of fashion, Sybil, whose imperti
j nence intrigues the rising young poli
j tician, Shand. Maggie, however,
| through her intelligence and her un
derstanding of her husband, succeeds
in winning her battles over the beau
j tiful society girl.
