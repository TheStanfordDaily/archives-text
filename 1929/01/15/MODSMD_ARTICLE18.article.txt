## Cardinals Turn 75 Votes to Their Side While Trojans Lose 16 in Annual Debate Speakers Hurl Advertising Slogans Across Platform to Amusement of Audience 
### KENNETH MANSFIELD 
Stanford out-punned U.S.C. to win
!an audience decision in the annual
| Cardinal-Trojan debate held in the
i Assembly Hall last night. Advertising
j slogans were hurled back and forth
' across the platform in an attempt to
' prove that modern advertising is
more detrimental than beneficial to
society. Stanford turned 75 votes to
• its side, while the Trojans lost 16.
| Leon Carley opened the affirmative
j argument of Stanford with the state
! ment, "Ten minutes a day rolls the
I fat away." He then proceeded to
| demonstrate that the average Ameri
can is being made superficial, shal
j low, a mere part of a great common
| herd. Originality and individuality are
1 being lost through the influence of
i advertising, he contended.
Harris and Harris combined to of
; fer the audience a program of humor
hhat varied from puns to more subtle
bits of wit. Henry Harris spoke for
Stanford and Leo Harris for the Tro
; jans.
| Leo Harris contributed the classic
statement that the use of cosmetics
I by modern co-eds is based on the slo
gan of a paint manufacturer, "Save
I the surface and you save all."
I The men from Troy threw conster
nation into the ranks of the Stanford
I team when they asked if the Cardinal
debaters would advertise if they en
i tered business. Henry Harris, after
•some thought, answered them in his
! rebuttal speech. He said, "Gentlemen,
| if you were in hell, would you roast?"
Virgil Whitaker of the Stanford
( team gave a serious turn to the de
bate when lie attempted to show that
j advertising was responsible for the
j new cult of "the showy side" which
lis killing American originality. He
made the statement that even our
I largest universities are known by the
number of yards they run in the
I wrong direction.
Leo Adams of the Trojan squad
i maintained that modern advertising
| has brought all of the modern con
; veniences into our homes and raised
i 'he standard of living. His most note
j worthy contribution to the discussion
was, "It is certain that advertising
has done Encina Commons no good."
Clifford Weiiner closed the rebuttal
speeches of Troy with the remark,
"Advertising placards tells us that
this debate is held in the Stanford
Assembly Hall. This may be the As
sembly Hall, we are not quite sure of
that."
The debaters quite freqently drew
much applause and laughter from the
audience with their light patter, and
humorous sallies.
