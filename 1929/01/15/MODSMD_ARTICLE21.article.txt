# "Let Not Thy Left Hand Know What Thy Right Hand Doeth"

### 
Politics is again assuming a place on the front page, with Congress
trying to decide whether to write O. K. to the Kellogg Treaty with one
hand and to the cruiser bill with the other.
The Kellogg Treaty, toothless infant that it is, is finding hard sledding
down the legislative chute. Certain Senators, headed by Senator Bingham
of Connecticut, have circulated a round-robin petition whose aim is to
demand an interpretative declaration on the pact. Their natural Senatorial
curiosity to find out what the treaty attempts to accomplish has been
frowned upon by President Coolidge, who thinks explanations would be
reservations. He forgets that reservations, to be recognized, have to be
ratified by all signatories and that the dear pipple have a right to know
what will be the consequences of an oh-so-dangerous entangling alliance.
Baldly, the Kellogg Treaty declares that the powers subscribing to it
renounce war as a policy. That, however, goes a little too far for the
comfort of any nations, so the reservation is made that defensive wars are
permissible. This, as any good Coolidgean or Mellonian would agree,
comfortably would justify us in Nicaragua, where we so courageously are
defending ourselves.
The Kellogg Treaty is a lame makeshift for machinery which already
is in operation at Geneva. If the agreement is thoroughly toothless, the
Senate might as well pass it and then focus its attention upon the appropri
ation for cruisers. If it is not toothless, we had as well commence to think
once again about the League as a machine for peace.
