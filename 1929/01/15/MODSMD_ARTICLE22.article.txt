# We Must Now Man the Other Offices

President-elect Hoover is expected to select several personal friends
for the Cabinet, we read in the Associated Press dispatch in the Daily.
The news is very welcome on this campus, for among the officers of the
University are many of the very friends to whom the dispatch refers. It
will be gratifying if Mr. Hoover is able to battle the office seekers success
fully enough to allow the choice of a few trusted friends for the important
positions.
A great deal of talk goes about as to whether President Wilbur will
be chosen for the Cabinet. While he unquestionably would make a splendid
Cabinet officer, we incline to the belief that he will not be called, for the
simple reason that he is too valuable a man for Stanford to lose. It is not
to be denied by friend 01* foe that the University would be crippled if Presi
dent Wilbur were to surrender his post.
