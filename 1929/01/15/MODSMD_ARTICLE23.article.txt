# Sage With Your Morning Coffee
## 
### 
Propped against the sugar bowl, in thousands of homes in America this
morning, is one of a chain of newspapers, each carrying a column by Ar
thur Brisl>ane conspicuously placed on the left-hand side of the front page.
As hurriedly as he drinks his morning cup of coffee, so does the American
citizen absorb the sage advice of the Latter Day Addison. Whether diges
tion is materially aided by Brisbane is a problem that has yet to be worked
out.
"Today," the column is called —yesterday's events, that is, linked with
the dawn of a Better Tomorrow. It consists of brief comment on human
affairs in the news, as everyone knows. Ah, that's just it—everyone knows
Brisbane. Therefore, a good many people must read Brisbane, and out
of that multitude there must be a great many who accept the Hearst Gospel
Writer as their Household God. Brisbane does not argue a matter; he
states it. It is this quality, dogmatism, which the Waterloo Evening
Courier once called "The Current Fashion." It is not the current fashion ;
it is Mr. Brisbane's own idea, and he is using it to great success.
He is "the highest paid editorial writer in the world." Why? Ask
Mr. Hearst. He will tell you that no editorial is worth a whoop if it isn't
read tis here that Brisbane is the Modern Addison, with some of the
>f Aesop and more of the qualities of—Arthur Brisbane.
is like sage, it's great if you can make people like it.
