## "YOUNG MEN ON THE MAKE" 
### 
Success! Success! There is no god
but Success, and Activities is his
phophet! Muezzin Henry F. Pringle
cries this from the turret eminence of
Harpers Magazine. A new race of in
fidels has sprung up which threatens
the bulwark of college idealism and
high aspiration. "Young Men on the
Make." Thus does Mr. Pringle title
his article, and thus does he charac
terize the infidels. They are "gifted
with shrewdness rather than intelli
gence." They are "selfish, hard, and
ambitious." They are "over-anxious
top money" and have a point of view
which is "wholly materialistic."
Do these calculating university men,
given over to the vice of activity-par
ticipation, attend university to study
and achieve scholarly distinction? No.
Do they have serious purpose to the
end of broadening their horizon and
of making themselves cultured? No.
They are "intensely aware that col
lege is a proving ground, where the
first vital steps toward a material
Success after graduation must be
taken."
Further in his denunciation, Mr.
Pringle tells a story of a tryoutee for
the Yale News who, after making the
staff, rushed home to bear the good
tidings to anxious parents and died
because of his efforts ten days later.
Well, well, well, Mr. Peck, Mr. Shoup,
Mr. Beemer, Mr. Tucker, and all who
are visited by that scourge, the try
outee, did you ever? What a golconda
of co-operation, a heaven of efficient
assistants, a perfect Nirvanah must
Yale be.
Picture the scene. Old Eli wrapped
in snow and muddied by undergradu

ates. A town crier with a funereal
step and dirgeful tone passes through
the campus announcing that the great
travail, the test of men, the hazard
ous, deathly tryouts for the staff of
the Yale News, will be held.
Undergraduates scurry into rooms.
Small groups gather. Conversation is
tense, whispered. Emotion reaches a
high pitch and a lad stands exclaim
ing that he will try out "though hell
may bar the way."
The great agony is on. Tryoutees
are dying right and left. And then
the finish. The to survive is
told the news and succumbs, a hero
in death.
Ah me, were that this were Stan
ford. The Daily would soar to such
heights never dreamed of by Mr.
Peck and his predecessors in wildest
fancy.
liut to the point, whereas those who
participate in activities at Stanford
seldom die unless from lethargy, Mr.
Pringle has undoubtedly characterized
the attitude in part of many of our
contemporaries.
But why should he cry? The trend
is toward a realistic attitude, not only
among university students but
throughout the country. Success may
be the motive of Americans generally,
yet why assume that success pre
cludes the expansion of the self in the
fuller sense of the word. Are we to
conclude that material success and
its attainment mark the individual as
doomed to crass living, Babbitry, and
Philistinism? Without leisure the arts
and the finer things of life cannot be
developed, and without material suc
cess, leisure is impossible.
—Calvin D. Wood.
