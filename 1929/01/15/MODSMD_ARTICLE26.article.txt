# Campus Opinion
## ALUMNI OFFEND ALSO IN THE ROOTING SECTION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In defense of the Stanford rooting
section it has been our personal ob- !
servation that the really bitter and j
disgusting profanity and obscene |
language heard at a football game I
has come from the mouths of the !
alumni, and it has been in the most
part due to the influence of firewater.
There are always more old grads than j
students in an irresponsible condi- j
tion. We grant that those in the root
ing section swear occasionally but it
is always in an enthusiastic, unembit
tered manner. If there is ever an ex
cuse for profanity it would seem to be
on this occasion and in this manner, j
Now, to look at it in another way,
assuming that the use of various
technical words is not the customary
thing, how about the people who criti
cize their use by the students? In the
first place they should know what the
aforementioned words mean, and if
they do, and have heard them before,
they should not pretend that they will
be irreparably soiled by hearing them
again. Their criticism is pure prudish
ness aud hypocrisy. In the days when
they were capable of as deep an in- j
terest they doubtless used as com- j
paratively shocking language.
The rather sudden criticism which
has come upon us and the extreme \
measures which have been suggested j
have placed a blot upon the reputa- 1
tion of Stanford. Since the unfortu
nate question has arisen every news- ;
paper article concerning this institu
tion has made some facetious remark
about those "nasty creatures down on
the farm," and the president of Cali- \
fornia has found occasion to state [

| that his boys never offend in that
manner. To sum it up, more unfavor
;
able attention has been attracted
i than the conduct in question had ever
j brought in the past.
I There are always those who are j
! narrow-minded enough only to look
;at one side of the matter and not
consider the real motives and actions '
j involved. You are quite familiar with
| the person who is always trying to
j throw a monkey-wrench into the ma
| chinery to restrict its useful exist-
I ence. About the greatest asset we
could ever have is an officer in this !
j University who would encourage us
j and most of all look optimistically j
! toward the qualities of a Stanford
student's character.
Does this criticism come from one
who has had actual experience with
the rooting section? Does it come |
from one who is often enough in con- 1
tact with the life and interests of the I
students to appreciate the events
which arouse this fervor on their
part, or from one who is away from i
the campus much of the time and is j
forced to rely upon the opinions of
j others? Is the crime important
| enough to merit the strenuous meas
ures which have been advocated with ;
the ensuing highly detrimental pub
| licity?
' In conclusion, if we are as unseem
[ ly and offensive as we have been pic
tured, is it not better that we be
| segregated in a definite section, so I
that people know the risk they are
to run when they buy their tickets,
, than to have us spread all over the
stadium polluting everyone who at
| tends the game? —J.R. & T.M.

In defense of the Stanford rooting
section it has been our personal ob- !
servation that the really bitter and j
disgusting profanity and obscene |
language heard at a football game I
has come from the mouths of the !
alumni, and it has been in the most
part due to the influence of firewater.
There are always more old grads than j
students in an irresponsible condi- j
tion. We grant that those in the root
ing section swear occasionally but it
is always in an enthusiastic, unembit
tered manner. If there is ever an ex
cuse for profanity it would seem to be
on this occasion and in this manner, j
Now, to look at it in another way,
assuming that the use of various
technical words is not the customary
thing, how about the people who criti
cize their use by the students? In the
first place they should know what the
aforementioned words mean, and if
they do, and have heard them before,
they should not pretend that they will
be irreparably soiled by hearing them
again. Their criticism is pure prudish
ness aud hypocrisy. In the days when
they were capable of as deep an in- j
terest they doubtless used as com- j
paratively shocking language.
The rather sudden criticism which
has come upon us and the extreme \
measures which have been suggested j
have placed a blot upon the reputa- 1
tion of Stanford. Since the unfortu
nate question has arisen every news- ;
paper article concerning this institu
tion has made some facetious remark
about those "nasty creatures down on
the farm," and the president of Cali- \
fornia has found occasion to state [

| that his boys never offend in that
manner. To sum it up, more unfavor
;
able attention has been attracted
i than the conduct in question had ever
j brought in the past.
I There are always those who are j
! narrow-minded enough only to look
;at one side of the matter and not
consider the real motives and actions '
j involved. You are quite familiar with
| the person who is always trying to
j throw a monkey-wrench into the ma
