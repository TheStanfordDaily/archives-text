The Life and Death of an Ideal.
France in the Classical Age. By
Albert Guerard. (New York:
Scribner's. $4.50.)
Albert Guerard, professor of Gen
eral Literature, gives a new and in
teresting angle to the interpretation
of the Classical Age in France that
appeals both to the layman and to
the student.
Professor Guerard does two things
of special note: He correlates France
of the Classical era with the France
of today. There is emphasized the
necessity of understanding classical
France in order to understand the
country today. In his own words,
"France today is a fascinating battle
between the seventeenth century and
the twenty-first."
Then, the author traces the Classi
cal Spirit as a vital and conscious
factor in French culture in the 16th,
17th, and 18th centuries. In stating
the attitude toward the age which he
takes, and which he imparts to the
reader, he says: "Delicate souls en
joy the subtle odor of decay, as of
autumnal leaves, left behind by those
centuries of abundant and almost
coarse vitality. . . . Such will not be
our attitude. We shall not study the

| Classical Age because It is dead, but 1
because it is alive In France,
at any rate, the Classical Spirit is a i
live issue. . . , cannot quite under
stand Raymond Poincare without
Charles Maurras, Jacques Bainville,
and Louis Bertrand."
The Classical Age is interpreted by j
Professor Guerard to commence with
the Revival of Learning, which began
in Italy and reached France early in
the sixteenth century, and to come
down through Napoleon's regime.
Professor Guerard considers Napo
leon to have been the climax of the
, Classical period, rather than the first
i of a new era. Napoleon, to him, is the
highest representative of those three
factors were the unifying spirit
of the CkLssical Age—Rationalism,
and Classicism in art and
| literature^"
Throughout the book the author in- |
I jects fascinating sidelights on French 1
! people as a race —their thought, their !
i philosophy; their tendencies, and |
! their failings.
