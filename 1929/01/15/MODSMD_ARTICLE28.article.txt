# CABBAGES and THINGS

### PHILIP SPACE 
We endorse the following senti
ments heartily. Why shouldn't we —
we wrote them, as what don't we?
We are prepared with further ammu
nition, including more extra verses
to "The Son of a Gambolier." Here's
a printable one:
Oh here's to Physical Culture
And all enthusiasts!
We'll take them up to Menlo
Enclosed in plaster casts.
And mixed up in the mess will be
Stale cracker crumbs and glue.
We'll change their names and
play group games
Before our jellied zoo.
THE PHYSICAL
CULTURE
ENTHUSIAST
HEALTH —robust, merry, puls
ing Health —is a good thing. It is
such a good thing that here at
Stanford we are practically com
pelled to be healthy—or expected
to try pretty hard, anyway—what
with compulsory physical educa
tion, intimate structural examina
tion, non-competitive scholar
ships, and the long distance be
tween classrooms.
This Health Movement, not so
much a fad as a Clear-Eyed Craze,
has generated a particularly ma
lignant specimen of Boobus Homo
—the Physical Culture Enthusi
ast, Campus Post No. 433, series
B.
—And this Enthusiast on Mus
cular Matters is in Authority! He
is one of the Gymnastic Powers
That Be!
Kiddies Cry For It!
Standardized in silly, ill-fitting
gym suits, often white in color,
the humble frosh and the smolder
ing sophomore must stand on a
number painted on the floor and
go through an intricate series of
exercises in the Lower Foolish
ness. And who conducts the class?
Why none other than our old
friend the Physical Culture En
thusiast. How the kiddies love
him!
Through it all the Enthusiast-
Instructor grins healthily—some
times doing the exercises, some
times not, but always a glowing
specimen of what correspondence
courses, right-living, and a pull
on the proper string will do.
Games! —Goodie, Goodie!
It is on rainy days, of course,
that the student folk have the
best time. Instead of being dis
missed after the Drill to "your
various sports" they play games
—and such games! "Spin the
Platter," "One Foot Off the Gut
ter," and "Tap the Finger" may
not be among them, but we are
not so sure. Personally, we al
ways leave abruptly. The senti
mental memory of days in the
grammar-school yard is too much
for us.
But the Physical Culture En
thusiast stays, yes sir! And he
is just one of the boys, as you
may well guess. Volleyball, one
realizes, is his favorite game.
Come, Come, Mr. President
Abruptly, now, is it too much
to suggest that compulsory physi
cal training be abolished —or at
least that a separate ward be
maintained for those who encour
age the kindergarten? Not every
one has the time or the ability to
go out for The Team, and this
other alternative — Compulsory
Gymnasium — with the Physical
Culture Enthusiast — is really
too bad.
We enjoy sports, but we don't
enjoy folk-dancing. Please, Mr.
President, can't you abolish this
first?
