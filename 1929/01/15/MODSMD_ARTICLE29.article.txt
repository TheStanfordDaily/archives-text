All of the fur coats worn by
women on the University of Wash
ington campus this year were not
paid for by fathers, the majority
being earned by the co-eds them
selves, a recent statement by May
Ward, assistant dean of women
there, reveals. About twelve per
cent of the women on the Wash
ington campus are entirely self
supporting, according to Miss
Ward's figures.

The following poem(?) hailing the
i gridiron triumphs of the 1928 U.S.C. j
football team, was printed recently in |
j The Southern California Daily Trojan:
That Trojan gang has made a bid
For highest honors on the grid; j
They beat Stanford 10 to 0,
Washington State and Idaho;
And defeated 0.A.C.,
Who then, trounced New York
University;
And again they bid for fame
When thoy turned back the Notre
Dame.
And now we hall with glee
I Our national supremacy.
