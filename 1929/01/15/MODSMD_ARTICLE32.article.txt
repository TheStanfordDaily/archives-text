# HELEN FERGUSON "TOO GOOD" FOR HOLLYWOOD; SUCCESS EVADES HER
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
Just how good does it pay to be?
Helen Ferguson, leading lady for Leo
Carillo in the Duffy stage hit, "Lorn
bardi Ltd.," wants to know.
Until recently Helen was the model
movie star of Hollywood. Whenever
scandal touched the film colony, the
profession unanimoualy countered
with "Have you met Helen Ferguson?"
Poor Helen was Exhibit A—the
"ideal" actress. She had good sense
as well as good looks, and never let
her name appear on any page but the
dramatic editors' —the "Blue Book of
the Screen" described her as admired
by every man, woman, and child in
the studios.
Helen was the "ideal" as far as
character was concerned, but this
very goodness kept her from becom
ing a really great actress. Everyone
knew she was good, so when it came
to assigning an outstanding colorful
role the producers never thought of
giving Helen a trial. She was seem
ingly irrevocably typed—always she
must be the sweet young thing—be
the Spirit of Goodness.
Even Mary Pickford couldn't get
away with being goody-good all the
time. How could Helen become a box
office hit without flesh-and-blood
parts.
Helen Is Human
Once Hollywood makes up its mind
about a person, he is stuck to one
type of parts. Helen —and here is the
surprise—being much more human
than Bhe was suspected by the pro
ducers of being, finally decided that
something drastic had to be done. She
couldn't go on forever as the ideal
ingenue when others with far less
ability were getting vivid, real-life
roles.
So she signed with Henry Duffy and
started to play stage leads. Imagine
her chagrin when she finds that —so
far —she is cast in just as "good"
stage parts as Hollywood insisted
upon handing her.
I've known Helen for the past year
and I think Heaven should come to
her rescue. The public has seen her
on the screen and stage in roles
which are saccharine, insipid, and
colorless. In private life she is not a
bit that way.
She is pretty. She dresses very
smartly—one always seems to find
her arrayed in a new and striking en
semble. She reads a great deal —not
only novels, but poetry, and serious
writers that she has to identify to me.
She is religious—l never really "saw"
the Stanford chapel until I went
through it with her and we stopped
to examine every detail.
Has Varied Interests
And while she has these qualities
which Hollywood has so devoutly
praised, she has others which have
not been allowed to crop out in her
theatrical career so far. She is inter
ested in everything young people like
to do, because she is young herself.
She likes to dance and lunching at a
fraternity house is as thrilling to her
as meeting the most prominent of
persona.
That is another one of her attrac
tive points—her wide acquaintance
ship with celebrities in every line of
work. She has written interviews with
Will Hays, and she is a friend of
Gene Tunney's. She has a cute pin
Charley Paddock gave her, and she'

is the only actress who has ever
preached a sermon in a Los Angeles
church.
Her meeting Richard Halliburton
illustrates her sense of humor. Patsy
Ruth Miller, her best friend, had bet
Helen on which of them would meet
| the famous adventurer first —neither
knowing him. Helen was doing "New
| Brooms" when he was due to lecture
!in San Francisco. She started her
J "campaign" as soon as she found he
i was coming to the city, but no one
j was personally acquainted with the
j dashing Richard.
Meets Halliburton
Halliburton finally arrived for a
one-day stay. Helen couldn't find any
one to introduce her so she wrote
him a letter —and knowing he would
be very busy she made it a very
novel one. If you will recall Hallibur
ton's accounts, you will remember
that he ate only fish before starting
his daring swim across the Helles
pont. That gave Helen her idea.
Her letter was wrapped around a
smart can of sardines, and said in
part, "I hope that, since fish sus
l tained you in crossing the Hellespont,
I these will get you across to Oakland
'after your lecture." You can imagine
Mr. Halliburton's desire to meet the
author of this note! As I remember
her telling me, he sent her a telegram
jof thanks.
Helen can go way up in the legiti
mate, I feel sure, if she can stop
being so "good" on the stage. She
needs a "Sadie Thompson" role to
; wake people up and make them real
ize what she can do if given half a
I chance.
j "I refused to go on being the Spirit
of Goodness in the movies, and I'm
I just going to strike if I get another
j goody-goody stage role!" she has as
sured me.
It doesn't pay to be too good, you
see.

ducers of being, finally decided that
something drastic had to be done. She
couldn't go on forever as the ideal
ingenue when others with far less
ability were getting vivid, real-life
roles.
So she signed with Henry Duffy and
started to play stage leads. Imagine
her chagrin when she finds that —so
far —she is cast in just as "good"
stage parts as Hollywood insisted
upon handing her.
I've known Helen for the past year
and I think Heaven should come to
her rescue. The public has seen her
on the screen and stage in roles
which are saccharine, insipid, and
colorless. In private life she is not a
bit that way.
She is pretty. She dresses very
smartly—one always seems to find
her arrayed in a new and striking en
semble. She reads a great deal —not
only novels, but poetry, and serious
writers that she has to identify to me.
She is religious—l never really "saw"
the Stanford chapel until I went
through it with her and we stopped
to examine every detail.
Has Varied Interests
And while she has these qualities
which Hollywood has so devoutly
praised, she has others which have
not been allowed to crop out in her
theatrical career so far. She is inter
ested in everything young people like
to do, because she is young herself.
She likes to dance and lunching at a
fraternity house is as thrilling to her
as meeting the most prominent of
persona.
That is another one of her attrac
tive points—her wide acquaintance
ship with celebrities in every line of
work. She has written interviews with
Will Hays, and she is a friend of
Gene Tunney's. She has a cute pin
Charley Paddock gave her, and she'

is the only actress who has ever
preached a sermon in a Los Angeles
church.
Her meeting Richard Halliburton
illustrates her sense of humor. Patsy
Ruth Miller, her best friend, had bet
Helen on which of them would meet
| the famous adventurer first —neither
knowing him. Helen was doing "New
| Brooms" when he was due to lecture
!in San Francisco. She started her
J "campaign" as soon as she found he
i was coming to the city, but no one
j was personally acquainted with the
j dashing Richard.
Meets Halliburton
Halliburton finally arrived for a
one-day stay. Helen couldn't find any
one to introduce her so she wrote
him a letter —and knowing he would
be very busy she made it a very
novel one. If you will recall Hallibur
ton's accounts, you will remember
that he ate only fish before starting
his daring swim across the Helles
pont. That gave Helen her idea.
Her letter was wrapped around a
smart can of sardines, and said in
part, "I hope that, since fish sus
l tained you in crossing the Hellespont,
I these will get you across to Oakland
'after your lecture." You can imagine
Mr. Halliburton's desire to meet the
author of this note! As I remember
her telling me, he sent her a telegram
jof thanks.
Helen can go way up in the legiti
mate, I feel sure, if she can stop
being so "good" on the stage. She
needs a "Sadie Thompson" role to
; wake people up and make them real
ize what she can do if given half a
I chance.
j "I refused to go on being the Spirit
of Goodness in the movies, and I'm
I just going to strike if I get another
j goody-goody stage role!" she has as
sured me.
It doesn't pay to be too good, you
see.
Just how good does it pay to be?
Helen Ferguson, leading lady for Leo
Carillo in the Duffy stage hit, "Lorn
bardi Ltd.," wants to know.
Until recently Helen was the model
movie star of Hollywood. Whenever
scandal touched the film colony, the
profession unanimoualy countered
with "Have you met Helen Ferguson?"
Poor Helen was Exhibit A—the
"ideal" actress. She had good sense
as well as good looks, and never let
her name appear on any page but the
dramatic editors' —the "Blue Book of
the Screen" described her as admired
by every man, woman, and child in
the studios.
Helen was the "ideal" as far as
character was concerned, but this
very goodness kept her from becom
ing a really great actress. Everyone
knew she was good, so when it came
to assigning an outstanding colorful
role the producers never thought of
giving Helen a trial. She was seem
ingly irrevocably typed—always she
must be the sweet young thing—be
the Spirit of Goodness.
Even Mary Pickford couldn't get
away with being goody-good all the
time. How could Helen become a box
office hit without flesh-and-blood
parts.

tive points—her wide acquaintance
ship with celebrities in every line of
work. She has written interviews with
Will Hays, and she is a friend of
Gene Tunney's. She has a cute pin
Charley Paddock gave her, and she'

is the only actress who has ever
preached a sermon in a Los Angeles
church.
Her meeting Richard Halliburton
illustrates her sense of humor. Patsy
Ruth Miller, her best friend, had bet
Helen on which of them would meet
| the famous adventurer first —neither
knowing him. Helen was doing "New
| Brooms" when he was due to lecture
!in San Francisco. She started her
J "campaign" as soon as she found he
i was coming to the city, but no one
j was personally acquainted with the
j dashing Richard.
Meets Halliburton
Halliburton finally arrived for a
one-day stay. Helen couldn't find any
one to introduce her so she wrote
him a letter —and knowing he would
be very busy she made it a very
novel one. If you will recall Hallibur
ton's accounts, you will remember
that he ate only fish before starting
his daring swim across the Helles
pont. That gave Helen her idea.
Her letter was wrapped around a
smart can of sardines, and said in
part, "I hope that, since fish sus
l tained you in crossing the Hellespont,
I these will get you across to Oakland
'after your lecture." You can imagine
Mr. Halliburton's desire to meet the
author of this note! As I remember
her telling me, he sent her a telegram
jof thanks.
Helen can go way up in the legiti
mate, I feel sure, if she can stop
being so "good" on the stage. She
needs a "Sadie Thompson" role to
; wake people up and make them real
ize what she can do if given half a
I chance.
j "I refused to go on being the Spirit
of Goodness in the movies, and I'm
I just going to strike if I get another
j goody-goody stage role!" she has as
sured me.
It doesn't pay to be too good, you
see.
Just how good does it pay to be?
Helen Ferguson, leading lady for Leo
Carillo in the Duffy stage hit, "Lorn
bardi Ltd.," wants to know.
Until recently Helen was the model
movie star of Hollywood. Whenever
scandal touched the film colony, the
profession unanimoualy countered
with "Have you met Helen Ferguson?"
Poor Helen was Exhibit A—the
"ideal" actress. She had good sense
as well as good looks, and never let
her name appear on any page but the
dramatic editors' —the "Blue Book of
the Screen" described her as admired
by every man, woman, and child in
the studios.
Helen was the "ideal" as far as
character was concerned, but this
very goodness kept her from becom
ing a really great actress. Everyone
knew she was good, so when it came
to assigning an outstanding colorful
role the producers never thought of
giving Helen a trial. She was seem
ingly irrevocably typed—always she
must be the sweet young thing—be
the Spirit of Goodness.
Even Mary Pickford couldn't get
away with being goody-good all the
time. How could Helen become a box
office hit without flesh-and-blood
parts.
Helen Is Human
Once Hollywood makes up its mind
about a person, he is stuck to one
type of parts. Helen —and here is the
surprise—being much more human
than Bhe was suspected by the pro
ducers of being, finally decided that
something drastic had to be done. She
couldn't go on forever as the ideal
ingenue when others with far less
ability were getting vivid, real-life
roles.
So she signed with Henry Duffy and
started to play stage leads. Imagine
her chagrin when she finds that —so
far —she is cast in just as "good"
stage parts as Hollywood insisted
upon handing her.
I've known Helen for the past year
and I think Heaven should come to
her rescue. The public has seen her
on the screen and stage in roles
which are saccharine, insipid, and
colorless. In private life she is not a
bit that way.
She is pretty. She dresses very
smartly—one always seems to find
her arrayed in a new and striking en
semble. She reads a great deal —not
only novels, but poetry, and serious
writers that she has to identify to me.
She is religious—l never really "saw"
the Stanford chapel until I went
through it with her and we stopped
to examine every detail.
Has Varied Interests
And while she has these qualities
which Hollywood has so devoutly
praised, she has others which have
not been allowed to crop out in her
theatrical career so far. She is inter
ested in everything young people like
to do, because she is young herself.
She likes to dance and lunching at a
fraternity house is as thrilling to her
as meeting the most prominent of
persona.
