## 
### 
Motion pictures on the new eight- j
mile Cascade tunnel of the Great |
Northern Railway and a short talk j
on the electrification of the road are ;
the leading attractions of the open
meeting of the Stanford Branch, !
American Institute of Electrical Engi
neers, to be held in the Assembly
Hall at 7 o'clock tonight.
The program will consist of a one- j
reel motion picture on "Driving the j
Cascade Tunnel," showing interesting j
sidelights on drilling the tunnel, I
which was opened to traffic day be- !
fore yesterday. Carl Koch, Electrical 1
Engineering graduate, will give a j
short talk on "Electrification of the I
Great Northern Railway," which sys
tem includes the new tunnel in its
project. A two-reel picture, "Power !
Transformers," showing their manu- 1
facture, completes the program.
All interested persons, as well as |
A.I.E.E. members, are invited to at- j
