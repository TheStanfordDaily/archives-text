There are still a few running rec-1
ords that Paavo Nurmi has not been ,
able to ex-ase. While Paavo himself
holds the accepted world's records i
for one, three, four, and live miles, a ;
gentleman named Alfred Shrubb still
holds the marks for two, six, seven,
eight, nine, and ten miles. Last Octo
ber in Berlin, Peerless Paavo sur
passed Shrubb's ten-mile record, run
ning the distance in 50 minutes and
15 seconds, as against Alf's 50:40 3-5,
but this new mark has not yet been

j—the last two times beaten by Nur
mi. Then in November came his ten
mile effort.
W. G. George, still hale and hearty
in London, came to America about
ISBO as an amateur and beat the
famous Lon Myers in two out of three
races. Ife ran a mile in 4:12 3-4 in
1883, which is accepted as the profes
sional record, and in '86 turned in his
remarkable time trial in 4:10, two
lifths of a second faster than Nurmi
I ever ran the distance.

There are still a few running rec-1
ords that Paavo Nurmi has not been ,
able to ex-ase. While Paavo himself
holds the accepted world's records i
for one, three, four, and live miles, a ;
gentleman named Alfred Shrubb still
holds the marks for two, six, seven,
eight, nine, and ten miles. Last Octo
ber in Berlin, Peerless Paavo sur
passed Shrubb's ten-mile record, run
ning the distance in 50 minutes and
15 seconds, as against Alf's 50:40 3-5,
but this new mark has not yet been
accepted by the International Ama
teur Athletic Federation.
The devastating stride of Alf .
Shrubb broke record after record on
November sth, 1904, in the memor
able ten-mile race for which he had
trained for just one month. Shrubb's
diary of this thirty-day preparation !

| is still preserved, and it tells how in
; his daily workouts he ran or walked
184 miles! In 1903 this remarkable
man ran three miles in 14:17 3-5
! (Nurmi has surpassed that mark),
' and in May and June of the follow
ing year he did two miles in 9:9 3-5
' (still the outdoor record), four miles
in 19:23 2-5, and five miles in 24:33 2-5
j—the last two times beaten by Nur
