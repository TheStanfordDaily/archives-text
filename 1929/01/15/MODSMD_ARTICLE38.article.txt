# TROJAN DEBATERS IMPRESSED WITH STANFORD HALLS

### KENNETH MANSFIELD 
"Where can we get copies of the
'Stanford Chaparral,' and the 'Stan
ford Daily'?" was the first question
asked by the Trojan debaters when
they arrived on the campus yesterday
for lunch. "We wish to get a little
local color into our speeches tonight."
After their first request was granted
and they were lounging in the guest
rooms of Toyon and Branner halls,
they became interested in the extent
of the dormitory system at Stanford.
"We have no housing system com
parable to yours," commented Leo
Adams, debate manager as well as a
speaker on the Trojan team. "Your
system is probably a natural develop
ment arising from the lack of city
housing facilities."
Leo Harris thought the outstanding
feature of the halls here was the two
room combination found in Toyon
and Branner which he considered
quite spacious and convenient.
"We have two halls now," he said.
"One of them for men and the other
for women. There are only single
rooms in them and two persons oc
cupy each. The majority of the stu
dents live at home or in apartments."
All of the Southern debaters are
fraternity men and consider the par
ticipation of hall men in student ac
tivities quite a departure from the
ordinary.
After commenting on the proximity
of the San Francisco Mint to the
place where he breakfasted in con
nection with the number of silver
dollars he received as change, Clif
ford Weimer came back to the hall
topic.
"The position of the hall men here
is undoubtedly unique on the Coast,"
he said. "Although at U.S.C. the non
fraternity men greatly outnumber the
frat men, their scattered dwellings
lead to disorganization.
