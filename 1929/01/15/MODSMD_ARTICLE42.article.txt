## Federation Disapproves of Women's Participation In Olympic Games 
### 
Helen Masters Bunting, head of the
women's physical education depart
ment, was made a member of two im
portant committees at the fifth an
nual conference of the Women's Divi
sion of the National Amateur Athletic
Federation held January 3, 4, and 5
in New York City. Miss Bunting re
turned to the campus Sunday after
having attended the conference and
visited Wellesley College, the Bouve
School of Physical Education, and
the Boston School of Physical Educa
tion.
Miss Bunting was made a member
of the Executive Committee of the
Federation, which is composed of nine
members chosen to handle the tech
nical details of the organization. She
was also made chairman of a com
mittee appointed for the study of wo
men's participation in the Olympic
Games of 11C52 to be held in Los An
geles. Four other members will be ap
pointed.
The desirability of sports days
rather than highly specialized school
competition, the best methods of or
ganization and conduct of athletic ac
tivities among industrial groups, and
the question of women's participation
in Olympic Games were the main
topics of discussion at the conference. 1
The Women's Division of the Federa
tion went on record as disapproving
at tiie present time of women's par-1
ticipating in Olympic Games, feeling |
that the latter are so higrly commer- j
<ialized that they present opportunity j
for exploitation of women that there j
are too great dangers of overstrain- I
ing the individual, and that there is
too much emphasis upon specializa- !
tion of a few star athletes rather than j
upon the "sports for all' ideal which ,
is one of the objectives for which the
organization was established.
The Federation voted to offer its
strvices to proper authorities for as
sisting in the entertainment of and
acting as hostesses to the women 1
competitors in the Olympic Games in
10112. It feels that since the United ,
States is to be hostess to visiting j
athletes, the organization wishes to J
see that visitors are properly cared !
for and entertained. The Federation '
also voted to ask the proper authori- j
ties for permission to put on a sports
festival at the Games to demonstrate
the ideal of mass participation.

nual conference of the Women's Divi
sion of the National Amateur Athletic
Federation held January 3, 4, and 5
in New York City. Miss Bunting re
turned to the campus Sunday after
having attended the conference and
visited Wellesley College, the Bouve
School of Physical Education, and
the Boston School of Physical Educa
tion.
Miss Bunting was made a member
of the Executive Committee of the
Federation, which is composed of nine
members chosen to handle the tech
nical details of the organization. She
was also made chairman of a com
mittee appointed for the study of wo
men's participation in the Olympic
Games of 11C52 to be held in Los An
geles. Four other members will be ap
pointed.
The desirability of sports days
rather than highly specialized school
competition, the best methods of or
ganization and conduct of athletic ac
tivities among industrial groups, and
the question of women's participation
in Olympic Games were the main
topics of discussion at the conference. 1
The Women's Division of the Federa
tion went on record as disapproving
at tiie present time of women's par-1
ticipating in Olympic Games, feeling |
that the latter are so higrly commer- j
<ialized that they present opportunity j
for exploitation of women that there j
are too great dangers of overstrain- I
ing the individual, and that there is
too much emphasis upon specializa- !
tion of a few star athletes rather than j
upon the "sports for all' ideal which ,
is one of the objectives for which the
organization was established.
The Federation voted to offer its
strvices to proper authorities for as
sisting in the entertainment of and
acting as hostesses to the women 1
competitors in the Olympic Games in
10112. It feels that since the United ,
States is to be hostess to visiting j
athletes, the organization wishes to J
see that visitors are properly cared !
for and entertained. The Federation '
also voted to ask the proper authori- j
ties for permission to put on a sports
festival at the Games to demonstrate
the ideal of mass participation.
